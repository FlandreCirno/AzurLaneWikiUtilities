<span style="color:#fff157;">Suffolk：</span><br>
Intelligence reports that the Iron blood's newest battleships are set to sail through this area. If we surprise them here, the Queen will surely reward us upon our return!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Norfolk：</span><br>
*Sobs* Battleships? Are we really going to be a match for them?<br>
The water here is so cold... My entire body feels like its turning into ice... Why don't we just hurry back to port?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Suffolk：</span><br>
It's going to be fine! We're just here to scout. If a fight kicks off, it'll be up to our big sisters to handle it. They're close by and ready to provide support whenever we need it~!<br>
All I see is fog and ice... I don't think anyone else is around. Plus, no matter what battleship appears, they'll turn tail and run once they find out that our big sisters are here, haha!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Norfolk：</span><br>
Something feels strange though, don't you think? I'd be relieved if we just spent the rest of our day looking out to sea and then heading home for dinner...<br>
Hmm? Wait a second... My radar seems to be picking up a strange signal up ahead...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Suffolk：</span><br>
What? Let me see.<br>
Iron blood destroyer squadron detected ahead! Maybe it's just a few scouts? Report to Hood immediately!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Norfolk：</span><br>
My... my antenna is... f-f-frozen into... a p-p-popsicle...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Suffolk：</span><br>
We've got to hold off their squadron. It's just a few production-type destroyers... We should be able to handle this!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Norfolk：</span><br>
Are... are we going to fight? *Sobs* I knew this would happen...<br>

<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Norfolk：</span><br>
Wow, Suffolk! We're so strong! We defeated so many enemies at the same time!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Suffolk：</span><br>
Don't get cocky... Those ships were clearly there to test us... We haven't even seen the Iron blood's new battleship yet. I've got a bad feeling about this...<br>
<span style="color:#ff0000;">？？？？？：</span><br>
Hehehe... So there was an ambush after all! Looking for us?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Suffolk：</span><br>
Danger!!! Enemies at starboard!!! Two large warships detected at 220 degrees... New Iron blood battleship spotted! All personnel, get ready to fight!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Norfolk：</span><br>
Uh oh...<br>
<span style="color:#ff0000;">？？？？？：</span><br>
Haha~! Two puny cruisers? Getting ready to attack? Hah! I suppose I'll try to enjoy this as much as I can~!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Hood：</span><br>
Not just two cruisers! Hood and Prince of Wales from the Royal Navy, here for backup! Let's have a showdown, shall we?<br>

<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Suffolk：</span><br>
Big sister! You're finally here!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Hood：</span><br>
You've done well. It's time for us to give the Iron blood a taste of their own medicine. Target Bismarck, their lead ship! Fire!<br>
<span style="color:#ff0000;">Bismarck ??：</span><br>
“'The Glory of the Royal Navy'? This should be fun. I wonder if you're actually strong enough to satisfy me.<br>

<span style="color:#ff0000;">Bismarck??：</span><br>
You've got quite the firepower, but it's useless against me!<br>

<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Prince of Wales：</span><br>
All ships, focus fire on the ship hiding in the back. That's Bismarck, our target!<br>
<span style="color:#ff0000;">Prinz Eugen：</span><br>
We've been figured out... To be expected from King George V, I suppose...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Prince of Wales：</span><br>
Excuse me, but I'm Prince of Wales... You've mistaken me for someone else.<br>
<span style="color:#ff0000;">Prinz Eugen：</span><br>
Who cares, all you sisters look the same to me. Let's see what you've got!<br>
<span style="color:#ff0000;">Bismarck：</span><br>
Well, it seems like a fight is inevitable. Jot Dora!<br>

<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Prince of Wales：</span><br>
Hood!!!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Hood：</span><br>
Ah... This power... extraordinary... Incredible that you've found this strength…<br>
<span style="color:#ff0000;">Bismarck：</span><br>
We've been found out. Eugen, it's time to retreat.<br>
<span style="color:#ff0000;">Prinz Eugen：</span><br>
Oh? We've got the upper hand! Why would we turn back now?<br>
<span style="color:#ff0000;">Bismarck：</span><br>
Our secret weapon has been discovered. Dragging this out will only expose us further. Follow my orders and retreat immediately!<br>
<span style="color:#ff0000;">Prinz Eugen：</span><br>
Damn... So there's no helping it.... Take care, little sheep. We'll be seeing you again.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Hood：</span><br>
... Why... why would you betray our alliance...<br>
<span style="color:#ff0000;">Bismarck：</span><br>
Honor and loyalty... Only with great power can we truly save humanity. We've... we've just chosen a different path.<br>
I don't expect you to understand. Only those looking back on these moments will be able to decide who is right and who is wrong.<br>
My old friend... May we meet in Valhalla...<br>
<span style="color:#ff0000;">?????：</span><br>
... Humanity is such an interesting lifeform... The power we gave them was just the beginning... History has already begun to be rewritten...<br>
Let's continue our observations for some time... I have great expectations for their future developments...<br>
If we didn't take these steps, coming back to this era would have been meaningless, no? Ahaha...<br>
<br>
The world order is crumbling... Those with power must stand up and fight against the currents of evil and the torrents of history.<br>
It is known, however, that power begets power, bringing forth even stronger waves...<br>
