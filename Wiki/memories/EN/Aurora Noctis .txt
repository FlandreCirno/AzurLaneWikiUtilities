Royal Islands -  Several days prior<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Enterprise：</span><br>
—That concludes our report regarding the Northern Parliament's war efforts. It roughly lines up with the information they released, but I'd like to hear your opinions.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Howe ：</span><br>
The Northern Parliament demonstrated strength far surpassing our expectations during the previous operation. The fact that they, with such a formidable fighting force, would request our aid... does not bode well.<br>
I thought that capturing the Iceberg Stronghold would suppress Siren activity, but it instead seems to have sent them into a rampage... What an unforeseen disaster...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Valiant ：</span><br>
Hmm... Up until now, the Northern Parliament has done well in containing the Sirens to the Arctic...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Howe ：</span><br>
Indeed. Should they be defeated, the Sirens would flood outward, threatening not only the Union-held side of the Northern Pacific, but also the Royal Islands.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Valiant ：</span><br>
As if I would allow that!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Enterprise：</span><br>
I agree. In other words, can I take it that the Royal Navy has no objections to supporting the Northern Parliament?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Howe ：</span><br>
"The Eagle Union will provide relief supplies, and the Royal Navy will form a force consisting of a transport fleet and escort fleet to deliver the supplies to the Northern Parliament." ...Your Majesty, your counsel?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Queen Elizabeth：</span><br>
I accept the proposal! By the way, what's going on with the Iron Blood?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Saratoga：</span><br>
Allow Sister Sara to explain! ...According to the intel, the Iron Blood seems to be moving their forces to the Barents Sea, so please be careful when passing through that area!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Howe ：</span><br>
They're seriously after the Polar route...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Queen Elizabeth：</span><br>
Hmph! Bring it on! If that's how they want to do things, we'll be sure to show them some Royal Navy "hospitality!"<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Saratoga：</span><br>
Elly~ Are you serious about that...?!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Queen Elizabeth：</span><br>
Heh! We've got to teach them a lesson about the folly of trying to mess with the Polar route!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Enterprise：</span><br>
...Ahem. In that case, we'll provide the supplies as agreed upon. One more issue though, regarding the commander's situation...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Howe ：</span><br>
Yes, if I recall, the commander had plans to stay in the Northern Parliament a bit longer and told you to stay behind to manage the war situation...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Enterprise：</span><br>
Right. I received a message from the Northern Parliament, and they seem to want to extend the commander's stay...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Valiant ：</span><br>
Sigh... What a time to be making such a request.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Saratoga：</span><br>
Of course we're opposed to that! After we deliver the relief supplies, the war situation over there should improve, and there won't be any reason for Commander to stay in that walk-in freezer of a country!<br>
Y'know, actually if they're going to be difficult, why don't we take a fleet from SD City's Naval Headquarters and retrieve Commander ourselves?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Howe ：</span><br>
Isn't SD City already too tied up dealing with the Sakura Empire to handle something like that?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Queen Elizabeth：</span><br>
I have a better idea, so listen up. Why don't we just have our transport fleet escort the commander back to the Eagle Union?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Valiant ：</span><br>
(This is a prime chance to show the commander the leadership of the Royal Navy, and maybe go sightseeing around Europa as well... Come on, Elizabeth, this is your chance!)<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Queen Elizabeth：</span><br>
(Heheh! You'll have to make preparations too, so that nothing goes wrong on this operation!)<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Enterprise：</span><br>
I have no objections.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Howe ：</span><br>
Yes... I'll be sure to make the proper arrangements.<br>
To summarize Her Majesty's counsel, after delivering the Eagle Union's supplies to the Northern Parliament, the commander will be welcome here in the Royal Islands before being escorted back to the Eagle Union. With that in order, may we work as one to complete this operation!<br>
<br>
[Bill: Regarding the Leasing of Equipment and Supplies]<br>
"To promote the victory of Azur Lane over the Sirens, and to achieve other goals that benefit the Eagle Union"<br>
"As agreed upon by the legislative body of the Eagle Union, this bill shall be passed into law as 'a bill of the highest order for the sake of winning the war.'"<br>
"The following items are applicable to this bill—" <br>
"War Supplies refers to the following—"<br>
"1. Any armaments, ammunition, planes, or ships"<br>
"2. All of the following with the exception of items that directly count towards naval power - Machines, facilities, tools, and supplies necessary for production, processing, repair, and/or maintenance"<br>
"3. Any components or basic materials of the items aforementioned"<br>
"...Naturally."<br>
"......"<br>

<br>
Upon receiving the relief supplies from the Eagle Union, the Royal Navy quickly assembled their transport and escort fleets.<br>
Their mission was to pass through the Barents Sea's polar night - in other words, the extremely disadvantageous task of running a convoy through prolonged darkness. However, the Northern Parliament's request had to be prioritized.<br>
Fortunately, the winds were favorable when the fleet departed from the Royal Islands.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Belfast：</span><br>
It's about time to depart. Hermione, have you finished your preparations?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Hermione：</span><br>
Yes. The transport and escort fleets, as well as the supporting main fleet and vanguard, have all been assembled. We can set sail once the supplies are loaded.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Belfast：</span><br>
Very well. As representatives of the Royal Maids in this operation, please fulfill the duties entrusted to you by Her Majesty.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Edinburgh & Sheffield：</span><br>
Understood!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Hermione：</span><br>
……<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Belfast：</span><br>
Hermione, what's the matter?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Hermione：</span><br>
Hwuh...?! Oh, my apologies... I was just a bit nervous...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Belfast：</span><br>
Oh my, is this your first major mission in quite some time? I have no doubts about your abilities, Hermione. If anything, I hope you'll be able to look after my sister.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Edinburgh：</span><br>
Gosh, Bel, what do you mean by that? I'm perfectly capable of looking after myself!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Belfast：</span><br>
Hehe~ I know. In any case, let's go over the mission objectives one last time.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Hermione：</span><br>
We are to form a fleet to transport relief supplies to the Northern Parliament. We will then retrieve the commander and come back to the Royal Islands, before transferring—<br>
If the Iron Blood tries to intercept us, the supporting fleet and the main fleet will join up to eliminate the threat.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Sheffield：</span><br>
(And finally, our secret mission to collect information about the Northern Union, and about the "Reenactments.")<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Edinburgh：</span><br>
See, I remembered all of that! I've even reviewed the reports about the Northern Parliament's uhh... ahem, yes, the Iceberg Stronghold!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Hermione：</span><br>
Well done, Miss Edinburgh.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Edinburgh：</span><br>
Yes, yes, praise me more! I'm Bel's older sister after all, so you can count on me~!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Belfast：</span><br>
All right. Hermione, Sheffield, Edinburg, I look forward to the good news.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Hermione：</span><br>
Understood! I'll do my best!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Edinburgh：</span><br>
Damn, why can't Bel just praise me...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Sheffield：</span><br>
(If Her Majesty bothered to come all the way out to port, then she might be...)<br>
Sorry, Belfast, there's still something that's bothering me... Please take care of Her Majesty.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Belfast：</span><br>
I will, Sheffy. Make sure you also stay safe.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Sheffield：</span><br>
...Glory to the Queen.<br>

<br>
Barents Sea - Royal Navy Escort Fleet<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Eagle ：</span><br>
Everyone, I have some bad news. The Northern Parliament's destroyer fleet, which was supposed to join us, was suddenly summoned to the front lines and no longer will be coming.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Hermione ：</span><br>
Wow... They're even pulling the old destroyers to the front lines...?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Eagle ：</span><br>
That seems to be the case. I heard that even the commander went to help out.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Hermione ：</span><br>
Even the commander? ...We might not be able to fulfill our mission even after dropping off the supplies then.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Jamaica：</span><br>
If things go south, the Boss won't be able to leave the Northern Parliament then...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Hermione ：</span><br>
That's not good... I hope the commander stays safe...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Eagle ：</span><br>
Worst case scenario, we'll have to ask Her Majesty if we can directly reinforce them on the front line as well.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Jamaica：</span><br>
Worst case scenario, huh...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Hermione ：</span><br>
What's with this awful weather though? Neither the sun nor the wind seems to be on our side.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Eagle ：</span><br>
The weather's not going to deter the Iron Blood. All we can hope for is that they won't be able to exercise their airpower to its fullest extent.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Hermione ：</span><br>
At least we're not the only ones being affected. Based on the fact that our fleets haven't been detected yet, the Iron Blood recon planes seem to also be running into problems.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Jamaica：</span><br>
Hmph. I guess for the time being, our decoy be working well.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Eagle ：</span><br>
I hope that's the case... Right now, I'm more concerned about submarines. Our detection systems won't work as well in this turbulent weather.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Hermione ：</span><br>
That's true... I hope that we can talk things through with the Iron Blood and resolve things peacefully...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Eagle ：</span><br>
I appreciate the optimism, but I don't think they're coming to chat. In any case, let's all keep our wits about us. The people fighting on the front lines are waiting for our aid.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Hermione ：</span><br>
Indeed. Oh, it's time to check in with the supporting fleet.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Eagle ：</span><br>
Appreciate it. ...To the Royal Navy HQ, the escort fleet is currently en route to the Northern Parliament as planned. No abnormalities detected in surrounding waters yet. Over.<br>

{{折叠面板|标题=Aurora|选项=4|主框=1|样式=primary|展开=否}}
<br>
A colorful band of light shimmers across the night skies of the Barent Sea, illuminating the sea along with the stars.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Hermione ：</span><br>
So this is an aurora... Absolutely breathtaking...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Jamaica：</span><br>
Like a sash of light weaving across the infinite darkness... Ahh, how it makes this eye resonate with power...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Hermione ：</span><br>
What do you mean by that...?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Eagle ：</span><br>
That's not anything you need to learn, Hermione. The fact that we can see the aurora means that there aren't any clouds, which also means...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Hermione ：</span><br>
It'll be easier for both us and the enemy to spot each other... right?<br>
Woah...! An Iron Blood recon plane has shown up, tailing a mass-produced ship!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Eagle ：</span><br>
I knew they'd be here!<br>
Soon, they'll bear down upon us with their entire force... The illumination from the aurora has given them the perfect window to strike.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Jamaica：</span><br>
The sky is changing way too quickly! Is this The World's influence...?!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Hermione ：</span><br>
Jamaica, now's the time to tap into the power stored within your eye!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Jamaica：</span><br>
...Oh!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Eagle ：</span><br>
(Those two may be an odd duo, but it's working out...)<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Hermione ：</span><br>
Eagle, your hunch was right. However, we're not going to be able to change the weather, so we'll have to make the best of this situation...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Eagle ：</span><br>
That's right. I'll suppress their air power, so stay vigilant of the enemy submarines and protect the transport fleet!<br>
{{折叠面板|内容结束}}

{{折叠面板|标题=Ambush|选项=5|主框=1|样式=primary|展开=否}}
<span style="color:#ec5d53;">U-73：</span><br>
Lurk quietly... Approach quietly... and STRIKE QUIETLY...!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Hermione ：</span><br>
There you are, Iron Blood submarine!<br>
<span style="color:#ec5d53;">U-73：</span><br>
What... How'd you find me?!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Hermione ：</span><br>
Turn back, Iron Blood submarine. This is the escort fleet of the Royal Navy's Polar Transport Fleet. We ask that you turn back at once!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Jamaica：</span><br>
How bold of you to attack a convoy that I'm personally escorting!<br>
<span style="color:#ec5d53;">U-73：</span><br>
Fat chance of that happening! Our main fleet will be here shortly, so you should just give up before things get ugly!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Hermione ：</span><br>
(The Iron Blood's main fleet is coming...? What should we do...?)<br>
<span style="color:#ec5d53;">U-73：</span><br>
...Apparently, you have no intention of surrendering your cargo.<br>
But too bad for you! Today's going to be my big break, and you're just going to be my stepping stones towards greatness!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Jamaica：</span><br>
Let me guess, the next thing you're going to say is, "Come at me!" In that case...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Hermione ：</span><br>
Hermione, commencing anti-submarine combat! For Her Majesty the Queen!<br>
{{折叠面板|内容结束}}

{{折叠面板|标题=Analysis|选项=6|主框=1|样式=primary|展开=否}}
<span style="color:#ec5d53;">U-73：</span><br>
Crap, they're really getting serious, and I need to reload my torpedo tubes... We'll settle this later!<br>
<br>
After forcing Hermione to swerve sharply to evade her last torpedo, U-73 quickly dove under the waves and retreated from the battlefield.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Jamaica：</span><br>
After all that talk, she didn't even last an episode.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Hermione ：</span><br>
Hmm... It seems like she didn't bring an entire wolfpack with her. Was she really just acting alone...?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Eagle ：</span><br>
I've neutralized their air force as well.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Hermione ：</span><br>
As for other submarines... I'm not picking up on any. Does this mean we've successfully repelled them?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Eagle ：</span><br>
Mm. Any damages?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Hermione ：</span><br>
I don't think so. Nobody got hit, right?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Jamaica：</span><br>
...How bizarre.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Eagle ：</span><br>
You're right. It makes no sense to send such a small force to attack an entire convoy.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Hermione ：</span><br>
Maybe they were just trying to gauge our strength? That submarine said something about the main fleet being on its way...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Eagle ：</span><br>
Not sure. What do you think they could learn from an engagement like that...?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Hermione ：</span><br>
Th-that's right, even if there was a main fleet on its way, it'd be too late to respond by the time they reported back.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Eagle ：</span><br>
Wait a second... What if they were trying to lure us into a certain position...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Jamaica：</span><br>
You mean, they were trying to separate us from the support fleet?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Hermione ：</span><br>
Oh no! The support fleet is in danger!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Eagle ：</span><br>
It's too early to say that. The Iron Blood shouldn't know that another fleet is even here, let alone their position.<br>
I'll send another recon out to re-assess the situation. Hermione, Jamaica, both of you stay vigilant.<br>
{{折叠面板|内容结束}}

{{折叠面板|标题=Orders to Turn Back|选项=7|主框=1|样式=primary|展开=否}}
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Hermione ：</span><br>
We're receiving communications from the Naval HQ. It's from... Her Majesty?!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Queen Elizabeth？：</span><br>
Notifying all fleets! Tirpitz and the Scharnhorst sisters are... Anyway, the Iron Blood's main fleet is heading towards the Barents Sea!<br>
Have all ships turn around right now and intercept their fleet!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Eagle ：</span><br>
They're bringing all those battleships out here? Great, that...<br>
...shouldn't be right... Huh? Can you repeat that again?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Hermione ：</span><br>
Sure. The message ordered us to turn around and intercept their fleet...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Eagle ：</span><br>
It's true that the Royal Navy doctrine encourages us to proactively take the fight to the enemy if they seek to assemble their forces against us... but even when we're on a transport mission?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Jamaica：</span><br>
If we turned around and left, what would the transport fleet do?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Hermione ：</span><br>
That's right... And if the Northern Parliament and Eagle Union get attacked, they'll be in big trouble...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Eagle ：</span><br>
I don't think Her Majesty would choose this place for a decisive confrontation with the Iron Blood. Surely there's some kind of mistake...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Hermione ：</span><br>
I'll double-check!<br>
<span style="color:#ec5d53;">U-101：</span><br>
U-73 retreated, and so did the air squadron. Now, the Royal Navy fleet is safe for the time being~<br>
<span style="color:#ec5d53;">U81：</span><br>
They're still maintaining their defenses... The escort fleet is staying vigilant.<br>
<span style="color:#ec5d53;">U-522：</span><br>
Well, what'd you expect from such an optimistic plan? It's not like an escort fleet would randomly abandon the convoy. Like, what the heck is that lush thinking anyway?<br>
<span style="color:#ec5d53;">U81：</span><br>
Who, Eugen? Didn't she tell us to wait patiently for an opening?<br>
If we wait a bit longer, maybe the escort fleet will decide to leave... Even if they don't, we'll still have our chance soon.<br>
<span style="color:#ec5d53;">U-522：</span><br>
Sure, sure. I've got time to kill anyway~<br>

Eugen, you sure took your sweet time. The hell were you doing?<br>

Calm down, Hipper. Your cute face will get all wrinkly if you pout so much~<br>
<span style="color:#ec5d53;">Admiral Hipper：</span><br>
I can't calm down because you're the one in charge of the operation.<br>
<span style="color:#ec5d53;">Prinz Eugen：</span><br>
Is that so? Isn't our mighty Tirpitz the flagship this time?<br>
Anyway, to put on the finishing touches...♪<br>

Do I get to sortie yet? You've got some nerve to keep me waiting like this!<br>

No matter how airtight they think their plan is, we'll stab it full of holes.<br>
<span style="color:#ec5d53;">Scharnhorst：</span><br>
Ahaha! Let's show those pompous bastards an explosively good time!<br>
<span style="color:#ec5d53;">Admiral Graf Spee：</span><br>
(...I've always been alone... But now, with everyone...)<br>
<span style="color:#ec5d53;">Tirpitz：</span><br>
(I know how you feel, Spee. Cherish this moment, for you are needed for the Iron Blood to achieve victory.)<br>
<span style="color:#ec5d53;">Prinz Eugen：</span><br>
Now, mercurial light of the North... How shall we bend you to achieve our victory?<br>
If you wish to ensnare the core fleet of the Iron Blood, you may not like what you find in your net.<br>
Now, show me how you dance, my little queen and your loyal followers~♪<br>
Victory to the Iron Blood!<br>

<br>
Barents Sea - Royal Navy Supporting Fleet<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Perseus ：</span><br>
The previous Great War, huh? Vampire, you already know what that was like, right?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Vampire：</span><br>
Of course. I have more experience fighting the Sirens than any of you.<br>
Back then, the Iron Blood and Royal Navy both fought the Sirens together as a part of Azur Lane.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Perseus ：</span><br>
But now, we're traversing through this endless darkness to try to eliminate them...<br>
<br>
Suddenly, a dazzling array of light wove through the sky, illuminating the position of the Royal Navy's supporting fleet.<br>
The shimmering expanse mapped the starry sky onto the water's surface, bathing Perseus and the others in a scene of fairytale-like beauty.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Perseus：</span><br>
My goodness...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Vampire：</span><br>
This is...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Perseus：</span><br>
...It's like a painting coming to life...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Vampire：</span><br>
Usually the paintings try to capture this kind of beauty, but your point is well taken.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Sheffield：</span><br>
Do note, however, that we have an increased probability to be detected and attacked because of the increased visibility.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Vampire：</span><br>
Do people have no sense of romance these days...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Sheffield：</span><br>
First of all, it is abnormal and unscientific for such a large-scale aurora to suddenly appear out of nowhere.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Perseus ：</span><br>
Natural phenomena like this do appear in the Polar North, though it is strange that we didn't see any signs of an aurora given the visibility.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Sheffield：</span><br>
That is reasonable, and I may be overthinking things, but please be very careful.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Vampire：</span><br>
Sheffield, all that worrying cannot possibly be good for your health.<br>
There is such splendour before you, and it would simply be sinful to not relax and appreciate it~<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Sheffield：</span><br>
My sincerest apologies, but we are in the middle of an operation. Miss Vampire, if your soul is in need of "cleaning," you may perhaps find my "services" adequate?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Vampire：</span><br>
Ah, um, I shall pass on that!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Perseus ：</span><br>
Vampire, don't you think it's a good idea to have your casket freshened up a little?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Sheffield & Vampire：</span><br>
...Huh?<br>
{{折叠面板|内容结束}}

{{折叠面板|标题=Leaked Information|选项=10|主框=1|样式=primary|展开=否}}
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Perseus ：</span><br>
According to the information we have, the Northern Parliament is in peril and even the commander is fighting on the front lines.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Sheffield：</span><br>
I can only pray for everyone's safety.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Vampire：</span><br>
You don't seem like the praying type. Worried about the commander~?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Sheffield：</span><br>
It is our directive to escort the commander back to the Royal Islands. Surely you have no objections to those orders?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Vampire：</span><br>
Nope, none at all~<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Perseus ：</span><br>
...Everyone, I'd like to remind you that there may be more pressing matters than how the commander and the Northern Parliament are faring...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Sheffield：</span><br>
Is the Iron Blood making their move?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Perseus ：</span><br>
The recons we sent out seem to have found the enemy fleet... And it looks like a storm is coming for us.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Sheffield：</span><br>
A storm? My apologies, but I'm not observing anything to corroborate that...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Perseus ：</span><br>
I'm talking about the enemy. Tirpitz and the Scharnhorst sisters are there, as well as Deutschland and Graf Spee...<br>
Then there's Prinz Eugen, Admiral Hipper, and a massive number of mass-produced ships.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Vampire：</span><br>
Those tin buckets stand no chance against us! We'll smash them to pieces if they try to approach our transport fleet!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Sheffield：</span><br>
Do we know where they're headed?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Perseus ：</span><br>
Let's see... They seem to be coming straight at us.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Sheffield：</span><br>
..How is that possible? Unlike the much larger transport fleet, we should've been concealed the entire time. Besides, they just made contact with the escort fleet, and we haven't seen any ships get inside our detection range...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Perseus ：</span><br>
That means our communications must have been intercepted.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Vampire：</span><br>
All right, we can speculate about that later! A ridiculously huge fleet is coming straight at us, so we need to decide if we're going to fight or run!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Perseus ：</span><br>
We've already been spotted, so I don't think running will do us any good at this point. We'd best call the main fleet and engage the enemy at once.<br>
As Her Majesty planned, I shall destroy the Iron Blood's main fleet!<br>

The Northern Lights actually came out at a time like this...<br>
The only one who could've devised this plan is Eugen... Nay, it must have been the "assistant," Friedrich der Große.<br>
<span style="color:#ec5d53;">Prinz Eugen：</span><br>
Of course it's her plan. But you know, she's such a stickler about the details, it's killing me...<br>
...Oh my, is that a Royal recon plane? What are we ever to do if they "find out" about our plans?<br>
Now, for the next move...<br>
<span style="color:#ec5d53;">Z2：</span><br>
Prinz Eugen, we've intercepted a transmission from the Royal Navy's supporting fleet.<br>
<span style="color:#ec5d53;">Prinz Eugen：</span><br>
Well done. Ah, how proud I am of our wonderful Iron Blood technology... Ehehe~<br>
...I wonder whose name I should use next. Maybe using that little queen's name will be a bit more believable?<br>
<span style="color:#ec5d53;">Z2：</span><br>
Prinz Eugen... You're having too much fun with this...<br>
<span style="color:#ec5d53;">Prinz Eugen：</span><br>
Eh? It's not like I particularly enjoy my job... But you also wouldn't want to face the Royal Navy head-on, would you?<br>
Anyway, I'm going to go relay the proper timing of the attack to the submarines.<br>
<span style="color:#ec5d53;">Z2：</span><br>
I know, I know... But, how long will the Royal Navy continue to move according to our expectations?<br>
<span style="color:#ec5d53;">Prinz Eugen：</span><br>
The submarines are the "wedges" that will fracture the Reenactment. What matters is that "They" will appear there, not whether we can actually draw away the escort fleet.<br>
And of course, we can't have our little support fleet here getting in the way, now can we?<br>

Admiral Hipper's group has broken off from the main fleet and is rapidly approaching us!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Vampire：</span><br>
They won't even let us stall for time, huh?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Sheffield：</span><br>
However, they've now split up their forces. Even if we are unable to take on the entire main force, we should be more than capable of taking on a force of destroyers and cruisers.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Perseus ：</span><br>
Sheffield is right. I'll try to head toward Howe's position as I fight.<br>
Hopefully that's the only trick they have up their sleeves... Phew...<br>

I've heard much about you, Admiral Hipper. It's a pleasure to meet you in person. I am Perseus, Royal Navy aircraft carrier.<br>

Huhh? A pleasure? You've already started attacking us!!<br>

A Lady of the Royal Navy must conduct herself with grace and elegance at all times. With that out of the way, I hope that we can have a cordial relationship.<br>

That would be strategically disadvantageous, so please forgive me for being unable to accept your proposal.<br>

<span style="color:#ec5d53;">Admiral Hipper：</span><br>
Don't worry, it's not your fault. There's only so much you can do with all those planes circling over us.<br>
They might be a pain to deal with, but they'll just make better for prey this way. I already told you that before, didn't I?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Vampire：</span><br>
Thanks for holding Hipper back. We should be safe for a while.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Perseus ：</span><br>
I don't think so. The Iron Blood's main fleet has already joined up with Hipper.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Vampire：</span><br>
How are their battleships moving that fast?!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Sheffield：</span><br>
Perseus, are you absolutely certain that the Iron Blood's main fleet has joined up with Admiral Hipper?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Perseus ：</span><br>
What do you mean...? I'm sure I saw a ship in the distance.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Sheffield：</span><br>
It might just be my imagination, but could you send your recon planes a bit closer to the Iron Blood fleet?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Perseus ：</span><br>
I don't mind, but that runs the risk of it getting shot down... Wait, what's this?<br>
Tirpitz and Scharnhorst's anti-air guns aren't responding...<br>
Do they not feel like wasting ammo on a single recon plane? No, this has to be...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Sheffield：</span><br>
I knew it. The "main fleet" is actually a bunch of dummies.<br>
Vampire, Perseus, let's turn around and take out the enemy.<br>
<br>
The evidence was clear. A speed that was inconsistent with that of a battleship. Anti-air weapons that didn't react... In other words, "Tirpitz is not here."<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Vampire：</span><br>
Gosh, we almost got tricked by their decoy.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Perseus ：</span><br>
It's only natural that we'd be wary of a main fleet.<br>

Barents Sea - Royal Navy Main Fleet<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Icarus：</span><br>
We've just passed the Svalbard Islands! Soon, we'll enter the Northern Parliament's waters.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Howe：</span><br>
Thank you, Icarus. Your experience has been invaluable.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Icarus：</span><br>
Hehe, escorting is my forte after all!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Howe：</span><br>
The transport fleet has made it past the halfway point safely... So far, we haven't seen anything out of the ordinary.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Valiant：</span><br>
Edinburg, make sure to check your communications equipment regularly. Do keep in mind that a high-intensity aurora like this is likely to affect radio transmissions.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Edinburgh：</span><br>
Yes, I know... So far, all communication equipment is working correctly and we haven't received any transmissions.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Valiant：</span><br>
Hearing that the Iron Blood would be coming out to play was getting me quite motivated. It would have been an excellent opportunity to display my charismatic leadership after all.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Howe：</span><br>
Is that really necessary? Wouldn't your reputation improve if we just safely delivered the cargo and brought back the commander?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Valiant：</span><br>
W-well, of course, but wouldn't it be a bit boring if things ended like this? See, I'm all decked out to fight the Iron Blood's main fleet! <br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Howe ：</span><br>
About that... I heard that Bismarck hasn't been commanding the fleet directly as of late, and has delegated that responsibility to some "assistants."<br>
Tirpitz, Graf Spee, and the Scharnhorst sisters all suffered various degrees of damage during prior confrontations, so even if their main fleet showed up, I don't think it'd be the kind of battle that Valiant is hoping for.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Icarus ：</span><br>
It's a pity we won't be getting any fireworks to go with this aurora...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Valiant ：</span><br>
But I, Valiant, the honourable Queen Elizabeth-class battleship, will not underestimate our foes! I'll show these Iron Blood cowards that they have no claim upon this route!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Howe ：</span><br>
(I wonder if I'm supposed to break out into applause now...)<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Valiant ：</span><br>
By the way, I noticed that we've only engaged with enemy submarines so far...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Icarus ：</span><br>
Better yet, why don't we just send a message to the Iron Blood fleet and challenge them to a decisive battle? We're ready for them after all—<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Valiant ：</span><br>
W-wait, didn't we just say to not underestimate the enemy? Something like that wouldn't be advisable!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Howe ：</span><br>
The quickest path to victory seems to be duking it out with the enemy, face-to-face.<br>
The Northern Parliament urgently needs our help, so why don't we tell Her Majesty that we'll have to teach those nasty Sirens a lesson before we can bring the commander back?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Valiant ：</span><br>
Unless something drastic happens, I don't think the Northern Parliament will allow us to directly intervene on the battlefield. Hmm, what should we do...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Howe ：</span><br>
(We can always ask for permission after we get there... But I wonder why the Northern Parliament is still so reserved about asking for aid, even in their current situation...)<br>
(I shouldn't overthink things though... We still have to get there safely after all.)<br>

Lady Valiant, watch out!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Valiant ：</span><br>
Woah! ...Nice shot, Edinburgh! ...But damn, was that a Siren carrier just now?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Icarus ：</span><br>
We just got a message from the Northern Parliament! Some Sirens have broken through the defense line and are making their way towards us!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Valiant ：</span><br>
Bloody hell, they could've told us before the Sirens got here. What's the Northern Parliament doing anyway?!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Howe ：</span><br>
Icarus, any news about the commander?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Icarus ：</span><br>
Yes, there's an addendum! The commander says that the breach in the defensive line has been fortified, but there weren't enough forces to spare to chase after the Sirens...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Valiant ：</span><br>
Phew... At least the commander is safe. But... we're going to be in a spot of trouble over here.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Icarus ：</span><br>
Should we deal with the Sirens first, or back up our allies first...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Valiant ：</span><br>
What do you think?! The Sirens are popping out left and right, so we're not going to be able to go anywhere without dealing with them first!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Howe ：</span><br>
You're right... We won't be able to accomplish our objective unless we defeat the Sirens.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Icarus ：</span><br>
Apparently, a new type of Siren appeared from the Iceberg Stronghold! Please be careful!<br>

I thought I had a good grasp of the situation from looking over the data, but this new type of Siren... is far more troublesome than I anticipated!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Howe ：</span><br>
The escort fleet wouldn't be able to handle enemies like these if the transport fleet gets attacked.<br>
We can't afford to waste any more time here and group up with the transport fleet.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Icarus ：</span><br>
But, the support fleet is still drawing the attention of the Iron Blood! If we don't go help out...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Edinburgh：</span><br>
We can't just abandon our escort fleet, but the support fleet needs our help too...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Valiant ：</span><br>
Get in contact with the Naval HQ! Worst case scenario, the support fleet still has the option to retreat to the Royal Islands!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Howe ：</span><br>
But then, the Iron Blood fleet would turn around and pincer us...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Valiant ：</span><br>
If that's what they want, then we'll give it to them! They shall know that Valiant loses to no foe!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Communicator：</span><br>
———————<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Edinburgh：</span><br>
I'm trying to send the message, but I'm not getting a response...!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Valiant ：</span><br>
This must be the doing of those accursed Sirens! We don't even know if the message got through to HQ... Damn, what do we do now?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Icarus ：</span><br>
Th-then, our only option is to go all-out...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Howe ：</span><br>
Valiant, your decision?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Valiant ：</span><br>
Hmph! I won't be made a fool of in front of Elizabeth! Let's review our options.<br>
Anyway, our primary objective is to protect the transport fleet so that it can deliver its cargo to the Northern Parliament — that's right, we don't need to defeat the Iron Blood, only repel them.<br>
The support fleet might be in trouble, but with their speed, they should be able to avoid the worst. The same can't be said for the slow-moving convoy.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Howe ：</span><br>
Indeed. If the Sirens were to attack, the transport fleet would be fine, but all our cargo would be lost.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Valiant ：</span><br>
Right, and given the dire situation the commander and the Northern Parliament are in, that is an unacceptable outcome.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Howe ：</span><br>
The effects of not aiding the Northern Parliament are dire as well. If the Sirens expand outwards from the Arctic Circle, they'll threaten the Royal Islands and the Eagle Union as well.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Valiant ：</span><br>
...If we cannot accomplish our mission, this entire front will collapse... Damn it...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Howe ：</span><br>
Valiant...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Valiant ：</span><br>
I've made up my mind. The main fleet will stay its course. <br>
We will stop the Sirens here, and protect the transport fleet.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Icarus ：</span><br>
Then... what about everyone in the support fleet?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Valiant ：</span><br>
We'll have them retreat to the Royal Islands. Next, we'll try to contact the Iron Blood and hope they understand that the Crimson Axis and Azur Lane shouldn't fight in front of the Sirens.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Edinburgh：</span><br>
Hopefully they can be convinced to back off...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Howe ：</span><br>
Agreed! That is the most sensible option at the moment.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Valiant ：</span><br>
There is no situation that I, Valiant, cannot resolve! First, let us put a halt to the Sirens' advance!<br>

Eagle, Hermione, this is the third time we're getting a new order...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Hermione ：</span><br>
Um, first it says, "all ships are to sail west."<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Eagle ：</span><br>
And next, "drop off the cargo at the Northern Parliament's nearest port."<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Hermione ：</span><br>
And finally, "disband the fleet?"<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Eagle ：</span><br>
That makes no sense... Are you sure this is from Naval HQ?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Jamaica：</span><br>
These are the only messages we've gotten. It doesn't make any sense.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Hermione ：</span><br>
I heard that auroras can interfere with electronic communications. Do you think something like that is going on?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Jamaica：</span><br>
It's possible... So, what are we going to do next?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Hermione ：</span><br>
Our job as the transport fleet is to make sure the cargo arrives at the intended destination safely.<br>
We have no idea if there are submarines patrolling that way, but I can say for a fact that the Iron Blood's carriers won't let us pass safely.<br>
I may not be in a position to say this, but maybe it would be best to disregard this order...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Eagle ：</span><br>
...I didn't get a response when I tried to confirm the order... However...<br>
Regardless of whether this is true or not, we have a mission from Her Majesty—<br>
—and that is to safely deliver the cargo to the Northern Parliament.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Hermione ：</span><br>
"The main fleet and supporting fleet are to turn around and fight the Iron Blood?" That has to be some kind of mistake...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Jamaica：</span><br>
Our answer should be clear then.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Eagle ：</span><br>
Yes. As a member of the Royal Navy, our top priority is to carry out the Queen's orders. Don't be fooled by this kind of disinformation.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Hermione ：</span><br>
Her Majesty would never order us to abandon the convoy. Everyone, let's continue!<br>

The Naval HQ must have received some faulty intel about the Iron Blood subs... If we had left, the entire transport fleet would've been torpedoed to hell and back.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Hermione：</span><br>
I'm glad we made the right decision. I'm going to need to have a talk to the higher-ups when we get back...!<br>
Ah! ...We've found them! Everyone, stay calm and prepare for anti-submarine combat!<br>

It seems that we meet again! Although I have no idea how you found me again...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Eagle ：</span><br>
How bold of you to show your face again after fleeing with your tail between your legs.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Hermione ：</span><br>
We're warning you... Stay away from our transport fleet, or else!<br>

There are a lot more of them waiting in the wings...! This is where we have to make our stand!<br>

What?! Great Shark just took a direct hit from a depth charge?!<br>
<span style="color:#ec5d53;">U-73：</span><br>
I'm running out of torpedoes on my end as well! They're not giving us an opening at all!<br>
<span style="color:#ec5d53;">U-522：</span><br>
All righty, looks like our mass-produced fleet is done for as well. How about we wrap things up over here?<br>
<span style="color:#ec5d53;">U81：</span><br>
I enjoyed the game of tag, but too bad there's nothing to show for it~!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Hermione ：</span><br>
Hmm... The Iron Blood submarines left the battlefield as soon as they started running out of torpedoes to launch at us...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Jamaica：</span><br>
What a long and fierce battle... No wonder why Her Majesty wants to eliminate the Iron Blood presence from these waters.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Hermione ：</span><br>
If only we were able to achieve that result...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Eagle ：</span><br>
Hopefully we won't have to deal with any more of these air raids. What's the damage report?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Hermione ：</span><br>
Some of our mass-produced ships have been damaged, but the transport fleet is unharmed.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Eagle ：</span><br>
Good. From this engagement, it is clear that the Iron Blood at least does not want to sabotage the war effort against the Sirens.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Hermione ：</span><br>
It would've been better to just let us pass through then... Ahaha...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Eagle ：</span><br>
By the way, Hermione, have you heard anything from the Naval HQ yet?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Hermione ：</span><br>
Nay... As a matter of fact, the support fleet and main fleet haven't been responding to my messages either.<br>
(It doesn't seem like the communication device is malfunctioning though... Are the messages somehow not getting relayed properly...?)<br>
(I can't do anything about it though... so all I can do is continue to press forward!)<br>

<br>
Barents Sea - Royal Navy Supporting Fleet<br>
Sheffield, Perseus, and Vampire led the support fleet in the direction of the Iron Blood's "main fleet."<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Sheffield：</span><br>
The accuracy of these long-range barrages are too low to be coming from Tirpitz. As I thought...<br>
<span style="color:#ec5d53;">Deutschland：</span><br>
Stop right there!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Sheffield：</span><br>
It's you... Deutschland...<br>
<span style="color:#ec5d53;">Deutschland：</span><br>
I must commend you for having the guts to challenge the Iron Blood's main fleet with such a meager force, but alas — guts are all that will remain of you after this.<br>
You lowly swine are not even worthy of Tirpitz's cleansing fire! I, the spiritual leader of the Iron Blood, will put you in your place!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Sheffield：</span><br>
We have no time for your prattling.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Perseus ：</span><br>
Sheffy, look out!<br>
<br>
One of Perseus's planes dove towards Deutschland, releasing a bomb at the Iron Blood ship to preempt her attack. However...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Sheffield & Perseus：</span><br>
What...?!<br>
<span style="color:#ec5d53;">Deutschland：</span><br>
Hehehe... Ahahahahaa!!<br>
Did you see that, lowly swine? This is why Iron Blood technology is the best in the world!<br>
<br>
The bomb phased through Deutschland's translucent body, and disappeared into the ocean without a trace.<br>
—But not just Deutschland. Tirpitz, the Scharnhorst sisters, and Graf Spee... The entire Iron Blood main fleet vanished as if they had never been there in the first place.<br>
In their place, only a few mass-produced ships remained...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Perseus ：</span><br>
Their fleet... disappeared?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Vampire：</span><br>
Their signals have even disappeared from the radar!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Sheffield：</span><br>
They've managed to not only deceive our radars, but also our senses... this must be the Iron Blood's newest machination...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Perseus ：</span><br>
Sheffield, your deductions ended up being accurate...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Vampire：</span><br>
The Iron Blood's main fleet was never here to begin with, so we were literally chasing shadows.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Perseus ：</span><br>
That's fair to say, given the outcome...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Sheffield：</span><br>
Bloody hell...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Vampire：</span><br>
Those mass-produced ships are real though, they're already aiming at us...!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Perseus ：</span><br>
Like rats coming out after a storm...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Vampire & Sheffield：</span><br>
...Huh?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Perseus ：</span><br>
Err, I meant, I'll go contact the other fleets. Please mop up the stragglers here.<br>

<span style="color:#ec5d53;">Prinz Eugen：</span><br>
So that's how this device works. It doesn't just listen in on transmissions, it actually "catches" them. Unbelievable.<br>
But, there are limitations to its usage. If we expand the frequency too much, it'll start interfering with our own fleets as well.<br>
<span style="color:#ec5d53;">Z2：</span><br>
Even if they catch on to what's happening, it fundamentally still serves the same purpose as jamming. So yeah, I wasn't able to pull the escort fleet away from the convoy.<br>
<span style="color:#ec5d53;">Prinz Eugen：</span><br>
So be it. Just doing that is sufficient to disrupt the "Reenactment," isn't it? In that sense, it more than does its job.<br>
<span style="color:#ec5d53;">Z2：</span><br>
......I suppose so. Just like always.<br>
<span style="color:#ec5d53;">Prinz Eugen：</span><br>
There's no need for you to think too much about these things. Hehe~<br>
<span style="color:#ec5d53;">Z2：</span><br>
So, would the great and omniscient Prinz Eugen care to tell me what happens now that they've found about our fleet projections?<br>
<span style="color:#ec5d53;">Prinz Eugen：</span><br>
Hmm... I guess we'd go to fight them now?<br>
<span style="color:#ec5d53;">Z2：</span><br>
Right, according to your mysterious battle plan that you haven't told any of us about, right?<br>
<span style="color:#ec5d53;">Prinz Eugen：</span><br>
Of course. You wouldn't want to leave poor Spee and Deutschland out there by themselves, now would you?<br>
<span style="color:#ec5d53;">Z2：</span><br>
You're unbelievable... I'll go contact the ships.<br>

<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Perseus ：</span><br>
Don't underestimate me just because I'm a light carrier. Hmph!<br>
..And that's why.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Vampire：</span><br>
After you're done dealing with the planes, we could use your help. Even though they're just mass-produced models, we're having trouble dealing with the heavy cruisers.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Perseus ：</span><br>
Sure, you got it.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Vampire：</span><br>
Good, good. It's sure nice having backup from an aircraft carrier!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Sheffield：</span><br>
We've managed to neutrallize the Iron Blood force here, but...<br>
Our communications aren't working. I suspect the problem isn't that we're not receiving messages, but rather our messages aren't getting out at all.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Vampire：</span><br>
Wasn't it working fine not too long ago?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Sheffield：</span><br>
We can't treat this like a case of mechanical failure. Someone's clearly trying to jam us.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Perseus ：</span><br>
I would've liked to say that the Iron Blood is behind it, but that doesn't seem to be the case.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Vampire：</span><br>
Look over there, it's anti-air gunfire! Someone's fighting against Siren aircraft!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Perseus ：</span><br>
It's not just planes. Mass-produced Siren ships are approaching from the north, and there's quite a lot of them!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Vampire：</span><br>
Which abyssal hellhole did they crawl out of this time...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Perseus ：</span><br>
That should be obvious. The Northern Parliament has been holding the Sirens back this whole time, so this means that the Sirens are starting to break through their defenses.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Vampire：</span><br>
In other words, you want to team up with the Iron Blood to fight back the Sirens?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Perseus ：</span><br>
...Maybe at one point. But long gone are the days when that would be possible.<br>

<span style="color:#ec5d53;">Z2：</span><br>
It seems that the Sirens have joined the fight and are assisting us in flanking the Royal Navy.<br>
Our radio equipment is barely usable over extremely short distances, but otherwise this feels just like being in a Mirror Sea. Was this a part of your calculus as well?<br>
<span style="color:#ec5d53;">Prinz Eugen：</span><br>
There's no way I'd do that~ Wouldn't we be playing right into the Sirens' "Reenactment" if we tried to use them?<br>
<span style="color:#ec5d53;">Z2：</span><br>
So what you're telling me is... You're going to give up already?<br>
...Well, so be it. Let's quickly get in touch with Admiral Hipper.<br>
<span style="color:#ec5d53;">Prinz Eugen：</span><br>
...Naturally.<br>
I've already done what I came here to do. I'll be taking everyone back home soon enough.<br>
<span style="color:#ec5d53;">Z36：</span><br>
Admiral Hipper! A large number of Siren planes are headed your way!<br>
<span style="color:#ec5d53;">Admiral Hipper：</span><br>
Damnit, my propulsion system's way too old and busted... There, that should fix it for now!<br>
<span style="color:#ec5d53;">Z36：</span><br>
We've got orders to withdraw from Eugen! Hurry it up!<br>
<span style="color:#ec5d53;">Admiral Hipper：</span><br>
Huh?! But Deutschland is still out there fighting!<br>
<span style="color:#ec5d53;">Z2：</span><br>
I understand. I'll try to get in touch with her, but we've finished the operation. Get ready to head back.<br>
<span style="color:#ec5d53;">Admiral Hipper：</span><br>
...Huh? We barely just got here, and haven't even gotten anything done! Are you sure that plan is working?<br>
<span style="color:#ec5d53;">Z2：</span><br>
Yes. The plan is still on track.<br>
<span style="color:#ec5d53;">Admiral Hipper：</span><br>
Fine. Z36, hurry up and have the mass-produced ships turn around.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Sheffield：</span><br>
The Iron Blood fleet is retreating. It's only sensible that they'd prioritize the Siren problem first.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Vampire：</span><br>
We'd both be out of here if they helped us fight back the Sirens, but what can you expect from those cowards?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Perseus ：</span><br>
They say that "yesterday's foe may be today's friend," but we seem to still be stuck in yesterday.<br>
For the time being, let's leave the Iron Blood to their devices and focus on the problem in front of us.<br>
Be careful, everyone, there's something different about these Sirens...!<br>

<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Perseus ：</span><br>
Finally... That was too close for comfort...<br>
If this is what the Northern Parliament is dealing with, no wonder they're having problems. It's insane that those Sirens are so powerful without a humanoid leader.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Vampire：</span><br>
But at least their numbers are manageable, even if it's just us.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Perseus ：</span><br>
Thankfully. If their entire fleet is this powerful... I shudder just thinking about it.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Sheffield：</span><br>
This only makes our mission that much more urgent...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Perseus ：</span><br>
...Wait! If we're fighting the Sirens right here, doesn't that mean that our transport fleet is likely to get attacked as well?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Vampire：</span><br>
Damn it! There's no way the escort fleet can protect the convoy and fight off the Sirens at the same time!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Perseus ：</span><br>
Vampire, Sheffy, we need to join up with the escort fleet as quickly as possible.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Vampire：</span><br>
Sure. If you've confirmed that the Iron Blood's main fleet has left the area, then we need to go protect the transport fleet!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Perseus ：</span><br>
It's decided then. Sheffy, let's pick up the pace!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Sheffield：</span><br>
(Deutschland and Admiral Hipper both retreated as soon as the Sirens showed up...)<br>
(It seems like they're not working together this time, but there's something bothering me about the Iron Blood's movements...)<br>
(Why did they try to lure us out here using a fake fleet if they're just going to leave without fighting?)<br>
(Whatever the reason, I must warn Her Majesty as soon as possible...)<br>

Barents Sea - Royal Navy Main Fleet<br>
Gunfire dotted the skies beneath a luminous aurora. The Royal Navy fleet that had assembled to challenge the Iron Blood had now directed their attention towards the Sirens, cutting down even the improved models one after another.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Howe ：</span><br>
Damn it... There's no end to them...!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Valiant ：</span><br>
Impossible! Has the Northern Parliament's defensive line collapsed?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Howe ：</span><br>
Calm down, Valiant! The Sirens are known to materialize out of seemingly nowhere! We will show them that the Royal Navy's main fleet is an impregnable fortress, and dash them against our ramparts!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Valiant ：</span><br>
Y-you're right! Both the Northern Parliament and these Sirens will learn what true charisma looks like!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Howe ：</span><br>
That's the spirit, Valiant! ...Wait, what's that?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Valiant ：</span><br>
Based on my intel, that should be a new humanoid Siren known as "Obstructor." Icarus, do you have any more information about it?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Icarus ：</span><br>
U-um, yes! It's a disruption-type Siren equipped with weapons that damage the electrical conduction system of our riggings. If you're hit by that weapon, you won't be able to fully deploy your armaments!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Howe ：</span><br>
How do we fight against it then?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Edinburgh：</span><br>
According to the Iceberg Stronghold report, the Northern Parliament smashed through it with overwhelming firepower!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Howe ：</span><br>
...That is something they'd do...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Edinburgh：</span><br>
Did someone say overwhelming firepower?! Coool...!<br>

Did someone say overwhelming firepower?! Coool...!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Valiant ：</span><br>
Damn it all! There's no way we'd let the Northern Parliament out-gun us!<br>

You heard her! Everyone, commence all-out assault!<br>

All weapons reloaded! All-out assault, open fire!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Valiant ：</span><br>
Haha! Well done, Icarus! That's how it's done!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Howe ：</span><br>
That seems to have worked well! Apparently, this Obstructor's defenses and maneuverability are not so high.<br>
Edinburgh, is there anything else we need to know from that Iceberg Stronghold report?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Edinburgh：</span><br>
Huh?! Let me think... Uhh...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Valiant ：</span><br>
That's the good ol' Edinburgh we know and love...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Edinburgh：</span><br>
You meanie!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Howe ：</span><br>
Sorry, I didn't mean to put you on the spot. ...Hm, Icarus, what's the matter?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Icarus ：</span><br>
Um, it's nothing! I'm probably just overthinking things again...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Valiant ：</span><br>
Never second-guess your intuition! Speak your mind, quickly!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Icarus ：</span><br>
Um, yes! I was just thinking... wasn't their firepower a bit too weak for Sirens that supposedly managed to break through the Northern Parliament's defensive line?<br>
Certainly, their overall specs are a bit higher than normal, and there were some more troublesome enemies like Obstructor, but...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Howe ：</span><br>
That is true, but...<br>
<span style="color:#ec5d53;">Communicator：</span><br>
—Took you absolute ignoramuses long enough. I was starting to get bored!<br>
Tremble!! Despair!! Cower before the face of true terror, the gaping maw of the abyss!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Icarus ：</span><br>
A voice came from the communication device?<br>
<span style="color:#ec5d53;">Communicator：</span><br>
...Damn straight. After my lengthy imprisonment, my revival must be legendary!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Edinburgh：</span><br>
I remember now! There was something written in that report about unsolicited communication coming from some channel!<br>
<span style="color:#ec5d53;">Communicator：</span><br>
Unsolicited...?! Why, you cheeky bastard!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Valiant ：</span><br>
So you're the one who's leading these Sirens?<br>
<span style="color:#ec5d53;">Communicator：</span><br>
That's right! Those foolish enough to intrude upon my domain will meet an eternal, icy demise!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Valiant ：</span><br>
What?! You're going to freeze over this entire sea...?<br>
<span style="color:#ec5d53;">Communicator：</span><br>
Ahahaha! You're a funny one! But I've brought a bunch of new toys with me today, so sit back and enjoy your final moments!<br>

Unfortunately, Jamaica's with the escort fleet. She would've been a good interpreter.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Valiant ：</span><br>
Acting all high and mighty while blathering about nonsense like that... She's giving charisma a bad name! Unforgivable!<br>

I've been waiting for you. Congratulations on breaking through those mass-produced ships.<br>
And you've had to ship out resources just to fight the new Obstructor model. Must've given you quite a bit of trouble? Ahahaha!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Howe ：</span><br>
There's no need to commit resources to clean up riffraff let through by the Northern Parliament.<br>
<span style="color:#ec5d53;">Omitter：</span><br>
Shows how little you know. We are infinite, and this is but a drop of water in the vast ocean, or a star in the endless cosmos...<br>

<span style="color:#ec5d53;">Omitter：</span><br>
In other words, what I have at my disposal is more than enough to crush you!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Valiant ：</span><br>
Looks like you're the only leader here.<br>
<span style="color:#ec5d53;">Omitter：</span><br>
I AM the fleet! How dare you look down upon me, you midget ass!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Valiant ：</span><br>
Midget?! ...Edinburgh, this was the one who was at the Iceberg Stronghold, right?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Edinburgh：</span><br>
Eh? Um, uhh... based upon her appearances and the characteristics of her rigging...<br>
(Think, Edinburgh! I've read the report before, but I can't just drag up those kinds of details all of a sudden... Come on, Edinburgh, prove to everyone that you're just as capable as Bel...!)<br>
"Obstructor, high level attack-type Siren, presumably sharing the same level of command as Purifier. Is capable of launching Siren torpedoes and has firepower equal to or greater than Siren battleships. Recommended to target with concentrated firepower to deter the use of torpedoes and shelling attacks, as well as interfere with her ability to attack electronic communications systems."<br>
"Furthermore, we observed no use for the massive cannon equipped on her back during the Stronghold operation. Its purpose is currently unknown, but we speculate that it is used for intimidation purposes only."<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Icarus ：</span><br>
Th-that huge thing on her back isn't a cannon...?<br>
(I'm glad it's not some powerful secret weapon, but that's a bit of a let-down...)<br>
(Ahhhhhh!! Just what am I thinking about?! Ahaha...)<br>
<span style="color:#ec5d53;">Omitter：</span><br>
In-intimidation purposes only?!<br>
SCREW YOU, SHITHEADS!!!!!<br>
Now you've done it... You've gone and pissed me off... If you want to die so badly, then I will give it to you—<br>
Choke on your own despair! Rot in hell! I'll rip you apart until nothing's left except your data!!<br>

The fierce confrontation against Omitter raged on. Her torpedoes, cannon barrages, and electronic interference were just as the report had described. However...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Howe ：</span><br>
A beam weapon...?!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Icarus ：</span><br>
Woah... It's so colourful...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Howe ：</span><br>
We underestimated her... Valiant, are you still alive over there?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Valiant ：</span><br>
Somehow... Taking a hit from her head-on hurts like hell though! Icarus, Edinburgh, and those of you with light armor, stand back!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Edinburgh & Icarus：</span><br>
Understood!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Valiant ：</span><br>
(How is there an enemy this strong...?! She hits even harder than Warspite...)<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Howe ：</span><br>
Just exchanging shells with her is already difficult enough. I've got to find some way of disabling that beam weapon.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Valiant ：</span><br>
Disabling her beam weapon... Howe, you don't mean...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Howe ：</span><br>
Yes, we've got to destroy that main cannon!<br>
Can you keep up with me, Valiant?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Valiant ：</span><br>
Hmph! Who do you take me for? The charismatic Valiant only leads, never follows!<br>
Hear me, main fleet of the Royal Navy's convoy operation! Follow my lead!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Howe ：</span><br>
Upon this sword I swear, glory to Her Majesty!<br>

<span style="color:#ec5d53;">Omitter：</span><br>
Where'd all that bravado from earlier go? Are you rats only capable of scurrying around?! Ahahahaha!!<br>
<br>
Valiant and Howe dodged and weaved between Omitter's attacks, ruination flashing all around them as they waited for a single decisive moment.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Howe ：</span><br>
Cannonfire, torpedo barrage, beam weapon... then repeat...<br>
...I see it! After launching her beam weapon, she stops for a moment to recharge!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Valiant ：</span><br>
In a game of chess, sometimes the king must move before the other pieces follow... In that case, I'll be the decoy!<br>
<span style="color:#ec5d53;">Omitter：</span><br>
...Oh? Are you admitting defeat? Why'd you suddenly stop moving?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Valiant ：</span><br>
You might be a rotten bastard, but I'll admit that I underestimated you. You really are a high-ranking Siren.<br>
<span style="color:#ec5d53;">Omitter：</span><br>
Rotten? The only one who's going to rot is you. But it seems like you've already recognized that.<br>
In any case, I've already collected the data I need, so let's make this quick—<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Valiant ：</span><br>
Don't think you've won just yet...!<br>
<br>
At the last possible moment, Valiant barely managed to evade the path of the devastating beam, and—<br>
<span style="color:#ec5d53;">Omitter：</span><br>
Oh, did I miss? That's a pity, but let's try that again—<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Valiant ：</span><br>
Now's your chance, Howe! Don't let her finish charging!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Howe ：</span><br>
You're mine!<br>
<span style="color:#ec5d53;">Omitter：</span><br>
What?!<br>
<br>
Haaaaaaaaaah!!!<br>
<span style="color:#ec5d53;">Omitter：</span><br>
Was that midget using herself as bait... Gah?!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Valiant：</span><br>
You Siren scum are always going on and on about "pieces," but Valiant shall instruct you on how to turn a pawn into a queen!<br>
<br>
Before Omitter could finish charging her weapon, Howe plunged her blade deep into the Siren's rigging.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Howe：</span><br>
You're finished, Siren!<br>
<span style="color:#ec5d53;">Omitter：</span><br>
How... could this be?! I'm explodinggggggraaahhhhh!!!!!<br>
<br>
The energy stored within Omitter's rigging burst outwards violently, causing a massive explosion that erased all traces of the Siren and her equipment.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Howe ：</span><br>
*cough* *cough*...Let's... just go back to exchanging fire next time... Valiant?!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Valiant ：</span><br>
Don't worry, she only took out one of my guns. Simple enough to get it repaired once we return home, so it's no big deal.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Icarus ：</span><br>
Her signal disappeared from the radar... There are only a few stragglers left!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Howe ：</span><br>
All right. Let's clean up the remaining enemies.<br>

<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Icarus ：</span><br>
Oh no, everyone! The aurora...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Howe ：</span><br>
After defeating the Sirens, the aurora faded all of a sudden... Oh, maybe our communications system will also be restored?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Icarus ：</span><br>
Yes! I've confirmed that transmissions are coming in—<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Communicator：</span><br>
—This is the Royal Island Naval HQ. Do you copy?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Howe ：</span><br>
Phew... After all that, I'd like a device that can counteract Siren jamming, just like the Northern Parliament...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Communicator：</span><br>
This is Warspite. Main fleet, the mission is called off! Hurry and come back right now!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Howe ：</span><br>
Called off...? But Warspite, weren't we going to get the commander...?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Communicator：</span><br>
That's not important right now. The main fleet and the support fleet are to immediately change courses and return to the Royal Islands. The convoy has already safely arrived at the Northern Parliament.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Valiant ：</span><br>
What the hell is going on now... Howe, pass me the communicator.<br>
Warspite, this is Valiant. What happened at Scapa Flow?!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Communicator：</span><br>
The Barents Sea operation thinned our defenses at Scapa Flow, and we were ambushed by the Iron Blood.<br>
To make matters worse, that's where Belfast and Her Majesty were headed...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Valiant ：</span><br>
Elizabeth...?! Why did they decide to go to Scapa Flow all of a sudden...?!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Communicator：</span><br>
I don't know the exact situation, but our forces there are still locked in combat. You should immediately turn around and reinforce them as soon as possible!<br>
I'm already on my way there. See you at Scapa Flow.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Valiant ：</span><br>
...I've never heard Warspite this serious before...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Howe ：</span><br>
The Iron Blood pinned us here while they ambushed Scapa Flow...<br>
If the escort fleet has already arrived safely, then there's no reason for us to be here anymore. Everyone, turn around and join up with Perseus's group.<br>
(Please, Your Majesty, may we make it in time...)<br>

<br>
Countless spears of ice reach up from the ocean as if lifted by an external force, forming a massive structure that claws at the clouds.<br>
That is the "Crown" of the Northern Parliament, the singularity that serves as one of the largest Siren bases in the Arctic Circle.<br>
And around it stand the guardians of humanity who continue to push back against the inexhaustible waves of Sirens materialized from that base.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Chapayev：</span><br>
Soyuz's personal desires aside, haven't we kept the commander for a bit too long? One of their escort fleets will probably come knocking on our doors soon.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Tashkent：</span><br>
Is that so? I don't really care either way... Well, maybe a little...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Avrora：</span><br>
That would be rather inopportune for us. After all, we've managed closer to the "Crown" thanks to the commander.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Sovetskaya Rossiya：</span><br>
Indeed. If we don't crush the Siren bases one by one, we are the ones who will be destroyed in the end. What we need is total war, not just holding the line.<br>
I'm sorry, Commander, but can we count on your assistance once more, just like back then with the Iceberg Stronghold?<br>
<br>
The war situation in the Northern Parliament is one of the most harrowing things I've ever seen. But this was also the moment they needed me the most.<br>
Then, as the person entrusted with leading them to victory, perhaps I...<br>
<br>

<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Queen Elizabeth：</span><br>
There are few things more glorious than watching our prized fleet sail off to battle. Wouldn't you agree, Bel?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Belfast：</span><br>
Indeed. May your operation bear rich fruit, Your Majesty.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Queen Elizabeth：</span><br>
There's no way the Iron Blood wouldn't take the bait! ...Anyway, Belfast, I'll trust you to hold this point. Don't let anyone through!<br>
Also, please notify me if there are any updates from Sheffield.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Belfast：</span><br>
Yes, Your Majesty.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Sheffield：</span><br>
You'll be waiting for me at Scapa Flow?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Queen Elizabeth：</span><br>
That's right! After you get back from the Northern Parliament, I want you to bring the commander to Scapa Flow, along with "that."<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Sheffield：</span><br>
As you will.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Queen Elizabeth：</span><br>
("The remnants of the past swallowed by the waves, the hypothesis born from falsehood" ...Has the Iron Blood been a step ahead of us this entire time?)<br>
(I've got to work faster too... What a pain... There's no telling what the Vichya... No, that Iron Blood battleship...)<br>
(She shouldn't exist in that form. Her hull, her fate... should've ended here at Scapa Flow, along with all those other Iron Blood and Royal Navy ships.)<br>
(If so... what does she now represent that gives her such a form? Is it an edification of a lost past... or the future of an untested hypothesis...?<br>
<br>
KABOOM——!!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Belfast：</span><br>
Your Majesty, it's an ambush from the Iron Blood's main fleet! Please evacuate at once!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Queen Elizabeth：</span><br>
The Iron Blood's main fleet?! Here? Not at the Barents Sea?!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Belfast：</span><br>
Perhaps our communication channel has been compromised. In any case, I don't have much time, so please find somewhere safe right away!<br>
<span style="color:#ec5d53;">Deutschland：</span><br>
Where do you think you're going, shorty queen?<br>
At long last, we're here! The truth that you've hidden from the Iron Blood for so long... shall now be ours!<br>
If you don't want to meet your watery grave here, then you'd better run as quickly as you can!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Queen Elizabeth：</span><br>
Bel, how many enemies are there?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Belfast：</span><br>
My apologies, but our command structure is in a state of disarray due to the surprise attack. However, I'd estimate that there are at least two more battleships here—<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Queen Elizabeth：</span><br>
(They've really brought their entire fleet here... How is this possible...?)<br>
...Hmph. You're just a pocket battleship. Lower your head when addressing the Queen!<br>
If you're not prepared to kneel in my presence, then get out of my sight!<br>
...Bel, we're breaking through!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Belfast：</span><br>
Understood, Your Majesty.<br>

Malta Island - Banquet Venue<br>
A certain ship was supposed to attend a joint banquet hosted by the Royal Navy and Iris Libre—<br>
<span style="color:#ffd000;">Littorio：</span><br>
Enjoying fine tea overlooking the Méditerranée, and even finer ladies... Ah, how long it's been since I've indulged in a Royal Navy banquet.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Illustrious：</span><br>
I'm glad our event is to your liking.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Richelieu：</span><br>
Thank you for attending, Littorio.<br>
<span style="color:#ffd000;">Littorio：</span><br>
The pleasure is mine, Cardinal. I've heard that the Church of the Iris Orthodoxy has blossomed once more under your leadership. Congratulations.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Richelieu：</span><br>
As a member of Azur Lane, Iris Libre will continue to fight against the Sirens. As for Sardegna...<br>
<span style="color:#ffd000;">Littorio：</span><br>
Well, Veneto and I are working hard to change things, but you know how the Senate is. Nothing's going to happen overnight unfortunately.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Richelieu：</span><br>
Is that so... Then, after this banquet is over... we'll go back to being enemies again.<br>
<span style="color:#ffd000;">Littorio：</span><br>
Thanks for the warning. I wouldn't want to get attacked at night by the woman who stole my heart... Or would I? Hehe~<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Illustrious：</span><br>
Oh dear...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Unicorn：</span><br>
Big sister?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Illustrious：</span><br>
What's the matter, Unicorn?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Unicorn：</span><br>
There's a message from the headquarters...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Illustrious：</span><br>
From headquarters? I suppose it's fine if Littorio hears it. What's it about?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Unicorn：</span><br>
All right... <br>
Um, Her Majesty is in an extremely desperate situation after being ambushed by the Iron Blood fleet at Scapa Flow...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Illustrious：</span><br>
No...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Richelieu：</span><br>
Queen Elizabeth...! We can't just sit here...<br>
<span style="color:#ffd000;">Littorio：</span><br>
What is the Iron Blood doing there...? This is going to turn the rules of engagement on its head again...<br>

<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Saratoga：</span><br>
Enterprise, Washington! I just heard the news...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Enterprise：</span><br>
Yes. I've pieced together what happened. It seems like the Iron Blood was targeting Scapa Flow this whole time.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Saratoga：</span><br>
What could they possibly be after? There's not even a base over there...<br>
I wonder what's going to happen with the Royal Navy...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Washington：</span><br>
It's hard to read what the Iron Blood is planning. Are they trying to expand south, or perhaps...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Saratoga：</span><br>
That's way over Sister Sara's head...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Enterprise：</span><br>
For now, just stay alert. Contact all our ships, and be on the lookout for enemy attacks.<br>

<br>
At the Northern Parliament<br>
<span style="color:#ffd000;">Sovetsky Soyuz：</span><br>
The Sirens hoped to cut off our supply convoy during that last attack. Fortunately, the Royal Navy's escort fleet cleared the way.<br>
Officially, the Royal Navy's operation ended in failure... and they were savagely defeated by the Iron Blood...<br>
<span style="color:#ffd000;">Sovetskaya Rossiya：</span><br>
The movements of the Iron Blood and the Sirens were too synchronized. Don't believe it's a coincidence for a second.<br>
<span style="color:#ffd000;">Sovetsky Soyuz：</span><br>
However, the arrival of the convoy has improved the situation in the Baltic Sea. The relief supplies have been distributed appropriately.<br>
<span style="color:#ffd000;">Sovetskaya Rossiya：</span><br>
The front lines received the bulk of the aid. We're also starting to repair the damaged transports.<br>
<span style="color:#ffd000;">Sovetsky Soyuz：</span><br>
This success was made possible by the bravery of everyone in the transport operation. We will sing their names as heroes.<br>
<span style="color:#ffd000;">Sovetskaya Rossiya：</span><br>
As expected, the Iron Blood would not dare sabotage the supplies needed to fight the Sirens.<br>
<span style="color:#ffd000;">Sovetsky Soyuz：</span><br>
Without the commander's leadership, we would not have seized victory without devastating losses...<br>
There is no longer any reason to doubt the commander's importance. The Royal Navy seems to also be focusing on other issues at the moment.<br>
As such, the commander is no longer in a position to refuse requests to stay with us.<br>
We've finished our assessment. It's time to move on to the next phase.<br>
Perhaps, it is time to show our new comrade what we found in the frigid ocean...<br>
