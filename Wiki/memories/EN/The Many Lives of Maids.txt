<br>
The Maid on Her Last Legs<br>
I'd wrapped up the day's work and decided to pay a leisurely visit to the Royal Navy's teahouse in port.<br>
Apparently, Vanguard was helping out around the store as part of the teahouse's maid trial program. Maybe I'll get to see her, I thought to myself.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Vanguard：</span><br>
...Oh.<br>
Wouldn't you know it, there she was. We made eye contact.<br>
Wh-why are you here, Commander? Err, excuse me, I forgot to say the line...<br>
Ahem... "Welcome back, M-Master."<br>
<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项1："Your delivery could use some work..."</span>'''''<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项2："Hey, that wasn't half-bad."</span>'''''<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Vanguard：</span><br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项1）</span>'''''You're not the first to say that...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Vanguard：</span><br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项2）</span>'''''I'm honoured. Thank you. Assuming you mean it, anyway...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Vanguard：</span><br>
*sigh*... I'm so not cut out to be a maid. Who thought putting me on this programme was a good idea...<br>
I'd just sat down to have a break since there were no customers, and then you show up.<br>
Oh well... What would you like to order? I'll tell the kitchen staff to ready up.<br>
<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项1："You're cutting your break short?"</span>'''''<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Vanguard：</span><br>
Well, yes? People would be right mad if they caught a Royal Knight slacking around the Commander.<br>
I guess I could have my break after you've ordered something. Not like anyone could complain then.<br>
So, what will it be? I can recommend the house's scones and a glass of orange juice.<br>
<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项3："I'll have that, then."</span>'''''<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项4："I'm not really sure what I want."</span>'''''<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Vanguard：</span><br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项3）</span>'''''Great, thanks. I know everyone raves about the tea, but our freshly squeezed orange juice is quite good as well.<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项3）</span>'''''I'll be back in a minute. Just kick back and get comfy.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Vanguard：</span><br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项4）</span>'''''A cup of tea then, as always?<br>
<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项1："Hmm..."</span>'''''<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Vanguard：</span><br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项1）</span>'''''Ugh... "Thank you for ordering, Master. We'll have your stargazy pie ready soon."<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项1）</span>'''''"Please make yourself at home until then. I'll be back shortly."<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Vanguard：</span><br>
"Thank you for your patience. Here is your order. Bon appétit."<br>
Oops. Brain got stuck in maid mode there. Enjoy your meal while I go lie on the sofa in the next room over.<br>
<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项1："How's the maid program treating you?"</span>'''''<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Vanguard：</span><br>
I told you before, I'm NOT cut out for this bloody job. "It's great stress relief," they said... Yeah, right, my stress is going through the roof here!<br>
Hats off to the Royal Maids who do this every day. I'd go mental if I had to.<br>
God, I need something to unwind from these past few days... Do me a favour and let me sortie tomorrow, Commander.<br>
<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项5："Consider it done."</span>'''''<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项6："You're almost through with this. Hang in there."</span>'''''<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Vanguard：</span><br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项5）</span>'''''Awesome! I knew you'd show compassion!<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项5）</span>'''''Just need to get through today, then I'll finally get to vent some steam!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Vanguard：</span><br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项6）</span>'''''You're kidding, right?<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项6）</span>'''''I mean... If you really enjoy having me as a maid, then I guess I'll bear with it...<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项6）</span>'''''Don't expect me to put on this uniform too frequently, though.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Vanguard：</span><br>
...Anyway, the sofa's calling! I'm going to have my break now. Take your time and enjoy the food.<br>

<br>
The Maid with the Distaste<br>
It was just before closing time at Scharlachroter Tresen – the Iron Blood's café.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ägir：</span><br>
What? Who's visiting this late in the– Oh! It's you.<br>
W-welcome back, Mast– Ah, forget it! I'm not doing it. So, what's brought you here?<br>
Ägir greeted me at the entrance. Her new uniform took me very much by surprise...<br>
What are you gawking at? Does my outfit offend you?<br>
Or is it the fact I'm lying down? I'll have you know I'm enjoying a break after cleaning all day.<br>
...Y-you're just surprised by how good I look? Well, thanks...<br>
That aside! I assume you want to order something. You're lucky we're still open a while longer.<br>
So, I'm listening.<br>
Let's hear your order. If it's on the menu, I'll have it done in a flash.<br>
<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项1："I'll have a beer."</span>'''''<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项2："File my paperwork, thanks."</span>'''''<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ägir：</span><br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项1）</span>'''''Everyone's favorite. As you wish.<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项1）</span>'''''Wait right here. This will just take a second... unless I fumble.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ägir：</span><br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项2）</span>'''''Excuse me? That's work fit for a secretary, not a maid.<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项2）</span>'''''Even if I say "sure," there's no guarantee I'll do a good–<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项2）</span>'''''Wait a damned minute! That's not even an item on the menu!<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项2）</span>'''''For god's sake... Stick to what's on it, or I won't bother with you.<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项2）</span>'''''If you really need documents sorted, ask me again after I've finished my job here.<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项2）</span>'''''Tell you what, I know something you'll like – I'll pour a glass of that.<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项2）</span>'''''Wait right here. This will just take a second... unless I fumble.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ägir：</span><br>
Here's your drink. Get comfortable and take your time. If that'll be all, I'll be over here resting on this couch.<br>
I sat down with my drink, but held off on sipping it. I could feel Ägir's gaze on me...<br>
<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项1："How's your maid work been going?"</span>'''''<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ägir：</span><br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项1）</span>'''''What do you think? It's child's play for me! No trouble at all...<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项1）</span>'''''...You know what, let's not kid ourselves. It's obvious I'm not in my element.<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项1）</span>'''''August persuaded me into this, insisting it would be "a pleasant role reversal."<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项1）</span>'''''That may be right up her alley, but I feel a fervent distaste toward being ordered around as a maid!<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项1）</span>'''''I'll stop myself now before I grumble myself hoarse. This will all be over once you leave anyway.<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项1）</span>'''''Then I can close the book on this humiliating chapter of my life and go back to being myself again.<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项1）</span>'''''Ägir subjected me to a short rant, which wasn't very pleasant on the ears. On the bright side, the drink she poured for me was excellent.<br>

The Maid in the Night Mood<br>
Prinz Eugen invited me to visit her at a hillside café with a gorgeous view.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Prinz Eugen：</span><br>
Right on time, Commander.<br>
Guten Abend~ How do you like the view? Pretty good, am I right?<br>
Silly, I'm talking about the skyline, not myself. Heehee~<br>
Now... What would you like to order?<br>
<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项1："Come again?"</span>'''''<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Prinz Eugen：</span><br>
Come on, can't you take a hint? Look at me. I'm your personal maid for tonight.<br>
Got to act the part, you know?<br>
Why the surprised look? Let me guess – you don't think my uniform looks very maid-like?<br>
Or is the view so incredible you just forgot all about the girl in front of you?<br>
Aww, that hurts. I get into character and pick out nice clothes, and you ignore me?<br>
Heehee. I'm just teasing you. I know you're not one to neglect your partner on a date.<br>
So, let's start over. What would you like to order, mein Schatz? If you're in a wine mood, I can fetch the house special.<br>
<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项1："Sounds good."</span>'''''<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Prinz Eugen：</span><br>
I thought you'd say that.<br>
She took out a bottle sat ready behind the counter and poured a glass of wine for each of us.<br>
Let's have a toast. To you, and to this beautiful night. Prost!<br>
We gently clanged our glasses together and then had a sip from our glasses.<br>
You can't chug wine like you chug beer, but that's fine. This night calls for a drink you can savor.<br>
Oh, seems we've emptied our glasses already. Want a refill? I'm thirsty for more.<br>
It was then that I remembered Eugen has a slight drinking problem.<br>
Heehee... I know what you're thinking. It's written on your face.<br>
Puh-leeease. I can hold my liquor. Let's not spoil the mood by counting glasses.<br>
Besides, the night is still young~<br>
Whew... I'm tellin' ya. Bismarck, me, everyone's changed so much since we took up post here~<br>
An' you know who's to blame? Yeah, you – for making us all feel so whole and stuff~<br>
You've given me somethin' I can't ever be without again... *hic*... I'm addicted to you, mein Schatz. You'll always be here for me, won'tcha?<br>
She was officially drunk as a fish. It had gotten pretty late as well. Letting her have any more would've been a bad idea.<br>
<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项1："Come on, Eugen. It's time to go."</span>'''''<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Prinz Eugen：</span><br>
Aww, alreadyyy? I was just gettin' started!<br>
Waait... Heehee, I get it now! We'll go someplace else then drink some more~ That's whatcha mean, right? Sillyyy, you could've just said it. Be straight to the point, like me!<br>
<br>
She'd clearly had too much already. I gave her a hand and led her back to the dorm...<br>
