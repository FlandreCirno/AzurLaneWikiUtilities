Sirius' Improvement Plan<br>
<br>
Chapter 1 - A Maid Must...<br>
Port - Office<br>
Owing to some strange turn of events, Belfast introduced me to the Maid Fleet's chief bodyguard, Sirius, and I selected her to be my secretary.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Sirius：</span><br>
I am here to support you from this day onwards, my honourable Master.<br>
If there is anything at all that I can help with, please tell me. Though I am not as talented as Belfast, I shall do my absolute best to meet your expectations.<br>
<br>
I tried giving this cool-looking and diligent maid an assignment, but...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Sirius：</span><br>
......?<br>
Sirius tilted her head sideways like she didn't understand what I said.<br>
Are you... asking for yesterday's exercise reports?<br>
My sincerest apologies... I thought you had already finished reading them yesterday, so I disposed of them...<br>
I-I shall locate them at once!<br>
<br>
Sirius hurriedly got on her knees and began digging through an old pile of papers.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Sirius：</span><br>
Pardon the interruption, Master, but... what would you like me to clean first?<br>
I'm truly sorry, but I have always gotten my fellow maids to brew tea on my behalf, so I have never done it myself...<br>
<br>
I have no complaints about your skill as a bodyguard, but as help around the office, I can't say the same...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Sirius：</span><br>
I do apologise. Not only am I unable to fully carry out my duties as a secretary, I've even wasted your highly valuable time, my honourable Master...<br>
Please... Please teach this naughty maid some proper manners!<br>
<br>
Sirius lowered her head and began profusely apologizing.<br>
Seeing her like this made me want to repay her for all her hard work in some way.<br>

Sirius' Improvement Plan<br>
<br>
Chapter 2 - Her Majesty's Orders<br>
In the midst of my pondering on how to thank Sirius for her efforts...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Queen Elizabeth：</span><br>
I hereby command all my subjects to be in attendance at our next banquet to strengthen cross-faction ties!<br>
Everyone must bring a partner with them! As for me, I will have Warspite as my escort!<br>
...Be there! That is an order!<br>
<br>
And so, Her Tiny Majesty gave me a direct order to attend the banquet.<br>
I've heard that the banquet will be very formal, and apparently we must dance with our partners...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Sirius：</span><br>
I am here, please rest assured, my honourable Master.<br>
...I must dress appropriately for the banquet? Is my maid uniform inadequate...?<br>
...However, I believe that the more I stand out in a crowd, the lower the risk is of you being targeted, Master. Therefore, it's in your best interest that I attend the banquet in my regular maid uniform.<br>
<br>
True, I guess showing to a banquet wearing that would make you really stick out...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Sirius：</span><br>
Do you mean... attend the banquet as your partner?<br>
Although I would be much obliged, I believe it would be considered inappropriate for you to bring a lowly maid as your partner, my honourable Master.<br>
Furthermore, either Belfast or Curacoa would be superior choices, as I have never attended a public event as a guest before...<br>
<br>
Even so, I'll accept the risk and choose you to be my partner.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Sirius：</span><br>
Do you mean that... I can protect both Her Majesty and you at the same time, my honourable Master?<br>
Oh, my apologies! I was unable to infer the meaning of your statement and I made a senseless remark...<br>
Please, give this incompetent maid her due punishment!<br>
<br>
In reality, I want this banquet to serve as a learning experience for her, but let's go with this version of the story for now.<br>

Sirius' Improvement Plan<br>
<br>
Chapter 3 - The Maids' Aid<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Belfast：</span><br>
To be able to blend in among the crowd at the banquet, there is a need for Sirius to understand precisely what a maid's duties are and how a maid should behave.<br>
In addition, now that Sirius have been selected for the assignment, there is a need to improve on her ability to serve as a secretary.<br>
...Is this an accurate summary of your request, Master?<br>
<br>
I went to the Royal Navy Maids and requested their guidance on Sirius.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Sirius：</span><br>
I humbly request your gentle treatment, Belfast.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Belfast：</span><br>
Although ordinary maid business has never been Sirius' job, this is a special case.<br>
For this instance, don't worry about the tasks you are usually assigned; let's all take turns explaining.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Sirius：</span><br>
Very well. If it's for my Master's sake, I'll do anything...!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Curlew：</span><br>
First, we will have to teach you proper etiquette.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Curacoa：</span><br>
Well, I say there's no need to be overly formal, so let's instead start by teaching her the dos and don'ts, shall we?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Sheffield：</span><br>
When cleaning the Commander's office, you should start with cleaning the shelves, not sweep the floor, as it is easier that way.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Belette & Sirius：</span><br>
I see. That will come handy in the future.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Kent：</span><br>
Emm, I don't think there's anything special that Contestant Kent can teach you.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Suffolk：</span><br>
Maybe I could teach you how to skip work without Belfast finding out about it?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Belfast：</span><br>
...I would be quite interested in knowing how you do so.<br>
<br>
......<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Sirius：</span><br>
...I feel I have become aware of just how much I don't know...<br>
<br>
Looks like Sirius is getting closer to becoming a made maid.<br>

Sirius' Improvement Plan<br>
<br>
Chapter 4 - Big Seven Advice<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Sirius：</span><br>
Nelson, Rodney, please share your insight with me.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Nelson：</span><br>
I don't know how useful our advice would be, but we could maybe teach you something.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Rodney：</span><br>
Nelson? Please, the Commander directly asked us for help, so we should take this seriously.<br>
<br>
I decided to ask Nelson and Rodney on Sirius' behalf for advice on how to behave at a formal banquet.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Nelson：</span><br>
Then for starters... let's get an idea of the situation. What's the status of your preparations for the banquet?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Sirius：</span><br>
Her Majesty will have Lady Warspite for protection, so my plan thus far is to be the Master's bodyguard instead.<br>
I have done a general background check on all of the attendees, and my survey of the perimeter's defences and emergency escape routes is 90% complete.<br>
Lastly, I've prepared various banquet items for the Master, installed a communications device in the Master's car, prepared spare clothing, and prepared antiemetic medicine.<br>
<br>
I guess the maids' advice was useful to Sirius, seeing as she prepared an extra set of clothes and some anti-nausea medicine.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Nelson：</span><br>
H-huh, I see... You've prepared for just about everything...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Sirius：</span><br>
If there is anything I may have not accounted for, please do let me know.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Rodney：</span><br>
Um, Nelson... I think we should probably start with teaching her the basics of attending a banquet.<br>
That should be everything. Oh, right, I nearly forgot to ask an important question: do you have a dress prepared?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Sirius：</span><br>
I've... Um...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Nelson：</span><br>
Figures... You should go ask Illustrious or Akashi. You're basically already wearing a dress, so they might be able to get you a new one right away.<br>
<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项1：Support Nelson's proposal</span>'''''<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Sirius：</span><br>
Nelson, Master, you have my sincerest thanks for all of your help!<br>
<br>
...You could say that again. Nelson and Rodney were a huge help.<br>

Sirius' Improvement Plan<br>
<br>
Chapter 5 - Take My Hand<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Aurora：</span><br>
Now you turn around like this... Then move like this...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Sirius：</span><br>
Like... so?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Aurora：</span><br>
Yes, you've got it! Now you should have no problem practicing with an actual partner.<br>
<br>
I got Aurora to teach Sirius the dance we'll have at the banquet.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Sirius：</span><br>
My honourable Master, I kindly ask of you to join me and help me practice this dance.<br>
Sirius, my all-in-one banquet partner, secretary, and personal maid elegantly reached her hand out to me.<br>
<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项1：Take Sirius' hand</span>'''''<br>
<br>
She hadn't quite nailed it yet, but she'd improved remarkably in such a short amount of time.<br>
Then, as we were practicing the dance, she suddenly started whispering to me.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Sirius：</span><br>
...I am truly thankful for all of your help.<br>
Though I am a mere maid, you have been so kind to me...<br>
I know that this is far outside my jurisdiction as a maid, but nevertheless...<br>
<br>
(Boing)<br>
...I guess the wave of emotion made one of us miss a step, and now I felt the sensation of something heavy yet soft pressing against me.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Sirius：</span><br>
...My honourable Master, I...<br>
Oh my goodness, I am so sorry! I... Um...<br>
<br>
For just a single moment, Sirius' expression turned bright red as our faces were mere inches away.<br>

Sirius' Improvement Plan<br>
<br>
Chapter 6 - Banquet Panic<br>
It was now the day of the banquet.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Queen Elizabeth：</span><br>
My word, I can't believe it!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Warspite：</span><br>
Can't believe what, Your Majesty?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Queen Elizabeth：</span><br>
That! Isn't that Sirius, one of our Royal Maids...?<br>
<br>
I can see why Her Majesty would be surprised. Sirius' banquet dress makes her look so refined that you might mistake her for someone else entirely.<br>
Of course, we also have the Royal Maids, Nelson, Rodney, and Aurora to thank for their guidance.<br>
In the end, it's because of Sirius' hard work that we look perfectly presentable at the banquet... Actually, I'd go as far as saying we're the most presentable couple in attendance.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Sirius：</span><br>
Now I shall be your partner for the dance, just as you requested.<br>
It is my hope that you will see the fruits of my endeavors.<br>
Now then, my honourable Master, shall we dance?<br>
<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项1：Take Sirius' hand</span>'''''<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Warspite：</span><br>
Your Majesty! Siren planes have been sighted approaching from the shoreline!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Queen Elizabeth：</span><br>
Hah! They've got guts to dare disrupt a banquet with me in attendance! Mobilise the maids and eliminate the enemy at once!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Sirius：</span><br>
...I believe the quickest route should be through here.<br>
How do you feel, my honourable Master?<br>
<br>
In that moment, I remembered why I wanted Sirius to attend this banquet: to reward her for all her hard work, and to let her shine.<br>
And being a bodyguard and the most proficient fighter of all the maids, if there's one thing she shines at, it would have to be...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Sirius：</span><br>
Understood, my honourable Master.<br>
...Then as you command, I shall shine as bright as my namesake star.<br>

Sirius' Improvement Plan<br>
<br>
Chapter 7 - Like The Brightest Star<br>
The fight was over in a matter of minutes.<br>
As soon as the Sirens had made their appearance, they were promptly turned into little more than wrecks.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Queen Elizabeth：</span><br>
What rubbish! They stole the limelight from my Home Fleet!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Warspite：</span><br>
There is no need to mobilise the Home Fleet to fight mere planes, Your Majesty... At any rate, this was a victory for the Royal Navy, so wouldn't you agree this is a splendid outcome?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Queen Elizabeth：</span><br>
Hmph!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Warspite：</span><br>
...I must admit, the anti-air capabilities of the Dido-class are a marvel to behold.<br>
Or perhaps this fine display of skill was only possible thanks to your swift decision back there, Commander?<br>
<br>
That decision I made in the banquet hall came from my trust in Sirius and the knowledge that if anyone could do it, it would be her.<br>
And that decision turned out to be right. That's all there's to it.<br>
And so, Sirius, donning her white rose dress, made her triumphant return.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Sirius：</span><br>
My honourable Master, I have cleared the path so that you may move forward.<br>
Silently and elegantly, she reached her hand out to me.<br>
No matter the attire I may wear, I will always be your maid, doing everything in her power to fulfil your wishes.<br>
Were it your wish, I would more brightly and magnificently than anyone else.<br>
Whether on the dance floor of a banquet or in the clouds of smoke on the battlefield, please allow this humble servant of yours to be your partner now and forever.<br>
<br>
Like a polished diamond resting in the snow, she was gleaming, and so utterly beautiful.<br>
