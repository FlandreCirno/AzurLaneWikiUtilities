<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Lexington II：</span><br>
Hum dededee dum♪<br>
Huh? Welcome back, Comma – umm, I mean, my Master!<br>
The first morning breeze ushers me into the open doors of Lexington's manor.<br>
The owner of the manor is dressed in a light and fluffy maid outfit.<br>
Hehe, you look stunned. Never seen me dressed like this before, have you?<br>
I guess dressing up as maids is all the rage at port these days. It piqued my interest, so I just had to try it!<br>
Playing a different role once in a while is part of the spice of everyday life, don't you think?<br>
That said, my cleaning is kind of clumsy. My lack of experience is really showing.<br>
I need your help, Master, to help me grow into my role as a capable maid.<br>
She scoots over on her knees. Her lacy skirt sways gracefully along with her.<br>
There's an excited smile on her face as she looks up at me.<br>
<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项1：Let's clean together.</span>'''''<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项2：I'll do my best to be a good teacher.</span>'''''<br>

<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Lexington II：</span><br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项1）</span>'''''Hooray! You're too kind to me, Master.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">{playername}：</span><br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项2）</span>'''''I'll do my best to be a good teacher.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Lexington II：</span><br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项2）</span>'''''Hehe, then I'd better be a student you can be proud of!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Lexington II：</span><br>
So, shall we begin with this mirror right here?<br>
Mm... No matter how much I wipe here, I can't get this smudge off. Am I not putting enough force into it?<br>
Master, let's get it spick and span together.<br>
When you're wiping things, you need to know just how much force is needed. Otherwise, it won't get clean.<br>
Okay, here goes! Heave-ho!<br>
It's hard to tell if she's learning from me or if I'm the one obeying her, but regardless, we work closely together to clean the mirror.<br>
Our clothes touch at times, rhythmically rubbing against each other. The giant mirror squeaks and creaks from all the wiping.<br>
Our reflections ripple like on the water's surface, blurring the lines between reality and illusion.<br>
Whether you're dealing with a fragile mirror or a delicate maid, you have to use just the right amount of force. Not too forceful, but not too gentle~<br>
Ah... We're in perfect sync.<br>
But it's strange... Why won't this one go away?<br>
It's as if this mark is as deeply rooted as the mark you've left on my life~<br>
Sooo... How about you come a little closer and see for yourself?<br>
The teasing way she seeks an answer piques my curiosity.<br>
See, there's still a little mark right here... Oh? Goodness, that happens to be right where my chest is reflected.<br>
Isn't that embarrassing? But still, we need to get this mirror clean. Don't look away, Master. Get a good look at it!<br>
There's a big, confident smile on her face. I doubt she's "embarrassed" at all.<br>
I look at where she's pointing. There seems to be some kind of translucent mark there, indeed.<br>
When I look closer, I notice that it's swaying along with her breathing like a boat on the waves.<br>
Oh, Master? Did you notice something?<br>
Why did you look away from the mirror... and at my chest?<br>
Oh, dear! I see~ It wasn't a mark on the mirror all along. It was on ME!<br>
I guess I got all sweaty while you were teaching me...<br>
My dress is getting a little damp, too. How are you, Master? Are you sweaty?<br>
In that case, I think I know what needs to be cleaned next~<br>
Get yourself over to the bath for me, Master... Your hard-working maid needs so many more lessons, if you'll have her.<br>

<span style="color:#4eb24e;">William D. Porter：</span><br>
Commander, I'm in big trouble... HUGE trouble! Help meee!<br>
Hello? Hellooo, Commander, can you hear me?!<br>
Waaah! This bites! I'm gonna be late for my maid for a day gig with the Commander!<br>
When I get to our arranged meeting spot, I hear a familiar voice from inside a phone booth.<br>
What do I do... Oh, hey, C-Commander?! You're finally here!<br>
It's dangerous out here! Happy D might go crazy and attack us again... Come on, let's talk in here!<br>
She throws the door open and drags me in by the arm.<br>
As the door closes behind me, her rapid breathing mingles with the sound of my heart pounding.<br>
I wanted to come straight to you, but there was this big bang, and Happy D went all haywire!<br>
It opened a hole in the clock tower, smashed through seven streetlights in a row... For all I know, it's still out there causing mayhem!<br>
Basically, I'm in big trouble again... I'm really sorry for dragging you into this!<br>
Porter looks up at me with teary eyes. I actually believe that she feels bad about it.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">{playername}：</span><br>
I'm glad nobody's hurt. Let me take care of this.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">William D. Porter：</span><br>
Huh? Really?! Thank you so much!<br>
You always get me out of every mess... I love you, Commander!<br>
She buries her face in my chest, either seeking shelter or pleading for comfort.<br>
Through her sheer maid outfit, I feel warmth and a pounding heartbeat.<br>
I was trying to repay you with this maid for a day deal, but I didn't think we'd end up locked in a stupid phone booth...<br>
Oh! I should just start my services here and now, duh! It's not like we have to do it anywhere specific!<br>
Yeah, let's do that!<br>
She takes a deep breath to encourage herself and then awkwardly mimics a maid's posture.<br>
N-n-now, my... beloved Master...<br>
What service may I provide for you today?<br>
By the time she finishes whispering her rehearsed lines, her face is already deep red.<br>
M-Master, umm... Is it just me, or is it hot in here?<br>
Maybe we're a little too close...<br>
Aww... My outfit is all sticky from sweat... This is even more embarrassing than just being naked.<br>
Not that I mind... you seeing me, Master...<br>
*pant*... *pant*...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Telephone：</span><br>
*pant*... *pant*...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">William D. Porter：</span><br>
Since she's still in my arms, I can feel her hot, ragged breathing distinctly.<br>
Strangely, I hear the same sound as her panting from nearby, though it's a little distorted.<br>
The sounds overlap over and over in the cramped booth... until I see the phone off the hook and realize what has happened.<br>
Huh... What?! I-I forgot to hang up this whole time!<br>
Gaaah! Why is it so embarrassing to hear your own voice?!<br>
F-forget it! Either way, I! William D. Porter, your favorite maid! Will serve you with all of my being!<br>
I'll do my best, whatever the request!<br>
This time, I'm definitely not gonna mess up!<br>

{{折叠面板|标题=Milky Ministrations|选项=3|主框=1|样式=primary|展开=是}}
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Cowpens：</span><br>
Oh... Commander, you're here early~<br>
Were you impatient to receive my care?<br>
Cowpens awaits inside the room, holding a baby bottle full of a white fluid.<br>
The air is thick with the sweet smell of milk. It's almost as if every inch of the room is immersed in it.<br>
Sit down right here... It's time for your nutritional supplement~<br>
This milk is specially made for your needs. I kept it nice and warm, too.<br>
Would you like to drink it yourself? Or... should I help you?<br>
She leans in and offers me the bottle. Its sweet scent grows stronger.<br>
<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项1：You didn't have to go THAT far, Commander.</span>'''''<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项2：Help me?</span>'''''<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">{playername}：</span><br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项1）</span>'''''You didn't have to go THAT far, Commander.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Cowpens：</span><br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项1）</span>'''''Heehee, of course... I'd be happy to take care of you until your tummy is nice and full~<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项1）</span>'''''You'll get to snuggle up in my arms for as long as you want.<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项1）</span>'''''Wanna give it a try, Commander?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">{playername}：</span><br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项1）</span>'''''Uh... Do I have a choice?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">{playername}：</span><br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项2）</span>'''''Help me?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Cowpens：</span><br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项2）</span>'''''She blinks at me. There's evident disappointment in her eyes.<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项2）</span>'''''I was naive. Normal nutritional milk won't satisfy your needs anymore, will it?<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项2）</span>'''''But don't worry, Commander. I'll make even tastier, fresher milk!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">{playername}：</span><br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项2）</span>'''''I-I didn't mean it like that.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Cowpens：</span><br>
Aww, Commander~ If you can't choose on your own...<br>
Then first, I'll need you to be good and drink up aaall of this milk for me.<br>
The silky-smooth milk permeates through my body. Its sweetness naturally relaxes me, and its warmth seeps into my heart.<br>
After I've drunk it all, Cowpens smiles in satisfaction and whispers into my ear.<br>
There you go... Don't let a single drop go to waste.<br>
Let my nutrients fill your heart and body.<br>
Phew... I think it's finally starting to work.<br>
I'm getting a little bit hot, too...<br>
She pulls me into her arms and squeezes tightly. Her warm body envelops me along with the warm, milky scent.<br>
Our heartbeats mingle through our clothing. Sleepiness comes, and my consciousness starts to drift away.<br>
Just sleep, Commander.<br>
Sleep well... in my arms and my warmth.<br>
I'll hold you until you wake up.<br>
My mind blurs and melts into sweet warmth as I fall into pure-white dreams.<br>
Hehe... You won't be able to live without my nutrients anymore~<br>
My dear, beloved Commander♥<br>

{{折叠面板|标题=Surprising Game|选项=4|主框=1|样式=primary|展开=是}}
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Pasadena：</span><br>
Wow! Lucky you, Commander! You pulled TWO surprise cards right off the bat!<br>
That means you get to amp up the punishment!<br>
Pasadena invited me to the pop-up shop's game room.<br>
The rules of this game are simple: the winner pulls a surprise card, and the loser receives the punishment written on the drawn card.<br>
This is her second loss in a row, which means I very literally hold her fate in my hand.<br>
Ooh... You gonna use both at the same time? What an idea!<br>
Let's see. The first one is... taking off an article of clothing? Very direct and provocative!<br>
And the second is... that you get to write something on me? Ooh, I've got a great idea for that one!<br>
Okay, check this out, Commander~<br>
With the agility of a cat, she sidles up to me, undoes her ribbon, and pushes it into her cleavage.<br>
What are you waiting around for?<br>
If you don't write something quickly, your card won't be as effective!<br>
My gaze wanders over her more private parts before finally settling on her bare back. But as I try to pick up the brush, she grabs my hand.<br>
That card doesn't say you have to write "words" specifically, see? Let me show you an example~<br>
She licks the tip of the brush with her pink tongue, then guides my hand downward – across her neck, her clavicles, and around her shoulder blades – tracing a glistening collar upon her skin.<br>
Then, lower... My brush and hand alike sink into her cleavage.<br>
If you kept going that way, Commander, what do you think would happen?<br>
Hehe, that's enough for my example~ Maybe it'll come in handy next time you pull the same card.<br>
Aww, I lost again.<br>
Pasadena loses twice more... and I get to pull two more surprise cards.<br>
The mask and boots cards, eh?<br>
The boots that come with that one have a special tickling mechanism inside...<br>
As for the mask card, well, I'm not allowed to talk for a specific period of time. That whole time, you get to try and sabotage me all you want.<br>
BUT, if I can overcome this two-fold trial, then I win!<br>
She wastes no time putting on the boots and the mask.<br>
After taking a few deep breaths, she leans into me and winks upward.<br>
Okay... You may begin!<br>
On her mark, the boots start buzzing. She shudders violently.<br>
Her stifled breathing comes out of the mask as a white mist... but indeed, she doesn't say a word.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">{playername}：</span><br>
I guess I can start too, then?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Pasadena：</span><br>
Yeah... Ack!<br>
Her panting quickly turns to laughter, interspersed with muffled breathing.<br>
I can easily imagine her shutting her soft lips tight under that mask, desperately trying to withstand it. However...<br>
Pfft... Hahaha! St-stop, not right there! Hahahaha, I give, I give! No more, hahaha!<br>
I stop, but my hands are still trapped under her arms. She falls limp and into my chest, panting heavily.<br>
Haah, haah... My sides hurt from laughing...<br>
I guess the winner is – Mm, wait. Don't move~ I'm just saying for this round...<br>
Just as I'm thinking that's it for today's game, she suddenly whips around and pins me down.<br>
Commander... The game's not over yet. I'm not letting you go... not until we're all out of surprise cards♥<br>

<br>
*knock knock*<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Yorktown II：</span><br>
Commander? Come on in!<br>
When I open the bar door, Yorktown is seated at the counter. She turns my way, as if she's been waiting for me.<br>
The warm, yellow lights illuminate her bunny-girl outfit, adding a touch of allure to her gentle demeanor.<br>
So you're finally here.<br>
At first, I invited you here just to relax, but... Heheh, I changed my mind.<br>
You're the owner of this bar now.<br>
As for me? Well, I'll be your personal waitress for the night.<br>
It's a pleasure to work for you~<br>
As your waitress, I hope you'll allow me to pour your first drink of the night?<br>
After guiding me to a seat, she pours glistening red wine into the glass on the table.<br>
Our fingertips brush as I accept the glass, leaving a ticklish sensation.<br>
Take the time to savor it, Commander. Consider my time tonight all yours.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">{playername}：</span><br>
How should I repay such luxurious service?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Yorktown II：</span><br>
All I want... is for your eyes to stay on me.<br>
Has my service tonight satisfied you, Commander?<br>
We touch our glasses together, sending a satisfying clink echoing through the bar.<br>
Her long, stocking-clad legs casually press against mine – a silent invitation.<br>
Or... Would you like something more special and intimate?<br>
Her toes wander upward, inch by inch.<br>
Make any request, and tonight, I will grant it.<br>
Hehe, this special service is for nobody but you.<br>
She wears a tempting, tipsy blush. Her warm breath, faint with alcohol, brushes against my neck.<br>
It's my first time serving you like this, though... I feel a little awkward.<br>
Would you give me one more chance? Will you... try the special cocktail I made just for you?<br>
Spurred on by my lack of refusal, a mischievous glint appears in her eyes.<br>
She doesn't return behind the counter, though – she gracefully leaps onto the counter and crawls on her knees.<br>
The bunny-girl outfit accentuates her curves.<br>
Every little movement comes with the rustling of fabric, which sounds especially clear in the quiet bar.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">{playername}：</span><br>
Yorktown? What are you doing?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Yorktown II：</span><br>
I just... thought this would be faster...<br>
Once in the middle of the counter, she doesn't reach for the shaker directly – rather, she uses her hands to support herself.<br>
Commander... I want you to look at me more closely.<br>
To see the Yorktown that I'm revealing to you.<br>
Besides... I don't usually get to see you from this angle. It's nice.<br>
After a pause, she finally takes the shaker and gives it a few shakes.<br>
Did you know, Commander?<br>
Some emotions are like shaken sparkling wine... just waiting for the right moment to erupt.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">{playername}：</span><br>
Such as?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Yorktown II：</span><br>
Such as... how I want to come closer to you and see nothing but myself in your eyes...<br>
As she finishes that sentence, she lurches over and falls toward me with an exaggerated cry.<br>
I reach out to catch her, and she falls right into my arms.<br>
Her soft body presses against me, and her slender arms wrap around my shoulders.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">{playername}：</span><br>
Was this part of your plan?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Yorktown II：</span><br>
Maybe it was... or maybe it wasn't.<br>
Yorktown looks up at me, breathing the faint scent of wine onto my cheek.<br>
As she tightens her grip on me, the shaker falls from her grasp and onto the carpet.<br>
So much for my special cocktail...<br>
But in your arms, I've found something even more intoxicating and overwhelming.<br>
Those soft murmurs linger in my ear as she tightens her hold on me again, drawing me closer until our lips are nearly touching.<br>
Commander... Would you like to feel what I'm feeling?<br>
