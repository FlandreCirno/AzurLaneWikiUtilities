Summer Festival<br>
<br>
Chapter 1: Prepare for the Festival!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ikazuchi：</span><br>
It's that time of year again, Inazuma!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Inazuma：</span><br>
What time of year...?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ikazuchi：</span><br>
Festival time! Time to stuff our faces with food and our hearts with fun!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Inazuma：</span><br>
I see! It's festival time!<br>
Wait, is that a thing? An annual festival?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ikazuchi：</span><br>
Errmm...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Kitakaze：</span><br>
If it isn't a thing, let's make it a thing!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ikazuchi & Inazuma：</span><br>
Kitakaze!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Kitakaze：</span><br>
My ears were burning... with talk of the Sakura Empire, talk of summer!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Zuikaku：</span><br>
It wouldn't be summer without a festival~<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Kitakaze：</span><br>
Well if it isn't Zuikaku. You're with me, aren't you!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Zuikaku：</span><br>
Ahaha, glad to be on the right side of history~<br>
Now if we're all on the same page, let's put together a summer festival for everyone!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ikazuchi：</span><br>
I see! This is what they call "bandwagoning," isn't it?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">{namecode:96}&{namecode:164}：</span><br>
Um, well...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Inazuma：</span><br>
Then... should we go get the Commander...?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Zuikaku：</span><br>
... And so that's why... we want to put on a summer festival, Commander!<br>
<br>
... The request seemed to come out of nowhere.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Kitakaze：</span><br>
Y-you wouldn't crush our dreams, would you, Commander...?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Inazuma：</span><br>
We even brought along this little one. She's so excited for the festival.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Mutsuki：</span><br>
I love festivals! I can't wait to help out! I'll eat all the festival candy... hehehe...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">I-26：</span><br>
I want to see fireworks! Come on, Commander! It'll be fun!<br>
<br>
It was summer, after all. And they did make it sound fun.<br>
<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项1：Let them have it.</span>'''''<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Kitakaze：</span><br>
Our Commander is wise and fair as ever!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Zuikaku：</span><br>
Haha, let's get started then! Call out the girls from the other factions too.<br>
Time to get busy~<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Everyone：</span><br>
Yeah!<br>
<br>
And so it was, that after a period of intense, grueling preparation, the port was at last ready for its annual summer festival.<br>

Summer Festival<br>
<br>
Chapter 2: Enjoy the Festival!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Juno：</span><br>
Wooow... so this is a Sakura festival. There's so much to do~<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Sheffield：</span><br>
Indeed... it's not bad. Hehe... they even have a target shooting game. My trigger finger is itching.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Juno：</span><br>
Um, I don't think you can use your own gun for those games...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Sheffield：</span><br>
... It was only a joke.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ikazuchi：</span><br>
Ta-daa!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Inazuma：</span><br>
Ta-daa!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ikazuchi & Inazuma：</span><br>
Welcome to the Sakura Empire Summer Festival!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Juno：</span><br>
Wow, you two look fantastic! Thank you for inviting us.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Sheffield：</span><br>
Yes, I was just saying to Vampire– Oh...? Where did she go?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Juno：</span><br>
Vampire? I think I saw her going to that stand over there. They've got fizzy drinks with marbles in them? <br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Vampire：</span><br>
Hehehe... my body thirsts for the nourishing crimson of fresh blood...<br>
Hmm, I would have the watermelon flavour, please~<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Juno：</span><br>
Hah, I see she's enjoying the festival in her own way.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Mutsuki：</span><br>
Kitakaze! Kitakaze! There's a whole bunch of candy stands over there! I wanna go!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Kitakaze：</span><br>
Okay! Just gimme a second to buy another chow mein–<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Mutsuki：</span><br>
Waahh... but I wanna go! I wanna go! I'll just go by myself!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Kitakaze：</span><br>
Ugh...! I-26, can you take her?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">I-26：</span><br>
Hold on a sec. Just one more time! Aie! It broke again... That one didn't count! One more! Gimme another net!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Zuikaku：</span><br>
Aahh. Take in that sweet festival air~ You can really smell everyone's hard work, even the Commander's.<br>
<br>
Seeing the happy smiling faces of my girls enjoying the festival, I couldn't help but feel all that hard work was worth it.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Zuikaku：</span><br>
Haha, speak of the devil! It's the Commander. Come to enjoy the fruits of your labors?<br>
Hm? Look who's here, that's the Union girl, um...?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Honolulu：</span><br>
Grrrr, that St. Louis, "Put this on, it'll drive the Commander wild!" *Hmph*, as if that's anything I'd want...<br>
She, she called it a... "Yukata," I think? It does look pretty good...<br>
But isn't it a little tight... Especially around the chest area...?<br>
<br>
Wish her a happy festival.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Honolulu：</span><br>
C-C-C-C-C-C-Commander?!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Zuikaku：</span><br>
Evening, Honolulu~<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Honolulu：</span><br>
Zuikaku, right? G-good evening...<br>
<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项1：Compliment Honolulu.</span>'''''<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Honolulu：</span><br>
Y-you like my dress? R-really...? Th-thanks...<br>
<br>
Honolulu was being uncharacteristically open with her feelings. It must have been that festival magic.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Zuikaku：</span><br>
Ahahaha! Welcome, welcome! Enjoy the festival! We're just about to start the main event!<br>
<br>
(POP! POPOPOP!)<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Honolulu：</span><br>
Wooowww! So this is how they do fireworks in the Sakura Empire?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Zuikaku：</span><br>
Yep. It's Akashi's special festival recipe. We'll have to thank her later~<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ikazuchi：</span><br>
Ooo! Ikazuchi! The fireworks!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Inazuma：</span><br>
Tamaya...?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Zuikaku：</span><br>
Ahahahaha! Commander, Honolulu, come on! Taaamayaaaa!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Honolulu：</span><br>
Huh?! Whaa?! What the heck kinda Sakura custom is this? Ta-tamaya...?<br>
<br>
All good things must come to an end. The festival couldn't last forever, neither could summer itself. But for the time being...<br>
We had a chance to just relax, learn some Sakura words to shout at fireworks, and enjoy a summer festival together.<br>
