III 「Unicorn’s Annoyances」<br>
A few days later…<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Unicorn：</span><br>
Hmm... Unicorn… just can’t understand...<br>
During that concert... Onii-chan appeared as if he was bathing in a light of happiness...<br>
But that light didn’t come from Unicorn...<br>
(Shakes head furiously) No no... Unicorn just wants to make Onii-chan feel... happy.<br>
Hmm... what exactly can Unicorn do... to make Onii-chan... that happy...<br>
Lady Stardust? Could it be... Unicorn can feel that she was the source of that light... the one bathed on Onii-chan...making him so happy.<br>
Onii-chan once said… “Don’t be afraid to ask”?<br>
Unicorn... wants to ask Lady Stardust...<br>
