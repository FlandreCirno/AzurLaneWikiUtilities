Saratoga was happily humming while carrying out her work as the secretary.<br>
... but she seemed to be so absorbed in her work that she wasn't aware of it.<br>
<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项1：Take a look at the "goods" from before.</span>'''''<br>

Stop right there! Sneaky photo ops are already pushing it, but secretly using Akashi's copy machine as well... is a sin, nya!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Gridley：</span><br>
Commander, help meee~! I simply wanted to spread the gospel of Sister Sara's charm to the whole world! ...Wait, that copy machine is yours, Akashi?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">{namecode:98}：</span><br>
Damn right, nya! As a result, I'm going to have to confiscate all of that! Hand over the originals, nya!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Gridley：</span><br>
Noooooooo... *collapses*<br>
<br>
And that was how "Sister Sara's Best Pictures vol. 1 " came into my possession.<br>
If Gridley's testimony was to be believed, within this tome was pictures of every angle of Saratoga's daily life... perhaps quite literally.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Saratoga：</span><br>
♪～♪～♪<br>
Commander~ I'm about done~! After we're finished with work, let's go get some more lessons from Lexington!<br>
<br>
...Well, since she hasn't noticed yet, perhaps it wouldn't hurt to take a peek at this album first...<br>

Chapter 2: Sara's Work Never Ends!<br>
The first photo was of Saratoga in her full rigging, cruising with a serious look on her face.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Saratoga：</span><br>
All righty! Sara's carrier task force lecture is about to begin~!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Renown：</span><br>
It is an honour to receive your instruction!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Illustrious：</span><br>
Miss Sara, thank you for coming~<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Queen Elizabeth：</span><br>
Spare no expense in your training! ... Wait, why am I here too?!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Saratoga：</span><br>
I'm going to start the lecture! Carriers have a much longer attack range than battleships! The most crucial thing is how you utilize this advantage!<br>
In other words, think of it like a prank! It's most effective to attack your opponents where and when they least expect it!<br>
Since we here at the Eagle Union have the longest experience operating carriers, make sure to study hard!<br>
<br>
... ...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Renown：</span><br>
I see the light! Indeed, that was very informative!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Queen Elizabeth：</span><br>
Hmm... does she not sound like she's talking down to me?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Illustrious：</span><br>
Your Majesty, now's not the time to be contrary~<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Saratoga：</span><br>
Hey, you two right there! No chattering during the lecture!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Illustrious：</span><br>
Yes ma'am~<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Queen Elizabeth：</span><br>
Arghh....!<br>
<br>
Despite her appearances, Sara sometimes would end up reminding us of her seniority among carriers.<br>

Chapter 3: Sara's Day Off!<br>
The fourth photo was of Saratoga, doing her work as an idol(?) even on her day off...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Saratoga：</span><br>
Mmhmm! Today's photoshop went pretty well!<br>
Ahh, after you've been in the field for a while, everyone wants to work with you~ That settles it, I'm going to star in a movie!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Comet：</span><br>
Miss Saratoga, do ya reckon... *cough!* I mean, do you think we'd be able to do something like that?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Saratoga：</span><br>
Don't you fret! Comet, you and the others just aren't used to it yet! No matter what happens, you'll all have my support!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Crescent：</span><br>
Miss Saratoga is right! Have some more faith in yourself!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Cygnet：</span><br>
Yeah! Let's do our darndest... to enjoy the party!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Saratoga：</span><br>
All right! Preparations are A-O-K!<br>
Cheers!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Cygnet：</span><br>
Cheeeers! *cough* *hack*! Miss Saratoga, did you perhaps...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Saratoga：</span><br>
Heh heh heh! I might have slipped a bit of ginger in there~! Got you good!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Crescent：</span><br>
Um, I think there's some vinegar in mine... did you slip something into everyone's drink?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Saratoga：</span><br>
My bad, my bad! I had to be on my best behavior all day, so I just couldn't help it...<br>
To make it up, let me get you a new round of drinks, hang on tight!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Comet：</span><br>
Ah, umm, we'll come help ya out!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Saratoga：</span><br>
Appreciate it! Wait, Commander, that one's gaso- I mean, it's squid ink! Remember to brush your teeth afterwards!<br>
<br>
... Right...<br>
Now that I think about it, that explains the terrible, no-fun morning I had that other day...<br>

Chapter 4: Sister Sara and Lady Lex!<br>
The twelfth photo featured Saratoga hugging her sister, Lexington, from behind...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Saratoga：</span><br>
Sara's pranks were a huge hit today! Heehee~♪<br>
Hmm... whose turn is it next~? Chitose is really scary when she's mad, so maybe Commander will do~<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Lexington：</span><br>
USS Saratoga, CV-3?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Saratoga：</span><br>
Woooah! B-big sis!?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Lexington：</span><br>
Saratoga, I heard all about it, you know? You were out playing pranks on others again...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Saratoga：</span><br>
I-I'm sorry...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Lexington：</span><br>
Don't you think you should stop causing trouble to your friends, as well as to Commander? Someone has to take care of the girls who you prank.<br>
And it's not just those who you play pranks on, either. It will affect everyone's morale, and that could prove fatal on the battlefield.<br>
Above all else, I don't want to see you get injured in action because people no longer want to work with you. That's why you need to make sure to properly apologize.<br>
Sara, you're not a child anymore. If you won't stop pulling pranks on people, then can you at least make sure that you apologize right away?<br>
I feel bad for the girls you pranked too. It makes me very, very sad to see you do things like that to others...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Saratoga：</span><br>
Lexington... I'm really sorry...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Lexington：</span><br>
It's fine... but make sure to take what I said to heart and make up with your friends...<br>
<br>
And with that, the pranks resumed the next day.<br>
Sometimes, she in fact did apologize, and nobody ever got hurt. In fact, some even started to say that... Lexington was a bit too uptight.<br>

Chapter 5: Paparazzi Problems! (Part 1)<br>
The thirty-fifth photo was of a serene beach at night... And standing there was Saratoga, flashing a brilliant smile.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Saratoga：</span><br>
♪～♪～♪<br>
Phew, that about wraps things up for today! Sis is gonna get worried if I get back late...<br>
Hmm, actually let's practice a bit more. I don't mind if it's Lex or Comet's group, but I definitely don't want to lose to those upstart Sakura idols!<br>
♪～♪～♪<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Gridley：</span><br>
Sara's practicing by herself again... this idol business sure is really hard work...<br>
But it's strange, isn't it? The Sakura Empire is world famous for producing many idols, but almost none of them ended up in this fleet...<br>
Whatever, the important thing is getting this shot...<br>
<br>
(Snap!)<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Gridley：</span><br>
Crap... forgot to silence the shutters!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Saratoga：</span><br>
Is that you, Gridley?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Gridley：</span><br>
How'd you know?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Saratoga：</span><br>
Because you're the only one who snoops around like this, Gridley... Aoba and the others at least ask beforehand.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Gridley：</span><br>
Sorry! I'll scram right now!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Saratoga：</span><br>
It's fine, it's fine! We all know each other here anyways. While this kind of stuff normally would be a bit problematic, it's not like Gridley plans to do anything bad, right?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Gridley：</span><br>
... ...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Saratoga：</span><br>
So, it's not a problem! Collecting photos is A-O-K, but selling them is a no-go!<br>
All righty, here! Say cheese~!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Gridley：</span><br>
Ch-cheese!<br>
<br>
(Snap!)<br>
Gridley's smile was stiffer than a yearbook photo in this one.<br>

Chapter 6: Paparazzi Problems! (Part 2)<br>
The thirty-sixth photo was of Saratoga.... preparing something in the kitchen at night.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Saratoga：</span><br>
Hey Gridley, could you help get something for me?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Gridley：</span><br>
Sorry, Sara, I can't reach that either... Why don't you try using your planes?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Saratoga：</span><br>
Ehh... I guess it's worth a shot. All right, everyone. Umm, let's get the parsley, pepper, and herb shakers! Gridley, can you help grate the radishes?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Gridley：</span><br>
All righty! A little bit of work for a prime photo op? That's way too good of a deal! But, why do you suddenly want to make bento box meal?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Saratoga：</span><br>
Well, I heard that Commander would be coming by to inspect the academy tomorrow. I heard from the Sakura kids that for situations like this, you have to prepare a bento, so...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Gridley：</span><br>
Hoooold your horses! Don't say any more!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Saratoga：</span><br>
Huh? What's the matter?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Gridley：</span><br>
These words aren't meant for me! You should say them to Commander.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Saratoga：</span><br>
Gridley...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Gridley：</span><br>
I've got your back, all the way! Oh, by the way, what are you using for the sauce? Wait... what's that bottle over there?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Saratoga：</span><br>
Heheh~ the Sakura kids told me that bentos must be made in a way that reflects one's personality!<br>
And there's nothing that would reflect Sister Sara's personality better than this~<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Gridley：</span><br>
Run for your life, Commander!!!<br>
<br>
And the last photo in the album is...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Saratoga：</span><br>
Commander, what are you looking at?<br>
<br>
I raised my head to find Sara staring right at me, her face extremely close.<br>

Chapter 7: What I Treasure Most<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Saratoga：</span><br>
Yikes, these are photos of me! Commander, are you perhaps...<br>
<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项1：I swear, they're not mine!</span>'''''<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项2：That's right, this is mine!</span>'''''<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Saratoga：</span><br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项1）</span>'''''Hmm... I'm not sure I believe you... Who did you get these from anyway~?<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项1）</span>'''''Isn't it obvious? There's only one person here who would be able to take all these photos.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Saratoga：</span><br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项2）</span>'''''Ehhhh? No way...! Commander, you took these?<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项2）</span>'''''... That's absurd! There's no way Commander could take photos of this quality.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Saratoga：</span><br>
Well, who took these doesn't matter. We're almost on the last page! Let me take a look!<br>
<br>
As she spoke, Saratoga reached out to flip the page.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Saratoga：</span><br>
H-huh!?<br>
<br>
Upon the photo was Saratoga walking hand-in-hand with Commander.<br>
Now that I think about it, all the other photos in this album were with other people.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Saratoga：</span><br>
Umm! Commander! This one's off limits! Nothing to see here!<br>
...because... Sister Sara isn't good at dealing with these kinds of things...<br>
Ahhh... ya blew it, kid...<br>
<br>
Saratoga's voice became softer and softer.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Saratoga：</span><br>
Um... make sure to give it back to Gridley, okay...? But...<br>
Not this one! I'm not going to give this one back~♪<br>
After all, this photo... is what I treasure most!<br>
<br>
Saratoga's smiling face was the same as in the photo - half joyous, half mischievous.<br>
