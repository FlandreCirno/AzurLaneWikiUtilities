Moments with the Young Miss<br>
<br>
1 The First Sound Under the Sky<br>
As I was taking a walk after finishing work, I noticed some beads of sweat forming on my brow.<br>
“It wasn’t this hot earlier this morning,” I thought to myself as I looked towards the crisp, blue sky.<br>
CRAAAAACK——!!!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Achilles：</span><br>
Gahh!! How are you so good at hitting these?!<br>
<br>
A solitary white baseball cut across the calm sky— along with Achilles’ remorseful voice.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Leander：</span><br>
Oh my... How many home runs does that make now...?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ajax：</span><br>
I stopped counting after about ten or so. Who knows how many we’re at by now?<br>
<br>
It seemed like the three Leander-class sisters were playing baseball. Deciding to take a look, I turned towards the direction of their voices...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Chaser：</span><br>
Hehe~♪ If my memory serves me correctly, that would make 16 home runs.<br>
Looks like I’m starting to get a good feel for this. Give me a few more pitches, please~<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Achilles：</span><br>
Ehhh... Give me a break already... No matter how blazing my fastballs are, you always hit them back easily...<br>
<br>
Achilles was crouching over the ground, clutching her head in distress. Apparently, the three sisters had been keeping Chaser company.<br>
I certainly did not envy those girls, having to play baseball against one of the Bogue-class sisters.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Chaser：</span><br>
Oh my, isn’t it a bit early to be giving up? What happened to all that bravado from earlier~?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Achilles：</span><br>
I never would’ve challenged you if I knew you were so stroooong~!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Chaser：</span><br>
Hehe, fine by me. Let’s call it for the day then— Hey, isn’t that the commander over there?<br>
<br>
Having noticed me, Chaser and the three Leander sisters waved.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Chaser：</span><br>
Did you come here after seeing all those home runs I hit?<br>
<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项1：Your hits had a really pleasant ring to them.</span>'''''<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项2：Your batting form was wonderful.</span>'''''<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Chaser：</span><br>
Thanks for the compliment— but having that said, I still can’t return a single one of Bogue’s pitches.<br>
Oh right, Commander, are you busy right now? I’d like to talk to you if possible.<br>
<br>
Luckily, I had already finished my work and had no plans for the time being.<br>
When I said that to her, Chaser smiled and walked up next to me.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Chaser：</span><br>
Great. Can I count on you to escort me then, Commander?<br>
<br>
I nodded in response to her joking tone, and we headed to the office together after she waved goodbye to the Leander sisters.<br>

<br>
2 Novel Tea Novelty<br>
We were both pretty parched from being outside in the heat, and Chaser went to pour some iced barley tea.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Chaser：</span><br>
Commander, I’ll pour some for you as well, so just sit tight. I’m an expert at this.<br>
Hmm... this is barley tea, not black tea? I don’t think I’ve ever had this before. Hehe, how interesting~<br>
<br>
Chaser poured the barley tea into a teacup rather than a regular cup, and sat down in front of me, face-to-face across the desk.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Chaser：</span><br>
So, let’s get to the issue at hand.。<br>
Did you know I received an order from Queen Elizabeth the other day?<br>
<br>
If I recalled properly... it was an order to send a representative from the Royal Navy to each camp to facilitate communication.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Chaser：</span><br>
If you’ve already heard about it from Her Majesty, that should save us some time. Anyway, I am one of the representatives.<br>
Of course, our friends from the other camps will also be visiting us as well, for the sake of strengthening our cooperation.<br>
<br>
As she spoke, Chaser passed me a letter from Queen Elizabeth.<br>
I opened the envelope carefully, revealing the luxurious stationery within. I could practically hear the Queen’s words in my head as I read the contents.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Queen Elizabeth：</span><br>
——If you’re reading this letter, you must already have heard what Chaser has to say. In short, the purpose of this exchange is to enhance our mutual understanding.<br>
To be honest though, there’s nothing particularly serious about this. It’s nice for the different camps to visit each other.<br>
Chaser is rather new at this, though, so I would have you, my loyal servant, support her. Won’t you?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Chaser：</span><br>
―Well? What did Her Majesty write?<br>
<br>
I explained the contents of the letter to Chaser.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Chaser：</span><br>
Hmm. Really, I’d prefer to go on my own, if I might. But I wouldn’t want to get it from the Commander on the back end either.<br>
Alright, it’s a boon from Her Majesty, after all. I will accept it with gratitude. Of course, that’s assuming you aren’t too busy, Commander?<br>
<br>
It was no trouble at all. I picked up my teacup, took a sip, and prepared to set off.<br>
It had the makings of an interesting time.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Chaser：</span><br>
Thank you very much, Commander.<br>
<br>
Chaser let slip a little chuckle.<br>
Then, as if suddenly remembering something, she raised the milk jug she was carrying and poured it into her tea.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Chaser：</span><br>
What’s the matter, Commander? Milk makes tea so much better. That’s just common sense, no?<br>
<br>
She sipped at her milk barley tea as she spoke.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Chaser：</span><br>
...Indeed, a tea of subtle flavour.<br>
<br>
Chaser mumbled to herself, rolling her eyes as she covered her mouth.<br>

<br>
3 Curiosity and Cake<br>
―Chaser’s first day with another camp.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Chaser：</span><br>
This is the Vichiya dormitory! Let’s hurry inside.<br>
<br>
Chaser quietly pushed the door open and went through.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Chaser：</span><br>
Oh~ The interior design is really quite different from the Royal Navy’s...<br>
<br>
The Curious Chaser pointed to every little thing in the room.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Dunkerque：</span><br>
Oh? That’s an unfamiliar face... and the Commander with her?<br>
...Oh, you’re the girl they sent from the Royal Navy. I am Dunkerque. Would you tell me your name?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Chaser：</span><br>
Good day, Dunkerque. I am Chaser. Are you familiar with our plan for the day?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Dunkerque：</span><br>
Yes. You’ll be watching our exercises and sitting in on classes.<br>
And... I’ve prepared a special cake for you as a welcoming gift. You can look forward to that. Hehe~<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Chaser：</span><br>
A cake! Marvelous! I’ve brought some delicious teas myself, I do hope you’ll let me serve you.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Dunkerque：</span><br>
That’s something to look forward to―Forgive me, I have a prior engagement...<br>
<br>
Dunkerque walked toward the back with an air of mild exhaustion, Chaser following naturally behind her.<br>
I felt like we were meant to wait at the entrance, but seeing them grow farther and farther from me, I was left with no choice but to follow as well.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Chaser：</span><br>
Now then, you seem rather tired.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Dunkerque：</span><br>
Hm. You and the Commander followed me... I forgot to ask you to wait by the door.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Chaser：</span><br>
Something the matter? The Commander and I aren’t troubling you, are we...?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Dunkerque：</span><br>
No. I worked very late last night, but if I could just take a short rest with some sweets...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Chaser：</span><br>
I’ve just the thing!<br>
I’ll get out the tea I brought, and Dunkerque, you fetch that cake of yours a little early. What do you say?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Dunkerque：</span><br>
That would mean major changes to our plans... I’m not sure if the other girls with their lessons and exercises would be okay?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Chaser：</span><br>
We still have some time to the next activity, yes? Besides, this isn’t any sort of serious study situation, we’re just having a break!<br>
<br>
Chaser then leaned in and whispered directly to my ear.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Chaser：</span><br>
(...I’d thought the Vichiya a dreadfully dedicated folk, and yet, here we are!)<br>
<br>
Chaser chuckled and spun around cheerfully to look Dunkerque in the eye.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Chaser：</span><br>
Now then, Dunkerque, would you show us to the kitchen?<br>
<br>
Chaser had proven her curiosity a valuable asset when it comes to plunging into unfamiliar situations.<br>
...Actually, I’d say what really mattered more was the way she cared about other people, and charmed them in doing so.<br>

4 When in Rome<br>
Chaser’s visit to the Northern Parliament on the second day of her mission went off without a hitch.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Avrora：</span><br>
Commander, Chaser, what do you think of our camp?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Chaser：</span><br>
Oh, everyone’s so cooperative, and responsive. The Royal Navy has a lot to learn from you, I think. I know I learned a lot.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Avrora：</span><br>
Did you now? Hehehe. By the way, you will join us for dinner, won’t you?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Chaser：</span><br>
Say, now that you mention it, it is getting rather late. Since we’re here, we might as well?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Avrora：</span><br>
Excellent. This way, please...<br>
<br>
Northern Parliament Dormitory - Canteen<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Chaser：</span><br>
Wow! That’s a huge table! Does your whole fleet come to dinner?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Avrora：</span><br>
It depends on the day. We’ve got a lot of unique personalities among us...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Tashkent：</span><br>
Oh... Dear Comrade and the Royal Navy girl. You’re still here...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Chaser：</span><br>
Yes, we’re here for dinner. I trust that won’t be a problem!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Tashkent：</span><br>
Oh. Then you can try the borscht. It’s good.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Chaser：</span><br>
Thank you. And in return, I’ll make you a fine tea.<br>
Sorry to keep you waiting~ Do please enjoy my special Chaser Blend♪<br>
Right then... here you are!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Tashkent：</span><br>
......!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Avrora：</span><br>
Ice...?!<br>
<br>
Chaser plopped some ice cubes into the tea.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Chaser：</span><br>
I’ve heard you Northerners like to drink iced tea. Enjoy♪<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Avrora：</span><br>
It’s... astonishing...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Tashkent：</span><br>
...You can tell she’s run the shipping lanes to the Northern Parliament a lot...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Chaser：</span><br>
Hehe, time for me to have some too♪<br>
<br>
And so, we all had some tea together.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Chaser：</span><br>
...Hot is nice, but cold is good too! Drink up, Commander♪<br>
<br>
I’d thought her only familiar with Eagle Union culture. I never knew she could learn the Northern Parliament just as well...<br>

<br>
5 A Passion for the Exotic<br>
After her visit to the Northern Parliament, Chaser spent time with the other camps, one after another.<br>
On the last day of her mission, she arrived at the Sakura Empire, scarcely able to contain her excitement.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Chaser：</span><br>
The Sakura Empire is the home of the samurai and ninjas. You must know this, Commander?<br>
<br>
Her image of the land and its people was clearly shaped by Union movies, but I dared not get into the topic.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Takao：</span><br>
Commander, we’ve been waiting for you. You... you’re the new one from the Royal Navy, are you not? I am called Takao.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Chaser：</span><br>
Wow! You’re one of the samurai I was just talking about! I am Chaser. You’re every bit as imposing as they say!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Takao：</span><br>
Commander, what is she...?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Chaser：</span><br>
Oh, dreadfully sorry, I’m a bit too excited. Is that your samurai sword? May I see it?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Takao：</span><br>
I don’t mind showing you, but it is dangerous to handle the naked blade... You should not get too close.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Chaser：</span><br>
Perhaps later then, should we get the chance. Righto!<br>
<br>
Chaser, biting her fingernails with anticipation and making me honestly kind of anxious, hurried into the Sakura dormitory.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Takao：</span><br>
Let us begin with our exercises, as planned.<br>
<br>
Takao led us out to a place where we could see the sea, and Chaser couldn’t contain a yelp as soon as she saw the assembled formation.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Chaser：</span><br>
Commander, is that girl there a ninja?<br>
<br>
She pointed at Akatsuki.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Takao：</span><br>
Pardon... But why do you care so much for samurai and ninja?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Chaser：</span><br>
Hmm... It’s hard to put into words... I suppose it’s a sort of fascination with the exotic. Ninjas have their “ninjutsu,” yes?<br>
That one there, she’s a ship, but unlike one of the Union girls, I get this excitement that she’s both a ship and a ninja!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Takao：</span><br>
Well, I can certainly admit there is indeed a difference between a Union ship and a Sakura ship. But nevertheless, the Royal Navy...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Chaser：</span><br>
It’s all about expanding my horizons. Don’t you think it’s fun to learn new things, Miss Takao?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Takao：</span><br>
Hm... that’s true too...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Akatsuki：</span><br>
What is this?<br>
<br>
Sensing the eyes on her, Akatsuki came over to us.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Takao：</span><br>
Oh, it’s nothing important. This is Chaser, she came to observe with the Commander today...<br>
She seems particularly interested in ninjas.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Akatsuki：</span><br>
Well then, bear witness to my ninjutsu!<br>
<br>
Our story took a strange turn...<br>

<br>
6 An Ungraceful Attempt?<br>
The combined enthusiasm of both Chaser and Akatsuki pushed us to a demonstration of Sakura Empire ninjutsu techniques, courtesy of the latter.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Chaser：</span><br>
I think Long Island once said that ninjas can run on water!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Akatsuki：</span><br>
That’s right. With my power, I can even achieve such feats!<br>
<br>
Akatsuki sped up and did three loops around the water.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Chaser：</span><br>
And you can use like that “katon” jutsu power to throw some fireballs!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Akatsuki：</span><br>
Easily!<br>
<br>
Akatsuki sounded her main gun. A low-powered training round hit the target and popped into a small fireball.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Chaser：</span><br>
And you can vanish in a puff of smoke!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Akatsuki：</span><br>
L-Like this?<br>
<br>
Akatsuki put up a smoke screen... huh?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Chaser：</span><br>
Seems like you do all of it with your rigging...?<br>
<br>
As Chaser said, the ships can use these rather fantastical techniques with the power of their riggings.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Akatsuki：</span><br>
You want to see something that doesn’t use rigging...? Hm...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Chaser：</span><br>
The art of seduction?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">{namecode:66}＆{namecode:11}：</span><br>
Wha?!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Chaser：</span><br>
Like so...?<br>
<br>
My right arm pressed against something soft...<br>
...Chaser had snuggled herself up against me.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Takao：</span><br>
Ah-Ahem!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Chaser：</span><br>
Oh... Sorry! That’s not quite right, is it?<br>
<br>
She released my arm... And that was the most shocking thing Chaser had done over the past few days.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Chaser：</span><br>
What’s the next item on our agenda, Miss Takao?<br>

<br>
7 Excitement and Curiosity<br>
In the evening, the sun slowly sank into the west...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Chaser：</span><br>
We’re done for the day, then?<br>
<br>
I lifted my head to see Chaser standing in front of me.<br>
After leaving the Sakura dorms, I told Chaser to come by later as she prepared to return to the Royal Navy.<br>
She had to submit her report on her visits, and...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Chaser：</span><br>
Hehe, it was quite nice to see the Commander’s serious side this afternoon...<br>
I had to subject you to a little unladylike teasing.<br>
<br>
She reminded me what happened that afternoon by the Sakura training grounds.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Chaser：</span><br>
Takao and Akatsuki were rather cross with me. The former called me shameless and the latter grumbled out her “aagghh” growling.<br>
It’s not only the different camps, but all the individuals within them that have their own unique characters.<br>
<br>
Chaser walked gracefully to the window, glowing in the lustrous light of the setting sun as she shared her thoughts.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Chaser：</span><br>
Over the course of my service, I’ve been to so many different places, and yet there are still so many more I haven’t seen, with so many things waiting to be discovered.<br>
When I’m here with you like this, I feel so fulfilled. I guess you could say that little prank this afternoon was a sort of “payback,” eh♪<br>
<br>
She smiled and turned to face me.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Chaser：</span><br>
Now then, why did you ask me here?<br>
<br>
The reason should have been obvious...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Chaser：</span><br>
You want me to continue as your secretary? I’d be happy to, of course, but why?<br>
<br>
Her youthful appearance belies her curious nature. I’d expect recklessness from her, but she’s surprisingly compassionate...<br>
Every one of her unexpected outbursts was also... “fun.”<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Chaser：</span><br>
Thank you. I’ll do my best to live up to your expectations, Commander.<br>
I’m glad to live in such grace and joy♪<br>
