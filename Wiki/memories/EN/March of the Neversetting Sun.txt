March of the Neversetting Sun<br>
<br>
1 Connecting the Dots<br>
Royal Navy Fleet<br>
Command Vessel<br>
NA Sea Route<br>
The day after Elizabeth called, we joined Grenville's search-and-destroy fleet to the Royal Navy's Scapa Flow Anchorage.<br>
In the wake of the large-scale battles in this sea, the destruction of Compiler's mainframe, and the ongoing clean-up operation, the NA and Atlantic Ocean are busier than ever.<br>
Countless merchant and transport ships travel on newly active trade routes. Though they have armed escort fleets, the routes grow safer by the day.<br>
The goods they bring in are like rain showers after a drought, bringing vitality and hope to lands and seas plagued by the fires of war.<br>
Our voyage has been wonderfully smooth.<br>
While Memphis is busy working in her room, I contact Helena META to discuss our plans for the future.<br>
When the light dissipates, I'm greeted by that familiar starry sky.<br>
<span style="color:#ffc960;">Helena META：</span><br>
It's rare for you to be the one who initiates contact.<br>
I just wish it weren't only when you needed something.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Umm...<br>
<span style="color:#ffc960;">Helena META：</span><br>
I'm hinting that you should ask me to go on vacation with you sometime, Commander.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Okay. If we ever have the time...<br>
<span style="color:#ffc960;">Helena META：</span><br>
I'll make time, don't you worry.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
(Gah. There I go, letting her lead the conversation again...)<br>
(I need to ask her this, and I need to do it now.)<br>
(Let's get down to business.)<br>
<span style="color:#ffc960;">Helena META：</span><br>
Yes, yes, I can tell you want to get down to business. You have your doubts about Elizabeth's invitation, I'm guessing?<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
(Is she reading my mind, or what?)<br>
<span style="color:#ffc960;">Helena META：</span><br>
It's been on my mind, too.<br>
I understand Elizabeth META is strong, but that whale-snatching Devil is a force to be reckoned with.<br>
To be honest, I thought their hunt would take longer – and end in a painful retreat at best.<br>
It's almost disappointing how easy they had it.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Agreed. Miss D's whale should be important to Devil, right?<br>
<span style="color:#ffc960;">Helena META：</span><br>
Yes, VERY important. While we're at it, why don't we review Devil's actions so far?<br>
You've probably heard this from Renown or Repulse by now, but the Antiochus and Ashes once had a major clash. That was when Devil and Hierophant attacked one of the Ashes' strongholds together.<br>
Devil and Hierophant weren't the same as they are today.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
As I recall... The Tower appeared in the nick of time and disrupted the space the battle was taking place in, giving the Ashes a chance to escape.<br>
Were you fighting alongside the Ashes back then, Helena?<br>
<span style="color:#ffc960;">Helena META：</span><br>
There was a Helena among them, yes, but she was not me.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Really?<br>
<span style="color:#ffc960;">Helena META：</span><br>
Really. Now, we're digressing, so let's get back on topic.<br>
Bismarck ought to have shared this with you: While Hierophant manipulated Marco Polo into preparing the Kingdom of God, Devil was also cooking up something.<br>
She used a conceptual attack to induce the Iron Blood fleet to infiltrate the space where Hermit's mainframe was, in order to use it as a vector for contamination.<br>
Bismarck was able to stop this, but Devil's plan still managed to divert the Iron Blood's attention and firepower for long enough to support Marco Polo's schemes.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
In other words, Devil and Hierophant have always worked together – even when Hierophant was out of the picture.<br>
<span style="color:#ffc960;">Helena META：</span><br>
That's right. When Marco Polo caused the near-superimposition event, Devil directly supported Hierophant by serving as an auxiliary vessel for her.<br>
The situation was mere moments from catastrophe, but of course, it was all within my expectations.<br>
<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项1：Impressive as ever.</span>'''''<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项2：(Don't comment.)</span>'''''<br>
<span style="color:#ffc960;">Helena META：</span><br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项1）</span>'''''I can tell you don't really mean that.<br>
<span style="color:#ffc960;">Helena META：</span><br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项2）</span>'''''...That look on your face tells me that you don't believe me.<br>
<span style="color:#ffc960;">Helena META：</span><br>
I'll have you know that even if Hierophant had broken through the blockade and beelined toward you, I had a countermeasure.<br>
I recall you came out of that without any injuries whatsoever, no?<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
(...Hm?)<br>
Then those illusions...<br>
<span style="color:#ffc960;">Helena META：</span><br>
What illusions?<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Hierophant and I ended up in a dark space together, where we saw Doctors Anzeel and Aoste.<br>
She stopped attacking as soon as she saw those illusions... Are you saying you weren't the cause of that?<br>
<span style="color:#ffc960;">Helena META：</span><br>
Is that why...? That would explain why Hierophant became more active after contact.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Active?<br>
<span style="color:#ffc960;">Helena META：</span><br>
It's nothing more than a hypothesis I've been looking into. It doesn't matter right now, so allow me to continue.<br>
Then came the Sea of Stars salvage operation. One overeager Constellation probed into things better left untouched, leading to peril.<br>
Fortunately, Devil used one of her vessels to return the team to us safely.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
I have a question.<br>
<span style="color:#ffc960;">Helena META：</span><br>
Go on.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Why was Devil in the Sea of Stars? And... where exactly is it anchored to, anyway?<br>
<span style="color:#ffc960;">Helena META：</span><br>
Let me answer the second question first. You already have an idea, don't you?<br>
Yes, I induced the Eagle Union into building the Sea of Stars.<br>
But I did not directly provide them with any advanced technology – I only nudged them in the right direction and guided them away from dead ends and wrong turns.<br>
Consider it a joint project by me and test site beta.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Then what about the near-infinite space inside it?<br>
<span style="color:#ffc960;">Helena META：</span><br>
That's a partition of the Tower's resources. The Sea of Stars has free usage rights.<br>
Which means that all experiments performed there are technically done within the Tower. However, that partition is fully under the Sea of Stars' control, so the Tower can't directly interfere with their projects.<br>
Of course, forced shutdowns and brute-force hacking are still possible...<br>
Does that tell you why Devil was inside the Sea of Stars? She's not in there, but rather, she's shut inside the Tower.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
You mean the Tower, the Arbiter, trapped her inside the Tower, the structure?<br>
<span style="color:#ffc960;">Helena META：</span><br>
Perhaps Tower found Devil in a reversed state... and, not taking too kindly to that, she decided to just lock her up or something.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
An Arbiter in a reversed state... Vestal META said something along those lines, too. What does it actually mean?<br>
Is it a program malfunction? Corrosion, maybe?<br>
Just based on Devil, I've noticed that she's become a lot more aggressive since becoming reversed. She doesn't seem to discriminate between friend and foe.<br>
<span style="color:#ffc960;">Helena META：</span><br>
That's only a surface-level change, not a fundamental one. Hmm... It should be safe to share this with you.<br>
Do you know that numbered Arbiters each have completely independent personalities?<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Yeah.<br>
<span style="color:#ffc960;">Helena META：</span><br>
But you subconsciously treat them as parts of a greater machine, don't you?<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Now that you mention it, maybe...<br>
<span style="color:#ffc960;">Helena META：</span><br>
It isn't just you. Most people who have dealt with the Antiochus for a long time feel the same way.<br>
But yes, every Arbiter has an independent personality.<br>
Zero and the Arbiters aren't a queen bee and her drones, but rather... akin to a flat organizational structure.<br>
Arbiters each have their own strategy and personal experimental domain. As a rule, none of them is subordinate to each other. Their only direct report is Zero.<br>
Naturally, special orders from Zero or other immediate needs may demand that multiple Arbiters work together at times.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
From what I'm hearing, they're not parts of a system, but more like a research team.<br>
<span style="color:#ffc960;">Helena META：</span><br>
Correct. They're like researchers in a team called The Arbiters, led by Zero.<br>
Normally, they're allowed to experiment as they desire, but occasionally, they must team up or carry out special projects given to them by Zero.<br>
Mistakes and differences of opinion are parts of the scientific process. At times, conflict is permitted... within a certain framework, that is.<br>
Whenever they choose a research topic, they may also choose to verify or falsify the hypothesis.<br>
If an Arbiter chooses to challenge their own or another's hypothesis via picking the side of falsification, the system considers them in a reversed state.<br>
That's why reversed Arbiters will seem indiscriminately aggressive.<br>
Do you understand me so far?<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Loud and clear. I'll need to take a close look at how I view the Arbiters from now on.<br>
<span style="color:#ffc960;">Helena META：</span><br>
That's only natural, given the introduction of new information. Good luck.<br>
Now, shall we continue discussing Devil?<br>
Time passes, and you and Elizabeth META go on a whale-hunting expedition together.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Wait... I want to ask about Pamiat' Merkuria META first.<br>
<span style="color:#ffc960;">Helena META：</span><br>
Let me guess. You want to know about her connection to Hierophant, and her current situation?<br>
The ability she used to create her paradise in Antarctica was fundamentally the same as that used in the Kingdom of God.<br>
Like Marco Polo, Hierophant manipulated her into helping with an attempted escape plan.<br>
But her sloppiness led to her failing much faster than Marco Polo did.<br>
After her failure, she lay low on a tropical island. However, when Akagi created illusions all over the world and threw the Pacific into chaos...<br>
Well, she tried to take advantage of the commotion to invade Antarctica again, but I found her.<br>
<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项1：Bad luck for her.</span>'''''<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项2：I think I know what happened next.</span>'''''<br>
<span style="color:#ffc960;">Helena META：</span><br>
Exactly what you're thinking. You won't need to worry about her anymore.<br>
Back to the Martyrium... Based on the memories Hierophant revealed to you, Hatakaze was another person manipulated into working toward her release.<br>
That explains why Devil personally supported her during the fight over the city.<br>
In summary, Devil is still cooperating with Hierophant, whether directly or indirectly.<br>
Connect the dots, and I think we'll see a picture of the Arbiters' ultimate escape plan.<br>
<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项1：I totally get it now.</span>'''''<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项2：Can you explain it more?</span>'''''<br>
<span style="color:#ffc960;">Helena META：</span><br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项1）</span>'''''Heehee. That's our Commander.<br>
<span style="color:#ffc960;">Helena META：</span><br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项2）</span>'''''Hierophant's escape plan was to use the ritual of the Kingdom of God to build a projection of herself in this dimension.<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项2）</span>'''''Through special spatial rules that only apply in the Kingdom of God, she would then pour most of her essence, as it were, into said projection.<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项2）</span>'''''After that, she would use a type of conceptual partitioning power installed in the whale to sever the connection between the projection and her original form.<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项2）</span>'''''In the end, through another characteristic of the Kingdom of God – conceptual fixation – to finalize the projection's concept as Hierophant.<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项2）</span>'''''In the end, she's split off a part of her body and created a new whole from the part. It's almost like a lizard losing its tail and regenerating a new one, you could say.<br>
<span style="color:#ffc960;">Helena META：</span><br>
That's why the whale is so important to Devil.<br>
But judging from the state of the Hierophant you made contact with, Devil must not have attained her goal. That should make her even less willing to let go of the whale...<br>
Unless...<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
You think... Devil found a new method that doesn't need the whale?<br>
<span style="color:#ffc960;">Helena META：</span><br>
That's right, and I think it's an even better method than their original one. Otherwise, they wouldn't so easily give up the enormous sunk costs they've already put into this.<br>
Furthermore, Commander, I think this plan is related to you.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
To me?<br>
<span style="color:#ffc960;">Helena META：</span><br>
I'm afraid we'll have to bring up another unsavory individual – The Magician.<br>
I believe she's used you to form a cooperative relationship with Devil and Hierophant.<br>
That's why she keeps interfering with my observation. She and Hierophant obstructed us together just recently.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
How's that?<br>
<span style="color:#ffc960;">Helena META：</span><br>
While I was busy utilizing the Tower's full processing powers, Hierophant took the opportunity to spirit you away. That must have been a coordinated move.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Speaking of that, I had this dream recently.<br>
I found myself in Magician's classroom, but she wasn't there.<br>
Instead... Bon Homme Richard was.<br>
<span style="color:#ffc960;">Helena META：</span><br>
...Did I just hear you right?<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Yeah. Bon Homme Richard was in the classroom. It was only for an instant, but it's so clear in my mind.<br>
More than that, though, she looked so... normal.<br>
<span style="color:#ffc960;">Helena META：</span><br>
That's not what I'm concerned with. Wait just a moment.<br>
I told you before that the malfunction that left Camelot stranded was because the Antiochus had moved test site beta, didn't I?<br>
The Arbiters who did that were Empress, Lovers, and Magician.<br>
Their reasoning is related to Bon Homme Richard.<br>
At the time, she was extremely close to your world. Test site beta was on the verge of collapse.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
It was that close?!<br>
<span style="color:#ffc960;">Helena META：</span><br>
I was ready to launch a contingency plan, but the Antiochus resolved the danger before I could.<br>
Those three Arbiters must have made contact with Richard.<br>
And after that, she was in Magician's classroom...<br>
It's just like the Spectral Moon incident... No. I shouldn't breathe another word about it.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Spectral Moon... You've mentioned that before. What exactly is it, though?<br>
<span style="color:#ffc960;">Helena META：</span><br>
The Arbiter Project was an enormous investment, and its results were far from favorable. But after the Spectral Moon incident, even more resources were allotted to it.<br>
In the blink of an eye, they had developed Magician's AI personality and a special device to go along with her. That's all I can tell you right now.<br>
I never could tell why she does what she does.<br>
She must be as crazy as all the other Arbiters.<br>
Be extra careful around her. She's dangerous.<br>
Stay away from that classroom from now on, if you can.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
I'd love to, but I'm not exactly going there of my own volition. I just end up there.<br>
<span style="color:#ffc960;">Helena META：</span><br>
Yeah... I know. I'll do what I can, too.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Don't be so nervous. I've dealt with Magician plenty of times by now, and I'm still alive.<br>
<span style="color:#ffc960;">Helena META：</span><br>
*sigh*... Maybe. I hope I'm just being paranoid.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Wait... Sorry, Helena, but there's something I don't get.<br>
If Magician and Hierophant were in contact from the start, then that makes everything sound strange.<br>
<span style="color:#ffc960;">Helena META：</span><br>
Hm? What are you saying?<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
I understand that Devil didn't ask for help from other Arbiters because she's reversed, but Magician surely isn't.<br>
She could ask for help from other Arbiters or Zero any time she wanted.<br>
The power of the Antiochus combined ought to be able to free Hierophant with ease, shouldn't it?<br>
But she didn't do that. She went so far just to draw your attention and give Hierophant a chance to attempt her own scheme.<br>
Isn't that strange?<br>
Hierophant is clearly in danger, but the Arbiters as a whole are utterly indifferent.<br>
Why aren't they trying their hardest to help her?<br>
<span style="color:#ffc960;">Helena META：</span><br>
Hmm... Is there really a need to try their "hardest"?<br>
Like I said before, Arbiters are coequal and independent.<br>
They have no responsibility to work together most of the time. Only when they willingly accept a request for aid or Zero gives direct orders will they cooperate.<br>
If Zero gave no order and Hierophant issued no request, then it's normal for help not to come.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
...Really?<br>
They're that inflexible, even in matters of life and death?<br>
<span style="color:#ffc960;">Helena META：</span><br>
I'm tempted to say that the Antiochus truly are rigid, mechanical, and bereft of humanity.<br>
But this matter isn't that simple.<br>
As I mentioned, the Arbiters carry out experiments of various themes. Some of them can be... extreme.<br>
Can we say with certainty that Hierophant's status isn't part of one of those experiments?<br>
That she's trapped, that she's attempting escape...<br>
You're right. Magician didn't ask for help, and Zero hasn't given a rescue order. But most of all...<br>
Why do you think that Hierophant didn't use Devil to contact the other Arbiters much earlier?<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Hmm... Do you have a clue, then?<br>
<span style="color:#ffc960;">Helena META：</span><br>
More or less. You should think about it, though – call it homework.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Homework? How long have you fancied yourself a teacher?<br>
<span style="color:#ffc960;">Helena META：</span><br>
Excuse you. I'm not just a teacher – I'm the dean.<br>
Anyway, we've talked for long enough. I shouldn't share anymore, so goodbye.<br>
<br>
Without waiting for me to say goodbye, Helena cuts off the communication.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
(Hm? Is it just me, or did she ignore something really important?)<br>
(What was I trying to ask her, again?)<br>
(Right... How did Elizabeth META get the whale so easily?)<br>
(Well, Helena did have her doubts, too. The whale was supposed to be really important to Devil.)<br>
(If you follow that logic, though, then it's as if she knows Devil doesn't need the whale anymore...)<br>
(So why was she suspicious of Elizabeth META's invitation? It doesn't make sense.)<br>

March of the Neversetting Sun<br>
<br>
2 Miss D's Change<br>
Scapa Flow Anchorage<br>
Gate of Avalon - Reception Area<br>
I know full well that I can't make Helena META answer questions she doesn't want to.<br>
With my questions unanswered, I find myself before the magnificent Gate of Avalon.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Queen Elizabeth：</span><br>
Welcome to the Gate of Avalon, faithful servant!<br>
<span style="color:#ffc960;">Queen Elizabeth META：</span><br>
How long it's been, servant. We appreciate your speedy response to our summons.<br>
<br>
In a luxurious reception area that didn't exist the last time I was here, I have an audience with two queens.<br>
We mostly skip the pleasantries and discuss the Camelot malfunction and Bon Homme Richard.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Queen Elizabeth：</span><br>
What?! You mean to say she almost caught us?!<br>
<span style="color:#ffc960;">Queen Elizabeth META：</span><br>
We always worried that might happen. To think that an Antiochus, of all things, was our salvation...<br>
It's so funny, one forgets to laugh.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Queen Elizabeth：</span><br>
If nothing else, we managed to escape the worst in the nick of time.<br>
Still, the Antiochus are watching this test site closely. We must advance all of our preparations posthaste.<br>
<span style="color:#ffc960;">Queen Elizabeth META：</span><br>
Indeed...<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Preparations... You mean expanding and powering up the Gate of Avalon?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Queen Elizabeth：</span><br>
That isn't all. I've been working on things behind the scenes in case things worsen in the future.<br>
The Gate of Avalon upgrades are but a means to make the other measures go more smoothly.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
So Her Majesty has a grand plan in the works?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Queen Elizabeth：</span><br>
Heh heh, of course! I'll happily divulge the details later, but for now, you just think about it.<br>
Now, we've had you come here to discuss the whale. We've captured it, so now we need to examine it thoroughly.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
About that... Where's Miss D?<br>
She was obsessed with the whale, wasn't she?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Queen Elizabeth：</span><br>
Umm, well...<br>
<span style="color:#ffc960;">Queen Elizabeth META：</span><br>
That girl is facing some personal troubles. We've limited what she can do for the sake of safety.<br>
You'll... understand quickly, we assure you.<br>
<br>
Using the newly installed monorail, the queens and I travel through the Gate of Avalon.<br>
Beyond vast forests and towering mountains, we arrived at our destination – an artificial lake of mercurial silver.<br>
The whale hovers quietly above the lake, with mechanical arms working all over its surface.<br>
As for Miss D, she comes rushing over right away.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Miss D：</span><br>
Assistant, assistant, assistant!<br>
YOU CAME TO SEE MEEEE!<br>
Gimme a BIIIIG HUG!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Death's Shadow：</span><br>
......<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Miss D：</span><br>
You! Outta the way! Shut up! Go away!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Death's Shadow：</span><br>
......<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Miss D：</span><br>
Grrr! Assistant, wait there for me!<br>
I'll deal with this stupid thing!<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Um...?<br>
<span style="color:#ffc960;">Queen Elizabeth META：</span><br>
There you have it. That is the reason Miss D cannot be allowed freedom.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
That's Death's Shadow, isn't it?<br>
<span style="color:#ffc960;">Queen Elizabeth META：</span><br>
Correct. The very same one that we fought in the Martyrium.<br>
You may recall that it invaded our Queen's Light.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Is it haunting Miss D now, or...?<br>
<span style="color:#ffc960;">Queen Elizabeth META：</span><br>
A more apt interpretation would be that it is her bodyguard and servant.<br>
It appeared out of thin air when we tried to recover the whale's functionality with Miss D.<br>
It responds to no communication, and it avoids all contact.<br>
All it does is follow Miss D and prevent her from straying too far from the whale.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
(Death's Shadow... War Protocol Scythe.)<br>
(Miss D's incompleteness, and the whale's ability to sever concepts...)<br>
(That must be it. Death's Shadow and Miss D are two parts of a whole. When they're combined, they'll become Arbiter XIII: Death.)<br>
<span style="color:#c3abff;">???：</span><br>
Remember this, it's important – they form a collective of countless fragments of data until they are given individual bodies.<br>
It is possible to replicate the individual offshoots of this collective. I gave this power to Death.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">moon：</span><br>
The War Protocol series is particularly effective against higher-level crystalline targets.<br>
Star and I have the most units equipped with this series. I believe we two are best suited to stall the enemy.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
(Are the Arbiters based on the War Protocol series?)<br>
(Did existing War Protocols get upgraded into Arbiters, or...?)<br>
(No, not necessarily. It wouldn't apply to Hierophant, nor to Magician...)<br>
(Maybe the War Protocol and Arbiter series are two projects that had been worked on in parallel?)<br>
(I'm still lacking important information.)<br>
By the way, when are we going into the whale?<br>
<span style="color:#ffc960;">Queen Elizabeth META：</span><br>
On the morrow.<br>
We've already secured several safe holds. Today, we will perform final checks.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Safe holds? This surely implies that the inside of the whale is dangerous, right?<br>
<span style="color:#ffc960;">Queen Elizabeth META：</span><br>
We do not know. We have seen it out of control, and we have seen it controlled by Devil as well.<br>
There is no telling what may lie within, so our only course of action is prudence.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Agreed. You can never be too careful.<br>
Tomorrow will do. For now–<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Miss D：</span><br>
Assistant! Over here!<br>
ASSISTANT! HERE, HERE, HERE!<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
...Do you mind if I talk with Miss D?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Queen Elizabeth：</span><br>
That's fine. Consider Death's Shadow a quiet guardian.<br>
I prepared afternoon tea. Come with me.<br>

March of the Neversetting Sun<br>
<br>
3 One Glorious Day<br>
Unknown time<br>
Unknown location<br>
Inside a gorgeous castle, warm sunlight filtered through the window and gently awakened a noble girl.<br>
<span style="color:#ffc960;">Glorious META：</span><br>
...The start of a new day.<br>
Dido, escort me to my dressing chamber.<br>
<br>
Chapel<br>
Morning prayer<br>
6:30 - 7:00<br>
<span style="color:#ffc960;">Glorious META：</span><br>
"To the hallowed name who smiles upon our land like the sun,"<br>
"Protector of our safe haven, beacon of our glory."<br>
"May the light of your wisdom protect us across the seven seas."<br>
"May the authority of your blade reveal the truth in this chaotic world."<br>
"May you grant us the power to overcome hardship and endure trials, to purge evil and bring peace."<br>
"With your revelation, we walk a path of faith."<br>
"Eternal glory upon your name."<br>
Phew... It's almost time.<br>
Charybdis, let us break our fast.<br>
<br>
Dining room<br>
Breakfast<br>
7:00 - 7:30<br>
<span style="color:#ffc960;">Glorious META：</span><br>
Breakfast was delicious.<br>
Thank you to all involved in preparing it.<br>
Hmm... Dido should have delivered the day's paperwork to my office.<br>
I suppose I should get to work on it.<br>
<br>
Office<br>
Daily paperwork<br>
8:00 - 10:00<br>
<span style="color:#ffc960;">Glorious META：</span><br>
Goodness... I didn't even realise how much I'd done.<br>
Things around the world haven't changed as much today as they did yesterday.<br>
A peaceful day, perhaps... thanks to everyone's hard work.<br>
Eagle, you've been craving a duel with me, haven't you?<br>
Today's the perfect day for it. Shall we head to the simulation room?<br>
<br>
Intelligence chamber<br>
Simulation room<br>
10:30 - 11:30<br>
<span style="color:#ffc960;">Glorious META：</span><br>
Heheh, two to zero. Well played.<br>
You're getting stronger, but so am I.<br>
Oh, no... I lost track of time. Before long, Belfast is going to come and rush me along.<br>
Let's go to the dining room posthaste.<br>
<br>
Dining room<br>
Lunch<br>
12:00 - 13:00<br>
<span style="color:#ffc960;">Glorious META：</span><br>
Today's lunch seems a little, uh...<br>
Did Manchester cook today?<br>
I'll just have to hope afternoon tea is more promising...<br>
Umm... Thanks for the meal.<br>
<br>
Correspondence chamber<br>
Daily communications (and afternoon tea)<br>
14:00 - 17:00<br>
<span style="color:#ffc960;">Glorious META：</span><br>
No reduction or increase in points of interest today...<br>
Reports from all of our communication nodes are normal.<br>
Hmm... Neither good nor bad, in the end.<br>
Oh, my. Edinburgh, you brought afternoon tea for me?<br>
Phew... Tea and snacks should give me the energy to keep going.<br>
<br>
Battlefield<br>
Combat training<br>
17:30 - 19:30<br>
KABOOOM!<br>
<span style="color:#ffc960;">Glorious META：</span><br>
105, 106, 107...<br>
All targets neutralised. Battlefield zero is secure.<br>
I still have spare time, so maybe I'll go check on battlefield three to see how Victorious is doing...<br>
<br>
Dining room<br>
Dinner<br>
20:00 - 21:00<br>
<span style="color:#ffc960;">Glorious META：</span><br>
Wow... What a splendid dinner we have today.<br>
Aurora, did you cook this all yourself?<br>
Heehee, I love it. It's delicious.<br>
But I would maybe appreciate it more if it was a little less spicy...<br>
<br>
Study<br>
Reading time<br>
21:00 - 22:30<br>
<span style="color:#ffc960;">Glorious META：</span><br>
"Since you are tongue-tied and so loath to speak, in dumb significants proclaim your thoughts..."<br>
"Let him that is a trueborn gentleman and stands upon the honor of his birth..."<br>
"If he suppose that I have pleaded truth, From off this brier pluck a white rose with me."<br>
"Let him that is no coward nor no flatterer, but dare maintain the party of the truth, pluck a red rose from off this thorn with me."<br>
Hmm, things are getting tense.<br>
Oh... Sheffield? Is it already so late?<br>
Let's call it a day, then... I should get ready for bed.<br>
<br>
Bedroom<br>
Bedtime<br>
23:00 - next morning<br>
Inside a gorgeous castle, the quiet moonlight lulls a noble girl to sleep.<br>
Thus ends another glorious day.<br>

March of the Neversetting Sun<br>
<br>
4 Lady E<br>
When the light fades, a bright academy campus sprawls before me.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Hm...?<br>
<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项1：It's not a classroom this time?</span>'''''<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项2：Did the area expand?</span>'''''<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">???：</span><br>
My, there's an unfamiliar face. Is this your first time here?<br>
<br>
I turn toward the voice and see a woman in black and white clothing.<br>
Her hair accessory, resembling a blue flame, flows in the wind.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Who are you?<br>
(No, wait... I've heard this voice before.)<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Distant Voice：</span><br>
...I was not expecting them to catch up so quickly.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Second Voice：</span><br>
Have they figured out the true purpose of our plan?<br>
Or is their blockade simply more solid than we thought?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Distant Voice：</span><br>
Keep releasing decoys. Disperse the pursuers and lead them to different coordinates.<br>
We will be safe as long as we leave this century.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Second Voice：</span><br>
Got it.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
(It's the same voice...)<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Lady E：</span><br>
Call me Lady E, if you'd please.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Lady E...?<br>
(Isn't this Magician's domain? Why is she here, then?)<br>
Are you... Empress? Or Emperor?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Lady E：</span><br>
Hmm?<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
(Considering the fact that Magician and Empress have worked together before...)<br>
You're Arbiter III, aren't you? The Empress.<br>
(I did hear two voices back then. If Empress was one, then was Zero the other?)<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Lady E：</span><br>
Heehee, you have such an active imagination. How do you associate so much with a single letter?<br>
It's not that complex, though. Here, I'm nothing but Lady E.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Okay... Is Magician not here, then?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Lady E：</span><br>
Magician? Oh, are you referring to Madam M?<br>
<br>
Lady E winks playfully at me.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
(Is it a rule that they have to use each other's codenames here?)<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Lady E：</span><br>
That's right.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
(What?! Can she read my mind?!)<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Lady E：</span><br>
No?<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
......<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Lady E：</span><br>
Just a little trick of mine. Don't mind the details.<br>
Teasing aside, allow me to answer your burning questions.<br>
I can honestly say that I don't know where Madam M might be or what she's doing here.<br>
From my experience, I'd assume she's teaching.<br>
Today's lesson is apparently an important one, so try not to disturb her if so.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Class? Does she have students?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Lady E：</span><br>
One student, yes, and she's someone you know.<br>
I shouldn't say any more. She's not my student, after all.<br>
If you're curious, go meet her in person.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">???：</span><br>
I should go.<br>
It's time.<br>
<br>
Suddenly, a pale girl speaks up behind Lady E.<br>
It's as if she had been there the whole time.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
(She appeared out of nowhere again!)<br>
(But she's completely different this time.)<br>
(It's like she's... gloomier?)<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Lady E：</span><br>
Now, I don't know everything about Madam M's students...<br>
But this girl happens to be a little... difficult.<br>
Have you ever seen a girl so dismal at such a young age? That's why I take her out for walks.<br>
Maybe some extra sunlight will brighten up her mood a little...<br>
Don't you think so?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">???：</span><br>
No.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Lady E：</span><br>
Talking with others lots can help, too. Look, here's a friend you can talk to right now! Come and chat, why don't you?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">???：</span><br>
Don't wanna.<br>
<br>
The girl shakes her head and raises her stuffed toy to hide her face.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Lady E：</span><br>
Fine, fine. Do whatever you want.<br>
<br>
The girl is suddenly gone again, as if she were never there.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
What's going on...?<br>
(I've been brought here, but Madam M is nowhere to be seen. This is the second time.)<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Lady E：</span><br>
I agree. It's just rude of her.<br>
Let's not waste your time. Shall I take you home?<br>
<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项1：Yes, please.</span>'''''<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项2：I want to look around a little longer.</span>'''''<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Lady E：</span><br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项1）</span>'''''No problem.<br>
<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项1）</span>'''''The woman in black and white smiles and waves a hand. When she does, the world is engulfed in darkness...<br>
<br>

'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项2）</span>'''''Apparently, she'd only asked out of politeness. I had no choice to begin with.<br>

<br>
I didn't get quality sleep last night, but I got up on time nevertheless to get ready for the expedition into the whale.<br>
According to the files the Royal Navy provided, that silvery lake I saw yesterday is apparently – and fittingly – called "Silver Mirror Lake."<br>
As for the whale above it, it's no more than an elaborate projection. The real one is deep under the lake.<br>
The reason for this is safety. Not just for the whale, but also for the Gate of Avalon in the event of a freak accident.<br>
Therefore, to get inside the real whale under the lake, I first have to go to a place called "the station" and wait for a train there.<br>
For the sake of safety, Elizabeth META detached one car from the Queen's Light for use during the expedition.<br>
We'll board said car today and proceed inside the whale. After that, we'll have to improvise as we go.<br>
Helena, who must care a great deal about the whale, surprisingly didn't show up in person.<br>
She told me that she had work on the Tower to do and couldn't attend because of it.<br>
Despite that, she'll still provide support via remote communications.<br>
As for Memphis, since the two queens were quite wary of the Eagle Union, she had to stay behind.<br>
So, all in all, the team that'll be exploring the whale today includes Miss D, the two Elizabeths, and Renown META and Sheffield META on guard duty.<br>
Royal Islands - Gate of Avalon<br>
Silver Mirror Lake Station<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Miss D：</span><br>
Assistaaant!<br>
<br>
The moment I enter the station's premises, a hooded little girl comes jumping at me.<br>
...And then her body gets suspended in mid-air.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Death's Shadow：</span><br>
......<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Miss D：</span><br>
Ugh... I'm gonna mess you up one day, I swear it!<br>
<span style="color:#ffc960;">Renown META ：</span><br>
Good morning, Commander.<br>
<span style="color:#ffc960;">Sheffield META：</span><br>
While we shall ensure your safety, I must ask you to please refrain from acting irresponsibly or touching anything without reason.<br>
<br>
I greet the two META guards, then the two queens come walking up to me.<br>
<span style="color:#ffc960;">Queen Elizabeth META：</span><br>
Servant, was everything alright last night?<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
(Huh?)<br>
I had a strange dream, but that was all.<br>
<span style="color:#ffc960;">Queen Elizabeth META：</span><br>
Alright, then.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Did something happen, or?<br>
(Could it be that they detected Magician's intrusion?)<br>
<span style="color:#ffc960;">Queen Elizabeth META：</span><br>
Yes, in fact. We noticed an intrusion attempt into the Gate of Avalon yesterday night. A short-lasted one, but still.<br>
We examined every avenue of entry we could think of, but found nothing unusual. One would assume that they failed.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Queen Elizabeth：</span><br>
Heheh! After pouring so many resources into it, my security system is finally starting to pay off!<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
(I mean, it didn't actually prevent it.)<br>
(Still, credit where credit is due – it's amazing that they were even able to detect it.)<br>
(Strictly speaking, it wasn't an act of hostility, either.)<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Queen Elizabeth：</span><br>
Well, we'll have plenty of time to talk later. For now, it's time to hit the road!<br>
<span style="color:#ffc960;">Queen Elizabeth META：</span><br>
There is no "road" where we're going, you.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Queen Elizabeth：</span><br>
What I MEANT is that it's time to depart, you!<br>
<br>
Putting aside the petty squabble, we all get into our seats. Then, just as the doors start to slowly close...<br>
<span style="color:#ffc960;">Grenville META：</span><br>
Your Majesty, wait! I have an urgent report!<br>
<span style="color:#ffc960;">Queen Elizabeth META：</span><br>
Wait a moment.<br>
Speak, Grenville. What is it?<br>
<span style="color:#ffc960;">Grenville META：</span><br>
The monitoring room just received an external distress signal.<br>
The Royal Navy of another world is requesting help from us.<br>
<span style="color:#ffc960;">Queen Elizabeth META：</span><br>
Alright... What else did they say?<br>
<span style="color:#ffc960;">Grenville META：</span><br>
"In the name of the Eternal Sun."<br>
<color=#FFC960>Queen Elizabeth META</color><color=#000000>&</color><color=#5CE6FF>Queen Elizabeth</color>：<br>
......<br>
<br>
The two queens exchanged glances with each other as soon as those words were dropped.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
"Eternal Sun"? Does that mean anything?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Queen Elizabeth：</span><br>
It's code for "our allies are in catastrophic danger." We have to come to their aid at once.<br>
I'm afraid you won't get to go on that whale expedition with us today, servant.<br>
<span style="color:#ffc960;">Queen Elizabeth META：</span><br>
Hold on. What if we have your servant come along to the rescue?<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
To support another test site, you mean? I do have experience commanding battles and might be of use.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Queen Elizabeth：</span><br>
No. This is an unknown test site that could fall at any moment. It's so dangerous that we don't even have time to gather intel on it.<br>
In short: Absolutely not.<br>
<span style="color:#ffc960;">Queen Elizabeth META：</span><br>
Alright. We shall go and organise a fleet.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Queen Elizabeth：</span><br>
Then I'll make adjustments to Camelot. I'll also try to get a picture of the scene at the destination.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Miss D：</span><br>
What should I do?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Queen Elizabeth：</span><br>
You... can stay here and keep my servant company.<br>
Seeing as our team needs to be revised, I'll tell Bel to make new plans for the expedition. How about we try this again tomorrow, servant?<br>
<span style="color:#ffc960;">Helena META：</span><br>
(It's okay. There's no need to change your plan.)<br>
(Tell Elizabeth that I'll bring help and meet up with them right away.)<br>
<br>
And so, the matter was settled.<br>
We'll link up with Helena and her backup in four hours, then continue on our whale expedition.<br>

March of the Neversetting Sun<br>
<br>
6 The Imperial Council<br>
Realm of the Neversetting Sun - Capital<br>
Palace of Westminster<br>
Inside a parliament hall, a heated discussion between the few attendees filled the air.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Hood：</span><br>
Order! Honourable members, maintain order, please.<br>
Whilst we could argue for the rest of time, we still do need a constructive solution.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Duke of York：</span><br>
Solution? Why need we such a thing, pray tell? Prithee tell me ye take not that beguiling signal in earnest.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Newcastle：</span><br>
I can vouch for the authenticity of the signal's source. It is indeed from beyond our world.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Nelson：</span><br>
And? What does the message say?<br>
"In the name of the Eternal Sun"... It sounds almost like a scam targeting our nation.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Illustrious：</span><br>
Be that as it may, it is still the first result we've received after launching our extraterritorial search plan.<br>
Yes, it is true that it's rather large compared to the bits of information we initially expected...<br>
However, that does not mean that we should hesitate now.<br>
To set foot beyond our territory and spread the Eternal Sun's glory – is that not precisely the goal of this plan?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Vanguard：</span><br>
I agree with Lady Illustrious. As a Palace Guard, I'm in favour of responding to this distress signal.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Royal Oak：</span><br>
The Royal Knights request a reconsideration.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Nelson：</span><br>
I'm against it.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Rodney：</span><br>
I'm also against sending a definite answer.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Duke of York：</span><br>
Naturally, I oppose this course of action.<br>
Even supposing that the message is sincere, its senders art sinking into a sea of flames. Wales, art thou willing to shoulder the weight of the world yonder?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Prince of Wales：</span><br>
...I think at least we should check on them.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Warspite：</span><br>
Hmm. If it's strictly about sending a survey fleet, I support this motion.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Prince of Wales：</span><br>
Your support is appreciated, Miss Warspite.<br>
I will not strong-arm any of you for assistance with this matter, and I will not request additional resources.<br>
Still, I would like to say this: Never before have we received a distress signal like this and simply sat on our hands in response.<br>
This should be done, and someone among us needs to do it.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Implacable：</span><br>
If we do dispatch a survey fleet, I will support it with resources.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Valiant ：</span><br>
As will I. Also, I have a person in mind for this task.<br>
She would no doubt be interested in this mission, and conveniently, she isn't in attendance today.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Duke of York：</span><br>
Thou hath mine agreement. Forsooth, that ambitious woman also hath the equipment that an extraterritorial survey needeth.<br>
Verily, she hath professed her equipment's excellence as of late and hath even proclaimed a yearning for an adventure most true.<br>
A vote for her I cast.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Nelson：</span><br>
The Governor of the Nile? Yeah, she is suited for the job. She has my vote, too.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Rodney：</span><br>
I concur.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Warspite：</span><br>
I'm not necessarily against it, but will a singular survey fleet led by her really suffice?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Duke of York：</span><br>
Whatever the ultimate outcome be, those who wish to participate may simply provide aid to the survey fleet.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Illustrious：</span><br>
Should the need to compose an expeditionary force arise, the Mediterranean fleet will provide assistance.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Vanguard：</span><br>
Thank you, Lady Illustrious. This mission is sure to be a success with your help.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Hood：</span><br>
Well then, honourable members, does anyone have further questions or remarks?<br>
......<br>
Alright, that settles the matter.<br>
That will be all for today's assembly.<br>

<span style="color:#ffc960;">Glorious META：</span><br>
That's strange...<br>
The number of points of interest has begun increasing.<br>
There are even faint signs of jamming in the contact points that have been stable for years...<br>
Could it be that... a dormant enemy has awoken?<br>
I'm the only one in this world who could do it...<br>
The only one who could rouse them.<br>
<br>
The communicator that had been silent for so long suddenly rang, interrupting Glorious' train of thought.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Communicator：</span><br>
BZZZT... BZZZT...<br>
...we received... signal...<br>
...currently... for reinforcements...<br>
...hold the line...<br>
<br>
The fragmented message cut off, and the room fell silent again.<br>
<span style="color:#ffc960;">Glorious META：</span><br>
My goodness... A reply?<br>
Have we finally, finally gotten... a reply?<br>
<br>
Her vision gradually clouded as teardrops quietly hit the floor. After all this solitude, it felt like the world had finally spoken to her again.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Queen Elizabeth：</span><br>
What a bloody mess!<br>
What are all their intelligence agencies doing?! Where in the world did that weird threat creep in from?!<br>
Why didn't we receive a single drop of information before?!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Vanguard：</span><br>
Your subordinates are searching as best as they can, Your Grace. Our priority now should be to rebuild our line of defence.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Queen Elizabeth：</span><br>
...Is it true that the Sirens' Combined Fleet wiped out the Iron Blood and Iris Orthodoxy?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Vanguard：</span><br>
Yes...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Queen Elizabeth：</span><br>
Since we can't identify the enemy, we should conserve our forces.<br>
Contact all fleets and order them to rally at the nearest rendezvous point, then return to base at once!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">King George V：</span><br>
Shall we prepare the homeland defence line now?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Queen Elizabeth：</span><br>
We're facing a rather unusual enemy and our second defense line has been breached. There's no guarantee the third one will hold.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">King George V：</span><br>
Understood. I'll make the arrangements.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Queen Elizabeth：</span><br>
Bel, contact every faction representative and call for an immediate emergency meeting.<br>
Glorious, I have an important task for you as well.<br>
I have a secret ally capable of dealing with this situation.<br>
I'll send a request for help. "In the name of the country of the neversetting sun." They are sure to respond.<br>
Wait in front of the communicator. Report to me as soon as there's a reply!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Glorious：</span><br>
Understood!<br>
<span style="color:#ffc960;">Glorious META：</span><br>
...It's been so many years since then.<br>
And now, after all this time, a reply has finally come...<br>
Your Majesty... I've completed my mission.<br>
But... how am I meant to report to you?<br>
<br>
Glorious shook her head, frantically swallowed her surge of emotion, and then regained her calm smile.<br>
<span style="color:#ffc960;">Glorious META：</span><br>
Forgive me.<br>
I am the symbol of the Royal Navy. My each and every action is an embodiment of its dignity.<br>
I must not forget my etiquette...<br>
Okay... Once today's battle is over, I shall get ready to receive our guests...<br>
<br>
