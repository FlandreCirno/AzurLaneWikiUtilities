<br>
Port - Office<br>
I switch on my phone and check my recent messages.<br>
"Mandy pls help! I'm trapped in the academy."<br>
"Nice I've got signal, says my message got delivered."<br>
The messages are from Z47, short and to the point, unlike her usual walls of texts and stickers.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
(Is she trying to prank me? No, that's not like her. I should ask for more details.)<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Little Enterprise：</span><br>
Commander! We need help!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Amagi-chan：</span><br>
*cough cough*... Commander...<br>
<br>
Just as I'm about to reply, two little shipgirls barge into my office.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Little Enterprise：</span><br>
Are you okay, Amagi? I didn't mean to exhaust you by dragging you along...<br>
I know you're supposed to stay calm in these situations, but I just couldn't. Sorry.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Amagi-chan：</span><br>
Whew... It's fine, I simply have poor cardio. Never mind that – we need to report to the Commander!<br>
<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项1：Trouble has come your way, too?</span>'''''<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项2：Report what? What's wrong?</span>'''''<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Amagi-chan：</span><br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项1）</span>'''''"Too"? Are you saying that you received the SOS as well?<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项1）</span>'''''Let's get our facts straight first. Tell me what's happened.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Little Enterprise：</span><br>
Something's happened at the academy! We can't reach anyone there or get inside to check.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
(They've lost all contact? That's odd...)<br>
Is Z47 there, too?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Amagi-chan：</span><br>
Yes, she is.<br>
<br>
I whip out my phone and send Z47 a message, but it doesn't go through – I get an error saying that my message could not be delivered.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
(This is looking more serious than I anticipated.)<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Little Enterprise：</span><br>
I think we should all go and investigate.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Amagi-chan：</span><br>
Just us three? That won't be enough. Commander, would you mind calling for some backup?<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Good idea. Let's head to the academy and I'll make some calls along the way.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Little Enterprise & Amagi-chan：</span><br>
Okay!<br>
<br>
Port - Academy Entry Gate<br>
A while later, I and a group of shipgirls have gathered outside the academy's entrance.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Tirpitz：</span><br>
I came running as soon as I got Bismarck's message. I tried to open the gate, but couldn't.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Bismarck：</span><br>
We tried the regular way, then the hard way... Even brute force couldn't get it open.<br>
I believe the academy has been pulled into a bizarre dimension and can only be entered by fulfilling certain requirements, much like a Mirror Sea.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
(A Mirror Sea around the academy? It can't be...)<br>
<br>
With that knowledge, I walk up to the gate's facial recognition system.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Security System：</span><br>
Alert! Your identity could not be verified! No entry for unauthorized individuals!<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Of course it wouldn't be that easy.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Bismarck：</span><br>
It wouldn't let me or Tirpitz in either. I can't believe it won't let YOU in, though...<br>
I've already messaged Ingraham and Soobrazitelny. They should be here soon.<br>
<br>
A while later, our little engineers show up. After a quick briefing, they get to work and try to break through the security.<br>
Sometime later...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ingraham：</span><br>
No dice. It won't open.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Soobrazitelny：</span><br>
Urgh... At least I can say this is not the fault of a system malfunction.<br>
There are two options if you want to get access to the encrypted data. Either you call in a specialist...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ingraham：</span><br>
Or you get the system developer to have a look. Did you get in touch with Yuubari yet?<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Yeah. I messaged her on the way here, but she has yet to reply.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Soobrazitelny：</span><br>
Speaking of Yuubari, I think she went to the academy to do some equipment maintenance... Oh no. She's also trapped in there, isn't she?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Bismarck：</span><br>
Trapped by the very system she created... How ironic, but also problematic for us.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
(Bombarding it with all we have should be our last resort. I could ask TB to hack her way in...)<br>
<br>
Then, while I'm weighing my options, the security system speaks again.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Security System：</span><br>
Verification successful. Welcome to the academy, U-31.<br>
<br>
With an unceremonious voice clip, the gate slowly slides open.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">U-31：</span><br>
That's it? I didn't even have to do anything!<br>
<br>
U-31 has appeared beside us, donning a school uniform – of some kind, anyway.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">U-31：</span><br>
Hiya, Commander. I'm here to protect you.<br>
Don't know how I did it, but I got the gate open.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ingraham：</span><br>
Just like that?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Soobrazitelny：</span><br>
It was working as normal this whole time? I thought the dang system had locked up!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Bismarck：</span><br>
Then if it's still working, it must've been tampered with. Interesting...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Tirpitz：</span><br>
Um... You should all probably look at the academy.<br>
<br>
As instructed, I turn my gaze toward it and immediately catch sight of a colorful banner with some sort of slogan written across it.<br>
"A little paradise for the pure, innocent, and mischievous."<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Tirpitz：</span><br>
That banner wasn't there before, was it?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Little Enterprise：</span><br>
No, definitely not!<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Hmm. This gives me an idea...<br>
Enterprise, Amagi, could you look into the facial recognition machine?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Security System：</span><br>
Verification successful. Welcome to the academy, Enterprise.<br>
Verification successful. Welcome to the academy, Amagi.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Bristol：</span><br>
Aha! The conditions to enter must be being pure, innocent, and little! Let me give it a shot!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Security System：</span><br>
Alert! Your identity could not be verified! No entry for unauthorized individuals!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Bristol：</span><br>
Hey! What the heck?!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Fu Shun：</span><br>
Aww, you poor thing. You must've lost your innocence after digging into too many dark secrets.<br>
When an investigator fails, it's time for an adventurer to step up to the plate!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Security System：</span><br>
Alert! Your identity could not be verified! No entry for unauthorized individuals!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Fu Shun：</span><br>
Are you kidding?! I'm the port's foremost adventurer! Let me iiin!<br>
You leave me with no choice... Commander, permission to open fire!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Fei Yuen：</span><br>
Hold your violent horses! Lady Yuen will get this gate open right away.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Security System：</span><br>
Alert! Your identity could not be verified! No entry for unauthorized individuals!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Fei Yuen：</span><br>
Waaah! This is slander!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Anchorage：</span><br>
Teacher, let me try!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Security System：</span><br>
Alert! Your identity could not be verified! No entry for unauthorized individuals!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Bristol：</span><br>
Not even Anchorage, huh? So what ARE the conditions to get in, then?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Amagi-chan：</span><br>
It's strange. Enterprise, U-31, and I were all authorized...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Eldridge：</span><br>
Let me... try.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Security System：</span><br>
Verification successful. Welcome to the academy, Eldridge.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Bismarck：</span><br>
I think I understand now. They must either be "little," or wear the correct kind of uniform.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Looks like it.<br>
(I believe some of the little shipgirls were doing extracurricular activities outside the academy when this thing started.)<br>
(That being the case, I know a few candidates for this mission.)<br>
<br>
A team capable of meeting the security system's criteria has been swiftly assembled.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Z43：</span><br>
My demon eye has revealed the truth – it is all a Dark Requiem conspiracy. Fear not, for I shall rescue our comrades caught beyond the periphery!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Taihou-chan：</span><br>
Heehee... I promise this won't take long, my Commander. I'll accomplish this mission before you know it.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">U-31：</span><br>
That's the spirit! Meanwhile, I'll keep an eye o– I mean, keep Taihou safe!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Eldridge：</span><br>
Rescue team... has no name.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Z43：</span><br>
Do we need one? In that case, I propose "Banishers of all Evil"!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Eldridge：</span><br>
I don't get it...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Li'l Sandy：</span><br>
Then how about "Twinkling Little Stars"?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Eldridge：</span><br>
Cute...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">U-31：</span><br>
I don't have anything against a cute name, but I want something with a cooler ring to it.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Bristol：</span><br>
Unbelievable... A big mystery is right at our doorstep, and I'm barred from entry! This is criminally unfair!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Fu Shun：</span><br>
I need a school uniform! Commander, get one for me!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Fei Yuen：</span><br>
Me too! I want a uniform!<br>
<br>
While the racket carries on in the background, the rescue team makes their final preparations.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Little Enterprise：</span><br>
Commander, I can go inside. Will you let me go with them?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Amagi-chan：</span><br>
I'd like to come, too.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Sorry, but no. The incident shook you, so you should stay out here and rest.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Little Enterprise：</span><br>
Hrmh... Fine.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
U-31, take this camera equipment with you. We'll tune in from out here and support you as best we can.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">U-31：</span><br>
Alrighty! I'll be back in a minute, then.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Z43：</span><br>
Mwahaha! My demon eye has already foretold the future. We shall return triumphantly!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Li'l Sandy：</span><br>
Yeah! We'll bring 'em all back safe and sound!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Eldridge：</span><br>
Bye-bye, Commander.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Security System：</span><br>
Verification successful. Welcome to the academy, Twinkling Little Stars.<br>

<br>
Little Academy - Arts Building<br>
The barren hallway is dead silent save for the sound of the wind, gently shaking the music note ornaments that decorate the walls.<br>
Then, there was a cracking sound.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Z43：</span><br>
WHUAH?! Wh-wh-what was that?! Did we set off a trap or something? C-Commander, come rescue meee!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Li'l Sandy：</span><br>
I stepped on a broken floor tile, that's all!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Eldridge：</span><br>
There's something... on the floor.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">U-31：</span><br>
Oh, you're right! You seeing this, Commander? Should I adjust the camera angle?<br>
Or maybe what you really wanna see is me, hmm?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Taihou-chan：</span><br>
You little... Get to the point already!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">U-31：</span><br>
Ooh, hear that? Little Taihou here is getting antsy!<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
...If you don't mind, turn the camera to the floor so I can see what's there.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">U-31：</span><br>
Okey-dokey.<br>
<br>
Through the camera, I see the floor is littered with cutouts of newspaper headlines – "accommodated," "missing," and "late in the night," they say.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Li'l Sandy：</span><br>
Hey, that sounds like the cryptid Bristol told me about earlier! "It couldn't be accommodated in its cage, so at night it fled and went missing!"<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Z43：</span><br>
How mistaken you are. Clearly, this refers to the missing fallen angel of fate who fell into the endless abyss – the late night – to defend the light!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">U-31：</span><br>
That's two crackpot theories. Anyone got another?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Eldridge：</span><br>
Shh... Music. I hear music.<br>
<br>
The chatter quickly dies down as everyone opens their ears and listens closely – there really is a light yet uncanny melody playing.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Memphis：</span><br>
Judging by the floor plan I have here, it's coming from the music room at the end of the hallway.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
My gut tells me that's where you'll find the key to resolving the situation in there.<br>
Twinkling Little Stars, head there and investigate. Be on your guard.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Everyone：</span><br>
Roger!<br>
<br>
Arts Building - Music Room<br>
BOOM!<br>
The girls throw open the door to a bewildering sight.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Shinano-chan：</span><br>
Hmm? Greetings, everyone. Please stay for a while. This one is positively brimming with energy right now!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Little Prinz Eugen：</span><br>
I'm so bored... I don't feel like doing anything, not even eating a snack or reading a book...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Lena：</span><br>
I can't be bothered with my hair anymore. It can stay the way it is...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Little Friedrich：</span><br>
I don't care to play any music... In fact, I don't need music at all.<br>
<br>
A strange song plays inside the music room. All the girls inside are lying about lazily, except for Shinano-chan, who is full of vim and vigor.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Helena：</span><br>
Commander, I think there's some kind of device in that room that's having an effect on those girls' minds.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">U-31：</span><br>
There's no "effect." Protecting the Commander is a pain in the butt and I just wanna lie down and rest.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Li'l Sandy：</span><br>
I'm done being a star! I've never helped the Commander anyway...<br>
<br>
Eldridge, meanwhile, remains silent and assumes the fetal position in a corner of the room.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Z43：</span><br>
Wait, Commander, you saw that, right?! Their personalities all did a 180!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Vestal：</span><br>
Whatever's affecting their minds, it's really powerful. It's influenced all of them.<br>
All of you who still have your wits about you, please retreat at once and dispatch rescue personnel.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Bismarck：</span><br>
There's no time. They should prioritize neutralizing whatever's causing this strange phenomenon.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Speaking of the phenomenon... Z43, how come you've not been affected? Any ideas?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Z43：</span><br>
Uhh... Because I covered my ears, I suppose? I sensed an evil presence the moment I set foot inside.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
(Ahh. Then it must be music causing this.)<br>
Z43, keep your ears covered and have a look around. Do you see any device that could be producing the music?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Z43：</span><br>
I see a couple of speakers up there! Are they the source of this evil influence?<br>
Augur of Destiny, should I destroy them? Make your choice!<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Do it. That should bring the rest of you back to normal!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Z43：</span><br>
Drat! I can't reach them! And I mustn't unleash cannon fire in a classroom!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Leonardo da Vinci：</span><br>
Hold up! I think you can deal with the speakers without breaking them!<br>
The music is the problem, right? So just disrupt the music so it can't influence them!<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
(That's not a bad idea... All she needs to do is play an instrument to alter the melody!)<br>
Z43, do you know how to play an instrument?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Z43：</span><br>
No, that's beyond my capa– Whoa, take it easy, Shinano! People are gonna get hurt if you jump on them like that!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Shinano-chan：</span><br>
This one heard the Commander speaking! Come here and let us play!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Z43：</span><br>
Settle down! Take a seat and cool off or something! The Commander will be here soon enough!<br>
Ugh, so I just need to disrupt the music, right? I'll try!<br>
A speaker set, a microphone... Hmm... Behold, Augur of Destiny! I shall pull our comrades back up from the deep, dark abyss!<br>
Ahem...<br>
<br>
Z43 first clears her throat, then picks up the microphone and starts singing.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Z43：</span><br>
Wings of dark, burn so briiight♪ Come to me, embrace the liiight♪ Face your fears, we'll be alriiight♪<br>
{{折叠面板|内容结束}}

{{折叠面板|标题=Band Together|选项=3|主框=1|样式=primary|展开=是}}
<br>
Z43 becomes engrossed by her own singing. As her song comes to an end, the girls regain their senses one by one.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Little Friedrich：</span><br>
Hm? I could swear I heard the strangest melody just now... Well, perhaps "melody" is glorifying it somewhat.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Lena：</span><br>
My head feels all weird... Oh no! And my hair's such a mess, too!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Shinano-chan：</span><br>
I feel as though I had a nightmare...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Helena：</span><br>
Sounds like that weird influence is wearing off. Phew... I knew something was wrong with that melody.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Well done, Z43. Is everyone back to normal now?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Z43：</span><br>
*pant*... *pant*... Yeah! Man, I really sang my heart out there...<br>
Er, I mean! Augur of Destiny, now you have witnessed my might – the might of a REBEL!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Little Prinz Eugen：</span><br>
Is that the Commander's voice I hear? Where are you, Commander? Are you spying on us from your office?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">U-31：</span><br>
Hey, back off, little lady. The only person the Commander's watching is me, anyway. Right, Commander?<br>
<br>
U-31 flips the camera around and covers the screen with her ear-to-ear grin. Immediately, all the little shipgirls gather around and wave to me. Well, all except for one...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Lena：</span><br>
My hair is super messy! I'm not letting the Commander see me like this!<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Hi there. I'm glad you girls are all okay.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Enterprise：</span><br>
Commander, you should probably order them to get out of there, now. The mind influence might have worn off, but the music's still playing, so...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Prinz Eugen：</span><br>
Well, hello. I didn't know you were here, Enterprise.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Enterprise：</span><br>
Of course I am. This is a big deal. I can't just sit by and watch, can I?<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
U-31, could you open the door? Everyone else, cover your ears and get out of there.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">U-31：</span><br>
Roger-roger.<br>
<br>
U-31 walks up to the door and tries to open it, but it won't budge no matter what she tries – strange, as it opened easily on the way in.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">U-31：</span><br>
That's... weird. I can't get the door open.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Leonardo da Vinci：</span><br>
Hmm, maybe it's got something to do with that mind influence? The song's still playing, so maybe it's subconsciously preventing you from leaving.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Fu Shun：</span><br>
Looks like you'll have to blow your way out after all. Take aim at the speakers and let 'er rip!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Friedrich Carl：</span><br>
Let's not be hasty. Disrupting the melody worked once, and I think it might just work again.<br>
See the colorful notes on the blackboard? I think they're the key.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Lena：</span><br>
She's right... Firing your cannons might blow up the whole classroom.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Z43：</span><br>
My throat is dry as a bone, so please don't make me sing again.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Li'l Sandy：</span><br>
I've got it! Let's all team up and form a band!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Eldridge：</span><br>
A band? Sounds... fun.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Little Prinz Eugen：</span><br>
Sure, but Friedrich is the only one here who knows music.<br>
And even then, she's more about conducting it than playing it...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Little Friedrich：</span><br>
I could teach you basic music theory, but I don't think we have time for that.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Friedrich der Große：</span><br>
Music is all about soul.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Friedrich... er, grown Friedrich is right. Just play with your heart and it'll be fine.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Li'l Sandy：</span><br>
Yippee! It's time for music! I call dibs on the drums!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Taihou-chan：</span><br>
What kind of song should we play, though?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Z43：</span><br>
Simple. A song befitting a rebel such as I – a heavy metal song!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">U-31：</span><br>
Pass. That stuff makes my ears hurt.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Eldridge：</span><br>
Heavy metal... exhausting. Pick something else.<br>
<br>
Unable to reach any kind of consensus, the girls turned to the camera and asked us for advice.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Long Island：</span><br>
You should play whatever kind of song you want. Metal, a nursery rhyme, folk, pop, whatever.<br>
What matters is that you have fun. Remember: it just has to disrupt the melody!<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Exactly. It doesn't have to be perfect.<br>
<span style="color:#ff9b93;">PA System：</span><br>
BZZT... CULTIVATING INTERESTS... BZZT... HAVING FUN ABOVE ALL... BZZT...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">U-31：</span><br>
Hey, did you hear that voice? I think someone's monitoring us!<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Any guesses as to who it is?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Chkalov：</span><br>
No idea. They've applied a filter, making it impossible to infer anything.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Little Prinz Eugen：</span><br>
What the...? Whuah?! Where'd all these things come from?!<br>
<span style="color:#ff9b93;">Meowfficer Bust of Hobbies：</span><br>
Meow!<br>
Meow-meow!<br>
Meow meow meeeow!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Soobrazitelny：</span><br>
They superficially resemble Meowfficers, but these bust creatures are clearly something else entirely.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ingraham：</span><br>
Is this that cat's handiwork again? Akashi, come here!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Akashi：</span><br>
Y-yes, nya?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Shinano ：</span><br>
Have you something to do with this?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Akashi：</span><br>
No, nya! I swear on my shop's name I don't know anything, nya!<br>
<span style="color:#ff9b93;">Meowfficer Bust of Hobbies：</span><br>
Meow meow meeeow!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Little Prinz Eugen：</span><br>
Now they're... waving instruments around.<br>
I think they want to challenge us to a play-off.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Li'l Sandy：</span><br>
Oh yeah? The Twinkling Little Stars are gonna rock their world!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Little Friedrich：</span><br>
Together, now! Let us play!<br>
<br>
<br>
As the music dies down, the speakers cease playing that strange melody. Stranger yet, the odd Meowfficers all stop moving at the same time as well.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Li'l Sandy：</span><br>
Whaddya think, Commander? Am I cut out to be an idol?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">U-31：</span><br>
Please, if anyone's cut out for that, it's me! I know the Commander agrees.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Z43：</span><br>
Mwahaha! With rock as the medium, my power has been unleashed!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Little Prinz Eugen：</span><br>
Whew... I think we all played pretty well.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Little Friedrich：</span><br>
Goodness...<br>
The fiery hot emotion packed into every beat... There was frankly too much of it for my tastes.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
At any rate, you're safe now. What happened to those Meowfficer busts?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">U-31：</span><br>
I think they... went bust. But seriously, they turned back into normal statues.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Hmm. I think that weird melody and those busts are connected, I'm just not sure how yet.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Akagi：</span><br>
Regardless, there's no time to waste. I propose you split up – one team can investigate those Meowfficers, the other can move forward with the rescue mission.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Good idea. We've found and rescued a few people, so splitting up here would be more efficient.<br>
Twinkling Little Stars, check the arts building for anyone else that needs rescue, then head to the main school building and continue the mission.<br>
Everyone else, see if you can find out anything about those strange Meowfficers.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Li'l Sandy：</span><br>
Rogery-dodgery-doo!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Little Friedrich：</span><br>
Worry not, my child. We shall handle it.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Li'l Sandy：</span><br>
Hang on a sec! You girls haven't got a team name yet! You HAVE to have one!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Little Prinz Eugen：</span><br>
Why? What do we need a name for?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Lena：</span><br>
I think it'd be nice to have. It'll make us feel more like a team.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Shinano-chan：</span><br>
You may decide the name. Meanwhilst, this one shall sleep... Zzz...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Li'l Sandy：</span><br>
Ooh, I've got a good one!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Little Friedrich：</span><br>
What, pray tell?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Li'l Sandy：</span><br>
"The Sparkly Kitties!"<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Little Prinz Eugen：</span><br>
Can we veto that?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Li'l Sandy：</span><br>
Nuh-uh! Your name's set in stone now!<br>
Okay, let's move, girls! Last team to finish their mission is a bunch of rotten eggs!<br>
Also, the Commander's probably gonna shower the winning team with rewards!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Lena：</span><br>
R-rewards? Okay! The Sparkly Kitties WILL win!<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
(Why is this a competition now? And why am I obliged to reward the winner?)<br>
(Well, if it motivates them...)<br>
<br>
After reminding them numerous times to be careful, I order both teams to set upon their respective tasks.<br>

<br>
The Twinkling Little Stars went straight for the school building and started looking around. In the end, they only found anomalous activity in one classroom.<br>
Now they stand at the firmly shut door. Something on the other side is making an eerie scratching noise.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Z43：</span><br>
Those damned Dark Requiem conspirators are employing the Abyssal Noise! However, they are sorely mistaken if they think that will scare me again!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">U-31：</span><br>
Heh. "Again"? So it has scared you before.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Z43：</span><br>
H-hey! "Scared" is a strong word! I was only mildly perturbed! Come on, let us head in!<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Settle down, Z43. Stay in formation and move in carefully.<br>
<br>
U-31 cautiously opens the door. Inside the classroom, there is a massive stack of wooden blocks, so tall it even towers above the girls.<br>
At the top stands a lone Meowfficer bust, writing something on the blackboard. This is the source of that eerie scratching sound.<br>
<span style="color:#ff9b93;">Meowfficer Bust of Playtime：</span><br>
Meow! Mreow!<br>
<br>
As soon as the Meowfficer becomes aware of the girls, it jumps inside the heap of wooden blocks and hides.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Li'l Sandy：</span><br>
Commander! Found another one of those Meowfficer busts!<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Go after it!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Z43：</span><br>
Try as you might, evil spirit! My demon eye has already seen where you went in this blazing sea of endless nothingness!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">U-31：</span><br>
Yeah, we all know where it is – in the block pile. Can we start looking now?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Z43：</span><br>
Oh. Right...<br>
<br>
The team climbs onto the pile and starts looking for the sneaky Meowfficer.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Eldridge：</span><br>
Dowsing rod... No response.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Li'l Sandy：</span><br>
I've got something! Feels soft to the touch... It's gotta be the Meowfficer's hat!<br>
<br>
Li'l Sandy pulled out the thing under the blocks with such force that she lost her balance and fell flat on her butt.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Little Bel：</span><br>
Please don't pull on my apron! I don't want it to tear!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Li'l Sandy：</span><br>
Oh, it's Little Bel! Not the catch I was expecting, but I'll take it.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Eldridge：</span><br>
Long... Silky... Tail?<br>
<br>
Eldridge, meanwhile, uproots something else as well.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Little Formidable：</span><br>
My word! Don't pull on a lady's hair – it's so uncouth!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">U-31：</span><br>
I feel something firm! Those Meowfficer busts look pretty hard, so this has GOT to be the one!<br>
<br>
U-31 pulls out the object from among the wooden blocks.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Little Spee：</span><br>
Sorry. That's just my iron claw.<br>
<br>
While they failed to find the Meowfficer, they did manage to find Little Bel, Little Formidable, and Little Spee.<br>
After a short break, the girls all attempt to leave the classroom. Much like last time, though, the door has fused itself shut with the walls.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">U-31：</span><br>
Well, we're doing this again. The key to getting out should be somewhere in here.<br>
Commander, I'll take the camera for a tour around the room. Tell me if you see anything interesting.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
(Hmm... As far as clues go, all we really have are the wooden blocks and the writing the Meowfficer left on the blackboard.)<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Little Bel：</span><br>
The blackboard says, "Building with blocks," and there's a drawing of them stacked atop each other.<br>
Supposing that you must satisfy a condition before you may leave, perhaps we should start by arranging the blocks as shown in the drawing.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
(They didn't need to follow a template in the music room, they just played whatever they wanted.)<br>
(If this follows the same rule, shouldn't they just stack the blocks however they want?)<br>
First, I want to try something. All of you, go ahead and arrange the blocks however you like.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Li'l Sandy：</span><br>
However we like, huh?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Eldridge：</span><br>
Blocks... Like... Commander...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Little Spee：</span><br>
We like the Commander more than anyone else, so...<br>
Let's build a wooden block Commander!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Z43：</span><br>
I must admit, I do like the Commander more than my wings of dark...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Taihou-chan：</span><br>
Wooow. You hear that, my Commander? You're adored by all!<br>
I'm behind this idea. I will make a great wooden block statue to demonstrate my love!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">U-31：</span><br>
(Ruh-roh. Sounds like I'll need to "keep a close eye" on the Commander for the near future...)<br>
(But right now, it's building time. Gotta be quick so I can be where I'm needed – by the Commander's side!)<br>
<br>
The little shipgirls quickly got to work. It quickly dawned on them how fun the act of stacking blocks actually was.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Little Spee：</span><br>
Now to put a heart in the Commander's hands...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Little Formidable：</span><br>
I say, this pose is somewhat lacking in grace. The hands should be more like... this! Even a statue should be well-mannered.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Z43：</span><br>
I've found you, long-lost wing! I shall now return you to where you belong – on the Commander's back!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">U-31：</span><br>
Wait, the hair's going the wrong way! This bit should go left, and this part goes right.<br>
<br>
With much merry collaboration, the girls finish their blocky statue of me.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Li'l Sandy：</span><br>
Aaand done! Look and be amazed, Commander! We made a mega version of you!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Bristol：</span><br>
Whoa! That Mega-Mander is peak art!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Alfredo Oriani：</span><br>
I never knew you put any points into art appreciation.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Bristol：</span><br>
I mean, just look at that warped orb in the Commander's hands! It's a metaphor for the forbidden knowledge endowed to our supremely wise leader!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Li'l Sandy：</span><br>
Uhh... that's a heart.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Bristol：</span><br>
Wh-what? A... heart?<br>
Then explain those peculiar ornaments on the statue's back! What arcane unknowns do they represent?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Little Spee：</span><br>
Those are angel wings...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Bristol：</span><br>
A-angel wings... Ahaha...<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Is THIS really how you all view me?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Li'l Sandy：</span><br>
More or less! Looks pretty cute, doesn't it?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Little Spee：</span><br>
There's still one block left... What should we do with it?<br>
It LOOKS Like a Meowfficer, so we could put it on the shoulder like a pet.<br>
<br>
Little Spee puts down the final "block" – which then comes to life.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Li'l Sandy：</span><br>
Hey! That's no block, that's the Meowfficer bust!<br>
<span style="color:#ff9b93;">PA System：</span><br>
BZZT... PLAY LIKE INNOCENT CHILDREN... BZZT... FIND YOUR OWN HOBBY...<br>
<span style="color:#ff9b93;">Meowfficer Bust of Playtime：</span><br>
Meow! Mreow!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Little Spee：</span><br>
Let's fight it using blocks!<br>
<br>
<br>
*rumble*...<br>
Mega Commander shatters the Meowfficer busts' Mega-Meowfficer stack with a powerful tackle.<br>
With that, the classroom door opens, and the Meowfficer busts turn back into lifeless stone.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Z43：</span><br>
Heheh! The Twinkling Little Stars can't be beaten!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">U-31：</span><br>
The school building rescue mission is a success! Next up...<br>
<br>
*rumble*...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Little Spee：</span><br>
A-an earthquake?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Little Formidable：</span><br>
Oh, no... What's happening? I can't maintain... proper Royal Lady... posture?!<br>
<br>
There's a loud rumble as the video feed shakes violently, as if an earthquake is really occurring.<br>
Nothing is happening in the makeshift command center outside the academy.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
(Could it be... something's happening inside the school building?)<br>
Everyone, get out of that classroom and take shelter in an open space!<br>
{{折叠面板|内容结束}}

{{折叠面板|标题=Fight on the Athletic Field|选项=5|主框=1|样式=primary|展开=是}}
<br>
The rumbling and shaking in the camera feed still hasn't stopped.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">U-31：</span><br>
It's even worse on the athletic field! Commander, what do we do?<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Above all else, stay calm. Once you've secured your own safety, confirm that there's nothing around you that could trigger anything worse–<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Z47：</span><br>
AAAAH! HELP MEEE!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Little Spee：</span><br>
Is that... Z47?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Z43：</span><br>
Renown, Zeppelin, and Cleveland, too...?<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
U-31, spin the camera toward them for me.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">U-31：</span><br>
Roger-dodger!<br>
<br>
On the other end of the field, Z47 is running desperately on a moving track reminiscent of a treadmill.<br>
On the inside of the track are Little Renown, Zeppy, and Clevelad. They're surprised and relieved to see the Twinkling Little Stars.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
(The track on the field is moving... This must be what caused the earthquake.)<br>
(Based on how we've solved the other problems so far, there must be some condition we need to meet in order to stop it.)<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Z43：</span><br>
A rebel would never abandon her imprisoned comrades! I'm on my way!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">U-31：</span><br>
Hey, wait!<br>
<br>
U-31's cries fall on deaf ears. Z43 runs onto the track thoughtlessly... and gets stuck running on it just like Z47.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Z43：</span><br>
Aaaagh! Heeelp!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Clevelad：</span><br>
*sigh*... Things are just getting worse...<br>
But one destined to be a Solomon Knight mustn't be afraid of a moving track! Allow me to–<br>
<br>
Clevelad tries to run in, too, but Zeppy and Little Renown manage to stop her after seeing the horrors that Z43 fell into.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Zeppy：</span><br>
Idiot! If you go, you'll just be the third one stuck on it!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Clevelad：</span><br>
Th-that doesn't mean I can stand idly by and let it happen...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Fu Shun：</span><br>
We have no other choice. Let's blow this field to smithereens with our cannons!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Fei Yuen：</span><br>
Our friends are stuck on that track! Ever heard the words "friendly fire"?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Fu Shun：</span><br>
Just use small-caliber cannons!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Fei Yuen：</span><br>
Ooh. Now we're cooking with gas!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">An Shan：</span><br>
No, you are NOT!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Zeppy：</span><br>
...I have an idea!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Clevelad：</span><br>
What is it?<br>
<br>
Zeppy grabs Clevelad by the waist and lifts her up high above.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Clevelad：</span><br>
Eep! Wh-what are you doing?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Zeppy：</span><br>
Now...<br>
<br>
Then, she starts spinning Clevelad around at incredible speed!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Clevelad：</span><br>
Huh? W-wait...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Zeppy：</span><br>
Take thiiis!<br>
<br>
KABOOOOM!<br>
After being fired like a missile, Clevelad strikes Z47 and Z43. The momentum throws all three of them off the track.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Zeppy：</span><br>
Phew... That's another one solved!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Graf Zeppelin：</span><br>
Hmm... Creative, to be sure.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Clevelad：</span><br>
At least tell me first... Ouchies.<br>
So, did you all come here to check out the situation at the academy? While relaying everything to the outside with that camera?<br>
Commandeeer! Can you hear meee?<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Yeah, I can hear you. What in the world happened before the investigation team came in?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Clevelad：</span><br>
Well... We don't really know, either!<br>
The classroom door suddenly wouldn't open, and weird Meowfficers started running through the halls...<br>
When we finally got the door open and came to check out the field, the track started moving out of nowhere...<br>
And you saw how that turned out.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Little Bel：</span><br>
If we don't do something about this track, the whole campus could get destroyed by the earthquakes...<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Agreed. We have to stop that track ASAP.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Fu Shun：</span><br>
Commander, there's nobody left on it. Let's fire–<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">An Shan：</span><br>
FU SHUN!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Fu Shun：</span><br>
Okay, sorry... Ow, I said I'm sorry! Ow, ouch! H-have mercy on my ear!<br>
<span style="color:#ff9b93;">PA System：</span><br>
BZZT... HAPPY AND ENERGETIC... BZZT... TREASURE YOUR YOUTH...<br>
<span style="color:#ff9b93;">Meowfficer Bust of Exercise：</span><br>
Meow! Mreow!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">U-31：</span><br>
Hahah! I get it. It's a track-and-field competition they want!<br>
Let's show them just how athletic we can be!<br>
<br>
<br>
After 105 games, the Meowfficer busts have suffered a total defeat.<br>
The failed Meowfficers returned to stone busts, and the track finally stopped moving.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Clevelad：</span><br>
*pant*... *pant*... Now do you see the power of a future Solomon Knight?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Little Renown：</span><br>
I would never lose a fair contest!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Li'l Sandy：</span><br>
Woohoo! We are number one!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">U-31：</span><br>
So next would be...<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
You all must be tired after all that running. Take a break before you continue your investigation.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">U-31：</span><br>
Ahaha♡ You're too sweet, Commander! I thought you might say that~<br>
<br>
The shipgirls enjoy a moment's respite on the field.<br>
Though, of course, not all of them are happy to just relax. The little shipgirls quickly tire of sitting around and resort to playing together.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
(Things haven't been resolved yet, but... there's nothing wrong with taking a nice break.)<br>
<br>
I change my communication line from the public channel to a private channel, so as not to disturb their rest.<br>
While her friends all enjoy the many play facilities near the track, Z47 sits on the seesaw alone and plays with her phone.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Z47? You don't want to play with them?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Z47：</span><br>
If you want me to, Mandy... I'll put my phone away...<br>
But I don't know what to talk about with them... You're not here, either.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
I may not be there, but thanks to our communication lines, it's like I am.<br>
Your calls for help also helped resolve the situation before it could take a turn for the worse.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Z47：</span><br>
Do you mean that? I thought you left me on read, even if it was just because of the stuff going on...<br>
But my message really helped...<br>
Can I have a reward?<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Sure. Want me to play some phone games with you? Or I could join you on the seesaw when this is all over.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Z47：</span><br>
Alone with you here, when it's all over...<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Sure. It's a promise.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Z47：</span><br>
Okay. When the time comes, you better not act like you forgot.<br>
<br>
I switch back to the public channel and reevaluate the situation.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
(The academy gate, classrooms, and field tracks are all basic infrastructure that any school should have.)<br>
(All of the occurrences so far have been related to innocence and fun. Save for the gate, every area where they happened have had Meowfficer busts present.)<br>
<br>
As I unravel things, I recall a request I'd approved several days ago.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
(The Academy Companion System development plan... Who requested that? It was Yuubari.)<br>
(Yuubari was also on the missing persons list.)<br>
(Did that companion system cause everything that's happening right now?)<br>

<br>
Rest time ends, and the shipgirls resume the rescue operation.<br>
The girls speculate that there might be more little shipgirls trapped in the office building.<br>
In order to increase the efficiency of the search, we decide they should split into two groups again.<br>
The Twinkling Little Stars infiltrate from the main entrance, while the others form a team called Sparkling Knight and circle around the back of the admin building.<br>
Admin Building<br>
The investigation team's chit-chat dies down over time, probably either because it's dark or because they're tired from the search.<br>
*tap*... *tap*...<br>
During a moment of silence, footsteps can be heard from the dark hallway.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Z43：</span><br>
Is that sound...<br>
Eeeek! I-it's Dark Requiem!<br>
You'd better keep your distance! I'm a REBEL, you know!<br>
<br>
Before the footsteps can round the corner, Z43 leaps to the front of the group.<br>
Her scream echoes through the halls, prompting U-31 and the little ships to rush over. Alvitr and Duke of York come into view of the camera.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Alvitr：</span><br>
We came here because we heard voices. I had no idea it would be you...<br>
Sorry for scaring you.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Duke of York：</span><br>
I guess we weren't cautious enough. We really didn't mean to give you such a fright.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">U-31：</span><br>
Honestly, Z43's screaming was what really scared us...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Alvitr：</span><br>
So, why are you all here? What's the situation like outside?<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Allow me to explain.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Alvitr：</span><br>
I see. A lot has happened in so little time.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
What about things on your end? Is the admin building safe?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Alvitr：</span><br>
Well, we've run into our fair share of troubles here.<br>
Follow me to the staff office. I think you'll be able to see the problem there.<br>
<br>
Office Building - Staff Office<br>
<span style="color:#ff9b93;">Meowfficer Bust of Studying：</span><br>
Meow meow meeeow!<br>
<br>
Alvitr opens the door to the staff office, revealing a Meowfficer bust playground.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">U-31：</span><br>
Wh-what's going on here?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Alvitr：</span><br>
See for yourself. These pipsqueaks appeared out of nowhere and took over the office.<br>
They don't seem malicious... but I also doubt they plan to leave any time soon.<br>
<br>
Alvitr's right. The Meowfficers are holding up signs with questions on them and running around the room in a line.<br>
On closer inspection, there are more signs piled up in the corner of the room.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Is this their way of holding a test, or...?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Alvitr：</span><br>
Well... I did say they're not malicious, but for some reason, they really want to quiz us.<br>
As for the ones in the corner, we answered those already since we were bored and annoyed...<br>
<span style="color:#ff9b93;">Meowfficer Bust of Studying：</span><br>
Meow meow meeeow!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Eldridge：</span><br>
They're... quizzing us...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Li'l Sandy：</span><br>
I get it! So they want us to answer their questions, too!<br>
<br>
Li'l Sandy accepts a quiz sheet, takes a look at it, and immediately hands it to Z43.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Li'l Sandy：</span><br>
Easy stuff! This isn't even worth wasting the leader's time! My Twinkling Little Stars can handle this.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Z43：</span><br>
Huh? M-me...? Hmph! My demon eye has already divined the answer... For the sake of fairness, I'd best not participate!<br>
Eldridge! I leave this great responsibility in your capable hands!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Taihou-chan：</span><br>
If you don't want to do it, I'll do it. The Commander is watching, after all.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Eldridge：</span><br>
...No. This is easy...<br>
Done.<br>
<br>
Eldridge answers the quiz with awesome speed, hands it in to the Meowfficer bust, and has it check her work.<br>
<span style="color:#ff9b93;">Meowfficer Bust of Studying：</span><br>
Meow meow!<br>
<br>
It leaps into the air happily... and splits in two!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Zuikaku：</span><br>
They multiplied!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Shoukaku：</span><br>
No wonder there are so many... It's like they're doing mitosis.<br>
<br>
The two new Meowfficers bring in new quiz sheets.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Z43：</span><br>
More of them? At this rate, we'll never finish!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">U-31：</span><br>
I'm starting to think that answering their questions will just lead to more questions.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Hmm... Okay, so solving the questions as they're given to us isn't enough.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Clemenceau：</span><br>
Rather... Perhaps giving the correct answers is the wrong idea in itself?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Alvitr：</span><br>
Are you saying we should give incorrect answers on purpose?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">U-31：</span><br>
Good idea. Leave it to me~<br>
<br>
U-31 takes a quiz sheet, draws a turtle on it instead of writing an answer, and gives it back to the Meowfficer bust.<br>
<span style="color:#ff9b93;">Meowfficer Bust of Studying：</span><br>
MREEEOW!<br>
<br>
Infuriated, the Meowfficer jumps up and headbutts her. When it lands, it splits into two just like it would've if she'd answered correctly.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">U-31：</span><br>
Rrrgh... That hurt!<br>
Ugh! If it doesn't matter whether we're right or wrong, how about we just ignore them?<br>
They seem harmless, and you were able to get out of this room without bothering with them, so...<br>
<br>
U-31 tries to open the door to prove it, but unlike when they came in, it won't budge an inch no matter how she tries.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">U-31：</span><br>
Huh... That's weird. Alvitr was able to get out just fine!<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
(I knew it. We need to solve the problem here before we can leave, too.)<br>
(Stopping them from cloning themselves... It must be related to innocence and fun.)<br>
(Whether they answer right has no relation to those things. And the result is effectively the same if you get them wrong on purpose...)<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Akagi：</span><br>
Hmph, what a bother this all is. They ask you questions – is it not reasonable to assume you must ANSWER them?<br>
Why don't we just burn all of these sheets at this rate?<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
That makes sense... I was totally blind to that.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Akagi：</span><br>
Oh? So you agree, Commander? Taihou-chan, ready a fire.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Hold it, hold it! That's not what I meant!<br>
I was saying that it's not about just answering the questions. JUST answering the questions isn't enough.<br>
All work and no play makes you a dull shipgirl. Get what I mean?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Anchorage：</span><br>
All work and no play...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Bismarck：</span><br>
Heheh, I understand.<br>
Thanks to someone, the work is done. Now all that's left is to play, is that it?<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Exactly. That's enough work. Relax and play, girls!<br>

{{折叠面板|标题=Let's Get Mischievous!|选项=7|主框=1|样式=primary|展开=是}}
<br>
While the girls play, almost every Meowfficer in the staff room turns back into busts.<br>
But a few of them continue to hold their signs up.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
(The Twinkling Little Stars have played plenty by now, but there are still Meowfficers. Have we overlooked something?)<br>
<span style="color:#ff9b93;">Meowfficer Bust of Studying：</span><br>
Meow... Meow!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Taihou-chan：</span><br>
Ugh, these things are so annoying. Are they mad, or what?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Z43：</span><br>
Huh? They STILL want us to answer questions?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Alvitr：</span><br>
All work makes one a dull shipgirl, yes, but that doesn't mean we can be all play either.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Duke of York：</span><br>
But if we keep answering questions, the Meowfficers will multiply again. That'll put all of our work playing to waste.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Enterprise：</span><br>
How about a more simple method? Every problem until now, the Meowfficers hid or kept you away from them.<br>
But all of the Meowfficers causing the problem in the staff room are IN the staff room. Blow them up, and you might have your way out.<br>
Melee combat with special gear oughta keep the damages to the facility to a minimum.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Hornet：</span><br>
Enty, are you serious about this? Those Meowfficers are kinda cute, so...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Akashi：</span><br>
They're ripe for research, too, nya!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Enterprise：</span><br>
We need to prioritize rescuing the girls who are still trapped. Commander, it's time for swift decision-making.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Hmm...<br>

<br>
Eventually, the team managed to solve the problem in the admin building.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">U-31：</span><br>
Commander, we've finished investigating all of the main facilities in the academy now. Next–<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ingraham：</span><br>
Sorry to interrupt. Commander, I have an urgent report.<br>
The Academy Companion System terminal has been found inside the campus control room.<br>
Yuubari should be there, too.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
(The control room... It seems likely that's where this all began.)<br>
Contact the two investigation teams and have them meet up there.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">U-31：</span><br>
Roger~<br>
<br>
Little Academy - Control Room<br>
In the control room, there's a giant screen flickering with colorful static while it displays the same slogan as the banner at the gate.<br>
"A little paradise for the pure, innocent, and mischievous."<br>
In front of the control panel, a giant Meowfficer bust stands with an intimidating blue gleam in its eyes.<br>
And the one facing that Meowfficer...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">U-31：</span><br>
It's Yuubari! Commander, we found her!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Yuubari：</span><br>
Thank goodness... You're all here!<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Yuubari. How's the situation in there?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Yuubari：</span><br>
It's still a stalemate... But with your help, we can get through this danger, no problem.<br>
<br>
Wary of the giant Meowfficer bust, she briefly explains the situation.<br>
Today is routine maintenance of the Academy Companion System. When she shut it down to perform said maintenance, everything went haywire.<br>
When it should've shut down, the system began an abnormal startup and started producing endless Meowfficer busts.<br>
When Yuubari was forced to focus on the production issue, something took advantage of the opening to steal her toolbox.<br>
Then, the anomaly appeared and covered the entire academy. That was when we at the port learned about it.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
It's evident that the Meowfficer right there is the one that stole your toolbox and made a mess of everything.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Yuubari：</span><br>
Yeah. By the time I realized it, it was too late...<br>
But the Companion System has one final safety feature.<br>
<br>
She gestures at the lever she's holding tightly in one hand.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Yuubari：</span><br>
When I pull this lever, unless the correct sequence of buttons is pressed in five seconds, the Companion System's power source will be forcibly cut off.<br>
Alternatively, if it tries to overload the Companion System to expand this special space, I'll need to pull this lever in order to nullify the overload.<br>
So... As you can see, whoever acts first loses in this state.<br>
<span style="color:#ff9b93;">Meowfficer Bust of Innocence：</span><br>
MREEEEOW!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">U-31：</span><br>
Heheh, I see~<br>
So basically, it's up to our interference to break the stalemate!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Little Friedrich：</span><br>
Mission objective: defeat the crazy Meowfficer bust.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Clevelad：</span><br>
If we take that thing down, we can all go home!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Shinano-chan：</span><br>
At home... Soft, comfy bed, and the Commander...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Li'l Sandy：</span><br>
Let's go for it, everyone!<br>
{{折叠面板|内容结束}}

{{折叠面板|标题=Innocence Eternal|选项=9|主框=1|样式=primary|展开=是}}
<br>
When the first, final, and most powerful Meowfficer bust is defeated, the Mirror Sea loses its core and collapses.<br>
Yuubari manages to safely shut down the Academy Companion System, too.<br>
Some time after, at Little Academy...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Bristol：</span><br>
Great work, Commander. You solved the school's problems in the blink of an eye!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Fu Shun：</span><br>
Heheh~ I think you all have the makings of adventurers!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Z47：</span><br>
Tiiired... I wanna lie down and scroll on my phone for hours now.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">U-31：</span><br>
I can finally go back to guarding the Commander. Heheh~ I need a whiff so bad right now~<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Taihou-chan：</span><br>
Stay away from the Commander, you!<br>
<br>
While everyone rejoices over our victory, their promised reward is brought to them.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Dunkerque：</span><br>
Thank you all for waiting. The Commander ordered this dessert be made to celebrate your triumphant return.<br>
<br>
Exquisitely decorated cakes and macarons are given to the shipgirls.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Zeppy：</span><br>
Mmm! I wanna eat tasty cake every day!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Lena：</span><br>
Ugh... I'd put on so much weight, but... It's too good! Commander, eat with me!<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Eat slowly, now. You don't want to choke. Enterprise and the others went to get drinks, so make sure you all get one.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Little Formidable：</span><br>
Okaaay♪<br>
<br>
Thus, we begin a simple victory celebration on the academy campus.<br>
Meanwhile, in the control room...<br>
Yuubari is hard at work on the Academy Companion System.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Yuubari：</span><br>
Man... I can't believe a little bit of erroneous code in the companion module drove the whole system crazy.<br>
It forced missions on them all, and it even made Meowfficer busts to supervise them...<br>
A program meant to guide people and help them enjoy their academy life became overly emotional and forced them to do things they didn't want to do...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ingraham：</span><br>
Count your lucky stars that nobody got hurt.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Soobrazitelny：</span><br>
Ugh... Maintenance, updates... Too much to do.<br>
<br>
Soft sunlight filters in through the window, followed by the voices and giggles of the little shipgirls.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Yuubari：</span><br>
It doesn't matter how much work it takes.<br>
I hope you haven't forgotten the point of this system.<br>
<br>
Yuubari recalls how the little shipgirls visited her workshop not long ago.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Lena：</span><br>
Yuubari, can I ask you a favor?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Yuubari：</span><br>
What is it? I'm no good at brushing others' hair.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Clevelad：</span><br>
The Commander and older shipgirls said they'd come to the academy when they could make time.<br>
Yuubari, can you make a guidance system that'll show them how fun our school can be?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Yuubari：</span><br>
It's here to help make their every day as happy and fun as can be, after all.<br>
<br>
END<br>

<br>
A short time after the start of the victory celebration, I remember something I'd totally forgotten.<br>
Due to the events in the control room, I still haven't finished doing a head count of the rescuees.<br>
Now that I'm looking again, it seems Illustrious is still somewhere in the academy.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">{playername}：</span><br>
(Hmm... I'll let the others rest and go look for her myself.)<br>
<br>
Before long, I find her in a prep room.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Illustrious：</span><br>
Oh, Commander? Is something the matter? You look awfully tense.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">{playername}：</span><br>
Hmm? Uh, have you not run into anything weird or heard any strange sounds?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Illustrious：</span><br>
Strange sounds, you say?<br>
She blushes a little awkwardly.<br>
Are you saying you... heard something through the door?<br>
Well, it's not a big deal. Umm, I was just practicing singing lullabies for the kids...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">{playername}：</span><br>
(It's almost as if she's been so focused on her practice here that she genuinely didn't realize anything was wrong.)<br>
(Hmm... I'll find a more appropriate time to fill her in.)<br>
Lullabies, huh?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Illustrious：</span><br>
Yes. I bought a book on childcare recently. It's the one on the desk over there.<br>
It says that learning songs to help soothe them is especially important...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">{playername}：</span><br>
Oh, I see. You've been practicing here all this time to help take better care of the kids in the academy?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Illustrious：</span><br>
Just so. Honestly, I meant to do it in secret so it would be a surprise to everyone...<br>
But doing it alone makes it impossible to get feedback on my progress...<br>
<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项1：What if you had a partner?</span>'''''<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Illustrious：</span><br>
You'd like to join me? Heehee, that's wonderful.<br>
Then I'll need a moment to think about what part you can help me with.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">{playername}：</span><br>
Aren't you just singing lullabies?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Illustrious：</span><br>
Not at all. If I was only singing, then I wouldn't need to practice here in secret.<br>
...I have an idea. Come over here for me, Commander.<br>
I go to Illustrious's side as directed. She smiles gently and puts a hand on my back.<br>
Then she pats it gently... Once, twice.<br>
How does it feel, Commander? The book said that you can calm a child quickly with slow, gentle pats on the back.<br>
I feel her soft exhales on me. Those, and her patting, are so comforting that I feel a sudden bout of sleepiness.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">{playername}：</span><br>
Yeah, that... That works pretty well...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Illustrious：</span><br>
Are you sleepy, Commander? Would you like to take a little nap in my arms?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">{playername}：</span><br>
But I'm supposed to give you feedback on your practice. I can't just fall asleep now...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Illustrious：</span><br>
Heehee, it's okay. We have plenty of time. After you wake up, we can start in earnest.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">{playername}：</span><br>
Okay...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Illustrious：</span><br>
After a moment's hesitation, I decide to take this opportunity to tell her about everything that happened today.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">{playername}：</span><br>
If I don't go back soon, everyone will get worried...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Illustrious：</span><br>
I had no idea... I was so focused on my practice that I didn't notice anything had happened at all.<br>
You came looking for me because you were worried, and I just made you help me practice...<br>
She seems both embarrassed and apologetic.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">{playername}：</span><br>
I could've told you before, but I chose not to. It seemed wrong to worry you over nothing.<br>
How about we go back now? As for the rest of your practice...<br>
I know. Let's set a date.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Illustrious：</span><br>
A date?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">{playername}：</span><br>
After the party is over, I'll come back and help you with your practice. Sound good?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Illustrious：</span><br>
Heehee, sure.<br>
Once the party is over... we can go over every last little trick I've learned. Together♪<br>
