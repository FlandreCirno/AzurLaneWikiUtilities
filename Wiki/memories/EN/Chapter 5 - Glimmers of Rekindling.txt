<br>
The maritime outpost at the forefront of Operation Siren, a major counter-offensive to eliminate Siren activity in the NA Ocean, has been quiet lately.<br>
Ten days have passed, but the next phase of the large-scale assault has not started yet.<br>
The only things on the calendar are meetings, meetings, and more meetings.<br>
Though the Eagle Union's fleet is assembled and stands ready, the green light has not been given to continue the large-scale assault, and the operation's progress has slowed down considerably.<br>
As anyone who has studied the art of war knows... it is rarely a good idea to lose the initiative when on the attack.<br>
Eagle Union Outpost - 10 days earlier<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Communicator：</span><br>
(Alarms blaring)<br>
<br>
I was looking over some reports in the office when the sound of sirens blaring ripped through the air.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Enterprise：</span><br>
Sorry for bothering you this late, Commander. Are you still working?<br>
<br>
I was fine-tuning the details for the upcoming large-scale assault. As the commander, it is my responsibility to see the operation through to completion.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Enterprise：</span><br>
Earlier, there was a report that an anomalous phenomenon was seen from the maelstrom in the middle of the NA Ocean.<br>
Here's the intel that our recon team put together for us. I thought you should look over it as soon as possible.<br>
<br>
"...A large cluster of Siren facilities has been seen around the maelstrom. The facilities may directly be linked to the weather abnormalities..."<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Enterprise：</span><br>
I initially also tried to send some recons out to survey the situation, but my planes were shot down before they could gather any information.<br>
<br>
The fact that the Sirens have erected an entire complex of facilities while also not revealing their main forces is a reason for concern.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Enterprise：</span><br>
The extent of the activity we're seeing goes beyond what we predicted.<br>
<br>
"Were they poised to attack you?"<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Enterprise：</span><br>
Not yet. Just to be safe though, I raised the threat level and gathered the main fleet.<br>
<br>
"I have to meet with the Naval HQ about this. We must make preparations to face the Siren stronghold."<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Enterprise：</span><br>
Of course. By the way, there was also another emergency message from the Naval HQ. I originally was coming to let you know about it.<br>
It may be about the same thing we're talking about, but I'm getting the hunch that there might be a lot more to it.<br>
<br>
We'll find out. Regardless, the Naval HQ should be taking any measures necessary to combat this anomaly.<br>
"While I'm busy, you're in charge of defending the base, as well as collecting any information you can."<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Enterprise：</span><br>
Understood. I'll take command of the fleets patrolling the base. I'll make sure you're able to complete your work without being disturbed.<br>
<br>
I sighed to myself, knowing that everything I had been working on was just about to go out the window.<br>
I knew there would be a drawn-out debate among the higher-ups at Naval HQ, but I didn't think it'd end like this...<br>
Two approaches have been hotly debated: the first, launching a focused assault to break through the Sirens' defensive line, and the second, slowly whittling their forces down until we have them surrounded.<br>
What's more, some are requesting our capital ships be withdrawn and reassigned to do Siren research missions instead.<br>
Either way, we have too little intel to determine our best course of action... Hopefully, tomorrow, we will.<br>

<br>
I see Memphis and Sheffield are here.<br>
From what I've heard, Sheffield is joining us per secret orders from Queen Elizabeth herself.<br>
<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项1：Approach them</span>'''''<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项2：Leave them be</span>'''''<br>
<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项2）</span>'''''They're in the middle of a conversation. Let's not disturb them.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Memphis：</span><br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项2）</span>'''''Oh, Commander? There you are.<br>
<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项2）</span>'''''Well, she saw me. I might as well talk to them and hear what's up.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Sheffield：</span><br>
I leave the matter in your hands. Now if you'll excuse me...<br>
...Ah. It's good to see you, Master. I hope you've been well.<br>
Please try not to lose any sleep over Naval HQ's indecisiveness. For now, I suggest clearing your mind and getting some rest. I must go now. Farewell.<br>
<br>
Sheffield bowed to me, then left quite abruptly after offering her... advice.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Memphis：</span><br>
Working hard as always, Commander? Or just enjoying a casual stroll?<br>
<br>
"Let's say a bit of both. What were you two talking about just earlier?"<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Memphis：</span><br>
She was asking me for a favor, essentially. She wanted me to investigate something.<br>
While I don't exactly have to keep it secret from you, I'd rather wait until I have all the facts before telling you about it.<br>
<br>
"Does it have something to do with Naval HQ?"<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Memphis：</span><br>
Maybe. We'll see. Anyway, let's talk about the operation.<br>
It's strange how the Siren stronghold appearing made Naval HQ do a strategic 180. Don't you think so too?<br>
<br>
"It is strange. We need to settle on a course of action as soon as possible, but instead, they're thinking about changing the plan entirely at this stage."<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Memphis：</span><br>
Mhm. They make some... unusual decisions from time to time, but this is on a whole other level.<br>
<br>
...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Memphis：</span><br>
The operation was going swimmingly, too. We've been winning battle after battle against the Sirens, and even the Ashes.<br>
What's more, it'd be a huge morale boost for everyone if we manage to drive the Sirens out of the NA Ocean. So why stop now?<br>
<br>
"The Ashes add an element of uncertainty, but they aren't as immediately threatening as the Sirens are. I'd wager Naval HQ thinks they're a low-priority target."<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Memphis：</span><br>
There's a world of difference between our estimates of their strength and their actual capabilities, too.<br>
Considering Naval HQ aren't the ones fighting on the frontlines, our series of victories must seem inconsequential to them.<br>
And because they're in that mindset, they seem to suddenly think the best option would be to refocus our efforts towards research instead.<br>
<br>
It's like the first half of the operation went TOO well, causing Naval HQ's priorities to drastically shift from one extreme to the other.<br>
"I doubt anybody saw this sudden reversal coming."<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Memphis：</span><br>
And I doubt anybody's happy with it either. We still have to investigate the stronghold and all, but...<br>
We shipgirls just want nothing more than to take back the seas from the Sirens.<br>
Naval HQ knows that, and yet here we are.<br>
Ultimately, humanity and shipgirls have the same goal in mind, and it's a simple difference in opinion that's dividing us now...<br>
<br>
"Sheffield told me to put the whole thing aside for now. Do you think Elizabeth knows about the situation and plans to use her influence to sway Naval HQ?"<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Memphis：</span><br>
Well, as a matter of fact...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Sheffield：</span><br>
You are entirely correct.<br>
Her Majesty has been informed of your conundrum and is taking an active part in the operation.<br>
And indeed, she is going to work together with other faction leaders to attempt to persuade Naval HQ.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Memphis：</span><br>
Gosh, don't sneak up on us like that... Didn't you say you were leaving?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Sheffield：</span><br>
Yes, though I still have matters to tend to, so I will be in the area.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Memphis：</span><br>
I swear, sometimes you act like you're part of the secret service or something...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Sheffield：</span><br>
Please. I am a maid, not a spy.<br>
<br>
"Speaking of Elizabeth, I haven't seen her recently. Is she well?"<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Sheffield：</span><br>
Her Majesty has been preoccupied with other business as of late, but yes, she is doing quite well. I shall ask her to contact you at a later point.<br>
As I am but a simple maid, I know not what Her Majesty plans to do. But, if you'll allow me to conjecture...<br>
I believe she will arrange an alliance with all the other fleet leaders to put pressure on Naval HQ. Perhaps that will suffice to make them reconsider their decision.<br>
Of course, if such a plan were to come to light, it would considerably impact the Royal Navy's image.<br>
<br>
"True. Let's hope that doesn't happen."<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Sheffield：</span><br>
Indeed. To that end, I ask you to cooperate with us and play along, Master.<br>
<br>

<br>
Eagle Union Outpost - The following day<br>
Siren attacks have been getting more frequent with each passing day ever since they established their Core Sector stronghold.<br>
I don't know the purpose behind these attacks. Maybe they're trying to nip our planned offense in the bud, or they're simply gauging our strength.<br>
Whatever the case, our supply lines will be stretched too thin if we don't take the fight to them soon. Then we'll be the ones at a disadvantage.<br>
That's why, today, I'm going to take a stand and try to persuade Naval HQ.<br>
*knock knock*<br>
"Come in."<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Enterprise：</span><br>
Hey, Commander. Hope I'm not disturbing you.<br>
<br>
"Hey there, Enterprise. What is it?"<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Enterprise：</span><br>
Just here to inform you that I've created a fleet to prod the Sirens and gain intel on the size of their force in the Core Sector.<br>
<br>
"Well done. Intel on the Sirens is precisely what we'll need to convince Naval HQ."<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Enterprise：</span><br>
Yeah. We'll also need to know where they're positioned before we can go on the offensive. Two birds with one stone.<br>
<br>
I'll be able to draft an updated mission plan based on the intel as well. Even if the Sirens are more numerous than we expect, I can always request backup or arrange for an evacuation.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Enterprise：</span><br>
All there is to do now is pray Elizabeth is successful on her end.<br>
<br>
"I hope so. I heard her discussion about cooperation with the Crimson Axis is dragging on."<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Enterprise：</span><br>
...I wonder if Naval HQ will actually let us go on the offensive, even supposing we gain a good picture of the Sirens' strength.<br>
<br>
"I'll do everything I can to try to coax them, but I can't make any promises, considering how stubborn they can be."<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Enterprise：</span><br>
We're going to lose our advantage at this rate. I think we should try our luck with a daring decision, rather than being caught up in endless hours of debates.<br>
Besides, all things concerning shipgirls at the frontlines fall under your jurisdiction. You are the Commander here, after all.<br>
<br>
"You're right... I don't need anyone's approval for this. Let's save the world first, and beg for forgiveness later–– Have the fleet prepare to sortie."<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Enterprise：</span><br>
I knew we could count on you. All right, I'll see you down at the port.<br>
<br>
It seems the solution to our stalemate was staring me in the face all along...<br>

<br>
NA Ocean - Core Sector<br>
It feels like someone has been watching me ever since we set off...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Reno：</span><br>
*staaaaaare*<br>
<br>
……………… <br>
<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项1："Hey, Reno?"</span>'''''<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Reno：</span><br>
Whuah! Wh-what is it, Commander?<br>
<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项1："You seem on edge."</span>'''''<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项2："Take a deep breath."</span>'''''<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Reno：</span><br>
Oh geesh, you noticed I'm feeling nervous, huh...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Birmingham：</span><br>
It'd be hard NOT to notice when someone is staring at you nonstop.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Baltimore：</span><br>
Yeah. You could've stared a hole through the glass with that intense gaze.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Reno：</span><br>
Th-that bad? Sorry 'bout that...<br>
It's just... I'm insanely fired up to finally get to fight side-by-side with the Commander! I've been waiting for this day for ages!<br>
<br>
It's great she's so enthusiastic, but I'm not sure how to respond to that...<br>
<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项1："Someone's really excited, huh..."</span>'''''<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项2："I'm glad to hear it."</span>'''''<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项3："I've been waiting for a long time for this too."</span>'''''<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Reno：</span><br>

'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项2）</span>'''''You'll be the superhero the world needs, and I'll be your trusty sidekick! Hehehe~<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Reno：</span><br>

'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项3）</span>'''''I'm so happy to hear that, because you're like a superhero in my eyes, Commander! I'm gonna support you 110% in this upcoming battle!<br>

<span style="color:#4eb24e;">TB ：</span><br>
Analysis program synchronization complete. We will soon enter the mission zone.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Birmingham：</span><br>
It's getting easier to see through the clouds as we come closer. Looking at it now up-close, it's frightening just how huge this storm is.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Baltimore：</span><br>
Yeah. The storm we observed in the Bermuda Triangle doesn't even hold a candle to this one.<br>
The color and scale being different is one thing, it's the intensity that puts it on another level. Makes me wonder... what if it's a Singularity?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Enterprise：</span><br>
Doubtful. It doesn't really FEEL like the other Singularities we've encountered...<br>
But on the other hand, we know very little about Singularities. If this is one, that could explain why the Ashes keep showing up in these waters.<br>
At any rate, we have to eliminate all the Sirens in the area, and then–<br>
Shoot, they're coming for us! Everyone, get ready to fight!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">TB ：</span><br>
Detecting approaching Sirens. Preparing for combat is recommended.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Reno：</span><br>
(She sensed they were coming even before TB did! That's the kind of intuition that takes a thousand battles to develop!)<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Baltimore：</span><br>
There's a good chance they're controlled from a remote command center, judging by how quickly they reacted to us.<br>
<br>
"Remember, we're only here to gauge the size of their forces. Don't overextend, and avoid combat if possible."<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Enterprise：</span><br>
You heard the Commander. I'll adjust our course to keep us some distance from the eye of the storm. Only engage the Sirens if you need to!<br>

<span style="color:#4eb24e;">TB ：</span><br>
Message incoming from the forward base.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Memphis：</span><br>
Commander, we've picked up readings that suggest there are Ashes in your area. Keep your eyes peeled and be on your guard.<br>
<br>
"Another party throwing their hats into the ring, huh..."<br>
"While I have you on the line... Have you heard anything from Naval HQ yet?"<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Memphis：</span><br>
Nope, not a word so far. I'd take their silence to mean tacit permission to keep doing what you're doing.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">TB ：</span><br>
Orders received. Downloading Ashes coordinates.<br>
Analysis complete. Based on the signal characteristics, the Ashes member appears to be Hiryuu META. Displaying location on the screen.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Baltimore：</span><br>
Thank god we've managed to decrypt their signals and can actually fight back against them.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Birmingham：</span><br>
Agreed, though it's a shame we can't pinpoint their exact location yet. It doesn't help the bulky decryption machine is extremely tough to transport.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Reno：</span><br>
Maybe those scientists back at base can make it smaller somehow...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Baltimore：</span><br>
Yeah. If they could shrink it to fit inside your pocket, we could catch the Ashes out in the open and force them to confront us.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Enterprise：</span><br>
Wait. Something is off here... The only time Ashes emit signals is when they're in combat in a general area.<br>
In other words, if they're trying to stay hidden, they'd want to avoid combat as much as they can.<br>
So then why would she start a fight and reveal her location, especially so close to us? It doesn't make sense...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Baltimore：</span><br>
Seems like she's challenging us to a duel.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Birmingham：</span><br>
Alternatively, she doesn't even know we're here. Whatever the case, how do we proceed?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Enterprise：</span><br>
She's broadcasting her location to us. Even if we ignore her now, there's a good chance she'll just be back later.<br>
I say we accept her invitation and find out what she's after while we still know where she is.<br>
<br>
"I agree with Enterprise, but let me also repeat what I said earlier: avoid combat if at all possible. Strive to exchange only words with her, not shells."<br>
"But, just to be sure... TB, send a request for aerial support. Have planes circling in the sky above, ready to attack at a moment's notice."<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">TB ：</span><br>
Orders received. Sending the message to forward base.<br>
<br>
"All right. We'll set off once everyone's ready."<br>

<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Birmingham：</span><br>
There are Siren wrecks everywhere... This must be a whole fleet's worth.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Reno：</span><br>
That saves us the trouble of having to do it, I guess?<br>
<br>
...<br>
<span style="color:#ff9900;">Hiryuu META：</span><br>
...You found me. That proves you're able to track me somehow.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Baltimore：</span><br>
So you were saying "come find me" after all. Now, why are you here?<br>
<span style="color:#ff9900;">Hiryuu META：</span><br>
Why are YOU here? I'm sick and tired of being stalked all the time.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Baltimore：</span><br>
It's not too late to surrender, you know. We can work it on amicable terms.<br>
<span style="color:#ff9900;">Hiryuu META：</span><br>
Hah! Surrender to a band of fools allied with Antiochus? Not a chance in hell.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Enterprise：</span><br>
Allied with Antiochus...?<br>
<span style="color:#ff9900;">Hiryuu META：</span><br>
Have you ever even stopped to think about how they developed that coordinate tracker?<br>
Same with that thing you call "TB." Do you have any idea where that technology comes from?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Enterprise：</span><br>
What are you getting at? TB was created by Azur Lane scientists under instructions from Naval HQ.<br>
The same goes for the coordinate tracker. It's a product of human ingenuity, and we have people who've verified that.<br>
Sure, their development could have involved reverse-engineering other technologies, but that doesn't change the fact.<br>
<span style="color:#ff9900;">Hiryuu META：</span><br>
"Reverse-engineering" you call it...<br>
It's rich that you say you've "verified it." Have you seen the things you've supposedly "reverse-engineered?"<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Enterprise：</span><br>
I... Not personally, no.<br>
<span style="color:#ff9900;">Hiryuu META：</span><br>
Didn't think so. Then there's no point confusing you further with an explanation. All I'll say is this– I'm tired of being followed around.<br>
Enough talk. Let's finish it here, once and for all.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Baltimore：</span><br>
You want us to fight you? No holds barred?<br>
<span style="color:#ff9900;">Hiryuu META：</span><br>
You heard me right. You, the products of "your world's" ingenuity, and me.<br>
Come at me all at once if you so wish. You already know you don't stand a shadow of a chance against me one-on-one.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Enterprise：</span><br>
Commander... Your orders?<br>
<br>
We came here to talk, not to fight.<br>
Moreover, we are guaranteed to suffer casualties if we engage her in all-out combat with such a small fleet...<br>
<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项1："Stand down."</span>'''''<br>
<br>
"There's no need for this to get ugly. We just want to know what you've come here to do."<br>
<span style="color:#ff9900;">Hiryuu META：</span><br>
Rather than let your emotions sway you, you made the sound decision not to fight... You are a wise tactician.<br>
What wasn't wise, however, was trying to initiate conversation with someone from the Ashes in the first place.<br>
It could've cost all of you your lives, had it been Takao you pursued. Consider yourselves fortunate that you found me instead.<br>
Having that said, I did come here looking for a fight, and I don't plan on leaving without one.<br>
I won't kill you, but I will make it so you need to be towed back home. You won't be pursuing me any further.<br>
Oh, and if you're still standing by the end of it all, then I'll tell you something you're going to like. Purely out of respect for your dedication.<br>
Or you could still refuse to fight, and I'll send you to a watery grave.<br>
<br>
It sounds like she's telling us to prove ourselves worthy. The stick and carrot, except the stick is death and the carrot is a vicious beating.<br>
She's set on fighting us, that much is certain. Words won't get us out of this, only a show of our strength will.<br>
While our fleet is geared for gathering intel, not for fighting the Ashes, we still do have the support I requested from TB.<br>
<span style="color:#ff9900;">Hiryuu META：</span><br>
Well? What's it going to be, Commander?<br>
<br>
"TB, call in the airstrike support immediately. Everyone else, focus on surviving Hiryuu's assault!"<br>
<span style="color:#ff9900;">Hiryuu META：</span><br>
Airstrike support? So you did come prepared. Heh, now this will be interesting!<br>
Ah, you remind me of somebody I knew once... Now I understand why Enterprise is so fond of you.<br>
Come! Show me what you're worth!<br>

<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Enterprise：</span><br>
She's staying just barely out of range of our cannons... While she's not charging at us, she's not letting up her assault either.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Birmingham：</span><br>
Didn't she say she wanted to finish this? It feels like she's still only testing us.<br>
Wait... Is she trying to drive us off course with her attacks...? Commander, we're slowly drifting towards the center of the NA Ocean!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Reno：</span><br>
Hey, you're right! What in the world is she thinking?!<br>
Doesn't she know the Sirens are gonna attack her too if she gets too close?!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Baltimore：</span><br>
Is she planning to use the Sirens to get us off her tail? But then why did she reveal her location to us in the first place?<br>
<br>
KABOOOOM!<br>
Out of nowhere, a loud thundering crash rang out in the distance.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Baltimore：</span><br>
What?! She's provoking the Sirens with her planes?!<br>
<br>
The Sirens' retaliation came immediately. Hundreds upon hundreds of defense turrets emerged from the storm and opened fire on Hiryuu META.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Baltimore：</span><br>
That entire island... is one giant Siren facility?!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Birmingham：</span><br>
This is the heart of the Sirens' territory... It makes sense they have defense to match that.<br>
Now we have an idea of what we're up against. We can't defeat them here if we don't attack with everything we've got.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Reno：</span><br>
This proves my hunch. The Sirens excel at using abnormal weather to their advantage.<br>
We would've never found their defenses on our own... I mean, who'd intentionally steer a fleet into a storm in search of Sirens?<br>
They not only defied human common sense, they even made the storm a part of their defenses.<br>
<span style="color:#ff9900;">Hiryuu META：</span><br>
Seems I was right. You came out here to perform recon on the Sirens...<br>
In that case, think of this as my parting gift. Hope it's satisfied you.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Reno：</span><br>
...I mean, we did wanna find out the size of their force, but this is NOT what we were hoping for!<br>
<span style="color:#ff9900;">Hiryuu META：</span><br>
(Hm. The sweetness of an old memory relived is waning already...)<br>
(Curses... I thought I had rid myself of those wretched things long ago...)<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Reno：</span><br>
Commander, what do we do? We can't fight possibly fight the Sirens and Hiryuu at the same time!<br>
<span style="color:#ff9900;">Hiryuu META：</span><br>
You won't have to, because I'm content to leave it here for today. Farewell.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Baltimore：</span><br>
First you challenge us to a fight out of nowhere, then you decide to flee in the middle of it?<br>
<span style="color:#ff9900;">Hiryuu META：</span><br>
Don't get cocky with me. I'm one of the Ashes, not some damn circus clown here to amuse you.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Birmingham：</span><br>
Hiryuu's planes stopped firing at us... Are we really letting her go, just like that?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Enterprise：</span><br>
We have no other choice, Birmingham. We don't know the full extent of what Hiryuu is capable of, but we did learn a little more about her today.<br>
And besides, like Reno said, we can't possibly fight her and the Sirens at the same time.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Baltimore：</span><br>
Speaking of the Sirens, they're coming straight for us!<br>
<br>
"And a lot of them, too. I think we've probed enough for one day."<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Enterprise：</span><br>
I agree. We have a pretty good idea of the extent of their presence in the area now.<br>
If we inform Naval HQ about this, they'll take this operation a lot more seriously.<br>
I'm confident they'll make the correct decision once they realize the entire operation is at risk if we don't strike with all the power we can muster.<br>
<br>
"Exactly. But before we launch an all-out offensive, we should pay a visit to the Royal Navy's forward base."<br>

<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Long Island：</span><br>
Hey Commander, Long Island here, in charge of communications for the day. I've got some orders from Naval HQ for you~<br>
Oh, have you already arrived at the Royal Navy's outpost?<br>
<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项1："Yeah, I just arrived."</span>'''''<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Long Island：</span><br>
Hehehe, what's the Royal Navy's outpost like?<br>
<br>
"It's laid out pretty much the same as any other Azur Lane outpost, but I've been told the interior differs a lot... I've heard it's just as you'd expect from the Royal Navy."<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Long Island：</span><br>
I'd wager they decorated it to look like the boss room of a dungeon. A ghost like me would know~<br>
<br>
"I'll find out soon enough. More importantly, what about those orders you were talking about?"<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Long Island：</span><br>
Right, we're in the middle of an operation... I uh, totally forgot this channel was strictly for business...<br>
Anyway, I've got some pretty juicy news for you. Naval HQ took a good hard look at the report you sent, and has approved your plans for a general offensive!<br>
<br>
"Now we can finally make our move... Some juicy news indeed."<br>
"So, about our schedule for the offensive..."<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Long Island：</span><br>
Just as you were thinking, the Eagle Union is performing some more reconnaissance and will promptly be at action stations!<br>
Thanks to you already having scouted out their general strength, I was able to take a good look at the status of the Sirens' seas and found a better way to monitor them. You can leave things to me until the operation begins!<br>
Until then, you can just take it easy in the Royal Navy's outpost. Enjoy your time off until all hell breaks loose~<br>
<br>
Since we were able to determine that the Sirens' forces were stronger than we thought, it would be wise to secure more information via reconnaissance so we can make any changes we need to our plans.<br>
"By the way, if you're in charge of communications... does that mean there are other logistics-oriented girls stationed here too?"<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Long Island：</span><br>
Hehehe, bingo~ You'll be having a touching reunion with Helena and Memphis soon~!<br>
Signing off, Commander. Have a good one~<br>
Phew... That was nerve-wracking...! Oh crap, the comms are still on!<br>
<br>
That didn't quite make sense, but... Whatever, let's just get some rest while we can.<br>

<br>
*knock knock*<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Belfast：</span><br>
Please pardon my intrusion. It's good to see you again, Master.<br>
Her Majesty's tea party is fast approaching, so if you would please follow me.<br>
<br>
Oh right, Elizabeth invited me to a tea party earlier.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Belfast：</span><br>
We had hoped to invite you to our castle on the Royal Islands, but... as the situation stands, we had to make do the best we could.<br>
This outpost may be quite modest by comparison, but I assure you the experience will be as if the tea party were being held on the Royal Islands. Her Majesty is personally overlooking the preparations.<br>
<br>
"...That eye for details is certainly just like her."<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Belfast：</span><br>
Thank you for your understanding. Her Majesty has been looking forward to meeting with you, Master.<br>
<br>
Royal Navy Outpost - Banquet Hall<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Baltimore：</span><br>
So this is the... tea party. Feels more like a banquet, honestly.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Memphis：</span><br>
Not only are there high-quality teas and decadent pastries, but all of the furniture from the Royal Castle's banquet hall is here...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Saratoga：</span><br>
Elizabeth is abusing her position again! Look at all of the unnecessary stuff she had shipped over!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Queen Elizabeth：</span><br>
Baseless accusations! I did no such thing!<br>
I paid for all of these furnishings straight from my pocket—Ahem, the royal family's budget! And I must say, your evident jealousy has already made it quite worth it.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Saratoga：</span><br>
Hmph! You're taking advantage of the fact that I'm holding back!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Belfast：</span><br>
Miss Saratoga, please have some tea to help you relax. Everyone, please help yourselves to the refreshments.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Queen Elizabeth：</span><br>
Indeed. You are all free to savour all we can offer!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Saratoga：</span><br>
Well, whether it's a tea party or banquet, as long as it helps boost our morale~♪<br>
I really won't hold back, you know! ...Edinburgh! Get me one apricot cookie, one of each sandwich, and one black tea for the Commander!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Edinburgh：</span><br>
Oh, sure! Just one moment, please!<br>
<br>
It looks like Saratoga ordered a black tea for me... Well, I suppose why not.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Memphis：</span><br>
It's pretty good... Aren't you going to try anything, Enterprise? Come on, loosen up! The Royal Navy's snacks are delicious.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Belfast：</span><br>
Miss Enterprise, may I interest you in a fluffy cranberry scone?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Enterprise：</span><br>
Thank you. Let's see...<br>
<br>
The tea party surpassed everyone's expectations. Later, just as it was drawing to a close...<br>
"I've heard Memphis and Saratoga are here to support the operation. They'll be a great help."<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Saratoga：</span><br>
Some reinforcements arrived on our side, so we came here to help you guys out~♪<br>
<br>
"As we had planned, we'll be joining forces with the Royal Navy, and the offensive will start once reinforcements have arrived."<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Saratoga：</span><br>
Geez, Commander! You always go straight into work mode! I was planning on explaining everything to you after the tea party ended...<br>
Previously, you had sent someone proficient in communications to the Royal Outpost to ensure the plan would go smoothly, right?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Memphis：</span><br>
Naval HQ ended up sending more personnel and supplies than we expected, so we decided to spread our forces out to cover more ground.<br>
<br>
"Well, I had given some orders regarding that, but there was no way to know who would be coming over here..."<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Queen Elizabeth：</span><br>
Not a problem. We won't refuse any able-bodied additions to our ranks!<br>
That's not to imply the operation won't proceed flawlessly with me at the helm, but even one such as I may occasionally need to watch from the sideline.<br>
Sheffy told me everything. Thanks to your efforts, Naval HQ has finally gotten off of their arses.<br>
We must ensure that this offensive is a success. Do not let me down!<br>
<br>
"You deserve credit too, you know. Naval HQ definitely wouldn't have responded so quickly if it wasn't for you."<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Queen Elizabeth：</span><br>
Hoho! Continue to show your gratitude!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Saratoga：</span><br>
With that taken care of, we'll be leaving the rest in our capable Commander's hands. Please behave and go back to your castle, Miss Elizabeth~<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Queen Elizabeth：</span><br>
Hogwash! I'm already here, am I not? I shall accompany you to the heart of the NA Ocean.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Memphis：</span><br>
Huh? You're going to head into the center of the NA Ocean... personally?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Queen Elizabeth：</span><br>
That is the plan.<br>
That is the only way I can figure out what's happening. I-it's certainly not because I'm worried about my servant here!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Saratoga：</span><br>
Hm~ But Elizabeth, there's no need for you to fight on the front lines, is there...<br>
Just stay where it's safe, and leave the fighting to the Royal Maids. This mission is especially dangerous, and we don't wanna risk you or the Commander getting hurt.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Warspite：</span><br>
...We understand that, but...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Queen Elizabeth：</span><br>
It's fine, Warspite. I know how you feel, but we need not explain ourselves to this close-minded commoner.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Saratoga：</span><br>
And now you're pulling the queen card on me?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Queen Elizabeth：</span><br>
This is not up for debate! It would besmirch my reputation to send my servant into danger without incurring any risk myself!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Saratoga：</span><br>
What are you—! Gosh, I'm just trying to show some concern for you!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Queen Elizabeth：</span><br>
Save it for someone who needs it!<br>
<br>
Well... It seems Her Majesty will be coming along with us.<br>
After the tea party, I was heading for the break room when I ran into Sheffield.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Sheffield：</span><br>
Oh... What a pleasure it is to see you again, Master.<br>
<br>
"I couldn't find you at the tea party, but I guess you're here as well."<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Sheffield：</span><br>
It's the duty of the Maid Corps to keep this place clean and tidy.<br>
By the way, I have a message for you from Her Majesty.<br>
"You should think about what the existence of the Ashes means for us."<br>
<br>
...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Sheffield：</span><br>
I believe that Her Majesty may have wanted you to mull over this during your mission.<br>
Thank you for your time. Please enjoy your evening.<br>

<br>
NA Ocean - Core Sector<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Memphis：</span><br>
The fleet has finished assembling at the designated area. Mission will start in about 10 minutes.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Enterprise：</span><br>
Finally we're moving out again.<br>
Our reconnaissance has confirmed the presence of a tremendous Siren force and a massive stronghold in the center of the NA Ocean.<br>
This operation is massive in scope. Unlike usual, we won't be taking quick skirmishes to knock out their command network. Instead, we'll be pushing our entire forces through for a direct confrontation.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Memphis：</span><br>
Yep. Considering the size of our respective forces, Naval HQ decided the best strategy was an all-out attack from all directions.<br>
It's very straightforward. All you have to do is steadily clear all the obstacles in your path and eliminate every last Siren you see.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Baltimore：</span><br>
We'll have every fleet from every outpost in the area, all fighting with the same goal in mind. Simple and straightforward, just the kind of strategy I can get behind.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Memphis：</span><br>
It's not so simple for the girl who has to coordinate the efforts of so many people at once. Anyway...<br>
Our fleet is the biggest one sortieing today, and we'll have the Commander at the helm. I suppose that makes it something of a superfleet.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Saratoga：</span><br>
Especially with Queen Elizabeth herself joining us too~<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Memphis：</span><br>
But, even with the huge fleet we've assembled, we'll still have to break through one defensive barrier at a time to reach the center of the NA Ocean.<br>
Though we have a rough idea of what we're up against, the fact remains that our intel on the whole is limited.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Saratoga：</span><br>
Yup! To summarize, it's not a race, it's a multi-lane Siren-busting marathon to the center!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Communicator：</span><br>
Bzzzzt––––––––<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Hood：</span><br>
This is battlecruiser Hood of the Royal Navy fleet. I've been asked to deliver a speech on behalf of the Commander.<br>
Long ago, the Sirens appeared and ushered in an age of terror. Humanity could do nothing but watch as they seized our seas with ruthless aggression.<br>
They were unrelenting and merciless, but despite their best efforts, we refused to yield. Even when we lost battle after battle, we never lost hope of winning the war.<br>
When they would push us to the brink, we would muster all our strength and courage to push them right back. Our resolve was tested, but it never once faltered.<br>
We, as proud members of the Azur Lane, have fought tirelessly to reclaim the seas – to reclaim our freedom and peace. Our battle is far from over yet, but luck is on our side today.<br>
The Sirens in the NA Ocean are in disarray. They are concentrated at the ocean's centre, where a great storm defends what remains of their fleet.<br>
To them, this is their last stand. To us, this is a decisive victory just within reach.<br>
They shall find no stay of execution from us this day. We are the ones who shall turn the cogs of destiny!<br>
Shipgirls, once more, muster your strength and courage with me, and we shall defeat the Sirens!<br>
Let us take back what is rightfully ours, and seize true glory with our own hands!<br>
Commander, kindly give us the order to start!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">TB ：</span><br>
The operation is scheduled to begin now. All fleets are ready to sortie.<br>

"We have to destroy it before it destroys us. The question is how..."<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Queen Elizabeth：</span><br>
Simple – fight fire with fire. We need only blast it to bits with our own firepower!<br>
Ready, George?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">King George V：</span><br>
Yes, Your Highness. We are loaded and ready to fire.<br>

<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Le Téméraire：</span><br>

<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Hood：</span><br>
Commander, we have successfully eliminated all Sirens in the area.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Formidable：</span><br>
Their aircraft proved a tad troublesome to bring down, but they never stood a chance against our combined air force.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Eagle ：</span><br>
Mhm. Once you take out the carriers, their planes lose most of their bite.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Perseus ：</span><br>
Well, we're moving on to the next area then. Good luck over there, or whatever.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Saratoga：</span><br>
Wow! It's amazing what we can do when we really go all-out like this!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Memphis：</span><br>
It really is. They cleared the entire area, and our fleet didn't even have to fire a single shot.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Baltimore：</span><br>
Hell yeah. Feels like nothing can stop us now.<br>
<br>
"Was that Eagle and Perseus just now? I thought they were deployed in the north?"<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Queen Elizabeth：</span><br>
Surprised? Heheh! I made some arrangements to get them redeployed!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Warspite：</span><br>
Her Majesty managed to strike an agreement with the Northern Parliament and involve them in the operation as well.<br>
In essence, due to the critical nature of this operation, their participation will not impact the war situation in the north.<br>
When we said we'd send everyone we could, we meant it. Now let us advance and purge this ocean of its Siren blight!<br>

Hey, Commander... Don't these floating fortresses look familiar?<br>
<br>
"They remind me of the fortress the Iron Blood is working on..."<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Queen Elizabeth：</span><br>
Indeed they do. Might I say, researching even ordinary Siren technology is a tall order.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Saratoga：</span><br>
First Mirror Seas, and now floating fortresses...<br>
I can only hope they won't use the fruits of their research against us someday.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Baltimore：</span><br>
Yeah. I don't even wanna think about what would happen if they used Siren tech for evil.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Saratoga：</span><br>
If they decide to switch sides one terrible day... Bleh, it's too scary to imagine...<br>
<br>
...We'll have to keep a watchful eye on the Iron Blood. That's for sure.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">TB ：</span><br>
Warning: Multiple Siren signals have been detected ahead. Their source appears to be a cluster of Tester-types.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Saratoga：</span><br>
Testers, huh? Are they finally sending the real welcoming crew?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Memphis：</span><br>
They're Tester vessels more specifically, so not quite. Vessels aren't capable of verbal communication.<br>
I've heard reports about them from other fleets. They said the vessels are no pushovers by any means, but apparently they lack a central command unit.<br>
Basically, they're a cut above mass-produced units, though they don't quite rival the elites.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Baltimore：</span><br>
They always have some new surprise in store for us...<br>
Seeing as these are watered-down Testers, safe to say they're sending the toughest thing this defensive line has to offer.<br>
Heh, fine by me. I've been aching for something resembling a real fight!<br>

Scan complete. No Siren signals were detected in the area.<br>
Initiating combat data analysis.<br>
Analysis complete. This fleet and three others have broken through the Sirens' defenses. The first line of defense in the NA Ocean has been breached.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Enterprise：</span><br>
Nice, let's keep up the good work.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Queen Elizabeth：</span><br>
Very well. Up next should be the second line of defense. Bel, any news on reconnaissance?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Belfast：</span><br>
Yes, Your Majesty. The first round of reconnaissance has been completed. There are several stray Siren fleets, but there does not seem to be a sizable force holding the line.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Saratoga：</span><br>
Does that mean... they went all out on their first defense and didn't feel like they had to bother afterward?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Memphis：</span><br>
Maybe they sent all of their available units to defend the exterior...?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Queen Elizabeth：</span><br>
(There's no sound strategy behind this... If they have no Plan B, there are no escape routes or reinforcements. Once they're breached, they've lost.)<br>
(There's no way that we caught them completely unaware...)<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Enterprise：</span><br>
Even though each fleet has defeated a large number of Sirens, it's still not as many as we were anticipating.<br>
Moreover, our initial analysis suggested that we would encounter more of their forces the closer we got to the heart of the NA Ocean, not the opposite.<br>
The positioning of the Sirens is questionable for sure... Even assuming the Sirens are all at the heart of the NA Ocean, there's still a mismatch in the number of Sirens we scouted and the number of Sirens we've defeated.<br>
Not only that, if all of them are at the heart, they'd be so tightly clustered they'd only get in each other's way.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Memphis：</span><br>
Plus, there's no need for them to hide their strength after we've come this far... If they really wanted to halt our advance, they could just group up and try whatever they wanted.<br>
<br>
"Great points. We ought to keep our eyes peeled for any strange Siren deployments while continuing with our plan..."<br>

<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Memphis：</span><br>
A storm within a storm... That's some extreme weather.<br>

Both storms seem to be spinning at the same velocity, making it appear completely still from the inside... Enterprise, Commander, what do you think?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Enterprise：</span><br>
Yeah. There's no mistaking it. That storm is the same Singularity we saw in Bermuda.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Memphis：</span><br>
I mean, we've seen a lot of extreme weather before when dealing with Sirens. How can you tell it's a Singularity?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Enterprise：</span><br>
I want to point to its size, wind patterns, and our instrument readings... but honestly? It's just my intuition.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Memphis：</span><br>
I suppose you're right. A storm that completely blocks off the NA Ocean's center is too big to just be a Mirror Sea. It has to be a Singularity.<br>
Extreme weather that's larger in scope than a Mirror Sea... That makes me think...<br>
The shipgirls who created the Bermuda Singularity... The Ashes... Who created the Singularity over here...?<br>
Gosh, my head is a mess... Like, if the Ashes created this Singularity, why would the Sirens use it as their base...?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Baltimore：</span><br>
Beats me... Hey, are you all right, Memphis? You sound out of breath.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Memphis：</span><br>
Now that you mention it... are these... black crystals...?<br>
TB, can you analyze the structure of this stuff?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">TB ：</span><br>
Orders received. Beginning analysis.<br>
Analysis complete. This material shares similarities with the material used to analyze the Ashes' coordinates, though it is structurally slightly different.<br>
My conclusion is that the Ashes have battled here.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Queen Elizabeth：</span><br>
Well, then that makes sense. The Ashes and the Sirens must have fought around here.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Saratoga：</span><br>
Lemme guess... This is what you wanted to see for yourself?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Queen Elizabeth：</span><br>
That's correct. Everyone could already have guessed this was a Singularity, but I had to see firsthand what it has to do with the Ashes and the Sirens.<br>
Sometimes it's worth to see the frontlines with your own eyes. Take notes, Commander.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Saratoga：</span><br>
I'm pretty sure the Commander gets out more than you do, but hey...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Queen Elizabeth：</span><br>
Bel, go and collect a sample for me, and analyse it back home later.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Belfast：</span><br>
Certainly, Your Majesty.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">TB ：</span><br>
Warning: High energy readings have been detected at the eye of the storm. Evacuate immediately.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Queen Elizabeth：</span><br>
Hah?! Wh-what? The Singularity is growing all of a sudden...!<br>
Bel! Commander! Flee at once!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">TB ：</span><br>
The weather anomaly is expanding at a rate exceeding our speed. It is recommended to brace for impact.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Baltimore：</span><br>
Yeah, we can see that! Commander, get over here!<br>
<br>
"Wait... The storm isn't expanding into us, it's dragging us inside it!"<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Enterprise：</span><br>
There's no escaping its pull...! Hang on to whatever you can!<br>

<span style="color:#ff9900;">Enterprise META：</span><br>
Do you recognize me?<br>
<span style="color:#ff9900;">????：</span><br>
You're... Enterprise?! But that's impossible... Guh! I thought you already—<br>
<span style="color:#ff9900;">Enterprise META：</span><br>
Sounds like your cognitive bypass is fine. How'd the battle go? Tell me quick.<br>
<span style="color:#ff9900;">????：</span><br>
Gah... How do you think it went? It's dead quiet here after they... After they decimated us.<br>
<span style="color:#ff9900;">Enterprise META：</span><br>
The Sirens are pruning the branches, huh.<br>
...Do you want revenge?<br>
<span style="color:#ff9900;">????：</span><br>
Of course I do... They broke me into a thousand pieces...<br>
But... there's no hope left...<br>
Even if I had the power to take down as many as I could... what good would it do...<br>
Those bastards just keep coming... they've wiped out every last one of us, save for me...<br>
<span style="color:#ff9900;">Enterprise META：</span><br>
You still don't understand your true power, do you?<br>
Even if a flame is extinguished, its Ashes yet remain.<br>
I am Enterprise, but not the Enterprise you know... Ark Royal, will you join us?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Belfast：</span><br>
Master, are you awake? How are you feeling?<br>
<br>
My head is spinning, but I'm able to rise to my feet.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Belfast：</span><br>
By the looks of it, it seems that the rest of the fleet was drawn into the Singularity along with us.<br>
<br>
"So this is what's inside the Singularity... It looks almost like a battle unfolded here."<br>
<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项1："Why are you here, Belfast?"</span>'''''<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项2："These wrecks... They can't be..."</span>'''''<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Belfast：</span><br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项1）</span>'''''Miss Baltimore, Miss Enterprise, and Her Highness told me that in case of an emergency, I should look after you.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Belfast：</span><br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项2）</span>'''''No need to worry, those are not the remains of our allies.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Belfast：</span><br>
We are currently searching for our allies through this wasteland. Please rest for the time being, Master.<br>
<br>
"What happened to TB?"<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Belfast：</span><br>
TB... hasn't been responding since we were drawn into the Singularity.<br>
The Sirens may be jamming our signals, but since our electronics are also malfunctioning, we can't be certain that's the case.<br>
<br>
"Singularities are always more of a pain to deal with than Mirror Seas..."<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Belfast：</span><br>
Fortunately for us, our close-range communications are still working, so we should still be able to regroup with the rest of our fleet.<br>
I'm currently trying to contact them. I will report back to you when I am able to reach them.<br>
<br>
Heeding Belfast's suggestion, I closed my eyes and rested for a bit.<br>

<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Essex：</span><br>
Commander... and Enterprise!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Enterprise：</span><br>
Essex! Was the aerial support fleet swept up by the Singularity too?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Essex：</span><br>
Yes, so it seems. The storm drew us inside, and the next thing we knew, we were in this place...<br>
Of course, we came looking for you and the Commander as soon as we were able to!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Enterprise：</span><br>
Thank you. It's a huge weight off our shoulders now that you're here. Since we don't have any information about the inside of the Singularity, we can use all the help we can get.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Vestal：</span><br>
Commander, you don't look so good... Is it due to the trauma you experienced from the storm?<br>
Hold on for a moment, let me examine you...<br>
<br>
"So the Singularity sucked in not just our carriers, but our repair ships and rear support too?"<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Vestal：</span><br>
Well, normally, us support vessels shouldn't be on the front lines, but...<br>
I wanted to move the temporary base forward as a contingency in case of unplanned emergencies, and I wanted to make sure that Enterprise and the others were able to get repairs if they needed them. Hehe.<br>
Oh, by the way, since I was around the carriers, I didn't need to worry about combat at all.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Enterprise：</span><br>
Don't overwork yourself, Vestal.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Vestal：</span><br>
You're one to talk~<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Enterprise：</span><br>
...*sigh*...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Vestal：</span><br>
You know as well as I do that I'm not pushing myself as hard as you are~♪<br>
Anyway, Commander. I looked over everyone else earlier and nobody's taken any serious damage. They're all doing just fine~<br>
Especially Enterprise over here. She's in perfect condition for this operation.<br>
And there's no way she'll overdo it when she's by your side~ Which is always a good thing.<br>
The goal is just up ahead. There's no point in retiring from the operation this late into it.<br>
While I may not be very useful in a battle, you can always trust me to repair and resupply our fleet!<br>
<br>
"Thank you. Emergency repairs are a lifesaver in this situation."<br>
This place may be where the Sirens' fleet has been all along... We need to proceed with caution from here on out.<br>

<span style="color:#ff9900;">Enterprise META：</span><br>
How are you feeling?<br>
<span style="color:#ff9900;">Ark Royal META：</span><br>
Disgusted, in a familiar way...<br>
<span style="color:#ff9900;">Hiryuu META：</span><br>
Ah, right. You've never been to a test site that's progressed to this stage before.<br>
<span style="color:#ff9900;">Ark Royal META：</span><br>
You mean to say you're used to this?<br>
<span style="color:#ff9900;">Hiryuu META：</span><br>
We agreed not to ask questions about each other's pasts. Don't forget that.<br>
<span style="color:#ff9900;">Ark Royal META：</span><br>
Sorry. It won't happen again.<br>
<span style="color:#ff9900;">Enterprise META：</span><br>
Save the chitchat for later. The enemy's coming.<br>
<span style="color:#ff9900;">Hiryuu META：</span><br>
Hate to be blunt, but we stick out like a sore thumb here. It's only a matter of time before the Arbiters come for us.<br>
<span style="color:#ff9900;">Enterprise META：</span><br>
It doesn't matter. They'll pursue us no matter what branch we escape to.<br>
Remember, our mission is to stall them by any means necessary until the Singularity stabilizes. That is all.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Belfast：</span><br>
How are you feeling, Master?<br>
<br>
Belfast and Vestal gave me first aid. I'm feeling much better now.<br>
<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项1："A lot better, thanks to you."</span>'''''<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项2："Almost like new, thanks to Vestal."</span>'''''<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Belfast：</span><br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项1）</span>'''''Think nothing of it, Master. I simply did what is expected of a maid.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Belfast：</span><br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项2）</span>'''''That is wonderful to hear. Miss Vestal truly outdid herself.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Queen Elizabeth：</span><br>
Comma– Ahem! Servant! Are you all right? No lingering pain, I presume?<br>
Phew... You've recovered splendidly! Quickly now, see what's happening outside!<br>
<br>
I got up on the deck of the mass-produced battleship and looked around. What I saw left my jaw agape in shock.<br>
Wrecks. Countless wrecks, littering the sea's surface all the way into the horizon.<br>
So dense that our fleet has to use the bow of a ship to plow a way forward through the wreckage.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Memphis：</span><br>
This started around half an hour ago...<br>
It began with just a few broken-off fragments floating in with the waves. Then more appeared, and then even more...<br>
Until eventually it got to the point where we are now, struggling to even move forward because of all the debris.<br>
And to think they're all Siren wrecks... I suppose this explains where they all went.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Enterprise：</span><br>
I've never seen such a gruesome sight before. Calling this the site of a battle doesn't do it justice...<br>
It's more like the site of a one-sided slaughter. No... a dumping ground for their broken husks...<br>
<br>
There was no hostility in Enterprise's or Memphis's voices. Everyone was simply in shock at what they were seeing.<br>
Layers upon layers of broken metal piled atop each other. No gunfire, no explosion, no screams. Only destruction.<br>
Metal screeches against metal as our ships slowly push past, like the groaning of a demon in the thralls of its final death. But before long, silence had returned.<br>
If I had to describe this scene with just one word... it would be "graveyard."<br>
...<br>
I solemnly ordered the fleet to keep advancing in formation, launch additional recon planes, and gather intel on the sector as quickly as possible.<br>

<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Essex：</span><br>
It's all so strange. The wrecks seem to have been floating around for wildly differing times, and there's no apparent explanation for where they came from...<br>
I'm willing to believe they're all from Sirens in the NA Ocean, but that they had THIS many here? That just seems impossible.<br>
Unless... Unless there were far more Sirens concentrated here than we observed...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Enterprise：</span><br>
What's your theory? That the bulk of the Sirens' forces was eliminated inside the Singularity?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Essex：</span><br>
Yes, it seems the most plausible to me.<br>
It would explain why their defense was so incompetent – they'd already suffered massive casualties before our all-out offensive even began.<br>
If we suppose that's true, then everything adds up. As for who eliminated them, I would speculate it was the Ashes. Though it could've been someone else.<br>
At any rate, this is where the "real" battle took place – where the Sirens made their last stand.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Enterprise：</span><br>
Looking back at it now, the storm and the lack of a strong Siren presence in the area is essentially what put our all-out offensive into motion.<br>
If what we saw earlier was their last-ditch effort to defend their territory... that means that, by pure luck, we struck while they were at their weakest.<br>
However, there's a hole in your theory. If the Ashes are responsible for the fresh wrecks, then who the hell is responsible for those older ones?<br>
Then there's those wrecks of mass-produced ships which are unmistakably man-made. We may have only found a handful, but that handful is still a large percentage of all the ships we have in the area.<br>
If we'd lost that many ships at some point, we would've known about it by now.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Essex：</span><br>
Maybe... The old wrecks are from a battle we fought long ago, and they somehow resurfaced much later...?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Enterprise：</span><br>
Still no. There are more here than have sunk in any battle in the NA Ocean at any point in time.<br>
Just look around you. You can send recon planes in any direction and find no end in sight to all these wrecks...<br>
Even seeing it with your own eyes, it's almost impossible to believe there could be so many sunk ships in one place.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Saratoga：</span><br>
Hehe~ As it so happens, I might know an explanation for that!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Enterprise：</span><br>
Really? Do tell.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Saratoga：</span><br>
The common theory goes that Singularities are dimensionally divergent!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Enterprise：</span><br>
What does "dimensionally divergent" mean, exactly?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Saratoga：</span><br>
If I remember right, it's something like... Singularities don't have fixed space in three dimensions. Rather, they exhibit more complex properties.<br>
Ever heard of the observer effect? It's likely the inside of a Singularity is strongly influenced by what its observers see.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Queen Elizabeth：</span><br>
Ah yes, that! I've read about this before.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Saratoga：</span><br>
Hey! At least let me finish explaining before you try to steal my thunder!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Queen Elizabeth：</span><br>
Well, now is a good time to mention it was OUR Royal scientists who first proposed that theory.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Saratoga：</span><br>
Oh really? What sets their theory apart from the Eagle Union's version of it?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Queen Elizabeth：</span><br>
...Bel, look into this matter for me later.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Saratoga：</span><br>
Pfft...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Queen Elizabeth：</span><br>
Hey! Don't scoff at royalty! Go on then, continue with your explanation if you're so eager to share it.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Saratoga：</span><br>
All righty then. When the inside of the Singularity is directly observed, it will continue to expand. That's why it seems like there's no end to it.<br>
So the more we explore, the bigger it grows, and the more mass accumulates inside it. And if it grows too big, it could lead to something disastrous!<br>
The good news is, the Ashes and Sirens seem to be able to come and go as they please! Which means there has to be a way out of the Singularity.<br>
But to find it, we'll need to stop observing so much. As counterintuitive as it sounds, we should probably put away our planes and radars and rely only on line of sight!<br>
<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项1："Makes perfect sense!"</span>'''''<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项2："I don't think I caught all that..."</span>'''''<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Saratoga：</span><br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项1）</span>'''''I knew you'd agree, Commander! Then let's get searching!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Saratoga：</span><br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项2）</span>'''''That's fair. It's pretty complicated stuff. But don't worry, I'll get us out of here in no time!<br>

<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Memphis：</span><br>
Stop for a sec! I see people on the horizon!<br>
Some of them definitely look like Sirens. The rest, though... I think they're Ashes.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Queen Elizabeth：</span><br>
We can't use TB's scans to identify them since it would mean observing a greater area, yes?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Memphis：</span><br>
Unfortunately, yeah. Does anyone here have good long-distance eyesight?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Queen Elizabeth：</span><br>
Bel, you're up.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Belfast：</span><br>
Certainly, Your Highness. Let's see... As far as I am able to tell, there appears to be five silhouettes in the distance.<br>
Three of them match the descriptions of documented elite Sirens. As for the remaining two, I concur with Miss Memphis and conclude that they are Ashes.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Baltimore：</span><br>
Two Ashes members in one place? That's gotta be a first.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Essex：</span><br>
They seem to be holding their own against the Sirens, too. It's no wonder, given how frighteningly strong they are.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Belfast：</span><br>
I believe we have encountered these Sirens before. They are Temperance, Strength, and The Hermit. One of the Ashes is Hiryuu, and the other...<br>
...There's no mistaking it. That must be Ark Royal.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Queen Elizabeth：</span><br>
The Ark Royal that approached the Eagle Union fleet, hm?<br>
At last we meet, Ashes...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Essex：</span><br>
Oh dear, it's her... Now I remember what a nightmare it was to capture her.<br>
Not to mention we didn't have a coordinate tracker back then. Locating her was like trying to find a needle in a haystack...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Memphis：</span><br>
Fighting them in a sea of shipwrecks sounds like a bad idea. Commander, I think we should keep a low profile and leave them be.<br>
They don't know we're here yet, so now's a good time to–<br>
<span style="color:#ff9900;">Hiryuu META：</span><br>
Pass by unnoticed? Sorry, but it's too late for that.<br>
You came at just the right time. I knew I could count on you to show up when I needed it.<br>
<span style="color:#ff9900;">Ark Royal META：</span><br>
What's the meaning of this, Hiryuu? I know you've been sneaking off on your own for a while now. Suppose you've made some new friends, huh?<br>
<span style="color:#ff9900;">Hiryuu META：</span><br>
Our hit-and-run tactics work fine for dispatching detached Sirens. When invading a stronghold, however, we could certainly use the backing of a big fleet.<br>
And let's not forget we're up against Arbiters here. I'm not afraid to pull a few strings to gain an advantage over them.<br>
<span style="color:#ff9900;">Ark Royal META：</span><br>
I'm aware, but remember what Takao said about minimising contact with outsiders?<br>
<span style="color:#ff9900;">Hiryuu META：</span><br>
It's a little late for that now. They found me before I found them.<br>
Look, the Commander is our golden ticket out of here. I guarantee you the Arbiters won't be coming after us.<br>
<span style="color:#ff9900;">Ark Royal META：</span><br>
Hmph... Whatever you bloody well say.<br>
<br>
A small argument broke out between the Ashes members just as we got here.<br>
Ark Royal conceded the argument with a sigh, then directed her gaze at me.<br>
<span style="color:#ff9900;">Ark Royal META：</span><br>
...So you're the one. The Commander she – "Code G" – is so fond of.<br>
<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项1：Say nothing</span>'''''<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项2：Respond</span>'''''<br>
<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项1）</span>'''''......<br>
<span style="color:#ff9900;">Ark Royal META：</span><br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项1）</span>'''''Not in the mood for a conversation, eh.<br>
<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项2）</span>'''''"And you're Ark Royal... Member of the Ashes."<br>
<span style="color:#ff9900;">Ark Royal META：</span><br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项2）</span>'''''The very same.<br>
<span style="color:#ff9900;">Ark Royal META：</span><br>
You're... an interesting one, Commander. I've heard the tales about you.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Queen Elizabeth：</span><br>
Are you... Are you really Ark Royal?<br>
<span style="color:#ff9900;">Ark Royal META：</span><br>
Your High––<br>
...Yes, I am. Mind you, I may not necessarily be the Ark Royal you know.<br>
...You don't need to know anything more than that.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Queen Elizabeth：</span><br>
...Very well.<br>
<span style="color:#ff9900;">Hiryuu META：</span><br>
Please don't take offense, she's always like this. Having said that, perhaps you should take a leaf out of her book.<br>
Getting back on topic... Based on all your actions up to this point, it's safe to say you in fact are not allied with Antiochus.<br>
That being the case, I'd like to propose a temporary truce between us. Together, we can get out of this sticky situation. What do you say?<br>
<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项1："Girls, what do you think?"</span>'''''<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Queen Elizabeth：</span><br>
What do I think? Thinking and making decisions is your job, you doltish servant!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Enterprise：</span><br>
It's your call, Commander. I'm behind you either way.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Essex：</span><br>
I can't say whether the Ashes are friends or foes, but if nothing else, they can be reasoned with. Sirens, meanwhile, are the antithesis of everything we stand for.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Saratoga：</span><br>
Things probably aren't quite that clear-cut. Just saying...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Memphis：</span><br>
If nothing else, this is a good opportunity to gather intel on the Ashes. That's worth something.<br>
<span style="color:#ff9900;">Hiryuu META：</span><br>
We won't stop you from taking notes. After all, we're the ones asking for help here.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Memphis：</span><br>
You sound sure we won't learn anything useful. We never wanted to fight you, you know. We just wanted to understand you. That's what the Commander wanted all along.<br>
<span style="color:#ff9900;">Hiryuu META：</span><br>
I see... Be that as it may, you aren't as trustworthy as you'd like to think you are. That's all I'll say on the matter.<br>
At any rate, I'm certainly not opposed to occasionally teaming up to defeat a common enemy. Like now.<br>
<span style="color:#ec5d53;">Arbiter: Temperance XIV：</span><br>
...An unexpected development has occurred. Should we abort the mission?<br>
<span style="color:#ec5d53;">Arbiter: The Hermit IX：</span><br>
Yeah, no. The risk's still well within an acceptable range. Continue as planned.<br>
<span style="color:#ec5d53;">Arbiter: Strength VIII：</span><br>
Agreed. Stick to the mission. Eliminate the invaders so we can reinstate normal test site conditions.<br>
<span style="color:#ec5d53;">Arbiter: The Hermit IX：</span><br>
I'll have faith in your assessments, then. Proceed as proposed.<br>
<br>
Doesn't look like we have much choice here but to join forces with the Ashes...<br>
"All ships! Target the Arbiters! Open fire!"<br>
<br>
<br>
"How's Vestal and the escort fleet looking?"<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Memphis：</span><br>
Thanks to the immediate reaction from the Ashes, they seem to have barely scraped by.<br>
The rest of us are in trouble, though... The Ashes can't attack while resupplying, so all the attacks they were drawing get redirected to us instead!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Saratoga：</span><br>
They've got insane defense, insane offense, and even gravity wells... Even with the Ashes' help, if this draws out, we're toast!<br>
<br>
"We need to find a way to break through, and fast..."<br>
<span style="color:#ffd000;">???：</span><br>
I'll strike them from underneath. Their attacks don't work on submarines.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Saratoga：</span><br>
Huh? An Iron Blood submarine?<br>
<span style="color:#ffd000;">U-47：</span><br>
Mhm. VIIB-class submarine, U-47, at your service.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Saratoga：</span><br>
How did you get in here?<br>
<span style="color:#ffd000;">U-47：</span><br>
Same as you. I and my team got sucked into the Singularity while scouting ahead for Iron Blood's side of the all-out offensive.<br>
And so I'm joining forces, at the Commander's request.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Memphis：</span><br>
So the Crimson Axis... were fighting Sirens with us all along!<br>
All right, Commander! Let's try striking at them with the help of our Iron Blood friends here!<br>
<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项1："Let's do it."</span>'''''<br>
<br>
Whether one sides with the Azur Lane or the Crimson Axis is unimportant to this operation. This isn't about us versus them, it's about humanity versus the Sirens.<br>
<span style="color:#ffd000;">U-47：</span><br>
All right, I'm heading off then.<br>
Ready to fire full torpedo load. Say goodnight, Arbiters...<br>
<br>
<span style="color:#ec5d53;">Arbiter: The Hermit IX：</span><br>
For some reason, weapons output 7.3% less damage than expected. A curious phenomenon.<br>
<span style="color:#ff9900;">Ark Royal META：</span><br>
They're bloody jamming my weapons systems, Hiryuu! You'll have to take over for me for a while!<br>
<span style="color:#ff9900;">Hiryuu META：</span><br>
Son of a... Always coming up with dirty new tricks to use on us...<br>
<br>
The Arbiters are focusing their jamming on the Ashes. They're open to attacks from us.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Warspite：</span><br>
The battleship fleet is locked and loaded!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Saratoga：</span><br>
Our plane squadrons are ready for takeoff too! We'll hit 'em right where it hurts!<br>
<span style="color:#ff9900;">Hiryuu META：</span><br>
(Ah, it's been ages since I was part of a large joint operation... I'm ablaze with motivation!)<br>
<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Essex：</span><br>
The Ashes are something else! Just one of them is enough to match the firepower of several of us...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Memphis：</span><br>
I'm just glad we were somehow able to make up for the reduction of Ark Royal's power.<br>
(Actually, I feel like we did more than just make up for it. I've heard the Ashes differ in how strong they each are, but I guess the gap between them and us isn't as big as we thought.)<br>
(This is crucial information for us. I'll have to add it in my report to the Commander later.)<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Essex：</span><br>
It's pretty troubling that we don't have a grasp on the true strength of the Arbiters. Stay focused.<br>
One thing's for sure though – they're strong enough to keep the Ashes on the back foot. The moment we underestimate them may be our undoing!<br>
<span style="color:#ec5d53;">Arbiter: The Hermit IX：</span><br>
Look at that, the test subject fleet possesses firepower exceeding our estimates. This is some interesting data.<br>
<span style="color:#ec5d53;">Arbiter: Strength VIII：</span><br>
Did we not just calibrate the parameters of our test vessels?<br>
<span style="color:#ec5d53;">Arbiter: The Hermit IX：</span><br>
Seems there's a discrepancy between our simulated and actual performance. Saving the data log for later.<br>
Anyway... Strength, go ahead and crank up the gravity fluctuations.<br>
<span style="color:#ec5d53;">Arbiter: Strength VIII：</span><br>
On it.<br>
<span style="color:#ec5d53;">Arbiter: The Hermit IX：</span><br>
Executing IX-XIV Linked Jamming Protocol.<br>
<br>
<span style="color:#ff9900;">Ark Royal META：</span><br>
We're in trouble... If all three of the Arbiters team up, this situation is going to get exponentially harder to deal with!<br>
<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项1："Don't give up hope!"</span>'''''<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项2："Keep up the pressure!"</span>'''''<br>
<span style="color:#ff9900;">Hiryuu META：</span><br>
You've got some determination, Commander.<br>
<br>
"I've been through my fair share of battles. The more precarious the situation, the more essential maintaining your composure is. Only by staying calm can you even begin to hope for victory."<br>
"Go and take the injured to the rear, and have our repair ships look after them! Press on!"<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Vestal：</span><br>
Leave the injured to me~ No need to worry, we're here to back you up!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Queen Elizabeth：</span><br>
The Royal Navy refuses to fall. We will persevere!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Belfast：</span><br>
Exactly as you say. Please find a safe place at the back of our ranks, Your Majesty.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Essex：</span><br>
Enterprise, your flight deck! Go get some emergency treatment, and leave this to us!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Enterprise：</span><br>
All right, will do. Hang in there!<br>
<span style="color:#ff9900;">Ark Royal META：</span><br>
...<br>
<br>
"Ashes, you've taken serious damage. Our repair ships could fix–"<br>
<span style="color:#ff9900;">Ark Royal META：</span><br>
Thanks, but we'll have to pass. You haven't even seen our true power yet.<br>
In case you weren't aware, the Arbiters will annihilate you lot the moment we relax our assault.<br>
<span style="color:#ff9900;">Hiryuu META：</span><br>
She's right. Worry about yourselves before you even begin to think about us.<br>
Having said that, it might be a good idea to take you up on that offer. Let's step back for just for a while to resupply.<br>
<span style="color:#ff9900;">Ark Royal META：</span><br>
{namecode:94}……？<br>
<span style="color:#ff9900;">Hiryuu META：</span><br>
No need to get worked up. Have you fought alone for so long that you've forgotten the other tactics available to you as an entire fleet?<br>
<br>
"Precisely. Work together with us as allies, or none of us are leaving this place...!"<br>
<br>
<span style="color:#ec5d53;">Arbiter: The Hermit IX：</span><br>
Temperance, put some pressure on their rear units. Strength, swap over to linked mode, now. We can't let the Ashes recover.<br>
<span style="color:#ec5d53;">Arbiter: Strength VIII：</span><br>
Got it. Switching Linked Jamming Protocol code from IX-VIII to VIII-IX, prioritizing mobility.<br>
<span style="color:#ec5d53;">Arbiter: Temperance XIV：</span><br>
Initiating VIII-XIV Linked Jamming Protocol. Let's see their rear guard try to heal off the damage now.<br>
<br>
<span style="color:#ff9900;">Hiryuu META：</span><br>
Do NOT let them get in formation! Keep taking them out until the Enforcers go into hiding!<br>
<span style="color:#ff9900;">Ark Royal META：</span><br>
Got it! Leave the small buggers to me!<br>
<br>
<span style="color:#ec5d53;">Arbiter: Temperance XIV：</span><br>
Not bad, but it ends here. My web was already spun before you launched your first attack. Execute combat link protocol.<br>
<span style="color:#ec5d53;">Arbiter: The Hermit IX：</span><br>
On it! Executing IX-XIV Linked Jamming Protocol!<br>
<br>
<span style="color:#ec5d53;">Arbiter: Strength VIII：</span><br>
A formidable blow, but ultimately futile. Initiating automatic repair functions.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Essex：</span><br>
She's rapidly repairing all the damage the submarines inflicted to her!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Shangri-La：</span><br>
And it's not just Strength... The other Arbiters are also repairing themselves!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Essex：</span><br>
Does that mean... all Arbiters come equipped with self-regenerating systems?<br>
<span style="color:#ec5d53;">Arbiter: Strength VIII：</span><br>
This vessel's self-repair mechanisms seem to be deficient.<br>
...But no matter. We continue the attack.<br>
<br>
"We're only going to be whittled down if this goes on, just as Saratoga said."<br>
"If only there was a way to retreat..."<br>
<span style="color:#ff9900;">Hiryuu META：</span><br>
If you want to retreat, then go right ahead. But we have no intention of running with our tails between our legs.<br>
Our goals are twofold. To defend the Singularity that our allies opened, to the bitter end; and to destroy all of our enemies in one fell swoop. Retreat isn't an option.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Memphis：</span><br>
So it really was you that created the Singularity all along.<br>
<span style="color:#ff9900;">Hiryuu META：</span><br>
You only figured it out just now?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Memphis：</span><br>
We can speculate all we want, but we couldn't know for sure until we heard it straight from your mouth.<br>
(So the things that happened to the NA Ocean aren't their fault... And if anything, it was this Singularity that allowed us to finally make a decisive move against the Sirens.)<br>
What's the purpose of you doing all this?<br>
<span style="color:#ff9900;">Hiryuu META：</span><br>
It doesn't concern you... or so I'd like to say.<br>
But that wouldn't be entirely accurate.<br>
<span style="color:#ff9900;">Ark Royal META：</span><br>
{namecode:94}！<br>
<span style="color:#ff9900;">Hiryuu META：</span><br>
Yes, I know. I have no intention of saying any more than that.<br>
Let's get down to the nitty-gritty, Commander.<br>
The Arbiters are only after us. There's no reason for you to risk your lives defending this Singularity either.<br>
If you want to retreat like you wanted to earlier, we won't stop you. I'll even tell you the way out.<br>
I swear on the 2nd CarDiv's honor that we won't turn on you. Now tell me, honestly, would you rather stay and fight, or retreat to safety?<br>
<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项1："Retreating might be our only choice..."</span>'''''<br>
<span style="color:#ff9900;">Hiryuu META：</span><br>
I see. The well-being of your allies is paramount, so the choice is obvious.<br>
Well, then this is farewell. I'll be hoping for your safe escape.<br>
<span style="color:#ff9900;">Ark Royal META：</span><br>
...<br>
<br>
"As soon as I get in touch with Naval HQ, I'll ask for some reinforcements."<br>
<span style="color:#ff9900;">Hiryuu META：</span><br>
While I don't doubt that you would do that for us, don't bother.<br>
It'll just end up being a hindrance to us. Now go, get out of here, quick.<br>
<br>
"All ships! Disengage from the Arbiters, retreat, and change course for the Singularity's exit!"<br>
<span style="color:#ff9900;">Hiryuu META：</span><br>
I wish you the best, Commander.<br>
And that takes care of that. Are you starting to understand how Takao felt, Ark Royal?<br>
<span style="color:#ff9900;">Ark Royal META：</span><br>
...<br>
<span style="color:#ff9900;">Hiryuu META：</span><br>
The Commander truly is a unique person. A person who's caring and considerate to allies, yet ruthless to enemies. A person who can win anyone over...<br>
A person who accurately reads the flow of battle and is quick to make judgments, and depending on the situation, prioritizes the best interests of the fleet...<br>
Knowing all that, I understand why the Commander made that choice.<br>
Look at it from the Commander's perspective. We're neither friends, nor foes... Just strangers to steer clear of, lest we turn on you.<br>
If I were in the Commander's shoes, I would've likely made the same decision.<br>
<span style="color:#ff9900;">Ark Royal META：</span><br>
Admittedly, as would I, and without hesitation either.<br>
Hiryuu... Thank you for letting me be part of a brief, but blissful dream.<br>
<span style="color:#ff9900;">Hiryuu META：</span><br>
You're welcome. Though I have to admit, I was only half-committed to making all this happen.<br>
<span style="color:#ff9900;">Ark Royal META：</span><br>
No, you absolutely went through a lot of trouble to lead the Commander to us. It was very roundabout, and not something I'd expect from you.<br>
<span style="color:#ff9900;">Hiryuu META：</span><br>
Hahaha, you're not wrong... My sister isn't here, so I guess I ended up doing something that's not in my nature.<br>
<span style="color:#ff9900;">Ark Royal META：</span><br>
Do you think... after the brief time we spent with the Commander, the long-extinguished flames in our heart can be lit once more?<br>
<span style="color:#ff9900;">Hiryuu META：</span><br>
Perhaps... but that no longer has anything to do with us.<br>
<span style="color:#ff9900;">Ark Royal META：</span><br>
...<br>
<span style="color:#ff9900;">Hiryuu META：</span><br>
Ark Royal, get ready to push yourself beyond the limit. We need to hold out until Enterprise comes back.<br>
<span style="color:#ff9900;">Ark Royal META：</span><br>
...Yeah. I'm aware.<br>
Antiochus... I've long waited for this opportunity... The opportunity to finally have my revenge!<br>
Whatever your goals once were, and whatever you strive to achieve in the end, it's all meaningless to me!<br>
All that matters is that you took away everything I held dear! You destroyed all hope I had!<br>
Humanity has an age-old adage... An eye for an eye, and a tooth for a tooth...<br>
TAKE THIS! ALL OF MY RAGE, FOCUSED IN ONE HIT!<br>
<br>
My eyes were stabbed by the blinding light of an explosion. The shockwave tore at my skin, and the blast sent great ripples across the sea.<br>
After the smoke cloud dissipated and the dust settled, there was only deathly silence.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Memphis：</span><br>
*cough cough*... Commander... you alright?<br>
<br>
"I think I'm fine. I'm more worried about everyone else..."<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Memphis：</span><br>
That blast definitely did us no favors. It was like salt in our still open wounds...<br>
Thankfully, the damage to our repair ships and rear fleets was minimal. Our wounded received emergency repairs, so at least there were no casualties.<br>
Plus, the explosion helped destroy a lot of the obstacles that were in the way earlier, so it should make getting out that much easier.<br>
<br>
"An explosion of that magnitude... There's no way even the Ashes could have made it out unscathed..."<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Memphis：</span><br>
I understand how you feel, but we're in no position to go back for them.<br>
There's nothing to suggest the Arbiters are chasing us, but we're not out of the woods yet.<br>
<br>
"We can't waste the chance the Ashes graciously created for us..."<br>
"We need to escape the Singularity and meet up with our allies on the outside."<br>
"After that, we'll regroup, return to the Singularity, and hopefully return the NA Ocean to the way it was before... A clear, blue sea."<br>
"Until then, just try to hang in there, everyone!"<br>
...<br>

<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Memphis：</span><br>
Stop for a sec! I see people on the horizon!<br>
Some of them definitely look like Sirens. The rest, though... I think they're Ashes.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Queen Elizabeth：</span><br>
We can't use TB's scans to identify them since it would mean observing a greater area, yes?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Memphis：</span><br>
Unfortunately, yeah. Does anyone here have good long-distance eyesight?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Queen Elizabeth：</span><br>
Bel, you're up.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Belfast：</span><br>
Certainly, Your Highness. Let's see... As far as I am able to tell, there appears to be five silhouettes in the distance.<br>
Three of them match the descriptions of documented elite Sirens. As for the remaining two, I concur with Miss Memphis and conclude that they are Ashes.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Baltimore：</span><br>
Two Ashes members in one place? That's gotta be a first.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Essex：</span><br>
They seem to be holding their own against the Sirens, too. It's no wonder, given how frighteningly strong they are.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Belfast：</span><br>
I believe we have encountered these Sirens before. They are Temperance, Strength, and The Hermit. One of the Ashes is Hiryuu, and the other...<br>
...There's no mistaking it. That must be Ark Royal.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Queen Elizabeth：</span><br>
The Ark Royal that approached the Eagle Union fleet, hm?<br>
At last we meet, Ashes...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Essex：</span><br>
Oh dear, it's her... Now I remember what a nightmare it was to capture her.<br>
Not to mention we didn't have a coordinate tracker back then. Locating her was like trying to find a needle in a haystack...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Memphis：</span><br>
Fighting them in a sea of shipwrecks sounds like a bad idea. Commander, I think we should keep a low profile and leave them be.<br>
They don't know we're here yet, so now's a good time to–<br>
<span style="color:#ff9900;">Hiryuu META：</span><br>
Pass by unnoticed? Sorry, but it's too late for that.<br>
You came at just the right time. I knew I could count on you to show up when I needed it.<br>
<span style="color:#ff9900;">Ark Royal META：</span><br>
What's the meaning of this, Hiryuu? I know you've been sneaking off on your own for a while now. Suppose you've made some new friends, huh?<br>
<span style="color:#ff9900;">Hiryuu META：</span><br>
Our hit-and-run tactics work fine for dispatching detached Sirens. When invading a stronghold, however, we could certainly use the backing of a big fleet.<br>
And let's not forget we're up against Arbiters here. I'm not afraid to pull a few strings to gain an advantage over them.<br>
<span style="color:#ff9900;">Ark Royal META：</span><br>
I'm aware, but remember what Takao said about minimising contact with outsiders?<br>
<span style="color:#ff9900;">Hiryuu META：</span><br>
It's a little late for that now. They found me before I found them.<br>
Look, the Commander is our golden ticket out of here. I guarantee you the Arbiters won't be coming after us.<br>
<span style="color:#ff9900;">Ark Royal META：</span><br>
Hmph... Whatever you bloody well say.<br>
<br>
A small argument broke out between the Ashes members just as we got here.<br>
Ark Royal conceded the argument with a sigh, then directed her gaze at me.<br>
<span style="color:#ff9900;">Ark Royal META：</span><br>
...So you're the one. The Commander she – "Code G" – is so fond of.<br>
<br>

<span style="color:#ff9900;">Ark Royal META：</span><br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项2）</span>'''''The very same.<br>
<span style="color:#ff9900;">Ark Royal META：</span><br>
You're... an interesting one, Commander. I've heard the tales about you.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Queen Elizabeth：</span><br>
Are you... Are you really Ark Royal?<br>
<span style="color:#ff9900;">Ark Royal META：</span><br>
Your High––<br>
...Yes, I am. Mind you, I may not necessarily be the Ark Royal you know.<br>
...You don't need to know anything more than that.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Queen Elizabeth：</span><br>
...Very well.<br>
<span style="color:#ff9900;">Hiryuu META：</span><br>
Please don't take offense, she's always like this. Having said that, perhaps you should take a leaf out of her book.<br>
Getting back on topic... Based on all your actions up to this point, it's safe to say you in fact are not allied with Antiochus.<br>
That being the case, I'd like to propose a temporary truce between us. Together, we can get out of this sticky situation. What do you say?<br>
<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项1："Girls, what do you think?"</span>'''''<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Queen Elizabeth：</span><br>
What do I think? Thinking and making decisions is your job, you doltish servant!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Enterprise：</span><br>
It's your call, Commander. I'm behind you either way.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Essex：</span><br>
I can't say whether the Ashes are friends or foes, but if nothing else, they can be reasoned with. Sirens, meanwhile, are the antithesis of everything we stand for.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Saratoga：</span><br>
Things probably aren't quite that clear-cut. Just saying...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Memphis：</span><br>
If nothing else, this is a good opportunity to gather intel on the Ashes. That's worth something.<br>
<span style="color:#ff9900;">Hiryuu META：</span><br>
We won't stop you from taking notes. After all, we're the ones asking for help here.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Memphis：</span><br>
You sound sure we won't learn anything useful. We never wanted to fight you, you know. We just wanted to understand you. That's what the Commander wanted all along.<br>
<span style="color:#ff9900;">Hiryuu META：</span><br>
I see... Be that as it may, you aren't as trustworthy as you'd like to think you are. That's all I'll say on the matter.<br>
At any rate, I'm certainly not opposed to occasionally teaming up to defeat a common enemy. Like now.<br>
<span style="color:#ec5d53;">Arbiter: Temperance XIV：</span><br>
...An unexpected development has occurred. Should we abort the mission?<br>
<span style="color:#ec5d53;">Arbiter: The Hermit IX：</span><br>
Yeah, no. The risk's still well within an acceptable range. Continue as planned.<br>
<span style="color:#ec5d53;">Arbiter: Strength VIII：</span><br>
Agreed. Stick to the mission. Eliminate the invaders so we can reinstate normal test site conditions.<br>
<span style="color:#ec5d53;">Arbiter: The Hermit IX：</span><br>
I'll have faith in your assessments, then. Proceed as proposed.<br>
<br>
Doesn't look like we have much choice here but to join forces with the Ashes...<br>
"All ships! Target the Arbiters! Open fire!"<br>
<br>
<br>
"How's Vestal and the escort fleet looking?"<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Memphis：</span><br>
Thanks to the immediate reaction from the Ashes, they seem to have barely scraped by.<br>
The rest of us are in trouble, though... The Ashes can't attack while resupplying, so all the attacks they were drawing get redirected to us instead!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Saratoga：</span><br>
They've got insane defense, insane offense, and even gravity wells... Even with the Ashes' help, if this draws out, we're toast!<br>
<br>
"We need to find a way to break through, and fast..."<br>
<span style="color:#ffd000;">???：</span><br>
I'll strike them from underneath. Their attacks don't work on submarines.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Saratoga：</span><br>
Huh? An Iron Blood submarine?<br>
<span style="color:#ffd000;">U-47：</span><br>
Mhm. VIIB-class submarine, U-47, at your service.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Saratoga：</span><br>
How did you get in here?<br>
<span style="color:#ffd000;">U-47：</span><br>
Same as you. I and my team got sucked into the Singularity while scouting ahead for Iron Blood's side of the all-out offensive.<br>
And so I'm joining forces, at the Commander's request.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Memphis：</span><br>
So the Crimson Axis... were fighting Sirens with us all along!<br>
All right, Commander! Let's try striking at them with the help of our Iron Blood friends here!<br>
<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项1："Let's do it."</span>'''''<br>
<br>
Whether one sides with the Azur Lane or the Crimson Axis is unimportant to this operation. This isn't about us versus them, it's about humanity versus the Sirens.<br>
<span style="color:#ffd000;">U-47：</span><br>
All right, I'm heading off then.<br>
Ready to fire full torpedo load. Say goodnight, Arbiters...<br>
<br>
<span style="color:#ec5d53;">Arbiter: The Hermit IX：</span><br>
For some reason, weapons output 7.3% less damage than expected. A curious phenomenon.<br>
<span style="color:#ff9900;">Ark Royal META：</span><br>
They're bloody jamming my weapons systems, Hiryuu! You'll have to take over for me for a while!<br>
<span style="color:#ff9900;">Hiryuu META：</span><br>
Son of a... Always coming up with dirty new tricks to use on us...<br>
<br>
The Arbiters are focusing their jamming on the Ashes. They're open to attacks from us.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Warspite：</span><br>
The battleship fleet is locked and loaded!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Saratoga：</span><br>
Our plane squadrons are ready for takeoff too! We'll hit 'em right where it hurts!<br>
<span style="color:#ff9900;">Hiryuu META：</span><br>
(Ah, it's been ages since I was part of a large joint operation... I'm ablaze with motivation!)<br>
<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Essex：</span><br>
The Ashes are something else! Just one of them is enough to match the firepower of several of us...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Memphis：</span><br>
I'm just glad we were somehow able to make up for the reduction of Ark Royal's power.<br>
(Actually, I feel like we did more than just make up for it. I've heard the Ashes differ in how strong they each are, but I guess the gap between them and us isn't as big as we thought.)<br>
(This is crucial information for us. I'll have to add it in my report to the Commander later.)<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Essex：</span><br>
It's pretty troubling that we don't have a grasp on the true strength of the Arbiters. Stay focused.<br>
One thing's for sure though – they're strong enough to keep the Ashes on the back foot. The moment we underestimate them may be our undoing!<br>
<span style="color:#ec5d53;">Arbiter: The Hermit IX：</span><br>
Look at that, the test subject fleet possesses firepower exceeding our estimates. This is some interesting data.<br>
<span style="color:#ec5d53;">Arbiter: Strength VIII：</span><br>
Did we not just calibrate the parameters of our test vessels?<br>
<span style="color:#ec5d53;">Arbiter: The Hermit IX：</span><br>
Seems there's a discrepancy between our simulated and actual performance. Saving the data log for later.<br>
Anyway... Strength, go ahead and crank up the gravity fluctuations.<br>
<span style="color:#ec5d53;">Arbiter: Strength VIII：</span><br>
On it.<br>
<span style="color:#ec5d53;">Arbiter: The Hermit IX：</span><br>
Executing IX-XIV Linked Jamming Protocol.<br>
<br>
<span style="color:#ff9900;">Ark Royal META：</span><br>
We're in trouble... If all three of the Arbiters team up, this situation is going to get exponentially harder to deal with!<br>
<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项1："Don't give up hope!"</span>'''''<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项2："Keep up the pressure!"</span>'''''<br>
<span style="color:#ff9900;">Hiryuu META：</span><br>
You've got some determination, Commander.<br>
<br>
"I've been through my fair share of battles. The more precarious the situation, the more essential maintaining your composure is. Only by staying calm can you even begin to hope for victory."<br>
"Go and take the injured to the rear, and have our repair ships look after them! Press on!"<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Vestal：</span><br>
Leave the injured to me~ No need to worry, we're here to back you up!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Queen Elizabeth：</span><br>
The Royal Navy refuses to fall. We will persevere!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Belfast：</span><br>
Exactly as you say. Please find a safe place at the back of our ranks, Your Majesty.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Essex：</span><br>
Enterprise, your flight deck! Go get some emergency treatment, and leave this to us!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Enterprise：</span><br>
All right, will do. Hang in there!<br>
<span style="color:#ff9900;">Ark Royal META：</span><br>
...<br>
<br>
"Ashes, you've taken serious damage. Our repair ships could fix–"<br>
<span style="color:#ff9900;">Ark Royal META：</span><br>
Thanks, but we'll have to pass. You haven't even seen our true power yet.<br>
In case you weren't aware, the Arbiters will annihilate you lot the moment we relax our assault.<br>
<span style="color:#ff9900;">Hiryuu META：</span><br>
She's right. Worry about yourselves before you even begin to think about us.<br>
Having said that, it might be a good idea to take you up on that offer. Let's step back for just for a while to resupply.<br>
<span style="color:#ff9900;">Ark Royal META：</span><br>
{namecode:94}……？<br>
<span style="color:#ff9900;">Hiryuu META：</span><br>
No need to get worked up. Have you fought alone for so long that you've forgotten the other tactics available to you as an entire fleet?<br>
<br>
"Precisely. Work together with us as allies, or none of us are leaving this place...!"<br>
<br>
<span style="color:#ec5d53;">Arbiter: The Hermit IX：</span><br>
Temperance, put some pressure on their rear units. Strength, swap over to linked mode, now. We can't let the Ashes recover.<br>
<span style="color:#ec5d53;">Arbiter: Strength VIII：</span><br>
Got it. Switching Linked Jamming Protocol code from IX-VIII to VIII-IX, prioritizing mobility.<br>
<span style="color:#ec5d53;">Arbiter: Temperance XIV：</span><br>
Initiating VIII-XIV Linked Jamming Protocol. Let's see their rear guard try to heal off the damage now.<br>
<br>
<span style="color:#ff9900;">Hiryuu META：</span><br>
Do NOT let them get in formation! Keep taking them out until the Enforcers go into hiding!<br>
<span style="color:#ff9900;">Ark Royal META：</span><br>
Got it! Leave the small buggers to me!<br>
<br>
<span style="color:#ec5d53;">Arbiter: Temperance XIV：</span><br>
Not bad, but it ends here. My web was already spun before you launched your first attack. Execute combat link protocol.<br>
<span style="color:#ec5d53;">Arbiter: The Hermit IX：</span><br>
On it! Executing IX-XIV Linked Jamming Protocol!<br>
<br>
<span style="color:#ec5d53;">Arbiter: Strength VIII：</span><br>
A formidable blow, but ultimately futile. Initiating automatic repair functions.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Essex：</span><br>
She's rapidly repairing all the damage the submarines inflicted to her!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Shangri-La：</span><br>
And it's not just Strength... The other Arbiters are also repairing themselves!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Essex：</span><br>
Does that mean... all Arbiters come equipped with self-regenerating systems?<br>
<span style="color:#ec5d53;">Arbiter: Strength VIII：</span><br>
This vessel's self-repair mechanisms seem to be deficient.<br>
...But no matter. We continue the attack.<br>
<br>
"We're only going to be whittled down if this goes on, just as Saratoga said."<br>
"If only there was a way to retreat..."<br>
<span style="color:#ff9900;">Hiryuu META：</span><br>
If you want to retreat, then go right ahead. But we have no intention of running with our tails between our legs.<br>
Our goals are twofold. To defend the Singularity that our allies opened, to the bitter end; and to destroy all of our enemies in one fell swoop. Retreat isn't an option.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Memphis：</span><br>
So it really was you that created the Singularity all along.<br>
<span style="color:#ff9900;">Hiryuu META：</span><br>
You only figured it out just now?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Memphis：</span><br>
We can speculate all we want, but we couldn't know for sure until we heard it straight from your mouth.<br>
(So the things that happened to the NA Ocean aren't their fault... And if anything, it was this Singularity that allowed us to finally make a decisive move against the Sirens.)<br>
What's the purpose of you doing all this?<br>
<span style="color:#ff9900;">Hiryuu META：</span><br>
It doesn't concern you... or so I'd like to say.<br>
But that wouldn't be entirely accurate.<br>
<span style="color:#ff9900;">Ark Royal META：</span><br>
{namecode:94}！<br>
<span style="color:#ff9900;">Hiryuu META：</span><br>
Yes, I know. I have no intention of saying any more than that.<br>
Let's get down to the nitty-gritty, Commander.<br>
The Arbiters are only after us. There's no reason for you to risk your lives defending this Singularity either.<br>
If you want to retreat like you wanted to earlier, we won't stop you. I'll even tell you the way out.<br>
I swear on the 2nd CarDiv's honor that we won't turn on you. Now tell me, honestly, would you rather stay and fight, or retreat to safety?<br>
<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项1："I can't just abandon you."</span>'''''<br>
<span style="color:#ff9900;">Hiryuu META：</span><br>
So, you'll fight with us?<br>
<br>
"We may not be in a formal alliance, but we're still allies in the fight against the Sirens. We're not leaving you to fend for yourselves."<br>
<span style="color:#ff9900;">Hiryuu META：</span><br>
Cut it out. We're not your allies.<br>
...But, we are grateful for your help.<br>
You're fine with this arrangement, right? Ark Royal?<br>
<span style="color:#ff9900;">Ark Royal META：</span><br>
...You really are a puzzling personality, Commander.<br>
The Sirens are heartless creatures, basing their decisions entirely on what benefits they stand to gain. I suppose you are the opposite of that.<br>
<br>
"As we've established, we're all in this together. Despite our combined efforts, though, we're still slowly getting worn down. I'm sure you both already know we are going to lose if this battle drags on."<br>
<span style="color:#ff9900;">Hiryuu META：</span><br>
In other words, we need reinforcements.<br>
<br>
"Can you request assistance from the other Ashes? Like Enterprise, or Takao?"<br>
<span style="color:#ff9900;">Hiryuu META：</span><br>
I wouldn't hold my breath. Nobody knows when they'll come back.<br>
<br>
.........<br>
<span style="color:#ff9900;">Hiryuu META：</span><br>
However, there are still other options available to us.<br>
Ark Royal, go with the Commander, and call for reinforcements! I'm going to boost my output up to the very limits!<br>
<span style="color:#ff9900;">Ark Royal META：</span><br>
What?! Are you bloody mental, Hiryuu?!<br>
<span style="color:#ff9900;">Hiryuu META：</span><br>
Did you just notice?<br>
(I've got no choice but to pray that Enterprise's judgment was correct...)<br>
––––Antiochus! See how you like THIS!<br>
<span style="color:#ec5d53;">Arbiter: Strength VIII：</span><br>
I've finished running the combat simulation. We're almost at our limit.<br>
<span style="color:#ec5d53;">Arbiter: Temperance XIV：</span><br>
Indeed... Our energy usage has reached the maximum threshold. We cannot maintain this for much longer.<br>
Pull back, Strength. We cannot win once the Ashes launch their counterattack.<br>
<span style="color:#ec5d53;">Arbiter: Strength VIII：</span><br>
I'm detecting a surge in energy. Simulating intended purpose––<br>
<span style="color:#ec5d53;">Arbiter: The Hermit IX：</span><br>
They're probably planning to take us all out, including themselves, in a huge explosion.<br>
<span style="color:#ec5d53;">Arbiter: Temperance XIV：</span><br>
Restarting damage simulation... It shouldn't matter.<br>
An explosion of the projected magnitude within the Singularity will cause damage to our vessels... but will also prove lethal to the Ashes.<br>
We, however, can survive and reconstitute.<br>
<span style="color:#ec5d53;">Arbiter: The Hermit IX：</span><br>
Yeah, but then we'll lose our test subjects.<br>
<span style="color:#ec5d53;">Arbiter: Temperance XIV：</span><br>
That is true. They would be atomized in approximately one-thousandth of a second.<br>
<span style="color:#ec5d53;">Arbiter: The Hermit IX：</span><br>
Zero gave us instructions to minimize contact with the test subjects.<br>
<span style="color:#ec5d53;">Arbiter: Strength VIII：</span><br>
And? What's your point?<br>
<span style="color:#ec5d53;">Arbiter: Temperance XIV：</span><br>
Her point is: the explosion would cause excessive damage to the test site and subjects, making it impossible to complete our initial objective.<br>
My proposal is to allow the test subjects to live. Override your elimination directives.<br>
<span style="color:#ec5d53;">Arbiter: Strength VIII：</span><br>
......Acknowledged. Prioritizing Zero's directives. We will pursue the Ashes with new vessels.<br>
<span style="color:#ec5d53;">Arbiter: The Hermit IX：</span><br>
Ditto. Carrying out this directive would entail the failure of other, higher priority ones.<br>
Temperance, cover me. I've had enough of being outside.<br>
<span style="color:#ec5d53;">Arbiter: Temperance XIV：</span><br>
Very well... Disengaging from hostiles.<br>
<br>
I was blinded by a dazzling light. The attack and subsequent shockwaves I braced for, however... They never came.<br>
Instead, it seemed as though the world faded into pure white, all sound vanishing along with it.<br>
When the light cleared, the Arbiters and their Enforcer-class minions were all gone without a trace of their existence.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Warspite：</span><br>
Did we win...? How...?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Essex：</span><br>
Did the Arbiters retreat after feeling threatened by that attack?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Saratoga：</span><br>
That was a close call...<br>
<br>
I turned to look at the Ashes, who seemed like they'd exhausted every iota of energy within them.<br>
<span style="color:#ff9900;">Hiryuu META：</span><br>
I'm... fine... We barely managed to stop them...<br>
Don't worry about me, I'm used to this... Give me a few minutes and I'll be as good as new.<br>
<span style="color:#ff9900;">Ark Royal META：</span><br>
You madwoman... I can't believe that worked.<br>
<span style="color:#ff9900;">Hiryuu META：</span><br>
To be honest, I'm just as surprised as you that it did.<br>
(Somehow, I get the feeling that things are starting to look up now...)<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Saratoga：</span><br>
Ah, Commander! What happened to U-47?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Baltimore：</span><br>
While Arbiter was distracted, she escaped in order to contact our allies.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Memphis：</span><br>
That's a relief... We'll be able to see everyone again...<br>
<br>
"If everything's gone according to plan, then our allies on the outside should have cleared the Singularity's surroundings of all enemies already."<br>
<span style="color:#ff9900;">Hiryuu META：</span><br>
Then it's time to bid farewell. With the Arbiters gone, we have no reason to stick together.<br>
In order to get out of this Singularity, head to the exit I told you about earlier, and you should be fine.<br>
<span style="color:#ff9900;">Ark Royal META：</span><br>
We, however, still have some loose ends to tie up here.<br>
<br>
Before I could even get a word in, Ark Royal activated her camouflage and vanished. Hiryuu, on the other hand, remained in plain sight.<br>
<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项1："Where are you headed, Hiryuu?"</span>'''''<br>
<span style="color:#ff9900;">Hiryuu META：</span><br>
If you're thinking about coming with me, then don't even try. Don't make me threaten you with what I nearly used on the Arbiters a minute ago.<br>
<br>
.........<br>
<span style="color:#ff9900;">Hiryuu META：</span><br>
Sorry, let's not end this on a threat. You brought back fond memories I haven't felt in so long.<br>
I do hope we can meet again someday. Under what circumstances, I don't know. Maybe we'll share a heartfelt reunion, or we'll exchange blows as enemies.<br>
<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项1："Wait. What about the thing you said before our duel earlier?"</span>'''''<br>
<span style="color:#ff9900;">Hiryuu META：</span><br>
Ah, I did say I'd tell you something you're going to like, didn't I? Don't worry, I remember our deal.<br>
Since you and your fleet managed to stay standing by the end of it all, I'll let you in on something good.<br>
...You know what, I'll just give it to you directly...<br>
<br>
Hiryuu reached behind her back and staggered over to me.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Saratoga：</span><br>
Huh...?<br>
<br>
She then slid something into the pocket of my coat.<br>
<span style="color:#ff9900;">Hiryuu META：</span><br>
Sorry, I don't think I can tell you in front of all these people. Take this, and let's call it even.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Memphis：</span><br>
Hiryuu...<br>
<span style="color:#ff9900;">Hiryuu META：</span><br>
Now it's time for me to go, Commander.<br>
Don't worry, I'll be in touch.<br>
No, really. I already know your contact code and where your port is.<br>
...May we meet again.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Saratoga：</span><br>
She's got the same stealth camo as Ark Royal?!<br>
W-wait! Don't go!<br>
<br>
...<br>
The operation had its ups and downs, but we've successfully completed stage one of purging the ocean's core of Sirens.<br>
Although the Singularities and Mirror Seas there haven't gone away, the threat posed to the area has decreased drastically.<br>
The NA Ocean has become safer to traverse, and we're reclaiming routes previously occupied by Sirens, one at a time.<br>
All this isn't to say we can let our guards down, however.<br>
Mindless Arbiter vessels and Sirens still emerge from the Singularity from time to time, and the ever-elusive Ashes remain in the back of our minds.<br>
In order to succeed with our long-term plans, we will need more time and a bigger fleet.<br>
Once all the shipgirls that fought in this operation have received their commendations, daily life at port will resume as normal.<br>
And so, our war against the Sirens continues...<br>
Now it is time for us all to rest up in preparation for whatever challenge comes next.<br>
