<br>
Somewhere, on one distant, unknown island...<br>
Golden sunlight showered the soft beach sands. Waves lapped upon the shore, followed by a cool sea breeze.<br>
Several girls lay on the sand.<br>
As the tide rose, a cold wave caressed one girl's finger, waking her.<br>
Realizing that she was in an unfamiliar place, she sat up in a panic.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Haruna Sairenji：</span><br>
The beach? Why in the world am I here... Momo, wake up!<br>
<br>
Frantic, she shakes the girl closest to her.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Momo Belia Deviluke：</span><br>
*yaaawn*... Haruna? What's going on?<br>
Huh? Where... are we?<br>
<br>
The girl named Momo opened her eyes. Dazzling sunlight and the sound of waves made her realize that something is off.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Haruna Sairenji：</span><br>
Well... We were just sitting in class, weren't we? Why are we on the beach?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Momo Belia Deviluke：</span><br>
I say we start by waking up the others.<br>
<br>
The two of them got to work waking up the others on the beach, but they were all equally confused. Nobody had a clue what was going on.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Nana Astar Deviluke：</span><br>
What the heck is this... We were just in school, right? And before we know it, we're on some beach in the middle of god-knows-where?<br>
Do you think we were... kidnapped?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Yui Kotegawa：</span><br>
Stay calm, Nana. If this was a kidnapping, I doubt they'd leave us on a beach.<br>
And it's not like we were tied up, or anything.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Lala Satalin Deviluke：</span><br>
Huh~ Come to think of it, isn't the sand here kinda like the mountains near our school? I wonder if it's related.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Golden Darkness：</span><br>
...Some kind of prank, maybe?<br>
<br>
BEEP BEEP!<br>
While everyone debated the cause, an odd machine buried in the sand began to beep.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Momo Belia Deviluke：</span><br>
Hey, does anyone else hear something over there?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Lala Satalin Deviluke：</span><br>
Ah! That's it!<br>
<br>
Lala tore into the sand, yanked out the oddly-shaped machine, and gazed at it.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Lala Satalin Deviluke：</span><br>
This is Questy MacGuffin, my game-developing invention! Why's it here, though?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Momo Belia Deviluke：</span><br>
Lala, did that machine cause all of this?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Lala Satalin Deviluke：</span><br>
I've been working all-nighters to get it working for everyone to play, but... I might've accidentally started it up before it was done.<br>
<br>
When they learned that Lala's newest invention was unfinished, everyone shuddered from fear.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Haruna Sairenji：</span><br>
So we know why it happened. But can we return with an unfinished machine?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Lala Satalin Deviluke：</span><br>
It was in testing mode, so maybe if I do this... Huh? Wait a sec. I entered a command, but it didn't take.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Nana Astar Deviluke：</span><br>
Okay, leave it to me~! At times like this, you just gotta hit stuff!<br>
<br>
Nana ran over to the machine and struck it twice as hard as she could.<br>
Upon the attack, Lala's invention stopped beeping. The screen lit up, and a line of text appeared.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Yui Kotegawa：</span><br>
Look, it's saying something.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Lala Satalin Deviluke：</span><br>
I'll read it~<br>
"Targets: Lala, Momo, Nana, Yami, Haruna, Yui. Total: six."<br>
"Successfully connected to current world."<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Golden Darkness：</span><br>
Current world...?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Lala Satalin Deviluke：</span><br>
Yeah... I think Questy MacGuffin might've malfunctioned and sent us to another world.<br>
<br>
"An unexpected encounter. The start of a journey of wonders."<br>
"Another world? A game? Or something else entirely?<br>
"The way to adventure has opened."<br>
"Atop this deep blue sea, a new tale begins."<br>

<br>
Uncharted Island<br>
Shortly after everyone woke up<br>
The sea breeze continued to roll across the beach.<br>
Lala paced around Questy MacGuffin and tinkered with it incessantly.<br>
Everyone else seemed used to this – instead of paying her any mind, they looked around for anything useful.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Golden Darkness：</span><br>
...!<br>
<br>
Yami struck a coconut tree with her hair, knocking off several coconuts.<br>
Momo picked them up and examined them closely.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Momo Belia Deviluke：</span><br>
Hmm... They're not much different from normal coconuts. I think we could drink their water if we broke them open.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Nana Astar Deviluke：</span><br>
Woohoo! I'll help!<br>
<br>
Everyone sat under the coconut tree and refreshed themselves with coconut water.<br>
If not for the fact that they were stranded in another world, it almost felt like a tropical vacation.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Nana Astar Deviluke：</span><br>
Lala, you should hydrate.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Lala Satalin Deviluke：</span><br>
Thanks, Nana~<br>
<br>
Nana offered an open coconut to her older sister, who single-mindedly checked the device.<br>
After impatiently watching as Lala quaffed the entire coconut's worth of water, she finally broached the subject.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Nana Astar Deviluke：</span><br>
Is Questy MacGuffin going to work?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Lala Satalin Deviluke：</span><br>
Weeeell...<br>
We know this was all caused by a malfunction, at least.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Momo Belia Deviluke：</span><br>
You didn't intend for us to be transported here. Right?<br>
<br>
Momo joined in the conversation after staying quiet until this point.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Lala Satalin Deviluke：</span><br>
Right. I think the mismatch of parts might've made it unstable~<br>
Or it could be caused by an incompatible – or unstable – energy source...<br>
Either way, our tools are limited. Give me a little more time so I can really dig deep here~<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Momo Belia Deviluke：</span><br>
Okay... I trust you. If there's anyone who can figure it out, it's you.<br>
Nana and I will take care of the others until you do.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Nana Astar Deviluke：</span><br>
Yeah!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Lala Satalin Deviluke：</span><br>
Hehe, thanks. Good luck with them~<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Momo Belia Deviluke：</span><br>
That said, they don't seem all that bothered. They're almost treating it like a vacation.<br>
Why, Yami and Kotegawa are practically playing on the beach.<br>
Huh? Wait, where's Haruna?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Haruna Sairenji：</span><br>
Nooo! Stay away from meee!<br>
<br>
Eerie machines, glowing with green light, slowly closed in on the isolated girl.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Yui Kotegawa：</span><br>
Sairenji, watch out!<br>
<br>
BEEP BEEP!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Lala Satalin Deviluke：</span><br>
Whoooa?! Questy MacGuffin, what are you doing?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Questy MacGuffin：</span><br>
ACTIVATING ARMAMENT SYSTEM.<br>
<br>
When the flood of light subsided, new machines – rigging – had appeared on each of the girls.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Nana Astar Deviluke：</span><br>
Whoa! What the heck is this?!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Golden Darkness：</span><br>
New power...?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Momo Belia Deviluke：</span><br>
That scared me.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Lala Satalin Deviluke：</span><br>
Weird... I only put swords and magic into the armament system.<br>
I think Questy MacGuffin must have automatically adjusted things to match this world.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Yui Kotegawa：</span><br>
Either way, we can't let those enemies get close to Sairenji!<br>
Everyone, ready for combat!<br>
{{折叠面板|内容结束}}

{{折叠面板|标题=A Rigging Test Drive|选项=3|主框=1|样式=primary|展开=是}}
<br>
Shortly after...<br>
Everyone put their new rigging to good use, easily fending off the enemy.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Haruna Sairenji：</span><br>
So if I'm understanding this right, Lala thinks that this situation and this equipment were all made by Questy MacGuffin?<br>
<br>
Once the battle was over, the girls pondered over the wreckage, their new equipment, and how it all related to each other.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Lala Satalin Deviluke：</span><br>
Yep. I bet Questy designed those for this game based on the world it generated.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Golden Darkness：</span><br>
They're not very cute...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Haruna Sairenji：</span><br>
Huh? Really...? I thought they were plenty cute.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Lala Satalin Deviluke：</span><br>
They're not really what I imagined, though~<br>
I bet you Questy decided to adjust THEM to fit the world, just like it did our gear~<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Momo Belia Deviluke：</span><br>
Knowing your skills, I'm not surprised that you'd be able to make such a flexible game...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Lala Satalin Deviluke：</span><br>
Hehe, so don't worry, everyone! Our rigging is a million times stronger than they are.<br>
Strong enough to protect us!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Yui Kotegawa：</span><br>
Either way, stay vigilant.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Haruna Sairenji：</span><br>
Yeah... We still don't know anything about this place.<br>
And there are hostile creatures... Maybe we should discuss a course of action first.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Nana Astar Deviluke：</span><br>
Wait, look!<br>
There's black mist over the ocean!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Momo Belia Deviluke：</span><br>
It doesn't... look like those things from before, at least...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Golden Darkness：</span><br>
I'll protect Haruna Sairenji and Yui Kotegawa...<br>
Rest assured and focus on offense.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Lala Satalin Deviluke：</span><br>
Thanks, Yami~ You're a big help!<br>
Okay, everyone, stay close together~<br>
Let's go see what's going on over there!<br>
{{折叠面板|内容结束}}

{{折叠面板|标题=The Royal Navy Strikes|选项=4|主框=1|样式=primary|展开=是}}
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Nana Astar Deviluke：</span><br>
Whoa! Lala, watch out!<br>
<br>
Lala was too focused on tinkering with Questy MacGuffin to realize that she was under attack, but Nana and Momo managed to push her out of the way in time.<br>
KABOOOOM!<br>
The attack grazed her rigging before striking the water, making a big splash.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Momo Belia Deviluke：</span><br>
Is everyone okay?!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Lala Satalin Deviluke：</span><br>
That was close~ Thanks, Nana and Momo! I look away for one second, and I end up almost getting hurt~<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Yui Kotegawa：</span><br>
This thing is strong... It's nothing like the enemies from before!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Golden Darkness：</span><br>
...I'll take care of this.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Haruna Sairenji：</span><br>
This one's movements and attacks are totally different from the others.<br>
Yami, I don't think it's safe even for you to approach it alone.<br>
<br>
While everyone argued over how to defeat this one, Lala had a moment of inspiration and spoke up.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Lala Satalin Deviluke：</span><br>
Everyone, wait just a sec!<br>
If I do this... Okay. This should work~<br>
<br>
By Lala's hands and her newfound power, the broken Questy MacGuffin was born anew.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Questy MacGuffin：</span><br>
ANALYZING TARGET.<br>
THREAT LEVEL: HIGH. FRONTAL ASSAULT ILL ADVISED. FIGHT PRUDENTLY.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Lala Satalin Deviluke：</span><br>
So we can't fight it head-on...?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Momo Belia Deviluke：</span><br>
Do you have a plan?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Lala Satalin Deviluke：</span><br>
If Questy's analysis and my own deductions are right...<br>
Everyone cover me! I think I've figured out its weakness!<br>
<br>
<br>
KABOOOOM!<br>
With that last blow, the enormous enemy slowly sank into the ocean.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Nana Astar Deviluke：</span><br>
Woohoo! Down for the count!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Haruna Sairenji：</span><br>
*sigh*...<br>
<br>
However, with that sigh of relief came a change.<br>
The enemy's wreckage shone with an eerie red light, and the waters around it began to whip up into a roil.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Golden Darkness：</span><br>
Danger! Everyone, retreat!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Questy MacGuffin：</span><br>
WARNING. RIGGING POWER INSUFFICIENT.<br>
WARNING! ENEMY HIGH-ENERGY REACTION!<br>
RETREAT IMMEDIATELY!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Nana Astar Deviluke：</span><br>
What?! My rigging's gotten all sluggish!<br>
<br>
They desperately tried to pilot their slowed rigging away from the explosion.<br>
But it was too late. The explosion sent a wave of fire that quickly closed in–<br>
However, in that instant, they heard a woman's voice in the distance.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Queen Elizabeth：</span><br>
Bel, save them!<br>
<br>
A powerful force burst above them, blowing away the shockwave and flames alike with ease.<br>
Shortly after, when the smoke had cleared, the woman they'd heard finally showed herself.<br>
She and her companions approached, each equipped with their own rigging.<br>
Standing at the front of them was a girl with striking blonde hair – the one who'd given the order before.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Queen Elizabeth：</span><br>
Salutations, visitors from another world!<br>
I am Queen Elizabeth of the Royal Navy! Under my protection, you have nothing to fear!<br>
{{折叠面板|内容结束}}

{{折叠面板|标题=A Queen's Invitation|选项=5|主框=1|样式=primary|展开=是}}
<br>
Somewhere in an unknown sea<br>
Wind brushed across the water, as if wiping away all traces of the battle.<br>
The sea breeze blew away all the smoke, bringing the blue surface to its usual beauty.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Queen Elizabeth：</span><br>
Welcome, guests from afar.<br>
Heehee, how do I know you come from another world? It's hardly surprising.<br>
Your uniquely shaped rigging – and the enemies that appeared alongside you – tell the whole tale.<br>
It's happened enough times by now, frankly, that I should hope I'm not dense enough to miss that.<br>
Ahem! Rest assured. I am not your enemy. In fact, you should count yourselves lucky that you've encountered me today!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Lala Satalin Deviluke：</span><br>
I'm Lala Satalin Deviluke, from Planet Deviluke. Call me Lala~ Happy to make your acquaintance!<br>
These are my little sisters, Momo Belia Deviluke and Nana Astar Deviluke. They're both really good girls!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Momo Belia Deviluke：</span><br>
A pleasure to meet you. Please just call me Momo.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Nana Astar Deviluke：</span><br>
Same, just Nana is fine.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Golden Darkness：</span><br>
I'm Golden Darkness.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Haruna Sairenji：</span><br>
We all call her Yami, though.<br>
Mind if they do the same?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Golden Darkness：</span><br>
That's fine...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Haruna Sairenji：</span><br>
Hello. My name is Haruna Sairenji. I'm from Earth, and I'm a normal human... Um, is that good enough?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Yui Kotegawa：</span><br>
And I'm Yui Kotegawa. Like Sairenji, I'm just a human from planet Earth.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Queen Elizabeth：</span><br>
Wait... Planet Deviluke? And "normal human"?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Yui Kotegawa：</span><br>
Umm, it's a bit of a long story... Either way, we're all just good friends.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Haruna Sairenji：</span><br>
Lala and her sisters are princesses from Planet Deviluke, but we're all classmates.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Queen Elizabeth：</span><br>
Hmm. Not just from another world, but real aliens at that... There's a first time for everything.<br>
Either way, you're guests – and some of you royalty at that. There's no need to be formal with me.<br>
Call me Elizabeth, please. If you need anything, don't hesitate to ask my maids.<br>
But first... may I ask you to tell me about this "Questy MacGuffin" of yours?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Lala Satalin Deviluke：</span><br>
Sure! Umm, so... Basically, I developed it as a game console.<br>
When I input everyone's data and throw in common enemy data from other games, along with other stuff...<br>
It can make fun fantasy adventure games! It can even make enemies that match the situation for us to fight!<br>
I wanted everyone to play it so badly that I worked so many nights on it~<br>
But we ended up here. Maybe because I was rushing so much to gather parts...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Queen Elizabeth：</span><br>
Oh, I see. So those odd enemies were created by your Questy MacGuffin, too.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Lala Satalin Deviluke：</span><br>
Yeah, it's kind of a problem~ Questy's out of my control now, and it keeps making enemies. Worse than that, it's making special variations...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Queen Elizabeth：</span><br>
Then it's possible that more will appear... We must do something about this posthaste.<br>
<br>
Elizabeth and her entourage turned serious.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Queen Elizabeth：</span><br>
Bel, change of plans. Take our guests to the nearest base.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Belfast：</span><br>
As you wish.<br>
Everyone, this sea region is extremely dangerous at this time. We must evacuate to a safe port at once.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Queen Elizabeth：</span><br>
Maids, prepare tea and snacks, please.<br>
Visitors from another world, let us drink tea together and chat along the way.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Lala Satalin Deviluke：</span><br>
Huh? We're gonna go hang out at your place?<br>
Woohoo! What are we waiting for? Let's go~<br>
{{折叠面板|内容结束}}

{{折叠面板|标题=They Return|选项=6|主框=1|样式=primary|展开=是}}
<br>
Abnormal Sea Region - Nearby port<br>
The party sailed over the shining sea at full speed.<br>
Amidst the reflecting golden sunlight, they finally saw the base in the distance.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Queen Elizabeth：</span><br>
That's the closest port. It's not especially big, but it has the necessary facilities. Let's rest there for the time being.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Lala Satalin Deviluke：</span><br>
Yay! I was just starting to get hungry~ I can only imagine what kind of tasty foods this world has in store~<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Momo Belia Deviluke：</span><br>
Lala, now isn't the time...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Nana Astar Deviluke：</span><br>
She's right. Trouble first, food later!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Lala Satalin Deviluke：</span><br>
Hey, now, we don't need to be so nervous~<br>
When I was tinkering with Questy MacGuffin, I managed to restore some of its features~<br>
It even has a hostile detection feature. See? Things are getting better already!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Yui Kotegawa：</span><br>
Need I remind you that your failed invention was what brought us here in the first place... A-anyway, we still need to be careful!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Haruna Sairenji：</span><br>
Yui's right. We're not out of the woods yet...<br>
By the way, wouldn't you be able to just smash the MacGuffin and forcefully end this game?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Lala Satalin Deviluke：</span><br>
Whoooa~ Absolutely not! We might lose our only way of getting home. It's too dangerous!<br>
And what if it malfunctioned even more while we smashed it? Things could get WORSE!<br>
<br>
BEEP BEEP!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Questy MacGuffin：</span><br>
WARNING! MULTIPLE HOSTILES APPROACHING!<br>
WARNING! HOSTILE ENERGY INCREASING!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Lala Satalin Deviluke：</span><br>
Huh? Why? We just beat up so many of them.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Belfast：</span><br>
Your Majesty, it seems the situation has changed.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Queen Elizabeth：</span><br>
Everyone, on alert!<br>
Lala, has your rigging recovered its combat abilities?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Lala Satalin Deviluke：</span><br>
Yep! It recovered on its own after we took down that big one. Let's do this!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Queen Elizabeth：</span><br>
Very helpful! Come, Royal Maids. We fight!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Belfast, Liverpool, Scylla：</span><br>
Understood!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Nana Astar Deviluke：</span><br>
Hell yeah! I get to go wild again!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Momo Belia Deviluke：</span><br>
Careful, Nana. Yami, please watch after Kotegawa and Haruna for us.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Lala Satalin Deviluke：</span><br>
Here we go, party people!<br>
<br>
KABOOOOM!<br>
Cannonfire flew wildly over the ocean, blanketing the sea in billowing smoke.<br>
Lala's group helped the Royal Navy intercept the encroaching enemy.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Nana Astar Deviluke：</span><br>
Take this! Get a load of my true power!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Momo Belia Deviluke：</span><br>
Don't push yourself too hard, Nana!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Nana Astar Deviluke：</span><br>
Heheh. Don't worry, I don't even break a sweat against these things!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Belfast：</span><br>
Halt, please! The enemy is acting strangely.<br>
<br>
Just as victory seemed to come into view, the situation changed again.<br>
The tattered enemies emitted a strange light, and their plating began to repair on its own.<br>
Worse, their bombardment only became more intense.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Nana Astar Deviluke：</span><br>
Why the hell are they just getting stronger?!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Yui Kotegawa：</span><br>
Our attacks are just becoming ineffective, too, aren't they?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Golden Darkness：</span><br>
We need to hurry...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Queen Elizabeth：</span><br>
Lala, do you have a plan?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Lala Satalin Deviluke：</span><br>
Hmm...<br>
<br>
She furrowed her brow and carefully observed Questy MacGuffin.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Lala Satalin Deviluke：</span><br>
Hmm... I think the real-time adjustment function is broken, too.<br>
This thing thinks that we AND this whole world are all part of the game.<br>
Now that our party has grown, it's trying to calculate the correct enemy strength for a smooth difficulty curve...<br>
I'm sorry... It's all because of my invention...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Queen Elizabeth：</span><br>
Don't worry about it. This is hardly the most dire situation we've ever been in.<br>
Focus on the enemy first! We can think about what to do with that machine afterward!<br>
{{折叠面板|内容结束}}

{{折叠面板|标题=The Doppelganger's Challenge|选项=7|主框=1|样式=primary|展开=是}}
<br>
The continuing battle engulfed the nearby area in yet more cannonfire and smoke.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Nana Astar Deviluke：</span><br>
Tch! They just keep getting stronger!<br>
Can't you use your Questy MacGuffin to lower the difficulty, or something?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Momo Belia Deviluke：</span><br>
I think we'd have more luck finding a way with our own power instead of relying on that unstable game console.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Golden Darkness：</span><br>
Be careful... New hostiles approach.<br>
<br>
Yami pointed at the center of the enemy fleet.<br>
Among the hostiles was a very familiar figure.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Nana Astar Deviluke：</span><br>
I-is that...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Haruna Sairenji：</span><br>
Kotegawa...?<br>
<br>
The girl standing there looked and dressed exactly like Yui Kotegawa.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Momo Belia Deviluke：</span><br>
There's no emotion in her eyes. She must be a doppelganger made by Questy.<br>
<br>
The doppelganger's rigging exuded energy readings that far surpassed the others around it.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Nana Astar Deviluke：</span><br>
Tch! So it's not happy just making copies of us – it forces us to fight them, too...<br>
That Questy MacGuffin of yours is downright wicked!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Yui Kotegawa：</span><br>
......<br>
<br>
As for Yui Kotegawa herself, she stayed silent and firmly grasped the weapon in her hand.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Queen Elizabeth：</span><br>
Hmm? Does that mean it's able to mass-produce ships just like the Sirens?<br>
If things get too difficult, then retreat. My fleet can handle this just fine.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Momo Belia Deviluke：</span><br>
Don't worry about us. That's just a fake, and we have the real Yui Kotegawa on our side!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Yui Kotegawa：</span><br>
We'll fight with you!<br>
<br>
KABOOOOM!<br>
A rain of cannonfire fell upon the doppelganger.<br>
However, an energy barrier protected it at the very last moment. It took no damage whatsoever from the volley.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Lala Satalin Deviluke：</span><br>
Wh-whyyy?! Questy, this is too mean~<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Questy MacGuffin：</span><br>
WARNING: IF YOU FOCUS YOUR FIREPOWER, YOU CAN BREAK THE ENEMY'S DEFENSES.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Lala Satalin Deviluke：</span><br>
In that case... Everyone, focus on that one right there!<br>
<br>
<br>
KABOOOOM!<br>
Strong or not, the doppelganger gradually began to falter in the face of their combined assault.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Yui Kotegawa：</span><br>
Take this, you faker!<br>
<br>
Yui Kotegawa launched her own powerful attack on the copy of herself.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Nana Astar Deviluke：</span><br>
Heheh, this doppelganger isn't THAT strong.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Momo Belia Deviluke：</span><br>
Kotegawa, Nana! Don't let your guard down!<br>
<br>
Perhaps responding to Momo's warning, the doppelganger suddenly burst with a harsh light. Everyone surrounding it was forced back.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Lala Satalin Deviluke：</span><br>
What's going on now?<br>
<br>
When the light faded, the doppelganger was gone – replaced with a crystallization of energy that gleamed with an eerie light.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Lala Satalin Deviluke：</span><br>
Oh... That's right! When I was developing Questy, I figured every game needs an overarching goal.<br>
So I made it so that you get special Energy Stones when you take down certain foes~ I think that's one of those!<br>
If we get a lot of them, we should unlock new powers. They might even help us get back to our world!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Momo Belia Deviluke：</span><br>
Are you saying we can go home if we gather them all?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Lala Satalin Deviluke：</span><br>
Yep! I think so!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Golden Darkness：</span><br>
You make it sound simple...<br>
Defeating doppelgangers isn't easy.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Queen Elizabeth：</span><br>
Well, at least you have a plan now. That must count for something.<br>
And with a clear objective in mind, the port can provide more targeted support.<br>
Now, I believe the battlefield has settled for the time being. No point in staying here – shall we return to the base and rest?<br>
{{折叠面板|内容结束}}

<br>
After their battle, the gang finally arrived at a base of operations on the exterior of this port.<br>
Due to its proximity to the fighting, it looked almost bleak under the sunset.<br>
However, the lounge – decorated under Elizabeth's own direction – was no less luxurious for it.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Nana Astar Deviluke：</span><br>
Phew~ Glad we took that thing down. I'm starving!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Momo Belia Deviluke：</span><br>
Nana, we just got out of combat and you're already talking about food...<br>
We still don't know when, or if, we'll be able to go home.<br>
We sisters and Yami may be used to combat, but this must be difficult for Haruna and Kotegawa...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Haruna Sairenji：</span><br>
Wow~ These snacks are delicious!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Yui Kotegawa：</span><br>
S-Sairenji... It's not polite to stand and eat...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Haruna Sairenji：</span><br>
R-right. But it's just so good, I couldn't help myself.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Liverpool：</span><br>
Heheh~ Eat all you want! We Royal Maids pride ourselves on our tea and snacks♪<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Newcastle：</span><br>
We made black tea as well. You're very welcome to partake.<br>
<br>
Haruna and Yui graciously availed themselves of the Royal Maids' warm hospitality.<br>
Warped to another world, forced to risk their lives in combat... Despite what they'd been subjected to, they hardly seemed bothered.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Nana Astar Deviluke：</span><br>
Heheh, see? You worry too much, Momo!<br>
Ooh! Can I have one of those snacks, too?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Momo Belia Deviluke：</span><br>
Nana...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Queen Elizabeth：</span><br>
Hmm. So those two aren't experienced fighters? See to it that they get plenty of rest!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Lala Satalin Deviluke：</span><br>
Yep! We gotta be well-rested if we want to gather those Energy Stones!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Momo Belia Deviluke：</span><br>
Wait, Lala. There's still something we must do first...<br>
<br>
Momo looked upon the destroyed buildings in the distance and tried to warn her sister of something, but she hesitated.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Lala Satalin Deviluke：</span><br>
Oh, right... Those baddies only did so much damage because my Questy MacGuffin was malfunctioning.<br>
<br>
Lala lowered her head sadly.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Queen Elizabeth：</span><br>
It's okay. After all...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Lala Satalin Deviluke：</span><br>
Oh! I just had a great idea!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Queen Elizabeth：</span><br>
Hmm?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Lala Satalin Deviluke：</span><br>
If my hypothesis is correct... there may be a way to repair the base with Energy Stones!<br>
<br>
Lala produced a bunch of strange machine parts and got to work slapping together some kind of contraption.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Momo Belia Deviluke：</span><br>
Ah... She's gotten serious.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Queen Elizabeth：</span><br>
Are you inventing something? If you need any help...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Momo Belia Deviluke：</span><br>
We appreciate the thought, but when she gets like this, there's no stopping her.<br>
We should just keep eating and watch the magic happen.<br>
<br>
Thus began one peaceful tea party.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Momo Belia Deviluke：</span><br>
Here you go. Open up~<br>
<br>
Momo picked up a piece of cake with her fork and carried it to the mouth of her sister, who was hard at work building her device.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Lala Satalin Deviluke：</span><br>
Aaah~<br>
<br>
Lala opened her mouth wide and accepted the offering, never stopping her work.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Lala Satalin Deviluke：</span><br>
*munch* *munch*... Oh! All done!<br>
Now, if I just put that Energy Stone in...<br>
<br>
She placed the Energy Stone they'd just obtained inside. After a moment, the device emitted soft light that spread to envelop the base.<br>
As it did, the roads and buildings damaged in the fighting were restored to their usual state in no time.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Liverpool：</span><br>
Wow... It's like magic!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Scylla：</span><br>
Did it just clean up the fallen leaves, too...?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Queen Elizabeth：</span><br>
Hmm... Technology from Planet Deviluke is truly fascinating!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Lala Satalin Deviluke：</span><br>
Hehe, this is small beans~<br>
<br>
Lala breathed a contented sigh of relief. The base wasn't just back to normal – it was better than ever.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Lala Satalin Deviluke：</span><br>
Phew~ I'm hungry. More cake, please!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Queen Elizabeth：</span><br>
We have plenty♪<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Belfast：</span><br>
Enjoy, Lala.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Lala Satalin Deviluke：</span><br>
Wooow, thanks!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Queen Elizabeth：</span><br>
There's plenty more where that came from. We have time to spare, too. Tell me more about your world, please!<br>

<br>
The girls talked about Planet Deviluke over delicious tea and snacks.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Queen Elizabeth：</span><br>
Heehee... What interesting things I've learned today.<br>
Well, don't you worry. The port and I will do our very best to help you!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Momo Belia Deviluke：</span><br>
Say, Miss Elizabeth? When you say "the port" will help, what exactly do you mean?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Queen Elizabeth：</span><br>
I suppose you could say... While I support you, I am also receiving support from elsewhere.<br>
Incidentally, Lala, I believe you said that you'd be able to go home if you gathered enough Energy Stones?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Lala Satalin Deviluke：</span><br>
Yep~<br>
I noticed something when I was fixing up the base. The Energy Stone is made out of the same material as Questy MacGuffin's power source~<br>
I dunno if it's just how I set it up, or if there's another reason...<br>
But energy condensed into an Energy Stone and went into the doppelganger. That might be why Questy went haywire.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Momo Belia Deviluke：</span><br>
So Questy's original game was to send us into an unfamiliar world, generate enemies, and give us an adventure...<br>
But it used up all of its energy sending us here and making enemies, so it started malfunctioning?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Nana Astar Deviluke：</span><br>
Ooh! This is starting to make some sense...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Lala Satalin Deviluke：</span><br>
Th-that might be possible... H-haha...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Queen Elizabeth：</span><br>
Hmm... I think I've grasped the situation.<br>
In that case, we must be more cautious with Lala's technology and said "energy."<br>
If left unchecked, the doppelgangers' Energy Stones could fall into enemy hands and become an even greater threat.<br>
Bel, when will the reinforcements from port arrive?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Belfast：</span><br>
Your Majesty... I'm afraid our communication link with port has been severed.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Queen Elizabeth：</span><br>
.........<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Momo Belia Deviluke：</span><br>
Severed...? Is the enemy attacking there, too?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Queen Elizabeth：</span><br>
No, that's patently impossible.<br>
It's more likely that the abnormal phenomena you've brought into this world have isolated this region.<br>
...But now isn't the time to worry about that.<br>
If there's no way to communicate with port, then we'll simply have to mobilize the forces garrisoned nearby.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Lala Satalin Deviluke：</span><br>
Really?! Thanks, Elizabeth!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Momo Belia Deviluke：</span><br>
Lala, please. Calm yourself.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Lala Satalin Deviluke：</span><br>
Oh, sorry~ I was just a little excited...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Haruna Sairenji：</span><br>
Umm, so... Things are going to be okay, as I understand it?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Yui Kotegawa：</span><br>
Thank you so much for all of your help, Miss Elizabeth!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Queen Elizabeth：</span><br>
Heehee~ Don't mention it! Selflessness is a well-known virtue of mine.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Lala Satalin Deviluke：</span><br>
By the way, I made this to help us find the Energy Stones faster!<br>
<br>
Lala took an oddly-shaped antenna out of her pocket.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Lala Satalin Deviluke：</span><br>
If I attach this to Questy, it'll show us the general location of each stone~<br>
<br>
She attached the antenna to Questy MacGuffin.<br>
Questy emitted a few radar-like waves...<br>
...And several flashing dots appeared on the screen.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Lala Satalin Deviluke：</span><br>
It worked! These dots show the places with the strongest Energy Stone reactions!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Queen Elizabeth：</span><br>
Bel, have the fleet prepare to sortie.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Belfast：</span><br>
It will be done, Your Majesty.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Queen Elizabeth：</span><br>
Just you wait, girls! As soon as they're ready, we're weighing anchor, too!<br>

<br>
Doppelganger Activity Zone - First Checkpoint<br>
An exploration team consisting of Nana, Yui, Liverpool, Devonshire, and Nubian searched the nearby sea.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Nana Astar Deviluke：</span><br>
Weird... This should be the area Questy pointed out, right?<br>
But there's no sign of hostiles whatsoever.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Yui Kotegawa：</span><br>
It is quiet here... Too quiet. Everyone, now is the time to be alert.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Liverpool：</span><br>
Kotegawa is right. Maintain vigilance...<br>
<br>
Before she could finish speaking, artillery fire whooshed by and then exploded behind them. Enemies had appeared on the horizon.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Nana Astar Deviluke：</span><br>
Heh, finally come out to play? Here I thought they'd gotten scared and ran!<br>
<br>
The team quickly launched a counterattack, supporting each other throughout.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Nana Astar Deviluke：</span><br>
Hm? Were these things this weak before?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Yui Kotegawa：</span><br>
Their attacks seem so... sloppy. And the power behind each one is so much less than before.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Devonshire：</span><br>
Do you think they're getting weaker because that Questy MacGuffin thing is starting to work again?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Nubian：</span><br>
Maybe! Like, what if it had energy left over after fixing the base, and it used it to repair itself?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Nana Astar Deviluke：</span><br>
I say we just fight and figure it out as we go. Let's kick butt!<br>
<br>
In no time, the first exploration team had trounced their targets. However, they found no trace of the Energy Stone.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Nana Astar Deviluke：</span><br>
Darn it! If there's no Energy Stone here, then that was a total waste of time!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Yui Kotegawa：</span><br>
Devonshire, can you report the situation to Elizabeth for us? I have a bad feeling about this.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Devonshire：</span><br>
Understood. I'll contact Her Majesty at once.<br>

<br>
Doppelganger Activity Zone - Second Checkpoint<br>
Meanwhile...<br>
At the second checkpoint, a team consisting of Momo, Haruna, Sirius, Dido, and Scylla was likewise beset by hostiles.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Momo Belia Deviluke：</span><br>
Something is off...<br>
<br>
Momo furrowed her brow as she watched the enemy on the distant waters.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Haruna Sairenji：</span><br>
What's the matter? Did something weird happen?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Momo Belia Deviluke：</span><br>
Yes. It's just a feeling... but the time and place where they appear feels almost prearranged.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Scylla：</span><br>
Momo, are you saying...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Momo Belia Deviluke：</span><br>
What if they're intentionally trying to lure us here?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Dido：</span><br>
Lure us? For what?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Momo Belia Deviluke：</span><br>
To divide our forces, perhaps? It's just a hypothesis, though.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Scylla：</span><br>
I cannot refute that possibility. We should be prepared for the worst.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Sirius：</span><br>
Be prepared... But how? What preparations can we make?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Momo Belia Deviluke：</span><br>
Avoid doing anything impulsive. We don't want to poke the hornet's nest.<br>
<br>
Momo steered her rigging slowly toward the enemy.<br>
As she'd expected, after a quick skirmish, they gradually began to retreat.<br>
Ever maintaining a specific distance between themselves and Momo's team, as if trying to lead them off somewhere...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Dido：</span><br>
What should we do?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Momo Belia Deviluke：</span><br>
Either way, there's no ignoring them. Let's fight, but be wary of our surroundings.<br>
<br>
The second exploration team tried to close in on their marks, but no matter how they tried, the distance between them never shrank.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Haruna Sairenji：</span><br>
Weird... Why can't we catch up with them?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Sirius：</span><br>
Surely it's not that we're just too slow.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Momo Belia Deviluke：</span><br>
If we're comparing specs, then ours should be better than theirs.<br>
Wait! They're different from the ones we encountered before.<br>
Did they... discard their weaponry for the sake of more mobility?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Scylla：</span><br>
I'm afraid I don't follow.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Momo Belia Deviluke：</span><br>
...I'd like to contact the other teams. Can you prepare the communicator?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Scylla：</span><br>
Yes, ma'am. Devonshire, Belfast. Do you read me?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Communicator：</span><br>
............<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Momo Belia Deviluke：</span><br>
Odd.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Scylla：</span><br>
Your Majesty, can you hear me? Your Majesty!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Communicator：</span><br>
............<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Scylla：</span><br>
Momo. We need to reach Her Majesty posthaste.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Momo Belia Deviluke：</span><br>
Agreed. Let's hurry!<br>
{{折叠面板|内容结束}}

{{折叠面板|标题=Third Checkpoint|选项=12|主框=1|样式=primary|展开=是}}
<br>
Doppelganger Activity Zone - Third Checkpoint<br>
Shortly before...<br>
The main force of the exploration fleet – Lala, Golden Darkness, Queen Elizabeth, and Belfast – proceeded toward the third checkpoint.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Lala Satalin Deviluke：</span><br>
Questy MacGuffin's readings say the Energy Stone is dead ahead!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Queen Elizabeth：</span><br>
Very good. Let's hurry and retrieve it!<br>
<br>
Under Her Majesty's orders, the team sped along the waves toward their objective.<br>
However, as they approached it, she was seized by a vague, yet powerful sense of anxiety.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Queen Elizabeth：</span><br>
(Something is wrong. My mind won't stop racing...)<br>
<br>
She slowed down slightly and probed for the source of that anxiety.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Belfast：</span><br>
Your Majesty, is something wrong?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Queen Elizabeth：</span><br>
I have a bad feeling about this.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Golden Darkness：</span><br>
...You do, too?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Queen Elizabeth：</span><br>
Bel. Can you reach the other teams?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Communicator：</span><br>
BZZT... BZZT...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Belfast：</span><br>
Our communications are jammed. Your Majesty, we appear to be isolated.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Queen Elizabeth：</span><br>
I knew it... Nothing can ever be that easy.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Lala Satalin Deviluke：</span><br>
What? What happened?<br>
Don't worry! As long as Nana and Momo are there, your people won't get hurt!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Belfast：</span><br>
No, Miss Lala, the enemy isn't after them.<br>
It's after you – or perhaps the Questy MacGuffin you bear.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Queen Elizabeth：</span><br>
Everyone, prepare for combat!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Golden Darkness：</span><br>
...<br>
<br>
Without a word, Golden Darkness checked her rigging status and gazed ahead with cold eyes.<br>
Her line of sight was directed firmly toward red spots of light – hostiles in the distance.<br>
{{折叠面板|内容结束}}

{{折叠面板|标题=Balance Update|选项=13|主框=1|样式=primary|展开=是}}
<br>
KABOOOOM!<br>
Seemingly infinite hostiles flooded in from all directions, perfectly surrounding the group.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Lala Satalin Deviluke：</span><br>
Whoooa~ There are so many! Questy, you've gone too far this time!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Queen Elizabeth：</span><br>
Hmph! What a welcome party... So it was a trap after all.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Golden Darkness：</span><br>
Princess, don't stray too far from me.<br>
<br>
Golden Darkness stepped in front of Lala and cast her sharp eyes here and there, searching for a way to break out of the encirclement.<br>
Meanwhile, Belfast skillfully sank any and all that were foolish enough to approach.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Belfast：</span><br>
Your Majesty, their numbers continue to increase. Awaiting orders.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Queen Elizabeth：</span><br>
It's not time to panic yet. This is but an easy victory.<br>
Bel, prioritize the safety of our guests!<br>
<br>
Even as she gave orders, she fired at enemies in the distance. They returned fire likewise.<br>
Yet the enemy fire was too dense. Some of it slipped through the Royal Navy's defenses and landed dangerously close to Lala.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Lala Satalin Deviluke：</span><br>
Whoa!<br>
B-by the way...<br>
<br>
Lala recalled Belfast's theory from before – about who the enemy was truly after.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Lala Satalin Deviluke：</span><br>
Oh...! I know! I know why they're after me instead of Elizabeth!<br>
<br>
She pointed at the MacGuffin in her hand and spoke up excitedly.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Lala Satalin Deviluke：</span><br>
It's because I set myself as the protagonist of the game! So they naturally come and try to get me!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Queen Elizabeth：</span><br>
I see...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Lala Satalin Deviluke：</span><br>
Now that we know that, it's simple! I'll draw their attention, and you all make a getaway!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Golden Darkness：</span><br>
Princess!<br>
<br>
Leaving them with no time to protest, Lala turned around and rushed into the hail of artillery fire.<br>
<br>
<br>
KABOOOOM!<br>
On the chaotic battlefield, Lala weaved through shot after shot as she beelined for the center of the enemy's formation.<br>
However, despite her extraordinary physical prowess and powerful rigging, she was gradually being cornered.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Golden Darkness：</span><br>
Princess!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Belfast：</span><br>
Miss Lala, don't do anything rash!<br>
<br>
The others followed and desperately tried to provide support, but she was still stalled by the sheer numbers she faced.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Lala Satalin Deviluke：</span><br>
Huh?! Why are you all... Why didn't you run?!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Queen Elizabeth：</span><br>
We couldn't simply abandon an ally in need!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Golden Darkness：</span><br>
Princess, you're too impulsive...<br>
<br>
KABOOOOM!<br>
Cannonfire could be heard coming from another direction, marking the appearance of more enemy reinforcements.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Nana Astar Deviluke：</span><br>
Lala, are you okay?!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Momo Belia Deviluke：</span><br>
These things and their dirty tricks...<br>
<span style="color:#ff9b93;">Haruna, Steel Protector：</span><br>
......<br>
<span style="color:#ff9b93;">Yui, Winged Vanguard：</span><br>
......<br>
<br>
There stood doppelgangers of both Haruna and Yui.<br>
The energy waves emanating from their rigging were staggering, too, leaving the party speechless.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Nana Astar Deviluke：</span><br>
Tch... They even copied Haruna?!<br>
Who's next? Me? Momo?! And then Lala herself...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Queen Elizabeth：</span><br>
What immense pressure... And my attacks do nothing to them!<br>
They'd fit these mass-produced ships with adaptive defense systems?!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Lala Satalin Deviluke：</span><br>
Ah!<br>
<br>
Those words seemed to jog Lala's mind. She hurriedly checked the settings of Questy MacGuffin.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Lala Satalin Deviluke：</span><br>
Oh, nooo~ I know what this is! I think it's Questy's game balance updating feature!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Momo Belia Deviluke：</span><br>
Lala, are you saying...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Lala Satalin Deviluke：</span><br>
If we have too many allies and it judges the current situation too easy, it'll start adjusting the game balance!<br>
That means the enemy's just going to keep getting stronger. Heck, it might make us weaker in the process!<br>
<br>
Right on cue, the girls found that their rigging was suddenly much weaker.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Nana Astar Deviluke：</span><br>
Wh-what the hell? I can't use my rigging!<br>
Questy, you're resorting to some real BS artificial difficulty!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Yui Kotegawa：</span><br>
M-my rigging can hardly even keep balance...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Haruna Sairenji：</span><br>
Maybe this is the end after all...<br>
<br>
KABOOOOM!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Queen Elizabeth：</span><br>
Hmph! Your balance adjustments mean nothing in the face of my Royal Navy fleet!<br>
Bel, evacuate our guests! The rest of you, join me in buying time for them!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Belfast：</span><br>
Very well.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Golden Darkness：</span><br>
Princess, you must escape...<br>
<br>
For some reason, Golden Darkness joined them on the front line.<br>
KABOOOOM!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Lala Satalin Deviluke：</span><br>
Yami!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Belfast：</span><br>
I will guide you to safety. Rest assured that Yami will be safe in Her Majesty's hands.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Queen Elizabeth：</span><br>
Royal Navy, we fight!<br>
<br>
<br>
However, finding a way out of the encirclement proved difficult.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Yui Kotegawa：</span><br>
Wh-where do these things keep coming from?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Haruna Sairenji：</span><br>
P-please... Stay away from me!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Nana Astar Deviluke：</span><br>
What... They came out of the water?!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Scylla：</span><br>
This is bad. Head maid, the enemy is trying to capture our guests!<br>
<br>
KABOOOOM!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Belfast：</span><br>
No... It's too late!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Momo Belia Deviluke：</span><br>
Haruna! Kotegawa!<br>
<br>
It happened in an instant. Haruna and Sairenji were surrounded by doppelgangers and spirited away in what seemed like no time.<br>

<br>
With the kidnapping of Haruna and Yui, Questy MacGuffin seemed to deem balance restored. With that, it restored the Deviluke sisters' rigging to working order.<br>
Many enemies remained, but with the party's restored fighting strength, they were able to fight the rest off.<br>
However, the victory was not a joyous one. Lala was especially anxious, but there was nothing she could do now.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Lala Satalin Deviluke：</span><br>
Ugh... What are we supposed to do?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Momo Belia Deviluke：</span><br>
I'm sure they're okay, Lala.<br>
Questy is just a device that simulates adventures. It wouldn't really hurt Haruna and Kotegawa, I'm sure.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Lala Satalin Deviluke：</span><br>
But it's malfunctioning...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Nana Astar Deviluke：</span><br>
Look at this!<br>
<br>
Questy MacGuffin's monitor displayed the vital signs of Haruna and Yui, proving that they were still alive and well.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Lala Satalin Deviluke：</span><br>
Huh?! Wow, you're right! I didn't know Questy could monitor players' game states, too!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Momo Belia Deviluke：</span><br>
Lala, I don't want to imagine this, but did you forget about a feature YOU implemented?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Lala Satalin Deviluke：</span><br>
Hahaha... I was so focused on fixing it that I forgot...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Queen Elizabeth：</span><br>
I see... Fascinating.<br>
Will we be able to save your friends if we go there?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Lala Satalin Deviluke：</span><br>
Yep! I think so!<br>
Mm, but...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Queen Elizabeth：</span><br>
If you have concerns, then out with them. We don't have time to waste.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Lala Satalin Deviluke：</span><br>
Hmm... The enemies are getting smarter and smarter. I just wonder if this is a trap, too...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Queen Elizabeth：</span><br>
You do have a point, yes, but we have backup. My Royal Navy main fleet will be here in no time!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Communicator：</span><br>
BEEP BEEP!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Queen Elizabeth：</span><br>
Vanguard, has the trip been smooth?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Vanguard：</span><br>
The enemy made some effort to disrupt us, but we suffered no casualties. We expect to arrive at the nearest port to you on time!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Queen Elizabeth：</span><br>
That won't be necessary. We'll be setting sail again, so rendezvous with us at the coordinates I'm sending you now!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Vanguard：</span><br>
Did you say "again"?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Queen Elizabeth：</span><br>
Ahem.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Vanguard：</span><br>
Understood, Your Majesty!<br>
{{折叠面板|内容结束}}

{{折叠面板|标题=Turning the Tables|选项=15|主框=1|样式=primary|展开=是}}
<br>
Using the coordinates displayed on Questy MacGuffin, the group charged into an unfamiliar sea region.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Lala Satalin Deviluke：</span><br>
If the tracking system is trustworthy, then Haruna and Yui should be nearby~<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Queen Elizabeth：</span><br>
All is well so far.<br>
I suppose that means it's time for the enemy to appear.<br>
<br>
Seemingly endless enemies appeared on the water, confirming her suspicions.<br>
Unlike the ones from before, though, they had more advanced equipment. Their firepower seemed bolstered, as well.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Nana Astar Deviluke：</span><br>
Hey, now... They're just gonna keep getting harder to fight, aren't they?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Vanguard：</span><br>
We can handle this fleet well enough. You all should try to preserve your energy.<br>
<br>
KABOOOOM!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Monarch：</span><br>
All ships, fire at will! We're settling this one fast!<br>
<br>
<br>
After a hard-fought battle, the Royal Navy had finally reached their destination.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Lala Satalin Deviluke：</span><br>
Haruna! Yui! Where are you?!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Yui Kotegawa：</span><br>
Over here!<br>
<br>
Someone quickly replied to Lala's calls – it was Yui, who was being restrained by a doppelganger alongside Haruna.<br>
<span style="color:#ff9b93;">Nana, Wave Guardian：</span><br>
......<br>
<span style="color:#ff9b93;">Momo, Wind Sentinel：</span><br>
......<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Nana Astar Deviluke：</span><br>
Hah! A doppelganger of me, huh? Well, get ready to see what the real one can do!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Lala Satalin Deviluke：</span><br>
Haruna! Yui! We're gonna come save you right away!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Momo Belia Deviluke：</span><br>
Everyone, be careful! They're definitely plotting something!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Nana Astar Deviluke：</span><br>
They're using hostages to keep us from fighting them?! Grr, that's a coward's move!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Queen Elizabeth：</span><br>
Hmph. If they think that's going to work, then they're quite wrong!<br>
Golden Darkness. If I give you an opening, can you save the hostages?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Golden Darkness：</span><br>
Leave it to me.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Queen Elizabeth：</span><br>
I'll mobilize my own reserve forces, too!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Communicator：</span><br>
BEEP BEEP!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Queen Elizabeth：</span><br>
Illustrious. Status on the carrier-based craft?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Illustrious：</span><br>
Launch preparations are complete. We await your orders, Your Majesty.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Nana Astar Deviluke：</span><br>
You have even more reinforcements? You're not half bad!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Queen Elizabeth：</span><br>
Don't underestimate the queen of the Royal Navy!<br>
Taking hostages is a foolish move against Queen Elizabeth!<br>
Illustrious, launch the carrier-based craft. Make an opening to save the hostages!<br>
Everyone else, provide cover!<br>
Let the operation begin!<br>
<br>
<br>
KABOOOOM!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Haruna Sairenji & Yui Kotegawa：</span><br>
Yami!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Golden Darkness：</span><br>
...Mission complete.<br>
{{折叠面板|内容结束}}

{{折叠面板|标题=The Final Challenge|选项=16|主框=1|样式=primary|展开=是}}
<br>
With everyone's help, Golden Darkness was able to rescue Yui and Haruna.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Lala Satalin Deviluke：</span><br>
Now I take this parameter, and... Bam!<br>
Nice! Now Questy shouldn't be able to do anything bad to us anymore!<br>
<br>
Lala finished fiddling with the device and smiled in satisfaction. She'd made quite a bit of progress in the course of the battle.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Yui Kotegawa：</span><br>
That's great! We can fight without reserve now!<br>
<br>
Enemies sunk one after another, backed by the roaring of cannons. Lala took every opportunity to snatch up the Energy Stones that appeared.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Lala Satalin Deviluke：</span><br>
Woohoo~ Let's keep on pressing the advantage!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Nana Astar Deviluke：</span><br>
I'll smash 'em to bits!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Queen Elizabeth：</span><br>
Wait!<br>
<br>
Before the Deviluke sisters could give chase, Queen Elizabeth ordered them to stop.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Nana Astar Deviluke：</span><br>
Hm? What's wrong?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Queen Elizabeth：</span><br>
Be careful. I have a really bad feeling about this.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Golden Darkness：</span><br>
...I sense something enormously powerful.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Questy MacGuffin：</span><br>
WARNING! WARNING! SUPER-HIGH ENERGY LEVELS DETECTED!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Lala Satalin Deviluke：</span><br>
Huh? What's wrong, Questy?! I thought your speech function was broken...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Nana Astar Deviluke：</span><br>
Lala, now isn't the time to think about that! What's this about super-high energy levels?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Momo Belia Deviluke：</span><br>
Lala, Nana! Look over there!<br>
<br>
In the direction she pointed, an intimidating figure was approaching at alarming speed.<br>
It resembled Lala, yet it had a dangerous air totally unlike hers... A doppelganger.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Lala Satalin Deviluke：</span><br>
Huh?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Nana Astar Deviluke：</span><br>
Wh-what's with that thing?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Yui Kotegawa：</span><br>
It's nothing like the previous doppelgangers... Have they evolved even further?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Queen Elizabeth：</span><br>
H-Hmm. A formidable one, indeed...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Lala Satalin Deviluke：</span><br>
No way...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Momo Belia Deviluke：</span><br>
Lala...?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Lala Satalin Deviluke：</span><br>
Is this Questy MacGuffin's final challenge?!<br>
<br>
<br>
KABOOOOM!<br>
<span style="color:#ff9b93;">Lala, Final Spark：</span><br>
YOU... DARE...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Haruna Sairenji：</span><br>
Huh? Did it just talk?!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Yui Kotegawa：</span><br>
Are you telling me that doppelganger is intelligent?<br>
<br>
While the party was stunned by this revelation, the Lala doppelganger burst into ominous red light.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Queen Elizabeth：</span><br>
This is bad! Bel, position the mass-produced ships to shield us!<br>
Everyone, fall back!<br>
<br>
The blinding light became an enormous fireball, engulfing everything alongside a world-shaking shockwave.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Queen Elizabeth：</span><br>
Ugh... Status report, everyone?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Nana Astar Deviluke：</span><br>
*cough* *cough*... That was close.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Yui Kotegawa：</span><br>
*pant*... Is everyone okay?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Haruna Sairenji：</span><br>
I-I'm fine...<br>
<span style="color:#ff9b93;">Lala, Final Spark：</span><br>
.........<br>
<br>
The same doppelganger who'd just detonated mere moments ago appeared before them once more.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Lala Satalin Deviluke：</span><br>
N-no way...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Questy MacGuffin：</span><br>
WARNING! WARNING! ACTIVATING FINAL DEFENSE SYSTEM!<br>
ENTERING FINAL CHALLENGE LEVEL!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Queen Elizabeth：</span><br>
...Final challenge level?<br>
<br>
A big red countdown appeared on Questy MacGuffin's display.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Questy MacGuffin：</span><br>
"TEN, NINE, EIGHT..."<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Monarch：</span><br>
It seems we must overcome this final challenge before it will allow our safe return.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Vanguard：</span><br>
Ugh... Of course.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Queen Elizabeth：</span><br>
Fine by me. Let this be one of the many glorious victories of Queen Elizabeth!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Lala Satalin Deviluke：</span><br>
Momo, Nana, Yami, Haruna, Yui...<br>
This is our final battle! Let's kick butt, girls!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Momo Belia Deviluke：</span><br>
Leave it to me, sis.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Nana Astar Deviluke：</span><br>
You're wasting your breath. I'm always ready to kick butt!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Golden Darkness：</span><br>
I'll fight with you, Princess.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Haruna Sairenji：</span><br>
I-I believe in you, Lala...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Yui Kotegawa：</span><br>
Hmph. Breaking the rules, disturbing the peace, attacking people at random... It's high time someone punished them!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Queen Elizabeth：</span><br>
Royal Navy, attack!<br>
<br>
<br>
KABOOOOM!<br>
As the doppelganger fleet brought all to bear, the battle only intensified.<br>
Dense weapons fire showered down on the Royal Navy like rain, and the damaged doppelganger automatically repaired herself.<br>
She looked all the more intimidating as she absorbed energy from her companions and glowed with eerie red light.<br>
And as she absorbed more energy, her attacks became more and more ferocious.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Nana Astar Deviluke：</span><br>
There's no end to these things! As long as Lala's doppelganger is there, they'll just keep spawning reinforcements forever!<br>
Every single one of them just feeds her power, too...<br>
Tch. This is a losing battle at this rate.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Yui Kotegawa：</span><br>
I agree... It's only a matter of time until we're cornered.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Queen Elizabeth：</span><br>
Hm? Lala and Momo, do you have some kind of plan...?<br>
In that case, all forces, take a defensive posture! We must buy them time!<br>
<br>
KABOOOOM!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Momo Belia Deviluke：</span><br>
Lala, I've figured out her attack patterns. They are complex and varied, but they seem to be based on a set algorithm.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Lala Satalin Deviluke：</span><br>
Yeah! I noticed that, too, and I bet it's because of Questy's program settings!<br>
If we analyze that pattern and find a weakness, we could turn this fight on its head!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Momo Belia Deviluke：</span><br>
Then I'll draw her attention. It's up to you to lead the fight!<br>
<br>
Momo promptly charged toward the doppelganger's fleet, found an ideal opening, and attacked from an unexpected angle.<br>
Meanwhile, Lala used Questy MacGuffin and her own observation of the doppelganger's fleet to analyze their movements.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Lala Satalin Deviluke：</span><br>
Everyone, listen up!<br>
About 3.5 seconds after the next time the doppelganger attacks, she'll raise her right hand. That's when she's vulnerable!<br>
Attack all at once during that opening!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Queen Elizabeth：</span><br>
Knowing their opening in advance... Hah!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Vanguard：</span><br>
Worry not, Miss Lala! We will not miss this opportunity!<br>
<br>
On Lala's orders, the party adjusted their attack rhythm and waited for the doppelganger to become vulnerable.<br>
And indeed, just as Lala had pointed out, the doppelganger raise her right hand after attacking and became vulnerable.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Golden Darkness：</span><br>
...Now!<br>
<br>
KABOOOOM!<br>
The fake Lala's plating was destroyed, revealing something inside that flashed like an Energy Stone.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Lala Satalin Deviluke：</span><br>
That's her core! Destroy that, and she's done for!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Queen Elizabeth：</span><br>
Finish this! Royal Navy, attack!<br>
<br>
KABOOOOM!<br>
After the deafening roar of artillery, the core was obliterated without a trace, and the doppelganger fell. All of the hostile ships around it disintegrated and sank deep into the sea.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Lala Satalin Deviluke：</span><br>
We did it! Final challenge complete~<br>
{{折叠面板|内容结束}}

{{折叠面板|标题=The Epilogue's Only Just Begun|选项=17|主框=1|样式=primary|展开=是}}
<br>
When the Lala doppelganger was fully destroyed, Energy Stones started raining out of her shattered core.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Lala Satalin Deviluke：</span><br>
Wow, no wonder that was the last challenge. There are so many!<br>
We'll use these ones to repair the damage from the battle, and these ones to fix Questy...<br>
And then this last one... Yep! This should be enough!<br>
<br>
Her eyes shone as she divided up the Energy Stones based on what they would be used for.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Queen Elizabeth：</span><br>
You're going home already?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Lala Satalin Deviluke：</span><br>
Yeah~ People back on Earth are probably worried! Thanks for all your hospitality and help~!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Queen Elizabeth：</span><br>
It was our pleasure. I hope you'll come back for tea again some time.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Illustrious：</span><br>
It was truly an honour to fight alongside you.<br>
I don't know if we'll ever meet again, but our port always welcomes guests from other worlds with open arms♪<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Yui Kotegawa：</span><br>
I feel a lot better now that I got to do violence against ne'er-do-wells. Thanks for your help!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Haruna Sairenji：</span><br>
We caused so much trouble for you all, yet you were nothing but kind to us. Thank you, really.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Nana Astar Deviluke：</span><br>
Heheh, honestly, I doubt we'd be alive right now if not for the Royal Navy's help.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Momo Belia Deviluke：</span><br>
Agreed. I'm happy that you picked us up so soon after our arrival here.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Golden Darkness：</span><br>
Belfast's snacks...<br>
They weren't taiyaki, but I'll never forget them.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Belfast：</span><br>
Take care on your way home, Miss Yami.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Lala Satalin Deviluke：</span><br>
Ooh... Ooooh...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Momo Belia Deviluke：</span><br>
Lala? What's the matter? Is something wrong with Questy again?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Lala Satalin Deviluke：</span><br>
I just feel so bad. What if we stayed here a little longer?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Nana Astar Deviluke：</span><br>
I get how you feel, Lala, but we can't do that.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Haruna Sairenji：</span><br>
We have schoolwork... We'd essentially be playing hooky.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Yui Kotegawa：</span><br>
She's right. School is important.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Lala Satalin Deviluke：</span><br>
Y-yeah! Y-you're right!<br>
Okay... Questy MacGuffin, activate your warp program!<br>
<br>
Questy MacGuffin absorbed the final Energy Stone in her hand and glowed softly...<br>
But then, with a concerning sizzling sound, Questy MacGuffin spat out a puff of white smoke.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Nana Astar Deviluke：</span><br>
Wh-what the heck? Is it supposed to do that?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Lala Satalin Deviluke：</span><br>
Hmm... Why did it do that? I thought we were good this time...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Momo Belia Deviluke：</span><br>
Questy's ailment may be worse than we expected.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Haruna Sairenji：</span><br>
I hope it's okay.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Queen Elizabeth：</span><br>
Bel, do we have communication with port?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Belfast：</span><br>
Yes. Our lines have been fully restored.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Queen Elizabeth：</span><br>
Heehee. Let my servant know about all that's happened today, please.<br>
It's almost time for the Commander to step in.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Belfast：</span><br>
Yes, Your Majesty.<br>
Your Majesty, we received word from Master.<br>
"Come to port. Akashi's here, too."<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Queen Elizabeth：</span><br>
Heheh. It's about time we put that cat to proper work!<br>
Why don't you all come with us? Consider it an extended vacation.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Illustrious：</span><br>
Lovely idea. Don't we deserve a rest after that fight?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Lala Satalin Deviluke：</span><br>
Really?! We get to go to that port you're always talking about?<br>
And does that mean we get to meet more of you?<br>
Hooray! I can't wait!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Nana Astar Deviluke：</span><br>
Meh. Guess I wouldn't mind seeing it.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Momo Belia Deviluke：</span><br>
Of course! We've been through so much. Who could fault us for taking a little break?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Yui Kotegawa：</span><br>
If I can't do it at home, then I'll just have to uphold morals at port.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Haruna Sairenji：</span><br>
If we're stuck here, we might as well have fun.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Golden Darkness：</span><br>
...Do they have taiyaki?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Liverpool：</span><br>
