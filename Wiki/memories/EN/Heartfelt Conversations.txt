<span style="color:#4eb24e;">TB：</span><br>
I'm sleepy... I wanna hear a story.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Oh, do you like bedtime stories? That's good to know. I thought you didn't.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">TB：</span><br>
What does... "like" mean?<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Umm... You can "like" in all kinds of ways.<br>
There's liking things, then there's liking people. Basically, it's a feeling of wanting that thing or person to never go away.<br>
(Hmm... She's probably too young to understand it.)<br>
(I should have explained it differently. That's an error on my part.)<br>
<br>
The little girl stares at me, no sign of emotion on her face at all, then tells me...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">TB：</span><br>
I like it... when you read to me.<br>
<br>
That's lovely. I'll have to find a first-rate story for her tonight!<br>

<br>
I feel a tug on my shirt. I look down and see TB, silently gazing up at me.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
What's up? Are you hungry?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">TB：</span><br>
Mhm... I wanna eat.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
What should I make? That meal you liked last week?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">TB：</span><br>
No... It's not good anymore.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
(Even TB can get tired of eating the same food, I suppose.)<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">TB：</span><br>
I want something different.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Alright, I'll cook up something new next week. Pick whatever you want to eat.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">TB：</span><br>
I'm not picky... I'll eat anything you make.<br>
<br>
I crack a wry smile and pat her on the head. I'll definitely do some reading on cooking later.<br>

{{折叠面板|标题=New Clothes|选项=3|主框=1|样式=primary|展开=是}}
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">TB：</span><br>
{tb}……<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Yeah? What is it?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">TB：</span><br>
My outfit... Was it cute?<br>
<br>
Ah, she must be asking what I thought about the clothes she wore at her performance.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Yeah, it was wonderful. You looked so cute in those new clothes.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">TB：</span><br>
You too...<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Me too?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">TB：</span><br>
You're cute and wonderful...<br>
<br>
Being called cute – by a young TB, no less – renders me speechless, but I'm also touched at the same time.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
That's us. Cute and wonderful people.<br>

{{折叠面板|标题=Plushie|选项=4|主框=1|样式=primary|展开=是}}
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">TB：</span><br>
It's not here...<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
What are you up to, TB?<br>
<br>
She is walking around in circles in her room.<br>
As usual, her expression tells me nothing, but I can clearly tell that she's worked up and anxious.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">TB：</span><br>
My plushie is gone...<br>
<br>
Plushie? Oh, she must mean that white... thing she's always carrying around.<br>
I stowed it in the closet after she went to school.<br>
I had no idea putting it away would make her this stressed out... I feel a bit guilty now.<br>
Opening the closet, I take the plushie and give it back to her. It manages to calm her down.<br>
What a strange plushie it is, though. I really wonder what creature it's based on.<br>
{{折叠面板|内容结束}}

{{折叠面板|标题=Allowance|选项=5|主框=1|样式=primary|展开=是}}
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">TB：</span><br>
Why can't I have more, {tb}?<br>
<br>
TB stares at me with a serious look in her eyes.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
I'm not saying it's out of the question, but why do you need a bigger allowance?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">TB：</span><br>
Because children need money that they can spend however they want.<br>
It deepens their understanding of money and the economic system.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
That's a very... formal argument. My counterpoint is this – you're still young.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">TB：</span><br>
{tb}, are you one of those adults who "save" their kid's allowance and birthday money, then spend it on frivolous stuff?<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
...Fine, fine. Here, take this.<br>
<br>
Once more, she makes me cave into giving her more pocket money...<br>
{{折叠面板|内容结束}}

{{折叠面板|标题=Television|选项=6|主框=1|样式=primary|展开=是}}
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">TB：</span><br>
I've figured out who the perpetrator is.<br>
<br>
Sat in front of the TV, TB confidently begins explaining her deduction.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Have you finished your homework?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">TB：</span><br>
Analysis... The criminal must've... Then gone to... And finally...<br>
<br>
She doesn't answer me – her focus is entirely on the show as she mutters her theory.<br>
On the one hand, it's a solid deduction. On the other...<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
TB. Hey. Your homework.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">TB：</span><br>
I'll do it after I've seen the ending. I'm in the middle of analyzing all the important evidence.<br>
<br>
Well... I suppose neglecting your homework is an important part of growing up, too.<br>
{{折叠面板|内容结束}}

{{折叠面板|标题=Growing Pains - Sports|选项=7|主框=1|样式=primary|展开=是}}
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">TB：</span><br>
Do you know anything about sports, {tb}?<br>
I've hit a slump with my sprinting and I can't get my lap time any lower.<br>
<br>
So that's why she's been acting anxious today.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Before I answer that – do you like sprinting in and of itself, or do you just care about getting good grades?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">TB：</span><br>
Sprinting is good for your health and improves your physical stamina.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
That's... true, but it doesn't answer my question.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">TB：</span><br>
...I think I like sprinting in and of itself.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Then there's no reason to worry about lap times or grades.<br>
All you have to do is keep sprinting to get something out of it.<br>
<br>
The next day, I was informed that TB had gotten better at sprinting.<br>
{{折叠面板|内容结束}}

{{折叠面板|标题=Plushie|选项=8|主框=1|样式=primary|展开=是}}
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">TB：</span><br>
{tb}, I've done the laundry and dried our clothes.<br>
<br>
TB fluffs up the tail of the plushie in her hands. Looks like she dried it as well while she was at it.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Wait, can you bring your plushie to school? Since when?<br>
<br>
Now that I think about it, she's been doing that for a few days, but I didn't think anything of it before now.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">TB：</span><br>
It's against the school rules, but...<br>
I have my ways.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
...No harm in that, I guess.<br>
<br>
It seems there is still room for improvement in her school's policies.<br>
{{折叠面板|内容结束}}

{{折叠面板|标题=Club Activity I|选项=9|主框=1|样式=primary|展开=是}}
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">TB：</span><br>
...Look at this.<br>
<br>
TB places a flyer on the table in front of me.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
What are these? School activities? Did you want to ask for my opinion?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">TB：</span><br>
Not really "ask for your opinion," more like ask you to pick one. I'm tired of doing it myself.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
(Of course. She's too cool to be honest about it...)<br>
Then let's work it out starting with the obvious one. Do any of the clubs appeal to you?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">TB：</span><br>
Not really.<br>
That's the thing. I don't care much for any of them, so I can't decide.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
(She's grown into a girl who's indecisive about a lot... Could you consider that a personality?)<br>
<br>
When all is said and done, my only suggestion for her was to try out every club she might like and decide after that.<br>
{{折叠面板|内容结束}}

{{折叠面板|标题=Club Activity II|选项=10|主框=1|样式=primary|展开=是}}
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">TB：</span><br>
{tb}, do you have a moment? I'd like some advice on what club I should apply to.<br>
<br>
With an anxious look, she softly places a flyer on the table in front of me.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
How about... going with a club dedicated to what you like?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">TB：</span><br>
That's the issue. I don't know which of them to choose...<br>
More specifically, I don't have any real hobbies, so none of them jump out at me.<br>
I'm even starting to consider just trying them all out before I decide...<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
I mean, what's wrong with that? Trying things until you find something you like is an option.<br>
<br>
After mulling it over for a while, she accepts my advice.<br>
Here's hoping she'll find something she enjoys.<br>

{{折叠面板|标题=Club Activity III|选项=11|主框=1|样式=primary|展开=是}}
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">TB：</span><br>
Hey, {tb}! I want your help with picking one of these!<br>
<br>
TB thrusts a flyer before my face before I get the chance to say a word.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">TB：</span><br>
I've got no clue which one to go with and it's kinda making me wanna try 'em all!<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Oh, you're looking to join a club. Then how about choosing one based on what you like the most?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">TB：</span><br>
Good idea! But there doesn't seem to be any comic book reading club. Maybe I should make one myself!<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
I don't think they'll let you get away with just reading comics. You'll have to choose between the ones on the flyer.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">TB：</span><br>
Really? Aww... Wait! There's no rule that says I can't pick EVERY club, is there?<br>
Because if not, that's what I'm gonna do! Oh, I'm such a frickin' genius!<br>
<br>
I want to say that she won't last long doing that, but seeing how excited the idea makes her, I hold my tongue. Don't want to rain on her parade.<br>
Besides, it's good to try all kinds of things. I hope she'll come upon her true hobby.<br>

{{折叠面板|标题=Observation Diary I|选项=12|主框=1|样式=primary|展开=是}}
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">TB：</span><br>
......<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Do you need something?<br>
<br>
I had to ask. TB's gaze has been fixated on me for an hour at this point.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">TB：</span><br>
Not really. I'm just keeping an observation diary for a school project.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Wait... An "observation diary"? Are you observing me?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">TB：</span><br>
Yes...?<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Could you, like, study something else? Like an animal or a bug.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">TB：</span><br>
No. That's more effort.<br>
<br>
She hits me with a hard "no" and goes back to observing me.<br>
On the bright side, at least she'll finish her homework faster this way.<br>
{{折叠面板|内容结束}}

{{折叠面板|标题=Observation Diary II|选项=13|主框=1|样式=primary|展开=是}}
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">TB：</span><br>
Say, {tb}, what do you do at home while I'm at school?<br>
Also, what's your favorite food? I already know, but I'm asking just to be sure.<br>
While I'm at it, what TV shows do you watch? What clothes do you like to wear? What–<br>
<br>
TB fires off a barrage of questions about my daily life. Why is she asking all this?<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
What's with all these questions?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">TB：</span><br>
Oh, sorry, I'm so scatterbrained I forgot to explain. I'm asking for an observation diary I'm going to present at school.<br>
I know you well, but I don't know many of the things the form wants me to fill in, so...<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
I think that's because these kinds of studies are typically not conducted on people.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">TB：</span><br>
Huh? They aren't?<br>
<br>
I shake my head. Just as I'm about to suggest something else for her to study...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">TB：</span><br>
Be that as it may, I want to study you anyway. Shall we continue?<br>
<br>
Left with no choice, I answer her questions and help fill out her observation diary.<br>
{{折叠面板|内容结束}}

{{折叠面板|标题=Observation Diary III|选项=14|主框=1|样式=primary|展开=是}}
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">TB：</span><br>
{tb}! Hey, {tb}! Help me fill this out!<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
..."Write details about your observation subject"? What's this about?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">TB：</span><br>
What's it sound like? My homework is to keep an observation diary!<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Well, yeah, I can tell that much. I'm asking, "Am I the one being observed here?"<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">TB：</span><br>
Bingo! You're gonna make my diary the most unique in the whole class! I'm such a genius!<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Oh, it'll definitely be unique, but people aren't ordinarily the subject for this sort of thing.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">TB：</span><br>
What? So this is, like, not allowed?<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
I didn't mean that it's not allowed, I'm just saying–<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">TB：</span><br>
Great, then it's all good! Come now, subject! A bold new future awaits!<br>
<br>
In the end... I have to just run with it and help with her homework.<br>
{{折叠面板|内容结束}}

{{折叠面板|标题=A Reward I|选项=15|主框=1|样式=primary|展开=是}}
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">TB：</span><br>
I've finished my homework and my chores.<br>
......<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Good... Uh, why are you staring at me?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">TB：</span><br>
This is the part where you say, "You're the best" or give me some kind of reward.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Oh. You're spoiled, is what you're saying.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">TB：</span><br>
Am not. It's not being spoiled to ask for recognition for my hard work.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Alright, then I'll cook dinner for you, my hardworking princess. I'll fry you an egg for extra nutrition, too.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">TB：</span><br>
I didn't do all that work just for a fried egg... but thanks. Be careful so you don't burn it.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Of course.<br>
<br>
Kids her age... So hard to work with.<br>
{{折叠面板|内容结束}}

{{折叠面板|标题=A Reward II|选项=16|主框=1|样式=primary|展开=是}}
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">TB：</span><br>
{tb}, is there anything else I can do for you? Like give you a shoulder massage, or something.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
You've done your chores and finished your homework. That's plenty. You can just relax now.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">TB：</span><br>
Yes, but those are things I was meant to do anyway. So, if you don't need a shoulder rub, how about...<br>
I know! Why don't I make dinner? Although, we don't have many ingredients... I'll fry some eggs for the extra nutrition!<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Hold your horses. Frying eggs is my job!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">TB：</span><br>
Is it? But...<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Egg-frying is dangerous business. Let me handle that at the very least!<br>
<br>
The memory of when she tried it still burns bright in my mind.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">TB：</span><br>
Hmph. Then after dinner's over, I won't speak to you until tomorrow.<br>
(I'm not a kid anymore. I can fry an egg just fine...)<br>
<br>
Sure enough, she didn't say a word to me after we ate dinner. Kids her age... So hard to work with.<br>
{{折叠面板|内容结束}}

{{折叠面板|标题=A Reward III|选项=17|主框=1|样式=primary|展开=是}}
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">TB：</span><br>
My homework and chores are all done! I'm such a good girl it's kinda crazy!<br>
<br>
I know that look. She's aching for praise.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Well, Ms. Good Girl, what do you want for a reward?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">TB：</span><br>
A reward? Aww, you're too generous!<br>
If you insist, then I'd love to practice my cooking a bit. There are eggs in the fridge, so...<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
(I hate to be a wet blanket, but the last time she tried her hand at eggs, it was a disaster. Better not let it happen again.)<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">TB：</span><br>
...Hey! What's with that sour look? You're thinking of that time I fried eggs as a kid, aren't you?!<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
That's what you call it? I call it, "That time you burned enough poor little eggs to fill a whole bowl."<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">TB：</span><br>
Wow, rude?! Just you wait! I'm gonna serve you the best, most perfect fried eggs ever one of these days!<br>
<br>
She pouts, takes a seat on the couch, and turns on the TV to watch cooking shows.<br>
Strangely, I'm looking forward to the day I'll taste her perfectly fried eggs.<br>

<span style="color:#4eb24e;">TB：</span><br>
{tb}, do you like chocolate?<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Why do you ask?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">TB：</span><br>
Just curious. Do you like it or not?<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Well... It's good for the energy boost it gives me.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">TB：</span><br>
......<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Huh? You don't have any follow-up to that?<br>
<br>
My gut tells me I said something wrong.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">TB：</span><br>
Oh, I was just thinking what a hard time you'll have. In more ways than one.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
"Hard time"...?<br>
<br>
Later on, I catch TB trying to make a concoction out of an energy drink and chocolate.<br>
{{折叠面板|内容结束}}

{{折叠面板|标题=Chocolate II|选项=19|主框=1|样式=primary|展开=是}}
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">TB：</span><br>
I just realized – I don't know your taste when it comes to chocolate.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Why does it matter?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">TB：</span><br>
Oh, well, I've been in a chocolate-making mood as of late, and I wanted to make something suited to your tastes.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Ah. Truth be told, I don't have a favorite when it comes to chocolate.<br>
That said, it's good to have if you're in need of an energy booster.<br>
So really, just make whatever kind of chocolate you want.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">TB：</span><br>
Hmph...<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
What? Did I say something wrong?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">TB：</span><br>
No, it's nothing...<br>
<br>
I get the feeling that she's a little peeved about my answer.<br>

{{折叠面板|标题=Chocolate III|选项=20|主框=1|样式=primary|展开=是}}
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">TB：</span><br>
I'll be straight to the point, {tb}! Do you want chocolate?<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Come again?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">TB：</span><br>
Chocolate! Do you want some?! Yes or no!<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
I'm not fiending for a bite, if that's what you're asking. Did you buy too much to eat on your own?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">TB：</span><br>
No, nothing like that!<br>
(I was wondering if you wanted me to make some...)<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
What was that? Make some what?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">TB：</span><br>
Nothing! Forget about it!<br>
<br>
She drops the topic right there and then. It sounds like she's going to make something.<br>

A star... A fish... A horse...<br>
An aircraft carrier... A battleship...<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
No way the clouds look like those. Let me see...<br>
<br>
I look in the direction she's pointing, and...<br>
She's right! They DO look like those things! Why did Akashi make them like that?<br>

<span style="color:#4eb24e;">TB：</span><br>
Enough... Enough...<br>
<br>
TB is reading a book and seems to have stumbled upon a complicated concept.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">TB：</span><br>
What does that mean?<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
It means not too little or too much. Just the right amount.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">TB：</span><br>
Hmm...<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
It's not always clear how much that is, I know.<br>
We'll just have to find the answer together.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">TB：</span><br>
Together... Yeah, we will.<br>

<span style="color:#4eb24e;">TB：</span><br>
{tb}……<br>
<br>
TB looks very sad.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
What's the matter?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">TB：</span><br>
I lost my wallet...<br>
<br>
She still had it when she was buying snacks on the way home.<br>
But when she got home and searched her pockets for it, it was gone.<br>
There was a month's worth of allowance in that wallet, and now it's all gone.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Oof. That's tragic...<br>
<br>
I feel so bad for her that I just have to replace the money she lost.<br>

{{折叠面板|标题=Magic|选项=24|主框=1|样式=primary|展开=是}}
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">TB：</span><br>
{tb}, is magic real?<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Magic? Umm...<br>
<br>
I can't say it isn't, or I might ruin her dreams.<br>
But I can't say it does either, obviously...<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
(Raising a kid is harder than anyone told me.)<br>
<br>
Since there is no right answer, I dodge the question by giving her a cupcake.<br>

{{折叠面板|标题=A Book|选项=25|主框=1|样式=primary|展开=是}}
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">TB：</span><br>
I want to read a book, but I don't know what kind...<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
A school book, maybe? When in doubt, educate yourself.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">TB：</span><br>
...No.<br>
It has to be about something fun.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Oh. Sorry, I can't think of any fun books off the top of my head.<br>
Tell you what, when we go out later, we'll check out the bookstore. Pick whatever book looks appealing to you.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">TB：</span><br>
Okay!<br>

<span style="color:#4eb24e;">TB：</span><br>
{tb}, what is a dream?<br>
<br>
TB sometimes asks big questions like this, and I'm never sure how to reply.<br>
It's a challenge, but that's what makes it fun to answer.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
A dream is like... a kind of hope for the future.<br>
You could also call it a goal you want to achieve deep in your heart.<br>
<br>
Answering her questions also allows me to reflect on the things I know.<br>
Just as I help her grow, she helps me grow, in a way.<br>

<span style="color:#4eb24e;">TB：</span><br>
{tb}, I want to try this drink.<br>
<br>
TB points to an ad of a glass filled with a golden liquid. Her eyes are filled with little twinkles of excitement.<br>
The problem is, that drink is meant for adults.<br>
Hang on, is it possible she'll get an update that turns her into an adult?<br>
...Regardless, she's too young for it right now.<br>
Later on, I dupe her with a glass of regular fruit juice.<br>

<span style="color:#4eb24e;">TB：</span><br>
{tb}, this dish looks interesting.<br>
<br>
TB points at the TV. It's playing an episode of a show called "Kitchen Blunders: Your Food is Cooked."<br>
They're showing a dish that, to put it nicely, makes you wonder what was going through the chef's mind.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">TB：</span><br>
I'd like to replicate this.<br>
<br>
The food's color is offputtingly vivid, and it's prepared in an alien way. I break into a cold sweat.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Trust me, you don't want to.<br>
<br>
I change the channel and distract her with a cartoon episode.<br>

<span style="color:#4eb24e;">TB：</span><br>
Whew. I'm stuffed...<br>
<br>
Snack packages lie scattered across the table. Looking at it all makes my head hurt.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
It's not healthy to eat nothing but snacks, you know.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">TB：</span><br>
Hmph.<br>
<br>
That doesn't seem to faze her. Time to turn up the heat.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Also, you can't become an adult on a diet of snacks.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">TB：</span><br>
Really? In that case...<br>
<br>
Since then, she has stopped eating snacks in large quantities.<br>

<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
What's up? Do you need help with something?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">TB：</span><br>
No... I'm just wondering if you notice anything different about me.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Different?<br>
<br>
I examine her under a magnifying glass, but fail to find anything significant.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Oh, did you learn a new skill?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">TB：</span><br>
...No. I cut my hair by 5 millimeters.<br>
<br>
After that, she seemed a bit sulky.<br>
