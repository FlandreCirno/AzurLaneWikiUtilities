As Cool As A Demon<br>
<br>
1 Freeze!<br>
I was back in my office, having just wrapped up a strategy meeting with the Sakura Empire. Upon opening the door, I felt a light breeze brush against my cheek.<br>
The curtains by my desk flapped in the wind. Evidently, I'd forgotten to close the window before I left.<br>
Right after I shut the window, there was a knock-knock on the door.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Kinu：</span><br>
Do you have a moment, Commander? There was something I forgot to tell you at the meeting.<br>
<br>
Kinu entered before I could answer the knocks. I turned around to face her, and that's when I had the life scared out of me.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Kinu：</span><br>
...Stay still. Hold it right there and don't move a muscle.<br>
Do as I say, or I can't guarantee your safety.<br>
<br>
Her face was wrinkled into a ghastly look. Intimidated by her commanding tone, I froze in place almost instinctively.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Kinu：</span><br>
Good. Now stay right there until I give you the go-ahead.<br>
You're not in danger, it's just there's a wasp resting on your– Hey! I said hold still!<br>
Keep calm and listen to me. I will now walk over to the window. Do not move until I give you permission to.<br>
<br>
Beads of cold sweat ran down my body, whereas Kinu was the spitting image of calmness. She came over and quietly threw open the window.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Kinu：</span><br>
Here is a fact about wasps: if you swing at them, they will perceive you as a threat. But stay still, and they'll do you no harm.<br>
The fact you still moved means you are either a timid lamb, or a tortoise with nerves of steel.<br>
<br>
While I did my best statue impression, she gently put a hand to my collar and allowed the wasp to walk onto it.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Kinu：</span><br>
Now I'm going to send it out through the window. Go on, shoo!<br>
There. All done... It worries me to think a little wasp could get the better of someone in your position.<br>
I mean it when I say this: you need to get stronger. Otherwise, how do you expect to control a demon such as I?<br>
<br>
I had to admit she was right. As the commander of a fleet of shipgirls, I must be strong and resolute.<br>

<br>
2 Differences in Skill<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Kinu：</span><br>
Hah. I didn't expect you'd be on board with the idea right away. How fortunate.<br>
I've yet to do my daily sword practice, which I suspect would be a good starting point for building both your muscle and discipline.<br>
Here we are. First off: do a thousand swings.<br>
...What's with that look? Are you let down because you expected something much more involved?<br>
Worry not. There is more training to be had afterward. Now take this bamboo sword and get started.<br>
Don't tell me you've exhausted yourself already?<br>
<br>
My joints were burning with pain after swinging so much. Kinu, meanwhile, was maintaining her form and spacing her breaths well. She hadn't even broke a sweat.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Kinu：</span><br>
It seems I overestimated your strength. If you can't handle a thousand swings, you definitely can't keep up with the exercises that follow.<br>
...You want to try anyway? Very well. Then let us do a bit of light sparring. En garde!<br>
<br>
After taking a minute to catch my breath, I brandished my bamboo sword, mustered all my strength, and engaged Kinu in a duel.<br>
It went just as poorly as one would expect. She either dodged or intercepted almost every strike I made at her.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Kinu：</span><br>
Hahahah! You lack the skill of a warrior, but you do have the mettle of one. That deserves praise, if nothing else.<br>
...What? You keep staring at me. To what end?<br>
You're... captivated by how pretty I look, maintaining my form and not even breaking a sweat?<br>
Fl-flatter me all you want, but I won't go easy on you just because of it.<br>
<br>
I caught a brief glimpse of a blush on her face before she turned around and resumed her sword practice.<br>

3 Demons and Men<br>
Kinu told me to meet her at a waterfall just by the mountain situated behind the port. She said it's a good place to meditate.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Kinu：</span><br>
Meditating beneath a waterfall is a superb way to work up the composure needed to remain unperturbed in the face of any battle.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Abukuma：</span><br>
Oh. Hey there.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Kinu：</span><br>
Abukuma? What are you doing out here?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Abukuma：</span><br>
What's it look like? Fishing. You're not going under the waterfall, are you, Commander? The water's cold as ice today.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Kinu：</span><br>
Oh, about that, actually...<br>
<br>
Kinu leaned in to whisper into Abukuma's ear. That felt suspicious to me, but nevertheless, I stepped forth and went barefoot into the water.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Kinu：</span><br>
Listen, Commander: no matter what happens, you musn't be distracted. You cannot allow a repeat of the wasp incident.<br>
<br>
Steeling my resolve, I went in beneath the waterfall. The water was freezing cold and crashed into me like a ceaseless tsunami.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Kinu：</span><br>
Now hold that pose and stay there. Endure the pain, soldier through the cold, and nothing will be able to shake your spirit.<br>
Let me stress this: no matter what happens! Understood?<br>
<br>
Kinu emphasizing that specific part made it sound as though she was planning something, which made me raise an eyebrow.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Abukuma：</span><br>
Just don't overdo it, all right, Commander? Also, sorry ahead of time for this.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Kinu：</span><br>
Hush, Abukuma. Not another word of that.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Abukuma：</span><br>
All right, then... Aw, shucks, I think I've got something big on the hook.<br>
<br>
For whatever reason, Abukuma started speaking with a very deadpan tone.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Abukuma：</span><br>
Oh nooo. This is a biiiig big fish. So big I can't reel it in.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Kinu：</span><br>
Stay focused, Commander.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Abukuma：</span><br>
Heeeelp, Commandeeeer. It's pulling me iiiiin... Here goes.<br>
<br>
Abukuma fell into the river. Or rather, it looked more like she jumped in by her own volition. Her "Here goes" sounded especially suspect.<br>
However, I had to do something on the odd chance she wasn't faking it. Stepping out of the waterfall, I waded through the river to help Abukuma.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Abukuma：</span><br>
Wow, uh... I didn't think the commander would fall for that.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Kinu：</span><br>
Your willingness to come to the rescue of an ally is certainly a virtue. But on the battlefield, it is a weakness that will only make matters worse.<br>
I stood right next to her as she fell in the river. You should've ordered me to jump to her rescue, not do it yourself.<br>
As long as you learn from your mistake, it's no harm done. On a more immediate note: you failed! Start over from the beginning!<br>
(Interesting... I suppose one need not BE a demon to CONTROL a demon...)<br>
<br>
Despite the stern look Kinu gave me as she ordered me to start over, I felt she was strangely pleased with my judgment call to help Abukuma.<br>

<br>
4 One of a Kind<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Kinu：</span><br>
Hmm...<br>
<br>
It had been a while since the waterfall training. Every now and then, I would catch Kinu seemingly deep in thought.<br>
One day, I was overcome with curiosity over what she might be thinking about, and I glanced a little too long.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Kinu：</span><br>
What are you staring at me for, Commander?<br>
<br>
She called me out on it. I promptly averted my gaze, but it was too late. She had noticed.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Kinu：</span><br>
...Oh, I see how it is.<br>
Don't be shy, feast your eyes. What you see is quality. It was made to be gazed at and admired.<br>
<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项1："Quality? You mean...?"</span>'''''<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项2："All right, I'll admit it. I can't take my eyes off–"</span>'''''<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Kinu：</span><br>
My cloak? Yes. It's tailor-made to suit my needs. Come, have a closer look.<br>
See the fabric, the exquisite color, and the little ornaments adorning it? They're all at no cost to practicality or comfort.<br>
Of course, it isn't a full mantle, which makes it ill-suited for cold weather, but that's a small price to pay for this one-of-a-kind masterpiece.<br>
All this is to say: you think it looks cool, don't you?<br>
<br>
Her intuition was completely off the mark.<br>
At first, I considered going with it anyway, but decided against it.<br>
I had a feeling she could gush about her cloak for quite some time, so rather than indulge her, I pointed out the need for me to finish my work.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Kinu：</span><br>
Huh? Oh, of course...<br>
Forgive me, I got carried away there. Ahem...<br>
Just out of curiosity: have you ever considered wearing a cloak? Naturally, you wouldn't look as good in one as I do, but still.<br>
<br>
If there is one thing I took away from this exchange, it's that Kinu is strangely talkative when it comes to cloaks...<br>

5 Ghosts & Demons<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Kinu：</span><br>
Your swings are starting to shape up. Well done.<br>
However, your spirit is still a far cry from serene... On the other hand, that is one of your strong points as a commander.<br>
At any rate, you've made significant progress since we started. Maybe it's time we put your courage to the test...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Isuzu：</span><br>
Oh... Hey, Kinu. And you too, Commander...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Kinu：</span><br>
What's wrong, Isuzu? You look as though you've seen a ghost.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Isuzu：</span><br>
You wouldn't believe me even if I told you...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Kinu：</span><br>
Try me. Whatever has frightened you, I will take care of it.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Isuzu：</span><br>
Well... The thing is, I DID see a ghost...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Kinu：</span><br>
You did? Where?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Isuzu：</span><br>
In the dorm... I was just dusting the dressing room when a ghost jumped at me out of nowhere...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Kinu：</span><br>
Which is to say, someone or something has infiltrated our dormitory? This warrants an investigation.<br>
<br>
Kinu and I went to the dressing room Isuzu spoke of. It was a large room filled with shelves and closets for storing outfits and garments fit for all occasions.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Kinu：</span><br>
Someone has turned off the lights... Be on your guard, Commander. The invader may still be around.<br>
<br>
I took out and turned on the flashlight we picked up on the way here. Kinu forged forward with resolute steps.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Kinu：</span><br>
Invader! I know you're in here! Come out where I can see you!<br>
...Hmm. Maybe they've already left.<br>
<br>
Kinu turned to me, and the very next moment, an inconspicious white sheet hanging opposite us began to move, as though it had waited for the chance.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Kinu：</span><br>
Commander? What are you–<br>
<br>
Swiftly, I got in front of Kinu to protect her from whatever was hiding under that sheet.<br>
Then, the sheet just harmlessly fell to the ground, like a discarded wrapper. It was no more than an ordinary white cloak.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Uranami：</span><br>
Whoopee!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Kinu：</span><br>
...What?<br>
<br>
Beneath the sheet was Uranami. We had found our "ghost."<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Kinu：</span><br>
Uranami? What the hell are you doing here?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Uranami：</span><br>
Just looking for cuties to add to my collection. Hoping to find one to the tune of a wubby-dubby chonker.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Kinu：</span><br>
And all you found was this – admittedly, cool – cloak, huh? You should keep it and wear it regularly. I know I wo–<br>
Ahem! I'm getting sidetracked. Commander, you surprised me with your quick thinking. Let me just say...<br>
...Actually, never mind. What matters is: you've definitely proven your courage today.<br>
<br>
Kinu gave me a pleased look, as though she was proud of me.<br>

<br>
6 Her Pokerface<br>
Port - An empty classroom in the academy<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Kinu：</span><br>
Right on time, Commander.<br>
Thanks for taking the time to come here. I didn't think I'd ever wear something like this, but the situation calls for something special...<br>
I can tell you're ogling me. I'm going to ask you nicely to stop it. We aren't here to do anything risqué.<br>
...My posture looks off, that's all? Oh, I see...<br>
<br>
Kinu asked me to help her accustom to an outfit she would wear while working at the refreshments stand at the academy.<br>
I didn't know exactly how I could help, but I had to do something, so I proposed an activity we could do together.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Kinu：</span><br>
A game of cards? That's not a half-bad idea.<br>
Let's keep it simple. Ten rounds, no bets. You'd be adviced not to underestimate a demon's skill over her outfit.<br>
Now go on, show me what you're made of.<br>
Well? Do we keep playing, or do you give up?<br>
<br>
She flashed a cocky smile at me. She had won every single round so far.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Kinu：</span><br>
Your inability to read my pokerface is your crippling flaw. Meanwhile, yours is so easy to read it's like your cards are written on your face.<br>
...Does emotion ever show on my face? Of course. The real question is: will you ever get to see it?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Nagara：</span><br>
Could've sworn I heard people chatting in this room... Is there actually anyone inside?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Kinu：</span><br>
Oh no!<br>
<br>
Kinu's pokerface vanished in an instant. It turned out the answer to that question was: yes.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Kinu：</span><br>
Listen, could we take a quick break? I need to–<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Nagara：</span><br>
K-Kinu?! Gosh, what is that outfit?!<br>
<br>
Nagara threw open the door. She promptly froze in surprise when she laid eyes on Kinu.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Kinu：</span><br>
Wait, Nagara! Let me explain, it's not what you–<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Nagara：</span><br>
Oh my god, you look sooo cute in it! Did the commander pick it out for you? I'm so happy for you! I'm so happy I just NEED to hug you!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Kinu：</span><br>
Don't let emotion overtake you like that! A shipgirl needs to keep a level head in face of– MMMPHH!<br>
<br>
Nagara embraced the unwilling Kinu, unwittingly smothering her in her bosom. Kinu fidgeted around, ashamed out of her mind.<br>
For being sisters, their personalities were polar opposites. Now I understood why Kinu has trouble dealing with Nagara.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Kinu：</span><br>
That was an unmitigated disaster...<br>
Just to make it clear: I don't HATE Nagara, I simply can't stand how touchy-feely she is with me.<br>
Would you do me a favor and forget the face I pulled back there? It won't happen ever again, I assure you.<br>
<br>
After Nagara left, Kinu regained her composure. She now had the same collected look like she always does.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Kinu：</span><br>
She really should learn to respect people's breathing room. Nobody appreciates an unsolicited motorboating.<br>
Although, that flaw aside, she IS a good sister... Yes, let's leave it at that.<br>
<br>
Surprisingly, right after saying she wouldn't let it happen again, a ray of emotion shone through her face.<br>

7 The Element of Surprise<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Kinu：</span><br>
There you are. I thought you'd show up.<br>
<br>
I'd come to the sports building to practice sword swings with Kinu again, as was her routine.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Kinu：</span><br>
It's time for another test. I want to see the fruits of your training.<br>
Are you ready? Then take up your sword and show me your stance.<br>
<br>
As she instructed, I grabbed a wooden sword, struck a fighting stance, and poured all my focus into a perfect strike.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Kinu：</span><br>
Hah! Clear face, straight back. Not bad, compared to when you started... But it's still far from perfect!<br>
<br>
She drew her own wooden sword, and for a moment, the air all around her seemed to whip outward.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Kinu：</span><br>
Now come at me. I challenge you to land even one hit on me.<br>
<br>
Accepting her challenge, I brandished my sword at her. It was that moment I decided to go all-out on her.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Kinu：</span><br>
Well, well!<br>
You've grown, and it shows.<br>
<br>
She gracefully struck a low pose with her sword held in both hands. Her moves were as beautiful as ever.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Kinu：</span><br>
There is something I must know. I can guess where you get your courage from when we lock swords...<br>
But from where, pray tell, do you get your confidence?<br>
<br>
"It comes from what I've learned in our time training together."<br>
"It comes from knowing your strengths, your weaknesses... and the lovable look you hide from everyone else."<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Kinu：</span><br>
Wh-what?!<br>
<br>
It was a risky tactic, but it was more than enough to make her lower her guard.<br>
While she stood dumbfounded, I went in for the decisive strike.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Kinu：</span><br>
......<br>
<br>
I knew Kinu, and that is what gave me the confidence to face her. The self-proclaimed demon isn't so daunting once you see her human side.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Kinu：</span><br>
You did it. You landed a hit.<br>
Now I understand... It took me this long, but I finally realize what it is inside you that I cannot control.<br>
Then... Let me make you an offer.<br>
<br>
She looked at me head-on and gave her offer loud and clear.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Kinu：</span><br>
You may make this demon your secretary.<br>
<br>
This proposition came out of nowhere, but I had no reason to turn it down.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Kinu：</span><br>
Splendid. Then I will devote my all to you, Commander.<br>
Use my abilities as you see fit.<br>
<br>
She faced me with a beauty, a composure, a coolness like no other shipgirl I know.<br>
