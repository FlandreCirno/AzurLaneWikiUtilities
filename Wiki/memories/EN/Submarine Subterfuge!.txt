<br>
Chapter 1: Morning Surprise<br>
Port - Office<br>
I had gone through my morning routine and was right outside the door to my office. It seemed like it was going to be a normal morning.<br>
<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项1：Open the door</span>'''''<br>
<br>
Opening the door and stepping into the office, I heard all manner of different clinks, clanks, and ticks radiating from somewhere.<br>
Listening closely, I assessed that they were coming from the back.<br>
<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项1：Look around</span>'''''<br>
<br>
I scanned the place to get an idea of what might be making the noises, but I couldn't spot anything unusual.<br>
Okay, let's stop and think for a moment. Remember yesterday...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Albacore：</span><br>
Hey, by the way, I've left a little surprise somewhere in your office~!<br>
Hehehe! Believe me when I say it'll be a bucket of laughs when you find it!<br>
<br>
A surprise? What kind of "surprise"?<br>
All of a sudden, something on one of the shelves made a clicking sound.<br>
It came from a stuffed animal that had fallen on its back. That wasn't there yesterday.<br>
<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项1：Pick it up</span>'''''<br>
<br>
Squatting to pick up and inspect the toy, I quickly realized its purpose...<br>
This was no ordinary stuffed animal... it was the trigger for a trap!<br>
Whiiish! Plonk! Splasssh!<br>
A bucket of water that had been left on the topmost shelf was knocked forwards, splashing its contents over my head and shoulders.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Albacore：</span><br>
Good morning, Commander!<br>
<br>
Albacore appeared out of the blue with a towel in one hand and a mop in the other.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Albacore：</span><br>
I've named this device the "Morning Dew Wake-Up Call"! Based on your reaction, it did its job! Hehehe~!<br>
A lot of thought went into the delivery method and the trigger mechanism to make sure only your head gets drenched! Everything went according to my plan!<br>
<br>
That little brat! I should've known!<br>
I swear I'll find one of her weaknesses and get my payback, one way or another!<br>

Chapter 2: Gato Do Your Stretches!<br>
Port - Exercise Area<br>
I went to the exercise area to observe the submarines as they were practicing.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Albacore：</span><br>
One, two! Arms, legs, shoulders, too!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">I-26 & Dace：</span><br>
One, two! Arms, legs, shoulders, too!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Albacore：</span><br>
Three, four! Hips, back, stretch some more!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">U-81 & I-19：</span><br>
Three, four! Hips, back, stretch some more!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Albacore：</span><br>
Five, six! Fingers, toes, that does the trick!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">I-58 & U-557：</span><br>
Five... six! Fingers, toes, that does the trick!<br>
<br>
It seemed that they were doing warmup stretches before going underwater.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Albacore：</span><br>
And let's not forget to stretch our backs!<br>
Repeat! Lean back, lean forward! Back, forward...<br>
That should do it for warmups! Everyone ready?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">I-26：</span><br>
Sure am! I'm warmed up and ready to go!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">I-58：</span><br>
Let's start already...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Albacore：</span><br>
Hey, wait a minute... Where's U-47?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">U81：</span><br>
Not here, she's a lone wolf! She's basically all on her own both on and off duty, y'know?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Albacore：</span><br>
Huh. Well then...<br>
I'll just have to convince her to come with us next time!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">U-557：</span><br>
I doubt... that's going to work...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Albacore：</span><br>
I can make anything work! If I can't convince her to come, then my name isn't Albacore!<br>
<br>
Albacore was brimming with confidence. She really did seem like she could do anything.<br>
I suppose self-confidence would also explain why she was teaching everyone her strange stretches just earlier.<br>
She only came to port a while ago, yet she had made friends with almost all the submarines here already.<br>

Chapter 3: Dorm Gaming Session<br>
Port - Dormitory<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Laffey：</span><br>
I'll wale on it...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Albacore：</span><br>
No, Laffey! It's enraged!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Laffey：</span><br>
... Huh?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Long Island：</span><br>
Bah, carted again! I'm getting tired of this stupid monster!<br>
<br>
Albacore was in the Dormitory, sitting around a console with a few others. Apparently, they were playing a video game.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Benson：</span><br>
You can't dodge those swipes! It's so unfair!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Long Island：</span><br>
I guess we've met our match if we can't beat it even with my next-level skills... gg, Monster Puncher!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Albacore：</span><br>
......<br>
It's not over yet.<br>
I think I've figured out most of its moveset! If we stick together and work as a team, we can beat it!<br>
Let's give it another try! I'll give orders, so everyone just do what I say!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Long Island：</span><br>
Hey, yeah! With Albacore giving orders, we might stand a chance! She's got that charismatic leader thing going on!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Laffey：</span><br>
Yeah...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Benson：</span><br>
She SOUNDS confident, that's for sure...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Albacore：</span><br>
All right, let's do this. Begin quest!<br>
<br>
30 minutes later...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Albacore：</span><br>
It's down and nearly dead! Everyone, wale on it with all you've got!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Everyone：</span><br>
Okay! HYAAAAAH!!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Laffey：</span><br>
We defeated it... finally...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Benson：</span><br>
YEEEEEEESSSS!! WE FRICKING DID IT!!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Long Island：</span><br>
We beat it... And we didn't even have to look up how to cheese it!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Albacore：</span><br>
Hahah, it was easy peasy! No boss stands a chance to Hardcore Albacore!<br>
<br>
Albacore seemed to be having a lot of fun.<br>
It was good to know that she's on friendly terms with everyone... but my search for a weakness to exploit was going nowhere!<br>

Chapter 4: A Deal With The Devil<br>
Port - Office<br>
I had been observing Albacore for a few days and learned that she hadn't been pranking anyone. On the contrary: she had made friends with everyone she'd met.<br>
At least it was relieving to know that this wasn't an HR problem.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Albacore：</span><br>
Commander!<br>
Hey, umm, I was wondering something! Can I ask you a question?<br>
<br>
She spoke to me in a strange, childish tone.<br>
I have a bad feeling about this. What is this cheeky little prankster planning?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Albacore：</span><br>
Well, what I was wondering is... have you been stalking me lately, Commander?<br>
<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项1：Admit that you have</span>'''''<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项2：Deny everything</span>'''''<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Albacore：</span><br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项1）</span>'''''Well, well, I thought as much!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Albacore：</span><br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项2）</span>'''''C'mon, Commander~ I know a liar when I hear one!<br>
<br>
Though I tried to deny it, Albacore knew that I had been spying on her.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Albacore：</span><br>
Gee~ Imagine if I were to tell everyone about this~<br>
"Hmph! I knew the Commander was a pervert all along!" – "H-how could a student of mine turn out this way?! Why would the Commander go after someone so y-young..." – "Oh, Commander, you leave me no choice but to cut you up into tiny little pieces..."<br>
<br>
Albacore was mimicking the voices of some of her friends.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Albacore：</span><br>
Well, Commander? Aren't you going to say the magic words?<br>
<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项1：Apologize to Albacore</span>'''''<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Albacore：</span><br>
I see, I see... So, stalking stuff aside, you were just worried about HR, eh?<br>
All right, let's make a deal: you do me two favors, and I'll forget this ever happened!<br>
For the first favor... I'm feeling kinda tired, and I wanna sleep on your lap for the whole afternoon. That should charge my batteries back to full!<br>
The second favor I'll save for later! Once I come up with something, I'll let you know! Hehehe~<br>
... Hm? You've got work this evening? Well, that's... too bad for you, then! I'm getting my beauty sleep!<br>
<br>
Once it was all said and done and I'd finished my work, my legs had gone numb and I couldn't move for some time...<br>

Chapter 5: Sea for Two Pt. 1<br>
Port - Beach<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Albacore：</span><br>
Hey, I've got an idea for the second favor!<br>
I'm gonna go to the beach tomorrow, and I thought it'd be nice if you'd play with me then!<br>
<br>
Although I had little say in the matter, Albacore and I went to the beach in the afternoon.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Albacore：</span><br>
Guess we have the beach all to ourselves! Hehehe~ So, what "stimulating" activity should we do first, Com-man-der♡<br>
<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项1：Suggest going for a swim</span>'''''<br>
Really? Just a dip in the ocean? Not what I had in mind, but okay.<br>
<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项1：Suggest making it a race to that uninhabited island</span>'''''<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Albacore：</span><br>
That's better!<br>
I'm putting my spotless record on the line for this! You're on, Commander!<br>
"Say a snazzy line before a race" – scratch that one from the bucket list!<br>
<br>
Splasssh!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Albacore：</span><br>
"Secure a flashy head start" – scratch that one as well! See ya at the finish line!<br>
<br>
Without waiting for my response, Albacore jumped straight into the ocean and swam off.<br>
<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项1：Chase after her</span>'''''<br>
<br>
Believe it or not, but I managed to swim all the way to the island. However, I couldn't find any traces of Albacore.<br>
Which means I win. Haha! Who's the sucker now?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Albacore：</span><br>
Surpriiiiiiiise!<br>
Ahahahah! Scared you, didn't I?<br>
Well, you tried, but I got here way ahead of you. I win!<br>
... The first lap, anyway. It's time for the second! Go!<br>
<br>
Albacore dove into the water and swam off again.<br>
I can't let her beat me twice! This time, I need to win...!<br>

Chapter 6: Sea for Two Pt. 2<br>
Before we knew it, the sun had begun to set and the skies had turned an orangish-red.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Albacore：</span><br>
Final score's 10 to me, 0 to you~ You'd need a lifetime of training or blind luck to beat me~<br>
Gotta say though, I'm dead tired now... *Pant*...<br>
<br>
I was resting in the soft sand where the beach and the water meet. Albacore did the same and sat down next to me.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Albacore：</span><br>
Boy, it's been long since I exerted myself this much.<br>
When was the last time, even?<br>
... Can't remember. Whatever.<br>
......<br>
You know, Commander, I had a ton of fun today! Consider the second favor all done!<br>
<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项1："I had fun, too."</span>'''''<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Albacore：</span><br>
You did...?<br>
H-haha, hahaha! I-I mean, obviously! Everyone has fun when I'm around!<br>
......<br>
Hah, what did I just say? I mean really, that was dumb.<br>
I blame it on you blurting that out of nowhere, Commander! You made the mood turn weird!<br>
<br>
Albacore suddenly stood up and went into the sea, then she started splashing seawater at me.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Albacore：</span><br>
Take THAT! And THIS!<br>
Ahaha! Now, THIS is what I call making waves!<br>
<br>
Albacore and I stuck around until sunset, playing by the beach.<br>

Good Night! Good Morning!<br>
Port - Private Quarters<br>
Tired after having spent half the day at the beach, I swiftly went to bed once I'd returned to the port.<br>
......<br>
My rest was disturbed by somebody poking my face.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">？？？：</span><br>
(Whispering) Commander, are you asleep?<br>
<br>
That voice... It must be Albacore.<br>
<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项1：Pretend to be asleep</span>'''''<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Albacore：</span><br>
Are you really? Or are you just faking your z's?<br>
... Welp, guess you really are asleep. Makes sense, given today.<br>
......<br>
Listen... there's a lot I want to say.<br>
First of all: thank you. I know I basically forced you into doing those favors for me, but still. And hearing you say you had a lot of fun made me really, really happy.<br>
I'm also grateful to be part of this fleet. Everyone's so nice and easy to make friends with. We practice together, chat, play games... Every day is just so much fun.<br>
One day, maybe... just maybe, I'll be diving and firing my torpedoes not to sink an enemy into the abyss, but to startle my friends for a laugh...<br>
I believe that day will come. Maybe not today, maybe not tomorrow, but someday it will.<br>
... What I'm trying to say is: I love my friends and all the memories I've made here.<br>
And, although I tease and mess with you all the time, the truth is...<br>
<br>
Albacore leaned in closer to whisper into my ear.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Albacore：</span><br>
... I love you.<br>
Also, I might have a surprise for you tomorrow♪ Here I am, going through the effort of telling you these nice things, and you just pretend to be asleep. So I'm gonna have a little payback, hehehe♪<br>
<br>
The next day...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Javelin：</span><br>
I-is it true, Commander?! Did you really spend the night sleeping in the same room as Albacore?!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ayanami：</span><br>
What does "sleeping in the same room" mean exactly, Commander?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Z23：</span><br>
Commander, I can tolerate many things, but even I draw a line somewhere!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Laffey：</span><br>
The Commander might be into little girls...<br>
<br>
Albacore sure knows how to twist a story...<br>
In the end, I had to spend half the day clearing up this misunderstanding.<br>
It was stressful, but it was fun, too. I'm sure I have many days like this ahead of me with Albacore by my side.<br>
