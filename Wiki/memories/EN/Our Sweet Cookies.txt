1 Just the Two of Us<br>
Port - Shopping District<br>
I arrive at the shopping district at the agreed-upon time and find Howe, standing outside the supermarket.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Howe ：</span><br>
Lovely that you could come, Commander.<br>
<br>
The gorgeous lady greets me with a bright smile.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
I wanted to arrive sooner, but you beat me to the punch. Have you been waiting for long?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Howe ：</span><br>
No, not long at all. I just happened to come a little early.<br>
The thought of spending the entire day with you made me so giddy I could hardly sleep.<br>
So I woke up early, got dressed and prettied up, then when I arrived I realised there was quite a while to go until you'd be here.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
You wouldn't have had to wait if I'd just gotten here sooner.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Howe ：</span><br>
Well, if it bothers you so, you could make up for it in a minute when we go shopping.<br>
<br>
She gives me a soft smile, then casually takes my hand.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Howe ：</span><br>
The entrance is over there. Let's go.<br>
<br>
Over the course of our pleasant shopping trip, the shopping basket has gotten very heavy.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Howe ：</span><br>
Butter, powdered sugar, pastry flour... That should be all, I think.<br>
<br>
She rummages through the basket while looking around for the next item on the list.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Howe ：</span><br>
Let's see...<br>
There it is! The cookie cutter section.<br>
<br>
I follow her into the section. A wide range of cookie cutters in all shapes and sizes jump out at me.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Howe ：</span><br>
Aww, these anchor-shaped ones are so cute...<br>
These cat ones are lovely as well...<br>
Wow! They even have ones shaped like naval caps.<br>
Which do you think would be the best, Commander?<br>
<br>
She presents the three different kinds of cutters to me.<br>
<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项1：Which do YOU like?</span>'''''<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项2：They're all good.</span>'''''<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Howe ：</span><br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项1）</span>'''''Hmm... If you ask me...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Howe ：</span><br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项2）</span>'''''But I can't get them all! If you can't decide, let me pick one.<br>
<br>
Examining the options in her hands, she ponders her choice earnestly.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Howe ：</span><br>
This one. It suits you the best!<br>
<br>
She puts the naval cap cookie cutter into the basket, then looks around for more cutters to buy.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Howe ：</span><br>
This bat-shaped one fits York, while this teacup one will be for Wales...<br>
And George will get... this one.<br>
Alright, that should be enough. I might use these the next time I'm baking cookies for everyone.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
("Next time"?)<br>
You mean you're not making any today?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Howe ：</span><br>
No, only that I'm making cookies for you today.<br>
This is our special day together, so it's obviously going to be about us.<br>
If we're going to make cookies together, they should be just for us, don't you think?<br>
<br>
Before I can get a word in, she starts walking onward.<br>
A few steps down the aisle, she looks back and shoots me a faintly shy wink.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Howe ：</span><br>
Come along. Let's go to the checkout.<br>

<br>
2 Free Hands Hold Together<br>
Howe and I leave the supermarket after paying for our items, carrying hefty bags filled to the brim.<br>
As we walk side by side, the distance between us shrinks step by step.<br>
Then, she looks at the bags in my hands before moving her gaze to meet my eyes.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
What is it?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Howe ：</span><br>
I could store your bags inside my rigging, if you want.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Using your rigging costs oil, so that's pretty unwise from an economic standpoint, no?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Howe ：</span><br>
That is true... Let me carry them, then.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
They don't weigh a ton or anything. I can handle it.<br>
<br>
She shakes her head and reaches out, gripping the handle of my bag.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Howe ：</span><br>
Silly. How am I supposed to hold your hand if it's busy carrying a bag?<br>
Just leave it to me.<br>
<br>
Her eyes shine, full of anticipation and eagerness.<br>
<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项1：(Give the bag to her.)</span>'''''<br>
<br>
I let go of the handle, letting her take the bag. She then transfers it to her other hand.<br>
Next, she takes her free hand and grasps mine. It feels warm and soft to the touch.<br>
Although her cheeks are flushed, her gaze is right on me. She squeezes my hand tightly.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Howe ：</span><br>
I've wanted to do this for so long.<br>
Walking with you, holding hands, talking about things.<br>
Just like that, until...<br>
Never mind.<br>
<br>
All of a sudden, she hangs her head in thought.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Until what?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Howe ：</span><br>
Until the end of the universe? The end of time?<br>
Forget I said it. It's too cheesy for me.<br>
What I'm trying to say is, I want to hold your hand for as long as possible.<br>
<br>
With a slightly awkward smile, she dodges out of saying anything more.<br>
We walk forward, hands bobbing up and down, while the golden evening sun shines warmly on us.<br>

3 Don't Forget the Apron<br>
Howe's Quarters - Kitchen<br>
I place the ingredients on the counter, and just as I'm about to start on the next step, Howe stops me all of a sudden.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Howe ：</span><br>
Before you do that, take a seat. Let's get comfortable first.<br>
I'll get you some iced tea♪<br>
<br>
She brings the iced tea over, but does not sit down at the counter. Instead, she starts processing the ingredients.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Huh? Aren't you going to sit down?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Howe ：</span><br>
No, I'm not feeling very tired. If anything, I'm restless and raring to do something.<br>
You just sit there and relax while I work on this.<br>
<br>
After checking that she has all the ingredients and tools ready, she takes out two aprons.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Howe ：</span><br>
Here. Put this on.<br>
We don't want you to get butter or flour on your clothes, do we?<br>
<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项1：(Put on the apron.)</span>'''''<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项2：(Ask her to do it for you.)</span>'''''<br>
<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项1）</span>'''''Taking the apron, I hang it around my neck and fiddle around the back to tie a knot.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Howe ：</span><br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项1）</span>'''''Let me help. It's pretty tricky to do when you can't see.<br>
<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项1）</span>'''''She steps forward, getting behind me and using her hands to skillfully tie a knot.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项2）</span>'''''I can't see behind me, so... give me a hand?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Howe ：</span><br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项2）</span>'''''Hm? Oh, sure.<br>
<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项2）</span>'''''She first walks up and tiptoes to reach up and place the apron around my neck.<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项2）</span>'''''Then she wraps her hands behind my back and skillfully ties a knot.<br>
<br>
All while practically hugging me with how close she is.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Howe ：</span><br>
What's the matter? Is it too tight?<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
No, it's perfect. Thanks.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Howe ：</span><br>
Lovely! I was wondering if I went too hard with it.<br>
<br>
While she says that, she takes the other apron and gets ready to put her head through it.<br>
<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项1：(Offer to help her.)</span>'''''<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项1）</span>'''''Let me give you a hand this time.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Howe ：</span><br>
Huh? Oh, by all means.<br>
<br>
Before anything else, I hold up her hair so it won't get caught on anything.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Howe ：</span><br>
......<br>
<br>
A blush briefly turns her ears pink before going away.<br>
Once I finish tying her apron, I back off. She places her hands on her fair cheeks.<br>
She smiles a charming and sweet yet slightly embarrassed smile.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Howe ：</span><br>
Whew... Standing so close to you really gets my heart beating.<br>
As much as I'd love to just do that all day... there are still things to do before that.<br>
<br>
As she says that, she hands me a bowl and a stick of butter.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Howe ：</span><br>
Come on, love. It's time to make cookies!<br>

<br>
4 Mistakes Into Smiles<br>
Howe and I start working on the cookie dough.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Howe ：</span><br>
Once you've thoroughly mixed the sugar, butter, and egg mix, add some pastry flour and keep stirring until uniform in consistency.<br>
<br>
As she instructs, I add the flour to the bowl and give it a good stir.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Howe ：</span><br>
Oh, by the way, do you know the trick for making cookie dough?<br>
<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项1：If it's too watery, add more flour!</span>'''''<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项2：If it's too floury, add more water!</span>'''''<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Howe ：</span><br>
Well, yes, that's true...<br>
But the actual trick is this – don't stir the dough too hard. If it gets too glutenous, the cookies won't be crispy.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Oh, I see.<br>
<br>
Keeping her advice in mind, I try to stir with just enough force so I don't mess up my very first batch. She smiles and examines my face.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Howe ：</span><br>
Heehee. You've got flour on your face.<br>
Hold still. I'll take care of it.<br>
<br>
She presses her soft finger on my face and rubs it, spreading on more flour.<br>
Yes, spreading the flour, not wiping it off.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Howe ：</span><br>
Oh! Sorry, love.<br>
I didn't realise I had flour on my hands... I only made it worse.<br>
Although, you do look a little cute with flour on your face. Heehee.<br>
<br>
She apologizes for the little oopsie, but still can't suppress a snicker even with her hand to her mouth.<br>
As a result, she leaves a handprint of flour across her mouth and cheeks. It looks almost like she has a cat's whiskers.<br>
<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项1：(Tease her.)</span>'''''<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项2：(Point it out.)</span>'''''<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项1）</span>'''''Do I, now? It looks twice as cute on you.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Howe ：</span><br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项1）</span>'''''"It"? What do you mean?<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项1）</span>'''''You got flour on your face just now when you covered your mouth.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项2）</span>'''''Hey, you got flour on your face when you put your hand on there.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Howe ：</span><br>
D-did I?<br>
<br>
She is stumped for just a moment, then she breaks into a big smile.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Howe ：</span><br>
Well, then we have matching makeup, love!<br>

<br>
5 Time to Rest<br>
After we both wipe the flour off our faces, we resume our cookie-making.<br>
Howe sticks the tray filled with dollops of dough inside the oven, then comes to me and leads me by the hand to sit down.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Howe ：</span><br>
This will take about 20 minutes, so in the meantime...<br>
Can I give you an arm massage?<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Why an arm massage?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Howe ：</span><br>
Because you stirred for a long time, didn't you? Even if you feel fine now, your arms might start hurting tomorrow.<br>
My arms are used to making cookies by now, but yours aren't.<br>
So come on, allow me to massage your arms until the cookies are done.<br>
<br>
The direct look in her eyes signals that there is no room to argue.<br>
<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项1：(Extend your arms.)</span>'''''<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Alright. Go ahead.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Howe ：</span><br>
Great! Here we go.<br>
<br>
I extend my arms for her. She rolls my sleeves back up to my upper arms.<br>
Her warm and supple fingers then touch my skin. Using neither too much nor too little strength, she starts massaging me.<br>
Beneath her long eyelashes are intent eyes that glitter.<br>
All that stirring did make my muscles a little stiff, and this massage really is helping them loosen up.<br>
The room is silent, save for the sound of our beating hearts...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Howe ：</span><br>
There. That should be good.<br>
<br>
She finishes the massage, then courteously straightens out my sleeves.<br>
DING!<br>
Conveniently, at the same time, the oven makes a noise to signal that the cookies are done.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Howe ：</span><br>
Perfect timing. Let's see how the cookies turned out.<br>

<br>
6 Burning Hot<br>
We open the oven, and a sugary aroma instantly fills the room.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Howe ：</span><br>
Mmm! That smells so good! These came out lovely.<br>
Let me put on my mittens and get the tray–<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
No need. You've been doing all the heavy lifting, so I'll handle this.<br>
<br>
Putting on the mittens, I reach into the oven and grab the tray.<br>
However, the tray is far hotter than I anticipated, and the heat seeps right through the mittens.<br>
Frantically, I put the tray down somewhere. Howe then pulls off my mittens and checks my hands for burns.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Howe ：</span><br>
Are you okay?!<br>
<br>
The parts that touched the tray have turned a little red.<br>
Grave look in her eyes, she hurries me over to the sink and runs water over my hands.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Howe ：</span><br>
Stay here and keep them cool. I'll bring some ointment in just a sec!<br>
<br>
She takes this very seriously, like she was treating a serious wound. It's cute.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
I'm fine. They just went a little red. Letting them cool under the water is enough.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Howe ：</span><br>
Really?<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Yeah. If it makes you really anxious, you can check on them whenever you want.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Howe ：</span><br>
If you're sure. *sigh*...<br>
<br>
She breathes a small sigh, then examines the mittens with great scrutiny.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Howe ：</span><br>
Oh... Sorry, love.<br>
I think they've lost their insulative effect after all the baking I've done with them.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Don't apologize. It's not your fault.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Howe ：</span><br>
You're right. The mittens are to blame for not being cool at all.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Uh... "Cool"?<br>
<br>
She affirms with a nod.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Howe ：</span><br>
Yes. Mittens don't warm up when exposed to heat, which makes them pretty cool.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
(I don't get it. Is she cracking a joke?)<br>
So... pun intended?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Howe ：</span><br>
What? You thought I was making a pun?<br>
<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项1：Well, yes.</span>'''''<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项2：Want me to laugh?</span>'''''<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Howe ：</span><br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项2）</span>'''''Actually, yes... I was hoping you would.<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项2）</span>'''''I thought about that one quite a bit...<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Well, yes.<br>
<br>
Although it was impossible to tell if she was joking, I appreciate the sentiment.<br>
She was worried about me and just wanted to make me smile.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
I get it, but you really don't need to worry. I'm fine.<br>
Now, what do you say to some tea?<br>
<br>
I dry my hands then give her a pat on the head to reassure her.<br>
It seems to do the trick, and her usual warm smile graces her face again.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Howe ：</span><br>
Sure!<br>

7 Our Sweet Cookies<br>
We load the kitchen trolley with cookies, tea, and napkins, and bring it out into the yard.<br>
Having secured a table and chairs, Howe tells me to take it easy, even if I strictly speaking didn't get burned.<br>
While I do that, she sets the table for us both.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Howe ：</span><br>
Alright, that should do. Now, love, it's finally time for Royal Navy-style afternoon tea!<br>
<br>
She shows me to my seat. I sit down, as does she.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
So, which do we start with?<br>
<br>
There are two kinds of cookies in the box sitting on the table.<br>
The first, regular cookies. The second, the naval cap-shaped ones I made with her guidance – with dried fruit inside.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Howe ：</span><br>
That's obvious! With your first-ever batch!<br>
<br>
She picks up a cookie and takes a bite out of it.<br>
Almost immediately, her eyes light up with joy like a pair of sapphires.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Howe ：</span><br>
It's so good! Have a bite!<br>
<br>
Reaching across the table, she brings the cookie up to my mouth.<br>
<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项1：(Take a bite.)</span>'''''<br>
<br>
I chomp a piece out of the cookie.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
(Sure, it's pretty good for a first attempt... but it's not really eye-openingly good, is it?)<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Howe ：</span><br>
You don't think I was overreacting, do you?<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Well, if you weren't, let's hear your objective analysis.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Howe ：</span><br>
I mean... It's very delicious. I really think that.<br>
I only just taught you how to make cookies, and you've already made one that tastes better than any I've ever had before.<br>
It's probably because YOU made it. That must be why it tastes so good.<br>
<br>
So bright is her smile that it's almost like looking at the sun.<br>
With those first bites, our wonderful tea party begins. Aromatic tea fills our cups while our plates are lined with crisp cookies.<br>
Later, after we've eaten the cookies...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Howe ：</span><br>
Would you like a refill?<br>
<br>
She looks at me and waits for an answer.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Howe ：</span><br>
Oh, you have cookie crumbs on your face, love.<br>
Gosh, what a messy eater you are.<br>
<br>
Despite ostensibly sounding rude, she still has that same gentle smile on her lips.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Where?<br>
<br>
Confused, I wipe my face using the palm of my hand.<br>
However, there are no crumbs on my face. The only thing on anyone's face is the teasing smirk on hers, growing wider.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Howe ：</span><br>
They're still there. You know what? Let me do it for you.<br>
See? Your hands are clean. Proof that you didn't get the crumbs.<br>
<br>
Saying that, she leans in.<br>
She graces my cheek using her delicate fingers.<br>
Our gazes meet. I feel her warmth, and she feels mine. The space between us is ever shrinking.<br>
Until finally, her tender lips kiss mine.<br>
She pulls away after a moment and looks right at me.<br>
In her eyes, I see so many things – kindness, shyness, incredible happiness, and an immovable will.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Howe ：</span><br>
This may be rather sudden, but...<br>
Making these cookies with you, spending some quiet time together... It makes me happy like you wouldn't believe.<br>
And... I hope we'll be together like this more from now on.<br>
