Chapter 1 - Fateful Encounter<br>
One day at the Academy...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">I-56：</span><br>
School is... pretty nice.<br>
I can quietly stay in this corner and mind my own business...<br>
Also... I can see a completely different side of people, hehe...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">？？？：</span><br>
... Say your prayers!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">I-56：</span><br>
Huh? That's...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Hammann：</span><br>
Say your prayers! Today is the day that I finally teach you a lesson, Iroha!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">I-168：</span><br>
Let's see you try, heh! But when I'm through with you, you'd better not run away crying and tattle to Yorktown!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Hammann：</span><br>
Hmph! I will defeat you myself!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">I-168：</span><br>
Ahaha, keep your boasting to your dreams! See that tree over there? Whoever tags it first wins, got it?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Hammann：</span><br>
Hmph! Let's do it then!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">I-168：</span><br>
Ready, get set–<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Yorktown：</span><br>
Hammann, Iroha, what are you two doing?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Hammann：</span><br>
Eek! Big sister Yorktown! Why are you here?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Yorktown：</span><br>
Today's missions ended early, so I just wanted to swing by to check on you.<br>
Hehe, I see you're energetic as ever, Iroha.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">I-168：</span><br>
H-h-h-h-hello there!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Yorktown：</span><br>
Hehe... There's no need to be nervous. We're all friends now~<br>
Hammann hasn't been causing you any trouble, has she?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Hammann：</span><br>
(shifts eyes)<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">I-168：</span><br>
N-not at all! As a matter of fact, we're g-good friends!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Yorktown：</span><br>
Aww, you two are friends now? I'm overjoyed to hear that~<br>
However, Hammann has a bit of an attitude, so you'll have to forgive her for that...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Hammann：</span><br>
Who has an attitude?!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">I-168：</span><br>
O-okay...!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Yorktown：</span><br>
Hehe. I should get going now, since I wouldn't want to get in the way of your playtime.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Hammann：</span><br>
Ah, um... see you later, Yorktown!<br>
... We'll settle this next time.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">I-168：</span><br>
H-heh! All right, I suppose I'll let you off the hook today!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">I-56：</span><br>
Formerly enemies, now allies. Claim to be rivals, but are actually close friends... Haah...<br>
Isn't it so... poetic?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">？？？：</span><br>
Huh? I-56, what are you doing there?<br>

Chapter 2 - Misunderstandings and Making Friends<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">I-56：</span><br>
Eek!!!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">I-25：</span><br>
Woah?! Am... I really that scary...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">I-56：</span><br>
Oh, it's just I-25...<br>
It's n-nothing... I j-just thought the grass here feels pretty cool...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">I-25：</span><br>
Oh... It's Iroha and Hammann. Going at it again, huh...<br>
Were you... spying on them?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">I-56：</span><br>
Um... Mhm...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">I-25：</span><br>
Aha, I knew it! So that's what's going on.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">I-56：</span><br>
Huh? What?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">I-25：</span><br>
Well, you always go on missions alone, and you're always by yourself at school.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">I-56：</span><br>
Well, that's because...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">I-25：</span><br>
There's nothing to be shy about~ You want to be friends with everyone else, don't you?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">I-56：</span><br>
Um, I don't particularly...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">I-25：</span><br>
Don't be shy! Hehe~ I'll be your first friend... how does that sound?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">I-56：</span><br>
Huh? Th-there's no need, I didn't...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">I-25：</span><br>
All right, that's decided! From now on, we're going to be best friends!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">I-56：</span><br>
Urkkk...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">I-25：</span><br>
Can I call you 56 from now on? Let's head back to do some training. How does that sound?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">I-56：</span><br>
*gasp* ... Boobs... Can't breathe...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">I-25：</span><br>
Ah, sorry... 26 keeps telling me that I scare people away. I didn't scare you, did I?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">I-56：</span><br>
N-not at all...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">？？？：</span><br>
Ehh? What are you two doing over there? Lemme get in on the fun!<br>
Cannonbaaall!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">I-56：</span><br>
Eeeek!<br>

Chapter 3 - A New Friend?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">I-25：</span><br>
Nnnh... who are you?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">U-522：</span><br>
Heheh~ Nice meetin' you, Sakura subs. I'm U-522, from the Iron Blood!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">I-25：</span><br>
I'm I-25, and she's...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">I-56：</span><br>
Urk... (you're...) uuuugh... (sitting on me!) I'm... I-56...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">U-522：</span><br>
Oops, sorry 'bout that~<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">I-56：</span><br>
*gasp* ... It's okay...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">U-522：</span><br>
What were you two doing just now?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">I-56：</span><br>
N-nothing in particular...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">U-522：</span><br>
Heheh. I'm actually currently looking for some excitement! Got any tips for me?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">I-25：</span><br>
Excitement? I don't think... I have anything for you. How about you, 56?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">I-56：</span><br>
Hmm... there should be plenty of exciting things at school... I think...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">U-522：</span><br>
Ohh~? Just what exactly is exciting about school?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">I-56：</span><br>
U-557 and I-58 often go up to the roof to space out... and Surcouf sometimes goes up there to nap...<br>
I-26 and U-81 often play hide and seek, and they'll also go training with Dace...<br>
U-73 and I-19 get along with everyone so well to the point of being uncanny, I-13 has an unhealthy love of planes...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">I-25：</span><br>
... I-56, I never knew that you cared so much about everyone. It's a travesty you don't have any friends...<br>
But your days of suffering are now over. I will make sure to be the best friend you can ask for!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">I-56：</span><br>
Um, I didn't say anything about...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">U-522：</span><br>
Ohoh... How about Albacore? I heard she's a fun playmate...<br>
That settles it! Next time there's class, I'll be on the lookout for her!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">？？？：</span><br>
Crap, crap, crap! I'm going to be late!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">I-56：</span><br>
Wh-who is it this time?!?<br>

Chapter 4 - Let's Go!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">U-522：</span><br>
Woah, U-101?! What's the big hurry?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">U-101：</span><br>
Oh, it's you, U-522. Are you hanging out with the Sakura subs?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">U-522：</span><br>
Sure am. We're looking for some excitement! Wanna come along?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">U-101：</span><br>
Oh! Um... I'm sorry, I'm in a rush, so maybe next time!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">I-25：</span><br>
You even brought Great Shark... Are you planning to head out to sea?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">U-101：</span><br>
You bet! A large school of rare fish is going to migrate through here, and I can't afford to miss it!<br>
I heard it's a breathtaking view, but if you miss out, you'll have to wait a whole 'nother year...<br>
So, who's in?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">U-522：</span><br>
Sounds like fun, so count me in!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">I-25：</span><br>
I-56, what do you want to do?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">I-56：</span><br>
I, um...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">I-25：</span><br>
What's the matter? We're all together right now, so...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">I-56：</span><br>
... ... ...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">I-25：</span><br>
Um, I'd like to go see it with you, after all, I-56...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">I-56：</span><br>
*gasp!*<br>
(Did I finally manage... to get through to her...?)<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">U-101：</span><br>
All right, we all in then? I'll take you all on Great Shark to get us there faster!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">U-522：</span><br>
All four of us can squeeze onto that thing?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">U-101：</span><br>
Heheh! Great Shark has been souped-up especially for times like these!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">I-25：</span><br>
I-56, make sure to hold on tight, okay?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">I-56：</span><br>
Um... huh?<br>
(Um, wait... Did I really agree to getting roped into this...?)<br>
(How did this end up happening...?!)<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">U-101：</span><br>
Let's go! Lass uns gehen!<br>
