The Nervous Black Cat<br>
Port - Office<br>
*Knock knock*<br>
That knocking must mean... the commission team is back now.<br>
<span style="color:#92fc63;">Hatsuharu：</span><br>
... U-umm...<br>
<br>
It seems like Hatsuharu was tasked with giving me the report this time.<br>
<span style="color:#92fc63;">Hatsuharu：</span><br>
A-a commission has been completed...<br>
......<br>
<br>
......<br>
The sound of complete silence enveloped the office.<br>
... The conversation won't go anywhere at this rate.<br>
<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项1：Say something to Hatsuharu</span>'''''<br>
<span style="color:#92fc63;">Hatsuharu：</span><br>
Wah?! *Whimper*...<br>
I-I-I'm so sorry, Commander!<br>
I practiced so hard, y-yet I still can't do it...<br>
I-I should've known this would be impossible for me!<br>
<br>
......<br>
Then, before I could say anything else, Hatsuharu hastily ran out of the office.<br>
I'll have someone else check on the commission team later.<br>
... But right now, Hatsuharu is on my mind.<br>

Advice From a Friend<br>
Port - Sakura Empire Dormitory<br>
<span style="color:#92fc63;">Hatsuharu：</span><br>
*Whimper*... I thought this would happen... I should've never accepted the task...<br>
I practiced it so much on my way to the office, but I just can't say the words in front of the Commander...<br>
<span style="color:#92fc63;">Hiyou：</span><br>
Yo, Hatsuharu!<br>
<span style="color:#92fc63;">Hatsuharu：</span><br>
*Eek*?! *Whimper*... H-hello, Hiyou...<br>
<span style="color:#92fc63;">Hiyou：</span><br>
Oh, did I spook you there? Sorry.<br>
I gave the report on your behalf, so don't fret over it. If you were so scared of giving the report, you should've just asked me to do it...<br>
<span style="color:#92fc63;">Hatsuharu：</span><br>
Um, t-thank you... I'm just...<br>
<span style="color:#92fc63;">Hiyou：</span><br>
... You're still anxious about it, aren't you?<br>
<span style="color:#92fc63;">Hatsuharu：</span><br>
Mhm... I wanted to try to get over my social anxiety...<br>
... B-but as soon as I stepped into the office, I forgot everything I had p-practiced on the way there...<br>
<span style="color:#92fc63;">Hiyou：</span><br>
I see... So that's how it is. Sounds to me like your problem is a lack of confidence.<br>
<span style="color:#92fc63;">Hatsuharu：</span><br>
(Hatsuharu nodded in agreement.)<br>
<span style="color:#92fc63;">Hiyou：</span><br>
Let's see, something to boost your confidence... Aha! I've got it!<br>
This should help!<br>
<span style="color:#92fc63;">Hatsuharu：</span><br>
... An... eyepatch...?<br>
<span style="color:#92fc63;">Hiyou：</span><br>
Uh-huh. If you hide your eye, people won't be able to sense the weakness within you. Put it on, give it a try. Oh yeah, you need an imposing sword as well. Wanna borrow mine?<br>
<span style="color:#92fc63;">Hatsuharu：</span><br>
T-thanks, but no thanks...<br>
<span style="color:#92fc63;">Hiyou：</span><br>
Don't say that. If you give up now, you'll never get over your social anxiety.<br>
... Maybe we need to take more drastic measures. Hatsuharu, let's head out, right now! You have the power within you to conquer the high seas, the Commander, and even your social anxiety!<br>
<span style="color:#92fc63;">Hatsuharu：</span><br>
*Whimper*... I don't think I...<br>
<span style="color:#92fc63;">Hatsushimo：</span><br>
Hey, Hatsuharu~ So, I was thinking we could go on a patrol together later.<br>
<span style="color:#92fc63;">Wakaba：</span><br>
Whoa, Hatsuharu! You look pretty cool!<br>
<span style="color:#92fc63;">Hatsuharu：</span><br>
*Whimper*... I-I can't do thiiiiis!<br>
<br>
And so, Hiyou's plans of conquering the high seas never left the drawing board.<br>

You Can Do It, Hatsuharu!<br>
A while later, in the Sakura Empire Dormitory<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Hatsushimo：</span><br>
Who does Hiyou think she is, trying to involve you in some weird scheme... If we hadn't shown up, I bet she would've turned you into a pirate or something.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Hatsuharu：</span><br>
*Whimper*... I-I just wanted to be more confident so I could help people more... I'm sure she just misunderstood what I wanted...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Hatsushimo：</span><br>
You wanna be confident, huh... You can hardly hold a conversation with anyone but us, isn't that right?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Hatsuharu：</span><br>
*Sob*...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Wakaba：</span><br>
It's okay, Hatsuharu! Social anxiety and self-esteem issues can be overcome, you just have to keep at it!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Hatsuharu：</span><br>
W-Wakaba?! W-when did you get here...?!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Wakaba：</span><br>
Just now! I only overheard a portion of what you guys were talking about.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Hatsuharu：</span><br>
Well, th... thank you... I'll keep trying...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Wakaba：</span><br>
Oh, look at that pretty butterfly! I'm gonna go catch it!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Hatsuharu：</span><br>
Don't run or else you'll trip, Wakaba!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Wakaba：</span><br>
I caught it! I caught... Whoaaahh?!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Hatsuharu：</span><br>
Wakaba! A-are you okay?!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Wakaba：</span><br>
*Giggle*~ I'm okay! I might have tripped, but I tripped with style! Oh yeah, anyway...<br>
How come you can talk to us just fine, but you struggle so much when talking to other people?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Hatsushimo：</span><br>
Isn't it because she knows us, so she doesn't feel anxious around us?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Hatsuharu：</span><br>
A-actually, yeah... that sounds about right...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Hatsushimo：</span><br>
If that's all, shouldn't you try just talking a lot to other people until you feel as comfortable around them as you do with us?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Hatsuharu：</span><br>
T-that's true, it's all about feeling comfortable... But... I don't get many opportunities to talk to the Commander...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Hatsushimo：</span><br>
Request to become the Commander's secretary. If you become the secretary, you'll get to talk to each other every day, even if you hate it. The position is open, so go for it.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Hatsuharu：</span><br>
B-become the Commander's secretary?! That's impossible, I can't...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Hiyou：</span><br>
Don't say that. If you give up now, you'll never get over your social anxiety.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Hatsuharu：</span><br>
... N-no, I have to try!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">{namecode:141}&{namecode:129}：</span><br>
You can do it, Hatsuharu!<br>

Hatsuharu, The Secretary!<br>
Port - Office<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Hatsuharu：</span><br>
P-p-please, let me be your secretary!<br>
<br>
... I didn't expect to see this today.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Hatsuharu：</span><br>
I-I'm, umm, socially anxious, but... I-I'll try my best to be a g-good secretary!<br>
I-I want to be someone that people can rely on!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Wakaba：</span><br>
Don't be so surprised, Commander~ *Phew*, it's a good thing I came along... You see, Commander...<br>
<br>
Wakaba explained the situation.<br>
Now I understand. Hatsuharu wants to cure her social anxiety.<br>
<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项1：Respond to Hatsuharu's request</span>'''''<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Hatsuharu：</span><br>
Is... i-is that... g-good?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Wakaba：</span><br>
You did it! Now just give it all you've got, Hatsuharu! I'll leave now so I won't get in your way! See ya!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Hatsuharu：</span><br>
Uh, um, okay! I-I promise to give it my all!<br>
<br>
It's good to see that she's enthusiastic, but it remains to be seen how far that will get her.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Wichita：</span><br>
You there, Sakura Empire girl, could you tell me what the schedule is for tomorrow's exercises?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Hatsuharu：</span><br>
*Eek*?! W-what did you ask?! I-I'm not...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Wichita：</span><br>
Whoa there, what's with the apology? I'm not trying to steal your lunch money, little girl.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">York：</span><br>
Has the †Area† for the †Exercises† of the morrow been prepared yet?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Hatsuharu：</span><br>
P... pardon me?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">York：</span><br>
So you do not comprehend me... Clear as day it is to me: you are no wielder of the †Force†...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Hatsuharu：</span><br>
*Whimper*... I'm sorry that I can't help!<br>
<br>
This doesn't appear to be going very well...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Hatsuharu：</span><br>
I-I'm sorry! I-I'm just... no good at t-talking to people...<br>
<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项1：Comfort Hatsuharu</span>'''''<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Hatsuharu：</span><br>
*Sob*... T-thank you...<br>
... You'll be my conversation partner?! You'll help me practice so I can get better at it?!<br>
... A-are you sure you don't mind?! Thank you so much!<br>
<br>
I doubt Hatsuharu realizes she just managed to converse really well.<br>
Now the question is: where do we start...<br>

<br>
Fruitless Efforts?<br>
One day at the Practice Area<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Fubuki：</span><br>
I saw you nab that MVP like nobody's business, Ayanami! That's my sister!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ayanami：</span><br>
I would say you did fairly well too.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Fubuki：</span><br>
Hey, you don't have to be so modest~ And Hatsuharu, you did great too~ Good luck with your secretary work! See ya~<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Hatsuharu：</span><br>
T-thank you! Y-you did great too! See you!<br>
... I really didn't do all that great...<br>
(I can give it my all in a real battle, but when I'm training with Fubuki and the rest, I can't maneuver as well as they do...)<br>
(Practicing with the Commander has really improved my sociability, and I've slowly gotten better at doing secretary work, yet I still can't do well in combat with people I don't know...)<br>
(This really is just impossible for me...)<br>
Maybe all my hard work has been in vain... If so, I probably don't need to force myself to be the Commander's secretary anymore...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Hiyou：</span><br>
Yo, Hatsuharu!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Hatsuharu：</span><br>
*Eek*?! ... It's you, Hiyou? Please stop s-scaring me like that!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Hiyou：</span><br>
Oh, sorry... I saw you standing over here, alone, and I was just wondering: did something bad happen?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Hatsuharu：</span><br>
N-no, nothing at all! I'm just a little t-tired...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Hiyou：</span><br>
Something's obviously happened. It's written all over your face.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Hatsuharu：</span><br>
W-what?! N-no, I'm just...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Hiyou：</span><br>
*Sigh*... I wasn't trying to eavesdrop, but I overheard your little monologue. Are you really gonna resign from being the secretary?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Hatsuharu：</span><br>
W-well...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Hiyou：</span><br>
Listen. Confidence isn't about being able to have a smooth conversation, it's about having the courage to face and overcome your own shortcomings.<br>
You don't want all your efforts up to this point to have been for nothing, do you?<br>
If you give up now, you'll never muster the courage to try again.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Hatsuharu：</span><br>
B-but I...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Hatsushimo：</span><br>
She's right, you know. You won't solve your problems by running away from them.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Wakaba：</span><br>
Don't give up, Hatsuharu! I'll support you the whole way!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Hatsuharu：</span><br>
Hatsushimo... Wakaba... Why are you here...?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Hatsushimo：</span><br>
Because a certain someone was worried about you and went looking for you. Isn't that right, Commander?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Hatsuharu：</span><br>
C-Commander?!<br>

Hatsuharu's Determination<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Hatsuharu：</span><br>
C-Commander, why are you here...?<br>
<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项1：Because I was worried about you, just like Hatsushimo said.</span>'''''<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Hatsuharu：</span><br>
*Whimper*... Thank you for caring so much about me, Commander...<br>
But that doesn't change the fact... that I'm subpar, both as a secretary and as a soldier... All I do is get in people's ways...<br>
I can't even overcome my social anxiety...<br>
<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项1：Cheer up Hatsuharu</span>'''''<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Hatsuharu：</span><br>
... I've... changed...<br>
... Since the first time we talked...?<br>
I went to report the results of a commission, but once I stood in front of you I forgot everything I was going to say and ran away...<br>
Then I became your secretary, you helped me become better at talking, and I somehow managed to hold a conversation with strangers...<br>
And now I can actually talk to you, and... W-wait... I'm actually able to... hold a conversation with you...?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Hatsushimo：</span><br>
So you finally realized it. You've always been slow to catch on~<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Hatsuharu：</span><br>
The Commander helped me so much... I don't understand how I didn't realize it sooner...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Wakaba：</span><br>
Well, that's just like you, Hatsuharu!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Hatsuharu：</span><br>
*Sob*... The Commander was always cheering me up... And somehow I didn't even realize it...<br>
I... I'm...<br>
<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项1：Tell Hatsuharu what you plan to talk about tomorrow</span>'''''<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Hatsuharu：</span><br>
O-okay! That sounds good!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Hiyou：</span><br>
Hah, looks like my work here is done.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Hatsuharu：</span><br>
Thank you so much... Hiyou, Hatsushimo, Wakaba, and you too, Commander... I'll keep at it! One day I'll be anxiety-free!<br>
<br>
Hatsuharu's eyes were twinkling with determination.<br>

A while later...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Long Island：</span><br>
Aww, you mean you can't do it?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Hatsuharu：</span><br>
I-I'm fairly sure, yes! Those funds are necessary to expand the fleet...!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Long Island：</span><br>
So my plan to buy new games in the name of cultural research has failed?!<br>
Dang... So be it... Thanks for your time, Hatsuharu...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Hatsuharu：</span><br>
*Pant*... *pant*... I'm sorry, Long Island...!<br>
<br>
So she wanted to use our funds to buy games, huh... Nice try...<br>
Long Island's schemes aside... Slowly but surely, Hatsuharu has been getting better at conversing with people.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Hatsuharu：</span><br>
Next, we have to work out the practice schedule... and plan for the research tasks...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Wakaba：</span><br>
Hey, Hatsuharu!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Hatsuharu：</span><br>
Wakaba?! C-could you not hug me from behind out of nowhere?!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Wakaba：</span><br>
But I wanted to see you!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Hatsuharu：</span><br>
Didn't you see me just yesterday...<br>
<br>
It's always great to see sister ships getting along this well.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Wakaba：</span><br>
Oh yeah, I was wondering something! When are you gonna confess to the Commander?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Hatsuharu：</span><br>
W-when am I what?!<br>
<br>
Huh?!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Hatsuharu：</span><br>
W-w-what are you talking about, Wakaba?!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Wakaba：</span><br>
Just the other day you were wondering to yourself when the best time to "confess to the Commander" is! *Giggle*, I'm sure you 2 would make a great coup-<br>
Whuah?!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Hatsuharu：</span><br>
H-how in the world did you hear that?!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Wakaba：</span><br>
*Giggle*~ My ears are sharper than you might think~<br>
Speaking of which, there was one time when Hatsuharu was hoping that you-<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Hatsuharu：</span><br>
D-don't say any more!<br>
<br>
It seems our rowdy days will continue for some time.<br>
