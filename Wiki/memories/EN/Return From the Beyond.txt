Return From the Beyond<br>
<br>
1 Memory Spiral<br>
As the Naraka Singularity collapses, a lone ship cuts through the thick darkness on the edge of oblivion.<br>
Aboard the Akagi Mass-Produced Ship<br>
Command Deck<br>
En route home<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Memphis：</span><br>
What awful conditions... I didn't think you'd be able to sail a ship through all this dust and debris...<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
It's been three hours since we started moving. So far so good – let's hope things stay that way.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Akagi：</span><br>
How much longer do you think this take, Commander?<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Based on Observer's calculations and the speed of this vessel... I'd say another seven hours.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Memphis：</span><br>
Seven whole hours... So a ten-hour journey all in all.<br>
Strange, considering it only took you a moment to enter the world segment...<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
It's taking longer this time because we had to take a detour.<br>
Besides, ten hours to get from the Sakura Islands to the heart of the NA Ocean is by no means slow.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Memphis：</span><br>
True, I suppose.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Akagi：</span><br>
Speaking of which, how much time has passed for the people in the NA Ocean?<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
At least seven hours. Observer only sent me some formulas and didn't explain in detail.<br>
Do you want to have a look at them?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Akagi：</span><br>
Thanks, but I'll pass.<br>
Also, aren't you exhausted after this whole ordeal?<br>
You should get some rest. I'll stay here and hold the fort.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Not yet. I want to get a feel for what it's like aboard your vessel.<br>
I'm curious why you picked this one. Shinano's vessel seemed like it had better crew comfort.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Akagi：</span><br>
That is true. Shinano's is more livable.<br>
It's just... I had my reservations about making that our command vessel.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
You know, Observer said the same thing.<br>
Was there something wrong with it?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Akagi：</span><br>
Not at all. Just think of my choosing this vessel as a good omen.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Strange Sound：</span><br>
SHUFFLE...<br>
<br>
All of a sudden, I hear a sound like a stack of cards shuffling.<br>
A red mist starts to fill the room, folding me into it along with the space around me.<br>
A woman stands before a blackboard inside a brightly-lit room. She addresses me.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Dr. Anzeel：</span><br>
Assistant? Are you even listening?<br>
This part is EXTREMELY important!<br>
Come on, wake up. Just a little longer.<br>
ASSISTANT!<br>
<br>
A lady with a somewhat disheveled appearance hands me a business card inside a vast office space.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Colette：</span><br>
I'm Colette with the OXS Trade Alliance.<br>
Again, it's a pleasure to meet you, {playername}.<br>
<br>
A figure appears on a monitor inside a dark room.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">???：</span><br>
{playername}! The experiment has finally borne fruit!<br>
You rubbing shoulders with Aoste has really paid off. Heehee.<br>
This research is really going to give that stubborn bunch a shock.<br>
<br>
There is a large group of people sitting around a round table inside a conference room.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Elderly Voice：</span><br>
The meeting is now adjourned. Unfortunately, our proposed amendment did not pass the United Council's vote.<br>
As a result, we will continue with our original plan instead.<br>
It is time to make a decision, General {playername}.<br>
<br>
A girl in a classroom shows me the drawings in her sketchbook.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Anchorage：</span><br>
Teacher... Did I draw it well?<br>
Are you really... leaving tomorrow?<br>
Don't go... Stay here...<br>
<br>
A fleet of shipgirls are fighting a battle in a silvery sea.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Lexington：</span><br>
Commander?!<br>
What are you still doing here?<br>
Sara! Take the Commander and get out of here!<br>
<br>
KABOOOM!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">???：</span><br>
Com...der... Commander!<br>
<br>
Countless scenes flash before my eyes, appearing and disappearing in an instant.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">???：</span><br>
...you hear...<br>
<br>
It feels like my brain has been thrown inside a centrifuge spinning at maximum speed.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">???：</span><br>
Can you hear me?!<br>
<br>
My mind breaks, splits, and sinks into a vortex.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Memphis：</span><br>
Commander!<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Urgh...<br>
What happened...?<br>
<br>
It finally stops. I can think clearly again.<br>
I'm back aboard the Akagi mass-produced ship, surrounded by shipgirls looking concerned for me.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Memphis：</span><br>
Goodness... You really scared me there.<br>
You passed out with your eyes wide open! I called out to you over and over to no reaction.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Wait... I passed out? For how long?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Memphis：</span><br>
At least a full minute! ...Hey, Commander, are you sure you're okay?<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
A full minute?<br>
(Only a minute passed in reality? After all those things I saw?)<br>
It was probably nothing. I must just be tired.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Memphis：</span><br>
I sure hope that's all. You blanked out really hard.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Akagi：</span><br>
Memphis, your concern for the Commander is normal, but you mustn't lose your cool like that.<br>
You sounded like you were about to sound the alarm for the whole vessel before the Commander woke up.<br>
Thank goodness I was here. This could've turned into a huge ordeal otherwise.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Memphis：</span><br>
Excuse me for being too cautious, I guess...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Akagi：</span><br>
Now, Commander, you really should get some rest.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Alright. I will.<br>
(I want to know why and how that just happened... but at the same time, I can't concentrate at all right now.)<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Akagi：</span><br>
I'll have Zuikaku bring snacks to the break room. There are still hours left to go, so take this time to recharge your batteries.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Thanks. I appreciate it.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Memphis：</span><br>
Alright, alright, you just concentrate on steering the vessel. I'll show the Commander to the break room.<br>
<br>
Memphis walks over and gives me a shoulder to lean on.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Memphis：</span><br>
Easy, now. Come along.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Akagi：</span><br>
Not so fast. Why, exactly, should you escort the Commander?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Memphis：</span><br>
Someone has to. Or would you rather do it in my stead?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Akagi：</span><br>
Don't quip at me. If you're doing it, take those fruits with you.<br>
<br>
Akagi points to a bowl of fruits someone has left lying on the table.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Memphis：</span><br>
And do what?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Akagi：</span><br>
Peel them and feed the Commander one bite at a time. Do I need to explain everything to you?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Memphis：</span><br>
Excuse me?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Akagi：</span><br>
Come on. Take them and go.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Memphis：</span><br>
Ugh...<br>
<br>
Memphis flounders for a second before taking the bowl of fruits along.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Memphis：</span><br>
"Feed the Commander one bite at a time"... Who does she think I am?<br>
Whatever... I can't let myself get worked up over this.<br>
Come on, Commander. Let's get you to the break room, stat!<br>

Return From the Beyond<br>
<br>
2 The Dragon Palace's Plan<br>
The Dragon Palace, the host to the ritual that created Naraka, had returned to under the sea.<br>
Beneath a mystical sky where light of blue, gold, and violet color mingled, Sakuran shipgirls were moving to and fro.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Watarase：</span><br>
Ladies, we have fully dealt with the adversaries that the ritual gave rise to.<br>
The Dragon Palace is safe once more.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ibuki：</span><br>
And I have finished measuring the damages suffered.<br>
The outer ring sustained 35% damage, the middle ring sustained 24%, and the innermost ring sustained 16%.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Daisen：</span><br>
That's a lot worse than I anticipated...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ibuki：</span><br>
Indeed. The silver lining is that we have ample supplies in our stockpile. We shouldn't need to import anything for our repairs.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Daisen：</span><br>
That's good news. How long do you think it will take?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ibuki：</span><br>
Three days.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Daisen：</span><br>
Three entire days? Then in light of the severe corrosion damage the Prime Barrier suffered, I can only pray nothing else happens...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Shimanto：</span><br>
In that case, should I start setting up the cornerstone?<br>
It'll be ready by the time you finish the repairs if I start now.<br>
Then we can perform the ritual together and use the Dragon Palace's power to restore the Prime Barrier.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Daisen：</span><br>
Good idea. Let's go ahead with that.<br>
<br>
Just then, a beam of light shot down from the sky in front of them, bending into the shape of a shipgirl.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Shimanto：</span><br>
Unzen?! You're here?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Unzen：</span><br>
Excellent work to all of you.<br>
I come with orders from Lady Yamato.<br>
<br>
The golden light flickered, and the next moment, Unzen's temperament changed as though she had been possessed.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Unzen：</span><br>
"What state be the Dragon Palace in?"<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Daisen：</span><br>
It has suffered more damage than we'd hoped. It will take three days before we can begin restoring the Prime Barrier.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Unzen：</span><br>
"Very well."<br>
"What of that other matter?"<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Daisen：</span><br>
A team is recovering the pieces as we speak.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Unzen：</span><br>
"Following its reassembly, place the Orochi in the cornerstone of the Rite of Resurrection."<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Daisen：</span><br>
As you command.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Unzen：</span><br>
Lady Yamato has to prepare the Rite, and I, too, have matters to attend to. I will take my leave now.<br>
<br>
Unzen waved farewell, and the light scattered in all directions.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Daisen：</span><br>
Well... We must repair the Prime Barrier as soon as possible to ensure the Rite of Resurrection will go smoothly.<br>
Alright, ladies, let us get back to work.<br>

Return From the Beyond<br>
<br>
3 Dissociation<br>
Aboard the Akagi Mass-Produced Ship<br>
Break Room<br>
En route home<br>
Entering the break room, I see there are already plates of Sakuran snacks lining the table.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Memphis：</span><br>
Goodness. These treats are pretty fancy.<br>
<br>
Memphis places the bowl of fruits next to the plates and examines the snacks with great curiosity.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Memphis：</span><br>
They're very different to what you'd see in Europa or the Empery...<br>
I wonder if all Sakuran snacks are like this. Do you want one, Commander?<br>
<br>
She hands me a plate with colorful little doughy balls.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
What are these? Dango?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Memphis：</span><br>
Yep! Sakuran dango. I believe they're made using flour ground from koshihikari rice.<br>
As for the flavor... I think the red one is stuffed with red bean paste.<br>
Actually, do you mind if I help myself to one?<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Not at all. There's plenty to go around.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Onboard Broadcast System：</span><br>
BWEEE! BWEEE!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Memphis：</span><br>
Is that the ship-wide alarm?!<br>
*gasp*! Commander, grab on to–<br>
<br>
The ship rocks and shakes, and my grip on my body starts slipping away.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
(Not just my body... My mind is slipping away, too...)<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Strange Sound：</span><br>
SHUFFLE...<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
(What? What was that noise?)<br>
<br>
SHREEE!<br>
An ear-splitting ring jolts me just enough to stay conscious.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
(Where am I this time? Some sort of... machine moving at incredible speed?)<br>
<br>
The only thing that I can see is a faint, blue light.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
(I can't move... My muscles won't lift an inch...)<br>
(And yet, it doesn't feel like I'm in restraints...)<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Distant Voice：</span><br>
...I was not expecting them to catch up so quickly.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
(Whose voice is that? It sounds familiar...)<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Second Voice：</span><br>
Have they figured out the true purpose of our plan?<br>
Or is their blockade simply more solid than we thought?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Distant Voice：</span><br>
Keep releasing decoys. Disperse the pursuers and lead them to different coordinates.<br>
We will be safe as long as we leave this century.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Second Voice：</span><br>
Got it.<br>
<br>
Then, the voices fall silent.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
(Two distinct voices... One of them I think I recognize, but the other was completely foreign.)<br>
(It was hard to hear them through all the noise...)<br>
(Never mind that. Focus on getting back to reality.)<br>
<br>
My arms and legs don't seem to obey me at all... but at least I can still look around freely.<br>
I concentrate as best as I can and survey my surroundings.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
(Wait a sec... Where has my nose gone?)<br>
(You don't usually notice your own nose, but being unable to see it at all is another thing.)<br>
(Unless... No... Surely that can't be right.)<br>
(What if the reason I can't move my body is because... there is no body to move...)<br>
<br>
A terrifying thought crosses my mind.<br>
As if in response to my anxiety, the space around me trembles.<br>
The trembling intensifies and intensifies, and my mind feels on the brink of collapse...<br>
All of a sudden, it slows down, growing weaker until stopping completely.<br>
Mind still hazy from the shock, I see a sea of blue flowers and a woman standing in it.<br>
Petals take off into the cerulean sky and a head of silver hair flutters in the wind.<br>
A flash of white light envelops it all.<br>
When it fades, Memphis META appears before me.<br>
<span style="color:#c3abff;">Memphis META：</span><br>
Welcome back, Commander.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Memphis...?<br>
<span style="color:#c3abff;">Memphis META：</span><br>
That's me. Although, I'm not the Memphis you were just speaking to.<br>
She went off to see if the ship sustained any damage.<br>
Pointless, really. A little tumble like that couldn't possibly damage it.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Well, you can't blame her for wanting to make sure.<br>
<span style="color:#c3abff;">Memphis META：</span><br>
Whatever soothes her mind, I suppose.<br>
Anyway, how are you feeling? You don't feel ill, do you?<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
I'm fine, thanks.<br>
Might I ask why you're here?<br>
<span style="color:#c3abff;">Memphis META：</span><br>
I'm here to help you, if that wasn't obvious.<br>
Oh, sorry. Let me rephrase, I'm glad to finally get to help you.<br>
You can blame Helena for this. If it wasn't for her and her plan, you wouldn't have had to take a detour, and I wouldn't have had to show up.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
"Her and her plan"?<br>
<span style="color:#c3abff;">Memphis META：</span><br>
Uh... Nothing important. Forget I said it.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
If you say so. Do you know what that rocking and the alarm were about?<br>
Also, I got really close to passing out there again... What's happening to me?<br>
<span style="color:#c3abff;">Memphis META：</span><br>
One thing at a time. Firstly, the shaking happened due to a surge within Naraka, which shifted around a lot of debris.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
A surge? Care to elaborate?<br>
<span style="color:#c3abff;">Memphis META：</span><br>
It's a phenomenon that occurs sometimes within Naraka.<br>
When a surge happens, debris starts churning around like a current that drags anything caught within into the depths of Naraka.<br>
I suspect that's what caused your blackout as well.<br>
But, don't worry. You're not in danger anymore.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Being inside a Singularity is as dangerous as you'd expect, huh...<br>
By the way, how long did it take me to wake up after passing out?<br>
<span style="color:#c3abff;">Memphis META：</span><br>
Somewhere between seven and eight minutes.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
(They said I was just "blanking out" the first time, and this time I completely lost consciousness... I was out for longer, too.)<br>
<span style="color:#c3abff;">Memphis META：</span><br>
You look ready to keel over. Shouldn't you get some rest?<br>
<br>
At the same time, in a special space...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Observer ：</span><br>
That's two times now. Is your control over this passage weakening?<br>
<span style="color:#ffc960;">Helena META：</span><br>
I'll reroute resources from the Tower to stabilize it. You do the navigation.<br>
Take these admin privileges. Use them well.<br>
<br>
Observer's eyes twinkle like the stars in the sky.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Observer ：</span><br>
Hold on... Is this access to the Tower?<br>
I would've thought this was connected to the Natural Calculation System if the verification process wasn't completely different!<br>
I've heard the stories about you, but wow, you're something else. Your talent is truly comprehensive.<br>
You could even construct a new network using the Tower's powers.<br>
I must ask, though... What is the Tower really?<br>
<span style="color:#ffc960;">Helena META：</span><br>
Less talk, more focus.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Observer ：</span><br>
Heehee. Naturally! I feel strangely motivated for once, so rest assured, I'll do my job.<br>

<br>
4 Help From Across the Shore<br>
The Guardian Fox stood on the water's surface, performing a ceremonial dance.<br>
Shooting stars coursed through the sky, their tails changing with the flowing light.<br>
Two moons hung in the darkness overhead, waxing and waning, becoming part of the flowing lights.<br>
Eventually, all that remained in the dark night was those two moons.<br>
The ritual concluded, and the stars returned to their constellations.<br>
<span style="color:#bdbdbd;">Hatakaze META：</span><br>
...Are you preparing the Rite of Resurrection?<br>
I return home, and I'm swiftly treated to quite the spectacle indeed...<br>
I don't mind borrowing your strength, but is it necessary to help to this extent?<br>
<span style="color:#bdbdbd;">Nagato META：</span><br>
You suffered on account of me. You are deserving of this.<br>
<span style="color:#bdbdbd;">Hatakaze META：</span><br>
......<br>
<span style="color:#bdbdbd;">Nagato META：</span><br>
Tell me, what were the results of your "peeking" this time?<br>
<span style="color:#bdbdbd;">Hatakaze META：</span><br>
Precisely as you foresaw, Lady Nagato.<br>
But, no matter how strong they seem, they are still merely guinea pigs in the Sirens' experiments.<br>
<span style="color:#bdbdbd;">Nagato META：</span><br>
Were you not once like them?<br>
<span style="color:#bdbdbd;">Hatakaze META：</span><br>
Once, yes. Whether you admit it or not... we and them are completely different on an existential level.<br>
<span style="color:#bdbdbd;">Nagato META：</span><br>
What mean you to say?<br>
<span style="color:#bdbdbd;">Hatakaze META：</span><br>
I mean that even gods are not all equally powerful.<br>
That aside, I have given up on my plan for revenge. However, I will not support your plan either.<br>
For the time being, I am going to rest.<br>
<span style="color:#bdbdbd;">Nagato META：</span><br>
Very well. Do as you see fit.<br>
We share a goal, you and I. Though our paths to it may differ, we shall still meet at the end.<br>
<span style="color:#bdbdbd;">Hatakaze META：</span><br>
Farewell, Lady Nagato.<br>
<span style="color:#bdbdbd;">Houshou META：</span><br>
......<br>
Shall I keep an eye on her?<br>
<span style="color:#bdbdbd;">Nagato META：</span><br>
Nay. She has the right to make her own choices like anyone else.<br>
I can neither exercise control over you, nor must you obey my every command.<br>
<span style="color:#bdbdbd;">Houshou META：</span><br>
But Lady Nagato...<br>
<span style="color:#bdbdbd;">Nagato META：</span><br>
Be not so tense. I speak naught but the truth.<br>
Know that our affairs are more important than those plans of hers.<br>
My mind is made. We shall proceed forward with all we have.<br>
...You have witnessed what test site beta has weathered, Houshou. Act with due caution.<br>
<span style="color:#bdbdbd;">Houshou META：</span><br>
Of course. I will.<br>
If you'll pardon my curiosity, though... What do you think about that "Commander"?<br>
<span style="color:#bdbdbd;">Nagato META：</span><br>
You remember not your Commander, do you? As neither can I.<br>
<span style="color:#bdbdbd;">Houshou META：</span><br>
I do not... Truth be told, it's a very, very strange feeling.<br>
<span style="color:#bdbdbd;">Nagato META：</span><br>
All the more reason for us to be cautious.<br>
That one may be involved in the Council's secret plan...<br>
Let us save this discussion for another time.<br>
<span style="color:#bdbdbd;">Houshou META：</span><br>
Yes, ma'am.<br>

5 The Third Strike<br>
Aboard the Akagi Mass-Produced Ship<br>
Break Room<br>
En route home<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Onboard Broadcast System：</span><br>
BWEEE! BWEEE!<br>
<br>
The wail of a siren wakes me from my slumber.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Communicator：</span><br>
BEEP BEEP!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Memphis：</span><br>
Commander, this is an emergency! Stay in the break room! I'll come to you!<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Why was the alarm sounded? What's happening?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Memphis：</span><br>
There are enemies at our six!<br>
According to our META allies, they look like the corruption-born entities we encountered in the world segment.<br>
They've taken the form of the Akagi, probably because we're traveling on it.<br>
Whatever the case, Akagi and Observer are working to shake them off.<br>
As for everyone else–<br>
<br>
KABOOOM!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Memphis：</span><br>
Oh no! Sounds like they've caught up to us!<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
No need to come to me! I'll head to the bridge!<br>
Tell everyone I'll be taking command as soon as possible!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Memphis：</span><br>
Got it!<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
(First a surge, now an ambush... This place is becoming more and more dangerous.)<br>
(Even if we survive this encounter, we still have to make it out of the Singularity...)<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Strange Sound：</span><br>
SHUFFLE...<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
(What?! There it is again!)<br>
(God, this is awful timing!)<br>
<br>
Darkness swallows my mind in the blink of an eye.<br>
KABOOOM!<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
(Explosions... Am I going to have a vision of a battle next?)<br>
<br>
In the darkness, strands of light take form one after the next.<br>
Their radiance is like auroras – like galaxies – like bright lanes in the sea.<br>
Massive warships line up within the light, advancing bravely as a torrent of steel.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
(Look at them, each a kilometer long... and their enemies are even bigger.)<br>
(What on earth are those things?)<br>
<br>
Their opponents are distorted and warped like monsters from a nightmare, with white exteriors like fresh snow.<br>
Brandishing innumerable feelers and claws, they halt the line of warships, slowly but surely diminishing their numbers.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
(This is a war of attrition, and they're losing...)<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Arbiter: The Empress III：</span><br>
This is a war of attrition, and we're losing.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Observer Zero：</span><br>
In three system hours, we will be able to leave this era. Then they can touch us no longer.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
(Is that... Zero?!)<br>
(Oh my god... Is that fleet Antiochus?)<br>
(If only I could move... I can't even speak!)<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">moon：</span><br>
The War Protocol series is particularly effective against higher-level crystalline targets.<br>
Star and I have the most units equipped with this series. I believe we two are best suited to stall the enemy.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Observer Zero：</span><br>
Understood.<br>
<br>
The holograms of the Moon and the Empress disappear.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Observer Zero：</span><br>
......<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
(Is she... Is she looking at me?)<br>
<br>
Seemingly in reaction to my stress, the space around me starts to tremble.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
(What now?!)<br>
<br>
The trembling grows in intensity, and my mind yet again feels ready to implode...<br>
Then, once again, the trembling slows down and weakens before stopping altogether.<br>
It's almost like someone anticipated this happening and prepared a countermeasure.<br>
Back at the sea of blue flowers, the silver-haired woman shows herself again.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Is that... you?!<br>
<span style="color:#c3abff;">???：</span><br>
......<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
No! Wait!<br>
<br>
The white light blots out the flowers and the woman, heedless of my cries.<br>
When my vision returns to me, I'm back in the break room again.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Memphis, what's happening outside?<br>
<span style="color:#c3abff;">Memphis META：</span><br>
That's the first thing you ask after fainting?<br>
Well, good news. You got away safely.<br>
I'm more worried about you, though. This is the third time it's happened now, no?<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Yeah... I keep passing out without any warning.<br>
How much time passed this time?<br>
<span style="color:#c3abff;">Memphis META：</span><br>
20 minutes, give or take. Each time, you're out for longer than the last.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Was it because of another surge? Didn't you say we left the danger zone?<br>
<span style="color:#c3abff;">Memphis META：</span><br>
Something else must be causing it, then. Something within Naraka itself that we don't know about.<br>
Helena said she'll take care of it, but we'll have to wait and see.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Alright. I'll let the others know I'm safe.<br>
<br>
At the same time, in a special space...<br>
<span style="color:#ffc960;">Helena META：</span><br>
That's three times now... Thank goodness you're here.<br>
<span style="color:#c3abff;">Yorktown META：</span><br>
Helena, the anomalies inside Naraka aren't natural. Someone is deliberately causing them.<br>
They're trying to destabilize your escape route.<br>
<span style="color:#ffc960;">Helena META：</span><br>
Who's doing it?<br>
<span style="color:#c3abff;">Yorktown META：</span><br>
I don't know.<br>
My only guess is that it may be the same person who caused you trouble in the Martyrium.<br>
<span style="color:#ffc960;">Helena META：</span><br>
The same person?<br>
No, that can't be. The data the Tower's collected is completely different. The intensity and the energy waves are nothing like it, either. There's no way they come from the same source.<br>
<span style="color:#c3abff;">Yorktown META：</span><br>
That doesn't mean much. The data you get from Naraka is different every time.<br>
<span style="color:#ffc960;">Helena META：</span><br>
Yes, and that's why I thought the anomalies were sporadic. They...<br>
......<br>
Are you suggesting our enemy has mastered multiple methods of offense and they're stronger than us?<br>
<span style="color:#c3abff;">Yorktown META：</span><br>
It's just a hunch, but it's very likely.<br>
<span style="color:#ffc960;">Helena META：</span><br>
...Whatever the case, this route is too dangerous.<br>
Luckily, Shinano's talisman links her to the Watatsumi. We can use her as the key to open the locked passage.<br>
<span style="color:#c3abff;">Yorktown META：</span><br>
No! Many people will die if you do that! Not just recreations from the world segment, but real people!<br>
<span style="color:#ffc960;">Helena META：</span><br>
So what if they die?<br>
<span style="color:#c3abff;">Yorktown META：</span><br>
The Commander will never forgive you for it.<br>
<span style="color:#ffc960;">Helena META：</span><br>
......<br>
The Commander doesn't have to know.<br>
<span style="color:#c3abff;">Yorktown META：</span><br>
I'll personally tell the Commander if you do it.<br>
<span style="color:#ffc960;">Helena META：</span><br>
What do you want me to do, then? Just take the risk?!<br>
<span style="color:#c3abff;">Yorktown META：</span><br>
Nothing is without risk. There will always be things you can't control.<br>
<span style="color:#ffc960;">Helena META：</span><br>
I don't WANT things to be out of my control.<br>
<span style="color:#c3abff;">Yorktown META：</span><br>
It's okay, Helena. I can afford to wait. The Commander will be fine.<br>
<span style="color:#ffc960;">Helena META：</span><br>
...Hold on to this for me.<br>
<span style="color:#c3abff;">Yorktown META：</span><br>
What are you doing?<br>
<span style="color:#ffc960;">Helena META：</span><br>
Concentrating fully on navigation. I'm getting us out of here immediately!<br>

Return From the Beyond<br>
<br>
6 Madam M<br>
The light recedes, and I find myself inside a bright classroom.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
(This is new... I didn't pass out like the last time. This feels more like when Helena connects me to her secret space...)<br>
(Only this time, I'm not in outer space, but in a classroom.)<br>
(Where is Helena, anyway?)<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">???：</span><br>
Waiting for someone?<br>
<br>
I'm greeted not by Helena, but by a purple-haired woman donning business attire.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Madam M：</span><br>
Heehee. Well met. I'm Madam M.<br>
<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项1："M"?</span>'''''<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项2：Are you a friend of Miss D?</span>'''''<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项1）</span>'''''Do you work for the Secret Service, or...?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Madam M：</span><br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项1）</span>'''''Oh, no. I'm not that kind of "M". That's not my line of work.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Madam M：</span><br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项2）</span>'''''Well, you could say I know her, but also that I don't.<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项2）</span>'''''Either way, she's not pertinent to this conversation.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Do you know where Helena is?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Madam M：</span><br>
Ah, Helena. She must be busy preparing for a possible fourth attack.<br>
Regardless, she didn't summon you here. I did.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
You're not... responsible for the blackouts I've been experiencing, are you?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Madam M：</span><br>
Partly. It mostly had nothing to do with me, though.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
......<br>
Which parts are you and which parts are somebody else?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Madam M：</span><br>
You want me to just tell you? That wouldn't be fun.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
I don't think any of this is "fun."<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Madam M：</span><br>
Really? You don't think it's fun to look for knowledge in the unknown?<br>
You've been through so many bizarre things, and you don't want to know more?<br>
Like who you are, or what you've seen?<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Of course I want to know that, but you're not going to tell me, are you?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Madam M：</span><br>
Correct. It's more fun if you find the answers for yourself.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
So what did you summon me for, then?<br>
If you don't have anything to tell me, just send me back.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">???：</span><br>
You're leaving... already?<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Huh?!<br>
<br>
A girl sitting close to me looks at me with curious eyes.<br>
She caught me by surprise. She blended in so perfectly that I didn't notice her.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
(I thought Madam M and I were the only ones here... Where did she come from?)<br>
Are you... Zero?<br>
<br>
Her resemblance to TB and Zero is uncanny, despite her obviously being younger.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Madam M：</span><br>
Oh, she's just studying here. Don't mind her.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Studying?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Madam M：</span><br>
Observing, understanding, learning... Things you do in a classroom.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Yes, but I meant...<br>
Wait, where did she go?<br>
<br>
When I look again, she's gone. As though she was only a figment of my imagination.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Madam M：</span><br>
Let's get back on topic.<br>
As you guessed, I'm not going to tell you anything.<br>
However, I will guarantee you the right to search and to choose.<br>
If you want answers, you can find them for yourself.<br>
Not a bad offer, wouldn't you agree?<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
I mean, I still don't get what you're talking about.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Madam M：</span><br>
You will. Eventually.<br>
Now, it's time to leave. For me, and for you.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
To leave what? You mean... the Singularity?<br>
Are you really saying it's been three hours in the real world? But it only felt like minutes to me...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Madam M：</span><br>
Hard to believe, isn't it? Heehee.<br>
<br>
As the light fades, I'm greeted by the ceiling of the break room aboard the Akagi.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
(What time is it?)<br>
(No way... It really HAS been three hours!)<br>
(Well, then again, that's not THAT surprising. I was taking a nap, after all.)<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Memphis：</span><br>
You're back up. Did you sleep well?<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Crap... Sorry for falling asleep like that. I said I'd go to the bridge and everything.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Memphis：</span><br>
Don't sweat it. We shook our attackers off. People have been in and out to check on you.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
So was I just sleeping? Like normal?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Memphis：</span><br>
Well, yes. Why do you ask?<br>
Oh no... You had another vision in your dream, didn't you?!<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
No, nothing like that. I was just wondering.<br>
(Actually... DID I see anything in my dreams?)<br>
(I could've sworn I was about to ask Helena something...)<br>
(Something, something, purple-haired woman? I don't know. I can't remember.)<br>
(Maybe it was just a regular old dream.)<br>
Have we made it out of the Singularity?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Memphis：</span><br>
Not quite yet. We're out of Naraka's range, but now we're inside the NA Ocean Singularity.<br>
We'll exit that in just a bit, though.<br>
In other news, Shinano vanished the instant we exited Naraka's range.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Yeah. Like Helena said would happen.<br>
Seems like this whole time, she was just a projection, only able to exist inside the Singularity.<br>
Although, considering her connection to the Watatsumi, she might have witnessed everything as part of a dream.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Memphis：</span><br>
What's our Shinano doing now, then?<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
She's probably in bed in the Orthodoxy's consulate, having just woken up.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Memphis：</span><br>
So she can do anything all from the comfort of her bed... So lazy.<br>
Or, I guess I should say... I'm jealous.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Ahahaha. I, for one, am just glad that we're out of the woods.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Memphis：</span><br>
In no small part thanks to you. We're finally going home!<br>

<br>
7 Everburning Flame<br>
Amidst the debris in Naraka, a woman clad in dark red stood and gazed at the long-gone wake left by the Akagi.<br>
<span style="color:#bdbdbd;">Akagi META：</span><br>
......<br>
"We'll keep on changing things until there's no more sadness."<br>
<br>
KABOOOM!<br>
A sea of flames. A memory. A few figures weakly swaying on the moonlit sea's surface.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Kaga：</span><br>
Hang in there. We're almost at the eye of the storm!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Amagi：</span><br>
They have us surrounded. Our enemy was clearly well prepared.<br>
Even if we retreat to the storm's eye, it's unlikely we'll escape safely.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Kaga：</span><br>
Dammit...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Amagi：</span><br>
This really is absurd... Mobilizing this large a force and calling it an "exercise" won't fool anyone.<br>
I wonder what excuse they'll come up with to hide the truth this time.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Kaga：</span><br>
There are better things to wonder about! Focus!<br>
They were waiting to ambush us, so they almost definitely knew about our plan.<br>
If so, we're probably not their only targets. They must've attacked others, too.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Amagi：</span><br>
I wouldn't worry about that.<br>
It's clear that they're giving us special treatment, judging by the intensity of their attacks.<br>
I suppose it's because we have more "big shots" on our side...<br>
Regardless, Flare will be established whether or not we can regroup in the end.<br>
It's just a shame that we will never get to see the fire burn.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Akagi：</span><br>
Heheh... Heheheh...<br>
They created and used us as no more than weapons... They held us to expectations and feared us, all without asking us...<br>
And now, they've decided it's time for us to sink...<br>
Heheheh...<br>
We tried to embrace the world, and this is what we get?<br>
If that's what they want, then so be it!<br>
<br>
The flames rose, and crimson spider lilies bloomed en masse.<br>
<span style="color:#ffc960;">Akagi META：</span><br>
Heheh... Heheheh... Ahahahaha!<br>
Die, then...<br>
Burn to ashes, then...<br>
If I must perish, I will take them all with me!<br>
AHAHAHAHAHA!<br>
I have no memory of you.<br>
But I know that you aren't to blame for the fate they suffered.<br>
You were simply... unable to stop it.<br>
Many deserve to perish, but you are not one of them.<br>
"Keep on changing things until there's no more sadness..."<br>
That's what you wish for.<br>
And whatever lies at the end of that path, I will witness it with you.<br>
<br>
A wind chime appeared in Akagi's hand.<br>
She rang it, sending ripples propagating across the water.<br>
A while later, the ringing faded, and she was nowhere to be seen.<br>
With no one left to observe it, Naraka folded in on itself before disappearing completely.<br>

8 Omen of Incompatibility<br>
Test Site Beta<br>
NA Ocean<br>
Outside the central Singularity<br>
The battle in the NA Ocean was over before we even left the Singularity.<br>
According to Hiryuu META, the reinforcements the Ashes brought finished the fight. However, she herself didn't know who the reinforcements were.<br>
At any rate, leaders of all factions were informed when we'd left the Singularity, and they swiftly gathered to welcome me back.<br>
Shinano was there too, of course.<br>
Now, we're having a party aboard a New Jersey mass-produced ship to celebrate a mission accomplished.<br>
New Jersey Mass-Produced Ship - Ad Hoc Banquet Hall<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Littorio：</span><br>
A toast! To the Commander's great triumph!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">King George V：</span><br>
Yes! Let us have a toast!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">New Jersey：</span><br>
Honey, you do the honors!<br>
<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项1：Uhh... Cheers.</span>'''''<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项2：Cheers!</span>'''''<br>
<br>
The party is a rather lavish one, owing to their immense enthusiasm in the moment.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Tirpitz：</span><br>
Commander, could you share with us what happened inside Naraka?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Shimakaze：</span><br>
Yes! Please tell us! How did you bring Amagi and Kaga back to life? We're all dying to hear it!<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Hmm... Where do I start?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Clemenceau：</span><br>
Pardon me, but there's one thing I want you to explain to me first.<br>
<br>
Clemenceau produces a small brooch as she interjects.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Clemenceau：</span><br>
Do you remember this?<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
That's your brooch, isn't it?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Clemenceau：</span><br>
So you DO remember. Good.<br>
Here, take it. Make sure it doesn't get lost again.<br>
<br>
She leans closer and offers the brooch not to me, but to Memphis.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Clemenceau：</span><br>
...What's the matter? Cat got your tongue?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Memphis：</span><br>
Wait, you're giving it to me?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Clemenceau：</span><br>
That I am. Keep it safe, will you?<br>
<br>
It looks like Memphis isn't going to take it, so Clemenceau takes aim and tosses it to her.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Memphis：</span><br>
Wha– Hey!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Clemenceau：</span><br>
Good reaction speed.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Memphis：</span><br>
(Uhh... What's going on?)<br>
(I thought she was going to give it to the Commander?)<br>
(Why did she give it to me?)<br>
(Does she, like... want ME to give it to the Commander?)<br>
(Why do it in such a roundabout way? The Commander is right... over...)<br>
Wait... Where is the Commander?<br>
<br>
Memphis' eyes open wide in shock and confusion.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Memphis：</span><br>
C-Commander?<br>
Helena, where'd the Commander go?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Helena：</span><br>
I don't know... I closed my eyes for one second, and then...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Littorio：</span><br>
"Commander"? Who?<br>
Ah, you mean the person commanding our joint fleet, I assume.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">New Jersey：</span><br>
So me, in other words?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Memphis：</span><br>
Huh?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Amagi(CV)：</span><br>
This does not bode well...<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Girls? What's the matter?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Clemenceau：</span><br>
Hmm... What a curious reaction.<br>
It seems that my little brooch doesn't want to be in anyone's hands but mine or the Commander's.<br>
Take it, Commander, and keep it close.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Memphis：</span><br>
(What... just happened?)<br>
Commander, where did you go?<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
"Go"? I was standing right here this whole time.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Memphis：</span><br>
What? But...<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
You look a bit pale. Are you feeling ill?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Memphis：</span><br>
I'm fine! I think I've just had too much to drink...<br>
(Even if I was just drunk, that wouldn't explain how the others reacted! Something is seriously wrong!)<br>
(What's going on? Even the Commander is acting like nothing happened!)<br>
Well, uh, you heard Clemenceau. You should hold on to the brooch.<br>
<br>
She hands me the brooch. It's wrapped up in a blue handkerchief.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Isn't this your favorite handkerchief? I'll take the brooch, but you keep this.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Memphis：</span><br>
No, no, it's fine. You should keep it wrapped up so it doesn't get scratched. That'd be terrible.<br>
Besides, you can just give the handkerchief back later.<br>
(Wait, what am I doing? Focus, me!)<br>
(I've got to figure out what in the world just happened!)<br>
(Starting by not letting the Commander out of my sight for even a second...)<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Littorio：</span><br>
Hahaha! That was a fine scene to behold.<br>
Now, unless anyone has anything else to say, let's get back to our drinks!<br>
<br>
Without any warning, the Commander vanished into thin air right again before the shipgirls' eyes.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Amagi(CV)：</span><br>
It seems as though most people didn't notice, just like the last time.<br>
It gets even stranger... All signs of the Commander ever existing disappear at the same time.<br>
Writings, pictures – anything recording the Commander's existence just vanishes. Even our memories.<br>
Reality even bends in accordance with it. Clemenceau handed you the brooch instead, and instead of celebrating the Commander's return, we're celebrating mine.<br>
It's as if $1 was erased from reality, with everything else being rewritten to conform to that change.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Memphis：</span><br>
I started recording to figure out what's going on, and still nothing...<br>
Why is this happening? What are we supposed to do?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Akagi：</span><br>
Don't panic, for a start. It won't do us any good.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Amagi(CV)：</span><br>
Akagi is right. Let's try to stay calm and work through the facts together.<br>
No one but us has noticed anything is wrong. If nothing else, that proves that not everyone here is compromised.<br>
That leads me to think that the Commander isn't disappearing per se, but rather that someone is influencing our cognition.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Memphis & Helena & Zuikaku：</span><br>
......<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Akagi：</span><br>
Don't look at me. I have nothing to do with this.<br>
Why would I do that to someone I care about?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Amagi(CV)：</span><br>
I don't suspect you, Akagi. We've walked around the whole night together, so you can't have done anything behind my back.<br>
Having said that, you're the only one amongst us with any knowledge pertaining to cognitive influence.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Akagi：</span><br>
You're not wrong, and this does indeed resemble a case of cognitive influence.<br>
However, why, then, are we not affected, even though we're surrounded by others who are?<br>
I can think of only two plausible explanations.<br>
One – the perpetrator is nearby and can selectively control whose cognition is affected.<br>
This theory doesn't explain why we are unaffected, however.<br>
Two – there is something special about our bodies or minds, and therefore we aren't affected by the influence.<br>
We are within range of it, but we're simply unaffected by it, in other words.<br>
On the other hand, while we remember the Commander, we cannot see the Commander with our own eyes.<br>
This makes me think that we are only partially immune to it.<br>
As for the thing we have in common that those affected don't have...<br>
It's the fact that we're all returnees from Naraka.<br>
We may have picked up something inside Naraka and unknowingly brought it back with us.<br>
Shinano, does anything come to mind?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Shinano ：</span><br>
This one detects no traces of powers in this place that may alter the cognition...<br>
Alas, 'tis unlikely this be a simple case of such tampering of the mind...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Akagi：</span><br>
Are you saying that the situation is far more serious than we suspected?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Shinano ：</span><br>
Indeed... Yamato concurs with this conjecture...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ryuuhou：</span><br>
Come again? Did you say Yamato concurs?<br>
Is she here? Where?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Shinano ：</span><br>
She is not...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Akagi：</span><br>
So you've been talking to her then, have you?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Shinano ：</span><br>
Nay, this one hasn't had the privilege for a while...<br>
However, Yamato did priorly relay to this one a message...<br>
"Retain your composure and let not the others catch on."<br>
"Go to the World Expo and enter the garden of our Empire's pavilion."<br>
"There, you shall find a way to resolve this crisis."<br>
"For the good of not only us, but for $1 as well."<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Akagi：</span><br>
Elaborate instructions from Yamato... This must be extremely dire.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Shinano ：</span><br>
We cannot let the Commander be forgotten...<br>
$1 must not vanish tracelessly from this world...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Akagi：</span><br>
That will not happen. Not as long as I breathe.<br>
Dear sister, ladies – let's leave at once!<br>

Return From the Beyond<br>
<br>
9 Directional Creation<br>
The wails of steel grinding against steel echo under a starry sky.<br>
Two thoughts have been on my mind since I was brought here.<br>
The first – the battle here just ended. The smell of gunpowder still hangs in the air.<br>
The second – I am $1. Obviously.<br>
I do not know where I am or what transpired here, however.<br>
Whenever I try to remember, it's like there's a veil of fog shrouding my memories.<br>
Other things I do remember, but only vaguely. Many more things, I cannot remember at all.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
I am {playername}. That much I know for certain.<br>
The clothes I wear belong to a high-ranking naval officer.<br>
Which navy? I do not know. Where do I come from? I do not know.<br>
And yet, facts about battlefield tactics and weaponry come to me easily.<br>
I remember the KAN-SEN, the Sirens, X, and the Antiochus, all without issue.<br>
There is some knowledge of a test site alpha, a Dr. Anzeel and Dr. Aoste, and a Zero as well.<br>
Then there's the brooch and handkerchief in my hand... These I don't recognize.<br>
Dammit... Some of my memories are just gone.<br>
How did this happen? Why did it happen?<br>
There's that purple-haired woman I spoke to...<br>
She told me her name... What was it?<br>
Why do I suddenly remember her, anyway?<br>
<br>
I write down all my thoughts and memories in a notepad while I navigate this maze of remembrance.<br>
After a while, I've pieced together enough fragmented memories to create a picture of who I am.<br>
My name is {playername}. I come from a place known as test site alpha.<br>
I'm Dr. Anzeel's assistant and a collaborator to Dr. Aoste.<br>
I've been involved in numerous research projects concerning KAN-SEN and the Antiochus.<br>
I've worked in scientific research, education, and now in the navy.<br>
I've commanded in many successful battles.<br>
I've fought against the META... then I fought against X.<br>
And that's all I can remember.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Well, it's far from exhaustive, but it gives me some direction.<br>
Still don't have the faintest clue about where I am, though.<br>
My first instinct is to get out of here...<br>
The only problem is, I don't see any way out.<br>
<br>
Rising out of the ruins, I take my communicator out of my pocket and try to make a call. No response.<br>
In the midst of my confusion, a girl appears out of the flames around me.<br>
<span style="color:#ffc960;">Admiral Hipper META：</span><br>
Huh?<br>
Why are you out here?<br>
<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项1：Admiral... Hipper?</span>'''''<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项2：Hipper, it's you!</span>'''''<br>
<span style="color:#ffc960;">Admiral Hipper META：</span><br>
Sorry? You know who I am?<br>
Have we met before?<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
I... don't remember.<br>
<span style="color:#ffc960;">Admiral Hipper META：</span><br>
So how come you know who I am?<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Well... I don't remember that, either.<br>
<span style="color:#ffc960;">Admiral Hipper META：</span><br>
Oookay... How did you get here in the first place?<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Hate to sound like a broken record, but I don't remember.<br>
<span style="color:#ffc960;">Admiral Hipper META：</span><br>
Of course you don't.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
If you don't mind me asking, do you know where we are?<br>
<span style="color:#ffc960;">Admiral Hipper META：</span><br>
What does it matter? It's not like you'll remember.<br>
Here's what you should do – sit there all pretty and wait for rescue to arrive.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Rescue? Who's coming to rescue me?<br>
<span style="color:#ffc960;">Admiral Hipper META：</span><br>
What does it matter? It's not like you'll remember.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
I'm sorry. I have a bad case of memory loss.<br>
<span style="color:#ffc960;">Admiral Hipper META：</span><br>
Ugh...<br>
Yes, that's pretty obvious. You're also the first person not to scream in fear at the sight of me.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Why would I be scared of you? And don't say "it doesn't matter."<br>
<span style="color:#ffc960;">Admiral Hipper META：</span><br>
Again – it's not like you'll remember even if I tell you.<br>
Bye.<br>
<br>
She turns around gracefully and leaves.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
She's gone...<br>
Well, she told me to wait, so I guess that's what I'll do.<br>
I'll go through what I can remember one more time meanwhile.<br>
Dammit... Why did I have to forget everything?<br>
<br>
