<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Saratoga：</span><br>
Enterprise, I'm sooo bored~ Why don't we go grab Minneapolis and then head to shore for a barbecue?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Enterprise：</span><br>
Saratoga, don't be too relaxed. Our mission isn't to be taken lightly.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Saratoga：</span><br>
Got it, I was just joking~ This air base is really important, isn't it? I may like to play around, but I wouldn't forget that!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Enterprise：</span><br>
Our enemies won't sit by idly while we occupy this place. Our recon planes have already confirmed that the Sakura Fleet is moving.<br>
To make matters worse, Wasp had to head south to resupply. It's up to the two of us to make a difference here.<br>
Come to think of it, I'm fortunate to have only gotten scratches from the last battle... Although if we were there at Savo, perhaps...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Saratoga：</span><br>
Meh, it's not your fault, Enty~ The decision was made by the top brass, wasn't it?<br>
Though I'm upset that Astoria and the others were hurt, just being mad won't accomplish anything... We simply have to do what we have to do.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Enterprise：</span><br>
I know, but...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Saratoga：</span><br>
That's enough for now! Enterprise, I know just how stressed you've been lately~!<br>
The battle isn't over yet. If you don't keep calm, you might make a mistake at a crucial moment. Relax, relax~<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Enterprise：</span><br>
You're right... I understand.<br>
Sorry, Sara. I know you're still coping with Lexington, you don't have to worry about me.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Saratoga：</span><br>
It's fine, it's fine! Something like this is a walk in the park for me!<br>
I'm sure that my sister would want me to keep my spirits up and get a punch in for her sake~<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Enterprise：</span><br>
You're exactly right, I should learn from your example. I have to get back at the Sakura Fleet for my sister's sake as well.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Saratoga：</span><br>
All righty, that decides it~! So, wanna grab barbecue?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Enterprise：</span><br>
Hah... I suppose I'll take you up on that offer.<br>

<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Saratoga：</span><br>
Ah... looks like the barbecue's going to have to wait. We've found the enemy!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Enterprise：</span><br>
Hardly, consider this a celebratory victory meal. What's the enemy's position?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Saratoga：</span><br>
...to the north!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Enterprise：</span><br>
Well then...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Saratoga：</span><br>
W-wait... the opponent... is a single light carrier? Is that... Ryuujou?<br>
Huh... the direction seems to be correct, but according to the reports, we should be expecting Shoukaku and Zuikaku...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Enterprise：</span><br>
I understand the situation... Portland, can you bring Atlanta and Minneapolis along with you and scout ahead?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Portland：</span><br>
Indy, why'd you have to go to the Aleutians... I miss you so much, waah~<br>
Ack! I-I know!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Atlanta：</span><br>
Understood! Leave it to me!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Minneapolis：</span><br>
Let's go!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Enterprise：</span><br>
Portland never changes, does she...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Saratoga：</span><br>
What's the harm? I'd be happy if my sister always doted on me! Although... having her around would make it hard for me to play pranks...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Enterprise：</span><br>
Good grief... forget it, I can't picture that happening at all.<br>
Anyway, since the enemy has appeared, let's be sure to give them the old Union-style greeting. Prepare to sortie!<br>

<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Portland：</span><br>
Atlanta, I'm telling you, my cute little Indy-<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Atlanta：</span><br>
Hold your horses. Look over there...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Hiei：</span><br>
I've been expecting you all.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Kirishima：</span><br>
One battleship, one heavy cruiser, one light cruiser, and a few destroyers... are you mocking us?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Hiei：</span><br>
Hehe, it looks like we have no choice but to demonstrate our power.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Kirishima：</span><br>
That's right!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Atlanta：</span><br>
They're full of killing intent.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Portland：</span><br>
Heh, it's nothing compared to my killing intent from being separated from Indy!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Atlanta：</span><br>
Then, let's break our way through here!<br>
{{折叠面板|内容结束}}

{{折叠面板|标题=Battle Analysis|选项=4|主框=1|样式=primary|展开=否}}
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Enterprise：</span><br>
We've received warnings of incoming airstrikes from the air base. This must be Ryuujou's attack squadron. Sara, what should we do?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Saratoga：</span><br>
There's no use panicking~ The base's anti-air defenses should be able to hold them at bay. My fighters should be more than enough to clean up.<br>
More importantly, we must focus on locating Shoukaku and Zuikaku with our recon planes... They must be nearby.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Enterprise：</span><br>
You have a point.... Such a direct attack like this makes me think that this is a decoy. Surely... it's not a repeat of that time at the Coral Sea...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Saratoga：</span><br>
Who knows? Maybe they ended up in the same situation as we were in, and were commanded to retreat...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Enterprise：</span><br>
Hmm... I suppose there's no point speculating. But this strategy is undeniably effective.<br>
We have no choice but to defend this island. We can't let them bomb us freely...<br>
But if we overcommit to staving off the airstrikes, we will be vulnerable to attack... And if we are to fall, the entire island will follow suit.<br>
So, we've got to work together to get out of this...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Saratoga：</span><br>
However, considering how many carriers they lost at Midway, they'd use another one as bait?<br>
I'm not sure whether to commend their bravery or their stupidity...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Enterprise：</span><br>
They're trying to catch us off guard, but we won't be had so easily... Wait, what's that?<br>
So they're here. Zuikaku and Shoukaku's air group...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Saratoga：</span><br>
We have no choice... let's get through this!<br>

<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Portland：</span><br>
Haah...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Atlanta：</span><br>
Portland, since we've started the mission, you've looked at Indianapolis's photo 105 times and sighed 115 times...<br>
She's just out on another mission, and that much is enough to send you spiralling down into despair?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Portland：</span><br>
But Indy is just thaaat cute! Atlanta, you're also a big sister, right? Don't you also know about the cuteness of little sisters?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Atlanta：</span><br>
Cuteness is of no concern to me. In the first place, one is a dork and the other is a crybaby...<br>
But I suppose I'll admit, they're both cute...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Portland：</span><br>
You see? Don't you feel lonely when you can't be with them?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Atlanta：</span><br>
Dunno. I actually like being able to hear myself think when San Diego isn't orbiting around me.<br>
Of course, I'd prefer to be with them, but there's no getting around the fact that everyone has a job to do.<br>
And that job is to protect the home that everyone can reunite to.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Portland：</span><br>
Hehe, in order to protect Indy, I won't be harmed by anything! Even if I do get hurt, I'd still claw my way to her side!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Atlanta：</span><br>
If there's one thing I can count on, it's your unhealthy obsession with your sister... Jeez, compared to you, I can't even consider myself a big sister...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Portland：</span><br>
Ah... a message from Saratoga...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Atlanta：</span><br>
What does it say?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Portland：</span><br>
... Ryuujou is a decoy, and the real attack from Shoukaku and Zuikaku is coming!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Atlanta：</span><br>
What?!<br>
My anti-air capabilities are quite strong, so I'll head back to support Saratoga. Portland, take the others and continue on.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Portland：</span><br>
No, Saratoga said that she and Enterprise will be able to handle it, and that your abilities will be needed here.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Atlanta：</span><br>
I see... got it. Let's move forward then!<br>

{{折叠面板|标题=Versus the Virtuous Sister!?|选项=6|主框=1|样式=primary|展开=否}}
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Atlanta：</span><br>
That girl is...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Mutsu：</span><br>
Why am I so much slower than Hiei and Kirishima even though we're all battleships?<br>
Why does Ryuujou have to act as a decoy anyway?<br>
Arghh... if only Nagato was here...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Portland：</span><br>
... Even though she doesn't compare to Indy, what a virtuous little sister!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Atlanta：</span><br>
... And you're going to hold back because of it?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Portland：</span><br>
Don't worry! No matter how many cute and virtuous little sisters are out there, the only one that matters in my heart is Indy!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Atlanta：</span><br>
Good grief...<br>

<br>
Meanwhile, on the other front...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Saratoga：</span><br>
Enterprise!<br>
Enterprise! Are you okay?!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Enterprise：</span><br>
I'm fine, don't worry about me. I can... *cough* *cough*... keep going!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Saratoga：</span><br>
Unforgivable! Ignoring me to focus all their firepower on Enterprise...!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Enterprise：</span><br>
Heh... after what happened at Midway... if those two are Akagi and Kaga's successors, then their fixation on me is not that unexpected.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Saratoga：</span><br>
Get behind me already, Enterprise! I'll take care of the rest!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Enterprise：</span><br>
Will you be fine on your own?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Saratoga：</span><br>
Heheh, don't you forget! Saratoga is the big senior of the Union carriers!<br>
Just now, my recon planes located Shoukaku and Zuikaku, and more importantly...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Enterprise：</span><br>
*cough* What is it?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Saratoga：</span><br>
Heheh~ I'll tell you in just a moment~<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Enterprise：</span><br>
Every time you laugh like that, someone always finds themselves on the receiving end of one of your nasty pranks...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Saratoga：</span><br>
Thaaat's right~ I'll make sure they regret picking a fight with Miss Sara!<br>

{{折叠面板|标题=Sisterly Seminar II|选项=8|主框=1|样式=primary|展开=否}}
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Portland：</span><br>
Haah... I wonder what Indy is doing right now~<br>
I wonder if she's eating and sleeping well, and brushing her teeth on time every day~<br>
Ah! What if she's getting bullied because she's the quiet type?!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Atlanta：</span><br>
You're worrying too much... For how much you dote on her, you really ought to believe in her a bit more. She's not that weak, you know.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Portland：</span><br>
Ahh!! Does that mean she's grown up enough to fly away on her own? Indy, don't leave meee! Stay with your big sister forever~!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Atlanta：</span><br>
That's not even what I said... Ah, forget it. Every time I'm around you, I can't seem to stay serious... Portland, do you not get nervous at all?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Portland：</span><br>
Nervous? Sure I am. It's extremely important for us to maintain control of this strategic naval route. Even I understand that much.<br>
Only by controlling this island and its surrounding waters can we ensure the safety of our supply lines and the establishment of our forward operating base.<br>
We can't let this place fall no matter what, so of course I am nervous.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Atlanta：</span><br>
Words of such logic and clarity are flowing from Portland's mouth... pinch me...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Portland：</span><br>
But! In the face of my love for Indy, such nervousness is nothing more than dust in the wind!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Atlanta：</span><br>
Sigh... I thought you'd say that sooner or later...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Portland：</span><br>
Hehehe, my love for Indy is boundless!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Atlanta：</span><br>
Yes, yes. Boundless indeed. Let's keep moving forward - we're already approaching our target.<br>
{{折叠面板|内容结束}}

{{折叠面板|标题=Versus Light Carrier Ryuujou|选项=9|主框=1|样式=primary|展开=否}}
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ryuujou：</span><br>
So, you've finally come.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Atlanta：</span><br>
You've already called back all your planes in preparation for our attack...<br>
Hey, you know that you've been left for dead, right? And despite knowing that you're a decoy, you still have the will to fight?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ryuujou：</span><br>
Do you think you can shake my resolve with those words? Laughable. I knew about this long ago.<br>
If my sacrifice can bring victory to all my comrades, I will gladly go through hell for their sake!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Atlanta：</span><br>
... So this is the determination of the Sakura Empire.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Portland：</span><br>
Hmph! What's so impressive about that? If it's for Indy's sake, I would gladly set this entire world on fire!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Atlanta：</span><br>
... Can it, Portland...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ryuujou：</span><br>
I heard that the Union was a country of weaklings, but it seems that there are those who have true resolve.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Atlanta：</span><br>
...Wait, why are you two suddenly bonding over this?!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ryuujou：</span><br>
But!<br>
Even if I am abandoned, you will find that I am not so easily beaten!<br>
Listen up, warriors from the land of the free! I am Ryuujou, a ranger from the land of the rising sun!<br>
You'll have to beat me first before you can call me a decoy!<br>
Virtuous dragons, devour the enemies before us! Advance!<br>

{{折叠面板|标题=A Raging Battle Ensues, and then...|选项=10|主框=1|样式=primary|展开=否}}
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ryuujou：</span><br>
Ugh... so this is... all I could do...<br>
I suppose... even in defeat... I was able to be of some use to everyone...<br>
But next time... I definitely won't lose...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Portland：</span><br>
Is it over...?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Atlanta：</span><br>
The Sakura ships have begun to withdraw!<br>
Portland, are you all right?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Portland：</span><br>
Um... I think so. That was close~<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Atlanta：</span><br>
That's good then. Next, we should check in to see how Saratoga is doing-<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Shoukaku：</span><br>
So in the end, they took out Ryuujou...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Zuikaku：</span><br>
Curse them! If only we were there to fight them directly...!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Shoukaku：</span><br>
Zuikaku, orders are orders. All we can do is make sure that her sacrifices are not in vain.<br>
By landing a hit on that Grey Ghost, I suppose we've also partially avenged our unreliable seniors. Next, it's our turn to...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Zuikaku：</span><br>
Shoukaku, wait! I've just been alerted that Jintsuu's division has been intercepted by the enemy!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Shoukaku：</span><br>
What?!<br>
{{折叠面板|内容结束}}

{{折叠面板|标题=Onward to the Next Battle|选项=11|主框=1|样式=primary|展开=否}}
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Saratoga：</span><br>
Hehehe~ too naive! Did you think we'd fall for your little decoy?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Enterprise：</span><br>
Saratoga... just what are you doing...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Saratoga：</span><br>
Hehe, let Miss Sara break it down for you~<br>
If the Sakura Fleet plans to retake this island, there surely must also be an accompanying supply line...<br>
But Shoukaku and Zuikaku were nowhere to be found, and neither were Hiei and Kirishima. That could only mean...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Enterprise：</span><br>
I see... there's a separate force escorting the transport fleet...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Saratoga：</span><br>
Bingo~! As expected of my brightest pupil! Miss Sara is very proud of you!<br>
I contacted our allies to search the surrounding waters while Portland and the others tied Ryuujou down.<br>
And with that, I was able to capture their transport ships! If they were using a decoy in the first place, they were bound to be planning something like this.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Enterprise：</span><br>
Impressive. You managed to think that far ahead even while fighting the enemy?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Saratoga：</span><br>
Hehe~ it's fine to praise me more~♪<br>
Having that all said though, Enterprise was the one who drew the enemy's fire and gave us the time to develop this plan...<br>
From this standpoint, you share the same credit for successfully stopping our enemies in their tracks!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Enterprise：</span><br>
Thank you. If that is the case, then these wounds are well-earned.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Saratoga：</span><br>
Don't say that... your injuries are quite severe...<br>
Since the Sakura Fleet has already withdrawn, you should return to port and get some emergency repairs.<br>
Wasp and I will handle the rest, so don't worry!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Enterprise：</span><br>
Sorry for causing you trouble... I'll leave the rest to you then.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Saratoga：</span><br>
Although we managed to win a battle, the war isn't over yet, and the next battle will be even more difficult. We've got to keep our spirits up!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Enterprise：</span><br>
That's right... as long as both sides refuse to budge, this war will continue to rage on...<br>
