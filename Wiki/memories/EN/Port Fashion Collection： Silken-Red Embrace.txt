<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Chang Wu：</span><br>
The peach blossoms bloom... Just as spring has arrived, I've waited for your coming, too.<br>
In a warm, fragrant chamber, clad in a sheer white robe, Chang Wu gazes thoughtfully at a vase of newly blooming peach blossoms. Her silver hair cascades over her shoulders.<br>
With each moment, my hope has only grown.<br>
But I never dared to think that you would really come, Commander.<br>
I place a branch of red plum blossoms on the table. They contrast with the soft pink of the peach blossoms, highlighting each other's beauty in the light.<br>
Heehee. I see you brought a touch of spring, too... The elegance of plum blossoms makes the peach blossoms seem even softer.<br>
She props herself up and tugs at my sleeve, leading me to sit beside her. Under the warm light, the scent of the blossoms mingles with their shadows.<br>
Now that I've put the plum branch next to them, I can't help but feel like my carefully tended peach blossoms are missing something...<br>
What do you think, Commander?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">{playername}：</span><br>
They look beautiful to me, but...<br>
<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项1：The branches seem too dense...</span>'''''<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项2：The branches are a little long...</span>'''''<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">{playername}：</span><br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项1）</span>'''''The branches are a little dense right here.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Chang Wu：</span><br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项1）</span>'''''Following my gaze, she reaches out to touch the branches. They overlap so thickly there that the petals are hard to see.<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项1）</span>'''''You have a keen eye, Commander. It would be a pity to hide these beautiful flowers behind their own branches.<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项1）</span>'''''I understand logically that you can only preserve true beauty by removing the excess, and yet...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">{playername}：</span><br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项2）</span>'''''The branches are a little long, especially that one.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Chang Wu：</span><br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项2）</span>'''''Following my gaze, she places her fingers on the overgrown branch obscuring half of the blossoms.<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项2）</span>'''''You have a keen eye, Commander. I failed to accentuate the main branches, and the elegance was lost.<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项2）</span>'''''I understand logically that you can only preserve true beauty by removing the excess, and yet...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Chang Wu：</span><br>
When it comes to actually trimming them, I worry that I'll use too heavy a hand.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">{playername}：</span><br>
How about you point out the spots that need attention, and I'll do the trimming?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Chang Wu：</span><br>
Okay! Doing it together sounds best.<br>
Chang Wu places her hand on mine. Her fingertips are chilly, like the finest jade.<br>
Let's start... here.<br>
And then here...<br>
Hmm, I think you should cut it about... this much?<br>
You have a much gentler touch than I imagined.<br>
As the last superfluous branch falls, lamplight filters through the perfectly arranged blossoms, casting beautiful shadows on the nearby screen.<br>
These flowers normally bloom for seven days.<br>
But trimming is like carving jade... Only by sacrificing form for essence can one capture their true spirit.<br>
That is the ultimate way to cherish something.<br>
She holds a single peach blossom petal between her lips and falls into my arms.<br>
The robe slips down her shoulders, showing off more of her fair skin.<br>
What do you think is more beautiful in this moment, Commander? The peach blossoms, or...<br>
...The spring beauty in your arms?<br>
The light flickers, and the shadows on the screen melt into one another. Before long, it's impossible to distinguish where the flowers end and where the two of us begin.<br>

{{折叠面板|标题=Boudoir's Lingering Flame|选项=2|主框=1|样式=primary|展开=是}}
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Friedrich der Große：</span><br>
On one soft night, as the day's hustle and bustle gradually subsides, I visit Friedrich der Große's chamber. Soft light leaks out through her half-open door.<br>
She sits on her knees atop the bed with a meaningful smile on her face. Her dress, so thin that I can almost see through it, rises and falls in tune with her breathing.<br>
You've come, my child.<br>
I've heard that in the Dragon Empery, it is customary to give out red envelopes on special occasions.<br>
I prepared a special gift for you, my beloved child. However...<br>
If you want to have it, you'll need to be a little... bold.<br>
I've hidden it somewhere around me. Find it, and it's yours.<br>
Facing my gaze, she clasps her hands in front of her chest. Her eyes sparkle mischievously.<br>
Use your eyes, your fingers... and every other part of you to find it.<br>
I wonder where it could be? Heehee...<br>
Her voice bewitches me into playing her game – a game already decided by her whims.<br>
As I approach, she leans closer to me. My gaze wanders for a while before settling on the soft skin revealed by her neckline, but she seems unbothered by this.<br>
In that abyss lies a splash of red.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">{playername}：</span><br>
What's this I see?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Friedrich der Große：</span><br>
That's right, my child. It's right there... Why are you hesitating?<br>
Don't you think you'll need some courage and wisdom to obtain your treasure?<br>
I try to take it, but it remains nestled deep in her bosom. My fingertips alone aren't enough to pull it free.<br>
I look up at her face. She just smiles quietly, her eyes urging me to continue.<br>
What's the matter, my child? Why stop now?<br>
Don't tell me... Is this level of intimacy enough of a challenge to make you flinch?<br>
Come, my child... Listen to your heart and find your true desires.<br>
Let your desires guide you. Take what is yours, with your own hands.<br>
Soft light flickers in those eyes. I even spot a hint of anticipation.<br>
In that moment, I finally understand her true intentions.<br>
Without hesitating, I place one hand on her supple waist and easily seize my reward.<br>
The red envelope, bathed in her aroma and warmth, is finally in my hand.<br>
Well done... You've learned how to truly embrace your desires now.<br>
I'm proud of you, my sweet child.<br>
With a deep, captivating grin on her lips, she caresses my cheek.<br>
It seems I haven't just obtained the red envelope – I've been given silent consent to take another step further.<br>
Next, I'll guide you... to a more mature world.<br>
After producing a smooth red ribbon, she ties it around my wrist. Then...<br>
Relax, my child...<br>
The boldness you've displayed shows that you want more.<br>
I won't deprive my good child of even an ounce of my love.<br>
The fruits of tonight's intimacy are my reward for your growth.<br>
Don't worry. I'll teach you how to enjoy those fruits.<br>
She leans down, tracing her fingertips on my lips, and stops me before I can speak.<br>
Those burning fingers travel lower, sliding down my chest and beyond.<br>
<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项1：(Quietly allow her to continue.)</span>'''''<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项2：(Hold her hand in place.)</span>'''''<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Friedrich der Große：</span><br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项1）</span>'''''There's no more need for words, my child... I understand how you feel.<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项1）</span>'''''Close your eyes, now. Know that everything you're about to feel... is my gift to you.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Friedrich der Große：</span><br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项2）</span>'''''Heehee... There's no need to rush things. Let's feel the connection binding us first.<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项2）</span>'''''I feel the same way as you, my child...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Friedrich der Große：</span><br>
If you're not sure what to do, then surrender yourself to my embrace.<br>
Relax and lean on me, my child.<br>
Her breath brushes against my ear, carrying the sweet scent of wine.<br>
She tugs on the ribbon wrapped around my wrist, as if urging me to hold her around the waist.<br>
Heehee... You're eager, aren't you, my child?<br>
It's okay. I'll give you all of my love.<br>
Tonight... let's play a beautiful serenade together.<br>
This is only the beginning of Friedrich der Große's lecture on maturity.<br>
Clinging to reason while you drown in desire is what allows us to immerse ourselves in ecstasy.<br>
If you still yearn for anything, then speak... I won't refuse you, my child. I'll be even more eager to provide than you are to receive.<br>
Now, savor my teachings... my beloved child.<br>

{{折叠面板|标题=Aroma of Awakening|选项=3|主框=1|样式=primary|展开=是}}
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Hai Chou：</span><br>
On the gentle night breeze ride wisps of an exotic fragrance into my dreams, awakening me from my slumber.<br>
When I come to, I find myself still next to Hai Chou. She's bent over her desk, mixing something.<br>
Commander? Oh, did this fragrance awaken you?<br>
I'm just mixing a new perfume. I think I'll call it... Sublime Pleasure.<br>
Several bottles of perfume line the table, reflecting dreamlike colors in the soft moonlight.<br>
I've searched the world in pursuit of the best fragrances.<br>
The ones I have here are the fruits of my progress. Would you like to try them?<br>
She dabs some perfume on her neck and leans in close.<br>
As she comes closer, I become more aware of her breathing.<br>
This one is Breath of Spring, with the scent of spring rain and newly blossoming life.<br>
Would you like to feel the rain with me, Commander?<br>
Let's not rush things. This one is next.<br>
She gently shakes the next bottle, swirling the gleaming golden liquid within.<br>
Are you curious about what scent lies within this luxurious color? Well, I assure you my Golden Dew will live up to your expectations.<br>
After all, it's no simple fragrance. Its gold will unearth different scents depending on where it touches your skin.<br>
She takes my hand and pours a single drop onto my fingertip, then sniffs it.<br>
Hehe, how unique. In that case...<br>
I'm curious... what kind of scent will be revealed on me when this Golden Dew is warmed by your body heat?<br>
A few more drops fall into my palm. She then takes my hand and rubs it across her soft skin.<br>
Mmm... Your hands, your warmth, and this scent... It's all intoxicating.<br>
Maybe I've already found the true Sublime Pleasure that my heart desires.<br>
When our hearts beat as one and our essences melded together, I felt as if I'd touched upon the truth of Sublime Pleasure.<br>
At the same time... the sheer, shiver-inducing ecstasy from your fingers...<br>
The lingering sensation of our intermingling atop this red silk seems more vivid than ever.<br>
Commander... Is this Sublime Pleasure to you, too?<br>
In the clear moonlight, the fragrance on Hai Chou blooms before me.<br>
Something I've pursued for so long suddenly came within reach the moment I met you...<br>
If I had to describe this scent...<br>
I think I'd call it bliss.<br>
Commander, would you experience that intoxicating Sublime Pleasure with me once more?<br>
As I'm pulled into her embrace, the red silk stretches silently beneath us.<br>
Follow my lead, Commander... Did you catch a hint of that mesmerizing Sublime Pleasure?<br>
Come closer. Focus, now...<br>
Taste the sublime pleasure that is yours alone. The night is still young.<br>

<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Shinano ：</span><br>
As the night wears on, I make a stop at Shinano's room as promised.<br>
She lies languidly on her bed, holding a vessel of mysterious liquor that shines with an ethereal glow.<br>
Commander... This one has happened upon a wondrous libation. If we drink it together, our senses will be connected, allowing us to dream together.<br>
Thus, this one saved it for an auspicious night... to enjoy with you.<br>
She sits up to pour the liquor, but she suddenly stops – the vessel is already empty.<br>
Hazy eyes blink in confusion. Her fluffy fox tails sweep across the bed as she ponders her next move.<br>
While lost in thought... this one so carelessly drank the dream we were meant to share...<br>
What a pity...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">{playername}：</span><br>
It's okay. I'm sure you'll find more.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Shinano ：</span><br>
No... This one cannot give up on such precious liquor so quickly.<br>
Shinano leans forward and presses a finger to her lips, gazing at me with glazed eyes.<br>
Her tails sway behind her, wafting an enticing scent in my direction.<br>
Phew... Though the vessel is empty, this one still has some left...<br>
If you wish to know the taste... then come closer...<br>
Let us share this dream, if only for an instant...<br>
I lean closer. As soon as I bend down, I'm embraced by her aroma.<br>
Her breath brushes my cheek – refreshing, sweet, gentle, and warm, all at the same time.<br>
When the distance between us is closed, a strange warmth radiates from my lips.<br>
The world around me turns soft and hazy. I feel as if I'm sinking deep into warm water.<br>
Do you feel it? Our heartbeats becoming one...<br>
The sensation... That sweetness melting into your tongue...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">{playername}：</span><br>
It's like honey, or... like a dream.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Shinano ：</span><br>
This is just the beginning...<br>
She guides my hand to her chest. The wonderful rhythm within gradually synchronizes with my pulse.<br>
Listen... Our rhythms have become one...<br>
Through countless dreams has this one wandered... Yet this moment of connection feels the most real of all.<br>
Our lips touch once again. The scent of liquor mingles with our breath, lighting a silent flame in our hearts.<br>
Ah... Your breath is like a hot current rushing through this one's being...<br>
There is no need for words, no need for thoughts... Only feelings. Feel me as this one feels you...<br>
Shinano's tails wrap around my wrist. Their softness sends sweet shivers coursing through my body.<br>
Her fingertips graze my cheek, a paradox of cold against my hot skin.<br>
Is this lingering flavor enough to quench your thirst...? If you wish for more... this one can provide what you desire...<br>
Her embrace is soft, tantalizing, and leaves me wanting. The tipsiness from the liquor has faded, only to be replaced by a more primal intoxication.<br>
I hear nothing but our shared heartbeat, and I taste nothing but her sweet breath.<br>
When our lips meet once more, we are both engulfed in a soft, blue light. The last thing I hear is her hazy murmur.<br>
May this dream never end...<br>
