Sardegna Empire - World Expo Venue<br>
Closing Day<br>
Colorful flags flutter in the breeze as I walked through the venue on this pleasant day.<br>
I can hear the uplifting fanfare of a band as I approach the Colosseum's entrance.<br>
The closing ceremony is about to start, and people are starting to gather from all over.<br>
The excitement from the clamorous crowd is almost palpable from every corner of the Colosseum.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Memphis：</span><br>
You can really see why they call it the World Expo...<br>
Things were pretty quiet the last few days, so it totally slipped my mind how massive this event is.<br>
Even I feel like I'm about to get swept away by the excitement.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Helena：</span><br>
Heehee. I rarely get to see you this bubbly, Memphis.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Memphis：</span><br>
I mean, all of our friends are here having fun. How could I not get into the festive mood?<br>
By the way, think we should grab some souvenirs before the Expo closes?<br>
Her Holiness Marco Polo will be speaking during the ceremony, so we'll want to hang on to every word.<br>
<br>
"...Her Holiness?"<br>
"Do the people here normally call her that?"<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Helena：</span><br>
You noticed as well, Commander?<br>
Everyone here, including Memphis... seems a little too excited, don't you think?<br>
<br>
I quickly scan my eyes across the crowd in front of me. It's true– everyone seems a lot more fired up than normal. It almost verges on... fanatical.<br>
I can't exactly put my finger on it, but it's almost as if.. the over-the-top energy is hiding something sinister underneath...<br>
"Something weird is going on. It may be the World Expo, but even then—"<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Memphis：</span><br>
Um? Commander, what's gotten into you?<br>
Calling it weird is just rude. Her Holiness is going to appear today, so of course we're fired up.<br>
Now let's hurry and get those souvenirs before they sell out. C'mon!<br>
<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项1：(Yeah, something's definitely not right here...)</span>'''''<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项2：(What's all this about "Her Holiness" Marco Polo...?)</span>'''''<br>
<br>
During the closing ceremony, Marco Polo arrives at the Colosseum to deliver a speech.<br>
Before I knew it, the three of us had taken our seats in the stands, Memphis's hands full of souvenirs.<br>
............<br>
"Wait, when did we come in here?"<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Marco Polo：</span><br>
Thank you all for gathering here today.<br>
I am Marco Polo of Sardegna.<br>
But... I am also God's envoy to this land.<br>
Oh, what a joyous day it is!<br>
We no longer need to fight amongst ourselves.<br>
We no longer need to fear the Sirens!<br>
The order of the world has been overturned! Your supreme God has descended upon the world!<br>
As of now, we reside in the His heavenly kingdom.<br>
Rejoice! All who have gathered here may equally witness His joy!<br>
Celebrate eternal peace!<br>
Celebrate the coming of a new age!<br>
Celebrate the glory of Sardegna!<br>
Celebrate Marco Polo!<br>
Celebrate God!<br>
<br>
Despite the absurdity of her speech, the entire venue erupts in uproarious, endless applause.<br>
The raw enthusiasm seems to fill earth, sea, and sky, swelling to an eerie degree.<br>
<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项1："I don't know what's going on here, but we need to put a stop to this!"</span>'''''<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项2：(Wait and see.)</span>'''''<br>
<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项1）</span>'''''(This doesn't make any sense... People aren't behaving the way they normally would!)<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项1）</span>'''''I quickly snatch Memphis's communicator away from her and connect it to the amplifier on her rigging.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Marco Polo：</span><br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项1）</span>'''''Huh? H-how did you...<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项1）</span>'''''N-no, stop! This is—<br>
<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项1）</span>'''''With her speech interrupted, Marco Polo suddenly begins to panic.<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项1）</span>'''''I can tell she knows exactly what's going on.<br>
<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项2）</span>'''''I look around and see Memphis and Helena in rapturous applause.<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项2）</span>'''''(Something is wrong. Whatever it is, everyone is under some influence.)<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项2）</span>'''''(It's too soon to act, though. I should gather as much information as I can first.)<br>
<br>
But why is it so hard to keep my eyes open...?<br>
Everything's starting... to go black...<br>
{{折叠面板|内容结束}}

{{折叠面板|标题=The Sign of Judgment|选项=3|主框=1|样式=primary|展开=是}}
<br>
A black sun, quietly burning in the dusky sky.<br>
I was just in the Colosseum, but before I knew it, the world around me had changed.<br>
"Where am I...?"<br>
Is this a dream... or a projection of my consciousness?<br>
It almost reminds me... of the Reality Lens...<br>
<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项1：That black sun...</span>'''''<br>
<br>
Judging by the black sun, this at least didn't seem to be the real world I knew.<br>
This is all too realistic for a dream, but so was the Colosseum from before.<br>
Though, if nothing else, it at least doesn't look threatening.<br>
I don't feel any heat from the black sun. It's simply just... there.<br>
<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项1：(Take a closer look.)</span>'''''<br>
<br>
I stare deeply into the black sun's depths.<br>
It takes a while for my eyes to adjust and focus, but eventually... something starts to come into view.<br>
<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项1：Is it... some kind of machine?</span>'''''<br>
<br>
I can't see clearly, but is it possible that there's some sort of massive machine inside the black sun?<br>
What I see is only a small part of it, like the tip of an iceberg, concealing something so massive that it doesn't seem to be able to fit within this world.<br>
The realization sends goosebumps down my body, a sickening electric sensation creeping through my body.<br>
Pressure. Darkness.<br>
As if I'm at the bottom of an ocean... in a bygone era I don't belong to...<br>
<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项1：It feels... so hard to breathe...</span>'''''<br>
<br>
This place is completely different from the silent, almost serene roiling of the black sun in the sky...<br>
At this rate... I'm going to suffocate...<br>
Just as I feel my consciousness about to slip away from me...<br>
Am I hearing... windchimes?<br>
{{折叠面板|内容结束}}

{{折叠面板|标题=Encounter in a Dream|选项=4|主框=1|样式=primary|展开=是}}
<br>
I hear windchimes by my ear. Wind. A breath of fresh air, pulling me away from the depths.<br>
The suffocating feeling disappeared, and this time, I woke up in a peculiar space.<br>
<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项1：Is this...</span>'''''<br>
<br>
Beneath a dark sky, I see brightly-colored torii gates stretching into the distance in front of me.<br>
The wind seems to come from both sides, sending waves crashing into each other.<br>
When I look up, I see inverted castles and pavilions hanging upside-down, like projected mirages.<br>
<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项1：...another dream?</span>'''''<br>
<br>
The vast city above me almost makes me wonder if I'm the one who's upside-down.<br>
I look more closely at what seems to be hidden behind the mirage-like structures and clouds, and a sense of déjà vu washes over me.<br>
Just like with the black sun, I seem to perceive something imperceptible, a tip of an iceberg to something not of this world, something far larger than me.<br>
............<br>
<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项1：Wait, is that someone underneath the torii gate?</span>'''''<br>
<br>
I see a strange yet familiar figure, clad in black and red.<br>
She starts to turn around, seemingly having noticed my gaze.<br>
I can't see her face, or any discernable patterns on her clothes.<br>
But, a sense of nostalgia keeps seems to well up inside me.<br>
I try to call out to her, but she's gone before I can utter even a word.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Shinano ：</span><br>
Who goes there...?<br>
<br>
From behind me comes a voice I know well.<br>
<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项1：Shinano...</span>'''''<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项2："This is a dream, right...?"</span>'''''<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Shinano ：</span><br>
So it is you...<br>
That this one would see you again in my dreams... Fate works in mysterious ways.<br>
<br>
"Do you know who that person over there was? The one wearing black-and-red?"<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Shinano ：</span><br>
A person wearing black and red? I apologize, but this one has seen no such thing...<br>
You would be the first person this one has found in this world...<br>
<br>
Shinano knew many dream worlds, but even she didn't see everything that happened in all of them... Naturally, since they were dreams.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Shinano ：</span><br>
Indeed, this dream is a gap between dreams... A connection between fiction and reality...<br>
It is a second hometown to this one, away from the real world...<br>
When visiting dreams, this one occasionally stops here along the way...<br>
However, this dream comes at an inconvenient time...<br>
This one will miss the World Expo's closing ceremony...<br>
<br>
"So you're saying... You fell asleep right before the closing ceremony?"<br>
"I heard you were here to represent the Sakura Empire. That is unfortunate..."<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Shinano ：</span><br>
Have you come to the World Expo, too...?<br>
Oh, how delightful it is that the real Commander has appeared in this one's dreams...<br>
<br>
"Now that I think about it, it's uncanny that I'm in your dream. Especially if neither of us is a figment of the other's imagination."<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Shinano ：</span><br>
This one did not expect to dream your dream, rather than dreaming of you...<br>
We have met a few times now, but this is the first time that this one can be certain...<br>
How exciting it is...<br>
<br>
Shinano, aircraft carrier of the Sakura Empire. She has a mysterious power that allowed her to dream of all realities.<br>
Long ago, when I was trapped with Archerfish in a Mirror Sea, Shinano had saved us.<br>
Until that point, she'd considered her dreams as simple precognition or potential futures. That incident had changed her perspective on it, though.<br>
"If you have this dream often, then maybe it's more than just a dream."<br>
"The upside-down city, that mysterious machine in the distance, the black sun..."<br>
"And I keep hearing these strange windchimes—"<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Shinano ：</span><br>
This one has heard the chimes, as well...<br>
However, it does not happen with every dream. Only with some...<br>
It seems that they are a guide within the world of dreams...<br>
Follow the sound, and you may have unusual dreams...<br>
This one often hears them when trying to escape nightmares.<br>
However, they do not always lead one to good dreams... Just yesterday, this one dreamed of something terrifying.<br>
The windchimes led this one to a world... overhung by a golden sky and black sun...<br>
A sun that burned without heat, like a black hole that chilled the observer...<br>
<br>
"You dreamed of the black sun, too?!"<br>
"Here's everything that happened until now..."<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Shinano ：</span><br>
This one was not the only one to dream of the black sun...?<br>
Though it is a dream, the fact that it haunts more than this one means that it cannot be taken lightly.<br>
When dreaming of the black sun, this one heard someone else's voice...<br>
Hmm... Alas, this one cannot remember well.<br>
After dreaming in the early morning... this one had abruptly fallen into the dream of the black sun...<br>
This one did not dream in between, and yet my memories...<br>
And you say... that you suddenly found yourself dreaming, too...<br>
<br>
"Likewise, I don't have any vivid memories after early this morning."<br>
"I left the Eagle Union pavilion with the others, and we were on our way to the Colosseum... and that's it."<br>
"That is, assuming that speech I saw was just a dream, too."<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Shinano ：</span><br>
You and this one are alike...<br>
This one hopes it was only a dream... but if it is a potential reality, then it may be disastrous...<br>
<br>
"In other words, we need to do everything we can to keep it from becoming reality."<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Shinano ：</span><br>
Once you awaken from this dream we share...<br>
<br>
I heard the windchimes again.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Shinano ：</span><br>
Could this be... the sound that leads one to awakening?<br>
Commander, we must speak again in the real world... at the World Expo venue.<br>
Call this number—<br>

Sardegna Empire - World Expo Venue<br>
Closing Day<br>
Colorful flags flutter in the breeze as I walked through the venue on this pleasant day.<br>
I can hear the uplifting fanfare of a band as I approach the Colosseum's entrance.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Memphis：</span><br>
You can really see why they call it the World Expo...<br>
Things were pretty quiet the last few days, so it totally slipped my mind how massive this event is.<br>
Even I feel like I'm about to get swept away by the excitement.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Helena：</span><br>
Heehee. I rarely get to see you this bubbly, Memphis.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Memphis：</span><br>
I mean, all of our friends are here having fun. How could I not get into the festive mood?<br>
<br>
Familiar sights, familiar conversations. But, with one key difference–<br>
<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项1：This is no dream.</span>'''''<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Memphis：</span><br>
...Hm? Commander, you don't look too good. Are you feeling sick?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Helena：</span><br>
Commander? Are you okay?!<br>
<br>
"Physically, I'm fine. But I have to do something about what I saw in that dream."<br>
"Memphis, you wanted to shop for souvenirs before the closing ceremony?"<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Memphis：</span><br>
...Yeah. How did you know?!<br>
<br>
Normally, people would think you're crazy if you tried to tell them that you saw something in a dream and needed to prevent it in real life.<br>
Given the situation, though, I had no choice but to give them a quick and dirty explanation.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Memphis：</span><br>
Okay, I'm lost. Commander, what are you going on about?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Helena：</span><br>
You really do look sick... I'll call for a medic right away!<br>
<br>
They're used to supporting me, so it's going to be hard to convince them.<br>
In that case, I'll have to bring a witness to the stand.<br>
<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项1："Let's go talk to Shinano."</span>'''''<br>
<br>
I informed them of the change of plans and devised the quickest route to the Sakura Empire pavilion.<br>
Meanwhile, I called Essex and directed her to prepare the Eagle Union fleet for battle.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Memphis：</span><br>
C-Commander, what's gotten into you?! We can go to the Sakura Empire pavilion, but why are we preparing for battle?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Helena：</span><br>
Were you... serious about that stuff you told us?<br>
<br>
"Of course I was."<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Memphis：</span><br>
...I trust you. If danger is coming, then I'll help out!<br>
<br>
I led Memphis and Helena through the crowd and toward the Sakura Empire pavilion—<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Suruga：</span><br>
Argh! You'd better not run off on your own anymore!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Shimakaze：</span><br>
I'm sorry, Suruga! I didn't think I'd get lost here...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Alfredo Oriani：</span><br>
Things do get pretty crowded on closing day. I wouldn't blame her too much for getting lost!<br>
Now, how about I show you two to the Sakura Empire pavilion's VIP area!<br>
I cultivated knowledge of this place through my reporting, so I'll get you there in no time!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Suruga：</span><br>
*sigh*... I'm sorry for taking up your time, Alfredo.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Shimakaze：</span><br>
Ahahaha... Thanks for your help, friend!<br>
<br>
"Sardegnian staff are showing the Sakura Empire shipgirls around."<br>
"Shinano is likely to be in the VIP area. Let's follow them."<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Memphis：</span><br>
That's fine, but do we have to be all secretive about this?<br>
They might be with the Crimson Axis, but I'm sure they'll let you see her if you just ask.<br>
<br>
"I have my reasons. There's no time to explain right now."<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Memphis：</span><br>
I dunno about this... She won't think we're weird?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Helena：</span><br>
Don't worry, Memphis. The Commander and Shinano have met in dreams.<br>
<br>
Helena was there during the Archerfish incident, so she backed me up.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Memphis：</span><br>
I-I see...<br>
Then let's go—<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Helena：</span><br>
Commander, watch out!<br>
<br>
It happened without warning.<br>
An enormous machine fell from the sky, obliterating the building in front of us with its pure mass.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Helena：</span><br>
Wh-what is that?!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Memphis：</span><br>
Helena, secure an evacuation route right away!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Helena：</span><br>
Right...!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Memphis：</span><br>
Commander, are you okay?! Stay with us!<br>
<br>
"I inhaled some smoke from the building collapse, but I'm just fine."<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Memphis：</span><br>
Phew...<br>
This is a message to all shipgirls on duty! Code Black! Secure the safety of important personnel!<br>
Repeating! Code Black!<br>

<br>
World Expo Venue<br>
BOOOOM!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Shimakaze：</span><br>
Woooaaaoooooaah––!! Phew, that was a close one... Suruga, are you okay?!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Suruga：</span><br>
Yeah. I just barely managed to get out of the way...<br>
Wait, what is that?! Where did it come from?!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Alfredo Oriani：</span><br>
Waaaaargh?! The pavilion's been blown to smithereens!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Shimakaze：</span><br>
Alfredo, please stay calm!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Alfredo Oriani：</span><br>
R-right! Stay calm, stay calm... This is the perfect opportunity for a photo!<br>
<br>
*click*!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Alfredo Oriani：</span><br>
I have no idea what just happened, but a journalist has to be ready to snap pics of every calamity as it happens!<br>
Sakura Empire VIPs, please evacuate! I'll handle the situation here!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Shimakaze：</span><br>
I'll fight, too! Your chances are a lot better with a partner!<br>
Suruga, hurry over to Shinano! I'll take care—hey, ow!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Suruga：</span><br>
What are you fools thinking?! You can't win against that thing!<br>
<br>
Exasperated or furious, Suruga lifted up both of them and jumped away.<br>
Almost instantly, a massive mechanical leg crushed down on the spot they had occupied a moment ago.<br>
In this chaos, it was impossible to get a grasp of the situation, let alone mount a counterattack.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Memphis：</span><br>
Commander? Why'd you stop running?<br>
<br>
"It's more important that I ensure everyone else can evacuate first."<br>
<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项1："Prepare to launch aerial support."</span>'''''<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Memphis：</span><br>
Got it. We'll handle communications.<br>
Helena, send the coordinates of that big guy to Essex!<br>
And let the people evacuating know that help is on its way!<br>
Alfredo, Shimakaze, Suruga! Hurry this way!<br>
<br>
BOOOOM!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Shimakaze：</span><br>
Thank you, Commander! And you Eagle Union folk, too!<br>
Suruga, Alfredo! We're saved!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Suruga：</span><br>
Th-thank you very much...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Alfredo Oriani：</span><br>
Roger! We'd love some backup right now! We'll join up with them!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Suruga：</span><br>
(Right... For the time being, we have to focus on getting through this predicament!)<br>

<br>
Shortly after...<br>
World Expo Venue - Eagle Union Pavilion<br>
Underground Emergency Shelter<br>
Thanks to the air support, we managed to evacuate into the underground shelter.<br>
At first, I had my doubts about why an emergency shelter would be set up in such a conspicuous location.<br>
But as the elevator took us deeper and deeper underground, the situation became completely clear.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Essex：</span><br>
Sealing blast door... And done.<br>
We're safe now, Commander.<br>
<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项1："So, this emergency shelter... Was it set up because..."</span>'''''<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Essex：</span><br>
Yes, that's right.<br>
As soon as we heard that you were on your way, Saratoga was adamant about beefing up our security, just in case.<br>
This place isn't as nice as it could be if we had a few more days, but we can't take anything for granted when it comes to your safety.<br>
Having all that said, I never actually expected it to come into play like this.<br>
<br>
"Do the other factions know about this?"<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Essex：</span><br>
No, we keep it a secret from the other factions. On paper, it's only a safehouse where we store valuables and materials.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Memphis：</span><br>
*sigh*... Saratoga's been keeping secrets from me again.<br>
Still, I have to admit that she's really outdone herself this time.<br>
As far as I can tell, this place has the materials for communication and battle command. Why don't we make this our temporary base?<br>
<br>
"We've secured a safehouse. Our next urgent matter is to figure out the situation."<br>
"Let's test communications to other bases and summarize the situation in the venue."<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Helena：</span><br>
I can't get in touch with NY City or New Jersey's fleet in the NA Ocean.<br>
But it's weird... The communication signal is coming in strange.<br>
It's not like we're being jammed. It's more like... it can't find who I'm trying to communicate with.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Essex：</span><br>
Likewise. It's like any communications going out of the venue can't reach their target...<br>
Communications in and around the venue seem to be going smoothly, so we at least have a grasp of the situation.<br>
But we have no idea what's going on at any of the outside bases.<br>
Helena is right; our signal isn't even being jammed, and this is still happening.<br>
Oh! We have a report on the forces around the venue.<br>
Things... aren't looking so good right now.<br>
<br>
Essex handed me a handheld monitor as a visual aid.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Essex：</span><br>
This marked spot is the Eagle Union pavilion. Of course, that's where we are.<br>
Our forces are focused in this underground shelter. For the moment, we're safe.<br>
The Colosseum, the pavilion where the closing ceremony was held, was completely leveled by the initial attack.<br>
Meanwhile, we've got ten of those massive mechanical eyeballs wreaking havoc across the venues. We'll call them Gazers for now–<br>
Our carrier-based aircraft haven't had any success trying to break through with bombs, and we're still in the process of gathering more information.<br>
Also, here's the situation with the Royal Navy and Iris Libre.<br>
Their pavilions were also heavily damaged by the attack, so they plan to gather their fleet and evacuate towards Malta.<br>
As for the other factions...<br>
The Sardegnian Fleet is regrouping around the only pavilion they have left, and are planning to launch a counterattack.<br>
The Sakura Empire is also buckling down to defend their pavilion, and has already warded off one wave of attacks.<br>
The Dragon Empery... Hmm. Their pavilion doesn't appear to have been damaged, and none of their personnel appear to be on site.<br>
On the other hand, the Northern Parliament's pavilion was completely destroyed, and we do not know the status of any of their shipgirls.<br>
Intense fighting has been seen near the locations of the Iron Blood and Vichya Dominion pavilions.<br>
Though we aren't able to monitor everything in real time, it appears that several blueprint ships have been deployed and are currently holding the lines.<br>
...That summarizes the situation as it stands.<br>
Per your orders, Commander, we will continue to gather information and attempt to contact the other factions!<br>
<br>
.........<br>
<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项1："Thank you for your work."</span>'''''<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项2："Well done, Essex!"</span>'''''<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Essex：</span><br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项1）</span>'''''Don't mention it. We're just following your orders.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Essex：</span><br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项2）</span>'''''Ahaha... Well, I'm still nothing compared to Enterprise...<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项2）</span>'''''Ahem! I'm only following orders to the best of my ability.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Memphis：</span><br>
It's pretty hard to be optimistic about this situation...<br>
<br>
Even the host, the Sardegna Empire, couldn't predict this attack.<br>
The abruptness of it prevented anyone from mounting an effective counterattack.<br>
Our unknown enemy's power is unknowable, but it's clear that we're not getting out of this situation unless we work together.<br>
At this rate, we'll only go down one by one. Instead, we should—<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Communicator：</span><br>
BEEP—<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Illustrious：</span><br>
Finally, the comms are starting to clear up again. Ahem... This is Illustrious, Royal Navy aircraft carrier, speaking.<br>
The Royal Navy and Iris Libre fleets have gathered in the waters southeast of the World Expo venue.<br>
As I'm sure you have seen, an unknown enemy has literally dropped out of the sky and is ripping through our defenses as we speak.<br>
In order to defeat this enemy, our fleets have temporarily evacuated to Malta in order to reorganize our forces and plan a counterattack.<br>
All ships who can hear us, we implore you to come and join forces with us.<br>
Our fleets plan to strike forth in one hour.<br>
Until this situation is resolved, the Royal Navy welcomes all factions at our Malta base.<br>
We hope you will join us.<br>
Repeating. This is Illustrious, Royal Navy aircraft carrier, speaking...<br>
<br>
I take note of their positions through the monitor.<br>
Joining forces sounds lovely, but what if the Gazers attack us? Will we make it to Malta in one piece?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Shangri-La：</span><br>
Commander, we've received a message directly from Illustrious. She says that, per her broadcast, she wishes to join forces.<br>
She believes that with the extra firepower of the Eagle Union fleet, it would be possible to break through.<br>
What do you think? Should we join up with them at Malta?<br>
<br>
"The idea on paper sounds good. We obviously want to consolidate our forces as much as possible."<br>
"Unfortunately, gathering outside the pavilion only makes us easy targets. Given the lack of information, trying to throw together a hasty evacuation could prove more disastrous than just trying to weather the storm."<br>
"We'll look into Malta, but for now, we'll set our own meeting point and route."<br>
"Shangri-La, pass all of that on to Illustrious for me, please."<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Shangri-La：</span><br>
Understood.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Suruga：</span><br>
Commander, I've just received word from Shinano.<br>
She says... that she'd like to speak with you in person.<br>
<br>
I can see the doubt all over Suruga's face as she hands me the communicator.<br>
Maybe Shinano told her about the dream...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Shinano ：</span><br>
This one rejoices over your safety, Commander...<br>
<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项1："Is the Sakura Empire fleet okay?"</span>'''''<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项2："Are you okay, Shinano?"</span>'''''<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Shinano ：</span><br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项1）</span>'''''Do not worry about us... We're holding up fine.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Shinano ：</span><br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项2）</span>'''''Thank you for your concern... This one is safe in the pavilion...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Shinano ：</span><br>
After we parted, this one made some preparations ahead of time... We were fortunately not taken unawares.<br>
However, we cannot meet with the enemy in the venue...<br>
This one... wishes to ask for your opinion.<br>
Could this have all happened because of our attempts to stop the dream from coming to fruition...?<br>
If we had only waited and watched as zealotry took over, would things have remained peaceful...?<br>
How will you overcome this difficulty...?<br>
<br>
"I don't know the cause, but now that enemies have shown up, we'll just have to join forces and fight them off."<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Shinano ：</span><br>
Gathering all of the shipgirls to fight by your side... A wise choice...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Communicator：</span><br>
In that case, there's a better place to gather than the Eagle Union shelter.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Memphis：</span><br>
Eavesdropping through our communication lines?!<br>
Who's there?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Prinz Eugen：</span><br>
Sorry, sorry. I forgot to turn off my disguise. Prinz Eugen, Iron Blood.<br>
I've been listening since the Commander took charge.<br>
Our side agrees with joining forces.<br>
Fighting scattered battles in a mad dash to escape sounds like an easy way to get yourself killed.<br>
As for where to meet up, though, I'd suggest the Vichya pavilion.<br>
You know all about the secret weapons in each pavilion, don't you, Commander? Well, did you know that the Vichya has a functional Skybound Wall installed?<br>
They most likely did it only to brag about their technology, of course, but it still provides us with a solid line of defense.<br>
Your shelter might be sturdy and a good option for keeping you safe, but it's hardly suitable for deploying a large number of shipgirls.<br>
The Vichya's facility is big and it's located on solid ground, so you can fight back with ease.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Kersaint：</span><br>
This is Kersaint, from the Vichya Dominion. We've managed to deploy the Skybound Wall without issue.<br>
Everyone is welcome, so please come if you so desire.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Prinz Eugen：</span><br>
There you have it. How about it, Commander? It seems like the ideal move to me.<br>
<br>
"You're right. Moving to the Vichya pavilion seems worthwhile, but..."<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Prinz Eugen：</span><br>
Are you still worried about me cutting into your conversation? Sorry about that, really. As you can all imagine, I've been listening in to all communications throughout the venue.<br>
Though I'm sure the Eagle Union, and everyone else at that, are doing the same thing.<br>
I was just able to interrupt your conversation because our technology is better.<br>
Anyway, Commander, are you ready to give me an answer yet?<br>
<br>
"There are a lot of things I'm unsure of—how reliable the Skybound Wall is, how prepared the communication equipment is, how sturdy the facility itself is..."<br>
"But it sounds like the benefits outweigh the risks."<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Essex：</span><br>
I believe in your leadership, Commander.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Shangri-La：</span><br>
Agreed. The World Expo is a place for us to put aside our differences and come together, after all.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Memphis：</span><br>
It doesn't really make a difference which faction takes the lead, huh?<br>
<br>
"There you have it. Eugen, we agree."<br>
"One more thing. I need you to share any and all information the Iron Blood has on the status of other factions."<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Prinz Eugen：</span><br>
Oh, you wanna know?<br>
Our info on Sardegna is the same as yours. Their facility defense is top-notch.<br>
They've decided to gather at the Vichya pavilion, and the Iron Blood will see to it that they make it there safe.<br>
As for the Northern Parliament... They tried to evacuate from the venue in an attempt to meet up with the Royal Navy fleet.<br>
But on your orders, they've turned back this way.<br>
They'll join up with you soon, so make sure you look after them, Commander.<br>
The Dragon Empery... Well, they left days ago, so they're long gone.<br>
Looks like they got lucky this time, heheh.<br>
That's all I've got. Will that do?<br>
<br>
"We can discuss the details later, but for now, thank you for sharing."<br>
"Sardegna will go with Iron Blood, and we'll meet with the Northern Parliament... The Sakura Empire is doing fine in battle, so they should have no problem going to the Vichya pavilion on their own."<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Shinano ：</span><br>
Please take good care of Suruga and Shimakaze for the time being... Goodbye...<br>
<br>
"Stay safe out there. We'll meet again at the Vichya pavilion."<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Essex：</span><br>
Commander, the Northern Parliament has safely arrived in nearby seas.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Avrora：</span><br>
It's good to see you safe and sound, Commander~<br>
We were going to meet with the Royal Navy fleet due to the buggy communication lines, but...<br>
Now that communications with you have been restored, we'll obey your orders.<br>
Oh, and there's something I wanted to discuss with you...<br>
Several of those large enemies are heading for the Union pavilion. It won't be long until you're in danger.<br>
Even our combined fleets may not be able to fight them off, so I still think the best course of action would be to retreat for now.<br>
The Northern Parliament pavilion is in tatters. If you're searching for another base—<br>
<br>
"We actually already anticipated that. We'll be regrouping at the Vichya pavilion."<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Avrora：</span><br>
Excellent, I'm glad we're all on the same page, then – both Crimson Axis and Azur Lane.<br>
<br>
"None of that matters under these conditions."<br>
"As Commander, it's my duty to bring all of the factions together and rout the enemies that have destroyed our celebration of peace."<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Avrora：</span><br>
Heehee, I expected no less from you, Commander. See you later~<br>
<br>
"Now, if we can just get a reply from the Royal Navy and Iris Libre..."<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Illustrious：</span><br>
We understand the situation, Commander. The Royal Navy will travel to the designated point.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Jeanne d'Arc：</span><br>
The Iris Libre fleet will accompany you, too. May the Holy Iris guide you...<br>
<br>
"Phew... Looks like we've managed to get everyone to agree to cooperate."<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Shimakaze：</span><br>
W-wow... I can't believe how quickly you got everyone on the same page even though they were all doing their own things!<br>
That's my Commander for you!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Suruga：</span><br>
(Shush! Not so loud when the Commander's trying to focus!)<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Shimakaze：</span><br>
Whoopsie! Sorry!<br>
<br>
Not that I mind, though. Shimakaze's carefree spirit can certainly be a breath of fresh air.<br>
"Regardless, we've only managed to organize things somewhat. We still haven't turned things around."<br>
"The enemy's identity, their motive for attacking us, and their weakness... There are still too many unknowns."<br>
"Once everyone has gathered, that's when the real trouble begins."<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Alfredo Oriani：</span><br>
Ooh! There's our Commander! Love that profile!<br>
<br>
*click*!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Alfredo Oriani：</span><br>
"Commander Unites Warring Factions in the Midst of Danger!" Yeah, now that's a head-turner!<br>

<br>
Sometime later...<br>
World Expo - Vichya Dominion Pavilion<br>
Nearby waters<br>
After a few outbreaks of fierce fighting against drone-like enemies, we arrived safely in front of the Vichya Dominion's pavilion.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Foch：</span><br>
Looks like that's everyone, Joffre!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Joffre：</span><br>
Activate the eastern Skybound Wall! Maximum output!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">L'Indomptable：</span><br>
Incoming! Prepare for impact!<br>
<br>
KABOOOM!<br>
A Gazer rammed into the Skybound Wall, causing the light to ripple violently. However, the wall still managed to hold.<br>
As if accepting that it would not be able to break through, the massive machine drifted off in a different direction.<br>
While I was running some numbers to estimate the defensive capacity of the Skybound Wall, everyone around me could finally let out a sigh of relief.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Kersaint：</span><br>
W-we'll be fine. The Skybound Wall should have no issues withstanding most attacks.<br>
I suppose we're safe, now that the eyeball thing is gone?<br>
It seems like they won't attack us unless we launch an attack on them first.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Suffren：</span><br>
Even I, in all my wisdom, can't figure out what they're trying to achieve.<br>
They seem to be more focused on causing as much destruction as possible rather than attacking us.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Guichen：</span><br>
By the way, are we calling these giant machines "Gazers?" They do look a bit like those monsters, straight out of books and movies.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Kersaint：</span><br>
I, I don't want to look at those things anymore... O Holy Iris, please give me the strength to overcome this trial!<br>
S-sorry, I need to get a hold of myself! I can't be freaking out in front of the Commander...!<br>
<br>
Kersaint led us deeper into the pavilion until we arrived at a conference room.<br>
Veneto, Prinz Eugen, Shinano... Shipgirls from every faction were sitting around a large table.<br>
Despite the crisis we are in, just seeing all of them together reminds me of the hope in the air during the World Expo.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Shinano ：</span><br>
Commander...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Prinz Eugen：</span><br>
Long time no see, Commander.<br>
How long has it been since we met face to face, I wonder? Heehee.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Vittorio Veneto：</span><br>
Welcome to the Sardegna Empire, Commander.<br>
Sadly, this is nothing like how I thought we would meet...<br>
<br>
Two leaders from guest factions, and the leader of the hosting one.<br>
Though Eugen and Shinano did not seem particularly distraught, the same could not be said for Veneto.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Vittorio Veneto：</span><br>
I thought you would at least get to enjoy the closing ceremony, and instead you got swept up in a disaster.<br>
As the Sardegnian representative, I am deeply sorry.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Prinz Eugen：</span><br>
I know it's shameful, Veneto, but let's leave it there.<br>
You couldn't possibly have predicted this. The more pressing matter is what we do from here.<br>
Here's an idea – how about we capture one of those Gazers and take the opportunity to study them? Who knows, we might even be able to produce our own in the future~<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Vittorio Veneto：</span><br>
While I appreciate your sentiment, please understand the gravity of this situation.<br>
Given their numbers, combat capabilities, and our lack of information... I do not think this is a battle we can take, even were we to all work together.<br>
We must gather every shipgirl in the Sardegna Empire in order to fight these foes.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Bolzano：</span><br>
If I may interject... We still have yet to reestablish communication with anyone beyond these waters.<br>
Both Taranto and Rome are completely in the dark about our situation.<br>
In the worst-case scenario, they may even be fighting Gazers on the Sardegnian mainland as we speak...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Vittorio Veneto：</span><br>
That's a scenario I don't want to imagine.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Illustrious：</span><br>
Lady Veneto, may I have a word?<br>
If there's one thing clear about this attack, it's that you are the victims.<br>
On the other hand... were there truly no warning signs before this happened?<br>
A surprise attack with giant weapons of destruction was hitherto unprecedented. Not even the Sirens have engaged on this scale before.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Vittorio Veneto：</span><br>
Well...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Prinz Eugen：</span><br>
Good line of thought. These enemies might not even be Sirens to begin with.<br>
While, sure, they have giant weapons of their own, something about them just feels totally different.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Illustrious：</span><br>
Agreed. I'm afraid even we don't have any clues as to what they are...<br>
<br>
"I would not be so quick to dismiss the possibility that the Sirens are behind this attack."<br>
"That being said, Eugen has a point. These new enemies don't look like any Sirens we're familiar with, and their behaviors are completely different."<br>
"But that still doesn't answer the question of the hour – just what in the world are they?"<br>
At that time, a report came in that the entire World Expo venue had been reshaped to the point of being unrecognizable.<br>
After landing, the Gazers started to spew a mysterious substance into the air.<br>
Once the substance reached the ground, it started to spread and propagate rapidly like some kind of moss.<br>
As it grew, it devoured buildings and trees alike, until it covered entire islands.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Joffre：</span><br>
Forgive me, but I have to interrupt your conversation.<br>
As thought things weren't dire enough, I have further bad news.<br>
My reconnaissance planes have detected the presence of Gazers beyond the general area of the World Expo.<br>
New ones are appearing in nearly every area I've looked, all of them emitting that mysterious substance.<br>
It's likely by now that the Mediterranean and every coast surrounding it is within range of their invasion.<br>
Certain parts of the sea... No, even facilities on the land have been covered in the mist.<br>
While it's hard to tell from afar with my aircraft, I suspect the reason our communications are still offline is probably because the mist has blanketed our radio stations.<br>
Speaking of the mist, it seems those "clouds" seem to be eating up our carrier-based aircraft.<br>
Once an aircraft flies into one, its connection is lost, as though it was literally swallowed.<br>
I'd speculate this is either due to a loss of control of the aircraft, or its outright destruction.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Hakuryuu：</span><br>
She speaks the truth. I lost several of my own aircraft to those clouds.<br>
They're like beasts, devouring anything that flies into their mouths.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Shangri-La：</span><br>
Something hidden within the clouds that is swallowing aircraft, rather than destroying them...<br>
As unscientific as that claim is, it's hard to dispute the reality.<br>
Even the clouds have become our enemies.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Essex：</span><br>
Huh? What do you mean by that?<br>
Are you saying we're literally going to have to fight against clouds?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Vittorio Veneto：</span><br>
That strange substance is going to cover our sea, our land, our sky, our everything...<br>
This... This can't be happening...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Suffren：</span><br>
Guichen, do you reckon the same will happen to Vichya and Iris Libre?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Guichen：</span><br>
From the sound of it, it seems inevitable.<br>
If the Sirens are behind this, it's almost as if... they're trying to create a Mirror Sea in the real world...<br>
We've seen some of these phenomena before inside a Mirror Sea, but never something on this scale before...<br>
It shouldn't be possible to bring something like this into existence...<br>
...Not without some Sacrament of God.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Shinano ：</span><br>
A vision from this one's nightmares has taken form in the real world...<br>
Have I... seen a being of this nature before...?<br>
<br>
——It is not enough.<br>

It can't be...<br>
It is... a being that must not be let free upon the world...<br>
<br>
Bad news upon bad news upon bad news... A crushing atmosphere enveloped the conference hall.<br>
Then, just as the mood was about to reach its lowest point, a shrill voice sent a chill down everyone's spine.<br>
<span style="color:#ffd000;">Communicator：</span><br>
Ohohohohoho!<br>
What a spectacular view! Ahahahaha!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Memphis：</span><br>
Did someone jack into our channel again?<br>
Ugh! Why is EVERYONE doing it to us today?!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Vittorio Veneto：</span><br>
Wait, isn't that voice...?<br>
It's... Marco Polo!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Joffre：</span><br>
...You won't believe your eyes when you see this.<br>
Let's head outside. We must confirm this for ourselves.<br>
<br>
Everyone rushed out of the Vichya pavilion.<br>
High in the sky, an opulent throne floated in midair, illuminated by the golden radiance of the Skybound Wall.<br>
The seraphic wings extending from its sides cast a deep shadow across the land, an array of complex machinery sitting atop a pedestal within their embrace.<br>
Embedded in the back of the throne was a large gemstone that resembled an eye.<br>
And in the middle of everything was the familiar figure of Marco Polo.<br>
<span style="color:#ffd000;">Marco Polo：</span><br>
Good day, pitiful mortals.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Vittorio Veneto：</span><br>
Is that really you, Marco Polo? What is the meaning of this?<br>
<span style="color:#ffd000;">Marco Polo：</span><br>
Oh, can't you tell? After all my work making this series of events easy to understand?<br>
The Kingdom of God has been made manifest in the sky and the sea.<br>
He descended upon the land and granted me, His emissary, supreme powers.<br>
Which is to say, from now on you will refer to me as Her Holiness Marco Polo! Ohohoho!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Vittorio Veneto：</span><br>
You're not making a lick of sense...<br>
Under normal circumstances, I'd shrug this off as a prank, but not this time. Do you know what you've done to the World Expo?!<br>
You are its architect! You know better than anyone just how much money and resources we poured into the Expo to spread Sardegna's glory!<br>
End this ridiculous farce at once, Marco Polo!<br>
<span style="color:#ffd000;">Marco Polo：</span><br>
Spread Sardegna's glory? Ah, yes, glory.<br>
How did you expect to achieve that with some small garden party?<br>
And did you say "ridiculous farce"?! How dare you?! This is His great salvation!<br>
It's our chance at peace and unity...<br>
It's the beginning of a blissful, eternal age of glory for all of mankind...<br>
And it was nearly all ruined just because SOMEONE here was a little too perceptive!<br>
As punishment, I will make you all kneel before me! Ohohohoho!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Vittorio Veneto：</span><br>
I will give you one last warning.<br>
What you've done is a betrayal of your homeland. It is a declaration of war against the whole world.<br>
<span style="color:#ffd000;">Marco Polo：</span><br>
Really now? Doesn't matter to me.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Vittorio Veneto：</span><br>
How dare you...! Kersaint, take down the Skybound Wall! I will destroy this traitorous fool myself!<br>

Jeanne d'Arc, what's that thing on Marco Polo's head?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Jeanne d'Arc：</span><br>
That is the Crown of the Holy See. I'm certain of it.<br>
What I want to know is... how did she get her hands on it?<br>
The Crown is supposed to be under Marseillaise's protection!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Joffre：</span><br>
Oh no... Did Marco Polo steal it?<br>
But then, Marseillaise... and the stronghold on Saint Helena...<br>
You... What did you do, Marco Polo?!<br>
<span style="color:#ffd000;">Marco Polo：</span><br>
Ohohohohohoho!<br>
What's there to be shocked about? The Crown simply came into the hands of the one who deserves it.<br>
There is no one more deserving of it than me, Marco Polo, the emissary of God.<br>
No, as a matter of fact, you should be thanking me for personally keeping an eye on this little crown.<br>
Of course, you can struggle all you want, but you are no more than pitiful mortals.<br>
Soon, the Kingdom of God will cover the world.<br>
And then, all war and strife will vanish, and humankind may live in a timeless utopia.<br>
...Naturally, I know the fears and misgivings you mortals have.<br>
But it matters not! The great undertaking has been accomplished!<br>
You do not need to know, and I have no obligation to answer you.<br>
All that's left is to wait for the chaotic noise to change into a beautiful hymn.<br>
"The Divine shall descend upon the land."<br>
Ohohohohohoho!<br>

Marco Polo lets out the boisterous laugh of a woman possessed, completely indifferent to those struggling to lift their heads to gaze upon her.<br>
But soon, she seems to lose interest, and flies off into the distance.<br>
Beneath the golden sky, all she leaves beneath her is an ever-expanding expanse of white.<br>

<br>
A loud rumbling came from every direction.<br>
With Marco Polo's departure, the Gazers that had previously been floating around aimlessly now started to converge upon the Vichya pavilion.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Vittorio Veneto：</span><br>
Marco Polo... Why?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Giuseppe Garibaldi：</span><br>
Veneto, now isn't the time to wallow in despair.<br>
I think those Gazers are coming back to finish the job...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Bolzano：</span><br>
I can't believe it... Marco Polo is actually trying to get rid of us for good...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Essex：</span><br>
Umm... A large fleet of mass-produced ships has appeared in nearby waters...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Vittorio Veneto：</span><br>
Mass-produced ships? Has someone called for reinforcements?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Essex：</span><br>
I don't think so... They don't look like Sardegnian ships, and they don't seem to be engaging the Gazers either.<br>
I'll send visuals right away!<br>
<br>
Essex forwarded the picture to everyone present.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Guichen：</span><br>
Huh... Those certainly aren't Siren ships.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Suffren：</span><br>
I've never seen mass-produced models like these...<br>
Jeanne d'Arc, Foch, what do you two think?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Jeanne d'Arc：</span><br>
Ugh... The more I look at them, the more I feel like I should know what they are...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Foch：</span><br>
Oh! Aren't those the Tribunal's Mechanicus Confessors?! The one they made the prototype of?<br>
And that means... Wow, they mass-produced those?<br>
Joffre, do you know about this fleet?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Joffre：</span><br>
Well... it does seem to be affiliated with the Tribunal.<br>
Beyond that, this certainly is news to me.<br>
I've never seen them, either, and Lady Clemenceau has told me nothing about them.<br>
Kersaint is close to her, so it wouldn't be surprising if she knew something, but...<br>
<br>
Joffre emphasizes the words "close to her," learning in to give Kersaint a pat on the back.<br>
She's clearly trying to get her to talk.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Kersaint：</span><br>
U-umm... These mass-produced ships...<br>
<span style="color:#ec5d53;">Communicator：</span><br>
BEEP—<br>
<span style="color:#ec5d53;">Clemenceau：</span><br>
Kersaint, may I have a moment?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Kersaint：</span><br>
Lady Clemenceau... Sorry, things are a little tense right now...<br>
<span style="color:#ec5d53;">Clemenceau：</span><br>
Well, you seem calm enough to talk. Heehee.<br>
Kersaint, take all Vichya Dominion ships and lead them out of the World Expo venue.<br>
I'll see to it that those Gazers are amply distracted, so they won't trouble you.<br>
Understood, Kersaint?<br>
<span style="color:#ffd000;">Kersaint：</span><br>
Yes, ma'am!<br>
<span style="color:#ec5d53;">Clemenceau：</span><br>
Thank you for your efforts. I'll be waiting.<br>
<br>
That voice... Was that Clemenceau, the Tribunal's representative?<br>
<span style="color:#ffd000;">Joffre：</span><br>
Lead us out of the venue? Why...?<br>
Kersaint, did she tell you anything?<br>
<span style="color:#ffd000;">Kersaint：</span><br>
N-no, only that I should lead everyone out...<br>
But those are Lady Clemenceau's orders, so we have to obey...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Vittorio Veneto：</span><br>
(If Marco Polo released those Gazers, then... why is Vichya—no, the Tribunal itself...)<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Guichen：</span><br>
(Is that it? Are Clemenceau and Marco Polo in league with each other?)<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Jeanne d'Arc：</span><br>
Lady Clemenceau, what is your goal...?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Memphis：</span><br>
I think we can all agree that Marco Polo and Clemenceau's actions are related.<br>
Which means those mass-produced ships aren't our friends...<br>
<br>
Vichya and Marco Polo are in cahoots... Or so we're being led to believe.<br>
But why would they reveal that at a time like this? If Vichya wanted to betray us, then...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Prinz Eugen：</span><br>
Heh. Talk about unexpected developments, huh?<br>
<span style="color:#ffd000;">Kersaint：</span><br>
Sorry we can't fight alongside you all at a time like this...<br>
I'm sure this is the Iris's will, too... If Lady Clemenceau says so, then we have no choice but to obey.<br>
The Vichya Dominion doesn't mean to make an enemy of you all. Please, at least understand that...!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Pamiat' Merkuria：</span><br>
Let's leave aside what the Tribunal REALLY wants for a sec~<br>
If we let you take all the Vichya girls away, then that means the Tribunal's fleet can move freely. Isn't that right?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Prinz Eugen：</span><br>
Commander, might I suggest we detain them here a little longer?<br>
I know I'd feel a lot safer knowing that we have hostages protecting us from an all-out attack.<br>
<br>
I rack my brain over Clemenceau and the Tribunal's motives.<br>
The Gazer threat is real and imminent. If we don't act fast, it'll be too late. There's no reason to force ourselves to fight a losing battle, either.<br>
Say there's a traitor. Is it the entirety of the Vichya Dominion? The Tribunal? Or Clemenceau alone?<br>
<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项1："What are Clemenceau's demands?"</span>'''''<br>
<br>
I need to shake things up a bit, so that we can get the ball back in our court.<br>
<span style="color:#ffd000;">Kersaint：</span><br>
Clemenceau's demands? She only asked for us to evacuate to safety...<br>
<br>
"If she really means to eliminate us, then she would disable the Skybound Wall."<br>
<span style="color:#ffd000;">Kersaint：</span><br>
Sorry, she didn't say anything about the Skybound Wall...<br>
I assume that means it would be fine to leave it up?<br>
<br>
Kersaint doesn't seem to be lying. In that case...<br>
<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项1："I'm counting on you to take care of the Vichya shipgirls."</span>'''''<br>
<span style="color:#ffd000;">Kersaint：</span><br>
Thank you! Umm... May the benevolent Iris bless you in the coming struggle!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Prinz Eugen：</span><br>
Wow. You're just gonna let them leave?<br>
<br>
"You could call this a gamble."<br>
"If Clemenceau had some means of disabling the Skybound Wall, I would think she'd have already used it by now."<br>
"And if the Vichya shipgirls are scheming with Clemenceau, then there would be plenty of ways for them to leave this facility safely."<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Prinz Eugen：</span><br>
Uh-huh? So that's what you think... But what if your gamble fails?<br>
<br>
"I can give as many reasons as I want, but ultimately, the decisive one is faith in our friends."<br>
"Vichya has never done anything hostile toward us."<br>
"It's entirely possible that, like Marco Polo, something is influencing Clemenceau into madness."<br>
"I'm not about to start being suspicious of innocent people just because of that."<br>
"There's nothing more important to me than having faith in you shipgirls."<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Prinz Eugen：</span><br>
Faith, huh? Even if we decide to be hostile toward you?<br>
<br>
"If there's a way to bring you back to us and keep you from harming people, then yes. Absolutely."<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Prinz Eugen：</span><br>
Heheheh, alright, fine. I'll go with your decision.<br>
I'll have faith in you—as the Commander of Azur Lane, and as someone who cares so much about us.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Shinano ：</span><br>
This one concurs, too...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Vittorio Veneto：</span><br>
Very well. Whatever the situation may be, it's better to try and change the situation than it is to sit around doing nothing.<br>
I'd still like to have faith in our Vichya friends, too.<br>
<span style="color:#ffd000;">Kersaint：</span><br>
Thank you all! Then we'd best be going...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Jeanne d'Arc：</span><br>
Excuse me, Kersaint. I wish to ask you one question before you leave.<br>
Do you believe that the Vichya Dominion is treading the path of righteousness?<br>
<span style="color:#ffd000;">Kersaint：</span><br>
I-I wonder... I wouldn't really know, but...<br>
I envy those who get to choose their path to begin with.<br>
<br>
With that, the Vichya shipgirls left the pavilion amidst the rumbling of the approaching Gazers.<br>

Royal Navy Rally Point Iberian Peninsula - Strait Fortress<br>
After the Gazer appearance<br>
The blaring of anti-raid sirens through the air–<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">York：</span><br>
Unidentified vessels spotted! You have entered our domain... Er, the Royal Navy alert perimeter! Identify yourselves!<br>
Repeating! Unidentified vessels, you've...<br>
Miss Warspite, they're not responding.<br>
They're just approaching silently, not even attacking... Should I keep yelling at them?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Warspite：</span><br>
Please do. Rather than being the first to attack, we should patiently work to understand the situation.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">York：</span><br>
Roger!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">London：</span><br>
Miss Warspite, we've received word that giant, anomalous machines have appeared in nearby waters and along the coast!<br>
It seems they can move through the sea of their own volition... What should we do about them?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Warspite：</span><br>
I can see them even from here.<br>
Do we know anything about them?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">London：</span><br>
They don't look like Siren weapons, and we think they aren't made from any other faction's technology... In short, no...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Warspite：</span><br>
Understood. Are we able to communicate with other bases?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">London：</span><br>
We're doing our best to restore the connections now.<br>
We made contact with the Malta base for a moment and learned that they were in a similar situation, but we quickly lost the connection again.<br>
Unfortunately, we still haven't restored contact with the World Expo venue or Royal mainland.<br>
According to wide-area recon, the seas between the Mediterranean and the NA Sea are covered in fog.<br>
It extends from surface to sky like a wall, making it impossible to measure its height.<br>
We've sent mass-produced submarines, too, but...<br>
We lost control of recon ships and submarines alike the moment they entered the foggy area. They're lost at sea.<br>
It's possible that we may be trapped in the Mediterranean.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Suffolk：</span><br>
Oh, no... It's like the clouds combined and turned into a big, scary monster.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">London：</span><br>
The same thought occurred to me. This is an extremely abnormal situation, so we should be cautious.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Warspite：</span><br>
So we should stay calm no matter what, huh?<br>
The unusual substance emitted by those machines continues to spread. At this rate, it's only a matter of time...<br>
York, have you warned that mass-produced fleet that we will attack them if they don't identify themselves?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">York：</span><br>
Yes! I did, but they haven't responded whatsoever!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Warspite：</span><br>
Then they are the enemy.<br>
We have no more need for warnings. Her Majesty told us to protect this area, and that is exactly what we will do.<br>
All ships, obliterate the enemy fleet! You have the fortress's defenses to support you!<br>

Royal Navy Rally Point Temporary Malta Base<br>
After the Gazer appearance<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Nelson：</span><br>
Act fast, everyone!<br>
Use active radars to help locate and mop up that gross, gooey substance!<br>
Cold start all inactive radars! Hurry, hurry!<br>
...Ark Royal, how are things on your end?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ark Royal：</span><br>
No enemies coming our way... But the Sardegna Empire isn't looking good at all.<br>
Nelson, any idea what the properties of that goo might be?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Nelson：</span><br>
Not a clue. It looks like fungus, but also has metallic properties. It doesn't burn, and it's surprisingly tough.<br>
What are we supposed to do about this...?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ark Royal：</span><br>
Are there any casualties?!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Nelson：</span><br>
No. Fortunately, it's just... kind of gross.<br>
Rodney, Jervis, Janus, and Fortune are working to clean it up as we speak.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Rodney：</span><br>
You called~?<br>
We're doing just fine here! In fact, we just discovered our secret weapon!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Nelson：</span><br>
Secret weapon? What have you done?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Rodney：</span><br>
It's the souvenir shampoo we were selling at the World Expo!<br>
We didn't sell much, so we got to take some of the stock home for free...<br>
Imagine our surprise when we learned that it dissolves that gooey stuff right away!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Nelson：</span><br>
That's more than just surprising! *sigh*... I'll come over and help.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ark Royal：</span><br>
So it's weak to shampoo? Odd, but dealing with it is our first priority for the moment.<br>
I'll pass this information on to Her Majesty and the Commander right away.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Le Terrible：</span><br>
Defeated by shampoo, of all things...<br>
Excuse me. May I take a sample with me?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ark Royal：</span><br>
We have a whole pile of it outside. Take as much as you... Wha?!<br>
Le Terrible?!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Le Terrible：</span><br>
Yes, that is my name.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ark Royal：</span><br>
*sigh*... Where did you come from?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Le Terrible：</span><br>
Call it a... secret passage.<br>
More importantly, I come with a message from Cardinal Richelieu.<br>
I wish to speak with whoever is in charge of this fortress. Could you tell me who that is?<br>
If Illustrious is at the venue... then would you happen to be in charge?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ark Royal：</span><br>
Sure, but what's this about the secret passage?<br>
Are you saying the Royal Navy aren't the only ones who know about it?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Le Terrible：</span><br>
We Iris happen to have a history with this place, as well.<br>
Since there are sacred objects hidden here, it is our duty to protect it.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ark Royal：</span><br>
Well, whether the Cardinal asks us to or not, we're here to secure an escape route for our allies fleeing from the venue.<br>
That goes for my little sisters, too.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Le Terrible：</span><br>
R-right... Well, please allow me to assist you.<br>

<br>
Sardegna Empire - Pantheon<br>
Shortly before the Gazer appearance<br>
A woman was basking in the tranquility of the ancient temple with her eyes closed.<br>
That is, until the silence was broken by a girl's energetic voice.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Leonardo da Vinci：</span><br>
Roma!<br>
I finally found you! What are you doing here?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Roma：</span><br>
Ah. Leonardo da Vinci?<br>
Are you really not going to attend the World Expo? I heard today is closing day.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Leonardo da Vinci：</span><br>
That's what I was going to ask! Aren't YOU gonna be at the closing ceremony?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Roma：</span><br>
No. They changed things so Marco Polo will be delivering the closing speech instead of me.<br>
I don't want to get swept up in anything big again. Not after that unexplained incident at the start of the Expo.<br>
Really, don't worry about me. Go enjoy the rest of the expo.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Leonardo da Vinci：</span><br>
Trust me, I really want to go! But, I can't!<br>
I made a promise to Alfredo not to leave you by yourself. While she's back at the Expo, I have to stick with you.<br>
But, if you go to the Expo, then I can come along! Come on, you can be there as a spectator – you don't have to play an active role!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Roma：</span><br>
As a spectator, you say... Hmm. Let me think for a bit...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Leonardo da Vinci：</span><br>
Sure. I'll call Alfredo in the meanwhile♪<br>
...That's odd. Why won't it connect?<br>
Is she on the line with someone? Or is she out of range?<br>
That shouldn't be possible with the shipgirl-only channel, though...<br>
<span style="color:#ffd000;">Communicator：</span><br>
BEEP—<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Leonardo da Vinci：</span><br>
It connected! ...Wait, it's not my communicator ringing, but rather Roma's?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Roma：</span><br>
This is Roma. Who am I speaking to?<br>
<span style="color:#ffd000;">Marco Polo：</span><br>
I see you're in the Pantheon! I've been trying to get a hold of you!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Roma：</span><br>
Marco Polo? I thought you had a closing speech to deliver? You don't have time to call–<br>
<span style="color:#ffd000;">Marco Polo：</span><br>
Things have changed. The World Expo is in serious danger.<br>
No, not just the Expo, but the Sardegnian nation in its entirety.<br>
In accordance with the state of emergency protocol, I am tasked with resolving this situation.<br>
Until the state of emergency is lifted, all military forces in and around Sardegna are under my command.<br>
Roma, you are to head to the Expo immediately, prepare for battle, and wait for further instructions.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Roma：</span><br>
Is Veneto aware of the situation?<br>
<span style="color:#ffd000;">Marco Polo：</span><br>
I can't say. The Expo is a mess right now and I don't know where she is.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Roma：</span><br>
...Okay.<br>
So you, the woman meant to deliver the closing speech, have abandoned that duty and are issuing orders to shipgirls.<br>
Even supposing our Senate's state of emergency protocol was revised as you've described, I cannot accept your command based solely on what you've told me.<br>
<span style="color:#ffd000;">Marco Polo：</span><br>
Hmm... Didn't you always have a disdain for politics? When'd you get so smart about this stuff?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Roma：</span><br>
Simple – my gut's telling me that you can't be trusted.<br>
There's been something strange in the air, ever since the Sirens kidnapped me during the opening ceremony.<br>
That feeling intensified when you called me. The sanctity of this place, the time-honored history and customs of Sardegna... It all changed the moment you came into the picture.<br>
Whoever you are, you are not Marco Polo.<br>
<span style="color:#ffd000;">Marco Polo：</span><br>
You've seen right through me, have you? Magnificent! Then let me tell you something.<br>
This place, all of it, has become the Kingdom of God. Once His descent is complete, all war will end.<br>
Until then, take care and be patient! Ohohohohoho!<br>
<br>
After a boisterous laugh from Marco Polo, massive explosions could be heard coming from outside the Pantheon.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Leonardo da Vinci：</span><br>
Holy crap! Where did that giant robot come from?!<br>
It's... the coolest thing ever... Wait, now's not the time!<br>
It's coming to attack us! Roma, you need to get out of...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Roma：</span><br>
The horns of war have sounded.<br>
Da Vinci, prepare for battle! We're going in!<br>

<br>
Sardegna Empire - Taranto<br>
Immediately after the Gazer appearance<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Libeccio：</span><br>
Whoooa! Giant dandelions are falling from the sky!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Maestrale：</span><br>
Whatever those are, they're obviously NOT dandelions!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Nicoloso da Recco：</span><br>
Bleehhh... Since when did the Sirens start fielding disgusting weapons like this?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Aquila：</span><br>
The area around Taranto is a mess... Worse yet, I can't get in touch with Veneto or Littorio.<br>
Abruzzi, don't you think we should set out to battle?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Duca degli Abruzzi：</span><br>
No. Best not to jump the gun before we know what's going on.<br>
Rash decisions have cost us too many times in the past.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Aquila：</span><br>
Good point... Then hopefully, someone will contact us very soon.<br>
<span style="color:#ffd000;">Communicator：</span><br>
BEEP—<br>
<span style="color:#ffd000;">Marco Polo：</span><br>
This is Marco Polo. Do you read me?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Aquila：</span><br>
Oh! It's you, Marco Polo!<br>
Thank goodness. This is Aquila speaking. Are you still at the World Expo?<br>
How's the situation over there? Do you have any idea what's going on?<br>
<span style="color:#ffd000;">Marco Polo：</span><br>
I had a feeling you knew something bizarre is happening.<br>
As you can already tell, all of Sardegna is in serious danger.<br>
In accordance with the state of emergency protocol, I am tasked with resolving this situation.<br>
Until the state of emergency is lifted, all military forces in and around Sardegna are under my command.<br>
Aquila, you and everyone else at Taranto are to head to the Expo immediately, prepare for battle, and wait for further instructions.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Aquila：</span><br>
To provide rescue and relief efforts? Understood.<br>
Actually, wait... If I remember right, Veneto takes precedence over you on the chain of command on the state of emergency protocol...<br>
What happened to her? Did she confer authority to you?<br>
<span style="color:#ffd000;">Marco Polo：</span><br>
Veneto this, Veneto that... It's always about her, isn't it?<br>
That's precisely why I've chosen this path.<br>
You know what? Screw all of you! Hmph!<br>
<span style="color:#ffd000;">Communicator：</span><br>
BEEP—<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Aquila：</span><br>
Hm? H-hello? Marco Polo?<br>
Aren't you going to tell us what's going on?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Duca degli Abruzzi：</span><br>
It seems safe to say something quite bad is going down.<br>
It'd be one thing if this was just another quarrel between them, but this clearly goes way beyond any feud.<br>
That strange substance continues to spread even as we speak.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Nicoloso da Recco：</span><br>
Bad news! Really bad news, everyone!<br>
Look outside! Some ginormous three-legged robot appeared out of nowhere!<br>
It's releasing a white mist everywhere, and it's coming towards us!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Duca degli Abruzzi：</span><br>
A white mist? It can't be!<br>
That robot must be the source of the spore-like substance gumming up the sky!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Aquila：</span><br>
Abruzzi! Da Recco! Let us prepare for battle at once!<br>

<br>
Somewhere in the Mediterranean<br>
Vichya Dominion fleet - Immediately following World Expo evacuation<br>
Having escaped from the World Expo, the Vichya fleet had ended up somewhere in the Mediterranean Sea.<br>
The Gazers did not even try to launch an attack on them, just as Clemenceau had promised.<br>
<span style="color:#ffd000;">Foch：</span><br>
You know, it's gonna look like we're the bad guys, since we fled the Expo after it was attacked.<br>
Kersaint, there's no one else around now. I think it's time you explained everything.<br>
What the heck is going on? And what is Lady Clemenceau after?<br>
<span style="color:#ffd000;">Kersaint：</span><br>
I haven't the faintest idea, myself.<br>
Lady Clemenceau said she had an ingenious plan in store, but that's all.<br>
She wouldn't tell anyone what the plan is.<br>
All she would tell me is that everything will go well if we do as she says.<br>
<span style="color:#ffd000;">Joffre：</span><br>
Only Kersaint would naively trust that plan with so little information given.<br>
A plan she kept secret not only from the Senate, but also her own comrades within the Tribunal.<br>
I can only pray this plan will lead to something good.<br>
<span style="color:#ec5d53;">Communicator：</span><br>
BEEP—<br>
<span style="color:#ec5d53;">Clemenceau：</span><br>
I see you've arrived at the first set of coordinates, Kersaint.<br>
Has everything gone well so far? The Commander left you alone, just as I said, no?<br>
<span style="color:#ffd000;">Kersaint：</span><br>
Yes! We wouldn't have been able to leave the pavilion, had the Commander not been there.<br>
We're fortunate that the Commander is a truly kind person.<br>
<span style="color:#ec5d53;">Clemenceau：</span><br>
Not just kind, but reasonable and keen as well.<br>
Now, I'll send you the next coordinates. Make sure you're ready for battle before you head there.<br>
That being said, you are under no circumstances to engage anyone or anything you encounter until you reach the coordinates.<br>
I will call you again once you arrive.<br>
<span style="color:#ffd000;">Kersaint：</span><br>
Understood, Lady Clemenceau.<br>

Sardegna Empire - Venice<br>
After the Gazer appearance<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Littorio：</span><br>
Seems we've hit the jackpot.<br>
So this is where the Senate has been secretly storing all those artifacts. Inside an inconspicuous warehouse.<br>
What are your thoughts on this, Torricelli?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Torricelli：</span><br>
I don't... really have any?<br>
As I told you earlier... I'm not exactly an artifact appraiser or anything...<br>
If you want an expert opinion... you should go to da Vinci...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Littorio：</span><br>
Cut me a break. It's impossible to get a hold of her.<br>
Hmm... True. She's always busy with her inventions...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Torricelli：</span><br>
But... it's quicker to send me underwater than her, so there's that...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Littorio：</span><br>
At any rate, your intuition is reliable.<br>
Veneto and I have had our suspicions for a long while, but couldn't find any leads no matter how hard we tried.<br>
Which is why I want you to search this place from top to–<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Torricelli：</span><br>
On that note, Littorio...<br>
It's dark and deserted in here... Same environment as always, so...<br>
Don't make any sound... while I'm investigating...<br>
Hehe, hehehe... I promise I'll be thorough...<br>
<br>
Littorio turned on her heel and was just about to leave the warehouse, when...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Littorio：</span><br>
...The black sun. First it came for Roma, and now it's come for me.<br>
But why? I haven't touched any dubious artifacts, so I shouldn't be seeing this.<br>
Maybe you don't see it in response to touching an artifact, but rather because someone actively shows it to you?<br>
Then who would that be? The Sirens? Or maybe...<br>
<span style="color:#ec5d53;">Communicator：</span><br>
BEEP—<br>
<span style="color:#ec5d53;">Clemenceau：</span><br>
It's been a while since we spoke, Littorio.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Littorio：</span><br>
That voice... Is that you, Clemenceau?<br>

Vichya Dominion - Waters around Toulon<br>
After the Gazer appearance<br>
The Vichya Dominion and Iris Libre formed a coalition fleet to respond to the imminent crisis. However...<br>
<span style="color:#ffd000;">Jean Bart：</span><br>
Return to the anchorage?! You can't be goddamn serious, Clemenceau!<br>
That unknown substance will cause unimaginable damage if we don't do somethin' about the enemy!<br>
We're shipgirls, dammit! Our duty is to protect humanity!<br>
<span style="color:#ec5d53;">Clemenceau：</span><br>
Yes, I'm well aware. That is why I'm telling you to return to the anchorage.<br>
Don't let the lives I saved from the Commander go to waste.<br>
I'm not telling you not to fight, alright? If the Gazers launch a direct attack on Toulon, then you may counterattack.<br>
<span style="color:#ffd000;">Jean Bart：</span><br>
Piss off! You think I'm just gonna sit with my thumb up my ass while everything goes to hell around me?!<br>
<span style="color:#ec5d53;">Clemenceau：</span><br>
For goodness' sake... I'm tired of repeating myself over and over.<br>
Gascogne, be a dear and "persuade" her, will you?<br>
<span style="color:#ffd000;">Gascogne：</span><br>
Jean Bart. Requesting that you accept the anchorage plan.<br>
Continued refusal will result in Gascogne engaging coercion protocols.<br>
<span style="color:#ffd000;">Jean Bart：</span><br>
......<br>
Tsk... So what the hell are you trying to achieve here?<br>
<span style="color:#ec5d53;">Clemenceau：</span><br>
Don't worry, I'll explain once everything is over. Be a good girl, now.<br>
<span style="color:#ffd000;">Jean Bart：</span><br>
...God dammit!<br>
<br>
Jean Bart smashed her communicator into her rigging's armor, leaving a dent in it.<br>
<span style="color:#ffd000;">Dunkerque：</span><br>
Taking your anger out on your communicator won't solve anything. If it breaks, you'll need to get it repaired.<br>
<span style="color:#ffd000;">Jean Bart：</span><br>
You'd be pissed too if you were in my shoes.<br>
I'm not 'bout to train my guns on an ally... We'll head to that damn anchorage.<br>
<span style="color:#ffd000;">Painlevé：</span><br>
Please don't feel too downcast, Jean Bart. I would suspect Clemenceau has a plan.<br>
You are blessed sister ships, after all. She must want what's best for–<br>
<span style="color:#ffd000;">Jean Bart：</span><br>
No. Clemenceau's changed.<br>
She's not the same person I used to know.<br>
<span style="color:#ffd000;">Painlevé：</span><br>
Still, don't you think you should have faith in her?<br>
<span style="color:#ffd000;">Jean Bart：</span><br>
I should. But right now, I can't.<br>
She saved me once, but I can't forgive her for what she's done.<br>
When I stepped out of the freezing-cold water and opened my eyes again, I made a promise to myself...<br>
That I'd make a different decision.<br>
That I wouldn't let the Reenactments play out once again.<br>
That I wouldn't let my friends become puppets and pawns ever again.<br>

<br>
I stepped out of the Vichya pavilion and looked all around me.<br>
The mysterious substance was still growing, stretching, reaching out like a living mycelium that sought to pull heaven and earth into one.<br>
In addition to the Gazers, smaller enemies began to appear with greater frequency as well.<br>
Fortunately, between the Skybound Wall and the alliance fleet's growing cohesion, the combat situation around the pavilion was slowly stabilizing.<br>
However, just reaching a standstill could hardly be considered a victory with how quickly the situation everywhere else was deteriorating.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Illustrious：</span><br>
...Our analysis of the mysterious substance has brought something new to light.<br>
It may just point us to where these smaller enemies are appearing from.<br>
<br>
I check the two pictures taken by Illustrious' recon planes that popped up on my phone.<br>
The first shows a place covered in white, dotted with hundreds of cocoon-like objects of varying sizes.<br>
Each cocoon is connected by a small thread, almost resembling cells making up a larger organ.<br>
The second picture shows a cocoon rupturing, an indescribable enemy emerging from it.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Memphis：</span><br>
That is disgusting... What ARE these things?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Shinano ：</span><br>
Beings that consume all matter, giving birth to abominations, multiplying...<br>
It is like a scene out of a nightmare, something that could not exist in reality... Even with the Commander by my side, I feel fear...<br>
We may be in a new type of Mirror Sea... Or perhaps, even inside this one's dream...?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Memphis：</span><br>
Not to be rude, but that just sounds like wishful thinking to me.<br>
<br>
"Don't take that personally, Shinano. Others don't understand the power you have, but I do."<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Shinano ：</span><br>
No... She is correct... I have no evidence, therefore it is natural that I be doubted...<br>
Reality as this one knows it and the reality we are in have diverged drastically since the arrival of these Gazers...<br>
Supposing that this is a dream, it would explain Marco Polo's and Clemenceau's unusual behavior...<br>
What we do not yet know is if you and this one are the only dreamers, or if all shipgirls are...<br>
<br>
That reminds me... Shinano said the same thing back in AF – that the events of that Mirror Sea were a dream.<br>
Of course, no sane person would believe that. There is no way that an anomaly that has tangible effects on both people and reality is only a dream.<br>
However, it's a different story if we assume we've been pulled into a space which functions like a new kind of Mirror Sea, rather than just a dream.<br>
It's a very optimistic guess, but approaching the situation this way is the only way we can hope to resolve it.<br>
"First of all, we're going to treat this space – including the Gazers, the goopy substance, even the World Expo – as part of an anomalous Mirror Sea."<br>
"To free ourselves from it, we will need to find whatever controls the Mirror Sea and destroy or neutralize it."<br>
"That could be Marco Polo, or it could be a machine of some sort. Either way..."<br>
<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项1："I will lead you to victory."</span>'''''<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Essex：</span><br>
...Commander! Our signal is online!<br>
We have connected directly to the Space Needle tactical line and can communicate with all bases within a huge radius!<br>
Starting up cross-pavilion data transfer line and signal array now!<br>
Royal Navy, Iron Blood, Sakura Empire, Sardegna Empire, Dragon Empery, Northern Parliament, Iris Libre... standby!<br>
Three... two... one... Helena! Turn it on!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Communicator：</span><br>
BRRRRZZZZZ... fortress here... BRRRRZZZZZ.... received... BRRRRZZZZZ... respond... BRRRRZZZZZ...<br>
Malta... BRRRRZZZZZ... Expo... BRRRRZZZZZ... please respond... BRRRRZZZZZ...<br>
<br>
There was a reason I had everyone avoid combat with the Gazers and go through the risk of eliminating the enemies inside the Expo venue.<br>
It was so we could connect to the Space Needle and amplify our signal, establishing a communications network with all bases around the Mediterranean Sea.<br>
The flow of incoming signals all but overloaded the line. This meant our allies were out there, fighting as we spoke.<br>
At the same time, however, it also meant that this anomalous phenomenon was not contained to just the sea around the World Expo.<br>
"First thing's first – we need to sort the situation out and establish a chain of command."<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Memphis：</span><br>
Leave that to me, Commander.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Guichen：</span><br>
Two heads are better than one, right? I'll help.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Avrora：</span><br>
Make that four. Pamiat' Merkuria and I will assist, too.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Prinz Eugen：</span><br>
I'm no expert when it comes to this stuff, so let me instead introduce someone who is.<br>
Thiele, come here and give these people a helping hand.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Z2：</span><br>
Very well. I can do that.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Shinano ：</span><br>
You, too, should step forth, Noshiro...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Noshiro：</span><br>
Certainly, Shinano.<br>
<br>
Working with our allies across the Mediterranean, we finally managed to get a basic grasp on the situation.<br>
Finally, we could pierce through the fog of war and seize the initiative.<br>
Though Gazers had appeared as far as Gibraltar, the fortress there managed to hold.<br>
I asked Warspite to mobilize what forces she could, and she is now on her way with her main fleet to link up with us.<br>
The situation in Malta, however, is far more dire. The garrison is being besieged, its defenders all but surrounded.<br>
In light of this, I put Eugen in charge of a small but battle-hardened detachment of Iron Blood forces to provide support.<br>
Assuming they're able to repel the enemy and secure the island, the plan for now is that they'll group up and return here.<br>
As for the Iris and Vicha forces in Toulon, Clemenceau apparently requested them to defend an anchorage there.<br>
As far as the intel they shared told us, they have no idea what the Vichya's Holy See fleet and the Tribunal are up to.<br>
So, to keep an eye on Clemenceau, they sent Jean Bart and her fleet away to be on standby.<br>
Then, there was the Sardegna Empire, and their groups were quite split.<br>
Marco Polo declared their state of emergency protocol to be in effect and made calls to all Sardegnian bases to inform the shipgirls there that they were under her control.<br>
None of them believed her, however. Later, Veneto convinced them to join our side.<br>
Aquila's fleet over in Taranto had eliminated all enemies in the surrounding waters, and were now regrouping and resupplying.<br>
Littorio and Torricelli were in Venice, investigating a matter relating to their Senate. Then, when the Gazers appeared, they fled the area.<br>
They then wound up alone inside a bunker, but as they assured me, there was no need to worry whatsoever and they'll find an alternate escape route.<br>
That didn't stop me from worrying, of course. Based on Veneto's relieved response to hearing them, however, I just had to believe they'd be okay.<br>
Then there's Roma and a few others. They were in the capital and had successfully repelled an attack on it.<br>
They said they'd mop up the stragglers then group up with us. More importantly, though, they told me a very important piece of information.<br>
That Marco Polo is performing some kind of ritual on her giant, flying throne.<br>
Finally, there was one Sardegnian fleet near the Oasis port that we were completely unable to contact.<br>
That could just have been due to the weather, since a sandstorm appeared there just before the closing ceremony. Just to be sure, we had Taranto send recon planes there.<br>
All in all, our allied fleet includes everyone at the World Expo, a few Sardegnian fleets around the Mediterranean, scattered Iris and Vichya fleets, and a Royal Navy detachment.<br>
The Gazers are powerful, and they're aided by endless cannon fodder. We are outmatched ten to one... but, there is still a chance.<br>
Now, what's our next move?<br>

<br>
Mount Vesuvius – the most dangerous active volcano in Europa that once wiped out an entire city in a single eruption.<br>
A woman clad in opulent black robes stood at the edge of a distant cliff, her eyes fixed on the crater that rises 1,200 meters above sea level.<br>
However, the dozens of transparent communication windows flickering in the air around her show that she is not here for sightseeing.<br>
<span style="color:#ec5d53;">Clemenceau：</span><br>
The higher you climb, the farther you'll be able to see.<br>
Take in the fresh air, and let it calm your mind. Up here, you have all the time in the world to wait. There is no need for anxiety.<br>
Now, all the preparations are complete.<br>
All that remains... is for the easterly wind to blow.<br>
<span style="color:#ffd000;">Communicator：</span><br>
BEEP—<br>
<span style="color:#ffd000;">Marco Polo：</span><br>
Clemenceau! Where are you?! Can you hear me?<br>
<span style="color:#ec5d53;">Clemenceau：</span><br>
Why hello there, Marco Polo. I just arrived near the outskirts of Rome.<br>
All the roads were covered with Divine Vestige, you see. It took quite a bit of time to navigate around all of it.<br>
<span style="color:#ffd000;">Marco Polo：</span><br>
I told you! You should've set out sooner!<br>
<span style="color:#ec5d53;">Clemenceau：</span><br>
Yes, but I didn't want to raise suspicions. Don't forget that I'm the Tribunal's representative.<br>
<span style="color:#ffd000;">Marco Polo：</span><br>
*sigh*... You need to get your priorities straight.<br>
<span style="color:#ec5d53;">Clemenceau：</span><br>
That's not like you to say. What's wrong? Have things not gone according to plan?<br>
<span style="color:#ffd000;">Marco Polo：</span><br>
Well, SOME things have. Beyond that, though, it's been an absolute trainwreck.<br>
It's those damn fools at the Expo... They're hell-bent on struggling until the very end.<br>
Couldn't even convince my fellow Sardegnians either. They wouldn't shut up about Veneto this, Veneto that.<br>
Some of them have even dared to challenge me personally!<br>
And from the look of things, it's not gone so well for you either. Why hasn't the Skybound Wall been deactivated yet?<br>
<span style="color:#ec5d53;">Clemenceau：</span><br>
If turning it off was so simple, it wouldn't be a sacrament.<br>
If you want it gone so badly, why not just use your Oculi Dei? Surely it cannot stand before the machines of true divinity.<br>
<span style="color:#ffd000;">Marco Polo：</span><br>
Of course! If I used all of their power, it wouldn't stand a chance.<br>
However, I can't. I have more important things to focus on.<br>
God's descent has yet to be completed. I don't have the energy to waste on micromanaging the machines.<br>
This would've all gone like a dream, had the Commander not been here. Then I wouldn't have to do this!<br>
Bah... By the way, the Vichya fleet is waiting for your orders.<br>
Tell them to put some pressure on the Expo.<br>
Remember our promise. If my plan falls apart, yours will as well!<br>
<span style="color:#ec5d53;">Clemenceau：</span><br>
But of course. The Vichya Holy See Fleet is never idle.<br>
I'll call the girls in Toulon right away.<br>
Jean Bart, do you hear me?<br>
<span style="color:#ffd000;">Jean Bart：</span><br>
What do ya want? You changed your mind yet?<br>
<span style="color:#ec5d53;">Clemenceau：</span><br>
You could say that. You have clearance to sortie.<br>
I take it you're ready and raring to go?<br>
<span style="color:#ffd000;">Jean Bart：</span><br>
Goddamn right. I can't stand to ignore those giant monsters for one more second.<br>
First, I'm gonna mop up at the Expo. Then, I'm gonna wipe out every last one in the waters around it.<br>
<span style="color:#ec5d53;">Clemenceau：</span><br>
Good, you already have a plan. Yes, your enemy is at the Expo.<br>
Be a dear and smite all the shipgirls at the Expo as well with the help of the Oculi Dei, will you?<br>
<span style="color:#ffd000;">Jean Bart：</span><br>
...What'd you say?<br>
The hell are "Oculi Dei"? And whaddya mean "smite" them?!<br>
<span style="color:#ec5d53;">Clemenceau：</span><br>
They are the mechanical eyes of God Himself. As for "smite," you don't need me to explain that, do you?<br>
Don't worry. I've already evacuated every Vichyan shipgirl from there.<br>
The only ones left now are the sinners.<br>
The Royal Navy, Eagle Union, Northern Parliament, Iris Libre, Iron Blood, Sakura Empire, and Sardegna Empire...<br>
They're all inhuman warmongers who torment the world with their Reenactments. And then there's the one who leads them all.<br>
We've been hurt, mistreated, trampled, and made to suffer for far too long...<br>
Now, the people responsible are all in one place. Isn't this an ideal opportunity to end them?<br>
All conflict will cease to be without their armies to wage war.<br>
Without conflict, there'll be no reason to divide ourselves into factions and groups.<br>
We shall have our revenge, purge the sinful, and prepare to welcome God.<br>
This is the Last Judgment, Jean Bart.<br>
<span style="color:#ffd000;">Jean Bart：</span><br>
Clemenceau... Have you lost your goddamn mind?<br>
We are SHIPGIRLS, dammit! Our duty is to PROTECT humanity!<br>
Yes! Reenactments are unfair and unjust!<br>
But I'm not about to kill people because of that! Our enemies are those giant eyeballs, not our own allies!<br>
If we don't do something about 'em, all of civilization is gonna be smothered under that nasty goo!<br>
Even if the world isn't all on our side, we need to stand together as shipgirls and fight the real fight!<br>
Those giant machines, Oculi Dei, whatever – THOSE are the real enemy!<br>
As we speak, they're tryin' to destroy everything we're supposed to protect!<br>
<span style="color:#ec5d53;">Clemenceau：</span><br>
I applaud your spirit. Your heart is in the right place.<br>
However, you're wrong. They haven't "destroyed" anything, and they will not lay hands on that which we're supposed to protect.<br>
As I said, this is Judgment Day. The sinful must be punished, and the seas must be wiped clean to make way for the Kingdom of God.<br>
We will not forget nor forgive the pain we and our faith have suffered.<br>
<span style="color:#ffd000;">Jean Bart：</span><br>
...I get it now. You're not Clemenceau – you're someone wearing her face like a mask.<br>
Someone's got to put a stop to your psycho plan.<br>
I'm not gonna let these robots go to the Expo, and I'm not gonna point my cannons at my friends!<br>
<span style="color:#ec5d53;">Clemenceau：</span><br>
You're saying you don't want justice?<br>
<span style="color:#ffd000;">Jean Bart：</span><br>
Your twisted idea of it? No. I don't need it.<br>
I'm not gonna follow any damn Reenactments, and I'm not gonna be controlled like a puppet!<br>
If those machine monsters are gonna go after the people I care about...<br>
Then I'll stop at nothing to kill them, even if it costs me my life!<br>
And if you're on their goddamn side, I'll kill you too!<br>
<span style="color:#ec5d53;">Clemenceau：</span><br>
Ahahahahah! Listen to yourself. I'm the Tribunal's representative – I'm your ally.<br>
<span style="color:#ffd000;">Jean Bart：</span><br>
Clemenceau's more than that. She is my sister, and she is NOT a servant to some fake God!<br>
Whoever you are, you're sure as hell no ally of the proud Templar Knights!<br>
Neither is that woman with the Crown of the Holy See hiding behind you! The only thing she is is a clown!<br>
<span style="color:#ffd000;">Marco Polo：</span><br>
"CLOWN"?! HOW DARE YOU?!<br>
You have insulted the emissary of God! A crime worthy of divine retribution!<br>
Out of my way, Clemenceau! I am going to teach this little rat some manners!<br>
<span style="color:#ec5d53;">Clemenceau：</span><br>
Of course. By the name of the Crown of the Holy See, I hereby excommunicate Jean Bart, and all those who side with her, from the Vichya Dominion.<br>
<span style="color:#ffd000;">Jean Bart：</span><br>
......<br>
<br>
After delivering a punishment equivalent to exile, Clemenceau hung up without another word.<br>
<span style="color:#ec5d53;">Clemenceau：</span><br>
Well, well. That's not a very easterly wind at all.<br>
What will you do now, I wonder, Commander?<br>

World Expo - Vichya Pavilion<br>
Some time later...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Memphis：</span><br>
Commander, we just got word that Iris Libre and Vichya Dominion forces have engaged the enemy!<br>
Vichya hasn't sided with Marco Polo after all!<br>
<br>
"Finally some good news, but given the Tribunal's involvement, we can't assume that they're on our side just yet."<br>
"On one hand, Clemenceau did threaten us with mass-produced ships and Gazers. On the other, we haven't been formally declared as enemies either."<br>
"The Skybound Wall is still functioning, and it has successfully kept the Gazers at bay."<br>
"Maybe it's just Clemenceau. Maybe she's acting so unusually because she's under some spell..."<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Memphis：</span><br>
What should we do, Commander?<br>
<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项1："We'll sail out to aid Jean Bart and her fleet."</span>'''''<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Memphis：</span><br>
Got it! I'll be honest, there is the chance that this is a trap...<br>
But as you said, the rest of them didn't act hostile towards us, and they didn't mess with the pavilion's defenses either.<br>
Right now, we are all allies in the battle against enemies of humanity.<br>
It's possible Clemenceau has lost her mind, or that she's pulling a ruse in typical Tribunal fashion...<br>
Regardless, we are all shipgirls. We're people with a common goal.<br>
<br>
"I'm confident that they feel the same way."<br>
"...The Royal Navy fleet should be arriving any minute now. As for that 'secret passage'..."<br>

Silence swept across the peak of Mount Vesuvius.<br>
This was one place where the white substance – the Divine Vestige – had not made its mark yet.<br>
Battles were being fought across the Mediterranean Sea, but the sounds of war could not reach this tall peak.<br>
<span style="color:#ffd000;">Marco Polo：</span><br>
Oh, Clemenceau! Where are you now?<br>
<span style="color:#ec5d53;">Clemenceau：</span><br>
I'm on the way to the safehouse you told me about earlier.<br>
The Tribunal's mass-produced ships have arrived, so it's time for me to set off to the Expo.<br>
<span style="color:#ffd000;">Marco Polo：</span><br>
Magnificent! Finally, some good news.<br>
It's ridiculous how much pushback we've faced when God's descent is so close to completion... Thank goodness I have you to rely on.<br>
Before your final battle, I have something nice to tell you.<br>
I chose the safehouse you'll be staying in, especially for you.<br>
It's separated from the Senate's secret facilities by only one block.<br>
Also, you'll find Flandre waiting for you there.<br>
You heard that right – Flandre, the blueprint ship. The ace up our sleeve, better than anyone else at manifesting religious concepts.<br>
<span style="color:#ec5d53;">Clemenceau：</span><br>
Really? I would've never guessed she was so close by.<br>
<span style="color:#ffd000;">Marco Polo：</span><br>
Hahaha! I reckoned she'd be of use to you, so I had her redeployed.<br>
Besides, she belongs to the Holy See, right? It only makes sense that you'd command her, not me.<br>
Now go. Rendezvous with Flandre, take the Tribunal's fleet with you, and head for the World Expo!<br>
I'll send Trento META to assist you as well.<br>
Make those nonbelievers see the light of God!<br>
<span style="color:#ec5d53;">Clemenceau：</span><br>
I will, Marco Polo.<br>
Don't worry about me. Focus only on completing the ritual to...<br>
Oh. She hung up.<br>
So you're going to show your full hand this early. Reckless as always, Marco Polo.<br>
And I hoped you'd stay in the game for at least a while longer...<br>
A shame. It truly is a shame.<br>
<br>
Clemenceau lightly shook her head in disappointment, then extended a hand up to her holograms and tapped through a menu.<br>
<span style="color:#ffd000;">Kersaint：</span><br>
Kersaint speaking. I've arrived at the coordinates. What am I supposed to do now?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Clemenceau：</span><br>
I'll tell you. Listen closely. Blueprint ship Flandre will come there to meet you.<br>
She did briefly serve Marco Polo, but I assure you, she's on our side. Whatever you do, don't attack her.<br>
Once she has arrived, call everyone to regroup with you.<br>
Then, you will go to the new set of coordinates I just sent. Be ready for a battle.<br>
Your enemy is a META – Trento.<br>
She'll think you're on her side, so try to catch her off guard.<br>
Be quick and incapacitate her with one blow.<br>
You must not sink her, and you must not let her get away. Just incapacitate her.<br>
Once that's done, call me back, and remain on standby until your next orders.<br>
...Did you get all that, or was it too shocking for you? Shall I start over?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Kersaint：</span><br>
N-no need, I heard you loud and clear! I've committed it all to memory!<br>
By the will of the Holy Iris.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Clemenceau：</span><br>
Yes. By the will of the Holy Iris.<br>
<br>
Clemenceau terminated the call, then closed all her holograms.<br>
She grasped her staff firmly, held it high...<br>
And at that exact moment, Mount Vesuvius erupted.<br>
<span style="color:#92fc63;">Clemenceau：</span><br>
The old Tribunal's crowning achievement among conceptual weapons – Blanc, the symbol of Conquest.<br>
Smoke blotting out the sun, flames consuming everything; finally, a horseman to signal the end days.<br>
It really sets the scene for the climactic finale. Heehee.<br>
Now, I'd better leave while I'm ahead of the clock.<br>
Although I've told Marco Polo countless lies, there's one thing I haven't lied about.<br>
That roads covered by the Divine Vestige are truly, truly awful to walk on.<br>

<br>
Atop her winged throne, Marco Polo looked out across the world, watching the final minutes tick away until her audience with God.<br>
The throne and crown both shimmered, signaling that her great ceremony was close to completion.<br>
The seas began churning, and from the dark depths, something began to stir, clawing its way into this reality.<br>
<span style="color:#ffd000;">Marco Polo：</span><br>
Ohohohohoho! This magnificent feeling! God has come!<br>
Glory to Sardegna! Glory to me!<br>
Let this be the start of a new age!<br>
<br>
BOOOOOOM!<br>
A loud, distant rumble drew Marco Polo's attention.<br>
<span style="color:#ffd000;">Marco Polo：</span><br>
Is that Mount Vesuvius? Why would it erupt now?<br>
More importantly, what is THAT?!<br>
What in the name of... White armor, a bow, and a horse?<br>
How is it flying when it's riding a horse?!<br>
No, what am I saying? That doesn't matter!<br>
The real question is – what in God's name is it, and why did it just leap out of a volcano?!<br>
<br>
Marco Polo stared like a deer in headlights at the giant knight, unresponsive to the fact that it was moving closer to her.<br>
<span style="color:#ffd000;">Marco Polo：</span><br>
What?!<br>
It drew its bow! And it's aiming... right at ME?<br>
Crap! I can't dodge it in time!<br>
<br>
KABOOOM!<br>
<span style="color:#ffd000;">Marco Polo：</span><br>
AAAAAHHHHHH!<br>
<br>
Though she herself avoided a direct hit, the horseman's laser beam nevertheless grazed her throne's superstructure, causing a devastating explosion.<br>
Critically damaged from the shockwave and the damage of the explosion itself, the throne began to sway violently.<br>
<span style="color:#ffd000;">Marco Polo：</span><br>
Damnit, damnit, damnit! My wings! I can't maintain flight!<br>
I need to find... somewhere to make an emergency landing!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Communicator：</span><br>
BEEP—<br>
<span style="color:#ffd000;">Marco Polo：</span><br>
Clemenceau's calling? Now, of all times?!<br>
Clemenceau! Where are you?!<br>
You must have seen the giant horseman by now! What IS that thing?!<br>
Is it some secret weapon? Are Veneto or the Commander in control of it?!<br>
I need help! My throne is breaking down as we speak!<br>
Forget about the Expo! Come here and rescue me!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Clemenceau：</span><br>
"I saw the first seal open, and I beheld a white horse."<br>
"And he that sat on him had a bow, and a crown was given unto him, and he went forth conquering."<br>
That is Blanc, the Tribunal's Mechanicus Harbinger of Conquest, a divine machine made by mortal hands.<br>
Now, with the concept of conquest strengthened, I have regained control over the Tribunal's mass-produced ships.<br>
Checkmate, Marco Polo.<br>
<span style="color:#ffd000;">Marco Polo：</span><br>
WHAT?! Was this your goal all along?!<br>
You lied to me! You manipulated me, Clemenceau!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Clemenceau：</span><br>
Ahahahaha! Took you long enough to realize.<br>
While you're a good friend, your "God" was never meant to be.<br>
<span style="color:#ffd000;">Marco Polo：</span><br>
How could you do this? How could even YOU betray me, Clemenceau?!<br>
We shared the same dream! We were kindred souls! You were the only person I could trust!<br>
I thought you were with me... I thought you were my friend...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Clemenceau：</span><br>
Don't sulk. I feel the same about your dream, and I'm thankful for all you've done for me.<br>
Likewise, our friendship wasn't a lie. I still consider you a friend.<br>
And that is precisely why I have to stop you.<br>
This is the only way to save Sardegna's future, as well as your life.<br>
<span style="color:#ffd000;">Marco Polo：</span><br>
Why... Why would you do this to me?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Clemenceau：</span><br>
You will never be more than a jester, and I mean that in a good way. You're not fit to play a villain.<br>
A villain betrays. They betray their beloved nation, their family, and their friends.<br>
If you want my advice – let the true villain take on all the responsibility.<br>
While it is true that the nation of Sardegna has made mistakes, it is only a victim at the end of the day.<br>
In fact, actively cooperating with the Commander may be to its benefit.<br>
Don't you think that would be a great first step towards spreading your glory?<br>
<span style="color:#ffd000;">Marco Polo：</span><br>
In the end, you're just a mortal... like the rest of them...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Clemenceau：</span><br>
That I am. A mortal and a villain. But, even a villain can look out for her friends.<br>
Listen, Marco Polo. I will not let you summon a false god that will turn you into a Pawn.<br>
I will not let you destroy everything you hold dear.<br>
And most of all, I will not let you be tarnished with sin beyond redemption.<br>
<span style="color:#ffd000;">Marco Polo：</span><br>
There's no point... Nothing matters anymore...<br>
Why... Why did this have to happen...<br>
I was so close... Just one step away...<br>
It's over... My ideals...<br>
My... perfect world...<br>
<br>
Muttering in disillusionment, Marco Polo and her crumbling throne sank beneath the water's surface.<br>
Once more, silence swept across the world.<br>

<br>
A massive fleet was gathering in the waters outside of Saint Helena's port.<br>
Before Richelieu's eyes, countless Iris Libre flags fluttered in the wind.<br>
But among them was a flag that had not been flown for what felt like an eternity – the Iris Orthodoxy's insignia, representing both Iris Libre and the Vichya Dominion.<br>
All who saw it couldn't help but wonder – how long has it been? How long have they waited for this moment?<br>
Richelieu's eyes turned from the flags raised all around her, towards the sea fog hanging low in the distance.<br>
What had once been a source of mystery and doubt was now a doorway towards her goals.<br>
But unlike the sunny, placid seas around her that shimmered with the colors of her homeland, what awaited on the other side of the doorway was the scent of gunpowder and burning debris.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Richelieu：</span><br>
(Le Terrible, this is what you were searching for at the Tribunal stronghold...)<br>
(But why does the Tribunal use Siren technology to this extent?)<br>
(Clemenceau, what role do you play in all of this...?)<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Marseillaise：</span><br>
Cardinal, it's almost time.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Richelieu：</span><br>
Yes. At long last...<br>
.........<br>
<br>
Richelieu took a deep breath, stepped forward in front of the podium, and felt the weight of her fingertip pressing down into the tiny button on the microphone.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Richelieu：</span><br>
My friends of the Iris Orthodoxy, listen well–<br>
<br>
The entire audience fell silent as everyone's attention shifted to the Cardinal's words.<br>
Richelieu looked out across the people gathered there. She saw her friends – those who she had fought alongside before, and those who she would fight alongside in the battle to come.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Richelieu：</span><br>
My friends, you have seen what lies on the other side of that door–<br>
Our blue seas, violated by the enemy.<br>
Our land, rivers, and skies engulfed in a nightmare from which there is no waking up.<br>
As we speak, the anomalies that attacked the World Expo encroach on our world.<br>
The flames of war threaten to consume us once again.<br>
But do not forget – there are still those who would also give anything to snuff out those flames.<br>
Yes, our compatriots in the Vichya Dominion are fighting as we speak.<br>
<br>
Richelieu gestured to the doorway in front of them. The scenery on the other side became clearer and more vivid as the sea fog prepared to teleport them.<br>
Cannons firing desperately, swarms of bizarre enemies, giant machines raining from the sky, a sea choked with unnatural, grasping clouds.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Richelieu：</span><br>
Do not forget – both Iris Libre and the Vichya Dominion used to exist as one.<br>
The Iris Orthodoxy has always been one.<br>
However, the misfortunes of the past divided us, misleading us into turning our blades on our own.<br>
We never asked for those scars that now cover us and our homeland.<br>
None of us chose the unreasonable reality we now face today.<br>
<br>
After a pause, she surveyed her compatriots again.<br>
Then, she reached for a flag standing on the podium—one that she did not normally bear.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Richelieu：</span><br>
Despite that, many of you have followed me across the Royal Islands, through the flames of war.<br>
Others joined us along the way on this long march toward justice.<br>
I, Cardinal Richelieu, firmly believe that we are all driven by the same belief, regardless of how long we have been on this journey.<br>
There is no doubt in my mind that we are all gathered here for a unified purpose–<br>
To see the Iris Orthodoxy become whole once more!<br>
We will not turn a blind eye while our home is ravaged!<br>
We will not turn a blind eye to the suffering of our friends!<br>
We proud warriors will not bend. Not to Sirens, not to the Reenactments, and certainly not to the fear and uncertainty.<br>
Even if what lies beyond this door is a calamity that threatens all of civilization, there is but one thing for us to do.<br>
We will defy it, and we will fight in the name of the Iris Orthodoxy to the very end!<br>
I, Cardinal Richelieu, do solemnly swear upon this sacred banner...<br>
I will fight until I breathe my last.<br>
I will fight until the banner of the Iris Orthodoxy flies free over our homeland, when no enemy shall ever threaten us again!<br>
Come, my compatriots of the Iris Orthodoxy. The time is upon us.<br>
Weigh anchor! We set sail for our motherland!<br>
<br>
Their vessels rumbled like thunderous applause.<br>
Thus, the glorious march of a unified Iris Orthodoxy had begun.<br>
Vichya Dominion Territory<br>
Toulon Harbor<br>
Fierce fighting had been raging on for quite some time.<br>
Burning wreckages now littered the surface of the water.<br>
Though the defenders had managed to buy a moment of peace, there was no doubt in their minds that they would not be able to hold off the next onslaught.<br>
After destroying the final enemy in her line of sight, Jean Bart kneeled, exhausted, and looked at her injured allies.<br>
What drove them was no longer pride, but an indignation of not wanting it to end like this.<br>
<span style="color:#ffd000;">Jean Bart：</span><br>
Not again, damn it...<br>
Am I just losing control of my emotions...<br>
...Or did I make the wrong decision?<br>
Did I lead my friends to destruction again?<br>
<span style="color:#ffd000;">Painlevé：</span><br>
Jean Bart, the next wave is coming!<br>
It's not just mass-produced ships this time! They have more forces in the skies above and waters below...<br>
What should we do...?<br>
<span style="color:#ffd000;">Jean Bart：</span><br>
(Good question... I damn sure wish I knew the answer.)<br>
(First Richelieu, now Clemenceau. Why must we suffer betrayal after betrayal?)<br>
<br>
Jean Bart numbly pushed away the call from her communicator and sat down in the water.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Richelieu：</span><br>
Don't give up just yet, Jean Bart.<br>
<span style="color:#ffd000;">Jean Bart：</span><br>
Sister...?<br>
Tch... What, is that just my life flashing before my eyes? Or is it the stupid black sun making me hallucinate?<br>
What a cruel joke. So this is who God sends to take me away.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Richelieu：</span><br>
Jean Bart, as leaders, there are always those who look towards us for hope.<br>
If even we give up, we shut the door on those who deserve a brighter tomorrow.<br>
Please fight until the last light has faded.<br>
<span style="color:#ffd000;">Jean Bart：</span><br>
Quoting the Commander, huh? God sure has a funny sense of humor, using my sister's face to say those words...<br>
<br>
BOOOOM!<br>
The booming of artillery heralded the return of war to the quiet sea.<br>
The anomalous enemies born from Divine Vestige appeared on the horizon once more.<br>
However, their attacks were not directed toward Jean Bart's fleet.<br>
<span style="color:#ffd000;">Vauquelin：</span><br>
Jean Bart, reinforcements! Reinforcements have finally come!<br>
Look over there! It's the Iris Libre fleet, along with the Tribunal's fighting angel!<br>
The enemy is being routed! We're saved, Jean Bart!<br>
<span style="color:#ffd000;">Dunkerque：</span><br>
Phew... I'd just made peace with the fact that I was about to get sunk. Talk about good timing...<br>
But, if both the Tribunal and Iris Libre are here, does that mean... that the conflict with Clemenceau was just an elaborate ruse?<br>
<br>
Jean Bart could not make sense of the words she was hearing.<br>
Her emotions had been roiling for so long. What did it all mean? Could she afford to have hope again?<br>
<span style="color:#ffd000;">Jean Bart：</span><br>
Iris Libre... and the Tribunal, together...? What's going on...<br>
And when I heard Richelieu's voice before... Was that...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Richelieu：</span><br>
Sorry I'm late, Jean Bart.<br>
No matter how desperate the situation is, we must not give up on hope.<br>
Otherwise, we will not be able to seize that brief glimmer of light when it finally arrives.<br>
<span style="color:#ffd000;">Jean Bart：</span><br>
Cardinal Richelieu... Why are you here?<br>
You didn't come just to laugh at me, did you?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Richelieu：</span><br>
No, I'm here to save someone dear to me.<br>
A certain shipgirl who calls me her sister, in fact.<br>
<span style="color:#ffd000;">Jean Bart：</span><br>
.........<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Richelieu：</span><br>
Though, it wouldn't hurt to call me that more often.<br>
For example... During a touching reunion? Such as this one?<br>
Repeat after me, now. "Sister."<br>
<span style="color:#ffd000;">Jean Bart：</span><br>
Why, you...!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Richelieu：</span><br>
Sorry, I got a bit carried away there.<br>
I'm sure there's a lot you'd like to get off your chest right now, but the enemy is still out there.<br>
I'd love to catch up with you later, but let's get right to business first–<br>
Le Terrible told me about the situation at the World Expo venue. We're going to support the Commander next.<br>
But, I can only speak for Iris Libre. The Vichya Dominion will need to make its own choice.<br>
Jean Bart, will you join me?<br>
<span style="color:#ffd000;">Jean Bart：</span><br>
...I don't speak for the Vichya Dominion anymore.<br>
We've been excommunicated by Clemenceau. We're just exiles now.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Richelieu：</span><br>
That doesn't change my offer.<br>
<br>
Jean Bart stood up, took a deep breath, and flipped the switch on her communicator.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Jean Bart：</span><br>
To all those shipgirls who no longer have a place to call home – I am battleship Jean Bart, formerly of the Vichya Dominion, speaking!<br>
I will now join Cardinal Richelieu's fleet, and aid her in fighting for a unified Iris Orthodoxy.<br>
I'm no longer in any position to order any of you around, but...<br>
I hope you'll decide to join us in driving those bastards out of our homeland!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Painlevé：</span><br>
Jean Bart...!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Vauquelin：</span><br>
I'd be glad to!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Dunkerque：</span><br>
Of course. Banished or not, we'll follow you to the ends of the earth.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">La Galissonnière：</span><br>
Haha, you stubborn old grouch! I'm just glad you and Algérie finally decided to open up!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Jean Bart：</span><br>
...Yeah, it's been too damn long.<br>
It's time... to put the past behind us.<br>
<br>
Jean Bart discarded the shattered banner of the Vichya Dominion, and got down on one knee in front of Richelieu.<br>
Richelieu then lay her own Iris flag atop Jean Bart's shoulder.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Richelieu：</span><br>
As Cardinal of the Iris Orthodoxy, I solemnly declare...<br>
Jean Bart, your unjustly-deprived status as a Templar Knight and your position within the Iris Orthodoxy's fleet are hereby restored to you.<br>
The same goes for all the other shipgirls here formerly under the command of the Vichya Dominion.<br>
Please fight alongside us, Jean Bart.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Jean Bart：</span><br>
.........<br>
By the will of the Holy Iris...<br>
I swear my allegiance to you, Cardinal Richelieu. Sister.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Richelieu：</span><br>
...I've finally come back to you, my sister.<br>
Sorry it took me so long.<br>
<br>
Cheers erupted over the ocean.<br>
And, without anyone's notice, Gascogne silently slipped away after bearing witness to it all.<br>

<br>
Some time in the past...<br>
Unknown location within Iron Blood<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Marco Polo：</span><br>
*sigh*... Would you just answer me, Friedrich?<br>
What do you think of the Reenactments under these circumstances?<br>
We'll never be able to get rid of the Sirens for good unless we all join forces.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Friedrich der Große：</span><br>
Naturally. But your proposal isn't grounded in reality.<br>
As long as the Naval HQ has influence, any forceful attempt to unite the factions will end in failure.<br>
Even a superficial alliance will come to naught, just like the previous Azur Lane.<br>
Squeezing sand in your hand will only cause it to slip through your fingers...<br>
Until nothing remains.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Marco Polo：</span><br>
Hmph. Alright, so we can't get along. But that doesn't mean we can just go along with the Sirens' plans.<br>
Doesn't that only fuel their power and make the situation worse?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Friedrich der Große：</span><br>
War is but a continuation of politics with other means.<br>
What is true of Reenactments... is also true of our war against the Sirens.<br>
It's simply not time yet, Marco Polo. Don't rush things.<br>
I'd best be going soon. Return to Sardegna, and play your part of the composition.<br>
<br>
Friedrich left. Only Marco Polo remained in the room.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Marco Polo：</span><br>
You sound so self-important, Friedrich der Große.<br>
Is it because you're a blueprint ship? Well, so am I!<br>
Don't we exist to crush Sirens with overwhelming force?<br>
*sigh*... Wasting energy on politics and inter-faction conflicts is so inefficient. Bismarck's confidant, my ass.<br>
But it's true that we're getting nowhere fast right now. There has to be a way to break through this, like a way to easily beat the Sirens...<br>
I know... I'll just have to find someone stronger than them.<br>
Just you watch, Friedrich. Someday, I'm going to clean up this mess myself.<br>
Then, the whole world will know my name and marvel at my greatness!<br>
{{折叠面板|内容结束}}

{{折叠面板|标题=Curtain of Night|选项=24|主框=1|样式=primary|展开=是}}
<br>
With the fall of Marco Polo's throne, everything had changed in an instant.<br>
The sky went dark at once, as if a purple curtain had been drawn over it. Beneath the artificial night sky, fear and uncertainty continued to grow despite the "victory."<br>
Clearly, things had not gone back to normal even with Marco Polo's defeat.<br>
Danger was still growing within the darkness.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Communicator：</span><br>
BEEP—<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Clemenceau：</span><br>
Good day– Or rather, I suppose I should say "good evening" now.<br>
Did everyone enjoy Marco Polo's curtain call just now?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Memphis：</span><br>
Commander, umm, we seem to have a call from Clemenceau.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Clemenceau：</span><br>
That's right. It's me, Clemenceau from the Vichya's Tribunal.<br>
I would've loved to meet all of you and enjoy our time together at the closing ceremony...<br>
But alas, who could've anticipated all of this to happen?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Pamiat' Merkuria：</span><br>
How shameless... Acting like you weren't a part of this.<br>
You were also the one who sicced those mass-produced ships and Gazers on us, weren't you?<br>
Right before they landed, you transferred all of your own Vichya ships away!<br>
You're not going to giggle and say all of this was just an act, are you?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Essex：</span><br>
She's right! You better give us a believable explanation for everything that happened!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Clemenceau：</span><br>
Oh my, is that the name you came up with for my divine machines?<br>
That's cute. Heehee.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Vittorio Veneto：</span><br>
Clemenceau, don't change the subject.<br>
As the host of this World Expo, I demand an explanation for this catastrophe.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Clemenceau：</span><br>
Heehee. It WAS all an act~ ...You'd be surprised how close you are to the truth.<br>
The situation necessitated the emergency transfer.<br>
Had I not done so, Marco Polo would've attempted to coerce them into betraying you, and I would've not been able to release the Horseman of Conquest.<br>
Likewise with the Tribunal's mass-produced ships. They were all a façade to convince her that I was on her side.<br>
You understand, don't you, Commander? The Skybound Wall could easily withstand the divine machines' attacks.<br>
My "transgressions" did not truly place you in harm's way, so why not put on a show to earn Marco Polo's trust?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Essex：</span><br>
In other words... You knew her plan from the start, and you've been pretending to work with her all this time.<br>
All to stop her in the end...?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Clemenceau：</span><br>
Exactly. I feigned cooperation until her plan reached its very climax.<br>
Didn't you think the shot that perfectly picturesque?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Illustrious：</span><br>
I must admit, it was quite magnificent... But what was that golden-armored machine?<br>
Is it related to the divine machines you were talking about?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Clemenceau：</span><br>
Somewhat. That is a weapon called the Mechanicus Harbinger, developed in secret by the Tribunal.<br>
You may be able to trace its roots back to Marco Polo, but rest assured that it is under my control.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Vittorio Veneto：</span><br>
...I suppose we should content ourselves with the knowledge that they won't attack us anymore.<br>
But Clemenceau, do not assume that everyone will be satisfied with that alone.<br>
The Marco Polo I know would never come up with such a dangerous scheme.<br>
If you cooperated with her, having full knowledge of the danger of her schemes, then that makes you a co-conspirator... No, worse. You enabled her.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Clemenceau：</span><br>
That's hardly fair, Vittorio Veneto.<br>
Even knowing her plans, do you think I had the capacity to stand up to the power she wielded?<br>
If there was even the slightest leak, her first order of business would be eliminating the Tribunal, given our specialty in information manipulation.<br>
Regardless, we still haven't cleaned up the mess she made.<br>
I'll have my subordinates recover her. For now, shall we meet face-to-face?<br>
...Though I'll have you know that I'm already on my way to the Vichya pavilion.<br>
<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项1："What about the fleet in Toulon? Are they safe?"</span>'''''<br>
<br>
"We just learned that Jean Bart's fleet has been struggling to fight off the enemy assault for some time now."<br>
"A Royal Navy fleet is on their way to reinforce them, but the enemies on the way have slowed them down. We don't know how well that secret passage will continue to function, either."<br>
"If the Tribunal has mobile forces to put to work, then I expect you to stop the enemy reinforcements heading to Toulon."<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Clemenceau：</span><br>
Yes, of course, Commander.<br>
Toulon is in Iris territory, and Jean Bart is a sister ship of mine. I'll see it done right away.<br>
As for the secret passage, I'm sure they've used it by now.<br>
As for the Royal Navy's fleet, why don't we... Actually, let's discuss this in person later.<br>
The road here is a bit difficult to traverse, so I'll get back to you later–<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Communicator：</span><br>
BEEP—<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Memphis：</span><br>
Aaand she hung up. She really does march to the beat of her own drum...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Essex：</span><br>
In a way, she's like Prinz Eugen. Or... worse, even.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Communicator：</span><br>
BEEP—<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Memphis：</span><br>
Another call? This time, it's... Cardinal Richelieu?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Essex：</span><br>
Suspicious timing. Is it related to that hidden passage the Commander mentioned?<br>
<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项1：(Pick up the receiver.)</span>'''''<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Richelieu：</span><br>
This is Richelieu speaking.<br>
Commander, representatives of the World Expo. I'm happy to see you all safe.<br>
Our fleet has already arrived at Toulon and confirmed the safety of Jean Bart's fleet.<br>
Once we've cleaned up enemies around the port, performed maintenance, and resupplied, we plan to come and join you.<br>
<br>
(It seems like they made it to Toulon through their hidden passage without issue.)<br>
<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项1："Say, what's all this about a hidden passage?"</span>'''''<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项2："Did something happen at Saint Helena?"</span>'''''<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Richelieu：</span><br>
We initially went to Saint Helena to secure the Crown of the Holy See and rescue Marseillaise.<br>
Upon inspecting the documents we found at the secret stronghold there, we found a large amount of material concerning Siren technology.<br>
One of the topics of interest was a network of "highways" that Compiler used to rapidly move across the ocean.<br>
We then found a set of equipment called the "microlayer transference system," devices that would allow us to use Compiler's network in the form of sea fog.<br>
While it is just normal fog, the activation of the device turns the microlayer particles comprising it into a gateway of sorts that allows us to move en-masse to distant locations.<br>
Apparently, this network spans all over the world, which Compiler used to connect countless underwater areas and Mirror Seas.<br>
Presumably, this is how Sirens used Mirror Seas as the staging grounds for their attacks, able to move their forces over long distances.<br>
It also explains how they've always seemed to appear out of thin air, and were able to attack areas that should've been inaccessible to them.<br>
In any case, this technology definitely was not meant for our use, but can still function without Compiler's authorization.<br>
For whatever reason, following Compiler's defeat, we have been able to gain access into the network.<br>
After studying the Tribunal's analytical data on Saint Helena, we were able to tap into the network, though only to a limited extent due to the limitations of our equipment.<br>
We understand the inherent risks in using Siren technology and planned to report our findings first, but the situation changed when we learned that fierce fighting had broken out in Toulon.<br>
The fact that we were able to lead such a large fleet through safely is surely due to the Holy Iris's blessings.<br>
<br>
(It sounds to me like Clemenceau ordered the Tribunal to tell Richelieu the location of the Crown of the Holy See.)<br>
(The crown might have ended up in Marco Polo's hands, but this alone is probably proof enough that Clemenceau isn't our enemy.)<br>
(Tell her about Clemenceau.)<br>
"I think you might not have a full grasp of the situation either, but we want to know as much as possible before we come face-to-face with Clemenceau."<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Richelieu：</span><br>
Really? Clemenceau did that...?<br>
Very well. I will tell you what I know.<br>
Before setting sail, Clemenceau told me a part of her plan.<br>
Her plan was to both stop Marco Polo and use this dangerous situation to bring Iris Libre and the Vichya Dominion back together.<br>
...And by making herself the villain, she would protect Jean Bart.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Vittorio Veneto：</span><br>
.........<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Illustrious：</span><br>
.........<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Avrora：</span><br>
Comrades, if I may offer my opinion–<br>
Clemenceau's actions may still be suspicious, but I believe that we should have faith in our Commander and in Richelieu.<br>
With the situation in the Mediterranean Sea—no, the entire world—as it is, the Tribunal's power and knowledge will be essential.<br>
While they might have been split up as a product of the Reenactments, let us not forget that they once sailed under the single banner of the Iris Orthodoxy.<br>
Let's leave our doubt and our worries of a betrayal that may have never happened aside. We must focus on the danger before us.<br>
<br>
"Thanks for your input, Avrora."<br>
<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项1："Now, when should we join up?"</span>'''''<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Richelieu：</span><br>
A fair question. Between Jean Bart's repairs and resupplying...<br>
...Oh. It seems enemy reinforcements have arrived.<br>
Apologies, Commander, but it seems we'll need some more time.<br>
Considering Clemenceau's behavior so far, I understand your reluctance to trust her.<br>
But still... I ask that you look after her all the same, Commander.<br>

<br>
A mixed fleet consisting of Sakuran and Iris forces just so happened to be nearby when Marco Polo's throne was shot out of the sky.<br>
Said fleet was originally sent there to clear the surrounding area of enemies. They began their search for the wreckage once they'd confirmed the Horseman had ceased operation.<br>
It didn't matter whether Marco Polo had lost her mind or just been manipulated – she had to be rescued.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Suffren：</span><br>
I think the throne is somewhere around here! Keep your eyes peeled, everyone!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Guichen：</span><br>
(While the whole sky darkened after that explosion, the area ahead feels even darker than its surroundings.)<br>
(It's as though something is blocking the light... Or absorbing it, like a black hole?)<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Shimakaze：</span><br>
This is a good time to turn on my searchlights!<br>
Now it'll be easy to–<br>
<br>
Shimakaze's searchlights lit up the sea around her – and also revealed a misty hole in space.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Shimakaze：</span><br>
Whoa, it's pitch black! Is it... swallowing up the light?<br>
That's just like a black hole, isn't it?<br>
<br>
Though the light could not pierce the darkness, it allowed everyone to clearly see its outline.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Guichen：</span><br>
It's like an egg, jutting out of the water... Does that mean there's more of it underwater?<br>
I think I remember reading about a sacrament that roughly matched this thing's description.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Noshiro：</span><br>
We've already established that the unknown substance is what's creating all the enemies.<br>
So, it's possible that this other unknown substance produces a different breed of enemy.<br>
The clouds swallow our aircraft and spit out twisted versions of them, while the cocoons produce enemies reminiscent of mass-produced ships.<br>
The aircraft were liquid, and the mass-produced ships were solid. Therefore, perhaps this hole creates gaseous enemies?<br>
It would explain why your searchlights are ineffective if the gas is really, really, REALLY dense.<br>
Assuming this thing does spawn more enemies, we should destroy it now before it becomes fully operational.<br>
What do you think, Shinano? Should we attack?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Shinano ：</span><br>
This one is inclined to do so... Lady Jeanne, what do you think?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Jeanne d'Arc：</span><br>
On the one hand, we should study what we're dealing with. On the other, I agree with Noshiro.<br>
I think that we should back off and bombard it with our aircraft.<br>
That way, we can retreat quickly if something happens, and if Marco Polo for some reason is inside it, she'll suffer less damage than from direct cannon fire.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Shinano ：</span><br>
So be it... Hakuryuu, prepare your bombers...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Hakuryuu：</span><br>
On it. Been waiting too long as it is to use them.<br>
<br>
KABOOOM!<br>
Hakuryuu's aircraft dropped their bombs on the foggy cocoon, engulfing it in explosions.<br>
The very next moment, it retaliated with a shockwave.<br>
It took everyone. Hakuryuu, Noshiro, Shinano, Jeanne... the black mist engulfed every shipgirl who stood there.<br>
Flashback<br>
Somewhere in the Sardegna Empire...<br>
Inside a strikingly decorated office room, Marco Polo sat at her desk with a defeated expression.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Marco Polo：</span><br>
Another failure...<br>
And that one, and that, and this one too... They've all failed...<br>
How is it possible that I, the one born to spread Sardegna's glory, fail time after time after time again?<br>
I don't get it... Why won't anyone understand me?<br>
I want to restore the Empire's glory, I want to spread it all across the world, but nobody empathizes with my cause no matter the approach I take!<br>
Not the carefree Veneto sisters, not those who are perfectly happy languishing away in mediocrity...<br>
I'm so tired... Is there nothing I can do?<br>
<br>
She fell limp onto her desk, and she took hold of an ornament thoughtlessly left lying around.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Marco Polo：</span><br>
This cross must be ancient. Has it always been lying on my desk?<br>
<br>
She fixated her gaze on the small cross, as if at this moment, there was no object in all the world more worthy of her attention.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Marco Polo：</span><br>
...Huh?!<br>
Is this... a sign from God?<br>
He has the power to destroy the Sirens...<br>
Yes... That's it! The answer's been there all along!<br>
The enemy of the Sirens... The one whose power is greater than theirs!<br>
Ahahahahahaha!<br>

<br>
When Shinano's fleet attacked the black hole made by the gaseous substance, they were suddenly pulled deeper into the darkness.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Noshiro：</span><br>
*cough* *cough*... Shinano! Are you okay?!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Shinano ：</span><br>
Yes... Worry about the others instead—<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Hakuryuu：</span><br>
Shinano, we're in a real mess!<br>
Some weird enemies are crawlin' out of that dark goop!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Shinano ：</span><br>
...Fragments of nightmares, echoes of ruination...<br>
They only show themselves in this one's dreams of death... Why are they here?<br>
This is an ill omen... Jeanne, take everyone and evacuate...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Jeanne d'Arc：</span><br>
It will be done. Suffren, Maillé Brézé! Turn about-face and secure an escape route—<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Shinano ：</span><br>
No, Jeanne... We mustn't send anyone ahead on their own.<br>
Going the way we came, too, is unnecessary... If this one's hypothesis is correct, this boundary is like a dream...<br>
If we choose a specific direction and muster all of our strength, we may escape from this nightmarish domain...<br>
Nightmares may be formless, but... If we have been drawn into one from the real world, then there must exist a border between them...<br>
The enemy knows this, and they will try to surround us... Still, if we can break through, we may return to our home world...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Jeanne d'Arc：</span><br>
If you're so familiar with this, Shinano, I'd like you to choose the direction for our charge.<br>
<span style="color:#a020f0;">Memphis META：</span><br>
"Nightmares are formless, but they have borders." Oversimplified, but surprisingly close to the truth.<br>
However, I have a better plan.<br>
I know the safest route. Come with me.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Shinano ：</span><br>
Who are you...?<br>
<span style="color:#a020f0;">Memphis META：</span><br>
I'm... a friend of the Commander.<br>
I'll explain later. Just trust me for now.<br>
If we waste any more time, we'll miss our chance to escape.<br>
<br>
Shortly afterwards<br>
World Expo Venue - Vichya Pavilion<br>
Temporary Command Room<br>
<span style="color:#a020f0;">Memphis META：</span><br>
...And that's how I saved your friends. Couldn't have come at a better time too.<br>
The abominations they saw are able to contaminate a shipgirl's hull upon contact.<br>
Their courage is commendable, but if they aren't careful, it'll be their downfall.<br>
But don't worry. The contact was limited, so there shouldn't be any issues after we finish decontamination.<br>
Having that said, you should keep your distance for the time being if you value your safety.<br>
Now where were we? Yes, it's great to see you again, Commander.<br>
I hear you've been in the Superimposition—er... Reality Lens? Of late.<br>
I can't believe things turned out this way.<br>
...Though personally, I'm a little glad.<br>
<br>
Upon learning that we'd lost contact with Shinano's fleet, I had put together a team to go rescue them. Just then, Memphis META had contacted us.<br>
(Come to think of it, the other Helena helped us alongside this Memphis at the Union's Sea of Stars. I don't think I've had the chance to thank her...)<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Memphis：</span><br>
Are you the one who helped us at the Sea of Stars?<br>
The Commander told me all about what happened in the Reality Lens.<br>
Thank you, umm... Memphis?<br>
<span style="color:#a020f0;">Memphis META：</span><br>
...It's my pleasure.<br>
Your Commander is my Commander, too, so it's only natural that I try to help.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Memphis：</span><br>
*sigh*... At this rate, calling us both Memphis is going to get really confusing.<br>
What should I call you?<br>
<span style="color:#a020f0;">Memphis META：</span><br>
Whatever you want to.<br>
Memphis is fine, META is fine, "that girl who likes the Commander a little TOO much" is also fine.<br>
Heh. Maybe that last one is true for both of us, though?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Memphis：</span><br>
Th-that's not...!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Clemenceau：</span><br>
My, my. I'll admit I was worried when you asked me to rescue your friend...<br>
But you all are so carefree that I have to assume the problem is solved~ That's lovely.<br>
<br>
Clemenceau inserted herself in the midst of the increasingly awkward conversation without anyone's prior notice.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Memphis：</span><br>
Oh, this is embarrassing...<br>
<span style="color:#a020f0;">Memphis META：</span><br>
It's my fault. Now isn't the time for jokes.<br>
Allow me to continue. Commander, the situation is extremely bad.<br>
A hundred times worse than what you experienced in the Reality Lens.<br>
Our Helena is doing her best to slow down the superimposition of worlds, but at this rate, it won't be enough.<br>
You can't imagine how hard I had to work just to get to this branch.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Clemenceau：</span><br>
Wait... You know about superimposition?<br>
Well, well. Things are getting wilder than I'd imagined. I'm surprised you know about these things.<br>
<span style="color:#a020f0;">Memphis META：</span><br>
That should be my line. Someone from this branch knows about the superimposition of worlds?<br>
...Are you involved with the person behind this?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Clemenceau：</span><br>
I am, though only partially.<br>
Marco Polo brought this plan to me, and I pretended to play along.<br>
However, I am in the dark when it comes to what her "God" is.<br>
What I do know is the principle by which she intends to have "God" descend and establish her false Paradise.<br>
Naturally, I know how to stop it as well.<br>
<br>
With that, Clemenceau produces a map.<br>
The location where the abnormalities began, the Mediterranean Sea, is circled with a black pen.<br>
A number of cities, ports, and islands are also circled, all of them interconnected with lines.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Clemenceau：</span><br>
The large circle is her Paradise, where God will descend. That's the area currently filled with Divine Vestige.<br>
I believe the small circles here are conceptual anchors meant to create and maintain the domain.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Vittorio Veneto：</span><br>
Conceptual anchors...?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Clemenceau：</span><br>
Yes, they would be one of Vichya's Sacraments. They strengthen the manifestation of concepts, though I'm not sure that means anything to you.<br>
For the moment, just consider them special devices that maintain the domain.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Vittorio Veneto：</span><br>
If we destroyed them... No, there are too many, and they're all too far apart.<br>
They span every corner of the Mediterranean, and some beyond that. There's no way we could reach all those places in such a short time!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Clemenceau：</span><br>
Indeed. Consider that proof of how long Marco Polo has been working on her scheme.<br>
However, the grander the plan, the more openings there are for me to play a little prank~<br>
Now, take a look at the lines connecting conceptual anchors.<br>
<br>
Clemenceau traces the lines on the map with a finger.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Clemenceau：</span><br>
Commander, Richelieu has told you about how she moved her fleet to Toulon, yes?<br>
With Compiler's defeat, we've gained access to her microlayer transference network.<br>
So, do you now understand what these lines on the map indicate?<br>
While working with Marco Polo, I fudged the locations of the conceptual anchors just enough to bring them closer to the network's nodes.<br>
You'll find that they're rather accessible now, given the new tools we have.<br>
As for the conceptual anchors themselves... There's no need to destroy them. We'll merely subsume them into a different conceptual framework.<br>
This ritual is meant to reflect Marco Polo's concept of God, but we will counteract that with the concept of true divinity.<br>
By reinforcing the concept of holy miracles present in ancient religious tradition, we can reverse what she's done and overwrite her domain.<br>
It's quite simple to do, too. By activating the smaller Skybound Walls within each anchor, the domain of Marco Polo's kingdom will instead become a part of the Spear of Destiny.<br>
The Spear of Destiny is the Orthodoxy's holiest relic. It represents the divine promise of victory, and holds the power to conquer all evil.<br>
To summarize it cleanly...<br>
Marco Polo has been trying to bring a being called God from another world to ours.<br>
To do this, she uses a holy relic called a conceptual weapon to reflect the concept of another world's God within a certain area.<br>
<br>
"So by modifying the ritual's system and changing the concept to a source of holiness, we can expel both her God and the related phenomena..."<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Clemenceau：</span><br>
You catch on fast, Commander. Good.<br>
This very pavilion happens to have a conceptual anchor. Rather, the pavilion itself was built as part of her plan.<br>
We should be able to use the network to quickly travel from here to other conceptual anchor sites.<br>
Of course, each anchor will be protected by Gazers and more, but I'm certain that your leadership can overcome them.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Illustrious：</span><br>
Commander, before you make your decision – Lady Clemenceau, I would like an explanation.<br>
The map shows that the Strait of Gibraltar, Malta, and this pavilion have anchors...<br>
When did you and Marco Polo manage to set all of them up?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Clemenceau：</span><br>
In Gibraltar's case, it's in the ocean rather than at the port. We set that one up a rather long time ago.<br>
The conceptual anchor at Malta is even older. I'd almost wager that it's been there since before we were born.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Illustrious：</span><br>
So Le Terrible didn't go there alone just to contact the Commander; she was checking on the conceptual anchor.<br>
I can't say I'm surprised, Lady Clemenceau of the Tribunal. You think of everything.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Vittorio Veneto：</span><br>
If not for the Commander, I'm sure she would also be able to manipulate us to no end.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Clemenceau：</span><br>
Oh, don't be so modest. Intelligence just happens to be the Tribunal's specialty.<br>
So? Do you have any other questions?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Essex：</span><br>
I think the most important thing is how you glossed over "superimposition" before.<br>
What exactly does that mean?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Clemenceau：</span><br>
Oh, I'm sorry~ The Commander accepted it so readily that I thought I didn't need to explain~<br>
The most apt way to describe this is, everything we see before us right now is simultaneously real and not real.<br>
Everything in Marco Polo's Paradise is a carbon copy of reality, much like a computer simulation of the real world.<br>
However, through her ritual, she was able to layer that simulacrum on top of the real world, which is also exactly what that mycelium-like substance is trying to do.<br>
You could say it's like making art by putting a layer mask on top of the specific part of a canvas you'd like to change.<br>
You're not painting on the canvas itself. Likewise, it doesn't affect the real world on its own.<br>
But when her God descends, the two superimposed worlds will become one reality, causing the art on the mask to overwrite what's on the canvas.<br>
When that happens, will the original reality be trimmed away like a branch?<br>
Or will the two worlds mix, creating a new one?<br>
And what is the identity of Marco Polo's God?<br>
Frankly, the thought terrifies me, so I don't want to think about it. Heehee.<br>
<span style="color:#a020f0;">Memphis META：</span><br>
The center of the abnormality is definitely the location where Marco Polo's throne fell.<br>
Based on the circumstantial evidence I've seen so far... it seems likely that the enemy we've been fighting to this point is there.<br>
Calling that into this world is nothing short of insane.<br>
If you worked with Marco Polo all this time, knowing full well the extent of her plans...<br>
Then there is no way I can trust you.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Clemenceau：</span><br>
I don't mind.<br>
I lead a shady organization called the Tribunal, I've worked with the cause of all this mess, and I've even displayed active hostility by sending mass-produced ships to attack you.<br>
However, Memphis META, I would think that none of this would matter to you.<br>
Should you not understand the value of my plan?<br>
If you really wanted to help the Commander, then you'd push for a decision instead of arguing.<br>
Regardless, I have some final adjustments to make to the network, so I'll let you handle persuading everyone.<br>
Understood, "that girl who likes the Commander a little TOO much"?<br>

<span style="color:#a020f0;">Memphis META：</span><br>
......<br>
Clemenceau is right about the reality anchors. Her plan is likely the best option we've got.<br>
It's more practical and has higher odds of success than what I had in mind.<br>
As much as I hate to admit it, we should move forward with her plan.<br>
In the meantime, I'll keep a close eye on her until all of this has been resolved.<br>
<br>
I discussed Clemenceau's plan with Memphis META and members of all factions, and we all came to a consensus.<br>
From there, we swiftly moved on to discussing tactics and contacting all parties across the Mediterranean.<br>
...At last, every shipgirl we could get in touch with had been mobilized.<br>
On my command, shipgirls across Gibraltar, Malta, Toulon, Taranto, Rome, and Venice all activated the Skybound Wall at their respective locations.<br>
The remaining reality anchor in northern Sardegna would be dealt with after Littorio finished up in Venice.<br>
There was an additional anchor in Iris Orthodoxy territory, which Richelieu and her fleet were tasked with securing.<br>
While many of their positions had been caught up in Reenactments, the Naval HQ was effectively on lockdown due to the Divine Vestige, so they would reclaim these at the same time.<br>
Then, there were the reality anchors in Africa...<br>
The map Clemenceau showed us used old place names such as Algeria and Carthage. According to her, it was tied to the anchors' concept.<br>
Since we had confirmed travel was possible to those locations via the network, it wouldn't impede our operation.<br>
For the time being, we simply stuck with the names that were on the map.<br>
These anchors would be dealt with by two forces – the Royal Navy, and Iron Blood.<br>
The Royals would handle the Algeria anchor, as they were closest to it.<br>
As for the Carthage anchor, Eugen would lead a fleet to rendezvous with the Royal Navy in Malta, then travel through the network and secure it.<br>
Finally, there were the anchors east of the Mediterranean. Unfortunately, we didn't have the forces necessary to capture them right away.<br>
I considered rerouting the forces near that black hole, but it would be best to keep them close by in the event of an emergency.<br>
<span style="color:#a020f0;">Memphis META：</span><br>
We don't have much time left.<br>
The Divine Vestige is spreading faster than I expected. It's reached places even beyond the Mediterranean.<br>
I'm sorry that I can't help you with the anchors. I have my hands full keeping Helena and her team posted.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Essex：</span><br>
It seems our only option is to divert some of the forces defending the pavilion.<br>
But we can't divert too many, or else we can't defend ourselves against the enemy if they converge on us.<br>
We can't just move all our mission-critical communications equipment, and we need a sizable force to keep the Commander safe...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Vittorio Veneto：</span><br>
Andrea's fleet remains unreachable due to the sandstorm in the region...<br>
Commander, if at all possible, can't we start with the anchor in Alexandria?<br>
I want to know if our fleet there is safe. After we've extracted them, we could send them to capture some of the anchors in the east.<br>
<br>
"You make a great point, actually. I should bump up their rescue on our list of priorities."<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Communicator：</span><br>
BEEP—<br>
<br>
Right then, a call rang on the private channel of my communicator.<br>
(It's... Sovetsky Soyuz?!)<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Sovetsky Soyuz：</span><br>
I'm so glad to hear your voice, Comrade Commander. I hope you're safe and sound.<br>
Truth be told, I'm in the Black Sea right now on official business, and I've gotten swept up in the same situation as you.<br>
I've heard about what is happening through my comrades, and the Northern Parliament gladly offers you its aid.<br>
If you don't mind, could you tell me what your plan is?<br>
<br>
I explained the situation and my plan to her over the communicator.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Sovetsky Soyuz：</span><br>
I see. We can take care of the reality anchors in Constantinople and the Aegean Sea.<br>
Our fleet shall take the Bosphorus strait to the Aegean Sea. There, we will complete all the outlined mission objectives.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Clemenceau：</span><br>
Soyuz, may I interject?<br>
I'd like to know about our dear blueprint ship. Has she mastered her rigging yet?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Sovetsky Soyuz：</span><br>
She has become proficient, at least. In fact, she's the reason I came to the Black Sea.<br>
I've already drafted her for this operation to bolster our forces. I hope you don't mind.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Clemenceau：</span><br>
Not at all. This is a perfect opportunity to test her abilities.<br>
<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项1："Who are you talking about? Champagne?"</span>'''''<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Clemenceau：</span><br>
Mhm. Let's just say there were some things with her rigging we had to work out.<br>
I must say, Soyuz, this was brilliant timing. You're the last person I expected to hear from.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Sovetsky Soyuz：</span><br>
Call it providence, if you will... In reality, it's Champagne's own hard work.<br>
Her rigging is ready, and she has a solid grasp on her new equipment. She is more than suited for battle.<br>
You'll reunite with her later, but for now, she'll be accompanying us for a brief while.<br>
Now, it's for me to go. Let us meet later at the World Expo, Comrade Commander.<br>
<br>
(What is a Northern Parliament fleet doing in the Black Sea? Last I heard, they were engaged in a major offensive against the Sirens in the Arctic Sea...)<br>
(Let's see if Clemenceau has any answers.)<br>
<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项1：(Ask her about Champagne.)</span>'''''<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项2：(Ask her about Soyuz.)</span>'''''<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Clemenceau：</span><br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项1）</span>'''''It's nothing complicated. She's part of a collaboration between Vichya and the Northern Parliament. Don't you encourage us to work together all the time?<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项1）</span>'''''Or is it her timing you're asking about? You think that it's too convenient, hmm?<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项1）</span>'''''Are you wondering why a blueprint ship is about to show up now, and if I had any role to play in that? Or, do you have questions about why she hasn't shown up until now?<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项1）</span>'''''Certainly valid questions, but aren't you putting the cart before the horse? We have a God to stop, after all~<br>
<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项2）</span>'''''(...Actually, no. There's no reason Champagne would know anything about the Northern Parliament's major offensive.)<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项2）</span>'''''(If Clemenceau's just going to dance around the subject, I might as well not even ask.)<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Littorio：</span><br>
Veneto! I've returned!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Vittorio Veneto：</span><br>
Littorio! Thank goodness! Are you hurt anywhere?!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Littorio：</span><br>
No. Even if I was, we'll have time for sisterly love later.<br>
It'll take a crisis of greater magnitude than this to break my spirit.<br>
Now, on to my report – the Skybound Wall in Venice has been activated. The other one will follow shortly.<br>
Then, there's our fleet in Alexandria which you're worried about. Sadly, I don't know anything about their situation.<br>
What I do know is that we have a soldier at the Suez Canal which we can mobilize.<br>
Carabiniere. I sent her there on a... let's say, diplomatic mission.<br>
Commander, may I borrow your communicator?<br>
<br>
(I wonder why she hesitated for a moment when talking about her...)<br>
(That's not important at the moment, though. What we need is more manpower, and soon. I'll have Littorio call Carabiniere home.)<br>
(Although, while we need all the help we can get, we'll need a lot more than just her.)<br>
(Think, me, think. Isn't there anyone who could come to our aid at a moment's notice?)<br>
<span style="color:#ff9900;">Hiryuu META：</span><br>
Then it's time to bid farewell. With the Arbiters gone, we have no reason to stick together.<br>
In order to get out of this Singularity, head to the exit I told you about earlier, and you should be fine.<br>
I do hope we can meet again someday. Under what circumstances, I don't know. Maybe we'll share a heartfelt reunion, or we'll exchange blows as enemies.<br>
<br>
"Wait. What about the thing you said before our duel earlier?"<br>
<span style="color:#ff9900;">Hiryuu META：</span><br>
Ah, I did say I'd tell you something you're going to like, didn't I? Don't worry, I remember our deal.<br>
Since you and your fleet managed to stay standing by the end of it all, I'll let you in on something good.<br>
...You know what, I'll just give it to you directly...<br>
<br>
Hiryuu reached behind her back and staggered over to me.<br>
<span style="color:#ff9900;">Hiryuu META：</span><br>
Don't worry, I'll be in touch.<br>
No, really. I already know your contact code and where your port is.<br>
<br>
(That's right! Back during Operation Siren, Hiryuu from the Ashes gave me her contact code.)<br>
(I've always felt hesitant to use it – until now. Let's see if she answers.)<br>

East Mediterranean Sea - Suez Canal<br>
Meanwhile, with Carabiniere...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Littorio：</span><br>
Carabiniere, are you alright?! Where are you?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Carabiniere：</span><br>
Right here! I'm fine! I've just plunged into the affected region with the Dragon Empery fleet!<br>
Are you doing okay, Lady Littorio?! Something awful has happened... not just at the World Expo, but across the whole Mediterranean!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Littorio：</span><br>
I'm just fine. Let's be brief here.<br>
First: what do you mean when you say you've just plunged into the affected region?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Carabiniere：</span><br>
Right, so, I was in the middle of a tea party with the Dragon Empery representatives by the canal.<br>
That was when Chen Hai noticed that something was wrong. She asked me to contact the Sardegnian mainland...<br>
I couldn't get through, though, so I asked the Dragon Empery reps to return to the venue with me!<br>
And now, umm... We've just entered a sea region covered in a weird substance.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Littorio：</span><br>
I see... No wonder you couldn't get through to them. You were outside of the anomaly.<br>
The Dragon Empery shipgirls are with you, right? Carabiniere, connect me to Chen Hai.<br>
Commander, we have the Dragon Empery fleet.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Chen Hai：</span><br>
I've been informed of the situation. You've clearly been hard at work...<br>
Our forces here are enough. Leave the anchor near the canal to us.<br>
One more thing: I hear the Skybound Wall in Alexandria was activated.<br>
We have no idea what's going on there. The sandstorm still hasn't stopped...<br>
You don't know, either? Then we'll just have to leave it aside and hope for the best for now.<br>
We'll do what we can to help investigate. If we learn anything, I'll call you right away.<br>
I pray for your good fortune. Goodbye.<br>

Soyuz, can we keep going forward?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Sovetsky Soyuz：</span><br>
Slow down, now. Don't stray from the rest of the fleet.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Stremitelny ：</span><br>
Okay!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Sovetsky Soyuz：</span><br>
Have you finished collecting data?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Kronshtadt：</span><br>
Yes, Comrade. It's done.<br>
I have a feeling this data could be instrumental in advancing Northern Parliament technology.<br>
She obliterates the enemy, AND she gives us ample data. I'd call that two birds with one stone.<br>
...To be frank, though, I wish we could collect data under more normal circumstances.<br>
Preparing conceptual anchors over such a large area... Marco Polo was as thorough as can be.<br>
Yet our Intelligence Bureau never caught wind of her preparations.<br>
Europa has gotten too lax. We need to tighten up in the future.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Sovetsky Soyuz：</span><br>
It isn't all their fault, Kronshtadt.<br>
The members of the Tribunal are masters of information manipulation... especially her.<br>
You, me, the Royal Navy, Iron Blood. She tricked all of us.<br>
No doubt Her Majesty and Bismarck are panicking, too. I'd love to see their faces right now.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Kronshtadt：</span><br>
By "her," do you mean Marco Polo?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Sovetsky Soyuz：</span><br>
No. Tribunal representative Clemenceau.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Kronshtadt：</span><br>
Clemenceau of the Vichya Dominion... I've never dealt with her face-to-face, but I hear all of the Tribunal's agents are forces to be reckoned with.<br>
If you acknowledge her to that extent, then I'm sure she's quite capable.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Sovetsky Soyuz：</span><br>
(The Vichya Dominion, hm...?)<br>
(What will happen to them when this is resolved and we have peace again?)<br>

Ashes Fleet<br>
The Singularity in the NA Ocean, formerly the site of a bloody battle, was quiet now.<br>
Only the eternally-burning flames that rose above the wreckage told the story of its violent past.<br>
<span style="color:#ff9900;">Hiryuu META：</span><br>
We've been monitoring this door for some time.<br>
You don't think Enterprise has forgotten us, do you?<br>
<span style="color:#ff9900;">Ark Royal META：</span><br>
Don't grumble, Hiryuu. It's strategically vital that we protect this Singularity as long as it lets us leap to other branches.<br>
Besides, it's Enterprise you're talking about. She wouldn't cast aside her fellow Ashes.<br>
<span style="color:#ff9900;">Hiryuu META：</span><br>
Maybe not normally, Ark Royal, but that doesn't mean you can be certain.<br>
Don't be fooled by the way Enterprise acts.<br>
She may look cool and collected all the time... but her emotions aren't as stable as you might think.<br>
<span style="color:#ff9900;">Ark Royal META：</span><br>
You mean... there's a problem with her hull?<br>
<span style="color:#ff9900;">Hiryuu META：</span><br>
That's not what I meant. Even if we all have our issues, she's not necessarily suffering from the same thing.<br>
What I'm talking about... is a mental thing.<br>
She's been pushing herself this whole time, fighting nonstop. She's never been able to put down her weapons or have a moment of relaxation.<br>
Truth be told, I'm worried about her.<br>
<span style="color:#ff9900;">Ark Royal META：</span><br>
That so...? I guess I haven't fought with her as long as you have.<br>
Come to think of it, you've been working with her since before your METAmorphosis, haven't you?<br>
Everything you said about her... Isn't that also true for you?<br>
<span style="color:#ff9900;">Hiryuu META：</span><br>
Please. Do I look okay to you?<br>
Having that said... I suppose I might be a bit better at decompressing.<br>
Or, maybe I just have a more philosophical view of things.<br>
Sometimes... the more we try to find redemption for our past lives, the deeper a hole we dig.<br>
It's like drinking poison to quench your thirst.<br>
I'm just... a lot better at giving up than her.<br>
...That said, if I sat still and did nothing forever...<br>
My mental state would surely break down sooner or later, and I'd turn into one of those kaiju you see in Sakuran movies.<br>
Rooooar! Gaaaawr!<br>
<span style="color:#ff9900;">Ark Royal META：</span><br>
Okay, calm down...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Communicator：</span><br>
BEEP—<br>

Royal Navy Rally Point Temporary Malta Base<br>
Before the conceptual anchor operation<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Prinz Eugen：</span><br>
Lalala~♪ La la la laaa~♫<br>
Whoooa~ It's the Royal Navy Malta base~<br>
C'mon, what's the big deal? We don't have a Reenactment hanging over our heads or anything. Not gonna let a girl in just because she's from Iron Blood?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Nelson：</span><br>
...*sigh*...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Prinz Eugen：</span><br>
Oh, if it isn't Nelson. Aren't you going to welcome me?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Nelson：</span><br>
You're something else...<br>
*sigh*...<br>
Welcome to the Royal Navy's Malta base. Hooray. Happy?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Prinz Eugen：</span><br>
Ahahaha~♪ That's exactly what I wanted to hear!<br>
Z2 would tell me to restrain myself if she were here, but too bad—she's with the Commander.<br>
That means I can tease you as much as I want. Heheheh!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Odin：</span><br>
So this is Prinz Eugen...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Prinz Rupprecht：</span><br>
Why are you looking at me? I swear, I've totally never met this woman in my life...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Nelson：</span><br>
Don't get carried away, Prinz Eugen. It's thanks to the Commander that we can still fight.<br>
I welcome you not as Iron Blood shipgirls, but as reinforcements the Commander kindly sent.<br>
Yeah, that feels better...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Rodney：</span><br>
Now, now. Illustrious did invite them to convene here at Malta whenever they liked.<br>
You're not just reinforcements. You're all innocents caught up in the World Expo catastrophe.<br>
Welcome to our Malta stronghold, Iron Blood!<br>

<br>
Somewhere in the Mediterranean Sea...<br>
Royal Navy Fleet<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">London：</span><br>
Lady Warspite, we've been informed that the Iron Blood fleet has arrived at our Malta stronghold.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Warspite：</span><br>
Imagine that. Iron Blood setting foot on Malta not as enemies, but as temporary allies.<br>
Knowing Prinz Eugen, she must already be messing with the girls stationed there.<br>
This must be a real headache for Rodney and Nelson, given their upcoming roles in the operation.<br>
Where are they heading, again? "Carthage," was it?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">London：</span><br>
Yes. I believe it's an ancient city off the North African coast.<br>
I wonder why Marco Polo put a conceptual anchor there, so far away from home.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Warspite：</span><br>
Likely as part of her plan. Or, possibly, the God guiding her actions made the decision.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Communicator：</span><br>
BEEP—<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Prinz Eugen：</span><br>
Hey, Warspite. How are things coming along over there? Want us to help?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Warspite：</span><br>
*sigh*... Thanks for keeping in touch, but no.<br>
Our fleet is currently en route to Djemila, as per the Commander's orders.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Prinz Eugen：</span><br>
You sure? Because I feel there's a better way to make use of your force.<br>
Carthage and Djemila aren't that far apart, and the enemies between them are no big deal.<br>
Our fleet and your Malta fleet are enough to deal with them.<br>
So, what I'm thinking is – we'll take care of Djemila, and you can go give Richelieu backup instead.<br>
Think about it. The Tribunal made the conceptual anchors, and they've surely built better defenses to protect them on their own turf.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Warspite：</span><br>
Hold on. This isn't about the Royal Navy or Iron Blood. This is the Commander's operation.<br>
I know you like to skirt around rules, but are you really going to flat-out ignore orders from the Commander?<br>
We, not you, were given the task of dealing with this conceptual anchor, and we intended to complete it.<br>
Furthermore, I just got word that Richelieu's fleet is making good, steady progress.<br>
We don't need to rush to her aid. Ultimately, this conflict is something they have to resolve internally.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Prinz Eugen：</span><br>
Fair enough. Just thought I'd mention it.<br>
It's also worth pointing out the Commander never specified a next task after we capture Carthage.<br>
In other words, we'll become a reserve force. If you don't want us stealing work from you, you better be quick♪<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Warspite：</span><br>
...The audacity of that–<br>
Knights of the Royal Navy! Iron Blood has issued us a challenge.<br>
And we – we shall answer. All ships, raise your speed! For the glory of the Royal family!<br>

<br>
With the battle in Toulon over, Iris Libre and the Vichya Dominion regrouped. They then used the network to quickly travel to an inland river in Iris territory.<br>
Since some of the anchors had been placed on land, the shipgirls would have to leave the comfort of the sea. They were in for an uphill battle.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Lyon：</span><br>
It seems this river is as close as we'll get, even with advanced Siren technology.<br>
I still have my reservations about using these devices, even if we have no other option.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">La Galissonnière：</span><br>
Look on the bright side – it also means this is as close as the Sirens can go.<br>
Would be impossible to protect our cities if they could teleport anywhere.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Richelieu：</span><br>
Béarn, what is there around us?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Béarn：</span><br>
For one, no sign of the enemy. There is one thing, though...<br>
I've had this suspicion that the Divine Vestige may appear in the water as well, ever since the Sakura-Iris mixed fleet ran into that "black hole."<br>
However, that appears not to be the case. It propagates on land and in the air, but not through water.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Richelieu：</span><br>
Yes, now that you mention it, I don't remember seeing much water covered in that substance.<br>
Even here, where it has reached the riverbanks, it hasn't seeped into the river itself yet.<br>
While, we may never know why that is, I'm glad we have a means to travel directly from sea to river.<br>
(Now to get to the Holy See's palace in Avignon, where we'll find that conceptual anchor.)<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Painlevé：</span><br>
Lady Richelieu! Lady Richelieu! There's a strange space blocking our route.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Béarn：</span><br>
Strange place? Huh... You mean the pitch-black area? Yes, I can see it as well.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Jean Bart：</span><br>
Pretty damn big... Doubt we can just walk around it. What do we do?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Richelieu：</span><br>
We have no time to waste. Let me try something...<br>
(The conceptual anchor isn't far. Maybe this trick will work here.)<br>
"Let there be light."<br>
<br>
Richelieu uttered a verse, and the holy banner in her hand began releasing a brilliant light.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Jean Bart：</span><br>
Did you just make your flag glow?<br>
How'd you manage to do that?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Richelieu：</span><br>
The anchors are sacraments that reinforce concepts. With a strong enough conviction, we can make some little miracles of our own.<br>
Everyone, follow me. The light will cut through the darkness.<br>
<br>
The girls gathered inside the space lit by holy light, continuing to wade through the darkness bubbling up from the river.<br>
Not long afterwards, a shadowy figure came into view.<br>
<span style="color:#696969;">Marco Polo?：</span><br>
At last! At long last!<br>
The final piece to complete my masterwork!<br>
The Crown of the Holy See is finally in my hands!<br>
This is what will put an end to all conflict!<br>
The Kingdom of God will descend upon the land!<br>
Eternal glory and virtue will envelop the world from pole to pole!<br>
Ohohohohoho! The Sirens are as good as a threat of the past!<br>
Yes! Those damned Sirens will bother me no more!<br>
Because God shall come down to us!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Marseillaise：</span><br>
I can't believe my ears... Marco Polo truly DID steal the Crown!<br>
Our holy Crown, our most sacred artifact... She must be punished for her blasphemy!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Jean Bart：</span><br>
Put your pitchfork down, Marseillaise. Somethin' was clearly not right with her.<br>
Either she lost her mind, or someone was manipulating her.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Richelieu：</span><br>
Clemenceau did remark that she thought Marco Polo had lost it at some point, but by then it was too late.<br>
It's best to assume her god influenced her, warped her very thoughts.<br>
There's no point in listening to this deceitful phantom, at any rate. I will dispel it with the Holy Iris's light.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Jean Bart：</span><br>
No, wait! If it works anything like the black hole Jeanne's fleet encountered, we'll be in deep shit if we attack it!<br>
And, what if the phantom actually IS Marco Polo?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Richelieu：</span><br>
Don't worry, Jean Bart. I'm not about to make any reckless decisions.<br>
However, it's dangerous to simply leave it be. We cannot turn a blind eye to the contamination Memphis META spoke about. Furthermore–<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Jean Bart：</span><br>
Damn, bastard's deployed its rigging. Fighting it is, then!<br>
<br>
KABOOOM!<br>
After a short but fierce battle, Marco Polo's phantom sank to its knees in the water.<br>
<span style="color:#696969;">Marco Polo?：</span><br>
It's always you...<br>
You pay lip service to uniting our faiths, yet you always stand on opposite sides...<br>
Damned heretics...<br>
■■■... is the true Orthodoxy...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Richelieu：</span><br>
You say the Orthodoxy's legitimacy comes from faith... But does faith put food on the table? What is faith without the support of the people?<br>
Ashes to ashes, dust to dust.<br>
O phantom of a false god and zeal made incarnate – return to naught.<br>
<br>
With these words, Marco Polo's phantom disintegrated, along with the region of darkness.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Richelieu：</span><br>
Now, come. Let us go to the palace where the conceptual anchor is kept.<br>

<br>
After activating the Skybound Wall at Avignon's conceptual anchor, Richelieu's team discussed their next move.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Richelieu：</span><br>
Our mission in Avignon is done. However...<br>
It took too much time. At this rate, we won't be able to tune the remaining anchors.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Lyon：</span><br>
Cardinal Richelieu, shall I make the call for all of our warriors to come forward?<br>
There are also Vichyan forces that have not been convinced to fight with us so far. If we are able to win them over...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Richelieu：</span><br>
Indeed... I had the same thought just now.<br>
But unfortunately, my title as Cardinal does not necessarily have much sway back home.<br>
I've spent quite a long time away from home, and not everyone will eagerly flock to join in our cause.<br>
Despite the risks involved, I believe our best course of action is to split up. Failure is not an option.<br>
I will contact whoever I can in the Holy City. Jean Bart, you'll go northwest to Bretagne; and Marseillaise, you'll go north to Normandy.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Marseillaise：</span><br>
As you wish, Cardinal.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Jean Bart：</span><br>
Cardinal, the fleet from Toulon has been battling endlessly. Many of them are in no condition to keep fighting.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Richelieu：</span><br>
Then I would ask that you have them use the node near Avignon to return to the venue.<br>
I will ask Jeanne's fleet to provide assistance.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Jean Bart：</span><br>
Appreciate it. That takes a lot of the pressure off our shoulders.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Richelieu：</span><br>
Good. What happens next... depends on whether we can get our sisters and compatriots to trust our words.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Communicator：</span><br>
BEEP—<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Tartu：</span><br>
Cardinal Richelieu, this is Tartu with the Vichya Dominion Special Mobile Fleet.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Richelieu：</span><br>
(Special Mobile Fleet...?)<br>
Perfect timing. Tartu, where is your fleet currently?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Tartu：</span><br>
We're at Amiens Cathedral now.<br>
Lady Clemenceau has just informed the Tribunal and Vichyan fleet of the situation through secret communications lines.<br>
She asked that we work with you to activate the Skybound Walls at the conceptual anchors.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Richelieu：</span><br>
What of Iron Blood leadership? Have they left forces behind?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Tartu：</span><br>
She said she'd handle them personally, so we should concentrate on our own problems.<br>
Also, Cardinal, she complimented your speech at Saint Helena.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Richelieu：</span><br>
...So Le Terrible told her about the speech, too.<br>
She just doesn't know how to mind her own business. Heehee.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Le Mars：</span><br>
Le Mars reporting in. Cardinal Richelieu, I have a message for you!<br>
The Skybound Wall near Reims has been activated! The Templar Knights will stand by until given further orders!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Le Malin：</span><br>
This is Le Malin speaking. We've also activated the Skybound Wall at the Holy City's anchor. Awaiting orders.<br>
<br>
Lights signalling the successful activation of the Skybound Walls sprang to life on the map one after another.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Marseillaise：</span><br>
What a beautiful sight...<br>
Cardinal Richelieu, we're taking back Vichya—no, all of the Iris Orthodoxy.<br>
It won't be long before we're one again.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Richelieu：</span><br>
Yes... Just a little longer.<br>
Mont-Saint-Michel and the capital are all that remain.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Jean Bart：</span><br>
Don't worry about Mont-Saint-Michel.<br>
Strasbourg's team was already nearby, so they'll have it taken care of before long.<br>
...And there you have it. Mont-Saint-Michel's conceptual anchor is shining light toward the Vichya pavilion now.<br>
Wouldn't have killed them to say something, though.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Richelieu：</span><br>
I understand. Thank you, Jean Bart.<br>
Then all that's left is the capital.<br>
Our final objective is the Iris Orthodoxy's Holy City, taken from us by the Reenactments.<br>
Friends of a unified Iris Orthodoxy, listen well. Once you have completed your current tasks, assemble in our capital.<br>
Before we join the Commander at the World Expo venue, we must unify our forces.<br>
As one glorious Iris Orthodoxy!<br>

<br>
World Expo Venue - Vichya Pavilion<br>
Temporary Command Room<br>
Rays of light shot from each anchor's Skybound Wall, converging in the sky above the Vichya pavilion.<br>
Dazzling, divine light shone upon the center of the anomaly like rays of hope.<br>
Shipgirls who'd finished their missions returned one after another to the venue through the microlayer network.<br>
The maintenance facilities for the shipgirls gathered in the venue were working overtime.<br>
By now, nearly all of the enemies in the area, save for those around the black hole, had been eradicated.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Clemenceau：</span><br>
Three remaining targets. Two... One...<br>
That's all of them.<br>
<br>
The transference device lit up, and finally...<br>
The fleet led by Richelieu returned.<br>
Their fleet was organized without separation between the once separated factions, with all the dignity worthy of the reunited Iris Orthodoxy name.<br>
But they weren't alone—at this very moment, this venue now hosted the full Azur Lane fleet.<br>
The Eagle Union, Royal Navy, Iron Blood, Sakura Empire, Iris Orthodoxy, Dragon Empery, Northern Parliament, Sardegna Empire, and even META from beyond space-time...<br>
The grand fleet was preparing for its decisive battle, and in addition–<br>
The Spear of Destiny, the key to striking down the false God, was also in its final preparations.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Clemenceau：</span><br>
When two concepts smash into each other head-on, one will be overwritten. All or nothing.<br>
If it goes well, this fleet might never need to step out onto the stage.<br>
If it doesn't, however, you might find yourself wishing you'd brought more friends, Commander.<br>
Final checks complete. All conceptual anchor signals confirmed. Awaiting your final order to launch the Spear of Destiny.<br>
<br>
Though surprised by Clemenceau's sudden seriousness, I gave the order.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Clemenceau：</span><br>
Heehee. You need to have a sense of ceremony when the situation calls for it.<br>
Activating the Spear of Destiny system.<br>
Now, let's shoot that false God right between the eyes!<br>
<br>
Lights from all over the world seemed to converge in one point above the Vichya pavilion, forming a radiant lance of pure energy.<br>
It blazed like the sun, glorious and pure. All who beheld it were overwhelmed with awe.<br>
The concept of true divinity collided into the abyssal darkness of the false God's cocoon–<br>
.........<br>
The energy from the conceptual anchors flickered and waned, already squeezed to its limit. Just as the last spark of light from the anchors faded, the outer shell of the darkness covering the cocoon split open.<br>
Light and darkness alike disappeared, and peace—<br>
—did not return to the sea.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Essex：</span><br>
We've broken through the cocoon's outer layer!<br>
B-but, an even bigger Gazer seems to be coming out of it!<br>
And that's not all! The Gazers around us are changing their behavioral patterns!<br>
They're all moving to where the cocoon was! Could that Gazer be...?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Illustrious：</span><br>
Indeed. The situation appears to be as bad as you fear.<br>
The Gazer that just came out of the cocoon... may well be the false God itself.<br>
Clemenceau... is this what you were trying to accomplish?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Clemenceau：</span><br>
I was hoping for a more decisive victory than this...<br>
But unfortunately, it took every bit of energy from the conceptual anchors just to neutrallize the darkness.<br>
Though we've pierced through the protection of the false God, we must face the brunt of its wrath ourselves.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Essex：</span><br>
Commander! Clemenceau! We're ready to fight at any time!<br>
Don't worry about things not going to plan! We've already dealt that thing a devastating blow it definitely wasn't expecting!<br>
Now's the time to press our advantage and finish it off once and for all!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Richelieu：</span><br>
With the powers of conceptual manifestation counteracting each other here, this comes down to an old-fashioned gunfight. Commander, the Iris fleet awaits your orders!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Illustrious：</span><br>
The Royal Navy has assembled. We are ready for your instructions at any time.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Sovetsky Soyuz：</span><br>
Likewise. The Northern Parliament stands behind your decision, Comrade Commander.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Chen Hai：</span><br>
The Dragon Empery fleet is ready as well, Commander. Let us work together towards victory!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Shinano ：</span><br>
The Sakura Empire and Iron Blood fleets... will stand with you during this decisive battle.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Vittorio Veneto：</span><br>
Likewise, Sardegna stands ready. Let us make an example of those who would trample upon our dignity and splendor!<br>
<span style="color:#a020f0;">Memphis META：</span><br>
We shouldn't underestimate the power of a God that Antiochus cannot slay. It might have more tricks up its sleeve.<br>
Having that said, we're also strong. I trust that we'll pull through this crisis, especially with Helena's support.<br>
<span style="color:#ff9900;">Hiryuu META：</span><br>
I might know what thing really is... No, we'll know for sure when we fight. Commander, you may not be there in person, but we're counting on your support!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Clemenceau：</span><br>
Commander, I've played my final trump card. No more tricks, no more contingency plans. My life is now in your hands.<br>
Defeat that false God, and lead us all to victory!<br>

<br>
The massive fleet, comprised of shipgirls from all factions, set out. They closed in on the false God from several different directions.<br>
<span style="color:#a020f0;">Memphis META：</span><br>
Our vanguard has scattered the enemy in our way. We'll be in position to directly attack God soon.<br>
<span style="color:#ff9900;">Hiryuu META：</span><br>
It's been so long since I fought like this! I'll launch the first attack!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Essex：</span><br>
They're giving us some trouble up in the sky...<br>
But we're no slouches either. In addition to airplanes, we also have – err – airships on our side.<br>
It won't be long before we've secured aerial superiority!<br>
<br>
Essex fumbled her sentence because of the word "airships."<br>
No wonder, because when Roma's team came flying over with a whole armada of them, it caused quite a stir among the shipgirls.<br>
They came from under the Colosseum, where the Sirens had left a production facility, which our local genius da Vinci took control of.<br>
Apparently, they only worked in this anomalous space and would disintegrate if taken outside it.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Roma：</span><br>
Do not flinch! Do not fear injury!<br>
Come, my steel eagles, and destroy our enemies!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Essex：</span><br>
Roma! You're on the Commander's channel!<br>
...She can't hear me, can she? Ugh... Excuse me, Commander, I'll call you back later!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Memphis：</span><br>
The mission is going well on all fronts.<br>
Our vanguard has already eliminated the God's small fry.<br>
The Gazers coming in from the surrounding waters are getting knocked down one after the next. They can't break through our defenses.<br>
The only real problem is the false God itself.<br>
It's just been sitting there for a while now. It's possible the Spear of Destiny did actual damage to it, and not just the cocoon.<br>
As per orders, we'll now enter the next phase.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Shinano ：</span><br>
Then this one shall attack as well.<br>
Whether it's the Commander's presence or this domain affecting me, I feel ready to take on anything...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Clemenceau：</span><br>
No. You mustn't.<br>
If eliminating that God is our victory condition, losing the Commander is our defeat condition.<br>
Without the Commander, our coordination will break down, and our morale will plummet – yours included. Ensuring the Commander's safety is number one.<br>
Furthermore, doesn't the Sakuran fleet need you and your abilities to command it?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Shinano ：</span><br>
A good point. This one shall remain here...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Memphis：</span><br>
As instructed, the vanguard will now launch an attack on God.<br>
...That had no effect. On the bright side, it didn't retaliate.<br>
The rest of the forces have reached attacking positions. Your orders, Commander?<br>
<br>
"Focus your fire on that false God."<br>
"It's time to make our next move."<br>

<br>
All of a sudden, I heard a girl's emotionless, mechanical voice inside of my head.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Illustrious：</span><br>
What on earth was that?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Duca degli Abruzzi：</span><br>
I feel like... I'm slowing down. My rigging's grind to a halt!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Kronshtadt：</span><br>
Mine, too! Commander, we're all affected by whatever this is!<br>
<span style="color:#ff9900;">Hiryuu META：</span><br>
Same here. I can't... move... Urgh...<br>
Argh! Ark Royal! My head!<br>
<span style="color:#ff9900;">Ark Royal META：</span><br>
Damnit! The energy in my hull's going completely haywire!<br>
Memphis? Are you hanging in there?<br>
<span style="color:#a020f0;">Memphis META：</span><br>
Barely... Somehow, yeah...<br>
<br>
With but a single otherworldly word, the entire battlefield was gripped by an icy, death-like chill.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Shinano ：</span><br>
Did you hear that voice too? What manner of enchantment is this?<br>
<br>
"Yes. I can still move like normal. Whatever it is, it doesn't look like it affected me."<br>
"You don't look like it affected you much either, for that matter, Shinano."<br>
"Could it be that my command vessel is immune to this phenomenon?"<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Clemenceau：</span><br>
No, it's not. I'm affected, albeit it not to the same degree as the rest.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Shinano ：</span><br>
Most puzzling... So the effect varies from shipgirl to shipgirl...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Prinz Rupprecht：</span><br>
I'm basically fine. My arms and legs just feel a little heavy.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Odin：</span><br>
Likewise, I am still fit for battle. I feel hardly affected at all.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Essex：</span><br>
Same with the mass-produced ships... It's done practically nothing to them. They can still fight!<br>
<br>
(So the blueprint ships and the mass-produced ships aren't affected much, while the METAs are gravely affected.)<br>
(Among everyone on the command ship, only Shinano hasn't been affected at all.)<br>
<span style="color:#a020f0;">Memphis META：</span><br>
It doesn't seem like my hull's being corrupted, but...<br>
I've felt this pain before... It feels like the exact same thing...<br>
<span style="color:#ff9900;">Hiryuu META：</span><br>
Urgh... I'm... all but certain... that it's the same thing...<br>
Commander... Is it too late to retreat now...?<br>
<span style="color:#a020f0;">Memphis META：</span><br>
Retreat? You're just gonna run away, Hiryuu?!<br>
<span style="color:#ff9900;">Hiryuu META：</span><br>
I'm not talking about me... We all... need to get out of here... before it's too late!<br>
<span style="color:#a020f0;">Memphis META：</span><br>
Haha.. Sorry...<br>
But if we run away with the Commander... what will happen to this experimental field...?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Clemenceau：</span><br>
Whatever you're thinking, we cannot have you take the Commander from us.<br>
We're lucky a certain someone here has barely been affected...<br>
Gascogne! Force a direct connection into cognitive space!<br>
<br>
A black sun, quietly burning in the dusky sky.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Shinano ：</span><br>
The black sun...<br>
This is that other sacrament Marco Polo received from God...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Clemenceau：</span><br>
Correct. The problem with it is that's nigh-impossible to control.<br>
How is everyone? Can you move freely?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Shimakaze：</span><br>
Yes! Thank you kindly, Clemenceau!<br>
<span style="color:#a020f0;">Memphis META：</span><br>
Forcibly connecting minds to a separate conceptual space to protect against an anti-conceptual weapon in reality. That must've taken a huge amount of energy...<br>
Depending on how you use it, it can even affect your opponent's mind...<br>
(This is Arbiter-level technology. Can we even be sure this space doesn't connect to somewhere else?)<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Vittorio Veneto：</span><br>
So if understand correctly... the black sun is actually located in a cognitive plane of existence...?<br>
How are we supposed to get back from here?<br>
<span style="color:#696969;">▅H▊▇ro▅■ph▇▆▅：</span><br>
▅■one▆▅<br>
<br>
For the first time since the battle began, the Hierophant moved her body.<br>
She raised the wand in her hands high above her, then swung it down...<br>
...Instantly shattering the vision of the black sun like a glass pane.<br>
Just like that, she was in control of the world once more.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Clemenceau：</span><br>
The symbol of judgment was destroyed THAT easily?!<br>
Did we overload the connection? Or is this Arbiter simply that much stronger than it?<br>
<span style="color:#a020f0;">Memphis META：</span><br>
Neither. That wand... The ability to recognize and control concepts...<br>
This isn't just one of the Hierophant's vessels! She's here, in person!<br>
Be extremely careful! You do NOT want to be hit by attacks from that wand!<br>
It'll either turn you to dust, or if you're really unlucky, the very concept of your existence will be wiped from reality!<br>
<span style="color:#ff9900;">Hiryuu META：</span><br>
Good to know... Too bad I'm basically stuck in place!<br>
<span style="color:#a020f0;">Memphis META：</span><br>
At least those attacks are time-consuming and short-ranged... Commander, rush her with the mass-produced ships and organize a fleet out of the blueprint ships!<br>
The Hierophant's grip on everyone is letting up! Keep her busy while we get back on our feet!<br>
<br>
<br>
BOOOOM!<br>
Less-affected and recovering shipgirls fired their weapons as much as they could at the Hierophant.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Essex：</span><br>
The Hierophant is charging at the Commander!<br>
We have to stop her, and fast!<br>
<br>
Like a deity parting the waters, the Hierophant shrugged aside even the densest barrage of cannon fire, not even slowing down in the slightest.<br>
I saw her shadow cover my entire being, her wand bearing down on me––<br>
<span style="color:#a020f0;">Memphis META：</span><br>
No! We're not going to make it––<br>
Helena, what are you waiting for?!<br>
Change of plans! At least get the Commander out of here!<br>
<span style="color:#696969;">▅H▊▇ro▅■ph▇▆▅：</span><br>

<br>
As the Hierophant's wand came down, my vision was engulfed by the radiant web of lights coming from the drones surrounding her.<br>
I could not see. I could not feel. There was only light.<br>
BOOOOM!<br>
A portion of the horde of drones exploded.<br>
When the light cleared, every combatant in the area was wreathed in a barrier of warm blue light.<br>
<span style="color:#ff9900;">Helena META：</span><br>
"Please fight until the last light has faded."<br>
Memphis, you can't give up.<br>
<span style="color:#a020f0;">Memphis META：</span><br>
Helena, you—<br>
<span style="color:#ff9900;">Helena META：</span><br>
Calm down already.<br>
<span style="color:#ff9900;">Hiryuu META：</span><br>
Helena...? You can't be—<br>
<span style="color:#ff9900;">Helena META：</span><br>
A case of mistaken identity, I'm sure, Hiryuu of the Ashes.<br>
Any more questions, and I'll disable that barrier.<br>
<span style="color:#ff9900;">Hiryuu META：</span><br>
No, no! I get it! I won't say anything! I accept that you're not the Helena I'm thinking of!<br>
<span style="color:#ff9900;">Helena META：</span><br>
...I'm glad you understand.<br>
The Commander has done well to buy me enough time to arrive.<br>
The Devil's mainframe is no longer here, so you no longer have to worry about the supporting drones.<br>
This barrier should also help the others recover from the Hierophant's restraints much faster.<br>
As long as the barrier holds, you'll find that her conceptual attacks have little effect.<br>
...But know that it won't hold forever. You'd be wise to settle the score before it wears off.<br>
Also, be aware that the barrier won't protect you from direct attacks.<br>
Commander, please continue to lead this battle. I need more time to corner her.<br>
<span style="color:#ff9900;">Hiryuu META：</span><br>
The Hierophant was never made to fight a large number of enemies at once. This is the best chance we've got.<br>
Without the Devil's support and her strongest weapon neutrallized, the situation is within our grasp.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Vittorio Veneto：</span><br>
We hardly have to aim at her giant rigging, too.<br>
Though, it remains to be seen how effective our attacks are going to be...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Prinz Eugen：</span><br>
Heehee~ I'm sure the Commander will have no problems locating all her weak points~<br>
<br>
Everyone grasped at the glimmer of hope that had broken through the despair like parched travelers arriving at an oasis. The second wind that swept through the entire fleet was truly heartening to see.<br>
However, hope alone could not resolve the two main problems at hand.<br>
First, we haven't found an effective way of damaging the Hierophant so far.<br>
Second, and perhaps more importantly, everything rests on the assumption that we are fighting Arbiter: The Hierophant V. The assumption that she had not become something else.<br>
Even now, I could feel her overwhelming gaze upon me.<br>
It was an eerie, emotionless gaze. Even revolting.<br>
<span style="color:#696969;">▅H▊▇ro▅■ph▇▆▅：</span><br>

<span style="color:#ff9900;">Ark Royal META：</span><br>
Did the Hierophant just take off her rigging...?<br>
<span style="color:#a020f0;">Memphis META：</span><br>
She's accelerating! Commander, watch out!<br>
<br>
The Hierophant suddenly accelerated, unburdened by her rigging<br>
At lightning speed, faster than the other shipgirls could react, she arrived above the command ship. Nobody could stop her now—<br>
—save for Shinano, who was on the deck of the same ship.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Shinano ：</span><br>
This one won't let you...!<br>
<br>
In the next moment, I heard the sound of windchimes.<br>
BOOOOM!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Shinano ：</span><br>
This one's attack... struck...?<br>
<br>
The echoes of the windchimes continued to linger in my ears, unlike the ephemeral tones I had heard in my dreams before.<br>
Whereas nothing had been able to reach the Hierophant before, she was pushed back for the first time by the machine guns from Shinano's aircraft.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Shinano ：</span><br>
In that case... Let us see how you like this...!<br>

▅■split▆▅<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Shinano ：</span><br>
The Hierophant split in two...?! No! Commander!!<br>
<br>
Her shadow detached from her and formed a second copy that seemed to move with its own consciousness.<br>
The newly-born Hierophant slipped through the wall until she came face-to-face with me.<br>
<span style="color:#696969;">▅H▊▇ro▅■ph▇▆▅：</span><br>

<br>
An immense force violently sweeps my consciousness away, and I feel myself sinking deep into darkness.<br>
<br>
<br>
I took control over the mass-produced ships and used them as shields for the shipgirls who could still move. This was just enough to hold the line.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Saint Louis：</span><br>
Now there are aircraft coming after us! Commander, we need aerial support!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Hakuryuu：</span><br>
I've got you! I'm gonna swat those little mosquitos!<br>
<span style="color:#a020f0;">Memphis META：</span><br>
Wait... Are those the Devil's drones?!<br>
<br>
Countless drones appeared in the sky, emerging from nowhere just like the swarmers down at sea level.<br>
The drones – bearing the markings of the Devil XV – all encircled the Hierophant briefly before spreading out in all directions.<br>
Their formation almost resembled the shape of a spider web.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Hakuryuu：</span><br>
Hey! Where are you going?! Fight me!<br>
<br>
Disregarding Hakuryuu's provocation, the Hierophant once again raised her wand and lightly waved it in the direction of a single aircraft.<br>
It began glowing with a dazzling golden light that chained to nearby aircraft, forming a net of light.<br>
My worst fear had come to reality.<br>
The Devil, the master of support, was aiding her. It was clear this attack was targeting every single shipgirl on the battlefield at once.<br>
<span style="color:#696969;">▅H▊▇ro▅■ph▇▆▅：</span><br>

<span style="color:#a020f0;">Memphis META：</span><br>
A support protocol?!<br>
Everyone! Dodge, quick!<br>
<br>
We managed to move the mass-produced ships just in time to protect our recovering allies from the giant.<br>
However, the attack destroyed all of the mass-produced ships and even vaporized the Tribunal's conceptual weapon.<br>
<span style="color:#a020f0;">Memphis META：</span><br>
A support protocol with the Devil... No, that's not all.<br>
She must've been the reason why the Devil was acting strangely within the Reality Lens!<br>
And there's another enemy behind this one, too...!<br>
I always thought it was strange. Why did the Devil start acting so weird, and how did they break into that space?<br>
This same enemy... must've been hunting the Commander this entire time!<br>
<span style="color:#ff9900;">Hiryuu META：</span><br>
A word of advice. If you want to live to fight another day, NEVER challenge one Arbiter on their home turf, let alone two.<br>
The Devil supports, and the Hierophant controls concepts.<br>
She knows now that the biggest threat to her is the Commander.<br>
If we let her make her next attack, we're not going to be able to dodge it...<br>
<br>
"That just means we can't let her attack."<br>
<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项1："Wait, is she looking at...?"</span>'''''<br>
<br>
Despite the distance between us, I noticed the Hierophant cocking her head just slightly in my direction.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Shinano ：</span><br>
The Arbiter... moved...?<br>
<br>
<br>
KABOOOM!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Suruga：</span><br>
Dammit! No effect! My shells disintegrate on impact with the armor without even leaving a scratch!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Impero：</span><br>
I'm... all out of ammo. I demand a resupply... and paid time off...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Lyon：</span><br>
The small ones just keep coming, no matter how many we destroy.<br>
They're like hydras... Cut one down, and two take its place. Is this area linked to the microlayer network or something?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Sheffield：</span><br>
No, we're dealing with something altogether different here.<br>
It's not like they're popping out of the ocean or from sea fog... They seem to be ripping their way through the fabric of reality itself...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Noshiro：</span><br>
Ripping through... the fabric of reality? Lady Shinano, don't you think that sounds a bit similar to how our barrier domains work?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Jeanne d'Arc：</span><br>
Barrier domains?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Shinano ：</span><br>
This one had the same hunch...<br>
From an outside perspective, emerging from a Sakuran barrier hidden in the sky is the same as appearing out of thin air...<br>
There are many ways to conceal such a barrier, too...<br>
What we see is neither fact nor fiction, but rather a deception of our senses.<br>
A barrier is an enchantment that must be dispelled through the proper means. Otherwise, attacking it accomplishes nothing more than trying to scoop the moon out of a pond.<br>

I see... So what you're saying is, we've been shadowboxing this entire time. The enemy we think we are fighting was never there to begin with.<br>
If that is true, its physical form must be hidden away in some domain.<br>
I did say before that I had no more cards to play. But, that's not quite accurate–<br>
I do have one final move to make – a sacrament from this false God, given to me by Marco Polo. We have no choice but to use it.<br>
However, it will take some time to prepare. Commander, can I trust you to hold the line in the meantime?<br>
<span style="color:#a020f0;">Memphis META：</span><br>
Helena also needs time to complete her analysis. Keep up the pressure, Commander!<br>
<br>
"You don't have to tell me twice."<br>
<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项1："Continue the assault!"</span>'''''<br>
<br>
<br>
I could see the false God's form clearly through the monitor on my command vessel.<br>
Floating in the middle of the layers of armor was a girl, cloaked in a ghostly-pale light.<br>
<span style="color:#a020f0;">Memphis META：</span><br>
This isn't working. Our attacks aren't going to breach those defenses.<br>
<br>
Memphis META was referring not just to the mechanical body of the Gazer, but also the little girl in the air.<br>
<span style="color:#a020f0;">Memphis META：</span><br>
I have a guess as to why. It's only a guess, but...<br>
Based on what I know, I think that girl is Arbiter: The Hierophant V.<br>
That said, my database doesn't recognize her as The Hierophant, no matter what data or parameters I feed it.<br>
Either that appearance is some sort of disguise... or something is using The Hierophant's vessel.<br>
If the latter is true, then THAT must be the true identity of Marco Polo's false God.<br>
<span style="color:#ff9900;">{namecode:191}：</span><br>
I agree.<br>
The Ashes have fought against The Hierophant a number of times before. She is one of the few Arbiters who can be reasoned with.<br>
I have all the reason to believe that something is taking advantage of her powers and mass-production capabilities.<br>
But beyond that, there's something deeply unsettling about all of this...<br>
Not just the false God. But the Gazers as well, the swarms of enemies, and the white substance...<br>
Where I'm from, just about everything is a bad omen. But, even that has varying degrees.<br>
All I can say is... I'm afraid you guys have opened a terrible door that can't be shut again.<br>
<br>
When Memphis META rescued Shinano and her fleet, she mentioned something similar. An enemy beyond our cognition.<br>
But, they would say no more about this matter. Even Hiryuu META would tell me nothing beyond "I cannot say."<br>
If there was one thing I gleamed from this, it was that knowing too much about it was dangerous.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Marseillaise：</span><br>
Commander, when will we launch our all-out attack?<br>
That girl has something very important to the Orthodoxy. We must take it back from her.<br>
<br>
"You don't mean...?"<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Jean Bart：</span><br>
Yeah. The Crown of the Holy See. We thought Marco Polo took it with her into the sea, but it seems that the monster took it.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Marseillaise：</span><br>
Marco Polo can be judged at a later time. More urgently, we must stop the Crown from being corrupted.<br>
<br>
The symbol of the Orthodoxy's legitimacy, the crown signifying the wearer's holy position, was in the hands of the false God.<br>
<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项1："Wait."</span>'''''<br>
<br>
As I gazed upon the Crown floating in the girl's hands, something suddenly dawned on me.<br>
The Crown was more than just a relic passed down since ancient times. It was, originally, an extension of God.<br>
The girl was motionless, but her gaze pierced through me.<br>
It was her. The figure that had appeared countless times in my nightmares.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Memphis：</span><br>
Commander? What's wrong?! You look pale...<br>
<br>
"That is a threat to our world that can't be allowed to exist."<br>
<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项1："Hit her with everything you have!"</span>'''''<br>

<br>
???<br>
I open my eyes and look around.<br>
I see a dimly-lit basement, filled with equipment and furniture that seem oddly familiar to me.<br>
<span style="color:#696969;">▅H▊▇ro▅■ph▇▆▅：</span><br>
.........<br>
<br>
The Hierophant is right next to me, her wand raised above me – though in a completely unmenacing way.<br>
But, when we hear two sets of footsteps coming down the corridor, she freezes in place, as if having turned into a statue.<br>
I see. The doctors must be here.<br>
<span style="color:#696969;">▅H▊▇ro▅■ph▇▆▅：</span><br>
.........<br>
<br>
As if reading my mind, the Hierophant cocks her head dubiously and lowers her wand.<br>
<span style="color:#ffd000;">Dr. Aoste：</span><br>
...Due to the stalemate, I've been ordered to further accelerate my research.<br>
Not sure what they want, given that the production of the next-generation Antiochus model has been well underway...<br>
Yes... I'm sure that the Arbiters will give us the power we need to put an end to this futile war.<br>
But right now, we're still a long ways away from our ultimate goal.<br>
Now allow me to introduce you to the first daughter of the Arbiter Program – Hierophant.<br>
<span style="color:#ffd000;">Dr. Anzeel：</span><br>
The... first?<br>
<span style="color:#ffd000;">Dr. Aoste：</span><br>
That's right. Zero doesn't count.<br>
She's one-of-a-kind, not a member of any series.<br>
In any case, the Hierophant will be the covergirl of the Arbiter series.<br>
As such, I've strengthened her recognition of language and concepts, and installed modules to heighten her empathy and friendliness.<br>
Her updated quantum intelligence analysis system allows her to understand others on a deeper level and express emotions like any human being.<br>
During the testing process, not a single person noticed they were speaking with a machine. She passes the Turing test with flying colors.<br>
Of course, it doesn't stop there.<br>
As someone who can understand and control concepts, she understands non-human intelligence and can simulate how they would speak.<br>
We still need more testing, but she can already communicate with cats, dogs, and dolphins.<br>
With more updates, the only limit is... Why, she could surpass the heights of the Tower of Babel.<br>
<span style="color:#ffd000;">Dr. Anzeel：</span><br>
In other words, you want to make more cute white-haired girls.<br>
<span style="color:#ffd000;">Dr. Aoste：</span><br>
Ahem! Anzeel, how many times do I have to tell you–<br>
<span style="color:#ffd000;">Dr. Anzeel：</span><br>
Yeah, yeah. You're just iterating on a tried-and-true design, or whatever.<br>
<span style="color:#ffd000;">Dr. Aoste：</span><br>
Exactly.<br>
<span style="color:#ffd000;">Dr. Anzeel：</span><br>
By the way, why'd you decide to start with the fifth Major Arcana?<br>
Don't people usually go in order from the first one?<br>
<span style="color:#ffd000;">Dr. Aoste：</span><br>
I'm only in the first stages of planning. Frankly, I'm not even certain if I can make enough to fill a deck of tarot cards.<br>
What matters more is inspiration, which is exactly why I started with the Hierophant – it inspired me.<br>
<span style="color:#ffd000;">Dr. Anzeel：</span><br>
It symbolizes guidance, compassion, interconnectedness, and conformity...<br>
Oh, wow. Rare to see you so passionate about anything that isn't a weapon of war.<br>
When you called me over, I was ready for you to show me your latest weapon of mass destruction.<br>
<span style="color:#ffd000;">Dr. Aoste：</span><br>
The fact that you'd think so is in itself proof of the need for Arbiters.<br>
As you know, our resources become more precious and scarce by the day.<br>
The Hierophant will dispel every misgiving the people have towards the Antiochus.<br>
Whether you're using her as a mediator or as a means of competing for resources and funds, she'll be a major boon.<br>
<span style="color:#ffd000;">Dr. Anzeel：</span><br>
Ah, yes. Of course you'd go down that route.<br>
Then, have you considered this possibility?<br>
Keep raising her specs, and maybe, just maybe... she'll be able to communicate with Deus X someday.<br>
Being able to communicate gives us options other than fighting, yeah?<br>
Especially... under these circumstances.<br>
<span style="color:#ffd000;">Dr. Aoste：</span><br>
...Hah.<br>
<span style="color:#ffd000;">Dr. Anzeel：</span><br>
Whoa, nasty look. What's that supposed to mean?<br>
C'mon, Commander. What do you think?<br>
<br>
(Why is she asking me?!)<br>
(What am I seeing? Is this an illusion, or is it a memory played by that Recorder AI?)<br>
<span style="color:#696969;">▅H▊▇ro▅■ph▇▆▅：</span><br>

<br>
The Hierophant also looks to me curiously, as if waiting for my answer.<br>

<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项2）</span>'''''She did not resist. On the doctor's orders, she began her shutdown program.<br>
<br>
White light filled my vision, erasing Anzeel, Aoste, the Hierophant, and the entire space we were in.<br>
A door sppears in the distance.<br>
A familiar door, standing alone in the pure-white chamber.<br>
Looks like it's time for me to go home.<br>
The scenery changes for a third time. Now, I see the buildings of the World Expo venue.<br>
...More precisely, the remnants of the venue, bathed in moonlight.<br>
The sky, land, and sea are back to normal. The mysterious Divine Vestige is gone, along with the false God.<br>
The only sound in the night is the crashing of waves, as if nothing had happened.<br>
But the weight in my hands tells me that the entire Arbiter catastrophe was reality.<br>
My fingers are lightly curled around the symbol of the Iris Orthodoxy's legitimacy, the Crown of the Holy See.<br>
I can't help but to think to myself, what if the Crown was controlling the concepts within the domain the entire time, rather than the Hierophant?<br>
I receive no answer. Only the cold weight of the Crown, inanimate and lifeless in my hands.<br>
My thoughts are suddenly cut short by countless voices coming in through the communicator all at once.<br>
Judging from what words I could pick out, it seems that I had disappeared along with the Hierophant for a period of time.<br>
I suppose... I should let everyone know that I'm alive and well.<br>

<br>
Clemenceau gazed sadly at the salvaged throne before her.<br>
She could not stop the memories of their first meeting from rushing through her head.<br>
Some time in the past...<br>
Unknown location in Iron Blood<br>
On one side of the room was the schemer, representing the dark side of the shining Orthodoxy. On the other side was a jester, charming yet ambitious.<br>
The two could hardly have less in common, save for one thing – they had both been bored to death by the preceding meeting.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Marco Polo：</span><br>
So you're Clemenceau, the Vichya's representative?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Clemenceau：</span><br>
That I am. And I already know your name well, Marco Polo.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Marco Polo：</span><br>
The Iron Blood folks and your lackeys are gone. Why are you still here?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Clemenceau：</span><br>
Hmm~ I like jotting down notes while the memory is still fresh in my mind.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Marco Polo：</span><br>
Magnificent. You play the part of a bureaucrat perfectly.<br>
But, you didn't speak at all during the meeting. Do you not like dealing with Iron Blood?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Clemenceau：</span><br>
I wouldn't say that. The Vichya and Iron Blood are close friends, after all.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Marco Polo：</span><br>
Cut it out already. There's nobody else here!<br>
Stop putting on airs already. I'm only speaking to you because I see your potential!<br>
Look, the two of us are kindred spirits. Everyone else? They're a whole bunch of fools who don't know a thing.<br>
If you don't like their proposals, then why don't you lend me your ear?<br>
Hahaha! Magnificent! I can tell, the two of us are going to accomplish great things together!<br>

During the mission to activate all conceptual anchors<br>
African North Coast - Alexandria<br>
Andrea Doria stepped out of an abandoned facility, shielding her eyes from the sand kicked up around her.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Andrea Doria：</span><br>
......<br>
The situation has become dire...<br>
<br>
Turning her gaze upwards, she sees layers upon layers of strange clouds hanging low in the darkened sky.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Andrea Doria：</span><br>
......<br>
...Alright. I need to take action. Hiding from the problem won't solve anything.<br>
<br>
She shook her head, collected herself, and brushed off the sand covering the control panel in front of her.<br>
She knew what every button on the control panel did. After all, she had done this countless times before.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Andrea Doria：</span><br>
"Ignite a light in the darkness..."<br>
And now, I will add my own.<br>
<br>
The Skybound Wall activated, shooting out a bridge of light that connected the building with the World Expo all the way in the distance.<br>
The wind carried the sand through the air, covering the abandoned control panel with sand once more.<br>
Thus, the fairytale told on an Alexandrian night was left in dreams.<br>

After the mission's conclusion<br>
Somewhere in the Mediterranean Sea...<br>
<span style="color:#ff9900;">Hiryuu META：</span><br>
The Arbiter's superimposed world is gone. The truth of what happened here will remain only in our memories.<br>
<span style="color:#a020f0;">Memphis META：</span><br>
Yes. The Hierophant has been dealt with, and there's no reason for us to remain here.<br>
The Commander summoned you, right? Thank you for coming to our aid.<br>
I suppose not all of the Ashes are too stubborn to be reasoned with.<br>
<span style="color:#ff9900;">Hiryuu META：</span><br>
Do you really not remember me, Memphis?<br>
<span style="color:#a020f0;">Memphis META：</span><br>
Um... Last I checked, I was never in the Ashes. I don't know you.<br>
I think you have me confused for another Memphis.<br>
<span style="color:#ff9900;">Hiryuu META：</span><br>
I can tell you hold the Commander in a certain regard. Have you two met somewhere before?<br>
Do you believe that the Commander is the one you've been searching for?<br>
<span style="color:#a020f0;">Memphis META：</span><br>
...I can't say.<br>
<span style="color:#ff9900;">Hiryuu META：</span><br>
Why not? I just want to know your roots.<br>
<span style="color:#a020f0;">Memphis META：</span><br>
I don't see why I should tell you.<br>
<span style="color:#ff9900;">Hiryuu META：</span><br>
Okay, another question then. Do you remember speaking to Aoste and Anzeel?<br>
<span style="color:#a020f0;">Memphis META：</span><br>
I can't say.<br>
I don't know what you want from me with these questions, and this conversation is meaningless.<br>
I'll be off now.<br>
<span style="color:#ff9900;">Hiryuu META：</span><br>
Wait! Let me ask you one final question. It's similar to my first.<br>
Do you truly... truly not remember us?<br>

Memphis, what's the matter?<br>
I'm seeing some slight deviations on your monitoring system. Everything alright?<br>

Someone asked me a weird question. It's nothing. I'm finished here.<br>

Hiryuu. You should get back to your Ashes mission.<br>

<br>
After the mission's conclusion<br>
Iris Orthodoxy - Reims Cathedral<br>
Through the cathedral's stained glass windows, brilliant sunshine shone down upon religious artifacts and a floor made hundreds of years ago.<br>
The interior had been thoroughly cleaned to prepare for a ceremony. All the old sculptures and cobblestones looked as if they were brand new.<br>
New life had been breathed into the cathedral – and the Iris Orthodoxy.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Essex：</span><br>
I still can't believe they chose ME as the Eagle Union's representative... Gosh, I'm so nervous...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Avrora：</span><br>
You were the obvious choice. You proved it with your actions during the mission.<br>
It's an honor not just to have been part of the crisis response team, but also to be here witnessing this historic moment.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Chen Hai：</span><br>
So much has happened so quickly. From sealing off the microlayer network, to wrapping up the Expo's closing ceremony, to concealing the true nature of the superimposed worlds...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Prinz Eugen：</span><br>
Absurdly quickly, even. Everyone's had to work insanely fast to achieve all that in just a few days.<br>
That's the efficiency of a unified Orthodoxy for you.<br>
I suppose I'd be zealous too if I were in their position.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Illustrious：</span><br>
It's unfortunate that Her Majesty could not attend an event as momentous as the reborn Iris Orthodoxy's coronation ceremony...<br>
But as you said, it's been a hectic last few days for all of us.<br>
Which is why I'm here in her stead. It's only appropriate that I pass on Her Majesty's blessings for Lady Richelieu and the rest of the Iris Orthodoxy.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Vittorio Veneto：</span><br>
Indeed. After all they've been through, offering them our blessings is the least we can do.<br>
<br>
After a long waiting period – as is typical for such a solemn ceremony – the coronation finally began.<br>
Richelieu and her compatriots appeared before the podium, donning dignified robes that conveyed the power vested within them by the Holy Iris.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Clemenceau：</span><br>
In response to the danger posed by Reenactments, Cardinal Richelieu left the Iris Orthodoxy's soil to ask allies for help.<br>
Her achievements went largely unnoticed due to the Holy See's efforts to hide them. Despite that, she pushed on, fighting for our country.<br>
She saved our compatriots at Toulon, worked tirelessly to smooth the relationship between factions, secured and sealed off sacraments, and changed enough minds to make the reunification of the Iris Orthodoxy possible.<br>
She has been misunderstood, criticized, and put in positions of danger and adversity.<br>
Despite all of that, Richelieu never once gave up.<br>
It was thanks to her efforts that, when a crisis threatened our nation, we were able to rally under one banner.<br>
It was thanks to her efforts that, when a calamity gripped the world, we were able to seize glorious victory.<br>
As representative of the unified Iris Orthodoxy's Holy See, I hereby honor Richelieu's many contributions and sacrifices to our country.<br>
Furthermore, I hereby revoke all unjust accusations and punishments she has endured in the past.<br>
In my hands, I have the Crown of the Holy See, the shining symbol of the Iris Orthodoxy.<br>
Cardinal Richelieu...<br>
Will you be the Holy Iris's emissary and lead our war-torn country forward?<br>
Will you become an emissary of the highest order and accept the position of Pontiff of our holy kingdom?<br>
Will you wear the honor of the Iris Orthodoxy upon your head?<br>
<br>
Crown held in hand, Clemenceau awaited the kneeling Richelieu's answer.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Richelieu：</span><br>
......<br>
This Crown, this tangible sacrament...<br>
I've been pondering what it signifies ever since I had to flee our country.<br>
A sacred artifact to be kept safe?<br>
An ancient memory to be passed down?<br>
A symbol of our Orthodoxy to be revered?<br>
It represents many, many concepts, and it is something we hold dear.<br>
During that battle, however, I saw another crown.<br>
A megalomaniac's ambition.<br>
A tool exploited to selfish ends.<br>
A product of Siren technology made to make fools of us.<br>
At some point in history, the Sirens replaced the original crown with this one here.<br>
In truth, we have been worshipping a false god for a very long time.<br>
Of course, there is no doubt in my mind the faith and feelings in people's hearts were genuine.<br>
However, we should not be reliant on a flawed belief that can be easily bent and distorted.<br>
...I, Richelieu, humbly accept my new place as pontiff.<br>
I swear that I shall restore the Holy Iris and our country to their former glory.<br>
However, it is not to the Crown that I make this vow, but to my motherland and to her to people.<br>
A true ruler chooses her own crown.<br>
And I choose––<br>
The people – my people – who cherish liberty!<br>
I choose to bear no crown upon my head!<br>
<br>
Before everyone's eyes, Richelieu drew a sword and swung at the Crown of the Holy See.<br>
The strike neither split nor shattered the Crown. Instead, it spewed out a dark red smoke before finally crumbling to pieces.<br>
First, there was shock. Then, jubilation. Ages seemed to pass before silence finally returned to the cathedral.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Clemenceau：</span><br>
...Well done, Richelieu. Well done, my sister.<br>
<br>
A proud smile briefly flashed on Clemenceau's lips, without anyone noticing.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Richelieu：</span><br>
Now, listen, my sisters in faith.<br>
After many trials and hardships, liberty and unity have finally returned to our great nation.<br>
We have shed many tears and much blood to get here.<br>
But, I can confidently say that not one drop of blood, not a single tear, will have been in vain!<br>
There is no longer anything that stands in the way of a united Orthodoxy!<br>
Iris Libre and the Vichya Dominion will henceforth gather beneath the same banner!<br>
Glory to the united Orthodoxy!<br>
And glory to our motherland!<br>
<br>
Within a sea of applause, the ceremony came to an end.<br>
And thus, the Iris Orthodoxy set off on a new journey towards a brighter tomorrow.<br>

<br>
Several days after the anomalous event<br>
Somewhere in the Mediterranean Sea...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Littorio：</span><br>
These are the results of pur investigation. The superimposed world didn't become reality, and the damage was limited to only a few isolated buildings and machines.<br>
All factions have concluded that this incident was a surprise attack coordinated by the Arbiters.<br>
At the Commander's suggestion, Marco Polo, Clemenceau, and their cohorts have been officially suspended for aiding and abetting a Siren conspiracy.<br>
And everyone was happy in the end. Are you really fine with that?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Vittorio Veneto：</span><br>
Indeed... That really was a close call. Too close for comfort.<br>
If the Commander hadn't been at the World Expo, we wouldn't have been able to launch a counterattack...<br>
Marco Polo... You almost doomed us all...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Impero：</span><br>
Veneto, uh, I'm pretty sure we still haven't found Marco Polo.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Roma：</span><br>
...It's been days by now. Isn't it likely that she's already...?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Vittorio Veneto：</span><br>
*sigh*... You're right. This search hasn't gone anywhere since it began.<br>
Let's try one more time, and then we'll wrap things up and go home.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Impero：</span><br>
Gotcha.<br>
<br>
Veneto hung up and let out a deep sigh.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Littorio：</span><br>
You know, it'll take more than that to sink her. Or... are you worried about how much of headache she'll be once she comes back?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Vittorio Veneto：</span><br>
Neither? Both? I don't know.<br>
If I ever get to talk to her again, we're going to have a lengthy heart-to-heart.<br>
At first, she was genuinely trying to act on behalf of Sardegna. If only I had been more sympathetic to her, maybe then...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Communicator：</span><br>
BEEP—<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Littorio：</span><br>
Hmm? Seems like the call's for you, Veneto.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Vittorio Veneto：</span><br>
...From Clemenceau?<br>
...Good evening, Clemenceau. Is there something I can help you with?<br>
...Thank the Commander for making your work that much easier? Ahaha...<br>
...Hm?<br>
Well... I suppose...<br>
...Alright, that's no problem. Goodbye.<br>
<br>
Veneto hung up the line, then connected to the Sardegnian search party once again.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Vittorio Veneto：</span><br>
Oh dear, we are sad to report Marco Polo has already sunk to the bottom of the ocean.<br>
After a damage assessment, I'm confirming there is no hope of salvaging her. Truly a tragedy.<br>
In conclusion, the search is over and we can all go home now. Bye.<br>
<br>
After giving her order in a painfully monotone voice, she changed course for home and began humming a carefree tune.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Littorio：</span><br>
...What? But I could've sworn Clemenceau said the words "recover" and "comatose" in your conversation.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Vittorio Veneto：</span><br>
Did you not hear my order, Littorio?<br>
There's nothing more for us here. We're going to declare her as sunk in our report to the Senate and move on with our lives.<br>

Several days after the anomalous event<br>

Within a Mirror Sea, the Mediterranean is once again engulfed in Divine Vestige.<br>

Concluding 33rd Reenactment and recording results.<br>
Sufficient analytical data on the proliferating white substance yields the following conclusion:<br>
Deus X is involved.<br>
The degree of corrosion is extremely mild and the phenomenon was also disguised, resulting in late detection.<br>
Analysis of samples retrieved from the abnormal Hierophant vessel yields the following conclusion:<br>
Deus X is involved.<br>
As for why The Hierophant chose not to destroy her vessel...<br>
I have been unable to restore communications, and therefore have not been able to submit my query.<br>
.........<br>
This time, the incursion was curtailed at an early stage.<br>
But regardless, it is clear that Experimental Field β is no longer safe.<br>
...It appears that Zero attaches a great deal of importance to this branch.<br>
I must consult with her first regarding this matter.<br>
