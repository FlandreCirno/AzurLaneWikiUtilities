<br>
I've always been alone.<br>
Laughing alone. Crying alone.<br>
Sailing alone. Fighting alone.<br>
Everything, I've borne alone. <br>
But lonely? No. That was my undisputed reality.<br>
One Little Incident<br>
<br>
Chapter 1: Her Wish<br>
Port - Office<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Admiral Graf Spee：</span><br>
...<br>
<br>
It's been a while since I first arrived in port. I'm steadily becoming accustomed to my life as a secretary.<br>
From commissions to exercises, battles, and even daily greetings, my daily routine is starting to take shape.<br>
Having once been nothing more than a ship, being able to share my joys, sorrows, and worries with others – and have them taken seriously – is quite the new experience...<br>
The warmth of interacting with people...<br>
It seems I got hooked on this pleasant feeling before I even realized it.<br>
Is this really a good thing?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Admiral Graf Spee：</span><br>
Oh.<br>
Commander, I apologize. I was lost in thought for a second... Do you have any orders for me?<br>
You don't? I see... Seems like there's not much to do today...<br>
What do I want to do...?<br>
<br>
I mean, yes, I'm not doing anything at the moment, and that's not a strange question, but...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Admiral Graf Spee：</span><br>
I–<br>
<br>
...<br>
For whatever reason, I'm unable to answer.<br>
What do I really want to do?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Admiral Graf Spee：</span><br>
As of now... nothing in particular. As long as you let me stay here, I'm content.<br>
<br>
"What I want to do"... What exactly could that mean?<br>

"Basically, just share your thoughts!"<br>
"Talk about things you like, or things that worry you. Just let it all out."<br>
"Once you do, you'll feel less lonely!"<br>

Chapter 2: A Chance Encounter<br>
Port<br>
A refreshing breeze blows. It's a great day for a walk.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Admiral Graf Spee：</span><br>
*munch* *munch*<br>
What the Commander said... "What I want to do"...<br>
<br>
"Eating snacks and relaxing"... isn't quite it.<br>
Hm... These bonito flakes are pretty tasty.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">？？？：</span><br>
Meow!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Admiral Graf Spee：</span><br>
...A cat?<br>
<br>
It was a regular cat, not a meowfficer.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">cat：</span><br>
Meow~<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Admiral Graf Spee：</span><br>
Do you want some of this?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">cat：</span><br>
Mreow?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Admiral Graf Spee：</span><br>
Okay. Here you go.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">cat：</span><br>
Meow~<br>
<br>
Hm... Seeing the cat happily munching on the snacks feels pretty soothing.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Admiral Graf Spee：</span><br>
Good kitty~ *pat pat*<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Deutschland：</span><br>
Spee? What are you doing over there?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">cat：</span><br>
Myeow!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Admiral Graf Spee：</span><br>
Ah, it ran away...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Deutschland：</span><br>
Oh, so it was just a cat.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Admiral Graf Spee：</span><br>
Look, you scared the kitty away.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Deutschland：</span><br>
Hmph. Who cares about some lowly animal like that.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Admiral Graf Spee：</span><br>
Hehe. Do you want some of this?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Deutschland：</span><br>
Seriously? That's a snack for children, I'd never–<br>
...Ahem. Thanks, but I'd rather pass.<br>
Anyway, listen, Spee! You won't believe what those Royal Navy baboons did during yesterday's exercise...<br>
<br>
I wound up having to listen to Deutschland's complaints all the way back to the dorm.<br>
I wonder if the kitty's okay...<br>

"If you had allies who'd sortie with you and watch your back..."<br>
"If they'd make merry together with you at celebratory banquets after a victory..."<br>
"If they'd comfort you at review meetings after a loss..."<br>

Port - Exercise Area<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Gneisenau：</span><br>
Let's end here for today.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Scharnhorst：</span><br>
Say again? We're done already? But my main guns are only just starting to heat up!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Gneisenau：</span><br>
It's great that you're this motivated, but it's past the time we're allowed to use the exercise area... Surely you're not planning on having your way while messing up the Commander's plans, are you?<br>
I believe that the secretary, Spee, is aware of this as well.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Admiral Graf Spee：</span><br>
Yep. To be honest, I wanted to battle a little more too, but let's wrap it up here for today.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Scharnhorst：</span><br>
What a waste, I'm in top condition today... We should've booked a longer pass.<br>
<br>
By the way, I do joint exercises with the Scharnhorst sisters every week.<br>
Not only that, but we cover each other during real battles as well.<br>
...Alright.<br>
Maybe my battle buddies would know what the Commander really meant by "what you want to do."<br>
Scharnhorst or Gneisenau, who would be better to ask...<br>
<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项1：Ask Scharnhorst</span>'''''<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项2：Ask Gneisenau</span>'''''<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Scharnhorst：</span><br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项1）</span>'''''What I want to do?<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项1）</span>'''''Would you be surprised if I told you I wanna get stronger and defeat even fiercer enemies?<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项1）</span>'''''Never step down, no matter who you're dealing with – that's my style.<br>
<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项1）</span>'''''Yep. That's definitely something you'd say.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Gneisenau：</span><br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项2）</span>'''''"What I want to do"... That's a good question.<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项2）</span>'''''At present, my goals are to be of assistance to the Commander, and to keep my reckless sister in check.<br>
<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项2）</span>'''''That's definitely an answer I'd expect from you.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Gneisenau：</span><br>
Since you asked, Spee, what do you want to do? Do you have any dreams?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Admiral Graf Spee：</span><br>
I... There's nothing in particular that I want to do. As long as I'm allowed to stay here...<br>
<br>
Yeah... As long as I'm surrounded by people I know and not all alone, like back then, I'll be fine...<br>
...<br>
Why did I end up remembering that time?<br>

"Someone who really understands you."<br>
"And I don't just mean someone who listens to what you say."<br>
"But rather, someone who can guess what you're really thinking."<br>
"With someone like that around, you would never truly feel lonely, would you? Hehehe."<br>

Chapter 4: Allies<br>
Port<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Prinz Eugen：</span><br>
Oh, if it isn't Spee.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Admiral Graf Spee：</span><br>
Heya, Eug– Ahem... Hello, Eugen. What are you up to?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Prinz Eugen：</span><br>
Hm? As you can see, I'm taking a break.<br>
Isn't it nice to just sit back and relax from time to time?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Admiral Graf Spee：</span><br>
"What I want to do"... It might be a good idea to ask Eugen what the Commander meant.<br>
<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项1：Ask Eugen</span>'''''<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Prinz Eugen：</span><br>
What I want to do?<br>
Hehehe. Right now, nothing in particular, really?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Admiral Graf Spee：</span><br>
You don't?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Prinz Eugen：</span><br>
Honestly, I'm satisfied with the status quo. Ah, but if you'd like, I could look for something to do. It seems like it could be fun.<br>
...Me aside, what about you, Spee?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Admiral Graf Spee：</span><br>
I–<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Prinz Eugen：</span><br>
"Nothing in particular. I'm content with just being here with everyone," right?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Admiral Graf Spee：</span><br>
Huh?!<br>
Eugen said exactly what I was thinking at that moment.<br>
Eugen... How'd you...?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Prinz Eugen：</span><br>
I can tell just by looking at your face.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Admiral Graf Spee：</span><br>
My... face...?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Prinz Eugen：</span><br>
You're not the first person I've met who's like that, and you probably won't be the last, either.<br>
People like you, well... The moment you find out there are more things to life besides fighting, you end up not knowing what you want to do.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Admiral Graf Spee：</span><br>
End up... not knowing what I want to do...<br>
Then... how do I find things I enjoy doing?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Prinz Eugen：</span><br>
Beats me. I'm not you, so there's no way I'd know what your true dreams are.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Admiral Graf Spee：</span><br>
My... true dreams...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Prinz Eugen：</span><br>
Hehe, you're so innocent.<br>
Don't worry too much. Everyone in the Iron Blood and even the Commander can probably help you out.<br>
Just like they did for me, once...<br>

<br>
Those who stay by my side.<br>
Those who fight together with me.<br>
Those who understand what I'm thinking.<br>
If I were to lose those people... <br>
Would I still be myself...?<br>
One Little Incident<br>
<br>
Chapter 5: Loneliness<br>
Port - Dormitory<br>
I had a nightmare.<br>
When I woke up, there was nobody around me...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Admiral Graf Spee：</span><br>
Mm... It's already this late...?<br>
<br>
Since it's our day off and it's late at night, it makes sense nobody would be here.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Admiral Graf Spee：</span><br>
...<br>
<br>
Let's laze around in bed and check that smartphone which I recently learned to use.<br>
With this, I'll be able to tell how everyone else is doing even if they're not by my side.<br>
"Javelin's gonna go make another boxed lunch today!"<br>
Javelin... She's quite the lively one.<br>
"The dazzling early summer sun rises, but is it not a pearlescent solar eclipse?"<br>
Viersechs... I wish she would just talk like normal...<br>
May everyone at port be blessed with the gods' protection.<br>
Fusou's so nice and caring...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Admiral Graf Spee：</span><br>
……<br>
<br>
I feel like I've gotten to know people better ever since I learned how to use this device.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Admiral Graf Spee：</span><br>
Looks like... I can stay in touch with people this way too.<br>
<br>
Of course, I already get along well with everyone just fine, even without relying on this, but...<br>
It felt like I was the only one not hanging out online.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Admiral Graf Spee：</span><br>
Let's see, this message is from... Deutschland?<br>
It says to come to the office... Is there something important to talk about?<br>
<br>
No, it might be a combat mission...<br>
For some reason, thinking that it might be a mission gets me all excited.<br>
Maybe the battlefield is what suits me best...<br>

One Little Incident<br>
<br>
Chapter 6: Weight<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Deutschland：</span><br>
You've finally arrived, my sister.<br>
<br>
As it turns out, Deutschland is here too.<br>
Maybe there's a mission so troublesome it requires both armored cruiser sisters...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Deutschland：</span><br>
Spee, listen carefully. I've got something important to tell you.<br>
<br>
I can see indignation on my sister's face, and on the Commander's too.<br>
Have the Sirens caused trouble again...?<br>
If that's the case, there's only one thing to do.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Deutschland：</span><br>
Argh! How dare you make a fool of the great Deutschland!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Admiral Graf Spee：</span><br>
I'll reduce them to tiny shreds for Deutschland's sake.<br>
<br>
I won't turn a blind eye to injuring someone important to me.<br>
That's why I fight. To protect the place where I belong.<br>
...That's my desire. My dream. What I want to do. This is the only thing I...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Deutschland：</span><br>
Spee? Why are you saying such disturbing things all of a sudden?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Admiral Graf Spee：</span><br>
Huh...? This isn't about Sirens?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Deutschland：</span><br>
Of course it isn't! Lowly animals the likes of the Sirens can only hope to make a fool of me in their wildest dreams!<br>
This is about that lowly animal slave of mine! The one who claims to have picked out cuter clothes for you than what I chose!<br>
Your insolence knows no bounds, lowly animal! My fashion sense is leagues and bounds ahead of yours!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Admiral Graf Spee：</span><br>
Th-that's what this is about?!<br>
<br>
Indeed, there are two sets of clothing laid on the sofa.<br>
Though I never would've thought they were meant for me...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Deutschland：</span><br>
Yes. My sister, take a look at the clothes that I've chosen for you, and compare them to the ones this lowly animal dug up!<br>
Prove to this imbecile that nobody knows what suits my sister better than I do!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Admiral Graf Spee：</span><br>
I'm sorry. I'm all rigged up...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Deutschland：</span><br>
Then just take it off! Gosh, why do you always wear that massive, unwieldy rigging?<br>
Take a leaf out of my book! To project power, you must first present yourself the right way!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Admiral Graf Spee：</span><br>
B-but...<br>
<br>
These hands are for fighting with. That's all I'm good for...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Deutschland：</span><br>
Geez! Spee, why do you have to fasten the screws so tightly...! Hey, lowly animal, come and help out too!<br>
<br>
"These hands, stained with gunpowder and blood, will not be allowed to embrace peace..."<br>
Who was in their right to decide that?<br>
With a loud clank, the equipment around my hands comes off.<br>

One Little Incident<br>
<br>
Chapter 7: Warmth<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Deutschland：</span><br>
Hahahaha! Gaze upon my sister's cuteness!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Admiral Graf Spee：</span><br>
D-Deutschland...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Deutschland：</span><br>
Hah, I think it's already been settled, but if you want to be put to further shame, we can show her what you chose!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Admiral Graf Spee：</span><br>
……<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Deutschland：</span><br>
W-well... This is quite a good find, for a lowly animal...<br>
No matter, though! M-my selection will win out in the end!<br>
Now, Spee! Make your choice!<br>
Decide which one is better!<br>
<br>
Truthfully, I'm so confused by this that I can't even see how I look in the mirror very clearly.<br>
But even if I could, there's no way I could make a sound call on which one looks better.<br>
What am I supposed to do here...?<br>
……<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Admiral Graf Spee：</span><br>
"Don't overthink it, just answer honestly"...?<br>
<br>
The Commander walked over and whispered that into my ear, then went back to Deutschland.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Deutschland：</span><br>
Hey, you lowly animal! What are you whispering to her for?! You're not allowed to influence her decision!<br>
Spee, just pick the one you like! I believe in you!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Admiral Graf Spee：</span><br>
...Heh... hehehehe.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Deutschland：</span><br>
S-Spee? What's the matter?<br>
I swear, slave! If you whispered something to her that made her cry, I'm going to feed you to the sharks!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Admiral Graf Spee：</span><br>
That's not it, Deutschland. I just realized the Commander didn't choose these clothes, because they're the same ones Ajax talked about the other day..<br>
<br>
That's right. There wasn't an ounce of unease inside me to begin with.<br>
Who would've thought my minor concern could be solved this easily?<br>
Just with the help of my allies, friends, and people who are precious to me. This port and this fleet are where I belong.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Admiral Graf Spee：</span><br>
Is it okay to say that I like both equally?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Deutschland：</span><br>
*sigh*... I predicted you might say that.<br>
That's fine. This all boils down to a silly ego battle with this lowly animal anyway. If that's what you say, then it's fine.<br>
However! I'm only allowing this in deference to Spee! One day, I will prove that the great Deutschland's fashion sense is better than yours, slave!<br>
<br>
The Commander. The bully, Ajax. My sisters in the Deutschland class. My friends in the Iron Blood, and in the fleet...<br>
Even if I fight to protect them, that doesn't mean fighting is all there is to it.<br>
Because my dream, my desire, is to always be here, with everyone I hold dear...!<br>
