<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Kazan：</span><br>
I'm awoken in the morning by the gentle mewing of a cat. The scent of food wafts in and beckons me to the kitchen.<br>
Mm, that should do it... Easily digestible foods really are the best for breakfast.<br>
Ah, you're up, Commander?<br>
She turns to me. The cat at her feet, eagerly devouring its food, looks up for a moment.<br>
Kazan is wearing only a thin skirt that accentuates her curves. She smiles sweetly at me from the kitchen counter.<br>
Birdsong and the sizzling of the pot blend with her silhouette, making for a truly wonderful morning scene.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">{playername}：</span><br>
I can't believe I slept in so much. Did you turn off my alarms?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Kazan：</span><br>
Spring tends to make people tired, so I wanted to let you get a little more rest.<br>
And I got to enjoy your adorable sleeping face at the same time. Heehee, you're too cute when you're vulnerable♪<br>
When I'm about to respond, I feel soft fur brush against my leg, so I squat down and pet this needy kitty.<br>
Heehee... I think it likes you, Commander.<br>
I want you to pet me, too!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">{playername}：</span><br>
Is that all you want?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Kazan：</span><br>
Oh my, Commander. You saw through me so easily.<br>
I suppose the longer you spend with someone, the more you start to understand them.<br>
By the way... Did you sleep well last night? I'm curious how you would rate your night time with me.<br>
I held you tightly all through the night because I was worried you might accidentally fall out of bed...<br>
But sometimes, I'd wonder if I was holding you too tight and making it hard for you to breathe...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">{playername}：</span><br>
I slept great.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Kazan：</span><br>
Oh... I'm happy to hear that.<br>
Ah, by the way. Would you like a cup of hot milk?<br>
I reach for a cup, but she takes it first and lifts it to her lips.<br>
Then, she gently blows on the milk. The warm steam mists her skin, tinting her cheeks with a soft glow.<br>
She takes a small sip. It leaves a faint milky trace on her lips and a spark of pleasure in her eyes.<br>
Mm... Just the temperature you like, Commander. Go on and try it.<br>
Our fingers touch as I accept the milk. Kazan takes the opportunity to hook her pinky around mine.<br>
The gentle smell of milk is right under my nose.<br>
Commander, aren't you forgetting something important?<br>
If you want to bolster your immune system, milk alone isn't going to cut it.<br>
You need something else... Can you guess what it is?<br>
<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项1：Is it something in the milk?</span>'''''<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项2：Is there something you want?</span>'''''<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Kazan：</span><br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项1）</span>'''''No? Of course, the milk is important, but so is the person who prepared it for you.<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项1）</span>'''''Come here, Commander. I'll give you a nice, warm hug.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Kazan：</span><br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项2）</span>'''''Heehee. I knew you'd understand.<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项2）</span>'''''Come quickly... I'll give you a nice, warm hug.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Kazan：</span><br>
Like last night, her embrace is so tight that it gives me almost no space to breathe.<br>
I want to do every little thing I can for you. I never want to take my eyes off you...<br>
To be your safe harbor and your reliable guardian... To give you everything that you're willing to take.<br>
Maybe this is just a vice of mine... Heehee.<br>
Now, would you like to help me finish this breakfast?<br>
Yes, just like that... Hold my hand as we stir with this ladle...<br>
Gentle motions... Yes, good.<br>
Let's have a delicious morning together, Commander.<br>

<br>
My body clock wakes me up on time. The room smells like flowers.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">De Zeven Provinciën：</span><br>
As I slowly open my eyes, I see a girl gently touching a budding tulip under the warm sunlight.<br>
Hum hum... It's such a beautiful morning, don't you agree?<br>
There, there... Good baby~ I wish I could be like you, always by the Commander's side in your most perfect state...<br>
Zeven gingerly brushes the dew off of the petals and coos to the flower in a sing-song voice – until my movement catches her attention.<br>
...Oh? You're awake, Commander.<br>
You worked so late last night that I thought you'd sleep in a bit.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">{playername}：</span><br>
Zeven? Why are you here?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">De Zeven Provinciën：</span><br>
Umm... You're just too cute when you sleep. I couldn't bear to miss the sight.<br>
I told the plants, "I want to be the first thing the Commander sees when waking up."<br>
And they graciously let me in!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">{playername}：</span><br>
(That doesn't make much sense.)<br>
(But honestly, knowing her, I almost believe it.)<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">De Zeven Provinciën：</span><br>
Then, the bed was so comfy that I just had to change into something more comfortable...<br>
I'm right at home now... What should I do about our date?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">{playername}：</span><br>
Oh, right, we did plan to go for a walk in the garden this morning.<br>
Did I oversleep?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">De Zeven Provinciën：</span><br>
Nope. Right now, the time is...<br>
Umm... Yes, we should have plenty of time until our date. It's 12 midnight.<br>
Wait... Huh?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">{playername}：</span><br>
What the...?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">De Zeven Provinciën：</span><br>
The clock says it's midnight, but it sure doesn't look like it outside.<br>
B-but the clock hands really do stop here, see...?<br>
I have a closer look at the clock and realize what the problem is.<br>
The hands... they don't just stop – they're stuck in place.<br>
Last night, after I walked you to your room, I thought I'd set your alarm for the morning... And then...<br>
Ah! Oh no, it hasn't moved at all since then...<br>
Did I break it again? I'm pretty sure I followed the instructions just right...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">{playername}：</span><br>
Ah. I think I get it.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">De Zeven Provinciën：</span><br>
That explains everything.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">{playername}：</span><br>
Sorry, this is really my fault. Next time, I'll set it myself.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">De Zeven Provinciën：</span><br>
I'm sorry... I keep causing trouble for you.<br>
I don't know if this makes up for it... but I have a little surprise. It holds all of my feelings for you♪<br>
Zeven gently leans in and puts a hand over my eyes.<br>
A fresh fragrance envelops me.<br>
Do you recognize this scent on me, Commander?<br>
<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项1：It smells like spring.</span>'''''<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项2：My sense of smell isn't too keen...</span>'''''<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">{playername}：</span><br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项1）</span>'''''It smells like flowers... or all of spring, really.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">De Zeven Provinciën：</span><br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项1）</span>'''''Do you think so? That's a more poetic answer than I expected.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">{playername}：</span><br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项2）</span>'''''It smells really good, but it's so close that I can't discern it.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">De Zeven Provinciën：</span><br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项2）</span>'''''Then shall I get some coffee beans to reset your sense of smell?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">De Zeven Provinciën：</span><br>
Heehee. Today's scent is a yellow tulip. It's just for you.<br>
In the Kingdom of Tulipa, it symbolizes a smile that lights up my life even more than the sun.<br>
That's exactly how I feel about you.<br>
You bring light and warmth like the sun itself, encouraging even the shyest of buds to bloom...<br>
Every moment with you is as bright and lovely as this spring day, Commander.<br>

<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Evertsen：</span><br>
On one spring afternoon, Evertsen invites me to her room.<br>
The door is slightly ajar. I knock a few times, but there's no answer, so I get a little worried and open it.<br>
Hmm. Coevolution...<br>
The characteristics of two species gradually change as influenced by long-term interaction between them...<br>
In the end, they reach a form most optimal for each other.<br>
She sits by the window with her back to me, bathed in sunlight, focused intently on something.<br>
The sun brightens the room beautifully, its light gently reflecting off the faint particles of dust floating in the air.<br>
All is quiet until I come closer and offer my own take on the theory.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">{playername}：</span><br>
It's a lot like me and the Commander.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Evertsen：</span><br>
But surely the Commander has a far greater influence on me than I do on... Huh?<br>
She whips around in surprise.<br>
Commander, how long have you been there... Is it already time?<br>
I'm sorry. I got so absorbed in this that I didn't even hear the knock. And I even let you approach me unaware...<br>
Also, erm... You're a little close...<br>
Please sit down over there. I prepared the seat just for you.<br>
Ahem. I've done the research, and when people face each other, it becomes easier for certain feelings to blossom.<br>
Liken it to a dance. You need to understand each other's movements.<br>
Advancing, retreating, changing direction... Only by gazing at each other can you move in sync and find your rhythm.<br>
In short, Commander, I just want to look you in the eyes. That is all.<br>
What do you think...? Do you agree with my logic? Or do you seek something more stimulating?<br>
She speaks in straightforward language, but her breathing is accelerating, and her ears get pinker by the second.<br>
I do as she says and sit across from her. Then, I hold out my hand.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">{playername}：</span><br>
Evertsen, can you lend me your hands for a while?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Evertsen：</span><br>
Hm? For what?<br>
Though confused, she offers me both of her hands. Her shyness and nervousness are clear from the way they tremble.<br>
She probably doesn't realize it herself. Either way, I can't leave her like that.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">{playername}：</span><br>
You're hyperventilating a little.<br>
About that coevolution you were talking about earlier... Why don't we try putting theory into practice?<br>
Take my hand and breathe. Slowly, deeply... In, out. Good job.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Evertsen：</span><br>
*inhale*... *exhale*...<br>
I guide her breathing rhythm to help her calm down.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">{playername}：</span><br>
Feeling better?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Evertsen：</span><br>
Yes... I knew it would be great to let you take the lead.<br>
Now...<br>
Suddenly, she pushes me back against the window while I'm off guard.<br>
Under the soft golden sunlight, Evertsen quietly lets her feelings show.<br>
Influencing each other, evolving together...<br>
In the end, you develop... a perfectly in-sync, symbiotic connection.<br>
Commander... Will you let me take the lead now?<br>

<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Albion：</span><br>
The Commander must still be deep in dreams...<br>
I hope I'm the one in those dreams... Our date yesterday was so much fun.<br>
We were totally in sync with tactics, and our battle plans were perfectly aligned...<br>
Huh? W-wait...<br>
Did I... make the Commander study combat tactics with me all day?!<br>
Oh, no... We were supposed to be on a date, and I wasted it all on studying!<br>
Of course, I do like learning with the Commander... but dates must be used for more romantic things!<br>
What do I do... It feels like I've missed the chance now.<br>
Ugh, I can't be down like this. I need to fix the Commander's impression of me!<br>
Now's the time for breakfast... Oh!<br>
All we have in the fridge are milk and bread...? Well, I can manage with this!<br>
Into the toaster you go... And I heat up the milk...<br>
Phew. The milk is almost as warm as the Commander's body now... Heehee... Ah, whoooa!<br>
Albion lets out a startled cry, followed by the clattering of glass.<br>
Alerted by this, I hurried to the living room to check on her.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">{playername}：</span><br>
Albion, are you okay? You're not hurt, are... Hm?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Albion：</span><br>
The first thing I notice is how flustered she is.<br>
The second is... her sheer wetness.<br>
The overturned cup lies on the bar counter, while the milky liquid slowly spreads across the surface...<br>
Still leaning against the counter, Albion seems totally oblivious to what she just did.<br>
Oh, no... Huh?! C-Commander?!<br>
Wait... am I the reason the milk spilled? Am I that clumsy?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">{playername}：</span><br>
It's all over you, too.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Albion：</span><br>
Whaaat?! It's all over my chest...! C-Commander, please don't look at me!<br>
It's just too embarrassing...<br>
<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项1：Need some help?</span>'''''<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项2：Here, I got tissues.</span>'''''<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">{playername}：</span><br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项1）</span>'''''I can wipe up the milk or something, if you want...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Albion：</span><br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项1）</span>'''''But you shouldn't have to clean up my mistake...<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项1）</span>'''''Umm... Actually, if you don't mind... *sniffle*<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Albion：</span><br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项2）</span>'''''Thank you, Commander... But the milk's somewhere I can't quite see...<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项2）</span>'''''Would you please help me wipe it up?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Albion：</span><br>
As I come closer, a soft blush spreads across Albion's skin.<br>
Ah... Th-thank you, Commander...<br>
Oh... Are you done already? I'm not sure if I...<br>
No! I'm not upset! I'm happy, I really am...!<br>
I mean, not because I caused trouble for you... But because you took your time to help me. It makes me very happy...<br>
Phew... Is everything clean now?<br>
Ah, the tissues are a mess... I'm so sorry.<br>
She approaches, her expression troubled like a scared fawn.<br>
Commander, will you stop liking me because I'm so clumsy...?<br>
Umm... Should I take that to mean that you don't mind?<br>
Thank goodness. I'll be more careful next time!<br>
But first, there's a favor I want from you...<br>
Albion leans in close, gazing at me with her watercolor eyes.<br>
Would you please... stay with me on this warm spring day?<br>
