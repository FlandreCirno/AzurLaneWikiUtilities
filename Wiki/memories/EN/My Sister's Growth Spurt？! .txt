My Sister's Growth Spurt?!<br>
<br>
Chapter 1: My Sister's Daily Routine<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Vincennes：</span><br>
Commander, wanna come over to play this weekend?<br>
<br>
One day, I suddenly received an invitation from Vincennes. That weekend, I found myself in front of the gates to the Union's dorm...<br>
Port - Eagle Union Dorms<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Quincy：</span><br>
Ah, Commander, you made it. Vincennes told me you were on your way.<br>
Vincennes, wake up! Weren't you the one who invited Commander over to play?<br>
<br>
I stepped inside the dorm and saw Vincennes, sound asleep in Quincy's lap.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Vincennes：</span><br>
Zzzz.... huh? Ugh... five more minutes...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Quincy：</span><br>
It's not good to keep to keep people waiting for you...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Vincennes：</span><br>
Then... Commander should come take a nap too... zzz...<br>
<br>
Vincennes fell asleep again, mid sentence.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Quincy：</span><br>
I'm sorry, Commander, Vincennes is just always like this...<br>
<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项1："I don't mind!"</span>'''''<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Quincy：</span><br>
That reminds me, how is Vincennes doing as your secretary? She didn't make any trouble for you, did she?<br>
Her personality is a bit too laid back... perhaps we've spoiled her too much...<br>
Being like this at home is one thing, but I'm worried that she's like this on the job as well... If it's troublesome for you, then...<br>
You can always let me take her place!<br>
<br>
Is there no option to help her become more reliable?<br>
<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项1："Though, Vincennes is fine as she is"</span>'''''<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Quincy：</span><br>
I, I see... I'm relieved if that is the case, Commander.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Vincennes：</span><br>
Zzz... Sis... you're being noisy...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Quincy：</span><br>
Hehe... sorry, sorry. Um, Commander, should we all take a nap then?<br>
<br>
Just as I was thinking about where I would even be able to lie down, Quincy smiled at me and gently patted her unoccupied leg.<br>
I didn't dare take her up on her offer, but I did sit down next to Vincennes for a while until she woke up.<br>

<br>
Chapter 2: My Sister's Troubles<br>
Port - Eagle Union Dorms<br>
I received another invitation from Vincennes to the Eagle Union Dorms.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Astoria：</span><br>
Vincennes, I bought some mango crepe cake just now! Here, ahhn~<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Vincennes：</span><br>
Astoria... why are you doing this too...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Astoria：</span><br>
Because I'm a big sister, of course! I can't let Quincy keep you all to herself!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Vincennes：</span><br>
Ugh... Astoria... *nom nom*<br>
<br>
Vincennes' objections were quickly silenced by the spoonfuls of cake that Astoria fed her.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Vincennes：</span><br>
Commander, help me...<br>
<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项1：Help her finish the cake</span>'''''<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Astoria：</span><br>
Ehehe...<br>
<br>
From the side, Astoria was watching Vincennes with a... "happy" smile?<br>
Astoria, your aura seems to have... darkened a few shades?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Astoria：</span><br>
Hey, wait a second, Commander! I may not be Quincy but I'm also Vincennes' big sister! Got it? Big~ sister~!<br>
Besides, we didn't get to spend a lot of time together before, so being able to spend time with my adorable little sister like this is like a dream come true!<br>
<br>
Upon saying that, Astoria threw herself around Vincennes and squeezed her hard.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Vincennes：</span><br>
Sis... can't... breathe!<br>
<br>
Somehow, I started getting the feeling that Astoria and Portland could become really good friends...<br>
I suppose I can relate with how you're feeling, Astoria. Vincennes does give off that aura that makes you want to protect her...<br>

<br>
Chapter 3: My Sister's Thoughts<br>
Port - Eagle Union Dorms<br>
Since the time she first invited me, Vincennes and I had some time to get to know each other better, and we started to grow closer.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Vincennes：</span><br>
Commander, wanna come space out together today?<br>
<br>
However, Vincennes only seemed to have two settings - napping, and spacing out.<br>
*knock* *knock*<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Vincennes：</span><br>
Ah, coming! Huh... Indy? Oh... are you hiding from your sister again?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Indianapolis：</span><br>
... ... ... Mhm...<br>
<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项1："How do you two know each other?"</span>'''''<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Vincennes：</span><br>
The New Orleans-class and Portland-class often work together... Indy and I are good friends...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Indianapolis：</span><br>
... ... ... Mhm...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Vincennes：</span><br>
Also... we both don't talk much... and our sisters are a bit... overwhelming...<br>
Although Indy has it much worse than me...<br>
<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项1："What do you think about your sisters?"</span>'''''<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Vincennes：</span><br>
Um, since the very beginning, my sisters always fought to do stuff for me, so I ended up not needing to do anything on my own...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Indianapolis：</span><br>
These big-sister types all worry too much...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Vincennes：</span><br>
Mmhm... But, I suppose that's part of being a big sister... Indy, you don't hate Portland, right?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Indianapolis：</span><br>
Of course not...<br>
<br>
It seems that for these two, they still care about their sisters, even if they sometimes disagree with their methods.<br>

My Sister's Growth Spurt?!<br>
<br>
Chapter 4: My Sister's Sadness<br>
Recently, the situation around the port began to become more demanding, and everyone was getting busier and busier as a result.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Quincy：</span><br>
Commander, I'd like to discuss how we should reconnoiter the next sea area...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Vincennes：</span><br>
Um, Quincy...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Quincy：</span><br>
Ah, Vincennes, sorry. Your sister is discussing some work-related stuff with Commander. I'll be with you as soon as I'm done.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Vincennes：</span><br>
Okay...<br>
<br>
It'd probably be best to send Astoria there, since she was involved in clearing out the route there a few days ago.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Astoria：</span><br>
Commander, are you assigning this to me?<br>
... All righty, got it! Just leave it to me!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Vincennes：</span><br>
Um, Commander... can I help?<br>
<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项1："Let me think about it."</span>'''''<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Astoria：</span><br>
Commander, why don't you assign her with me? I'll make sure to take good care of her!<br>
<br>
Indeed, I know Vincennes is quite reliable in combat. Astoria, since you volunteered, I'll let you handle it then.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Astoria：</span><br>
Vincennes, don't sweat the details, okay? Just let your big sister plan things out for you!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Vincennes：</span><br>
Mm...<br>
<br>
... ...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Vincennes：</span><br>
Commander, want to take a nap together? I've been working really hard...<br>
<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项1：Pat Vincennes on the head, and tell her that you'll join later</span>'''''<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Vincennes：</span><br>
All right... see you in a bit...<br>
<br>
Vincennes looked a bit deflated as she shuffled back over to the secretary's seat.<br>
But there's no helping it... work isn't going to do itself.<br>

<br>
Chapter 5: My Sister's Determination<br>
Port - Office<br>
Things finally settled down around the port as the situation began to diffuse. Laughter began to return as everyone's nerves began to relax.<br>
Though I, unfortunately, had to leave Vincennes alone for a while, I hoped to make up the lost time with her...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Vincennes：</span><br>
Commander, can we talk?<br>
<br>
Huh? Vincennes seems awfully direct today. I should hear her out...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Vincennes：</span><br>
Commander... how do I become a better secretary?<br>
<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项1："What do you mean?"</span>'''''<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Vincennes：</span><br>
Commander... treats me the same way my sisters do... always letting me do whatever I want, and going along with me...<br>
Um, I do like being taken care of by all of you...<br>
But, I don't think this should go on forever...<br>
Vincennes glowed with a determination I had never seen in her before.<br>
I don't want to be protected and coddled my whole life...<br>
I also want to be of help to my sisters, and to you, Commander!<br>
Recollections of Quincy and Astoria fawning over their sister immediately popped up inside my head.<br>
Commander, you didn't appoint me to be secretary because you wanted to play with me, right?<br>
From the beginning, those like Vincennes and Indianapolis have always been able to find an important role on the front lines, no matter how they were treated back home.<br>
Well, Vincennes, if you become more capable, then perhaps your sisters will change the way they see you.<br>
<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项1："I'll teach you what being a secretary is all about!"</span>'''''<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Vincennes：</span><br>
You'll teach me? Hooray!<br>

<br>
Chapter 6: My Sister's Hard Work<br>
With that discussion, Vincennes started her special secretary ship lessons.<br>
Originally, it was just a one-on-one tutoring session... But her sisters soon found out, and it quickly turned into group tutoring.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Quincy：</span><br>
First, let's talk about organizing the documents. In order to be of assistance to the commander, you'll first have to quickly understand what kind of document you're working with...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Vincennes：</span><br>
Urgh... there's so many different types...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Quincy：</span><br>
Of course. Also, as the secretary, you must know the commander's schedule like the back of your hand.<br>
It's not enough to just memorize it though! You must be able to rearrange and adapt as the situation demands!<br>
So, Vincennes, are you clear about what a secretary's responsibilities are now?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Vincennes：</span><br>
Being in sync with what Commander is trying to do?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Quincy：</span><br>
Mmhm. That's right.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Astoria：</span><br>
Nnnnngh... What should I teach...? Ah, I'll tell you all about what Commander likes to eat!<br>
You also have to make sure Commander is in top condition at all times!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Vincennes：</span><br>
Got it!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Minneapolis：</span><br>
I'll teach you how to hunt! Wait... how did I get dragged into this?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Quincy：</span><br>
I suppose I did ask everyone in the New Orleans-class to help... But, hunting is maybe a bit excessive...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Minneapolis：</span><br>
But New Orleans herself didn't bother to show up... Oh well, if I'm not needed here, s'pose I'll head back!<br>
<br>
I couldn't help but to smile fondly as the enjoyable group tutoring continued for a while.<br>

<br>
Chapter 7: My Sister's Smile<br>
With the combined advice from her sisters, Vincennes had a better understanding of her secretary duties.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Vincennes：</span><br>
Commander, can you check if I sorted these documents correctly?<br>
And here is today's agenda... Ah, I wrote the wrong thing here...<br>
<br>
Although she was still a bit clumsy, her progress was undeniable.<br>
I couldn't help but to feel a little proud of how much she had grown in such a short time.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Vincennes：</span><br>
Oh right, Commander, these are for you...<br>
Vincennes handed over a small pouch of elegantly-wrapped cookies.<br>
They were clearly handmade. Their shapes were a bit rough, but one could immediately see the sincere feelings of the person who made them.<br>
Um... Astoria said you liked cookies, so we made these together...<br>
Commander, I wanted to thank you for always looking after me...<br>
I also made some for my sisters... I'm not sure why, but Quincy started to cry on the spot...<br>
<br>
Ah... I definitely could see that happening...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Vincennes：</span><br>
Even though it's nice to be pampered, and to be able to go to sleep whenever I want...<br>
It's even nicer to be able to work hard alongside you and my sisters.<br>
So, from now on, I'll do my best!<br>
<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项1："Let's work hard together!"</span>'''''<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Vincennes：</span><br>
Okay! Oh, but um... Commander, you'll still take naps with me, right?<br>
