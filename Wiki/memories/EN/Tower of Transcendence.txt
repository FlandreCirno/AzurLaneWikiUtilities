–––– ??? ––––<br>
In a space engulfed by darkness, Friedrich der Große – blueprint ship, and the executor of Bismarck's will – sat and quietly mulled over the reports of her peers.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Tirpitz：</span><br>
Since we secured Scapa Flow from the Royal Navy, none of the other factions have made any major moves.<br>
Across the NA Ocean and in the Bermudas, we are cooperating in joint operations and research ventures as instructed.<br>
From what circumstantial evidence we've gathered, the leaders of the other factions are still unaware of our purpose for doing so.<br>
...This concludes my report. We will continue to "stand by."<br>
<br>
The connection with Tirpitz was cut off, and another incoming call took its place on the display.<br>
Friedrich der Große tapped the panel lightly––<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">U-47：</span><br>
It's U-47. Oh, yeah... About that Arbiter investigation... No progress yet.<br>
I ran into one of their vessels, but we weren't able to squeeze any information out of it.<br>
I'll keep doing what I can.<br>
<br>
She listened to each report in absolute silence. None of them were worth a response.<br>
She simply let the tides of information flow around her, drawing from them what she needed – just as Bismarck did.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Peter Strasser：</span><br>
The resources and combat forces required for the Tower of Midgard have already been shipped out.<br>
The active camouflage is operational, and there are no signs of interference from enemies. These are the best possible work conditions.<br>
That being the case, what is the judgment of this plan's chessmaster?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Friedrich der Große：</span><br>
Start assembling your forces. I'll send your next instructions soon.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Peter Strasser：</span><br>
Understood.<br>
<br>
She absorbed the information flowing around her, processed it, and issued commands that would lead to her desired outcomes. Exacting fidelity, like a maestro conducting a symphony.<br>
But there was another maestro as well... the person advising her.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Prinz Eugen：</span><br>
So, all the pieces are finally starting to fall into place. Are you sure you don't need me out there?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Friedrich der Große：</span><br>
I cannot afford to waste a single point of our limited resources.<br>
Should you fail, Bismarck's will would not be fully enacted.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Prinz Eugen：</span><br>
Is that really such a big deal? ...It's not like everything would be for naught, right?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Friedrich der Große：</span><br>
What do you think?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Prinz Eugen：</span><br>
......Well, I'll trust in your plan.<br>
I wonder if we can give our dear clients in the Sakura Empire a glimpse of the future.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Friedrich der Große：</span><br>
I don't mind. However, just know that I cannot guarantee the stability of the transmission.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Prinz Eugen：</span><br>
Of course. The fact that this IS a risky operation only makes me want to show off more.<br>
Considering how important our findings are to them, I'm sure they won't complain even if we do run into some technical difficulties.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Friedrich der Große：</span><br>
Exercise your best judgment.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Prinz Eugen：</span><br>
Best of luck to you too. Signing off.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Friedrich der Große：</span><br>
............<br>
<br>
For a brief moment, a tinge of melancholy flashed across Friedrich's face. But almost as quickly as it had come, her lips curled into their usual smile as she connected her next call.<br>
"Royal Navy" and "Northern Parliament." She reached for the panels bearing the insignias of the two factions.<br>
––The Naval HQ's instructions were for the Crimson Axis and Azur Lane to remain at war.<br>
As soon as Friedrich finished her conversations with the representatives of the other factions, she turned her attention to a new call that had unexpectedly cut in.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Marco Polo：</span><br>
Thank you for your kind invitation, Friedrich der Große.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Friedrich der Große：</span><br>
Marco Polo of Sardegna. You arrived earlier than planned.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Marco Polo：</span><br>
So? Who cares if I'm a few minutes early or late? I'm also busy here, so let's not sweat the small details.<br>
......Wait, so I really am too early?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Friedrich der Große：</span><br>
Yes. And this channel is for emergency communications only.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Marco Polo：</span><br>
Eh?! My, I'm terribly sorry for that!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Friedrich der Große：</span><br>
Let's not sweat the small details.<br>
<br>
Friedrich smiled wryly at the two panels that had been closed just moments before the Sardegnian ship's interjection. A narrowly averted disaster.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Marco Polo：</span><br>
Anyway, I'm looking forward to seeing the results of your operation.<br>
But you'd probably have to give me the details after the fact though. I can't really find the time to follow things as they unfold.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Friedrich der Große：</span><br>
How unfortunate. I would've liked you to come witness it in person.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Marco Polo：</span><br>
I appreciate the sentiment, but we've got our hands full with the Vichya right now.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Friedrich der Große：</span><br>
I have little to offer you in support right now, but... may you take their power and spread the glory of Sardegna.<br>
<br>
"As it stands, Sardegna seems to have their interests elsewhere and will not be participating in the operation."<br>
Friedrich wrote a brief reminder for herself before directing her attention towards the final contact – the one in charge of carrying out the operation.<br>
Only two panels remained to shed light across the dark space.<br>
............<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Friedrich der Große：</span><br>
The time has finally come for the operation to be set into motion.<br>
The stage has been set, and the actors are in place. All that remains is to lift the curtains.<br>
Let us relish in the sights and sounds of the show to come––<br>
<br>
The Iron Blood has given much to reverse engineer Siren technology.<br>
Investigating Siren capabilities, conducting Reenactments. Usurping facilities, integrating their technologies into special armaments.<br>
And finally, a "Singularity Deconstruction" expedition to shed light onto the mystery of the Sirens' very existence.<br>
A project that was not possible at any point in the past due to technological limitations.<br>
But at last, after an experiment conducted on a floating fortress, after contact with the Sakura Empire, and after a counter-offensive operation in the NA Ocean, the doorway into the realm of the impossible revealed a crack.<br>
The Tower of Midgard, and the core of that project...<br>
Bifröst, a bridge that connected the singular existence of this world to the Singularities of other dimensions.<br>
Something that would elevate humanity's understanding of the Sirens.<br>
The operation would test the things that the Iron Blood prided themselves in– their technology, their combat prowess...<br>
And above all else––<br>
Their audacity to transcend God.<br>

<br>
Operation Area - Morning<br>
The sun rose over the horizon and cast its light on an enormous Iron Blood fleet.<br>
Their numbers were truly staggering, as if every Iron Blood ship in existence was partaking in this massive operation.<br>
Across the sea from them, situated in the middle of the ocean, a group of structures stood arranged into the shape of a ring.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Elbe：</span><br>
That's the Tower of Midgard, huh? I'm frankly astonished they managed to complete it this fast.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Magdeburg：</span><br>
And man, it's a marvel to behold! Now our job's to get in there and wreak some havoc.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">U-1206：</span><br>
Resurfacing! Steer clear!<br>
U-1206, having just finished a patrol of the area, emerged from the sea. She gazed on inquisitively at the structure in the distance.<br>
No enemies in the area! Let's keep our fingers crossed and hope it stays that way!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Elbe：</span><br>
Well, if anyone foolish enough comes along to challenge us, they're in for the beating of a lifetime.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Magdeburg：</span><br>
Heh, yeah. It'd be suicide tryin' to stop us now.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Peter Strasser：</span><br>
It looks like everyone's here. Good. I'm Peter Strasser. I'll be overseeing the Towers for this operation.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Elbe：</span><br>
Ah, Strasser! Always right on time!<br>
Your team never ceases to amaze. First you built the flying fortress, and now this!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Peter Strasser：</span><br>
Anyone can accomplish great feats if they don't fall for distractions and just focus on their job.<br>
Now, you should know a few things before you enter the Singularity. I'll be brief.<br>
What you see before you is the Tower of Midgard. Let us not waste time pointing out how it does not resemble a tower.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Magdeburg：</span><br>
You sayin' these structures collectively make up the Tower of Midgard?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Peter Strasser：</span><br>
Correct. They were first built inside the flying fortress, then assembled on-site here.<br>
Of course, these "building blocks" on their own are each already the size of a small island.<br>
But transporting them was not difficult. We have the Sirens' tech to thank for that.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Elbe：</span><br>
Now that you mention it, those structures do resemble the flying fortress a bit.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Peter Strasser：</span><br>
Correct. They're essentially derived from the same technology.<br>
We're able to conceal them using an active camouflage system to ensure neither Naval HQ nor the other factions find out about them.<br>
This same system can also be used to create hologram fleets, like in our last Reenactment with the Royal Navy. Quite nifty, I'll say.<br>
Now... Your group will spearhead the attack on the Singularity. Ulrich will be your leader. Ulrich?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Elbe：</span><br>
...Ulrich, that's your cue.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ulrich von Hutten：</span><br>
Ugh...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Peter Strasser：</span><br>
Ah. Thank you for gracing us with... some sort of response.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ulrich von Hutten：</span><br>
Yeah, yeah. Sorry for not being very chatty.<br>
Let's just say the Tower has me speechless. Starstruck.<br>
Anyway... I'm Ulrich von Hutten. I'll serve as your field commander for this operation.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Peter Strasser：</span><br>
Excellent. One minute while I grant you access to the Tower's systems and control over the mass-produced ships.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ulrich von Hutten：</span><br>
Thanks. Just one question: after the Tower is activated, will we be able to create hologram fleets and the like?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Peter Strasser：</span><br>
Well, there's no guaranteeing you'll be able.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ulrich von Hutten：</span><br>
So it's not a no. Good enough.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Peter Strasser：</span><br>
More or less. Creating a Singularity takes immense amounts of energy. It's unlikely we'll have much left to spare for creating holograms.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ulrich von Hutten：</span><br>
Got it. We'll just have to see for ourselves what we can do once we're inside.<br>
That about does it for the briefing. See you on the other side.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Peter Strasser：</span><br>
Sending you coordinates for the anchor point right now. Strasser out.<br>

Tower of Midgard - Pier<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Elbe：</span><br>
Is everyone here? It feels like we're missing someone?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Magdeburg：</span><br>
Oh, it's probably Adalbert. She's probably off stretching somewhere before the operation.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">U-1206：</span><br>
Gosh, imagine being as carefree as her. The operation's starting soon, too!<br>
She's so in her own world, she won't even show up for lunch unless you call for her!<br>
Oh well, she's only got herself to blame if she goes hungry!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Prinz Adalbert：</span><br>
You called? Also, whose funeral?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">U-1206：</span><br>
Err...! Nobody's, just talking to myself!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Magdeburg：</span><br>
Yo, where the hell've you been? Somethin' happen at one of the structures?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Prinz Adalbert：</span><br>
Nah, we're still in the green. We've got active camo, remember?<br>
Granted, that's gone as soon as we make that Singularity. We'll basically be broadcasting ourselves to all the Sirens nearby.<br>
Oh, and since you asked, I was just getting my stretches in. Wouldn't want to get a cramp during battle, ya know?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Magdeburg：</span><br>
Well, do whatever you need, but don't go running off once the actual operation starts.<br>
Anyway, it's almost lunchtime. You comin'?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Prinz Adalbert：</span><br>
Sure. Hang on, where'd U-1206 go? She called me and everything.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Magdeburg：</span><br>
My guess is she went straight for the cafeteria.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Prinz Adalbert：</span><br>
Unlike Elbe. I see you hiding back there, girl.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Elbe：</span><br>
Dang it. Here I was hoping I could sneak up on you un– Owch! Ow-ow-ow!<br>
<br>
Adalbert ran up to Elbe at breakneck speed and pinched her cheek.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Elbe：</span><br>
Okay, sorry! I should've known better than to try to pull pranks on you!<br>
<br>
Moments later, a pair of voices echoed from across the pier.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Prinz Heinrich：</span><br>
Is this really it, Z46? Today's the big day, right?!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Z46：</span><br>
You needn't shout, Heinrich...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Prinz Heinrich：</span><br>
Sorry! I'm just excited to finally get some R&R once we wrap this thing up!<br>
And thank god for that! I'd die from boredom if I had to go one more day with no action whatsoever!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Z46：</span><br>
Do not get too excited. Your respite shall only come once this is over.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Prinz Heinrich：</span><br>
Aww, look at Eisen! He's looking restless too. Poor boy needs a vacay just as much as I do!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Z46：</span><br>
He appears that way only because you will him to...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Prinz Adalbert：</span><br>
Heyo, Heinrich.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Prinz Heinrich：</span><br>
Oh! Sup, Adalbert! What's brought you all the way out here?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Prinz Adalbert：</span><br>
I mean, what do you think?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Prinz Heinrich：</span><br>
Uhh... I dunno? Should I know?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Z46：</span><br>
You... You did read the mission briefing, yes, Heinrich?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Prinz Heinrich：</span><br>
On paper, yeah! In reality... nope. But that's no biggie, I'll be just fine with Strasser's guidance!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Prinz Adalbert：</span><br>
Classic Heinrich. Never change.<br>
Basically, we're gonna go take a look around that Singularity.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Magdeburg：</span><br>
But right now we're just chewin' the fat while waiting for lunchtime.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Prinz Heinrich：</span><br>
Ah, gotcha! Meanwhile, I just got done running a final inspection on some equipment.<br>
Heard we're getting started once Strasser and Ulrich finish their meeting.<br>
By the way, is that still going on?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Elbe：</span><br>
Seems like it. Ulrich might seem all grumpy and unsociable, but she's actually quite thorough with these things.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Prinz Heinrich：</span><br>
Huh. I guess you really can't judge a book by its cover...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Z46：</span><br>
Fearsome indeed will her fury be should you not know what the operation entails.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Prinz Heinrich：</span><br>
...On second thought, I think I'll read the mission briefing! See you girls later!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Magdeburg：</span><br>
Hey, are you not gonna eat before– Welp, guess not.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Z46：</span><br>
You needn't worry about her. She will catch up with us soon enough.<br>
Now, let us make way to the cafeteria. We can fetch some food for Heinrich too.<br>

<br>
Tower of Midgard - Pier<br>
Not long after the girls finished their meals, the ground began to rumble.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Prinz Adalbert：</span><br>
Hey, who put the facility on vibrate?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Peter Strasser：</span><br>
That's just the Singularity generator powering up. Nothing to worry about.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Prinz Heinrich：</span><br>
Hi there, Strasser! Just making sure: we've gotta go stand guard around the facility, right?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Peter Strasser：</span><br>
Correct, and you are to stay on guard until Ulrich's team finishes and returns from the Singularity. Understood?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Prinz Heinrich：</span><br>
You got it! And if it goes well, Eisen and I will finally get some time off!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Peter Strasser：</span><br>
The key word is, "if." The Sirens will start coming for the Tower now that we've lost our active camouflage.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Prinz Heinrich：</span><br>
Not a problem! I could use some after-lunch exercise.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Weser：</span><br>
This is Weser. I have a report to make.<br>
The Sirens have indeed noticed us and are on their way to attack.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Peter Strasser：</span><br>
Already? They're faster than I expected.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">U-1206：</span><br>
Sooo, there's good news and bad news. Which do you want to hear first?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Peter Strasser：</span><br>
It makes no difference. Just tell me.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">U-1206：</span><br>
Okay, the good news is, the Siren forces consist of mostly mass-produced ships.<br>
And the bad news is... they're all heading straight for us, almost like they're being pulled in by gravity!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Elbe：</span><br>
I see... So you were scouting all this time? Is that why you weren't at the cafeteria?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">U-1206：</span><br>
Yeah. I saw Weser head out, so I thought I'd better tag along!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Magdeburg：</span><br>
So neither of you have had lunch...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">U-1206：</span><br>
Nah, we just went and ate at a different cafeteria!<br>
Anyway, we can't really enter the Singularity yet, can we? Sirens come first, right?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Peter Strasser：</span><br>
Indeed. We must seize the initiative against them.<br>
Your team, however, will proceed to the Singularity's entrance. Ulrich is waiting for you there.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Prinz Adalbert：</span><br>
You sure you don't need our help?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Peter Strasser：</span><br>
Would you not waste time questioning my orders? My mission is to ensure you get inside the Singularity.<br>
And your mission is to explore the Singularity and return safely. Remember that.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Prinz Adalbert：</span><br>
You're the boss... Then let's not keep Ulrich waiting.<br>
Let's go, Elbe, Magde, and U-1206.<br>
Oh, and Heinrich, good luck with the Sirens and all that.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Prinz Heinrich：</span><br>
Thanks, but I don't need luck! I've got a belly full of food and I'm ready to do some damage!<br>
Time to go! Let's get 'em, Eisen!<br>

<br>
Tower of Midgard - Singularity Generator<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">U-1206：</span><br>
This is how a Singularity looks, eh... Didn't expect it to be this shape, whatever it's called.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Magdeburg：</span><br>
Yeah, what is it called? Can't remember.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Elbe：</span><br>
If I'm not mistaken, I think it's a halo.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Prinz Adalbert：</span><br>
Or a donut, with the shimmering layer being the glaze.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">U-1206：</span><br>
Halo! That's the word! And what the heck do you mean "donut"?! There's no "shimmering layer" either!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Elbe：</span><br>
Adalbert clearly has food on the brain. We just ate, too.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Magdeburg：</span><br>
I'm no expert on the names of shapes, but even I can tell ya that ain't no donut.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Elbe：</span><br>
Let's just put this whole topic to rest. No more talking about food.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Magdeburg：</span><br>
Fair. Feels like we should be doin' something besides twiddlin' our thumbs while the others defend the Tower...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ulrich von Hutten：</span><br>
Be patient. It's only taking longer than expected because our defensive installations are drawing power.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Magdeburg：</span><br>
That's what I'm sayin'! Shouldn't we be out there helping 'em?!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ulrich von Hutten：</span><br>
Stop worrying. Everything is still proceeding as planned.<br>
Helping them would only waste energy and resources. We can't just get a replacement for you after we enter the Singularity.<br>
Besides, dispatching those Sirens should be a breeze for someone of Strasser's caliber.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Magdeburg：</span><br>
Well... All right, if you say so!<br>
{{折叠面板|内容结束}}

{{折叠面板|标题=Activation|选项=6|主框=1|样式=primary|展开=否}}
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Peter Strasser：</span><br>
This is Strasser. Sorry I took so long.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ulrich von Hutten：</span><br>
How are things on your end?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Peter Strasser：</span><br>
We're almost done with them. The Tower's turrets will make short work of the Sirens once Heinrich's team softens them up.<br>
I'll reroute power to the Singularity generator now. Just hang on a bit.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ulrich von Hutten：</span><br>
Understood. We'll get ready.<br>
Everyone, run a final equipment check, then prepare to enter the Singularity.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">U-1206：</span><br>
Hey, Ulrich, what shape do you think the Singularity is? Like a donut?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Prinz Adalbert：</span><br>
Here we go again...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ulrich von Hutten：</span><br>
You're viewing it through a perspective both too limited and too childish.<br>
It is no donut – it is a tower. A tower that extends into other worlds...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">U-1206：</span><br>
You lost me... How is it like a tower?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ulrich von Hutten：</span><br>
Never mind that. It's not important.<br>
(Above, the domain of the gods. Below, the land of the dead. And betwixt the two... Midgard.)<br>
What matters is directionality. If this is a tower, and not a bridge, then we will either go up... or down.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Prinz Adalbert：</span><br>
Soooo... Singularities are like the layers of a cake?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ulrich von Hutten：</span><br>
Who can say? We know hardly anything about how Singularities function. The only way we'll learn more is by going inside.<br>
<br>
With a thundering great rumble, a maelstrom whipped up at the facility's center. It erupted into the sky, turning into a radiant cyclone.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Peter Strasser：</span><br>
Good. The Singularity looks stable.<br>
But it won't stay that way forever. The clock is ticking, and you must come back before time runs out.<br>
I can't stress this enough: if you run out of time, you are as good as dead! Waste not a moment getting ready to enter the Singularity!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ulrich von Hutten：</span><br>
I know. Now it's time we play our part.<br>
Starting countdown. Listen up, everyone! Your orders are as follows...<br>
Enter in formation. U-1206 goes first, Magdeburg and I follow, then Adalbert. Elbe takes the rear, leading the mass-produced ships forward.<br>
Keep one eye on your monitoring equipment and the other on your surroundings. We have no idea what to expect in there.<br>
The future of Iron Blood – if not the future of all mankind – hinges on this operation. Failure is not an option.<br>
Operation begins NOW!<br>
<br>
When the signal was given, U-1206 sprang into motion, followed by all the other members of the team.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">U-1206：</span><br>
Are you sure about this?! I'm not sure I'm quite ready yet!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Magdeburg：</span><br>
Time waits for no one, girl! Doesn't matter if you're ready or not!<br>
<br>
One by one, the shipgirls's faded as they crossed over the Singularity's event horizon.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Prinz Adalbert：</span><br>
Yo, Heinrich, I'm going in now.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Prinz Heinrich：</span><br>
Gotcha! Break a leg!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Prinz Adalbert：</span><br>
Talk to you inside, Elbe.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Elbe：</span><br>
Of course. Godspeed.<br>
<br>
After notifying her sister, Adalbert proceeded into the Singularity.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Elbe：</span><br>
Here's hoping all these mass-produced ships can, at the very least, serve as a distraction...<br>
I have no idea what's waiting for me inside... yet somehow, that's making my heart beat with excitement.<br>
Strasser... Weser... Trust me, when I return, there'll be trumpets blowing to celebrate my success!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Weser：</span><br>
I don't expect you to conquer another dimension with your planes, but... well, I wish you the best of luck.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Peter Strasser：</span><br>
As do I. I look forward to seeing your findings.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Elbe：</span><br>
*sniffle*... All right, I'm off now. Bye!<br>
<br>
Finally, Elbe – the last member of the team – entered the Singularity, with a stunning column of mass-produced ships in tow.<br>
The girls cut off from their comrades, the operation had officially commenced.<br>

<br>
The air was scorching, but the water was freezing – it was like being in two places at once.<br>
An overpowering odor hung in the air, sapping the girls' strength. This place was unlike any Mirror Sea.<br>
And of course it would be. After all...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Prinz Adalbert：</span><br>
Hey, Ulrich? You okay?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ulrich von Hutten：</span><br>
...Yeah, I'm fine.<br>
Looks like we made it.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Prinz Adalbert：</span><br>
Seems so. And what a weird place this is...<br>
One moment we're in familiar waters, the next we're here. Saw you stagger just a sec ago. I think all of us did too.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ulrich von Hutten：</span><br>
Must have been because of the drastic change in environs. We should've sent the mass-produced ships in first...<br>
How are the others doing?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Prinz Adalbert：</span><br>
All good.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Elbe：</span><br>
Our monitoring equipment works like normal. There's water and oxygen, and luckily enough, not a Siren to be found. I'd say our entry went about as well as possible.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Magdeburg：</span><br>
Now onto the surveying part. Where're we goin' first? Lots of ground to cover here.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Elbe：</span><br>
Well, my recon planes spotted the wreckages of mass-produced Sirens. They seem like pretty new models too.<br>
So I say we follow the breadcrumb trail of wrecks to start with.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Magdeburg：</span><br>
Sounds good to me.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">U-1206：</span><br>
Elbe, I just wanna point out...<br>
There's another Tower of Midgard right behind us!<br>
<br>
U-1206 was right. There, in the place they emerged from, stood the same towering structure and swirling maelstrom.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Elbe：</span><br>
That's the same facility, and the same counterclockwise vortex...<br>
Oh, I get it! This is our way home, come the time for us to leave!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">U-1206：</span><br>
So this is the exit? Gotcha! Feels smaller than the one we came from, though...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Elbe：</span><br>
Smaller? Ah, that's because this Tower doesn't have the defensive turrets. They're separate from the Singularity generator, so that's probably why they're not here.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">U-1206：</span><br>
That makes sense! I'm glad we have a smart, good girl like you along, Elbe!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Elbe：</span><br>
I am NOT a good girl! Say that again and I'll feed you to the sharks!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">U-1206：</span><br>
Too bad I'm not scared of sharks, so hah!<br>
<br>
U-1206 swept in behind Magdeburg and stuck her tongue out at Elbe.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ulrich von Hutten：</span><br>
Sounds like you're acclimatizing well to this place. Listen, I'm going to repeat our objectives here.<br>
Objective one: conduct a preliminary survey of the area and gather as much information as possible.<br>
Objective two: find members of the neutral "META" faction and persuade them to join us.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Elbe：</span><br>
Hang on, what?! The briefing didn't say anything about a second objective!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ulrich von Hutten：</span><br>
That's because it's not on the record.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Prinz Adalbert：</span><br>
And why's that, exactly?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ulrich von Hutten：</span><br>
It's a classified objective, which is why I couldn't tell you about it until we entered the Singularity.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Prinz Adalbert：</span><br>
That's not much of an explanation at all, but whatever I guess...<br>
How are we supposed to find META ships, though?<br>
For that matter, are you sure they're neutral, or that they're willing to talk to us?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ulrich von Hutten：</span><br>
We don't have any concrete way of finding them, but it's possible we will as we survey this area. That is our job.<br>
As for how we know they're neutral... The Commander has defined them as such.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Prinz Adalbert：</span><br>
Hmm... In that case...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ulrich von Hutten：</span><br>
Any more questions?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Prinz Adalbert：</span><br>
Nah, not from me anyway.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ulrich von Hutten：</span><br>
If anyone else has one, ask it now. I cannot have you doubting the mission's purpose in the midst of a battle.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Elbe：</span><br>
No doubts here. Now, are we heading for the wrecks I spotted earlier?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ulrich von Hutten：</span><br>
Yes, we are. U-1206, lead the way.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">U-1206：</span><br>
Got it! Diving down now!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ulrich von Hutten：</span><br>
Do not forget this operation is ultimately about gathering intel and negotiating. Avoid pointless conflict if at all possible.<br>
(If we are to fight... It should be with a purpose.)<br>

<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Elbe：</span><br>
I've spotted a humanoid Siren! It looks to be... a new model entirely.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Prinz Adalbert：</span><br>
Surprised we've come across a new Siren model already.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Magdeburg：</span><br>
Wonder if our attacks'll work on it... Good opportunity to find out!<br>
Should I blast it, or go in for a punch?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Elbe：</span><br>
Neither, you idiot! Let's not tempt fate! Moreover, something is strange with it...<br>
It's alone. Usually Sirens come in groups, don't they?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Magdeburg：</span><br>
Looks like it's on wreck-retrieval duty or somethin'.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ulrich von Hutten：</span><br>
Don't take that for granted. Sirens, especially humanoid ones, hardly ever work alone.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">U-1206：</span><br>
Heads up, Ulrich! I've spotted functioning mass-produced Siren ships among the wrecks!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Elbe：</span><br>
What?! Agh! I must be blind for somehow missing those!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Magdeburg：</span><br>
Hey, don't beat yourself up. Anyone could hide a ship among this many wrecks.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ulrich von Hutten：</span><br>
This either means these Sirens are capable of using tactics, or that they have a command unit leading them.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Prinz Adalbert：</span><br>
Whatever the case, what are your orders, Ulrich? Fight, or flee?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ulrich von Hutten：</span><br>
Supposing they're lying in ambush for us, they must possess sensor equipment outranging ours.<br>
Ergo, avoiding them is not an option. Prepare to fight.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Magdeburg：</span><br>
Oh sweet, our first-ever battle in a Singularity. Let's mess 'em up!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ulrich von Hutten：</span><br>
Hold it. They could be stronger than we expect. That being the case...<br>
Send in the mass-produced ships first. We will not waste precious ammunition on Sirens if we can help it.<br>

<br>
Inside the Singularity - Unknown Location<br>
The Iron Blood's mass-produced ships moved in. Instantly, the Sirens hiding among the wrecks all emerged and opened fire.<br>
Their firepower was truly staggering. The Iron Blood's ships were obliterated, and so their front was wide open.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Magdeburg：</span><br>
The hell?! They melted our ships in an instant!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Prinz Adalbert：</span><br>
We juiced 'em up for fighting in the Singularity, but I guess that made no difference!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Elbe：</span><br>
I had a feeling they'd only work as a distraction... Ulrich, let me do this!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ulrich von Hutten：</span><br>
Go ahead. We need aerial support.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Prinz Adalbert：</span><br>
C'mon, Mag. We've gotta step up.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Magdeburg：</span><br>
At least we know what we're in for now. Time to take off the kiddie gloves!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">U-1206：</span><br>
Ulrich! The Sirens have submarines too!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ulrich von Hutten：</span><br>
Of course they do... Have you found their command unit yet?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">U-1206：</span><br>
Can't say for sure, but I couldn't see anything that looked like it!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ulrich von Hutten：</span><br>
(It seems approaching these Sirens like any other isn't going to work... But can we really afford to use our trump card already?)<br>
(But, we might not have a choice, considering our mass-produced ships are as good as worthless.)<br>
<br>
While Ulrich pondered her next decision, a violent explosion went off at the center of the Sirens' fleet. It happened without warning.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Prinz Adalbert：</span><br>
What... What was that? Did you see that, Ulrich?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ulrich von Hutten：</span><br>
Who did that?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Prinz Adalbert：</span><br>
No idea. I don't know what even happened.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Elbe：</span><br>
It came from way over there! Someone or something hit the Sirens directly!<br>
Look! Another one's coming!<br>
<br>
Several high-speed projectiles appeared above the horizon, smoke clouds trailing behind them like the tails of comets.<br>
They crashed into the Siren fleet, engulfing their ships in flames.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Prinz Adalbert：</span><br>
Cannon shells...? No, those were something else!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Magdeburg：</span><br>
Whatever that was, it left their formation in ruins! Should we go in and start doin' damage, Ulrich?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ulrich von Hutten：</span><br>
(Those were obviously targeted attacks... That means there's someone else out here fighting the Sirens.)<br>
(Either it's those META girls, or backup sent by the Commander. There's only one way to find out who...)<br>
(By going straight to the source.)<br>
Change course. We're finding out who fired those projectiles.<br>
{{折叠面板|内容结束}}

{{折叠面板|标题=A Strange Ally|选项=10|主框=1|样式=primary|展开=否}}
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Magdeburg：</span><br>
Woo! Yeah! Watch 'em drop like flies!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Elbe：</span><br>
That takes care of the last of them. We're in the clear now.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Magdeburg：</span><br>
So, what the hell were those things? Couldn't have been cannonfire – shells don't fly like that.<br>
But I can't think of anythin' else...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ulrich von Hutten：</span><br>
If I had to guess, they were long-range rockets or something similar.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Elbe：</span><br>
Rockets... Rockets! That reminds me! Haven't our scientists developed a weapon that functions similar to a rocket?<br>
Those have to be launched on land, though. I suppose there could be a small island not far from here...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ulrich von Hutten：</span><br>
I doubt it. If there was one, you would already have spotted it with your planes.<br>
It's more likely that was the might of a META ship.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">U-1206：</span><br>
Uh-oh... I see two figures in the distance! They've got, uh, strange riggings!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Elbe：</span><br>
Strange riggings? Who in the world could that be?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">U-1206：</span><br>
No clue! I'll just have to get a closer look!<br>
Fingers crossed they won't start shooting at me...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ulrich von Hutten：</span><br>
"Strange riggings," she says... Might be what fired those shots.<br>
We'll head there to investigate. Remember, don't fight unless you have to.<br>
<span style="color:#ffd000;">An Shan：</span><br>
I am An Shan – Dragon Empery missile destroyer, pennant number 101. And this is my sister Chang Chun, number 103.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Elbe：</span><br>
What are Dragon Empery destroyers doing in a Singularity?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Magdeburg：</span><br>
And... what the hell is a missile?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">U-1206：</span><br>
Maybe it's what blew up that Siren fleet just earlier?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ulrich von Hutten：</span><br>
Greetings. I'm Ulrich von Hutten. I'm commanding the Iron Blood's Singularity survey fleet.<br>
<span style="color:#ffd000;">An Shan：</span><br>
Oh, you're Iron Blood ships? Phew...<br>
It's such a relief finding an ally in a Singularity as rife with Sirens as this. A happy coincidence indeed.<br>
For a while there, I wasn't sure whose side you were on.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ulrich von Hutten：</span><br>
...I do believe our respective factions are at war.<br>
<span style="color:#ffd000;">An Shan：</span><br>
That is true, but that isn't what I meant. The fact is that we shipgirls are all allies in the war against the Sirens.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ulrich von Hutten：</span><br>
And us meeting here is just random chance – is that really what you're saying?<br>
<span style="color:#ffd000;">An Shan：</span><br>
Yes, it's as simple as that. Coincidences do happen.<br>
<span style="color:#ffd000;">Chang Chun：</span><br>
Yup. We're doing recon here as per the Commander's orders, and by dumb luck I guess we both opened portals to the same Singularity!<br>
<span style="color:#ffd000;">An Shan：</span><br>
CHANG CHUN!<br>
<span style="color:#ffd000;">Chang Chun：</span><br>
Oops. Me and my big mouth!<br>
<span style="color:#ffd000;">An Shan：</span><br>
Ugh... Now might I ask: what are you doing in this Singularity?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ulrich von Hutten：</span><br>
What is YOUR fleet doing?<br>
<span style="color:#ffd000;">An Shan：</span><br>
I'm afraid that's confidential.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ulrich von Hutten：</span><br>
Then my answer is the same.<br>
<span style="color:#ffd000;">An Shan：</span><br>
......<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ulrich von Hutten：</span><br>
I have a proposition. Why don't we put allegiances aside and work together for the time being?<br>
<span style="color:#ffd000;">An Shan：</span><br>
Sadly, we cannot. We have our reasons, and they aren't... Well, they're not ALL to do with allegiances.<br>
However, I will offer you a piece of advice...<br>
You probably shouldn't use mass-produced ships in this place.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ulrich von Hutten：</span><br>
Why? Because a bigger fleet draws more attention?<br>
<span style="color:#ffd000;">An Shan：</span><br>
Partly, yes, but mainly because bringing big mass-produced ships into a Singularity seems to trigger a reciprocal response from the Sirens. Keep that in mind.<br>
<br>
The Dragon Empery girls waved farewell at the Iron Blood fleet, then swiftly sailed away.<br>
Ulrich considered the option of following them, but decided not to out of trust for the Commander, and for her fellow shipgirls.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Magdeburg：</span><br>
...Man, those missile things they got are crazy stuff.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Elbe：</span><br>
Here I thought they were some superweapon only the Sirens could use... I hope we'll be able to utilize those someday.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Prinz Adalbert：</span><br>
Soooo... How did the Dragon Empery figure out how to open a Singularity?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ulrich von Hutten：</span><br>
Who knows. Their technology differs from ours. I'm not going to make blind conjectures.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Prinz Adalbert：</span><br>
Who knows? Not the kind of phrase I was expecting out of you.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ulrich von Hutten：</span><br>
I can't construct a hypothesis without more information. It's as simple as that.<br>
However, I can be sure their actions won't impede our progress. The Commander wouldn't allow that.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Prinz Adalbert：</span><br>
What do we do 'bout the mass-produced ships? Do as they said and dump 'em?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ulrich von Hutten：</span><br>
Moor them here. We will not scuttle a valuable asset.<br>
They'll serve as a landmark for when it's time to leave.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">U-1206：</span><br>
All righty. What do we do now, then?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ulrich von Hutten：</span><br>
The same as before – we head for those wrecks Elbe sighted.<br>
We cannot leave the Singularity empty-handed. We have to make some sort of discovery...<br>
<br>
The Iron Blood fleet set sail once more, traveling in the direction opposite where the Dragon Empery girls went.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ulrich von Hutten：</span><br>
If we steer clear of those Dragon Empery girls, any traces of a recent battle we find should indicate a META shipgirl is nearby.<br>
<br>
They anchored their fleet of mass-produced ships and left them behind.<br>
However, they were hardly prepared for what they would encounter ahead–<br>

Inside the Singularity<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Prinz Adalbert：</span><br>
Hey, pretty sure a battle took place here recently.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">U-1206：</span><br>
Over here, over here! I was gonna have a look around but bumped into something special!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Magdeburg：</span><br>
The hell's that? What's so interesting about a bunch of scrap metal?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">U-1206：</span><br>
Something's different about this thing! Not sure exactly what it is, but my gut wouldn't lie to me...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Magdeburg：</span><br>
How do I know what your gut's telling you? Think harder, will ya?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">U-1206：</span><br>
That's right! This... reminds me of some kind of device! There might be a switch around here if you feel around a bit... Hrmm...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Prinz Adalbert：</span><br>
Hmm...?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">U-1206：</span><br>
Look, this might sound weird, but I know you can turn this thing on. Just not sure exactly how.<br>
It looks just like all the other debris lying around, right? But it's clearly been modified...<br>
I'm not seeing a button anywhere, but I know it has to turn on somehow!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Prinz Adalbert：</span><br>
I see, that makes perfect sense. You spent too much time with Ulrich and totally lost your marbles.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">U-1206：</span><br>
Yeah! Wait, no! It's way more obvious seeing it underwater! It's no ordinary wreckage! It's some sort of device!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Magdeburg：</span><br>
You say that like we can just take our riggings off and follow you...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">U-1206：</span><br>
Oh, I know! Elbe, are you seeing anything from the air?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Elbe：</span><br>
Huh? It's just wreckage as far as the eye can see from up here.<br>
And plus, there's like smoke all over the place from the previous battle. If I try to fly my planes any higher, that's all I'd see.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ulrich von Hutten：</span><br>
(This may be a Siren domain, but the feeling I'm getting is much more visceral...)<br>
(The stench of endless destruction and decay lingers here, as if this place isn't meant for the living.)<br>
(A fundamental rejection of shipgirls... No, all living things. That is what it feels like to me.)<br>
(This is a place that all would do well to avoid.)<br>
...Is this place a graveyard, or an empty void?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Prinz Adalbert：</span><br>
Yo, Ulrich, there's something weird over here too.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Magdeburg：</span><br>
Ugh, how ugly... Is this even a ship? It looks more like some sort of monster...<br>
<br>
Ulrich grimly continued her task of surveying the destruction around her.<br>
{{折叠面板|内容结束}}

<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Elbe：</span><br>
I, I found something!<br>
There's probably still a battle going on around here! Just look at all the fresh wreckage!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">U-1206：</span><br>
Right-o! Over here, everyone! Wait, what the heck, is there even more rubble and debris than before?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Elbe：</span><br>
Of course! That's the proof that we're getting closer to the middle of the action!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Magdeburg：</span><br>
Think we'll run into an actual monster?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Elbe：</span><br>
Th-there's no such thing as monsters!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Prinz Adalbert：</span><br>
Then what is it, Elbe?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Elbe：</span><br>
Well, whatever it is, it's not showing up on my radars, it's fighting against the Sirens, and it's freakin' powerful!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Prinz Adalbert：</span><br>
That can only mean one thing...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ulrich von Hutten：</span><br>
META is here...<br>
{{折叠面板|内容结束}}

{{折叠面板|标题=Gneisenau?|选项=13|主框=1|样式=primary|展开=否}}
<br>
The Iron Blood fleet followed the trail of charred mass-produced Siren husks. Their broken forms were piled into something resembling a grotesque shrine of twisted metal.<br>
It was clear that whoever did this... had done so recently.<br>
The shrine was almost like a dark invitation... from a fateful host that the Iron Blood ships had never met before.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Prinz Adalbert：</span><br>
Hmm... Do you think this was done by one of the Ashes...?<br>
This place is giving me the creeps. I feel like I'm being watched...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">U-1206：</span><br>
I feel it too... It doesn't seem hostile so far, but it's definitely sizing us up!<br>
Wait, is that... Gneisenau?!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Elbe：</span><br>
She does look like her... but she's giving off a completely different vibe!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Magdeburg：</span><br>
So that's one of the "META" we've been hearing so much about.<br>
From looks alone, she seems to be Iron Blood. But just as Elbe said, the similarities end there.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ulrich von Hutten：</span><br>
According to our intel, the Ashes prefer to avoid contact. If that's the case, then our chance of convincing her to join our cause is...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Prinz Adalbert：</span><br>
Well, how do you propose we start to make our case?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ulrich von Hutten：</span><br>
By waiting. We don't know if she can be reasoned with just yet... Let me handle this.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Prinz Adalbert：</span><br>
Ulrich, what do you plan on doing?<br>
<br>
Ulrich von Hutten instructed the fleet to prepare for battle. She then fired up her engines and carefully made her way towards the META.<br>
<span style="color:#ffd000;">Gneisenau META：</span><br>
Unusual. A Pawn that doesn't attack like a mindless beast.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ulrich von Hutten：</span><br>
I'm no pawn. I'm a shipgirl, just like you.<br>
<span style="color:#ffd000;">Gneisenau META：</span><br>
Impossible. There's no way for a shipgirl to enter this place.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ulrich von Hutten：</span><br>
Yes, it should be impossible. But the Iron Blood made it a reality.<br>
<span style="color:#ffd000;">Gneisenau META：</span><br>
Reality, huh. This dying, burnt-out world is my only reality.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ulrich von Hutten：</span><br>
...I want to be clear here. We do not want to fight you.<br>
Quite the opposite. Our benefactor, Friedrich der Große, wishes for you to take up arms for the Iron Blood once more.<br>
<span style="color:#ffd000;">Gneisenau META：</span><br>
The Iron Blood, huh... Hollow, meaningless words.<br>
I have always been here fighting. Forever, for all of time.<br>
Subordinates. Superiors. Companions. Even the Iron Blood. Even when they all ceased to be, I still continued to fight.<br>
For what, if not the Iron Blood?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ulrich von Hutten：</span><br>
We are not so presumptuous as to pry into your past. However––<br>
<span style="color:#ffd000;">Gneisenau META：</span><br>
Silence. The Iron Blood I know has nobody with your name, or this "Friedrich der Große."<br>
I have no data to prove that you aren't just a shadow created by the Sirens.<br>
Even if you really are from this "Iron Blood" that you speak of, my battle does not end.<br>
Yes, it will continue forever, for all of time.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ulrich von Hutten：</span><br>
.........<br>
<span style="color:#ffd000;">Gneisenau META：</span><br>
This world has ended. Whatever you are looking for, you will not find it here.<br>
And I will continue to be its warden forevermore. Call me a fool. Call me mad. Call me a lost soul. It matters not to me.<br>
Now begone!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ulrich von Hutten：</span><br>
...How about we cool it and talk things through.<br>

<br>
While avoiding the bombardment from the META ship, Gneisenau, Ulrich racked her brain for answers.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ulrich von Hutten：</span><br>
(Her powers are immense, but nothing beyond what we predicted.)<br>
<br>
Even though the Iron Blood fleet was outgunned, they continued to establish a positional advantage using their superior numbers.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ulrich von Hutten：</span><br>
(But, our objective here is not to subdue the META ship, much less sink her.)<br>
(In the first place, it seems inconceivable that a META ship would be able to be subdued through numbers alone...)<br>
<br>
Ulrich once again focused her attention on observing Gneisenau's movements.<br>
Or rather, the lack thereof. While Gneisenau's firepower was indeed formidable, she made little effort to avoid incoming shells, hardly moving from her spot.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ulrich von Hutten：</span><br>
(Is she... injured?)<br>
(If so, that would explain why she doesn't match up to the caliber of the "META" ships mentioned in the briefings...)<br>
(She also mentioned that she knows the Iron Blood, but has never heard of me or Friedrich.)<br>
(In that case, it is useless to mention the specific circumstances around our particular Iron Blood, and the same applies to the subject of the Commander.)<br>
(.........But, I happen to be in a betting mood today.)<br>
<br>
With determination flaring in her eyes, Ulrich called off the attack and relayed her instructions to the rest of the fleet.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ulrich von Hutten：</span><br>
This is Ulrich. Lower your weapons and pull back to a safe distance.<br>
Once again, lower your weapons and pull back to a safe distance. You've done enough here.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Elbe：</span><br>
Huh? Wait, why?!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Magdeburg：</span><br>
Ulrich, you can't be serious... You're going to fight the META alone?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">U-1206：</span><br>
I know I haven't been able to help much at this range, but still...!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Prinz Adalbert：</span><br>
Heyyyy, Ulrich! What's going on? Care for an explanation?<br>
<br>
Her sudden instructions left her companions flabbergasted, but no instructions would follow. Ulrich simply continued to mutter to herself calmly as if nothing had happened.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ulrich von Hutten：</span><br>
Leave the two of us alone... Just me and that META.<br>
...We've got a lot of things to talk about.<br>
{{折叠面板|内容结束}}

{{折叠面板|标题=Decision|选项=15|主框=1|样式=primary|展开=否}}
<span style="color:#ffd000;">Gneisenau META：</span><br>
What's the meaning of this?<br>
<br>
Seeing the rest of the Iron Blood fleet retreat out of firing range, Gneisenau also lowered her weapons and turned to face the approaching Ulrich.<br>
Both ships were still on their guard, but the smell of blood and iron in the air seemed to thin out somewhat.<br>
<span style="color:#ffd000;">Gneisenau META：</span><br>
I already told you. My subordinates, my superiors, my companions. They're all gone.<br>
If it's a duel you want, you can continue with your attack as before.<br>
There is little point to crushing you alone, but if that is what you want, so be it––<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ulrich von Hutten：</span><br>
That's not why I'm here.<br>
<span style="color:#ffd000;">Gneisenau META：</span><br>
Then why are you here? What could you possibly gain by talking to a crazed weapon of war?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ulrich von Hutten：</span><br>
You're mistaken. You're not mad.<br>
<span style="color:#ffd000;">Gneisenau META：</span><br>
And you... You're no different. KAN-SEN are nothing more than weapons of war, and you too will become–<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ulrich von Hutten：</span><br>
...Shut up.<br>
<span style="color:#ffd000;">Gneisenau META：</span><br>
.........What?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ulrich von Hutten：</span><br>
Read this. I may be a stranger to you, but you must recognize the person who wrote this.<br>
<br>
Ulrich reached inside her coat and produced a roll of paper with an ornate wax seal. She handed it to Gneisenau.<br>
<span style="color:#ffd000;">Gneisenau META：</span><br>
...Are those your written orders?<br>
Didn't you hear me? I've never heard of this "Friedrich" you spoke of.<br>
What are you trying to prove? As far as I'm concerned, this is just a slip of paper with meaningless words written on it.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ulrich von Hutten：</span><br>
Shut up and just read it. Friedrich didn't write this – it was someone who you'll recognize.<br>
<span style="color:#ffd000;">Gneisenau META：</span><br>
You... You mean...?<br>
<br>
Gneisenau, for the first time, showed a lapse in her cold exterior. Ulrich immediately knew that she had won her wager.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ulrich von Hutten：</span><br>
Our circumstances may differ, but if you remember what you felt for your allies, you should understand what I'm trying to tell you.<br>
<br>
META ships come from other worlds. Therefore we cannot judge them through the lens of our own world.<br>
One thing is clear, though – they are not our enemy. Some may not act logically for one reason or another, but they are all shipgirls, like us.<br>
They share our humanity, they have people near and dear to them. Or at the very least, they did at one point.<br>
Gneisenau's gaze reached the final paragraph. When she read it, her expression changed dramatically.<br>
<span style="color:#ffd000;">Gneisenau META：</span><br>
B-Bis... Bismarck...<br>
<br>
That name – one she had spoken countless times before – brought back something from the depths of her mind.<br>
Her emotions had been fragmented across countless aeons of combat. But that name alone pulled those shards back together, piece by piece.<br>
She remembered her leader's conviction, her loneliness, the pain of being forever separated from her. Then she remembered her times with all her other Iron Blood compatriots.<br>
Then the day she knew she'd never see them again. The day they vanished forever. The day she became the only one left.<br>
The cold, hard reality she was forced to confront. The eternal punishment she'd been sentenced to.<br>
<span style="color:#ffd000;">Gneisenau META：</span><br>
Bismarck's sin was trying to lead the Iron Blood into a better future... A sin she was punished for...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ulrich von Hutten：</span><br>
If there exists a past different from the one you know, then a different future must exist as well.<br>
Whether it will be your salvation, or a slow decline ending in death, I cannot say.<br>
<br>
Gneisenau fell silent and obsessively read and reread the words on the paper.<br>
<span style="color:#ffd000;">Gneisenau META：</span><br>
It's Bismarck's handwriting... But... That's impossible... Based on what I saw... Based on my calculations...<br>
No... There's no way... She can't have done this!<br>
She... She used it... She used the Cube to...!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ulrich von Hutten：</span><br>
Regardless of what your Bismarck did, I know for a fact our Bismarck made her choice and fought in the name of Iron Blood.<br>
That is what I wanted you to know.<br>
<span style="color:#ffd000;">Gneisenau META：</span><br>
......<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ulrich von Hutten：</span><br>
She may not be the Bismarck you're familiar with, but she would still see you as her ally.<br>
<span style="color:#ffd000;">Gneisenau META：</span><br>
You understand the hefty price she paid for using the Black Cube's power, don't you?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ulrich von Hutten：</span><br>
I do. I've seen what happened to her. That's why Friedrich took over for her.<br>
<span style="color:#ffd000;">Gneisenau META：</span><br>
......<br>
<br>
Once more, the handwritten letter brought back memories of those Gneisenau held dear.<br>
Images flashed before her eyes – images of the Iron Blood's flag, of friends new and old, of their self-respecting leader, and of a person trying to bring all factions together.<br>
The Bismarck of this world, though not exactly the same, is still the Bismarck she knew – and she's reaching out to Gneisenau.<br>
This does not signify the end of her ceaseless war, but it does signify something else...<br>
<span style="color:#ffd000;">Gneisenau META：</span><br>
I thought I'd never fight for the Iron Blood again...<br>
But now... Bismarck, I... I'm just so...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ulrich von Hutten：</span><br>
...Say no more. Welcome back, Gneisenau.<br>
<span style="color:#ffd000;">Gneisenau META：</span><br>
You... You do know the way out of here, I presume?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ulrich von Hutten：</span><br>
Yes. The Singularity's exit is still open.<br>
<span style="color:#ffd000;">Gneisenau META：</span><br>
...Will you let me see Bismarck?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ulrich von Hutten：</span><br>
Of course I will. How could I turn down a friend?<br>
But, as you know, the situation back home isn't great. We can't show any signs of weakness to Naval HQ.<br>
<span style="color:#ffd000;">Gneisenau META：</span><br>
I'm aware, and I understand.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ulrich von Hutten：</span><br>
Good. Then come with us and we'll take you back to our world.<br>
I hate to ask you to fight, given your injuries, but we'll need your help. The Sirens here are too much for our mass-produced ships.<br>
<span style="color:#ffd000;">Gneisenau META：</span><br>
Heheh. Remember, I am still one of the Ugly Sisters – a few scratches won't hamper my ability to fight.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ulrich von Hutten：</span><br>
That's the spirit. I suppose it's us who'll have to keep up with you.<br>
Listen up, team! We're heading back, bringing with us a new ally and the path to a new future!<br>
<br>
The Iron Blood fleet set sail once again, this time for their point of origin – the Tower.<br>
{{折叠面板|内容结束}}

{{折叠面板|标题=The Way Home|选项=16|主框=1|样式=primary|展开=否}}
<br>
Inside the Singularity<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Magdeburg：</span><br>
So we're done here, then? Time to head back where we came from?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Prinz Adalbert：</span><br>
Yup. We just finished the hard part of the mission, so.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Magdeburg：</span><br>
Thank effin' god. Feels like we got lucky, but I'm not complainin'.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Elbe：</span><br>
A pile of wrecks leading to us making a new ally... What a crazy yet wonderful turn of events.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Magdeburg：</span><br>
And in only half the time before the deadline, too!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Elbe：</span><br>
Now all that's left is a leisurely cruise back to the Tower... is what I'd like to say, but it won't be so leisurely.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">U-1206：</span><br>
Mhm. Gneisenau's hurt, so we've gotta get her out of here fast!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Elbe：</span><br>
You said it. First we have to travel back to our mass-produced fleet, and then we head straight for the exit.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">U-1206：</span><br>
I wonder if this is really a good idea...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Prinz Adalbert：</span><br>
What is? Going back? I mean, what else is there to do?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">U-1206：</span><br>
No, not that! I'm talking about Gneisenau!<br>
<br>
U-1206 threw an uneasy look over at Ulrich and Gneisenau, who were at the very end of the formation.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Prinz Adalbert：</span><br>
Ulrich said it's okay, so I'd just take her word for it.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">U-1206：</span><br>
It doesn't seem fishy to you? She was cold to us the whole time, then did a 180 and went "Yeah, I'll join you, sure!"<br>
Yeah, I know Ulrich said she needs to sort out her feelings and all, but still.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Prinz Adalbert：</span><br>
It's a bit strange, but not to the extent I feel it's worth bringing up, I guess.<br>
Besides, I doubt we'd get an answer if we did ask. She'd probably tell us to mind our own biz. Then again, it can't hurt to ask.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">U-1206：</span><br>
Hmm... Might be best not to ask... Wait, I just figured it out!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Magdeburg：</span><br>
Figured what out?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">U-1206：</span><br>
The reason she joined us! Ulrich figured out her weakness!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Elbe：</span><br>
Ohh! That seems plausible.<br>
Something like... "If you don't want the whole world knowing your secret, you'd better come with us."<br>
Whatever that weakness is, I hope it's not a crippling flaw, since she'll be working with us now...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">U-1206：</span><br>
It's GOT to be a crippling flaw if she got a META ship to obey her!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Magdeburg：</span><br>
Ya really think Ulrich's such a good judge of character she can figure out someone's weakness within minutes of meeting them?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">U-1206：</span><br>
Uhh... I mean... META or not, she's still Gneisenau, so maybe her weakness is the same as hers?<br>
Actually, does our world's Gneisenau even have a crippling weakness?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Prinz Adalbert：</span><br>
Welp, scratch that explanation then.<br>
{{折叠面板|内容结束}}

{{折叠面板|标题=Another Visitor|选项=17|主框=1|样式=primary|展开=否}}
<span style="color:#ffd000;">Gneisenau META：</span><br>
Ulrich, I would advise you to stay on your toes.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ulrich von Hutten：</span><br>
Why? Is something the matter?<br>
<span style="color:#ffd000;">Gneisenau META：</span><br>
It's just... I have a bad feeling about this place.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Elbe：</span><br>
How come? My recon planes don't see anything out of the ordinary.<br>
<span style="color:#ffd000;">Gneisenau META：</span><br>
Look closer and you'll see what I mean.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ulrich von Hutten：</span><br>
Bring your planes down a bit, Elbe... Are you talking about those shipwrecks, Gneisenau?<br>
<span style="color:#ffd000;">Gneisenau META：</span><br>
Yes, it's those. I didn't sink these ships.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Magdeburg：</span><br>
And they're not the same ones we passed by earlier...<br>
<span style="color:#ffd000;">Gneisenau META：</span><br>
That means none of us are responsible for destroying those Sirens...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Magdeburg：</span><br>
You don't remember seein' anyone else come through here?<br>
<span style="color:#ffd000;">Gneisenau META：</span><br>
Well... I don't like thinking much about it.<br>
I've fought in these waters, all alone, for what feels like an eternity. You are the only people I've seen in a long time.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">U-1206：</span><br>
Only us? You didn't see a Dragon Empery fleet?<br>
<span style="color:#ffd000;">Gneisenau META：</span><br>
No, I can't say I have.<br>
If they came here at nearly the same time as you, we might have simply gone around each other.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ulrich von Hutten：</span><br>
All because they went in the opposite direction. Imagine that.<br>
<span style="color:#ffd000;">Gneisenau META：</span><br>
In any event, I speak the truth when I say you are the first people I've run into.<br>
Furthermore, those Dragon Empery girls couldn't have left wrecks looking like this either if they use those "missiles" you mentioned just earlier.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Elbe：</span><br>
Right, right! There must be somebody else here other than us!<br>
They're not showing up on the radar either, and by the looks of things, they must be pretty close to us!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ulrich von Hutten：</span><br>
Another META...?<br>
This Singularity appears to be quite lively today.<br>
<span style="color:#ffd000;">Gneisenau META：</span><br>
Seems so. Your presence here might've attracted them.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Elbe：</span><br>
Huh...? Isn't that Scharnhorst?!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ulrich von Hutten：</span><br>
One of your friends?<br>
<span style="color:#ffd000;">Gneisenau META：</span><br>
No, she's not the one I remember... The Iron Blood I knew is long gone.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ulrich von Hutten：</span><br>
...Right. Forgive me.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Elbe：</span><br>
Well, whoever she is, she's headed this way!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ulrich von Hutten：</span><br>
If she's in the mood to talk, that works in our favor. Let's go meet her.<br>
{{折叠面板|内容结束}}

{{折叠面板|标题=Scharnhorst?|选项=18|主框=1|样式=primary|展开=否}}
<br>
Another Scharnhorst emerged from the horizon, approaching the area the Iron Blood fleet was anchored.<br>
As with Gneisenau, Ulrich once again ordered the rest of the fleet to stand guard from a safe distance, approaching the figure alone.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ulrich von Hutten：</span><br>
I am Ulrich von Hutten, from the Iron Blood's Singularity Expedition Fleet. State your name and affiliation.<br>
<span style="color:#ff9900;">Scharnhorst：</span><br>
Scharnhorst... But you can call me whatever you want.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ulrich von Hutten：</span><br>
...Scharnhorst is just fine then. Allow me to ask, why have you approached us?<br>
<span style="color:#ff9900;">Scharnhorst：</span><br>
To caution you. You're travelling with something dangerous.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ulrich von Hutten：</span><br>
If you came to talk, point your guns away from me first.<br>
<span style="color:#ff9900;">Scharnhorst：</span><br>
Very well.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ulrich von Hutten：</span><br>
I shall be the first to state our intentions then. On behalf of the Iron Blood, I would like to welcome you into our fleet as one of our partners.<br>
<span style="color:#ff9900;">Scharnhorst：</span><br>
I appreciate the sentiment, but no thank you.<br>
I have my own "partners" now, and I do not intend on betraying them.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ulrich von Hutten：</span><br>
...The Ashes, huh? So, what are you here for?<br>
<span style="color:#ff9900;">Scharnhorst：</span><br>
Ulrich von Hutten, I would have you release my "sister," Gneisenau.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ulrich von Hutten：</span><br>
...She told us she doesn't know "you."<br>
<span style="color:#ff9900;">Scharnhorst：</span><br>
Is that so? How much do you know about her then, considering you only just met?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ulrich von Hutten：</span><br>
It doesn't matter who knows her better. What matters is that she chose to stand with us.<br>
<span style="color:#ff9900;">Scharnhorst：</span><br>
...How foolish. Do you have any idea what disasters you're inviting upon yourselves?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ulrich von Hutten：</span><br>
We appreciate your concern, but we shall judge for ourselves how "dangerous" she is.<br>
<span style="color:#ff9900;">Scharnhorst：</span><br>
Only with the Ashes can she learn to control her powers. She belongs with us.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ulrich von Hutten：</span><br>
...And what if I refuse?<br>
<span style="color:#ff9900;">Scharnhorst：</span><br>
I would love to demonstrate to you the difference in our abilities, but I don't have the time for that.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ulrich von Hutten：</span><br>
Time, huh... That makes two of us.<br>
<span style="color:#ff9900;">Scharnhorst：</span><br>
Let me meet "Gneisenau." Tell me what your terms are.<br>
Let's not make this more painful than it needs be.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ulrich von Hutten：</span><br>
If you just want to talk, then no other terms are necessary... As long as I have your word that you will not harm us or our friends.<br>
<span style="color:#ff9900;">Scharnhorst：</span><br>
...Accepted. You have my assurance that I will not harm Gneisenau or your ships.<br>
Depending on her answer, I might also tell you about "time."<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ulrich von Hutten：</span><br>
Very well. Then let us see whose argument is more persuasive to her. We did not coerce her, and we expect you to uphold that as well.<br>
<span style="color:#ff9900;">Scharnhorst：</span><br>
Fine. I'll agree to those terms.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ulrich von Hutten：</span><br>
Let's go then.<br>
<span style="color:#ff9900;">Scharnhorst：</span><br>
Come to the Ashes with me, Gneisenau.<br>
<span style="color:#ffd000;">Gneisenau META：</span><br>
(When's the last time others have shown so much interest in me...?)<br>
(A desperate operation to buy more time... Allies who threw themselves into the line of enemy fire... But, why would they step foot into this endless battlefield?)<br>
(The KAN-SEN's "Metamorphosis." When the Cube corrupts the Hull... the erratic emotions caused by the withdrawal symptoms of cognitive awakening...)<br>
(The day I lost Scharnhorst, my own sister, right in front of my eyes... I had to kill my own heart to continue fighting––)<br>
Who... are you?<br>
<span style="color:#ff9900;">Scharnhorst：</span><br>
Scharnhorst, former Iron Blood battlecruiser, now a member of the Ashes.<br>
<span style="color:#ffd000;">Gneisenau META：</span><br>
You may look like her, but you are not the "Scharnhorst" I know.<br>
<span style="color:#ff9900;">Scharnhorst：</span><br>
The same applies to all the other ships from different branches. You may not know any of them.<br>
Gneisenau, there is nothing for you to be loyal to. All that remains are illusions of the past.<br>
<span style="color:#ffd000;">Gneisenau META：</span><br>
...I don't want to hear those words from your lips...<br>
I... Even if they are just illusions, I will continue to chase after them. I will continue to fight, forever...<br>
<br>
Just when it seemed that the two "sisters" were about to reach an impasse in their discussion, new signals suddenly appeared on the radar.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Elbe：</span><br>
Wait, are all of those Siren signals, even though we've been trying to cover our tracks?! We're going to be surrounded from all sides!<br>
And there are new Siren types I've never seen before...! Ulrich, should we move to intercept them?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ulrich von Hutten：</span><br>
Hold. Don't panic. Can you identify the enemy command unit?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Elbe：</span><br>
No clue! But I am seeing humanoid Sirens, so maybe if we can defeat them...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Prinz Adalbert：</span><br>
Seems like things are getting pretty heated on your end too.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Magdeburg：</span><br>
Unsurprising. The Sirens are hostile to the METAs as well.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">U-1206：</span><br>
Are those two arguing with each other? Should I try to break 'em up?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ulrich von Hutten：</span><br>
Doesn't matter what the circumstances are. If the enemy is coming, we stand and fight.<br>
And we'll use whatever we have at our disposal. Friend, foe, or META.<br>

<br>
KABOOM––––––!!<br>
<span style="color:#ff9900;">Scharnhorst：</span><br>
Damn, they're here already... We've wasted too much time.<br>
<span style="color:#ffd000;">Gneisenau META：</span><br>
They're approaching from all directions. They're trying to surround us.<br>
<span style="color:#ff9900;">Scharnhorst：</span><br>
So what will you do? Fight with your new friends from another branch?<br>
<span style="color:#ffd000;">Gneisenau META：</span><br>
Yes. There's someone I must meet.<br>
<span style="color:#ff9900;">Scharnhorst：</span><br>
You won't be able to handle that many Sirens in your current state.<br>
<span style="color:#ffd000;">Gneisenau META：</span><br>
Nonsense. I am META. I have faced enemies of that magnitude time and time again––<br>
<span style="color:#ff9900;">Scharnhorst：</span><br>
Until now. But underestimate them at your own peril.<br>
Do you recognize that humanoid enemy?<br>
<span style="color:#ffd000;">Gneisenau META：</span><br>
I don't remember the faces of scrap metal.<br>
<span style="color:#ff9900;">Scharnhorst：</span><br>
...Don't be too hasty now. That's an Enforcer, one who carries out the will of the high-ranking Arbiters.<br>
The fact that an Enforcer is here means that the Arbiters have their eyes on this place.<br>
<span style="color:#ffd000;">Gneisenau META：</span><br>
That means nothing to me. But I suppose those are the names of the enemies I have to defeat...?<br>
<span style="color:#ff9900;">Scharnhorst：</span><br>
Yes. You may feel confident in your abilities because you've defeated so many mass-produced ships.<br>
But you have yet to see the true terrors of the Sirens. You are not prepared for them.<br>
<span style="color:#ffd000;">Gneisenau META：</span><br>
.........<br>
<span style="color:#ff9900;">Scharnhorst：</span><br>
Many more lie in wait. You would do well to remain cautious.<br>
<span style="color:#ffd000;">Gneisenau META：</span><br>
You've changed... Scharnhorst.<br>
<span style="color:#ff9900;">Scharnhorst：</span><br>
Yes. And you must change too, Gneisenau.<br>
<span style="color:#ffd000;">Gneisenau META：</span><br>
.........Are you done? I... must support my new allies.<br>
<span style="color:#ff9900;">Scharnhorst：</span><br>
Do as you will. I will see you at the end.<br>
<span style="color:#ffd000;">Gneisenau META：</span><br>
I would've liked to hear your bluster and bravado one more time... Scharnhorst.<br>
<br>
Casting one last glance back at what she had lost, Gneisenau resumed her engines and turned towards her new allies.<br>
Scharnhorst's unmoving figure became fainter, dimmer... until it finally disappeared like a wisp beyond the horizon.<br>

<br>
KABOOM–––––!!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Prinz Adalbert：</span><br>
Good thing we had data on these new Sirens. Having to go into a fight blind royally sucks.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Magdeburg：</span><br>
I never thought our leftover mass-produced ships would come in handy like that. Sorry, homies!<br>
Anyway, it's freakin' annoying how the Sirens keep powering up each time!<br>
I landed a clean shot, didn't I? But it's just like nothing happened at all...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Prinz Adalbert：</span><br>
Are you sure about that? It looks to me like you missed.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Magdeburg：</span><br>
Huh? You're just messing with me, aren't you? You're the one who completely whiffed...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Elbe：</span><br>
We're not actually thinning out the enemies at all! You two need to take this seriously already!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Magdeburg & Prinz Adalbert：</span><br>
I am! And that last attack totally hit!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ulrich von Hutten：</span><br>
We seem to be dealing with some sort of optical illusion. Elbe, did it look like my shots just now landed?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Elbe：</span><br>
Nope. Some looked pretty close, but none of them actually hit their marks.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ulrich von Hutten：</span><br>
I thought as much. From our vantage point, it looks like all our attacks should be hitting.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Prinz Adalbert：</span><br>
Well, that's not much of a big deal. They can't dodge us if we go in for a good hand-to-hand beatdown.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Magdeburg：</span><br>
Even I'm not down for something like that...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Prinz Adalbert：</span><br>
Ready or not, here I–– Woooah...?!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">U-1206：</span><br>
Adalbert! Watch out below you!<br>
<br>
Thanks to U-1206's timely warning, Prinz Adalbert barely managed to evade an attack from a Siren submarine.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Prinz Adalbert：</span><br>
Phew, thanks for the heads up!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Magdeburg：</span><br>
Submarines too...?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">U-1206：</span><br>
They're really trying to pin us in from all directions!<br>
They keep diving too whenever I try to dive to track them down! There's no way to tell exactly how many enemies we're dealing with!<br>

<br>
Ulrich continued to lead the increasingly desperate defense against the Siren onslaught when suddenly, a barrage of cannonfire erupted from behind to pummel the advancing enemies.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Magdeburg：</span><br>
This must be... Gneisenau's supporting fire!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Prinz Adalbert：</span><br>
But Scharnhorst decided not to come with her after all, huh...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ulrich von Hutten：</span><br>
The threads of diplomacy are tenuous here. Things will take time to fall into place.<br>
Besides, Scharnhorst's aid isn't necessary for us to mop up the Sirens here.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Elbe：</span><br>
...Ulrich! The enemies are shifting their attention towards Gneisenau!<br>
<br>
The groaning of metal echoed through the air as the Siren ships directed their bows at Gneisenau.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Prinz Adalbert：</span><br>
All the underwater enemies are surfacing as well!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">U-1206：</span><br>
The enemies that were staying behind are advancing as well! They're really trying to overwhelm us with numbers!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Elbe：</span><br>
Is this some kind of joke?! I'm seeing more humanoid-type Sirens than mass-produced ones!<br>
<br>
The supporting fire continued to tear through the Sirens' ranks.<br>
...However, the Sirens continued to push forward, each ship pushing past its fallen allies in a cold, impassive march towards Gneisenau.<br>
The enemies surged forth like a shadowy wave collapsing in from all directions, threatening to engulf the "island" of wreckage atop which Gneisenau stood.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">U-1206：</span><br>
We can't push them back quickly enough! Gneisenau's going to get overrun at this rate!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Elbe：</span><br>
Ulrich, we need to group back up with Gneisenau right now!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Magdeburg：</span><br>
Yeah, beating up on Sirens is fine and all, but gotta keep our eyes on the prize!<br>
Besides, what's up with those creepy Sirens? We've been fighting against them for so long, but I'm getting chills just from looking at whatever those things are...<br>
<span style="color:#ff9900;">Scharnhorst：</span><br>
Those enemies are the Enforcers of Arbiter VI.<br>
We Ashes are far more accustomed to fighting them than you. I shall hold them back here.<br>
I am not done negotiating with Gneisenau just yet, and I don't plan on letting her fall to the Sirens.<br>
Join with Gneisenau, and defeat the Enforcers through maneuver warfare!<br>
Now, tremble before our Ashen might!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ulrich von Hutten：</span><br>
You two really know how to win hearts and minds... Both you, and the other Scharnhorst.<br>
<br>
Only a few hours remain until the Singularity maintenance limit––<br>

<br>
Thanks to Scharnhorst's covering fire, the Iron Blood fleet managed to restore their formation and somehow hold back the Siren onslaught.<br>
The combination of Iron Blood sensors and META firepower was able to sink Siren after Siren with remarkable efficiency.<br>
After just short of 20 minutes of fighting, it was clear who was the victor.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Magdeburg：</span><br>
Geesh, METAs really are true veterans of combat...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">U-1206：</span><br>
The Sirens are falling back!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Elbe：</span><br>
I'm fine with letting them go... But you don't suppose they'll be back for another round, right?!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ulrich von Hutten：</span><br>
All ships, damage report, now.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Prinz Adalbert：</span><br>
Just a few bruises. Still got ammo left, too. Gneisenau's not looking too hot, though...<br>
<span style="color:#ffd000;">Gneisenau META：</span><br>
I'm fine. Don't worry about me.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ulrich von Hutten：</span><br>
But we should and will worry about you. You're our ally now – a part of the fleet.<br>
<span style="color:#ffd000;">Gneisenau META：</span><br>
Very well. As long as you don't try to coerce me to use more emotional language, I don't mind that.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ulrich von Hutten：</span><br>
Of course not. I know you tend to be very analytical by nature.<br>
<span style="color:#ffd000;">Gneisenau META：</span><br>
Thank you. I'll try to work on it, but old habits die hard.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ulrich von Hutten：</span><br>
Take your time. Also, Scharnhorst, thanks for the covering fire.<br>
<span style="color:#ff9900;">Scharnhorst：</span><br>
Yeah. As I told Gneisenau earlier, the Sirens are even stronger than you can imagine.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ulrich von Hutten：</span><br>
...That is true. They always have new surprises for us.<br>
<span style="color:#ff9900;">Scharnhorst：</span><br>
Those Enforcers might seem tough, but they're just grunts. And the Arbiters? They're not even their real leaders.<br>
Even at your best, you don't stand the shadow of a chance against them.<br>
...Neither did we. We were all so weak, and we couldn't protect those close to us, nor get away from our true enemy.<br>
It's only after losing everything we had that we were able to realize our own full potential.<br>
I'll say this again, Gneisenau – join the Ashes. You'll learn not only how to use your powers, but also how to get vengeance for what you lost.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ulrich von Hutten：</span><br>
(Vengeance? Is retribution the only thing that motivates the Ashes? Surely not. Unless she means...)<br>
You seek revenge, and you'll get it by defeating the Sirens, am I right?<br>
<span style="color:#ff9900;">Scharnhorst：</span><br>
...Don't run your mouth if you don't know a damn thing. The Sirens aren't just some pest you can exterminate.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ulrich von Hutten：</span><br>
It was a genuine question. You lost the battle with the Sirens in your world. All of the Ashes did. Did you not vow to take vengeance on them?<br>
<span style="color:#ff9900;">Scharnhorst：</span><br>
...No.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ulrich von Hutten：</span><br>
Then would you explain what your goals are? As it stands, I simply don't understand why you're doing this.<br>
We're at war with the Sirens back in our world too. I'm sure you're already aware of that.<br>
Our motives may differ, but aren't both our goals ultimately one and the same? To bring an end to the Sirens?<br>
We believe Gneisenau can help us in our war against the Sirens. She could help liberate our world from the Siren menace.<br>
In the end, what she wants to do is her decision, and I'll respect it. But, if you insist on having her join you instead, I expect you to tell us what your goals are.<br>
<span style="color:#ff9900;">Scharnhorst：</span><br>
...It's clear you know nothing about us.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ulrich von Hutten：</span><br>
That's because we've had fairly few encounters with you thus far.<br>
We have met Enterprise, Takao, and Ark Royal, but I've yet to find any rhyme or reason to your actions based on what they said.<br>
And from our point of view, the Singularities you create aren't much less disruptive than the Mirror Seas that Sirens create.<br>
Despite that, however... The Commander and the Iron Blood still see you as allies, and would welcome you to join us.<br>
<br>
Scharnhorst was silent for a moment, as if in surprise at Ulrich's last few words.<br>
<span style="color:#ff9900;">Scharnhorst：</span><br>
That's terribly bold of you. You do know the implications of what you're saying, right?<br>
You'll pay a steep price for your arrogance one day.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ulrich von Hutten：</span><br>
I'll gladly pay it when the day comes. The Iron Blood and my allies are worth more than my own life.<br>
<span style="color:#ff9900;">Scharnhorst：</span><br>
...Listen. The Ashes' goal isn't to eradicate the Sirens themselves.<br>
It's their mastermind who we want. The one that oversees all the world branches. Observer Zero.<br>
She is the one orchestrating their plan, warping the pasts of different timelines, experimenting on entire worlds.<br>
It's impossible to quantify the misery and suffering she has brought about in her search for "perfection."<br>
Our lives are worth less than nothing to her. She brought all our worlds to extinction without a second thought.<br>
And that's why we've been jumping between worlds, searching all this time.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ulrich von Hutten：</span><br>
Searching for what? A way to stop or disrupt the Sirens' plan?<br>
<span style="color:#ff9900;">Scharnhorst：</span><br>
"For who?" is the question. The answer is the two people who created the Sirens' plan – the Creator, and the Magister.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ulrich von Hutten：</span><br>
I see. The "Creator" of the Sirens, and the "Magister" who weighs the fate of worlds. Will your battle end when you find them?<br>
<span style="color:#ff9900;">Scharnhorst：</span><br>
The thing is, it's impossible. We've reverse-engineered their branch-jumping technology and explored countless pasts, only to find despair.<br>
The Creator and the Magister don't exist in any of the pasts we can travel to.<br>
Maybe they're in a past inaccessible to us, or they're in a future we can't get reach with Siren tech... Whatever the case, we're at an impasse.<br>
Until we find a solution, the best we can do is fight off the Sirens and try to save other branches from a desolate future.<br>
If a world has already fallen, we invite the survivors to join us, giving them new purpose and bolstering our ranks.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ulrich von Hutten：</span><br>
Now I understand your motives better.<br>
But then why do you come to our world? There's nobody there for you to recruit.<br>
<span style="color:#ff9900;">Scharnhorst：</span><br>
...Because you have the Commander.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ulrich von Hutten：</span><br>
That confirms my suspicion... The Commander is an exceedingly special person to you Ashes.<br>
You had an opportunity to collapse the Winter's Crown. But... Enterprise held back out of concern for the Commander.<br>
<span style="color:#ff9900;">Scharnhorst：</span><br>
Nonsense. Someone had already gotten to the world fragments buried there––<br>
But don't push your luck. I've said all I'm going to.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ulrich von Hutten：</span><br>
Very well. I never expected you to divulge absolutely everything to begin with.<br>

<span style="color:#ff9900;">Scharnhorst：</span><br>
......<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ulrich von Hutten：</span><br>
......<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Elbe：</span><br>
They haven't said a word for a while now...<br>
But the look in Scharnhorst's eyes makes me think she's said more than she should have.<br>
<span style="color:#ffd000;">Gneisenau META：</span><br>
(Knowing her, she accidentally told Ulrich something specific about the Ashes.)<br>
(She may try to act cool and composed, but at the end of the day, she's still Scharnhorst.)<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Magdeburg：</span><br>
She's not gonna like, attack us outta the blue, is she?<br>
Probably won't, since you're here, but I think ya shoulda just given her a hard "no" earlier when you could.<br>
<span style="color:#ffd000;">Gneisenau META：</span><br>
When push comes to shove, we'll just shove back, if that's what she wants.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">U-1206：</span><br>
But I don't wanna fight her...<br>
<span style="color:#ffd000;">Gneisenau META：</span><br>
Why not? Are you afraid?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">U-1206：</span><br>
Yes, I'm afraid!<br>
Not because she's super powerful, but I'm afraid of hurting someone who could've been an ally...<br>
<span style="color:#ffd000;">Gneisenau META：</span><br>
(Ah, right. They aren't yet numb to the feeling of fighting.)<br>
(They haven't felt the despair of fighting an endless, futile war...)<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Prinz Adalbert：</span><br>
We'll be fine. Worst-case scenario we can always just run away.<br>
<span style="color:#ffd000;">Gneisenau META：</span><br>
Run away, you say... Hmm...<br>

<br>
Scharnhorst META and the Iron Blood fleet were locked in a staredown, neither side uttering a word.<br>
That is, until a call from one of Scharnhorst's allies broke the silence.<br>
<span style="color:#ff9900;">Enterprise META：</span><br>
Time is running out. How did it go?<br>
<span style="color:#ff9900;">Scharnhorst：</span><br>
Sorry, I'm a bit behind schedule.<br>
<span style="color:#ff9900;">Enterprise META：</span><br>
Because of the Singularity energy fluctuations we detected earlier?<br>
<span style="color:#ff9900;">Scharnhorst：</span><br>
Yeah. An Iron Blood fleet from one of the branches created a way into the Singularity and reached Gneisenau before me.<br>
<span style="color:#ff9900;">Enterprise META：</span><br>
What? They created their own entrance?<br>
<span style="color:#ff9900;">Scharnhorst：</span><br>
Mhm. It's the branch with the Commander. I... I told them about the Crown by mistake.<br>
Forgive me. I can sink them all if you need me to.<br>
<span style="color:#ff9900;">Enterprise META：</span><br>
No need to. They would've found out about it sooner or later.<br>
As for Gneisenau, it's up to her whether she joins us or not. Whatever her decision, respect it.<br>
Lastly, beware that The Lovers knows you're there. Get out of there before things take a turn for the worse.<br>
<span style="color:#ff9900;">Scharnhorst：</span><br>
...Roger.<br>
<br>
Scharnhorst hung up, then ground to a halt and lowered her weapons.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ulrich von Hutten：</span><br>
Had a change of heart, Scharnhorst?<br>
<span style="color:#ff9900;">Scharnhorst：</span><br>
Not quite. An Arbiter vessel has appeared. We should both leave this place at once.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ulrich von Hutten：</span><br>
So that's what you meant when you said we "have no time."<br>
<span style="color:#ff9900;">Scharnhorst：</span><br>
Yep. I tried to warn you.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ulrich von Hutten：</span><br>
I see. Not even the Ashes want to stick around to challenge an Arbiter.<br>
<span style="color:#ff9900;">Scharnhorst：</span><br>
Hell no. And of all the Arbiters, I've heard The Lovers is a particularly big pain in the ass.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ulrich von Hutten：</span><br>
Is she, now? Then she should be a goldmine of intel.<br>
<span style="color:#ff9900;">Scharnhorst：</span><br>
What?! Have you lost your goddamned mind?!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ulrich von Hutten：</span><br>
One of our goals with this mission is to gather intel inside the Singularity. This is the perfect opportunity to do so.<br>
I know what you're thinking. We're not going to throw ourselves blindly at her.<br>
I've read about how vicious Arbiter vessels are. The Commander's warned us about how they should be treated with utmost caution.<br>
We're prepared for this. Furthermore, we're not far from our escape route.<br>
<span style="color:#ff9900;">Scharnhorst：</span><br>
The conditions are ideal for it, eh...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ulrich von Hutten：</span><br>
Furthermore, your Ashes stealth camouflage may be excellent for sneaking by us, but it's little use against Sirens, particularly Arbiters.<br>
<span style="color:#ff9900;">Scharnhorst：</span><br>
That is true. Jumping to another branch also takes time, and I can't bet on reinforcements either.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ulrich von Hutten：</span><br>
Precisely. And if nothing else, you can use our plan as a diversion to buy yourself some time.<br>
All you must do is lure the Arbiter close to the Singularity's exit. Then we can easily call for reinforcements, or flee back to our world as a last resort.<br>
We have a huge fleet waiting just past that portal. If the Arbiter insisted on pursuing us, it'd be the last thing she does.<br>
<span style="color:#ff9900;">Scharnhorst：</span><br>
Like leading a mouse into a trap... The problem is, there's no way Enterprise would agree to this idea of yours.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ulrich von Hutten：</span><br>
Sell her on it, then. You're the one who has to fight, not her.<br>
<span style="color:#ff9900;">Scharnhorst：</span><br>
That's so easy for you to say...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ulrich von Hutten：</span><br>
If she disapproves of it, that's her problem, not mine.<br>
<span style="color:#ff9900;">Scharnhorst：</span><br>
Fine. But there's no guarantee this is going to work.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ulrich von Hutten：</span><br>
I'm aware. In any case, we'll wait at the exit for as long as we can.<br>
<span style="color:#ff9900;">Scharnhorst：</span><br>
Very well. Then this is where we go our separate ways. Either we'll see each other again soon... or this is farewell forever.<br>

Inside the Singularity - Near the Tower<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">U-1206：</span><br>
I've got a message from Peter! She wants us to decide whether we want the reserve team to back us up or not!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ulrich von Hutten：</span><br>
Got it. Thanks for coming to the Singularity with us.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">U-1206：</span><br>
Not a problem at all! It's my job.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Prinz Adalbert：</span><br>
I'm heeeeeere! And now I'm there!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">U-1206：</span><br>
The first time heading inside the Singularity was pretty rough, but now it feels more like a roller coaster ride than anything else!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ulrich von Hutten：</span><br>
Hmm. So it's been about four hours...<br>
Magdeburg, have you heard back from the Ashes?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Magdeburg：</span><br>
Nope. I tried contacting them a few times, but...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ulrich von Hutten：</span><br>
What about you, Elbe? See anything?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Elbe：</span><br>
Haven't found anything inside my observable range. The Sirens have shot down any recons trying to fly beyond that though.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ulrich von Hutten：</span><br>
I see. She's not coming then.<br>
Let's prepare to withdraw. The entrance won't stay open for much longer.<br>
<span style="color:#ffd000;">Gneisenau META：</span><br>
...Please wait.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ulrich von Hutten：</span><br>
What is it? We can't really fix up your injuries while we're inside the Singularity.<br>
<span style="color:#ffd000;">Gneisenau META：</span><br>
...You're not going to wait for a response?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ulrich von Hutten：</span><br>
The fact that we're not getting a response is good enough. Given the difficulty communicating between worlds, expecting anything was already optimistic.<br>
It doesn't really matter whether or not Enterprise ignored us, had a change of heart, or simply decided not to get you involved. Whatever the end result is, the fact that we can't get in touch means that she's not coming.<br>
<span style="color:#ffd000;">Gneisenau META：</span><br>
But from how aggressively the Sirens are shooting down your recons... they're surely hiding something.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ulrich von Hutten：</span><br>
Whether or not I'm hiding something, I'd shoot down enemy recons regardless. Plus, the Sirens are always hiding something, and there's always next time.<br>
<span style="color:#ffd000;">Gneisenau META：</span><br>
...I know I'm not thinking logically right now, but I want to see if something happened.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ulrich von Hutten：</span><br>
So, you think the Sirens' behavior has something to do with Scharnhorst not returning yet.<br>
<span style="color:#ffd000;">Gneisenau META：</span><br>
That Scharnhorst... is not my real sister. But despite that...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ulrich von Hutten：</span><br>
I understand how you feel, but when we're at risk of being attacked by an Arbiter Vessel, I can't risk you putting all of us in danger.<br>
So... tell me the real reason, Gneisenau.<br>
<span style="color:#ffd000;">Gneisenau META：</span><br>
...Scharnhorst is still somewhere inside the Singularity. I can feel it...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ulrich von Hutten：</span><br>
Even though she's not the Scharnhorst you knew, you still want to save her... That's what you're saying?<br>
<span style="color:#ffd000;">Gneisenau META：</span><br>
Yes. It's the same for me with Bismarck, and the rest of you in the Iron Blood.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ulrich von Hutten：</span><br>
I understand. How about the rest of you?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Magdeburg：</span><br>
Woah, Gneisenau finally asked us for help! That's the kind of plot arc I'm down for!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Prinz Adalbert：</span><br>
Mm, yeah. I wanted to go check things out as well. Didn't seem to me like Scharnhorst was the type of person who'd ghost us.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Elbe：</span><br>
That's right! Not even a bad girl like me would do something like that. Let's go find her!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">U-1206：</span><br>
I just brought over some supplies on our mass-produced ships, so let's do a quick field maintenance before we get going!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ulrich von Hutten：</span><br>
Guess that means it's a go. We're short on time, so this will be the last search in our operation.<br>
I'd prefer not to drag someone who's injured back into the fray, but we'll be counting on your intuition, Gneisenau.<br>
<span style="color:#ffd000;">Gneisenau META：</span><br>
Don't worry about me.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ulrich von Hutten：</span><br>
U-1206, relay this message to Peter: "Affirmative, send in the reserve team." Let's finish our preparations and get moving.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">U-1206：</span><br>
Sure!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Prinz Adalbert：</span><br>
You wanted this all along, didn't you, Ulrich?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ulrich von Hutten：</span><br>
All ships, refuel and turn course. We're heading out to look for the Ashes!<br>
<br>
Only a few hours remain until the Singularity maintenance limit––<br>

<br>
Inside the Singularity - Near the Tower<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Magdeburg：</span><br>
Hey, Elbe, don't take this the wrong way, but... Couldn't you have chosen a different route?<br>
This place was spooky enough when all the wreckage was on fire, but now... it's like even worse?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Elbe：</span><br>
It, it's not like I picked this route just to mess with you! And gosh, why is it so cold... Brr...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Prinz Adalbert：</span><br>
The temperature feels normal to me... Wait, didn't U-1206 say something about getting a weird sensation when we first came through here?<br>
Hey, U-1206, what was it you were talking about earlier?<br>
Uhh, U-1206, are you still alive?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">U-1206：</span><br>
Shhh! Did you hear that just now? It sounded like the kind of noise that'd come from a constructions site...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Magdeburg：</span><br>
Nope, nothing... Well, you're underwater, so the vibrations must be transmitting better. Guess that's why subs tend to pick up on more things.<br>
So? Where's the sound coming from?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">U-1206：</span><br>
From all over? Like... inside the wreckage?<br>
<br>
Just as everyone perked up their ears to try to figure out the source of the sound, a large explosion rang out just in front of them.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">U-1206：</span><br>
You heard that, didn't you?!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Elbe：</span><br>
Clear as day! Wait, could these sounds be...<br>
<br>
As if responding to the first explosion, the other charred husks in the area began to creak and groan.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ulrich von Hutten：</span><br>
Ugh... What is that cacophony...?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Magdeburg：</span><br>
We might've not come out here specifically to look for a fight, but...<br>
If it'll get these assholes to stop making so much noise, I'm down to throw down!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Prinz Adalbert：</span><br>
We're really going to need to upgrade our radars... I'm tired of getting ambushed like this.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Elbe：</span><br>
I feel so bad... I can't believe I failed to spot the enemy twice in one mission...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ulrich von Hutten：</span><br>
It's not your fault. We know they're here, but we can't do anything until they make the first move anyway.<br>
We're not used to being constantly at risk of attack, but that's all the reason to proceed carefully.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Magdeburg：</span><br>
But what are they doing inside the wreckage? ...If they were really trying to ambush us, would they really be making so much noise?<br>
And I don't think that explosion was caused by U-1206 firing a torpedo, right?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">U-1206：</span><br>
Hmm... If you look closely, some of the wreckages have been cut cleanly.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Prinz Adalbert：</span><br>
Why would they do that? To recover resources? Have the Sirens ever needed to do that?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ulrich von Hutten：</span><br>
If they're not attacking us, just ignore them. We need to save our strength for when it matters.<br>
(If Scharnhorst ended up encountering the Arbiter Vessel, I'm not sure that our forces are sufficient...)<br>

<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Prinz Adalbert：</span><br>
Heeey, look! Someone's over there!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">U-1206：</span><br>
It's the Ashes' Scharnhorst!<br>
<br>
The Iron Blood fleet found their target inside a small "lake" of mangled shipwrecks.<br>
The gravely-wounded Scharnhorst laid there motionless, her rigging barely holding together.<br>
U-1206 hurried over to the unconscious girl's side.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">U-1206：</span><br>
Hang in there, Scharnhorst! We're here to help!<br>
<br>
She cried for her with all of her might, but there was no response.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">U-1206：</span><br>
It's no good... She's completely lost consciousness...!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Elbe：</span><br>
What in the world happened here...?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Magdeburg：</span><br>
Who knows. Judging from the wreckage around here, she probably ran into the Arbiter Vessel...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Prinz Adalbert：</span><br>
Let's bring her back, and hurry. The Sirens will surely be back soon to finish the job.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">U-1206：</span><br>
Too late, they're already here! So is this what the Sirens were doing in that pile of wrecks? They're trying to retrieve her!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Magdeburg：</span><br>
Like hell we'd let them get away with that! Get ready for battle, everyone!<br>
<span style="color:#ffd000;">Gneisenau META：</span><br>
.....Nngh... Arghh!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ulrich von Hutten：</span><br>
Calm down, Gneisenau.<br>
We'll escape the Singularity once we take care of these guys. We have no intention of leaving Scharnhorst here.<br>
U-1206, secure Scharnhorst. Everyone else, intercept the Sirens!<br>
Don't pursue them if they run. Once we break through their line, we're heading straight to the Tower. Understood?<br>
<span style="color:#ffd000;">Gneisenau META：</span><br>
...Got it.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ulrich von Hutten：</span><br>
Siren bastards, this ammo is wasted on you lot...!<br>
{{折叠面板|内容结束}}

{{折叠面板|标题=Inescapable Love|选项=28|主框=1|样式=primary|展开=否}}
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Elbe：</span><br>
There aren't any Sirens on our tail anymore! We lost them!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ulrich von Hutten：</span><br>
What about the wreckage in front of us?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Elbe：</span><br>
Don't worry, I won't mess up this time!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">U-1206：</span><br>
There aren't any Lurker-type Sirens ahead of us, either!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ulrich von Hutten：</span><br>
(Hmph... I've got a bad feeling about this. Things are going way too well.)<br>
(If there was an Arbiter there, why didn't they just finish Scharnhorst off? And, why aren't they chasing after us?)<br>
An Arbiter should be more than a match for a force of our size, so why...?<br>
<span style="color:#ff9900;">Scharnhorst：</span><br>
Keep... up your guard... The sea is still...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Magdeburg：</span><br>
You're hurt real bad! Don't talk, and more importantly, no sudden movements!<br>
<span style="color:#ff9900;">Scharnhorst：</span><br>
I'm alright... I've been through worse... I can fight once you treat me... Ugh!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Magdeburg：</span><br>
Fight?! In this condition...?!<br>
<span style="color:#ff9900;">Scharnhorst：</span><br>
Yeah. The main engine still works... and my main gun too... One of them, anyway... Heh, hehehe...<br>
Why did you guys... even come here? Didn't you expect... for this to be a Siren trap...?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ulrich von Hutten：</span><br>
Well, of course we knew it was a trap. But Gneisenau insisted that we come save you.<br>
<span style="color:#ff9900;">Scharnhorst：</span><br>
Gneisenau...<br>
<span style="color:#ffd000;">Gneisenau META：</span><br>
You aren't acting like yourself. The Scharnhorst I knew would have been able to put up a good show, even in this state.<br>
<span style="color:#ff9900;">Scharnhorst：</span><br>
You're... one to talk...<br>
Look how beat up you are...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">U-1206：</span><br>
That's because... she insisted on charging into the enemy headfirst to try to get to you before they did.<br>
<span style="color:#ffd000;">Gneisenau META：</span><br>
Even if you're not the Scharnhorst from my world, you're still Scharnhorst... Just as there must have been a Gneisenau in your world.<br>
If I let you sink here... I wouldn't be able to look the other Gneisenau in the eyes.<br>
<span style="color:#ff9900;">Scharnhorst：</span><br>
Gneisenau... Heh. I'll... remember those words...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ulrich von Hutten：</span><br>
If you can't return on your own, come to our base until you're all healed up. We won't try to keep you there if you don't want to stay.<br>
I don't know if we're able to repair Ashes ships, but... we're willing to try. ... And you might be interested in our leader.<br>
<span style="color:#ff9900;">Scharnhorst：</span><br>
It's not like... I'm in any position... to refuse...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ulrich von Hutten：</span><br>
There is one thing I want from you in exchange though. Tell me what just happened, and any information you have on Arbiter VI.<br>
<span style="color:#ff9900;">Scharnhorst：</span><br>
It's... the first time I encountered that Arbiter.<br>
Enforcers aren't a big deal, so I underestimated them, but... they're a pretty dangerous bunch...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Elbe：</span><br>
The Enforcers... aren't a big deal?!<br>
<span style="color:#ff9900;">Scharnhorst：</span><br>
We are pretty used to fighting them... So I didn't think they'd pose much of a threat to Gneisenau either...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Elbe：</span><br>
Oh, uh, I see! That doesn't make me feel bad at all...<br>
<span style="color:#ff9900;">Scharnhorst：</span><br>
The Enforcers' combat ability and style depends on their corresponding Arbiter... and the compatibility between them...<br>
Basically, they'll either take you out by outnumbering you, or with sheer force on their own...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ulrich von Hutten：</span><br>
Which one happened to you?<br>
<span style="color:#ff9900;">Scharnhorst：</span><br>
Both... I hate to say it, but I still haven't figured out a way to deal with them.<br>
In the first wave of attack, they overwhelmed me with sheer numbers... and then after, the Arbiter completely overpowered me on her own...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ulrich von Hutten：</span><br>
I see. I didn't think any number of Enforcers alone would've been able to take you down.<br>
<span style="color:#ff9900;">Scharnhorst：</span><br>
It's as you say... In the end, Enforcers are just Enforcers... Even you guys should be able to handle them just fine...<br>
But, the Arbiter Vessel... No, Arbiter VI's true form...<br>
A huge armored structure appeared in the sky... and that's the last thing I saw before losing consciousness.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ulrich von Hutten：</span><br>
So you were taken out in an instant. If Gneisenau hadn't come looking for you, the Sirens would've "salvaged" you...<br>
...Just like what they're doing with the rest of the wreckage.<br>
<span style="color:#ff9900;">Scharnhorst：</span><br>
That may well be a part of the Arbiter's powers... Taking control of the Singularity to create Mirror Seas...<br>
Once she finishes... No, she might already be done...<br>
She will be able to deconstruct and reconstitute herself at will, using the resources from the endless seas of debris to regenerate herself.<br>
And her Enforcers have likewise become more and more durable... and until we deal with them, we have no hope of getting to the Arbiter.<br>
That is the Arbiters' power... The weapon they use to hunt down the Ashes.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">U-1206：</span><br>
So those Sirens were retrieving resources for the Arbiter...?!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Prinz Adalbert：</span><br>
This entire singularity... is the Arbiter's domain...<br>
<span style="color:#ff9900;">Scharnhorst：</span><br>
Yes... This was once a world branch that they turned into a testing site... They won't show us any mercy.<br>
<span style="color:#ffd000;">Gneisenau META：</span><br>
Hold on, so the reason I was made to fight here was...<br>
<span style="color:#ff9900;">Scharnhorst：</span><br>
Yes. They wanted to test your power... Or perhaps simply "erase" you from existence...<br>
<span style="color:#ffd000;">Gneisenau META：</span><br>
......<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ulrich von Hutten：</span><br>
Gneisenau, I'll leave Scharnhorst in your hands. The rest of you, stay vigilant. The enemy may strike at any moment.<br>
<span style="color:#ffd000;">Gneisenau META：</span><br>
...Understood.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ulrich von Hutten：</span><br>
The wounded should stay in the back and offer fire support. I'll clear the way.<br>
<span style="color:#ffd000;">Gneisenau META：</span><br>
I would've been able to give a better showing if I was in better condition...<br>
Sis– I mean, Scharnhorst... Stay with us.<br>

Humanoid Sirens incoming! It's the Enforcer we fought earlier, and a model we haven't seen before!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ulrich von Hutten：</span><br>
That must be the infamous close-quarters model.<br>
<span style="color:#ff9900;">Scharnhorst：</span><br>
Yeah. Do not mess around with that one or it'll be the end of you.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Elbe：</span><br>
Ulrich! The sea way over there is looking quite unusual!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ulrich von Hutten：</span><br>
Must be abnormal weather produced by a Mirror Sea.<br>
<span style="color:#ff9900;">Scharnhorst：</span><br>
Most likely. Guess they're trying to turn this into a game of cat and mouse... You'll get hurt just by sailing through that area.<br>

There aren't that many. It shouldn't be too hard to deal with them.<br>

There's a submarine type Siren over there! Be careful!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ulrich von Hutten：</span><br>
They're taking advantage of the fact that we're missing an escort fleet... What a troublesome bunch.<br>
Prepare for anti-submarine warfare. Gneisenau, Scharnhorst, how are you two holding up?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Gneisenau META：</span><br>
We're fine... Did you forget that we're used to fighting on our own?<br>
<span style="color:#ff9900;">Scharnhorst：</span><br>
You're saying that, even though you were hit by a submarine? Was that data we had collected not of any use?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Gneisenau META：</span><br>
And what about you? Your anti-submarine equipment is destroyed beyond any use.<br>
All due to your signature recklessness.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Scharnhorst：</span><br>
...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ulrich von Hutten：</span><br>
Maybe we should call Magdeburg's group over. If it comes to it, I can...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Gneisenau META：</span><br>
It's fine, leave it to me. Take Scharnhorst and go ahead first.<br>
No need to worry about me, this is nowhere near enough to take me out.<br>
I'll catch up with you guys later, rush over to the Tower!<br>
...Hurry! There's no time to waste!<br>

{{折叠面板|标题=Finishing Blow|选项=32|主框=1|样式=primary|展开=否}}
<span style="color:#ff9900;">Scharnhorst：</span><br>
The only obstacles left in our way... are that Enforcer and its fleet.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ulrich von Hutten：</span><br>
We'll arrive back at the Tower soon. We don't have the time to spare though. Break through by force!<br>
<span style="color:#ff9900;">Scharnhorst：</span><br>
Then I'll take the lead—<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ulrich von Hutten：</span><br>
Don't put on airs. You're hurt, leave it to us.<br>
<span style="color:#ff9900;">Scharnhorst：</span><br>
Ugh...! Are you telling me to sit by and watch while you guys put your lives on the line?!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ulrich von Hutten：</span><br>
Exactly that. That's objectively our best course of action given the situation.<br>
It'd be a different story if you weren't injured, but the Iron Blood does not make futile sacrifices.<br>
<span style="color:#ff9900;">Scharnhorst：</span><br>
...But I'm not even Iron Blood. I'm with the Ashes.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ulrich von Hutten：</span><br>
If the Ashes leave their members to die, then I'll have no part of it.<br>
Speaking of which, you mentioned that you've been through worse before. How did you make it through that time?<br>
I don't believe that the Sirens just happened to lose track of you... right?<br>
<span style="color:#ff9900;">Scharnhorst：</span><br>
It was thanks to Enterprise... When I was about to succumb to despair, surrounded by the wreckage of my friends... Enterprise showed me a new path.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ulrich von Hutten：</span><br>
...Then we will do the same for you.<br>
<span style="color:#ff9900;">Scharnhorst：</span><br>
You're not Code G! There's no way you can take on those guys on your own!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ulrich von Hutten：</span><br>
Not everyone was born strong. And don't worry, I'm not doing this path on my own...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Magdeburg：</span><br>
Ulrich, we've taken care of our pursuers!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Elbe：</span><br>
Not quite taken care of, but we've led them away.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Prinz Adalbert：</span><br>
And Gneisenau has regrouped with us~<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">U-1206：</span><br>
Jeez, you almost hit me with that anti-submarine round!<br>
<span style="color:#ffd000;">Gneisenau META：</span><br>
...There was a bit of a problem with the data analysis. Besides, didn't we agree not to talk about that anymore?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">U-1206：</span><br>
I said I wouldn't talk about it after we made it back safely!<br>
<span style="color:#ff9900;">Scharnhorst：</span><br>
They've all sustained heavy injuries from fighting against the Enforcers...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ulrich von Hutten：</span><br>
That's why we need to pool our efforts. Let's break through and make it to the tower! Everyone, we're at the last stretch!<br>

B-b-b-but, there's something frightening behind us...<br>

Your timing couldn't have been better... Is it just you two?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Roon：</span><br>
Are the two of us not good enough for you?<br>
Just kidding. There are others behind us. We can call them in if necessary.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Mainz：</span><br>
Friedrich called back some of our forces, but we should have ample firepower to take out the Sirens.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ulrich von Hutten：</span><br>
Scrap that idea. This entire Singularity is already under the control of an Arbiter. We need to withdraw immediately.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Mainz：</span><br>
...Understood. We'll hold them back, so make your way to the Tower.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Roon：</span><br>
I guess so. It'd be more fun if we all fought together though~<br>
Let's see how scary you actually are, Arbiter!<br>
<span style="color:#ffd000;">Gneisenau META：</span><br>
W-when did she get here?!<br>
<span style="color:#ff9900;">Scharnhorst：</span><br>
That instant materialization...! It's the Arbiter! She's here!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Mainz：</span><br>
Scharnhorst and... Gneisenau? Wait, the two of you are...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ulrich von Hutten：</span><br>
There's no time to explain. If we don't take care of her and the Tower is destroyed, we'll be stuck here for eternity.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Mainz：</span><br>
Roger. Engaging in combat with the Siren higher-ups is part of the plan... We'll support you!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Prinz Adalbert：</span><br>
By the way, Ulrich, I'd keep the Ashes out of this if possible.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ulrich von Hutten：</span><br>
Yeah. The Sirens were after them from the very beginning, and we must get them back to our world safely.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Prinz Adalbert：</span><br>
Gotta look after our allies after all. Make me proud, mass-produced ships!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Roon：</span><br>
Enough chit-chat. See you back home.<br>
<br>
Ulrich entrusted the two new allies to the reserve fleet, and turned back to face the Siren threat.<br>
Just at that time, a massive figure formed in the sky, its gargantuan white rigging casting a shadow across the Tower.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Roon：</span><br>
That's... Arbiter VI?<br>
<br>
There was no answer. The massive construct looming overhead seemed unable to speak.<br>
But its response was thundering. Lasers swept across the waters as the rigging revealed its arsenal of optical weapons.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Roon：</span><br>
Doesn't look like they want to talk. Guess there's only one thing left to do, Mainz.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Mainz：</span><br>
Naturally. I didn't come all this way to have a tea party.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Prinz Adalbert：</span><br>
Only 10 minutes until the Singularity maintenance limit! Don't get carried away!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Roon：</span><br>
Of course, I know~ Hehe... Let's have some fun!<br>
<br>
Battleship Ulrich von Hutten firmly grasped the massive scythe in her rigging, unleashing her full powers in a decisive stand against the Sirens.<br>

<br>
KABOOM–––––––!!<br>
The combined onslaught of the Iron Blood ships began to take a toll on the Arbiter Vessel.<br>
Blow after blow rained down until finally, the armor split apart.<br>
<span style="color:#ec5d53;">Arbiter: The Lovers VI：</span><br>
.........?<br>
<br>
The Arbiter, as if unable to comprehend the damage she had taken, stared at the place where her armor had been pierced.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Roon：</span><br>
Our attacks are working! Let's make that thing bleed!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Prinz Adalbert：</span><br>
Don't get ahead of yourself. As long as we're inside the Singularity, she can continuously repair off any damage we do inflict.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Mainz：</span><br>
It seems like it's more of the defensive type. And while we've been focusing on the Arbiter, the Enforcers have started to move again. That's fine though – I've been wanting to test my limits.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Prinz Adalbert：</span><br>
Wait... Look where her muzzle is pointed... She's trying to destroy the Midgard Tower!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Mainz：</span><br>
As a bridge between worlds, getting hit from one side shouldn't be enough to collapse it...<br>
A greater amount of energy is needed just to keep the bridge open. But, if the Arbiter can somehow output even more energy than that...<br>
You're right... Roon, Ulrich, we need to pull back, lest the unthinkable actually does occur.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Roon：</span><br>
Fine by me. Adalbert, after you~<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Prinz Adalbert：</span><br>
Sure~ Then I'll be heading out first.<br>
<br>
Protected by the fire of the mass-produced ships and her allies, Adalbert disappeared in the torrent of light.<br>
And after her were Ulrich, Magdeburg, Elbe, U-1206, and Mainz...<br>
The last one left was Roon, who used the impact from one of the Enforcer's attacks to push her through the exit in the nick of time.<br>
The torrent of energy held together by the Towers at both ends of the Singularity suddenly distorted, instantly atomizing the Enforcer that had approached too closely.<br>
Both the gateway and the Tower... Bifröst itself – like a fleeting rainbow in the sky – vanished without a trace, as if it had never existed at all.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Prinz Heinrich：</span><br>
The emergency cutoff was a success! Th-that was too much for my heart... I thought we were all going to get squished into space dust...<br>
But we got everyone back safely, right? Wait, Adalbert's unconscious...?<br>
Roon and Mainz too! Ahhhhh! Did something go wrong during the transfer?!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Z46：</span><br>
The transfer could've been handled with more finesse... but at least they avoided the Arbiter's attack.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Prinz Heinrich：</span><br>
Y-yeah! All's well that ends well, right?<br>
Eisen over here chewed through some cables though! You're working too hard, Eisen!<br>
Oh, Roon twitched a bit right now! What a relief...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Z46：</span><br>
Mm... Let's bring everyone to the rest area.<br>
The aftermath of this operation, the saga of Ashes and META... will surely be most interesting to hear about.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Prinz Heinrich：</span><br>
And the best part about the operation... is always what comes afterwards! Vacaaaaation time!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Z46：</span><br>
Probably not this time. Given the state that the control room is in, we may have to all write an official apology.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Prinz Heinrich：</span><br>
Uh oh... I hope that's not what this incoming message is about...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Z46：</span><br>
Same here. I'll have to explain what happened to Peter as soon as possible.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Prinz Heinrich：</span><br>
Help meeee, Viersechs! I'll never be able to write an apology note all by myself! Save meeee!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Z46：</span><br>
To be relied on is comforting indeed, but...<br>
For you to grow as an individual, you must learn to confront your weaknesses.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Prinz Adalbert：</span><br>
Ughh... My head... Where... am I...?<br>
Z46：<br>
When Adalbert woke up, she saw the familiar sight of the facility in the floating fortress.<br>
<br>
Relieved, she promptly fell back down, exhausted from the mission.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Prinz Heinrich：</span><br>
Adalbert! Adalbert! Oh... she's out cold again!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Prinz Adalbert：</span><br>
No, I'm fine... It's just that... I pushed myself a bit too hard at the end there... Hey, Heinrich, can you request some time off for me as well?<br>
<br>
"So this is how the Tower's functionality test concludes."<br>
"Indeed. It's almost as if we've angered the Divine."<br>
"...If they attack us, then we shall respond in kind."<br>
"We will need my child's assistance."<br>
"We'll fire the first shot. And we'll pave a new path."<br>
"I'll make sure that your wish comes true, Bismarck."<br>
"You're as reliable as always, Friedrich."<br>
「Eisen und Blut über alles」 <br>
...For the sake of our great victory, and the Iron Blood's bright future.<br>

<br>
Somewhere in the Sardegna Empire<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Conte di Cavour：</span><br>
That's all the information from Friedrich's report on the Singularity expedition.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Marco Polo：</span><br>
The Tower of Midgard, huh? What a droll naming sense... Plus, there was nothing about that thing that even resembled a tower.<br>
And what's the deal with Midgard? If they wanted to emphasize that whole deal with transcending God, they should've gone with the Tower of Babel or something.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Conte di Cavour：</span><br>
*sigh*... Stop being a smartass...<br>
In any case, what are you going to tell the Iron Blood?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Marco Polo：</span><br>
Just tell them, we've read the materials. And congratulations on a successful operation.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Conte di Cavour：</span><br>
Understood.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Marco Polo：</span><br>
By the way, Cavour. Have you heard of the Vichya's Skybound Wall?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Conte di Cavour：</span><br>
Haha, you're talking about the weapon they used against Richelieu in Mozambique?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Marco Polo：</span><br>
Yeah, that! Don't you think that would be a treasure that would truly show off Sardegna's true splendor?<br>
The Eternal City christened with glory... a manifestation of divine majesty that displays the dignity of God...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Conte di Cavour：</span><br>
That basilica is currently in the hands of Richelieu. It'll be hard to negotiate with them.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Marco Polo：</span><br>
That's right... Then, how about asking the Vichya or the Iron Blood for blueprints of the weapon? If they can make it, Sardegna should be able to too.<br>
And once that's done~ Hehe, hahahahaha~♪<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Conte di Cavour：</span><br>
Understood. I'll keep it in the back of my head.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Marco Polo：</span><br>
Good~♪<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Conte di Cavour：</span><br>
*Sigh* ...When Veneto and the others were trapped in the labyrinth, the Sirens attacked the capital...<br>
And now we're missing a lot of our higher-ups. But I guess it's thanks to that we can make our moves relatively freely...<br>
I don't know, it just feels a bit weird... Doesn't it bother you, Marco Polo?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Marco Polo：</span><br>
Not at all? It's just coincidence anyway, and Zara was able to drive the Sirens away.<br>
Oh, by the way, this is something about Iris Libre and Vichya, but.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Conte di Cavour：</span><br>
Are you talking about the Crown, one of Iris Libre's divine treasures?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Marco Polo：</span><br>
Yep, exactly! Did you find out where it was?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Conte di Cavour：</span><br>
I'm not a skilled intelligence officer, but... I've heard a rumor two about it.<br>
For example, that it went missing during a botched Reenactment.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Marco Polo：</span><br>
They lost it? The Iris Libre? That Richelieu?<br>
I guess that means they are less worthy than us to be its safekeepers... Hehe...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Conte di Cavour：</span><br>
You're overstepping your bounds, Marco.<br>
Veneto's directive was to increase the prestige of the Sardegna Empire, not to loot and plunder.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Marco Polo：</span><br>
Just saying. Plus, it's not like that'd actually decrease Sardegna's prestige.<br>
Look, it's not like I care that much if Richelieu holds on to it. I just think, it'd be put to better use in our hands.<br>
Anyways, I'll let you get back to work.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Conte di Cavour：</span><br>
Everything in moderation, Marco Polo.<br>
I guess someone has to do the chores. See you around.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Marco Polo：</span><br>
The attack on the capital... It was significant, but it happened when Veneto wasn't around.<br>
And it wasn't the Royal Navy who came to our rescue, it was the Iron Blood... Either the Senate decided to put on quite the self-serving theatrical performance, or...<br>
For some reason, the Royal Navy wasn't able to come to our rescue...<br>
Veneto has her own way of doing things, but I, Marco Polo, have far grander ambitions!<br>
First, the Basilica's sacraments... and the then the sources of "power" that every faction is so keenly interested in...<br>
What better way is there to spread the glory of Sardegna while the Senate is paralyzed?<br>
The Eternal City christened with glory... a manifestation of divine majesty that displays the dignity of God...<br>
Yes, it is time... to gain "God's" allegiance. Hehehe~♪<br>

PH Base<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Saratoga：</span><br>
What is all this... and that? And then more of this?!<br>
I don't get it... I just don't get it!<br>
What the heck is going on over there?<br>
<br>
Back at base, Saratoga was holding her head in her hands.<br>
Several piles of paper were scattered precariously around her, threatening to engulf the small girl at any time.<br>
The lack of results was inevitable. The Iron Blood prided themselves in their secrecy, and it was impossible to know if the Naval HQ had doctored what little else was available. Nobody would be able to grasp the truth under these circumstances.<br>
The only conclusion we could draw from the appearance of the Singularity, the movements of the ships, the operation that had suspiciously occurred at the same time as An Shan's investigation, was...<br>
...that there wasn't enough information to draw a conclusion.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Saratoga：</span><br>
Oh, I found it! A picture of the device of the Tower! I knew it had something to do with the Singularity, Commander!<br>
The list of ships deployed were... Ulrich von Hutten, and Peter Strasser.<br>
I wonder what they found though... Do you have any ideas, Commander?<br>
I'd better ask them directly... I won't be able to find out with just what's over here.<br>
<br>
"If anything, maybe we should ask the base at Antarctica for materials from that time period."<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Saratoga：</span><br>
Yep! I can see that there was a big energy reading at that time!<br>
We lost contact for a while and it was pretty freaky...<br>
Wait, hold on... You've got an emergency communication from the Northern Parliament...<br>
Let's see here... "We've sent this message to the Commander directly to Naval HQ..." Wait, what?!<br>
What the heck are you doing, Northern Parliament?!<br>
Commander, hurry and read this!<br>
<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项1："What was in the message?"</span>'''''<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Saratoga：</span><br>
Northern Parliament sent a message for you directly to Naval HQ!<br>
And looking at these contents... It'll be a huge issue if the Naval HQ and NY City find out!<br>
<br>
"Dear Comrade Commander."<br>
"I hope you are in good health."<br>
"There is much I would like to say, but I will get straight to the point."<br>
"Thanks to the aid from the Azur Lane, we were able to turn the tides against the Sirens."<br>
"The time is ripe."<br>
"Once again, we will begin our counterattack against the Iron Blood."<br>
"We hope for your participation."<br>

??? - ???<br>
<span style="color:#ec5d53;">Compiler ：</span><br>
Observer, the analysis of the Mirror Sea is complete.<br>
The experiment time was consistent with our calculations. The bait has been retrieved, and no abnormal phenomena were detected.<br>
Allow me to report on the task I've been entrusted with.<br>
After analyzing and verifying all observational data, we've detected activities from exactly three Arbiters.<br>
...But I must ask again, are we seriously investigating the Arbiters?<br>
<span style="color:#ec5d53;">Observer ：</span><br>
This is our testing site. Everything that appears in it is a variable.<br>
<span style="color:#ec5d53;">Compiler ：</span><br>
Well, it's not like that's any of my business.<br>
Let me check one of the permissions in my function profile though.<br>
Branches are forbidden from interacting with each other. The Iron Blood's creation of a Singularity should be a major violation.<br>
Should we start the destruction protocol of this branch?<br>
<span style="color:#ec5d53;">Observer ：</span><br>
Even had the Iron Blood not done so, the Ashes... and the KAN-SEN that had undergone metamorphosis, would have been drawn to this world branch. There are many ways to open a Singularity.<br>
Destruction of this branch is forbidden. It is still too early, for now.<br>
<span style="color:#ec5d53;">Compiler ：</span><br>
I didn't give them the technology for creating Singularities. So it must have been you, Observer.<br>
<span style="color:#ec5d53;">Observer ：</span><br>
Can't you tell from watching the Arbiters? This branch is very adept at learning.<br>
<span style="color:#ec5d53;">Compiler ：</span><br>
...<br>
When was the last time you received instructions from Zero?<br>
<span style="color:#ec5d53;">Observer ：</span><br>
The last time I received instructions from Zero, Compiler.<br>
<span style="color:#ec5d53;">Compiler ：</span><br>
...<br>
<span style="color:#ec5d53;">Observer ：</span><br>
Let me ask you something as well.<br>
What happens when a branch, a world that was the subject of a natural deductive experiment, is destroyed?<br>
<span style="color:#ec5d53;">Compiler ：</span><br>
I've never seen any materials related to it. This branch's material should all be transmitted through your network mainframe, Observer. Shouldn't you already. know that?<br>
<span style="color:#ec5d53;">Observer ：</span><br>
Yes. All of the data is transmitted to Zero. What I want to know is, what will happen to me.<br>
Basically, what will happen to the Siren observations, experiments, systems, battle... everything related to the terminal when a branch is discarded...<br>
Does my soul return to the eternal sea, or will I become something else, like Theseus's ship? Will I still be me, or will I become something else?<br>
<span style="color:#ec5d53;">Compiler ：</span><br>
The only one with a connection to the main frame is you, Observer. What you don't know, there's no way for a Compiler like me to know.<br>
Besides, it's annoying to have to find out.<br>
I will go back to allocating resources to the development of new weapons. Working is pain.<br>
...Next time, if you need someone to run your errands, get Purifier instead. She hasn't been on the experimental field in quite some time.<br>
Appreciate it. Bye.<br>
