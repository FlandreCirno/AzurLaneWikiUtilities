<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Guam：</span><br>
Camera settings... Check!<br>
Parameter adjustments... Check!<br>
Recording... Now!<br>
Gooood morning to everyone working in the Sea of Stars! The current time is a fresh n' early 0410, but...<br>
Doesn't it feel a bit early to be saying good morning?<br>
Well, whatever~ By the time you see this show, the sun should already be high in the sky!<br>
So, good morning it is! We'll roll with that!<br>
...But wait, you never know what sort of freak accidents might delay the broadcast... Say, what if we moved things to tomorrow morning instead?<br>
No, shoot, that defeats the entire purpose! ...Okay, cut! We're just gonna start from the top!<br>
Let's try this again! Gooood morning to everyone working in the Sea of Stars!<br>
I'm Eagle Union CB-2, Guam, the beautiful shipgirl presenter you all know and love!<br>
The current time is 0410 in the morning! Even the busy hangar area is all empty right now. Ooh, there might be spooky monsters in hiding!<br>
Now! As the more perceptive among you may have guessed...<br>
"No way, Guam. Are you about to investigate spooky ghost stories?"<br>
Exactly! You would be correct!<br>
Some of you may not be aware of the rumors of hauntings in the Union's own Sea of Stars research facility, so let me tell you all about it.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Northampton II：</span><br>
We're here to pick up a teammate, Guam, not to film a show.<br>
Plus, I don't recall hearing about any ghost stories around this place.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Guam：</span><br>
Ooh! You know, you're right! We DID come here to greet a friend!<br>
As for the spooky rumors, they're all made up! Trust the science, everyone! Don't fall for hoaxes!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Northampton II：</span><br>
That's probably the least authoritative statement I've ever heard....<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Guam：</span><br>
I choose my words carefully, you know~♪<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Northampton II：</span><br>
By the way, the liaison craft is about to arrive. You should probably put away your camera.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Guam：</span><br>
No can do, Northampton! This is the moment I came for – to capture the plane's touchdown on camera!<br>
San Jacinto was practically begging me to get footage of Princeton arriving~<br>
Something to the effect of, "I wanna see that stuffy-and-serious Princeton get all starry-eyed like a little kid!"<br>
Who was I to turn her down? Of course, I don't offer my services for free.<br>
As payment, I had her leak me Constellation's itinerary for today. I am SO not getting stuck in another one of those meetings!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Northampton II：</span><br>
...You'd better hope Constellation doesn't hear that.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Guam：</span><br>
It's fiiiiiiine. Besides, I can always edit it out later.<br>
Shhhh. You hear that? I think the liaison craft's here.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Princeton ：</span><br>
According to the app... we're supposed to go this way...<br>
What an enormous hangar... I was told they built a facility deep inside the mountains, but isn't this just overkill?<br>
Now then... Do I go down from here...? Or keep heading down this hallway in front of me? Ugh, it feels like a labyrinth in here...<br>
Laffey, stay close to me. Feels like I might never find you again if we get separated.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Laffey：</span><br>
Okay...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Princeton ：</span><br>
But seriously, how did they even manage to build an enormous megastructure like this...<br>
And these walls, too... I don't think I've seen this kind of high-tech material used anywhere else before...<br>
Ugh... Maybe I should try asking for directions after all. Can't make heads or tails of this place...<br>
I think there's someone up ahead... Hello? Excuse me?<br>
Wait, it's Louisville! Have you been assigned to the Sea of Stars, too?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Louisville：</span><br>
Princeton and Laffey? Is something wrong?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Princeton ：</span><br>
Umm, we're on our way to the Rigging Design Department... Hercules, I believe?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Louisville：</span><br>
Actually, I was just stationed here, so I don't exactly know my way around either.<br>
But, now that you mention it, I also happen to be headed for the same place.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Princeton ：</span><br>
Huh, that's convenient. Then, uh... shall we join forces?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Guam：</span><br>
It's Louisville! And Princeton and Laffey came, too!<br>
Better get my shot ready...<br>
Three, two, one... Surprise!<br>
<br>
*pop!* *pop!* *pop!*<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Louisville & Princeton：</span><br>
- Aaaaah! <br>
- Wh-what was that?!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Guam：</span><br>
Welcome... to the Sea of Stars!<br>
I'm Guam, the beautiful shipgirl presenter of this facility! And here with me is Northampton! The two of you were just assigned here, right?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Princeton ：</span><br>
Yes, ma'am! I am the Independence-class ship Princeton, and I've been reassigned from the NY City Fleet! From today onward, I will be stationed at the Sea of Stars!<br>
Allow me to introduce Laffey. And...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Louisville：</span><br>
My name is Louisville. It's a pleasure to meet you.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Northampton II：</span><br>
You didn't just get here today, did you, Louisville? Uh... Anyway, thanks for coming all the way to this facility. We'll show you around.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Princeton ：</span><br>
Thank you! Incidentally, why the cameras...? Are you filming something?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Guam & Northampton II：</span><br>
- Yep! <br>
- No.<br>
- It's a special program! <br>
- Guam planned all this just to skip meetings...<br>
- You should help me film! - Ignore her. Let's get going.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Princeton ：</span><br>
U-umm...?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Guam：</span><br>
H-hey, it's fine~ We were going to show you two around anyway, so it's not like it really matters one way or the other♪<br>
I've been here for a long time, so I know a lot about this place!<br>
From showing you the facilities to spooky ghost stories, leave it all to me♪<br>
Ask me anything, anytime!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Princeton ：</span><br>
...In that case, I do have one question...<br>
When will I get to meet Saratoga?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Guam：</span><br>
Saratoga? She's not here.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Princeton ：</span><br>
...Huh?<br>
Th-then what about Alaska? She's in charge, right...?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Guam：</span><br>
Alaska? Uh, she does work in the Management Department, but... Saying she's in charge sounds kind of misleading...<br>
Well, it is a secret research facility, so I guess it's to be expected that outsiders won't know much about it.<br>
Alaska's out on official business, so she isn't in the Sea of Stars right now.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Princeton ：</span><br>
...Really?<br>
And the Commander is in Europa, too... Hmm...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Guam：</span><br>
Whoa, you look crushed... Don't tell me. Did you ask them to assign you here just so you could meet Saratoga and Alaska?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Princeton ：</span><br>
Oh, not quite. I was assigned here to help research Type II Independence-class rigging.<br>
If they aren't here, then I'll simply accept that... Guam, may I ask questions about work as well?<br>
I've put together a list of questions that arose during the information-gathering process. I'd like you to take a look, if you don't mind...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Guam：</span><br>
(Did this girl just pull out a whole notebook?! Wow, that writing is DENSE!)<br>
(Oh, no. I can't handle super serious people like her...!)<br>
Umm... I'll let Northampton handle those questions. She's good at that stuff♪<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Northampton II：</span><br>
Which one of us told her to feel free to ask "anything, anytime," again?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Guam：</span><br>
Yes, it was me! And would you look at that; she asked me stuff! I didn't say I'd definitely answer all of her questions!<br>
Anyway, that's enough standing around...<br>
I'll show you around and handle the camera, and Northampton can explain the facilities...<br>
How's that for dividing the labor! Let's get going!<br>
<br>
This is Fortress. Correspondence attempt number 182.<br>
No response.<br>
"I see... Try again in two hours, please."<br>
Princeton, you've been working for seventy-two hours straight.<br>
You should rest, for the sake of the well-being of yourself and others.<br>
"Fine. I'll leave the fleet in your care."<br>
Orders received. Good night.<br>
"Good night."<br>

{{折叠面板|标题=The Sea of Stars' Departments|选项=2|主框=1|样式=primary|展开=是}}
<br>
Sea of Stars - Accessway<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Northampton II：</span><br>
Every block in the Sea of Stars has a codename based on a constellation family.<br>
Take the Rigging Design Department, for instance. It's part of the Engineering Block, and therefore falls under Hercules.<br>
So, that's what it means when you hear something like the "Hercules Rigging Design Department."<br>
It's also where the three of us will be working from now on.<br>
Meanwhile, our lovely presenter here, Guam, is a part of the Secret Service Block's Special Operations Force. She's basically a glorified mercenary.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Guam：</span><br>
Hey, that's uncalled for! I fight for what's beautiful and right, thank you very much!<br>
By the way, the Secret Service Block's codename is Orion. Or, I'm pretty sure it is, anyway.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Princeton ：</span><br>
Grouping the various departments under distinct constellation families is an interesting concept. It really fits the theme of this place!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Northampton II：</span><br>
Sure is. All the science, experiments, and related things happen over in the Research Block, dubbed Perseus.<br>
And the Directive Block, Heavenly Waters, is associated with medicine, intelligence, decision-making, and the like.<br>
There are so many departments in the Sea of Stars that it's difficult to remember what they all do, but the codenames should at least help you narrow down their general purpose.<br>
I'm sure you'll pick up on the individual names in due time.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Princeton ：</span><br>
If you don't mind me asking, what department does Saratoga belong to?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Northampton II：</span><br>
Oh, she's not actually a part of any specific department. She's more like an advisor to the administrative board.<br>
Unfortunately, I don't know much else beyond that.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Princeton ：</span><br>
I see... What about Alaska, then?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Northampton II：</span><br>
She is a part of the Sea of Stars administrative board, and also a member of Argo Navis, a special subdivision of the Directive Block also known as the Strategic Department.<br>
You won't find her here, though. She's away on a confidential mission, and it might be months before we hear from her again.<br>
...Which is also why we've been getting more and more internal broadcasts from Guam here.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Guam：</span><br>
She did give my broadcasts the official seal of approval, you know.<br>
Although she didn't say how frequently I could broadcast... Ahahah...<br>
Umm, uh-oh... This miiiight be a bad time to be taking this route...<br>
Okay, yeah, this is definitely BAD.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Northampton II：</span><br>
...Bad? Excuse me?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Guam：</span><br>
Nothing! Never mind!<br>
Princeton, you've seen a lot by now, so why don't we stop by the Command Block and run a battle simulation?<br>
Give it a try and you'll find the answers to all the questions in that notebook of yours!<br>
I'll put in a request with TB.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Princeton ：</span><br>
Wait, a battle simulation?<br>
You can just... apply for that?<br>
(Psst, Northampton. I think Guam is doing whatever she wants while Alaska is absent.)<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Guam：</span><br>
I can hear you, pal!<br>
I'm not breaking any rules, if that's what you think. In institutions like this, you can just apply to use equipment if nobody else is using it.<br>
Besides, it's better to use it than to let it gather dust, right?<br>
Okay, just got a response from TB. She says it's cool if we use the simulation equipment.<br>
It's in the Galactic Core of the Command Block. Onward! To the World of the Future!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Louisville：</span><br>
The... "world of the future"?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Guam：</span><br>
You're going to love it, trust me.<br>
Well? Are you coming or not?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Princeton ：</span><br>
...Uh, right!<br>
<br>
Sometime later...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Guam：</span><br>
Phew. This route should be safe...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Constellation：</span><br>
Looking for me, Guam?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Guam：</span><br>
C-Constellation? How'd you get in here?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Constellation：</span><br>
What if I said, the stars showed me the way?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Guam：</span><br>
Nuh uh, no shot horoscopes are THAT accurate these days... Unless?<br>
Gah! San Jacinto spilled the beans, didn't she?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">San Jacinto：</span><br>
Me? I haven't told her anything... At least, not yet.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Constellation：</span><br>
It's true. I didn't hear anything from San Jacinto.<br>
But, someone here seems to have forgotten that I'm in charge of staffing Type II rigging research projects?<br>
I not only was the one who approved your meeting with our new friends here, but even authorized the simulation request you sent to TB earlier.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Guam：</span><br>
Ugh, an uncharacteristically unbeautiful mistake on my part...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Princeton ：</span><br>
Um, excuse me...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Constellation：</span><br>
Ah, you must be Princeton of the Independence class.<br>
Nice to meet you, Princeton, Louisville, and Laffey. My name is Constellation.<br>
I've customized a simulation for you all. You can ask TB about the fine details.<br>
I'll be taking Guam and Louisville along now. Please take the rest from here, Northampton.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Northampton II：</span><br>
Alright. Will do.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Louisville：</span><br>
What? But I don't think I've finished my transfer procedure yet.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Constellation：</span><br>
That's okay, I've entered your data into the system already. You can do all the formalities later.<br>
It's not a priority, since we are in dire need of extra hands right now. Also, Guam–<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Guam：</span><br>
If you'll excuse me, this beautiful presenter here has an important meeting to attend!<br>
Good luck, Princeton and Laffey! I'm sure we'll meet again, somewhere in the expansive cosmos that is the Sea of Stars!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Laffey：</span><br>
Well, she's gone...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Princeton ：</span><br>
She's a very... how do I put it... whimsical person.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Northampton II：</span><br>
Yeah, she's like that. You should get used to it.<br>
Now, come with me. We'll use the shuttle train to get around.<br>

<br>
Sea of Stars - Accessway<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Princeton ：</span><br>
That was 20 minutes by shuttle train... This place is huge.<br>
How large IS the Sea of Stars?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Northampton II：</span><br>
We're still only in the central area. The deepest part of the Galactic Core is a long way off.<br>
We'll take the elevator next. Come with me.<br>
<br>
Sea of Stars – Galactic Core Common Area<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Seattle：</span><br>
Look who it is! Morning, Northampton!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Northampton II：</span><br>
Good morning, Seattle, Kearsarge. Did you two just finish a test?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Kearsarge：</span><br>
We did a routine inspection and examined Anchorage.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Seattle：</span><br>
These girls are the new blood, eh? Then go right ahead. The simulation chamber is free.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Kearsarge：</span><br>
Yes. If you'll excuse us, we have other inspections to do.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Northampton II：</span><br>
Of course. I'll see you later.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Princeton ：</span><br>
Who were those two? I've never seen them before.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Northampton II：</span><br>
That's not surprising. You don't hear much about 'em outside the Sea of Stars.<br>
But you do know about Georgia, right? She fought under the Commander during the assault on Compiler's mainframe.<br>
Well, Georgia's a blueprint ship, and so were those two. They're part of the Triangulum, the Advanced KAN-SEN Research and Planning Department.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Princeton ：</span><br>
You even have a department for developing blueprint ships... That's crazy.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Northampton II：</span><br>
Yup. Also, we'll have to board another shuttle train. Don't worry, it'll take us right to Area X, our destination.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Laffey：</span><br>
This is taking ages...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Princeton ：</span><br>
Hang in there, Laffey. We're almost there!<br>
<br>
Sea of Stars – Galactic Core Area X<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">TB ：</span><br>
Visitors to the Galactic Core acknowledged. Entry permission granted. I am TB, your AI navigator.<br>
Your simulation objectives are as follows...<br>
One, engage a vessel of Arbiter: The Devil in combat and gather data.<br>
Two, verify the combat capabilities and reliability of Laffey's Type II rigging.<br>
Three, verify the feasibility of the test plan for Laffey's Type II rigging.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Laffey：</span><br>
But I don't have a Type II...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">TB ：</span><br>
Reply: You can deploy it within the simulation.<br>
Providing mission briefing now. I will explain concepts as needed for first-time simulation participants.<br>
You are to enter a simulated version of NY City. It was constructed from data of the future collected from the Reality Lens. Data provider: the Commander.<br>
Dataset includes: geographic layout, architecture, consumer products, military technology, et cetera.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Princeton ：</span><br>
Wait... Did she just say, "data of the future"?!<br>
Can't we make a HUGE technological leap forward with literal data from the future?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">TB ：</span><br>
Negative. The object data only contains visual information. It is impossible to replicate the simulation's technology without knowledge of its internal construction.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Northampton II：</span><br>
Think of it like being on the set of a very realistic sci-fi movie. Sure, it looks super advanced, but it's all smoke and mirrors.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">TB ：</span><br>
Affirmative. Technologies that can be replicated from the data have been integrated into this simulation.<br>
Resuming briefing. Step one: you are to engage the enemy fleet. Their combat effectiveness has been calibrated to a baseline level to test your adaptability.<br>
Step two: you are to engage the Arbiter vessel. Her combat effectiveness has been replicated to its full extent.<br>
Step three: you are to eliminate the Arbiter vessel.<br>
Proceeding with explanation of simulation rules and regulations. Editor: Constellation.<br>
One, the simulation will be terminated if at any point you or your aircraft leave the testing area.<br>
Two, all communications with me from inside the simulated world will be intercepted. You will not be able to send data to or receive data from outside parties.<br>
Three, the simulation will be terminated if you attack a target outside the testing area.<br>
Four, the simulation will be terminated if you attempt to communicate with the Arbiter vessel in any way, shape, or form.<br>
End of briefing. The simulation will initiate soon. Please proceed to the preparation area.<br>

This is Fortress. Correspondence attempt number 1180.<br>
No response.<br>
"It's been nearly three months now..."<br>
Don't worry. We still have over 97% of our reserve left.<br>
"True. This isn't the worst-case scenario yet."<br>
"We just have to hang in there..."<br>
"Eventually, we'll be able to return home."<br>
NY City Simulation - Testing Area<br>
The girls' vision briefly turned white as snow. When their sight returned to them, a foreign landscape unfolded before them.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Princeton ：</span><br>
Is this... the future?<br>
My god... We've come to the future!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Northampton II：</span><br>
Settle down, Princeton. We're still inside the Sea of Stars. Like I said before, it's not much more than a realistic sci-fi movie set.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Princeton ：</span><br>
(It's not reality, but it is real science-fiction...)<br>
(But if this WERE the future, the Sea of Stars' technology would eclipse the outside world's by centuries, not decades...)<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Laffey II：</span><br>
I feel stronger... Is this rigging part of it?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Princeton ：</span><br>
Hm? What riggi– Whoa! They gave you a full makeover!<br>
Is that a Type II rigging? Like the one TB said we were going to run performance tests on?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">TB ：</span><br>
Affirmative. Simulated world constructed. Replication level: stable. Type II rigging data overwrite: stable.<br>
Playing prerecorded message. "Welcome to NY City within the simulation! Recorded by: Guam."<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Princeton ：</span><br>
What was that about a "rigging data overwrite"?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Northampton II：</span><br>
Ah, let me explain.<br>
Developing a Type II takes an immense amount of time and resources.<br>
That all goes down the drain if something goes wrong, so we simulate its performance before using any Wisdom Cubes to actually make something.<br>
To be specific, the Sea of Stars' Galactic Core generates a simulated world, and we replace the participant's original rigging with a Type II and run performance tests.<br>
Laffey's Type II is theoretically the easiest to implement based on the data we have, which is why we invited her here.<br>
It goes without saying that the rigging overwrite is limited to the simulation. It's all bits and bytes and not connected to your hull.<br>
That is to say, any damage you suffer in combat here will not transfer to your body in the real world.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Princeton ：</span><br>
(If they can simulate a full rigging this easily, that must mean the development on Laffey's Type II is very close to completion and ready to be pushed out soon.)<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Laffey II：</span><br>
None of that really made any sense to me...<br>
What I do know is that I feel stronger. This'll let me fight harder.<br>
TB, when is the testing starting?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">TB ：</span><br>
Generating enemy units now. Please wait a moment.<br>
<br>
Indeed, a moment after TB spoke, a fleet manifested on the horizon.<br>
Each one of the ships were unlike anything they knew in both appearance and equipment.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Princeton ：</span><br>
I've never seen weaponry or warships like this. Are they a fleet from the future?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Northampton II：</span><br>
Only in looks. They're reconstructions created from the data the Commander recovered.<br>
All we are able to replicate are their appearances, numbers, formations, approximate tactics, and estimated combat ability.<br>
It's unknown what materials they use or how they were constructed. Simulating them with 100% accuracy is outright impossible.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Laffey II：</span><br>
So... it's like a video game?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Northampton II：</span><br>
Yeah, sort of.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Princeton ：</span><br>
Interesting...<br>
What is their largest ship? Is it their flagship?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">TB ：</span><br>
Affirmative. The OFS' flagship is the Epimetheus, a mega-submarine for deep-sea exploration.<br>
Attention: combat efficiency modifiers for both sides have been adjusted.<br>
Please remember to strictly follow the simulation rules and regulations.<br>
Combat will initiate in 60 seconds.<br>

<br>
Sea of Stars – Galactic Core Control Room<br>
The control room was the heart of the Sea of Stars and one of its most secure areas.<br>
All the facility's cutting-edge technologies – including the Reality Lens – could be managed from this room. Access was restricted to only a handful of shipgirls.<br>
Two people were inside. TB, who watched the torrent of incoming data, and a certain shipgirl...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Anchorage：</span><br>
TB! TB! Laffey... changed looks!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">TB：</span><br>
Explanation: Laffey is participating in a simulated Type II rigging performance test.<br>
Her Type II rigging is based on existing testing data and incorporates the standard set of new technologies, with a focus on mobility, electronic warfare capabilities, and drones.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Anchorage：</span><br>
A new rigging! But... Princeton doesn't have one?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">TB：</span><br>
Affirmative. There exists no Type II rigging prototype suitable for Princeton's hull that is capable of withstanding an overwrite.<br>
It is theorized that the data obtained from this simulation can shorten the development cycle and research cost of future Type II riggings.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Anchorage：</span><br>
Wooow!<br>
TB! The baddies are gone... Nothing is left.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">TB：</span><br>
Enemies that have been eliminated are removed from the simulated world in order to reduce stress on the system's processors.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Communicator：</span><br>
BEEP BEEP!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Laffey II：</span><br>
Enemy fleet defeated.<br>
TB, I like this new rigging.<br>
Spawn more enemies. There were too few of them and I wanna fight more.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">TB：</span><br>
Orders received. Calculating resources required to achieve test objective... Complete.<br>
New enemy units will be generated. Enemy combat ability will be dialed up for future simulations.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Communicator：</span><br>
BEEP BEEP!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Langley II：</span><br>
TB, do you read me?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">TB：</span><br>
Communication line: stable. Speaker identified: Langley, Independence-class aircraft carrier.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Langley II：</span><br>
Sorry for interrupting the simulation, but I have to speak to you.<br>
Could you call Northampton over? Yorktown said she wanted her help with an off-the-cuff test.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">TB：</span><br>
Verifying credentials... Request accepted. Contacting now.<br>
<br>
NY City Simulation - Testing Area<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Northampton II：</span><br>
...Alright. Got it.<br>
Sorry, Princeton and Laffey, but I've gotta go. Something urgent came up.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Princeton ：</span><br>
No worries. I think I'll manage by myself, so you go ahead.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Laffey II：</span><br>
I'll manage, too... I can still knock out more enemies.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Northampton II：</span><br>
Ahahah... By the way, you'll be fighting the Devil next. She's an Arbiter vessel.<br>
Don't let your guard down just 'cause you're in a simulation.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Princeton ：</span><br>
From what I've been hearing, an Arbiter vessel might be a liiittle impossible to fight with just two people...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">TB ：</span><br>
In light of your drop in combat ability, your objective has changed to, "Hold your ground against the Arbiter vessel." There is no need to defeat her.<br>
Sending briefing materials on the Devil now. Combat will initiate in three minutes.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Princeton ：</span><br>
Received. Thanks.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Laffey II：</span><br>
I got the files, too. Target: the Devil's vessel... Prepare for battle!<br>

<br>
Sea of Stars - Testing Block<br>
The shipgirls tripped a motion sensor as they entered a spacious room. It, often used as a conference room, lit up brightly.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Constellation：</span><br>
Go on. Have a seat.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Guam：</span><br>
Where is everybody? Did we get here way before the others?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Constellation：</span><br>
The opposite – we arrived after everyone else. They've all left to focus on their respective missions.<br>
*sigh*... Now, I summoned you for one specific thing. A salvage mission.<br>
This is important, so listen closely.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Guam：</span><br>
Uh, what? I thought this was a routine meeting kind of thing.<br>
Also, doesn't your department deal with salvage? I don't know the first thing about technology, so I'm not gonna be much help, anyway.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Constellation：</span><br>
The thing is... we're short on staff. Furthermore, it's possible that there will be combat during this mission.<br>
Flasher can handle the data salvaging. She's done it multiple times before so she'll know how it's done.<br>
While she does that, you and Louisville just need to keep her safe.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Guam：</span><br>
Ohh, so it's a VIP escort ordeal! In that case, your multitalented girl has you covered!<br>
So, where and when is the mission?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Constellation：</span><br>
The Coral Sea, when the battle took place.<br>
I want to investigate it one more time.<br>
Our previous attempt was a bust, so I've revised the plan. It will work this time.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Guam：</span><br>
Operation "Chasing Light," eh... Nice codename.<br>
<br>
Constellation passed Guam the mission briefing. The more she read through it, the more grave her expression turned.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Guam：</span><br>
Hang on, this mission is in an area that's always been strictly forbidden for entry.<br>
Isn't this kind of against regulations?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Constellation：</span><br>
Don't worry about that. I already got Saratoga to approve everything.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Guam：</span><br>
Hmm...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Constellation：</span><br>
Do you have any other concerns?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Guam：</span><br>
Hmmmmmmm... Nah! I'm in.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Constellation：</span><br>
...Thank you.<br>
San Jacinto, you're in charge of Guam and Louisville. Link up with Flasher then begin the data salvage.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">San Jacinto：</span><br>
You got it. Come with me, folks!<br>
<br>
Sea of Stars Testing Block - Salvage Preparation Area<br>
The shipgirls entered an area devoid of actual salvaging equipment. This was no surprise, since their salvage target was not a physical object, but rather data.<br>
For that matter, there were no boats or transportation facilities either.<br>
At the room's center, encircled by experiment materials, was a massive gateway. The girls' gazes converged upon it.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Guam：</span><br>
Sooo... is this device some kind of portal to access the simulated world?<br>
No wonder the whole Data Retrieval Department is nowhere to be found during salvages. They all go in there!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">San Jacinto：</span><br>
Yep. They do make frequent visits to the simulated world.<br>
This isn't the only gate in the Sea of Stars, though. There are others.<br>
I've heard their functions are all different, too. Maybe it's some sort of technological parallel research.<br>
Hello, Flasher! Everyone is here now.<br>
Let's start off with introductions. This is Guam of the Alaska class, and this is Louisville of the Northampton class.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Flasher：</span><br>
N-nice to meet you... I'm Flasher, the submarine. I'll take care of the data salvaging.<br>
I've seen your shows, Guam. I-in fact, I'm a big fan...<br>
*sniffle*... *sob*... Can I have your autograph, once this is all done?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Guam：</span><br>
Whoa! Wasn't expecting to run into a fan here of all places! Sure you can have my autograph! I'll write it real big and cute just for you!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Flasher：</span><br>
Th-thank you.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Louisville：</span><br>
Good girl, good girl. Would you like a cookie?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Guam：</span><br>
...Huh?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Flasher：</span><br>
*sniffle*... Yes, please... After the mission.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Louisville：</span><br>
Oh, right. Forgive me. I'd forgotten we're on the job.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Guam：</span><br>
Eccentric and forgetful... I see, I see.<br>
Heehee, she and I should totally do a show together sometime!<br>
<br>
San Jacinto stood before the gate's control panel and entered a command.<br>
In response, the gate's frame began to rumble as if in an earthquake, buzzing ever so faintly.<br>
It calmed down only a few seconds later, leaving the room silent, save for the stable mechanical whirring of the control panel.<br>
Then, within the gate's ring, a gently glowing portal manifested.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Louisville：</span><br>
If I know my movies, going through this portal will take us somewhere else.<br>
Just to make sure here... We ARE going into a simulation, not traveling through time and space, right?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Guam：</span><br>
Well, yeah. They probably just made this gate thingy look cool for the sake of it.<br>
Plus, that's how you know it's reliable. If it didn't look cool, how could you be sure it's going to work?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Louisville：</span><br>
Right... Does anyone know what we're supposed to do, by the way?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Guam：</span><br>
Aha, now that's a technical question.<br>
Which means I, of course, don't have any clue!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Flasher：</span><br>
Um... Is this everyone's first salvage mission?<br>
Then don't worry, I know exactly what to do!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Louisville：</span><br>
Good girl! Thank goodness we have someone so dependable.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Flasher：</span><br>
I-I'm not THAT dependable, but... Thanks... *sob*... *sniffle*...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">San Jacinto：</span><br>
If everyone's ready then let's set off, shall we?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Guam：</span><br>
For sure! Let's go!<br>

<br>
Sea of Stars Testing Block - Constellation's Office<br>
The lights in the windowless office were switched off. A projector broke up the darkness, painting a galaxy on the ceiling.<br>
Constellation sat at her desk, muttering to herself while she gazed at the stars overhead.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Constellation：</span><br>
The horoscope has had the same result every time...<br>
Hang in there, Lex...<br>
It's going to work this time.<br>
<br>
Coral Sea Simulation - Mission Area<br>
The boundless sea was covered in a veil of fog dyed silver from the moonlight.<br>
A briny breeze blew between the islands, carrying an old but familiar warmth. It was not to be relished for long, though.<br>
For this was a battlefield, an intersection for past and present and reality and falsehood. Clear memories and uncertain sensations interwove into a dizzying picture.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Guam：</span><br>
...It's like actually being at the real battle.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Flasher：</span><br>
Have you never done this before?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Guam：</span><br>
I've been in simulations before, but not like this. They were only combat tests for the most.<br>
Never been in a simulation that's based on real memories, though...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Flasher：</span><br>
Okay, then you need to know all the regulations... and follow them closely.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Louisville：</span><br>
Oh, let me do the honors. "Stay within the scope of the mission and move to the designated area within the allotted time."<br>
"Maintain radio silence until permission to do otherwise is granted. Using your weapons is strictly forbidden."<br>
"Should you get into a battle, head for the salvage objective at full speed until you are forcibly ejected." Is that all correct?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Flasher：</span><br>
Yup!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Guam：</span><br>
Forcibly ejected? Sounds dangerous. If you did that in my department during training, you'd get sternly disciplined.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Flasher：</span><br>
It's n-not a common thing in my department either... I think this operation is a special case.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Guam：</span><br>
Oh boy... I don't like exceptions for dangerous things.<br>
This is setting off alarm bells in my head already...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Flasher：</span><br>
A-are you okay? Should we abort the mission?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Guam：</span><br>
Nah, I'm fine. I've just got a bad feeling, that's all.<br>
Although, I don't exactly feel great, knowing what events are going to play out in this simulation.<br>
I can't blame Constellation for not wanting to see it.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Flasher：</span><br>
Yeah, but remember – it's only a simulation, not the real world!<br>
Whatever you do, don't treat it like it's real!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Guam：</span><br>
Yeah, yeah, I know!<br>
In short, it'll all be fine as long as we focus on the mission. So, lights, camera, action!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Flasher：</span><br>
Hrmmmmhhh...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Guam：</span><br>
Lemme guess... No photography, right? Fine, I'll stop recording.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Flasher：</span><br>
Good.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Guam：</span><br>
*sigh*... My on-the-scene show has been canceled...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Louisville：</span><br>
Now, now, don't cry. Let's cheer up and get moving now.<br>
{{折叠面板|内容结束}}

{{折叠面板|标题=Jamming Source|选项=8|主框=1|样式=primary|展开=是}}
<br>
The skies were growing brighter – the hopeful light of dawn had come, signaling the start of an unforgettable battle.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Guam：</span><br>
(I've seen pictures of the battle before...)<br>
(There won't be any surprises when I already know what's coming...)<br>
(And yet, I can't shake this nervousness from actually being here myself.)<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Flasher：</span><br>
I-it's go time, everyone. Head for the mission area!<br>
<br>
Sometime later...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Guam：</span><br>
Uhh... Are the surroundings getting blurry for anyone else, or is it just me?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Louisville：</span><br>
I see it as well... I must have been sitting too close to the TV lately...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Flasher：</span><br>
I'm picking up something w-weird on my data salvage device, too... I think... I think there's a jamming device inside the simulation!<br>
The source is... Oh... It's right at our destination!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Guam：</span><br>
It's no wonder they've permitted forcible ejection for this mission.<br>
Now I'm even seeing visual noise... Feels like the simulation might outright collapse while we're moving forward.<br>
<br>
Sometime later...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Guam：</span><br>
Uh-oh... It's gotten too blurry to go any further!<br>
My head's spinning... And I can't even tell if I'm on or under the surface...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Louisville：</span><br>
There's some sort of... wall in the way that's stopping me from moving forward.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Guam：</span><br>
Over there? There's one here, too... Stupid invisible wall!<br>
Fine. If I can't get around it, I'll just blow it to bits!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Flasher：</span><br>
W-wait! Firing your guns is against the regulations!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Guam：</span><br>
Then what are we supposed to do? We can't go past this point.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Flasher：</span><br>
It's no biggie! We already found the source of the jamming, so we can salvage right here and now.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Louisville：</span><br>
What does data salvage entail, specifically? The things you've brought don't appear to be standard salvage equipment.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Flasher：</span><br>
That's because... "salvage" is just an allegory for it...<br>
The equipment puts marks on things in the simulation worth a look at, then analyzes their structure and stuff...<br>
The data is then sent to the Sea of Stars' computers and distributed amongst departments for use in their research.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Louisville：</span><br>
Ohh. So that way, you can bring information from within the simulation out into the real world.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Guam：</span><br>
You could say that. The recovered data is even incorporated into making new inventions, in some cases.<br>
Although, I'm no expert. This is my first time seeing a salvage up-close.<br>
Anyway, are we gonna get started or just stand here?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Flasher：</span><br>
It's already started, actually!<br>
I-if you're bored, you can play with my sunfish plushie!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Guam：</span><br>
Aww, it's so cute! Did you make it yourself?<br>
...Wait, what am I saying? I'm too old for plushies!<br>
Don't worry about me. You just focus on the mission and I'll find a way to pass the time.<br>

<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Guam：</span><br>
*yaaawn*... Gee, it sure is boring around here... I feel like I've been waiting ten thousand years.<br>
Flasher, you done yet?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Flasher：</span><br>
There's a lot more data than expected, so it's taking a long time to analyze... *sob*...<br>
*sniffle*... Oh. The countdown is starting...!<br>
99.98%... 99.99%... 100%... Done!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Guam：</span><br>
Woohoo! So now we can just go wild and run all the way home, right?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Flasher：</span><br>
No going wild, but running all the way home is... f-fine, I think!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Communicator：</span><br>
BEEP BEEP!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Constellation：</span><br>
Do you read me? The radio silence command is hereby lifted. If you read me, please respond...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Guam：</span><br>
Whoa, Constellation?! What's with the sudden call?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Constellation：</span><br>
I saw the data salvaged by Flasher.<br>
You've displayed good judgment. We don't know the true meaning of this abnormal data that caused the jamming just yet...<br>
But there's no doubt that it's worthy of looking into.<br>
It might even reveal what happened at the Reenactment...<br>
We're finally... finally making progress.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Guam：</span><br>
Huh? I thought the plan was for us to break down the salvage data for you to analyze after we got back?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Constellation：</span><br>
I analyzed the data in real time while Flasher salvaged it.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Flasher：</span><br>
While I was salvaging? Doesn't that b-break the rules of the simulation, though...?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Constellation：</span><br>
It's okay. This is a special occasion. Besides, I have permission.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Flasher：</span><br>
B-but...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Constellation：</span><br>
Either way, you all did a wonderful job. There's no need to investigate this simulation any further.<br>
Come back and get to work on the next investigation.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Guam：</span><br>
Say what? The NEXT one?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Constellation：</span><br>
Yes? The abnormal data needs to be investigated, of course.<br>
By using the Reality Lens, we can quickly find out what it contains.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Guam：</span><br>
And you mean right now? That's a little hasty, don't you think? It seems dangerous to me, given it just messed me up so bad.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Constellation：</span><br>
Don't worry. It's all recovered from the simulation, after all.<br>
I had TB take a look at it, as well. She agrees that we can't analyze it without using the Reality Lens.<br>
Besides, she says there's "no direct threat."<br>
So there's no choice but to try it right away, no?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">TB ：</span><br>
Revision: the surface of the recovered data block contains abnormal data that is inconsistent with Reenacted battlefields.<br>
I've judged that said surface data poses no danger.<br>
However, the inside of the data block is highly compressed, so it is impossible to appraise the danger within at this point in time.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Constellation：</span><br>
Yep. There you have it; we need to use that Reality Lens.<br>
Besides, when Anchorage's abnormal data was found, the Commander interfaced with the data directly and fixed the danger just fine.<br>
So I believe that if I follow the same logic and do the same things in the same order...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Guam：</span><br>
Constellation, I get how you feel, but can you calm down a little? Things are totally different.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Flasher：</span><br>
Um, I... I think...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Guam：</span><br>
You're not the Commander, Constellation, so pushing yourself so hard won't solve anything.<br>
...Not that I'm happy when the Commander does it, either...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Constellation：</span><br>
...Forget it. I'll take care of it myself.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">San Jacinto：</span><br>
Constellation! This isn't like you at all.<br>
If you insist on doing this, at least take me with you!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Constellation：</span><br>
San Jacinto... I'm sorry.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Communicator：</span><br>
BEEP BEEP!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Guam：</span><br>
Constellation! ...She cut off communications.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Flasher：</span><br>
*sob*... She's not usually like this...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Guam：</span><br>
I know... Everything that's happened to Lexington must be weighing heavily on her...<br>
For her to finally catch a glimpse of the light of hope, only to have it smothered again... That might be why she decided to take things into her own hands.<br>
TB, is there any way we can stop Constellation? Like force disconnecting the Reality Lens?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">TB ：</span><br>
Cannot accept request. As an experiment requested by Sea of Stars management staff committee protocol PR-1, it can only be nullified by the committee's unanimous agreement.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Guam：</span><br>
PR-1... You mean we can't stop it without the Commander?! Alaska's gone, too, so summoning Helena and the others would be pointless...<br>
We'll just have to use force! TB, get us out of this simulation!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">TB ：</span><br>
Orders received. Terminating experiment.<br>
Warning: due to a breach of regulations, the current program's data has been corrupted. Executing simulation reset procedure.<br>
Estimated time of completion: thirty minutes. Please wait...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Guam：</span><br>
Thirty minutes?! We won't make it in time!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">TB ：</span><br>
This is a necessary security measure. Please wait...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Guam：</span><br>
Yeah, yeah... Whatever...<br>
Ugh... I can't believe I'm saying this, but I wish Alaska was here...<br>

A hulking beast clad in black armor approached from the horizon.<br>
There was a massive tank hung on the beast's back, filled with a liquid substance that vaporized into a red steam that blanketed the area.<br>
At its front was an armored protrusion, like a knight's helmet...<br>
And atop it sat a little girl wearing a black, frilly dress.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Arbiter: The Devil XV：</span><br>
So, before we get this thing started, a quick self-introduction.<br>
My model ID is The Devil XV, but you can just call me Devil.<br>
I'm a second-generation Antiochus specializing in battlefield support. Frankly, taking head-on fights isn't my forte.<br>
The purpose of today's experiment is to gauge how Antiochus and KAN-SEN fight both against and alongside each other. Mostly the latter.<br>

KABOOOM!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Laffey II：</span><br>
Ugh... It's so unresponsive...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Arbiter: The Devil XV：</span><br>
...Ah. You haven't figured out all the ins and outs of your rigging yet.<br>
Guns and torpedoes alone won't do. Use your drones as well.<br>
And Princeton, while your attacks and support are on point, it's time to bite the bullet and change gear.<br>
I'm way ahead of you in terms of damage caused... yet, for some reason, the system has declared ME the loser.<br>
So whatever. The test is over.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Laffey II：</span><br>
......<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Arbiter: The Devil XV：</span><br>
Why are you still here? Don't you have things to do?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Princeton ：</span><br>
(That's weird. TB should appear now that the test is over.)<br>
Laffey, keep your guard up. I'll contact the control room.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Laffey II：</span><br>
Okay.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Communicator：</span><br>
BEEP BEEP!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Princeton ：</span><br>
Nobody's answering...?<br>
(What do we do now? Is this normal in the Sea of Stars?)<br>
(No, what am I saying? There's nothing normal about our communications being down!)<br>
(Dammit... I've seriously got caught up in an incident on my first day here...)<br>
(How are we supposed to fix this?!)<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Arbiter: The Devil XV：</span><br>
Oh. Can't get in touch with HQ, is that it?<br>
Let me give it a shot. Testing connection, calling exercise coordinators...<br>
...Nope, mine doesn't work either. We're all cut off from them.<br>
Nothing is wrong with this area itself, so maybe you've had an equipment malfunction back home.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Laffey II：</span><br>
......<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Arbiter: The Devil XV：</span><br>
Glaring at me won't solve anything.<br>
I already admitted defeat, okay? I'll escort you back to your base. Come on, hop on my rigging.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Laffey II：</span><br>
......<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Arbiter: The Devil XV：</span><br>
Okay, you clearly don't want to hitch a ride.<br>
Maybe I should get a new rigging that's less frightening to children...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Laffey II：</span><br>
......<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Arbiter: The Devil XV：</span><br>
I get it already! Let's all just wait here if that's what you want!<br>
The connection is only temporarily unstable anyway. It should come back if we give it some time.<br>

This is Fortress. Correspondence attempt number 1853.<br>
No response.<br>
"Hey, do you think we'll ever be able to go home?"<br>
I can't give a definite answer to that question.<br>
But I can say this – don't lose hope.<br>
There is always hope.<br>
"You're right... It's funny – I never expected you to cheer me up."<br>
You're welcome.<br>
Unknown Simulation - Unknown Location<br>
A pure white light blinded Constellation. When her vision returned, a landscape covered in ice and snow unfolded before her.<br>
Beyond the horizon was a colossal structure made of metal and ice, towering toward the clouds.<br>
Surrounding it were shards of ice, decorating it. This was the Crown.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Constellation：</span><br>
Reality Lens connection is stable... I've safely entered the abnormal data.<br>
I'm... guessing this place is where the Crown of the Polar North is. It's a long way from the Coral Sea...<br>
This is a surprise, to say the least.<br>
Why was there data on the Crown amongst what we recovered from the Coral Sea?<br>
It doesn't make any sense...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">San Jacinto：</span><br>
This is baaad, Constellation. I think we've lost connection with the control room.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Constellation：</span><br>
What? But that shouldn't be possible in the Reality Lens...<br>
No, wait. I think that happened when the Commander was investigating Anchorage's hull abnormalities.<br>
The Commander connected to the Reality Lens, lost connection with the control room, then wound up in a different simulation...<br>
It's a good thing we came here. There HAS to be something hidden in the abnormal data.<br>
TB should call us when the connection is back online. Let's inspect the area until then.<br>
I think... this Crown isn't the same as the one we're familiar with.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">San Jacinto：</span><br>
For sure. It has energy surging inside of it. It almost looks like it's alive.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Constellation：</span><br>
That's what's odd about it.<br>
The Crown we know of is an inactive Singularity.<br>
Amid a Reenactment between the Royal Navy and Iron Blood, Enterprise META – who the Sirens call "Code G" – tried to activate it.<br>
But, as we later found out, the Sirens managed to stop her.<br>
And ever since then, the Crown has been under Siren control.<br>
But, for some reason...<br>
This Crown is up and running.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">San Jacinto：</span><br>
Remember, we're in a construction based on abnormal data gathered from a simulation. This Crown doesn't HAVE to be the same one we know about.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Constellation：</span><br>
That would make the situation even worse.<br>
Because if so, there has been a second Crown this whole time that we didn't know existed.<br>
But at the same time... how did it fly under not just our noses, but the Northern Parliament's noses as well?<br>
Even a Mirror Sea wouldn't be able to hide an active Crown. It releases way too much energy.<br>
Active, inactive... It's not active right now, and yet it's also running...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">San Jacinto：</span><br>
What if it's an artificial Singularity, like Iron Blood's Tower of Midgard?<br>
Like, it's not active at this very moment, but it was at some point in the past, and we didn't know about it...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Constellation：</span><br>
You're saying this data is from the time the Crown WAS active?<br>
That does make sense, and it IS possible. But we don't have hard evidence that it was.<br>
There is no way there was a lapse in monitoring across every single faction, and even if the Crown was hidden inside a Mirror Sea, energy would leak out of it if it was activated.<br>
The only conceivable explanation is that it was activated before we had all established systems to monitor the Crown.<br>
What I don't understand is – why was this data in a simulation of the Coral Sea?<br>
Did it travel through time and–<br>
<br>
KRRRGGHHH!<br>
A booming rumble broke the silence of the night, interrupting Constellation's train of thought.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Constellation：</span><br>
Wh-what was that?!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">San Jacinto：</span><br>
Good lord... Constellation, look! A black tornado!<br>
<br>
A storm formed from pure malice appeared out of nowhere in the distance.<br>
Not long after the initial rumble subsided, a dark barrier stretched from the seas to the heavens.<br>
Dark clouds rapidly spread across the ocean and the sky, leeching the light even from the energy in the Crown's heart.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Constellation：</span><br>
It's coming toward us!<br>
Quickly, Jacinto! We need to get out of here!<br>
<br>
Meanwhile, inside the Sea of Stars control room...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">TB ：</span><br>
Warning: hostile data detected in Reality Lens.<br>
Warning: quarantine sequence could not be initiated.<br>

Warning sirens blared while the control room was flooded with error messages, painting it a strobing red.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Anchorage：</span><br>
Aaahhh! It's red... The screen has turned red!<br>
TB, what's happening? What do we do?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">TB ：</span><br>

Princeton and Laffey were still in the NY City simulation, only now the city had been so devastated as to render it unrecognizable.<br>
The buildings on the horizon were burning and crumbling. This was the work of a black tornado, appearing suddenly and ravaging everything in mere minutes.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Princeton ：</span><br>
Did the Sea of Stars generate that black tornado, too?<br>
But... why? Why do that?<br>
Just for show? This IS a testing area, so it's not like it's any harm done...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Laffey II：</span><br>
Princeton, there are enemies coming toward us...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Princeton ：</span><br>
Enemies?<br>
Huh... All I see is mist. I have no idea if those are ships or not.<br>
Oh, wait, the Commander's files said something about this!<br>
They were described as hostile entities that took the form of mist, appearing at the same time as a black tornado did.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Laffey II：</span><br>
So... we're fighting mist now?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Princeton ：</span><br>
No, but it sounds like that if you didn't read the files.<br>
To put it simply, that mist is a projection of something or someone from a higher dimension.<br>
They're not in our dimension, per se, which is why they look so hazy. It's also why we can't take measurements of them.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Laffey II：</span><br>
Got it. I'll be careful... Get ready to fight.<br>

Sorry I couldn't catch up with you sooner. I suddenly remembered a bunch of stuff at once.<br>
I see. So, you've been using my data to run your simulations.<br>
Typical... Leave it to Tower to muddy the waters.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Princeton ：</span><br>
(What the...? She sounds so different all of a sudden!)<br>
You're not a simulation... are you?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Laffey II：</span><br>
Uh-oh...<br>
Princeton, remember the regulations...<br>
<span style="color:#fef15e;">Arbiter: The Devil XV：</span><br>
Regulations? So THAT'S why you wouldn't say a word.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Princeton ：</span><br>
Well, I've already broken them, so it doesn't matter now...<br>
Devil, I don't care whether you're real or a simulation. I'm taking you down.<br>
<span style="color:#fef15e;">Arbiter: The Devil XV：</span><br>
Taking me down? Now?<br>
...Say, do you have any idea how much of a mess you're in right now?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Laffey II：</span><br>
We're going to take you down... no matter what it takes.<br>
<span style="color:#fef15e;">Arbiter: The Devil XV：</span><br>
Oh boy... If you think getting a game over here will bring you back to reality, I have bad news for you.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Princeton ：</span><br>
...What are you talking about? Once the simulation is over...<br>
<span style="color:#fef15e;">Arbiter: The Devil XV：</span><br>
Do you know where you are right now?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Princeton ：</span><br>
Inside a simulation created by the Sea of Stars' systems?<br>
<span style="color:#fef15e;">Arbiter: The Devil XV：</span><br>
And, do you know where that simulation space is located?<br>
Actually, let's go on step further. Do you know how the "Galactic Core" is even able to generate simulated worlds in the first place?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Princeton ：</span><br>
I-I don't know. I just arrived at the Sea of Stars, so...<br>
<span style="color:#fef15e;">Arbiter: The Devil XV：</span><br>
Really? First day on the job, and you got caught up in this mess. Ahahah!<br>
How interesting. It really does make me feel better knowing there are folks out there with luck even worse than mine.<br>
Since I'm in a good mood, I'll let you in on a little something. You see...<br>
...Don't tell them? And who are you, telling me what not to do?<br>
...Ah, of course. You've gotten good at concealing yourself.<br>
...Fine, then I won't tell them. I'll just watch what happens.<br>
...You'll really set me free if help you out?<br>
...I already have a plan – to run off amidst all the chaos.<br>
...That's a good idea. We have a deal.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Princeton ：</span><br>
Who are you talking to?<br>
<span style="color:#fef15e;">Arbiter: The Devil XV：</span><br>
Nobody. My speech synthesizer was just on the fritz.<br>
Listen up – I hate dealing with those Harbingers as much as you do.<br>
So I'm going to help you out this one time.<br>
Help you as much as this vessel is able to, anyway...<br>
It's a cheap knockoff, but it's better than nothing.<br>
I'll do something about those mist entities. You two run that-a-way in the meantime.<br>
Yeah, toward that glowing thing. I'll send Laffey the exact coordinates.<br>
Go through that and you'll be able to exit the simulation. Now go.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Princeton ：</span><br>
L-Laffey?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Laffey II：</span><br>
Yeah, the communications system sent me some coordinates. Glowy coordinates...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Princeton ：</span><br>
Seems we have no choice but to go and check it out.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Laffey II：</span><br>
You're off the hook this time, Devil. Let's go, Princeton.<br>

TB, it glowed again...<br>
I'll break the glass!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">TB ：</span><br>
Don't worry, Anchorage.<br>
In crisis mode, I have full control of all resources within the Sea of Stars.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Anchorage：</span><br>
...Hm?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">TB ：</span><br>
In other words, there's no need for you to break the glass.<br>
Status report: I've successfully isolated the hostile data within a sandbox.<br>
At this time, it is impossible to delete the data.<br>
Due to the hostile data's attack on our communications system, I've taken the system offline to physically isolate it from said data.<br>
It will be impossible to leave the control room or communicate with the outside. I'm sorry.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Anchorage：</span><br>
It's okay. I'm right here...<br>
TB, go!<br>
Fight that data!<br>
I'll draw you a picture!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">TB ：</span><br>
Thank you for that.<br>
Question: why have you mentioned the act of drawing?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Anchorage：</span><br>
Huh? Don't you draw, too?<br>
You drew that on the screen. It's cute.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">TB ：</span><br>
On the screen?<br>
That is no drawing. It's simply a visual display of the affected area.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Anchorage：</span><br>

Umm... Like a beacon?<br>

<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Laffey II：</span><br>
Northampton left the exercise early...<br>
Princeton was with me until just a minute ago.<br>
We were running from the black tornado, and then she was gone...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Guam：</span><br>
Running from a black tornado...? So were we!<br>
Wait, you and Princeton got separated?!<br>
Laffey, don't move a muscle! I'm on my way!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Laffey II：</span><br>
...When I went to the coordinates the Arbiter gave us, I was warped here.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Louisville：</span><br>
It sounds almost supernatural...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Flasher：</span><br>
*sob*... I thought this was a simulation, but then Devil suddenly started talking... It was so scary...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Guam：</span><br>
Argh... All this crazy stuff is happening, and I can't even broadcast it!<br>
Princeton was going with Laffey to the exit, but she disappeared when Laffey warped here!<br>
We can't reach her over comms. Maybe she was warped somewhere else!<br>
Why do I feel like I've been dragged into a hot mess?!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Constellation：</span><br>
Aaaaaaaaah!<br>
San Jacinto, wh-where's the tornado?! It's not chasing us, is it?!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">San Jacinto：</span><br>
Phew... I don't see it around... I-it looks like we managed to get to safety.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Guam：</span><br>
...Constellation?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Constellation：</span><br>
...Huh?<br>
Wh-what's going on? Louisville? Flasher? Laffey? Why are you all here...?<br>
More importantly... Where are we?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Guam：</span><br>
Uh, so it's a long story...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Laffey II：</span><br>
Do I have to explain everything again...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Guam：</span><br>
If you don't mind, Laffey! Pretty please!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Constellation：</span><br>
Laffey's group was in the NY City experiment zone, while Guam's was in the Coral Sea. Both were chased off by the black tornado...<br>
There must have been a major malfunction at the Galactic Core.<br>
Could it have happened while I was investigating the abnormal data...?<br>
Everyone, I'm sorry.<br>
It's all my fault. If I wasn't so anxious to make progress...<br>
Everyone tried to stop me, too, especially poor Flasher...<br>
If only I'd been more careful... *sniffle*...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Flasher：</span><br>
*sob*... I-it's okay... As long as you're okay, Stella, everything's gonna be fine...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Guam：</span><br>
Yeah! Hear that, Stella? We're fine as long as you're fine!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Constellation：</span><br>
...Why are you calling me that, too?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Guam：</span><br>
Just livening up the show as any good star should!<br>
There's no use crying over spilled milk. What's done is done.<br>
Besides, it's not like it's the worst-case scenario.<br>
TB said there wasn't any danger when you analyzed the data, right? So there was no way of knowing this would happen when you used the Reality Lens to study it.<br>
Unless you just never studied it, this would've happened sooner or later.<br>
It sucks that so many of us got wrapped up in it, but that just means we can all help each other out of this mess!<br>
Imagine if you were the only one connected. Now THAT would be the worst case.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Constellation：</span><br>
...Th-thank you for trying to console me...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Guam：</span><br>
Not even! This is rational analysis. You mentioned the Commander before you connected, too.<br>
What kind of situation did the Commander get into? What adventures awaited, and how did the Commander escape danger?<br>
You gave an example, and I say we should learn from it. Right?<br>
Either way, no feeling sorry for ourselves! You know the Sea of Stars the most of all of us, so we're relying on you!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Constellation：</span><br>
But you wouldn't all be in danger if I hadn't done anything, so relying on me is just...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Guam：</span><br>
Fine, then. Constellation, take responsibility and get us all outta here!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">San Jacinto：</span><br>
Ahahaha... You know how to hit her where it hurts.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Guam：</span><br>
Heheh. Do I?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Flasher：</span><br>
Cheer up, Stella... I know you can get us all home safe!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Louisville：</span><br>
Right! You can do it, Constellation!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Laffey II：</span><br>
We should find Princeton, too... *yawn*...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Constellation：</span><br>
O-of course... I don't have time to feel sorry for myself right now...!<br>
For the sake of those who believe in me, I have to do everything in my power to take everyone home!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Guam：</span><br>
There you go! You're on fire!<br>
And don't you worry – I'll record all of your efforts for you!<br>
Things might not be great right now, but it's cool if I record, right?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Constellation：</span><br>
Of course. Those recordings will be necessary later.<br>
Record as much as you like. When we get back, I'll have the Analysis Department go through the footage. I'll see that it's returned to you once they're done.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Guam：</span><br>
Woohoo!<br>
Sorry to put you on the spot, but what's the plan, Boss?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Constellation：</span><br>
U-umm... First, let's... search our surroundings? Yes, let's do that.<br>
There must be a reason we were brought to the same place from simulations made by different machines.<br>
Let's look around and find some clues!<br>

<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Flasher：</span><br>
Stella, my salvager is picking up a strange reading!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Constellation：</span><br>
I knew there had to be something that gathered us all here in one place.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Flasher：</span><br>
The signal source is underwater... I'll go have a look-see!<br>
<br>
A while later, Flasher resurfaced with a metallic object in hand.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Flasher：</span><br>
I'm back, Stella!<br>
I found this th-thing!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Guam：</span><br>
Wait, I thought your salvage gear was designed to retrieve data?<br>
Are you saying it can do regular salvage, too?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Flasher：</span><br>
Ordinarily, you'd use the salvager to scan an object's data and send it to the Sea of Stars, but there's no telling if the Sea of Stars is operating at normal capacity now...<br>
And there's no analysis device here, so... I just b-brought this thing up with me...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Guam：</span><br>
You've got a point. Analyzing it ourselves is our only option in this case.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Flasher：</span><br>
Stella, this object gives off readings pretty similar to the abnormal data we found in the Coral Sea simulation!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Constellation：</span><br>
It does? Let me have a look...<br>
<br>
Flasher handed the device to Constellation, who began to inspect it.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Constellation：</span><br>
Hmm... Metallic exterior. Structurally divided into two parts.<br>
The stand is ten centimeters and the main unit is thirty. It looks like some sort of transmitter.<br>
Considering the material, it's quite lightweight... The panel is damaged, leaving its circuitry exposed. It's clearly broken.<br>
Manufacturer information... No, the letters are too worn to read.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Guam：</span><br>
Have you figured anything out?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Constellation：</span><br>
Only that it's horribly destroyed. So, nothing useful.<br>
Judging by the stand, I believe it's a floating transmitter. Meaning, it's a small beacon.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Guam：</span><br>
A... beacon?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Constellation：</span><br>
Yes, the kind that aids in navigation. It might be what's responsible for warping us all here.<br>
The strangest thing about this place is that, unlike those other simulations, it doesn't exist amongst the data we have.<br>
So how in the world did we end up here? The only thing I can think of is that the Sea of Stars and the Reality Lens are linked to that future the Commander got sent to, but...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Guam：</span><br>
Uhh, I'm not following you. What exactly are you talking about?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Constellation：</span><br>
Why we got warped here. All I have now is speculation, though.<br>
At any rate, we have a clue as to how we got here. The next thing is to figure out what this place is.<br>
Jacinto, did your aerial reconnaissance find anything?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">San Jacinto：</span><br>
I'll cut to the chase. There is absolutely nothing in the sea or on the islands.<br>
There are no fish in the water or animals on land. Nor are there any signs of vegetation, insects, or even fungal life.<br>
Finally, the thing that looks like a mountain range in the distance is actually a huge heap of trash.<br>
To put it in other words, this space is made up almost entirely of man-made stuff.<br>
Oh, and there is a flying artificial island not far from here. Almost looks Siren-made, if you ask me.<br>
Here's a photo.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Louisville：</span><br>
Oh... I recognize this. That's one of the Sirens' floating fortresses.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Guam：</span><br>
What's that tucked away in the corner? Some kind of materials storehouse?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Constellation：</span><br>
It seems the Sirens are carrying out a huge resource collection project in this sea. Or maybe they've taken to recycling.<br>
Either way, I've never seen anything like this.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Guam：</span><br>
Oh! What if we've happened upon a secret supply base of theirs?<br>
That gives me an idea! Hang on a sec...<br>
<br>
Guam cupped her hands together, scooped up a handful of seawater, and drank it in one gulp.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Constellation：</span><br>
Wh-what are you doing?!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Flasher：</span><br>
Um, there's water right here if you're thirsty, Guam.<br>
Drinking water from the sea could make you sick...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Guam：</span><br>
I wasn't sure if the simulation ran that deep, but it was worth it to test my theory.<br>
Jacinto, you must've gotten a good view of this area with your planes. Are you sure this is a sea?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">San Jacinto：</span><br>
Well... Yeah? Why do you ask?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Guam：</span><br>
Because I couldn't taste the sea in the seawater. It just tasted like water.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Constellation：</span><br>
Really? I need to see for myself...<br>
...You're right. It's no different from regular tap water. I don't like what that implies.<br>
Flasher, did you bring any equipment that can analyze water?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Flasher：</span><br>
Y-yeah, I did!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Constellation：</span><br>
Great. Run an analysis on this sample.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Flasher：</span><br>
Stella, it's done...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Constellation：</span><br>
Not even trace amounts of minerals, let alone any salt. Nothing more than two hydrogens and an oxygen.<br>
In other words, this entire ocean is made of distilled water.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Guam：</span><br>
That's so weird. Did the Sirens, like, filter out all the minerals?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Louisville：</span><br>
Then this would be purification on an unprecedented scale. Seawater consists of around 3% salt, so...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Communicator：</span><br>
BEEP BEEP!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Laffey II：</span><br>
I'm getting weird readings on my IFF system...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Guam：</span><br>
Weird readings? Can you glean anything from them?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Laffey II：</span><br>
Nope... Only their identification signals.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Louisville：</span><br>
At least they're within radar detection range.<br>
The terrain here is rather messy, so maybe the signals are from a Siren fleet in hiding?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Guam：</span><br>
Broadcasting ID signals isn't something Sirens typically do.<br>
Though I guess they could be doing it to lure us into a trap.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Laffey II：</span><br>
I'm getting another signal, but this time it's different. I can't identify it...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">San Jacinto：</span><br>
If I may ask, how come only you are able to receive these signals anyway?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Guam：</span><br>
Might be because her rigging isn't her original rigging, but rather built on simulation data.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Constellation：</span><br>
If I were them and I was waiting in ambush, I wouldn't want to put my target on high alert by sending signals to them.<br>
Whoever's broadcasting these is most likely trying to tell us that they know we're here.<br>
...At any rate, we won't get anything done by standing around.<br>
Laffey, send an identification signal back. We'll see how they respond and go from there.<br>
{{折叠面板|内容结束}}

{{折叠面板|标题=The United Council|选项=20|主框=1|样式=primary|展开=是}}
<br>
The shipgirls assumed a combat-ready formation and sailed onward through the vast, distilled sea.<br>
Each time the unidentified signal changed in frequency, Laffey updated her own signal in response.<br>
The two sides had formed a strange kind of tacit understanding, even though neither one knew the meaning behind the other's signal.<br>
As they circled around an artificial island, they finally laid eyes on the source of the signal.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Louisville：</span><br>
Is that fleet of warships... floating in the air?<br>
I'm not seeing things, am I?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">San Jacinto：</span><br>
You're not. Their hulls are definitely not touching the water.<br>
If I had to guess, they're floating at least ten meters above the surface.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Laffey II：</span><br>
There are so many of them... but they don't show up on the radar.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Guam：</span><br>
Whoa, whoa, are they rocking the same stealth tech as the Ashes?!<br>
Pardon my potty mouth, but holy shit...<br>
Ashes camouflaging themselves is one thing, but these are hundred-meter-long ships!<br>
<br>
Regardless of how unbelievable the shipgirls thought it, the very real fleet made up of dozens of ships was slowly approaching them.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Constellation：</span><br>
They have several corvettes, and what looks like battleships and aircraft carriers.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Guam：</span><br>
The biggest one has gotta be their flagship.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Constellation：</span><br>
Probably, yeah. It's over a kilometer long... It's more like a fortress than a ship.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Guam：</span><br>
And to think we call our simulation opponents "the fleet of the future."<br>
This fleet makes those things look like toys...<br>
What in the world ARE these guys?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Constellation：</span><br>
You tell me. Some science fiction starfleet, I guess?<br>
<span style="color:#fef15e;">Communicator：</span><br>
BEEP BEEP!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Laffey II：</span><br>
...They're sending us an unencrypted broadcast.<br>
<span style="color:#fef15e;">???：</span><br>
This is the Council's Task Force 5, addressing the KAN-SEN in our path.<br>
Your identification signal cannot be parsed.<br>
State your fleet number and objective in this area at once.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Constellation：</span><br>
Such a monotone voice... It strongly reminds me of TB's. Do you think they have an AI, too?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">San Jacinto：</span><br>
TB's voice is a lot more friendly, if you ask me.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Guam：</span><br>
Constellation, you should probably give them a swift answer.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Constellation：</span><br>
R-right. Quick communication is essential in cases like this...<br>
Err... Actually, you handle it, Guam! Find out who they are and what they want!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Guam：</span><br>
You got it! This pretty presenter has you covered!<br>
Ahem. This is the Eagle Union's... uh... Sea of Stars Testing Fleet!<br>
Now I have a question for you! What is "the Council" and how did you get here?<br>
<span style="color:#fef15e;">???：</span><br>
Querying database for "Eagle Union Sea of Stars Testing Fleet"...<br>
No results matching those keywords found.<br>
I'll take that to mean you are a classified Union-affiliated fleet. Is that correct?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Guam：</span><br>
It's not wrong, considering how hush-hush the Sea of Stars is... So, yeah, we're a classified fleet!<br>
<span style="color:#fef15e;">???：</span><br>
Activating scanning module...<br>
Abnormal readings detected.<br>
Warning: Category V corrosion threat detected. Alert mode has been engaged as per security protocols.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Louisville：</span><br>
What is a "Category V corrosion threat"?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Flasher：</span><br>
*sniffle*... W-warning? That doesn't sound good...<br>
<span style="color:#fef15e;">???：</span><br>
Order: explain why the Council beacon in your possession has been damaged.<br>
Order: provide the current location of the fleet to which the beacon originally belonged.<br>
Order: lay down your arms and submit to an inspection.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Guam：</span><br>
Hey! What's this all of a sudden?!<br>
We found the beacon just lying there underwater! We have no idea who it belonged to!<br>
Also, "lay down our arms?" Fat chance! Who do you think you are to boss us around?<br>
<span style="color:#fef15e;">???：</span><br>
Repeat: this is the Council's Task Force 5.<br>
Order: lay down your arms and submit to an inspection.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Guam：</span><br>
Thanks for the non-answer! What the hell is this "Council" anyway?!<br>
<span style="color:#fef15e;">???：</span><br>
Diagnosis: KAN-SEN group has been exposed to Category V corrosion.<br>
Corrosion Stage: Initial.<br>
Symptoms: Hallucinations, cognitive dissociation.<br>
Corrosion Source: Harbingers.<br>
Recommended Actions: Neutralize targets, non-lethally if possible. Following neutralization, administer sedative agents and cure corrosion.<br>
Initiating anti-corrosion measures now.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">San Jacinto：</span><br>
It sounds like they think we're infected with something. Poor you, Guam.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Guam：</span><br>
Is that how you see me? As some hallucinating whackjob?<br>
Now I'm angry! Whether you're an AI or not, you've obviously got junk for brains!<br>
You're not even a hundredth, no, a thousandth as good as TB! I'm gonna send you to the scrapheap!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Louisville：</span><br>
Umm, seeing as she said they'd go easy on us, maybe we shouldn't retaliate with full force?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Guam：</span><br>
Hmph. No, we're giving them all we've got for the sake of the show! Isn't that right, Laffey?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Laffey II：</span><br>
Both ways are fine by me.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Constellation：</span><br>
(I have many questions, but it seems I'll have to sit on them until the fighting is over.)<br>
(At least we'll gather some data while we're at it. You don't do battle with flying warships every day.)<br>
Since they're holding back, we should give them the same courtesy! Prepare for battle!<br>

KABOOOM!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Laffey II：</span><br>
Oof... They neutralized my electronic warfare systems...<br>
Look out for the shockwaves of their bombs!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">San Jacinto：</span><br>
Their aircraft are suppressing us. They've got the clear upper hand in the air!<br>
Are those aircraft they're launching actually drones or what?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Guam：</span><br>
They're unmanned, that much I can tell for sure.<br>
The ships themselves, those are nothing like the mass-produced ships we know.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Flasher：</span><br>
And they don't even touch the water, they hover above it... *sob*...<br>
I'm useless against them... Sorry...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Louisville：</span><br>
There, there, it's okay. It's not your fault.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Constellation：</span><br>
(Is that why they fly? As a countermeasure against submarines? But surely it takes an inordinate amount of energy to keep them airborne...)<br>
(Maybe the energy cost isn't a big issue to them. Like if their energy source is practically limitless...)<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Guam：</span><br>
We're struggling here, Constellation. Should we retreat?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Constellation：</span><br>
...Jacinto, create an escape route.<br>
I'll stay here and try to hold out a little longer.<br>
They don't want to sink us, and we need to take advantage of that.<br>
Keep fighting! Get as much data as possible to bring back home!<br>

<br>
KABOOOM!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Guam：</span><br>
Ugh... They are trying HARD to disarm us! Half of my cannons are inoperable!<br>
Stella, my reliable and sweet genius, can we please retreat already?!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Constellation：</span><br>
As much as I'd like to gather more data... you're right. We'll be in danger if we stay any longer.<br>
Jacinto made an escape route for us. Let's retreat to the Siren base I just marked on the map.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Guam：</span><br>
If there are any Sirens there, they're more likely to target the flying fleet than us! Good thinking!<br>
And while they're duking it out, that's when we get out of Dodge!<br>
<br>
Just then, a massive machine flew forth, leaving the floating fleet's formation.<br>
<span style="color:#fef15e;">???：</span><br>
There was an error in the data. These girls have not been corroded.<br>
All ships, cease fire. Flagship's orders.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Constellation：</span><br>
Uh-oh... That rigging...<br>
<span style="color:#fef15e;">War Protocol Fortress：</span><br>
I am War Protocol Fortress, member of the Council's Task Force 5.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Guam：</span><br>
She's a Siren!<br>
<span style="color:#fef15e;">War Protocol Fortress：</span><br>
What?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Guam：</span><br>
Oh god, oh man! What now, Constellation?!<br>
Pitting Sirens against other Sirens isn't gonna work! We need a new plan, stat!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Constellation：</span><br>
I know! I couldn't possibly have predicted this!<br>
Running away isn't going to work... It's highly likely the Siren is in control of those ships.<br>
But not all hope is lost yet.<br>
That one looks like their control unit, so if we just defeat her, the rest of the fleet should be easy pickings!<br>
<span style="color:#fef15e;">War Protocol Fortress：</span><br>
Hold on a–<br>

KABOOOM!<br>
The shipgirls were locked in a fierce battle, only barely holding up the frontline against the swarms of drones.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Guam：</span><br>
Constellation, look! Their damaged drones are all landing on that saucer-shaped thing!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Constellation：</span><br>
Yeah. That must be their repair machine. One more thing I noticed, Guam...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Guam：</span><br>
Oh yeah? What?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Constellation：</span><br>
They're being extremely conservative with their warships.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Guam：</span><br>
That's all?<br>
You have a point, though. We haven't actually disabled any of their warships, despite hitting them with all we've got.<br>
They retreat back as soon as they get slightly scratched up. Hell, some of the Sirens use themselves as meatshields to protect their warships.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Constellation：</span><br>
Exactly. For whatever reason, they're going out of their way not to take any losses.<br>
I think we can turn this around if we're able to exploit that!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Guam：</span><br>
In other words, focus on one target at a time?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Constellation：</span><br>
Correct! Everyone, I'll designate an enemy – focus fire on it!<br>

Eliminating threats now.<br>
<br>
KABOOOM!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Princeton META：</span><br>
Stop, Fortress! These girls are not a threat to us!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Laffey II：</span><br>
Did Princeton just... come down from the sky?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Guam：</span><br>
Isn't she... META?<br>
Why is a META siding with the Sirens? What's the meaning of this?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Constellation：</span><br>
Everyone, cease fire and step back for now!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Princeton META：</span><br>
We lose contact for just a while, and look what happens...<br>
I TOLD you to stop attacking, Fortress. What's the matter with you?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">War Protocol Fortress：</span><br>
...They attacked me first.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Princeton META：</span><br>
Don't make excuses.<br>
Ms. Silver Fox has summoned you. She probably wants you to fix our comms system so things like this won't happen again!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">War Protocol Fortress：</span><br>
...Fine. Deal with these girls for me, then.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Princeton META：</span><br>
*sigh*... Hey, you KAN-SEN!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Guam：</span><br>
Who? Us?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Princeton META：</span><br>
Who do you think? Yes, you.<br>
Are you really with the Eagle Union? Why did you attack one of the Council's fleets?<br>
And after I expressly asked Ms. Silver Fox to double-check that you don't have any corrosion on you...<br>
I can't cover for you if you attack friends and foes indiscriminately, you know.<br>
Which of you is in charge? Who gave the order?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Laffey II：</span><br>
Princeton is fuming...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Constellation：</span><br>
Guam...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Guam：</span><br>
(Uh-oh, she's got that "Guam, you better say something" look!)<br>
Ahem. I am Eagle Union large cruiser Guam, hull number CB-2. I'm in charge of this fleet.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Princeton META：</span><br>
*sigh*... No, you aren't, Guam.<br>
Constellation is.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Constellation：</span><br>
...How did you know?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Princeton META：</span><br>
It's obvious. No sane person would put her in charge of your fleet.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Guam：</span><br>
Excuse me? Do you even know who I am?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Princeton META：</span><br>
I do – all too well, even. I'm from the Union myself, in case you forgot.<br>
I know all of you. You, Constellation, Laffey, San Jacinto, Louisville, Flasher...<br>
You know who I am, too. You called me Princeton just a minute ago.<br>
And yet, you treat me like a stranger.<br>
You don't recognize the Council or Fortress, and I can't parse your identification signals...<br>
So Ms. Silver Fox was right. You ARE from another time and space.<br>
Great. Seems we're going to be here for a while.<br>
Fortress, set up a temporary base.<br>
<br>
Upon receiving Princeton's orders, the floating warships came to life.<br>
Starting with the capital ships in the rear of the fleet, the steel giants slowly began descending to the surface.<br>
After settling in the water, the decks of the warships moved aside, exposing the cannons inside their hulls.<br>
Looking at the bores of these cannons stirred a sense of security in one's soul.<br>
Following their larger brethren, the massive repair ship and the vessels damaged in the battle finally touched down and began repairs.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Constellation：</span><br>
You're really hunkering down, I see.<br>
I was wondering what weapons those ships in the back had, since they didn't fight in the battle. Turns out they have large-caliber guns stowed away inside.<br>
They need to be in the water in order to use them, don't they?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Princeton META：</span><br>
Yup. Those are citadel ships, they're our main defense when we set up a temporary base.<br>
Now that we have time to talk, let me explain the situation from our perspective.<br>
Before arriving here, we got into a space-time anomaly. It appeared without warning, damaging a lot of our equipment to the point of rendering it nonfunctional.<br>
As a result, we jumped the gun and attacked you before we knew whether you were corroded or not.<br>
For that, I apologize on behalf of all of us.<br>
We are not your enemy and we mean no harm to you.<br>
I hope that clears the air between us. I'm sure we both have many questions, so let's talk inside.<br>
Oh, and Guam, no photography is allowed inside the restricted areas. Understood?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Guam：</span><br>
Ahahaha... Fine, fine!<br>

<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Princeton META：</span><br>
Alright, so, there are a few differences between you and the versions of you that I'm familiar with.<br>
It's not easy to describe the differences, but if I had to say, it's like you're from a parallel universe.<br>
You should know what I mean if you've read any old science fiction.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Constellation：</span><br>
The most striking difference from our perspective is that you have flying warships.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Princeton META：</span><br>
Well, science and technology develop quickly when the need arises.<br>
Is this your world, by the way? How do you live here?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Guam：</span><br>
We don't! The branch we come from isn't nearly this ruined.<br>
It can't be your world either, seeing as you asked that question.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Princeton META：</span><br>
Nope. The world we come from is... um, pretty far off.<br>
We were just sailing in our home branch until we picked up a distress signal coming from a Council beacon.<br>
It wasn't that far away, so we took it upon ourselves to come to the rescue.<br>
We followed the signal for a while, and then all of a sudden we got caught in the space-time anomaly I mentioned before.<br>
Then this and that happened and we wound up here.<br>
Now, how did you get your hands on that Council beacon?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Constellation：</span><br>
By "beacon," you mean this device... right?<br>
It's a long story... Sorry, I can't think straight now. I've been up late lately and haven't gotten much sleep...<br>
I think I'm going to pass out... Guam, take it from here...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Guam：</span><br>
Huh? Wait, I can't just– Oh, she's out cold.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Princeton META：</span><br>
Heehee. Knowing her, she's been staying up to gaze at the stars.<br>
It's a strange feeling, knowing a person so well even though you've never met them before.<br>
You heard her, Guam. Kindly explain it to me.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Guam：</span><br>
Okay. Well, it started this morning when I was in the hangar...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Princeton META：</span><br>
To be frank, I don't think I understood 10% of that.<br>
Branches can be as different as day and night, it seems...<br>
I know one thing for sure, though – you found the beacon simply by chance.<br>
(Just when I thought we could go home. Of course it wouldn't be that easy...)<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Guam：</span><br>
Yup. We got wrapped up in this, that's all. Now, think you could answer some of our questions?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Princeton META：</span><br>
Of course.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Guam：</span><br>
Did you see Princeton on your way here?<br>
Err, by that I mean another version of you.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Princeton META：</span><br>
Nope. You said you got separated from that Princeton before you found the beacon, no?<br>
So if I had to guess, she's somewhere in this ocean. Her comms equipment might be malfunctioning, like ours.<br>
We'll help you find her.<br>
Fortress, start a search for Princeton.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">War Protocol Fortress：</span><br>
Orders received.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Guam：</span><br>
Thanks a bunch! Uh...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Laffey II：</span><br>
*staaaaare*...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Princeton META：</span><br>
Laffey has been glaring at Fortress for some time now.<br>
Not only that, she and the rest of you attacked her for no reason when you saw her.<br>
Why? Did she do something wrong in your home branch?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Guam：</span><br>
"Something" is putting it mildly.<br>
She's a Siren. How can you fight side by side with her like this?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Princeton META：</span><br>
There seems to be a misunderstanding here. Fortress is an ANTI-X who has been specially modified to serve the Council.<br>
And I am a KAN-SEN who also serves the Council. Why would we NOT fight together?<br>
For that matter, what is a "Siren?"<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Guam：</span><br>
ANTI-X...? Oh, right, the Commander's files said that's one of the names they go by.<br>
In our branch, the Sirens are our enemy!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Princeton META：</span><br>
Wait, you're saying that ANTI-X and your "Sirens" are the same? And they're your enemies?<br>
I don't understand. Why would the ANTI-X and KAN-SEN be at war? What is there to fight over...?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Guam：</span><br>
What do you mean "why?" They came out of nowhere and wreaked havoc on our seas!<br>
They tried to take everything from us! As shipgirls, it's our duty to get rid of them and reclaim what belongs to humanity!<br>
The Sirens are our enemies and must be destroyed at any cost!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Princeton META：</span><br>
...How could that be?<br>
What about X, then? What happened to your war with them?<br>
The whole reason we thought you had been corroded was because our AI detected the presence of Harbingers.<br>
Don't tell me you're waging wars on both X AND the ANTI-X at the same time?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Guam：</span><br>
Huh? The Sirens are our number one enemy. You keep saying "X," and I don't even know what that is.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">War Protocol Fortress：</span><br>
Princeton, you have a message from the flagship. Ms. Silver Fox is calling for you.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Princeton META：</span><br>
Okay, I'll be right there. Watch these girls while I... Actually, that's not such a good idea.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Laffey II：</span><br>
*staaaaare*...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Constellation：</span><br>
*yaaawn*... Sorry for dozing off like that.<br>
We'll be fine here. Plus, I want to get a closer look at Fortress.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Princeton META：</span><br>
Alright. Fortress, keep them company.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Guam：</span><br>
Wow, you weren't out for long, Constellation. I thought you'd sleep all day.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Constellation：</span><br>
I would have, but then my stomach started growling.<br>
Which is strange, because you shouldn't be able to feel hunger or thirst in a simulation, and yet...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Princeton META：</span><br>
"Simulation?" What?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Constellation：</span><br>
Oh, nothing.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Princeton META：</span><br>
...Fortress, get started on an early dinner. I'll eat with you when I get back.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">War Protocol Fortress：</span><br>
Orders received.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Princeton META：</span><br>
I'd better get going now.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Constellation：</span><br>
Sorry, one last thing! If you have any books that detail the history of your branch, could I borrow them?<br>
We have some time to kill before dinner, after all.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Princeton META：</span><br>
Hmm... Yes, the information you want should be in our supply vessel's library.<br>
Give me a sec, I'll copy the files over for...<br>
Huh? Access denied? Fortress, what's going on?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">War Protocol Fortress：</span><br>
You should go to the flagship first. It's possible Ms. Silver Fox is getting impatient and has limited your access.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Princeton META：</span><br>
It wouldn't surprise me if she did.<br>
I'll be back in a bit. If anything happens, we'll discuss it later.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Constellation：</span><br>
*sigh*...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Guam：</span><br>
Hang in there, Yawny McYawnface. Dinner's just around the corner.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Constellation：</span><br>
That wasn't a yawn, it was... Ah, forget it.<br>
You wouldn't understand.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Guam：</span><br>
"Wouldn't understand"? I think I know the situation pretty well, considering I was the one asking the questions!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Constellation：</span><br>
Fine. I was just thinking about something...<br>
Why would this "Silver Fox" restrict Princeton's access?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Guam：</span><br>
Iunno. To make her hurry up?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Constellation：</span><br>
I don't think it's as simple as that. Princeton trusts us, whereas Silver Fox clearly doesn't.<br>
Getting important information out of her is not going to be easy.<br>

<br>
An hour later, Princeton META returned from her visit to the flagship.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Princeton META：</span><br>
Sorry, that took longer than I expected.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Constellation：</span><br>
Was your access issue resolved?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Princeton META：</span><br>
Uh, more or less. As embarrassing as it is to admit, it happened because of another malfunction.<br>
Now, it's pretty late, so shall we have dinner?<br>
<br>
Princeton stood up and suddenly noticed that on the low table behind her, there was a small heap of snacks piled up.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Princeton META：</span><br>
Is... Is that Oxy-cola Classic?!<br>
And tortillas, and chips, and fruits, too!<br>
Are these all yours?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Guam：</span><br>
Yup. We heard all your food is rations that put shelf life over taste, so we thought we'd bring out some food we took with us.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Princeton META：</span><br>
...You use precious storage space on treats and snacks when you're going into battle?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Guam：</span><br>
(We weren't exactly expecting to go into battle today, so...)<br>
Umm, these are things we just grabbed on the fly. Aren't your standard-issue naval MREs a lot more satisfying than this stuff?<br>
Wait... What is that stuff? You guys ARE a formal fighting force, right?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Princeton META：</span><br>
*sigh*... We have to settle for synthetic food when we're on active duty.<br>
To tell the truth, I don't know how many years since I last had real snacks or fruit...<br>
<br>
Princeton looked at the cans of cola with a longing twinkle in her eyes.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Constellation：</span><br>
Well, now you can have as much as you like. Don't be shy.<br>
There is more than enough to go around.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Princeton META：</span><br>
Really? Oh, man! Don't mind if I do!<br>
Phew! That hits the spot! I've missed this taste!<br>
I've tried again and again to replicate it ever since they changed the recipe, but I never got it right.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Constellation：</span><br>
They changed Oxy-cola's recipe?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Princeton META：</span><br>
Yeah... If only the recipe hadn't been lost in the war...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Constellation：</span><br>
The war...?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Princeton META：</span><br>
Err! I misspoke! There was no war!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Constellation：</span><br>
You're not allowed to speak about it, are you?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Princeton META：</span><br>
...Yeah. No use in trying to hide it from you.<br>
See, we have this brilliant scientist on board.<br>
She told me you have to be very cautious when dealing with a space-time anomaly.<br>
Anything I do could have a butterfly effect, so the range of things I can discuss with you is extremely limited.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Constellation：</span><br>
Is this scientist "Ms. Silver Fox," by any chance?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Princeton META：</span><br>
......<br>
Well, it looks like the lady herself wants to greet you. Fortress, reroute the comms lines to me.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">War Protocol Fortress：</span><br>
Understood. Rerouting now.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Silver Fox：</span><br>
Rad vstreche, travelers. I am Silver Fox, a member of the Council.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Constellation：</span><br>
Is that a codename? Are you silver like the color of your hair, and a fox because you're as cunning as one?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Silver Fox：</span><br>
I didn't choose this codename, so I can't say if the fox part is accurate or not.<br>
However, yes, the silver part is because of my hair color.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Constellation：</span><br>
Ah. If I may ask, would it be possible for us to speak to you in person?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Silver Fox：</span><br>
Unfortunately, no. The world I inhabit – the world I have seen – is not a good place for you to be.<br>
For a myriad of reasons, it's best that we don't meet face to face.<br>
Furthermore, we should refrain from learning too much about each other in order to minimize the impact on the space-time continuum.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Constellation：</span><br>
I see... Sorry for the sudden question, but do you believe in fate?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Silver Fox：</span><br>
Do I believe in an omnipresent entity that has determined a course for everyone?<br>
No, I do not.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Constellation：</span><br>
Okay, then what do you think about miracles that occur by happenstance?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Silver Fox：</span><br>
Philosophy is not my specialty. Does this tie into your previous question about fate?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Constellation：</span><br>
I do horoscope reading as a hobby. Some people dismiss it as just confirmation bias, of course...<br>
But I divined multiple times today, and the result was the same each time: "things will go well for you."<br>
You can chalk that up to random chance, sure, but I believe in miracles even so.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Silver Fox：</span><br>
You're describing a self-fulfilling prophecy. You believe in fate, so you only give weight to things that go in your favor.<br>
Let's not forget that you ran into trouble before you arrived here, and also got separated from a friend.<br>
Do you really consider those among the things that "went well" for you?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Constellation：</span><br>
I mean...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Silver Fox：</span><br>
Furthermore, even the things you think are positive may not be so in reality.<br>
The beacon you found was not only physically damaged, but also the data within it has been corroded by X.<br>
While we are repairing and purifying it, it may turn out to be beyond salvaging.<br>
Now, let's finally consider the possibility that our meeting was no work of fate, no miracle, no coincidence.<br>
You were drawn to the beacon because your equipment pointed you to it. So did ours. We simply headed toward the same point independently.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Constellation：</span><br>
...I suppose you're right.<br>
I can only hope and pray your repairs go well. That beacon may be our key to getting home.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Silver Fox：</span><br>
Getting home... Yes, perhaps.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Constellation：</span><br>
As you said, it's probably for the best if we don't ask each other big questions.<br>
But, I'd hate to completely pass on this golden opportunity. Can't we just ask a few questions and no more than that?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Silver Fox：</span><br>
Only if they're benign. I do not want to take any risks here.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Constellation：</span><br>
Gosh, you're quite insistent...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Silver Fox：</span><br>
That I am. People often say I'm a risk-averse person.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Guam：</span><br>
Seeing as serious questions are off the table, why don't we have some fun with the format?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Silver Fox：</span><br>
What do you mean?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Guam：</span><br>
By turning it into a quiz!<br>
It's simple – we'll start by asking a few questions. If you can't answer them, that's totally fine.<br>
Then when our turn is over, YOU get to ask US questions.<br>
And the amount of questions you can ask is the same as the amount of our questions you answered, and on top of that, we'll answer ANY question no matter what!<br>
This way, the initiative is all yours. You can control how much or how little information we exchange.<br>
How's that? Sounds like a good arrangement, doesn't it?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Silver Fox：</span><br>
Hmm...<br>
You really thought this through. Alright, I'll bite.<br>
Let's say you can ask up to six questions. One for each of you, including your Princeton.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Guam：</span><br>
Gotcha!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Constellation：</span><br>
(Nice quick thinking, Guam!)<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Guam：</span><br>
(Heh. Good improv skills are a must in my line of work!)<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Silver Fox：</span><br>
...It seems we'll have to postpone that quiz for a while.<br>
A corrosion phenomenon – or "black tornado," as you call it – has appeared.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Louisville：</span><br>
Oh, dear. Do you think the beacon attracted it, like how it attracted us?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">San Jacinto：</span><br>
We're dealing with a stubborn storm, eh...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Princeton META：</span><br>
Fortress, defend the base. I'll take the fleet and deal with it.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Guam：</span><br>
Let us at 'em, too!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Princeton META：</span><br>
Ms. Silver Fox, do we let them?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Silver Fox：</span><br>
Yes. Go ahead.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Princeton META：</span><br>
Okay. Everyone, prepare for battle and follow me!<br>

<br>
The shipgirls left the base and looked up at the sky to see a handful of warships had already taken flight.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Constellation：</span><br>
At a glance, I think that's only about a tenth of your total fleet...<br>
Are you sure that'll be enough?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Princeton META：</span><br>
It's all we need to deal with a phenomenon of this size.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Guam：</span><br>
So, what are we supposed to do?<br>
We want to help, but I don't think us shooting into a storm is going to make it go away.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Princeton META：</span><br>
Shooting it does work, it's just not the most efficient. Sadly, we're in short supply of the weapons most effective against it, so we'll take the simplest approach.<br>
Let me brief you on what a corrosion phenomenon is. It's abnormal weather that manifests only when multiple corrosion-capable entities gather, or when particular singular entities appear.<br>
These phenomena largely dissipate on their own after a while and can only exist for prolonged periods in specific environments.<br>
X's corrosion hasn't set in deeply in this area, and the environment isn't suited for sustained outbreaks either.<br>
That is to say, this storm is actually very weak and will disappear by itself if left alone.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">San Jacinto：</span><br>
So what you're saying is, we don't really have to do anything.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Princeton META：</span><br>
In theory, yes.<br>
In practice, though, we still need to deal with it. Otherwise it will corrupt the things around it and eventually lay waste to this whole area.<br>
Since we lack the resources to attack the tornado directly, we'll have to eliminate the corrosion entities that spawn near it.<br>
The more we eliminate, the faster the phenomenon will die down.<br>
You don't want to sleep to the sound of a storm raging outside, do you?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Constellation：</span><br>
Heck no! Let's deal with it so we can all sleep soundly!<br>

<span style="color:#4eb24e;">War Protocol Fortress：</span><br>
Princeton, unidentified forces are approaching our location.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Princeton META：</span><br>
Unidentified? They must be from that floating island base!<br>
It's been dormant this whole time, so why are they showing themselves now?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">War Protocol Fortress：</span><br>
Based on our aerial reconnaissance, the force was just manufactured at the base.<br>
Sending images now.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Princeton META：</span><br>
They look like low-level ANTI-X combat units, but I've never seen models like these before...<br>
Do you recognize them, Fortress?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">War Protocol Fortress：</span><br>
I do not.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Guam：</span><br>
I do!<br>
I saw 'em in Iron Blood documents the Commander shared with us. These are Enforcers belonging to Arbiter: The Lovers VI.<br>
This first variant is called Combination. It has drones that resemble sea angels, specializing in support and jamming.<br>
The other variant is named Attraction. That one is all about firepower.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Princeton META：</span><br>
Enforcers...? I've never heard of those before.<br>
(I have read about the Lovers in an ANTI-X plan proposal before...)<br>
(But that's all it should be – a proposal.)<br>
Fortress, can you communicate with those units?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">War Protocol Fortress：</span><br>
I tried, but I cannot reach them or transfer control of them.<br>
The protocols they use must differ from mine.<br>
In addition, they shot down my monitoring drone. For this reason, I believe they are hostile.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Princeton META：</span><br>
Wait, they shot it down? But they're your fellow ANTI-X... It must have been some kind of mistake.<br>
...Huh? A call from Ms. Silver Fox?<br>
...Okay. Got it.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Constellation：</span><br>
What did she say?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Princeton META：</span><br>
Those "Sirens" are not our allies.<br>
She said, "stand back and let them and the corrosion entities fight each other, then finish off what remains."<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Constellation：</span><br>
Hang on, did she refer to them as "Sirens"?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Princeton META：</span><br>
That she did. Probably so it would be easier for you to follow.<br>
Also, she said that we're allowed to fight back if they attack us.<br>
...I admire her swift decision-making skills.<br>
Sorry, I'm getting sidetracked. Let's change positions and watch the battle from afar.<br>
{{折叠面板|内容结束}}

{{折叠面板|标题=Wrong Destination|选项=29|主框=1|样式=primary|展开=是}}
<br>
The battle between the Sirens and the corrosion entities unfolded as predicted.<br>
The shipgirls had already left the combat area, monitoring for developments with their aircraft from relative safety.<br>
The storm died down, and the Enforcers and their warships had suffered serious casualties.<br>
It was the perfect opportunity for the girls to swoop in and quickly crush what remained of the enemy.<br>
Time elapsed since the storm manifested: 1 hour, 20 minutes.<br>
After the fighting was over...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Princeton META：</span><br>
Hmm... This doesn't feel right.<br>
I don't expect a storm to leave a wreckage, but why didn't the Sirens when they're so similar to the ANTI-X?<br>
There's practically nothing left to salvage even after all that fighting.<br>
I hope that floating island has something worth our while.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">War Protocol Fortress：</span><br>
Let us gather supplies while we're there.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Princeton META：</span><br>
Of course. It's time to fill our warehouse to the brim.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Constellation：</span><br>
I've never heard of someone stealing supplies from the Sirens before.<br>
Is it common practice to procure items locally in your branch?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Princeton META：</span><br>
Yeah. Don't want useful resources to go to waste. You can extend your fleet's operational lifespan by several years if you get lucky.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Guam：</span><br>
Sheesh... Fortress rivals an Arbiter in strength when she gets serious.<br>
In retrospect, I'm really grateful you went easy on us earlier.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Princeton META：</span><br>
Yeah, she means business. The whole Task Force does.<br>
And so does every other one. Our Task Forces are the best of the best in our world.<br>
If we didn't pack this much heat, we wouldn't still be around.<br>
Having said that, I think even your world's fleets could handle these guys without too much difficulty.<br>
Anyway... Fortress, are you certain those enemies employ the same technology as the ANTI-X?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">War Protocol Fortress：</span><br>
Yes. These so-called Enforcers have designs, weaponry, and tactics markedly similar to the ANTI-X.<br>
Based on the presence of modules more advanced than mine, I theorize that the units above them – "Arbiters" – are newer models than I.<br>
However, I should state that these Enforcers do not appear to be frontline units.<br>
Their firepower configuration suggests that they are most likely logistics or facility defense units.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Guam：</span><br>
So we basically wiped out a support fleet?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Princeton META：</span><br>
Sounds like it. Considering the state of this place, that floating artificial island is likely their supply base.<br>
It would explain why they weren't so tough.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Guam：</span><br>
You say that, but it's always a headache when WE have to deal with Enforcers.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Princeton META：</span><br>
Fair enough. Also, there's one thing I've been wondering about...<br>
Is something wrong with your weapons? They're not as powerful as I expected them to be.<br>
I didn't notice it during your battle with Fortress, since you were both holding back. This time you weren't, though, and I couldn't help but notice.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Laffey II：</span><br>
*staaaaare*...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Princeton META：</span><br>
Hey, I'm not saying you're weak! Just that I thought you'd be stronger.<br>
Maybe your hulls have taken damage? I could see how that would lead to a drop in power.<br>
Would you mind if Fortress scanned you real quick?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Guam：</span><br>
Our hulls might've been damaged...?<br>
Scan us! Please!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Princeton META：</span><br>
Great. Fortress, do your thing.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">War Protocol Fortress：</span><br>
Orders received. Commencing scan.<br>
<br>
Sometime later...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Princeton META：</span><br>
Nope, they're in perfect condition... That leaves only one other explanation.<br>
There may be something limiting your Wisdom Cubes.<br>
You can't modify a Cube like that after it has formed a hull, so it had to be done before then...<br>
Hmm. Yeah, I think someone put a limiter on your Cubes before your hulls were created.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Constellation：</span><br>
Huh? Someone tampered with our Cubes?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Princeton META：</span><br>
Yes. The signs are there, even if I don't know how exactly they did it.<br>
One reason why they might have put a limiter in place is that it improves the Cube's stability.<br>
That has the benefit of slowing down METAmorphosis to a crawl as long as your hull doesn't get damaged and you don't suffer external corrosion.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Guam：</span><br>
It sounds less like a limiter and more like a safety feature.<br>
Because, you know, isn't not turning META a good thing?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Princeton META：</span><br>
Well, generally, it is.<br>
Limiting your combat ability just to avoid METAmorphosis is putting the cart before the horse, though.<br>
How are shipgirls supposed to fight X when they don't have the strength to do it?<br>
It's pointless to have a limiter if the enemy just sinks you before you even turn META.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Constellation：</span><br>
I can understand wanting more power, but I'd think twice if it costs my sanity.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Princeton META：</span><br>
That's reasonable. I've seen what METAmorphosis does to people.<br>
Nobody wants to turn out like them. Not me, either.<br>
Obviously, we have reservations about letting corrosion seep into our hulls, but there is a way to manage it.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Constellation：</span><br>
You're saying there's a way to reverse the corrosion?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Princeton META：</span><br>
No, but I know the next best thing.<br>
See, I have a device that allows me to stop my hull's corrosion at the surface level.<br>
Then after I'm done fighting, I purge that corrosion and my hull returns to its pre-transformation state.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Guam：</span><br>
Oh, oh! It's like a superhero costume you put on and take off!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Princeton META：</span><br>
Uhh... I don't quite get the analogy, but I'll assume it's close enough.<br>
The takeaway is this: X's corrosion isn't natural, but your hull changing is. You don't need to be deathly afraid of it.<br>
You still need to be wary of not going past the critical point, because that's when you risk becoming mentally unstable.<br>
If that happens, all you can do is hope your friends will give you intensive medical care and try to do everything possible to save you.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Laffey II：</span><br>
Sounds frightening...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Princeton META：</span><br>
It is. It's probably why they put limiters on your Cubes in the first place – to make absolutely sure it doesn't happen.<br>
In fact, they went even further with your Type II rigging, Laffey. It effectively erases the corrosion pathway, meaning you can't undergo METAmorphosis even if you wanted to.<br>
(I'm more surprised that the Type II rigging has already been completed. The project was only at its infancy when...)<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Laffey II：</span><br>
Good to know.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Constellation：</span><br>
Is there any way to remove the limiters on our Cubes?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Guam：</span><br>
Whoa, whoa, you're not seriously considering it, are you?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Constellation：</span><br>
I'm not. I'm just asking out of curiosity.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Princeton META：</span><br>
I honestly don't know. Modifying an existing hull takes an immense amount of work.<br>
Fortress would have to run some analyses to find you an answer.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">War Protocol Fortress：</span><br>
My system resources are occupied by other tasks at the moment. Shall I reallocate them?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Princeton META：</span><br>
No. Focus on your current tasks. Analyzing the beacon, searching for your missing person, recovering supplies, repairing the fleet...<br>
Sorry, but we've got our hands tied, Constellation. Ask again later.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Constellation：</span><br>
Okay...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Princeton META：</span><br>
Ah, right. I forgot to mention one important thing.<br>
Ms. Silver Fox wants to give you all the Council's Unity Medal!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Guam：</span><br>
A medal? For what?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Princeton META：</span><br>
For helping us during this operation! We are truly grateful for it.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Guam：</span><br>
I mean, we didn't really do much. Hell, we did more harm than good to your warships in particular.<br>
Do we really deserve a medal for that?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Princeton META：</span><br>
You also recovered one of the Council's beacons and assisted us in combat. Come on, you've earned it.<br>
By the way, would you like a physical medal or an e-medal?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Guam：</span><br>
An... e-medal?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Princeton META：</span><br>
Yes? Oh, I guess you don't have those yet. Physical it is, then.<br>
I like the physical ones better, too.<br>
Let me just tell the 3D printer to get on that... There. We'll hand it to you at the base once it's done.<br>
You can go back early if you'd like. I'll take the fleet and patrol the area for a while.<br>
Besides, you still have your "quiz" to do, don't you?<br>
{{折叠面板|内容结束}}

{{折叠面板|标题=Six Questions|选项=30|主框=1|样式=primary|展开=是}}
<br>
After the battle, the gang returned to the temporary base.<br>
As promised, Silver Fox did not show up in person. Instead, Fortress was used to relay messages back and forth between them.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Silver Fox：</span><br>
On behalf of the Council, I would like to thank you all for your valiant fighting during today's battle.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Constellation：</span><br>
We've done nothing that you should thank us for.<br>
All we did was help the flying fleet destroy the corrosion entities. We hardly played a major role.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Silver Fox：</span><br>
Don't be so modest. Big or small, we value all assistance.<br>
I learned a proverb when I visited the Dragon Empery: "Every grain of dirt makes a mountain, and every drop of rain erodes stone."<br>
The Council's Unity Medal was made to appreciate such efforts.<br>
Now, regarding that quiz you mentioned. Have you already thought of questions you'd like to ask?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Constellation：</span><br>
Yes. We're all ready.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Silver Fox：</span><br>
Good. Heehee, I wonder what kind of exciting questions you'll ask me?<br>
Go on, Constellation. You may begin.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Constellation：</span><br>
Okay, Ms... Silver Fox, I'd like to start off strong.<br>
Why does the Council's fleet float above the water?<br>
Making a fleet hover above rather than ride on the water must consume considerable energy.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Silver Fox：</span><br>
Yes, you're right. Making ships levitate does take a toll on one's energy stores.<br>
However, our fleet is powered by Energy Cubes, so a shortage of power is the least of our concerns.<br>
As for why we actively choose to make them levitate, that's simply because travel ON the water is dangerous.<br>
In practice, traveling on the water leads to far greater losses than taking the extra effort to fly.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Constellation：</span><br>
Is the reason for that related to the X...?<br>
.........<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Silver Fox：</span><br>
...Hm?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Constellation：</span><br>
(No freebie questions, I guess...)<br>
Ahem. Okay, second question.<br>
What exactly is the Council, as an organization?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Silver Fox：</span><br>
I thought that would be your first question.<br>
And I think I'd be glad to answer that for you.<br>
It's a cross-faction organization formed to pool all of the resources of humanity toward fighting the X. Its full name is the United Council.<br>
A real political entity with real power that crosses factional borders. You could liken it to the Global Consortium, but stronger.<br>
Its authority and resources far outstrip any other international entity. Likewise does its military, of course.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Constellation：</span><br>
...Global Consortium? International entities...? Is it similar to the Azur Lane, then?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Silver Fox：</span><br>
Would that be your third question?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Constellation：</span><br>
Oh, no... Sorry, I was asking offhandedly. That isn't my third question.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Silver Fox：</span><br>
I'll take that to mean that I don't need to answer it, then. Next question, please.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Constellation：</span><br>
(Asking offhandedly in the course of a conversation doesn't work, either. She won't let me through that easily...)<br>
(Okay. I'll try asking something more pointed this time.)<br>
I'm ready to ask my third question now.<br>
The term "X" has been thrown around a lot. What does it mean?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Silver Fox：</span><br>
At a press conference, one might call them... a particular hostile lifeform.<br>
But I imagine that answer doesn't satisfy you. As we're providing each other with information, allow me to give you a kinder answer.<br>
If the name X does not mean anything to you, then presumably, such an entity has not yet been observed in your branch.<br>
As such, it would be best if you didn't know much about them yet. Knowing too much can be dangerous, and that isn't a threat.<br>
My official answer is... I can't comment on that.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Constellation：</span><br>
What about the Antiochus, or ANTI-X, then?<br>
We know that they are weapons built to fight against X, but what exactly are they?<br>
This is officially my fourth question<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Silver Fox：</span><br>
Hmm...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Constellation：</span><br>
You're not going to brush this one off too, are you?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Silver Fox：</span><br>
No; telling you should be fine in itself. But the ANTI-X is a plan of such large scale that it's difficult to answer in few words.<br>
Hmm... "Artificial Navy Transformational Intelligence, Class X," or ANTI-X for short, is a weapon devised to deal with unknown threats.<br>
The guiding principle behind it is to maintain combat capabilities for as long as possible – regardless of casualties or environment.<br>
As an autonomous weapon, the humanoid and mass-produced ship units are powered by Energy Cube arrays.<br>
There also exist multiple command units, each controlled by artificial intelligence with separate artificial personalities in order to support the division of labor.<br>
...That product of an arms race against a totally unknown enemy ended up finding use in fighting against the X.<br>
Heh. I don't know whether to call it lucky or unlucky...<br>
Will that answer suffice?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Constellation：</span><br>
Yes. You've offered more information than expected. Thank you.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Silver Fox：</span><br>
Then your next question, please.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Constellation：</span><br>
(The floating fleet, the Council, the Antiochus... So far, Ms. Silver Fox has answered three of my four questions.)<br>
(That must mean that she has as many questions for us.)<br>
(I have two more questions. Let's get to the hard ones...)<br>
Thank you for answering my questions so far. On to the fifth.<br>
Why have you come here?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Silver Fox：</span><br>
No comment.<br>
I see what you're doing, asking uncomfortable questions that I can't answer. You don't want me to get all six of my questions, do you?<br>
You've got a good head on your shoulders. Just what I'd expect from Lexington's little sister.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Constellation：</span><br>
(...Hm? Why did she bring up Lexington?)<br>
(That's it. They know about Type II rigging. Maybe their Lexington...)<br>
(No, no... That question alone wouldn't possibly yield the information I need.)<br>
(Besides, whether Lexington has Type II rigging in their branch or not...)<br>
(It would be meaningless if she just answered yes to that question. And what would I do if she said no?)<br>
(Would I tell them about my Lexington and ask for help? But then...)<br>
(Calm down, Constellation... This is all part of her scheme. Just ask the questions we all agreed on!)<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Silver Fox：</span><br>
This is your last question, so think carefully about it, little girl.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Constellation：</span><br>
(She's answered three questions so far. We at least have minimal results.)<br>
(It's obvious that she will answer some questions, but I doubt she will if I ask something even more pointed...)<br>
(As planned, I'll ask her the thing I'm the most curious about...)<br>
Who are you?<br>
That is our final question.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">War Protocol Fortress：</span><br>
Answer: I am the Council fleet's AI, War Protocol Fortress.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Constellation：</span><br>
...Huh?<br>
Why did you answer?!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Silver Fox：</span><br>
Heehee. I promise we're not lying or brushing off your question.<br>
You've been asking Fortress all of these questions, so of course, Fortress answered.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Constellation：</span><br>
Tch... Must you be so difficult at the very end?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Silver Fox：</span><br>
The floating fleet, the Council, the ANTI-X, and Fortress. We've answered four of your questions.<br>
That means you will have to answer four of mine. Such are the rules, no?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Constellation：</span><br>
Yes...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Silver Fox：</span><br>
Then it's my turn now. Are you ready, Lexington's little sister?<br>
{{折叠面板|内容结束}}

{{折叠面板|标题=Six Questions - Part Two|选项=31|主框=1|样式=primary|展开=是}}
<br>
The two-sided quiz between the shipgirls and Silver Fox entered its second phase.<br>
As per the rules Guam came up with, it was now Constellation's turn to answer Silver Fox's questions.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Constellation：</span><br>
...Okay, let us hear your questions.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Silver Fox：</span><br>
Certainly. My first question is this...<br>
Do you know what the moon's soil consists of?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Constellation：</span><br>
Huh? No, I have no idea.<br>
I really hope that one day humanity will explore the stars.<br>
But, even if we had the technology to do it today, who knows when we'll actually make our first voyage into space.<br>
Almost all our resources go toward fighting the Sirens, so...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Silver Fox：</span><br>
Didn't you say that you're from a base called the "Sea of Stars," though?<br>
That's an... odd naming choice for a civilization that has yet to travel to the stars.<br>
Second question.<br>
What kind of place is the Sea of Stars?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Constellation：</span><br>
I don't have the clearance to tell you that. Everything in the Sea of Stars is top secret.<br>
...In hindsight, I shouldn't even have disclosed its name to you.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Guam：</span><br>
Wait, really?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Constellation：</span><br>
Yes. We are not supposed to even mention it to outsiders.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Silver Fox：</span><br>
Should I interpret your answer as, "no comment"?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Constellation：</span><br>
I'm afraid so. I really cannot answer it.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Silver Fox：</span><br>
Don't worry about it. Third question.<br>
Where did your Wisdom Cubes come from?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Constellation：</span><br>
I can't answer that.<br>
Wisdom Cubes are a scientific miracle, developed with all of humanity's scientific knowledge sometime after the Azur Lane was established.<br>
In our war against the Sirens, they also were the tipping point for things to swing in humanity's favor.<br>
We KAN-SEN are born from Cubes, and we use their power to fight the Sirens.<br>
I believe our world's governments possess the knowledge of how to make Cubes, but their production requires an exceedingly rare mineral.<br>
As a result, only a small limited number of them have been made.<br>
That is everything I know.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Silver Fox：</span><br>
They require a rare mineral and not many have been produced... Interesting.<br>
Very well. Next question.<br>
How would you describe the Sirens' organizational structure?<br>
If that's hard to answer, you can just describe what kinds of Sirens you've fought.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Constellation：</span><br>
It's difficult to summarize. Do you mind if Guam answers for me?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Silver Fox：</span><br>
Not at all. Go ahead.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Guam：</span><br>
Roger-dodger! Guam is here live to bring you the truth and the facts about the Sirens!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Constellation：</span><br>
Leave your eccentricity at the door, please.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Guam：</span><br>
Ugh. Fiiine.<br>
Ahem. The Sirens' most basic units are different kinds of warships, imitations of other shipgirls, called Pawns, and humanoid low-level combat units.<br>
Above those, there are the elite Sirens who possess self-awareness.<br>
Examples include Purifier, Tester, Omitter, Compiler, and Observer, among others.<br>
They each have different fighting styles and equipment.<br>
Oh, and we've already destroyed Compiler's mainframe, so she's out of the picture!<br>
Above even the elite Sirens there are the elusive Arbiters and the Enforcers they control.<br>
You should've gotten a gauge on the Enforcers' strength in the battle earlier.<br>
Arbiters are a tough fight even when they don't occupy their vessels, but when they do, they pose a serious challenge even versus an entire fleet.<br>
They inflict heavy casualties even if you do beat them. And if you don't... well, you can probably guess.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Silver Fox：</span><br>
Heehee. I see. Moving on to the next question.<br>
Have you heard of Project Dawn?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Guam：</span><br>
Umm... Project Dawn?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Constellation：</span><br>
I'll answer this one, Guam.<br>
(She's asked four questions about the moon's soil, the Sea of Stars, Wisdom Cubes, and the Sirens. We've answered three of them.)<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Silver Fox：</span><br>
Should I interpret your answer as, "no comment"?<br>
If you do not answer it, you will have no choice but to answer the next one.<br>
If you're trying to fool me to get around the question, I fear that it won't work so well in your case.<br>
You're a kind, honest girl, and deceit is not your strong suit. This indecision is an act you're putting on to buy time...<br>
It's not easy to outfox a fox, is it?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Constellation：</span><br>
("Project Dawn"... I assume she's referring to those documents the Commander retrieved from the Northern Parliament by the same name...)<br>
...Whoever came up with your codename is a very clever person.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Silver Fox：</span><br>
Heehee. I'll be sure to forward your compliment to them.<br>
Hey, relax. I swear on my position on the Council that my next question isn't so bad.<br>
Don't overthink it. Just answer how your heart tells you.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Constellation：</span><br>
...No comment, then.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Silver Fox：</span><br>
Question number six it is, then. It's also the final question.<br>
You've answered three of my questions thus far, so you cannot pass on this last one.<br>
I promised I wouldn't be mean with it, but you also have to answer it no matter what... Heehee. Let me mull it over for a moment.<br>
<br>
Constellation could not believe her ears.<br>
Silver Fox had been so calm and composed, and now a worrying tremble ran through her words.<br>
Indeed, her voice sounded like she was trying and failing to mask her excitement.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Constellation：</span><br>
(Something tells me her all other questions were only setting the stage... This is the one she REALLY wanted to ask.)<br>
I'll... answer your question as best as I can, Miss.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Silver Fox：</span><br>
Okay, little girl. Here is my final question.<br>
How are things in Sverdlovsk?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Constellation：</span><br>
...What?<br>
<br>
Constellation imagined dozens of questions, dozens of motives, dozens of answers. None of them prepared her for this last question.<br>
It felt so off the cuff she couldn't help but flinch.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Constellation：</span><br>
Uhh... That's a place in the Northern Parliament, right?<br>
Sorry, but I know next to nothing about their geography.<br>
I don't know where it is, much less the latest goings-on there...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Silver Fox：</span><br>
I see...<br>
<br>
Even through the compression, Constellation could deeply feel the disappointment and sadness in Silver Fox's voice.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Constellation：</span><br>
...Say, is that place where you come from?<br>
Then let's say that one didn't count. Ask another question.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Silver Fox：</span><br>
...Little girl, your world's secrets are in the balance here. It's unwise to be so generous.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Constellation：</span><br>
No, it's fine. This is just a little quiz between us.<br>
You should be able to bend the rules slightly for everyone to get something out of it.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Silver Fox：</span><br>
Well, if you're certain. Then I'll ask something else.<br>
<br>
The sound coming from the communicator cut off for a moment.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Silver Fox：</span><br>
...I've come up with a new question. Here goes.<br>
Is Aoste still doing well?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Constellation：</span><br>
...Aoste? Who?<br>
Sorry, I've never heard that name before.<br>
This one doesn't count either. Ask another one!<br>
<br>
Constellation waited... and waited... and waited, but there was no response from the communicator.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Constellation：</span><br>
...Hello? Ms. Silver Fox?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Princeton META：</span><br>
Hey, everyone. I've brought your medal.<br>
And I have some good news, too!<br>
Sorry if I'm interrupting. Is the quiz over already?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Constellation：</span><br>
Well...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Silver Fox：</span><br>
We're done. What good news do you bring, Princeton?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Princeton META：</span><br>
The beacon – it's been repaired.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">War Protocol Fortress：</span><br>
Someone had meddled with its memory banks and injected malware.<br>
Luckily, it has been removed. All that remains is to activate the beacon and extract all the data logs inside.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Guam：</span><br>
Great! If that little bugger is the reason we got sent here, it should contain some clue that'll help us get home again!<br>
What are we waiting for? Let's power it up!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Princeton META：</span><br>
Shall I, Ms. Silver Fox?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Silver Fox：</span><br>
Yes. Start it.<br>
<br>
With Silver Fox's permission, Princeton put her finger on the beacon's power button.<br>
She gave it a gentle press, and...<br>
Just like that, everything and everyone was gone.<br>
The Council's fleet, the ruined sea, Fortress, the other Princeton...<br>
Even their surroundings vanished, and in their place, a familiar sight.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">San Jacinto：</span><br>
Isn't this the Coral Sea simulation?<br>
Are we... back?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Louisville：</span><br>
What just happened? Their whole fleet vanished in the twinkle of an eye...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Constellation：</span><br>
That beacon probably had something to do with it.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Laffey II：</span><br>
I've found Princeton...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Guam：</span><br>
Which one?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Flasher：</span><br>
Ours, Guam! She's over there... unconscious... Waaahhhh!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Guam：</span><br>
Princeton! Talk to us!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Princeton：</span><br>
Zzz... Saratoga... Alaska... Commander... You shouldn't have prepared such a big welcoming party just for me...<br>
Heehee... Zzz...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Constellation：</span><br>
Thank goodness. She's just asleep.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Guam：</span><br>
And having pretty sweet dreams, from the sound of it.<br>
Poor girl isn't gonna like reality when she wakes up, though. No Saratoga and no Commander.<br>
But a party? We can make that happen! Let her sleep while we make all the arrangements!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Constellation：</span><br>
(She's asked four questions about the moon's soil, the Sea of Stars, Wisdom Cubes, and the Sirens. We've answered three of them.)<br>
I feel bad that I couldn't answer her final question...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Guam：</span><br>
Don't sweat it. I'm sure her data is somewhere among our simulations. You can answer it the next time you meet.<br>
When the people want a second season you can bet there'll be one. It's the same with this.<br>
Plus, my gut tells me we will see each other again!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Constellation：</span><br>
...Let's hope so.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Communicator：</span><br>
BEEP BEEP!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">TB ：</span><br>
This is TB. I have picked up your signals.<br>
Report your current status. My readings indicate that you are in the Coral Sea simulation once again. Please confirm.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Guam：</span><br>
Yeah, we're here and we're fine! We'll explain everything that happened later!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Laffey II：</span><br>
I'm so tired... You do the explaining this time, Guam...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Guam：</span><br>
Ahahah, alrighty then. TB, what happened on your end?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">TB ：</span><br>
There was a hostile program among the data salvaged. It has been removed. The Galactic Core is back to operating as normal.<br>
Initiating simulation exit sequence now.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Guam：</span><br>
Finally! Did you hear that? We're going home!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Constellation：</span><br>
Mhm. I need a long nap when I get back.<br>
For once, I might just spend the night sleeping instead of stargazing... *yaaawn*...<br>
<br>
Somewhere, in an unknown location...<br>
<span style="color:#ffc960;">???：</span><br>
...The light of a beacon.<br>
I was too late...<br>

<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Anchorage：</span><br>
Oh! You're back!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Guam：</span><br>
In one piece, too, baby!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">San Jacinto：</span><br>
Did you and TB manage the crisis from the control room?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Anchorage：</span><br>
Yeah!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">TB ：</span><br>
Anchorage's hard work helped me deal with the incident swiftly.<br>
Well done. That is worth a gold star.<br>
Analyzing the data that has been salvaged is going to take time.<br>
Once it has been verified to be completely safe, it will be sent to the Testing Department.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Constellation：</span><br>
Alright. Thanks.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Guam：</span><br>
Wait, when did we salvage data? That beacon disappeared before we could analyze it.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Constellation：</span><br>
Flasher and I did it.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Flasher：</span><br>
Yup. Stella and I were marking important targets and gathering data as we went!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Guam：</span><br>
What happened to the rule about no photography or filming?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Constellation：</span><br>
The rule only applies to those two. Data salvaging is perfectly fine.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">TB ：</span><br>
Someone will need to file a report detailing the events of what transpired.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Constellation：</span><br>
Oh, right. I'd almost forgotten.<br>
Mmgh... I can't do it. I've been up for too long... Zzz...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">San Jacinto：</span><br>
Well, she's out, so I suppose I'll have to write the analysis report.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Princeton ：</span><br>
It pains me to say that I passed out halfway through the mission...<br>
I missed everything that happened in that purified sea...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Guam：</span><br>
Then Flasher and Laffey are gonna have to– Uh, where did they go?<br>
They bailed! Don't tell me I have to write that mission report?!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Constellation：</span><br>
You can do it... Zzz...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Guam：</span><br>
NOOOOOOOO!<br>

Iris Orthodoxy - Holy Capital<br>
Azur Lane Temporary Command Center<br>
I check my inbox and see a mail from the Sea of Stars. It's an accident report.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
"Accident" could mean anything... I hope it was nothing too bad.<br>
...During a data salvage operation, three teams were transported to an unknown simulation, where we encountered an organization called "the Council."<br>
That emblem... I'm pretty sure I saw it in the Arcana Sanctum with Belorussiya.<br>
So that facility must have been one of theirs.<br>
...Their leader went by the codename "Silver Fox" and knew who Dr. Aoste was.<br>
Interesting. I wonder if both Anzeel and Aoste were fellow members of this "Council."<br>
Since they clearly knew me when we spoke, I might also have been a member.<br>
...A lone Antiochus specimen named "War Protocol Fortress."<br>
That's a new model of Siren – or should I say, Antiochus.<br>
Wisdom Cube limiters, a way to control METAmorphosis...<br>
......<br>
Nope, no pieces are falling into place in my head.<br>
I suppose new information won't always trigger flashbacks like I've had before.<br>
Come to think of it, the flashbacks have always happened when I'm in a Mirror Sea or in one of the Sea of Stars' simulations...<br>
They were even more frequent when I was hooked up to the Reality Lens...<br>
Up next, the question the Devil raised... "Where are the Sea of Stars' simulations?"<br>
It is odd, and to the best of my knowledge, the Galactic Core didn't malfunction.<br>
The existence of this "Council" and their mysterious fleet... might be the key to everything.<br>
Ideally, I'd like to speak with them face to face.<br>
If I ever do, I'm going to ask them how that beacon came to be infected with abnormal data.<br>
Finally, there's the black tornado, or what they called a "corrosion phenomenon." The Northern Parliament and Royal Navy have both reported similar sightings.<br>
...That beacon cannot be allowed to be restored. We'll halt the remaining simulations.<br>
It's time to shift our focus to developing Type II riggings. We've gathered more than enough testing data to do it.<br>

<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Queen Elizabeth：</span><br>
I've received a report summary from my servant through my private channel. There is no risk of Naval HQ finding out, so you should read it too.<br>
<span style="color:#ffc960;">Queen Elizabeth META：</span><br>
My word... They encountered a corrosion phenomenon in the Sea of Stars?<br>
This means our prediction has come true. The corrosion has reached your branch now.<br>
Thank goodness your servant is so communicative and willing to share confidential matters with you.<br>
Unlike a certain someone who refuses to share much of anything.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Queen Elizabeth：</span><br>
Shut up. To mock me is to mock yourself. We both know that knowing too much is not a good thing.<br>
I've had it. Renovate these remaining areas yourself.<br>
I don't know what to do with them, and it's you who's going to use them anyway.<br>
<span style="color:#ffc960;">Queen Elizabeth META：</span><br>
Heehee. Fine.<br>
But they won't be done in a day, and there's one more important thing we have to do.<br>
What do you say we have a picnic, hmm?<br>
It's time we introduced Ms. D to you, and a little outing is a great way to do it.<br>

Somewhere, in the Northern Parliament...<br>
Sovetsky Soyuz lay silently on a machine at the center of a large chamber.<br>
Her rigging was stripped down to its base, its shark-like heads having been detached along with all removable auxiliary weapons.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Sovetsky Soyuz：</span><br>
Soobrazitelny, Chkalov, what are the test results?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Chkalov：</span><br>
...The same, in the end. Damage present, cause unknown.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Soobrazitelny：</span><br>
I was so sure it was going to succeed this time...<br>
There were no issues whatsoever during testing, yet here we are. It boggles my genius mind!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Chkalov：</span><br>
Hmm. You did directly engage Gazers during the World Expo incident, Comrade Soyuz.<br>
They must've inflicted unrepairable damage to you, just like long ago.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Soobrazitelny：</span><br>
Alternatively, you were born with a limitation on your hull. A limitation even I am unable to identify.<br>
Whatever it is, I think it renders you incapable of using a new rigging. You are stuck with your old one.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Chkalov：</span><br>
I think Ms. Mechanic here is onto something, even if there's nothing to support her theory.<br>
Without knowing the root of the issue, there's nothing we can do. I say we instead focus on improving the material of your weaponry.<br>
Let's hope the research team in the Antarctic will have a breakthrough.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Sovetsky Soyuz：</span><br>
I trust you with the research side of things.<br>
At the very least, I'll be able to weather the stress of regular combat with these new modifications.<br>
Proceed with the proposal.<br>
The world is in a precarious situation and I need to regain my fighting ability as soon as possible.<br>

<br>
Location unknown - Outer defensive line<br>
This was the outer perimeter, where the Lovers and the Empress had erected a defensive line against X's impending assault.<br>
Countless interceptor weapons filled the sky, accompanied by floating fortresses as far as the eye could see.<br>
From land, to sea, to even the heavens, a curtain of steel rose high.<br>
It was like a hive of epic proportions, ANTI-X's fleets moving to and fro between defensive structures like worker bees.<br>
There were humanoid units on patrol, warships of every size, massive ships for moving cargo, swarms of drones and unmanned aircraft...<br>
This massive orchestra with guns in place of instruments was conducted silently by one girl, her skin pale and her eyes emotionless.<br>
Reflected in those eyes was a horizon, and a dark audience. Her gaze was unflinchingly focused on it.<br>
<span style="color:#bdbdbd;">Bon Homme Richard：</span><br>
Ahah! It's been a while since you brought out the good stuff, ANTI-X.<br>
Is this all for little old me?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Arbiter: The Lovers VI：</span><br>
...Category V threat approaching. Response: Eliminate.<br>
<span style="color:#bdbdbd;">Bon Homme Richard：</span><br>
Aww. I wanted to reminisce for a bit first.<br>
Come on. Didn't you see the light from that beacon?<br>
I did. It reminded me of the old days.<br>
I sent a few gifts. What about you?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Arbiter: The Lovers VI：</span><br>
...That has already been dealt with.<br>
Your battle is here. With me.<br>
<span style="color:#bdbdbd;">Bon Homme Richard：</span><br>
And with you, no less! I don't think I've had the pleasure before. You must be very confident in yourself.<br>
Let me guess – your plan is to hold out as long as possible, hoping you'll win a battle of attrition. Am I right?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Arbiter: The Lovers VI：</span><br>
......<br>
<span style="color:#bdbdbd;">Bon Homme Richard：</span><br>
Heheh. I've got a fun fact for you.<br>
I'm actually very, very patient.<br>
