<br>
Taking Shelter at Capacitor City<br>
After a trip to the garden center, Zeven and I walk down the main street together.<br>
I'm holding potted plants that I can't even name, and she's carrying a bag of newly sprouting saplings.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">De Zeven Provinciën：</span><br>
Thank you so much for coming with me today, Commander!<br>
In exchange for your company, you should let me give you a massage later.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Hmm... I like the sound of that.<br>
But first things first. We need to get these babies home.<br>
(There aren't too many of them, but boy, are they heavy...)<br>
<br>
As I adjust my posture to try and make the potted plants easier to carry, a drop of water hits my cheek.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Mm?<br>
<br>
Zeven looks up at the sky, too.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">De Zeven Provinciën：</span><br>
Huh?<br>
Is it raining?<br>
But it was so sunny just a few minutes ago.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Sure was. Well, the forecasters can't get it right every time.<br>
Let's hurry back before it gets really bad.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">De Zeven Provinciën：</span><br>
Good idea. In that case...<br>
Let's run, Commander!<br>
<br>
She wraps her arm around mine and starts running.<br>
However, the weather seems to anticipate our plans, and the rain only intensifies.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">De Zeven Provinciën：</span><br>
Eep?! It's pouring now!<br>
<br>
Zeven stays close, trying to stay out of the rain as we quicken our pace.<br>
This doesn't stop her from getting wet alongside me, of course, as the rain comes down harder. Our hair and shoulders are drenched.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
At this rate, we'll be completely soaked by the time we get back.<br>
<br>
I look around and spot a store down the street that we can use to take shelter.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Let's go wait out the rain in there!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">De Zeven Provinciën：</span><br>
Huh? O-okay!<br>
<br>
We run inside together. In our haste, we don't bother to check the name of the store.<br>
As we go in, we hear a store announcement.<br>
"Capacitor City's having its biggest sale ever! Get up to 70% off on all products in the store! You might just win a prize at checkout, too!"<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
(Wait a second...)<br>
(We're in an electronics store?!)<br>
<br>
Feeling a pang of unease, I glance at the girl next to me.<br>
She sets her bag of saplings down, as if she hasn't realized where we are.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">De Zeven Provinciën：</span><br>
Ah, Commander... Your whole upper half is soaked. Let me clean you up a little.<br>
<br>
She pulls a handkerchief out of her pocket and gently begins to dry my hair.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">De Zeven Provinciën：</span><br>
Even poor plants get sick when they take this much rain water at once...<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Umm, I'll be fine...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">De Zeven Provinciën：</span><br>
Commander, you look pale. You're not sick already, are you?<br>
I'll go find hot water for you!<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
That won't be necessary!<br>
<br>
I reach out frantically and seize her arm.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Stay with me. Don't go anywhere, I'm serious.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">De Zeven Provinciën：</span><br>
Um...?<br>
<br>
Zeven tilts her head at me, but it doesn't take her long to give herself a reason to be fine with it.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">De Zeven Provinciën：</span><br>
O-oh, I see... We finally got the time to go out together, and it makes sense for us to stay together on our date...<br>
Don't worry, Commander. I won't leave your side for a second!<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Good... Thanks, Zeven.<br>

<br>
Automatic Sprinkler<br>
The rain still shows no sign of stopping.<br>
Zeven and I sit down on a bench together and place our newly bought plants at our feet.<br>
As the torrential rain drowns out the store's ambient music, she rests her head on my shoulder sleepily.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
(They've really got the AC blasting... She might catch a cold if she falls asleep here.)<br>
<br>
I take off my jacket and drape it over her shoulders.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">De Zeven Provinciën：</span><br>
Commander, you're too thoughtful...<br>
<br>
She mumbles in my ear. I stroke her hair while she falls asleep.<br>
As I start to foolishly think that we'll make it through this without issue, a few small drops of water fall on our heads.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">De Zeven Provinciën：</span><br>
Oh? A leak...?<br>
<br>
We look up at the ceiling simultaneously, but we quickly find that the water isn't falling from overhead.<br>
There's a display nearby with a shower-shaped sprinkler watering a miniature garden.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">De Zeven Provinciën：</span><br>
Look, Commander! There are so many plants over there!<br>
<br>
Zeven drags me over to the display area. A card in front of the product lists its name and description.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">De Zeven Provinciën：</span><br>
"Are you a hard worker who loves plants? Look no further than this sprinkler system! Works up to fifty square meters..."<br>
"With simple operation and easy upkeep, you can rest easy knowing your green babies are in capable hands."<br>
An automatic sprinkler... How interesting.<br>
Commander, is it okay if I try it out?<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
...Go right for it.<br>
<br>
Given her history with handling appliances, I decide to stay close by.<br>
A demonstration is playing, showing how the sprinkler works.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">De Zeven Provinciën：</span><br>
So you press this button first, and then this button... and then it starts watering them?<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Looks like it.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">De Zeven Provinciën：</span><br>
That's so convenient. With a few of these, I could take care of so many more flowers!<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
(She really likes this sprinkler.)<br>
(But if I buy it on impulse right now, it could lead to trouble.)<br>
It's nice, I'll give you that. Operating these things can get tricky, though.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">De Zeven Provinciën：</span><br>
Oh, Commander, you underestimate me. I'll be just fine with something this simple!<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Are you sure?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">De Zeven Provinciën：</span><br>
Yeah!<br>
<br>
She's practically got stars in her eyes.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Well, go ahead and give it a try. If you can make it work, let's buy one.<br>
I'll pay, by the way. We're on a date, so I might as well get you a gift.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">De Zeven Provinciën：</span><br>
Wow, thank you, Commander!<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Go on. Give it a try.<br>
<br>
She looks as confident as can be.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">De Zeven Provinciën：</span><br>
Okay, turning it on...<br>
Watch this, Commander!<br>

Predictable Problems<br>
After making a few tweaks, Zeven presses the start button without hesitation.<br>
I watch on closely.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
(No problems so far.)<br>
(Could I be witnessing a miracle?)<br>
<br>
Water sprays out of the sprinkler and lands safely in the miniature garden.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">De Zeven Provinciën：</span><br>
Look, Commander! I did it!<br>
See? This is easy stuff.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
You've shown real growth today.<br>
Well, a deal's a deal–<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">De Zeven Provinciën：</span><br>
Aaah?!<br>
<br>
As soon as I turn toward checkout, the sprinkler head starts swiveling around in circles.<br>
Water spews everywhere, soaking both of our faces.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">De Zeven Provinciën：</span><br>
Aww... Why did that happen?<br>
Ah, I need to stop it... Where's the stop button?<br>
<br>
She frantically starts pressing buttons on the panel.<br>
It doesn't stop, though, no. The sprinkler only spins faster and faster.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Let me handle this.<br>
<br>
Before she can press another button, I turn off the power.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">De Zeven Provinciën：</span><br>
Hmm...<br>
I followed the instructions exactly as they were shown. It was going so well before, too...<br>
<br>
Disappointment is clear on her face.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Was it just a machine malfunction, maybe?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">De Zeven Provinciën：</span><br>
It's okay, Commander. Don't try to make me feel better...<br>
All I do is cause trouble for you anyway...<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
No, no. I was watching every step of the way, and you clearly did nothing wrong.<br>
I think it would've turned out the same way even if I did it.<br>
<br>
Zeven's hair and eyelashes glisten from wetness.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">De Zeven Provinciën：</span><br>
Commander...<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Maybe you're just so pretty that the sprinkler thought you were a flower.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">De Zeven Provinciën：</span><br>
Pfft...<br>
Goodness, Commander, now isn't the time for jokes...<br>
<br>
That finally brings a smile to her face.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Anyway, let's get cleaned up.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">De Zeven Provinciën：</span><br>
Okay!<br>
<br>
I take out my own handkerchief and dab at her damp hair for her this time.<br>
She lowers her head slightly for me, like a delicate touch-me-not flower.<br>

<br>
Coffee for Your Beloved<br>
I asked for two cups of piping-hot coffee from the service counter to keep us from catching a cold.<br>
The hot coffee in our bellies practically blew all of the cold away.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">De Zeven Provinciën：</span><br>
This coffee is just delicious.<br>
Doesn't it taste exactly like the kind you used to drink?<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Now that you mention it...<br>
(This is the kind that my coffee maker made before she broke it...)<br>
<br>
After finishing her drink, Zeven seems unsatisfied.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">De Zeven Provinciën：</span><br>
I'll go get us refills.<br>
<br>
She takes our empty mugs. Before long, she's back with more.<br>
When she gets back, she's clearly in high spirits.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">De Zeven Provinciën：</span><br>
Commander, I'm baaack!<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Someone's in a good mood. What's the news?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">De Zeven Provinciën：</span><br>
I'm glad you asked! When I went to ask for more coffee, they showed me the machine that made it... It's the newest model of the one you were using!<br>
There's a demo corner right over there. You just press a few buttons, and you get the most delicious-smelling coffee!<br>
"Wake up your beloved with a cup of fragrant, fresh-ground coffee!"<br>
"Even if they work late into the night, you can always bring them a piping-hot cup of java!"<br>
"On our brand's reputation, we swear that with this coffee maker, your beloved's heart will be yours!"<br>
<br>
Zeven repeats what sounds like advertising bunk, losing herself in the fantasy they present.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">De Zeven Provinciën：</span><br>
If I learned how to use that coffee maker, then maybe I...<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Wanna try it?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">De Zeven Provinciën：</span><br>
Commander, I...<br>
<br>
She looks sheepishly up at me, no doubt remembering the disaster moments ago.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">De Zeven Provinciën：</span><br>
I did break your last coffee maker...<br>
What if I mess up again like that? Or like before?<br>
I'd just cause more trouble for you.<br>
<br>
She waits anxiously for my answer.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
It's okay. There's nothing wrong with just trying it out.<br>
Besides, I'll REALLY be watching this time.<br>
I'll test it out first to make sure there's nothing wrong with the machine. Then you can have a try.<br>
This way, surely–<br>
<br>
Before I can finish talking, Zeven suddenly pulls me into a hug.<br>
She smells like flowers.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">De Zeven Provinciën：</span><br>
You really are too kind, Commander.<br>
If this goes well, then let me buy it for you as a gift!<br>
<br>
Thus, she takes my hand and guides me over to the coffee makers.<br>

<br>
The Coffee Trial<br>
Zeven never lets go of my hand until we get to the section with the coffee machines.<br>
That familiar aroma wafts all around us.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">De Zeven Provinciën：</span><br>
Over there, Commander!<br>
Isn't that coffee maker just like the one that was in your office?<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Yep. The appearance is almost the same, and the functions are too.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">De Zeven Provinciën：</span><br>
I thought so! I watched their demonstration a few times, and I'm sure that even people like me can use it just fine!<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
...Riiight.<br>
(I feel like I could've said the same thing about the old one...)<br>
<br>
We watched another demo together.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Got it. I see how to use it now.<br>
Zeven, pay close attention to what I'm doing, alright?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">De Zeven Provinciën：</span><br>
Okay!<br>
If it means making delicious coffee for you someday, then I'll watch so seriously that I won't even blink once!<br>
<br>
She clenches her fists, as if preparing for a life-or-death struggle.<br>
I slow down and break down every step as much as I can for her.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
So? Think you can handle it?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">De Zeven Provinciën：</span><br>
Wow... I finally get it!<br>
That means it's my turn now.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Yep. Good luck.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">De Zeven Provinciën：</span><br>
First... I press the button to grind the beans...<br>
<br>
She imitates what I did and presses the correct button. Ground coffee flows out of the machine.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">De Zeven Provinciën：</span><br>
Next, extraction...<br>
<br>
I notice that she's not just imitating the steps I did, but also my superfluous motions.<br>
The machine makes a hoarse noise as it operates.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">De Zeven Provinciën：</span><br>
It's working! Now, the final step...<br>
<br>
Zeven takes a deep breath in and gently presses a button with her slender finger.<br>
BEEP BEEP!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">De Zeven Provinciën：</span><br>
Aaah!<br>
<br>
When she presses the final button, the machine starts shaking violently and screeching.<br>
Frothed milk splatters all over the place, and black smoke rises from the machine.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">De Zeven Provinciën：</span><br>
C-Commander!<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
It's okay. I'll cut the power!<br>
<br>
I rush to unplug it and look back at my companion.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Zeven, are you okay?<br>
<br>
That malfunction ended up covering her face in milk foam.<br>
Seeing her teary eyes, I frantically wipe the foam off of her.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">De Zeven Provinciën：</span><br>
I-I'm sorry, Commander...<br>
There's milk on you, too... Did you get hurt at all?<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Nope. I'm just fine.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">De Zeven Provinciën：</span><br>
I'm such an idiot...<br>
I thought they were all the same steps... Why?<br>
Why am I the only one... who can't make good coffee?<br>
<br>
She sounds more dejected than I've ever heard her before.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
You were doing all that just so you could brew coffee for me?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">De Zeven Provinciën：</span><br>
Yeah... You're always working so hard. I wanted to find a way that I could help.<br>
All I wanted was this one little thing, but I can't...<br>
I-I just can't...<br>
<br>
Her eyes turn red.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
I understand how you feel.<br>
Wait here for me. I'll go pay for this thing.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">De Zeven Provinciën：</span><br>
Huh? But... But I broke it...<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Don't worry about it. You just leave the rest to me.<br>

One Little Wish<br>
After repairing the coffee maker, I invited Zeven to my room.<br>
She was still down from earlier.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">De Zeven Provinciën：</span><br>
Commander...<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
I fixed and installed the coffee maker. Ready to give it a whirl?<br>
<br>
She shakes her head.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">De Zeven Provinciën：</span><br>
I'd best not. What if, you know...<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Worried the same thing will happen again?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">De Zeven Provinciën：</span><br>
......<br>
<br>
She keeps her mouth closed, but the sadness on her face tells me all I need to know.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
I've got repair tools right here. If it malfunctions again, I'll fix it up, no problem.<br>
Don't worry about a thing. Experiment.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">De Zeven Provinciën：</span><br>
Commander... Thank you for comforting me.<br>
But really, I've already messed up enough times. My mistakes could have gotten you burned.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
You don't have to worry, I promise.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">De Zeven Provinciën：</span><br>
...Eh?<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
I came prepared for anything.<br>
I'll teach you how to use it, and we'll go nice and slow.<br>
Even if you mess up a hundred or a thousand times... I'm not bothered, no matter how long it takes.<br>
<br>
Zeven gazes at me in surprise.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">De Zeven Provinciën：</span><br>
B-but then... I'll just cause trouble for you again...<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Not at all.<br>
If you can make coffee for me, then I'll get to drink your coffee every day. Sounds like a great deal to me.<br>
<br>
We lock eyes, and I gently take her hand.<br>
I give it a soft squeeze to show her how I care.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
I really am looking forward to drinking your coffee.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">De Zeven Provinciën：</span><br>
Commander...<br>
<br>
Encouraged by my words, she finally smiles.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">De Zeven Provinciën：</span><br>
If you really mean it... then I shouldn't sit around complaining!<br>
I'll do my best to learn!<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Great. Let's go through one step at a time. I've got the manual right here.<br>
If you have any questions, don't hesitate. I'll demonstrate for you again.<br>
<br>
Zeven nods eagerly. She stares intently at the coffee maker, ready to face this formidable foe once more.<br>

Operation: Learn to Make Coffee<br>
I showed Zeven a thorough demonstration of how to use the machine.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
And we're done.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">De Zeven Provinciën：</span><br>
That was so fast! But so perfect...<br>
<br>
Seeing the fragrant coffee before her, she closes her eyes and takes a deep breath.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">De Zeven Provinciën：</span><br>
Fresh-brewed coffee... It doesn't smell burnt at all.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
......<br>
(What the hell has she been drinking until now?)<br>
<br>
She raises the cup to her lips and takes a sip of the caramel-colored liquid.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">De Zeven Provinciën：</span><br>
Mmm... Commander, your coffee is delicious!<br>
May I give it a try now?<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Of course. That's why you're here.<br>
<br>
Encouraged by the taste of good coffee, she psyches herself up again.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">De Zeven Provinciën：</span><br>
Okay... Here goes!<br>
This time, I swear I won't fail!<br>
......<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
.........<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">De Zeven Provinciën：</span><br>
............<br>
Um... Commander...<br>
<br>
White steam erupts from the machine.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
A-at least it isn't black smoke this time. That's progress.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">De Zeven Provinciën：</span><br>
But I couldn't even make it through the grinding step.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Umm... Well, that is the most important step when it comes to making good coffee.<br>
Get this part down, and the rest is smooth sailing!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">De Zeven Provinciën：</span><br>
Y-you mean it?<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Yeah!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">De Zeven Provinciën：</span><br>
Okay... I'll try again!<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
.........<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">De Zeven Provinciën：</span><br>
Oh, where did it go wrong this time?<br>
<br>
Zeven hangs her head, facing the lump of black charcoal in her cup.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Hmm... Maybe you extracted it too long.<br>
Uh... You know, I happen to like over-extracted coffee.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">De Zeven Provinciën：</span><br>
Do you mean it?<br>
Commander, you're not lying to make me feel better, are you?<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Ahem. Of course not... I'm taking this lesson very seriously right now.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">De Zeven Provinciën：</span><br>
Uh-huh...<br>
Well, this time, I swear I'm going to make this thing work right!<br>
<br>
We ended up spending the whole night as such.<br>
The table got covered in coffee grounds and milk stains. Several cups lay sideways on top of it, spilling various shades of brown.<br>
It's only when morning sunlight drifts into my room that we finally realize how long we've been at it.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">De Zeven Provinciën：</span><br>
In the end... I never could make coffee worth drinking.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
You're making serious progress, though.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">De Zeven Provinciën：</span><br>
Progress...?<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Yeah. I mean, the machine hasn't broken since the sixteenth cup.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">De Zeven Provinciën：</span><br>
Have you been keeping track of that all throughout the night?<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Sure have. You're working hard, so I decided I should do the same.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">De Zeven Provinciën：</span><br>
I thought I was just causing trouble for you this whole time...<br>
<br>
Zeven shakes her head and smiles, relieved.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">De Zeven Provinciën：</span><br>
I would never betray your trust, Commander.<br>
So tomorrow night... Well, I guess it's tonight by now...<br>
May I spend the evening with you again?<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
I'd love it.<br>
No matter how long it takes, no matter how many nights we toil... we'll see this through together.<br>
<br>
One little promise sprouts here in my room.<br>
May our feelings nurture it until, one day, it grows sturdy branches that bear beautiful flowers.<br>
And may each flower weave its own little story for the years that follow.<br>
