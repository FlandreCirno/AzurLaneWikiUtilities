Light Up My Day<br>
<br>
1 Guess Who!<br>
It was a sunny day. The port was enveloped in a pleasant warmth.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Marblehead：</span><br>
*yawn*... Man, I always get so sleepy when it's warm. Almost makes me wanna go tan.<br>
Especially when I've got nothing else to do... Hang on, is that the commander? All alone in here?<br>
Well, well... I just found the cure to my boredom!<br>
Heyo, Commander! Guess who!<br>
<br>
Someone approached me from behind and covered my eyes with her hands, then prompted me to guess her name.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Marblehead：</span><br>
C'mon, timer's ticking away. Get it right, and you might just win a prize, or whatevs!<br>
...Richmond? Er-err, wrong. You're not completely off the mark, though!<br>
San Diego? No. Hint: I'm not a redhead. 5 seconds left to get it right! 4... 3... 2... 1... Sorry, time's up!<br>
The disappointment is real. How come you don't remember the trendiest girl in port? That's, like, punishable in my book.<br>
<br>
Marblehead pouted at me, then softly poked my left hand with her index finger.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Marblehead：</span><br>
So, I hereby sentence you to a manicure, performed by me, personally!<br>
Memphis might be the queen of nails, but I can still do a solid job. Now gimme your hand, and we'll get those nails lookin' worthy of a Juustagram header.<br>
...You've got paperwork to do? Should've thought about that before you forgot my name, sweetie!<br>
<br>
She grabbed my hand, but then suddenly paused as though her train of thought just changed tracks.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Marblehead：</span><br>
Tell you what! If a manicure's too much, why don't we instead go outside for like, a short walk?<br>
...You've gotta plan something important? All the more reason to get some fresh air!<br>
C'mon. You won't get any work done by staying glued to your desk. A quick breather will do you good!<br>
<br>
She was very insistent on this, so I yielded and agreed to go outside with her.<br>

Light Up My Day<br>
<br>
2 Smile for the Camera<br>
Right as we set foot outdoors, I was greeted by the sun's warming light, contrasted by cooling breezes of wind. It felt wonderful.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Marblehead：</span><br>
Whew! While we're blowing away them cobwebs anyhoo, we might as well get something done. Question is: what?<br>
...Oh! Here comes the answer! Wassup?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Memphis：</span><br>
Marblehead? And the commander, too. Good evening. What are you two up to?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Marblehead：</span><br>
Like, nothing, pretty much. What about you?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Memphis：</span><br>
Just enjoying a stroll on my day off, taking some photos of the occasional picturesque places at port. Nothing much.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Marblehead：</span><br>
Niiice. Speakin' of photos, I've got just the perfect subject for you.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Memphis：</span><br>
And what would that be?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Marblehead：</span><br>
Not what, but whom! Me and the commander here! Eyes ahead and give the camera a big smile, Commander!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Memphis：</span><br>
I should've figured... Sure, I suppose. Just stand close to each other, and I'll snap a picture.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Marblehead：</span><br>
You heard the camerawoman! C'mon then, next to me. Ready? Say cheese!<br>
<br>
The shutter clicked with a quaint sound. Moments later, the camera began producing a photograph.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Memphis：</span><br>
We're lucky I brought my instant camera today. Just give it a minute while the picture develops.<br>
<br>
Memphis flapped the forming photo through the air to speed the process up. After that was done, she handed it to Marblehead.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Marblehead：</span><br>
Sweet! Now to fancy it up a li'l with some cutesy symbols! Got a marker pen, Commander?<br>
Cool, thanks. Just gimme a sec... There! Whaddya think? Doesn't it look real nice?<br>
<br>
Marblehead drew on a myriad of ribbons, stars, and other decor. They added a strangely endearing quality to the photo.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Marblehead：</span><br>
I really like how this one came out. It's totes getting a slot in my photo album.<br>
Anyhoo, feeling like you cleared your head, Commander? Good. I've gotta run now, but I'll catch you later! And don't forget my name next time!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Memphis：</span><br>
Wait, before you go– And she's off already... If I were you, Commander, I'd feel like I'd almost just been manipulated.<br>
Although, I suppose her dragging you out of the office did give you a warranted break.<br>
Indeed it did. That day, Marblehead taught me the benefits of stopping to take a breather.<br>

<br>
3 Girl Talk<br>
Later - Port Canteen<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Kumano ：</span><br>
Heya, Marblehead. Been hearing you and the commander snapped a group photo. What's that all about?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Marblehead：</span><br>
Word gets around quick, huh? I've got it right here. Came out real good, if I say so myself!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Kumano ：</span><br>
Lemme have a look... Huh, it's a lot tamer than I expected. I figured you'd be kissing or something.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Marblehead：</span><br>
Puh-lease. You take me for a girl who forces herself onto the commander? If it's not solicited, I'm not doing it.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Kumano ：</span><br>
Plenty of girls here who do just that, though? If you wanna hit it up with the commander, you gotta get physical.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Marblehead：</span><br>
Deadass? Memphis, you reckon I'm being too passive?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Memphis：</span><br>
I wouldn't know. What I can tell you is the commander did appreciate being taken outside for a brief break.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Marblehead：</span><br>
Wait, what?! Legit surprised right now. Here I thought I'd just gotten in the commander's way!<br>
Hmm... Maybe this all means the commander likes girls who take the lead. I'm gonna need to do some asking around.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Astoria：</span><br>
Well, based on my experience, sudden hugs are a no-go. Seen some girls wrap their arm around the commander's when they're going for a stroll, though.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Marblehead：</span><br>
This is probably my inner shy girl speaking, but that's like, way outta my comfort zone. The arm-wrapping thing, I mean.<br>
Anyway, I'll come up with something and make a real advance next time.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Memphis：</span><br>
Good luck with that. I'll be rooting for you, I guess. From the sidelines.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Marblehead：</span><br>
Thanks, "I guess"...<br>
Still, I'll take all the positive energy I can get. Here's hoping I'll get the chance to take the commander along again sometime soon.<br>
<br>
I had overheard most of the girls' conversation from a few tables away. I wasn't sure what to make of it...<br>

Port - Academy<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Omaha：</span><br>
Oh, Marblehead! Come here for a sec! I've got something for you!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Marblehead：</span><br>
Sup, Omaha? Whatcha got– Oh my god! How much damn chocolate is this?!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Omaha：</span><br>
A lot! I've been stockpiling it for a long time. Thing is, though... I'm gonna go on a diet.<br>
I feel soooo bad about parting ways with my sweet sweeties, but it's a necessary sacrifice to lose weight. So I'm giving it all to you!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Marblehead：</span><br>
Again? You gave in once before, last I remember. You sure you wanna give it all away?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Omaha：</span><br>
This time, I'm gonna stick to it! Look, just take it, I won't eat it anyway!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Marblehead：</span><br>
Yeah, but– Welp, Omaha's left the building. Guess this chocolate's mine now. But I can't eat it all either, so I should probs give some to Concord.<br>
...Oh! Commander! Over here!<br>
<br>
As I was passing by, Marblehead called out to me.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Marblehead：</span><br>
...Wait, crap, I ruined my chance to do another "Guess who"!<br>
<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项1："No need to."</span>'''''<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项1："I don't have to guess anymore."</span>'''''<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Marblehead：</span><br>
Really? Aight. All's good as long as you remember me. Anyhoo, as I was saying, you see this mound of chocolate?<br>
I love choccy as much as the next girl, but this? It's just too much to eat alone. So, wanna have some?<br>
Whew... I'm stuffed. My tongue's totes coated in chocolate.<br>
Premium chocolate, at that. Omaha do be living up to her name as a chocolate gourmand.<br>
Oh yeah, forgot to ask before we started chowing down: why're you out and about today, Commander?<br>
"No reason in particular. I was just on a walk to the beach, and that's when I ran into you."<br>
Ah, I see! Then mind if I join you? Hell, why not make a date out of it?<br>
...Kinda sudden? Yeah, but we've gotta burn some of those calories we just gorged ourselves on.<br>
So like, please? Can we take a stroll together, then go on a little date?<br>
<br>
She was being pushy again, but it didn't bother me much – it's fun hanging with her, so ultimately, I agreed to it.<br>

Light Up My Day<br>
<br>
5 Seashells by the Seashore<br>
Taken by an urge to listen to the sound of the sea, I brought Marblehead to the beachside.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Marblehead：</span><br>
Check it out, Commander! The beach is littered with all these colorful seashells!<br>
Most of the seashells washing up on this shore come in stunning shades of pink. Cute, right?<br>
Speaking of which, I just found a real banger! And guess what? I'm gonna gift it to you!<br>
<br>
She handed me a seashell with an exquisite shape. I put it to my ear and listened to the sound coming from inside.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Marblehead：</span><br>
Whatcha doing?<br>
...Listening to the sound inside? Ah, I getcha. The technical term for it is "pink noise," fittingly enough.<br>
The seashell's helix structure captures ambient noise, which then resonates inside. As a result, the noise is amplified, making it...<br>
<br>
She began explaining the process in great detail. I was astonished by her almost scholarly level of knowledge.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Marblehead：</span><br>
...which isn't always the case, but pink noise possesses a fractal frequency, and that's why...<br>
Err, what I'm getting at is...<br>
Y'know, like, that's just what I heard? I'm not, like, an expert or anything.<br>
<br>
Cutting herself off, she awkwardly took the seashell out of my hand, then took the conversation in another direction.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Marblehead：</span><br>
A-anyway! I just noticed this seashell's got the same color as the pink gradient of my hair. Ain't that nifty?<br>
Changing the subject? Am not! Just thought it looked pretty, is all!<br>
What I'm saying is: it reminds you of me, right? So I want you to treasure it like you'd treasure me.<br>
<br>
Hands cupped around the seashell, she returned it to me with a slow, deliberate motion.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Marblehead：</span><br>
Just kidding, obviously. Sorry if that was cringe, haha.<br>
<br>
She laughed it off, dismissing it as a joke. Despite that, though, I felt she'd meant it.<br>

Light Up My Day<br>
<br>
6 Sunlit Backstory<br>
Marblehead and I continued our stroll around the port until we noticed the sun had begun to set. We made way to higher ground to watch it.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Marblehead：</span><br>
Man, I'll never tire of seeing the sun set.<br>
Especially here, where the view's just stunning. Am I right, Commander?<br>
...My eyes are up here, y'know. Or are you just curious 'bout this photo?<br>
<br>
The photograph attached to her uniform by a clip had caught my eye. She took it off and showed it to me.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Marblehead：</span><br>
This is me. Used to be me, anyway. I was a lame, nerdy girl who stuffed her head with useless knowledge, like that pink noise stuff. Kinda just slipped out of me.<br>
Anyway, I'm happy with the way I am now. I don't wanna go back to the old me, not at all.<br>
I mean, like, old me wouldn't have the courage to go on a date with you! Not in a million years!<br>
<br>
Then, she flashed a smile at me. The cutest smile I'd ever seen, enhanced by the glow of the setting sun.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Marblehead：</span><br>
Wow, you look captivated~ Really dig my smile, eh?<br>
Listen, Commander, I'd be happy to hang out with you anytime you've got too much work on your plate and need a break.<br>
You can't devote your whole life to work or studies or whatever, it'd be a total crap life. I'd know, trust me. Promise you'll give me a call sometime?<br>
<br>
She extended her pinky towards me. I obliged and hooked mine around hers.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Marblehead：</span><br>
Good! This pinky promise is like, legally binding, yeah? Hehe~<br>
Today was a boatload of fun! Let's do it again sometime! Now, if you don't mind, I've gotta head off and complete some missions.<br>
Looking forward to hanging out with you again soon, Commander! Buh-bye for now!<br>

<br>
7 Toward a New Tomorrow<br>
It was the start of a new day. I was just about to start working, but then a certain someone covered my eyes from behind.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Marblehead：</span><br>
Guess who?<br>
...Omaha or Concord? Now you're just messing with me. You know who I am! C'mon, tell me the real answer.<br>
Marblehead? You're technically correct, but you're forgetting something important, ain'tcha?<br>
The answer in full is: I'm Marblehead, your peppy right-hand girl slash secretary!<br>
Gotta say, I'm still surprised you like, appointed me as your secretary. Surprised in a good way, 'course.<br>
<br>
"The idea came to me after our date on that sunny day."<br>
"I thought, 'Your smile always brightens up my day.' Just seeing it makes me more productive. And boosting productivity is exactly what an ideal secretary should do."<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Marblehead：</span><br>
Hehe~ Glad to know I'm the best fit for the job.<br>
On another note... I've gotta get something off my chest. I'm really into you, Commander. Like, REALLY into you.<br>
<br>
This came out of nowhere. My surprise clearly showed on my face.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Marblehead：</span><br>
Haha! That's just the reaction I was hoping to see! Thanks~<br>
For real though, I mean it. You're just perfect in my eyes. But what about you? Are you into me, too?<br>
...Hehe! I knew it~<br>
<br>
Her cheeks reddened slightly while a smile as bright as the sun took shape on her lips.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Marblehead：</span><br>
All right, it's time we got to work. If you're wonderin' something, just holler. Despite my getup, I dare say I'm smarter than most girls~<br>
<br>
Whatever challenges were ahead of me, I felt confident I'd be able to overcome them with Marblehead by my side.<br>
Just as the sun lights up the world, her presence lights up my own world. She is my ray of sunshine.<br>
