Northern Parliament<br>
Black Sea Coastal Base<br>
Morning<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Poltava：</span><br>
Soyuz, I've finished loading the goods. You're good to go whenever.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Sovetsky Soyuz：</span><br>
That was quick. Thank you, Poltava.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Sovetskaya Belorussiya：</span><br>
"Quick"... In the end, they're taking the supply airplane, eh?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Kronshtadt：</span><br>
Yup. Traveling to Socotra is safer by air, and we'll be able to avoid prying eyes. Supply planes regularly go back and forth.<br>
Once they touch down, Soyuz will board a special-purpose submarine.<br>
She'll then complete the rest of her journey by sea.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Kirov：</span><br>
It is fortunate we have a submarine that can be deployed in the Southern Ocean.<br>
They're not going straight to Antarctica though, are they? You can't resupply at Port Louis if you're staying submerged the whole journey.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Kronshtadt：</span><br>
No need to worry. Resupplying will be done in a secret submarine dock hidden beneath the surface dock.<br>
The supplies will be brought in under the pretext that they're also bound for Port Louis.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Sovetskaya Rossiya：</span><br>
Doing everything possible to ensure the operation stays under wraps, eh.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Sovetsky Soyuz：</span><br>
Yes. Kronshtadt came up with the itinerary. It's as airtight as can be.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Sovetskaya Rossiya：</span><br>
...But even an airtight plan can only get you so far. I presume everything will change after reaching Antarctica?<br>
I don't like how few guns have been assigned to this mission. I understand it's for the sake of secrecy, but what if things go sideways?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Sovetsky Soyuz：</span><br>
We're here to sample a special mineral that can resonate with shipgirl rigging, not to conduct a combat operation.<br>
I'm sure you're aware, Antarctica has always been a relatively stable region, with limited Siren presence and practically no Reenactments.<br>
Furthermore, with the question of the Azur Lane's reformation on the table, each faction is likely going to be cautious about stoking any conflicts.<br>
Tallinn, our group, and some mass-produced ships are sufficient to accomplish this mission.<br>
If there are no further concerns, I'd like everyone to focus on their respective tasks.<br>
Rossiya, Belorussiya, Kirov, I trust you with command of the Northern Parliament's fleet until I return.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Kirov：</span><br>
Understood. Just leave it to me.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Sovetsky Soyuz：</span><br>
Voroshilov, stay in touch with our representatives over in the Iris Orthodoxy. Keep things moving with Pamiat' and Avrora.<br>
You have the authority to make decisions on the fly – so do not be afraid to exercise it.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Voroshilov：</span><br>
Of course. Small issues I can handle by myself. Any big problems, I'll consult Kirov, Rossiya, or Belorussiya before I make a move.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Avrora：</span><br>
Considering how lukewarm the conference has been so far, I don't expect any big problems to arise.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Sovetsky Soyuz：</span><br>
Most likely not. Also, please keep tabs on Comrade Commander.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Kronshtadt：</span><br>
That won't be easy with the Tribunal breathing down everyone's necks, but I'll do what I can.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Pamiat' Merkuria：</span><br>
If you're crap out of luck, come to me! I've got a break-glass-in-case-of-emergency ace up my sleeve!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Sovetsky Soyuz：</span><br>
What exactly... would that entail?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Pamiat' Merkuria：</span><br>
Oh, you know! I'll go crash at Commander's place for a good while and get myself the MVP treatment – eat, sleep, then roll around all day!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Sovetsky Soyuz：</span><br>
Hah. I suppose that is something only you can do.<br>
Now, I should hang up. It's time for me to set off.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Sovetskaya Rossiya：</span><br>
Good luck, sister. I look forward to the good news.<br>
<br>
Iris Orthodoxy - Holy Capital<br>
Azur Lane Provisional Base<br>
Sometime later<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Memphis：</span><br>
Commander, message from Clemenceau. She says, "The Arctic hare has set off."<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
...The "Arctic hare," huh? I wasn't expecting Sovetsky Soyuz to make the trip herself.<br>
The news must've been especially enticing to her. Word is that she's been having some sort of issue with her rigging.<br>
Any news about the Eagle Union? About this "Operation Frozen Angel"?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Memphis：</span><br>
Yes, actually. Saratoga's fleet is still preparing to disembark over in PH.<br>
Saratoga's pulled together a whole bunch of people from a variety of bases and regional defense forces. To be blunt, it's been a bit of a logistical nightmare.<br>
Everyone's been on edge, and given all the various complications, it'll probably be another three or four days until they're ready to go.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Helena：</span><br>
The Royal Navy and Iron Blood have started moving as well.<br>
A fleet has emerged from the Floating Fortress in the Bismarck Sea. We've asked where they're going, but as always, they're not very keen on telling us.<br>
On the Royal Navy side of things, shipgirls from their Southern Ocean fleet are on the move.<br>
Both sides are probably heading for Antarctica.<br>
From the looks of it, the Royal Navy will reach land first.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
You'd think so, since they're closest to it. It's safe to assume they received the intel at the same time as us.<br>
At this point, everyone's well aware of the special crystals that've appeared in Antarctica, just as I had hoped.<br>
That throws a real wrench in the Sirens' plan to have the Eagle Union's leadership seize everything for themselves.<br>
...But, something still smells fishy about this whole situation.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Helena：</span><br>
What do you mean?<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Every other single faction has basically responded the same way after hearing the news – only dispatching a small force to investigate the situation.<br>
Meanwhile, the Eagle Union has assembled a massive force under Saratoga.<br>
She would not wait to act in order to help Lexington. She'd take action at once. And yet she hasn't. Why?<br>
You could argue she's waiting for clearance or something, but that isn't like her.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Memphis：</span><br>
Why, indeed... Maybe she knows something we don't.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Either they've discovered something we don't know yet... or Antarctica isn't as safe as we thought.<br>
And I need to play my cards very carefully. The spotlight's been on me ever since the conference began, and I can't make any rash decisions...<br>
...Which is why we need to continue playing their game. Memphis, Helena, continue monitoring the other factions.<br>
Just in case... I need to come up with some sort of contingency plan.<br>
<br>
After the resolution of the near-imposition incident at the World Expo,<br>
The factions gather to discuss the reforging of a new Azur Lane.<br>
Yet just at that time, news arrives that a mysterious substance has been discovered in the distant reaches of Antarctica–<br>
A crystal that can resonate with riggings, amplifying their combat prowess.<br>
The Eagle Union's leadership immediately assembled a massive force to claim this new motherlode for themselves–<br>
But a series of behind-the-scenes "leaks" has shifted the dynamic, creating a race among all the factions.<br>
One after another, countless eyes now turn towards the frozen expanses of the Antarctic.<br>
What truly lies there, amidst the snowdrifts?<br>
"Let us cast aside the dark ignorance of the future, and return to the luminous light of the past."<br>
"Let us return... to the chosen 'Eden.'"<br>

<br>
Antarctic Ocean - Underwater<br>
Aboard the Northern Parliament Submarine Kalinka<br>
Several days later<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Poltava：</span><br>
Soyuz, we've entered the Antarctic Ocean.<br>
The situation is rather uncertain in these waters. The data we've gathered up to now may prove unreliable.<br>
Shouldn't it be safe to resurface by now? Nobody has any idea that we're out here.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Sovetsky Soyuz：</span><br>
You're right. No matter how secretive we are, we will expose ourselves once we reach the research station.<br>
We're safely out of range of onlookers. You may resurface.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Poltava：</span><br>
Understood. Starting surfacing sequence.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ognevoy：</span><br>
Yay! I'll finally get to see some cute landscapes!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Svirepy：</span><br>
Ya fawning over icebergs and snow now? Come on, you've seen that a billion times back home.<br>
It's just some frozen water. Act mature for once and focus.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ognevoy：</span><br>
It's not JUST frozen water! This is Antarctica! A whole continent covered in ice and snow!<br>
Oh, I'm so excited to see it for myself! Come on, Svirepy, get excited!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Svirepy：</span><br>
Cut it out! I'm not gonna "get excited"! Buzz off already!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ognevoy：</span><br>
Heehee, sorryyy♪<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Svirepy：</span><br>
Alright, alright, I CAN understand bein' excited about visiting someplace for the first time.<br>
Plus, we've been stuck in this sub the whole time. I'd kill to finally get some fresh air.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Poltava：</span><br>
Heh. Hold on tight now, folks. We're almost there.<br>
Increasing speed!<br>
<br>
The bridge rose out of the water. Through the portholes, a landscape of ice and snow unfolded before the shipgirls.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ognevoy：</span><br>
Look how white it is... We've not even arrived in Antarctica yet, but still!<br>
It's beautiful. And so cute!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Svirepy：</span><br>
Stop sayin' that already! It's basically identical to the views around the Arctic Circle!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Pamiat' Merkuria：</span><br>
As a matter of fact, you are incorrect!<br>
Glaciers considered "big" around the Arctic Circle are commonplace here.<br>
And the closer we get to the South Pole, the more stunning the vistas will get.<br>
Just look! A whole continent of pure white! An ice-covered wasteland devoid of life!<br>
Maybe most impressive of all, it's over half as big as our whole motherland!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Svirepy：</span><br>
Eh, I guess that's cool... Wait, this place is bigger than even the Eagle Union?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Pamiat' Merkuria：</span><br>
Sure is. What's more, almost all of Antarctica's land is covered by ice.<br>
Signs of human civilization, you ask? Only a handful of research bases!<br>
We're about to set foot in an untouched, unexplored part of the world, filled with mystery.<br>
That's not just exciting – it's outright exhilarating!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Svirepy：</span><br>
You've almost sold me on it now...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Sovetsky Soyuz：</span><br>
A continent of pure white...<br>
I can't help but be reminded of something unpleasant.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Pamiat' Merkuria：</span><br>
Oh, right, you got caught up in that near-superimposition thing.<br>
From the Black Sea to the World Expo, all of Europa was covered in white goop. Sheesh, that must've sucked!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Sovetsky Soyuz：</span><br>
It certainly wasn't good.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Pamiat' Merkuria：</span><br>
Boy, we were lucky your rigging didn't malfunction back then!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Sovetsky Soyuz：</span><br>
(Instead, I overworked it to the point of rendering it almost unserviceable. I hope that this new crystal can restore it to working order.)<br>
(Wait... Why is Pamiat' here? Did she get urgently reassigned to this mission?)<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Pamiat' Merkuria：</span><br>
Hey, don't worry about it! Your rigging's gonna be fine!<br>
<br>
The surfaced submarine forged onward through the Antarctic Ocean.<br>
Using its powerful engine and giant, reinforced ice-breaking ram, it shoved and crushed the sea ice, leaving a clear path in its wake.<br>
But, powerful though it may be, the ice still slowed it down. It wasn't long before the excited cheers of the destroyers faded amidst the sound of breaking ice.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ognevoy：</span><br>
Being in this snowscape too long is scary... This is NOT cute...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Svirepy：</span><br>
So NOW it's not? You were yappin' about how cute it was just a minute ago!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ognevoy：</span><br>
Ugh... White, white everywhere... It's like a big cake, with lots and lots of frosting...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Svirepy：</span><br>
Deludin' yourself ain't gonna help for long. You'll just have to live with how boring this place is.<br>
Soyuz, can I ask you something?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Sovetsky Soyuz：</span><br>
Sure. Especially if it's intellectually stimulating.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Svirepy：</span><br>
How come no nation's laid claim to Antarctica?<br>
Yeah, it's cold, but so is the Arctic, and we've all built permanent settlements there and created routes to it.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Sovetsky Soyuz：</span><br>
That is a good question.<br>
There is no short answer, however. Let's find a comfortable place to sit down first.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Pamiat' Merkuria：</span><br>
Sounds like it's time for a history lesson with Soyuz. I'll go get some drinks!<br>
{{折叠面板|内容结束}}

{{折叠面板|标题=The Antarctic Treaty|选项=3|主框=1|样式=primary|展开=是}}
<br>
The submarine's voyage continued. Meanwhile, the girls had all gathered in the mess hall.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ognevoy：</span><br>
Thank you!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Svirepy：</span><br>
Is this... juice? Seriously?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Pamiat' Merkuria：</span><br>
Duh. We can't get drunk on a mission!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Poltava：</span><br>
I'd love a drink as much as the next girl, but we should stay alert. The liquor stays in the cupboard.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Pamiat' Merkuria：</span><br>
Well, Soyuz? Everyone's seated. Let's hear the answer to Svirepy's question!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Sovetsky Soyuz：</span><br>
Right. I'll now tell you about the history of Antarctica.<br>
<br>
Sovetsky Soyuz also raises the glass of juice to her lips, but her mind has already begun to embark on another voyage.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Sovetsky Soyuz：</span><br>
In the last great war, before the Azur Lane splintered, the factions of the world came together to discuss who would control Antarctica.<br>
After many long debates, humanity finally reached an agreement – one that came to be known as the Antarctic Treaty.<br>
The treaty had many provisions. First and foremost, all claims made over Antarctica's territory were suspended.<br>
The entire continent would not belong to any single government, but would be under the management of the Azur Lane.<br>
The construction of research bases or naval outposts to defend against Sirens would only be allowed with permission from the Azur Lane.<br>
Furthermore, the command structure in Antarctica was to be equal to or higher than anti-Siren operational areas in each sea sector.<br>
Even after the Crimson Axis was established, the Azur Lane's attitude toward Antarctic remained the same.<br>
The Azur Lane may also, for any reason, freely take command of fleets or ships belonging to its member states stationed in Antarctica or its surrounding ocean.<br>
It may also intervene in any and all armed conflicts within its borders.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Svirepy：</span><br>
Does that include... Reenactments?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Sovetsky Soyuz：</span><br>
It does.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Svirepy：</span><br>
In other words, the Commander's power is infinite here?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Sovetsky Soyuz：</span><br>
"Infinite" might be an overstatement, but it is true that Comrade Commander's authority is greater here than anywhere else.<br>
Such is the power of the naval commander of the Azur Lane.<br>
On paper, this authority supersedes that of the governments around the world, though in practice, it has yet to be exercised.<br>
There are no Reenactments around Antarctica, and there have never been any significant encounters against the Sirens here either.<br>
If anything, one could say that the Antarctic Treaty is a forgotten remnant from the last great war.<br>
Back then, the Sirens had such an insurmountable advantage that even certain coastal regions were hard to defend. The strategic value of a place as distant as Antarctica... was less than zero.<br>
Essentially, things boiled down to this simple principle: "We won't touch it if nobody else does." Rarely are things so straightforward on the international stage.<br>
And so it remained... until after the war, when the Azur Lane split. Then, things began to change.<br>
It started with Iron Blood, which took advantage of the "anti-Siren outposts" part of the treaty to construct military bases.<br>
Thanks to the knowledge they'd gained from reverse-engineering Siren technology, those bases got finished in the blink of an eye.<br>
Then, as part of a gambit by its higher-ups, the Eagle Union built a military stronghold and stationed a permanent fleet in the area.<br>
The Northern Parliament, Royal Navy, and Iris Orthodoxy all attempted to follow suit with our own bases, but due to the ensuing Reenactments, none of us made any real progress.<br>
Afterwards, the Iris Orthodoxy was split into two, forcing them to withdraw any claims on the continent.<br>
The Royal Navy downsized their forces, eventually giving up their goals of maintaining a military base on Antarctica.<br>
As for us, we largely abandoned our hopes of militarizing our research bases and shifted our attention back towards more pressing issues in the Arctic North.<br>
There are recorded incidents of the governments of the Eagle Union and Iron Blood exchanging blows through mass-produced ships, but beyond that, no major conflicts have broken out.<br>
However, you must take note that a single truth underpinned all these events – that Antarctica had no strategic value.<br>
Which brings us to the current day.<br>
As you all know, the Azur Lane and the Crimson Axis have reached a comprehensive ceasefire agreement.<br>
As we speak, representatives from all over the world are gathered at the reunited Iris Orthodoxy to discuss the reformation of a single Azur Lane.<br>
Naturally, one of the terms for this process would be that all parties would assume their roles in upholding the existing treaties and agreements of the Azur Lane.<br>
And of course, the Antarctic Treaty would be no exception.<br>
Having all that said, regardless of how this negotiation process actually goes, as long as all of the factions are still willing to come to the table, there shouldn't be any major power shifts in Antarctica.<br>
The Royal Navy, Northern Parliament, Eagle Union, and Iron Blood – these are the factions that still have research bases in Antarctica.<br>
Of these factions, only the last two have any sort of military presence here.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Pamiat' Merkuria：</span><br>
Yup! Also, fun fact – our research station was made in collaboration with Iron Blood!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Svirepy：</span><br>
Wait, what? That's news to me!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Poltava：</span><br>
I never knew that, either. Our Intelligence Bureau must keep that fact close to the vest.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Sovetsky Soyuz：</span><br>
Pamiat' is correct. Our station was indeed built with borrowed Iron Blood technology.<br>
It's not strictly confidential information, just a little-known fact.<br>
We knew about the Reenactments and shared our intel with Iron Blood. Around this time, we decided to build a base hidden from Naval HQ's prying eyes.<br>
Me, Friedrich, and many others... we all came together in preparation for the coming war with the Sirens.<br>
This included building our own research station in Antarctica.<br>
We built it because this war with the Sirens will one day be over.<br>
We built it because the world still has so many discoveries waiting to be made.<br>
We built it because the future holds countless possibilities.<br>
We built it because, if human society dedicates itself solely to war...<br>
Then what will we do once there is no more war to fight?<br>
This is why we built the research station. In preparation for a better tomorrow.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Poltava：</span><br>
My... Really makes you think.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Svirepy：</span><br>
Okay, so if I got this right...<br>
Nobody lives in Antarctica, so the Sirens don't attack it.<br>
The Sirens don't attack it, so nobody really cares about it.<br>
Nobody really cares about it, so humanity signed a treaty, agreeing to just share it.<br>
And because nobody cares about it, the research station gets away with doing stuff in secret. That right?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Pamiat' Merkuria：</span><br>
Pretty much!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Svirepy：</span><br>
(Huh? When'd Pamiat' get here?)<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Pamiat' Merkuria：</span><br>
Also, while it's true no PEOPLE live there, it's still home to a whole ecosystem.<br>
On that subject, now it's my turn to play the teacher! Can anyone name an Antarctic animal?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ognevoy：</span><br>
Me, me! Penguins!<br>
Round penguins! Cute penguins!<br>
Will we, um, get to see any of those here?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Sovetsky Soyuz：</span><br>
Most likely. The research station isn't far from a penguin habitat.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ognevoy：</span><br>
Hooray! Heehee... Hm? What is it, Svirepy? You look like something's on your mind.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Svirepy：</span><br>
Round means fat. Fat means ancient people probably ate 'em.<br>
And they lay eggs, don't they? Betcha somebody's made a penguin egg omelet.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ognevoy：</span><br>
Whuh? But penguins are such cute little things... How could anyone be so cruel?!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Svirepy：</span><br>
Round penguins. Tasty penguins. I wonder if we can catch one...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Pamiat' Merkuria：</span><br>
Let me stop you right there!<br>
Remember the Antarctic Treaty? Yeah, it explicitly says all Antarctic animals are protected, whether they fly in the sky or walk on land!<br>
Don't even THINK about eating any of them! It's not gonna happen!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Svirepy：</span><br>
Damn. You live to see another day, penguins...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ognevoy：</span><br>
Phew... That's a relief to hear.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Sovetsky Soyuz：</span><br>
You won't have to worry about food. In addition to the supplies for our expedition, we're also bringing rations to resupply our research station.<br>
Please don't do anything to the little penguins other than adore them, Svirepy.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Svirepy：</span><br>
Yeah, yeah, I know.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Pamiat' Merkuria：</span><br>
Ahh, I get it.<br>
We've come all the way to Antarctica, and you'd hate to leave without trying some of the local cuisine, right?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Svirepy：</span><br>
Yeah? I guess?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Pamiat' Merkuria：</span><br>
Then have I got good news for you! All the animals that fly or walk on land are off-limits...<br>
But all the ones that swim in the water are fair game!<br>
Like krill, for one! It's pretty good!<br>
And don't feel too bummed out about the penguins. According to ancient Antarctic hunters, it hardly tastes any different from chicken.<br>
If you're REALLY craving chicken, then I can roast one for you. You'll just have to make do with that!<br>
Or I could make krill noodle soup. Royalty used to have that at their banquets long ago, so it's gotta be delicious.<br>
Granted, they didn't use krill back then, but still!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Svirepy：</span><br>
Doesn't SOUND that good, but like they say – don't knock it 'til you've tried it.<br>
Wait, you never said you can cook, Pamiat'!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Pamiat' Merkuria：</span><br>
Well, I do! Sometimes. I make old dishes to keep the taste alive in my memory!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Communicator：</span><br>
BEEP BEEP!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Tallinn：</span><br>
This is research station Mirny.<br>
Kalinka, your signal has been verified. Welcome to Antarctica.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Sovetsky Soyuz：</span><br>
Thank you. It's been a while, Comrade Tallinn.<br>
We've brought you supplies – and gratitude from back home for your commitment to the motherland.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Tallinn：</span><br>
Yeah, thanks. I'll have to cook up something special tonight.<br>
Have to say, you were the last person I was expecting, Soyuz. I really didn't think you'd visit in person.<br>
One sec... There. I sent you the latest map data. There's your route to the station.<br>
Look out for icebergs and hold on to your wheel. I'll come meet you outside the station.<br>

<br>
The strikingly white landscape grew clearer and clearer as the submarine approached Antarctica.<br>
Hazy white monoliths sharpened into icebergs with defined edges, and black spots scattered along the coast clarified into buildings. The research station, too, revealed itself.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Svirepy：</span><br>
So that's Mirny. Our destination.<br>
It's bigger than I thought. And sticks out like a sore thumb.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Pamiat' Merkuria：</span><br>
Sticking out makes it easy to find in an ocean of white. Like, can you imagine trying to locate it on a ship or a plane if it was camouflaged?<br>
It's not about staying hidden from the enemy, it's about being findable by your allies.<br>
Besides, it's not Sirens or other people you should be afraid of out here. It's the environment.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Svirepy：</span><br>
So it's the same idea as paintin' a big red cross on a hospital ship? Got it.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Pamiat' Merkuria：</span><br>
Uh... No, not exactly.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Svirepy：</span><br>
It's not?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ognevoy：</span><br>
Lookie! Tallinn is waiting for us at the pier!<br>
Talliiinn! We're heeere!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Svirepy：</span><br>
Quit shouting! She can't hear us from inside the cabin anyway!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ognevoy：</span><br>
Oh, right! Oops!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Poltava：</span><br>
Settle down, girls. We'll be anchoring in a minute.<br>
It's extremely cold outside, so don't even think about going outside until you've put on extra warm clothing.<br>
<br>
Research Station Mirny - Cargo Loading Pier<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Pamiat' Merkuria：</span><br>
One step, two steps, three steps!<br>
Tadah! We've officially touched down in Antarctica!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Poltava：</span><br>
This is, what, ten thousand kilometers from our base in the Black Sea? What a journey it's been.<br>
It's a miracle we got this far.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Svirepy：</span><br>
Ah... Ahh... ACHOO!<br>
So windy... I'm freezing my face off here!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ognevoy：</span><br>
I KNEW you were going to say that! Here, put this on.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Svirepy：</span><br>
Huh? What the heck is that colorful jacket?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ognevoy：</span><br>
I covered it in lots and lots of adorable accessories! Isn't it cute?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Svirepy：</span><br>
No! It's hideous!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ognevoy：</span><br>
Rude! I think it's cute!<br>
Fine, I'll just hug you then! A nice hug should warm you right up!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Svirepy：</span><br>
Put that thing away first! The thought of gettin' hugged with that gives me chills!<br>
Ah, forget it! I'll just turn on my rigging's engine. Oughta warm me up.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Tallinn：</span><br>
Sounds like you girls have energy to spare even after such a long journey.<br>
Once more, welcome to Mirny, comrades. I'm Tallinn, I run this place.<br>
Don't worry about the cargo. The pier's automated system will handle it.<br>
Come on, let's head inside. You must be freezing out here.<br>
<br>
Mirny Interior - Break Room<br>
A thick door closed, isolating the girls from the icy winds outside. Now inside, the Mirny's heating systems slowly warmed them back up.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Svirepy：</span><br>
Phew... I feel alive again.<br>
The difference between in here and out there is crazy. It's two different worlds.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Pamiat' Merkuria：</span><br>
It's nothing but chills and howling winds outside. Here, it's cozy vibes and hot tea.<br>
Hey, doesn't this feel like a doomsday shelter?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Svirepy：</span><br>
When you put it like that... sort of?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Pamiat' Merkuria：</span><br>
There's nothing "sort of" about it.<br>
Outside these walls is unfiltered, brutal nature.<br>
If we were exposed to the elements in this place, we'd freeze to death within the hour.<br>
Which is to say – yeah, this station is absolutely like a shelter.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Svirepy：</span><br>
Anybody else notice how Pamiat' is awfully chatty today? Ain't that weird?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ognevoy：</span><br>
Weird? I think she's very insightful! I like a chatty Pamiat'!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Pamiat' Merkuria：</span><br>
Soyuz, don't you and Tallinn have important things to discuss?<br>
We can't leave these two by themselves. Tell you what, why don't you talk while I give the kids a tour around the station?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Svirepy：</span><br>
Who're you callin' a kid?!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ognevoy：</span><br>
I think she's talking about you, Svirepy!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Svirepy：</span><br>
I'm NOT a kid, ya hear?!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Pamiat' Merkuria：</span><br>
Alright, alright, sorry! Now come on, follow me.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ognevoy：</span><br>
Hooray! We're going on an adventure!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Svirepy：</span><br>
It ain't an adventure! We're only lookin' around and eliminating threats!<br>
Kids, I swear... Hey! Wait for me!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Poltava：</span><br>
Well, they're gone.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Sovetsky Soyuz：</span><br>
Pamiat'... She's acting strange.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Poltava：</span><br>
Strange?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Sovetsky Soyuz：</span><br>
Yes. It's only in the little things, but she's not entirely like her usual self.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Poltava：</span><br>
I suppose she seems a bit different. I wouldn't say it's much of a difference, though.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Tallinn：</span><br>
Maybe the environment is having some effect on her. Who knows.<br>
It's cold and snowy just like our motherland, but even worse. It's been especially stormy here as of late, too.<br>
It's not unusual for sensitive people to respond negatively to the immense isolation out here, either.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Sovetsky Soyuz：</span><br>
So it could simply be the environment...<br>
...Let's dive into the main subject now.<br>
Tallinn, give me a situation report. And a briefing on this unique crystal, please.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Tallinn：</span><br>
Yes, ma'am. A few things have happened during your journey here, actually.<br>
Starting with the crystal. It seems to affect not just riggings, but the environment as well. Snow has started melting substantially faster in the area where it was discovered.<br>
So, logically, we've started calling it "the snowmelt area."<br>
As for the crystal itself, we've collected samples of it from numerous different places around the snowmelt area.<br>
Every sample we've tested demonstrated the same rigging resonance effect.<br>
Precision improved, same with reload time, targeting time... Every variable we tested saw a positive increase. Here are the details.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Sovetsky Soyuz：</span><br>
......<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Tallinn：</span><br>
Now for some bad news. The Eagle Union has dispatched survey teams to the snowmelt area.<br>
No problem with that, you might think. Well, they've sent a lot, and I mean A LOT more shipgirls than I expected.<br>
Yesterday, I saw a massive fleet arrive at their station.<br>
Honestly, it wouldn't surprise me if they were preparing to wage a war.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Poltava：</span><br>
Wage a war?<br>
But there aren't any Reenactments in Antarctica, and the Sirens have close to zero presence here.<br>
If they're getting ready for a fight, then with whom?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Sovetsky Soyuz：</span><br>
I do not know. Perhaps they have access to some intel that we do not.<br>
What I do know is that this will significantly complicate our mining operation...<br>
Tallinn, have there been any engagements with the Eagle Union?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Tallinn：</span><br>
No, of course not. Just some peaceful back-and-forths in the snowmelt area.<br>
And the fleet that arrived yesterday hasn't even left their station yet.<br>
Whatever they're planning, they're working behind closed doors. Like us.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Sovetsky Soyuz：</span><br>
Any covert activity is off the table, I suspect. They wouldn't have amassed such a large force if stealth was their goal.<br>
Tell me about Iron Blood next. I believe they were the first to discover the crystal.<br>
Have they been up to anything of note?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Tallinn：</span><br>
Nope. I haven't seen any sign of them in the snowmelt area.<br>
Granted, their fortress base is much closer to the area than we or the Eagle Union are.<br>
Maybe they completed their investigation long before we did. It's hard to say.<br>
Oh, but I can say that, unlike us and the Eagle Union, they haven't sent in new forces.<br>
At least, not in public, they haven't.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Sovetsky Soyuz：</span><br>
They haven't sent new forces to Antarctica?<br>
...I see.<br>
I'd like to examine a sample. Could you show me one?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Tallinn：</span><br>
Sure. All the samples we've collected are being stored in the testing area. Follow me.<br>

<br>
Mirny - Testing Area<br>
Soyuz was shown to a room illuminated by dim lights. There, protected inside a glass case, she saw a crystal giving off a faint blue light.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Sovetsky Soyuz：</span><br>
Is this one of your samples?<br>
It's enormous compared to what I read in the reports. Why is that?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Tallinn：</span><br>
Ah, well, the initial samples we got were all pretty small.<br>
After some physical tests, though, we discovered that the crystals would merge with others under particular circumstances.<br>
That's not all. The larger the sample, the more strongly it resonates with riggings.<br>
That one is our largest yet. It's the result of merging many samples together.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Sovetsky Soyuz：</span><br>
It's fascinating. May I have a closer look?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Tallinn：</span><br>
Soyuz, do you... Alright.<br>
If you really want to, then me and Poltava will wait outside. Otherwise we might disrupt the resonance process.<br>
I'll lower the glass remotely in a sec. Feel free to examine it all you want.<br>
And don't worry, it's safe. I've tested it myself.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Sovetsky Soyuz：</span><br>
Thank you. I won't take long.<br>
<br>
Tallinn and Poltava left the room. A short while later, the protective glass lowered, granting Soyuz direct access to the crystal.<br>
She took a step closer, examining the glowing sample in great detail.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Sovetsky Soyuz：</span><br>
(It looks like a gemstone found in nature. No impurities as far as I can tell.)<br>
(It feels cold, almost like ice... And this blue glow – I wonder if it's somehow related to Wisdom Cubes.)<br>
<br>
Associations flashed in her mind, restructuring into ideas that she sorted through.<br>
She looked inward, trying to sense the crystal's effect on her rigging.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Sovetsky Soyuz：</span><br>
(It isn't resonating with my rigging like how the report described. I'm this close to it, and yet, nothing...)<br>
(Maybe it really is true. My hull lacks something critical that everyone else has.)<br>
<br>
A moment of hesitation. She shrugged it off and steeled herself.<br>
One step closer. Two. Three. She was now only an arm's length away from the crystal.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Sovetsky Soyuz：</span><br>
(The only thing left is to touch it.)<br>
(Let's see what happens...)<br>
<br>
Extending her hand, she softly touched the surface of the sample with her fingertips. Then...<br>
A blank, featureless space. In the middle of it, a door silently stood.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Sovetsky Soyuz：</span><br>
...A door?<br>
I suppose I'll... enter it.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">???：</span><br>
Wow, this transmission quality is pretty good. Even slips past the problem of external monitoring.<br>
Gotta hand it to Aoste, this plan is wild.<br>
He's not the only wild one. You're using your private jet to implement said plan, Dr. Anzeel.<br>
Ahaha! Use it or lose it, right?<br>
*sigh*... Thanks a bunch for forcing me on a business trip. Like I wasn't neck-deep in work already.<br>
You'd have to do it sooner or later. Look on the bright side – traveling with me, you get all the benefits of being on a private jet!<br>
The service is way better than you'd get with the trade union.<br>
Besides, I REALLY need an assistant after Aoste took mine away!<br>
Uggghhh...<br>
In any case, there's no turning back now.<br>
We have around two hours until we're out of signal range.<br>
Time is precious, so let's get down to business, Ms. Creator.<br>
Who are you calling "Creator"? Don't you start mimicking Aoste now!<br>
Oh, my apologies. It's just that I remember a certain someone here started using that word during our last meeting.<br>
I believe we were talking about embedding and adhering concepts, and someone said that a concept and an impression can exist separately for a certain time...<br>
Ugh, stoooooop!<br>
Do you remember?<br>
Look, I came up with it on the spot and just threw the idea out there! I told you not to take it seriously!<br>
Forget about it, will you? It's not worth remembering.<br>
Of course. Sorry for getting us sidetracked. Let's get back on topic.<br>
Sovetsky Soyuz, the ship with a name that was never fully constructed...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Sovetsky Soyuz：</span><br>
What was all that...?<br>
Argh! Aaghh...<br>
<br>
Suddenly, a surge of energy pulled on Soyuz's fingers.<br>
Its power was immense, dragging her toward the crystal – as though it was sucking her inside.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Sovetsky Soyuz：</span><br>
Oh, shit...<br>
Urgh... Need to... pull my hand away!<br>
<br>
She deployed her rigging. Mustering all the strength she could, she tried desperately to fight the crystal's power.<br>
Maybe seconds passed. Maybe minutes. Maybe even hours.<br>
So exhausting was the struggle for Soyuz that her perception of time was warped inside out.<br>
Her effort was not in vain, however. In fact, she won. The crystal's power let go of her.<br>
Once the blinding blue light had faded, the crystal had shattered into many pieces. Only dim lights lit the room once more.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Sovetsky Soyuz：</span><br>
*pant*... *pant*...<br>
It's over...<br>
It's finally over...<br>
The report said nothing about a phenomenon like this...<br>
It was like... a demon took control of me, and...<br>
...Huh?<br>
What... What happened to my rigging?!<br>
<br>
A thunderous sound boomed inside the room, coming right from her rigging.<br>
The beast made of steel let out its first roar – an ice-breaking cry to celebrate its birth into the world.<br>
Its awe-inspiring yet terrifying presence sent a tremble coursing through Soyuz's body.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Sovetsky Soyuz：</span><br>
I can't believe my eyes...<br>
It's... a new rigging...<br>
This output, this ability... It's stronger than even cutting-edge riggings!<br>
Did the crystal do this? That can't be. It's still there; it wasn't consumed... just like a Wisdom Cube.<br>
If it didn't materialize it by converting energy and mass like a Wisdom Cube, then my rigging must've been created through that power alone.<br>
No... It didn't CREATE my rigging.<br>
What it did was restructure my hull...<br>
That is why this rigging doesn't feel alien. It explains the strength I feel coursing through my body and into my rigging.<br>
Most of all, though, I feel like the hole inside my hull has been filled.<br>
I've been made whole...<br>
Unfortunately, that doesn't answer the many questions I now have...<br>
Like how I reached this conclusion. What that vision I saw was about. Why it happened as soon as I touched the crystal...<br>
And those strangers I saw in the vision... They said my name.<br>
It sounded like they were talking about creation through a ship's hull... That's the only thing I know now.<br>
I need to learn more...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Communicator：</span><br>
BEEP BEEP!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Tallinn：</span><br>
Hey, Soyuz. Sorry to interrupt.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Sovetsky Soyuz：</span><br>
It's alright. I've finished my testing anyway.<br>
Is something the matter?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Tallinn：</span><br>
Actually, yeah. I got a call from Iron Blood's base while you were examining the sample.<br>
They said their fleet came under attack by an unidentified enemy.<br>
They've raised their security level and suggested that we do the same.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Sovetsky Soyuz：</span><br>
...An unidentified enemy? As expected, the Eagle Union didn't muster that force for nothing.<br>
Please ask Iron Blood for specifics about this attack – and relay this news to the Eagle Union as well.<br>
I'm interested in hearing if they "know" anything about what we're up against.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ognevoy：</span><br>
A-an enemy? In Antarctica?!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Svirepy：</span><br>
I TOLD ya this would happen! This is why ya need patrols around the base!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Poltava：</span><br>
Look who's back. Did you see anything unusual?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Pamiat' Merkuria：</span><br>
No? Nothing out of the ordinary.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Poltava：</span><br>
Good. Then we'll raise the security level and be on standby until new intel comes–<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Pamiat' Merkuria：</span><br>
Hang on a sec. Iron Blood's base is pretty close to the snowmelt area, isn't it?<br>
Then since we're going out to collect samples anyway, we might as well go just a little further and help them out.<br>
What's the alternative? Folding our arms and waiting to see what happens? That's being too passive.<br>
Imagine if it was us instead. Wouldn't you wish someone would come help?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Sovetsky Soyuz：</span><br>
Yes, you're right. If the situation in Antarctica is worsening, we must complete all the goals of this trip before it's too late.<br>
Tallinn, you'll stay here and watch for news and enemies. The rest of us will travel to Iron Blood's base.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Tallinn：</span><br>
Got it. Be careful out there.<br>

<br>
Antarctica<br>
Ice Field<br>
Sometime later<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Poltava：</span><br>
Soyuz, got a minute? I wanted to ask you something.<br>
I know Iron Blood gave us a hand with our own base, and that we should help those in need...<br>
But nobody said you yourself need to go, nor that you had to go at once.<br>
They've built a fortress out there, like the Eagle Union. I think they're able to defend themselves.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Sovetsky Soyuz：</span><br>
You're right.<br>
Iron Blood does not need our assistance. That was clear from the moment they sent us advice instead of a request for help.<br>
Having said that, I see this as a good opportunity to do some reconnaissance.<br>
Now that Bismarck has returned, what strategies does Iron Blood employ? What is their organization like out in this vast desert of snow?<br>
Are their projects from the Friedrich era still ongoing? Has their stance on cooperating with us changed?<br>
These are just some of the things I'd like to know. Things you can't just ask through regularly scheduled messages.<br>
Thus, I want to be proactive and emphasize upfront that cooperation is in both our best interests.<br>
They won't have any reason to refuse help since, naturally, this follows Comrade Commander's principles.<br>
And then there's the mysterious enemy that attacked. I must look into that sooner or later anyway.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Pamiat' Merkuria：</span><br>
Yeah, exactly!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Svirepy：</span><br>
Basically, it's gettin' a lot of shit done at once. Efficient! However you cut it, there's no loss in Soyuz going.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ognevoy：</span><br>
Hey! Look! There's a bunch of buildings over there! I think that's Iron Blood's base!<br>
<br>
The girls cast their gazes to where Ognevoy pointed. There was a cluster of Iron Blood buildings, rising from the ice field like concrete shells.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Poltava：</span><br>
It certainly looks like a military complex. Compare that to our little research station.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Svirepy：</span><br>
Ain't it kinda overkill, though?<br>
Like, ya don't need a sturdy fortress in Antarctica. Siren attacks are so rare out here.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Sovetsky Soyuz：</span><br>
It seems unlikely that it's JUST a research station or a safety measure in case of a Siren invasion.<br>
(Something about this is fishy. Perhaps Friedrich is still in our branch...)<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Pamiat' Merkuria：</span><br>
Heehee. Something happened in Antarctica, Soyuz.<br>
Do you wanna know what?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Sovetsky Soyuz：</span><br>
Huh? What are you talking–<br>
...about? What is this?<br>
Pamiat'?<br>
<br>
Soyuz was standing completely still, yet the scenery around her changed in an instant.<br>
Pamiat' and the rest of her comrades were gone. In their place, a city made of steel towered in the distance.<br>
Its scale was almost unbelievable. It wasn't so much that the ice field surrounded the city, but rather that the city surrounded the ice field.<br>
Its border stretched from horizon to horizon, and it didn't stop there. Soyuz looked down and realized she was standing not on snow and rock, but rather on metallic pavement.<br>
She was on the edge of a city that was still growing, consuming the silver landscape around it.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Sovetsky Soyuz：</span><br>
(This entire expanse... has become a fortress.)<br>
(No... Could this be the original form of the place where we're standing now?)<br>
<br>
Soyuz could not help but be astonished by this sudden thought.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Sovetsky Soyuz：</span><br>
(That's impossible... This cannot be real...)<br>
<br>
The scenery changed once more, allowing her no time to digest the thought.<br>
This time, the ground was ablaze and the city was crumbling.<br>
In the sky, a shimmering aurora. The daunting yet splendorous city had collapsed in the blink of an eye.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Sovetsky Soyuz：</span><br>
(What is this? Antarctica's essence? Its truth? Its... future?)<br>
<br>
Yet again, thoughts formed from the blank space in the back of her mind.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Pamiat' Merkuria?：</span><br>
Yes. This is my story. One of the possible futures for this continent.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Sovetsky Soyuz：</span><br>
Phew...<br>
(Was I just hallucinating? Everything is back to normal, looking as it should...)<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Pamiat' Merkuria：</span><br>
Hum-de-dum♪<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Sovetsky Soyuz：</span><br>
Pamiat', what exactly did you mean by "your story"?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Pamiat' Merkuria：</span><br>
My "story"? What are you talking about?<br>
Me and Ognevoy were just having a chat. You must've misheard something I said.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Sovetsky Soyuz：</span><br>
Misheard? But...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Poltava：</span><br>
Are you alright, Soyuz? Are you hearing things?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Sovetsky Soyuz：</span><br>
Not just hearing things. I saw something, too.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Poltava：</span><br>
Audiovisual hallucinations, eh... You did touch that crystal earlier. Maybe that has something to do with it?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Pamiat' Merkuria：</span><br>
Could be! Her very rigging did get restructured. That takes a huge toll on your body and mind.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Sovetsky Soyuz：</span><br>
Yes... You're probably right.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ognevoy：</span><br>
Are you sure you're okay? Should we stop and take a break?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Sovetsky Soyuz：</span><br>
I'm fine, I promise. The base isn't far now, so let's get out of the cold.<br>

<br>
Iron Blood's base was on high alert, ready to respond quickly in case of an enemy invasion.<br>
Getting inside would've been difficult for Soyuz's party, but luckily, a message from Tallinn allowed them inside without much fuss.<br>

Iron Blood Military Camp<br>
Sometime later<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Königsberg：</span><br>
Greetings. I am Königsberg, the head of operations at this base.<br>
Allow me to sincerely thank you, Sovetsky Soyuz and company, for offering us your assistance.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Sovetsky Soyuz：</span><br>
You don't need to thank us. What's the situation?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Königsberg：</span><br>
You've generously come to our aid, and so the least I can do is tell you the facts as they are.<br>
To be honest with you, the situation is quite bad.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ognevoy：</span><br>
(What now? Soyuz said she wanted to do some reconnaissance...)<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Svirepy：</span><br>
(Shh! Don't say everythin' out loud!)<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Königsberg：</span><br>
As I wrote in my message to you, we have lost contact with the research station near the snowmelt area.<br>
The last message we got from them was, "Engaging unidentified enemy."<br>
Shortly after, the signal started being jammed, and we haven't heard anything more from them.<br>
To make matters worse, we also lost contact with our nearest supply base. The jamming cut us off from them, too.<br>
Due to all these problems, I'm afraid we're in no position to provide any hospitality.<br>
I wasn't expecting your group to come all the way out here to speak to us, let alone offer us help.<br>
I see you've also gotten a new rigging, Soyuz... Congratulations.<br>
What brought all of you to Antarctica, anyway? The new crystal that was discovered in the snowmelt area?<br>
I see word about it reached you quickly.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Sovetsky Soyuz：</span><br>
(That confirms it. It WAS the crystal that the Tribunal was talking about.)<br>
Indeed, it was. However, I also wanted to investigate the phenomena that arose following its discovery.<br>
As you know, abnormal weather is often an omen of an impending Siren attack.<br>
Even ignoring that, it's extremely likely that the unidentified enemy is part of a plot against you.<br>
Perhaps it's a Reenactment, perhaps it's a conspiracy...<br>
Whatever the case, I'd like to know how Iron Blood plans to respond. What will you do?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Königsberg：</span><br>
It depends. We've dispatched a team to the site. What they report back will decide our next move.<br>
If I may ask, what do YOU plan to do?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Sovetsky Soyuz：</span><br>
We are going to head straight for the snowmelt area and conduct an investigation.<br>
It's clear that the abnormal weather and the unidentified enemy are linked to the crystal.<br>
Therefore, a direct investigation will hopefully bring a swift end to this situation.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Königsberg：</span><br>
That's quite brave of you.<br>
I sadly don't have any intel to share on the mysterious enemy, but I will say this...<br>
Please be careful out there.<br>
If I find out anything new, I'll contact you immediately.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Sovetsky Soyuz：</span><br>
Thank you. Likewise, we will let you know if we find anything of note.<br>
Also, I have a proposition to make.<br>
Given that Antarctica is fairly isolated from any faction's sphere of influence, it's hard to argue humanity has a strong presence here.<br>
In the event that a problem arises, I believe all factions present should unite to deal with it.<br>
To facilitate this, I propose an agreement to share what information we gather with other factions as well.<br>
I'm sure that, if present here, Comrade Commander would've suggested the same thing.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Königsberg：</span><br>
Sure. I'm okay with that.<br>
To think you brought up the Commander... Well, I suppose hearing it does convince people.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Sovetsky Soyuz：</span><br>
I'd also like to propose an evacuation plan, in case of a disaster.<br>
We have a special submarine that has the capacity to evacuate all the personnel stationed here.<br>
If we can control the situation, I would like this place to serve as the stronghold from which we conduct all our plans to neutralize the enemy.<br>
But, in the worst-case scenario, I suggest that everyone stationed here gathers at our research station. Then we may evacuate using our submarine.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Königsberg：</span><br>
That is very generous of you.<br>
To tell you the truth, this fortress relies almost entirely on automated defense systems. I'm the sole shipgirl stationed here.<br>
Defending this place without the prospect of reinforcements is, frankly, a bad idea.<br>
To put it another way, this is not a hill worth dying on.<br>
I agree to your evacuation plan.<br>
Should this situation develop into a crisis, I will head straight to your research station.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Sovetsky Soyuz：</span><br>
Thank you. I'll tell Tallinn so she can make arrangements for your arrival in advance.<br>
That should be everything, I think. We will now make our way to the snowmelt area.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Königsberg：</span><br>
Good luck. Do teach the enemy a thing or two about attacking us.<br>

Antarctica<br>
En Route to the Snowmelt Area<br>
Sometime later<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Pamiat' Merkuria：</span><br>
Pfft...<br>
Ahahah! I can't believe Königsberg believed that!<br>
She really thought Soyuz's rigging just got a little upgrade, rather than being rebuilt from scratch using that crystal!<br>
I bet she'd also believe it if we said this gear is all mining and survey gear!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Poltava：</span><br>
It didn't seem like she knew the Eagle Union had dispatched a huge fleet either.<br>
Either the signal jamming has left her completely clueless, or she was hiding something from us.<br>
Then again, Iron Blood's base is the closest to the crystals, so maybe she's just been blinded by overconfidence.<br>
...You know, I still can't believe the Eagle Union sent such a large fleet. And not just mass-produced ships either, but shipgirls.<br>
Soyuz, I know there's something you're not telling us.<br>
This isn't just about the crystals. You're looking for something else near the snowmelt area.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Sovetsky Soyuz：</span><br>
...So you realized.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Poltava：</span><br>
I knew something was up. You wouldn't travel across the world with a nonfunctional rigging just to see a quarry.<br>
Tell us already. What ARE you here for?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Sovetsky Soyuz：</span><br>
I'm sorry. I should have told you sooner. Königsberg, too.<br>
In fact, I was supposed to explain this shortly after we arrived on the continent.<br>
This led to that, and, well... But you've brought it up now, and we have some time before we reach our destination.<br>
Let me start by saying that the Eagle Union almost certainly doesn't know what I'm about to tell you.<br>
There is a shelter beneath the snowmelt area. Its construction was a joint effort between us and Iron Blood.<br>
It is a doomsday bunker a thousand meters below the surface. It was built to protect all the people inside no matter what calamity was unfolding on the surface.<br>
Its name is, "The Ring of the Wise."<br>
Naturally, I have no reason to believe it had anything to do with the discovery of the rigging-enhancing crystal...<br>
However, it might just be the reason why the snow on the surface has started melting.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Poltava：</span><br>
I'll be damned.<br>
A bunker of ours was responsible for the snowmelt.<br>
Königsberg seemed completely unaware of it. I take it this is highly classified intel, then?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Sovetsky Soyuz：</span><br>
It is. I suspect that even you had never heard a word about it until now.<br>
As it should be. Owing to its secret nature, only a very small handful of shipgirls know about its existence.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Svirepy：</span><br>
A bunker's the cause of it, eh... I thought we had another unsolvable case on our hands.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Pamiat' Merkuria：</span><br>
Happens all too often that a cool mystery has a boring explanation.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Sovetsky Soyuz：</span><br>
Let's not jump to conclusions. We don't yet KNOW if the Ring created the snowmelt area.<br>
It shouldn't be able to. It's in a dormant state right now.<br>
The only way it could cause snowmelt on this scale is if someone deliberately activated and modified certain facilities.<br>
Then there is the unidentified enemy and the crystal. Those obviously weren't there during the construction or planning stage.<br>
(If other factions are allowed to investigate freely, it's only a matter of time before they discover the bunker.)<br>
(Even if the Commander covers for us, Naval HQ will nail us for it.)<br>
We have to get to the bottom of all this. This is one mission I cannot sit out on.<br>

<br>
Antarctica<br>
Site of Unusual Weather - Snowmelt Area<br>
Sometime later<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ognevoy：</span><br>
Hey... Does anyone else hear that? There's a river nearby!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Svirepy：</span><br>
That ain't no river, that's a waterfall! Multiple of 'em, even!<br>
How the hell is there running water this near the South Pole?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Poltava：</span><br>
It's the snowmelt, no? It's revealing the mountains underneath.<br>
Tallinn wasn't kidding. I know she wasn't, but now that I'm seeing it with my own eyes...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Sovetsky Soyuz：</span><br>
It's not just melting the snow on the surface. Underground rivers are forming inside the mountain... The bunker has to be doing this.<br>
Please be careful. The ice has become unstable.<br>
Watch your footing as we ascend this mountain.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ognevoy：</span><br>
Ugh! Why does our adventure in the snow have to include climbing a mountain?! I'm so tireeed!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Svirepy：</span><br>
*pant*... *pant*...<br>
This sucks ass... Shipgirls were made to travel seas, not mountainsides!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ognevoy：</span><br>
Oh! Svirepy, look at that glowy stuff over there! I think that's the mineral we came here for!<br>
<br>
A crystal jutted out from the mountain. Surrounded by black rock, its blue glow was unmistakable.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Poltava：</span><br>
That blue light... Interesting. It's small, but this shows that there are deposits of it even on the surface.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Svirepy：</span><br>
Huh... It's surrounded by ice. Ya think it's got some kinda ambient coolin' effect?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ognevoy：</span><br>
Wow! It's like a fridge, but prettier!<br>
You could put it in a cooler box with some ice cream and take it anywhere without it melting!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Pamiat' Merkuria：</span><br>
We should bring a bunch home. So long, refrigerators – your services are no longer needed!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Poltava：</span><br>
Come on, people. Refrigeration is not what we want them for. These are rigging superchargers.<br>
Just look at what one did to Soyuz's rigging. If we study them, we can give all of you fancy new riggings.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Svirepy：</span><br>
New riggings? Oh, hell yeah, baby.<br>
So if I touch it, will it restructure mine, too?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Sovetsky Soyuz：</span><br>
Wait! Don't–<br>
<br>
Soyuz's words weren't quick enough. Svirepy picked up the fist-sized crystal and held it with both hands.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ognevoy：</span><br>
W-well? How do you feel, Svirepy?!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Svirepy：</span><br>
Oooowch! My frickin' hands! S-so cold!<br>
Ow... Besides giving me frostbite, I don't think it did anything. I still feel the same.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Poltava：</span><br>
No surprise there. Tallinn already said touching it doesn't really do anything.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Pamiat' Merkuria：</span><br>
Maybe it needs to be bigger. Or some condition have to be met? Who knows what you need to do!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Sovetsky Soyuz：</span><br>
We don't have time for this right now. Let's leave that crystal behind.<br>
The snowmelt has reached much further than I initially expected.<br>
We need to get inside the Ring ASAP and investigate what's wrong with it.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Svirepy：</span><br>
You said it's, like, a thousand meters underground, right? Shouldn't we be goin' DOWN, not up?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Sovetsky Soyuz：</span><br>
It is deep down, yes, but the entrance is up there. The rock provides a stable foundation and a mountain is a good landmark for finding it amid all this snow and ice.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Pamiat' Merkuria：</span><br>
Hasn't the snowmelt, y'know, changed the terrain? Like, a lot? You sure you remember where the entrance is supposed to be?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Sovetsky Soyuz：</span><br>
...No, I'm afraid I don't.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Pamiat' Merkuria：</span><br>
You DON'T?! So what are we gonna do? Search the whole mountain from top to bottom?!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Sovetsky Soyuz：</span><br>
That won't be necessary. There's an identification device near the entrance. If it's active, it should respond to this transmitter I have.<br>
Remember, be on your guard for the as-of-yet unidentified enemy.<br>
The search for the entrance commences now.<br>
{{折叠面板|内容结束}}

{{折叠面板|标题=The Ring of the Wise|选项=10|主框=1|样式=primary|展开=是}}
<br>
After some searching, Soyuz successfully located the entrance to the bunker.<br>
The party caught their breaths after all that mountain-climbing before proceeding inside.<br>
Antarctica<br>
Snowmelt Area<br>
The Ring of the Wise - Bunker Entrance<br>
The sound of gears grinding together. Slowly, the steel blast doors opened like the jaws of some giant.<br>
Inside, they didn't find what they were expecting. Not a corridor large enough to drive a tank through, no winding paths reminiscent of a maze, not even cutting-edge machinery.<br>
All there was was an office. In addition to all the usual furnishings, it was covered in a layer of dust, having not been used for so long.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Svirepy：</span><br>
This... is lame as hell.<br>
I imagined somethin' way cooler when you called this a "doomsday bunker."<br>
I mean, come on! This looks like any old naval facility I've been to.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Pamiat' Merkuria：</span><br>
Aha, I've got it! It was designed to look boring!<br>
Because it looks so boring, people who don't know any better will go, "Meh, just another Northern Parliament base," and write it off!<br>
But that's exactly what we want them to think. There's gotta be another entrance to the REAL bunker, right?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Sovetsky Soyuz：</span><br>
...Yes, you are correct. This office is only a facade.<br>
The real entrance is this way. Come with me.<br>
<br>
To the surprise of nobody, there was a hidden space behind the bookcase. It moved aside, revealing the true entrance.<br>
After traversing a long corridor and passing through many blast-resistant roller shutters, the girls finally arrived at an elevator that would take them down to the bunker.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Sovetsky Soyuz：</span><br>
All we need to do is get off at the right floor and we'll gain access to the Ring.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ognevoy：</span><br>
Wait, the "right" floor? What happens if we get off on the wrong one?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Sovetsky Soyuz：</span><br>
You don't want to know.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Svirepy：</span><br>
C'mon, you HAVE to admit THIS is overkill. This bunker is hidden in the middle of nowhere on a barren continent, behind layers of security and facades...<br>
Do you NEED a trapped elevator, too? Nobody's gonna breach this.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Sovetsky Soyuz：</span><br>
Wrong. Not only has someone already breached it, they have also already activated the bunker's facilities.<br>
Have you noticed how the temperature has been slowly rising?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ognevoy：</span><br>
I have! It's warm and cozy in here! Just like back at the research station!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Svirepy：</span><br>
Oh, yeah, it's not cold anymore. Happened so gradually I didn't even notice...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Sovetsky Soyuz：</span><br>
Yes, the heating has been running since long before we arrived here. The temperature wouldn't be so stable if it hadn't.<br>
However, the snowmelt on the scale we saw outside couldn't possibly have happened simply by someone starting up the bunker's systems.<br>
Someone, for some reason, activated some part of this facility. This has been all but confirmed at this point.<br>
Please stick together once we're inside. We're heading to the security room first of all.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Everyone：</span><br>
Roger!<br>
<br>
The elevator looked quite old, and yet to everyone's surprise, it brought them to the bunker's interior both faster and quieter than they thought.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ognevoy：</span><br>
Sheesh! Did you see how fast that was?!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Svirepy：</span><br>
Huh. Guess this place isn't just like ANY old bunker.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Poltava：</span><br>
The architect may have had fun with its design, but it was built with utility first in mind.<br>
This was all cutting-edge tech at the time. The only quaint thing about it is its looks.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Svirepy：</span><br>
Uh-huh... So we're a thousand meters deep now, yeah?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Pamiat' Merkuria：</span><br>
Doubt it. That was only about twenty storeys. I think we'll have to change to another mode of transport.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Sovetsky Soyuz：</span><br>
Correct. We will need to pass through a few more in-between areas before we finally enter the main part of the bunker.<br>
The path will take us through many layers of security and multiple elevators.<br>
One of which is the area up ahead.<br>
I will go into the security room and gather the info we need. The rest of you, please wait here.<br>
<br>
A while later, Soyuz returned to her waiting comrades.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Poltava：</span><br>
Took you a while. Did you have trouble finding the stuff?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Sovetsky Soyuz：</span><br>
No, it actually went extremely well. There were some interesting things on the security logs.<br>
Unfortunately... they were also quite confusing.<br>
According to the logs, the bunker has been active since long before the snowmelt area appeared.<br>
Beyond the dwelling area, a few manufacturing areas were activated as well. However, there were no logs of what was manufactured.<br>
Additionally, the shelter's control system has been scanning all this time and still is. It's generated an enormous amount of reports.<br>
I tried to see who ordered the scan, but this was also not in the data logs.<br>
All security systems – cameras included – haven't detected anything, much less sounded an alarm.<br>
Assuming an intruder is behind this, they know this place inside out.<br>
They have to, since they had the high clearance needed to activate the facilities AND erased all trace of themselves having been here.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Poltava：</span><br>
So someone who has high clearance and knows about this shelter... Could it be someone from the Intelligence Bureau?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Sovetsky Soyuz：</span><br>
That's absolutely impossible. I am the only person who knows how to delete records from the database.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Poltava：</span><br>
Then maybe someone hacked their way in?<br>
Melting the ice, running the scans... What if the intruder was using the bunker to look for veins of that crystal?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Sovetsky Soyuz：</span><br>
That's... plausible. Let us look for evidence.<br>
There are two areas to prioritize.<br>
First, the manufacturing area – the intruder made something there. Second, the data center – where you can view the results of all those scans.<br>
Of course, we have areas further down to explore, but let's take things one at a time.<br>
Proceed with caution and keep your eyes peeled.<br>
{{折叠面板|内容结束}}

{{折叠面板|标题=Ice, Rock, and Sand|选项=11|主框=1|样式=primary|展开=是}}
<br>
The shipgirls proceeded deeper into the shelter.<br>
As Soyuz said, they had to traverse through many security areas and ride several elevators.<br>
Then, they followed a long corridor and boarded a shuttle system.<br>
Now, at long last, they had reached their destination – the manufacturing area.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Svirepy：</span><br>
Urgh, this place is drivin' me nuts...<br>
It's one thing to have security checkpoints between areas and multiple elevators, but a frickin' SHUTTLE?! Come on, you must be joking!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Pamiat' Merkuria：</span><br>
Listen, this isn't some small missile silo. It's an enormous complex.<br>
If you could just ride an elevator all the way down to the bottom, you might as well get rid of all the security 'cause it could be so easily bypassed.<br>
Getting confused by the bunker's layout? Guess what, that's on purpose. If you feel lost, imagine how lost an intruder would feel.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Svirepy：</span><br>
Good point. Breaking in would be one thing, but breaking out would be much harder.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ognevoy：</span><br>
I'm... I'm running out of breath here...<br>
I've never walked underground this long before... I miss seeing the sky...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Sovetsky Soyuz：</span><br>
Hang in there. We're almost at the underground cave system.<br>
That is where the heart of the bunker is located. We can take a break there.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ognevoy：</span><br>
Wait... underground cave system?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Pamiat' Merkuria：</span><br>
Yup! People have been saying for a long time that there's a sea underneath Antarctica's ice sheets.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ognevoy：</span><br>
Come again? An UNDERGROUND sea?!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Sovetsky Soyuz：</span><br>
Yes, it's true.<br>
From a geographical viewpoint, the possibility of a subglacial sea in Antarctica has long been theorized.<br>
Then, when we constructed this bunker, we found actual evidence for the theory.<br>
You'll see it for yourself once we arrive at the Ring.<br>
First, though, we're going to find out what the intruder made in the manufacturing area.<br>
The production line is just up ahead. Let's hurry.<br>
<br>
The girls arrived in front of a roller shutter in the hallway connecting to the manufacturing area. As soon as it opened, a cold wind rushed out.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Svirepy：</span><br>
Achoo! Sh-shit, that's cold!<br>
We're still underground, ain't we? Why isn't the AC workin'?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Poltava：</span><br>
This place is being cooled, not heated. Strange. It shouldn't be too cold at this depth, but it's as chilly as it was on the surface.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Sovetsky Soyuz：</span><br>
It's a production feature. The environmental temperature is optimized over in manufacturing, so it's not surprising that the temperature may not be very comfortable.<br>
Anyway, let's turn off the cooling and switch on the lights.<br>
<br>
The lamps came on in sequence, casting a warming light over the dark area, slowly revealing more and more of it.<br>
Before them was Production Line HL-17-36.<br>
This was but one of hundreds of manufacturing lines inside the bunker, and its scale was on par with that of a standard factory. A Zemlya Design Bureau factory, to be precise.<br>
Originally, this line was designed to produce mainly land vehicles for traversing ice fields and machine parts.<br>
That was not what was being produced now, however. The production line was creating something else and transporting it up into the bunker's superstructure.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Poltava：</span><br>
What on Earth is going on here?<br>
The machines are taking ice, rock, and sand... and using them to create those crystals!<br>
The crystals are manmade?! How is that possible?!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Svirepy：</span><br>
This doesn't make any sense...<br>
Those crystals discovered in the snowmelt area... they came from here? They were made in a bunker? A bunker that WE built?<br>
And outta ice and rock, too!<br>
How the hell do you create crystals out of rock and ice?!<br>
Soyuz, are these crystals the real deal? They can't be, right?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ognevoy：</span><br>
This has to be alchemy... Or black magic, or something!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Sovetsky Soyuz：</span><br>
No... These crystals are genuine. The production line has been repurposed to produce them through some mysterious means.<br>
It doesn't seem like we'll learn how, either. The manufacturing machines have all been destroyed from the inside, and there are no logs left...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Poltava：</span><br>
Destroyed from the inside? When?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Sovetsky Soyuz：</span><br>
The moment we entered this area, I believe. Most likely, the change in temperature served as a trigger for the logs and machines to self-destruct.<br>
I'm afraid that we won't find anything useful here beyond more crystal samples.<br>
<br>
With a sudden loud bang, the production line came to a complete stop.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Poltava：</span><br>
My hopes were low, but I didn't expect we'd have THIS poor luck...<br>
Ognevoy might be right. What happened here falls in the domain of magic.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Sovetsky Soyuz：</span><br>
Yes, I can't begin to grasp it either. All we know is that it DID happen.<br>
Through some means, the ice and rock were combined to form the crystals, which were then carried to the surface.<br>
We will need to conduct research into how this was done, and how the mechanism behind the rigging resonance works.<br>
We didn't find much here, so it's time to try the data center. I hope we'll find what we're looking for there.<br>

<br>
The elevator's descent slowed, gently stopping at the correct floor.<br>
That isn't to say they had reached the data center, only that they had reached a short hallway connecting to the next elevator.<br>
The only thing setting this cold, boring corridor apart from all others they had seen was the numbers painted on the wall.<br>
They expected more of the same beyond the next door. They were wrong.<br>
This time, something was different.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ognevoy：</span><br>
Huh? This is new. This corridor is furnished with pretty wallpaper.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Svirepy：</span><br>
And there's a nice carpet, a chandelier, even expensive furniture...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Poltava：</span><br>
Interesting. This must be where they keep their best stuff.<br>
Soyuz, does this bunker have an art storage area? For preserving important works of art, I mean.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Sovetsky Soyuz：</span><br>
It's... not a stretch to say it has something similar to that.<br>
But it isn't this place, and the art certainly wouldn't be out on display.<br>
The art could have been relocated, but if it was, this isn't where it would all go.<br>
<br>
The shipgirls looked down the long corridor and saw a few paintings adorning the walls. It was almost like an art gallery.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Pamiat' Merkuria：</span><br>
What do we do, Soyuz? I don't see any other way forward.<br>
While we're at it, we might as well check out the paintings on display, right?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Sovetsky Soyuz：</span><br>
I don't see why not. Let's look at them briefly.<br>
(The furniture lining the hallway looks quite old. They must be antiques from the Imperiya era, before the Northern Parliament's inception.)<br>
(I don't recognize these paintings, though. They seem valuable, but I have no idea when or where they're from.)<br>
(Did the intruder put them here? Did they want to show us something?)<br>
(Let's play along, I suppose. Perhaps these paintings will give us an insight into the intruder's character.)<br>
Right. Follow me.<br>
<br>
Soyuz's team walked down the corridor-turned-art gallery.<br>
They looked at a wall with four paintings hanging on it, above which was a label with the words "Morning Sun" on it, suggesting a shared theme.<br>

'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项4）</span>'''''I'm guessing this museum was built to celebrate victory against the Sirens.<br>

The girls continued down the ornate corridor.<br>
They saw another four paintings, seemingly grouped together under a label that said, "Setting Sun."<br>

'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项1："The Limping Giant"</span>'''''<br>

<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Poltava：</span><br>

<br>
The group went even further down the art gallery.<br>
Once again, there was a collection of four paintings sharing a theme, above which was a label that said, "Utopia."<br>

'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项1："Magnificent Palace"</span>'''''<br>

<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Poltava：</span><br>
The label is on the money. This sure looks like a utopia.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ognevoy：</span><br>
A utopia is our goal, too! It's what we're all working toward!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Svirepy：</span><br>
Well... Yeah, but doin' that and makin' peace with the Sirens are kinda mutually exclusive.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Pamiat' Merkuria：</span><br>
Soyuz, what do you think about all these paintings?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Sovetsky Soyuz：</span><br>
I can appreciate the author's ideas. It's not strange why someone would want to preserve these works of art.<br>
As for the subjects themselves, some of them warrant caution whilst some others are plainly absurd.<br>
Art is art, so I don't think my personal opinion of them matters much.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Pamiat' Merkuria：</span><br>
Uh-huh. And beyond that?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Sovetsky Soyuz：</span><br>
Beyond that?<br>
If you're asking me about the author, then frankly, I can't make any kind of guess as to who that might be.<br>
More precisely, I don't have enough information to work with.<br>
I think we've spent long enough here. Let's head to the data center.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Pamiat' Merkuria：</span><br>
Wait, Soyuz–<br>
...Hmph. Fine! Let's go!<br>

<br>
The Ring of the Wise. It was a doomsday bunker, built under the Antarctic ice inside an underground sea.<br>
The shipgirls looked out across the breathtaking landscape. Save for Soyuz, who was involved with the construction, amazement welled in all their hearts.<br>
Water as far as the eye could see below, a sky of shimmering blue ice overhead, and rock formations more striking than they had ever imagined.<br>
They were feeling ecstatic, finally free from the bunker's sterile interiors.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ognevoy：</span><br>
It's so cute... No, I mean, so beautiful!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Svirepy：</span><br>
Beautiful ain't it, either! WEIRD is what it is! Don't forget that this is underground!<br>
Why the hell are there mountains and a sea down here? There's even a sky, a horizon, and some kinda mist... This is freaky no matter how you cut it.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Sovetsky Soyuz：</span><br>
"Underground" isn't quite right. Technically, we're under an ice sheet.<br>
As for the "sea," it likely came about from ice melting inside this natural cave.<br>
It's not wrong to say that this place is strange, though, because it really is.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ognevoy：</span><br>
What's over there, where the mist is all thick?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Svirepy：</span><br>
And what's under the surface? How deep's the water? Does anythin' live down there?<br>
Are there any living fossils? You know, like coelacanths!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Sovetsky Soyuz：</span><br>
I don't know.<br>
We never did investigate the surrounding area much since the bunker has lay unused for the most.<br>
If by any chance the intruder scanned it, we can hope to learn more about this place.<br>
...That is, assuming they didn't delete everything.<br>
At any rate, the Ring's data center is in the building just ahead. Let's hurry.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Svirepy：</span><br>
Hahah! Feels good to finally sprint across the water again!<br>
Time to "see" what this sea has got in store for us!<br>

<br>
Ring of the Wise - Ring Area<br>
Data Center<br>
Sometime later<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Sovetsky Soyuz：</span><br>
Phew. Fortunately, I've managed to recover some of the data.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Poltava：</span><br>
That's great news. So, what'd you find?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Sovetsky Soyuz：</span><br>
I learned a few things about the geography of the snowmelt area and the manufacturing of those crystals.<br>
I can confirm now that the crystals were indeed produced inside HL-17-36 and transported to the surface.<br>
As for the snowmelt area, the bunker's heat dissipation system was behind it after all. The heat was directed toward the area after a certain amount of crystals had been delivered to the surface.<br>
Therefore, whoever produced these crystals also melted the ice around the dropoff point so they would inevitably be discovered.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Poltava：</span><br>
So they went out of their way to make it look like an anomalous phenomenon.<br>
But why? Why do any of this?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Sovetsky Soyuz：</span><br>
Most likely to spark a conflict between factions, using the crystals as bait. Or maybe they wanted to expose the bunker's existence to the world to block the Azur Lane from reforming.<br>
As I was about to say... I also found info on some scan scans the intruder ran.<br>
Apparently, before they even started producing the crystals, they released underwater exploration drones into this sea.<br>
It stands to reason they were looking for something under the water. They left behind quite a lot of survey data.<br>
The drones initially sent in regular monitoring data. Initially.<br>
After some point, the feeds started going offline, and as time passed, eventually all connection with the drones was lost.<br>
Currently, there are zero operational drones in the water.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Poltava：</span><br>
That can't be a coincidence. I think something attacked them.<br>
Maybe something that's been living in this place since it formed millions of years ago...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Svirepy：</span><br>
So we ARE dealin' with a million-year-old sea monster...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Pamiat' Merkuria：</span><br>
Roooar!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Svirepy & Ognevoy：</span><br>
AAAAAHHHH!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ognevoy：</span><br>
What was that for?! You're so mean!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Pamiat' Merkuria：</span><br>
You two just looked sooo cute, eyes sparkling, and I couldn't help myself!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Svirepy：</span><br>
Don't call me "cute," asshat!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Pamiat' Merkuria：</span><br>
Ahahaha! Don't be so mad! Come here and let me apologize by way of a big hug.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ognevoy：</span><br>
Okay, I forgive you!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Svirepy：</span><br>
I don't want a damn hug!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Pamiat' Merkuria：</span><br>
Ahahahaha♪<br>
<br>
The girls' silly antics helped to lighten the tense mood.<br>
Meanwhile, the adults had a look around. Poltava found a tablet, which she gave to Soyuz.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Poltava：</span><br>
It looks like it's been used. It was just lying there on the table.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Sovetsky Soyuz：</span><br>
Interesting... It might have been the intruder. Let me have a look.<br>
<br>
Unsurprisingly, the intruder had put a lock on the tablet.<br>
Then, Soyuz got an idea. She could use her administrator access.<br>
She tried to lift the lock on the device, and then...<br>
Again, her surroundings all changed in an instant.<br>
She took it surprisingly well. After all, she had already experienced it once before when she touched the crystal.<br>
Or maybe she had simply accustomed to it – these tremors in reality – that she had been getting ever since she left the research station.<br>
Whichever it was, she wasn't too shocked... until she saw that tower.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Sovetsky Soyuz：</span><br>
Is that... a Siren's mainframe?!<br>
<br>
Across the horizon, a black tower with a frightening red eye reached high into the heavens.<br>
Light radiated from its crown, spreading out across the sky like great ripples in a lake.<br>
Following Compiler's defeat, Soyuz studied the information that the Commander had shared with her.<br>
She was certain of what she was looking at. This was the inside of a Mirror Sea where a mainframe was stored.<br>
She was also certain of – and in shock from – the one right in front of her.<br>
A rigging shaped like an octopus grabbed hold of Soyuz with its tentacles.<br>
Its apparent master, a dainty little girl at its center, extended a hand toward her.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Sovetsky Soyuz：</span><br>
You're... Observer!<br>
<br>
It felt like pressure was acting on her from every direction. Her body couldn't move as she wanted.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Sovetsky Soyuz：</span><br>
I can't move... My rigging... Why can't I move?<br>
You... It's your jamming, isn't it?<br>
Shit... The tentacles are crushing me... Can't breathe... I...<br>
<br>
Just as she was on the brink of falling unconscious, Soyuz looked at Observer's face.<br>
Hidden behind her many tentacles, she looked as though... she was in pain.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Sovetsky Soyuz：</span><br>
She's... hurting?<br>
<br>
The target of her jamming was in fact not Soyuz – but rather the tablet.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Sovetsky Soyuz：</span><br>
"SOS"... She's asking... for help?<br>
<br>
An inordinate amount of time passed. Then, the darkness gave way to light.<br>
Soyuz sharpened her focus and saw Poltava, handing her the tablet.<br>
The vision was just that – a vision. Her reality was untouched.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Sovetsky Soyuz：</span><br>
...I'm back again.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Pamiat' Merkuria：</span><br>
"Back"?<br>
Back from where, hmm?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Sovetsky Soyuz：</span><br>
Nowhere. Forget I said it.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Poltava：</span><br>
You okay, Soyuz? You dropped the tablet and looked like you saw a ghost. What happened?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Sovetsky Soyuz：</span><br>
I had another hallucination. Don't worry, I'll be fine. I just need to rest a bit...<br>
<br>
After going through the tablet's contents, Soyuz sat down on a chair to compose her thoughts.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Sovetsky Soyuz：</span><br>
(Was that Observer's mainframe? Iron Blood has said the likelihood is high that her mainframe is somewhere in the Southern Ocean...)<br>
(But that can't be... right? This is too good to be a coincidence. Bismarck, Friedrich...)<br>
(So much of our intel is uncertain. Still, I need to start forming theories.)<br>
(There are three potential suspects for who the intruder is. A Siren, a META, or whoever controlled that Arbiter during the near-superimposition event.)<br>
(They all possess advanced technology. It's also not far-fetched to say they could breach the security here with ease... but my only lead is Observer.)<br>
(The odds that she'd disclose her mainframe's whereabouts of her own volition are as good as zero. So if it's not her, it's someone who's trying to gather everyone here.)<br>
(That's the most plausible theory I've got right now...)<br>
(I don't know who, but SOMEONE has pinpointed the location of her mainframe.)<br>
(This person must've used the bunker's drones to try to find a way inside the Mirror Sea that hosts the mainframe.)<br>
(For one reason or another, they didn't succeed, so they're trying something new – assembling all the factions here.)<br>
(They produced those crystals, brought them to the surface, and leaked intel to Naval HQ to mobilize the Eagle Union. Outside shipgirls would get involved and be used as scapegoats...)<br>
(Ugh... No, this isn't enough. The theory has too many holes.)<br>
(Maybe Observer brought those crystals into existence and is asking for us to rescue her.)<br>
(Maybe someone is showing me these visions to guide our attention to Observer for some reason that would benefit them.)<br>
(Maybe the Sirens are behind it all. They could be trying to turn us against each other to keep us away from Antarctica.)<br>
(What if they're putting us in danger to lure out Comrade Commander...)<br>
(Using the bunker as a means to guide us – to guide the first party to discover the truth...)<br>
(Is that it? Could that be... why Pamiat' is here...)<br>
(I'm not sure of anything anymore. Whatever's really going on here, we can't deal with this situation with this few people.)<br>
(We've got to get out of here immediately and tell the world what we've seen!)<br>
Poltava!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Poltava：</span><br>
Yes? What is it? You look pale.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Sovetsky Soyuz：</span><br>
The snowmelt area, the crystals... I think this is all one big trap.<br>
We need to return to the surface... No, we need to retreat from Antarctica entirely!<br>

<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Helena：</span><br>
Good news, Commander! I just got word from the Tribunal that the Northern Parliament has reached their Antarctic research station!<br>
But the bad news is, all connection has been lost with the Tribunal's on-site monitoring equipment...<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
What? So they have no way of tracking them?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Helena：</span><br>
Seems so. For some reason, all their equipment across Antarctica broke down at the same time.<br>
Clemenceau said it was probably due to jamming. It can't be a coincidence that they ALL went down simultaneously.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Then it's back to the drawing board for me. I'll figure something out.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Helena：</span><br>
Got it. Good luck.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Fleets from all factions are already departing for Antarctica...<br>
If something happens there and we have no way of knowing about it, it'll be a disaster. So, to make sure that doesn't happen...<br>
<br>
Location Unknown<br>
I close my eyes, and a field of stars spread out before me.<br>

You've come, Commander. Have you finally decided to make your move?<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
My hand has been forced. I can't leave the situation in Antarctica to boil over.<br>
Everything was going according to plan... but some bad news just came in.<br>
<span style="color:#ffc960;">Helena META：</span><br>
All contact between Antarctica and the outside world has been cut off. Is that right?<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Correct. Do you think this might be Observer's doing, given her proficiency in electronic interference?<br>
<span style="color:#ffc960;">Helena META：</span><br>
Not quite. This isn't Observer's doing.<br>
But, I still might be able to help you out. Give me a sec.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Appreciate it. But, if it isn't Observer behind this, then who?<br>
<span style="color:#ffc960;">Helena META：</span><br>
You'll find out soon enough.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
I've been hesitant to ask, but... Have you known who the mastermind is from the very beginning?<br>
<span style="color:#ffc960;">Helena META：</span><br>
Naturally. I know who they are, what they've done, and what they're after.<br>
But...<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
But you can't tell me yet, can you?<br>
<span style="color:#ffc960;">Helena META：</span><br>
I'm sorry... This is something you must uncover yourself.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
It's alright, I shouldn't even have brought it up. Some things are better left in the dark, after all.<br>
There's something else I need to take care of too. Can you provide me with a line directly to Saratoga?<br>
As long as we can link up with the Eagle Union fleet, we should be able to keep the situation stable even if enemies show up.<br>
<span style="color:#ffc960;">Helena META：</span><br>
...Isn't there something else you want to ask for?<br>
Remember, Saratoga took this step because she was sure it would help Lexington.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
What do you mean?<br>
<span style="color:#ffc960;">Helena META：</span><br>
Don't you want to save Lexington?<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Yes. Of course I do.<br>
But I can't ask for your help with that. It's something I, myself, have to do.<br>
<span style="color:#ffc960;">Helena META：</span><br>
...Very well.<br>
Initiating strategic interface. Monitoring target: Antarctica. Setting up command system. Connected.<br>
It's time to wake up, Commander.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
I feel bad about borrowing Helena META's powers to do this... but at least this should improve the situation.<br>
Let's see if this command system works despite the massive distance between us.<br>
Helena, Memphis, check something for me. Is the command system over the Antarctic region connected?<br>
Can you tell where everyone is?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Helena：</span><br>
Yes, it's connected! I'm seeing the info!<br>
Wow, the tactical map is updating in real time... There's even a log of recent movements from every faction's fleets.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Memphis：</span><br>
Is all this intel pulled from the Tribunal's monitoring equipment? Sheesh, they patched up their network in no time.<br>
This is amazing. You can command just as well from here as if you were on the scene!<br>
(Psst. How did you get this? Did you... ask the other Helena for help?)<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
(Yeah. Just a little.)<br>
Right, so, we should check where everyone is right now.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Memphis：</span><br>
Of course. I'll relay the feed to your monitor.<br>
The Northern Parliament has entered the snowmelt area. They've not moved from there for a while, so they must be conducting an investigation on-site.<br>
The Eagle Union iiis... Oh, Saratoga's group is heading for the snowmelt area.<br>
It's looking like everyone's going there in the end, albeit in different orders.<br>
Looks like the Royal Navy is still out on the ocean. They'll probably reach land soon.<br>
On the other hand, Iron Blood hasn't budged from its position. They're still just patrolling the outskirts of the Southern Ocean.<br>
Also, they sent a message about "encountering an unidentified enemy" from their Antarctic base. Maybe that has something to do with it?<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Unidentified enemy, eh... Can you confirm if Königsberg is alright?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Memphis：</span><br>
Sadly not. Still can't connect to the facility.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Okay. Keep monitoring. We'll gather as much intel as we can before we make a move.<br>

Antarctica<br>
Snowmelt Area - Bunker Entrance<br>
Back to the present<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ognevoy：</span><br>
Phew... We made it back to the surface...<br>
I'm surprised by how quick that was. The emergency exit took us straight here.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Poltava：</span><br>
That's what emergency exists are for. Time is of the essence during emergencies.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Svirepy：</span><br>
We shoulda just taken this route in the first place.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Poltava：</span><br>
We couldn't. You can only get the route open from the inside for obvious security reasons.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Svirepy：</span><br>
Whatever. So what do we do now? Head back to Tallinn?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Sovetsky Soyuz：</span><br>
Yes. Then we'll–<br>
Agh!<br>
(Here it comes again...)<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Poltava：</span><br>
Soyuz? What's wrong?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Sovetsky Soyuz：</span><br>
Nothing, I'm okay. Let's take it one thing at a time.<br>
First, we should get back to the research station. After that–<br>
–we'll contact the... others...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Pamiat' Merkuria：</span><br>
Ahahah. How do you like the chicken with truffles?<br>
It's among my favorites, and I've had many of the Imperiya's finest banquet dishes.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Sovetsky Soyuz：</span><br>
Where... am I...?<br>
<br>
Soyuz suddenly found herself sitting at the end of a long table lined for a banquet.<br>
To her front, an assortment of various luxurious dishes. To her sides, palace ornamentation that shone in the candlelight.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Sovetsky Soyuz：</span><br>
(A banquet... in an Imperiya-era palace?)<br>
(I shouldn't be here... I should be with them, evacuating immediately...)<br>
(But... how? Where is the way out?)<br>
(From the Ring of the Wise... take the submarine and go north...)<br>
(Now I get it... The art gallery. It has been whispering to me...)<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Pamiat' Merkuria：</span><br>
Hm? What's the matter? You don't like it?<br>
Alright, then try this turtle soup. I'm sure it'll hit the spot and clear your mind!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Sovetsky Soyuz：</span><br>
I see... I'll help myself, then.<br>
<br>
Thoughts rushed through Soyuz's head. She picked up a spoon, felt it in her hand, and looked at the soup.<br>
She took a small spoonful and let it rest in her mouth.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Sovetsky Soyuz：</span><br>
(I can taste it.)<br>
(This is no mere hallucination... Or perhaps, this space exists at a level far beyond the sensory realm to begin with...)<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Pamiat' Merkuria：</span><br>
Heehee. You must like it, judging from the look on your face.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Sovetsky Soyuz：</span><br>
...I do. It tastes very good.<br>
Pamiat' – if that's who you are – what is this place? Why is there a banquet?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Pamiat' Merkuria：</span><br>
In order – this is my palace, and why the heck not? You're my guest, and I'm being a good host.<br>
Whaddya think? Pretty nice place, right?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Sovetsky Soyuz：</span><br>
I've... never been treated to something like this before.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Pamiat' Merkuria：</span><br>
Right? And there's so much more to do here than just enjoying the endless banquet!<br>
You can walk among flowers, hunt on the ice fields, and play on the beach, just to name a few.<br>
Don't you want to stay here?<br>
<br>
The thoughts in Soyuz's head were starting to feel clearer and clearer.<br>
Delusions crept up on her. That this was reality. That the snowscape she was just in was the real hallucination.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Sovetsky Soyuz：</span><br>
I could... see myself staying here...<br>
But... what about the others?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Pamiat' Merkuria：</span><br>
I can bring them here if you want me to. Then you can all enjoy the eternal Paradise together.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Sovetsky Soyuz：</span><br>
Eternal... Paradise...<br>
<br>
Paradise. Heaven. Elysium. The word was like a calming whisper from Mother Nature.<br>
Another world superimposed itself upon Soyuz's vision.<br>
A world where everyone danced hand-in-hand. A world where flowers bloomed and vodka flowed freely.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Sovetsky Soyuz：</span><br>
A world that will drown me if I let my guard down...<br>
Which is why... I need to snap out of it.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Pamiat' Merkuria：</span><br>
Snap out of what?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Sovetsky Soyuz：</span><br>
This. A world this perfect doesn't exist – not yet.<br>
This place is pure escapism. Its only purpose is to make people give up and stop dreaming of better things.<br>
Those who buy into it have no commitment to fight for humanity, and they certainly are no comrades of mine.<br>
<br>
Pamiat's world seemed to tremble. A crack spread across her utopia.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Pamiat' Merkuria：</span><br>
But isn't this exactly the kind of world you're fighting for?<br>
Who cares if it's real or not! It doesn't matter if it's escapism!<br>
You can save the people you care about, Soyuz! Take them away from the fighting and the suffering and let them live in happiness forever!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Sovetsky Soyuz：</span><br>
Who do you take me for? Someone who'd give up on her ideals and her duty to wallow in a fantasy?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Pamiat' Merkuria：</span><br>
No! It's not giving up on anything! It's just taking a shortcut to your destination!<br>
Don't you see it?! Your dream, your duty, is to create a world like this!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Sovetsky Soyuz：</span><br>
All I see is a person who doesn't understand anything.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Pamiat' Merkuria：</span><br>
No, I guess I don't! Because YOU don't make any sense to me!<br>
I once knew people who talked big. About dreams, ideals, and missions. They all sacrificed themselves.<br>
And you know what they got in return? NOTHING!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Sovetsky Soyuz：</span><br>
Even if self-sacrifice for your ideals doesn't result in immediate change, it will invariably lead to a brighter future.<br>
You will never reach that future if nobody makes difficult choices.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Pamiat' Merkuria：</span><br>
But who says you and your comrades have to be the sacrifice?<br>
...I don't understand you. You're always the same, no matter the era.<br>
There's nothing wrong in living for your own sake, in wanting a future where you and only those you care about survive...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Sovetsky Soyuz：</span><br>
Isn't it time you showed who you really are, "Pamiat' Merkuria"?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Pamiat' Merkuria：</span><br>
......<br>
Aww, you still saw through me so easily.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Sovetsky Soyuz：</span><br>
Show me. What is your true identity?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Pamiat' Merkuria：</span><br>
Ahahaha! Come on. You already know...<br>
<span style="color:#ffc960;">Pamiat' Merkuria META：</span><br>
...Who's under the mask.<br>
{{折叠面板|内容结束}}

{{折叠面板|标题=A Touch of Snow|选项=17|主框=1|样式=primary|展开=是}}
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Sovetsky Soyuz：</span><br>
You're... Pamiat' Merkuria META.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Pamiat' Merkuria：</span><br>
I told you you already knew.<br>
<br>
The girl on the opposite side of the golden dining room spoke loudly and clearly.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Pamiat' Merkuria：</span><br>
I am Pamiat'. A Pamiat' from a story in the distant past.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Sovetsky Soyuz：</span><br>
What did you do to Pamiat' from my branch?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Pamiat' Merkuria：</span><br>
Hmm. Looks like the cognitive influence hasn't completely worn off yet.<br>
Welp, seeing as it's not gonna work, might as well ditch the disguise altogether.<br>
The air gets all stuffy in this palace. Why don't we pop outside?<br>
<br>
In an instant, the golden palace vanished, being replaced by a plain of silvery snow stretching as far as the eye could see.<br>
Soyuz's brain fog was blown away by a freezing breeze. Her mind cleared, she could now get a good look at the girl in front of her.<br>
At the girl who suddenly appeared when they arrived in Antarctica. The girl who had no reason to be here.<br>
Finally, she realized the source of the unrest brewing inside her–<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Sovetsky Soyuz：</span><br>
Pamiat' is in Europa right now. Right by Comrade Commander's side.<br>
And you, you must've entered the submarine as soon as it crossed into Antarctica.<br>
<span style="color:#ffc960;">Pamiat' Merkuria META：</span><br>
Heehee. That's right, you've been talking to me this whole time.<br>
It was quite fun, you know~ Pretending we were all friends and stuff.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Sovetsky Soyuz：</span><br>
...I didn't find it fun in the slightest.<br>
What is your goal? What are you going to do to my friends?<br>
<span style="color:#ffc960;">Pamiat' Merkuria META：</span><br>
What am I going to "do" to them? Why would I want that?<br>
Is this the difference between how you treat your friends, and how you treat everyone else? What a terribly cold woman you are.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Sovetsky Soyuz：</span><br>
You're not "everyone else." You're my enemy.<br>
I'm not in the mood for small-talk. Answer my question.<br>
<span style="color:#ffc960;">Pamiat' Merkuria META：</span><br>
Ehhh? Enemy?<br>
Just because I'm not YOUR Pamiat' doesn't make me your enemy, right?<br>
C'mon, you're being way too paranoid. I haven't laid a finger on your friends.<br>
Look – you're the only person who I've invited to my castle.<br>
As for what my goal is... Actually, there are three things.<br>
Only one main objective though. The other two are more like side quests.<br>
But, spilling the beans outright would be terribly dull, so I'll have you guess instead.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Sovetsky Soyuz：</span><br>
I see. Then I've wasted enough time on you and I'm leaving this–<br>
<span style="color:#ffc960;">Pamiat' Merkuria META：</span><br>
Wait!<br>
Remember the art gallery? Did it seriously not make you feel ANYTHING?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Sovetsky Soyuz：</span><br>
Oh. So it was you who put the paintings there.<br>
And it was you who set off these events – because you're the one who's after Observer's mainframe.<br>
<span style="color:#ffc960;">Pamiat' Merkuria META：</span><br>
Ding, ding, ding!<br>
Boy, using her as bait sure yielded a huge catch! Not that it matters. You're the only one I invited.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Sovetsky Soyuz：</span><br>
Why only me?<br>
<span style="color:#ffc960;">Pamiat' Merkuria META：</span><br>
Because I'm interested in you.<br>
I've heard how you preach about your motherland's ideals and beliefs, and I wondered if they'd change or not when you were exposed to a wider world.<br>
The things in those paintings were all real. I saw and heard them with my own eyes and ears.<br>
How does that make you feel, Soyuz?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Sovetsky Soyuz：</span><br>
I suppose you've lived a life full of high highs and low lows.<br>
I wish I could see what your home world was like...<br>
But more than anything else, your malicious intentions offend me.<br>
<span style="color:#ffc960;">Pamiat' Merkuria META：</span><br>
Uh-huh. So, what's your answer to my invitation?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Sovetsky Soyuz：</span><br>
Do I even need to answer?<br>
The wheels of time are always moving forward. New worlds are born, and old ones die. It's inevitable, unavoidable.<br>
Your desire to linger in the past, to never move on and accept change, sounds insufferable.<br>
<span style="color:#ffc960;">Pamiat' Merkuria META：</span><br>
"Always moving forward"... Sure, but nobody's at the wheel. Nobody gets to choose their own future.<br>
What if we COULD choose, though?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Sovetsky Soyuz：</span><br>
So we could go back in time and go through the same mistakes?<br>
<span style="color:#ffc960;">Pamiat' Merkuria META：</span><br>
Listen. The past is known. Just as there are mistakes, there is glory before the downfall.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Sovetsky Soyuz：</span><br>
There is no hope in stubbornly clinging on to the past.<br>
It is our duty to face the future and march onward, not retreat inward.<br>
<span style="color:#ffc960;">Pamiat' Merkuria META：</span><br>
"Face the future," "march forward," blah blah blah.<br>
You sound exactly like my mortal enemy.<br>
Tell me, what's wrong with a known past?<br>
Abandoning the future is just abandoning uncertainty. The future doesn't always have hope in store, you know.<br>
I've been to many places, and I've learned a lot on the way.<br>
The Imperiya, the Northern Parliament, the Revolutionary Front... They all thrived, and then they all crashed and burned.<br>
No matter who you are, no matter how hard you try, no dynasty will last forever as long as the future exists. You know it to be true.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Sovetsky Soyuz：</span><br>
No matter. My pledge is to the Northern Parliament, and I will keep fighting for its future.<br>
<span style="color:#ffc960;">Pamiat' Merkuria META：</span><br>
Look, I get it. I used to be just like you.<br>
But I know something. There is nothing in that future you're fighting so hard for.<br>
It is empty... just like this blank snowscape.<br>
So what's wrong with choosing the past if the future has nothing for you?<br>
Why shouldn't I hold on to past glories, to when things were good?<br>
What reason is there not to relive those happy moments with your friends in Paradise?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Sovetsky Soyuz：</span><br>
You call that "Paradise"?<br>
Dropped into that single moment in time stretched to infinity, like a lab rat in a cage to be experimented on?<br>
I refuse, "Pamiat'". We've already had to endure a life like that for far too long.<br>
We were bound by the Reenactments, forced to go down a path that was not our own. Now that we forge our own future, we will never go back.<br>
Even should this path lead to destruction, it is something that we created – and fought for. Our destiny is our own, and nothing can take that from us.<br>
It is not something that can be so easily granted by others.<br>
I believe your world was also treated as a test site by the Sirens, just as they see ours?<br>
You can be the happiest little lab rat in the world, but in the end, you still exist only to be used. Surely, you must understand this.<br>
The only way out is to break free from the rules thrust upon you. Seize your own destiny––<br>
<span style="color:#ffc960;">Pamiat' Merkuria META：</span><br>
Stop talking as if you've got everything figured out!<br>
You think we didn't fight hard enough, is that it?!<br>
We fought, and fought, and what did it all amount to? Everyone but me is DEAD!<br>
Look at me! There's nobody else left!<br>
They protected me, and now I carry all their unfulfilled wishes with me!<br>
What gives you the right to lecture me when you haven't seen a fraction of what I've had to endure?<br>
Tell me, no matter how hard we fight, how are ordinary people supposed to overturn fate itself?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Sovetsky Soyuz：</span><br>
...I see. So this is the past that you were forced to endure, Pamiat'.<br>
<span style="color:#ffc960;">Pamiat' Merkuria META：</span><br>
It is. And I was given the chance to choose one more time...<br>
So, I chose to bring back the glory of the past – my home, and my friends.<br>
In a Paradise that I rule over, where we can be together for all of eternity––<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Sovetsky Soyuz：</span><br>
A Paradise that you rule over... The glory of the past...<br>
You know, I heard someone say something very similar not that long ago.<br>
<span style="color:#ffc960;">Pamiat' Merkuria META：</span><br>
Oh yeah? Then you've probably figured out what my first goal is.<br>
{{折叠面板|内容结束}}

{{折叠面板|标题=Advent of Paradise|选项=18|主框=1|样式=primary|展开=是}}
<span style="color:#ffc960;">Pamiat' Merkuria META：</span><br>
Oh yeah? Then you've probably figured out what my first goal is.<br>
<br>
The confrontation in the world of snow continued on.<br>
Realizing that Soyuz had figured out her goal, the so-called Pamiat' graciously revealed her true aims.<br>
<span style="color:#ffc960;">Pamiat' Merkuria META：</span><br>
In that case...<br>
<br>
In an instant, the ice cracked, and an enormous machine rose up.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Sovetsky Soyuz：</span><br>
A Gazer... The false gods...<br>
You're trying to superimpose... the Divine Vestige onto our world?<br>
<span style="color:#ffc960;">Pamiat' Merkuria META：</span><br>
That's not what it's called, silly.<br>
Paradise, Elysium... Utopia. I've tried coming up with a lot of names, but none of them hit right.<br>
What kind of name do you prefer?<br>
<br>
Sometimes wrathful, other times playful, Pamiat' was as mercurial as her name suggested.<br>
But at the same time, Soyuz knew that neither her words nor demeanor were genuine.<br>
More than that, she knew that she couldn't keep letting Pamiat' string her along.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Sovetsky Soyuz：</span><br>
...There's no need for that, "Pamiat'".<br>
You can change its name, but you cannot change its nature.<br>
<span style="color:#ffc960;">Pamiat' Merkuria META：</span><br>
Booooring. I suppose you're tired of chatting with me, huh?<br>
That's too bad. If words won't work, then I guess I'll have to default to force.<br>
<br>
With those words, their conversation drew to a close.<br>
<span style="color:#ffc960;">Pamiat' Merkuria META：</span><br>
Now then, I'll need a moment to get ready!<br>
In the meantime... Feel free to play with my little friends~<br>
Good luck~ and goodbye!<br>
<br>
The table, Pamiat' Merkuria, and the previously encroaching Gazer all dispersed at once.<br>
Soyuz was back in the mountains of Antarctica with her comrades.<br>
It seemed that the argument had all happened in the space of an instant.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Poltava：</span><br>
Pamiat's gone. I must assume she's finished chatting.<br>
So, you were saying? We should get back to the research station and contact the others?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Sovetsky Soyuz：</span><br>
...Right.<br>
Inform Iron Blood, the Eagle Union, and all other forces near Antarctica and surrounding waters that enemy forces have infiltrated and to retreat at once.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Poltava：</span><br>
Understood. Should we... elaborate on who these enemy forces are?<br>
<br>
Poltava and the others' slight confusion reminded Soyuz of what Pamiat' had said – that she'd only invited her. She breathed a sigh of relief.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Sovetsky Soyuz：</span><br>
...Tell them that an army of Gazers is on its way to attack Antarctica, please.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Svirepy：</span><br>
Gazers?! You mean the ones that attacked the World Expo–<br>
<br>
KABOOOM!<br>
With an all-encompassing boom, Gazers erupted from the ice, sending veritable hail flying forth.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ognevoy：</span><br>
Gazers really did come!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Svirepy：</span><br>
And a hell of a lot of 'em... Those things were hiding under the ice?!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Sovetsky Soyuz：</span><br>
Not necessarily, knowing the possibility of a superimposition... But this is surely too soon.<br>
Poltava, send an abbreviated message: everyone, and I mean everyone, prepare to retreat.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Everyone：</span><br>
Yes, ma'am!<br>

At the same time<br>
The Antarctic tactical map filled up with glowing red dots, indicating the presence of hostiles.<br>
In the blink of an eye, the Antarctic situation went from peaceful to bordering on crisis.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Memphis：</span><br>
Commander! Soyuz just sent an unencrypted message! "Gazers are invading Antarctica!" I've verified the ID!<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Gazers? Those giant weapons the Hierophant unleashed at the World Expo?<br>
So they're back. This is really bad news.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Memphis：</span><br>
Wait, didn't the Gazers emerge from the Divine Vestige last time? Marco Polo was manipulated into caking Europa with it.<br>
If they're invading using the same method, that means someone else has spread out the Divine Vestige.<br>
But who could it be?<br>
Unless... It was Soyuz and her team...<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
No, it can't be them.<br>
Marco Polo needed a long time to prepare everything. Soyuz's fleet didn't have that time – they arrived in Antarctica just a while ago.<br>
Some other, unknown party did this.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Helena：</span><br>
Saratoga and the Operation Frozen Angel fleet are engaging the Gazers now.<br>
Looks like they're still heading for the snowmelt area, albeit at a slower speed.<br>
The Northern Parliament, on the other hand... they're LEAVING the snowmelt area, heading for the coast.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Memphis：</span><br>
Ugh! What is Saratoga thinking?!<br>
Commander, we can't wait any longer! Take control of the battlefield!<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
I'm going to. Set up a chain of command and establish a real-time communication line for me.<br>
I'll contact Soyuz first to find out what's happening on the front!<br>
<br>
Antarctica - Snowmelt Area<br>
KABOOOM!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Sovetsky Soyuz：</span><br>
I've created an opening! Comrades, follow me!<br>
Maintain speed even if you're injured! Head straight for the submarine's rendezvous point!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Everyone：</span><br>
Yes, ma'am!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Communicator：</span><br>
BEEP BEEP!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Sovetsky Soyuz：</span><br>
A call?<br>
And it's from... Comrade Commander?!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Poltava：</span><br>
The Commander's calling?! Why now, of all times?<br>
Didn't Königsberg say everything's being jammed, and no communications can go in or out from Antarctica?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Sovetsky Soyuz：</span><br>
I suppose Comrade Commander found another way. This timing is too perfect, though...<br>
Comrade Commander must have been monitoring our situation to be ready to take command at a moment's notice.<br>
The reason we're the first to be contacted is probably because we possess intel from the frontlines.<br>
Heehee... Very well. Let us fight together, Comrade Commander.<br>

Sometime later<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
(The crystals being manufactured, Observer sending an SOS...)<br>
(There being a secret bunker there... and another Pamiat' Merkuria.)<br>
(That's it. I've pieced it all together now.)<br>
(First, we know now that Observer's mainframe is somewhere under the Antarctic ice.)<br>
(And, by some stroke of luck, the Ring of the Wise's substructure is physically connected to it.)<br>
(At the same time, the Hierophant wanted to invade our branch, so she used the other Pamiat' to infiltrate the bunker and scan for Observer's mainframe.)<br>
(Observer fought back, but it was no use, and she's now in mortal danger.)<br>
(Left with no choice, she produced those crystals and left them somewhere we'd discover them. This would get Naval HQ's attention, bringing all the shipgirls in one place so they could resolve the crisis.)<br>
(Saratoga sensed Naval HQ's movement and pursued the crystals, pinning her hopes on its rigging-enhancing properties...)<br>
(Many in the Eagle Union, her included, saw the seriousness of the situation. This eventually resulted in a huge fleet mobilizing.)<br>
(That's when I intervened, using the info Helena META gave me to stop this plot by sending intel about the crystal to Iron Blood and the Northern Parliament.)<br>
(Iron Blood, knowing how Naval HQ would respond, stuck to watching diligently from the sidelines.)<br>
(The Northern Parliament went in directly, however. Soyuz, who's suffering from an innate hull defect, organized a fleet and headed to Antarctica.)<br>
(Then, Pamiat' Merkuria META, who'd been in Antarctica for a long time, made contact with Soyuz out of personal curiosity.)<br>
(She accompanied them into the bunker, where she tried to persuade – or rather, cognitively influence – Soyuz, but she failed.)<br>
(Once the jig was up, she activated the Divine Vestige she'd put down beforehand and summoned the Gazers...)<br>
(Bravo, Soyuz. My hat is off to you for gathering this much intel in so little time.)<br>
(Helena META deserves thanks, too. For helping me like she said she would.)<br>
(If she really predicted everything I would do, then I'm officially scared of how well she knows me... Though, it's a blessing, too.)<br>
Thanks, Helena. For having my back.<br>
Now, then...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Communicator：</span><br>
BEEP BEEP!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Memphis：</span><br>
Commander, what's our next move? I'm guessing you're done talking to Soyuz.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Yeah. She gave me a rundown of the situation.<br>
First of all, tell Clemenceau that we'll be using the Tribunal's base as a temporary command center.<br>
Then contact Bismarck and tell her I have something urgent to talk to her about.<br>
Finally, remember that we have Naval HQ's eyes on us. Take all the other staff to the Tribunal's base. I'll catch up with you there.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Memphis：</span><br>
What? The Tribunal's base? You mean...?<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
You heard me. Also, set things up for confidential communication. I'll explain everything later.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Memphis：</span><br>
Got it! I'll see what I can do!<br>
Hanging up now. Good luck, Commander!<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Alright...<br>
Now to get in touch with Saratoga.<br>
{{折叠面板|内容结束}}

{{折叠面板|标题=Frozen Angel|选项=20|主框=1|样式=primary|展开=是}}
<br>
After organizing my thoughts for a bit, I sent Saratoga an encrypted call.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Communicator：</span><br>
BEEP BEEP!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Saratoga：</span><br>
...Yes? Saratoga speaking!<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Hey. Are you okay?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Saratoga：</span><br>
Huh?! W-wait, Commander?! How'd you...<br>
Um, I'm actually kind of busy right now, so...<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
We need to talk about Frozen Angel.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Saratoga：</span><br>
Oh...<br>
I had a feeling you'd find out sooner or later. Sorry for keeping you in the dark...<br>
I should've known the truth would get out after such a large fleet was mobilized.<br>
How did you get through the jamming all across the Southern Ocean?<br>
Actually, no, never mind.<br>
You have your ways. You probably already know what's going on here...<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
I also know your fleet is fighting the Gazers.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Saratoga：</span><br>
......<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
You've got your hands full, I know, but this is important.<br>
You must know by now that the crystals are part of a Siren plot.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Saratoga：</span><br>
Y-yeah...<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Then why are you still doing this?<br>
If you KNOW that the crystals are bait, why are you still walking into their trap?<br>
Then there's how you handled Constellation's experiment in the Sea of Stars. It's like you haven't been yourself for a while now.<br>
You never meant to put anyone in danger, I know that, but why are you trying to bear responsibility for everything?<br>
Something has clearly happened. I want you to tell me.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Saratoga：</span><br>
Commander, you're still in Europa, aren't you?<br>
That's good... That means you're in a safe place.<br>
Listen... I know there's a chance that Frozen Angel is an empty hope. I know that, of course.<br>
I knew all along that Wisdom Cubes and those crystals were completely different.<br>
But, even if they don't work like Cubes do, maybe – just maybe – they have the power to fix her hull.<br>
Lex has been debilitated ever since that battle, and we've still not found any way to cure her.<br>
And while we don't know any cure, maybe the Sirens or whoever controls them does.<br>
You have to understand... I'm desperate, Commander. I need something that can save her.<br>
So desperate I was willing to walk into a trap all on my own... But people came with me, and I couldn't just tell them it was a trap...<br>
And now they're all here, and it's my fault... Because I didn't have the courage to tell them...<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Listen to me. You're not the only one to whom Lex is important.<br>
She taught me so much when I was studying at the academy, and she was always there during my stint in the Eagle Union.<br>
She isn't just a shipgirl under my command. She's a friend and a person close to my heart.<br>
We made a promise, you and I. To save Lexington, whatever it took. I would never go back on that promise.<br>
So trust me when I say this – you can't carry this burden all by yourself.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Saratoga：</span><br>
......<br>
But... It's too late now...<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Lexington's condition is stable. We WILL find a way to cure her.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Saratoga：</span><br>
But the sun, it's... N-never mind.<br>
Ahem! Commander, I really, reeeally need your help!<br>
It'd be one thing if we were fighting mass-produced Sirens, but a swarm of Gazers this big is too much for our fleet to deal with!<br>
Remember your lesson on the Antarctic Treaty? It lets you command not just us shipgirls...<br>
But also all the defensive weaponry that exists around Antarctica!<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
...Thanks for trusting me, Sara.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Saratoga：</span><br>
Of course. I've always trusted you!<br>
Okay, I'm handing control of our fleet over to you now!<br>
Do your thing and lead us to victory!<br>

Iris Orthodoxy - Tribunal Headquarters<br>
Temporary Command Center<br>
Sometime later<br>
As I expected, Clemenceau immediately approved my request to borrow the Tribunal's base.<br>
I finished my call with Saratoga and went to the command center. There, I saw that the Eagle Union and Northern Parliament were already done setting up a chain of command.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Memphis：</span><br>
Commander, I set up a new rendezvous route for Saratoga's and Soyuz's fleets, like you asked.<br>
Also, the research station is orchestrating an evacuation as we speak. It's going smoothly so far.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Good. Then I can finally breathe for a bit.<br>
<br>
*clap clap clap clap*<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Clemenceau：</span><br>
Winning a battle thousands of kilometers away. Imagine that.<br>
This has been a magnificent display of your legendary leadership skills, Commander. If you ever retire and become a politician, you'll be the face of your party.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
You're exaggerating. I've not "won the battle" yet, I've only just begun repositioning fleets.<br>
I'm not proud about the distance thing, either. If I could, I'd teleport to Antarctica right now.<br>
But enough about me. Have you done the Bismarck thing?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Clemenceau：</span><br>
Yes. Just as you asked, I've prepared a closed comms channel to her. That's what I came here to tell you.<br>
It's over in our secret room. Nobody else will be able to hear what you say.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Nobody else besides you, I'm guessing.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Clemenceau：</span><br>
Heehee. I don't know what you mean♪<br>
She's on the line, but I can reschedule the call if now is a bad time for you.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Now is as good a time as any. Lead the way.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Clemenceau：</span><br>
Of course. Right this way.<br>
<br>
Tribunal Headquarters - Secret Room<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Bismarck Zwei：</span><br>
This is not how I was hoping we'd meet again, but things are what they are. Greetings.<br>
While we have publically spoken face-to-face before, well, as you may know...<br>
Showing my face in the capacity of a leader in a private conversation is... quite different.<br>
I will say, I'm surprised you'd go out of your way to contact me like this.<br>
If I'm to guess, this is about transferring command down in Antarctica, right?<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
What? Did Clemenceau not tell you anything?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Bismarck Zwei：</span><br>
All she told me was that this was about sharing intel and cooperating in Antarctica. Her tone was quite "figure out the rest yourself."<br>
It sounds like she withheld what she knew from you as well.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
That sounds like Clemenceau alright.<br>
Long story short, here's what we're dealing with...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Bismarck Zwei：</span><br>
It was YOU who relayed the discovery of that Antarctic crystal to me and Soyuz?<br>
So you've converted Clemenceau of all people to your side?<br>
<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项1：Yeah. She can't say no to me.</span>'''''<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项2：I don't know about that...</span>'''''<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项3：......</span>'''''<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Bismarck Zwei：</span><br>
You never cease to amaze, Commander.<br>
It's no wonder why Friedrich would sing your praises on a daily basis. Hahahah.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Unfortunately, I couldn't predict that we'd run into Gazers.<br>
If they're not dealt with, we'll have a disaster on our hands on par with the World Expo... No, maybe even bigger.<br>
On the bright side, we've fought them once before, and the superimposition hasn't begun yet.<br>
Manifesting a concept like Marco Polo did then will be much harder on Antarctica. Even if it does happen, the concept's foothold should be weak.<br>
If all factions engage it as one, we have a fighting chance.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Bismarck Zwei：</span><br>
That, I agree with.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Obviously, opinions differ from one faction to the next. But we need to set those aside and coordinate our efforts.<br>
For that reason, I would like to take command of your Southern Ocean fleet.<br>
Of course, I could also use any other forces you have in reserve. Knowing you, I'm certain you have some at the ready.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Bismarck Zwei：</span><br>
I do. I moved some people around as soon as I received word about the jamming.<br>
Here's what's going to happen.<br>
I will give you immediate control over our forces in not just this battle, but all future battles as well.<br>
This, I hope, will help you forge the future that you dream of.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
All future battles? You're allowing me to control whenever I see fit?<br>
Thank you so much, Bismarck. This will help greatly.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Bismarck Zwei：</span><br>
You're welcome. As long as you're up for the task, you can give orders to our shipgirls on the front whenever you want.<br>
Use their strength as though it were your own.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Right. I will not abuse this power.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Bismarck Zwei：</span><br>
Thank you. Until next time.<br>
<br>
Tribunal Headquarters - Corridor<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Clemenceau：</span><br>
Oh, you got done sooner than I expected.<br>
Seems like it went exceedingly well. Color me impressed.<br>
Who could have predicted she'd give you THAT much leeway, hmm?<br>
<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项1：So you WERE listening in!</span>'''''<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项2：Why, you spying little...</span>'''''<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Clemenceau：</span><br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项1）</span>'''''Was I, really? You can never be sure.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Clemenceau：</span><br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项2）</span>'''''Heehee. I'll take that as a compliment♪<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Clemenceau：</span><br>
But enough joking around. I got in touch with the Royal Navy's fleet.<br>
It seems they anticipated the Gazers' arrival, though they're still scrambling to figure out what to do.<br>
PTSD from the events of the World Expo, perhaps.<br>
Won't you be a dear and get them to calm down?<br>
Remember, you can always pull the Antarctic Treaty on them.<br>
Say something like – "As the Commander of the Azur Lane, I have unrivaled authority over Antarctica and its ocean."<br>
"I request that you transfer control of your fleet to me immediately and that you cooperate with other fleets under my command until the battle is over."<br>
Not to be pushy or anything, but I could send that message on your behalf.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
No thanks. I'll speak to them myself.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Clemenceau：</span><br>
Aww. That's too bad♪<br>

<br>
Tribunal Headquarters<br>
Temporary Command Center<br>
Sometime later<br>
Thanks to the hard work of Helena META as well as the shipgirls on-site, the jamming in Antarctica had been reduced to all but a non-issue.<br>
The command system was now getting everyone's positions, compositions, and statuses. Stable strategic communication had become possible.<br>
All faction fleets reorganized, creating a single, unified fleet under my command – the Azur Lane fleet.<br>
Reinforcements came in, too. Not just the ones Bismarck had prepared, but backup from the Eagle Union as well.<br>
The excuse given for the latter's presence was that, "They just so happened to be in the Southern Ocean." Yeah, right...<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Sara – or should I say, Miss Saratoga – really brought her entire fan club.<br>
She even got Enterprise's friends to come all the way out here...<br>
Ahem. Anyway...<br>
Let's start with reviewing the evac from Antarctica.<br>
The Eagle Union's and Royal Navy's bases are far from the action and their staff have already withdrawn.<br>
Königsberg is headed for the NP's research station right now. She'll evacuate after linking up with Soyuz's group.<br>
The fleets attached to each station will escort their members to safety. They won't partake in the operation until the evacuation is complete.<br>
On the Divine Vestige front, there have been no sightings of the cocoon that brought forth the Arbiter last time.<br>
The Gazers have been spreading the Divine Vestige, but only at a glacial pace compared to the time of the World Expo.<br>
So far, my theory has been correct.<br>
Pamiat' Merkuria META didn't plan ahead like Marco Polo did. She's apparently just been winging it.<br>
She is the key to all this. If we can neutralize her, it should end the crisis right there and then.<br>
As long as we stop the superimposition, we can take our time neutralizing the Gazers and drones.<br>
Luckily for us, it seems Soyuz has a big fan in Pamiat'. She's been pursuing them this whole time.<br>
All while ignoring how I've been rapidly redeploying our forces.<br>
All we need to do is lure her into an ambush and we can wipe out her and her Gazer army in one fell swoop.<br>
Soyuz's team is on the case, moving from the snowmelt area and toward the ambush point.<br>
With the Union's air support on our side, everything should go according to plan.<br>
Hell, the trap should be even more effective if we can push Pamiat's buttons and get her to run into our ambush completely blind.<br>
According to Soyuz, the girl is pretty emotionally unstable. It shouldn't take much to agitate her.<br>
Alright. Forces lying in ambush... Iron Blood has Brünhilde, Hindenburg, and Felix Schultz, to name a few.<br>
On the Union side, Saratoga's fleet is also en route to the ambush site.<br>
They've got battleships Washington, North Carolina, and the Colorado sisters. For carriers, they're bringing Saratoga herself of course, Ranger, and Independence.<br>
Add to that a few dozen cruisers and destroyers.<br>
Over in the Southern Ocean, there's the Royal Navy's Southern Ocean fleet led by Implacable, as well as an Iron Blood support fleet with Prinz Heinrich among the ranks.<br>
Finally, there's the Union backup fleet that "just happened to be there"...<br>
All in all, we have a really good shot at victory.<br>
<br>
Antarctica - Ice Fields<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Saratoga：</span><br>
Soyuz, do you read me? What's your status?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Sovetsky Soyuz：</span><br>
Damages are within estimates. We will reach the destination momentarily.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Saratoga：</span><br>
The air support is almost there! Just hang in a little longer!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Sovetsky Soyuz：</span><br>
I appreciate the support, it's just... aircraft will only deal quite limited damage to the Gazers.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Saratoga：</span><br>
Who's saying I've only brought aircraft?<br>
I've got a whole arsenal of stuff ready! You'll see later!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Brünhilde：</span><br>
Soyuz, our fleet is in position. All there is to do now is wait for the target to come.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Prinz Heinrich：</span><br>
And the reinforcements are coming in at full speed!<br>
C'mon, Eisen! Faster, boy!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Bunker Hill：</span><br>
...I'm Bunker Hill. Eagle Union Southern Ocean fleet. En route at max speed to objective.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Implacable：</span><br>
Same with the Royal Navy's Southern Ocean fleet. We'll arrive in three hours. It's an honour to be fighting alongside you.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ingraham：</span><br>
This is Ingraham. We're done evacuating all the Union and Royal Navy forces. The escort fleets will now join you in battle.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Tallinn：</span><br>
NP's and IB's evacs aren't finished yet. I'm working on it as fast as I can.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Sovetsky Soyuz：</span><br>
Thank you all for the status reports.<br>
We'll continue to our destination and report back when we've arrived.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Poltava：</span><br>
Sheesh. The Commander is leading everyone flawlessly, despite being across the world.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Sovetsky Soyuz：</span><br>
Yes. And under circumstances not even I could have predicted...<br>
But... that's what makes Comrade Commander so reliable, don't you think?<br>
I shall be the bait for Pamiat'. Everyone else, please follow the orders you've been given.<br>

<br>
Nighttime fell upon Antarctica, and the showdown was drawing near.<br>
An aurora shone overhead whilst the grand chase finally came to a close.<br>
<span style="color:#ffc960;">Pamiat' Merkuria META：</span><br>
Well, well. I was wondering why you stopped fleeing. Of course you had an ambush prepared.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Prinz Heinrich：</span><br>
Eisen, that's the bad guy! Let's get her!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Felix Schultz：</span><br>
Get a whiff of that one. Smells like danger.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Hindenburg：</span><br>
And what are we, harmless little kittens? We're just as dangerous.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Washington：</span><br>
Heard you've been starting shit here in Antarctica. Get ready to pay the price!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Cleveland：</span><br>
The Knights of the Sea are done letting you run rampant!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Implacable：</span><br>
It's not too late to stop. Surrender peacefully and we might just let you off with a stern beating.<br>
<span style="color:#ffc960;">Pamiat' Merkuria META：</span><br>
Wooow. Those are big words for a bunch of mice drawn to the big cheese.<br>
Observer couldn't have predicted this would happen. Not in a million years.<br>
I mean, of course she couldn't. Being disconnected from your mainframe does that to you.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Sovetsky Soyuz：</span><br>
...She has lost connection to her mainframe?<br>
<span style="color:#ffc960;">Pamiat' Merkuria META：</span><br>
What, you didn't know?<br>
C'mon. Put the pieces together.<br>
Do you think Observer would've just let Compiler get terminated if she was operating at normal capacity?<br>
She cut herself off from her OWN mainframe. Can you believe that?<br>
Something in your branch has made her go cuckoo, methinks.<br>
She hasn't connected to her mainframe for a very long time now. Why? I don't know.<br>
But at any rate, she can't get updates, can't access the Natural Calculation System, and can't use the resources of Laplace's Demon.<br>
The only things she can use are her mainframe's nodes and her vessels.<br>
Like, at this point, why would she even bother? She can't do jack!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Sovetsky Soyuz：</span><br>
It's no wonder, then, that she hasn't shown herself for so long.<br>
Has she really become so weak she can't even deal with a threat right next to her mainframe?<br>
<span style="color:#ffc960;">Pamiat' Merkuria META：</span><br>
That's right.<br>
The funniest thing of all is that she thought she could hide it from me!<br>
You can't hide a weakness as glaring as that! Hahahaha!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Sovetsky Soyuz：</span><br>
I would like it if the enemy of my enemy were my friend... but you don't seem keen on an alliance.<br>
You clearly don't like Observer either, though. Why don't you take it out on her and we can all part on peaceful terms?<br>
<span style="color:#ffc960;">Pamiat' Merkuria META：</span><br>
No can do. In case you forgot, I've got things to do here.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Sovetsky Soyuz：</span><br>
(Right, her three goals... Laying the Divine Vestige was only one of them.)<br>
We have stopped an invasion such as this once. We will do it again.<br>
Whatever your plans are, they will not come to fruition. This I can promise you.<br>
<span style="color:#ffc960;">Pamiat' Merkuria META：</span><br>
Really, huh? Let's put your promise to the test. I mean, I've already come this far!<br>
If you wanna stop me then you'd better give me your best shot! Ahahaha!<br>

<br>
KABOOOM!<br>
With a loud explosion, another Gazer toppled over.<br>
Thirty minutes had elapsed since the battle began. Already, the shipgirls had gained an overwhelming advantage.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ognevoy：</span><br>
This Pamiat' is just a weak imitation!<br>
She doesn't stand a chance against our firepower!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Svirepy：</span><br>
That's 'cuz we've got, like, a million people whalin' on her! It helps that we've got the Commander and ME, of course!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ognevoy：</span><br>
But isn't she a little TOO weak? You'd think the head honcho would put up more of a fight!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Svirepy：</span><br>
Compared to that World Expo hag on her flyin' throne, yeah, I guess she's kind of a pushover.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ognevoy：</span><br>
I think the Tribunal deployed a superweapon to deal with her in that case.<br>
In this case, though... it almost doesn't feel right with how easily she's going down...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Sovetsky Soyuz：</span><br>
(It IS odd. Beyond using Gazers as meat shields, she is making no attempt to avoid incoming fire.)<br>
(Rationally speaking, she's only digging her own grave... Yet, I remember one of Kronshtadt's reports described a fighting style just like this.)<br>
(One "Bon Homme Richard" similarly wasn't afraid of damage, and used it to erode the minds of her attackers...)<br>
(No... Could she be doing the same?)<br>
Pamiat', why are you fighting so hard for your obsession with the past?<br>
I can understand looking back on the past and basking in nostalgia. What I cannot understand is trying to replace the future with the past.<br>
You've suffered a lot, fought hellish battles, but at the very least, you survived.<br>
As a survivor, you should bear the hopes of your fallen comrades. You should live on, and fight for the good of all of us.<br>
Look what you're doing now. Do you think they'd be proud of you?<br>
You are trampling on not just everything they fought for, but everything YOU fought for as well.<br>
<span style="color:#ffc960;">Pamiat' Merkuria META：</span><br>
Hahahaha! "Obsession"? Do I look like someone driven by an obsession?<br>
No! I'm doing this because it's what my fallen comrades would have wanted!<br>
Haha... Ahahaha...<br>
AHAHAHAHAHAHAH!<br>
<br>
Pamiat's terrifying laughter rang through everyone's communicators. It sounded wrong, like someone was laughing THROUGH her.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ognevoy：</span><br>
Oh, gosh! Do you hear that?! It's like her laughter's coming from inside my head!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Svirepy：</span><br>
Is it just me, or is it gettin' cold as hell all of a sudden?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Poltava：</span><br>
Condensation is forming on my chains... Soyuz, I think she's healing herself!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Sovetsky Soyuz：</span><br>
Not on my watch, she isn't!<br>
<br>
KABOOOM!<br>
Soyuz fired a volley at the girl possessed by some evil spirit.<br>
The shells flew through the air, but stopped short of their target, plunging into the sea like rocks.<br>
A pulse of sheer cold radiated outward from Pamiat', freezing everything in its path at an unbelievable rate.<br>
The sea froze faster than the shipgirls could react. One by one, they were frozen in place.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Sovetsky Soyuz：</span><br>
...So this was your plan all along.<br>
You knowingly walked into our trap and allowed us to attack you.<br>
<span style="color:#c3abff;">Pamiat' Merkuria META：</span><br>
Ahaha... A small sacrifice to make, to be able to finally come into contact with the font of essence.<br>
By plucking the fruit from the prime branch, I have at last found... the true past!<br>
Look at this – the Revolutionary Front! All I ever knew about it was what little that one person told me.<br>
And now... it's like I was actually there myself.<br>
Ahahaha... I see it in the fragments... Very, very interesting.<br>
Wouldn't you know it – your Ring of Whatever isn't just a doomsday bunker.<br>
It's also where you store that device based on data you recovered from the RF.<br>
If it wasn't for that, you wouldn't have built a bunker all the way out here. Isn't that right, Soyuz?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Sovetsky Soyuz：</span><br>
......<br>
<span style="color:#c3abff;">Pamiat' Merkuria META：</span><br>
Ahahaha! Oh, what a laugh!<br>
And you called ME driven by obsession! You should have a good look in the mirror!<br>
Project Dawn is the biggest obsession of them all!<br>
You think it's your ray of hope? You couldn't be more wrong. It's an express ticket to your downfall.<br>
Just being close to it brings misfortune.<br>
Do you know what happened to the people involved in this project? I can tell you.<br>
Don't answer. I'll tell you either way.<br>
The project planner went out with a fleet to test a new experimental device. Then... Poof! None of them were ever seen again!<br>
Then the project was suspended and became an accessory to a separate project.<br>
And when that project started, our entire fleet, as well as our last admiral, were all sacrificed! Not a single survivor!<br>
"Fight until the last light has faded."<br>
That's what they all said. They all fought to their deaths and let someone else have their chance to live!<br>
This is what Project Dawn is! This is the obsession that's been passed down!<br>
It's sacrificing yourself and dumping everything on those who survive!<br>
Now it's yours. Do you want to do the same as them?<br>
The same as Antiochus, the same as the Ashes – carrying the hopes and dreams of the fallen and suffering for all eternity!<br>
You've already seen what that turned them into.<br>
This endless cycle only creates more tragedy... and must be put to an end.<br>
If you were given a way out, why would you NOT take it?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Sovetsky Soyuz：</span><br>
You may have chosen a way out. At least, so you may believe...<br>
But looking at you now, it's clear you haven't been set free.<br>
All you've done is escape the fate of being controlled by one Siren in favor of another one. You're still being controlled.<br>
<span style="color:#c3abff;">Pamiat' Merkuria META：</span><br>
Ahahaha! No, Soyuz, you're wrong! Antiochus are not all the same.<br>
Look at humanity itself. They're not a monolith, and neither are Antiochus.<br>
You've got low-level programs, blindly following orders, and then you've got the Arbiters.<br>
Killing that first group is easy. The second one, though? They're as unkillable as unkillable gets. Especially... her.<br>
One thing you should know about me is that I'm nobody's lackey. We're cooperating as equals.<br>
We're partners who see each other eye to eye, searching for the answer together!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Sovetsky Soyuz：</span><br>
Is "escapism" the best answer you could come up with?<br>
<span style="color:#c3abff;">Pamiat' Merkuria META：</span><br>
Call it whatever you want, but it sure beats a pointless suicide pact!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Sovetsky Soyuz：</span><br>
That isn't what we're choosing. We aren't trying to end our own lives or follow the path to destruction.<br>
We are searching the unknown, carving a path to the future. That is the indomitable human spirit – which has brought us to this very point.<br>
We may stumble along the way, we may get caught in a storm, but every hardship and challenge humanity faces becomes a lesson for its development.<br>
Perhaps Project Dawn did fail in the past. If so, that is a failure we can learn from.<br>
We will fix its faults and try again with care so as to not repeat the same mistake.<br>
Even if we perish in the process, we must believe that, someday, someone will come and succeed where we failed.<br>
<span style="color:#c3abff;">Pamiat' Merkuria META：</span><br>
You're still on about this...<br>
Fate, the future, the cycle – those will all end one day.<br>
Your fate has already been decided for you. I've seen it myself.<br>
There is nothing, NOTHING good in that future you can't stop gushing about!<br>
The good days are all in the past!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Sovetsky Soyuz：</span><br>
You're wrong! Nobody decides our future for us!<br>
The future is ours to choose, not yours!<br>
<br>
I pressed the button to call the girls, to cut off that ear-piercing laughter, but then...<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
...Helena. So you heard it, too.<br>
Then I might as well ask you. Is what she said about Project Dawn true?<br>
<span style="color:#ffc960;">Helena META：</span><br>
Yes and no. It is how she remembers it... It is reality, but only one reality.<br>
Reality and truth are not always one and the same.<br>
What I can say is this – reality can only become truth if enough faith goes into it.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
"Reality can only become truth... if enough faith goes into it."<br>
<span style="color:#ffc960;">Helena META：</span><br>
Let's not worry too much about the philosophical stuff right now. There's still a battle going on.<br>
I've protected you against Pamiat's cognitive influence. You won't be affected by her voice.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Thank you. Next thing to deal with, then, is that ocean-freezing power of hers.<br>
From what I can tell, it's not an Arbiter or META ability. It's simply a bluff, right?<br>
<span style="color:#ffc960;">Helena META：</span><br>
Yes. She certainly could use the Tower's power to freeze the sea in an instant...<br>
But this freeze is only surface-level.<br>
It's a trick meant to fool you. Nothing to be afraid of.<br>
She isn't as strong as everyone thinks she is.<br>
The forces you have right now are more than enough to win against her.<br>
It's time to get back in the fight. Good luck.<br>

<br>
Tribunal Headquarters - Temporary Command Center<br>
Helena's defense against the cognitive influence and Soyuz's decisive action in battle gave us the edge we needed to fend off Pamiat' META's attacks.<br>
As we'd reasoned out, the thin layer of ice was hardly an obstacle to our fleet.<br>
Simply firing at it with machine guns or even raising their main engine output and moving a bit more vigorously was enough to break through it with ease.<br>
To compare this Pamiat' Merkuria to other META we'd encountered so far, she was probably between Scharnhorst and Hiryuu.<br>
A powerful foe, yes, but nothing compared to the awesome might of the Arbiters.<br>
Our allies continued to strike down Gazers, all the while cornering the mastermind.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
(This is all wrong. It's going TOO well.)<br>
(If she's imitating Bon Homme Richard, then she must still have an ace up her sleeve.)<br>
<span style="color:#ffc960;">Pamiat' Merkuria META：</span><br>
Haha... Ahahaha...<br>
AHAHAHAHAHAHAH!<br>
<br>
Her eerie laughter echoed through my mind.<br>
Helena was protecting me from Pamiat' META's attacks on my mind, yes, but ONLY me.<br>
What if Pamiat' META attacked the command structure itself instead?<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
(If I lose contact and can't command our allies anymore, that's effectively the same as getting rid of me...)<br>
(Memphis and Helena need to raise the security of our command network! If I don't tell them now...!)<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Communicator：</span><br>
KRRRHHHH...<br>
<br>
For just a moment, I heard interference in the communicator.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Damn! She pivoted to jamming already?!<br>
Helena, Memphis! Prepare for enemy attack–<br>
Did that light just flicker?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Memphis：</span><br>
Hm? There are some odd readings on my monitor...<br>
Excuse me, Algérie? Can you help me troubleshoot this right away?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Algérie：</span><br>
Huh? It was fine during my daily checks this morning... What in the world?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Helena：</span><br>
Umm, hey... Is it just me, or is there black mist oozing out?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Clemenceau：</span><br>
Black mist?<br>
Tch... Everyone, get away from the communicator!<br>
It's an enemy attack! Algérie, sound the alarms!<br>
Lock down this facility at once!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Algérie：</span><br>
Yes, ma'am!<br>
<br>
Under Clemenceau's command, our Iris allies began an emergency evacuation.<br>
Black mist gradually filled the command center.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
(This is definitely an enemy attack... But how do you get gas through communication lines?)<br>
Clemenceau, Soyuz! Be ready to take command!<br>
<br>
Seemingly alerted to my presence, the black mist turned its tendrils to me.<br>
While my consciousness turned hazy, I heard the faint sound of wind chimes.<br>
In a world of pure white, at the far end of my vision, stood a single door.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
(I know this place. I came here when I was investigating Anchorage's hull at the Sea of Stars...)<br>
(That's not all. When we fought the Arbiter at the World Expo, I was warped to this space again, too.)<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Sovetsky Soyuz：</span><br>
...Comrade Commander?<br>
Are you there, Comrade?!<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Is that you, Sovetsky Soyuz?!<br>
<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项1：(Was her rigging restructured after all?)</span>'''''<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项2：(Isn't she in Antarctica right now, though?)</span>'''''<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Sovetsky Soyuz：</span><br>
Yes, it's me. And I'm relieved to see that it really is you, Comrade Commander.<br>
Something uncanny is happening, that much is clear.<br>
I was in Antarctica, and you were in Europa – and yet we've been warped to the same place at the same time.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Soyuz, did anything strange happen before you were brought here?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Sovetsky Soyuz：</span><br>
...Actually, yes. The enemy META released a black shockwave.<br>
The power of the impact did more than just break our formation – it knocked out our communication systems.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Same here. Black mist started spewing out, and our communication equipment all started malfunctioning...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Sovetsky Soyuz：</span><br>
And before you knew it, you were here. Just like me.<br>
It would be reasonable to presume this is the result of an enemy attack, then.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Actually, it might not be. I recognize this place.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Sovetsky Soyuz：</span><br>
Is that so? Incidentally, so do I.<br>
Shortly after I came to Antarctica, when I touched that strange crystal, I was warped here.<br>
I went through that door and witnessed an unusual sight...<br>
Comrade Commander, if you have any clues regarding the truth of this place... I'd certainly appreciate you sharing.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Mm. This area appears connected to the Wisdom Cube's information space.<br>
I think that door leads to the data preserved at the Wisdom Cube's inception.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Sovetsky Soyuz：</span><br>
Data preserved in the Wisdom Cube? Does that mean... that what we know to be "essence" is an account of things that actually happened?<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Indeed. This is in fact a record of reality, though in a branch separate from ours.<br>
From our perspective, however, it is but one of infinite possibilities.<br>
Like you said, this branch has its own past and present.<br>
More importantly, it has its own future.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Sovetsky Soyuz：</span><br>
Comrade Commander...<br>
Nothing will happen if we just sit here. Let's think of a way to escape.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Oh. This is just anecdotal, but I think the passage of time here is different.<br>
Haste makes waste here. Since we're stuck here, we might as well keep calm and take our time.<br>
First things first, let's see what's behind that door.<br>
{{折叠面板|内容结束}}

{{折叠面板|标题=Antarctic Dreams|选项=26|主框=1|样式=primary|展开=是}}
<br>
Soyuz and I opened the door in front of us.<br>
Beyond it lay a palace reminiscent of the Imperiya.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Pamiat' Merkuria：</span><br>
La la la~ Hum da dum~<br>
Foie gras~ Venison~ Roast chicken~<br>
Truffle and nut souffle♪<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Sevastopol：</span><br>
I've returned, Mademoiselle Pamiat' Merkuria.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Gangut：</span><br>
*sniff* *sniff*... That smells good!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Avrora：</span><br>
Thank you for all you do, Pamiat'. Heehee, would you like some help?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Pamiat' Merkuria：</span><br>
Aww, I'm fine. I can handle it myself!<br>
Heheh. But I know something you can help me with...<br>
I haven't found the right wine to go with it! Mind going down to the cellar to pick one out?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Gangut：</span><br>
Say what? You can't find a drink in the Summer Palace, of all places?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Pamiat' Merkuria：</span><br>
I said the RIGHT wine!<br>
I'm having Iris cuisine today, so I wanna try for a different vibe this time.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Gangut：</span><br>
What does it matter as long as it's potable? Unless it's vodka we're talking about, anyway!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Sevastopol：</span><br>
It DOES matter!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Pamiat' Merkuria：</span><br>
Yeah! It does!<br>
Alright, Sevastopol. I'm counting on you to find the perfect wine for tonight!<br>
<br>
The recording ended, and the world turned white again.<br>
We entered the door once more.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Pamiat' Merkuria：</span><br>
Great work on your mission, Avrora!<br>
You must be tired. Empty that brain and take a little break!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Avrora：</span><br>
Thank you! Mm... The air here is just so lovely.<br>
But Pamiat', I'm not entirely sure if horseback riding is the best way to take a break after a long trip.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Pamiat' Merkuria：</span><br>
Ahahaha♪ Actually, I had you come with me because I had a little surprise to show you!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Avrora：</span><br>
A surprise?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Pamiat' Merkuria：</span><br>
Check this out!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Pamiat' Merkuria (Retrofit)：</span><br>
Tadaaah!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Avrora：</span><br>
You've modernized your rigging... You got a retrofit! So the new technology proved a success?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Pamiat' Merkuria (Retrofit)：</span><br>
A roaring one, as you can see!<br>
Heheh, and I'm the first shipgirl to get one, too!<br>
Awesome, right? I am so awesome!<br>
<br>
The recording ended, and the world turned white again.<br>
We entered the door once more.<br>
<span style="color:#ffc960;">Pamiat' Merkuria META：</span><br>
Gangut... Sevastopol...<br>
Why... did everyone have to die...<br>
Why... am I the only one left...<br>
Why... did you try so hard to let me live?<br>
<br>
Her tears had dried up. Her voice was hoarse.<br>
Behind her, the two-headed eagle flag collapsed amidst the flames.<br>
It was over.<br>
The recording ended, and the world turned white again.<br>
We entered the door once more.<br>
In the moonlight, a damaged ship quietly kept watch.<br>
From her silhouette and her visage, you managed to recognize who she was.<br>
She exuded coldness and loneliness, but also the joy of hope and the noble pride of one who'd fought through and survived a great war.<br>
The recording ended, and a fifth door appeared before us.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Sovetsky Soyuz：</span><br>
Was that... the past of the other Pamiat' Merkuria?<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Seems like it. But that ship from the last one...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Sovetsky Soyuz：</span><br>
Comrade Commander... Do you know what manner of being she was?<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
No...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Sovetsky Soyuz：</span><br>
This is the fifth door. Do you want to keep going?<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Of course. It's just a feeling, but I think this one is the last one.<br>
We're about to find the truth of this place.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Sovetsky Soyuz：</span><br>
Comrade Commander... Is this what I think it is?<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Antarctica. Not where you were before you came here, but...<br>
<br>
When we went through the door, we found a place quite similar to where Soyuz had been.<br>
It wasn't a memory or a recording. The scenery here was just too vivid.<br>
In the center of the battlefield was Pamiat' Merkuria META, engulfed in that black mist.<br>
I saw our allies around her.<br>
However, everything was motionless. It was as if time had frozen in the Antarctic cold.<br>
When I looked up, there was one more witness.<br>
<span style="color:#bdbdbd;">Pamiat' Merkuria：</span><br>
It's frozen because it's happening right now, in the present.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
You're... the Pamiat' Merkuria from back then, aren't you?<br>
<span style="color:#bdbdbd;">Pamiat' Merkuria：</span><br>
Nope.<br>
Like yeah, I am Pamiat', but I'm not that one. I'm not any of the Pamiat' Merkurias you've ever known or will ever know.<br>
Umm, I guess you could say I'm like every Pamiat' ever all balled up into one.<br>
Does that make sense?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Sovetsky Soyuz：</span><br>
In other words... you're the culmination of the concept of Pamiat' Merkuria?<br>
<span style="color:#bdbdbd;">Pamiat' Merkuria：</span><br>
Oh, wow! You're smart. Guess you need to be, if you made it this far.<br>
Anyway, this incarnation was just born, so it's not quite perfect yet.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Sovetsky Soyuz：</span><br>
Even though the shipgirl Pamiat' Merkuria has existed for a long time now?<br>
<span style="color:#bdbdbd;">Pamiat' Merkuria：</span><br>
A long time? Mm... Sorry, but time doesn't really MEAN anything, does it?<br>
We can't just pop out of thin air willy-nilly, you know. There are conditions for our birth.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Sovetsky Soyuz：</span><br>
...What would happen if we were to take you down right now?<br>
<span style="color:#bdbdbd;">Pamiat' Merkuria：</span><br>
Hmm... Gotta say, I'm curious myself!<br>
But unfortunately, I'm not going down here. Neither will either of you, though.<br>
That's just... the rules, or whatever.<br>
Don't worry too much about the battle, alright?<br>
See? Take a look, and you'll get what I mean.<br>
You've already cornered the poor girl. You're this close to a total victory.<br>
If you went back right now, you could seize victory just like that.<br>
So just leave it alone, and everything will be just fine!<br>
Instead, have a little chat with me!<br>
You must have tons of questions!<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
I don't mind chatting, but let's make one thing clear first.<br>
Are you our enemy or not?<br>
<span style="color:#bdbdbd;">Pamiat' Merkuria：</span><br>
Strictly speaking? I'm not on any side.<br>
Will I take a side? Well, I have my own plans♪<br>
Work with me, and I'll call you a friend. Get in my way, you're my enemy. Sound good enough?<br>
So, who the heck are you?<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Uh, the Commander of the Azur Lane...?<br>
<span style="color:#bdbdbd;">Pamiat' Merkuria：</span><br>
Come ON, I already know that.<br>
I don't want your title. I want to know who and what you are!<br>
Something about you is all nostalgic... I just can't remember why, for some reason!<br>
I mean, look. I'm not perfect, but I'm Pamiat' Merkuria in the purest sense of the name.<br>
Don't you think it's a liiittle weird that there's something I just can't remember?<br>
Meh. You probably don't know, either.<br>
But then I have to wonder – why are you here?<br>
Just so you know, I didn't bring you here. I don't have any crazy powers like that.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
It wasn't you? Then it must be the black mist...<br>
Wait. Do you hear those wind chimes?<br>
<span style="color:#bdbdbd;">Pamiat' Merkuria：</span><br>
Wind chimes? What are you talking about?<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
I...<br>
<br>
The sound of wind chimes rang in my ears again.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Wait! I still have questions to ask!<br>
<br>
Dazzling light awakened me.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
(Now what... Light, a lamp... A wire?)<br>
(This isn't the Wisdom Cube's information space. Am I back?)<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Memphis：</span><br>
Commander! You're finally awake!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Vestal：</span><br>
Thank goodness... Your vital signs were fine, but you just wouldn't wake up.<br>
Do you feel okay? Are you hurting anywhere?<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
(I think the black mist coming at me woke me up...)<br>
Where are we?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Helena：</span><br>
A Tribunal medical station.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
How long was I out?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Memphis：</span><br>
Thirty whole minutes!<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
What about Soyuz... Did our comrades in Antarctica win their battle?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Memphis：</span><br>
How did you know...? Wait, shouldn't you be more worried about yourself?!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Clemenceau：</span><br>
Now, now. I'm sure it's a good thing that the Commander has the energy to worry about others.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Clemenceau, how's the situation?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Clemenceau：</span><br>
All is well. Soyuz has things under control.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Is the command center safe?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Clemenceau：</span><br>
You don't need to worry about that. By the way, we have a call from Soyuz.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Through normal channels...?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Clemenceau：</span><br>
A secret line. I promise I'm not eavesdropping this time.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Sovetsky Soyuz：</span><br>
Comrade Commander, we've secured victory.<br>
We've also confirmed the disappearance of the Gazers, and the Arbiter invasion has been thwarted.<br>
All of this is thanks to your support, coordination, and command.<br>
This combat operation is more than just an execution of the Antarctic Treaty – it serves as a model example of all factions working together against a common enemy.<br>
I speak for all of the Northern Parliament when I say thank you, Commander.<br>
No matter what choice you make in the future...<br>
We hope to stand with you and help you in any way we can.<br>
I look forward to seeing you at the victory celebration banquet.<br>
<br>
With the META threat defeated, the distant battle in the Antarctic had ended in our victory.<br>
We had prevented Antarctica from facing a worst-case scenario.<br>
However, some doubts lingered.<br>
Why had Observer severed her connection to her mainframe? What exactly was that Pamiat' Merkuria in the memory space?<br>
What were those wind chimes, and why did Helena META want to help me so much?<br>
Project Dawn and the strange crystal contained their fair share of mysteries, as well.<br>
One thing was for sure – more sleepless nights lay in store for me.<br>

KABOOOM!<br>
<span style="color:#ffc960;">Pamiat' Merkuria META：</span><br>
*cough cough*... How are you still moving?<br>
No... Don't tell me that had zero effect on you...<br>
Your test site means business, huh. It's no wonder you held off her invasion once. You're capable.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Sovetsky Soyuz：</span><br>
This is the end of the line, "Pamiat'."<br>
<span style="color:#ffc960;">Pamiat' Merkuria META：</span><br>
Yeah, looks like it. The time for resculpting is over...<br>
You got me! I lost!<br>
But hey, it's no big deal. I'm satisfied that I even got this far.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Sovetsky Soyuz：</span><br>
...And now, maybe we can finally talk.<br>
It has been bothering me how so many of your actions here don't make sense.<br>
Initially, I thought your goal here was to brainwash me in order to gain control of the bunker.<br>
You were able to blend in smoothly, hardly raising any suspicions since we first saw you. You clearly have skill.<br>
And yet, your attempt to persuade me was lukewarm, and you willingly lifted your cognitive influence on me.<br>
Then, there's how you told us all that information about Project Dawn without any prompting whatsoever.<br>
There are simply too many inconsistencies.<br>
What is your goal here, really? Why did you come to our world?<br>
<span style="color:#ffc960;">Pamiat' Merkuria META：</span><br>
Who knows. Maybe I just wanted to see my old comrades. Maybe I just wanted to atone for old sins.<br>
Or maybe I wanted to chat with an old friend to get drunk on false hope again?<br>
At any rate, you girls might have won, but that doesn't mean SHE has been defeated.<br>
The battle is far from over.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Sovetsky Soyuz：</span><br>
...Of course. Your three objectives.<br>
<span style="color:#ffc960;">Pamiat' Merkuria META：</span><br>
Yeah! I'm glad you remembered.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Sovetsky Soyuz：</span><br>
Laying the Divine Vestige must've been the first. What were the remaining–<br>
<span style="color:#ffc960;">Pamiat' Merkuria META：</span><br>
Okay, that's enough talking! You need to start fighting for real or you'll actually die!<br>
Buuut then again...<br>
You DID fight off this invasion and live to tell the tale.<br>
Maybe you'll meet a girl with the same tragic past as me who also carries the wishes of her comrades.<br>
Me and her, we are fundamentally at odds with each other. I'd say we're pretty much mortal enemies.<br>
But you, Soyuz – you can help her. I know you can.<br>
So if you ever cross paths... take care of her, alright?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Sovetsky Soyuz：</span><br>
...I don't have any reason to honor your request.<br>
<span style="color:#ffc960;">Pamiat' Merkuria META：</span><br>
Come ooon! I went easy on you AND gave you intel! She's a comrade and – unlike the cutie you're talking to – she's really powerful!<br>
What more reasons do you need?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Sovetsky Soyuz：</span><br>
(Hmm... If Comrade Commander were in my shoes...)<br>
<span style="color:#ffc960;">Pamiat' Merkuria META：</span><br>
That's it for me! Now don't get squashed without a fight!<br>
The future depends on it! Yours, the Northern Parliament's, and the Imperiya's!<br>
I'll be watching you from somewhere far, far away...<br>
And strike whenever I see the chance!<br>

Iris Orthodoxy - Holy Capital<br>
Azur Lane Provisional Base<br>
After the battle's conclusion<br>
It would be another sleepless night, just as I had been fearing.<br>
Amidst victory celebrations, reports of Siren attacks started blowing in like a snowstorm.<br>
Large Siren fleets had been sighted nearly everywhere, from the South Atlantic to the Antarctic and its surrounding ocean.<br>
They were all converging upon a single point in the Southern Ocean.<br>
It seemed like repelling Pamiat' Merkuria META gave Observer the breathing room to launch a counterattack.<br>
To make matters worse, the Gazers were still lurking somewhere beneath the snow. We would have to take care of them before moving on to the Sirens.<br>
However, I could not let the shipgirls remain in Antarctica. If they did, the fighting would surely get chaotic.<br>
For that reason, I ordered the immediate withdrawal of all forces present on the continent.<br>
I instructed the Combined Azur Lane fleet to move to safe waters, then spread out and return to their faction's area of control.<br>
Now, having done all this, it was time to contact the girl who'd helped me so much during this operation...<br>
I closed my eyes and allowed the cognitive influence into my mind. A galaxy full of stars spread out before me.<br>
<span style="color:#ffc960;">Helena META：</span><br>
Hey. Here to ask me something?<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Yeah. About the crystals. While they do exhibit some resonance with riggings, the amount is just not enough to be practical.<br>
They're worthless as a cure for hull damage, and we can never hope to get more of them than the bunker managed to produce.<br>
<span style="color:#ffc960;">Helena META：</span><br>
Mhm. They were just bait Observer used to lure you.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Be that as it may, the crystals DID restructure Soyuz's rigging. Why is that?<br>
<span style="color:#ffc960;">Helena META：</span><br>
I think that was just another trick on Observer's part. Seeing is believing, and she made you believe by removing what was inhibiting Soyuz. It was the quickest way.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
I see. So it was something different to the "resculpting" that Pamiat' spoke of.<br>
Is there anything you can tell me about that, actually?<br>
<span style="color:#ffc960;">Helena META：</span><br>
"Resculpting" is... Well, it's a special stage of METAmorphosis, fraught with danger and instability. I don't want to tell you too much.<br>
But, to give you a hint – by now, you've met several girls whose METAmorphosis changed them somehow.<br>
Why do you think they changed? Where do the energy and data that turned them into what they are come from?<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Data from the "prime" branch, huh... When I was attacked by that black mist, it sent me into another Wisdom Cube information space.<br>
This time, it led me to a girl who claimed to be the "culmination of the concept of Pamiat' Merkuria."<br>
We talked about some things, but got interrupted by the sound of wind chimes.<br>
I've heard those chimes and visited information spaces multiple times now, yet I still know next to nothing about either.<br>
I don't reckon you have all the answers, but maybe you can tell me a thing or two?<br>
<span style="color:#ffc960;">Helena META：</span><br>
I can't, since I don't know what things you truly saw in there.<br>
If we ever get the chance, though, I'd like to see it with you.<br>
The sun's activity is on the rise, so I know this won't be our last meeting.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
What was that about the sun? What does that have to do with anything?<br>
Unless... it's not the sun itself that's important, but rather the concept of the sun...<br>
<span style="color:#ffc960;">Helena META：</span><br>
Correct. Conceptually, it represents weakening, and weakening facilitates coalescence.<br>
It comes with some danger, but also with opportunities.<br>
Sorry for being so vague on the details. I'll tell you everything in due time.<br>
...I have to ask – are you really not worried about that Pamiat'?<br>
She told you herself. She'll attack again whenever she sees the chance.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
When the Arbiters strike, we'll be ready for them. We'll be ready for that girl, too.<br>
<span style="color:#ffc960;">Helena META：</span><br>
I sure hope so. Your branch is currently under constant threat.<br>
You stopped her from accomplishing her first objective. She still has two more.<br>
Be on your guard, Commander.<br>
The battle isn't over yet.<br>

Thank you for coming all this way, Commander.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Soyuz told me you had something important for me.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Avrora：</span><br>
That, I do. It's about the Ring of the Wise – our Antarctic bunker.<br>
You were given information on it during the battle. We had, however, omitted a few details.<br>
Soyuz asked me to provide you with the complete records.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
You mean there's even more to it?<br>
I knew that was no mere doomsday bunker, but even what I knew wasn't the full story?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Avrora：</span><br>
Indeed, it's not. Its true duty has to do with... geomagnetic fields.<br>
The details are all in here. I suggest you read it for yourself.<br>
You cannot bring these documents with you, however. Also, please don't speak a word of this to anyone but me or Soyuz.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
So this is some of the most classified stuff the Northern Parliament has.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Avrora：</span><br>
It is.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
