Chapter 1 - Bad Sense of Direction<br>
Port - Office<br>
Starting today, Akatsuki will be serving as my secretary.<br>
... Well, that was the plan, anyway. It's now past the time she was supposed to arrive.<br>
Maybe something has happened to her?<br>
<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项1：Go looking for her</span>'''''<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Fubuki：</span><br>
Hey, Commander! Good morning!<br>
Hm? You're looking for Akatsuki?<br>
Let's see... I think... I saw her heading over there just a few minutes ago!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ayanami：</span><br>
You're trying to find Akatsuki?<br>
Ayanami saw her walking in that direction.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Kagerou：</span><br>
Akatsuki, eh? I believe I saw her just this morning... Hum, hum...<br>
Ah, now I remember! I saw her hurriedly going that-a-way!<br>
<br>
Based on these testimonies, Akatsuki seems to have gone in a circle around the port...<br>
She must've gotten lost, somehow...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Akatsuki：</span><br>
Hmm... It should be over here...<br>
Oh?! C-Commander?!<br>
Why, I'm already this late?! H-how shameful! The first thing I did in the morning was to try to make my way to the office...<br>
But it seems I underestimated how far away it is...<br>
<br>
Just as I figured, Akatsuki had gotten lost.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Akatsuki：</span><br>
W-what?! The office is in that direction?!<br>
*Whimper*... Thank you for informing me... I-I swear upon my name that I won't be late tomorrow!<br>
<br>
Akatsuki was bowing repeatedly and deeply to express her guilt.<br>
Being a ninja with a bad sense of direction must be a daily struggle.<br>
Next time I have the chance, I should take her along for a stroll around the port.<br>

Chapter 2 - Ninja Training<br>
One day, I found Akatsuki and Kuroshio doing something in the area behind the academy.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Kuroshio：</span><br>
Hi-yah!<br>
<br>
Kuroshio jumped high into the air, pulled off an impressive somersault, then gently landed on the ground.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Akatsuki：</span><br>
I-impressive...!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Kuroshio：</span><br>
This is basic training for a kunoichi. If you train enough, this would be an easy feat even for you.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Akatsuki：</span><br>
Really?! Then I shall give it a try... Haaaaahh! ... Waaahhh?!<br>
<br>
Akatsuki lost her balance in the air. Kuroshio jumped up and caught her.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Akatsuki：</span><br>
That was close... T-thank you...<br>
Let us try again!<br>
Haaaahh! ... Huh?... Waaahhhh?!<br>
<br>
Like a scene out of a cartoon, Akatsuki noticed how high up she was, then began falling to the ground. Kuroshio leaped into the air and caught her again.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Akatsuki：</span><br>
Grr... O-one more attempt!<br>
This time, I shall succeed! Hah! ... Waaahhh?!<br>
<br>
Akatsuki landed in Kuroshio's outstretched arms. She looked like a newlywed being carried from the altar by her groom.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Kuroshio：</span><br>
Perhaps this is a bit too difficult for you?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Akatsuki：</span><br>
Forgive me... I have not trained enough...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Kuroshio：</span><br>
It's okay. Everyone's like this at the start of their training.<br>
... Still, why did you request my special training in the first place?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Akatsuki：</span><br>
Umm... Because I am a ninja, but in many ways, I don't feel like one...<br>
So I want to become stronger! Then, when I meet Hibiki, I will surprise her with what I would be capable of!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Kuroshio：</span><br>
The techniques of the shinobi are not something to be flaunted.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Akatsuki：</span><br>
I understand... I'm sorry...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Kuroshio：</span><br>
But, I do not object to learning them as something nice to show to one's companions. Oyashio has always been doing that, in fact.<br>
Let us resume your training. If you fall again, I will catch you.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Akatsuki：</span><br>
O-of course! Let us continue!<br>
<br>
It appears the ninja and kunoichi get along really well.<br>

Chapter 3 - A Friendly Gathering (Part 1)<br>
Port - Office<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">{namecode:13}&{namecode:14}：</span><br>
Pardon the intrusion!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Akatsuki：</span><br>
Ikazuchi? Inazuma? Why are you here?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Inazuma：</span><br>
You've been working the whole day, and we thought you would like some refreshments. Care for a drink?<br>
<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项1：Happily accept their offer</span>'''''<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Akatsuki：</span><br>
Thank you, Inazuma!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ikazuchi：</span><br>
Hey, Commander, Akatsuki hasn't been causing any trouble, has she? We were a bit concerned, so we came to check in on you!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Inazuma：</span><br>
I've heard she got lost on the first day she was to serve as the secretary.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Akatsuki：</span><br>
Ugh...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ikazuchi：</span><br>
And the other day when we were having tea, didn't she run off somewhere, leaving a note saying she'd gone looking for Hibiki?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Akatsuki：</span><br>
P-please, don't talk about that...!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Inazuma：</span><br>
Soon after, we received that photograph of Akatsuki and two polar bears in front of a tent. For being bears, they looked rather friendly.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ikazuchi：</span><br>
I see! So that is what someone having "no sense of direction" means!<br>
Oh, yeah! Remember that one time when we were training, and Akatsuki went-<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Inazuma：</span><br>
I think we should take our leave, Ikazuchi.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ikazuchi：</span><br>
Huh? But I was just getting-<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Inazuma：</span><br>
Our task here is done, so I believe we should head back. We wouldn't want to get in the way of their work, would we?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ikazuchi：</span><br>
I see! Alright then, we're leaving now! See you two later!<br>
<br>
Before Ikazuchi could finish her story, she and Inazuma left the room.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Akatsuki：</span><br>
Thank goodness they left...<br>
A-ahem! So, now you know much more about me. My inept side in particular. You must be very disappointed...<br>
I swear upon my title as a ninja that I will never get lost and never be afraid of the dark again! I shall overcome my weaknesses!<br>
Hiyah! Hooah! I'm feeling rather fired up! I'm ready to take on any task you have in store for me!<br>
<br>
Just like that, Akatsuki took her feelings of humility and turned them into determination.<br>

Chapter 4 - A Friendly Gathering (Part 2)<br>
Ikazuchi and Inazuma invited Akatsuki and me to come and play a game, Fleet Fighter V, that they had borrowed from Long Island.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ikazuchi：</span><br>
Take that!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Akatsuki：</span><br>
W-what in the?! Oh no!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ikazuchi：</span><br>
Alright, let's wreck some face!<br>

<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Akatsuki：</span><br>
... What just happened?<br>
<br>
K.O., flawless victory. Inazuma and Ikazuchi defeated us again.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Akatsuki：</span><br>
Even in a 2v1, we can't beat Ikazuchi... I-I mean, I'm just not familiar with the controls, that's all!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ikazuchi：</span><br>
Heheheh! You'd need TAS-like reaction speeds to beat me!<br>
<br>
The final score was 10-0 for Ikazuchi.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ikazuchi：</span><br>
Phew... I see! Games can be really fun!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Inazuma：</span><br>
However, it's not good to get addicted to them. Please tell her about the dangers of getting hooked on gaming, Akatsuki.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Akatsuki：</span><br>
......<br>
(Whispering) If only Hibiki were here...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Inazuma：</span><br>
Akatsuki? Is something the matter?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Akatsuki：</span><br>
N-nothing at all! I was just thinking out loud...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Inazuma：</span><br>
About Hibiki?<br>
I'm certain she's all right. Sometimes it's best not to worry about things like this. I'm sure the Commander agrees.<br>
<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项1：......</span>'''''<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Akatsuki：</span><br>
Is it...? ... I'm feeling somewhat tired, so I think I'll go home now...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ikazuchi：</span><br>
What's wrong, Akatsuki?<br>
<br>
It seems like Inazuma's attempt to reassure Akatsuki didn't have any effect.<br>
That got me thinking... Maybe Hibiki is the reason why Akatsuki's been reading the patrol reports so thoroughly every day...<br>

Port - Office<br>
I suppose I'll have to work overtime to finish all my fleet paperwork today.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Akatsuki：</span><br>
Everything from escort mission plans to practice schedules... We have many reports to read, indeed...<br>
Many, many reports... For most people, TOO many...<br>
However, a ninja must not lose heart to mere paperwork!<br>
Let us work hard and get through it together, Commander!<br>
<br>
At least Akatsuki seems motivated.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Akatsuki：</span><br>
That's the final report! We're finished!<br>
Oh, but it has gotten very late...<br>
<br>
Looking out through the window, we noticed it was now late into the night.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Akatsuki：</span><br>
... I'd better hurry home now... I have to attend Kuroshio's training tomorrow...<br>
<br>
What the...?!<br>
The lights in the office went out all of a sudden. It was pitch black.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">{namecode:11}：</span><br>
Eek?! D-d-darkness?!<br>
<br>
Suddenly, I felt that someone was holding onto me.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">{namecode:11}：</span><br>
......<br>
I-I-I apologize! I'm a-afraid of the dark... and I can't...<br>

Akatsuki was trembling.<br>
<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项1：Gently embrace Akatsuki back</span>'''''<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">{namecode:11}：</span><br>

Chapter 6 - In The Dark<br>
The lights in the office had gone out, rendering it pitch black. I wasn't sure how much time had passed...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">{namecode:11}：</span><br>
......<br>
I'm such a hopeless case...<br>
I'm supposed to a brave nameship, yet without my rigging, I dare not tread in dark places...<br>
But... I MUST be brave! Dark places, more than anywhere else, are where ninjas should excel...!<br>
Guh... And yet, my legs refuse to move...<br>
<br>
It felt like Akatsuki was tightening her embrace of me.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">{namecode:11}：</span><br>
I'm glad to have someone as kind, dependable, and mature as you, Commander.<br>
When I'm with you, I feel the courage within me start to well up.<br>
J-just let it well a little more, then I will clear the darkness enveloping us!<br>
<br>
... Wait a moment, if I recall correctly, there was a flashlight lying somewhere on the desk...<br>
<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项1：Tell Akatsuki where it is</span>'''''<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">{namecode:11}：</span><br>
S-so I was right!<br>
<br>
Akatsuki let go of me then went to the desk and felt around to find the flashlight.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">{namecode:11}：</span><br>
Ah! I've found it! Thank goodness!<br>
<br>
Akatsuki turned it on without any further delay.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Atlanta：</span><br>
... Huh?<br>
<br>
The flashlight illuminated the face of a certain person who must've come in after the lights went out.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Akatsuki：</span><br>
Eek?!<br>
<br>
Frightened by the sudden appearance of someone she wasn't expecting, Akatsuki fainted.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Atlanta：</span><br>
I just wanted to check how you were doing since I was in the area... Hey, a-are you okay?!<br>
<br>
In the end, it took a while for the lights (and Akatsuki) to return to normal.<br>
Apparently, the outage was caused by an experiment the research department was conducting... But that's a story for another time.<br>

There are still no signs of Hibiki...<br>

<br>
I decided to spend my day off with Akatsuki at the seaside.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Akatsuki：</span><br>
I've started getting somewhat used to waiting on Hibiki and you.<br>
I don't feel as lonely as I once used to...<br>
... T-that doesn't mean I've given up on Hibiki! By no means!<br>
However, I have you to thank for helping me get to this point, Commander.<br>
When you're by my side, I feel happy and at ease...<br>
And most important, I feel courageous!<br>
<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项1：Pat Akatsuki on the head</span>'''''<br>

I've always, always wished that all of DD6 could reunite at this port! Hibiki, Ikazuchi, Inazuma, all of my little sisters are very dear to me!<br>
No matter what would happen, we would always be together! We'd have you too, Commander!<br>
......<br>
Um, I want to tell you something! I-I think I'm in love with-<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ikazuchi：</span><br>
Hey, guys! What's up?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Akatsuki：</span><br>
Whawha?!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Inazuma：</span><br>
(Whispering) If only you could read the mood, Ikazuchi...<br>
<br>
Suddenly, Ikazuchi and Inazuma showed up.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ikazuchi：</span><br>
I was just wondering: wanna tag along for lunch?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Akatsuki：</span><br>
Sure! Let's go, together!<br>
<br>
I wonder what expression Akatsuki would make if one day all of DD6 were to reunite here.<br>
I'm sure she would smile with joy as deep as one can imagine.<br>
