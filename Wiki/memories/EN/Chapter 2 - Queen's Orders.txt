Liverpool - Strategic Command Room<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Saratoga：</span><br>
Now then, Commander, Enterprise, and my friends of the Royal Navy, let’s make Operation Siren a success!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Hood：</span><br>
Indeed. The Royal Navy is ready to set sail.<br>
So... Operation Siren is finally commencing in earnest.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Queen Elizabeth：</span><br>
An excellent speech, Hood. Well done.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Hood：</span><br>
It is an honour to receive your compliments, Your Majesty. If I may be frank, I would have preferred to hear Your Majesty’s speech.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Queen Elizabeth：</span><br>
Hood, you're better suited for this job than anyone else. Besides, it is not I who will be leading the Royal Navy this time.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Warspite：</span><br>
Your Majesty, are you sure you'll be fine handling the negotiations with the Crimson Axis?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Queen Elizabeth：</span><br>
Hmph. Since they sent the invitation, it would be rude for me not to accept. Besides, part of being in the Royal Navy is the willingness to take some risks.<br>
Think well about the situation, Warspite.<br>
We've bickered long against the Iron Blood, and for what? Now that Operation Siren is upon us, we finally have a chance to change that.<br>
There is one objective that unites us all - to take down the Sirens. Plain and simple.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Hood：</span><br>
I would normally agree with you, but...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Queen Elizabeth：</span><br>
Hm? Are you concerned about their top brass? Or perhaps about Friedrich? They certainly have been suspicious.<br>
But, I'll have George with me this time, so don't worry.<br>
Anyway, enough of that. Hood, Warspite, I'll be entrusting Operation Siren and the defense of the Royal Capital to you two!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Hood & Warspite：</span><br>
As you wish!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Queen Elizabeth：</span><br>
As for the Royal Maids... Bel, come with me. Sheffield is out on a separate mission, so... Newcastle, Edinburgh, you two will oversee operations in our absence!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Belfast：</span><br>
As you wish, Your Majesty. I will begin making arrangements.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Prince of Wales：</span><br>
Pardon me, Your Majesty, but I have a question. Do you know about the “thing” that was sent to the Commander from the Naval HQ?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Queen Elizabeth：</span><br>
TB? ...I've heard about it. What of it?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Prince of Wales：</span><br>
Yes. I understand that it was developed by the Naval HQ using the latest technology, but I was wondering if Your Majesty had any information about its identity.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Queen Elizabeth：</span><br>
No clue. I'm looking into it, but I don't have any details just yet.<br>
That thing says it “can't pass the Turing Test,” but don't you think that warrants suspicion in itself?<br>
Anyway, we can worry about that later... Does anyone have any other issues?<br>
If not, then our meeting is adjourned! Do your utmost to display the glory of the Royal Navy to the world. Good luck in Operation Siren!<br>

<br>
Liverpool - Royal Navy Fleet Rally Point<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Hood：</span><br>
Her Majesty has departed. Let us begin our operation as well.<br>
The objective of Operation Siren is to secure a forward base in the northeast sector of the NA Ocean and eliminate the Siren base in the center of the NA Ocean after the construction of the Outpost is completed.<br>
We won't be alone in this operation, as Iris Libre will also be lending us their power... Though our forces are more sparse than I would have liked, Her Majesty decided that these numbers would be sufficient considering the Sirens’ diminished power.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Duke of York：</span><br>
With the Siren threat absent from the waters of the Northern Parliament... what excuse have they to be absent?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Hood：</span><br>
The Sirens have not been retreating in areas other than the NA Ocean. They are as active as ever in the Polar regions, and it is unrealistic to expect the Northern Parliament to send their forces.<br>
Furthermore, negotiations between us and the Crimson Axis may go awry. It is necessary to leave some reserve forces back home, just in case.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Duke of York：</span><br>
Always leave a spare arrow in the quiver? Prudent enough...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Formidable：</span><br>
I wasn't even expecting Iris Libre to send any reinforcements. I heard Richelieu had her own share of problems... and was reluctant to participate in any negotiations with the Crimson Axis.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Hood：</span><br>
That is true, but fighting against the Sirens is a common goal we have, regardless of faction. The same holds for the Azur Lane - we have to demonstrate our unity to the Crimson Axis.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Formidable：</span><br>
That’s true. Richelieu isn't the impulsive type.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Newcastle：</span><br>
Do you copy, Miss Hood? This is Newcastle, currently leading the Royal Capital Reserve Fleet. Is this communicator working properly?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Hood：</span><br>
I hear you loud and clear, Newcastle. We can only hope that it stays that way as we venture deeper into Siren-controlled waters though....<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Newcastle：</span><br>
We'll do our best to support you. Since this communication device is a cutting-edge model just distributed from the Naval HQ, I wonder if it has resistance to Siren jamming.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Formidable：</span><br>
(I sure hope so... I don't want to go through that again...)<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Newcastle：</span><br>
I'll also be in charge of communications with Her Majesty, the Naval HQ, and the Commander as well. In the absence of their orders, Miss Hood, you are free to make your own decisions based upon the battlefield situation.<br>
Furthermore, if Her Majesty has made any progress in her matters, I will be sure to inform the fleet.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Hood：</span><br>
Understood. Thank you for your assistance.<br>
Now then, let’s formally begin Operation Siren. Please secure each zone one by one, according to our operation plan. Long live the Queen!<br>

<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Grenville：</span><br>
Hey there, are you two the reinforcements from the Iris Libre fleet? I'm Grenville, from the Royal Navy.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Le Téméraire：</span><br>
Hi there! I'm Le Téméraire, from Iris Libre... And, um, this here is L'Opiniâtre~ We've arrived safely!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Grenville：</span><br>
...Ah, sorry, sorry. Did I make things awkward? They're our friends though, so you don't have to be shy~<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">L'Opiniâtre：</span><br>
We've come from the Méditerranée at the behest of the Cardinal... We will now heed the instructions of the Royal Navy...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Grenville：</span><br>
See, that wasn't too bad! Anyway, let’s head to the resupply point first!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">L'Opiniâtre：</span><br>
Th-thanks... Tem, I'm glad you're here...<br>
Um, Tem...?？<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Le Téméraire：</span><br>
Woaaahh! I heard everyone would be here for Operation Siren, but seeing this in person is even more amazing!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Grenville：</span><br>
That’s right! Her Majesty transferred all the warships we could spare to this operation. We're gonna give those Sirens a good scare!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Le Téméraire：</span><br>
Woah! W-wow, we've gotta do our part too then! Opie, we're also gonna be heading out to the front lines!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">L'Opiniâtre：</span><br>
Tem, didn't you say you had to go to the supply point first?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Le Téméraire：</span><br>
Eh?! Uh, yeah! Ahaha...<br>

NA Ocean NE Sector - Royal Navy Operation Zone<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Kent：</span><br>
All right! Another wave of enemies wiped out!<br>
Would you look at that, Contestant Kent smashes through the first Siren barrier with ease!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Edinburgh：</span><br>
Just as rumoured, the enemies are sparser than usual. We've barely encountered any resistance even out this far.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Prince of Wales：</span><br>
Edinburgh, Kent, is everything going well on your end?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Kent：</span><br>
Piece of cake! If the Sirens are gonna roll over just like this, we'll be back home in no time!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Prince of Wales：</span><br>
Things are going better than I expected. Hm? Where are Norfolk and Suffolk?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Edinburgh：</span><br>
They're currently chasing down the routed Siren forces. Their formations are falling apart with even a mere touch......<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Prince of Wales：</span><br>
Mm, that’s what I'm hearing from the other teams as well. Apparently, the Sirens’ chain of command doesn't seem to be working properly.<br>
Hopefully, this is giving the Eagle Union some extra breathing room as well.<br>
Having that said... It’s unusual for Suffolk to take the initiative in chasing down the enemy.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Edinburgh：</span><br>
“She muttered something like, “the faster we wipe out the enemy, the sooner I can go back to watching the seagulls...”...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Prince of Wales：</span><br>
......<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Edinburgh：</span><br>
W-well, whatever her reasons might be... I'm just glad to see Suffolk giving it her best.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Prince of Wales：</span><br>
Heh, indeed. Keep up the good work as well, Edinburgh.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Edinburgh：</span><br>
Got that, Kent? We can't afford to fall behind either!<br>

<br>
NA Ocean NE Sector - Royal Navy Main Fleet<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Prince of Wales：</span><br>
Hood, all our forces are advancing smoothly and momentum is on our side. Shall we start scouting out the central zone?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Hood：</span><br>
That’s where the core of the Siren forces should be, right? ...We have no information about what we might be going up against.<br>
Until now, all the scouting we've done has been at a distance. There’s no telling what dangers are waiting for us at the heart of their territory.<br>
Even though the Sirens have been significantly weaker, I can't afford to underestimate the enemy and put our girls at risk...<br>
I hope that everyone else also is also exercising the proper amount of caution...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Communicator：</span><br>
Bzzt...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Newcastle：</span><br>
Miss Hood, the long-range receiver back at the Capital just received an emergency distress signal, but quickly lost contact with the fleet that sent the signal.<br>
We speculate that the signal may have been set from a friendly recon fleet, but we haven't determined which fleet that might be.<br>
However, we do know that the situation is urgent. I'm sending over the coordinates of the distress signal now, so please arrange a rescue operation with due haste.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Hood：</span><br>
These coordinates... No Royal Navy ships should've been deployed to this area...<br>
Newcastle, please send this information to the Eagle Union to verify if one of their fleets might’ve gotten lost in this area. We need to verify the authenticity of this signal.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Newcastle：</span><br>
Very well. I'll try to get in contact with the Eagle Union as soon as possible.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Duke of York：</span><br>
‘tis unlikely that the Eagle Union would stray out this far. Why would the Eagle Union be in this operation zone in the first place?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Hood：</span><br>
The only way to find out is to directly ask them... whether this signal really came from one of their ships...<br>
Having that said, we can't ignore the distress signal either. Formidable, which one of our fleets is closest to the coordinates?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Formidable：</span><br>
Grenville’s group should be the closest. However, considering their purpose was to link up with the Iris Libre forces, they might not be the most combat-capable.<br>
Hood, how about we take a small detachment to back them up? Hopefully it won't be too late.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Prince of Wales：</span><br>
I'll go too. If this is a trap laid by the Sirens, we do not want to risk them getting trapped in a Mirror Sea.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Hood：</span><br>
That’s settled then. Please join Grenville’s group and investigate the source of the distress signal. If something did happen, make sure to rescue the survivors.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Duke of York：</span><br>
Thou wouldst be wise to exercise caution, Wales, for the Sirens’ treachery knows no bounds.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Prince of Wales：</span><br>
Heh, I'm glad you're worried about me. In any case, let’s get going.<br>

NA Ocean NE Sector - Incident Site<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Grenville：</span><br>
The distress signal came from over there!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">L'Opiniâtre：</span><br>
From this distance, it doesn't look like there’s anything over there. Just another gloomy patch of ocean...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Grenville：</span><br>
Formidable and Prince of Wales are on their way to join us. We were told to keep our distance until they arrive.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Le Téméraire：</span><br>
Let’s circle around and take a look! All we have to do is keep our distance, right?<br>
{{折叠面板|内容结束}}

{{折叠面板|标题=Desolation|选项=7|主框=1|样式=primary|展开=否}}
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Le Téméraire：</span><br>
You really can't see anything from this distance, huh... Can't even tell what kind of ship might’ve sent that signal.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Grenville：</span><br>
We'll have to take a closer look after all.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">L'Opiniâtre：</span><br>
I don't see any friendly ships here, but there aren't many Sirens either...<br>
All I'm seeing are the destroyed husks of Siren ships, but I don't think any Royal Navy ships passed through this area.<br>
If a force large enough to wipe out all these Sirens really did pass through here, Hood must've heard about it by now.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Grenville：</span><br>
Good point. What could've happened here?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Formidable：</span><br>
...Did the three of you take out all these Sirens...??<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Prince of Wales：</span><br>
That’s some real magic if I've ever seen it.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Grenville：</span><br>
Eh...? N-no, it wasn't us! This place was already like this when we came here! This place is covered with destroyed Siren ships and facilities, and there’s no fleet in distress here as far as I can tell...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Prince of Wales：</span><br>
I see... This must've been a Siren research facility. Everything here, including its defenses, must've been swept by some powerful force.<br>
Even this Siren battleship has been cut cleanly apart.<br>
This isn't something that Warspite would do...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Formidable：</span><br>
Hm... What’s that over there? It’s a clean puncture. Almost could pass for a porthole...<br>
Wales, do we have any weapons that are capable of that?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Prince of Wales：</span><br>
Not that I know of... This kind of damage looks as if it was caused by Purifier’s laser weapon...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Grenville：</span><br>
Sirens turning against each other? Is something like that possible...?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Formidable：</span><br>
Or... it might be someone using Siren technology. In any case, it feels like we're getting closer to the truth...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Prince of Wales：</span><br>
The answer should lie at the coordinates we've been given. Everyone, stay alert as you move forward.<br>

<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Formidable：</span><br>
(...Wales, I think someone’s watching us.)<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Prince of Wales：</span><br>
(Yes, I feel it too. Just a vague intuition though.)<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Le Téméraire：</span><br>
Eh? There’s nothing showing up on the radar though...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Formidable：</span><br>
It’s odd how there are enemies that we can't detect on— Wait, in front of us!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Prince of Wales：</span><br>
Hold, Formidable! We're only here on a rescue mission! We don't have the firepower to fight against the Ashes right now!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Formidable：</span><br>
I know... But I just wanted to see who - or what - they really are. But they're fast, my recon didn't manage to get a glimpse of them.<br>
But... Hmm...? Wait, is that... an Eagle Union fleet?!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Prince of Wales：</span><br>
There really was an Eagle Union fleet here? ...Thank goodness we made it in time then...<br>

<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Bush：</span><br>
Atlanta, look! The Royal Navy’s rescue fleet is here!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Atlanta：</span><br>
Thank goodness... I was starting to think that it didn't go through...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Prince of Wales：</span><br>
This is Prince of Wales, from the Royal Navy. We picked up your distress signal.<br>
But to my understanding, this zone is outside of the Eagle Union’s operational area...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Atlanta：</span><br>
This is Atlanta of the Eagle Union. We were tasked with a special research mission by the Naval HQ, independent from the Commander’s operation fleets.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Formidable：</span><br>
...A special research mission? What could that be about? This whole sector has turned into a warfront!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Atlanta：</span><br>
So this is the situation... When I was investigating an abandoned Siren research facility, the weather conditions suddenly shifted abnormally. I'm here to research what caused that, and eliminate any hidden dangers.<br>
We were able to collect some samples, but were caught in a Mirror Sea on our way back. Before we knew it, we found ourselves whisked away to a completely different area.<br>
Just when we were about to get engulfed by the swarms of Sirens, someone came to our rescue at the crucial moment - she looked just like Ark Royal.<br>
She crushed the Siren fleet effortlessly... and disappeared just as quickly after that.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Bush：</span><br>
We didn't even get a chance to thank her!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Formidable：</span><br>
Ark Royal isn't assigned to this zone, but there’s also no way your force would've been able to defeat such a large number of Sirens without help... Could it have been Ashes...?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Bush：</span><br>
Huh? Ashes? What’s that?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Le Téméraire：</span><br>
I want to know too! You were talking about that too on our way here!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Formidable：</span><br>
Hmm... Did the Naval HQ really deploy you out here without telling you anything?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Atlanta：</span><br>
What do you mean?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Prince of Wales：</span><br>
Formidable, what we know about Ashes is classified information. It’s not unusual that they wouldn't know.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Formidable：</span><br>
Sure, but shouldn't they at least tell the fleets that are out here fighting?<br>
It’s highly possible that the “Ark Royal” you met was not the real Ark Royal, but rather a member of an organisation known as “Ashes.” They have appearances similar to ours but have vastly greater power. They don't show up on our radars, almost completely refuse to communicate, and behave totally unpredictably.<br>
We know nothing about where they came from or what their purpose is. Though they might’ve saved you this time, know that the Ashes are no friends of ours.<br>
I can't tell you anything more about them, but maybe the Commander or Enterprise would have some more information.<br>
Oh, Le Téméraire, you can probably also ask Richelieu after you get back.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Le Téméraire：</span><br>
Really? Do you think she would tell me?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Prince of Wales：</span><br>
I'm sure she will. Anyway, there’s no point in dallying here any longer. Let’s return to one of our ports first.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Atlanta：</span><br>
Wait... The sample of the mass-produced Siren we collected was lost when we were attacked earlier. If we don't go back to look for it, I won't be able to complete the mission...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Formidable：</span><br>
Are you daft? You won't be able to complete the mission if you sink either.<br>
You're in waters under the Royal Navy’s jurisdiction, so behave yourself and listen to us. All right?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Atlanta：</span><br>
O-okay...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Formidable：</span><br>
Good. Let’s all get back into formation then and prepare to head back. Remember, our mission’s not over until you get back to port safely.<br>

<br>
NA Ocean Core Sector Outskirts - Royal Navy Main Fleet<br>
KABOOOOM!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Hood：</span><br>
The closer we get to the core sector, the more intense the Sirens are fighting back...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Warspite：</span><br>
We've besieged the Sirens on all fronts, and this is their last holdout. I'd be worried if they didn't try to put up a fight.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Duke of York：</span><br>
The harder the prey struggles before its demise, the sweeter the thrill of the hunt.~<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Warspite：</span><br>
Yes, a struggle is all this will amount to. We've already secured zone after zone, just like we planned.<br>
Once we finish establishing the Outpost, We'll have a foothold in the heart of the NA Ocean.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Hood：</span><br>
Everything’s been going smoothly. At this rate, we'll be done with the first phase of the operation soon.<br>
Then, all that remains is to launch an all-out attack against the Sirens.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Queen Elizabeth：</span><br>
Heheh! Well done, Hood, Warspite! Wee've managed to beat the Eagle Union here!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Hood：</span><br>
Thank you, Your Majesty. How fares your business?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Queen Elizabeth：</span><br>
We did run into some problems, but... the ceasefire agreement was still signed. The squabbling between factions shouldn't follow us into the NA Ocean.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Hood：</span><br>
Splendid! I am most pleased to hear the good news. We'll also be able to call for reinforcements from the Capital.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Queen Elizabeth：</span><br>
Indeed. Not having to worry about an Iron Blood attack allows us to consolidate our forces.<br>
Having that said, I also don't want the Iron Blood fleet running around freely either. The negotiations almost got torpedoed because of the Tirpitz incident...~<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Warspite：</span><br>
But Your Majesty still managed to overcome these challenges! A magnificent job indeed!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Queen Elizabeth：</span><br>
Hehe, speak nothing of it! A true queen must move first so that her subordinates may follow!<br>
More importantly, the Crimson Axis seems serious about participating in Operation Siren.<br>
Regarding the Sakura Empire’s fleet... Akagi herself is here. I'll have Sheffield send you the details later.<br>
Where’s Prince of Wales though?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Hood：</span><br>
We received a distress signal from an independent Eagle Union research fleet. Wales assembled a rescue team and is now escorting the members of that fleet back to the Capital.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Queen Elizabeth：</span><br>
Research fleet...? Hm...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Warspite：</span><br>
Is something amiss, Your Majesty?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Queen Elizabeth：</span><br>
No, but I am curious... What do you think of making such a small force act independently when there’s such a large-scale operation in progress?<br>
Just think about that for now. Anyway, you'll hear more from me later.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Hood：</span><br>
Something seems to have upset Her Majesty...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Duke of York：</span><br>
No smoke without fire, as they say. If the Eagle Union is sending fleets to investigate, they must know something we don't.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Warspite：</span><br>
Let’s not overthink things and just focus on the battle, since we have problems of our own. Hood, take a look at this.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Hood：</span><br>
What is it...?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Warspite：</span><br>
This message arrived at about the same time as Her Majesty’s transmission. Extreme weather suddenly kicked up around the Outpost.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Hood：</span><br>
More of this abnormal weather? ...I wonder if this is due to a Mirror Sea. Considering how we're practically in the Sirens’ front yard...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Warspite：</span><br>
I'll look into it. Hood, please take command of the fleet.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Hood：</span><br>
It shall be done. Best of luck.<br>

NA Ocean Core Sector Outskirts - 2nd Outpost<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Edinburgh：</span><br>
Everyone, pay attention! From here, if you fire a shell forward...<br>
<br>
The shell fired from Edinburgh’s gun suddenly changed direction and plummeted harmlessly into the ocean.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Warspite：</span><br>
What’s going on? There’s no hint of wind or waves here, but it’s as if the shell was passing through water...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Edinburgh：</span><br>
That’s not the only unusual thing. Here, I'll shoot another one from the same angle position. Look.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Rodney：</span><br>
The second shell travelled farther than the first?!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Norfolk：</span><br>
Yeah... Even if you shoot at the same place, it’s like every shell ends up somewhere a bit different.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Kent：</span><br>
Edinburgh first noticed this when engaging the Sirens here. After the battle, we went inside that area to check it out a bit more, and things got even weirder!<br>
When I was sailing through those waters, sometimes I felt light and floaty, and other times I could barely even keep my rigging upright. It’s like the gravity across this whole area is all messed up...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Suffolk：</span><br>
I won't even be able to slack off at this rate! Err, I mean... I can't even do my job normally because of the abnormal gravity!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Rodney：</span><br>
Suffolk is right. This anomaly can only be explained by gravity or magnetism.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Warspite：</span><br>
Your intuitions are correct. There’s no natural phenomenon that can explain this sudden change in gravity. The Sirens must've deployed some kind of device in a Mirror Sea.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Suffolk：</span><br>
So... Uhh... Now that we've figured it out, we don't have to go back in there, right?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Warspite：</span><br>
Of course we do. If we can't secure the deployment of this outpost, we won't be able to continue the operation smoothly. Besides, are you just going to walk away after seeing some Siren scheme unfold before your eyes?<br>
But, don't worry. We have our enemy outgunned, and there’s another team observing the situation outside the Mirror Sea. If we see the device, we'll destroy it and put an end to this.<br>
Now then, everyone, let us prepare for battle!<br>

<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Rodney：</span><br>
Is anyone else getting nauseous from being inside this place...?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Warspite：</span><br>
Mm, considering how erratically the gravity is shifting around, this would be difficult for a normal person to tolerate, let alone one of us with our rigging.<br>
There are some mass-produced Siren stragglers just ahead of us. Let’s use them to calibrate our shots and to get as familiar with fighting under these conditions as possible.<br>

<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Kent：</span><br>
Ughh... My head’s getting all spinny...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Norfolk：</span><br>
It’s not only the trajectory of our shells that’s being affected... even our torpedoes won't work properly... It’s bloody difficult trying to hit the enemy like this...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Rodney：</span><br>
If distance is an issue, then all we have to do is close the gap... After all, gravity can't mess with the strike of a sword.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Suffolk：</span><br>
Warspite, Edinburgh and I found a really weird Siren! No matter what kind of attacks we throw at it, it won't fight back!<br>
But our attacks aren't doing anything to its armour either! Come help us out over here!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Warspite：</span><br>
A Siren that isn't fighting back...? Has it lost its command module and its ability to move?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Edinburgh：</span><br>
*panting* ...Warspite, over there! That’s the strange Siren...!<br>
I don't have any data on it. It might even be a new model...<br>
<span style="color:#ec5d53;">？？？：</span><br>
......<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Rodney：</span><br>
Eat this! Haaaah!<br>
It didn't even flinch...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Warspite：</span><br>
No, Rodney... You didn't even land a hit on its armour in the first place.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Rodney：</span><br>
Huh?! How’s that possible? I could've sworn I landed a direct hit...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Warspite：</span><br>
No, your aim was true, but the explosion wasn't because you landed a hit. The fuse activated before the shell even touched the Siren.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Rodney：</span><br>
In other words, both the shell and the explosion “disappeared” before reaching the armor...?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Warspite：</span><br>
That seems to be the case...<br>
The Naval HQ needs to hear about this. Everyone, retreat immediately and stay away from this zone!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Edinburgh：</span><br>
Warspite! The Siren’s moving!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Norfolk：</span><br>
Eeeeeeeek?!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Warspite：</span><br>
We're no match for that thing! Everyone, hurry and retreat this instant!<br>
<span style="color:#ec5d53;">？？？：</span><br>
Hnnnnnnnnhhh...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Kent：</span><br>
The Siren... suddenly vanished...?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Edinburgh：</span><br>
Wh-wh-wh-what just happened?! Sirens suddenly appearing and disappearing from thin air, all these strange phenomena... I'm going to be writing reports for the rest of my life!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Rodney：</span><br>
Warspite, something feels familiar about that Siren. I'm not quite sure what it is, but I think we'll be able to defeat it.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Warspite：</span><br>
...We don't have much of a choice right now. Everyone, We'll find out right here and now whether we can make that enemy bleed! Begin attacking!<br>

<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Suffolk：</span><br>
Finally... the last enemy is down!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Kent：</span><br>
Contestant Kent... is about to bow out... H-huh?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Edinburgh：</span><br>
*panting* ...Just what kind of enemy was that...? But... at least, it looks like the gravity abnormality is starting to clear up.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Rodney：</span><br>
I think you're right. The gravity is starting to stabilise.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Norfolk：</span><br>
D-does that mean we're safe now...?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Warspite：</span><br>
Yeah. Our communications are back online as well.<br>
Edinburgh, you really helped me understand that enemy’s weak point.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Edinburgh：</span><br>
Huh? O-oh, thank you, Lady Warspite...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Warspite：</span><br>
We need to report what happened here to Her Majesty. About this Mirror Sea, and about that Siren...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Edinburgh：</span><br>
Yes...！<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Warspite：</span><br>
(...A new type of Siren that can manipulate gravity. We have no idea just how strong it is, but we do know that we can't afford to ignore this threat.)<br>
(Even after we finish building the second Outpost, We'll have to come up with countermeasures.)<br>
Edinburgh, you and Hood will head back with me. Rodney, stay here and oversee the construction of the Outpost.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Everyone：</span><br>
Understood!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Warspite：</span><br>
The situation is becoming a lot more complicated than I expected... I can only hope that the rest of the Operation proceeds smoothly......<br>
