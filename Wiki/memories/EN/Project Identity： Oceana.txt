Port - Office<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
"Project Identity"? Hang on, haven't we already finished raising you?<br>
<br>
Staring puzzled at the project papers on my desk, I turn to TB for an explanation.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">TB ：</span><br>
Question received. The contents of this project do not clash with the previous project.<br>
Analysis complete. It would be appropriate to retitle this project as "Project Identity 2.0."<br>
I will now reprint the document and share it with Akashi.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Akashi? Did she come up with this?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">TB ：</span><br>
Negative. Akashi and I created this project in collaboration.<br>
Additionally, I requested assistance from Akashi, which she provided.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Huh?<br>
<br>
Before I can get another word in with TB, a voice I'm well-acquainted with cuts in.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Akashi：</span><br>
Did someone call, nya?<br>
<br>
With perfect timing, the green cat appears in my office, like a familiar summoned through the utterance of its name.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
When did you get here?<br>
Actually, don't answer that...<br>
Now that you're both here, could you explain what this project is?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">TB ：</span><br>
Question received. Thanks to Project Identity, I have gained a tremendous amount of cognitive data.<br>
Therefore, I believe that your excellent qualities – such as your friendliness and sense of responsibility – have the potential to yield even greater value.<br>
I managed to discover a personality of my own thanks to your repeated training. That being said...<br>
The experience I can gain is always limited to the contents of your training process starting from scratch.<br>
While each instance yields different results, the data collection process has presently reached the point of diminishing returns.<br>
As it stands, there are no prospects of deepening my understanding of individuality.<br>
That being the case, I asked Akashi for assistance with drafting a new project.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Akashi：</span><br>
Simply put, TB's training has hit a bottleneck, nya. She needs new data, nya.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
But if it has hit a bottleneck, how is training her further going to achieve anything?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Akashi：</span><br>
That's where the new project comes in, nya! You'll be raising someone else this time, nya!<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
You mean another AI? Do we even have another AI besides TB at the port?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Akashi：</span><br>
We do, nya! Oceana, nya!<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
...Why her, in particular?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Akashi：</span><br>
Because she's got a lot of potential inside her, nya!<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Even assuming you have a way to gauge that, isn't there a bigger problem? Namely, that she has no will of her own.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Akashi：</span><br>
Nyahaha. I got TB to fix that, nya.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">TB ：</span><br>
Affirmative. I have created a basic personality for her.<br>
It was based on the analysis of recorded data, surveys filled out by members of the port, and parameters set by Akashi.<br>
We only need your consent, then Akashi will upload the personality data to your device.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Isn't it kind of pointless to raise her if she already comes with a personality?<br>
I mean... Isn't that the goal? To develop a personality?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">TB ：</span><br>
That is correct. The question is if an existing personality can change based on upbringing.<br>
If it can, I will record the results.<br>
This data holds incredible value for my study into personalities.<br>
You may decide whether or not to proceed with the project. Ultimately, I'm just making a wish to you.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
("Making a wish"... TB has never used that phrase before.)<br>
(You could take that as proof that cultivating her personality has produced results.)<br>
Well, if it's a personal request from you, then I guess I could try.<br>
Is the process the same as last time?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Akashi：</span><br>
It's been simplified a little, nya.<br>
Since Oceana already has a foundation to work off of, some of the earlier steps can be skipped, nya.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
I see. Then I just have one question before we fully go ahead with this.<br>
Are there plans to expand Project Identity in the future?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">TB ：</span><br>
It's hard to say at the moment. It is a possibility that this process will not yield sufficient data to break through the bottleneck.<br>
However, as there is ample data saved, it will be possible to perform other personality simulations in the future.<br>
Should the 2.0 version produce insufficient data, we can keep trying with versions 3.0, 4.0, and so forth.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
By the time we're done, I'll be the most experienced parent in the world.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">TB ：</span><br>
Judging by context and your phrasing, I will interpret this as a "joke."<br>
I will now provide an appropriate emotional response based on my current training data.<br>
Ha. Ha. Ha.<br>
<br>
A laugh devoid of emotion spills out from TB's mouth.<br>
While it may not seem like much, it is substantial progress for her.<br>
I write my signature on the documents. Akashi quickly takes them and cradles them in her arms.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Akashi：</span><br>
Nyahaha! I'll go and get things ready then, nya!<br>
Just need to fine-tune a few things, and with TB's help, I'll be done in no time, nya!<br>
Don't worry, I won't charge you anything, nya. Not this time, anyway, nya!<br>

<br>
Port - Office<br>
Five days have passed since Akashi proclaimed that she would be "done in no time."<br>
As I organize my schedule and review the next item on the agenda, someone places a familiar device on my desk.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Oh, isn't this that immersion device I used while raising TB?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Akashi：</span><br>
Sure is, nya! It contains the virtual town you're oh-so-familiar with, nya.<br>
Oh, but there have been a few small changes since you went in last time, nya.<br>
You know how TB's interested in the effects of environment and upbringing on a personality, nya?<br>
Well, I got some very colorful personalities to help us out this time, nya.<br>
They'll appear in the city, and you'll be able to visit them, nya!<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Whoa, hold up – "visit them"?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Akashi：</span><br>
You'll get it when you unlock the feature, nya.<br>
Don't fuss over the details, just put it on, nya! Don't keep the star of the show waiting, nya!<br>
<br>
Nodding, I equip the device. Akashi walks up to me with a tablet in her hands.<br>
On the other side of the screen, TB gives me a quick nod.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">TB ：</span><br>
System confirmation: Growth target has been set. Target: Oceana – Navi.<br>
Transferring growth missions now.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Alright.<br>
<br>
The familiar bright light fills my vision...<br>
{{折叠面板|内容结束}}

{{折叠面板|标题=Nice to Meet You?|选项=3|主框=1|样式=primary|展开=是}}
<br>
Little by little, my surroundings become clear to me.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
They even rebuilt the house, huh?<br>
<br>
I take a look around and discover that the layout of the whole place has changed, then take a seat on the couch.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
(Navi... That's an interesting name.)<br>
(Oceana was given a personality, and with it, a new moniker.)<br>
(Now I'm curious what her personality is like, and how I should speak to her...)<br>
<br>
While I'm pondering how to introduce myself, I hear a faint noise coming from the entrance.<br>
The door opens, and a young girl steps inside.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Navi：</span><br>
Hmph. You're the dweeb who's gonna be looking after me, eh?<br>
Well, nice to meet you! Be a good guardian, or whatever♪<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Uh, nice to meet you...<br>
(So they've given her basic cognition and language capabilities. Doesn't look like I'll need to teach her much about those.)<br>
(It's incredible how far we've come. Maybe soon we'll have more AIs around the port.)<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Navi：</span><br>
That's it? That's your introduction? Wow, you're living up to your dweeb name already.<br>
You know what? You should be thanking ME for letting you take care of me!<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Ohh. So this is how you're gonna be.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Navi：</span><br>
What's that? Is something not to your liking, huh, dweeb?<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
......<br>
(She's just a kid. Don't let her get to you.)<br>
(It's a total mystery to me in what way growing up is going to change her...)<br>
<br>
While thinking that to myself, I extend a hand to her.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Welcome to your home, Navi.<br>
<br>
She extends her own small hand and grasps mine.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Navi：</span><br>
Hmph. Guess I've got a hopeless adult to babysit now! Oh well!<br>

{{折叠面板|标题=What to Call You|选项=4|主框=1|样式=primary|展开=是}}
<br>
Navi finishes her tour around the place. She plops herself down on the couch, looking content.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Navi：</span><br>
Wooow. I'm surprised a dweeb can keep their place in such good order.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Are you always going to call me that?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Navi：</span><br>
Nah.<br>
I could call you "guardian" or just say "you," but that's just boring.<br>
Calling you "dweeb" is both unique and clear.<br>
Buuut, if you REALLY want me to call you something else, I might consider it.<br>
Go on, say it. What do you want me to call you?<br>
{{折叠面板|内容结束}}

{{折叠面板|标题=The Magic Words|选项=5|主框=1|样式=primary|展开=是}}
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Navi：</span><br>
I see, I see. {tb}. That's what you want me to call you, huh?<br>
Alright, then from now on, you're {tb}!<br>
<br>
And so, the curtains rose on Navi's and my time spent living together.<br>
{{折叠面板|内容结束}}

{{折叠面板|标题=Her Other Side|选项=6|主框=1|样式=primary|展开=是}}
<br>
Music enriches the soul – with that sentiment in mind, I gave Navi a pair of headphones and a music player.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Navi：</span><br>
Ooh, for me? You may be a dweeb, {tb}, but you're a surprisingly thoughtful dweeb♪<br>
Since you're so keen on this, I'll accept. Aren't I kind? Aren't you grateful?<br>
<br>
She's the recipient of this gift, yet for some reason, she thinks I should be thanking her.<br>
<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项1：(Teach her about the magic words.)</span>'''''<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项2：(Forget it.)</span>'''''<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项1）</span>'''''When someone does something like this for you, you're supposed to say, "Thank you."<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Navi：</span><br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项1）</span>'''''You want me to thank you, huh? Wow, getting ahead of yourself much?<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项1）</span>'''''You really crave the appreciation, don't you? What a pain in the butt.<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项1）</span>'''''Well, fine. If you're so excited to hear it...<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项1）</span>'''''Th-thanks! You dweeb!<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项2）</span>'''''(Underneath that cocky attitude, she seems happy, at least.)<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项2）</span>'''''(If only she'd be more honest with herself. Whatever – better not rock the boat.)<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Navi：</span><br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项2）</span>'''''Hey! Why're you staring at me like that? You better not be looking down on me as just some kid!<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项2）</span>'''''I swear, if you are... Hmph!<br>
<br>
With a slightly embarrassed look on her face, she puffs up her cheeks.<br>
Her childlike features jump out adorably. I can't help but relax my attitude.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Ugh... Anyway, it's dinnertime. What do you want to eat?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Navi：</span><br>
Hah! You finally remembered, huh?<br>
I'm not picky, so I'll have anything that tastes yummy. No crappy foods, though!<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Right... I'll see what I can cook up.<br>
<br>
I put together dinner using some ingredients in the kitchen. After that, I returned to my office and got cracking on my incomplete work.<br>
By the time I wrapped things up, it was already well into the night.<br>
While flexing my stiff shoulders, I remember that I left Navi by herself.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Hmm... I wonder if she's gone to bed as she should. I'd better take a quick look.<br>
<br>
Late at Night - Navi's Room<br>
The house is pitch black, save for the little bit of light creeping through the door to Navi's room.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
(The door is open and the lights are on... Maybe she's scared and can't fall asleep?)<br>
<br>
I walk up to her bedroom and gently knock on the half-open door.<br>
There is no response.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
(That's odd... Did she fall asleep with the lights on? I should have a look.)<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Navi：</span><br>
Hmm-hmm♪<br>
<br>
Surrounded by stuffed animals and toys, Navi has her headphones on and is moving her feet in rhythm to the song.<br>
She is completely immersed in the world of music.<br>
Suddenly, she looks up and notices me. Her expression makes a total change and she loses her cool.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Navi：</span><br>
Huh?! Hey! Didn't your mommy teach you to knock?! Hmph!<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
I did, but you probably didn't hear me because of your headphones.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Navi：</span><br>
My... L-look, don't go jumping to conclusions! I'm not listening to this because I WANT to!<br>
I just... I just would've felt guilty if I'd never used them!<br>
I'm only listening to this stuff to not make you sad! Got it?<br>
<br>
She puts the headphones away whilst muttering under her breath, then rises to her feet on the carpet.<br>
Seeing her trying her hardest to play it cool, I decide to...<br>
<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项1：(Pat her head.)</span>'''''<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项2：(Tell her it's bedtime.)</span>'''''<br>
<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项1）</span>'''''I reach out, placing my hand on her head and patting it.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Navi：</span><br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项1）</span>'''''H-hey! What're you doing?!<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项1）</span>'''''You're gonna mess up my hair! Stupid moron!<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项1）</span>'''''Alright, alright, I'll stop. You should go to bed now. It's late.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Navi：</span><br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项1）</span>'''''So what? I'm not a baby who needs nappy time! Leave me alone...<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项1）</span>'''''Actually... Fine, if you insist on it, I'll go to bed.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项2）</span>'''''The music isn't going anywhere. You can listen to it tomorrow. Right now, it's time for bed.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Navi：</span><br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项2）</span>'''''Hmph! Leave me alone!<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项2）</span>'''''...You know what? Fine, {tb}. If it means so much to you, I'll go to sleep!<br>
<br>
With a rebellious attitude, she gets into bed and tucks herself in under the sheets.<br>
I adjust the sheets for her and turn off the lights. The room is enveloped in blackness.<br>
The moon shines through the window, casting a gentle light onto her bed.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Navi：</span><br>
Hmph... Don't you have something to say? Gosh, you can be such a jerk.<br>
At least say, "Good night," or I'm gonna be mad.<br>
<br>
I hear her grumbling.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Navi：</span><br>
If I have a nightmare tonight, it's gonna be all your fault!<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Good night, Navi. Sweet dreams.<br>
<br>
With a strained smile, I shake my head and quietly leave her room.<br>

<br>
Navi has been studying a curriculum suited to her current cognitive and rational abilities.<br>
Unfortunately, studying doesn't seem to affect her personality much. It only nurtures her intellect.<br>
As she sits next to me on the couch, dangling her feet off the side while munching on snacks, I glance at her and think deeply.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
(As it stands, maybe I should give her more free rein to do what she wants.)<br>
<br>
With the freedom to do whatever she wants, I can jump in at suitable moments and guide her.<br>
First of all, though, I have to find out what she wants to do and what she likes.<br>
After picking her brain with numerous questions, I bring her to a toystore in the commercial area.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Navi：</span><br>
Hey, {tb}! Look at this! Wait, no, that one's even better! Forget it – I want them ALL!<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Do you really NEED that many?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Navi：</span><br>
"That many"? Hang on, you don't think I'm gonna be happy with just ONE single toy, do you?<br>
Ohh. I see how it is...<br>
<br>
She strikes a pose, placing both hands on her hips while looking at me with pity.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Navi：</span><br>
You're so broke you can only afford a single toy, am I right?<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
......<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Navi：</span><br>
Fiiine. If you're that miserable, I'll let you off the hook and tolerate fewer toys.<br>
You should be thankful that I'm so magnanimous!<br>
<br>
Ignoring her smug attitude, I retrieve some of the toys she had her eyes on and present them to her.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
You can choose one.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Navi：</span><br>
Only ONE?! Wow! You are fricking STINGY! I told you I wanted them ALL!<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
One. Take it or leave it.<br>
<br>
Realizing that I'm not going to budge, she quickly compromises.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Navi：</span><br>
Hmph... Fine! I'll take one!<br>
But only because the other toys don't look that cool! Got it?<br>
<br>
She promptly takes the very first toy she laid eyes on, then tugs on my arm to urge me forward.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Navi：</span><br>
Okay, now go and pay for it!<br>
<br>
Later, as soon as we return home, she becomes obsessed with her new toy.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Navi：</span><br>
Enemy plane spotted! Shoot it down! Brrrrt!<br>
<br>
Mimicking the sound of machine-gun fire, she flies the toy through the air with her hand.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Navi：</span><br>
Hm... Hang on, this might work!<br>
Combination move! Activate new form! Heheh!<br>
<br>
She takes hold of it with both hands, then pulls on each half and snaps the toy in two.<br>
Holding up the broken halves, her face is filled with pure, childlike happiness.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Navi：</span><br>
Heh! Look at this, {tb}! It's my ultimate technique – segmented attack mode!<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
......<br>
<br>
Oh boy. Looks like I'll have to buy a new toy for her.<br>

Navi has been studying a curriculum suited to her current cognitive and rational abilities.<br>
Unfortunately, studying doesn't seem to affect her personality much. It only nurtures her intellect.<br>
As she sits next to me on the couch, dangling her feet off the side while munching on snacks, I glance at her and think deeply.<br>

<br>
With the freedom to do whatever she wants, I can jump in at suitable moments and guide her.<br>
First of all, though, I have to find out what she wants to do and what she likes.<br>
After picking her brain with numerous questions, I bring her to a bookstore in the commercial area.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Are you really going to read ALL of these?<br>
<br>
Examining the pile of books she placed in my arms, I then turn my gaze to her.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Navi：</span><br>
Yeah! Trust me, {tb}, I will. I'll read every last one from cover to cover!<br>
<br>
She gently tugs on my sleeve and looks at me with a beaming smile.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Navi：</span><br>
Do you think you could... pay for them all? Just this once.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Come again?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Navi：</span><br>
I'm going to start saving up my allowance and pay for the books by myself.<br>
But this time, there are so many books I want to read and my allowance can't pay for them all...<br>
I know you're always working super hard. I don't wanna make you pay for everything forever...<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
(That's surprisingly responsible, coming from her.)<br>
Don't worry about it. If there's ever anything you want, just tell me.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Navi：</span><br>
Aww, you're so nice. Thank you!<br>
<br>
I paid for the books and we went home. Navi immediately put on some casual clothes, sat down on the couch, and quietly started reading.<br>
The warm, yellow light in the room gently falls on her, enveloping her in a soft aura.<br>
An open hardcover fairy tale rests in her lap while she reclines. She is completely engrossed in the book.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Navi：</span><br>
Ooh... This writing is really good!<br>
<br>
Her genuine smile seems to say that she's been fully immersed in the book's world.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Navi：</span><br>
Hey, {tb}, wanna read it with me? This story is great!<br>
But there are a few words I don't know here and there... It'd be great if you could explain them to me.<br>
<br>
She lifts her head to look at me, eyes sparkling and full of joy.<br>

<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
"Outdoor activities are a type of exercise that is indispensable for a child's health. Making effective use of their time outdoors can improve their sense of balance and foster a sense of cooperation..."<br>
<br>
I close the book I found in the library and furrow my brow a little.<br>
Judging by her current personality, Navi shouldn't be against the idea of playing outdoors.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
You know, yeah – going outside might be a good choice.<br>
<br>
With my mind made, I equip the device again.<br>
As always, there's a bright light, followed by the virtual town coming into view.<br>
After quickly getting some things in order, I bring Navi with me outdoors.<br>
Just an inch away from the finish line, relay baton in hand, the corners of Navi's lips bend into a rather proud smile.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Navi：</span><br>
Did you see that, {tb}? I won by a landslide!<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Yeah. You did great.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Navi：</span><br>
Heh! It was a total walk in the park for me!<br>
<br>
She triumphantly swings the baton around and takes on an even more boastful attitude.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Navi：</span><br>
My victory was inevitable! A dweeb with no stamina like you would never beat me!<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Are you taunting me now?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Navi：</span><br>
Taunting? I'm just stating facts!<br>
You work at a desk all day! It's obvious you don't have any endurance! Losety loser!<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Oh yeah? Do you wanna try me?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Navi：</span><br>
Huh? Are you challenging me?<br>
Heheh! I'll give you a friendly tip – when you lose, you should just admit it!<br>
<br>
Navi and I run all the way home, messing around along the way.<br>

The gentle afternoon sun shines on the garden of a farm.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Navi：</span><br>
Okay... That's perfect!<br>
<br>
Navi carefully piles soil onto the flower that she just planted.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Navi：</span><br>
{tb}! Great timing!<br>
I finished planting the flower while you went away to buy drinks!<br>
<br>
Aware of my arrival, she looks up at me with a beaming smile. There is a small and endearing spot of dirt on her cheek.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
I'm surprised that gardening is your preferred kind of outdoor activity.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Navi：</span><br>
Heehee! It's outdoors, so it counts!<br>
I am getting exercise by digging holes and carrying flower pots around, too.<br>
Oh, also, please bring me back here later. I wanna look after this flower.<br>
We'll make sure it grows big and strong!<br>
<br>
We exchange a pinky promise, then walk back home feeling at peace.<br>

<br>
As of late, Navi has become really passionate about studying. She even insists on staying behind after school so she can self-teach.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
(Surely her classes aren't THAT demanding...)<br>
(I might have to talk with TB and Akashi later and adjust the curriculum a little bit.)<br>
<br>
I exhale a sigh and casually gaze at the wall clock.<br>
There is still some time to go before Navi is home.<br>
I should make her favorite food to reward her for her incredible diligence.<br>
On my way back home from buying groceries, I take a detour and arrive in front of the arcade.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
(Hang on, when did Akashi add an arcade to the town?)<br>
<br>
Driven by curiosity, I take a peek inside and immediately catch sight of a familiar school uniform.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
(Is that... Navi? Shouldn't she be studying at school?)<br>
<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项1：(Go inside and take a closer look.)</span>'''''<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项2：(Wait for her to leave.)</span>'''''<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>

<br>

'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项2）</span>'''''Through the glass window, I see that she's completely engrossed in her game.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项2）</span>'''''(This feels kind of like I'm spying on her... Forget it. I'll just go in.)<br>
<br>
Opening the door to the arcade, I'm greeted by a cacophony of bleeps and bloops and video game music.<br>
Navi is standing in front of a rhythm game cabinet, stepping on arrows in tune to the song. Pearls of sweat dangle off the edge of her hair.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Navi?<br>
<br>
Hearing her name called, she loses her cool and focus, turning around in a panic to face me.<br>
She is so surprised that she drops her can of soda.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Navi：</span><br>
Whuah?!<br>
{tb}?! What're you doing here?!<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
I just happened to pass by.<br>
Is this what you've really been doing when you said you've been "self-teaching"?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Navi：</span><br>
Uhh... I mean...<br>
<br>
She hangs her head and grips the rim of her skirt.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Navi：</span><br>
I already know all the stuff they're teaching me, and I wanted to have a little fun...<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
So why didn't you come straight home?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Navi：</span><br>
Because... Because you have work you need to do...<br>
<br>
Her voice shrinks smaller and smaller.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Navi：</span><br>
If I went home, you'd have to drop your work just to play with me, so...<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
(So that's what this is about.)<br>
It's okay, Navi.<br>
You don't have to worry about my work. Spending time with you isn't a chore or a waste of time to me.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Navi：</span><br>
It's not?<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
It's not. Honestly. What do you say we go home together? I'll cook up your favorite meal.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Navi：</span><br>
But... what about your work?<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Like I said, don't worry. No matter how busy I am, I'll always try to make time for us.<br>
<br>
Hearing this answer, she finally looks up to meet my gaze. Her confident smile is back.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Navi：</span><br>
Well... You better promise! You can't take it back and say, "Nuh-uh, no time" later!<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Alright. I promise.<br>
<br>
I take her hand and walk out of the arcade with her.<br>
The glow of the sunset casts a long shadow of her on the ground as we go home.<br>

<br>
Some time has passed since I bumped into Navi at the arcade.<br>
Although we promised to spend more time together, today it looks like she just wants to stay in her room.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
(She can't just sit in there forever...)<br>
(This is a good opportunity to take her somewhere.)<br>
Hey, Navi, the weather's great today. Do you wanna go for a swim?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Navi：</span><br>
What? Why a swim all of a sudden?<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
When you were playing that rhythm game at the arcade, I noticed your moves were a bit clumsy.<br>
If you want to sharpen your sense of balance and make yourself more flexible, swimming is the best way to do it.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Navi：</span><br>
Huh? Are you looking down on me?<br>
<br>
A sour expression. She defiantly places both hands on her hips.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Navi：</span><br>
Don't you give me unsolicited advice when you're just as out-of-shape! Also, gaming is a million times more fun than swimming!<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
I hear you. How about a swimming race, then?<br>
If you win, I'll play that rhythm game with you for a whole week. How does that sound?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Navi：</span><br>
Wooow, you talk big yet you're only putting one week on the line? Two weeks should be the minimum!<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Two weeks it is, then. You still have to beat me, though.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Navi：</span><br>
Pfft. That's gonna be easy. Hope you like the taste of defeat!<br>
<br>
And so, I brought Navi to the pool.<br>
Her swimming form is surprisingly good, and her moves were smooth. However, I had the physical advantage that secured me the victory.<br>
Navi gets out of the pool and immediately falls flat on her stomach, water dripping off her hair and swimsuit.<br>
Despite looking exhausted, she still has the energy to shoot me a proud look, grinning as though she is the real victor.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Navi：</span><br>
Okay, you got me... but does it matter? You're still going to the arcade with me anyway, right?<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Well... Yes.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Navi：</span><br>
Heheh! Of course. You're such a dweeb that I just knew you'd do it anyway!<br>
<br>
The smug look on her face screams, "Everything went just as I expected."<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Hmm. On second thought, I'm not doing it.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Navi：</span><br>
Huh?! No, wait! I'm sorry! I'm sorry for being so rude!<br>
<br>
Her facade of superiority crumbles in an instant, giving way to a look of remorse.<br>
Afterward, we got changed and headed to the arcade just as she'd hoped. There, we played many rounds together.<br>

Some time has passed since I bumped into Navi at the arcade.<br>
Although we promised to spend more time together, today it looks like she just wants to stay in her room.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
(She can't just sit in there forever...)<br>
(This is a good opportunity to take her somewhere.)<br>
Hey, Navi, the weather's nice, so how about we visit a farm?<br>
I saw an ad for it. They let you try things like wood-carving and weaving wreaths.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Navi：</span><br>
Really? Sounds fun!<br>
<br>
The glitter of excitement fills her eyes instantly.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Navi：</span><br>
Come on, let's go!<br>
<br>
Gentle sunlight shines into the farm's workshop, illuminating the workbench.<br>
Navi carves a block of wood clumsily but to the best of her ability.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Navi：</span><br>
Umm... {tb}...<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
What's up?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Navi：</span><br>
I want some ice cream.<br>
A store we walked by on the way here had a special offer. Can you buy it from there?<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
I could, but it's pretty far from here. It might melt on the way back.<br>
It'd be better if you came along and ate it on the spot.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Navi：</span><br>
But I don't wanna... I wanna be spoiled today!<br>
<br>
She blinks at me with eager eyes, smiling an irresistible, innocent smile.<br>
I can't bring myself to say no to her. I leave the workshop to go and buy some ice cream.<br>
When I return to the workshop, ice creams in hand, I see something beautiful.<br>
Navi is standing at the entrance to greet me, holding a gorgeously-crafted wreath.<br>
Dust particles hang in the air, turned golden by the sunlight, floating around her almost like fireflies.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Navi：</span><br>
Look...<br>
<br>
With some embarrassment, she presents the wreath.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Navi：</span><br>
I made this for you. As thanks for always taking such good care of me.<br>
I know it's not the best... but I wanted to show you how happy it makes me to spend time with you, {tb}.<br>
<br>
We eat the partially melted ice creams together, then finished carving the wood.<br>
Later, I took the wreath she made and put it inside a transparent case for safe-keeping.<br>

{{折叠面板|标题=Master of Balance|选项=15|主框=1|样式=primary|展开=是}}
<br>
Navi has gotten really into exercising as of late.<br>
Well, "exercising" might not be the right word. Specifically, she's become passionate about a kind of training that demands good balance and control of your body.<br>
Although she has never shown interest in lifting or aerobic exercises, she's very keen on exercise centered around the core and balance.<br>
She wanted to do more of it this evening, so she dragged me to the gym again.<br>
She sits on an exercise ball, feet in the air, trying to stay upright using only her torso.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Navi：</span><br>
{tb}! How long have I balanced for?<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
You're nearing one minute.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Navi：</span><br>
Heheh! I'll beat my record this time, just you watch!<br>
<br>
Brimming with confidence, she rocks back and forth slightly.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Careful so you don't fall, now.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Navi：</span><br>
Don't worry! I can– Whuah!<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Navi!<br>
<br>
With a small scream, she falls to the floor.<br>
I tried to catch her, but I was too slow.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Navi：</span><br>
Owch... That stings...<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Are you okay?<br>
<br>
I extend my hand to help her back on her feet, but she brushes it off.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Navi：</span><br>
I'm fine! Also, it's your fault for making me fall! I lost my concentration 'cause of you!<br>
Hmph! That one doesn't count! We're starting over, and this time, I'll set a new record for sure!<br>
<br>
We spent a whole hour in the gym trying over and over before finally leaving.<br>
On the way back home, Navi kept repeating that she will set another new record next time.<br>

<br>
While cleaning the house, I found a dusty box hidden away in a corner.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Navi：</span><br>
Wait... Isn't this that remote-controlled car you gave me?<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Yeah. I thought about throwing it away when it broke, but I guess I left it somewhere. Let's get rid of it.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Navi：</span><br>
But you gave me it as a gift... It feels wrong to just throw it away!<br>
Maybe I can fix it? I've been studying repairs at school!<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
They teach you how to do that?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Navi：</span><br>
Yeah. My teacher says it improves your thinking and problem-solving skills.<br>
Who knows – you might even come up with some crazy invention in the future!<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Honing your thinking and problem-solving skills, that's reasonable – but inventing something is setting your sights really high.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Navi：</span><br>
Let me try repairing it anyway. We have a workshop for stuff like this.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Alright. I'll bring you some drinks and snacks.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Navi：</span><br>
Yay! Thanks, {tb}!<br>
<br>
I come to the workshop with some snacks and drinks and see that Navi has already started on the repairs.<br>
Donning workwear and protective goggles, she stands in front of the table with a serious look on her face.<br>
There is an oil stain on her cheek. It looks like she's been tinkering with parts quite a lot.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Navi：</span><br>
Oh, welcome, {tb}!<br>
My teacher said you ought to put on breathable clothes when working like this.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Well, you sure look the part of a mechanic.<br>
Just be careful so you don't hurt yourself.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Navi：</span><br>
I'll be fine, don't worry!<br>
<br>
I left the refreshments on a table then sat down and watched her work.<br>
Her hard work paid off, and she got the toy back in working order.<br>
She gave it to me. I polished it up before giving it back to her. She put it safely inside her personal collection box.<br>

{{折叠面板|标题=Tennis Showdown|选项=17|主框=1|样式=primary|展开=是}}
<br>
It's another day where Navi has "forced" me to do sports with her.<br>
Although she is as discourteous as ever, she is clearly showing more consideration for me than she used to.<br>
We arrived at the tennis court and did some warm-up exercises, then started a game right off the bat.<br>
After a 30-minute-long back-and-forth, she was finally starting to pant for air.<br>
Her tennis clothes are soaked through, sticking to her skin.<br>
She grabs the rim of her top and uses it to wipe sweat from her brow.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Time for a break?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Navi：</span><br>
*pant*... *pant*... Why? You throwing in the towel already?<br>
It's sooo obvious you don't get nearly enough exercise!<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
So you say, but you're short of breath yourself.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Navi：</span><br>
Hmph! No, I'm just getting started!<br>
<br>
She flicks her sweaty hair and tries to look composed.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Navi：</span><br>
Breaktime is over! Get your head back in the game!<br>
<br>
Our sweat-inducing afternoon at the tennis court was over before we knew it.<br>
As the sun started to set, we packed our things and headed for home.<br>
Although she should've been exhausted after all this, she seemed strangely content. That made me feel like this wasn't a bad way to spend a day.<br>

<br>
Once I finally wrap up my work at the port for the day, it has already turned to night.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
(Whew... I hope Navi isn't staying up late to read novels again.)<br>
<br>
When I caught on to it, we had a long discussion and she promised not to do it anymore. Even so...<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
(I should check on her.)<br>
<br>
I put the device on and return to the virtual town. Before long, I notice the light faintly peeking through the crack in the door to her room.<br>
I give it two knocks. It looks like the door was left slightly open.<br>
Pushing against it gently, I slowly open the door.<br>
Navi is sitting at her desk in her pajamas, writing something in her big notebook.<br>
A few papers are scattered around her desk, filled with dense handwriting.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Navi：</span><br>
{tb}? I thought you weren't coming home tonight...<br>
Oh, uh, I'm not reading novels, I'm just...<br>
<br>
She hurriedly covers her notes with her hands, cheeks flushed.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Why are you up this late, and what are you writing?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Navi：</span><br>
I-it's... You know...<br>
<br>
While her hands obscure most of what's written in her notes, one of the scattered papers clearly clues me in as to what she's writing about.<br>
The neat handwriting describes her and my daily life, with cute little doodles accompanying the writing.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Navi：</span><br>
I'm keeping a diary... I-I won't stay up to write it again, I promise.<br>
<br>
She buries her head and makes a promise under her breath.<br>
Once she gathered her scattered papers, I watched to make sure she went to bed.<br>
I switched off her desk lamp and carefully closed the door to her room.<br>
Moonlight shone in through the window, painting the hallway a silvery blue. A calm and quiet night passed by.<br>

<br>
Before I knew it, it was getting to be time for Navi to transition to the next level of education.<br>
Seeing how she grew every day made me worry. Was I fulfilling my responsibility to guide her growth?<br>
On the last day of the semester, even after the school day had long ended, she'd yet to come home.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
(Is she at the arcade again?)<br>
<br>
When I go there, however, she's nowhere to be found.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
(I'd better go check at the school.)<br>
<br>
The afterglow of sunset illuminates the classroom.<br>
Navi bites the tip of her pen as she gazes out the window, lost in thought.<br>
The open page of her notebook has been scribbled over, but I can barely make out the words "future plans."<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
There you are.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Navi：</span><br>
Aah?! Wh-why are you here?!<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
It's late. You never came home, so I came looking for you.<br>
Are you having any problems?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Navi：</span><br>
No...?<br>
I'm just thinking about class. Stuff about our future, about our ideals...<br>
<br>
She unconsciously taps the table. Her voice gradually trails off.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Navi：</span><br>
I just don't know about any of it.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
You don't need to rush things. Go at your own pace.<br>
No matter what choices you make, I'm on your side.<br>
<br>
I gently pat her shoulder.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
It takes time to find your way. There's nothing wrong with being unsure now.<br>
I'll stay with you and watch over you while you figure things out.<br>
Navi, I know that you'll find your own answer someday.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Navi：</span><br>
...You mean it?<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Of course. I promise you.<br>
<br>
She smiles back at me.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Navi：</span><br>
Then we better go home and eat! I'm starving!<br>
<br>
Seeing her relieved and packing her bag, I can't help but smile.<br>
Whatever the future may hold, I'll be her guardian until she finds her way.<br>

<br>
After moving on to the next stage of her education, Navi quickly adapted to her new environment.<br>
Eventually, the day of the athletic meet came.<br>
Though she didn't say it, the fact that she always went to the track after school was proof that she was very serious about this competition.<br>
Naturally, her performance at the athletic meet was dazzling.<br>
She maintained the top position from the very beginning, and in the end, she'd crossed the finish line first by a large margin.<br>
She stands on the podium with one hand on her hip and the other proudly displaying her gold medal.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Navi：</span><br>
Did you see that, {tb}? This is proof of my skills!<br>
<br>
Her eyes sparkle with joy.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Congratulations.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Navi：</span><br>
I'm just getting started!<br>
Yeah, I'll never stop winning!<br>
<br>
My girl practically glows in the sunlight.<br>
That's the Navi I know and love.<br>

{{折叠面板|标题=The Drink Dispute|选项=22|主框=1|样式=primary|展开=是}}
<br>
Today, I got off work early to pick Navi up from school.<br>
Or so I say, but really, I'm just following her while she walks a bit ahead.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Navi：</span><br>
Hum hum hum♪<br>
<br>
As I watch the little girl, I get a little emotional – she's grown up so fast. So emotional, in fact, that I don't realize how much I've slowed down.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Navi：</span><br>
Heeey! {tb}!<br>
You're too slow! Aww, are you trying to get me to hold your hand like we used to when I was little?<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
...Huh?<br>
<br>
She yells again before I can speak up.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Navi：</span><br>
I'm all grown up now. I don't need my hand held just to go home anymore... You're too silly, {tb}.<br>
<br>
While I try to think of a response, she stops in front of a vending machine.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Navi：</span><br>
I'm thirsty. Let's get drinks!<br>
<br>
I watch vacantly while she picks a drink. Thoughts of work resurface.<br>
While I think, I suddenly hear her knocking on the glass impatiently.<br>
She takes a step back, and then...<br>
Right foot raised slightly, knee bent...<br>
Navi kicks the poor vending machine like it's a soccer ball.<br>
The motion lifts the skirt of her uniform slightly, revealing the skin above her white, thigh-high socks.<br>
BANG!<br>
The collision is immediately followed by a dry clunk – the sound of a can falling.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Navi：</span><br>
This thing sucks! It tried to steal my drink from me!<br>
Huh? Hey, {tb}, are you SCARED? You're too hopeless~<br>
<br>
She cocks her head for a moment and then grins madly at me like a smug little kid.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
......<br>
<br>
I sigh and check on the vending machine.<br>
While I'm relieved that it isn't broken, I turn to lecture her, but she's already walked off with a drink in hand.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Navi：</span><br>
Hurry up already! The sun's gonna set before we get back, you dweeb!<br>
<br>
She trots away cheerfully, and I'm forced to hold my tongue.<br>
I need to find a way to correct her willful nature.<br>
...I just hope I can.<br>

<br>
When I pass by a music shop one day, I notice a pretty sick guitar on display.<br>
Navi has always expressed interest in writing music, so I splurge on it and give it to her as a gift.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Navi：</span><br>
Huh? This is... for me?<br>
<br>
She timidly accepts the guitar. Her eyes are full of surprise and joy.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
An electric guitar might be hard for a beginner. Should we start with an acoustic instead?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Navi：</span><br>
Oh... Now that you mention it, maybe. But I'm fine! If I try hard, I know I can do it!<br>
<br>
After that, I'd often hear the sounds of guitar practice coming from her room.<br>
But when I asked her to show me what she's learned...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Navi：</span><br>
N-not yet! Let me practice a little more!<br>
<br>
She'd always get flustered and refuse.<br>
That is, until one day when I left work and came home early...<br>
The instant I opened the door, I heard a calm melody.<br>
Her soft singing voice accompanied the tones of the guitar.<br>
Navi sits in a computer chair in her room, wearing comfy clothes.<br>
She has a guitar and microphone set up, and recording software is running on her PC.<br>
When I open the door, she stops and looks up, surprised.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Navi：</span><br>
Oops. You got me...<br>
<br>
She blushes, but she doesn't try to evade the matter this time.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Navi：</span><br>
The truth is... I've been learning songwriting lately.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Songwriting? You're already that good?<br>
<br>
Navi nods shyly and just barely plucks the strings.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Navi：</span><br>
It's still really simple, but I wrote it for you.<br>
I wanted it to be a surprise. That's why I never told you...<br>
<br>
That afternoon, her melody and singing echoed in her room.<br>
It was the greatest gift of all – a heartfelt song just for one.<br>

<br>
To my surprise, Navi suddenly says that she's going to cook.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Navi：</span><br>
I'm in a good mood today, so I'll treat you to some of my home cooking!<br>
Heheh! I hope your heart is ready to be captured by my food! Well, ready or not, it will either way!<br>
<br>
It's good to see her take the initiative like this, so I nod in agreement.<br>
We head out and buy the necessary ingredients, then return home. As soon as we get back, she chases me out of the kitchen.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Navi：</span><br>
No peeking! Or else you'll regret it! Heheh!<br>
<br>
Left with no other choice, I retreat to the living room and kill time with a book. In the midst of my reading, however, an indescribable, sweet smell wafts in from the kitchen.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Uh-oh... Did something go wrong?<br>
<br>
The concern drives me to ignore her no-entry order and open the door to the kitchen.<br>
Navi is sitting leisurely atop the kitchen counter, holding a vial containing a suspicious, pink liquid.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Navi：</span><br>
Oh, already smelled it, huh?<br>
<br>
Pink bubbles rise from the pot. That looks to be the source of the strangely sweet smell.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
What the hell is that?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Navi：</span><br>
This? It's my secret ingredient!<br>
I made it with a special recipe my homeroom teacher taught me♪<br>
<br>
There is a dangerous smile on her face as she pours the last drop of the liquid into the pot.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Navi：</span><br>
You'll eat it all, won't you, {tb}?<br>
I made it just for you, so you better not let any go to waste♪<br>
<br>
That very moment, the contents of the pot suddenly solidify into some material the likes of which I've never seen before.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Navi：</span><br>
Aww, that sucks. I'd hoped to see your reaction when you tasted it!<br>
<br>
The disappointment in her expression brings me great relief.<br>
Using what's left of the daikon and the other ingredients, I throw together a vegetarian curry. I live to tell another tale.<br>

<br>
It's the afternoon on a weekend. I'm hauling bags of groceries back home.<br>
Besides the expected daily necessities, I've also bought that strawberry cake that Navi was craving.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
I'm back.<br>
<br>
Upon opening the door, I'm met with a heartwarming sight.<br>
Navi is in the living room, courteously folding the laundry.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Navi：</span><br>
Oh, welcome back, {tb}! Hope your work was fine.<br>
<br>
Looking at me with a lovely smile, she skillfully takes out one garment after the next from the laundry basket.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Navi：</span><br>
Give me a second. I'll help with the groceries after I'm done with this.<br>
<br>
Gently and swiftly, she smoothes out the wrinkles on the clothes with her fingers.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Navi：</span><br>
Alright, now for your bags.<br>
<br>
She moves the folded clothes aside and takes the grocery bags out of my hands.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Navi：</span><br>
Wait... Isn't this strawberry cake?<br>
<br>
Her eyes sparkle. She looks at me with joy.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Sure is. You said you wanted to taste it, so I got it.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Navi：</span><br>
I just said it without much thought, and you still remembered... Heheh.<br>
<br>
Suddenly, she stops lifting out groceries and joins her hands together in front of her chest.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Navi：</span><br>
I know it's sudden, but I want to say it: I live such a happy life.<br>
Making breakfast, waiting for you to wake up... Cleaning the place, doing the laundry...<br>
It just makes me so happy to live like this with you, {tb}.<br>
I hope things will stay like this forever and...<br>
<br>
Some realization seems to hit her as she interrupts herself. A light blush covers her face from ear to ear.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Navi：</span><br>
Err! Um... I mean...<br>
<br>
Flustered, she goes back to taking groceries out of the bag.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Navi：</span><br>
I'm paying you back for looking after me, that's all! Don't get any funny ideas.<br>
<br>
Her voice fades into a whisper.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Navi：</span><br>
It's not just you... We both care a lot about each other...<br>
<br>
There is a loving yet embarrassed smile on her face as she mutters those words.<br>
{{折叠面板|内容结束}}

<br>
The lights in the study are still on, despite how late it is.<br>
I knock on the closed door and speak to Navi through it.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Are you still up, Navi?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Navi：</span><br>
Huh? So what if I am? Seriously.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Ugh...<br>
<br>
Out of exasperation, I open the door and step inside.<br>
Inside, only the desktop lamp is lit, casting a warm light on Navi.<br>
She is sitting in front of the workbench, focused on some sort of blueprint.<br>
The individual components look roughly sketched out. Still, I can tell she is taking the task seriously.<br>
As for Navi herself, she holds a pen in one hand and looks rather unkempt.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Navi：</span><br>
I figured you'd come in anyway.<br>
Could you have a look at my design?<br>
...What am I saying? What insightful critique would a dweeb like you have? Forget it! Get out!<br>
<br>
Despite her aggressive posturing, it doesn't feel like she really wants to drive me out.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
You must've put a lot of work into drawing this... What is it?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Navi：</span><br>
Heh. Curious? Ask me really nicely and I might just tell you.<br>
<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项1：Pretty please with sugar on top.</span>'''''<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项2：(Turn around and leave.)</span>'''''<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Navi：</span><br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项1）</span>'''''Wooow, begging me now, huh? Not every day I hear a "please" from you.<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项1）</span>'''''You clearly didn't MEAN it, though. You'll have to be more sincere!<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项1）</span>'''''……<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Navi：</span><br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项1）</span>'''''Okay, fine. I'll tell you.<br>
<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项2）</span>'''''I shake my head, turn on my heel, and start leaving.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Navi：</span><br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项2）</span>'''''Hmph! Just gonna walk away, dweeb? What a coward!<br>
<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项2）</span>'''''I take two steps toward the door.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Navi：</span><br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项2）</span>'''''What, are you gonna ignore me now? Hey! Wait!<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项2）</span>'''''Come back here! Don't leave!<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
...What? The Sandwich Maker 3.0?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Navi：</span><br>
That's right! It's the perfect invention to replace a certain dweeb in my life!<br>
I don't remember asking you to get up early and make me breakfast with bags under your eyes. It's such an eyesore!<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
I don't see the point in an invention like this.<br>
I make breakfast for you every morning because I want to.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Navi：</span><br>
You don't see the point? You telling me my invention sucks? Wow, you have some nerve!<br>
If you wanna make breakfast for me that badly, I'll give you a chance to prove yourself.<br>
Make me a sandwich tomorrow. And be grateful for the opportunity.<br>
I want two slices of cheese, and make sure it's cut into four perfectly aligned pieces!<br>
If I don't deem it good enough, well... I've got goofy photos of you on the verge of dozing off, so!<br>
<br>
With a smug look, she cleans up at the desk and leaves with a cheery gait, shutting the door forcefully behind her.<br>
Just a second or two later, though, the door silently opens just a crack.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Navi：</span><br>
...Good night, dweeb.<br>
Be ready for the consequences if my morning sandwich tomorrow isn't up to snuff!<br>

<br>
Today is open day at Navi's school.<br>
We promised to have a look around together, and yet, she wasn't answering my calls.<br>
I searched all over the place and finally found her in the school's workshop.<br>
Navi stands in the distance, donning working clothes, engrossed in the engine in front of her.<br>
Her brow furrows a little while her eyes examine every individual component closely.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Navi：</span><br>
Hmm... How to connect these two...<br>
This will be tricky... I'll have to take a step back and remember what they taught us in class...<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Navi?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Navi：</span><br>
Let's see... What to do when I'm at an impasse...<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Navi, do you need a hand?<br>
<br>
After calling out to her twice, she finally notices that I'm here.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Navi：</span><br>
{tb}? Why are you– Oh, right! Sorry! You must've tried to call me. I got so caught up in this thing that I didn't notice!<br>
<br>
Realizing how many calls she has missed, she gives me an apologetic look.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
It's alright. Why are you repairing that thing, anyway? Want my help?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Navi：</span><br>
Thanks, but no. This is my handicrafts homework.<br>
I need to perform a full inspection of this vehicle.<br>
This is the most basic model, and it's still insanely hard...<br>
<br>
Wiping sweat off her forehead with her hand, she cracks an awkward smile.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Navi：</span><br>
Don't worry, I'll get it done.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Are you sure you don't need my help?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Navi：</span><br>
She shakes her head while her cheeks turn a light tinge of red.<br>
I'll manage. One way or another.<br>
Besides, I won't grow if I rely on your help forever. I wanna make you proud.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Well, that's a noble mindset...<br>
(Is vehicular maintenance really a necessary part of the curriculum, though?)<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Navi：</span><br>
Ah, I know what you're thinking.<br>
"This maintenance stuff is beyond your abilities," right?<br>
Me, I think all skills are good to have.<br>
One day, it might be useful to have someone like me who knows how machines are put together.<br>
<br>
She says this with a completely serious look. It's almost like she and her cute side belong to two different people.<br>
Her eyes glow with determination, like there's a faint yet unshakeable light inside of them.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Navi：</span><br>
Right – do you mind waiting here for a bit?<br>
I should be done in just a minute.<br>
Once I'm finished, what do you say we grab a bite in the cafeteria?<br>
Oh, uh... I'll have washed off this motor oil before then!<br>

{{折叠面板|标题=A Future With You 1|选项=28|主框=1|样式=primary|展开=是}}
<br>
It amazes me how fast time flies. It was already time for Navi to graduate.<br>
I attended her prom... and that was it. Afterward, our lives went on like normal with seemingly little change.<br>
Granted, that's because she said she needed time to really consider her future career.<br>
I respected her choice and gave her both ample time and space to work things out.<br>
Fast forward to today, and she brought me to a café to have a serious talk.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Navi：</span><br>
Uh, just so you know, there's no particular reason why I chose a café.<br>
I just figured talking at home wouldn't lend enough gravity to the conversation, y'know?<br>
Anyway, I've been thinking a lot. About who I want to be.<br>
Should I be someone amazing? Someone rational? Or someone who I can't find the words to describe yet?<br>
<br>
She stirs her cup of coffee while speaking, like she's sorting through her thoughts at the same time.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Navi：</span><br>
After a lot of thinking, I realized that there's really no point in worrying about it...<br>
I mean, no matter what I do, you'll always be there for me, ready to help, right?<br>
Basically, what I do or who I become is way less important than you simply being here to support me.<br>
Once that realization hit me, all my doubts went up in smoke.<br>
<br>
While saying that, she slides her chair back a bit.<br>
Jumping out of her seat, she suddenly produces a red paper bag.<br>
I can see her black dress fully now that she's standing up. It looks amazing on her.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Navi：</span><br>
This, um... This is for you!<br>
I saved up my allowance to buy it for you...<br>
<br>
Cheeks flushed, she presents the gift to me.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Navi：</span><br>
It's not much, but you have to accept it!<br>
I've worked hard to get this far, and I'm gonna keep at it!<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Thank you.<br>
<br>
The sun's grace shines upon us, preserving this warm moment forever.<br>

<br>
Following our exchange at the café, Navi gained a new perspective on her future career path.<br>
Even if the path forward isn't clear, she believes she will eventually find her way on her own.<br>
What journey will her choice take her on, and what places and things await her?<br>
{{折叠面板|内容结束}}

{{折叠面板|标题=New Grade|选项=31|主框=1|样式=primary|展开=是}}
<br>
After weighing her options, Navi decided to advance in grade.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Navi：</span><br>
I want to learn more things. A lot more things.<br>
I want to be as ready as I can be by absorbing heaps of knowledge!<br>
<br>
Sunlight shines through the massive windows, lighting up the bookcases of the library evenly.<br>
Navi kneels in front of one, flipping through the books on the bottom shelf with great interest.<br>
Even though there is already a pile of books she picked out next to her, she's still searching for more to add to it.<br>
I walk up to offer my assistance. She speaks before I get the first word in.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Navi：</span><br>
Oh, {tb}. You came?<br>
<br>
A look of slight annoyance rests on her face. Seems like she hasn't found a book that satisfies her yet.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
What kind of book are you looking for? Want my help?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Navi：</span><br>
I'm just looking for any kind of book that looks interesting...<br>
I want knowledge from various different fields of study, so I wanna start with something that catches my attention.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Reading a wide range of things is good. I'll help you find one.<br>
<br>
And so, the preparations for Navi's exams began.<br>
This insatiable thirst for knowledge will no doubt be a guidepost on her path to the future.<br>

{{折叠面板|标题=Pastry Chef|选项=32|主框=1|样式=primary|展开=是}}
<br>
After graduation, Navi opened a small café that mainly sold cakes and coffee.<br>
On the day it was completed, I was invited to the preopening.<br>
Soft sunlight shines through the window, adding warmth to the café's simple interior.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Navi：</span><br>
Umm... I got this dress just for today.<br>
{tb}... Do you like it?<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
It's cute. I think it suits you.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Navi：</span><br>
I'm happy you think so...<br>
<br>
Her cheeks flush as she digs a spoon into the strawberry parfait on the table.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Navi：</span><br>
This is a little embarrassing, but...<br>
Say "ah."<br>
<br>
A refreshing, sweet flavor blesses my tongue.<br>

{{折叠面板|标题=Bartender|选项=33|主框=1|样式=primary|展开=是}}
<br>
After graduation, Navi unexpectedly fell in love with cocktail mixing.<br>
She trained and gained experience quickly. Today, she continues to work as a skilled bartender.<br>
The lights of the bar are dim tonight, giving it a bit of a seedy vibe.<br>
Navi, dressed in a well-fitting and handsome uniform, sits casually on the counter.<br>
She places a full cocktail glass on top of an upside-down ice bucket.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Navi：</span><br>
I made the cocktail you wanted. Buuut...<br>
Just giving it to you wouldn't be all that fun, would it?<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
I thought the customer was always right.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Navi：</span><br>
Nuh-uh. I'm the bartender, so I make the rules.<br>
<br>
She swings her dangling legs and smirks at me deviously.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Navi：</span><br>
If you want it that badly, how about you beg?<br>
{{折叠面板|内容结束}}

{{折叠面板|标题=Nature Photographer|选项=34|主框=1|样式=primary|展开=是}}
<br>
Navi became fascinated with photography, honed her skills, and became a professional photographer.<br>
She always managed to capture nature in its most beautiful moments, as if she was innately able to communicate with the world.<br>
In a forest touched by morning dew, the sun shines through the lush leaves and casts shadowy patterns upon the ground.<br>
With camera in hand, Navi gazes lovingly at the birds flying above.<br>
Suddenly, a few birds become curious and land on her head and camera.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Aww. They like you.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Navi：</span><br>
Shush... Keep it down. You'll scare them off.<br>
<br>
Her words are directed at me, but her eyes stay firmly fixed on the birds flying about.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Navi：</span><br>
Quietly open your heart... and small animals will practically come to you.<br>
<br>
She gently adjusts the lens of her camera, being careful not to startle the critters.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Navi：</span><br>
The best way I can return the favor to them is by capturing them in their most natural form.<br>
<br>
With a murmur, Navi snaps a picture.<br>

{{折叠面板|标题=Demolitionist|选项=35|主框=1|样式=primary|展开=是}}
<br>
Navi took to demolition work in no time. The job was a perfect fit for her.<br>
With each highly precise blasting operation, her love for the thrilling work deepened ever more.<br>
Boom – down goes another abandoned building.<br>
Bright orange flames shoot into the sky, illuminating the surrounding wilderness.<br>
Navi walks over, her back to the explosion. There's a pep in her step and a big grin on her face.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Someone sure is having fun.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Navi：</span><br>
Haha♪ Even you could tell, dweeb?<br>
I'm the only one in the world who can make destruction this much of an art!<br>
What's wrong? So shocked by my genius that you can't even speak?<br>
<br>
The flames illuminate her from head to toe.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Navi：</span><br>
You could say this job was basically made for me! I love it!<br>

{{折叠面板|标题=Therapist|选项=36|主框=1|样式=primary|展开=是}}
<br>
Navi pursued the field of psychiatry and became an excellent therapist.<br>
However...<br>
I find myself in a bright, clean counseling office.<br>
Navi sits in an ergonomic chair with her legs crossed and documents in hand.<br>
Tapping a pen on her chin, she looks down at me as if appraising me.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Is this really necessary?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Navi：</span><br>
Heheh, but of course. Your mind is a marvel worthy of study.<br>
And this is a good opportunity to put what I've learned to the test.<br>
Let's see... Oh, interesting. Based on your survey responses, I've already figured out your problem.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Um... I didn't fill out a survey?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Navi：</span><br>
Ahem. I didn't need your input, or really even the survey at all. I know you so well, after all.<br>
Relax~ I promise you, I'll get that heart fixed up better than ever♪<br>

{{折叠面板|标题=Cybersecurity Specialist|选项=37|主框=1|样式=primary|展开=是}}
<br>
Navi ended up choosing a career in cybersecurity.<br>
But she kept an eye on more than just security threats.<br>
At night, the security room is lit up only by the blue light of several monitors.<br>
Sophisticated monitoring equipment, from auditory to visual, lines the room. Navi is huddled in a chair and staring at a screen.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Navi：</span><br>
Geez, {tb}, you could just leave my midnight snack on the table.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
You're still at it this late... Wait.<br>
<br>
Midway through my sentence, I realize something is wrong.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
How did you know I was coming? And that I had your midnight snacks?<br>
<br>
She grins slyly at me, holding up her headphones with one hand.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Navi：</span><br>
Good question~ Gee, I wonder. Do you really wanna know?<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Wait... You're not spying on me, too, are you?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Navi：</span><br>
SPYING on you? Never. I'm just protecting you!<br>
Heheh, be a little grateful♪<br>

<br>
Following graduation, Navi became a camping instructor.<br>
She found her place amongst the trees and the mountains.<br>
The sun's rays shine down on a lake in a mountain range.<br>
She has finished setting up camp. Passing winds gently shake the tent cloth.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Navi：</span><br>
Alrighty, now I'm gonna teach you how to cook outdoors.<br>
<br>
She looks at me with a warm smile from her foldable chair.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
You really know your stuff, huh?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Navi：</span><br>
Of course I do. This is my job!<br>
Heheh, so anyway, are you ready to learn?<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Absolutely. Show me how it's done.<br>
<br>
The high-altitude winds caress the camping ground and create ripples on the lake's surface.<br>
This truly is a perfect day for camping.<br>

{{折叠面板|标题=Motorcyclist|选项=39|主框=1|样式=primary|展开=是}}
<br>
After she graduated, Navi pursued her interest in motorcycles, taking lessons and getting a license.<br>
Ever since then, she has been hooked on the thrill of the wind rushing past her.<br>
Sunlight glimmers off of the crystal clear surface of the cerulean sea.<br>
A flock of seagulls circles around in the air, occasionally crying out in beautiful notes.<br>
Navi leans against her motorcycle. Her black protective suit makes the contours of her supple body all the more evident.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Navi：</span><br>
How do I look, {tb}?<br>
<br>
With a slightly devilish grin on her face, she shoots a proud look at me.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Navi：</span><br>
Want me to take you for a ride?<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
A ride? Sounds like you just want to show off your new machine.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Navi：</span><br>
Dang, you got me!<br>
Still, I DO want to feel the wind with you. Don't you wanna ride with me?<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Of course I do.<br>
<br>
The briny breeze sweeps across the coastline, caressing my cheeks.<br>
The engine fires up with a roar, and the motorcycle takes off like a tiger, leading us to the horizon.<br>

{{折叠面板|标题=Veterinarian|选项=40|主框=1|样式=primary|展开=是}}
<br>
Navi's love for animals led her to become a veterinarian.<br>
Today, after having breakfast, she took me to the park to perform a routine examination on the wild animals there.<br>
She sits on a bench, lovingly yet quickly inspecting the animals around her.<br>
Holding a cuddly orange tabby in her lap, she gently puts a stethoscope to its chest.<br>
The cat is docile, lying there relaxed and letting her perform the examination without any fuss.<br>
A second orange tabby is huddled up next to her, sleeping soundly, while a tuxedo cat watches her work with marked curiosity.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Navi：</span><br>
There, who's a good girl? I'll be done in just a moment!<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Look – you've got more polite customers waiting for you.<br>
<br>
Another pair of cats lingers across from the bench, silently observing Navi.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Navi：</span><br>
That's because they know I'm a nice lady who's come to help them.<br>
These kitties are very clever. They know when someone is really trying to help them.<br>
<br>
As she says that, she smiles warmly.<br>

Navi continued on the path of music and has now grown into a powerhouse of a singer and songwriter.<br>
She is hosting a concert today. I'm standing in the audience, watching her on the stage. She looks so familiar, yet so different.<br>
She rocks on her electric guitar and sings into her microphone.<br>
To her back, an enormous screen, displaying a closeup of her.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Navi：</span><br>
This next song, I made for the most important person in my life!<br>
<br>
Her usual reserved, shy self is gone in this moment. The power of music lets her shine like the brightest stars.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Navi：</span><br>
Thank you for giving me courage and the ability to express myself!<br>
{tb}, this one's for you!<br>

As she speaks, she plays a powerful prelude on her guitar.<br>
She gives off such a dazzling aura that it's impossible to take your eyes off her.<br>

<br>
Up on the starry stage, Navi delivers a passionate performance to me.<br>
Her white-and-blue costume glitters under the spotlight, elevating every move of her impassioned dance.<br>
As the song's final note rings out, she takes to the middle of the stage and holds a pose.<br>
She looks at me, some sort of spark of resolve burning in her eyes.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Navi：</span><br>
Umm...<br>
By the magic of music and love, I bid your heart to beat for me!<br>
Give me your support from here on out!<br>
<br>
Although a hint of shyness peeks through, she still tries her best to make a heart shape using her fingers.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Of course! I'll stick with you no matter what happens!<br>

After graduating, Navi embarked on the path of becoming a nurse.<br>
Today is a day like any other, and I'm heading to the hospital to pick her up.<br>
The curtains close, completely sealing off this corner of the hospital room from the rest of the world.<br>
Navi, donning a pure white uniform, gazes down at me on top of the bed.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Navi：</span><br>
Heheh! Just give up and let me practice giving you a shot, {tb}!<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Whoa, hang on, why are we doing this?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Navi：</span><br>
Why? Didn't you say you'd always help me at work? You thinking of backing out now?<br>
<br>
She wags the syringe around and a drop of liquid oozes out of the needle.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Sure, I said I'd help, but this is different...<br>
I'm not even sick. What's in that syringe, anyway?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Navi：</span><br>
Just a bit of nutritional supplement I made just for you. It's good for your health!<br>
If you bail out now, you're getting a shot every day from now on.<br>
<br>
She holds my chin with her free hand, threatening me in a sweet voice.<br>

I've come to the safari park, where the young zoo director is passionately performing her job.<br>
Navi sits down in a corner of the observation area, tablet in hand, logging a status entry about the pride of lions resting by the rocks.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Hey, Navi. How's your progress?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Navi：</span><br>
Oh, {tb}! You came.<br>
I just got done writing about their resting states. It's gotten pretty hot lately, and that seems to have affected their resting schedules.<br>
<br>
She lifts her head and winks at me.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
How about you get some rest, too? There's a comfy spot nearby where you can continue your observations.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Navi：</span><br>
No, I'm good. This spot is more convenient. Besides...<br>
I'd never feel tired when you're around.<br>

She flashes a modest smile, the lions listlessly wagging their tails in the background.<br>

Guided by an interest fostered by her handicrafts classes, Navi immediately jumped into the world of machine maintenance after graduating.<br>
Inside her equipment storage filled with all kinds of mechanical parts, she sits at her workbench.<br>
She holds a blueprint in each hand, her gaze switching between the two, trying to figure out which is the most optimal solution.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Every time I come to check, you're always here.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Navi：</span><br>
Hm? Oh, {tb}.<br>

Her voice comes through muffled on account of the wrench she's holding with her mouth.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Navi：</span><br>
What brings you here? Just wanted to say hello?<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Kind of. I wanted to see how you were doing.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Navi：</span><br>
Oh you. Alright, sit down somewhere over there. Don't get in the way of my work.<br>
I guess since you're here, I've got to look my best and get some real work done.<br>
Just don't come crying if I take a while, alright? You'll make me feel guilty.<br>
