Crimson Prelusion<br>
<br>
1 Dream - In Memory of the Battle<br>
Warning sirens were blaring in the air around Scapa Flow.<br>
And yet, nobody there was gearing up for battle. On the contrary, many took off their hats as a gesture of respect.<br>
This was no battle – it was a ceremony to commemorate a battle.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">King George V：</span><br>
Thank you all for your thoughts and prayers.<br>
We have gathered here again this year to pay our respects to our comrades who fell in the defence of Scapa Flow.<br>
Though the battle has long since passed, the courage our soldiers showed here continues to inspire us.<br>
The vessels we lost, too, still rest at the bottom of the sea, silently recounting what happened.<br>
On that day, the Royal Navy, Iron Blood, and Sakura Empire all united against the Sirens, pushing them back and defending our great motherland.<br>
We defeated Compiler, proving that humanity will endure. These ruins you see are the final thing she did.<br>
It is not only the remains of a battle, it is also proof of our bonds.<br>
I truly hope that this friendship of ours will last forever.<br>
<br>
The stirring speed continued from the ceremonial podium.<br>
Scapa Flow - Tourist Area<br>
Hotel<br>
Sometime later<br>
The tourist area at Scapa Flow is home to a massive, regal hotel. There, a party is held after the remembrance ceremony each year.<br>
Legend has it that the heroes of all three factions held their own celebration here after the battle was over.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Lützow：</span><br>
*yaaawn*... I'm beat. This has been a long day.<br>
I'm gonna stuff my face and recharge my batteries, then fall asleep in half a second of lying in bed.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Amagi：</span><br>
Heehee. You really know how to let loose after a hard day's work, I see.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Lützow：</span><br>
Yep. Relaxing is my middle name.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">King George V：</span><br>
I'd like to thank you both for coming all this way.<br>
Especially you, Amagi. On behalf of the entire Royal Navy, thank you for attending this ceremony every year.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Amagi：</span><br>
You needn't thank me. It shames me to admit this, but part of the reason I come is so I can have a break from my work at home.<br>
Of course, reuniting with old friends is always the main draw, though.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Warspite：</span><br>
Same for me. Let's have a toast! To our old friends!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Amagi & Lützow：</span><br>
To our old friends.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">King George V：</span><br>
The tides of war are turning in our favour. We are presently preparing a major counterattack and would much appreciate your aid in executing it.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Lützow：</span><br>
You can count on us. Before we set off, Friedrich told us to agree to help if you brought up any talks of a counterattack.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Amagi：</span><br>
The Sakura Empire will assist you as well. Allow me to raise a toast next. To our friendship.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Warspite & King George V & Lützow：</span><br>
To our friendship!<br>
<br>
Royal Islands - Location Unknown<br>
Royal Navy Gate<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Communicator：</span><br>
BEEP BEEP!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Monarch：</span><br>
Bugger. I knew it wouldn't be so easy to contact the outside.<br>
Vanguard, any luck?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Vanguard：</span><br>
Afraid not. "Could not construct passageway: failed to locate exit coordinates." I've restarted over and over, and it's the same thing every time.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Vampire：</span><br>
We can't reach the outside and we can't escape. We're bloody stuck in Camelot!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Glasgow：</span><br>
They SHOULD send a rescue fleet once they realise they've lost contact with us.<br>
<span style="color:#ffc960;">Hunter META：</span><br>
I, for one, don't fancy twiddling my thumbs until rescue arrives.<br>
The teleporter can't find exit coordinates, even though nothing's changed on the inside. That means the problem is external.<br>
Maybe they're in the same boat as us, unable to use the gate from their end.<br>
In the worst case... we may have become unobservable to them.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Glasgow：</span><br>
But then... aren't we proper screwed?!<br>
<span style="color:#ffc960;">Hunter META：</span><br>
I'm only speculating. It's not like I know how this thing works.<br>
All I'm saying is it's POSSIBLE.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Vanguard：</span><br>
Her Majesty knows the gate better than anyone... but she's in Europa at the moment, and we obviously can't reach her.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Vampire：</span><br>
What about Her META Majesty?<br>
<span style="color:#ffc960;">Vampire META：</span><br>
Not an option. She hath boarded the Queen's Light and traveled to god knoweth what place where she cannot be reached. As she so often doeth.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Glasgow：</span><br>
Then what are we supposed to do?<br>
<span style="color:#ffc960;">Renown META ：</span><br>
I may have an idea.<br>
If trouble has sprung up outside test site beta, we could take Camelot to a place just a bit further away. Then we may figure out what's going on.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Vanguard：</span><br>
Her Majesty explicitly ordered us not to use the gate without her permission, though.<br>
<span style="color:#ffc960;">Hunter META：</span><br>
And how are we supposed to GET her bloody permission in the first place, huh?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Vanguard：</span><br>
I see your point, but still...<br>
<span style="color:#ffc960;">Vampire META：</span><br>
We were endowed with brains for times like these. Go on, let's hear some alternative ideas.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Vanguard：</span><br>
Well... Her Majesty DID say I had permission to use the gate one single time in the event of an emergency, but...<br>
<span style="color:#ffc960;">Vampire META：</span><br>
Mean thou to say this is NOT an emergency?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Vanguard：</span><br>
You're right. It is. There's no other way!<br>
Then input a set of coordinates and I'll activate the gate at once.<br>
<span style="color:#ffc960;">Vampire META：</span><br>
Umm...<br>
<span style="color:#ffc960;">Hunter META：</span><br>
Err...<br>
<span style="color:#ffc960;">Renown META ：</span><br>
Well...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Vanguard：</span><br>
For the love of... Do none of you know how to input coordinates?<br>
<span style="color:#ffc960;">Hunter META：</span><br>
Fighting and hunting are my fortes, not operating teleporters.<br>
<span style="color:#ffc960;">Vampire META：</span><br>
I've been far too preoccupied setting up defences in the Rose Block to learn such things.<br>
What about you, Repulse and Renown? Ye came here before the rest of us.<br>
<span style="color:#ffc960;">Repulse META ：</span><br>
Do we LOOK like we know how that thing works? Coming first doesn't automatically make us experts.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Vanguard：</span><br>
Ugh. Great... Then Her Majesty is likely the only one who knows how.<br>
Having her permission means nothing if we can't use the damn thing.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Monarch：</span><br>
I'll do it.<br>
I've fed it coordinates once before and I know more or less how the machine works.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Vanguard：</span><br>
Only because you were so reckless back then...<br>
Still, it's not that simple. All the coordinates that were stored on it have been erased.<br>
<span style="color:#ffc960;">Renown META ：</span><br>
It seems we've no other choice. We must punch a hole through the outer barrier.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Vanguard：</span><br>
No, no, NO! Don't even think about it, Renown!<br>
<span style="color:#ffc960;">Renown META ：</span><br>
Hmph. Very well.<br>
<span style="color:#ffc960;">Vampire META：</span><br>
Simply waiting doth seem our best option. Either Our Majesty wilt come, or yours wilt send a rescue fleet.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Vanguard：</span><br>
Our best and ONLY option. Ugh... Return to your posts and resume your work.<br>

Crimson Prelusion<br>
<br>
2 Dream - Let the Past Be the Past<br>
Dark clouds. A song of black steel played across the sea while a relentless pursuit unfolded.<br>
<span style="color:#ff9b93;">Renown：</span><br>
I am Renown, battlecruiser of the Royal Navy's Force H! I am here because of your ambush on our ships! Cease your meaningless resistance at once!<br>
The Royal Family's most capable ships are heading this way en masse! I will not let you flee!<br>
<span style="color:#ff9b93;">Ark Royal：</span><br>
She's... not resisting as I figured she would.<br>
No matter. She's not getting away on my watch!<br>
Let's do precisely what King George V said and slow her down!<br>
Swordfishes, launch! Capture Bismarck!<br>
<br>
KABOOOM!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Bismarck：</span><br>
Torpedoes... from my blind spot...?!<br>
I won't... be able to avoid them in time...!<br>
<br>
KABOOOM!<br>
<span style="color:#ff9b93;">King George V：</span><br>
This is the end, Bismarck.<br>
By the decree of the Queen, you are to lay down your arms and come with us. You shall have a fair trial in our courts.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Bismarck：</span><br>
I lost power to my engines, and the operation was a failure... It was over.<br>
<span style="color:#ff9b93;">Tester：</span><br>
Miss Bismarck... You almost lost your life, and yet you still refuse to use "that?"<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Bismarck：</span><br>
I don't need help from the likes of you...<br>
<span style="color:#ff9b93;">Tester：</span><br>
Still acting tough even in this condition? You could have sent your enemies to the bottom of the sea so easily. All you needed was a little bit of... determination.<br>
<br>
KABOOOM!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Friedrich der Große：</span><br>
Such terrible dissonance.<br>
Bismarck has already made her will clear, Siren. You are not part of this orchestra.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Amagi：</span><br>
I'm sorry I took so long, Bismarck. Are you alright?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Bismarck：</span><br>
Friedrich... You – who are you?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Amagi：</span><br>
I am Amagi. Do you remember me?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Bismarck：</span><br>
You're Akagi's older sister, if I remember right.<br>
What's that fleet over there? Why is it so black?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Amagi：</span><br>
That's my support fleet. Reinforcements from your side are here, too. The Royal Navy won't dare come any closer.<br>
You're safe now. You're going to be alright.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Bismarck：</span><br>
I'm... safe...?<br>
<br>
Bismarck could hardly believe her ears. She paused to let the word sink in.<br>
<span style="color:#ff9b93;">Tester：</span><br>
With the arrival of those unforeseen variables, the predicted test results have changed. Seems you have the option to choose a new path.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Bismarck：</span><br>
A new path...<br>
<br>
Bismarck gazed at Tester, then at Amagi, then at Friedrich, then finally at the Black Cube resting atop her rigging.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Bismarck：</span><br>
Heheheh...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Amagi：</span><br>
What's so funny?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Bismarck：</span><br>
Was this your plan? To change fate by bringing reinforcements to save me?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Friedrich der Große：</span><br>
Perhaps. What do you think?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Bismarck：</span><br>
No. This is wrong.<br>
This is not what we agreed would happen here.<br>
You're supposed to be back at the base. When news of my "sinking" reaches you, you'll initiate a purge of our higher command and lead Iron Blood in my stead.<br>
Which means that this isn't reality. Am I correct?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Friedrich der Große：</span><br>
Heehee...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Amagi：</span><br>
What are you talking about?<br>
Of course this is reality. Not only that, it's better than it once was.<br>
Shouldn't we let reality continue as it is?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Bismarck：</span><br>
Reality isn't all sunshine and butterflies. There will be regrets, goodbyes, and mistakes along the path that is life.<br>
There can be no future without the real past.<br>
And you cannot undo what has been done.<br>
It doesn't matter how frustrating or saddening the past is, or how much you want to change it...<br>
We must accept reality for what it is. By accepting it, we can move on to the future.<br>
<br>
She began to charge up her main cannons as she used the terrifying power in her hands.<br>
The strange black light gathered in her barrel, eventually shrinking down to a single dot.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Amagi：</span><br>
Please don't, Bismarck! What do you think you're trying to accomplish?!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Bismarck：</span><br>
I'm doing what must be done.<br>
Just as I did in the past. Tester! I will use this power to turn your fleet to dust!<br>
I accept my fate – my end – for what it is!<br>
<br>
Power burst forth from the tiny dot, engulfing not just Tester and Bismarck herself, but the puzzled Amagi and smiling Friedrich as well.<br>
<span style="color:#ffc960;">Geryon：</span><br>
ROOOAAAR!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Bismarck Zwei：</span><br>
This... This is reality.<br>
Do you see? Only by accepting the past can you move on to the future.<br>
Toward a brighter, better future.<br>

<br>
3 Reality - In the Holy Capital<br>
On a major street in the Orthodoxy's holy capital...<br>
Sakuran shipgirls were wading through the crowds toward their destination.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Hakuryuu：</span><br>
Out of my way! Let me through!<br>
MOVE, dammit!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Suruga：</span><br>
We've opened up a path. Let's hurry, Lady Shinano!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Shimakaze：</span><br>
Phew... Finally, we made it to an at least somewhat open space.<br>
It's staggering how crowded it is. Do you think there's some festival happening?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Shinano ：</span><br>
This one has not heard of any such thing taking place today...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Hakuryuu：</span><br>
Maybe it's a spur-of-the-moment thing. Don't need an excuse to have fun!<br>
Like a few days back, when we all got together on a whim to watch the moon!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Noshiro：</span><br>
Well, that never actually–<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Shinano ：</span><br>
Ahem. Let us chat elsewhere. Hakuryuu, continue leading the way. Before all else, we must get back to our lodgings...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Hakuryuu：</span><br>
Yeah, yeah! Will do!<br>
<br>
After passing another intersection, the Sakurans came across a group of young Orthodoxy girls.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Le Triomphant：</span><br>
Please move forward in an orderly fashion! Let us celebrate our victory in this war of resistance together!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Le Malin：</span><br>
May the Orthodoxy, Royal Navy, and Sakura Empire remain allies forever!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Hakuryuu：</span><br>
"War of resistance"? What the hell is she talking about?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Suruga：</span><br>
The three of us, allies forever? That's news to me.<br>
Something is weird with these girls.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Shimakaze：</span><br>
Exactly! They're weirder than a toad in a kimono!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Noshiro：</span><br>
Lady Shinano... I think they've been put under the dream spell, too.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Shinano ：</span><br>
Aye... It's little surprise that the holy capital has been affected...<br>
However, this one never could've anticipated the effect was this vast in scale...<br>
But, as fortune would have it, this one has business with the knights... Let us go speak to them.<br>
Greetings, knights of the Holy Iris... Where is Clemenceau?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Le Triomphant：</span><br>
Ah, Sakurans! Welcome to our parade! Come celebrate with us!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Shinano ：</span><br>
(They're ignoring me... I should show it to them.)<br>
Have a look at this.<br>
<br>
She showed them the brooch the Commander gave to her.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Shinano ：</span><br>
Please, young knights... This one would like a meeting with Clemenceau.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Le Malin：</span><br>
Do you want to go to the main venue? Shall we escort you there?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Shinano ：</span><br>
(My words aren't reaching them... So be it, then.)<br>
Thank you, but no. That shan't be necessary.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Le Triomphant：</span><br>
Very well. Please be sure to have a look around! There's so much to see!<br>
<br>
As the sun began to set, the Sakurans finally made it back to their lodgings.<br>
Despite doing everything she could, Shinano was unable to arrange a meeting with Clemenceau.<br>
Resigned, she sat in her room, deep in thought about how the dream had affected her comrades from the Orthodoxy.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Shinano ：</span><br>
Ah, like a small boat caught in a great storm, I can do naught but lament my own helplessness...<br>
How much more must I experience this feeling of futility?<br>
In dreams of yore, there was always the hope that all would change once I woke again...<br>
Alas, prayers cannot change the reality of the waking world...<br>
Now, I am equally at the whims of both the real world and the dream world, allowed not even a moment of reprieve...<br>
How could one who only knows how to drift possibly fight the waves?<br>
Neither is there a way out, nor will anyone come to my aid...<br>
Only one person can resolve this crisis... 'tis I and I alone...<br>
I can flee from my problems no longer...<br>
<br>
Shinano closed her eyes and tightly clutched the Watatsumi amulet in her hands. Hearing her prayer, it began to glow faintly.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Shinano ：</span><br>
I've always known the essence of my power, the root of my dreams...<br>
It is this fragment... The Watatsumi gives me my strength, my dreams...<br>
And yet, I have always turned a blind eye to the truth...<br>
That without this fragment, I am a hollow person with no power despite the Yamato-class hull I possess...<br>
It is time I accepted reality for what it is...<br>
Then... I shall do what I can...<br>
<br>
When she opened her eyes, the light from the amulet had faded, like the moon's reflection upon a lake.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Shinano ：</span><br>
The Watatsumi is a sacred relic, but it can also be a weapon...<br>
Soldiers rely upon their firearms, and ships rely upon their riggings... whilst my everything hinges upon this fragment...<br>
With this amulet, you helped me see reality when I would not accept it...<br>
This amulet of my own creation cast light upon the dream that has bewitched so many... It made me realize that the waking world was asleep...<br>
Thus far it has guided me, and no doubt it will continue to...<br>
It is my connection to the dreamscape as well as my guiding light to it...<br>
If my words mean nothing in the real world, then perhaps they have weight in the dream world...<br>
I shall dispel the illusion placed upon the holy capital and accomplish my mission.<br>
<br>
Steeling her resolve, she again clenched the amulet between her hands.<br>
Then, there was a sudden knocking on the door.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Clemenceau：</span><br>
It's Clemenceau. I heard you've been running across the city trying to find me.<br>
What can I do for you?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Shinano ：</span><br>
Clemenceau?!<br>
<br>
Shocked, Shinano was quick to open the door and let Clemenceau in.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Shinano ：</span><br>
Have you... awoken from the illusion?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Clemenceau：</span><br>
Yes, as you can see.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Shinano ：</span><br>
How?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Clemenceau：</span><br>
Simple. Things seemed too perfect even for a dream.<br>
As sad as it is, I know the past, present, and future alike can never be that pretty.<br>
So, I accepted a sacrifice and made the right choice again. That is all.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Shinano ：</span><br>
Seeing as you were fooled, too, you must know well how powerful this illusion is. A layman cannot correctly identify a perfect dream for what it is.<br>
Furthermore... it seems the Commander made two misjudgments...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Clemenceau：</span><br>
Misjudgments? Go on.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Shinano ：</span><br>
The first – this one showed your comrades this brooch, yet they wouldn't let me see you.<br>
<br>
Shinano took out the brooch and showed it to Clemenceau.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Shinano ：</span><br>
The second – the assumption that few Europans would snap out of the illusion by themselves.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Clemenceau：</span><br>
We all make mistakes sometimes, even the Commander.<br>
Also, that brooch was a gift. I'm a bit peeved to hear it was given to someone else.<br>
I'd wager it being in your hands is the reason it didn't work.<br>
Regardless, now we've come face to face. Would you mind giving it back to me?<br>
<br>
With a nod, Shinano handed over the brooch to Clemenceau.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Clemenceau：</span><br>
Now, I've already launched an investigation into this strange phenomenon.<br>
The Commander was wise to send you here. I'm going to need your power, and we want as many awoken people on our side as possible.<br>
Speaking of your power, I'd like to put it to use as soon as possible.<br>
You're able to enter other people's dreams, yes? I have a particular one in mind...<br>

<br>
4 Dream - Vainglorious<br>
Somewhere in the Sardegna Empire, two shipgirls were walking through a garden, admiring all the flowers.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Vittorio Veneto：</span><br>
I certainly wasn't expecting you to lead the delegation here in person.<br>
With you here, I'm sure your pavilion will attract the whole World Expo's attention.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Amagi：</span><br>
Why, I'd never. It would be rude of me to steal the spotlight from the hosts.<br>
However, I am eager and excited to create the SECOND most eye-catching pavilion.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Vittorio Veneto：</span><br>
Heehee. Don't create too stiff competition for us, please.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Amagi：</span><br>
Of course not. I won't overdo it.<br>
By the way, I'd like to ask you for a personal favor. May I ask you to hear me out?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Vittorio Veneto：</span><br>
A personal favor, you say? Would you like a tour guide? Or perhaps a seat at a restaurant?<br>
I can do almost anything you'd like, so let's hear it.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Amagi：</span><br>
Well... there's someone I'd like to meet.<br>
You, the Sardegnians, volunteering as hosts for the World Expo was a move of divine brilliance.<br>
Whoever came forth with the suggestion to you must be a person of great ambition and vision.<br>
For that reason, I'd like to talk to them. Could you make that happen?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Vittorio Veneto：</span><br>
Ah, you must mean Marco Polo.<br>
(Now that she mentions it, Marco hasn't even gotten the chance to appear at the World Expo, even though she's the architect of it.)<br>
(I feel a bit sad for her. She deserves some time in the limelight.)<br>
I believe she's in our capital right now. I'll arrange a meeting between you two.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Amagi：</span><br>
Thank you so much. I can't wait to speak to her.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">???：</span><br>
Hmph! I, on the other hand, couldn't care less about you!<br>
<br>
The sky burst with a dazzling light, and a throne adorned with white wings revealed itself.<br>
All the land beneath the throne vanished in an instant, being replaced by a whiteness that spanned from horizon to horizon.<br>
The throne slowly descended from the sky, and its pilot came into view.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Marco Polo：</span><br>
I was perfectly content to fill my days with drawing up plans at the time! I don't need your pity, Veneto!<br>
As for YOU... Who are you?<br>
Vile creatures like you have no place in my glorious empire!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">▇▇▇▇▇：</span><br>
Mar▇o, wh▇t ▇▇▇ you ▇▇▇▇▇▇▇ ▇bout?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Marco Polo：</span><br>
Hah! You can hardly even talk.<br>
Vanish from my sight!<br>
<br>
Struck with holy light, the doppelganger of Amagi was reduced to black mist before vanishing altogether.<br>
The next moment, a set of torii gates appeared in the dreamscape, from out of which Shinano leaped forth.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Shinano ：</span><br>
Marco Polo, you must think carefully before you act in this dream world!<br>
In these circumstances, haphazard movement is very dangerous...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Vittorio Veneto：</span><br>
Marco... Polo? Shinano, too?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Shinano ：</span><br>
Veneto? Apologies for intruding upon your dream, albeit unwillingly... Have you awoken from the illusion?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Vittorio Veneto：</span><br>
I suppose I have... What's going on now?<br>
I thought Marco Polo was still in a comatose state! What is she doing here? Why are you here, for that matter?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Marco Polo：</span><br>
Use your eyes, woman! I've gained a new source of power and effortlessly crushed this illusion with it!<br>
Next, I will realize the next step of my plan! I only just came up with it, but no matter!<br>
You, Shinano – it was you who awoke me, no?<br>
Then I have a trustworthy ally! Magnificent! I guarantee you will get your share of the pie later!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Shinano ：</span><br>
It was this one who awoke you, yes – however, you are still dreaming, and the power you feel is but my own...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Marco Polo：</span><br>
"Still dreaming"? So what I see here is not reality, even though I'm awake?<br>
Hmm. You did say something about a "dream world" a minute ago...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Shinano ：</span><br>
Your mind is still in the dreamscape... All this one did was pull you here...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Marco Polo：</span><br>
Bah. No wonder I "awoke" to such a dreadful sight. I thought someone had already stolen my sweet Sardegna from me.<br>
Thank goodness it's just a dream... No, wait, that's not good at all!<br>
If I've already awoken, as you claim, then how do I wake up in the REAL world?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Shinano ：</span><br>
Alas... I do not know...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Marco Polo：</span><br>
So I'm trapped, then?!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Shinano ：</span><br>
My power will not hold for long... I awoke you so I could ask you questions on behalf of Clemenceau...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Marco Polo：</span><br>
Clemenceau, you say? Hah! I won't tell her a damn thing!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Shinano ：</span><br>
You must... This one shan't leave empty-handed...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Marco Polo：</span><br>
......<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Shinano ：</span><br>
......<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Marco Polo：</span><br>
Well? Are you going to stare all day or ask your questions? You're wasting your limited time!<br>
I said I won't tell HER a damn thing! That doesn't mean I won't answer your questions!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Shinano ：</span><br>
As you say...<br>
Know you anything about a Sakuran envoy lending your country a fragment of the Watatsumi?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Marco Polo：</span><br>
Ah, the Watatsumi. If I remember right, you led the team that transported it from the Iron Blood's Floating Fortress, and...<br>
Tsk! Right!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Shinano ：</span><br>
Yes? Do you remember something?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Marco Polo：</span><br>
No, forget it! I know nothing about any blasted Watatsumi fragment!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Shinano ：</span><br>
Very well... Then, know you about any other sort of gift from the Sakura Empire?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Marco Polo：</span><br>
That, I do. When I was amassing antiques and works of art, I received quite a few from you Sakurans.<br>
I believe I put them in a warehouse in Venice.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Vittorio Veneto：</span><br>
Pardon? We searched that warehouse and didn't find a single Sakuran artifact.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Marco Polo：</span><br>
You did WHAT?! That was MY private warehouse!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Vittorio Veneto：</span><br>
Oh, please. Did you really think we'd leave your warehouse alone when you'd caused a crisis of cataclysmic proportions?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Marco Polo：</span><br>
Wh-whatever! I never said you COULDN'T search it!<br>
Just know that those artifacts are all invaluable! Search if you must, but be careful with them!<br>
Anything else? I'm getting quite tired all of... a... sudden...<br>
If that'll... be all... I'll just... Zzzzz...<br>
<br>
Marco Polo and her throne were there one moment, then gone the next.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Vittorio Veneto：</span><br>
Marco!<br>
What... What just happened?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Shinano ：</span><br>
The power given unto me by the dream ran out... Now she sleeps once more...<br>
Marco Polo's case is exceedingly special, making it very taxing to keep her here...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Vittorio Veneto：</span><br>
I see... So then you awoke her briefly to ask those questions? Could you share more about this "Watatsumi fragment"?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Shinano ：</span><br>
I'm afraid 'tis complicated... This one shall explain it in the waking world...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Vittorio Veneto：</span><br>
I understand. Let us speak again in the real world.<br>

Crimson Prelusion<br>
<br>
5 Reality - In the Eagle Union<br>
The Eagle Union's NY base had fallen into chaos.<br>
Gone was the sight of the ordinarily orderly workplace. Staff rushed to and fro, clamoring and rushing to complete their tasks.<br>
Amidst all this chaos, Saratoga furrowed her brow, trying her hardest to stay calm and reestablish order – or, at least, trying to make sense of the situation.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Saratoga：</span><br>
From Easter Island, to the bases at AF and PH... The same strange stuff is happening everywhere...<br>
Headquarters can't settle on a story either! What is it? A mistake? A transmission error? Nothing at all?!<br>
Like I'd believe that! The Pacific is a total mess! You can't tell me there's nothing going on!<br>
Ugh... If only the base at SD wasn't in the middle of a staff handover... If only Missouri wasn't on her way to DC and Yorktown wasn't away...<br>
This couldn't have come at a worse time...<br>
At the same time, complaining about it won't solve anything! I need to look for answers!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Communicator：</span><br>
BEEP BEEP!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Allen M. Sumner：</span><br>
Hey, Sara, I found another report you'll want to look at.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Saratoga：</span><br>
From the Pacific again?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Allen M. Sumner：</span><br>
Not this time. It's from the Panama Canal.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Saratoga：</span><br>
Panama?! Let me see it, quick!<br>
They're... hosting a ceremony to celebrate victory against the Sirens?<br>
I don't think there's been any major battles around there lately... Could you get Intrepid to check?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Allen M. Sumner：</span><br>
Roger!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Indianapolis：</span><br>
Sara, I've got a report as well.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Saratoga：</span><br>
Thanks, but we're completely swamped right now. Please keep it strictly to top priority reports.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Indianapolis：</span><br>
It IS top priority. From Europa, too.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Saratoga：</span><br>
Wait, Europa?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Indianapolis：</span><br>
Yeah.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Saratoga：</span><br>
That's where the Commander is... Show it to me!<br>
Oh my gosh... Not even Europa is safe from it...<br>
What in the world is happening? Are they all dreaming or something?<br>
Unless... that's it! What if they're under the effects of a massive mind attack, like what happened at the World Expo?<br>
And... the Commander has been redeployed to the Dragon Empery? Phew. It should be safe there, at least.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Communicator：</span><br>
BEEP BEEP!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Saratoga：</span><br>
What is it THIS time?!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Aylwin：</span><br>
Whoa! I hope this isn't a bad time...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Saratoga：</span><br>
Sorry, I'm just tense. Do you have any news?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Aylwin：</span><br>
Yes. DC finally replied to us.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Saratoga：</span><br>
Thank gosh! What did Iowa say?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Aylwin：</span><br>
Well, um, it wasn't Iowa who replied...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Saratoga：</span><br>
It wasn't her? Weird. I explicitly addressed it to her... Anyway, send it to me!<br>
What? "Iowa is dealing with a delegation from the Sakura Empire and won't be able to assist in other missions for some time"?<br>
But... didn't that delegation leave five days ago? How is she STILL dealing with them?<br>
And how can THAT possibly be more important than THIS?<br>
Ugh... I feel a headache coming on...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Communicator：</span><br>
BEEP BEEP!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Baltimore：</span><br>
Hey, Sara...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Saratoga：</span><br>
Yes? What's the bad news this time?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Baltimore：</span><br>
We've... lost contact with the Sea of Stars.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Saratoga：</span><br>
Wait, what?<br>
No... Even they haven't gone unscathed...<br>
But how? Its location is classified, its defense systems are cutting-edge, and some of our best people are stationed there...<br>
And... it's where Lex's care pod is...<br>
No! I can't let anything happen to the Sea of Stars!<br>
<br>
She hung up, stashed her secret documents in her locker, then hurried her way down the stairs to the underground level.<br>
NY Base - Underground Passage<br>
Following the near-superimposition event, the Eagle Union obtained the key pieces – local samples from the Orthodoxy and intel on its microlayer transference system – they needed to finally begin research on Siren teleportation technology.<br>
One result of this research is the Star Bridge – a high-speed network directly linking the NY base to the Sea of Stars.<br>
That's where Saratoga was going – to the underground bridge of hope.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Saratoga：</span><br>
They've calibrated the Star Bridge... It should take me straight to the Sea of Stars!<br>
<br>
The flame of hope in her heart spurred her on, making her run even faster.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Portland：</span><br>
Huh? Saratoga? I thought you were busy up in the command center.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Saratoga：</span><br>
Is the Star Bridge ready? Can it be started right here and now?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Portland：</span><br>
What? What's the "Star Bridge"?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Saratoga：</span><br>
The machine that makes a portal straight to the Sea of Stars! What else?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Portland：</span><br>
"Sea of Stars"? What's that? You sound disoriented. Should I call a doctor for you?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Saratoga：</span><br>
(Oh no... Now the mind attack is affecting people in NY, too!)<br>
(And we still haven't figured out anything about it!)<br>
(The Sea of Stars is the key to turning this situation around... I NEED to get there!)<br>
<br>
Saratoga made it to the room where the Star Bridge was kept.<br>
Inside, however, there was nothing. Only an empty room.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Saratoga：</span><br>
Has... the mind attack finally reached me?<br>
No, it's not over yet! Even if it's blocking out the Star Bridge from my mind, it can't just erase it from reality!<br>
Even if I can't see it or even feel it, it MUST be here, and the Sea of Stars must be on the other side of it!<br>
Assuming I'm right, I just need to find a way to activate it!<br>
<br>
Relying solely on her memory, she reached for the empty space in front of her, pressing buttons and keys on a panel that didn't exist.<br>
After fiddling with it for a long time, she finally heard the faint noise of a machine starting up.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Saratoga：</span><br>
I did it! Now I just need to step through the portal!<br>
<br>
She walked up to the portal platform and looked down to see only an abyss with no bottom in sight.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Saratoga：</span><br>
Trying to scare me, huh?<br>
<br>
She stood at the edge of the abyss, eyes closed.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Saratoga：</span><br>
It's all just an illusion...<br>
The way through is right here. I just need to walk forward to get to the Sea of Stars and see Lex!<br>
Don't be afraid, Sara!<br>
<br>
Just as she took a step toward the abyss, she felt like a tremendous force stopped her in her tracks.<br>
When she opened her eyes again, she found herself standing in a busy shopping district.<br>
There, not far away from her on the main road, stood someone who was waiting for her.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Lexington：</span><br>
There you are, Sara.<br>
I've been waiting for you. Has everything been going smoothly?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Saratoga：</span><br>
.......<br>
Lex... You're here?<br>

Crimson Prelusion<br>
<br>
6 Reality - The Storm<br>
I'm on board a private plane, cruising on a steady course through the Dragon Empery's airspace.<br>
While I can't see the ground for the clouds, we should be getting ready to descend sometime soon.<br>
We've been accompanied by escort aircraft ever since we entered the Empery's airspace. I'm happy to say it's been a smooth journey thus far.<br>
And yet, gazing at the dark clouds in the distance, I can't help but feel anxious.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
That over there – that's the infamous Storm, isn't it?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Chen Hai：</span><br>
Indeed. It's so enormous that it's nigh-impossible to avoid crossing it.<br>
Calling it A storm would be a bit of a misnomer, though. It's actually comprised of several storms of varying sizes moving as one.<br>
Not only are they linked to one another in direct violation of the laws of physics, they also rage all year round, effectively forming an impassable barrier.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Helena：</span><br>
That's also why the Empery's coastline is always blocked off.<br>
You can't even think about dispatching a fleet in this weather.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Chen Hai：</span><br>
Precisely. Our waters, both near and far, are always off-limits to us.<br>
Moreover, the Storm's strength fluctuates. Sometimes it's stronger, other times it's weaker.<br>
When it grows in intensity, it also affects a wider area.<br>
It still gets worse. Not only does the Storm ravage our coastlines, it's also a path for Sirens to invade through.<br>
This leads some to speculate that the Sirens are responsible for it.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
It blocks your sea access AND there's a good chance it serves as a base for the Sirens, eh.<br>
That certainly explains why the Empery can't send its fleets abroad.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Chen Hai：</span><br>
Yes. We would if we could.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Memphis：</span><br>
On a topic related to the Storm, the area around it has been affected by strange phenomena lately, hasn't it?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Chen Hai：</span><br>
Ah. I'm surprised you know about that.<br>
Yes, we believe the Sirens redeployed their forces across the globe following the battle of the Antarctic. That includes the waters around the Storm as well, naturally.<br>
While their presence weakened on the whole, their presence actually grew quite a lot in the regions plagued by the Storm.<br>
Worse yet, their long-dormant strongholds in the Marianas sprung back to life. Their observed presence there grows with each passing day.<br>
The Marianas also play a part in our upcoming operation.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Memphis：</span><br>
Let me guess – you're going to finally strike back at the Storm?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Chen Hai：</span><br>
You are correct. They've kept us prisoner on our own coastline for too long, and now it's time for payback.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
How likely is the plan to succeed?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Chen Hai：</span><br>
With your help – 100%. Heehee.<br>
<br>
The plane starts to descend, and the beautiful, splendid lands below the clouds come into view.<br>
At the same time, a curtain of light rises skyward in the distance, towering over the greenery on the horizon.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Memphis：</span><br>
Hey, Chen Hai, what's that? Don't tell me we're under attack!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Chen Hai：</span><br>
Oh, not at all. That is our barrier to protect against the Storm – the Pingfeng System.<br>
We activated it just to be safe since you were coming, even if the Storm is on the calmer side of things today.<br>
<br>
It's nice that they did. The landing process is going very smoothly on account of the curtain blocking out the turbulent weather.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
You know, your Pingfeng System reminds me a bit of the Orthodoxy's Skybound Wall.<br>
Is it a product of the two of you sharing technology, by any chance?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Chen Hai：</span><br>
I'm... surprised you'd ask about that. I had no hand in its development, so I'm afraid I can't answer your question.<br>
However, I'm sure you'll find someone who can soon. We'll be going to a banquet later, with many in attendance.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
A banquet? Why?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Chen Hai：</span><br>
Yat Sen insisted on it. She said you'll be tired after such a long journey, and a banquet will be just the thing to get you comfortable. We'll discuss the important things later.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Memphis：</span><br>
It's how they do things. The Empery always treats its guests well.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Helena：</span><br>
Ahh. Sounds like you know their culture well.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Memphis：</span><br>
Yeah, in fact, I do!<br>
I used to work as an ambassador, remember? I've done the reading.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Chen Hai：</span><br>
Yat Sen's motorcade should arrive at the airport any minute now.<br>
The touchdown will be a little bumpy, so I suggest you put your seatbelts on.<br>

<br>
7 Reality - The Guardian Fox's Resolve<br>
A group of Sakuran shipgirls stood on the Solomon Islands – a former frontline in the war against the Sirens.<br>
These islands, and the bases on them, haven't seen war for a long time since peace settled in around the world.<br>
There were no flames, no stench of gunpowder anywhere across the islands dotting the landscape. There was only a tropical paradise, extending as far as the eye could see.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Hiei：</span><br>
It feels strange, being in a place this tranquil with a fleet as large as ours.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Kirishima：</span><br>
I would welcome it if we were on vacation, but alas...<br>
They sent us so far away from the mainland. Why? I can't think of a good reason why they'd do it.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Haguro：</span><br>
Yeah. Seems fishy.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Shoukaku：</span><br>
I've heard it was a joint decision between Mikasa and Musashi.<br>
Strange, then, that the Great Veteran herself isn't with us. Hiei, have you heard anything from her?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Hiei：</span><br>
I did speak to her before leaving, but all she said was that she wanted us to investigate the strange phenomena reported around here.<br>
The only other thing I got from her is that she seemed to be in a terribly bad mood.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Shoukaku：</span><br>
Hmm. If I'd known this was coming, I would've stayed home with Zuikaku and made myself scarce.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Harutsuki：</span><br>
Then Lady Nagato wouldn't have a carrier to protect her! We all need you.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Shimanto：</span><br>
You're along for the ride now, at any rate. Relax – I'm sure this will go fine.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Kawakaze：</span><br>
Lady Nagato, it seems your escorts have mixed opinions about this redeployment.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Nagato：</span><br>
I am aware.<br>
I'm planning our next move and will announce it shortly.<br>
Tell them to stay calm and remain in position.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Kawakaze：</span><br>
As you command.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Nagato：</span><br>
......<br>
<br>
The loyal servant left Nagato's chamber, after which she breathed a sigh.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Nagato：</span><br>
Great Veteran... What did you and Musashi discuss that day?<br>
It is blatantly obvious that you and she decided on this redeployment.<br>
Rumors are abound that this is a ploy on your part to ostracize me.<br>
I know, of course, that it is not.<br>
You mean only to keep me safe, but doing so this way, it comes at the cost of your own safety.<br>
For this reason, I permitted Zuikaku to remain on the mainland.<br>
I can only hope she will serve you well...<br>
<br>
The dark room fell silent once more.<br>
Many minutes passed.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Nagato：</span><br>
First came Yamato's warning... Then your redeployment orders.<br>
The abnormality I sensed in the Sacred Sakura when I left the mainland... Is it related to this?<br>
You and Musashi are trying to prepare for the looming threat. That, I understand.<br>
However, there is no Sacred Sakura on these Solomon Islands.<br>
Even if the strange phenomena do warrant investigation, there is nothing for me to do here.<br>
It almost makes me think you are purposely keeping me far away just to protect me...<br>
......<br>
<br>
The girl kneeling on the ground grasped her sleeves and clenched them tightly.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Nagato：</span><br>
After all these ups and downs, twists and turns... I have not changed in the slightest...<br>
I seek to break free from fate, yet here I am, walking a path laid out by someone else...<br>
I swore to myself I would run away no longer, and I broke my own promise...<br>
If only I'd stood up for myself and not thoughtlessly accepted your order...<br>
Our country will soon face a great danger, and I should be at your side to face it with you...<br>
Instead, I sit here alone, all because I had a lapse of conviction...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Kongou：</span><br>
You're mistaken, Lady Nagato.<br>
Your redeployment to these islands wasn't some sort of jailbreak – it was a collective decision, and the correct one, at that.<br>
Mikasa is withholding things from you, but you intuited them and agreed with the decision, no?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Nagato：</span><br>
Kongou?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Kongou：</span><br>
My apologies for stopping by unannounced.<br>
I was walking by and saw Kawakaze grimacing, so I took it upon myself to check on you.<br>
Also, this next move of yours... It won't be to return straight to the mainland, will it?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Nagato：</span><br>
I... No, I will not go that far.<br>
Come in and sit. I've been meaning to have a word with you.<br>
<br>
Kongou bowed her head, stepped inside, and took a seat opposite Nagato.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Nagato：</span><br>
You are correct, Kongou.<br>
When I saw the Great Veteran's expression upon her return, I knew it instinctively.<br>
I knew why she had joined forces with Musashi, the one she swore to persuade to our side.<br>
After some thought, I came upon the realization that our country is already in danger.<br>
Swift decisions must be made, and it matters little whether I am present or not. That is how serious this danger that we face is.<br>
Better would be to keep me in reserve, far away from the threat, so I may serve as the spark that ignites a counterattack, should the worst come to fruition.<br>
That, I suspect, is also the rationale behind Musashi sending Shinano to Europa.<br>
I see the logic of her actions, it's just...<br>
I... I doubt my own ability as a soldier. I do not know if I can spark a counterattack.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Kongou：</span><br>
The Great Veteran believes in you, as do I.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Nagato：</span><br>
*sigh*...<br>
<br>
Nagato's clenched fists loosened their grip on her sleeves.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Nagato：</span><br>
Then my misgivings were for nothing.<br>
Mikasa said that something strange has happened here, and there is naught else for me to do than investigate it.<br>
Once that is done, we will return to the Sakura Islands and save everything!<br>
