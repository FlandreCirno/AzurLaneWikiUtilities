<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Langley：</span><br>
Sunny weather, gentle winds, and excellent visibility. Perfect weather for setting sail.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ark Royal：</span><br>
Indeed. Then, as we discussed, Her Majesty will join us and personally lead the fleet within a few days.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Saratoga：</span><br>
She's welcome any time! By the way, how's she doing? I haven't seen her in a while.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Prince of Wales：</span><br>
I can assure you that Her Majesty's state of health is splendid, as per the normal.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Sheffield：</span><br>
Ms. Wales, all the necessary preparations have been made. We shall depart on your command.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Prince of Wales：</span><br>
Excellent. Friends of the Eagle Union, I would like to thank you for your hospitality and your kindness.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Saratoga：</span><br>
Don't stress it, Wales! The people of NY City would love to have you around again!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Prince of Wales：</span><br>
I'm glad to hear that. Now, Enterprise, would you lead the way for us?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Enterprise：</span><br>
Absolutely. It's over here.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Vestal：</span><br>
Have a safe trip home, everyone~!<br>

<br>
Have a safe trip home, everyone~!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Prince of Wales：</span><br>
So, the STAR assessment is zero? Pleasantly calm, for a change.<br>
I must express my gratitude to you for setting up this joint exercise area for us. The girls all wanted a little practice.<br>
Of course, that includes me as well. I have heard many a tale about your heroic deeds, Enterprise, and I was hoping to test your skill for myself.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Enterprise：</span><br>
You don't need to be so flattering, Wales. The Eagle Union stands with its allies, and we're happy to have the opportunity to practice with you.<br>
To tell the truth, I've been waiting for a chance to polish up my skills, too.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Prince of Wales：</span><br>
Very well, then let's tone down the formalities from here on. The Royal Navy will fight with all it's got, and we hope you will, too.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ark Royal：</span><br>
Let's find out if the Eagle Union's carrier fleet is as amazing as they say!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Enterprise：</span><br>
That's more like it. Eagle Union fleet, let's get ready! Hooyah!<br>
<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Prince of Wales：</span><br>
Now THAT was a battle! We admit defeat.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ark Royal：</span><br>
It definitely was. You predicted our attacking fleet's position and countered like it was nothing. Now I can see why you've earned the nickname "Big E."<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Enterprise：</span><br>
I'm honored, but I alone don't deserve all the credit. I couldn't have done it without the rest of the fleet.<br>
... By the way, we've been saying goodbye for quite some time now. You should probably get going soon. Hopefully, we'll get another chance to fight like this in the future.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Prince of Wales：</span><br>
I'm sure it won't be long until it comes, at least if this war with the Sirens continues.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Enterprise：</span><br>
Funny you mention that. I was just gonna offer you an escort through the higher-risk waters. Lots of Sirens in some places.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Prince of Wales：</span><br>
Thanks, but we'll be fine. If any show up, they'll serve as morale-boosting victories after our defeat against you.<br>
Moreover, ensuring the safety of NY City should be your highest priority. You don't need to worry about us.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Sheffield：</span><br>
It is my honour and duty to clean up any pests that impede our travels. Please, allow me to take care of it.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Enterprise：</span><br>
All right, if you say so. Good luck, everyone!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Prince of Wales：</span><br>
Likewise. May Lady Luck smile upon the Eagle Union.<br>
... I know this ill-boding feeling all too well...<br>
Attention, everyone! We must head home and report to Her Majesty immediately!<br>

<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Denver：</span><br>
Escortin' ships all daaaay~♪ Gotta clear out the waaaaay~♪<br>
Oh! Is that them over there, Enty? The merchant ships we gotta escort?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Enterprise：</span><br>
That's them. Just so happened our routes and schedules aligned, so they gave us the job of escorting them to port.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Denver：</span><br>
A job's a job, but... why? Isn't this area supposed to be safe?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Columbia：</span><br>
It is, if your deck's packed with cannons and you're trained in naval combat. If you're a merchant ship, not so much.<br>
That's why the threat evaluation for this place differs between naval and civilian nautical maps. When you're unarmed, it's better to be safe than sorry.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Denver：</span><br>
Makes sense... I mean, "safe" is relative in the first place, but still.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Columbia：</span><br>
You'll learn a lotta stuff if you pay close attention, and not just in combat. You don't wanna end up like Monty and get tunnel vision.<br>
... Speaking of which, watch where you're going! There's sea mines here!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Denver：</span><br>
Whoops! Aye-aye, ma'am!<br>

<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Denver：</span><br>
Phew... We all made it in one piece...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Memphis：</span><br>
That you did. Job well done getting those ships back to port.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Enterprise：</span><br>
Memphis? I thought you were preparing for a meeting?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Memphis：</span><br>
Among other things... I've got goods to relocate, strategic documents to draft, and messages to relay... Basically, up to my neck in paperwork.<br>
Note to self: never tempt fate again by telling people about your weekend vacation plans... Oh, did I say that out loud?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Enterprise：</span><br>
Sounds stressful. Wouldn't want to be in your shoes...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Memphis：</span><br>
Have to get through it somehow. Anyway, you three are going to group up with Cleveland's fleet and head out on a mission, right?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Denver：</span><br>
Eyup! Groupin' up and headin' out, that's the plan!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Enterprise：</span><br>
What she said. Why do you ask? Did something happen?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Memphis：</span><br>
Actually, yes: your AO has changed. The higher-ups have ordered you to go on a special mission instead.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Enterprise：</span><br>
A special mission...?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Memphis：</span><br>
I've already informed the Commander about it, so consider that done.<br>
Here, this mission briefing outlines your orders. Read it later when you have time.<br>
The mission is in Siren-occupied waters, so prepare yourselves accordingly. If you need to, contact me by radio...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Columbia：</span><br>
Gotta say, I'm really impressed by your dedication today.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Memphis：</span><br>
Dedication? That's just the coffee doing the talking...<br>
Either that, or all this paperwork is driving me crazy and I'm just ecstatic to catch a break from it. Dunno really.<br>
Anyway... that should be everything you need to know. Now, if you'll excuse me, I need to move on to the next task at hand.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Enterprise：</span><br>
Thanks, Memphis. Hope your work goes well.<br>
Let's see... Recon mission in an AO with a STAR rating of 4... Interesting...<br>
All right, everyone. Inspect your gear and restock on supplies and ammo. Soon as everyone's done, we'll sortie.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Denver：</span><br>
Gotcha, Enty! I'll just need to find a gift for Cleve real quick!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Columbia：</span><br>
There's that gift shop we went by earlier. Might be worth a look...<br>
？？？：<br>
Heh heh heh... Let's hope you have a "pleasant" voyage...<br>

<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Denver：</span><br>
Man, wasn't expecting to see this many Sirens 'round here...!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Columbia：</span><br>
Just a bunch of stragglers. We could zoom by without bothering to mop 'em up...<br>
... is what I'd like to say, but we can't group up with Cleve until we get rid of 'em.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Enterprise：</span><br>
Don't underestimate the enemy. You never know what'll happen when Sirens are involved!<br>
All units, prepare to engage! Don't get cocky!<br>

<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Enterprise：</span><br>
This is Enterprise. Fleet has arrived safely at the rendezvous point. Good work, everyone.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Denver：</span><br>
Cleve! We missed you!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Cleveland：</span><br>
Yo, Denver! Good to see you again!<br>
As you probably saw, these Sirens don't fight so good, but they do have numbers on their side. Clearing all of 'em out is gonna take some time.<br>
So, time to head to the AO, right?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Enterprise：</span><br>
Yeah, but there's been a change of plans. Higher-ups gave us a special mission; we'll be doing reconnaissance in Siren territory.<br>
They said they already informed the Commander about it, so everything should be in order.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Cleveland：</span><br>
Sounds good to me! Besides, we'd surely grow rusty if we just fight these scrub Sirens all day.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Montpelier：</span><br>
Cleve! I brought you extra supplies! Oh, and a gift from Denver as well!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Cleveland：</span><br>
Really? Nice! I was just feeling a bit hungry, actually. Cheers! Om nom nom...<br>
All right, let's do this! With the combined power of Enterprise and the Knights of the Sea, we're unstoppable!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Everyone：</span><br>
Hooyah!<br>

<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Denver：</span><br>
Well, this isn't quite what I expected...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Columbia：</span><br>
Weird that this place is rated STAR 3. I don't see enough Sirens to warrant it...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Enterprise：</span><br>
According to our intel, the Sirens' sphere of influence is rapidly shrinking in this area...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Denver：</span><br>
So, they're skipping town, pretty much?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Enterprise：</span><br>
Maybe, maybe not. As per usual, HQ can't really figure out what the Sirens are planning.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Denver：</span><br>
Well, if it results in this area being less dangerous, it's a good thing.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Montpelier：</span><br>
No, it's not. The more territory we control, the more thinly spread out our defenses get.<br>
... I've got a bad feeling about this.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Enterprise：</span><br>
This mission is partly about uncovering what the Sirens are up to. All ships, keep your guards up as we advance.<br>

	Siren Threat Assessment Rating: 4<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Cleveland：</span><br>
They didn't stage anything even resembling an organized attack...<br>
Have we gotten really good, or did the Sirens just stop trying?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Enterprise：</span><br>
Don't make me keep saying it. Keep your guard up while we're in hostile territory.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Cleveland：</span><br>
But they're giving us the chance to take back territory they stole from us... Maybe that was always part of the plan, and that's why we prepared so much?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Denver：</span><br>
Uh, guys? My transceiver's bugging out on me... Anyone else getting a signal?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Transceiver：</span><br>
KRRRRRRRRRHHHHHHH...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Columbia：</span><br>
Nope... Nothing but static.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Cleveland：</span><br>
Hang on, lemme check... Oh, I knew it! Someone or something is jamming our comms!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Montpelier：</span><br>
Dammit! They must've lured us into a trap!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Cleveland：</span><br>
Enterprise, what do we do? Do we keep going, or pull out?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Enterprise：</span><br>
... We're pulling out. Our orders are not to take unnecessary risks, and to keep going forward would be one.<br>
All ships, 180-degree turn! We're heading back to NY City!<br>

We made it out! Now our comms should... Hey, they're still being jammed!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Cleveland：</span><br>
I can't get in touch with the coastal defense fleet either... Hey, Enterprise? Think you could launch some scout planes? I'm worried about an attack on NY City.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Montpelier：</span><br>
Uh, Cleve... has this area always been prone to waves this big?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Cleveland：</span><br>
Waves...? Oh, God! Enterprise, the sea has totally changed! This is lookin' really bad!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Enterprise：</span><br>
This can only mean one thing: we've entered a Mirror Sea! All ships, prepare for combat!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Cleveland：</span><br>
A Mirror Sea?! This close to home?!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Montpelier：</span><br>
This is just like that report said! "One moment everything's normal, then the next you're in a Mirror Sea!"<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Denver：</span><br>
Picking up signals from unidentified vessels!<br>
It's a massive Siren fleet! They're coming at us from every direction!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Montpelier：</span><br>
"And then, bam! Before you know it, you're completely surrounded by Sirens"! It's exactly the same!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Enterprise：</span><br>
Everyone, turn around and maintain your distance to each other! We'll trace our route back to get out of here!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Cleveland：</span><br>

Thank God you were with us, Enterprise! If you weren't, we'd never have left that place alive...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Denver：</span><br>
Where the heck did those Sirens even come from?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Columbia：</span><br>
No clue... Maybe the ones we spotted way earlier just disappeared and then reappeared in there...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Montpelier：</span><br>
Cleve, I'm getting a transmission! Let's hear what it... Oh my God...<br>
... It's... an unencoded message... from NY City...! Enterprise... there has been an attack...<br>
