Azur Anthem - Side Story<br>
<br>
1 Idols<br>
Port - Boardwalk<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Azusa Miura：</span><br>
Hehe~ Being able to take leisurely strolls along the shore is great, isn't it~<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Chihaya Kisaragi：</span><br>
Definitely. Plus, there are so many things here we'd never get to see back home, so you'd never get tired of the view. By the way, doesn't it feel like there are more people here than usual?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Azusa Miura：</span><br>
Oh, now that you mention it... I wonder if there's something going on?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Chihaya Kisaragi：</span><br>
Who knows? Everyone seems to be heading to the central courtyard though...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Javelin：</span><br>
Oh hey, Azusa and Chihaya! What are you two doing?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Chihaya Kisaragi：</span><br>
Good morning, Javelin. We were just out for a stroll. By the way, is there something going on at the courtyard? I couldn't help but to notice all the people.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Javelin：</span><br>
About that... Today, our local idols are holding a special concert!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Azusa Miura：</span><br>
The Muse girls are going to be performing?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Javelin：</span><br>
Err, not quite... They're normal idols, just like the ones from your world.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Chihaya Kisaragi：</span><br>
There are regular idols in this world as well, huh?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Azusa Miura：</span><br>
That's definitely something I'd like to experience while I'm here~<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Javelin：</span><br>
In that case, I'll show you to the venue! Looks like ticketing has already started, so we'll need to hurry up!<br>
<br>
Port - Courtyard Concert Venue<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Javelin：</span><br>
Phew~ We made it just in time! I'm glad we were able to get seats!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Chihaya Kisaragi：</span><br>
So many people... Are we watching someone famous?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Azusa Miura：</span><br>
Look, someone's coming out on stage~<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">San Diego：</span><br>
Woooohoo! Everyone, thanks for coming to see me~!!<br>
I'm the port's number one idol, San Diego, and I'll be starting things off today~!<br>
Things are gonna get pretty wild around here, so make sure you keep your eyes on me until the very end~!<br>
All righty, let's start the music! It's time to pump things up~!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Saratoga：</span><br>
"Next up, it's the one and only Sister Sara~! Huh? You can't see me? Ehehe~ I wonder, where could I be hiding?"<br>
"...Eh? You're giving up just like that? Fiiine~"<br>
"The correct answer is..."<br>
Tadaaaah~! Right here in the audience~!<br>
How'd you like Sister Sara's surprise present? Did it make your heart skip a beat~?<br>
Welp, time to head back to the stage~! The show must go on~♪<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Benson：</span><br>
Huh? A special idol concert...?!<br>
And you didn't invite Benson, the cutest, prettiest girl in the whole galaxy?!<br>
I'm gonna bunny hop right in! I'll show you just how a charming the cutest idol from Planet Bunny really is! Buuuuunny Bomber!!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Chihaya Kisaragi：</span><br>
What is going on...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Azusa Miura：</span><br>
Oh my...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Javelin：</span><br>
W-well, our concerts are known to be a little unpredictable... Ahahaha!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Azusa Miura：</span><br>
I've never seen a concert as free-form as this before, but it looks like both the idols and the audience are having a great time.<br>
Hehe~ It's making me want to go up on stage as well~<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Javelin：</span><br>
Ahaha... As long as you're having fun, right?<br>
Chihaya, by the way, you've had a really stern face for quite some time now...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Chihaya Kisaragi：</span><br>
……<br>
(They're pulling the audience in with their flashy performance, and even making them a part of the show...)<br>
(It seems sloppy and unprofessional at first, but this might actually be the next frontier of music. I'll have to look into this some more...)<br>

<br>
2 Port<br>
Port - Courtyard<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Javelin：</span><br>
My name is Javelin, and I'll be showing you around the port. I hope we can become good friends!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Haruka Amami：</span><br>
Nice to meet you, Javelin! It's kind of exciting getting to know everyone~♪<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Iori Minase：</span><br>
So you'll be taking us on a tour, I take it? I wonder what kind of place this is...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Laffey：</span><br>
Let's get going...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Javelin：</span><br>
First of, this is our... Hey, Miss Veneto! When'd you put a miniature Colosseum in here...?!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Haruka Amami：</span><br>
Woah...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ritsuko Akizuki：</span><br>
So they also have a Colosseum in this world, but... I'm frankly blown away...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Vittorio Veneto：</span><br>
Hehe~ You can't help but to marvel at the symbol of Sardegna's majesty, right?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Haruka Amami：</span><br>
There's even a stack of promotional pamphlets in the corner... Just what kind of place is this?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Vittorio Veneto：</span><br>
Why, this is the place I've prepared to let everyone learn about the glory of Sardegna. By the way, would you be interested in some more information?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Javelin：</span><br>
(It's just our normal visitors' center!) ...Umm, I think we're good! I'm just showing everyone around the port today!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Vittorio Veneto：</span><br>
I see, in that case... why not show them to one of our famous locations, like our canteen or the shrine behind the mountains? They're both nice spots.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Javelin：</span><br>
Thanks for the suggestions! The shrine is a bit out of the way, so we should save that for the end... Why don't we head to the canteen first?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Haruka Amami：</span><br>
Excuse me, is it okay to take a look in this place?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Laffey：</span><br>
This isn't one of the port's buildings, but... it's probably okay to take a look...<br>
<br>
Port - Canteen<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Laffey：</span><br>
Canteen's right here... This is where you eat... More importantly, the place you go to drink is...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Haruka Amami：</span><br>
(Woah, this place gives off totally mature vibes... Should we even be in here...?)<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Bismarck：</span><br>
Hm? Ahh... Visitors from another world. Tallinn, would you mind serving our guests a glass?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Haruka Amami：</span><br>
Ehh?! Um, we're still underage, so we can't...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Bismarck：</span><br>
Don't worry, it's just fruit juice.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Haruka Amami：</span><br>
...Ah, um, then I suppose I'll try a bit... Woah! Apple juice? ...It's so crisp and refreshing!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ami Futami：</span><br>
Ohhhh, it's deliciously sweet with just the right amount of sour...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Mami Futami：</span><br>
Did you make these from super expensive apples or something?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Bismarck：</span><br>
Consider this a token of our hospitality. I'm glad you're all enjoying it.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Haruka Amami：</span><br>
Thank you very much! That sure hit the spot~♪<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Javelin：</span><br>
It's getting pretty late... But there's one last place for us to go. After we head up these stairs, we'll get to meet Fusou and see the shrine!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Haruka Amami：</span><br>
……<br>
(There's a ton of fun stuff to do here, and everyone seems super nice, but it really is a much different world here compared to back home...)<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Laffey：</span><br>
Let's keep going.<br>
<br>
Port - Shrine<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Haruka Amami：</span><br>
Woah... Such pretty lights...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Fusou：</span><br>
Oh, visitors at this hour? Good evening~<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Yamashiro：</span><br>
You're the idols from another world, right? I've been wanting to meet you all sooo badly~!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Chihaya Kisaragi：</span><br>
They have huge shrines in this world too, huh...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Azusa Miura：</span><br>
Hehe, it's nice to know that we have so much in common~<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Haruka Amami：</span><br>
Mhm, I feel the same way!<br>
I'm so glad I got to see all these amazing places around the port today!<br>
All these familiar sights and sounds are finally letting me calm down... Hehe~<br>

Azur Anthem - Side Story<br>
<br>
3 Lessons<br>
Port - Office<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Z23：</span><br>
A great performance is only made possible by the hours of practice that go into it... so first, we'll need to plan out the lessons.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Amazon：</span><br>
Today, we're joined by Ritsuko and Iori, idol advising specialists. It's great to have the two of you here!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Iori Minase：</span><br>
Feel free to ask me anything. As a top-tier idol, there's no question I won't be able to answer! Hehe~<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ritsuko Akizuki：</span><br>
I'm a fairly experienced idol as well, so I'll be glad to help however I can!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Z23：</span><br>
Great, let's dive right in then. When drafting a lesson plan, we have to first think about the areas that need the most improvement.<br>
Just as a point of reference, what do the two of you think are the most important things that idols should get from the lessons?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Iori Minase：</span><br>
Let's see... Well, you can't put on a show unless the singing and dancing are on lock.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ritsuko Akizuki：</span><br>
I think expressiveness is also important. It's a big part of singing and dancing, but also carries over to a variety of other aspects.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Amazon：</span><br>
That's true. Without all three of those things, you can't even be an idol.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Z23：</span><br>
All right. Let's make a lesson plan that revolves around these three things: singing, dancing, and expressiveness.<br>
However... I do think it's important to say that right now, I feel like I'm trying to plan without a specific goal in mind.<br>
Of course the end goal is to be able to put on a higher-quality performance, but that's rather vague and doesn't tell us what we need to do to get there.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Iori Minase：</span><br>
Yeah~ It's definitely hard to see that when you first are starting out.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Amazon：</span><br>
Some say that training without a purpose is no better than not training at all.<br>
But how should we go about setting those tangible goals?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ritsuko Akizuki：</span><br>
Why not start with something short-term first?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Z23：</span><br>
Short-term, huh...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ritsuko Akizuki：</span><br>
That's right. Break down the things you want to achieve into small, realistic chunks that build up towards the final goal.<br>
For example, if your final goal is to become a top idol, your short-term goals would be to make each and every performance memorable.<br>
That also gives us an idea of how we want to structure our lessons for each performance, so we always have something to work towards.<br>
Why don't you try setting some short-term goals and start from there?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Iori Minase：</span><br>
(As expected from Ritsuko. Her advice is always so insightful!)<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Z23：</span><br>
That seems manageable enough.<br>
If we treat the performance and the lessons as a package... Then, how about we schedule a concert two months out? I'll plan out the lessons with that timetable in mind.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Amazon：</span><br>
...Huh?!<br>
(She skipped straight to the scheduling?!)<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ritsuko Akizuki：</span><br>
In that case... Let's start by making sure everyone has the songs memorized and the choreography ready to go.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Iori Minase：</span><br>
Huh? W-wait, Ritsuko?<br>
(Wait, why are you acting like you're a part of this?!)<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Z23：</span><br>
I see now. After that, we'll be able to adjust the choreography and figure out how to improve on the singing.<br>
Then, we'll need to have group lessons that focus on piecing together everyone's individual parts, in addition to the solo lessons.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ritsuko Akizuki：</span><br>
That's precisely right!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Iori Minase：</span><br>
(At this rate...)<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Amazon：</span><br>
(This conversation is going bottoms up...!!)<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ritsuko Akizuki：</span><br>
Also, when we get to that point, there's another thing we need to be careful about when it comes to lessons...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Amazon：</span><br>
Alright, t-time out, you two!!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Iori Minase：</span><br>
Stop talking for a minute, and take a few steps back!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Amazon：</span><br>
Yeah! You can't just "schedule" a concert out of nowhere! That wasn't part of our plans at all!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Z23：</span><br>
Hmm... I thought that was the right timeframe to optimize our lessons...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Amazon：</span><br>
That might be true, but that's also not the issue here...!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Z23：</span><br>
Let's see if the commander would be willing to help us come up with a tentative plan then.<br>
Alright, Ritsuko, the next thing on the agenda is...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Amazon：</span><br>
Like... I... Said!! Don't just go planning things without getting permission first!!<br>

Azur Anthem - Side Story<br>
<br>
4 Fun and Games<br>
Port - Sakura Empire Dorms<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Mami Futami：</span><br>
Hiyah! Yaargh! Gaah! Not yet—!!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ayanami：</span><br>
Too naive. Jump. Left hook. Activate skill.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Fubuki：</span><br>
Aaaahhhh!! Why are you attacking me?!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ami Futami：</span><br>
Nihihi~! The three of you seem to be forgetting about someone! Finishing move...! Ultraaa... Burning... Punch!!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Futami Mami・Ayanami・Fubuki：</span><br>
Ahhhhh——!!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ami Futami：</span><br>
Hooray! It's Ami's win~!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ayanami：</span><br>
Ugh... I can't believe I lost... I must say, the two of you are quite good at this game, yes.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Mami Futami：</span><br>
We played a whole lot of games back home as well~♪ But, I'm glad that there are a lot of fun games here that we can all play together~!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Fubuki：</span><br>
Yeah, we love having new friends to play together with too! So, which game do you want to try next?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Mami Futami：</span><br>
Hmm... How about this one?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ayanami：</span><br>
This is a rhythm game that just came out recently... But, it's only for two players.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ami Futami：</span><br>
Don't give up just like that! ......Tadah~!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Fubuki：</span><br>
Four disposable chopsticks? ...What are we doing with those?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ami Futami：</span><br>
Drawing lots, of course! Let's have a team battle! Best of three takes the whole thing!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ayanami：</span><br>
That sounds interesting. Let's draw our lots quickly then.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ami Futami：</span><br>
Everyone got theirs? Alrighty, let's see what we got! One... two...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Futami Ami：</span><br>
Team A!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Futami Mami：</span><br>
Team B!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Mami Futami：</span><br>
All right, Booky, we're partners! Let's kick some butt!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Fubuki：</span><br>
I'm pretty confident in my rhythm game skills. Victory will be ours for sure!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ami Futami：</span><br>
That's what I want to hear! Of course, we don't plan on losing either! Right, Nommy~?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ayanami：</span><br>
Of course. Don't underestimate my gamer skills... I'll take the first round.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Mami Futami：</span><br>
You're on! Mami Futami from Team B will be your opponent! Let's get started!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ayanami：</span><br>
Right... Left... Crap, right again? Ugh... My combo...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Mami Futami：</span><br>
Right... Right... Left~♪ Hehe, this is a pretty catchy song~<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Fubuki：</span><br>
...And that's the end of the round. The winner is... Mami!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Mami Futami：</span><br>
That's one point to Team B! Get us over the finish line, Booky!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ayanami：</span><br>
I apologize... It's in your hands, Ami.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ami Futami：</span><br>
Just leave it to me~! I wonder if I'll be able to snatch victory from the jaws of defeat~<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Fubuki：</span><br>
Let's see if you can stop me! All right then, let's start the second round!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ami Futami：</span><br>
Up~ Down~♪ Piece of cake! I've even got bonus time! Dadadada~♪<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Fubuki：</span><br>
Up, down, left... H-huh? Where'd that note come from? Argh, I can't keep up at all...!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ayanami：</span><br>
...The second round goes to Ami.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Fubuki：</span><br>
I thought I was ready for anything... So, uhh, does this mean it's a draw?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ayanami：</span><br>
Idols really do have a better sense of rhythm, considering they're trying this for the first time...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Mami Futami：</span><br>
That's a difference in experience! But I must say, Nommy, you're a really great gamer! Our scores were really close!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ami Futami：</span><br>
Yeah, totally~♪ Also, Booky, you did great too! It was like we were dancing together~!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Mami Futami：</span><br>
Yup, yup! Hey, hey, Booky~ How about playing against me next?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ami Futami：</span><br>
Ah, I want to play with you too, Nommy! ...So how about a tiebreaker?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Fubuki：</span><br>
Challenge accepted! That first time was just the warm-up! I won't make the same mistake twice!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ayanami：</span><br>
My pride is on the line, and I won't lose again.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Futami Ami：</span><br>
Nihihi~! We'll see about that~!<br>
