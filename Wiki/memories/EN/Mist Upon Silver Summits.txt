Iris Orthodoxy - Holy Capital<br>
Faction Conference Hall<br>
One day before meeting<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Libeccio：</span><br>
Alright! Chairs and desks are all in place!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Nicoloso da Recco：</span><br>
Nice! You've even arranged all the furnishings so neatly.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Libeccio：</span><br>
Yeah! I used a ruler to determine where to put them!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Nicoloso da Recco：</span><br>
Oh! No wonder it looks like they've been placed with great care!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Libeccio：</span><br>
Got to live up to our reputation for great hospitality, after all!<br>
Wait, why are we chatting? We still have work to do, Cap'n!<br>
There's going to be a dinner party in the banquet hall after the meeting!<br>
Those tables aren't going to set themselves!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Maestrale：</span><br>
Yes. In fact, the banquet hall is our top priority. We can't cut any corners with it.<br>
Especially not with the ingredients. Time was running short, so Trieste went out to buy them herself.<br>
I hope she's able to able to find everything...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Nicoloso da Recco：</span><br>
You know, that reminds me of a thing I've been wondering about...<br>
This conference was our idea and we're the ones organizing it, so why are we hosting it in the Orthodoxy?<br>
We wouldn't have to worry about getting the right ingredients if we were doing this back home.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Libeccio：</span><br>
Yeah, that IS weird! Maestrale, you're smart – what do you think?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Maestrale：</span><br>
Umm... It's for diplomatic reasons, maybe? I'm not sure either, really.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Vittorio Veneto：</span><br>
Heehee. There are two good reasons why we're doing it here rather than home, actually.<br>
The first is that the Orthodoxy lent us this locale. The second is that they're covering half of our expenditures, but still letting us have the honor of organizing it.<br>
All in all, this is quite a fine arrangement for us.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Maestrale：</span><br>
That explains it...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Nicoloso da Recco：</span><br>
Veneto! You're back!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Vittorio Veneto：</span><br>
Hello. I just finished revising our program, so I came here to check on you all.<br>
You've done a great job so far. Everything looks neat and tidy and the decorations are very Sardegnian.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Communicator：</span><br>
BEEP BEEP!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Littorio：</span><br>
Everything's good here, Veneto. How is it on your end?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Vittorio Veneto：</span><br>
I just received a message from Trieste. She said she was out buying groceries and got help from some Iris girls.<br>
Sounds to me like the dinner party tomorrow will go fine.<br>
Oh, and they're done arranging the tables and chairs around the venue.<br>
I can say with confidence that our guests will be able to treated extraordinarily well in Sardegnian style.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Littorio：</span><br>
Excellent. I feared we'd have to start sending ingredients by plane. Glad that worst case scenario didn't come true.<br>
What about your conference opening speech for tomorrow? Have you written it yet?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Vittorio Veneto：</span><br>
Oh... My opening speech...<br>
Right... I'm delivering a speech tomorrow...<br>
Umm, it still has a few details I need to fill in...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Littorio：</span><br>
Oh boy... That doesn't sound very reassuring.<br>
I'll come over. I won't be long!<br>

<br>
Somewhere, in an unknown location...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Observer ：</span><br>
I knew it. There weren't just three Arbiters that came to this branch.<br>
Empress III... You're good at hiding.<br>
In the end, my patience won out, though.<br>
Now that you've involved yourself in this branch, you can't slip back into the darkness anymore.<br>
You have access to far more resources than I do, yes, but that's not something I can't compensate for.<br>
My plan can finally continue now, thanks to you.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Akagi：</span><br>
...Observer?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Observer ：</span><br>
We meet again. How are you, Akagi? Have you been sleeping and eating well?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Akagi：</span><br>
...What do you want? It's the middle of the night. If you just want to chat, I'm going to hang up.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Observer ：</span><br>
Hang up? That's no way to treat the person you want help from.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Akagi：</span><br>
Help? I thought you were dead. I haven't heard from you for the longest time.<br>
Besides, we're not friends. We're just acquaintances who exploit one another.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Observer ：</span><br>
I know it's been a long while. I couldn't do anything about that.<br>
But don't talk to me about "exploiting one another." I never needed you in particular. Anyone who could open a Singularity would've been fine by me.<br>
You, on the other hand? You DID need me. Without access to my resources, who could've granted your wish?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Akagi：</span><br>
......<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Observer ：</span><br>
Don't give me that look. I'm not here to waste your time. Have a look at this.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Akagi：</span><br>
...What is this? Documents?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Observer ：</span><br>
In your language, I guess you'd call it a... formation diagram.<br>
You want to amplify the Watatsumi's power using the Sacred Sakura system I constructed, don't you? This is the system's operation manual.<br>
But perhaps you've changed your mind and you're going to pin your hopes that toy you and Musashi made.<br>
You won't get anywhere with that thing. This, on the other hand, is tailor-made for your needs.<br>
It's all yours. Go on and take it.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Akagi：</span><br>
...That I will.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Observer ：</span><br>
Incidentally, have you named your operation?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Akagi：</span><br>
I've not even thought about it yet. What does it matter?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Observer ：</span><br>
Well, it's going to need one, so how about "Orochi"?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Akagi：</span><br>
"Orochi"? Is this another one of your sick schemes?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Observer ：</span><br>
No, not at all. It's just a name I came across in my database.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Akagi：</span><br>
Orochi... The legendary serpent...<br>
Heehee... You know what? I'll go with that name.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Observer ：</span><br>
Great. Take the Origin Cube out of your toy and stick it into the core system. You know which tree that is, right?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Akagi：</span><br>
Yes. I'm not stupid.<br>
I'll... BZZZ... set up... BZZZ... and when it's... BZZZ...<br>
BZZZ... set off... BZZZ...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Communicator：</span><br>
BZZZZZZ...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Observer ：</span><br>
Akagi?<br>
Hello? Akagi?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Communicator：</span><br>
......<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Observer ：</span><br>
Strange...<br>
Is the signal being jammed?<br>
Isn't she using the communicator I gave her?<br>
Someone is jamming MY equipment in MY test site?<br>
No... THAT CANNOT BE!<br>

<br>
Iris Orthodoxy - Holy Capital<br>
Faction Conference Hall<br>
Evening<br>
The long conference has finally come to an end. The light of dusk shines in through the windows.<br>
Needing a break, I go for a stroll through the building's corridors rather than head for the banquet hall.<br>
In the end, I arrive at a balcony just outside the lounge.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Memphis：</span><br>
These castles look so picturesque during twilight.<br>
You did stellar during the conference, Commander.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
So did you. You have a tough job.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Memphis：</span><br>
Ahahaha... Yeah, I suppose.<br>
<br>
She smiles a somewhat tired smile and points to the lanyard hanging from her neck that reads, "Secretary."<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Memphis：</span><br>
I'm really just doing my job.<br>
Want an apple? It's sweet and fresh. Snuck it out of the fruit bowl myself.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Thanks, but I'll pass. If I could use any fruit right now, it'd be a lemon to clear my head.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Memphis：</span><br>
Ahahah... Figures. Must've been a rough day for you.<br>
It's just been speech after speech from different faction reps, but the conversation hasn't gone anywhere. Just thinking about it gives me a headache.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
You could say that again. This was supposed to be about the Iris Orthodoxy rejoining the Azur Lane...<br>
I didn't think expect there would be so many layers to this topic.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Memphis：</span><br>
The Crimson Axis was bound to push back against it. Naval HQ, too.<br>
Then, talks drifted from the Orthodoxy rejoining the Azur Lane to whether the Azur Lane and the Crimson Axis should merge into one...<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
...The reforging of a unified Azur Lane? So that's the "main dish" that has drawn the attention of Naval HQ.<br>
So much has happened. Compiler was defeated. The Northern Parliament's offensive in the Arctic. Interdimensional exploration with Flying Fortresses, that near-superimposition event, the incident with the Sacred Sakura...<br>
One way or another, the different factions have found themselves joining hands. The once-distant dream of a reunified Azur Lane seems like it's on the verge of coming true.<br>
But, now when everyone's in high spirits, things are starting to drag.<br>
After Veneto and Richelieu set everything up for us, too...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Memphis：</span><br>
What surprises me, however, is that the Iris Orthodoxy would hand over the hosting of the talks to Sardegna, given how Richelieu has been in dialogue with the Tribunal.<br>
As for the other factions...<br>
The Eagle Union has expressed clear support for the merger, but the attitudes of the Royal Navy and Northern Parliament have been somewhat... ambiguous.<br>
In typical Dragon Empery fashion, they've said that they "respect the decisions of each faction and support resolving any potential issues through peaceful dialogue."<br>
On the other side, the Crimson Axis isn't exactly a monolith either.<br>
Though Sardegna is clearly in support, the Sakura Empire stands in staunch opposition.<br>
And of course, Iron Blood is secretive as always, keeping their cards close to their chest.<br>
I should've expected this much from a public conference. *sigh*... When will it end?<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
In other words, things have reverted to how they were before Operation Siren. When will we finally be able to move on?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Memphis：</span><br>
Yeah... I know how you feel.<br>
One meeting after another, plans upon plans, until even the most basic of things can't be done anymore.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
So, Memphis, what do you personally think about the reformation of the Azur Lane?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Memphis：</span><br>
Hm? You want my opinion?<br>
Well, of course it'd be a dream come true if everyone could come together.<br>
But, surface-level formalities aren't going to cut it. We need a more substantial alliance.<br>
Nobody's going to stick their neck out for a token partnership. On the contrary, these constraints will only create tensions that weaken everyone involved.<br>
What about you, Commander? What do you think?<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
The same as you, really.<br>
I want to tear down the walls between us and unite all the factions.<br>
But as it is now, reforming the Azur Lane won't bring much change at all.<br>
All that would do is create the illusion of an alliance while we plot against each other in secret. A repeat of the past; coexistence without cooperation.<br>
Just talking at the negotiating table won't solve anything.<br>
We need to create some sort of opportunity if we want to actually break this deadlock...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Memphis：</span><br>
An opportunity, eh... How about this?<br>
<br>
Memphis sends a document over to my device.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
...Hm?<br>
A review of the near-superimposition event and a status report on the Tribunal's fleet?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Memphis：</span><br>
Yup. I discovered some unusual things while I was reviewing the aftermath of the battle.<br>
It might give you a deeper understanding of why Sardegna and the Orthodoxy have suddenly become close allies.<br>
Maybe it'll even be the opportunity you need. I hope so, anyway.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Interesting... If this is true, I'll need some time to digest all this information.<br>
But first, we should head to the banquet hall.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Memphis：</span><br>
Right. I've been told the Sardegnians put the most effort into tonight's dinner party.<br>
Let's go!<br>

{{折叠面板|标题=Help from Off the Grid|选项=4|主框=1|样式=primary|展开=是}}
<br>
Somewhere, in an unknown location...<br>
A galaxy of glimmering silver lights expands before my eyes.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
(I was in my bed, dozing off just a moment ago...)<br>
(I must be dreaming, then. Or maybe I'M not dreaming... It could be Shinano's, or someone else's dream.)<br>
(Or... it could be a vision created by that conceptual weapon. The black sun...)<br>
<span style="color:#ffc960;">Helena META：</span><br>
It's not that. It's both your dream and someone else's.<br>
Good to see you again, Commander.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Helena? Or should I say, Helena META.<br>
<span style="color:#ffc960;">Helena META：</span><br>
Mhm. Your Helena.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
I never got to thank you earlier. Thank you for all your help in the Mediterranean.<br>
<span style="color:#ffc960;">Helena META：</span><br>
I only did what had to be done, but you're welcome.<br>
I have to say, you're surprisingly calm for someone who's been mind-jacked.<br>
Most people tend to... freak out, I suppose.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Well, it's not my first rodeo.<br>
Besides, I know you're not here to hurt me. I don't have any reason to freak out.<br>
<span style="color:#ffc960;">Helena META：</span><br>
That's true. I would never hurt you.<br>
...Let's cut to the chase.<br>
You wouldn't know about it, but there's a fierce battle taking place somewhere extremely close to you.<br>
You don't need to know who or what the battle is about, but I will say that it's forced me to use this roundabout way of contacting you.<br>
It's for your own safety. If I could, I would've simply called you.<br>
Methods aside... I have something to tell you, Commander.<br>
Initiate data transfer mode. Execute.<br>
<br>
A blue light glows around Helena before splitting up into rays, forming a cloudy stream that rushes toward me.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
What's happening?!<br>
<span style="color:#ffc960;">Helena META：</span><br>
It's safe, don't worry. Just think of it as an unusual data transfer procedure.<br>
Don't try to fight it. Let it happen.<br>
You simply must know what I'm about to show you.<br>
<br>
The blue light obstructs my vision completely...<br>
Then, a picture suddenly forms inside my mind.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
A crystal with extraordinary properties has been discovered in Antarctica. It may lead to a breakthrough in the development of rigging technology.<br>
In light of this news, Naval HQ sent out a fleet that is currently on its way there.<br>
The group is under the command of Saratoga...<br>
And the operation's name is... Frozen Angel.<br>
<span style="color:#ffc960;">Helena META：</span><br>
Saratoga couldn't help herself.<br>
She always gets passionate about anything that involves Lexington.<br>
What will you do with this knowledge, Commander?<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Naval HQ does have the power to dispatch a force. It's not wise to openly object to their command.<br>
But, it doesn't sit right with me that they sent Saratoga's team of all people.<br>
I'm not concerned with whether this new crystal is real or not.<br>
What I am concerned with is the timing. It can't be a coincidence that this happened at a time when leaders from all factions, and myself, are gathered here in the Orthodoxy.<br>
It just stinks of Siren involvement.<br>
If Naval HQ gets their hands on this and uses it to stage another Reenactment, we can say goodbye to any hope of reforming the Azur Lane.<br>
<span style="color:#ffc960;">Helena META：</span><br>
Fair analysis.<br>
If reforming the Azur Lane is your goal, then I can help with that.<br>
What happens next is up to you, though. My goal here was just to pass on this information.<br>
The battle that's unfolding now will determine the fate of test site beta. That's your branch, Commander.<br>
If you have any plans, you should put them in motion sooner rather than later.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
...The situation is very dire, in other words.<br>
<span style="color:#ffc960;">Helena META：</span><br>
Yes. It really is.<br>
Good night, Commander. Sweet dreams for the rest of the night.<br>
{{折叠面板|内容结束}}

{{折叠面板|标题=Covenant|选项=5|主框=1|样式=primary|展开=是}}
<br>
The next day, outside the Azur Lane's provisional base...<br>
I look up at the bright morning sun. A yawn escapes my mouth.<br>
I didn't get much sleep last night. I couldn't stop thinking about what Helena showed me.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Thank god that today is a break day...<br>
"Sweet dreams for the rest of the night"... Yeah, right.<br>
Who knows what that "battle" was about... No matter. I've figured out what I'm going to do.<br>
Time to get moving.<br>
<br>
Iris Orthodoxy - Holy Capital<br>
The Tribunal's Headquarters<br>
Unknown Location<br>
I'm escorted into the underground headquarters of the shadowy organization behind the reunion of the Iris Orthodoxy – the Tribunal.<br>
I find myself inside a reception hall that's absent from any visitor's guide I've seen.<br>
<span style="color:#fef15e;">Clemenceau：</span><br>
Well, hello, Commander. Welcome to the Tribunal's headquarters. What brings you here today?<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
I think you already know what, Clemenceau.<br>
You wouldn't have let them escort me here otherwise.<br>
<span style="color:#fef15e;">Clemenceau：</span><br>
Good heavens, no. I would never be presumptuous as to try to predict your intentions.<br>
For better or for worse, there are countless eyes watching your every action. If something were to happen to you on my watch, I would never be able to explain that to the others.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
We're no strangers at this point. Let's cut to the chase–<br>
First and foremost, allow me to say that I harbor no suspicions against the Tribunal and have full faith in your competency.<br>
What I want to discuss... is what your fleet did after the near-imposition incident.<br>
<span style="color:#fef15e;">Clemenceau：</span><br>
Heehee. I see Memphis has been sniffing around again. Though, I must say that her abilities are matched only by her imagination.<br>
The Tribunal was simply making it seem as though we were supporting Marco Polo whilst she was under the Arbiter's influence.<br>
To put it simply, it was all an act.<br>
Hardly anything worth your time and consideration, heehee.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
The fact remains that your actions are indeed suspicious. But, I'm the only one who has read Memphis' report, and do not plan to share that knowledge with others.<br>
I have no intentions on threatening you or the Tribunal...<br>
But in exchange, I'd like you to do two favors for me.<br>
<span style="color:#fef15e;">Clemenceau：</span><br>
......<br>
...On that day at the World Expo, you chose to believe in us.<br>
Of course, I'm willing to place my trust in you. You may go see her.<br>
That's the first thing you want, I presume. What's the second?<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
To relay a message to Iron Blood and the Northern Parliament.<br>
Keep it anonymous and just say it's from a credible source. You know what to do.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Clemenceau：</span><br>
Hm? Sounds like you're planning something quite interesting.<br>
Haha, I'll pass on the message. Know that you won't be disappointed by the Tribunal's "work ethic."<br>
But first... would you mind sharing some details on what you plan to do?<br>

<br>
Iris Orthodoxy - Holy Capital<br>
Northern Parliament Embassy<br>
Three days after the conference<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Sovetsky Soyuz：</span><br>
Pamiat', Avrora, thank you for your work at the conference.<br>
I've heard about the results, and they're what I expected. Don't feel anxious about them.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Pamiat' Merkuria：</span><br>
Meh, I had a feeling the talks wouldn't go anywhere.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Avrora：</span><br>
They want to reform the Azur Lane through diplomacy... While it's a nice idea, it's just too sudden.<br>
We can't set aside our ideological differences just like that, even with the Commander orchestrating things.<br>
Then there's Naval HQ's role in the matter...<br>
Even supposing all factions agree to a temporary pact, there's still no guarantee that true unity will bloom from it.<br>
It will just be a repeat of the past, with us fragmenting once again.<br>
If anything, we should thoroughly destroy the current order and–<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Sovetsky Soyuz：</span><br>
Avrora, be careful what you say. Though we are on the Tribunal's encrypted channel, we do not know if someone is listening in.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Avrora：</span><br>
Oh...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Pamiat' Merkuria：</span><br>
Ahem...<br>
You know, it's really nice how the Orthodoxy paid part of this AND provided a venue!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Sovetsky Soyuz：</span><br>
It's convenient for us, yes, but "nice" isn't the word I'd use.<br>
Since the Vichya Dominion and Iris Libre have reunited, the question of the Iris Orthodoxy's return to the Azur Lane has become front-and-center.<br>
If they're left on their own, they're likely to become prime targets for exploitation.<br>
The Cardinal is surely aware of this, and so she "nicely" sprung into action to petition Comrade Commander for help.<br>
Therefore, by establishing this conference, they'll at least be able to protect their homeland.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Pamiat' Merkuria：</span><br>
What about Sardegna, then? They don't really expect one conference to resolve everything, do they?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Sovetsky Soyuz：</span><br>
...Knowing them, maybe they do.<br>
Perhaps they are also trying to regain the honor that the near-superimposition event cost them.<br>
I think we've spoken enough for now. Pamiat', Avrora, keep up your work at the conference.<br>
Though I don't expect anything to come out of this, we should let them have their moment of glory.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Avrora：</span><br>
Of course. Leave it to us.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Sovetsky Soyuz：</span><br>
Before I go, there's one thing I want you to bear in mind.<br>
Kronshtadt has informed me that the frequency of the term "Antarctica" has risen drastically in the Tribunal's transmissions.<br>
One possibility is that one of the Orthodoxy's Basilicas lie there, but another is that Iron Blood has found something and told the Tribunal about it.<br>
I have already tasked a team to investigate further. In the meantime, I ask the two of you to keep an eye on the other factions at the conference.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Avrora：</span><br>
Antarctica... Understood. We'll look into it as well.<br>

<br>
Pacific Ocean - Iron Blood Floating Fortress<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Bismarck Zwei：</span><br>
Antarctica again, you say?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Peter Strasser：</span><br>
Yes. We've picked up Observer's trail.<br>
Our investigation led us to conclude her mainframe is somewhere in the South Atlantic, the Central Pacific, the Southern Ocean, or the Mediterranean.<br>
Having said that, it's been long since she last showed herself.<br>
She has almost never directly engaged us in combat before, so our intel on her is severely lacking.<br>
But, judging by her disposition, she's most likely hiding in an unexplored location that connects to another ocean.<br>
If we narrow our scope down using those constraints, we're left with the Southern Ocean.<br>
Also, if I may ask – why did you say, Antarctica "again"?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Bismarck Zwei：</span><br>
I've come across some odd intel about it.<br>
The Eagle Union and the Northern Parliament have been talking about Naval HQ doing something there. The Tribunal's intel network picked up on it.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Peter Strasser：</span><br>
Are they searching for Observer's mainframe? No, wait, Naval HQ wouldn't be doing that...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Bismarck Zwei：</span><br>
Exactly. We can rule that out.<br>
I asked some people stationed nearby to investigate, and not long after, an unusual thawing phenomenon was observed in an Antarctic mountain range.<br>
It seems they've discovered "extraordinary crystals."<br>
When they analyzed the sample they collected, they found out that these crystals seem to resonate with riggings.<br>
They say it's capable of drastically improving a rigging's power output and combat performance.<br>
After that... I lost contact with them.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Peter Strasser：</span><br>
Wait, they stopped responding to you?<br>
I could see why the Eagle Union and the Northern Parliament would also want to get their hands on the crystals, but I can't see them attacking us for it.<br>
There are no Reenactments going on in that region either, for that matter.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Bismarck Zwei：</span><br>
I agree. It doesn't make sense to sour our relationship at the same time as the Commander is calling for all factions to reform the Azur Lane.<br>
That leaves only Naval HQ... or the Sirens. We should probably approach this as a conspiracy orchestrated by Observer.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Peter Strasser：</span><br>
It can't be a coincidence. Everything lines up too well. I certainly wouldn't put this past the Sirens.<br>
If this really is a trap to protect her mainframe, then our fleet is not the only one at risk. The Eagle Union's and the Northern Parliament's are, too.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Bismarck Zwei：</span><br>
Precisely. I want you to form a fleet and head to our Antarctic research base at once.<br>
You'll have to improvise according to the situation.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Peter Strasser：</span><br>
Got it.<br>

<br>
Old-fashioned armillary spheres, expensive astronomical telescopes, star maps drawn with pen and paper, and holographic projections of the night sky.<br>
A vast range of implements, and furnishings that produce an atmosphere that is anachronistic and at the same time not.<br>
The feeling was like opening the doors to a classical museum and being greeted by a curator dressed as a pop fashion model.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Yat Sen：</span><br>
I'm always impressed by how unique this place is.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Huan Ch'ang：</span><br>
Thanks for the compliment. Have some tea. Now, what brings you here today?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Yat Sen：</span><br>
I've come to ask about the recent happenings.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Huan Ch'ang：</span><br>
What do you mean by "recent happenings"?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Yat Sen：</span><br>
Things across the world.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Huan Ch'ang：</span><br>
Very well... Tomorrow will be sunny, not a single cloud in the sky. No winds.<br>
A beautiful day. Perfect for a walk, or drying your clothes.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Yat Sen：</span><br>
That's actually useful information. Thank you.<br>
It's been a while since you stayed at the observatory. Shall I air out your bedsheets?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Huan Ch'ang：</span><br>
No need. It's already been aired out. I don't plan to go back for a while, anyway.<br>
Ah, would you look at that... This is a record of solar activity over the past six months.<br>
It's crude, but still.<br>
<br>
Huan Ch'ang takes the note covered in dense writing and shows it to Yat Sen.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Yat Sen：</span><br>
Interesting... The sun's activity is increasing.<br>
It's also been six months since the storm that covers the Empery's coast started weakening. Do you think these two phenomena are connected?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Huan Ch'ang：</span><br>
No, there's no evidence of that. However, the spike in solar activity has aided in our analysis of the storm.<br>
Soon, our fleet will be able to break through it.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Yat Sen：</span><br>
Then, finally, we'll be able to use our sea lanes again.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Huan Ch'ang：</span><br>
At long last. Chen Hai's group had to take a terrible route to reach the World Expo. No more of that.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Yat Sen：</span><br>
On that note... Why DID Chen Hai do what she did back then? What do you think?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Huan Ch'ang：</span><br>
The same as you.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Yat Sen：</span><br>
But I haven't said what I think.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Huan Ch'ang：</span><br>
I already know.<br>
Misfortunes hinge upon fortune, and among fortunes is where misfortunes lie. No one knows the limit of either.<br>
Fortune and misfortune come in turns. Isn't that right?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Yat Sen：</span><br>
Yes. That is true.<br>
<br>
Yat Sen takes the note and stands up. She turns around and starts to leave the observatory's hall.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Huan Ch'ang：</span><br>
Leaving so soon?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Yat Sen：</span><br>
Yes. I have a briefing, you see. Was there anything else?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Huan Ch'ang：</span><br>
I divined something last night. Want to hear it?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Yat Sen：</span><br>
...Tell me.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Huan Ch'ang：</span><br>
"The Azure Dragon is caught in thunder and fire. The Vermilion Bird falls from the heavens."<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Yat Sen：</span><br>
...I see. I'll start preparing once the briefing is over.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Huan Ch'ang：</span><br>
Alright. You may leave.<br>
<br>
Meanwhile, at a secret Tribunal base...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Trento：</span><br>
Cardinal... the dream has changed.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Clemenceau：</span><br>
Changed? In what way?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Trento：</span><br>
There was a Venus comb floating amidst glaciers, and it was singing...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Clemenceau：</span><br>
...The Commander is right. The being that's set on invading our branch hasn't given up yet.<br>
If it's related to what's happening in Antarctica, then I can only pray for our allies' survival.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Trento：</span><br>
So... what should I do?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Clemenceau：</span><br>
Do what you can. Then, all that's left is to wait and see.<br>
