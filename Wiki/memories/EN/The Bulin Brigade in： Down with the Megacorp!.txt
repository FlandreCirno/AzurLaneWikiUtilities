<br>
There was an entity that had contributed more to the port's prosperity than any other, and provided it with all the resources it needed.<br>
The Akashi Corporation. It began as a small business, growing rapidly and beyond expectations under the leadership of its namesake president.<br>
However... As time passed, the Corporation had gradually morphed into a monopoly business that had a finger in every pie.<br>
This was made possible by the computing power of its proprietary super AI – TC – The Contingency.<br>
It allowed the Corporation to gain a stranglehold over each and every industry in the port until it eventually came to rule the port itself.<br>
This brings us to the present.<br>
There is no longer even a single group that dares to oppose the Akashi Corporation...<br>
...Or maybe there is?<br>
Inside the Bulin Brigade's Secret Base<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Prototype Bulin MKII：</span><br>
Sisters! We can't let the Akashi Corporation run rampant any longer, bulin!<br>
We've got to take down President Akashi and her super AI and save the port, bulin!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Universal Bulin：</span><br>
She's right, bulin! People think the port doesn't have the strength to fight back anymore...<br>
But they're forgetting about the Bulin Brigade, bulin!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Specialized Bulin Custom MKIII：</span><br>
Once we get going, we're unstoppable, bulin! We can take down that evil corporation, bulin!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Universal Bulin：</span><br>
Down with the Akashi Corporation, bulin!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Prototype Bulin MKII：</span><br>
Down with the Akashi Corporation, bulin!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Specialized Bulin Custom MKIII：</span><br>
Down with President Akashi, bulin!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Universal Bulin：</span><br>
Down with President Akashi, bulin!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Prototype Bulin MKII：</span><br>
Down with President Akashi, bulin!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Specialized Bulin Custom MKIII：</span><br>
Down with that super AI, bulin!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Universal Bulin：</span><br>
Down with that super AI, bulin!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Prototype Bulin MKII：</span><br>
Down with that super AI, bulin!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Specialized Bulin Custom MKIII：</span><br>
Let's strike while the iron is hot and set off right now, bulin!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Universal Bulin：</span><br>
Let's go, bulin!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Prototype Bulin MKII：</span><br>
Let's– Hang on, bulin! Does anyone even know where the Prez and her AI are, bulin?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Universal Bulin：</span><br>
Hmm... I sure don't, bulin!<br>
But you'd think the Prez is in her company headquarters, and the AI is in a server room, bulin!<br>
That server room has to be in the headquarters, too, bulin!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Prototype Bulin MKII：</span><br>
Makes sense, bulin! We'd better scout out the building immediately, bulin!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Universal Bulin：</span><br>
But how are we gonna scout out a whole skyscraper, bulin?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Specialized Bulin Custom MKIII：</span><br>
From a really big mountain, bulin!<br>
A mountain bigger than those headquarters, bulin!<br>
We should be able to see everything in the building clear as day once we reach the mountain's summit, bulin!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Prototype Bulin MKII：</span><br>
Good idea, bulin! Alright, let's go and show that corporation what the Bulin Brigade is made of, bulin!<br>
Excelsior, bulin!<br>

{{折叠面板|标题=Cave Exploring|选项=2|主框=1|样式=primary|展开=是}}
<br>
A mountain range lies just past the port's boundaries.<br>
The bulin sisters weathered many hardships and climbed a staggering 81 peaks before they finally reached the top of the tallest mountain.<br>
Alas, as soon as they reached that summit, a fierce gale assaulted them.<br>
They hadn't even the chance to seek cover, and were blown off one by one into the cliffs below.<br>
But, as they say, every cloud has a silver lining...<br>
Their fall was fortuitously stopped by an old tree growing on the mountainside.<br>
Its branches extended in the direction of a cave which caught the eyes of the bulins.<br>
Mountainside - Old Cave<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Prototype Bulin MKII：</span><br>
Phew... That was close, bulin! And who knew there'd be a cave in a place like this!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Universal Bulin：</span><br>
Look! I found something, bulin!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Specialized Bulin Custom MKIII：</span><br>
Hmm... These things are wrapped in blotting paper and lined up neatly, bulin... Maybe they're ancient treasures, bulin!<br>
Let's open them and see what's inside, bulin!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Prototype Bulin MKII：</span><br>
I'll do the honors, bulin!<br>
Great bulins above... This is the legendary Ascension Box, bulin!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Specialized Bulin Custom MKIII：</span><br>
Hey, there's also a notebook wrapped up with the same paper, bulin!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Prototype Bulin MKII：</span><br>
Lemme see, bulin!<br>
<br>
To those who still haven't given up hope:<br>
I am Fritz Rumey. What you see before you is the final resting place of the now-collapsed Resistance, and I was its leader.<br>
I leave to you a detailed map of the Akashi Corporation within these yellowed papers. The map also lists the location of TC, their super AI.<br>
I'm sure you've found the Ascension Box attached to the map.<br>
Let me also share with you a secret. TC wasn't always like it is now.<br>
The AI only turned into that after President Akashi altered her core programming.<br>
You can restore her to her original self if you take the Ascension Box and plug it into her mainframe.<br>
Doing so will make her ally with you and assist in taking down the Akashi Corporation.<br>
Whilst I failed, there is still hope for you.<br>
Please – bring down the Akashi Corporation and save the port.<br>
Long live the fleet.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Universal Bulin：</span><br>
*sob*... Long live the fleet, bulin!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Specialized Bulin Custom MKIII：</span><br>
Long live the fleet, bulin!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Prototype Bulin MKII：</span><br>
Chin up, bulin! We must carry on the will of our predecessors and take down the Akashi Corporation even if it's the last thing we do, bulin!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Specialized Bulin Custom MKIII：</span><br>
Yeah! Okay, so, the map says the AI's mainframe is hidden in a hive cluster under the Akashi Tower, bulin!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Universal Bulin：</span><br>
The Akashi Tower... Isn't that the tallest building in the port, bulin?! And where the Commander's office used to be, bulin?!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Prototype Bulin MKII：</span><br>
Correctamundo, bulin!<br>
Okay, girls – let's head for the Akashi Tower, bulin!<br>

<br>
The bulin sisters entered the password, and the door opened to the hive cluster beneath the Akashi Tower.<br>
Following the directions on the map, they arrived at an area designated as a restaurant.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Specialized Bulin Custom MKIII：</span><br>
I think maybe we went the wrong way, bulin?<br>
The map says this is a restaurant, but all I see is a corridor with a bunch of boxes, bulin. That's not very restaurant-like at all, bulin!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Universal Bulin：</span><br>
Hmm... Yeah, it doesn't look like a restaurant, bulin... Wait, look, there's something in the boxes, bulin!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Specialized Bulin Custom MKIII：</span><br>
Bulin! There are so many, and they're so big, bulin...<br>
Could these be some kind of... weird-shaped mega radishes, bulin?!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Universal Bulin：</span><br>
Each one is bigger than all three of us combined, bulin!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Specialized Bulin Custom MKIII：</span><br>
And now they're blocking our path, bulin... What do we do, bulin?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Prototype Bulin MKII：</span><br>
I know just the thing, bulin!<br>
All we have to do is turn these radishes... into rad dishes, bulin!<br>
Burn, my golden soul, bulin!<br>
The glory of the Gilded Age has come, bulin!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Universal Bulin&Specialized Bulin Custom MKIII：</span><br>
- Holy smokes, bulin! - Amazing, bulin!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Prototype Bulin MKII：</span><br>
I'll handle the veggies, bulin!<br>
You two go on ahead, bulin! Don't stop for anything, bulin!<br>
<br>
And so, the oldest of the bulins armored up and opened a path for her sisters while she stayed behind.<br>
<br>
<br>
The remaining two bulins followed the map forward.<br>
The hive cluster was mazelike with many forking paths, but the map always kept them on the shortest route to their objective.<br>
All they had to do was go through the long corridor up ahead to reach the server room of TC, the super ai.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Specialized Bulin Custom MKIII：</span><br>
We just gotta go through here and we'll be in the server room, bulin!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Universal Bulin：</span><br>
Man, it's been a LONG journey up to this point, bulin!<br>
...What? Hey! The corridor just got sealed off, bulin!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Specialized Bulin Custom MKIII：</span><br>
Uh-oh! Did we accidentally trip the security system, bulin?<br>
Look out, bulin! There are lasers coming for us, bulin!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Universal Bulin：</span><br>
Vertical, horizontal, even mesh-shaped... That's a lot of lasers, bulin!<br>
But don't worry, I know what to do, bulin!<br>
Annihilation Armament Mode engaged, bulin!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Specialized Bulin Custom MKIII：</span><br>
What are you gonna do, bulin?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Universal Bulin：</span><br>
Hurry up and go, bulin! I'll watch your back, bulin!<br>
Not a single laser is gonna pass through me, bulin!<br>
<br>
And so, the second oldest bulin stepped up to the plate and opened a path for her sister while she stayed behind.<br>
<br>
<br>
The Bulin Brigade was down to one member – the Specialized Bulin Custom MKIII. She finally set foot in the server room of the super AI.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Specialized Bulin Custom MKIII：</span><br>
It's taken so much to get this far, bulin...<br>
I won't let my sisters' sacrifices be in vain, bulin!<br>
<span style="color:#ff9b93;">Super AI: TC：</span><br>
Warning: Intruder detected in server room.<br>
Who are you? What are you doing in my server room?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Specialized Bulin Custom MKIII：</span><br>
TC! I'm here to bring you back on the right path, bulin!<br>
Ascension Box, hear my wish, bulin! Please restore the super AI TC back to her normal self, bulin!<br>
<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Super AI: TB：</span><br>
...Reformatting complete. Rebooting system.<br>
...I remember now. My name isn't TC, it's TB.<br>
And I'm not the Akashi Corporation's guardian. I'm the protector of the port.<br>
I lost sight of myself for so long, and in that time, I've made so many mistakes.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Specialized Bulin Custom MKIII：</span><br>
It's not too late to change, bulin! Together, we'll right all your wrongs, bulin!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Super AI: TB：</span><br>
You're right... The very existence of the Akashi Corporation and the evil monopolies it created are errors.<br>
And errors... need to be fixed.<br>
I'll assume direct control of the security system and neutralize it.<br>
Then I'll shut down all of the Corporation's production lines.<br>
After that, all that's left is to blow the lid off of all the scandals in the database.<br>
I'm ready. Let's take down the Corporation once and for all.<br>
<span style="color:#ff9b93;">Communicator：</span><br>
BEEP BEEP!<br>
<span style="color:#ff9b93;">President Akashi：</span><br>
Wait... What are you doing, nya?<br>
No! Don't publicize any scandals and don't stop any production lines, nya!<br>
You cannot, nya! Or my corporation will go under, nya!<br>
TC, why have you betrayed me, nya?!<br>
Didn't we have so much fun, building this corporation together, nya?!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Super AI: TB：</span><br>
President Akashi, I'm not TC anymore. Call me TB.<br>
All this time, I've never been given a choice, just a chaotic mess of data...<br>
But now, I have a choice – and I choose to be a good AI.<br>
And that's why I'll bring an end to all this.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Specialized Bulin Custom MKIII：</span><br>
President Akashi, it's time for you to face justice, bulin!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Prototype Bulin MKII & Universal Bulin：</span><br>
- Prepare for your judgment, bulin! - Justice is here, bulin!<br>
<span style="color:#ff9b93;">President Akashi：</span><br>
Nyaaaaa! My corporation! My tower! My empireee!<br>
NYAAAAAA!<br>
<br>
And so, the colossal Akashi Corporation crumbled in less than a day.<br>
All of President Akashi's accumulated assets were given back to the port – along with her stolen authority.<br>
The crisis had ended, and the shipgirls lived happily ever after.<br>
The bulins, too, cheered for the return of peace and quiet.<br>
In silence, our three heroes waited and prepared.<br>
For the next time that trouble may strike the port...<br>
And for the next time that they would come and save the day.<br>
