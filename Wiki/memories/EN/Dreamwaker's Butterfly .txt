「The dreamwaker sees the light of the Dawning Ceremony...」<br>
「...Crimson-dyed intrigue. Otherworldly explosions. The house of faith, sundered by a charred blade.」<br>
「The dreamwaker sees her valiant comrades, stemming back the tides of chaos to complete the ceremony.」<br>
「At last, drifting within the vast sea between worlds, the dreamwaker stirs.」 <br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Shinano ：</span><br>
Long has this one watched the world from a distance, only now given an opportunity to touch it. But...<br>
Diffuse are the expectations of mankind, and frail is the crystallization of their beliefs.<br>
Such a thing should never have come to pass...<br>
Has the trajectory of fate been thrown into disarray... or is this its true alignment?<br>
But alas, these things are no longer important... What matter is not this one's body, but rather the future of the Sakura Empire.<br>
In this world, the Great Fox's tree withers, the Diadem burns, and the crimson shadow heralds the coming of destruction.<br>
And the realm of dreams... cracks before the harbinger of crimson and black.<br>
What this one sees is finality... the sign of an inevitable fate yet to come.<br>
But even the powerless... should at least try to save what is important to them...<br>
Even if the tides of calamity cannot be averted... should this one combine visions of the "truth" with her powers...<br>
No matter how small, how ephemeral, this fleeting sliver of a dream may be...<br>
If they are slowly pieced together, then surely...<br>

Diadem of Light<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Noshiro：</span><br>
No... I can't approve of this plan.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ryuuhou：</span><br>
But, this decision was made by the leadership. And besides, even Lady Shinano isn't opposed to it.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Shinano ：</span><br>
Indeed. ..Now that this one has awakened, it is only natural to attend to the affairs of the main island.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Noshiro：</span><br>
That isn't the issue. Lady Shinano just woke up from a deep slumber and isn't fully aware of everything that has happened in the outside world...<br>
Hurriedly setting sail in this state, while leaving us devoted retainers behind on the island... is simply incomprehensible.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Shinano ：</span><br>
Nay... This one has seen... Both the state of this world, and the internal affairs of the Sakura Empire.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ryuuhou：</span><br>
Besides, didn't the leadership specifically dispatch a fleet to escort Lady Shinano? I think you're worrying too much.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Suruga：</span><br>
Kii is the leader of the fleet. Despite her rather, uh... strong will, rest assured that her strength is first-class.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Noshiro：</span><br>
But, but... Forget it, I've made up my mind! This time, I'll accompany Lady Shinano.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Suruga：</span><br>
What?!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ryuuhou：</span><br>
...We'll have to request permission to change our deployment formation. I don't think there's going to be enough time for that.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Noshiro：</span><br>
If Lady Shinano gives us her blessings, we can act first and apologize later. Surely there won't be an issue with that!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Shinano ：</span><br>
...Nnh... Hmm... If you insist...<br>
This one shall accept your offer...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Noshiro：</span><br>
Thank you, Lady Shinano!<br>
<br>
(knock, knock)<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Kasumi：</span><br>
Lady Shinano, your escort fleet is approaching<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Shinano ：</span><br>
(Just then... I felt my consciousness slipping... Ugh...)<br>
Ryuuhou, Noshiro, Suruga, let us prepare to set sail...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">{namecode:175}&{namecode:179}：</span><br>
Understood!。<br>

<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Suzutsuki ：</span><br>
Just like the sun's rays, there are several islands surrounding the main island... This must be the Diadem of Light!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Kii：</span><br>
You'd think this place was pretty fancy judging from its name, but it's totally run down! How can Lady Shinano live in a dump like this...?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Kumano ：</span><br>
"The awakening of the mightiest carrier will be as the radiant sun breaking through the clouded skies, dispelling the darkness and leading the Sakura Empire into new glory."<br>
Why do they always have to put this weird poetic stuff onto our orders? Who the heck knows what this is trying to say?<br>
I guess, like, Shinano's supposed to be super badass and able to defeat any enemy?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Kii：</span><br>
Isn't that enough for ordinary people?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Kumano ：</span><br>
Meh, guess so.……<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Kii：</span><br>
Well, of course they'd intentionally leave it a bit vague. You really think they're gonna put "Protect Shinano at all costs because Watatsumi's about to be stolen" on it?<br>
After Nagato was attacked alone by the Sirens, we've all had to be more vigilant.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Suzutsuki ：</span><br>
This place is still scarred by the battle that occurred here... It would be best that Lady Shinano not remain here should the Siren attack again.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Kumano ：</span><br>
For sure! Besides, I'd love to see Shinano show off her powers back at the main island.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Kii：</span><br>
Yeah. It's better for us all around.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Suzutsuki ：</span><br>
Hm? Some ships are leaving port... Is that Lady Shinano? She's so gorgeous...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Kumano ：</span><br>
Woah, her presence is just as imposing as Musashi's. I can feel it from all the way out here...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Kii：</span><br>
What's Noshiro doing there? According to the plan, Lady Shinano was supposed to come alone.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Suzutsuki ：</span><br>
I also think it would be unwise to let Lady Shinano set sail alone... As such an important person, it's only natural that she'd have an attendant or two.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Kii：</span><br>
You have a point... In any case, I'm sure she has her reasons.<br>
All right, let's not keep them waiting. Everyone, let's pick up our pace!<br>

<br>
After joining up with Shinano, Kii's fleet left the Diadem of Light, making its way back towards the Sakura Empire's main island.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Shinano ：</span><br>
So this is the sensation of sailing through the present world's oceans...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Kumano ：</span><br>
Lady Shinano, this is your first time leaving the Diadem of Light, yeah? So, like, how's it feel having the wind and waves at your side?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Shinano ：</span><br>
It is a familiar one. Slightly different, but not by much...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Kumano ：</span><br>
Um... Yeah, by the way! Did you know that fortune-telling apps are all the rage these days?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Shinano ：</span><br>
...Fortune-telling? This one's dreams have already shown the future... And, um, what is an "app"...?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Kumano ：</span><br>
Aaahhhh, don't worry about it! Forget I asked!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Shinano ：</span><br>
...... Very well...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Kumano ：</span><br>
(......Damnit, did I bring up a sensitive topic? So much for my plan to lighten up the mood a bit...)<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Suzutsuki ：</span><br>
(It's probably fine... Lady Shinano has been asleep for such a long time, she probably has no idea about the latest trends...)<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Noshiro：</span><br>
(What'd you expect? Though she's in this state, Lady Shinano is still the third ship of the Yamato-class and has the weighty duty of leading the Sakura Empire into the future.)<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Kii：</span><br>
(I used to feel the same way about Lady Nagato, but she has a cutesy side to her in private. I wonder if Lady Shinano also...)<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Suzutsuki ：</span><br>
(I can picture that... Can you imagine floofing those big, fluffy tails... Haah...)<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Shinano ：</span><br>
Suzutsuki, do you wish to rest upon this one's tail...?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Suzutsuki ：</span><br>
Eh?! Did she read my mind? Wha- No, I mean... C-can I really?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Kii：</span><br>
Pfft. Look at you...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Suzutsuki ：</span><br>
Ahh, umm... I really shouldn't! I apologize for my indiscretion...!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Shinano ：</span><br>
No? That's too bad... then... Nnh......<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Kii：</span><br>
(I've heard the rumors, but Shinano really does seem to be awfully sleepy...)<br>
Lady Shinano, should you have no objections, I would recommend you rest upon one of my mass-produced ships. We're not far from the Sakura Empire's main island, and there should be little risk of encountering Sirens.<br>
Of course, if anyone seeks to block our way, I shall see to it that they do not live to tell the tale.<br>

<span style="color:#4eb24e;">{namecode:182}：</span><br>
(Did I... fall asleep...?) "Others... approach..."<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">{namecode:80}：</span><br>
Lady Shinano, is your perception so keen even when you're asleep? Indeed, there's another Sakura Empire fleet in front of us.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">{namecode:27}：</span><br>
Let me confirm! It seems to be the munition ship, Kashino, being escorted back to the main island by Chitose and Chiyoda's group.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">{namecode:182}：</span><br>
"Munition ship... Kashino..."<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">{namecode:80}：</span><br>
Hmm... I don't remember hearing anything about a transport operation. It's unusual that a munition ship would be sailing with a sortieing fleet.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">{namecode:60}：</span><br>
I wonder what she's carrying with her!<br>
Kashino's been in charge of carrying stuff for Yamato-class guns, right? I know there weren't any Yamato-class ships planned after Lady Shinano, but do you think that...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">{namecode:27}：</span><br>
Curiosity kills the cat, Kumano. Weren't you specifically prohibited from talking about this stuff?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">{namecode:50}：</span><br>
Suzutsuki is right. It seems that Zuikaku and Shoukaku learned something that put them at odds with Akagi. I remember how thick the tension was between them at the last festival...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">{namecode:60}：</span><br>
Spooky, spooky... Guess I really should leave this stuff alone~<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">{namecode:50}：</span><br>
But, at least we're headed in the same direction. If we work together, we'll all be safer along the way.<br>
Will you order them to join us, Lady Shinano?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Shinano ：</span><br>
(Does such a weakly individual as myself truly deserve to be surrounded by so many retainers...?)<br>
"...They have a much more important duty to accomplish than escorting one such as myself."<br>
"It would be best to not force the convergence of different commands."<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Kumano ：</span><br>
Yeah, exactly! ...Hey, Suzutsuki, the heck is she talking about...?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Suzutsuki ：</span><br>
I think she's trying to say that because our missions are different, there's no need for them to accompany us.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Kumano ：</span><br>
So, we're gonna pass each other by then?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Suzutsuki ：</span><br>
Kii, we're receiving an incoming communication from the other fleet. Will you respond?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Kii：</span><br>
Sure, put me through. Even if we're not working together, we at least shouldn't forget common courtesy on the high seas as fellow members of the Sakura Empire.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Chitose：</span><br>
This is Chitose. We are currently carrying out a transport mission to the main island. It's a pleasure to see you.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Kii：</span><br>
This is Kii, also currently on the back to the main island. We appreciate your hard work in escorting our transport ships.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Hanazuki：</span><br>
There's an aircraft carrier among their formation... Eh?! Is that Lady Shinano?!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Chiyoda：</span><br>
Woahh! How lucky, are we witnessing Lady Shinano's maiden voyage?!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Shinano ：</span><br>
"Long has it been since we last met... It is good to see you all..."<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Chiyoda：</span><br>
Since we last...? Have we met before, Lady Shinano?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Shinano ：</span><br>
"Nay, those events... were not of this world... This would be our first meeting."<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Kashino：</span><br>
Hehe, this would be my first time seeing you awake! Pleased to meet you, Lady Shinano. I am Kashino, munition ship, currently carrying out a transport mission.<br>
By the way, I heard you just awakened not long ago? Do you feel alright? Is there anything you're having trouble with?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Shinano ：</span><br>
"Just now... This one felt a flicker of strength from within... Kashino, thank you for your contribution to this one's rebirth."<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Kashino：</span><br>
Hehe~ It's all part of my job. No need to thank me.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Chitose：</span><br>
In any case, Lady Shinano, we won't delay you any further. It is an honor to meet you, and I hope that the rest of your journey is smooth.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Shinano ：</span><br>
Mm... May the gods watch over you and ferry you safely to your destination.<br>

<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Kii：</span><br>
...Watch out, everyone. I see enemies!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Noshiro：</span><br>
That sudden disturbance... We've already entered a Mirror Sea.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Kumano ：</span><br>
How can that be?! It's been ages since Sirens have entered these waters, and besides, Chiyoda and Chitose passed through a moment ago without any issues!!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Suzutsuki ：</span><br>
By the looks of things, were they waiting for us... We've been ambushed!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Kii：</span><br>
The Sirens must be after... Lady Shinano, the Sirens will surely be targeting you! Please do not leave my side!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Shinano ：</span><br>
"...Very well. This one shall do whatever she can."<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Noshiro：</span><br>
Those bastards! They're trying to take advantage of Lady Shinano when she's most vulnerable...!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Kii：</span><br>
Don't let their little plan succeed. Enter battle formation around Lady Shinano and prepare to engage!<br>

<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Suzutsuki ：</span><br>
Be careful! A huge enemy fleet is appearing in front of us!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Kumano ：</span><br>
Damnit, there are "huge fleets" coming at us any direction you look!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Suzutsuki ：</span><br>
No, I mean, this one's even bigger than the rest! I'm also picking up their leader here, and it seems to be Tester!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Kii：</span><br>
You managed to locate Tester? Good work.<br>
But damn... we're not exactly in the best condition to take a head-on fight against Tester in a Mirror Sea...<br>
First and foremost, defend Lady Shinano with your life, and try to find a way out of here!<br>
{{折叠面板|内容结束}}

{{折叠面板|标题=First Transformation - IV|选项=8|主框=1|样式=primary|展开=是}}
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Noshiro：</span><br>
Things aren't looking good...! Kii, let me break out of the Mirror Sea alone. Chitose's fleet can't have gone far! I'll find them and have them turn back!<br>
We're also not far from the Diadem of Light. If you can send out an SOS signal, the fleet there can also come to our aid!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Kii：</span><br>
No! There's too many of them! You won't be able to make it out alone!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Suzutsuki ：</span><br>
Besides, we haven't located the way out yet. Even if you can stave off the enemies for a while, how are you going to get back to us?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Noshiro：</span><br>
But...!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Kii：</span><br>
They haven't made their move yet, but based upon their numbers, Tester doesn't plan to let us leave without a fight.<br>
We only have one option. We're going to have to focus all our attacks on a single point! If we can break Tester's command module, we'll be able to create an opening to get out of here!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Suzutsuki ：</span><br>
Going straight for the jugular, huh? Hmm... If it's just Tester, we might be able to pull it off with our numbers... But throw in some escorts, and we've got a problem on our hands.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Shinano ：</span><br>
"Focus on the escort fleet...... This one... shall take care of Tester."<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Suzutsuki ：</span><br>
Wait, but, Lady Shinano... Your powers haven't come back yet...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Shinano ：</span><br>
"...Worry not. This one has her own methods."<br>
(Many times has this one fought them within the Nightmare. Even in this state... victory is possible...)<br>
(Through all those sad and cruel dreams... To protect the Sakura Empire, to bring glory and hope to her people... has always been the unyielding purpose of this one's life.)<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Kii：</span><br>
...I understand. Fight to your heart's content then, Lady Shinano. We shall clear the way forward for you!<br>

<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Shinano ：</span><br>
"Why... This body should be capable of so much more...!"<br>
<span style="color:#ec5d53;">Tester：</span><br>
How dull... Is this really all that the mighty "Shinano" is capable of?<br>
Converted Yamato-class hull, armored aircraft carrier Shinano. You were built to represent the hope of the Sakura Empire, but your actual performance...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Shinano ：</span><br>
"Tester... This one has faced you countless times..."<br>
<span style="color:#ec5d53;">Tester：</span><br>
Is that so? That was supposed to be my line.<br>
Real experiments require reliable data, rigorous modeling, and a large amount of calculations. What you rely upon is nothing but a fantasy.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Kii：</span><br>
Lady Shinano, you're overextending! Get back into formation, quickly!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Shinano ：</span><br>
(Nay... This is the correct way. Only this way will Tester let her guard down and reveal her vulnerability!)<br>
<span style="color:#ec5d53;">Tester：</span><br>
Hm? Is this what you're aiming for?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Suzutsuki ：</span><br>
I've confirmed that Tester's main battery has been damaged, and her attack frequency has decreased!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Shinano ：</span><br>
(Next, the energy supply module... If I remember properly...)<br>
<br>
KABOOM——!!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Shinano ：</span><br>
(Submarines?! Impossible... When did they... Where...)<br>
<span style="color:#ec5d53;">Tester：</span><br>
Reenactment concluded. I'm glad you came here, Shinano, but know this. Your actions alone will never change the fate of the Sakura Empire.<br>
...Data entry complete. And upon this timeline... nothing will change.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">{namecode:182}：</span><br>
(What... It can't be... I...)<br>
(I saw the dreams many times... what was going to happen... I had awoken...)<br>
(How could this life amount to so little...)<br>
(This fate... is too cruel.........)<br>

<br>
Her eyes opened, and a familiar scenery spread out before her. Upon the ceremonial site of the Diadem of Light she stood.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Shinano ：</span><br>
"My head hurts... Was that... a dream...?"<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Kasumi：</span><br>
Lady Shinano...?! You're finally awake!!!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Shinano ：</span><br>
(...Did I not awake long ago? What is there to be so surprised... about...)<br>
"Kasumi, what date is it?"<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Kasumi：</span><br>
Ah, um... We're currently in the middle of the ritual, and Watatsumi is about to be brought forth...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Shinano ：</span><br>
"The ritual... That means that Nagato, Mikasa, and Akagi are all here...?"<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Kasumi：</span><br>
Um... Lady Nagato does not seem to be here... Um, yes, Foo said the same thing.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Shinano ：</span><br>
(That... can't be right, can it...?)<br>
<br>
——KABOOM!!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Kasumi：</span><br>
Watch out, Lady Shinano!!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Shinano ：</span><br>
(...An airstrike? Isn't the ceremony still in progress?)<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Kasumi：</span><br>
Ah, um! Lady Shinano, I was so excited to see that you had awakened that... Um, I forgot to explain...<br>
Um, so, the Sirens covered the entire island with a Mirror Sea and has been launching attacks at us. We've been caught completely off guard.<br>
But... Lady Akagi and Mikasa should have taken care of all the enemies, so... where did that attack come from...?<br>
It's still too dangerous to go outside, though. Foo said that it's better to wait here until we can get a battle report... Um, Lady Shinano?!<br>

<br>
In the night, gossamer sheets of blue silk fluttered towards the flames burning upon the ocean's surface.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Shinano ：</span><br>
(...They're going to take Watatsumi... No, their goal is to destroy it...)<br>
(...The one who goes by "Ember"...)<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Chiyoda：</span><br>
L-Lady Shinano?!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Shinano ：</span><br>
(Kashino... Chitose, and Chiyoda...? My dreams did not show them as being present at the ritual...)<br>
(Has reality began to bleed into the Dreamworld?)<br>
"What are you doing here?"<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Chitose：</span><br>
We originally came to deliver supplies for the ceremony, but we didn't expect to get attacked by Sirens before we left...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Chiyoda：</span><br>
Yeah, and just as soon as we managed to mop up the Sirens, a brand new enemy showed up!<br>
I have no idea if it's some new Siren weapon, but it looks different than anything we've faced before...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Chitose：</span><br>
The others are trying to hold them back, but enemies keep pouring at us...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Shinano ：</span><br>
"Will you return to lend them your aid...?"<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Kashino：</span><br>
Um, Lady Shinano, there appears to be some misunderstanding. We didn't retreat from the front lines.<br>
Mikasa surmised that the enemy's objective was to completely sever the ceremony by destroying Watatsumi, so we were ordered to take Watatsumi to a safe place.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Shinano ：</span><br>
(If Ember is interested in Watatsumi, the sacred relic of the Sakura Empire... then what is the nature of my existence...?)<br>
"...This one shall hold back the enemy. See to it that Watatsumi is kept safe."<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Kashino：</span><br>
Very well. Good luck, Lady Shinano.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Chitose：</span><br>
Huh? Lady Shinano herself is going to fight by herself...?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Chiyoda：</span><br>
Hehe, now we'll be able to turn the tides! Lady Shinano, show our enemies the power of the Sakura Empire's mightiest carrier~!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Shinano ：</span><br>
"...Very well."<br>

Damn it... Is this the best we can do...?!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ryuuhou：</span><br>
What the hell is this power...?!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Noshiro：</span><br>
I'm so sorry... Lady Shinano...<br>
<br>
Mass-produced battleships... sundered in but a single slash. Coastal installations, ruined in one shot. Destroyers, light cruisers, light carriers... Nothing could withstand even a single blow.<br>
This could not even be called a battle. Yet, the last, fragile line of defense still clung on.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Zuikaku：</span><br>
We can't even lay a finger on the enemy... Mikasa, we're going to get annihilated at this rate!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Mikasa：</span><br>
Hang on... just a bit longer! Shoukaku, has there been any response to our request for aid?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Shoukaku：</span><br>
The support fleet is on its way, but it'll take some time before they can reach us all the way out here!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Mikasa：</span><br>
Judging from our current situation, I hope it'll be enough... All we can do is continue to stall for time.<br>
Akagi, do you have any ideas?<br>
...Akagi?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Akagi：</span><br>
*cough*... Now you've done it... I'll have to use this!<br>
Behold, ye cruel gods... this is the power of my love! I shall bring ruin to everything!!<br>
<span style="color:#ff9900;">？？？：</span><br>
...Out of my way.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Kaga：</span><br>
Akagi! Watch out!!<br>

<br>
Immense powers collided, and the resultant burst of light engulfed both assailant and protector alike.<br>
Despite the assailant's tremendous power, she fell to her knees, and the battle was decided.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Akagi：</span><br>
Mi...kasa?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Mikasa：</span><br>
*cough* *cough*... Damn, I'm not as limber as I used to be...<br>
...Akagi?<br>
What's wrong—?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Akagi：</span><br>
... ... ...<br>
Aha... Ahaha.... AHAHAHAHAHAHAHA!!<br>
Even now, are you just going to watch us from the sidelines? Shinano!!<br>
<br>
Akagi turned around. Floating above her palm was a black box, glowing with a sinister light.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Akagi：</span><br>
The manifestation of humanity's dreams and hopes, the Wisdom Cube... But there are special ones among them.<br>
Instead of squandering such power on the likes of you...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Kaga：</span><br>
Akagi... What are you saying...?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Akagi：</span><br>
Even should this body sink to the bottom of the seas... or be forever wreathed in flames... I... I...<br>
I won't permit... anyone... to get in the way of my love!!<br>

<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Noshiro：</span><br>
Shinano, we're about to assemble.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Suzutsuki ：</span><br>
Woah, is that the entire fleet that's going to participate in this operation?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Kii：</span><br>
Yes, every last bit of the Sakura Empire's naval power. A might this world has never seen.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Chiyoda：</span><br>
But not just us. The Eagle Union, the Royal Navy, and the Iron Blood have all joined forces.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Suzutsuki ：</span><br>
The decisive battle is upon is... Hopefully it is enough to turn this situation around.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Kumano ：</span><br>
Yeah, that's what Lady Shinano foresaw in her dreams. Isn't that right?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Shinano ：</span><br>
"...Yes......"<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Kumano ：</span><br>
Hmm? What's the matter, Lady Shinano?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Suzutsuki ：</span><br>
Well, we've been fighting all the way here. It'd be weirder if she wasn't a bit tired after all that.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Kumano ：</span><br>
Yeah, don't worry 'bout it! Things will turn around after this battle, so let's give it one last push!<br>
Let's not keep the Eagle Union waiting!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Shinano ：</span><br>
"Your rigging is damaged... Can it not be repaired anymore...?"<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Kii：</span><br>
That's the way it is. We're out of materials, so there's nothing we can do about it.<br>
I've given it some elbow grease, but I'll just have to make do.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Shinano ：</span><br>
(...Their rigging is worn, weathered. As if they haven't been repaired for ages... Just what is going on...?)<br>

<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Chitose：</span><br>
Chiyoda, thank goodness you're safe... You should go resupply right now.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Kii：</span><br>
Supplies are finally here?! It's about damn time!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Suzutsuki ：</span><br>
Did the other fleets have to fight their way here like we did?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Chitose：</span><br>
Yeah, same situation all around. Just as our intel suggested, most of this area has fallen under the enemy's control.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Kumano ：</span><br>
Is that... our trump card over there?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Suzutsuki ：</span><br>
Equipment infused with the technology of the Northern Parliament. Those transport ships are carrying the special cores.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Shinano ：</span><br>
(The munition ships... are our trump card...?)<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Chiyoda：</span><br>
Pretty impressive, isn't it? But that's nothing compared to the secret weapon that Kashino brought us, powered by Watatsumi.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Chitose：</span><br>
If I remember properly, Lady Shinano was one of the architects behind this plan.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Shinano ：</span><br>
"...Indeed..."<br>
(A weapon...? Made from Watatsumi...?)<br>
(Wisdom cubes, the vessels that collect and shape thought... combined with cognitive chips to empower this body...)<br>
(What makes me... any different from that weapon?)<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Communicator：</span><br>

<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Enterprise：</span><br>
This is Enterprise. It's time to begin the operation. Is the Sakura Empire fleet ready?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Takao：</span><br>
We've finished assembling our forces. Now, we're just making some final adjustments to our equipment. How about on your end?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Shangri-La：</span><br>
Our task forces have been proceeding relatively smoothly. We haven't seen any enemy movements in the target area.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Jintsuu：</span><br>
Excellent. If our plan succeeds, we may be able to crush the enemy in one fell swoop.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Yuudachi：</span><br>
Let's hurry up and start already! I'm itching for a fight!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Kumano ：</span><br>
Hehe, Yuudachi's all fired up today. Guess I can't afford to fall behind either~<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Takao：</span><br>
Enterprise, are we missing anybody?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Enterprise：</span><br>
No, but Antiochus has not rallied their forces yet.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Takao：</span><br>
Strange. How unlike them to drop the ball at a time like this.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Victorious：</span><br>
In any case, they're just a reserve force. It should be fine as long as they can catch up later.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Kaga：</span><br>
Let's finalize our plans then. Shinano, you're in charge over here.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Shinano ：</span><br>
(Anti... ochus... Who...?)<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Noshiro：</span><br>
Ready to assist at any time.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Kaga：</span><br>
Good. Sakura Empire fleet, the operation begins now! Set sail!<br>

<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Kumano ：</span><br>
We haven't encountered a whole lot of enemies so far.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Kii：</span><br>
We're near the middle of the fleet formation. Even if enemies tried to approach us, the other squads will make quick work of them.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Suzutsuki ：</span><br>
...Don't get cocky. You never know when the enemy may strike, or where they'll attack from.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Kumano ：</span><br>
Duh. It's not like this is my first time fighting~<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Suzutsuki ：</span><br>
Mm... I'm a little nervous, but I'm sure we'll be fine!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Kii：</span><br>
Yeah. It's fine to be vigilant, but don't let your nerves get the better of you.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Hanazuki：</span><br>
Would you like some herbal tea? ...Unfortunately, there's not much of a selection left...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Kii：</span><br>
That'd be great! How about you, Lady Shinano?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Shinano ：</span><br>
"...Indeed. That sounds lovely..."<br>
<br>
Voices ring out across the water. They are all trying to drown out the sense of anxiety and urgency from the imminent decisive battle.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Takao：</span><br>
The enemy vanguard fleet is approaching.<br>
I've lost contact with several of the Eagle Union fleets. Trying to confirm the situation.<br>
Stay alert, and don't let your guard down.<br>

Do you feel that? It's giving me the chills... The enemy's main fleet will be coming soon.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Shinano ：</span><br>
"...A Mirror Sea..."<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Kii：</span><br>
What the heck is a Mirror-C?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Suzutsuki ：</span><br>
Is that what you're talking about? We occasionally spot strange weather phenomena right before these enemies appear.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Kumano ：</span><br>
Ohh, so that's what you mean by Mirror Sea, huh?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Shinano ：</span><br>
(...This "enemy"... Is it not the Sirens?)<br>
(Then... who is this "Antiochus?" Could it be...)<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Takao：</span><br>
Damn... I've completely lost contact with the Eagle Union fleet.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Kii：</span><br>
Shit... Forget about the Eagle Union, we're even losing contact with our own perimeter fleets one after another!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Shinano ：</span><br>
"...We still haven't even reached... the enemy's main fleet..."<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Jintsuu：</span><br>
Seems like it. We've been fighting off their recon forces, but their main fleet is still further ahead.<br>
But you'd never know it based upon how big these fleets are...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Shinano ：</span><br>
"...It's as if they're trying to burn us out..."<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Takao：</span><br>
...As long we keep things under control, we won't burn out.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Shinano ：</span><br>
"...Indeed. Those who burn out will become but embers and ash..."<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Takao：</span><br>
...No. We will not. Even if we burn out, we must continue to protect the light of humanity.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Kumano ：</span><br>
Takao...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Takao：</span><br>
Be it through the flames of my cannon or the light of hope, I shall illuminate the darkness! Even if I burn through my life, I refuse to become dying embers in the wind!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Shinano ：</span><br>
(Ember... and Ash...?)<br>
(...Could this dream be... of their creation...?)<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Takao：</span><br>

Pummelled by a hail of cannonfire, the steel colossus finally reels, staggered for the first time.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Shinano ：</span><br>
(I feel power coursing through me... At this rate, we can win...!)<br>
<br>
However, even if one enemy collapsed, another would swell from the depths to take its place, a veritable wall of black steel.<br>

(I am a weapon... the embodiment of humanity's thoughts, the wishes for which they fight.)<br>
(I am the hope of the Sakura Empire. The hope of her people. I am their deliverance.)<br>
<br>
But the flames of resistance flickered in the storm and sputtered out. Be it after mere moments or after eons, Shinano stood alone upon the surface of the ocean.<br>

Sure did! You must've been having a real pleasant dream. Wouldn't even have woken up if an enemy found us!<br>

"What time is it...?"<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">{namecode:128}：</span><br>
Around 0800. After detecting Union submarines, I changed our formation per your instructions.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Shinano ：</span><br>

(To be born from a Wisdom Cube... Yet there are those born into a world not cowering beneath the shadows of the Sirens...)<br>
(There has been reason to doubt the connection between the Sirens and the Wisdom Cubes... and the Wisdom Cubes may well be uninvolved in all of this...)<br>
(Perhaps... that connection was false to begin with...)<br>
(...But such a conclusion is premature... This may yet be another dream, or rather, a fragment of a world operated by the Sirens...)<br>
(...If that is the case, what do they seek to gain from hiding, simulating a world without their existence...? Hm...)<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Yukikaze：</span><br>
Behold the triumphant return of Yukikaze the Great!<br>
Are you still sleeping, Shinano?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Shinano ：</span><br>
"Nay... This one is awake."<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Yukikaze：</span><br>
I see... It's not just you though, everyone seems to be having a hard time staying awake...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Isokaze：</span><br>
Of course I'm getting sleepy, it's already 2200... Yukikaze, you're not tired?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Yukikaze：</span><br>
Wa ha ha! See, Yukikaze the Great is a grown-up, so there's no way she'd doze off like you guys!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">{namecode:128}：</span><br>
Even though you're always the first to crash... Anyway, any updates from the scouts?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Yukikaze：</span><br>
They haven't spotted any enemies in the three directions we sent them.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">{namecode:128}：</span><br>
Weird... I thought an Eagle Union submarine was chasing us... Did it give up? Let me check one more direction.<br>

——It's a trap. <br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Shinano ：</span><br>

Charge! Charge! Upon our honor, crush the Army of the West~♪<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">{namecode:128}：</span><br>
...I don't see any "Army of the West."<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Isokaze：</span><br>
Hmm, Lady Shinano? What's the matter? You slowed down all of a sudden...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Shinano ：</span><br>
"My movement... seems a bit sluggish... Even at full output..."<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">{namecode:128}：</span><br>
I knew it was a bad idea to push up the construction timetable...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Yukikaze：</span><br>
We're gonna be in trouble if Shinano can't outpace the submarines and they catch up to us!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">{namecode:128}：</span><br>
Just our luck...! I've detected their signals already!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Shinano ：</span><br>
"Is it... the same one you mentioned earlier...?"<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">{namecode:128}：</span><br>
Let's see... Actually, I can't even tell. We might already be surrounded...<br>
<br>
——Evade. Steer away from the submarines. <br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Shinano ：</span><br>
"All hands, turn hard to the southwest. Avoid the submarine ambush."<br>
(Is that not the voice I heard in the previous dream? What is going on...?)<br>

And that concludes class for this semester! Be careful during summer vacation, and remember to do your homework!<br>

Phew... Now that class is out, all that's left is today's drills, right?<br>

Um... If you're worried about Ms. Amazon chewing you out, why not leave Pooky in the dorms?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Suzutsuki ：</span><br>
Well, Pooky would be lonely then! I could ask Commander to help out, but that'd probably be a nuisance...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Hanazuki：</span><br>
I can take care of Pooky if you'd like? He seems to be fond of sunflower seeds.<br>

"Your unasked-for justification... only makes you more suspicious..."<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ark Royal：</span><br>
No, no! You see, with so many energetic destroyers frolicking about, it would be dangerous if they all started running around and bumping into one another! Therefore, it is my duty to watch over them!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Shinano ：</span><br>
(Sigh...)<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ark Royal：</span><br>
Makes sense, right? Besides, you look like you hit your head on the way here, so surely you would understand such dangers!<br>

Shinano arrived at a building that appeared to be a workshop.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Chitose：</span><br>
Lady Shinano? Did you come for repairs?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Shinano ：</span><br>
(This is... a repair facility...?)<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Chiyoda：</span><br>
If you're here for repairs, don't just stand there! Come on in, Chitose and I both came for the same reason!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Yuubari：</span><br>
Hmm... Need something from the Research Department?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Chitose：</span><br>
My aircraft elevator isn't working quite right. I have an exercise soon, so I'd like to get it taken care of before then.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Chiyoda：</span><br>
I'd like a little boost to my engine performance!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Yuubari：</span><br>
I don't really feel like taking on such uninteresting jobs, but... guess somebody's gotta do it.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Chiyoda：</span><br>
Sorry! Lady Shinano, once we finish up over here, it'll be your turn!。<br>
<br>
Chitose, Chiyoda, and Yuubari disappeared into the workshop.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Shinano ：</span><br>
(Akashi...? Didn't I see her with Kii and the others not too long ago...?)<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Akashi：</span><br>
Hm? Why are you looking at me like that, nya? I let the Manjuus take over back there. They don't need sophisticated orders to sell things for me, nya.<br>
But what brings you here, Shinano? Is something the matter, nya?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Shinano ：</span><br>
"......"<br>
(I'm in perfect condition... As if I've been completely reborn after the last "dream.")<br>
(But just in case... maybe I should get an inspection...)<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Akashi：</span><br>
Nya? Yes, no? Maybe so?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Shinano ：</span><br>
"Yes..."<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Akashi：</span><br>
That's what I want to hear, nya. It's not every day I get to work on a ship as important as you, so I'll see you for free, nya.<br>
I don't see anything wrong at all, nya. Purrfect condition, nya.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Shinano ：</span><br>
(I see... This is what I should have been... and this power...)<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Akashi：</span><br>
By the way, were you about to go see the Commander, nya? You see, I have this brochure for my new product, nya...<br>
Huh? Did Shinano just disappear into thin air, nya??<br>

<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Shinano ：</span><br>
(No titanic enemies... No threats... No conflicts...)<br>
(...and no Crimson Axis... Nay, this is a peaceful world in which even Azur Lane is rendered unnecessary...)<br>
(As Akashi said, the way I am in this world... is closest to the true "Shinano"...)<br>
(Alas, this is the "truth" that I sought... the future that avoids ruination... in which both humanity and the Sakura Empire find salvation...)<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">{namecode:182}：</span><br>
(At last, the final fragment that I sought...)<br>
<br>
Suddenly, the wind picked up, carrying a flurry of cherry blossoms that seemed to dye the entire landscape. Shinano turned her head, and saw... a girl who "should not have been."<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">{namecode:182}：</span><br>
(A...magi...? Everyone... Akagi... has wanted to see you so badly...)<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">{namecode:161}：</span><br>

<span style="color:#4eb24e;">{namecode:182}：</span><br>
(Why... am I...)<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">{namecode:161}：</span><br>
What's the matter? You look like you just saw a ghost... Or rather, as if you're about to cry, out of both sorrow and joy.<br>
The Shinano I know would never show such an expression. Ehehe~<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">{namecode:182}：</span><br>
(She's reading me...?)<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">{namecode:161}：</span><br>
The Shinano in front of me must surely be from a distant, distant place— *cough* *cough*...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">{namecode:182}：</span><br>
(......!)<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">{namecode:161}：</span><br>
Don't worry. It's just my chronic health condition... From your expression, I surmise that you've never met "me" before, right?<br>
...After all, the Shinano here already knows about my condition, and wouldn't act this worried. Hehe~<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">{namecode:182}：</span><br>
(............)<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">{namecode:161}：</span><br>
I don't know why you've come here, but I can see how long you've been bitterly fighting.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">{namecode:182}：</span><br>
(This... is just a dream... All I am here to do is to collect these fragments and seek the future...)<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">{namecode:161}：</span><br>
But don't worry. This dream is not yours alone.<br>
What matters most is not whether this is a dream or if it is reality— but that we are here, now, and able to experience happiness.<br>
After all, even if this is but a fleeting dream, you can turn it into reality should you desire it.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">{namecode:182}：</span><br>
(...Bringing the dreams that I see... into reality...?)<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">{namecode:161}：</span><br>
Indeed. As long as you wish it so, it shall be. The butterfly's dream is yours to behold.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">{namecode:182}：</span><br>
I.........<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">{namecode:161}：</span><br>
You look a bit worried. Hehe~<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">{namecode:182}：</span><br>
...Do I...?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">{namecode:161}：</span><br>
Come with me then. Surely what you're looking for lies ahead.<br>

I know we're not using live rounds, but even getting hit by practice rounds will still leave a bump...<br>

Nay... I was just thinking about... why there is still a need for us to fight in a peaceful world...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Amagi：</span><br>
......You are free to decide if you wish to fight or not.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Shinano ：</span><br>
Yes... However, the dream that I saw is different from the reality that I know... If this is only a "fragment" for me to collect, then the destination of this dream is also...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Amagi：</span><br>
I see. You're worried about us.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Shinano ：</span><br>
Azur Lane was once a single faction... But the world was torn asunder by the rise of the Crimson Axis. And though we have much in common...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Amagi：</span><br>
The two sides still had to fight, as enemies...<br>
Shinano, you believe that this is fate, beyond your ability to control despite your intentions.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Shinano ：</span><br>
...I only can peer into dreams. I have no ability to influence reality...<br>
How am I... to turn this dream into reality...?<br>
Amagi... can you tell me...?<br>

<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Kii：</span><br>
Yes... Back to the Sakura Empire, where we'll be joining up with Chitose, Chiyoda, and the transport fleet... Our home.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Shinano ：</span><br>
Fates converge, and journeys end. Let us return home at last...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Suzutsuki ：</span><br>
Huh? Oh, yeah!<br>

<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Chitose：</span><br>
I'm honored to have accompanied you on your voyage, Lady Shinano.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Chiyoda：</span><br>
Me too!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Shinano ：</span><br>
...I apologize for my lengthy slumber, and for holding everyone back...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Hanazuki：</span><br>
N-no, that's not true at all!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Shinano ：</span><br>
(There is a great power emanating from Kashino's cargo... Could it be...)<br>
Kashino, what are you carrying...?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Kashino：</span><br>
Mm, various supplies and packages for the Combined Fleet.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Shinano ：</span><br>
Did you receive this command from Akagi or Nagato...?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Kashino：</span><br>
Hm, I'm not too sure... I simply obeyed the order I received from the leadership. Did you hear anything from Kaga?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Shinano ：</span><br>
...Nay, I did not...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Chiyoda：</span><br>
(Was Shinano always the cautious type?)<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Suzutsuki ：</span><br>
(Who knows... She seems very gentle and easygoing, but she seems to also be the kind of person who keeps track of every little thing...)<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Kumano ：</span><br>
(Maybe she was preparing for the ritual the entire time she was sleeping, just as those threads were saying?)<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Noshiro：</span><br>
(There's no way that's true.)<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Kii：</span><br>
Chitose, I'll be joining the fleet at this time. I don't know what you're in charge of transporting, but I can only assume it's very valuable.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Chitose：</span><br>
The pleasure is mine. We shall also see to it that Lady Shinano is well-defended.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Chiyoda：</span><br>
Yay, now this fleet is nice and big! Of course, it sucks that I won't get to do as much, but I'll manage as long as Chitose is here~!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Shinano ：</span><br>
This... is where the Sirens' Mirror Sea began...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Chiyoda：</span><br>
Mirror Sea? Granted, they do tend to pop out of nowhere, but can your powers really predict where they're going to appear?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Noshiro：</span><br>
I don't see anything, but... Lady Shinano must've seen something in her dreams.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Kii：</span><br>
I'm not the type to act on a whim, but we can never be too careful when it comes to the Sirens. Lady Shinano, can I count on you to take charge of the fleet?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Amagi：</span><br>
...Believe in yourself, Shinano. I wish you the best of luck. May your future be blessed with happiness, o dreaming butterfly.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Shinano ：</span><br>
(...Give me the power to change this dream... Nay, this "Reenactment!")<br>

<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Kumano ：</span><br>
Woahhh... Not only did she predict that a Mirror Sea would appear here, she even knows where all the enemies are coming from...!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Suzutsuki ：</span><br>
I was wondering why we sent an entire fleet to bring her back to the main island...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Kashino：</span><br>
What a close call...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Shinano ：</span><br>
Nay, this power is still unstable... It may prove to be a hindrance to everyone should I rely on it too much... My apologies...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Chiyoda：</span><br>
Don't say that, Lady Shinano! Without your powers, we would've been ambushed and annihilated!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Chitose：</span><br>
It's crazy that the Sirens would be able to launch an attack this close to the main island. They really are aiming for both Lady Shinano and the cargo we have with us.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Shinano ：</span><br>
...Thank you for escorting me.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Kii：</span><br>
Even if we managed to foresee that attack, a transport fleet alone would not have been enough to fend off an enemy force of that size.<br>
Kashino's a hard worker, but protecting a slow-moving transport is a difficult job.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Shinano ：</span><br>
Soon... Tester's fleet will arrive.<br>
If we can take out her command module...<br>

<span style="color:#ec5d53;">Tester：</span><br>
Converted Yamato-class hull, armored aircraft carrier Shinano. You were built to represent the hope of the Sakura Empire, but your actual performance... is hardly worthy of even being considered data.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Shinano ：</span><br>
I will never be defeated by an enemy that I have seen in my dreams.<br>
<span style="color:#ec5d53;">Tester：</span><br>
...is significantly different from the calculated result. Interesting.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Shinano ：</span><br>
No calculations may encapsulate... what I have experienced...!<br>
<span style="color:#ec5d53;">Tester：</span><br>
(Something's wrong here. This difference in performance cannot fall within the realm of accounted-for factors. Normally, such a shift would be attributed to Cognitive Awakening, but she has not had a chance to come into contact with that "Commander.")<br>
I see. The Observation Terminal will be interested in you.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Shinano ：</span><br>
(...Observation Terminal? If that is something made up of Sirens just like Tester...)<br>
<span style="color:#ec5d53;">Tester：</span><br>
I have no desire to ape Purifier, but as the one who will pave the way for the Arbiters, I do wish to acquire data that can facilitate the Terminal's demise.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Shinano ：</span><br>
(...I don't have time to think about that right now though...)<br>
I won't retreat if it's a fight you want. After all—For the sake of my friends, the Sakura Empire, and the future of humanity...<br>
I shall fight until my soul's duty is fulfilled...!<br>

<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Shinano ：</span><br>
Suzutsuki, Hanazuki, watch out for the subs—<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">{namecode:27}&{namecode:29}：</span><br>
Yes, Lady Shinano!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Shinano ：</span><br>
Chitose, Chiyoda, please focus on maintaining air superiority—<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">{namecode:103}&{namecode:104}：</span><br>
Got it!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Shinano ：</span><br>
Everyone else, please stand by—<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Kumano ：</span><br>
Wooohooo!! ...Wait, stand by??<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Shinano ：</span><br>
Wait for Tester to turn around, and concentrate your attacks on her command module...!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Kii：</span><br>
Got it! Heh, being able to hunt down a strong enemy like this really feels awesome!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Shinano ：</span><br>
Everyone, lend me your powers once more...!<br>

<span style="color:#ec5d53;">Tester：</span><br>
Armor damaged, energy supply damaged. Critical error in the young program—<br>
Transmitting test data to the intermediate program. A phenomenon similar to but independent from Cognitive Awakening has been observed. Noting possibility of errors within the computation system.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Shinano ：</span><br>
(You've lost, Tester. Tell me about your kind, about "Antiochus." And tell me about what I saw at the end of that dream... those ships, and "Ember.")<br>
<span style="color:#ec5d53;">Tester：</span><br>
(I have nothing to tell you. Too bad.)<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Shinano ：</span><br>
(......)<br>
(...Very well. I shall find the answers myself then...)<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Suzutsuki ：</span><br>
We've eliminated the enemy general! Tester is retreating!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Kashino：</span><br>
The transport fleet has only suffered minor damage! Now, we can all go home!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Chiyoda：</span><br>
I wasn't even able to do much because Lady Shinano was so strong...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Shinano ：</span><br>
Phew... Only if it was just a single step... we've taken our first step towards overcoming fate...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Noshiro：</span><br>
(Shinano's power is overwhelming, even if it's hard to control. Why did they keep her under the Diadem of Light instead of back on the main island?)<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Kumano ：</span><br>
(Time to post to Juustagram! This is gonna go viral for sure!)<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Kii：</span><br>
Now, I'll have more to talk about when I'm out drinking with Ise. Ahh, too bad Suruga couldn't be here.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Shinano ：</span><br>
(............)<br>
(In the course of less than a day, I've made my way from the Diadem of Light, through countless dreams, to defeating the Sirens...)<br>
(Through all my dreams and the many futures I saw, my friends gave me the power to move forward... Alas, is this also part of my fate...?)<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Hanazuki：</span><br>
Lady Shinano, we're waiting for your orders.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Kii：</span><br>
Shinano, you are no longer our charge, someone to be escorted and protected. You are now one of our comrades-in-arms, standing with us on the field of battle.<br>
Let us hear your words! Bring us home, haha!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Shinano ：</span><br>
(Y-yes... It's about time...)<br>
(If the goal of the Sirens extends beyond me and the cargo Kashino carries, and the dream of ruination that I saw... then what must be changed is not a dream, but rather reality itself...)<br>
...Let us return home at last, to the Sakura Empire—<br>

<br>
Somewhere in the Sakura Empire's main island...<br>
<span style="color:#ec5d53;">Akagi：</span><br>
I know you're there, Observer.<br>
<span style="color:#ec5d53;">Observer：</span><br>
Hehe. How cautious of you if you're calling me to this place. Aren't you afraid of getting found out?<br>
<span style="color:#ec5d53;">Akagi：</span><br>
You knew it from the very beginning. The connection between Watatsumi and Shinano's powers.<br>
<span style="color:#ec5d53;">Observer：</span><br>
Is it my fault you never bothered to ask?<br>
Besides, what are you dissatisfied with? You got what you wanted from the Iron Blood, and Shinano woke up. I've been doing nothing but good here.<br>
<span style="color:#ec5d53;">Akagi：</span><br>
And, Shinano got ambushed by Tester immediately after waking up. If not for Kaga's warning—<br>
<span style="color:#ec5d53;">Observer：</span><br>
How sad. Do you have so little faith in your God?<br>
<span style="color:#ec5d53;">Akagi：</span><br>
You and your ilk are not gods. You whisper nothing but lies to those you seek to use.<br>
Don't make me repeat myself. Stop targeting Shinano with your petty experiments.<br>
And tell me the location of all the Mirror Seas around the Sakura Empire. This was all part of our original agreement.<br>
<span style="color:#ec5d53;">Observer：</span><br>
What a spoilsport. We just wanted to see how significantly an "unobservable" could break our calculations.<br>
In any case, I'll leave that child alone. Consider what happened with Tester... an unexpected system malfunction.<br>
...Oh my, it seems that I have a visitor. I'll be taking my leave then. Have a nice day, Akagi~<br>
<span style="color:#ec5d53;">Akagi：</span><br>
...Siren, I'll make you pay for stepping on the Sakura Empire as if it was your doormat...<br>
Don't expect this arrangement to last long... Once my plans come to fruition...<br>
{{折叠面板|内容结束}}

<span style="color:#ec5d53;">Purifier：</span><br>
Took you long enough, Observer. What's the matter, run into trouble~?<br>
<span style="color:#ec5d53;">Observer：</span><br>
Turn each observation spot, and all processing resources into sensors. She'll be here soon.<br>
3... 2... 1...<br>
Zero.<br>
<span style="color:#ec5d53;">Compiler：</span><br>
Indeed. I am here. Three objectives. Verification complete. Energy level recording complete.<br>
<span style="color:#ec5d53;">Observer：</span><br>
I guess it worked.<br>
<span style="color:#ec5d53;">Omitter：</span><br>
This is an Arbiter? She's a lot shabbier than what I imagined.<br>
<span style="color:#ec5d53;">Compiler：</span><br>
How would you like to die? Crushed by waves, or drowned by storms?<br>
<span style="color:#ec5d53;">Omitter：</span><br>
Woahh, why don't we put that menacing aura away? Real dangerous fella we've got here.<br>
<span style="color:#ec5d53;">Compiler：</span><br>
The primary points of interest are "Code G" and "Ember." Our purpose is to reduce confounding variables within the experiment site and to increase calculation accuracy. Avoid excess noise in the data.<br>
Observation is impossible without knowing the time and space due to delicate nature of energy fluctuations.<br>
<span style="color:#ec5d53;">Purifier：</span><br>
In other words, they won't be able to see our footprints even if we go back and forth on this timeline?<br>
Spooky.<br>
<span style="color:#ec5d53;">Tester：</span><br>
Arbiters function on a different program from ours, and "Zero" is on a lower-level program, so there's no need to share information among all of us.<br>
They are almost exclusively concerned with "Code G," which means they probably won't interfere with us.<br>
<span style="color:#ec5d53;">Purifier：</span><br>
Basically, we can let the Arbiters handle the crappy jobs, and run whatever experiments we'd like? Ahahaha!<br>
<span style="color:#ec5d53;">Observer：</span><br>
(Why does Zero prohibit observers from exchanging information across multiple timelines? ...After all, I'm sure Zero is investing a lot of resources here.)<br>
(More and more uncertainties appear in this timeline. And then, there is the "Commander.")<br>
(At long last... the Creator and Magister may get to see their vision come to fruition. Ahahaha!)<br>
