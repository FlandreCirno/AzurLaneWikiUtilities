Realm of the Neversetting Sun - Nile Governor-General's District<br>
Old Capital Palace<br>
The Nile Delta belt. A prosperous, wealthy, and peaceful region.<br>
In this place, the new capital of Cairo and the old capital of Memphis echoed each other, much like two different pearls on the same crown.<br>
In contrast to Cairo, which had undergone modernization, the rich cultural heritage of this land was still present everywhere in Memphis.<br>
Take for example the giant galley with a thousand-year history, still silently moored in its waters.<br>
At its bow, a golden winged lion sculpture was hoisted high, signifying the equally lofty standing of its owner.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">A Rose on the High Tower

<size=45>1 The Usherer of a New Age</size>：</span><br>
Miss Governor, your tea is ready.<br>
It's rather hot today, so please be mindful of heatstrokes.<br>
<br>
On a balcony of the palace in the old capital, the Governor of the Nile looked out across her territory, accompanied by her pet and a Royal Maid.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Lion：</span><br>
It's not that hot. In fact, it's a perfect day to sail. Incidentally, are the preparations in order?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">A Rose on the High Tower

<size=45>1 The Usherer of a New Age</size>：</span><br>
Adjustments to the Mesektet were made last night. The manager said that it is in peak condition and ready to sail at a moment's notice.<br>
Please be on the lookout for smaller ships in the river. The final supplies are being loaded onto the Mesektet as we speak.<br>
Everything should be ready by lunchtime.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Lion：</span><br>
Slower than I'd prefer. Peace makes men grow weak. Hmph.<br>
Oi, Cleopatra! The tea!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">A Rose on the High Tower

<size=45>1 The Usherer of a New Age</size>：</span><br>
Ah, my apologies, Miss Governor! I-I'll tidy up at once!<br>
<br>
The Royal Maid was so focused on answering the governor's question that she didn't notice that she was still pouring tea.<br>
After a brief but chaotic episode, the maid finally managed to get the expanding mess of spilled tea, broken plates, and stained carpets under control.<br>
The pet lion lying nearby took a passing glance at her before going back to sleep, as if accustomed to this sight.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Lion：</span><br>
*sigh*... And to think I took you for a level-headed, capable maid at first glance.<br>
Little did I know how clumsy you could be. I cannot fathom why the Royal Maids assigned you to me.<br>
No matter. You cleaned up, and that's sufficient. Sit down and rest.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">A Rose on the High Tower

<size=45>1 The Usherer of a New Age</size>：</span><br>
Ahaha... My sincerest apologies, Miss Governor.<br>
However, with all due respect, it wouldn't have been so easy to move forward with many of your plans if I hadn't been here.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Lion：</span><br>
Be that as it may, this mission has the approval of both Houses.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">A Rose on the High Tower

<size=45>1 The Usherer of a New Age</size>：</span><br>
It's evident that they took advantage of the fact that you weren't present.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Lion：</span><br>
I can simply refuse. Nobody can force me.<br>
But, I have reasons to go. While our nation's radiance covers every corner of the world, the enfeebling that comes with peace is also spreading across the world.<br>
Furthermore, I did not create an artificial Singularity only for it to gather dust.<br>
An opportunity such as this to explore without being prodded from behind is exactly what I've been wishing for.<br>
Come to think of it, I should be thanking you, Cleopatra. For picking and choosing the information to give them.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">A Rose on the High Tower

<size=45>1 The Usherer of a New Age</size>：</span><br>
You're welcome. Your district is also our district, Governor – as such, this is just a part of my job.<br>
<br>
For a moment, the Royal Maid assumes a capable and calm exterior, as though she's become someone else entirely.<br>
Soon, though, she realizes that she has been pouring tea for a long time.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">A Rose on the High Tower

<size=45>1 The Usherer of a New Age</size>：</span><br>
Oh dear! I'm truly sorry! I'll clean this up at once!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Lion：</span><br>
Forget it. Just replace the carpet later.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">A Rose on the High Tower

<size=45>1 The Usherer of a New Age</size>：</span><br>
Ahaha... Very well. I will buy a new one.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Lion：</span><br>
Hmh. Who's that by the riverside? Trafalgar?<br>
She should be at the station, making preparations. What is she doing over there?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">A Rose on the High Tower

<size=45>1 The Usherer of a New Age</size>：</span><br>
Hmm. Perhaps she's expressing an interest in our solar barque?<br>
You've always kept her away from your artificial Singularity facility, so she may view this voyage with the Mesektet as a rare opportunity.<br>
Shall I politely ask her to leave?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Lion：</span><br>
No need. She is a representative from the Royal Knights and the Mediterranean fleet and has come to support me. I am grateful to her.<br>
She will board the Mesektet sooner or later, regardless. Just don't let her close to the Lighthouse.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">A Rose on the High Tower

<size=45>1 The Usherer of a New Age</size>：</span><br>
As you wish.<br>
Um, if I may... I've been wondering about something for a while.<br>
While I do understand the reasoning behind naming the Singularity's fixed module "Miracle Recreation - Lighthouse of Alexandria," as it has a nice meaning...<br>
Is there a particular reason why the separation module was named "Mesektet"?<br>
It seems a little... inauspicious to give that name to a ship that living people take.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Lion：</span><br>
That is precisely why it's called that.<br>
We will ride this ship through a Singularity and explore a vast and unknown new world.<br>
Although there will be hardships, the journey is eternally splendorous and grand.<br>
Carrying hope and living for the journey to death – isn't that Mesektet in a nutshell?<br>
<br>
"Thus, I issued the order to commence an expedition."<br>
"Could this be a ploy? It is possible, but I care not."<br>
"My power over the Nile territory is unrivalled and uncontested."<br>
"My technological prowess that brought the Mesektet into being is also unparalleled."<br>
"Thus, it makes sense to go on a journey beyond home."<br>
"Our world is a small one. We are trapped on a tiny planet."<br>
"The possibilities of the worlds out there are endlessly vast."<br>
"The tide of a new age begins to rise."<br>
"At its forefront shall be I – Lion."<br>

<br>
Unknown location<br>
Camelot - Coordinate point<br>
A faint tremble suddenly shook the dark emptiness.<br>
Under the cover of their new stealth system, Camelot – carrying Elizabeth and her entourage – appeared in the air above a great ocean, where the coordinates pointed to.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Vanguard：</span><br>
Your Majesty, this island appears to be rather dangerous.<br>
<br>
Having put Camelot into its passive stealth mode, Queen Elizabeth META started the Queen's Light and led her team to a nearby island.<br>
The sky overhead had a faint ashen tinge to it, as though it was covered by smoke that would not disperse.<br>
Setting foot on the island, they saw the aftermath of a battle all over the place.<br>
<span style="color:#ffc960;">Hunter META：</span><br>
Air temperature: Low. Humidity... Also low. Don't see any native vegetation.<br>
Buildings appear to have been destroyed a while back. No sign of plant life or even insects in the ruins.<br>
There's nothing here but deathly silence. Feels foreboding...<br>
<span style="color:#ffc960;">Renown META ：</span><br>
There is nothing on the radar either.<br>
I believe that we first of all need to find a continent. Any continent. A few islands alone cannot provide us with a sufficient grasp of the basic situation of this world.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Queen Elizabeth：</span><br>
She's right. Shall we leave already?<br>
<span style="color:#ffc960;">Queen Elizabeth META：</span><br>
Hold on, Elizabeth. We've found something.<br>
We ran a high-altitude scan with the train's onboard equipment before exiting.<br>
The scan just yielded something. Care to guess what?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Queen Elizabeth：</span><br>
Surely not the entire world is the same as this island, is it?<br>
<span style="color:#ffc960;">Queen Elizabeth META：</span><br>
From the point of view of civilisation, yes, it's much like this island.<br>
Naturally, it's a different story if you include the signals from Sirens.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Queen Elizabeth：</span><br>
It sounds like they engaged the reset... Are we too late?<br>
<span style="color:#ffc960;">Queen Elizabeth META：</span><br>
The Sirens' signals are far too weak for it to have been a reset. The signals themselves are quite unusual, possibly indicating they originate from modified Siren equipment.<br>
Whatever the case, those are the results of our analysis. Any second opinions?<br>
<span style="color:#ffc960;">Erebus META：</span><br>
It doesn't look like a reset. Everything hasn't been cleanly swept away. The Sirens wouldn't be so wasteful.<br>
<span style="color:#ffc960;">Repulse META ：</span><br>
Yeah. I think so, too.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Belfast：</span><br>
The signals are quite... idiosyncratic. They differ from what we've recorded of every other Siren experimentation division that we've engaged previously.<br>
No, rather... Perhaps they bear some similarity to the patterns of the Basilicas on the Kerguelen Islands? I'm afraid I cannot help more than that.<br>
<span style="color:#ffc960;">Grenville META：</span><br>
Bel's analysis is on point. The signals have been tampered with. It wasn't the Orthodoxy, though. The Royal Navy did it.<br>
Your Majesty, I think the signals are coming from the command centre of a mass-produced Siren force. The tampering method is the same as our world once used!<br>
<span style="color:#ffc960;">Queen Elizabeth META：</span><br>
Then it is possible that this world has fared a similar fate to that of Grenville's.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Queen Elizabeth：</span><br>
Could this absence of human signals be due to a mass adoption of Siren technology?<br>
<span style="color:#ffc960;">Queen Elizabeth META：</span><br>
That is a possibility. We're sure to discover something if we search the area where the signals are densest.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Queen Elizabeth：</span><br>
Phew. That's good news, at least.<br>
<span style="color:#ffc960;">Sheffield META：</span><br>
Unfortunately, I have bad news to share.<br>
This is a sample I collected from a wreckage in the city ruins. Please have a look.<br>
<br>
Sheffield META returned from her excursion, took out an analyzer, and presented the small debris floating inside.<br>
It was white and almost resembled some sort of chunk of flesh, yet it also had a luster like marble.<br>
Attached to the top of the "chunk of flesh" was a machine made with an unidentified material. In spite of having sustained devastating damage, the debris still blinked with a blue light.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Queen Elizabeth：</span><br>
Hmm... The colouring looks like something I've heard of before.<br>
Could it be a part of those extradimensionals that my servant spoke of?<br>
<span style="color:#ffc960;">Sheffield META：</span><br>
I'm afraid that is difficult to determine. I've never seen a sample from these "extradimensionals," you see.<br>
However, based on what I see, I can all but confirm that it was previously part of some enormous creature.<br>
Although only low levels of corrosion have affected the metallic part, the organic part exhibits the typical traits of subjugative corrosion.<br>
Whether it came from an "extradimensional" or not, I advise exercising caution.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Queen Elizabeth：</span><br>
...We could only decode the "Siren" part of the distress signal, so I was sure we were merely dealing with one of the Sirens' experimentation divisions.<br>
It seems this will be a lot more troublesome than I'd anticipated.<br>

<br>
Unknown location<br>
Mesektet's fixed position<br>
Dazzling light painted the black sky.<br>
The Mesektet had arrived at its destination – a vast ocean – in a literally flashy manner, partly a result of technological limitations and partly a deliberate design decision.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Lion：</span><br>
Haha! Hahahaha! Haaahahah!<br>
We've done it! To a new world, we have come!<br>
This day will go down in history! I dare say it's the landmark moment that will forever symbolise this era!<br>
Cleopatra, I trust you've recorded my glory for the history books.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Cleopatra：</span><br>
Of course, Miss Governor! I did not miss a thing!<br>
Nngh... All that turbulence from before made me think the ship would break apart! We're fortunate that nothing bad happened...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Lion：</span><br>
That we overcame peril is surely proof that we are blessed by God. Should you need further evidence, look no further than our impending success in the mission ahead.<br>
Mmm... Smell that new world air.<br>
It's so very... *cough*... Ugh, very... *cough cough*... Why is it so damn hard to breathe?!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Gallant：</span><br>
*cough*! The air and the colour of the sky here remind me of the capital city...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Trinidad：</span><br>
Stop it... I don't want to remember those days. I already miss life by the Nile.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Trafalgar：</span><br>
It's strange. We're far away from land, so how can the air quality be this poor?<br>
Miss Governor, something is deeply wrong with this world.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Lion：</span><br>
Of course. I'd be more concerned if there wasn't... *cough*!<br>
Cleopatra. Confirm the Mesektet's air filtration system status. Why is our air impure?!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Cleopatra：</span><br>
Understood... Umm, it doesn't seem to be malfunctioning. It's more like it just isn't doing anything.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Lion：</span><br>
Then there's a problem with its automated start? Forget it – we can troubleshoot later. For now, start it manually!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Cleopatra：</span><br>
Yes, Miss Governor!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Lion：</span><br>
Ahem... Where was I?<br>
Ah, yes. This world has problems. Otherwise, they wouldn't have sought help from another.<br>
We may not be the only ones responding to their distress signal. Our first order of business is to establish contact with this world's Royal Navy and establish an alliance before any other faction can–<br>
<br>
BANG!<br>
A violent impact beneath the water's surface echoed throughout the silent sea.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Lion：</span><br>
Something has struck our underwater shield! Find out what it was at once!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Gallant：</span><br>
Oooh! Time for my security pup to put in work!<br>
Go check things out underwater, security pup!<br>
<br>
Upon Gallant's orders, her mechanical dog dove into the water.<br>
Though it was a part of her rigging, it could be remotely controlled through her thoughts.<br>
Despite being a practical application of technology developed for the control of carrier-based aircraft...<br>
Unfortunately, the time and effort put into said application did not return promising results.<br>
As such, implementation of this technology was limited to only a select few shipgirls on an experimental basis.<br>
Gallant was one of those lucky few.<br>
The reason for her selection was simple: She loved the technology, and she had the energy necessary to pilot it.<br>
As the impacts repeated, Gallant's security pup returned with a piece of the attacker.<br>
When it landed on deck, the group ran over to it.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Gallant：</span><br>
Everyone, look! This is what my security pup brought back!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">??? - Unknown sea：</span><br>
It's white muscular tissue... with some blue metal affixed to it?<br>
What could it be? Is this part of a biological weapon?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Trinidad：</span><br>
Its texture isn't that of muscular tissue... There are no blood vessels or striations, either. I'd liken it more to carved jade.<br>
Kind of gross... but with a sort of divine beauty, perhaps?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Lion：</span><br>
Hmm. Trafalgar, have you seen anything like this in the Imperial Naval Database?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Trafalgar：</span><br>
No. I can say with certainty that nothing in our database of Siren biological weapons matches this.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Lion：</span><br>
Then it must be something else.<br>
I like this less and less by the moment. We need to identify it now.<br>
Deploy the Mesektet's wings! Evacuate from this sea at once!<br>
<br>
Through the combined power of cutting-edge Siren tech, rigid shielding, prototype Energy Cube engines, and anti-gravity technology, the Mesektet spread its wings and took flight.<br>
However, even after its departure, the light did not fade.<br>
That was the light of Miracle Recreation - Lighthouse of Alexandria, illuminating both the path forward and the way home.<br>
{{折叠面板|内容结束}}

{{折叠面板|标题=Rising Tide|选项=4|主框=1|样式=primary|展开=是}}
<br>
Not even a few minutes after the Mesektet had taken flight, the dead-silent sea suddenly bubbled, as if boiling.<br>
A blanket of debris rose to the surface, with bits and pieces colliding and piling onto each other endlessly.<br>
Some mixed to form stable structures of sorts, creating islands that floated on the surface.<br>
A few of the existing spots that Lion's party had believed to be islands were crushed and wiped off the face of the ocean by this Rising Tide.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Gallant：</span><br>
Phew... Good thing we can fly! We could've ended up swallowed by all that debris!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Trinidad：</span><br>
"The expedition was engulfed by a sea of garbage shortly after their arrival, never to be seen again."<br>
Imagine if that were what the history books said. We'd be the biggest laughingstock in the Realm's history.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Cleopatra：</span><br>
Don't worry about that! If we did all die just now, there would be nobody left to tell them how it happened.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Trinidad：</span><br>
That didn't really make me feel better. Thanks for trying, though.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Gallant：</span><br>
Same! Hmm... We've been flying for more than half an hour now, but we still haven't gotten past the wreckage yet.<br>
It's debris as far as the eye can see. I've never seen anything like it, even during the war with the Sirens!<br>
But at least we sorted it all out and recycled it!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Cleopatra：</span><br>
Right... If it's been neglected and allowed to pile up for so long, then it's no wonder this world's environment is in poor condition.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Trinidad：</span><br>
I don't think that's what she meant.<br>
What matters is why so much sunken debris would rise up to the surface without reason, right?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Cleopatra：</span><br>
Is it being stirred up by a giant sea monster?!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Gallant：</span><br>
Ugh! Now isn't the time to get scared of your Nile legends!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Cleopatra：</span><br>
But the debris that you fished up resembled biological matter, did it not?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Gallant：</span><br>
E-even then, it's just not possible! I'd believe it more if it were some kind of giant underwater machine, maybe.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Cleopatra：</span><br>
Should we not just go down and investigate for ourselves?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Gallant：</span><br>
My security pup can't go that deep! Besides, we'll totally get crushed if we go in there!<br>
<br>
While they talked about the joys of flight and argued over the Rising Tide, Lion and Trafalgar discussed something graver.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Trafalgar：</span><br>
Miss Governor. As you may have noticed, the debris is remarkably varied. And... though the rust levels differ, I believe all of it is old.<br>
No aquatic flora or fauna rose with the debris, either.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Lion：</span><br>
...One side of a war may have used a poisonous weapon that killed everything in the water along with their enemy.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Trafalgar：</span><br>
How long would it take to exterminate all life in the ocean? Ten years? Twenty, fifty?<br>
The distress signal we received made it clear that a conflict was ongoing.<br>
Knowing what we know now, either they've greatly overestimated their enemy... or it may be the result of a particular space-time hypothesis.<br>
You wield the Lighthouse of Alexandria, so you must understand.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Lion：</span><br>
As in, time flows differently here? We'll have to find locals and ask them about the situation.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Trafalgar：</span><br>
Agreed. We're still in a vast ocean, so our first priority is to find terra firma.<br>
The skies are grey in all directions, as if someone's put a filter on them. We won't be able to navigate using the stars.<br>
Miss Governor, does the Mesektet have any cutting-edge geolocation equipment that can help us?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Lion：</span><br>
Hmm... We do have radars with strong scanning features. If we ascend to a high enough altitude, then locating a continent may be feasible.<br>
Using it will draw worldwide attention to us, though. It'll cause more of a commotion than when we first arrived.<br>
Given the current mess we already face, I mean to avoid using it unless absolutely necessary.<br>
For now, let's find clearer skies. The stars will have to do for now.<br>

<br>
After confirming the presence of X's subjugative corrosion on the island, Elizabeth META immediately ordered everyone back into the Queen's Light.<br>
The train rode through the air, leaving the small island behind.<br>
<span style="color:#ffc960;">Queen Elizabeth META：</span><br>
The situation is grave. If X-like wreckage has already appeared here, then this world may be too far gone.<br>
Elizabeth, change of plans.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Queen Elizabeth：</span><br>
Even if that distress signal did come from survivors, there can't possibly be many left...<br>
I doubt we have any reason to establish a base or request aid at this point.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Vanguard：</span><br>
Your Majesty, I don't understand...<br>
We came to help as soon as we received the distress signal. Why didn't we make it in time?<br>
No matter how poorly the battle was going, we should've found SOME place where things were okay.<br>
<span style="color:#ffc960;">Queen Elizabeth META：</span><br>
The flow of time is not equal between worlds.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Vanguard：</span><br>
But...<br>
<span style="color:#ffc960;">Queen Elizabeth META：</span><br>
We understand your question. Patience.<br>
In the absence of mutual observation between worlds, the flow of time in the one you cannot observe is both immeasurable and fundamentally meaningless to you.<br>
In other words, you can only measure and discuss the world you can observe.<br>
Your mistake is carrying a one-sided perspective into a second world.<br>
Your observations must now be based on the target world, and you can no longer perceive the source world. The flow of time back home is now impossible to know.<br>
When you return home to the source world, it may have been years – or it may have been mere seconds. Consider it entirely random and thus unpredictable.<br>
We have avoided such a situation by using technology to observe two worlds simultaneously and adjusting the ratio of time's flow.<br>
For example, Camelot and the Tower of Midgard built by your world's Iron Blood are two such machines.<br>
A main characteristic of such a machine is that it must exist simultaneously in both worlds.<br>
The Tower of Midgard doesn't move, but the upgraded Camelot CAN. It also has the power to conceal its own existence.<br>
Furthermore, as far as we know, the Tower of Midgard only has the power to synchronise the flow of time between worlds.<br>
Meanwhile, the upgraded Camelot is able to make time flow anywhere from half as fast to twice as fast in localised areas in both worlds.<br>
Hmm. This relates to further applications of Mirror Sea technology, so it may be too complex for you to understand.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Vanguard：</span><br>
Umm... So what you're saying is, the Royal Navy here doesn't have a device that can synchronise time with us, and that's why this happened?<br>
<span style="color:#ffc960;">Queen Elizabeth META：</span><br>
Half correct. Now that we and the Elizabeth here have designated each other as partners for this process, she should have anticipated this.<br>
We once helped her build a basic synchronisation device for this world.<br>
That device should be able to mutually stabilise time between us within a set geographic radius, avoiding extreme circumstances like the ones we face now.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Vanguard：</span><br>
...Which means it must've been destroyed in the war.<br>
<span style="color:#ffc960;">Queen Elizabeth META：</span><br>
Indeed. Some of this still eludes us, but that is the most logical conclusion given the information we have.<br>
We're generating a topographical map based on our scan results. It isn't finished yet, but we can speculate that we should be in this world's NA Sea.<br>
As for the modified Siren signal, it came from the direction of the Royal Isles. Good news, more or less.<br>
Once the map is completed, shall we head directly to the LD Port?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Queen Elizabeth：</span><br>
Agreed.<br>

<br>
Many of the parts from the Mesektet's experimental phase were a product of compromise, and not all of them could be said to be cutting-edge technology.<br>
Either their cruising speed was low or the sea was just too big, but either way, it took a long while for the Mesektet to leave the Rising Tide's effective range.<br>
All the while, the sky above them remained a hazy grey, day and night.<br>
Lion had grown sick of waiting, and ordered an ascent to high altitude. That's when they finally sighted the edge of land.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Gallant：</span><br>
Fwee-fwee! Land! I see land!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Lion：</span><br>
Finally. Once I return to the district, I'll need to recruit an aircraft carrier.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Trinidad：</span><br>
Judging by its terrain, the island ahead of us appears to be the Isle of Wight.<br>
If so, the landmass beyond that should be... the Royal Islands.<br>
We have returned home, Miss Governor.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Lion：</span><br>
Using the word "home" to describe this place feels wrong.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Trafalgar：</span><br>
Oh, wait a moment. We're flying toward the Isle of Wight, yes?<br>
Despite that, I cannot see any kind of landmass beyond the Isle.<br>
Where is Europa? Or the Britannian Peninsula? Where has the Iris Orthodoxy gone?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Lion：</span><br>
Good questions. It doesn't seem like we cannot observe them due to some fault on our end.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Trafalgar：</span><br>
Yes. Unless the geography of this world's Royal Islands is completely inverse to ours, that shouldn't be possible.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Lion：</span><br>
The notion that the entire continent of Europa has disappeared is, frankly, too far-fetched.<br>
We must not jump to conclusions. Let us make landfall before anything else.<br>
We do know that the distress signal came from a Royal Navy source. We'll find answers if we ask around.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Siren：</span><br>
BWEEEEE!<br>
<br>
As the Mesektet descended, the ship's sirens began to blare, warning that the land on the island was emitting serious levels of radiation.<br>
Fortunately, the onboard barrier generator was able to protect against it.<br>
The Mesektet landed, and then established a safe zone on the isle's surface using its golden barrier.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Lion：</span><br>
Cleopatra, Trinidad, stay and watch the ship.<br>
Gallant, Trafalgar, you'll disembark with me. The barrier has a limited range, so don't go too far from the ship.<br>
<br>
The island was uninhabited and desolate, with ruins as far as the eye could see. The word "wasteland" summed it up perfectly.<br>
Although they identified this place as the Isle of Wight, it looked nothing like how they remembered it.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Lion：</span><br>
What a horrific sight. One can presume there are no survivors.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Trafalgar：</span><br>
Although the wreckages have long since crumbled away, there is still no sign of nature. No plants, not even a single insect.<br>
It's the same as the wreck we saw in the sea.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Lion：</span><br>
Do you think it's linked to the radiation? We detected none on the wreckage.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Trafalgar：</span><br>
That's merely conjecture. First of all, we should collect samples and analyse them.<br>
It's likely we'll be in this world for a while, so we need to gather as much information as possible.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Gallant：</span><br>
Fwee-fwee!<br>
Miss Governor, if it's samples you want, why not start over there?<br>
<br>
The others looked where Gallant was pointing. There was a small hill there – or rather, a massive thing that assumed the shape of a hill.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Lion：</span><br>
My god! Is this the thing that the piece we retrieved came from?!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Trafalgar：</span><br>
Incredible. It's less like a carcass and more like... a mountain of white rock that resembles some giant creature mixed with metal shards.<br>
Is it an artificial lifeform? Or is it a machine?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Gallant：</span><br>
Fwee-fwee! Security pup, fetch us a sample!<br>
<br>
The security pup worked like normal even outside the barrier. It arrived at its destination and deployed its cutting implement.<br>
Then, the earth began to quake, and to the group's amazement, the hill of mass started moving.<br>
Despite appearing to be made of marble, it extended several tentacles, much like a living creature.<br>
The metal shards that were initially brown and scattered then merged into one inside the white giant and began glowing with a blue light.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Gallant：</span><br>
Is that thing... bringing itself back to life?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Trafalgar：</span><br>
Let it, I say. I will test how powerful it is.<br>
<br>
KABOOOM!<br>
Trafalgar fired a volley at a tentacle extending forward. Her shells pierced through it and shattered it in the middle.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Trafalgar：</span><br>
I see. It looks more threatening than it is.<br>
<br>
The attack seemed to stir something in the alien creature. It swelled like a pufferfish, which made the earth's quaking even more violent.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Trafalgar：</span><br>
Still moving, are you? Then let's finish it.<br>
<br>
Trafalgar fired her main cannons again.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Lion：</span><br>
No, wait... No matter how big this monster is, it can't possibly be causing this earthquake by itself!<br>
Cleopatra! Report on our surroundings, now!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Royal Islands - Isle of Wight：</span><br>
Miss Governor! There are hostiles all around us trying to revive themselves! Something's moving under the water, too!<br>
Please retreat at once for your own safety!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Lion：</span><br>
I knew it.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Trafalgar：</span><br>
A moment, please, Miss Governor. Our enemy isn't all that strong. It's worth engaging it at least once.<br>
When an enemy appears on the horizon, it is the Royal Navy's duty to face it!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Lion：</span><br>
No! There are too many of them!<br>
Have you in the Mediterranean fleet been getting influenced by the bloody Sardegnians?! Face reality!<br>
Listen to my orders! Cleopatra, prepare for takeoff!<br>
Gallant, Trafalgar, come with me! We're retreating immediately!<br>

Royal Islands - Port of LD<br>
Rose Tower - War Room<br>
A noble girl sat by her radio equipment, attentively recording and listening.<br>
Half a year had passed since she received a response, and she still didn't know where her allies were.<br>
Despite that, she adjusted her previously set-in-stone plans to be able to receive guests at a moment's notice.<br>
She split her daily communications time between morning and afternoon and added several new intel receivers.<br>
She also canceled her simulations, extended her live-combat time, restarted multiple Pawn production lines, and gradually expanded the territory under her control.<br>
<span style="color:#ffc960;">Glorious META：</span><br>
Hmm. Combat sectors 8 through 12 are still silent. All activity has completely ceased. No increase or decrease in points of interest.<br>
The Northumbria sector... Its reboot is over halfway complete, and an initial patrol fleet has been formed. Production lines are up and running. No increase or decrease in points of interest.<br>
The Mercia sector is still advancing steadily. The patrol fleet launched three attacks this morning and successfully cleared three points of interest. All is normal in the control area, likewise for the production lines.<br>
The Essex, Sussex, East Anglia, and Kent sectors are stable, with zero points of interest. All is normal in the control area, likewise for the production lines.<br>
The Wessex sec– Huh?<br>
There are 13 new points of interest in the vicinity of the Isle of Wight?<br>
How could that be? Yesterday, there was no indication of a Beastly Tide occurring...<br>
Gloucester, please tell the main fleet in the Wessex sector to head there at once and eliminate the hostiles.<br>
Edinburgh, please open the sluices in all waterways from the Thames to the Itchen.<br>
I need to see it for myself!<br>

<br>
KABOOOM!<br>
The Mesektet's and the train's combined efforts managed to bring down a significant number of airborne enemies.<br>
When Lion determined they'd gained enough breathing room, she contacted the train, and they immediately answered.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Communicator：</span><br>
BEEP BEEP!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Queen Elizabeth：</span><br>
Good evening.<br>
I am Queen Elizabeth, one of the original proponents of the Eternal Sun Project.<br>
This train is called the Queen's Light. We heard your distress signal and were obliged by oath to come and assist.<br>
I'm glad there is still an active resistance here. What's your status?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Gallant：</span><br>
Psst! Miss Governor! She said she's Elizabeth and claims she came because of an oath...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Trinidad：</span><br>
She seems to have mistaken us for the natives of this world.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Cleopatra：</span><br>
I wonder if this "Eternal Sun Project" has anything to do with the distress signal – "in the name of the Eternal Sun."<br>
I think they're the real allies of whoever sent that signal, they got here before us, and their technology is much more advanced than ours.<br>
Miss Governor, what should we do?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Queen Elizabeth：</span><br>
Hello? Do you copy? How strange – it does say we're on the line...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Cleopatra：</span><br>
Miss Governor, please say something.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Lion：</span><br>
Ahem. We hear you.<br>
Lady Elizabeth, is it? I am Lion, and I serve the Realm of the Neversetting Sun. I am the governor of the Nile in my home world.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Queen Elizabeth：</span><br>
Good to meet you, Lion. We only just arrived here, so we know nothing about your situation.<br>
I want all the information you have about this world, its Royal Navy's remaining forces, and the enemy.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Lion：</span><br>
Hrmh...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Queen Elizabeth：</span><br>
Did you just grunt? Is something the matter?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Lion：</span><br>
Well, you see, we also came here after receiving a distress signal.<br>
We know almost nothing about this world, just like you. In fact, we've been looking for someone from here who could explain things to us.<br>
<br>
The other end of the line fell silent for a while before speaking up again.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Queen Elizabeth：</span><br>
...This is NOT what I was expecting. What a confusing mess this is.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Lion：</span><br>
There's more. You said your name was Queen Elizabeth, did you not?<br>
This is my first time meeting you. Alive, I mean.<br>
<br>
Again, the other side fell silent.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Queen Elizabeth：</span><br>
What an honour. Your world must have quite a complicated history.<br>
We'll have to discuss it another time, though. Since we're both here for the same reason, shall we team up?<br>
First, let's deal with what remains of these things, then find a safe place and exchange information. Sound good?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Lion：</span><br>
That it does. Let us work together.<br>
Hm? Hang on...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Queen Elizabeth：</span><br>
So you noticed. Yes, a mass-produced fleet is approaching us from the northwest.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Lion：</span><br>
What are those things in the air? Royal Navy aircraft?<br>
Could they be another force that received the distress signal?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Queen Elizabeth：</span><br>
No. This time, it's actual survivors from this world.<br>
Come on, then. Let's deal with these foes, then go and meet up with them!<br>
<br>
<br>
KABOOOM!<br>
The crew safely returned to the Mesektet thanks to Lion's quick thinking. The ship took to the air, and everything seemed to have gone well.<br>
The giant, white creatures, however, were not going to let their prey flee just like that.<br>
Swarms of flying creatures rose into the air and encircled the Mesektet like a swarm of locusts, chipping away at the shield.<br>
This forced them to reroute energy to the shield generator just to keep it up, which reduced their already low speed even further.<br>
KABOOOM!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Trafalgar：</span><br>
Miss Governor, we need to land in the water!<br>
We're sitting ducks in the air. At least in the water, we can fight back.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Lion：</span><br>
Stay calm. Have faith in the Realm's technology.<br>
The Mesektet has an emergency evacuation system. If worse comes to worst, we can still go home.<br>
Should it come to that, though... the new world expedition I've yearned for will meet an anticlimactic end.<br>
I would hate for that to happen.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Trafalgar：</span><br>
That's all the more reason for us to land. Then we can fight, and if we start losing, we can just retreat again.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Lion：</span><br>
No. It's far too risky.<br>
Urgh... No, you're sadly right. I can come back for another expedition, but I cannot come back from death.<br>
Cleopatra, calibrate the Lighthouse. Prepare a homeward beacon as well, and then we'll–<br>
<br>
With a dazzling light, an opulent train manifested in mid-air.<br>
It flew toward the Mesektet at breakneck speed and used its tremendous firepower to rip apart all the enemies in its path.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Cleopatra：</span><br>
A train?! In the air?!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Lion：</span><br>
Hahaha! Reinforcements from the world's inhabitants! The darkest hour is just before the dawn!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Trinidad：</span><br>
That's quite the stunning train.<br>
Miss Governor, if that train ends up in deep water, I don't think we'll be able to help.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Lion：</span><br>
Whatever happens, happens! Right now, assist them in taking out these enemies!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Trafalgar：</span><br>
So we're going to land, I presume?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Lion：</span><br>
Like hell we will! They're airborne and still fighting valiantly! Stay in the air and pound the enemy to dust!<br>
<br>
<br>
KABOOOM!<br>
With their overpowering advantage, they encircled and annihilated the enemy. Silence returned to the chaotic sea.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Lion：</span><br>
Well, that was a gripping and grand victory.<br>
You, the beautiful lady – it was you who called for help, was it not?<br>
<br>
Using the Mesektet's equipment, Lion projected a hologram of herself into the air. She stood tall like a divine, golden giant.<br>
Seeing this, the girl leading a fleet of mass-produced ships responded with a gracious bow.<br>
<span style="color:#ffc960;">Glorious META：</span><br>
I am Glorious, the flagship of the Realm of the Neversetting Sun. I welcome you, our allies.<br>
I have no doubt that, after coming from such distant worlds, you must have many questions for me.<br>
However, I think you'll agree that this place is not suited for a reception.<br>
Let us first move to a safe location, and then we may speak.<br>
<br>
Lion and Elizabeth acknowledged. They took their airship and flying train and followed the lead of the aircraft to the port of LD.<br>
{{折叠面板|内容结束}}

{{折叠面板|标题=Survivors of the Rose Tower|选项=9|主框=1|样式=primary|展开=是}}
<br>
Lion and Elizabeth's parties were overwhelmed as they flew over the lifeless land, beloved home twisted beyond recognition.<br>
Both sides happened to suggest landing in the Thames for now. After passing the fortified Tower Bridge, they stood before the most well-preserved place in the former capital: The Rose Tower.<br>
Glorious welcomed them with a ceremony.<br>
Elizabeth had hoped to question her about this world immediately, but everything she saw only added to her questions, so she restrained herself and waited for the ceremony to end.<br>
Knights led the procession, accompanied by maids.<br>
The banquet was a far cry from the luxury back home, but it did serve as a sign of their host's care.<br>
Finally, it came time for all questions to be answered.<br>
Port of LD - Rose Tower<br>
Reception Hall<br>
There were too few attendants to make use of the spacious reception hall, but the comings and goings of maids made up for the lack of activity.<br>
After accepting tea from Gloucester, Lion was the first to speak up.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Lion：</span><br>
Glorious, your hospitality is appreciated, but I think it's time we get to business.<br>
Just us – none of your Pawns.<br>
<span style="color:#ffc960;">Glorious META：</span><br>
Ah... I'm sorry. I'm so accustomed to their presence that I hardly notice them.<br>
You're right, though. It's odd. I admit my mistake.<br>
<br>
Glorious waved a hand, and her busy maids – the Pawns – all left the reception hall at once.<br>
The heavy door closed. Empty silence hung over the hall.<br>
<span style="color:#ffc960;">Glorious META：</span><br>
Allow me to apologise again. It's been... so long since we had guests.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Lion：</span><br>
So you've been stuck living with Pawns all this time? I'm sorry, too – I should've guessed your circumstances.<br>
<span style="color:#ffc960;">Glorious META：</span><br>
No, no. It's natural that you all have suspicions, and I was hesitant to show myself to you before... But that was wrong of me.<br>
If you have questions, please don't hesitate to ask.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Queen Elizabeth：</span><br>
I'll start.<br>
Glorious, what happened to this world? How long has it been since the distress signal was sent?<br>
Are there survivors other than you? What are your military capabilities?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Lion：</span><br>
You took the words right out of my mouth.<br>
I'll add a couple more questions. Where did the continent of Europa go? How did the Isle of Wight get so corrupted, and what do you know about the Rising Tide?<br>
<span style="color:#ffc960;">Glorious META：</span><br>
Hmm... Allow me to answer one at a time.<br>
As you've no doubt noticed, civilisation was destroyed by an extradimensional invasion. It's all gone.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Lion：</span><br>
Extradimensional... Is that what you call those alien things?<br>
<span style="color:#ffc960;">Glorious META：</span><br>
Yes. One day, I awoke to find that the very moon above our heads had become our enemy.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Lion：</span><br>
The moon?!<br>
<span style="color:#ffc960;">Glorious META：</span><br>
Yes. On the night of a full moon 137 years ago, an earth-shaking boom awoke me.<br>
I rushed outside onto the balcony, and when I looked up, it was blue... and it began to rain meteors upon the world.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Lion：</span><br>
A meteor shower came from the moon? Why?<br>
<span style="color:#ffc960;">Glorious META：</span><br>
I don't know. Scientists at the time theorised that something had happened to its core, causing unprecedented earthquakes.<br>
Those quakes sent debris flying into space, which was captured by our planet's gravity...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Lion：</span><br>
Sounds less like theory and more like wild speculation, to me.<br>
<span style="color:#ffc960;">Glorious META：</span><br>
Perhaps. Regardless, the situation made it difficult to probe into the cause.<br>
Along with the meteors, beings that the Sirens called "extradimensionals" appeared.<br>
They came out of the meteors and spread their forces at never-before-seen speeds.<br>
The first attack by our factions was easily repelled. After that, with Siren aid, we built second and third lines of defence to protect vital areas–<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Lion：</span><br>
You mean to say you fought alongside Sirens?!<br>
<span style="color:#ffc960;">Glorious META：</span><br>
Yes...? Sirens may have internal disagreements, but they've been quite friendly with us.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Lion：</span><br>
F-friendly...<br>
<span style="color:#ffc960;">Glorious META：</span><br>
Is that strange?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Lion：</span><br>
Forget it. Keep talking.<br>
<span style="color:#ffc960;">Glorious META：</span><br>
Well... This foreign threat convinced even the quarrelling Siren elites to unite.<br>
We managed to suppress the enemy for a time, but they were endless and had no sense of self-preservation. Gradually, we were whittled down, and our second line fell.<br>
Her Majesty Queen Elizabeth sent the distress signal after that.<br>
Our allies fell one after another, and so too did the Siren elites... In the end, I was the only one left.<br>
The Rose Tower area remains under my control, and I can manage the creation of mass-produced Sirens and Pawns, but...<br>
This is all the power that I... no, that all this world can muster.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Lion：</span><br>
If things were going that badly, then why did you alone survive?<br>
<span style="color:#ffc960;">Glorious META：</span><br>
Ever since the Sirens used the last of their power to construct this tower, extradimensional activity has gradually decreased all over the world.<br>
Around the time it was completed, I still had companions left. But the war was long, and while the enemy had weakened, our numbers continued to fall...<br>
Though I'm alone now, the extradimensionals no longer wield enough power to put an end to me.<br>
As for why me... I'm sorry...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Lion：</span><br>
You're a brave warrior who managed to outlast the war. That's all I need to know about that.<br>
<span style="color:#ffc960;">Glorious META：</span><br>
Thank you. Regarding the radiation...<br>
The extradimensional radiation was one major reason that our defensive line fell so quickly.<br>
We didn't know how it worked. We had to rely on the Sirens' purification machines, but even those couldn't fully purify it.<br>
I later learned that the radiation didn't exist within the extradimensionals – it was generated when they attacked.<br>
Therefore, as long as we could maintain shields in vital areas, the radiation would not be able to spread.<br>
As for the Rising Tide of debris... We called it the same thing when we first witnessed it.<br>
The debris came from many long years of war. It continued to sink to the sea floor without ever being disposed of.<br>
We were already too short on personnel to investigate the cause before the first Rising Tide...<br>
We have two simple ideas regarding why.<br>
The first is that maybe there's a giant extradimensional underwater, and that is its means of attack.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Lion：</span><br>
Must be incredibly powerful, if so.<br>
<span style="color:#ffc960;">Glorious META：</span><br>
We came up with several ideas after that, but none seemed to hit the mark.<br>
We've fought extradimensionals for a long time, after all, and never have we seen one so big.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Queen Elizabeth：</span><br>
Did the Star Beast never appear?<br>
<span style="color:#ffc960;">Glorious META：</span><br>
Star Beast...?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Queen Elizabeth：</span><br>
An enormous entity that hovers in the sky and shines like a star.<br>
<span style="color:#ffc960;">Glorious META：</span><br>
Umm... I've never seen anything of the like, but if it does exist, then does that not imply the existence of an Abyssal Beast?<br>
This could be a huge discovery...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Lion：</span><br>
Let's not treat wild speculation as fact. What's your other theory?<br>
<span style="color:#ffc960;">Glorious META：</span><br>
The other regards the moon itself.<br>
Ever since the extradimensionals came alongside the meteor shower, the sky has always been covered by strange particles.<br>
You noticed that the sky was grey along the way here, I presume. That's why.<br>
Those particles make it impossible to observe the sky or the moon. The outline of the sun only appears sparsely.<br>
I digress... The Rising Tide phenomenon is related to the moon, after all.<br>
So I wonder if the moon directly causes it.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Lion：</span><br>
That sounds more credible. I like this theory.<br>
Now, what happened to Europa?<br>
<span style="color:#ffc960;">Glorious META：</span><br>
The continents are in a more... complicated situation.<br>
Nearly all coastal areas were destroyed during the war. The Sirens turned some into Mirror Turbulence areas using obfuscation systems to make them impossible to observe from the outside.<br>
When you enter one, there's a possibility that you may never be able to leave. Do take care not to approach them.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Lion：</span><br>
Hrmh, I see. Here I thought they'd blown away entire continents. That's all the questions I have.<br>
What about you, Your Majesties?<br>
<span style="color:#ffc960;">Queen Elizabeth META：</span><br>
Did we hear you right? The distress signal was sent more than 130 years ago?<br>
<br>
The META Elizabeth finally chimed in after remaining silent until this point.<br>
<span style="color:#ffc960;">Glorious META：</span><br>
To be exact, 136 years, 3 months, and 13 days.<br>
<span style="color:#ffc960;">Queen Elizabeth META：</span><br>
...It took us less than a day after receiving the signal to rush here.<br>
<span style="color:#ffc960;">Glorious META：</span><br>
Less... than one day?<br>
<span style="color:#ffc960;">Queen Elizabeth META：</span><br>
Did our reply reach you?<br>
<span style="color:#ffc960;">Glorious META：</span><br>
Yes. Half a year ago now...<br>
<span style="color:#ffc960;">Queen Elizabeth META：</span><br>
We sent it an hour before our departure.<br>
<span style="color:#ffc960;">Glorious META：</span><br>
How could this have happened...?<br>
<span style="color:#ffc960;">Queen Elizabeth META：</span><br>
Are you aware that we helped this world's Elizabeth build a time-flow synchronisation machine?<br>
<span style="color:#ffc960;">Glorious META：</span><br>
Her Majesty's precious machine... I don't know anything about its functions, but I may know its current location.<br>
<span style="color:#ffc960;">Queen Elizabeth META：</span><br>
Can you take us there?<br>
<span style="color:#ffc960;">Glorious META：</span><br>
Yes. It's in the fifth combat sector, being guarded by my fleet of mass-produced ships.<br>
<span style="color:#ffc960;">Queen Elizabeth META：</span><br>
Was that the first area to be taken by the enemy?<br>
<span style="color:#ffc960;">Glorious META：</span><br>
Absolutely not!<br>
Ah... I remember now. It started malfunctioning immediately after the extradimensionals appeared...<br>
I recall her doing everything she could to repair it.<br>
<span style="color:#ffc960;">Queen Elizabeth META：</span><br>
You mean... It malfunctioned before she was sunk, and not destroyed after?<br>
We must see it. Now. Take us.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Lion：</span><br>
We're going with you.<br>
<span style="color:#ffc960;">Glorious META：</span><br>
Okay! I'll take you there!<br>

2nd combat sector - Anti-air defense zone<br>
Queen's Light - 4th car<br>
Queen Elizabeth META and company took the Queen's Light in order to reach their destination as soon as possible.<br>
Lion's group, save for Cleopatra who stayed behind to stand guard on the Mesektet in the sky, also boarded the train.<br>
Glorious META was brought into the control cabin to lead the way, while all remaining members went into the fourth car to rest.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Lion：</span><br>
Whew. What a pleasant train. It feels like being back home again.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Trafalgar：</span><br>
Using mobile space-expansion technology for a train lounge... How exorbitantly luxurious.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Lion：</span><br>
It really is. Even on the Mesektet, we only use it in the area where all the critical equipment is concentrated.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Queen Elizabeth：</span><br>
Hah! You haven't seen anything yet. That technology is but a small part of what makes up these Mirror Rails.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Lion：</span><br>
That's incredible. Incidentally, there's something I've been meaning to ask you ever since we met.<br>
It may be rude, but I simply need to know.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Queen Elizabeth：</span><br>
Go ahead. I've got questions of my own.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Lion：</span><br>
By all means. First question: Are you really Queen Elizabeth?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Queen Elizabeth：</span><br>
What kind of question is that? Your version of me may be gone, but surely you still have pictures of her?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Trinidad：</span><br>
The only times you appear in the history books are as a name.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Gallant：</span><br>
Yup. I haven't seen an illustration or anything.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Queen Elizabeth：</span><br>
I've been to many test sites, and this is the first I've heard of something like this. What do you mean?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Lion：</span><br>
Does your world draw a difference between the concepts of "warship" and "human"?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Queen Elizabeth：</span><br>
Look around you. Could you not ask such basic questions?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Lion：</span><br>
Well, you see... In our world, Queen Elizabeth sank in the fight against the Sirens not as a human, but as a warship.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Queen Elizabeth：</span><br>
Those Sirens are truly despicable...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Lion：</span><br>
Indeed.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Queen Elizabeth：</span><br>
So then, the Sirens were enemies in your world, and you fought them?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Lion：</span><br>
Was that the case in yours?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Queen Elizabeth：</span><br>
More or less.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Lion：</span><br>
And yet, Glorious said that the Sirens were their allies in this world. How is that possible?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Queen Elizabeth：</span><br>
It depends on the test site. To elaborate would require a long-winded explanation of what the Sirens truly are, so I won't.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Lion：</span><br>
That's fine. We already defeated them anyway.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Queen Elizabeth：</span><br>
You defeated them. Interesting.<br>
So? What became of your world?<br>
If I'm not there to lead you, I presume King George V took my place.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Lion：</span><br>
No... King George V, the warship, was also sunk by the Sirens.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Queen Elizabeth：</span><br>
Those bastards. Excuse me, I should say, my condolences.<br>
Then what happened? With neither me nor George around, I presume our Parliament is in charge, then?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Lion：</span><br>
Correct. Our Realm is run by the two houses of Parliament. That being said, the two aren't as powerful as you think.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Queen Elizabeth：</span><br>
Alright. Let me make a guess.<br>
You introduced yourself as "the governor of the Nile." Do you rule in a separatist manner?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Lion：</span><br>
Hahahah. "Separatist." How libelous. I would simply say that my authority is amply respected.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Queen Elizabeth：</span><br>
Oh, I'm sure. Respected. What's your next question?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Lion：</span><br>
Hmm. That would be...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Queen Elizabeth：</span><br>
Ah, actually, wait. I'm curious about something.<br>
What became of Warspite and Valiant? What about Hood, Illustrious, and Vanguard? Or Duke of York and Prince of Wales?<br>
Also, who's the current head of the Royal Maids? Who commands the Royal Knights?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Lion：</span><br>
That's a lot that you're curious about.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Queen Elizabeth：</span><br>
From my perspective, this is like looking at the world after I died. You must understand.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Lion：</span><br>
Wales is the Realm Prime Minister, Hood is the Minister of the House of Lords, and Vanguard is the commander of the Palace Guards.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Queen Elizabeth：</span><br>
I'm surprised Vanguard's position stayed the same.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Vanguard：</span><br>
Hearing about myself from a parallel world is a rather... strange experience.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Lion：</span><br>
Hahah. The kind of experience you can only get by leaving your home.<br>
Duke of York is the Governor-General of the Maple Monarchy, Warspite is the Governor-General of the Pacific Ocean, and Illustrious is the Governor-General of the Mediterranean Sea – as well as the direct supervisor of Trafalgar.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Queen Elizabeth：</span><br>
Governor-generals, eh... I have considered that before. Seems you were the ones to implement it.<br>
So Trafalgar works under Illustrious, does she? Is she on this mission with you, then?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Lion：</span><br>
No. However, this mission was supported by both the Imperial Prime Minister and both houses of Parliament.<br>
On the day this expedition was voted on, I happened to be absent, and it was decided that I would be the one to lead it. It was also decided that the Imperial Centre and signing governors would provide me with a certain amount of support.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Queen Elizabeth：</span><br>
It sounds to me like they conspired against you.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Lion：</span><br>
Hah. Had I been present, I personally would've volunteered for the task. I will go down in history for this grand expedition.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Queen Elizabeth：</span><br>
I see. You'll earn quite a lot of fame if it's successful.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Lion：</span><br>
Heh. Precisely. By the way, Newcastle is the head of the Royal Maids, while Royal Oak is the commander of the Royal Knights.<br>
Finally, there's Valiant. She is the Governor-General of Terra Australis and the Solomon Islands. I've heard she's pursuing a third governor-generalship.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Queen Elizabeth：</span><br>
Goodness gracious... That's so like her.<br>
What about Bel?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Lion：</span><br>
Sank by the Sirens as a warship.<br>
Thus, this is my first time seeing you, Belfast.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Belfast：</span><br>
I had an inkling of that when you said that Newcastle holds my would-be position.<br>
Since Her Majesty is no longer with you, it makes sense that I am neither – for the sake of the Sirens' script.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Lion：</span><br>
May I ask a question now?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Queen Elizabeth：</span><br>
Of course.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Lion：</span><br>
Alright – were you both together with Elizabeth META?<br>
Are there two Elizabeths in your world?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Queen Elizabeth：</span><br>
No. She comes from another test site.<br>
I can probably guess why you asked that question. Sadly, the answer is: It's not possible.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Lion：</span><br>
How unfortunate. What about the other METAs?<br>
You have enough of them for an entire fleet.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Queen Elizabeth：</span><br>
They each have their own story, likely similar to that of Glorious. If you want to know more, you'll have to ask them yourself.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Lion：</span><br>
I see. If the opportunity arises, I will.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Train Announcement：</span><br>
Ding, ding, ding! Baaang! Boom, boom, boom!<br>
Attention! We're almost there! Get ready to disembark!<br>
Boom, boom, boom! Ding, ding, ding! Baaang! Boom, boom, boom!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Lion：</span><br>
What an... eccentric announcer.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Queen Elizabeth：</span><br>
Did she change it to Miss D's bloody voice pack?!<br>
Ugh... Forget it. Just think of it as some weird sound clips.<br>
Come on. Let's get off.<br>
{{折叠面板|内容结束}}

{{折叠面板|标题=Buds of the New Moon|选项=11|主框=1|样式=primary|展开=是}}
<br>
The group disembarked the luxurious train, stepping back into the desolate world.<br>
The ground beneath them wasn't much different from what they'd seen so far, but up in the ashen sky, something new caught their eyes.<br>
It was a collection of pupae surrounded by winding, sepal-like metallic structures. Each one silently hovered in the air, as if suspended by invisible strings.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Lion：</span><br>
What... are those?<br>
They don't appear to be extradimensionals. Glorious, are they some weapon of yours?<br>
<span style="color:#ffc960;">Glorious META：</span><br>
Not quite. They are what we call the "Buds of the Full Moon."<br>
They showed up around the time of the meteor shower long ago and appear exclusively on the Royal Islands.<br>
They appear and disappear with no apparent regularity, and when they return, there's always more of them.<br>
Initially, there were just a handful. Now, I think there are around... 300?<br>
<span style="color:#ffc960;">Queen Elizabeth META：</span><br>
We scanned them with the train. Those sepal-like casings are likely a safety mechanism, and we have no idea what's inside them.<br>
Have you ever tried to destroy them?<br>
<span style="color:#ffc960;">Glorious META：</span><br>
The Sirens tried and failed to destroy even a single one.<br>
However, the attempt did cause a devastating explosion that not only obliterated the Sirens' safety bunker, but also flattened the entire anchorage of Scapa Flow.<br>
As you might expect, nobody dared touch them after that.<br>
Despite their intimidating appearances, they simply float there, doing nothing.<br>
Putting them aside, over there is where the device is located – this is the Fifth Wireless Communications Laboratory.<br>
<br>
Glorious META gestured toward a large building not far from there.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Queen Elizabeth：</span><br>
Wireless Communications Laboratory? That's a good cover name.<br>
<span style="color:#ffc960;">Glorious META：</span><br>
Her Majesty perhaps thought it was amusing.<br>
Now that I think about it, one could say that I managed to make contact with you thanks to a kind of wireless communication.<br>
The Laboratory is in a rather poor state of maintenance, so it would take a lot of work to search through it.<br>
For that reason, I mobilised some heavy obstacle-clearing machines from a force nearby when we departed.<br>
But, for better or worse, the train got here so fast that the machines haven't had time to do their work. Please wait for them.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Lion：</span><br>
When we departed... Wait, where is the Mesektet?!<br>
<br>
Lion was sure she had ordered the Mesektet to follow the train after departure, and yet, it was nowhere to be seen now that she had arrived.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Queen Elizabeth：</span><br>
It fell behind because it's just too slow.<br>
Don't panic. I see it on the onboard radar and it's fine. It'll arrive sooner or later.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Lion：</span><br>
Hah. So we got here quickly only to have to wait for the machines to finish.<br>
<span style="color:#ffc960;">Queen Elizabeth META：</span><br>
We can do more than just wait. We shall perform a scan from the outside.<br>
<br>
Elizabeth META activated the train's scanner. Seeing the results, she made a gloomy expression.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Lion：</span><br>
You look ill. Lady Elizabeth, have you discovered something unfortunate?<br>
<span style="color:#ffc960;">Queen Elizabeth META：</span><br>
We found the device. It's in the Laboratory's underground section.<br>
The section is in good structural condition. Why, even some of the security systems are still operating.<br>
However... its two most important components are missing: The tracking indicator, and the inaccuracy synchroniser.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Lion：</span><br>
Missing? Did someone damage the device?<br>
<span style="color:#ffc960;">Queen Elizabeth META：</span><br>
Yes, and whoever did so knew exactly what they were doing.<br>
Those components were sealed inside the device when it was completed. Only its makers would be able to take them out without breaking the exterior.<br>
And yet, the exterior is perfectly intact, and the internals are gone.<br>
It's little wonder this world's Elizabeth couldn't fix it. She couldn't have anticipated such a confounding issue.<br>
<span style="color:#ffc960;">Glorious META：</span><br>
So the world's hope was destroyed by human hands...<br>
Who could have done this?! Can you locate the perpetrator?!<br>
<span style="color:#ffc960;">Queen Elizabeth META：</span><br>
...We shall try.<br>
<br>
In that instant, time stopped.<br>
<span style="color:#ffc960;">Queen Elizabeth META：</span><br>
Begin examination.<br>
<br>
All the surroundings expanded in different directions, forming countless overlapping images.<br>
Elizabeth META hunched forward and began looking for the exact moment the crucial change happened.<br>
<span style="color:#ffc960;">Queen Elizabeth META：</span><br>
Hrmh.<br>
Alright, there it is.<br>
Let us see who committed this horrific deed.<br>
<br>
Her examination continued, but looking around, she saw only nothingness.<br>
<span style="color:#ffc960;">Queen Elizabeth META：</span><br>
...What?<br>

<br>
Test Site Beta - Royal Navy<br>
Gate of Avalon - Silver Mirror Lake<br>
Four hours after the departure of the Queen's Light, Helena META and Memphis META arrived at the Gate of Avalon on schedule.<br>
There, they boarded a car of the train left behind by Queen Elizabeth META and dove into the Silver Mirror Lake alongside Miss D.<br>
The train door slowly opens, amidst Miss D's yelling and the announcements using her voice data.<br>
After Helena and Memphis exit first to confirm it's safe, I walk out alongside Miss D and take my first steps into the mysterious whale.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Miss D：</span><br>
Assistant! Assistant, look, look! This is my whale!<br>
It's big, huh?! WAY bigger than Elizabeth's dumb train!<br>
<br>
As soon as we've alighted, Miss D turns to me proudly. She acts as if she knows everything about the whale, but I know that isn't true.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Go play with Death's Shadow, okay? I need to look around with the METAs.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Death's Shadow：</span><br>
.........<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Miss D：</span><br>
Okay! Let's go, stalker! My assistant has important work to do!<br>
<br>
After calming her down, I start by surveying my surroundings.<br>
My first impression of the whale's interior is that it's a space of raw chaos.<br>
This space, designated by Elizabeth as a safe place to search, is approximately 300 meters in length and 200 meters in width.<br>
The highest point is nearly 100 meters high, but some spots only have two meters of vertical space.<br>
Most striking of all, though, is that all of the structures and machines in here hang down from the ceiling.<br>
<span style="color:#ffc960;">Helena META：</span><br>
So? Any thoughts?<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
My first reaction... is that it certainly wasn't made for human use.<br>
<span style="color:#ffc960;">Helena META：</span><br>
Clearly not.<br>
Is there anything else, though? Any sense that you've seen it before, or any memories it might bring back?<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Not at all. It's like I'm seeing a tourist attraction for the first time.<br>
<span style="color:#ffc960;">Helena META：</span><br>
Hmm.<br>
<span style="color:#c3abff;">Memphis META：</span><br>
Commander, I pulled up a part of the floor and found a control panel. Can you try authenticating?<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
You... pulled up the floor?<br>
<span style="color:#c3abff;">Memphis META：</span><br>
Ahem... I did it safely after a sound structural analysis. I'll put it back when we're done, I promise!<br>
<br>
I follow her to the exposed control panel.<br>
<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项1：(Attempt authentication.)</span>'''''<br>
<br>
Nothing changes on the panel.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
...Nothing happened?<br>
<br>
My Antiochus system credentials have always come in handy when I needed them, but this time, they've failed me.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Sorry, Helena, but I don't think this lead will get us anywhere. Have you found anything?<br>
<span style="color:#ffc960;">Helena META：</span><br>
I've been trying to hack into the system here since we arrived.<br>
I have found... one thing. When Devil seized this place, she added a bunch of things to the security layer.<br>
I'll have to remove them one by one.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Elizabeth told me that Devil's been trying to take total control of the whale.<br>
Does that mean that she left pitfalls to stop others from catching up while she's hacking it?<br>
<span style="color:#ffc960;">Helena META：</span><br>
Devilish, isn't it?<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Honestly, yeah.<br>
<span style="color:#c3abff;">Memphis META：</span><br>
Commander! I've uncovered another control panel. Can you try again?<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Shh. Keep this up, and Miss D's going to notice. Belay digging around for now and wait for Helena to work her magic.<br>
<span style="color:#c3abff;">Memphis META：</span><br>
Yes, Commander.<br>
<br>
RRRUMBLE...<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Hmm? Do you all hear that?<br>
<span style="color:#c3abff;">Memphis META：</span><br>
It's like an earthquake...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Miss D：</span><br>
GAAAH! This is bad! The whale's escaping again!<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Escaping? Are you saying that the whale is turning on?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Miss D：</span><br>
Yeah, yeah! Who turned my whale on?! Out with it!<br>
<span style="color:#ffc960;">Helena META：</span><br>
Something is terribly wrong. Commander, we must retreat at once.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Miss D：</span><br>
Oooh, yeah. We gotta get outta here, or else the whale's gonna take us with it!<br>
<br>
RRRUMBLE...<br>
Its struggles quickens, as if it's desperately trying to set sail for new worlds.<br>
As it rumbles, Helena, Memphis, and even the Queen's Light's cars begin to blur as the whale tries to expel them.<br>
<span style="color:#ffc960;">Helena META：</span><br>
She's got us. Memphis, stay by me.<br>
<span style="color:#c3abff;">Memphis META：</span><br>
Protect the Commander!<br>
<span style="color:#ffc960;">Helena META：</span><br>
Trust me, I was already planning to... Go, Compiler.<br>
<br>
A blue current rushes forth, and Compiler appears, equipped with her rigging.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Compiler ：</span><br>
Orders received: Protect the Commander at all costs.<br>
<span style="color:#ffc960;">Helena META：</span><br>
Don't leave your post until you hear from me.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Helena!<br>
<span style="color:#ffc960;">Helena META：</span><br>
Commander, don't leave Compiler's side. I'm going to find you ASAP.<br>
<br>
The shaking intensifies further until the METAs disappear. I can barely feel the presence of Compiler and Miss D...<br>
And then, everything goes silent.<br>
The world turns a pure white.<br>

<br>
Test Site ??? - Royal Navy<br>
5th combat sector<br>
Near target ruins<br>
When Elizabeth META began her examination, the world underwent great change.<br>
The Buds of the Full Moon, which typically only flickered in or out of existence, began to glow one after another.<br>
Extradimensionals that lay dormant across the world suddenly turned violent. Glorious received countless alerts from more than twenty combat sectors, all at once.<br>
<span style="color:#ffc960;">Glorious META：</span><br>
Everyone, the situation is rapidly deteriorating. Extradimensional hordes have awakened – the likelihood of a Beastly Tide has dramatically increased.<br>
It's too dangerous to remain here. We must return to the Rose Tower and plan countermeasures.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Lion：</span><br>
Rapidly deteriorating, you say? Is it related to the pupae suddenly glowing?<br>
<span style="color:#ffc960;">Glorious META：</span><br>
I can't be certain about anything yet. Your Majesty, we must ready the train for departure.<br>
...Miss Elizabeth?<br>
<br>
Elizabeth META did not respond to her address.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Vanguard：</span><br>
This is bad... Your Majesty, she can't hear us!<br>
<br>
It was then that everyone noticed something off about her.<br>
Her eyes were closed tight, and she didn't react to anyone's calls. It was as if she'd fallen into a deep sleep while still standing.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Queen Elizabeth：</span><br>
Even I've never seen something like this. Sheffy, what's wrong with her?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Sheffield META：</span><br>
Her Majesty is in a very distant place. Her consciousness may be temporarily absent.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Queen Elizabeth：</span><br>
There must be a big secret behind the destruction of the synchronization device.<br>
Lion, Glorious. The other Elizabeth is busy examining the destruction of the device, so she won't be able to act for the time being.<br>
Let's split up into two groups. Sheffield, lead the METAs to protect this place until she completes her examination.<br>
Everyone else will board the Mesektet and return to the Rose Tower. I trust you'll allow us to board, dear governor?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Lion：</span><br>
I'd be offended if you didn't!<br>
<span style="color:#ffc960;">Glorious META：</span><br>
You'll leave her alone here? Perhaps she could be transported to the Mesektet and brought back to the tower?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Sheffield META：</span><br>
You mustn't remove her. Do not worry – we will keep her safe.<br>
<span style="color:#ffc960;">Glorious META：</span><br>
Oh... Then I'll dispatch some Pawns to protect her.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Lion：</span><br>
Sounds like a plan. Chop-chop, Cleopatra. Land the Mesektet.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Cleopatra：</span><br>
Yes, Miss Governor. Descending now!<br>
<br>
Meanwhile, somewhere in the Tower...<br>
<span style="color:#ffc960;">Helena META：</span><br>
Position indication jammed again. It must be Magician.<br>
Tch... I should have kept watch here and had Memphis take Vestal with her instead.<br>
Stay calm, Helena.<br>
If this is her doing, then the Commander's life shouldn't be endangered.<br>
Even still, that doesn't mean that there's no danger whatsoever.<br>
That insane woman's directly picking a fight with me.<br>
No... She activated that trap the instant I left. The timing is too convenient.<br>
Devil may not need the whale anymore thanks to her, but that doesn't mean she'll readily give it away to anyone who wants it.<br>
But Magician's direct interference would change things. I see... That's why Devil kept the inside of the whale under such scrutiny once it was in Elizabeth's hands.<br>
Is she working with Devil, or is she simply using her? I don't know yet, but...<br>
Ugh... I've been blind. Even if Devil no longer needs it, she isn't the only one who would have a use for it.<br>
Magician isn't just after the whale. She's after the Commander, too...<br>
But why?<br>
This is awful. I can't sit idly by any longer.<br>
I just hope that this expedition can supplement the data missing from the Tower's database...<br>
...I'll need to pass more information on to the Ashes.<br>

<br>
Once the light fades, I find myself in a wasteland I've never seen before.<br>
The dark-blue whale has turned a yellowish black and shrunk to about two meters in size. It floats a few centimeters above the ground, making it look like an amusement park ride for children.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Miss D：</span><br>
Heeey! Assistant, look! I can ride it!<br>
I can even fly around on it!<br>
My stalker's gone, too! This trip turned out pretty rad!<br>
Woohoo! Whale flying, whale flying!<br>
<br>
Miss D gleefully rides the whale. She apparently sees this terrifying situation as a fun little trip.<br>
Meanwhile, Compiler...<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
You already built a command center?!<br>
Your compiling speed is jaw-dropping.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Compiler ：</span><br>
Not especially. Confirming information on our environs.<br>
According to the topographical map, we are currently in the Vale of Glamorgan in southern Wales.<br>
Analysis of the land composition yields traces of fierce combat in the past. However, there have been no major battles here in the past three years.<br>
I've also detected a signal left by me – by Compiler.<br>
However, there is no mainframe or similar vessel nearby.<br>
Hypothesis: This is a test site, but the experimentation division has been destroyed.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
You learned all of that just now? Impressive.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Compiler ：</span><br>
Not especially. Continuing situation analysis. Recommendation: Go to the nearby building to rest.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
No, thank you. I don't get to see you work often, so I'd like to observe.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Compiler ：</span><br>
Do as you please.<br>
<br>
Even throughout our conversation, she doesn't stop her analysis.<br>
A flock of microdrones flies out of her rigging. Some go up into the sky, some dig underground, and yet others fly toward the ocean.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
What are you doing now?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Compiler ：</span><br>
I am only able to use local resources at this moment. Without my mainframe, my capacity is limited.<br>
Thus, I am searching for repairable and dormant facilities in order to bolster my resources.<br>
If possible, I prefer to build a new mainframe as soon as possible.<br>
...There.<br>
I've found an integrated coastal military module nearby that is worthy of repair. Think of it as a modular base that has not yet been assembled.<br>
...Good. The defense module and mass-production module are both intact.<br>
We can construct a mass-produced escort fleet to defend ourselves.<br>

Elizabeth META wandered through the empty void.<br>
<span style="color:#ffc960;">Queen Elizabeth META：</span><br>
Did we fall into a trap, or did the real perpetrator leave traces when destroying the device?<br>
<br>
Narrowing her eyes, she squinted at the nothingness.<br>
Then, she crashed into the earth like a meteorite.<br>
After that, she and the extradimensionals went on a rampage.<br>
They crushed the resistance of everyone in their path – the warships, the shipgirls, and the Sirens.<br>
The world was enveloped in deathly silence, and the space reverted into a void.<br>
<span style="color:#ffc960;">Queen Elizabeth META：</span><br>
...This isn't it.<br>
Must focus harder... Must find the moment the inaccuracy synchroniser disappeared...<br>
<br>
One more time, she sharpened her focus and fixated on the nothingness.<br>
In response, the nothingness began to assume a new appearance.<br>
It became the interior of a building with advanced technology. Lights shone brightly and the air was abuzz with voices.<br>
<span style="color:#ffc960;">Queen Elizabeth META：</span><br>
There. We've found it.<br>
<br>
Elizabeth walked through the crowds and the walls, heading for the room where the synchronizer was stored.<br>
Then, she saw something – or somebody – standing in front of the device.<br>
<span style="color:#bdbdbd;">???：</span><br>
......<br>
<span style="color:#ffc960;">Queen Elizabeth META：</span><br>
It was you who broke it?<br>
What in the world are you?!<br>
Blast it... We need insight!<br>
<br>
A ruined wasteland. The extradimensionals formed a horde, and the Buds of the Full Moon were squirming.<br>
The monsters were approaching frighteningly fast, while Elizabeth META was asleep at the device. A team of META shipgirls was the only thing holding the front line.<br>
<span style="color:#ff9b93;">Star Beast：</span><br>
RUVD FVBY WSHJL (KNOW YOUR PLACE)<br>
<br>
A voice from a higher dimension broke Elizabeth's concentration, making the world fall apart for an instant.<br>
<span style="color:#ffc960;">Queen Elizabeth META：</span><br>
...The Star Beast?<br>
Heh. What do you have to do with what we just saw?<br>

<span style="color:#ffc960;">Queen Elizabeth META：</span><br>
...Who do you think you are, giving us orders?<br>
Continuing with the insight.<br>
<br>
The ruined wasteland again. The Buds of the Full Moon unfolded their sepals.<br>
Cities and the hinterlands, earth, mountains, and rivers – the surfaces of the sepals reflected many landscapes.<br>
<span style="color:#ffc960;">Queen Elizabeth META：</span><br>
(Is... each bud its own artificial Singularity?)<br>
(Did they activate hundreds of Singularities in one world all at the same time?)<br>
(Wait... What is that golden shine? Camelot? And a META Vampire is there?)<br>
(Is that the other Elizabeth's world?)<br>
(And that world, with the radiant lighthouse... Is that where Lion is from?)<br>
(What is this? Do these connect to the worlds of all those who've come here?)<br>

The pressure from the higher dimension pushed on her again.<br>

<br>
Desolation and ruination. Countless wrecks were piled up beneath the Buds of the Full Moon.<br>
The horde of extradimensionals rushed incessantly toward the pupae, only to be torn to ribbons by the entrances of the Singularities.<br>
<span style="color:#ffc960;">Queen Elizabeth META：</span><br>
(They can't pass through the Singularities?)<br>
<br>
There was no end to the horde, and their corpses kept piling. This shell of a world was turning into a graveyard for beasts.<br>

<br>
At last, the wasteland had morphed into a world of corpses.<br>
Even the sea was turned white with their remains.<br>
Time passed, and eventually, something changed.<br>
A new adversary was born amidst the wreckages.<br>
It rose from the heap of extradimensional corpses and charged at the Buds of the New Moon.<br>
This time, it passed through in one piece.<br>
One by one, the many scenes reflected in the buds were reduced to silent, dead barrens.<br>
<span style="color:#ffc960;">Queen Elizabeth META：</span><br>
(What is that? Some sort of new mimic entity?)<br>
(A mimic entity... was born from the wreckages of extradimensionals?!)<br>
(Is this the future that awaits this world?)<br>
(Was its fate sealed the moment that the synchroniser was destroyed?!)<br>
(X, it's... No... Could it be?!)<br>

<br>
The world vanished in an instant into the void.<br>
Elizabeth could neither think nor feel. Her very presence began to fade, each moment of time stretching on for an eternity.<br>

<br>
We arrived at the "repairable and dormant facility" that Compiler spoke of.<br>
On the surface, it looked like a coastal factory that was destroyed years ago.<br>
Compiler commanded her swarm of drones to pick apart the wreckages, then, after leveling the area, new sections began appearing one by one, coming together to form an expanding territory.<br>
First she established a factory, then an airport, a regular port, a radar site, strong defenses with massive cannons, and many more buildings I can't name.<br>
The factory got to work and started churning out small robots.<br>
They joined the swarm taking apart the wreckages, built pipes extending deep underground, and erected embankments and formed rivers.<br>
Finally, she built a tall control tower at the base's center which rose high above.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
(The pipes are probably for replenishing resources. The tower, then, should be used to control the Mirror Sea.)<br>
(I'm guessing she's going to use the Mirror Sea as a protective shield for her base.)<br>
<br>
While my guess wasn't necessarily wrong, what happened next showed that I'd underestimated Compiler.<br>
After the first control tower was complete, Compiler built a second one.<br>
She encased the Mirror Sea inside another Mirror Sea, then also added a mist consisting of a microlayer medley in between the two. Once that was done, she finally stopped and nodded faintly.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Compiler ：</span><br>
Ah. Commander, I've fortified and camouflaged our temporary base.<br>
Bearing in mind practical access to resource supply and computing resources, I launched five Type II mass-production lines and two Type II Enforcer series production lines. This ensures basic combat capabilities.<br>
For now, we're safe.<br>
<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项1：Glad you're so reliable!</span>'''''<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项2：What's your goal here? To buy time, or conquer the world?</span>'''''<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Compiler ：</span><br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项1）</span>'''''Thanks for the compliment.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Compiler ：</span><br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项2）</span>'''''A weird question. Buying time, obviously.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Compiler ：</span><br>
Most of my resources are currently going toward rebuilding my mainframe.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Hang on, you've even started rebuilding that?!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Compiler ：</span><br>
Its core will be operational in about 72 hours. It can be restarted at 10% of its original capacity.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
......<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Compiler ：</span><br>
I have recovered some files about this test site from my surviving mainframe database. Filtering down to the parts that should be interesting to you.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Appreciate it. If there's one thing I need now, it's intel.<br>
So, did you find anything?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Compiler ：</span><br>
I did. The serial number of this test site is SQ-4577486.<br>
The destruction of this site's Compiler was due to an attack by a horde of extradimensionals.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Wait, a horde of extradimensionals?!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Compiler ：</span><br>
I surmise that they already possess the strength to fully take over the world.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Are there any other survivors?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Compiler ：</span><br>
Yes. I've detected signs of a lost mass-produced patrol fleet unaffiliated with the Sirens.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Must be a resistance force, like the one Fritz Rumey led.<br>
Can you pinpoint where their trails converge?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Compiler ：</span><br>
I'm not yet able to perform a worldwide scan. Within my current sensor range, however, they converge upon the port of LD.<br>
...What's this? Commander, something has changed.<br>
The extradimensionals are gathering into large groups. It's likely they're preparing a large-scale attack.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Can you protect against it?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Compiler ：</span><br>
As long as we do not attack first, they are physically unable to detect us.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
When will our connection with Helena be back online?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Compiler ：</span><br>
Impossible to estimate.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Then doesn't that put LD in serious danger?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Compiler ：</span><br>
Most likely. Detecting several swarms approaching it. Fighting has already broken out at the outer periphery.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Then we should go and help them.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Compiler ：</span><br>
My orders are to protect you at all costs. This takes precedence.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
I still want you to help.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Compiler ：</span><br>
If you insist on sending me to help them, wait until after the 72 hours have elapsed.<br>
Even with only 10% of my original capacity, I'll be able to deploy more powerful weapons and create a path straight from here to LD.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
That's too long. The survivors might not hold out for that long, and even if they do, they'll suffer heavy losses in the process.<br>
We have to go to LD and rebuild the line of defense.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Compiler ：</span><br>
The transport process is very risky. I do not recommend it.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Miss D：</span><br>
What's that? You're not gonna listen to the assistant? Who do you think's in charge here, huh?!<br>
Assistant, if the albino fabricator here won't take you there, my whale and I will do it!<br>
I'll take you wherever you wanna go!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Compiler ：</span><br>
Albino fabricator...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Miss D：</span><br>
Yeah, that's right!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Compiler ：</span><br>
If you're going to do it no matter what, fine.<br>
At least wait two hours, though. I need that long to prepare the transport.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Alright. Thank you.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Compiler ：</span><br>
No need. I'm only doing what I must.<br>

Port of LD - Rose Tower<br>
Lion's group arrived back at the Rose Tower with the Mesektet. Glorious ran straight for the war room and began commanding the counterattack across all combat sectors.<br>
It reminded Elizabeth and Lion alike that the Royal Navy of this world was completely different from the one they knew.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Lion：</span><br>
Factories hidden in the mountains, river after river dug out in the plains...<br>
By Jove, there are even purposefully flooded sections to speed up the mobilisation of Pawns and mass-produced ships.<br>
They've torn the country to shreds.<br>
<span style="color:#ffc960;">Glorious META：</span><br>
Even so, we keep fighting.<br>
Our glory would be tarnished if we let them run amok in our own homeland.<br>
Miss Elizabeth, I've spotted a large group of enemies in the direction of the Fifth Wireless Communications Laboratory.<br>
Are you still unable to reach your META counterpart? Shall I send reinforcements her way?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Queen Elizabeth：</span><br>
I still can't reach her.<br>
Fear not, however. Her escorts are the finest there are. It may seem like they're being pushed back, but they're simply being cautious out of a lack of information on the enemy.<br>
Send your forces to the sectors that need them the most.<br>
If we can help in any way, just say it. It's why we came here in the first place.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Lion：</span><br>
I concur. Don't walk on eggshells for our sake.<br>
Whilst the enemy is numerous, it is readily apparent that they're uncoordinated.<br>
If they're going to attack the Rose Tower, we may as well meet them outside.<br>
<span style="color:#ffc960;">Glorious META：</span><br>
Understood. In all honesty, something odd is currently transpiring in the Wales sector, and I don't know what to do about it.<br>
The Royal Islands are presently divided into 12 combat sectors. Most of my forces are concentrated in areas one through six – the ones surrounding the Rose Tower.<br>
The Wales sector is number nine, and I am frankly at a loss as to handle the situation there.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Lion：</span><br>
Say no more. We'll deal with it.<br>
Would you happen to know anything about what's happening there?<br>
<span style="color:#ffc960;">Glorious META：</span><br>
Shortly after the extradimensionals appeared, I detected signs that a Siren fleet had come back online in the area.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Lion：</span><br>
Wait, a Siren fleet? Didn't they completely vanish from this world over 100 years ago?<br>
<span style="color:#ffc960;">Glorious META：</span><br>
Correct. However, I am sure that it is them – I caught footage of swarm drones repairing one of their former factories.<br>
My latest intel shows that they've formed a fleet and are currently cutting through the horde of extradimensionals.<br>
They've entered the flooded region through the Bristol Channel, and I believe they're heading toward the Rose Tower.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Trafalgar：</span><br>
If they're the Sirens from your world, doesn't that make them allies?<br>
<span style="color:#ffc960;">Glorious META：</span><br>
Most likely, yes, since despite them having sighted my monitoring stations en route, they did not destroy them.<br>
Here. These are pictures that my hidden cameras took.<br>
<br>
Glorious brought up numerous photographs on the war room's screen.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Trinidad：</span><br>
Hm... Yeah, those are Sirens for sure.<br>
Judging by their make, they're mass-produced ships and Enforcers of the Type II variety.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Gallant：</span><br>
What the–?! Is that a baby whale among them? It's adorable!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Vanguard：</span><br>
...Did you say, "A baby whale"?<br>
Your Majesty... doesn't it greatly resemble the stuffed whale that Miss D has?<br>
Also, while the picture is rather blurry, isn't that outline of Miss D herself, riding the whale?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Queen Elizabeth：</span><br>
What... in the...<br>
...This is bad news.<br>
Lion, start the Mesektet at once! We must go to support them immediately!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Lion：</span><br>
Hm? First time I've seen you this stressed.<br>
Is that little whale an acquaintance of yours, Lady Elizabeth?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Queen Elizabeth：</span><br>
I'll explain on the way. There is no time to waste.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Lion：</span><br>
Alright, alright.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Trafalgar：</span><br>
Um, your destination is in an active combat zone. Are you sure you want to take the Mesektet?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Lion：</span><br>
I'll set it down in the water before we get there. If we're going to fight, we'll do it on our home turf.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Trafalgar：</span><br>
A wise decision.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Lion：</span><br>
Cleopatra, ready the ship! We're setting off!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">A Rose on the High Tower

KABOOOM!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Compiler ：</span><br>
Commander, status update. A third force is approaching from the northeast.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
The northeast? Must be the local resistance force.<br>
From what I read in your files, the Sirens that stayed here had an alliance with the previous local powers. Is that correct?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Compiler ：</span><br>
Yes. Without a doubt.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Then it's possible they think we're their former allies who've come back to life, so they sent reinforcements our way.<br>
I was unsure whether to reach out to them. Guess they're making the first move now.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Miss D：</span><br>
Whoa! Look, assistant! There are golden lions flying in the air!<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
What? Golden lions?<br>
<br>
I turn my gaze upward and see no lions of any kind, only flying units engaged in combat.<br>
<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项1：How'd you see the lions?</span>'''''<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项2：Did the whale tell you that?</span>'''''<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Miss D：</span><br>
I dunno... I just know I saw them!<br>
It's fine if you can't see them! I'll go and call the lions over!<br>
Whale, take off!<br>
<br>
<br>
Compiler's transport plan proved a lot simpler than I anticipated.<br>
That being – after two hours of prepping as best as she could, she'd take the shortest route to the port of LD, charging through enemies on the way.<br>
As expected, or perhaps as not expected, our fleet has ended up in a stalemate with an army of extraterrestrials in the Bristol Channel.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Miss D：</span><br>
Hey, albino fabricator! Why have we not moved an inch after all that fighting?!<br>
Do something about this!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Compiler ：</span><br>
The enemy has grouped up, making them stronger than the sum of their parts.<br>
Calculating the relation between size of force and combat capabilities now.<br>
Enemy is more numerous than predicted. We must slow down for safety's sake and wait for more production lines to come online.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Miss D：</span><br>
Then why are you building a fort here?!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Compiler ：</span><br>
It is necessary to preserve our momentum.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Miss D：</span><br>
Urgh... Too slow! TOO SLOW!<br>
Who knows when we're gonna get there at THIS speed?!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Compiler ：</span><br>
Arrival within the next 72 hours is guaranteed.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Miss D：</span><br>
That's just as long as you said before!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Compiler ：</span><br>
Negative. The previous 72-hour plan did not account for travel time. The current plan assures arrival within the next 72 hours.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Miss D：</span><br>
UUURRRGGGHHH!<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
(Her going with a tactic like this is pretty consistent with her modus operandi.)<br>
(We can't afford to take our sweet time, though.)<br>
(Need to come up with a plan... Hmm. I really should contact the survivors in the area.)<br>
(They may not be able to send support, but even intel on their waterways would be a godsend.)<br>
<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Miss D：</span><br>
Liooon!<br>
Hey! Big, glowing lion with wings!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Gallant：</span><br>
Eh? Trinidad, is it just me, or is that whale down there charging at us?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Trinidad：</span><br>
Looks like it. I think there's someone riding it, too!<br>
The whale doesn't seem to have any weapons. She'll hurt herself if she collides with us!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Gallant：</span><br>
Quick, we have to save her!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Miss D：</span><br>
Heeere I cooome!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Trinidad：</span><br>
Careful!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Gallant：</span><br>
Hey, it's fine! I caught her!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Miss D：</span><br>
Woohoo! I flew like a bird!<br>
Whoa! There's a whistle-blower and a scorpion lady on this lion! Hello!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Gallant：</span><br>
...A what?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Trinidad：</span><br>
What scorpion lady?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Miss D：</span><br>
That's you!<br>
Come on! You need to go see the assistant!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Gallant：</span><br>
The who?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Trinidad：</span><br>
What are you talking about?<br>
<br>
After Miss D boarded a lion like she'd wanted, I managed to get in touch with Elizabeth aboard the Mesektet.<br>
We had a brief information exchange and I learned the gist of this world. As one might expect, though, I initially wasn't sure how to react.<br>
First, there's Lion and her team coming from a world where Elizabeth is no more...<br>
Then there's the miracle of me ending up in the same place as the Elizabeths did...<br>
And how all three groups mistook each other for the fighting force native to this world.<br>
Naturally, Elizabeth was quite shocked to learn about the whale having shrunk and Compiler accompanying me.<br>
At any rate, Compiler rebuilt a defense line and bolstered her aerial forces, after which I boarded the Mesektet with the rest and headed for the Rose Tower in the port of LD.<br>
As for Miss D, she apparently chose to ride the "flying lion."<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
I have to ask – what ARE those flying lions?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Lion：</span><br>
Heh. Well, $1, they are the Mesektet's secret weapon. I cannot share more than that as it is confidential.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Miss D：</span><br>
They're just mass-produced Siren ships that you put solid hologram overs!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Lion：</span><br>
Ahem...<br>
Cleopatra, start the ship!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Cleopatra：</span><br>
But Miss Governor, Trafalgar has yet to come on board.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Lion：</span><br>
Just send one of the Luxwing Lions out to her.<br>
She didn't seem very keen on flying, but I'd hate for her to pass on such an unforgettable experience. Now start the engine!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Cleopatra：</span><br>
As you say.<br>

<br>
The Mesektet's thorn-like, winding metal structure retreated, a curtain of orange light lifted, and the Mesektet finally landed on the Rose Tower.<br>
I did not see a welcome party of Pawns like Elizabeth described, no doubt due to the dire situation on the front. Glorious META offered her apologies for this.<br>
Naturally, Elizabeth and I both assured her that it was fine that she didn't have the leeway for a grand reception.<br>
On the way here, Elizabeth shared with me as much intel as she could. Compared to what little Compiler gathered, she broadly understood what calamity was taking place in this world.<br>
Some of it I'd seen in Rumey's world before – extradimensionals attacked, and the Sirens were destroyed.<br>
In this world, however, the Star Beast hadn't shown itself.<br>
Additionally, the extradimensionals in this world are much stronger than those of Rumey's world, as we learned while carrying out Compiler's plan.<br>
I speculate that the reason the Star Beast didn't show up was that the extradimensionals already present were enough to wipe out the Sirens. It never needed to appear.<br>
While examining the battlefield map in the war room, it hit me how the Royal Navy defined its sectors in an unusual way.<br>
The map didn't use the modern-day regions of the Royal Islands, but rather the ones from the Heptarchy period of its history.<br>
I asked Glorious about it, and she explained with an awkward smile: "This way, it makes the Rose Tower the heart of all the combat sectors."<br>
Indeed it does. The Rose Tower is the core of this world's resistance force, so it only makes sense to divide the areas of operation around it.<br>
She has been fighting like this for a hundred years. She fought until she was the last one standing.<br>
If that isn't emblematic of her name, I don't know what is.<br>
Sometime later, the Queen's Light also landed by the Rose Tower, carrying Elizabeth META.<br>
She had some rather concerning news to share.<br>
The Buds of the Full Moon were going to bloom one day, which would open a tunnel of Singularities connecting to countless worlds.<br>
X's mimic beasts are born from the wreckages of extradimensionals, and they will eventually push through the Singularities and bring destruction to all those worlds.<br>
Two especially notable worlds are linked to those Singularities: Test site beta, and Lion's homeworld.<br>
However, the one who stole the inaccuracy synchronizer as well as the Star Beast have yet to show themselves.<br>
Since Elizabeth exhausted herself by overusing her power, she'll have to stay on the train and rest for a while.<br>
It's all up to us now. We need to do something.<br>
Port of LD - Rose Tower<br>
War Room<br>
<span style="color:#ffc960;">Glorious META：</span><br>
The horde of extradimensionals has the Buds of the Full Moon. It's almost like they're waiting for the sepals to open.<br>
It's proving rather probable that what Miss Elizabeth META said is true.<br>
I never would've thought there existed something even more terrifying than the extradimensionals...<br>
Worse yet, these foul creatures will invade many more worlds through the buds, wreaking destruction on your homes as well.<br>
I'm truly sorry. I did not anticipate that I would embroil you in this disaster...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Lion：</span><br>
Do not be sorry. We are sworn allies.<br>
Nobody has said the buds cannot be destroyed. We need merely destroy them all before it's too late.<br>
The collateral damage that stopped you from destroying them before no longer matters. In fact, it may help to reduce the enemy's numbers.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
How many Buds are there across the Royal Islands? Can we even be sure that this is the only place where they exist?<br>
<span style="color:#ffc960;">Glorious META：</span><br>
Back when I still had contact with other countries, I verified that they had appeared nowhere else.<br>
As for how many there are... There is no exact figure. I don't have many monitoring stations across sectors 8 through 12.<br>
However, based on current data, I estimate that there are somewhere over 400 of them in existence.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Over 400... It'd be impossible to destroy them all.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Lion：</span><br>
The solution is right under your nose.<br>
Why must we consider destroying ALL of them?<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Because each and every one of them connects to a whole world.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Lion：</span><br>
Regardless, our power is limited.<br>
It's simply a fact that we cannot save everyone.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
...You're right. We can only do so much.<br>
Still, I will stop at nothing to destroy the bud that leads to my world. Whatever it takes.<br>
Elizabeth META, can you locate those two buds?<br>
<span style="color:#ffc960;">Queen Elizabeth META：</span><br>
Of course. We remember them vividly...<br>
We sorted the coordinates after we got back.<br>
*cough cough*... They've been processed. Sending them to you now...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Communicator：</span><br>
BEEP BEEP!<br>
<span style="color:#ffc960;">Glorious META：</span><br>
Coordinates received, Miss Elizabeth.<br>
Let's see... One is in the southwest of Wales, by the waters of the Vale of Glamorgan. The other is on the Isle of Wight in the Wessex sector.<br>
It's close to the location where you first arrived.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
(The Vale of Glamorgan – that's where Compiler erected all those structures.)<br>
(Then I don't need to worry THAT much about the bud there.)<br>
The sooner we deal with the risk, the better. Let's split up.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Lion：</span><br>
I concur. We should each dispose of the bud connected to our own world, yes?<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
No, because it'll make one of our teams significantly weaker. You'll struggle, Lion.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Lion：</span><br>
Yes. You are correct.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
......<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Lion：</span><br>
Ahaha... Then you'll have to share some of your forces with us.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Queen Elizabeth：</span><br>
Take my META counterpart's subordinates with you. I, my own subordinates, and Compiler will accompany my servant here.<br>
<span style="color:#ffc960;">Queen Elizabeth META：</span><br>
No... Your group shall go with Lion, whilst we will come with the Commander.<br>
We are the only one able to pilot the Queen's Light... Going separately from us expands your selection of tactics.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Queen Elizabeth：</span><br>
You're right. I overlooked that.<br>
Alright – servant, you'll go with my META counterpart. I will bring my followers along to support Lion.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Good. Now we have two balanced teams.<br>
Ideally, we should bolster the Rose Tower's defenses as well. For all we know, the Star Beast might show up out of nowhere.<br>
<span style="color:#ffc960;">Queen Elizabeth META：</span><br>
Hunter, you'll stay behind.<br>
<span style="color:#ffc960;">Hunter META：</span><br>
Roger. Glorious, tell me if I can help with anything.<br>
<span style="color:#ffc960;">Glorious META：</span><br>
Much obliged.<br>
<br>
And so, we split into two groups and boarded the Queen's Light and the Mesektet, respectively, and departed from the Rose Tower.<br>
Elizabeth, Belfast, Vanguard, Renown META, and Repulse META will provide support for Lion.<br>
Meanwhile, Elizabeth META will be accompanied by her subordinates along with Miss D, Compiler, and me.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
(This will be my first time commanding both Sirens and METAs at the same time.)<br>
(That sure sounds like the kind of lineup the United Council fought X with.)<br>
(Alright. Time to take these mimic entities head on!)<br>

<br>
On account of its proximity to the Rose Tower, the Wessex sector has always been firmly under Glorious' control.<br>
Furthermore, since almost all the extradimensionals are moving toward the Buds of the New Moon, the airspace between here and the Isle of Wight was comparatively clear.<br>
This allowed Lion to pilot the Mesektet to the Isle in record time. Once we disembarked onto the sea, the shipgirls assumed battle formations and engaged the enemy in direct combat.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Lion：</span><br>
Whew... Once we're below the bud, we can set down the high-yield explosives that Elizabeth META supplied us with.<br>
I brought extra just to be safe, and asked Glorious to provide aerial support. One might call it double insurance.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Queen Elizabeth：</span><br>
I think her explosives should more than suffice. Knowing her, she probably already gave you more than needed.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Lion：</span><br>
Better to be safe than sorry when so much is at stake. I also brought my own bombs for the purpose of the expedition.<br>
I thought I'd use them to blow up a mountain to make a base or somesuch. Instead, they'll be used to bring down a giant.<br>
We spent unimaginable amounts of resources to construct just one Singularity, and here are over 400 ones just "growing in the wild."<br>
And now, I must destroy one of them with my own hands, lest everything I hold dear vanish in a heartbeat.<br>
Heh... Just yesterday, I was sitting by the bank of the Nile, looking forward to a new era.<br>
Today, I'm caught in a battle to the death with an incomprehensible foe, facing a crisis that involves the survival of my world.<br>
How do I put it? It feels like being in a bizarre dream.<br>
The situation makes me want to tender my resignation. I have no idea how I will write a report on all this when I return...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Queen Elizabeth：</span><br>
Thinking about writing reports at this time? You must utterly adore your job.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Lion：</span><br>
My mind is a mess currently. The only way I can calm myself down is by thinking about work.<br>
You seem like you're used to high-stakes situations such as this, Your Majesty. Care to share some nuggets of wisdom?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Queen Elizabeth：</span><br>
Me? Do I really look like I'm taking this well?<br>
Hmm. Perhaps I am. I've been through so many life-or-death battles that I stopped counting.<br>
Everyone's life is different, so while I can't give you any advice on dealing with stress, I can share my mindset with you.<br>
My homeworld was a Siren test site. It was also a prison we could not leave.<br>
Sure, a prison where you'd be fed and clothed, but there was danger everywhere if you took one step outside.<br>
Even if a prison is comfortable, should you be content with living and dying by the whims of its warden?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Lion：</span><br>
In our case, we eliminated the warden and gained some freedom for ourselves.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Queen Elizabeth：</span><br>
That you did. Now, are you going to let your world be destroyed by an unknown danger, like what happened to those reflected in the buds?<br>
It's dangerous outside the cage. We all knew that. But now, we have freedom.<br>
And with freedom comes the right to choose.<br>
You can learn about your enemies, you can grow stronger, you can explore the unknown – you can keep chasing after hope.<br>
One day, you'll have gotten through the true danger, and then, a glorious future won't seem like a pipe dream anymore. Do you know what I mean?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Lion：</span><br>
A noble perspective. Thank you.<br>
I think I can picture the outline of that report now.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Queen Elizabeth：</span><br>
Glad I could help.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Lion：</span><br>
As for the distress signal we both received...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Queen Elizabeth：</span><br>
What about it?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Lion：</span><br>
The signal we received contained a message: "In the name of the Eternal Sun."<br>
What is this "Eternal Sun"? Is it some sort of code word used in your alliance?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Queen Elizabeth：</span><br>
Something like that. According to my other self, it's a plan to recruit allies from beyond worlds of our own – the Eternal Sun Project.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Lion：</span><br>
Then I would like to formally request to join. I want to be part of this project.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Queen Elizabeth：</span><br>
Do you mean as a representative of your country, or in your capacity as the Governor of the Nile?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Lion：</span><br>
I'm not sure yet... For now, the latter.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Queen Elizabeth：</span><br>
That can be arranged. As to-be allies, I naturally have no plans of meddling with the affairs of your world.<br>
You're permitted to join the Eternal Sun Project. Alternatively, we can form a temporary alliance.<br>
However, I ultimately do hope to establish a formal alliance with the entirety of your Royal Navy.<br>
You see what I'm driving at, don't you?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Lion：</span><br>
Of course. I pray that we can form a cooperative arrangement.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Queen Elizabeth：</span><br>
Good. Since we're true allies now, I want to ask something that's been weighing on me.<br>
You said you "defeated" the Sirens – does that mean you destroyed all of their mainframes?<br>
Like the one under the ice sheets in Antarctica. Did you deal with it?<br>
<br>
Meanwhile...<br>
Unlike the well-defended Wessex that Lion's team was passing through, Wales and Cornwall had almost nothing in the way of allied forces stationed there.<br>
Not only would fighting there be extremely dangerous, but it was also impossible for the Queen's Light to cut right through it to our destination.<br>
The silver lining was that we had more than enough firepower.<br>
The combined onslaught of the Sirens and the METAs was ruthless. The extradimensionals were forced to fall back.<br>
Soon after, we'd reached our destination below the bud.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
(This was a lot easier than when I fought alongside the Iron Blood's Resistance.)<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Miss D：</span><br>
We got here fast this time! Good job, albino!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Compiler ：</span><br>
......<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Miss D：</span><br>
And you, Elizabeth! Good job on you, too!<br>
<span style="color:#ffc960;">Queen Elizabeth META：</span><br>
Praising us now, are you? Stop being cheeky, lest we suspend your snacks.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Miss D：</span><br>
Nooo! I'm sorry! Uh... How are your wounds?<br>
<span style="color:#ffc960;">Queen Elizabeth META：</span><br>
Just fine. There is yet to be any sign of the bud opening, but anything could happen. Keep your guard up and let's go.<br>
<span style="color:#ffc960;">Grenville META：</span><br>
Your Majesty, Compiler has begun placing the high-yield explosives!<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Are you sure bombs will really do the trick?<br>
<span style="color:#ffc960;">Queen Elizabeth META：</span><br>
It's hard to tell how durable the inside is on account of how well-isolating the sepal is.<br>
However, based on the destructive power of her weaponry in previous missions, we think it'll be more than enough.<br>
We also have a backup plan of bombarding the bud from a distance with the train's weapons. You need not worry.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
So much is on the line here, though. I can't help but worry until it's been thoroughly destroyed.<br>
<br>
I stare at the Bud of the Full Moon floating in the air.<br>
All of a sudden, the sepal opens and the bud begins to bloom. Its inside reveals a continuously changing space.<br>
The very next moment, Miss D's whale just as suddenly grows rapidly in size – from 5 meters, to 10, to 50...<br>
The whale leaps into the air, Miss D still riding it, and it charges straight into the center of the bud.<br>
{{折叠面板|内容结束}}

{{折叠面板|标题=Bridge to the Beyond|选项=21|主框=1|样式=primary|展开=是}}
<br>
The world is vast, dark, without bounds.<br>
I feel as if I weigh nothing as Miss D and I are sucked into it.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
(What in the world...)<br>
(Where's Miss D?!)<br>
<br>
I frantically search my surroundings and find her floating alongside Death's Shadow nearby.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
(Wait... I'm floating, too?)<br>
<br>
It feels as if we're soaring through the void alongside the whale.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
(My mind isn't being torn away from me or dissolving into the void. Is the whale protecting me?)<br>
(Whatever the case, where are we going right now?)<br>
<br>
I try calling out to Miss D, but she doesn't react, as if she's deep asleep.<br>
After an unknown stretch of time, stars finally begin to dot the empty blackness.<br>
Buds bloom, and various fragments pass us by.<br>
Among them, I see Fritz Rumey.<br>
She's leading a Resistance fleet to take back lost homelands after the repair of the purification device and defeat of the Star Beast.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Fritz Rumey：</span><br>
The enemy's formation is breaking. Don't let up! Drive them back once and for all!<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
(Does this bud connect to her world?)<br>
<br>
Next, I see Raffaello.<br>
After the restoration of the Sardegnia League, she holds a personal exhibition in Florence. Her paintings display scenes from her dreams.<br>
Most conspicuous among them is a portrait of a girl wearing a black crown.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Raffaello：</span><br>
Wanna know exclusive, never-before-seen things about Her Holiness Marco Polo? Come see my exhibition!<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
(I see this one goes to Raffaello's world.)<br>
<br>
Images weave into one another like an endlessly morphing dream.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
No... This isn't a dream.<br>
They're all reality. They're events happening right now in the worlds that these buds are connected to.<br>
If the bud blooms and the mimic entities get into each world... then it's all over.<br>
Over 400 buds. Over 400 worlds.<br>
I could split my forces into two groups. One to destroy the bud leading to Rumey's world, and the other to destroy Raffaello's...<br>
But what comes next?<br>
Do we just wait and watch while every other world is destroyed?<br>
Every world has its own history, its own people, and its own future.<br>
I can't be complicit in this.<br>
But...<br>
<br>
When will they bloom?<br>
Is there enough time?<br>
Are we strong enough?<br>
How many sacrifices are worth it?<br>
How many can we save?<br>
How many must we abandon?<br>
Which do we rescue?<br>
Which do we let die?<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
......<br>
I'm too powerless.<br>
Even with all of my resources, power, and knowledge...<br>
It's nothing in the face of real crisis.<br>
<br>
Do I give up?<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
I can't give up.<br>
This is all wrong. I have to do something about it!<br>
<span style="color:#c3abff;">???：</span><br>
"This is all wrong."<br>
"I have to do something about it."<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
What?!<br>
<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项1：Miss D?</span>'''''<br>

'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项3：You two are...</span>'''''<br>
<span style="color:#c3abff;">???：</span><br>
BEEP BEEP!<br>
Engaging Death's Bridge.<br>
BEEP BEEP!<br>
Switching to real-time communication.<br>
BEEP BEEP!<br>
Attempting communication.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
What... are you doing?<br>
<br>
There is no response. Miss D and Death's Shadow continue their mechanical, mirrored soliloquy.<br>
<span style="color:#c3abff;">???：</span><br>
BEEP BEEP!<br>
BEEP BEEP!<br>
BEEP BEEP!<br>
Hello? Death? Why have you contacted me through Death's Bridge?<br>
What's going on? Do you need me to come there?<br>
...You're silent. Are you in a situation where you can't speak freely?<br>
Don't worry. Remain calm. I'll be there right away.<br>
Call ended. Closing Death's Bridge.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
That voice was so familiar...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">???：</span><br>
Huh? Why did you push that button?<br>
What did you screw up this time, Hierophant?<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Now I remember.<br>
It's her...<br>
The Chariot VII!<br>

<br>
Suddenly, I find that I'm beneath the Bud of the Full Moon again.<br>
Miss D is still on her tiny whale, and Compiler's still setting up high-yield explosives. It's as if everything in that dark space never happened.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
(Everything's quiet. Nobody noticed a thing, but I'm certain that everything that just happened was real.)<br>
<span style="color:#ffc960;">Queen Elizabeth META：</span><br>
Did you just experience something... uncanny?<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
(Huh?!)<br>
Elizabeth? Did you see it, too?<br>
<span style="color:#ffc960;">Queen Elizabeth META：</span><br>
No... Our level of insight has fallen for the time being due to our injuries. We only noticed thanks to a warning issued by the Queen's Light.<br>
Now, what did you see?<br>
Ah, wait a moment. Leave the experience aside and only state your conclusion for the time being.<br>
In short, what must we do?<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
The two buds we were originally planning to destroy won't be enough.<br>
We need to destroy all of them. Don't leave a single one intact.<br>
<span style="color:#ffc960;">Queen Elizabeth META：</span><br>
...Even were we in tip-top shape, this would be outright impossible.<br>
Our combined efforts can destroy more, yes, but we still must pick and choose.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Don't worry. Reinforcements are on their way.<br>
<span style="color:#ffc960;">Queen Elizabeth META：</span><br>
...Reinforcements?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Miss D：</span><br>
Gaaaah! Assistant, Elizabeth! The bud... It's moving!<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
What?!<br>
<br>
As indicated, the sepals on the Bud of the Full Moon slowly open. The horde in the distance begins to writhe in unison with them.<br>
<span style="color:#ffc960;">Queen Elizabeth META：</span><br>
Oh, no... We don't have much time until it blooms.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Let's destroy this one as planned right away. Then, we return to the Rose Tower... We'll have Lion's fleet meet up with us there.<br>
Things are changing by the second. We need to make a new plan!<br>
<br>
Later...<br>
The first stage of the operation went smoothly. Our high-yield explosives had successfully destroyed the Bud of the Full Moon.<br>
Everyone successfully retreated to the tower before it exploded, as well.<br>
However, many other buds around the Royal Islands unfolded their sepals and bloomed, creating Singularities that connected to other worlds.<br>
The extradimensional horde washed upon the buds like a tidal wave before being ripped to shreds by them. It was exactly like what Elizabeth META had seen.<br>
During this meeting, I tell all of our allies about the need to destroy every single bud.<br>
I add that the Arbiter named Chariot is on her way to this world with an army of Antiochus.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Lion：</span><br>
Hmm... Destroying every bud in order to protect every world, eh?<br>
You're ambitious. I like that.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Trafalgar：</span><br>
Lion, you can't be seriously considering...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Lion：</span><br>
I haven't said yes yet.<br>
Commander, your goals are lofty, but you haven't convinced us all that they're feasible yet.<br>
Let me ask two questions before I'm satisfied.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Go on.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Lion：</span><br>
You've told us about the relationship between the Sirens and Antiochus, as well as the experimentation division.<br>
But first, when is Chariot coming? Will she be here before the mimic entities appear?<br>
Second, can we even rely on her? Or is she going to kill us along with them?<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
I don't know exactly when she'll be here, but we were using an emergency communication channel.<br>
Given the Arbiters' usual quick action, she should get here on time.<br>
Regarding your second question... The X and the Antiochus always fight until one side is eradicated.<br>
Even if she did try to kill us too, she'd only do it once the X threat was all gone. We should have plenty of time to escape.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Lion：</span><br>
I'm hearing a whole lot of "should."<br>
Lives are on the line here. If you cannot be sure yourself, I am not convinced either.<br>
...Though, I do like your courage. As big of a gamble as it might be...<br>
If we win, we can save hundreds of worlds and build a relationship with an Arbiter.<br>
If we lose... Hah. I'm happy to accept the fruits of victory, but I'm not interested in the burden of defeat.<br>
If things look bleak, my people and I take our leave. Don't blame us for that.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
I won't. We're ready to retreat if necessary, too.<br>
I want to save as many worlds as I can, but I also want to avoid unnecessary sacrifice. That includes myself and my friends.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Lion：</span><br>
Good. Then let's discuss details.<br>
Our only ray of hope is Chariot leading an army of Antiochus in and annihilating all the mimic entities.<br>
But we don't know when they'll arrive, and once enough corpses pile up, the mimic entities are guaranteed to come.<br>
What can we actually DO here?<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
We can spread out the extradimensional corpses as much as possible.<br>
If we draw their attention and disperse them across a wider area, rather than piling up their corpses near the Buds of the Full Moon, we may delay their arrival.<br>
Even if the mimic entities do appear, we can buy time if they appear in an area of our choosing rather than near the buds.<br>
<span style="color:#ffc960;">Glorious META：</span><br>
In that case, what if we draw them toward the Rose Tower itself?<br>
It is a symbol of the Royal Navy and this very world. As long as it stands, we will live on forever.<br>
Any hostiles who encroach upon us, land or water, are those who hope for our downfall.<br>
And if that be their desire, then they must first destroy the Rose Tower.<br>
<span style="color:#ffc960;">Queen Elizabeth META：</span><br>
Hmm? A symbol of the Royal Navy...?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Lion：</span><br>
No way... Was this tower a conceptual weapon all this time?!<br>
<span style="color:#ffc960;">Glorious META：</span><br>
Indeed. If I change it to interception mode, the horde is sure to target it.<br>
When they do, we can divide them into combat sectors and conquer them one-by-one.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Queen Elizabeth：</span><br>
Not a bad plan... Your thoughts, servant?<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
We have the home-field advantage by the tower. A defensive battle is the best place to take advantage of Compiler's strengths, too.<br>
Let's go with this strategy.<br>
<span style="color:#ffc960;">Glorious META：</span><br>
Then I will change the tower's mode. Give me three hours, if you'd please.<br>
This will be our final moment of rest before a battle without end. Relax as much as you can manage, everyone.<br>

<br>
Test Site SQ-4577486<br>
Royal Islands - Rose Tower<br>
As the Rose Tower entered charging mode, the walls of nearby buildings were gradually encased in light.<br>
Having temporarily left the front, Glorious used the remaining time to host a tea party, hoping to socialize with the other METAs.<br>
Lion and Elizabeth went together to discuss the details of their alliance. They didn't want to leave ambiguities in the event of an emergency retreat.<br>
As for me, I went to Repulse META and Renown META to talk about the things that happened in the past.<br>
...I should add that my intention with this wasn't to stop them from going to the tea party.<br>
It's just that Repulse calmly murmured that she "can sympathize with the girl, but at least she had tea to drink for the past 100 years." She didn't seem too keen on going to the tea party.<br>
I'm glad no one else heard that sad line.<br>
<span style="color:#ffc960;">Renown META ：</span><br>
So you wish to know what happened in world alpha...<br>
As you may or may not know, everyone who left alpha, including us, has more or less forgotten everything about that place. Or rather, we have false memories.<br>
Furthermore, we are completely unaware of this issue until we realise it on our own.<br>
What this means is that, frankly, even I am not sure how much of my memories are true.<br>
That being said, I do vividly remember the thing you want to know about.<br>
"Fight until the last light has faded" – that was indeed the order that the Council gave us at the time.<br>
You may also already know that there are no survivors from the Northern Parliament among the Ashes.<br>
The reason for that is very simple. They all sank in battle.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
All of them...<br>
<span style="color:#c3abff;">Pamiat' Merkuria META：</span><br>
And you called ME driven by obsession! You should have a good look in the mirror!<br>
Project Dawn is the biggest obsession of them all!<br>
You think it's your ray of hope? You couldn't be more wrong. It's an express ticket to your downfall.<br>
Just being close to it brings misfortune.<br>
Do you know what happened to the people involved in this project? I can tell you.<br>
Don't answer. I'll tell you either way.<br>
The project planner went out with a fleet to test a new experimental device. Then... Poof! None of them were ever seen again!<br>
Then the project was suspended and became an accessory to a separate project.<br>
And when that project started, our entire fleet, as well as our last admiral, were all sacrificed! Not a single survivor!<br>
"Fight until the last light has faded."<br>
That's what they all said. They all fought to their deaths and let someone else have their chance to live!<br>
This is what Project Dawn is! This is the obsession that's been passed down!<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Was their sinking related to Project Dawn? Why did the Northern Parliament give up on retreating?<br>
<span style="color:#ffc960;">Renown META ：</span><br>
It was because someone had to protect the Auroral City and maintain the weather conditions required for a retreat.<br>
The Parliament had always been the one pushing for Project Dawn. It was also the Parliament that volunteered to perform this final undertaking.<br>
After the "fight until the last light has faded" order was issued, the Parliament's final naval commander – Admiral Mikhail – took his fleet and set sail.<br>
That was the last thing I witnessed with my own eyes, and it was the end of the Northern Parliament in world alpha.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Admiral... Mikhail?<br>
(Hang on a moment...)<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Dr. Aoste：</span><br>
If we adopt this plan, there may be a chance of success.<br>
However, we must ensure that the jamming device remains operational as long as possible. In the meantime, we’ll have to hold the line while evacuations are carried out.<br>
In other words...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Mikhail：</span><br>
We already know this, Dr. Aoste. We’ve taken it upon ourselves to build upon this framework.<br>
"The meeting is now adjourned. Unfortunately, our proposed amendment did not pass the United Council's vote."<br>
"As a result, we will continue with our original plan instead."<br>
"It is time to make a decision, General Commander."<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
(That's it! It was him!)<br>
(This is so strange. It's like some of the fog over my memory lifted as soon as I heard his name.)<br>
(I can't quite remember how he looked, though.)<br>
(Wait... Something else is coming back to me...)<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">War Protocol Scythe：</span><br>
Activating system.<br>
Connecting to command system.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Dr. Aoste：</span><br>
So, Admiral Mikhail – are you pleased with the results of this collaboration?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Mikhail：</span><br>
Hmm. I had a look at all the testing data. I must say I'm impressed.<br>
The collaboration with the Dragon Empery yielded Moon, the one with Iron Blood yielded Fortress, and the one with the Royal Navy yielded Enlightenment. Now our motherland has created Scythe.<br>
This gives the War Protocol series a fourth unit. Work can finally begin on creating the Council's new task force.<br>
I eagerly look forward to seeing their performance in battle.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
(Scythe, Fortress, and Moon – they were in the recording Hierophant showed me.)<br>
(But who – or what – is Enlightenment?)<br>

<br>
The Rose Tower's glow became brighter and brighter as the charging continued.<br>
The sky was illuminated faintly, providing a novel backdrop to this pre-battle tea time.<br>
<span style="color:#ffc960;">Grenville META：</span><br>
The cannon fire at the outer perimeter's getting louder...<br>
Should we really be sipping tea here while Compiler's erecting defences as fast as she can?<br>
<span style="color:#ffc960;">Glorious META：</span><br>
The enemy will not come after us until the Rose Tower's mode change is complete.<br>
Do not be alarmed, Grenville. There is plenty of time.<br>
<span style="color:#ffc960;">Queen Elizabeth META：</span><br>
Precisely. Enjoy your tea while this momentary lull lasts.<br>
<span style="color:#ffc960;">Grenville META：</span><br>
Alright...<br>
<span style="color:#ffc960;">Glorious META：</span><br>
Heehee. Excessive formality spoils the tea, so why don't we have a little chat?<br>
<span style="color:#ffc960;">Queen Elizabeth META：</span><br>
Sure. Propose a topic.<br>
<span style="color:#ffc960;">Glorious META：</span><br>
While you ladies already know my past, I don't know much about yours.<br>
I've never seen this many METAs in one place, either. Would you mind if I inquired about you?<br>
<span style="color:#ffc960;">Queen Elizabeth META：</span><br>
Hmm. Not a half-bad topic for a tea party.<br>
Grenville, you start.<br>
<span style="color:#ffc960;">Grenville META：</span><br>
Eh? M-me?!<br>
<span style="color:#ffc960;">Queen Elizabeth META：</span><br>
We know why you're nervous. It's because you've experienced something like this before, no?<br>
<span style="color:#ffc960;">Glorious META：</span><br>
Did your world go through something similar to ours, then?<br>
<span style="color:#ffc960;">Grenville META：</span><br>
...Many things were different then, but yeah. I did have some quiet time before my big battle.<br>
*sigh*... My home was a test site where we and the Sirens just kept killing each other.<br>
Well, to be fair, they were the first ones to propose peace and shared their technology with us. Then, one day, they suddenly snapped and turned hostile to us.<br>
For all the good times we had back then, we suffered doubly as hard afterward.<br>
Our world wasn't reset... but the hell we went through was even worse.<br>
My friends and I survived thanks to Her Majesty's leadership. She also brought what few survivors were left to safety.<br>
I decided to stay by her side after that and pledged my sword to her.<br>
<span style="color:#ffc960;">Queen Elizabeth META：</span><br>
We speculate that the experimentation division in that world wanted to create a civilisation with a certain degree of scientific ability, tear it down, and cultivate a new one from its ashes.<br>
That's why they didn't utterly destroy it. It's also why Grenville, among others, could be saved.<br>
<span style="color:#ffc960;">Glorious META：</span><br>
All this time, I believed the Sirens were unwavering allies... What an extreme story.<br>
<span style="color:#ffc960;">Queen Elizabeth META：</span><br>
There are all manner of experimentation divisions. In the end, they are but machines loyally following the orders given to them.<br>
In some worlds, they are allies. In others, they are invaders one must fight to the death against.<br>
<span style="color:#ffc960;">Glorious META：</span><br>
What about Compiler, who's aiding us as we speak? Is she like that?<br>
<span style="color:#ffc960;">Queen Elizabeth META：</span><br>
Ah, her. She's a bit of an exception. Which is to say, she is an ally beyond any doubt.<br>
<span style="color:#ffc960;">Glorious META：</span><br>
That's a relief... Erebus, could you share your history with me?<br>
<span style="color:#ffc960;">Erebus META：</span><br>
My past isn't much to talk about.<br>
I was wounded in a brutal battle. In my despair, I chose METAmorphosis. Later, Her Majesty came and made me stable.<br>
I've fought under her ever since then.<br>
As for my world, it fared better. The Sirens were defeated before they completed their reset.<br>
Hunter, on the other hand – you were even luckier, weren't you?<br>
<span style="color:#ffc960;">Hunter META：</span><br>
A sudden mention...<br>
Yes. My world was a bit unique.<br>
Having walked this path with Her Majesty for as long as I have, it's become apparent how absurdly lucky we were.<br>
Much like this place, we initially coexisted with the Sirens and got on well.<br>
That is, until X's influence began to spread, and mimic entities popped up across the globe.<br>
In any other case, we would've either fought the entities and barely come out on top, or we'd have been annihilated.<br>
However, almost as soon as the fighting began, an Arbiter appeared.<br>
She chose to fight the entities with us, and completely expelled all of them from our world before they could propagate.<br>
The Arbiter then made a decision. All the experiments on our world would end, the experimentation branch would be dissolved, and our very test site would be excluded from the Antiochus' database.<br>
To do this required a worldwide cognitive alteration, erasing every last trace of Antiochus and X.<br>
Then there was I. I had already seen the truth and could not choose ignorance.<br>
So the Arbiter brought me with her. I can remember naught after that point.<br>
Everything that happened after that and which Arbiter it was that saved me – all of it, gone.<br>
What I do remember is wandering the wasteland by myself, followed by meeting Her Majesty and Miss D.<br>
Ever since that day, I've fought by her side.<br>
<span style="color:#ffc960;">Glorious META：</span><br>
That is quite the bizarre experience... It certainly seems like the Arbiters are more unknowable than the experimentation divisions are.<br>
<span style="color:#ffc960;">Queen Elizabeth META：</span><br>
They ARE self-alleged machines given complete personalities. It's little surprise they cannot be predicted.<br>
<span style="color:#ffc960;">Glorious META：</span><br>
What about you, Sheffield? I heard you, Repulse, and Renown were acquainted. Are you from the same world?<br>
<span style="color:#ffc960;">Sheffield META：</span><br>
While I do not share a world of origin with them, I have known them for quite some time.<br>
Broadly speaking, we met very shortly after they left their home.<br>
Afterward, the three of us fought for a long time under the same organisation until we got separated during a major operation.<br>
Following that, I met Her Majesty, and decided that I would work with her.<br>
I apologise for the sparse details. To truly explain my past requires too much additional context to fit in a chat at the table.<br>
<span style="color:#ffc960;">Glorious META：</span><br>
It's alright. What you've already told me is more than sufficient.<br>
Ah... There really is so, so much beyond this world.<br>
I'd love to hear the second group's stories someday.<br>
<span style="color:#ffc960;">Queen Elizabeth META：</span><br>
It's not as though they can't hear what we're saying at this tea party.<br>
<span style="color:#ffc960;">Glorious META：</span><br>
Pardon? What do you mean?<br>
<span style="color:#ffc960;">Queen Elizabeth META：</span><br>
We know, Glorious. We know this tower's secret as well as why you locked yourself away here, alone, for all this time.<br>
<span style="color:#ffc960;">Glorious META：</span><br>
I... see.<br>
<br>
Glorious pauses for a moment, then takes a silent sip of her tea.<br>
<span style="color:#ffc960;">Glorious META：</span><br>
I am the final glory of the Royal Navy... No matter what happens, I must not fall.<br>
<br>
At that moment, the Rose Tower pierced the sky with its light. The clouds that covered the Royal Islands for a hundred years cleared up for the first time.<br>
It was though the earth, the hills, the rivers, everything that remained in this land had some sort of connection to the Rose Tower.<br>
The Rose Tower existed on the Royal Islands, and the Royal Islands also existed inside the Rose Tower.<br>
As for Glorious, she turned into specks of light and disappeared into thin air as soon as the tower's light shone.<br>
<span style="color:#ffc960;">Grenville META：</span><br>
Huh?! Glorious is gone!<br>
<span style="color:#ffc960;">Queen Elizabeth META：</span><br>
*sigh*... We knew this was coming.<br>
Don't worry about her. She just retreated inside the tower to fulfill the duty imposed on her.<br>
...We'd better prepare ourselves, too.<br>
Come. The battle is starting.<br>

{{折叠面板|标题=Preparing for War|选项=25|主框=1|样式=primary|展开=是}}
<br>
When the tower begins to shine for the first time, I've already taken my place in the command center built by Compiler.<br>
The monitor shows an impressive breadth of information on our allied forces.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
More than 200 production lines... 172 Type II mass-produced fleets?!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Compiler ：</span><br>
Thanks to the help of Glorious.<br>
She has not fully utilized the facilities under her control, but she has kept them maintained.<br>
With the reconnaissance data collected over the past hundred years, I've discovered the resource reserves and backup plans created by this world's Compiler and Omitter.<br>
Within six hours, I can start at least 100 production lines and reform at least 70 Type II mass-produced mixed fleets.<br>
<br>
In a sparse few hours, she would have us ready to go to war.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
It all looks like ruins to me, but you see resources in it all...<br>
The Antiochus are incredibly efficient at utilizing resources.<br>
By the way, can you only produce Type II models? Can you create flying fleets?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Compiler ：</span><br>
Unfortunately, I do not have the Council's permission to do so.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Okay. What's the most powerful model available to you?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Compiler ：</span><br>
The standard Type V model.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
I thought IV was the last one, but they have Type V now?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Compiler ：</span><br>
Higher model numbers require more complex production processes, increasing both resource and time costs.<br>
Type III will suffice for experiments in test sites. Type IV is only for reserve use, and Type V is only for extreme situations caused by factors beyond the experiment.<br>
Do not be misled by the current data. The only reason we can mobilize so many forces in such little time is that we're consuming existing reserves.<br>
Without support from a mainframe, sustained production is unlikely, and battlefield micromanagement will be limited.<br>
That is why I've chosen Type II mass-produced ships as simple cannon fodder, prioritizing our goal of stalling for time.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
I see. Prioritizing raw numbers... Yeah, I like that plan.<br>
<br>
Though our ultimate goal is buying time, that doesn't mean we can afford to focus all of our forces around the Rose Tower right away.<br>
We have multiple combat sectors available to us, and the enemy has no unified control structure. That means that intercepting them in the outside sectors is the ideal strategy, using space to buy more time.<br>
As the person most familiar with the battlefields here, Glorious will take charge of everything from the Rose Tower. Elizabeth, Belfast, and Vanguard will assist in defending the first combat sector.<br>
Sectors two, three, and six will be defended by Compiler's Siren fleet, assisted by Renown and Repulse – those most experienced with fighting alongside Sirens.<br>
Miss D and I will be working with Compiler through this process.<br>
I put Lion's team in charge of the fourth sector. They'll use the Mesektet's mobility to secure strategic advantages.<br>
The fifth sector is vast enough for the Queen's Light to exploit, so I assigned Elizabeth META's team to it.<br>
At the same time, Compiler will operate Siren facilities in surrounding combat sectors and other sea regions to disrupt the enemy on a wide scale.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Compiler ：</span><br>
Combat commencement signal received from Glorious.<br>
Per your request, I have transferred authority over one-third of the Siren fleet in the second combat sector to you.<br>
Permissions in this command center have been opened to you as well.<br>
We will remain here and command the battlefield until it is time to retreat to the Rose Tower. Do you object?<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Not at all.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Compiler ：</span><br>
Good. Then let us begin.<br>

{{折叠面板|标题=第二类拟态体|选项=26|主框=1|样式=primary|展开=是}}
<br>
KABOOOM!<br>
The battle continues from dawn through dusk, late into the night, and to the following dawn.<br>
Our allies take every measure to whittle away at the extradimensional forces, but we lose breathing room by the hour.<br>
After a night of combat, almost all of our enemies have changed their priority to attacking the Rose Tower. Corpses have stopped piling up around the Buds of the Full Moon.<br>
But they ARE starting to pile up in the sectors neighboring the Rose Tower, to the extent that mimic entities could start appearing at any time.<br>
Sunrise is coming. Lion's and Elizabeth META's teams have retreated to the first sector to build a new defensive line, and Compiler has diverted resources there.<br>
Miss D and I plan to retreat alongside her, as planned. However...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Miss D：</span><br>
GAAAAH! Assistant, assistant!<br>
This is bad! Really, really BAD!<br>
Class II mimic entities just popped in! It's so over! We're DEEEAD!<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
...Class II?<br>
<br>
Through the command center monitor, I witness the birth of mimic entities from extradimensional corpses.<br>
White biomass and black metal melt together into a soupy mixture that melds with the earth to create a chaotic ocean.<br>
Within, countless individuals made of the reconstituted corpses begin to wriggle and writhe.<br>
Even more unformed creatures clamor above, below, and between them amidst the chaos.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
They aren't like the mimic entities I've seen before, but what makes them categorically different?<br>
Does that mean there are Class I, III, and IV mimics as well?<br>
What are the criteria for these classifications?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Miss D：</span><br>
Shush, you! You won't get anything out of me if you keep peppering me with questions!<br>
Listen up, Assistant! All that matters is that we run! We're dead meat if those things touch us!<br>
<br>
Unfortunately, the horde of mimic entities spawned close to the command center.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
(That's what we get for trying to use geography to our advantage.)<br>
<span style="color:#ffc960;">Renown META ：</span><br>
We're likely to be surrounded if we stay here. Let's hurry back to the Rose Tower.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Renown, Repulse. Do you know why she called those Class II mimic entities?<br>
<span style="color:#ffc960;">Repulse META ：</span><br>
You're really fixated on that, aren't you? But I don't know, either!<br>
<span style="color:#ffc960;">Renown META ：</span><br>
Neither do I. We distinguish between mimic entity and mimic beast by size, and we give them levels according to their combat capabilities.<br>
However, I've never heard of this sort of categorisation.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
This might be related to Miss D's amnesia...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Miss D：</span><br>
Assistant! Hurry! Up! Get! Outta! Here!<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Okay, okay. Compiler, execute evac plan.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Compiler ：</span><br>
Orders received. There is no vector zone in the sky as of yet, so we may avail ourselves of aerial support.<br>
Setting base self-destruct countdown. Now departing.<br>
<br>
<br>
KABOOOOM!<br>
Mimic entities haven't appeared on our escape route, so there's no need to leave the river and detour.<br>
The Type II mass-produced fleet protecting our rear is no match for the mimic entities, but they're effective enough as obstacles.<br>
Renown and Repulse quickly dispatch the extradimensionals ahead of us, as well, making our retreat a smooth one.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
(Like the X mimic entities from the Martyrium, they become vector zones when destroyed, allowing them to spawn anew.)<br>
(But this time, extradimensionals are mixed among the things spewing out of the vector zones. Why?)<br>
(Extradimensionals are much weaker than mimic entities, and their corpses don't fully convert to mimics...)<br>
(Doesn't that just make the vector zones less effective?)<br>
<span style="color:#ffc960;">Helena META：</span><br>
(...Commander... hear me...)<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
(Helena? Have you found our coordinates?)<br>
<span style="color:#ffc960;">Helena META：</span><br>
(...Magician... a trap...)<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
(Our communications are being sabotaged. I can't hear her well!)<br>
<span style="color:#ffc960;">Helena META：</span><br>
(...Listen...)<br>
(...can't save you this time...)<br>
(...watching you...)<br>
(...Follow your heart...)<br>
(...If you want to, save them... can't, then run...)<br>
(...No matter what... I'm by your...)<br>
(......)<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
(Helena? Helena!)<br>
(Damn. We've been totally cut off!)<br>
<br>
<br>
KABOOOOM!<br>
<span style="color:#ffc960;">Grenville META：</span><br>
Good work, Commander! Leave this sector to us now!<br>
<span style="color:#ffc960;">Glorious META：</span><br>
I've opened a path through the barrier. Please proceed into the Rose Tower.<br>
<br>
As soon as we approach the Rose Tower defensive line at the first combat sector, I spot the Queen's Light soaring through the sky.<br>
Our strategic retreat has gone well so far. From here on out, this operation isn't a bid for time – it's a life-or-death siege.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
(There's still room for retreat behind the defensive line. It can be brought all the way to the tower, if need be.)<br>
(But after that, we're cornered.)<br>
(Chariot, you have to get here soon!)<br>

Royal Islands - Rose Tower<br>
Somewhere inside the Tower<br>
KABOOOM!<br>
The mimic entities were indeed far more powerful than the extradimensionals.<br>
In just three hours of fighting, our defensive line had been pierced in several places. Glorious chose to abandon all outside fronts in favor of focusing our firepower.<br>
Apart from the ever-mobile Queen's Light and Compiler's ability to summon Siren mass-produced fleets from odd positions, the Rose Tower's barrier was all we had left.<br>
A fierce battle raged outside the barrier. We could hear enormous explosions from even inside the tower.<br>
It was then that Elizabeth summoned me to a chamber of the tower.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Queen Elizabeth：</span><br>
Servant. The situation is only worsening.<br>
Our last line of defence is in a precarious state. There's no sign of Chariot coming to save us.<br>
It's time we seriously consider a final retreat.<br>
Should we use the Queen's Light and Camelot's stealth mode, we should be able to evacuate everyone safely.<br>
We can take Lion's party and Glorious alike.<br>
Whatever the case, our decision must be swift. Escape will become much more difficult when the barrier breaks.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
As it stands, we can last six more hours... No, maybe even longer.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Queen Elizabeth：</span><br>
The METAs aren't made to be on the receiving end of a siege, and Compiler isn't much help under these circumstances.<br>
The longer we fight, the more of a risk we're taking.<br>
We've done everything we can. Relying on the Antiochus will only get us so far.<br>
Besides, they only care for their own needs. They don't care what sacrifices it takes as long as they've killed the X in the end.<br>
Whether it be us, you, or their own selves.<br>
They're simple killing machines that stop at nothing, in the name of "salvation."<br>
*sigh*... I understand that you've made contact with the Antiochus through some channels unknown to me, so maybe you consider your relationship a good one...<br>
But think about it. What if everything you've been through is just another part of their plan?<br>
Further, how can you be certain that they haven't discarded the plan entirely?<br>
Our world and Lion's world are safe. The META version of me destroyed the buds of the two worlds you were particularly concerned over, too.<br>
Of course, it's cruel to simply abandon all of the other 400 worlds. I'm not saying I WANT to.<br>
But we must face reality.<br>
Just surviving and protecting the people we love is already too much for us to handle.<br>
If we die for nothing today, then what will they do?<br>
The world is constantly in danger, be it at the hands of Sirens, of the X, of the very people of that world, or of some other thing we've never faced before.<br>
Things happen in places we can see and in places we can't.<br>
We're no gods, and we're no messiahs.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
That may be, but even if we can't change the results, we can still make a difference.<br>
We can't turn a blind eye to tragedy just because it's going to happen either way.<br>
We've decided that the Sirens' methods are wrong, and because of that, we walk a different path. To be indifferent is to be the same as them.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Queen Elizabeth：</span><br>
You're right. That's why I continue to search for allies, and that's why you've saved other test sites.<br>
It has to be done one step at a time. We can't expect to fix everything in one fell swoop.<br>
If you must, then you may regret today's losses, curse your own powerlessness, and swear that you'll never let it happen again.<br>
But right here, right now? Impossible means impossible.<br>
As I recall, you said, "We're ready to retreat if necessary."<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Yeah. You're right, I'll admit.<br>
But... I'm afraid I just need more time. Our friends are still holding out – it's not time to beat a hasty retreat, not yet.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Queen Elizabeth：</span><br>
I had a feeling you'd say that.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Did Elizabeth META put you up to this?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Queen Elizabeth：</span><br>
Half and half, really... You get six hours, and not a minute longer.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Six hours. When that time comes, we're leaving no matter what.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Queen Elizabeth：</span><br>
That's all I needed. I'm going back to the battlefield.<br>
Also, I hear some among us are less willing to wait. They plan to leave ahead of us.<br>
Not to name any names, but they're the kind of girls who don't fold before my royal authority. You'd best think of how to calm them.<br>
<br>
Immediately after Elizabeth's departure, Lion rushes over to me.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
(I had a feeling.)<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Lion：</span><br>
Commander, I've been looking for you!<br>
We've been fighting for long enough. Is this Arbiter of yours coming or not?<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Chariot will come, I assure you. I just can't tell you when.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Lion：</span><br>
You said that last time. Our fight has gone on for two straight days. Everyone is at their limit.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Those mimic entities – the X – are foes you'll have to learn to fight sooner or later.<br>
I understand that it's difficult, but consider this necessary experience for your future survival.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Lion：</span><br>
Agreed. The thing is, we can't do anything with that experience if we die in this hellhole. Who's going to tell the people back home what we've learned here?<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
(Hmm... Is it just me, or does it seem like she isn't quite demanding to leave early?)<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Lion：</span><br>
I still have many more great exploits to accomplish. I won't lay down my life or those of my shipgirls for a pointless venture.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
......<br>
<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项1：(I get it...)</span>'''''<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项2：(She's looking for a reason to keep up the struggle.)</span>'''''<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Good news. Elizabeth and I have decided that we're retreating in six hours. Sorry I didn't lead with that.<br>
Whether Chariot comes or not, we have other ways to share information on the Sirens and Arbiters.<br>
Even putting Compiler aside, Miss D and her whale are inextricably tied to the Arbiters.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Lion：</span><br>
...Six hours, eh?<br>
Very well. Then I'm going back to the Mesektet to keep up the fight. See you then!<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
.........<br>
(Elizabeth and Lion are set on retreat.)<br>
(So even Arbiters aren't especially speedy when it comes to dealing with problems across worlds.)<br>
(If Chariot isn't here in six hours, then we'll have to abandon this world.)<br>
(The buds leading to Rumey's resistance and the Sardegnia League have already been destroyed.)<br>
(If we can evacuate everyone, including Glorious META, then this mission could be considered a success. But...)<br>
(She's been fighting for this world all on her lonesome for so long now.)<br>
(Will she willingly leave alongside us?)<br>
(I need to discuss this with her.)<br>

<br>
Glorious hasn't taken one foot out of the war room ever since the Rose Tower switched to interception mode.<br>
However, a passage has opened for carrier aircraft that connects the Rose Tower and the outside. It allows her to dispatch her air wings without issue.<br>
<span style="color:#ffc960;">Glorious META：</span><br>
Hello, Commander. Are you here to discuss the retreat?<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
You knew about it?<br>
<span style="color:#ffc960;">Glorious META：</span><br>
Miss Elizabeth and Miss Lion each went to meet you, and now you've come to me. I assumed that's why you're here.<br>
I've heard that the Sirens give serial numbers to their test site. You and your group are from "test site beta," correct?<br>
What kind of world is it?<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
That's a... pretty vague question.<br>
If you ask me, it's a beautiful world filled with life, hope, and endless possibilities. A word that overcame the fate imposed on it.<br>
<span style="color:#ffc960;">Glorious META：</span><br>
Overcame the fate imposed on it... A beautiful world filled with so many lovely things...<br>
That's wonderful. It must be even better with someone as great as your Miss Elizabeth around.<br>
Do you happen to know the serial number of this world?<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
SQ-4577486.<br>
<span style="color:#ffc960;">Glorious META：</span><br>
Test site SQ-4577486. I see.<br>
This, too, once was a beautiful world filled with life, hope, and endless possibility.<br>
Commander. You did not give up on your home – neither will I give up on mine.<br>
<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项1：......</span>'''''<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项2：Glorious...</span>'''''<br>
<span style="color:#ffc960;">Glorious META：</span><br>
You've crossed paths with many a META.<br>
I'm sure some of them have given up on their worlds, while others are looking for a new place to call home.<br>
I respect their decisions and wish them the best.<br>
I, however, cannot and will not give up.<br>
In truth, you don't want to give up on this world either, do you?<br>
If you did, you wouldn't have persuaded the others to keep fighting as long as they can.<br>
Even so, things are what they are. Nothing will change even if we give it our all – that's your reasoning, so you reluctantly agreed on a retreat.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
...I'm sorry, but yeah, that's the logical decision I arrived at by considering the circumstances. I just cannot wager all their lives on this.<br>
<span style="color:#ffc960;">Glorious META：</span><br>
Logical, you say... Logic is not what has kept this tower standing for a hundred years.<br>
You are wrong, Commander. You've not yet seen the true limit of the Rose Tower.<br>
This does not scratch the surface of our strength.<br>
<br>
The noble girl has moved to the center of the hall, sword in hand.<br>
I've seen the sword before. It was in Elizabeth's treasure collection.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Is that... the Sword of Mercy?<br>
<span style="color:#ffc960;">Glorious META：</span><br>
I am the final glory of the Royal Navy. I shall now let it shine radiantly.<br>
O souls resting beneath the tower, O prisoners captive within it...<br>
I awaken ye...<br>
For one final, glorious battle...<br>
<br>
The originally sealed-off hall begins to expand outward infinitely.<br>
Amid countless rooms, countless fragments of light glitter.<br>
I see the grand ambition that Elizabeth had when the war began.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Queen Elizabeth：</span><br>
We'll build a great tower! A tower able to protect all of the Royal Islands! And its name shall be – the Rose Tower!<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
(...This is the moment the tower was born.)<br>
<br>
As the war turns increasingly violent, the land beneath the tower becomes a resting place for heroes.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">King George V：</span><br>
...We shall keep fighting. Until we achieve flawless victory, or our last drop of blood spills.<br>
Rest in peace, Lady Hood.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
(And this is Hood's funeral...)<br>
<br>
One funeral after another is held, until eventually all the mourners themselves end up in a grave.<br>
A suffocating loneliness hangs in the land beneath the Rose Tower.<br>
<span style="color:#ffc960;">Glorious：</span><br>
I'm the only one left.<br>
I must not die before I carry out my duty...<br>
I simply... must not die.<br>
I am Glorious, the bearer of the Royal Navy's glory.<br>
As long as I breathe, its glory remains intact.<br>
Yes... I understand now...<br>
<span style="color:#ffc960;">Glorious META：</span><br>
Heed me, Rose Tower: I will be your protector.<br>
Together... we will protect the Royal Islands.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
(...Glorious is the tower, and the tower is her.)<br>
<br>
Lights and shadows begin to gather in the endlessly expanding space.<br>
There are faces in them – some familiar and others unknown, some brimming with life and others devoid of it.<br>
They glow and sway gently, almost like candleflames blowing in the wind yet just barely staying lit.<br>
Each time a light or shadow appears, the light given off by the tower grows even brighter.<br>
Its barrier becomes sturdier yet and it begins emitting light with a destructive power to its surroundings.<br>
The mimic entities, along with their vector zones, are reduced to dust in the light. For a while, the area around the Rose Tower becomes a silent no man's land.<br>
Far away, the sea begins to billow, and a furious Rising Tide advances on the Royal Islands' coastlines.<br>
Long-since sunken wreckages of mass-produced ships of the Royal Navy and its allies rise to the surface.<br>
Those still with functioning propellers charge desperately toward the enemy, while those with working cannons bombard them instead.<br>
Lastly, the ones with only power left martyrize themselves in an explosion.<br>
Even the ones reduced to nothing but wrecks ride the waves toward land, battering any enemies they collide with.<br>
The carcasses of the extradimensionals and even the mimics' vector zones are all destroyed and diluted by the impact of this Rising Tide.<br>
While I can't explain it, I just know that this is a miracle created through the sheer faith of the Royal Navy.<br>
A miracle of the power of thoughts.<br>
It comes at a cost – with each attack from the Rose Tower, more lights and shadows vanish.<br>
The mimic entities will one day revive in this boundless Rising Tide and feast on these wreckages, making themselves even stronger.<br>
In this moment, though, X's forces have finally fallen into a disadvantage.<br>
{{折叠面板|内容结束}}

{{折叠面板|标题=Impending Decision|选项=29|主框=1|样式=primary|展开=是}}
<br>
When the lights and shadows appeared, my field of view expanded to a bird's eye view of the whole battlefield in an instant.<br>
Then, the next moment, I was brought back to the war room.<br>
The door was closed, yet I already knew what kind of miracle had transpired on the other side.<br>
Rather than disturb Glorious, I explained what was happening in the Rose Tower to Lion and Elizabeth, then rearranged our forces with Compiler and her team.<br>
Currently, Elizabeth META has taken back the Queen's Light, and Compiler's vessel has returned to the Rose Tower.<br>
We've sent back all the forces – except the Siren mass-produced ships that appear as sporadically as ever – to the glowing Rose Tower.<br>
Part of the reason is practical. We can't coordinate our fleets around the Rose Tower's attacks.<br>
The other part is that the only one among us – excluding Elizabeth – that can deal any significant damage to the mimic entities is the Rose Tower.<br>
All we can do for now is lick our wounds and wait.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Trafalgar：</span><br>
Cleopatra, Trinidad, Gallant...<br>
Good. Miss Governor, all our units have safely evacuated.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Lion：</span><br>
Whew... We can finally breathe.<br>
This battle was beyond my wildest imagination. Do you concur, Trafalgar?<br>
Could you have foreseen this happening before our journey?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Trafalgar：</span><br>
No. I was prepared for a battle of some kind, but only one in the realm of swords and cannons.<br>
Instead, we were faced with an enemy that was impossible to describe.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Lion：</span><br>
Aye. I was also astonished by the Rose Tower and the cohesion of this world's Royal Navy.<br>
Who are we, by comparison? Sure, the sun always shines upon our Realm, and nothing has the strength to challenge us.<br>
What of our faith, though?<br>
Can the Realm of the Neversetting Sun, with its constituents all moving in different directions, muster faith comparable to this?<br>
With our cohesion gone, how will we stand up against a threat such as we've faced here in the future?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Trafalgar：</span><br>
Indeed... We don't even hold a candle to them.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Lion：</span><br>
I read the files Elizabeth gave to me.<br>
The reason our Realm turned out like this is because the Sirens purposely made it so.<br>
Our victory against them and our technological revolution, too, were but a deliberate part of their plan.<br>
You see... when we fought them, we never went under the ice cap of Antarctica.<br>
Right now, they're no doubt coldly and silently observing us somewhere deep in the ocean, planning their next experiment.<br>
Meanwhile, our Realm is completely oblivious to them, slowly wasting away amidst a false peace.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Trafalgar：</span><br>
...We must do something.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Lion：</span><br>
Yes. We have to take action. We will cut out the tumor that is the Sirens in its entirety and truly unite the Realm.<br>
Then... We'll prepare for the true enemy that will come one day.<br>
We have much work ahead of us, Trafalgar.<br>
<br>
The Rose Tower's attacks are gradually weakening and the Rising Tide is calming down. The time for a final decision has come.<br>
<span style="color:#ffc960;">Queen Elizabeth META：</span><br>
It seems the final miracle is wrapping up.<br>
Six more hours have passed than the six hours you promised, Commander. The one we're all waiting for still hasn't come.<br>
It is time to retreat.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
That does seem to be our only option.<br>
Is it possible to take Glorious with us, with the way she is now?<br>
<span style="color:#ffc960;">Queen Elizabeth META：</span><br>
It would've been possible previously.<br>
Now, it isn't. She has merged and become one with the concept of the Rose Tower. There is no cutting her loose.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Become one with the concept... Cut her loose...<br>
Hey, how about using Miss D's whale?<br>
<span style="color:#ffc960;">Queen Elizabeth META：</span><br>
Are you serious?<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
It's worth a shot, at least.<br>
<span style="color:#ffc960;">Queen Elizabeth META：</span><br>
Even supposing that it works, do you really think she'll come along just like that?<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
I want to see if she will.<br>
I decided to withdraw and gave up on saving those worlds I've never seen because I'd done my best and still failed.<br>
But Glorious is a different matter. I can't just watch and do nothing while she chooses to die. I haven't done my best at convincing her.<br>
<span style="color:#ffc960;">Queen Elizabeth META：</span><br>
*sigh*... That's the thing. You cannot.<br>
But perhaps the other Elizabeth could, or maybe even...<br>
Bah. We shall do it ourselves. In the meanwhile, you should thoroughly figure out how to draw power from the whale.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
I will. Thank you.<br>
<span style="color:#ffc960;">Queen Elizabeth META：</span><br>
You're welcome.<br>
If there is a possibility to save her, then we don't wish to see her fall any more than you do.<br>
Now go. We need to prepare.<br>

<br>
After parting ways with Elizabeth META, I called for Miss D, who'd been killing time by riding her whale.<br>
I didn't know how I was going to draw power from the whale, but I had a lead – the abnormal phenomena Miss D and the whale experienced after entering unusual spaces.<br>
It happened both with the Martyrium and the Bud of the Full Moon just earlier.<br>
Luckily, Glorious was also inside an unusual space. I knew something would happen if I brought Miss D there.<br>
I contacted Elizabeth and Lion separately and told them to prepare to evacuate, then I contacted Compiler as well.<br>
Hordes of mimic entities had started approaching again ever since the Rose Tower's offense weakened. Compiler had commanded her newly-repaired mass-produced army to engage them at the front lines.<br>
I stressed that she should not blow herself up and instead should evacuate with Elizabeth. After that, I took Miss D and brought her to the war room.<br>
The door to the war room isn't locked.<br>
I simply push it open and end up in that endlessly expanding space again.<br>
There are hardly any lights or shadows left – most of them have turned a greyish color.<br>
Glorious holds on to her sword, sitting beside a lavish throne.<br>
<span style="color:#ffc960;">Glorious META：</span><br>
*cough cough*... Commander... Splendid timing. I was just thinking about calling you.<br>
The Rose Tower's offensive is nearing its end. I suggest that you get ready to retreat.<br>
<br>
Her body trembling, she just about manages to rise to stand up.<br>
<span style="color:#ffc960;">Glorious META：</span><br>
You and your companions more than performed your duty as allies in the previous battle.<br>
I am honoured to have fought by your side until the very last moment.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
...What are you going to do now?<br>
<span style="color:#ffc960;">Glorious META：</span><br>
Please... don't make me repeat myself again.<br>
As I said before, I cannot leave the Rose Tower. Even if I could, I wouldn't.<br>
If the Royal Navy's glory is destined to fade today, then I shall resign myself to that destiny.<br>
I've done what I could... I've done everything I could.<br>
So now... Well, I suppose I'll end things with a great fireworks show after you've withdrawn.<br>
To celebrate the Rose Tower having served its duty and to provide cover for your retreat.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
It's not over yet, Glorious. Wait a little longer.<br>
<span style="color:#ffc960;">Glorious META：</span><br>
A little... longer?<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Miss D, have you felt anything since we entered this place?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Miss D：</span><br>
Hmm... Nope!<br>
But, now that you mention it... maybe I do?<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Let's try with the whale, then.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Miss D：</span><br>
The whale's just fine! It– Hey! Assistant! Stop hitting it or you'll break it!<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
(Damn. No response whatsoever.)<br>
<span style="color:#ffc960;">Glorious META：</span><br>
What are you trying to do?<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
I'm looking for a way to save you.<br>
<span style="color:#ffc960;">Glorious META：</span><br>
...Commander, really, it's fine.<br>
It's my choice to share the fate of this land. I'm okay with it.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
I'm not, and I won't give up now.<br>
(Aoste designed it, so maybe it needs some weird activation phrase...)<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Miss D：</span><br>
I said stop hitting it! Stop it already! Owch!<br>
<span style="color:#ffc960;">Glorious META：</span><br>
But... why?<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
I could give you a dozen reasons why, and you'd refute them one by one.<br>
You've simply been through too much and shouldered the burden alone.<br>
I get it. I understand you on that front, so I won't try to persuade you with words.<br>
All I'll say is that I don't agree with your choice because I don't like it.<br>
I can't stand the thought of you choosing to die in front of me when I might still be able to save you.<br>
Don't ask about what my logic is, because there is none.<br>
I want to save you. That's all there's to it.<br>
<br>
Out of nowhere, an enormous whale appears below me and leaps up.<br>
<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项1：...What?</span>'''''<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项2：It activated?</span>'''''<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项3：Whoa!</span>'''''<br>
<br>
A strange amount of time passes – it feels like an eternity yet seems like an instant.<br>
When my mind returns to reality, I find myself back where I just was, except now the entire space around me feels different.<br>
<span style="color:#ffc960;">Glorious META：</span><br>
Wh-what just happened?!<br>
Why can't I feel the Rose Tower's presence anymore?!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Queen Elizabeth：</span><br>
Isn't it a good thing that you can't?<br>
<br>
The endless space collapses and shrinks in an instant. The next thing I know, I'm back in the fancy hall.<br>
The queen sits on the throne far across from me. She gazes down at me with a smile.<br>
<span style="color:#ffc960;">Glorious META：</span><br>
Your... Majesty?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Queen Elizabeth：</span><br>
I witnessed your battle in its entirety.<br>
In fact, not just I, but everyone present here.<br>
<span style="color:#ffc960;">Glorious META：</span><br>
Wh-why are you here, Your Majesty?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Queen Elizabeth：</span><br>
You made a miracle happen for someone else's sake, so now I've made one happen for you. It's only fair, no?<br>
All of us, from those in here to those out there, witnessed your battle.<br>
You are truly powerful, wielding both superior technology and combat potential. I knew I made the right choice.<br>
On behalf of the Realm of the Neversetting Sun, I offer my sincerest gratitude to you who rushed to our aid.<br>
Give my thanks to all the rest, Commander.<br>
<br>
The queen gives me a playful wink, then her figure starts to fade into transparency.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Queen Elizabeth：</span><br>
Seems the time is upon me.<br>
<span style="color:#ffc960;">Glorious META：</span><br>
Your Majesty...<br>
<br>
Glorious stifles her trembling voice and forces herself to calm down.<br>
<span style="color:#ffc960;">Glorious META：</span><br>
I hereby issue my report. There was a response to our distress signal. Our allies brought a fleet to support us.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Queen Elizabeth：</span><br>
Yes. They certainly did.<br>
I'm proud of you, Glorious. You accomplished your mission with flying colours.<br>
I will now give you a new mission.<br>
Live. Witness the brighter future that all of us should've gotten.<br>
<span style="color:#ffc960;">Glorious META：</span><br>
As you wish, Your Majesty...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Queen Elizabeth：</span><br>
As for you, my sworn ally – take care of our Glorious.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
I will. I swear it on my name, Queen Elizabeth.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Queen Elizabeth：</span><br>
Good. Now, it's time for me to leave the Rose Tower. It's the monarch's duty to protect their subjects to the very end.<br>
As soon as your business is done, leave this place posthaste.<br>
Also, other me – do one last thing for me and help hold a grand funeral for this Royal Navy!<br>
<br>
I feel as though Elizabeth META's consciousness silently acknowledges in the far-off distance.<br>
The queen becomes vividly opaque again, and the light around us that was on the brink of extinguishing brightens up again.<br>
I don't have the luxury of staying to watch whatever will come next.<br>
Just as she has her duties as the queen, I have my duties as the commander.<br>
That is – bringing everyone home safely.<br>

<br>
I left the Rose Tower with Glorious and Miss D to find that the remaining shipgirls were all ready for departure.<br>
Elizabeth META sat at the train's cabin, waiting to go. Compiler was aboard, positioning a force to cover our retreat. Finally, by some miracle, Lion had crammed the entire Mesektet inside the rearmost train car.<br>
The very moment that the tower's barrier opened, the Queen's Light lifted up into the air and took off.<br>
It was, at last, time to bid farewell to this world.<br>
As we rise in altitude, we slowly start to see the full picture through the train's windows.<br>
Flames of war, burning everywhere. Vast swaths of land, ruthlessly destroyed. And the tragic cherry on top – the Rose Tower, dyed a bloody red.<br>
It musters its final morsel of strength from its soul to set everything on fire, going out in a literal blaze of glory.<br>
<span style="color:#ffc960;">Glorious META：</span><br>
Just like a rose in full bloom...<br>
All along, you designed the tower with this day in mind...<br>
It's... truly beautiful, Your Majesty.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
......<br>
<br>
First the tower crumbles, then the rest of the world meets its demise.<br>
After that, the same befalls the Buds of the New Moon.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
(I did everything I could, including saving everyone who could be, and I still failed in the end...)<br>
<br>
Suddenly, a buzzing sound.<br>
A strange buzzing sound that echoed through the air and land. All vibrations – and even the Queen's Light's engine – stopped for a moment.<br>
An oddly familiar feeling came over me. I braced for the worst, anticipating that the Star Beast had finally come out of hiding.<br>
Instead, what happened next was so shocking that it blew away all my misgivings.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Communicator：</span><br>
BEEP!<br>
This is Arbiter: The Chariot VII. I will now take over the post factum cleanup of this test site.<br>
Death, where are you? I'm here to help.<br>
<br>
In the blink of an eye, countless flying platforms appeared out of thin air.<br>
They ranged in size and shape, with the smallest clocking in at several meters and the largest stretching on for kilometers.<br>
Swarms of combat mechs poured out of them like rain, amassing on the surface and advancing like a stream of steel.<br>
War had begun again.<br>
The platforms fired a pinpoint volley that instantly pulverized the mimic entities and beasts, sending them back to a vector zone.<br>
The vector zones, in turn, were divided into tiny ribbons by the storm of steel rushing across the surface.<br>
Then, Chariot's secret weapon descended upon the earth – the MECHArbiter.<br>
It was equipped with specialized weapons specifically for dealing with vector zones.<br>
A discharge from these weapons rendered the innumerable shredded vector zones into nothing but harmless dust.<br>
Chariot's army set their sights on their next target – the Buds of the Full Moon.<br>
One after another, the buds are cleaved in two. Booming explosions resound without pause.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
(THIS is what it looks like an Arbiter leads the Antiochus' army into battle?)<br>
(So much power... overwhelmingly so. The kind of power that would break any foe's spirit.)<br>
<br>
This battle that was so bleak for us turned around in an instant with Chariot's arrival.<br>
She crushed this amorphous enemy like they were bugs under her boots. It makes all our hard-fought battles before seem like a farce.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
(...No. That's not true.)<br>
(They have their way of fighting, and we have ours.)<br>
(It's thanks to Glorious's hundred-year struggle that we got an opportunity to come to this world's support.)<br>
(In the same vein, our desperate defense for the past few days gave Antiochus time to arrive with their army.)<br>
(It's all connected. This wouldn't have come to be if any single party in this were missing.)<br>
(We're lucky that Chariot got here in time.)<br>
(This world may be doomed to destruction, but at least its invaders will fall with it.)<br>
(And all those worlds connected by the buds are saved now.)<br>
<br>
I was right about one more thing about Antiochus.<br>
As long as X exists, Chariot will divert all her resources toward dealing with them. The Rose Tower and the Queen's Light weren't even on her target list.<br>
Now, after the initial shock of this development, the air aboard the train is regaining its calm.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Lion：</span><br>
Unbelievable... That is Antiochus and their army?!<br>
Do you think we could land and try to ally with her?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Cleopatra：</span><br>
Please be sensible, Miss Governor! You haven't even persuaded Compiler to your side yet!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Trafalgar：</span><br>
It borders on a miracle that she's letting us go. Approaching her would be beyond foolhardy.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Trinidad：</span><br>
Gotta agree.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Gallant：</span><br>
Same! She'll pump us full of lead if we come close, even if we don't act hostile!<br>
Let's not poke the bear, okay?!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Lion：</span><br>
Alright, alright. I just thought it was worth considering.<br>
Ahem. On another subject... Glorious, the land I preside over just so happens to be in need of an aircraft carrier.<br>
I'd like to formally invite you to join the fleet and oversee the Nile with me. What do you say?<br>
<span style="color:#ffc960;">Glorious META：</span><br>
That's a most gracious offer of you, but I'm afraid I must decline. I've already decided I will accompany the Commander to test site beta.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Lion：</span><br>
I'm not joking or being polite with this offer. I'm serious. Would you at least take it seriously?<br>
<span style="color:#ffc960;">Glorious META：</span><br>
Very well. I truly and seriously appreciate the kind gesture.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Lion：</span><br>
Ahem...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Queen Elizabeth：</span><br>
That's enough tomfoolery. We aren't out of the woods just yet.<br>
We've arrived at your destination. Get your ship and prepare to disembark. You can lounge around when you get home.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Lion：</span><br>
We're already there? Well, thank you for giving us a ride.<br>
In that case, I bid you farewell, both Lady Elizabeths – and you, Commander. If we ever get the chance, I'd love to have you as guests in my domain.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Trafalgar：</span><br>
I look forward to the day that we'll meet again, our trusted allies.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Queen Elizabeth：</span><br>
Remember – CONTROL the flow of information about X!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Lion：</span><br>
I remember! Goodbye, all of you!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">A Rose on the High Tower - The End：</span><br>
I hope we shall meet again, Miss Belfast.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Belfast：</span><br>
Same to you, Miss Cleopatra. Please have a safe journey home.<br>
<br>
After seeing Lion's team off, the train starts heading straight toward the well-concealed Camelot.<br>
These few days have been fraught with danger and confusion. We were even forced to fight for our lives.<br>
It has yielded good things, however. Elizabeth solidified an alliance, we rescued Glorious, and saved hundreds upon hundreds of worlds from sure destruction, all while bringing everyone home in one piece.<br>
I can now with certainty say that this mission has been a great success.<br>

Ah?! Are you okay?! When did you get so badly wounded?!<br>
Stay with us, now... I don't know who to call if something happens to you!<br>
<span style="color:#ffc960;">Queen Elizabeth META：</span><br>
Ngh... It's fine. We will not die, not today.<br>
We simply... made a major error this time. We need rest...<br>
*cough*... *cough* *hack*...<br>
We need... quiet rest.<br>
Elizabeth, listen carefully... Keep what you're witnessing a secret from everyone...<br>
Helena META, especially, must not know...<br>
Naturally, neither can the Commander. This is important... Do you understand?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Queen Elizabeth：</span><br>
Yes, I understand. Don't worry.<br>

Test site beta is as unpredictable as ever.<br>
There are too many forces at work. Too many strings than can be grasped.<br>
But they ARE a tangled mess, which is all the more convenient for me.<br>
For now... I need to stay calm and find a place to lay low.<br>
After that, it might just be time to get in contact with Yamato.<br>

Shortly after<br>
In dazzling light, the Rose Tower and everything in a several-kilometer radius around it had been obliterated.<br>
However, to the observing Chariot, the impact felt like little more than a soft breeze.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Arbiter: The Chariot VII：</span><br>
What a fantastic local closed circuit. It's a pity, really.<br>
*sigh*... Not here, either.<br>
Oh, Deeeath! I've been looking all over for you. Where are you?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Arbiter: The Empress III：</span><br>
Don't bother searching. She's already gone.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Arbiter: The Chariot VII：</span><br>
Huh? She is?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Arbiter: The Empress III：</span><br>
You solved all of her problems for her. Why would she stay?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Arbiter: The Chariot VII：</span><br>
Aww... But it's just mean to leave without saying goodbye, don't you think?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Arbiter: The Empress III：</span><br>
Death has her reasons.<br>
Enough complaining. I'll give you the opportunity to leave, too.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Arbiter: The Chariot VII：</span><br>
What does that mean?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Arbiter: The Empress III：</span><br>
Lovers will come to clean things up before long. After you're done here, go to these coordinates. Moon has important work that needs support.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Arbiter: The Chariot VII：</span><br>
Aww... Why do I have to do it? What about Hermit's little trio?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Arbiter: The Empress III：</span><br>
They will be joining you before long.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Arbiter: The Chariot VII：</span><br>
Hermit, Strength, Temperance... Moon... AND me?<br>
Is there anyone else I should know about?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Arbiter: The Empress III：</span><br>
Yes, actually.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Arbiter: The Chariot VII：</span><br>
Does it need so many of us? Is this... a direct order from Zero?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Arbiter: The Empress III：</span><br>
Supposedly, the transboundary experiment will be entering stage three.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Arbiter: The Chariot VII：</span><br>
...Okay. I'll go as soon as I can.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Arbiter: The Empress III：</span><br>
Good.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Arbiter: The Chariot VII：</span><br>
Empress, do you think we'll make a breakthrough this time?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Arbiter: The Empress III：</span><br>
The fact that it's entered stage three is a breakthrough in itself.<br>
As for what comes after? Just do what you can.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Arbiter: The Chariot VII：</span><br>
...Right.<br>

Realm of the Neversetting Sun - Nile Governor-General's District<br>
Port of Alexandria<br>
Guided by the light of the "Miracle Recreation - Lighthouse of Alexandria," the Mesektet safely returned from war-torn lands and touched down in friendly waters.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Lion：</span><br>
Ah, how I missed you, Nile River Delta.<br>
Mmm... The air tastes fresher than ever.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Trafalgar：</span><br>
Thus ends a great voyage fraught with danger. This one is sure to go into history books.<br>
It feels... nice.<br>

Fwee-fwee! We've escaped death by a centimetre yet again! Woo, go us!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Trinidad：</span><br>
I'm exhausted. I don't think I'll feel right until I've slept for a week or so...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Cleopatra：</span><br>
Oh, my... Miss Governor, listen!<br>
We're receiving a deluge of congratulatory telegrams! They show no signs of letting up!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Lion：</span><br>
People noticed us fast, eh?<br>
Hmph. Awful lot of them didn't think I'd come home in one piece.<br>
I'll reply to the ones from people I know. Save those for me, and give perfunctory responses to the others.<br>
Oh, and one more thing. Bring me the one from Governor-General Valiant personally, if you would.<br>
Since Terra Australis and the Solomon Islands apparently aren't enough for her, she's pursuing a third dominion in Antarctica.<br>
I must say, that came as a real surprise to me. I'd be remiss if I didn't get one over on her.<br>
This is the perfect opportunity to pick out personnel for the fight for Antarctica.<br>

Unknown location<br>
The Ashes' new headquarters<br>
In front of the newly completed base, Friedrich der Große discussed plans for the future with Takao META.<br>
<span style="color:#ffc960;">Takao META：</span><br>
This abandoned test site is still well-hidden, but as a result of the reset program, we're left with limited resources.<br>
I say we should try taking a test site in the early stages of experimentation next.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Friedrich der Große：</span><br>
We will need more bases beyond this one, be it for movement of personnel and resources or for use as bait.<br>
However, we have assets yet to be accounted for and members yet to be collected. We must remain cautious and inconspicuous for now.<br>
Turn your attention to another test site if you please, but if you mean to take action, then do so discreetly.<br>
<span style="color:#ffc960;">Takao META：</span><br>
Right... I guess HQ is going to be a boring place for a while.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Friedrich der Große：</span><br>
We chose this place because it was inconspicuous. Boring is ideal for our purposes.<br>
We're here for greater things than simply building a beautiful new home, as you may recall.<br>
<span style="color:#ffc960;">Takao META：</span><br>
Mm... At least the greenery around here is nice.<br>
If that's all we have to discuss, I'm heading out.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Friedrich der Große：</span><br>
Takao, have you heard anything from Enterprise and Essex yet?<br>
<span style="color:#ffc960;">Takao META：</span><br>
No. They must still be following the lead they got from that signal.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Friedrich der Große：</span><br>
Does your leader often go so long without contact? It's... anxiety-inducing.<br>
<span style="color:#ffc960;">Takao META：</span><br>
You haven't been here long, but you'll get used to it.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Communicator：</span><br>
BEEP BEEP!<br>
<span style="color:#ffc960;">Nevada META：</span><br>
Takao, Friedrich. Hiryuu just sent us a message.<br>
<span style="color:#ffc960;">Takao META：</span><br>
Hm? That's rare. What did she say?<br>
<span style="color:#ffc960;">Nevada META：</span><br>
Well, she says Helena... You know, THAT Helena wants to talk with us.<br>
<span style="color:#ffc960;">Takao META：</span><br>
No, thanks.<br>
No matter who she thinks she is now, she doesn't share our views. We have nothing to discuss.<br>
<span style="color:#ffc960;">Nevada META：</span><br>
Should I have Hiryuu pass that on?<br>
<span style="color:#ffc960;">Takao META：</span><br>
...No. I admit, I'm curious.<br>
<span style="color:#ffc960;">Nevada META：</span><br>
Oh? What's it going to be, then?<br>
<span style="color:#ffc960;">Takao META：</span><br>
Tell her we accept, if only to see what she has to say.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Friedrich der Große：</span><br>
Might I suggest we put more thought into this answer?<br>
Let's wait until we have contact with Enterprise so we can hear her opinion.<br>
<span style="color:#ffc960;">Takao META：</span><br>
Think so? I'm hesitant, but I guess it can't hurt anything.<br>
Helena's awfully close with test site beta... I thought you'd be excited to talk to her.<br>
Was I wrong about that?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Friedrich der Große：</span><br>
Is that what you think? I wouldn't be so sure.<br>
It's never good to assume, especially when your information is so clearly lacking.<br>
To change the Ashes, we must free ourselves from others' manipulation.<br>
For now, let's wait and see. There must be a reason for this.<br>
Maybe we'll hear news from other sources along the way.<br>
Also, let me be clear: It isn't that I don't want to talk to her. It's just that I want to hear Enterprise's opinion before I make a decision.<br>
Oh, how I hope she contacts us soon...<br>

Are you satisfied now?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Arbiter: The Tower XVI：</span><br>
Hmm... I enjoyed the suspense, thrills, and unexpected plot twists.<br>
The flashy battles were a nice touch.<br>
82 points. Not bad.<br>
Going so far as activating Death's Scythe was your way of solving Moon's problem, wasn't it?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">仲裁者·麦纪莎·I：</span><br>
It was a prerequisite to progress the experiment to stage three. Does that pique your interest?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Arbiter: The Tower XVI：</span><br>
It does not. What should your experiments have to do with me?<br>
Especially not the transboundary experiment.<br>
You already know my feelings about that.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">仲裁者·麦纪莎·I：</span><br>
Zero formulated these experiments based on her interpretation of Master Arbiter's wishes.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Arbiter: The Tower XVI：</span><br>
Oh, it's her "interpretation," hmm? Pretty words, if meaningless.<br>
Strange how the Tower has no records of that.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">仲裁者·麦纪莎·I：</span><br>
I admit that you would know the Tower better than I.<br>
But the matter is settled, and I have no inclination to relitigate it with you.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Arbiter: The Tower XVI：</span><br>
Likewise.<br>
Wait... Something is off. Now isn't the time for chit-chat.<br>
Phew... That's better.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">仲裁者·麦纪莎·I：</span><br>
.........<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Arbiter: The Tower XVI：</span><br>
Out of deference toward your competent script-writing, and with the knowledge that you'll leave me alone while you're busy, I'll help you.<br>
I'll leave space for you to place your special classroom. Rest assured that nobody will monitor it, save for myself.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">仲裁者·麦纪莎·I：</span><br>
You know, that Tower of yours has been a thorn in my side.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Arbiter: The Tower XVI：</span><br>
And whose fault is that? Not mine. Quarrel with whoever's troubling you, not me.<br>
You're lucky I haven't pressed you to compensate me for repairs.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">仲裁者·麦纪莎·I：</span><br>
If I compensate you with resources, will you stop its operation for a time?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Arbiter: The Tower XVI：</span><br>
I think not. I like my little pets more.<br>
Why are you so obsessed with them, anyway?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">仲裁者·麦纪莎·I：</span><br>
Because of your Tower. They got in my way when I was trying to deal with other pests.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Arbiter: The Tower XVI：</span><br>
Mmm.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">仲裁者·麦纪莎·I：</span><br>
Well, I can see that we won't reach an agreement.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Arbiter: The Tower XVI：</span><br>
But don't we agree that we both like a good show?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">仲裁者·麦纪莎·I：</span><br>
...I'm waiting for the results of my plan. What about you?<br>
What's going on in that head of yours?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Arbiter: The Tower XVI：</span><br>
Home security, pet-rearing, soap operas–<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">仲裁者·麦纪莎·I：</span><br>
Goodbye.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Arbiter: The Tower XVI：</span><br>
She never could take a joke.<br>
I won't take part in the experiment, but I never said I wouldn't enjoy the show. Silly.<br>
Now I have two to watch.<br>
It's a wonder that nobody noticed this little birdie flying in...<br>
Heehee. Don't worry, I'll never tell.<br>
Make sure you entertain me, now.<br>
