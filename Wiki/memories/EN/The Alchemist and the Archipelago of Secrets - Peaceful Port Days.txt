The Alchemist and the Archipelago of Secrets - Peaceful Port Days<br>
<br>
1 Hot Spring Race<br>
This story takes place after the trouble in the Mirror Sea. It was an ordinary day like any other...<br>
Somewhere in a place some distance away from the port...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Akashi：</span><br>
Hehehe. The rumors are true, nya! There IS a nice hot spring hidden among the rocks here, nya.<br>
I just have to set up an inn, and I'll make a pretty penny off of...<br>
...Huh? Oh shoot, someone's coming, nya!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Alfredo Oriani：</span><br>
Come here, quick, Ema! I've found it!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Emanuele Pessagno：</span><br>
Hmm... Yeah, I think you're right. You couldn't ask for better conditions for a hot spring.<br>
With a bit of work, you could make this place into something special.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Alfredo Oriani：</span><br>
Heheheh! I can see the headlines already – "Sardegna reveals plans to construct a new hot spring"!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Emanuele Pessagno：</span><br>
There's a problem, though... These rocks are extremely sturdy. We'd need a literal ton of explosives to break through.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Alfredo Oriani：</span><br>
That's true... Oh, I know! We'll just ask Ryza to help out! She's like, the leading expert in the field of making bombs with alchemy, isn't she?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Emanuele Pessagno：</span><br>
Hey, yeah... She might be able to put together something for us if we ask nicely.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Alfredo Oriani：</span><br>
Sounds like a plan! Then Operation Hot Spring is a go!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Akashi：</span><br>
God dangit, nya! I thought nobody else knew about this place, nya!<br>
Lesson learned – never underestimate a journalist's info-gathering skills, nya...<br>
But luckily, they need assistance to make up for their lack of budget, nya... Mwahaha! My budget is infinite, nya!<br>
That doesn't mean this'll be a walk in the park though, nya. I'll probably run into Sirens going to and from this place, nya. I'll need to hire bodyguards, nya...<br>
It's now a race to claim the hot spring for yourself, nya... I need to get a move on, nya!<br>

炼金术师与秘密遗迹群岛-日常篇<br>
<br>
二 神奇的炼金术！<br>
港区·莱莎的炼金工房（暂设）<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">ReisalinStout：</span><br>
在惊心动魄的冒险结束之后，生活又恢复了平静的日常。<br>
听说回家的装置似乎还要维修一段时间……<br>
不过这里的指挥官真是大方啊，不但免费提供了房间，而且只要去港区食堂的话吃饭也是免费……<br>
王都也有炼金工房和咖啡，不过在这里竟然也不用担心衣食住行和工房的事，真是太好了～<br>
呼呼呼，今天用炼金术调合些什么好呢♪——<br>
<br>
（敲门声）<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">ReisalinStout：</span><br>
嗯？是有客人么？请进————<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Alfredo Oriani：</span><br>
莱莎，打扰了~<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Leonardo da Vinci：</span><br>
打扰了！<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">ReisalinStout：</span><br>
欢迎来到莱莎的炼金工房（暂设），两位和阿尔弗雷多一样都是撒丁帝国的同伴吧？<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Leonardo da Vinci：</span><br>
没错没错~我是达·芬奇，旁边的是托里拆利。<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Torricelli：</span><br>
嗯……莱莎小姐，你好……<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">ReisalinStout：</span><br>
托里拆利小姐你好——哇啊……！<br>
看起来一副严重睡眠不足的样子，托里拆利小姐你没事吧！<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Torricelli：</span><br>
啊哈哈……不用担心我，我一直就是这样的状态……<br>
比起这个，炼金术士小姐，让我们开始工作吧……<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">ReisalinStout：</span><br>
好啊~不过工作是指……？<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Leonardo da Vinci：</span><br>
欸？阿尔弗雷多昨天没有跟你说么？<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Alfredo Oriani：</span><br>
啊？！这个不应该是达·芬奇来说么……？<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Torricelli：</span><br>
……我理解现状了，其实我们今天过来是有一件事想拜托莱莎小姐……<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">ReisalinStout：</span><br>
嗯嗯嗯……原来如此，为了开发温泉，需要威力很大的炸弹对吧！<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Leonardo da Vinci：</span><br>
没错，那里的岩石十分坚硬，需要相当威力的炸弹才行。<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">ReisalinStout：</span><br>
我想想……也许有一个可行的超强力炸弹配方……<br>
嘿嘿，最近来了之后看到了很多新素材也有了新灵感，正好想做点什么……嗯，就拿这个试试吧！<br>
嗯…强力的炸弹的话…要用的素材是……<br>
<br>
莱莎拿起一张便签纸，在上面飞快地写了一串名字。<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Alfredo Oriani：</span><br>
看啊，达·芬奇、托里拆利，这就是炼金术配方！<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Leonardo da Vinci：</span><br>
这就是炼金术配方……简直像某种咒文一样……<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Torricelli：</span><br>
用这些材料相互反应真的可以做出炸弹么……？<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">ReisalinStout：</span><br>
可以哦！<br>
不过现在工坊刚刚成立，还没收集过素材，可以拜托大家跟我一起去找么！<br>
就算还没记住素材的名字，依靠描述应该也能找到对应素材的！<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Leonardo da Vinci：</span><br>
当然没问题，原本就是我们先来麻烦你的。<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Alfredo Oriani：</span><br>
向导就包在我身上吧，没有人比我更熟悉港区周边的各种隐秘地点了√<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Leonardo da Vinci：</span><br>
顺便也让托里拆利见一见阳光~我们这就出发吧？<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Torricelli：</span><br>
这一切都是为了能见识到炼金术的牺牲……<br>
<br>
在四人的不懈努力下，制作炸弹所需要的材料收集完成了。<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Torricelli：</span><br>
哈啊……在外面活动果然是一件让人讨厌的事情啊……<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">ReisalinStout：</span><br>
各位辛苦了！接下来就看我的炼金术吧！<br>
<br>
莱莎把刚刚收集到的材料倒入了那口巨大的炼金釜中，开始搅拌起来。<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Torricelli：</span><br>
终于要开始了……神秘的炼金术……<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Leonardo da Vinci：</span><br>
托里拆利，站远一点……我感觉有什么不得了的东西要出现了！<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">ReisalinStout：</span><br>
没错没错~！就是这种感觉！要做出很厉害的东西了！<br>
<br>
伴随着嘭的一声，炼金釜中散发出了奇异的光芒。<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">ReisalinStout：</span><br>
太好了，做到了！<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Leonardo da Vinci：</span><br>
这个可是，一看就让人能感觉到这是个相当危险的东西呢……<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Torricelli：</span><br>
明明看起来毫不相关的材料，却能变成意想不到的东西，其中究竟蕴含着何种科学原理……<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">ReisalinStout：</span><br>
哼哼，只要用炼金术的话什么都能做出来哦！不对，好像有点说的太过了……<br>
炸弹只要这么多就可以了么？<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Alfredo Oriani：</span><br>
唔……就算威力足够大恐怕也不够用。请稍等，我再去按照配方收集一些材料来！<br>

<br>
3 Learning the Ropes<br>
Port - Training Area<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Lila Decyrus：</span><br>
So this is the area of the sea where they all train. It's every bit as vast as I've heard.<br>
...Hm? Who is that over there?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Choukai：</span><br>
Okay, Takao. The targets are ready for you.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Takao：</span><br>
I see. Then I shall begin now... Swift death unto evil!<br>
<br>
KABOOOM!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Lila Decyrus：</span><br>
You took out both the close and the distant targets in one fell swoop. Very impressive.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Takao：</span><br>
It's nothing worthy of... Oh, I haven't met you before. Could you be Miss Lila Decyrus, one of the new arrivals at port?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Lila Decyrus：</span><br>
I am. Just call me Lila.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Takao：</span><br>
Very well. I am Takao of the Sakura Empire. This is Choukai, one of my sister ships.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Choukai：</span><br>
It's nice to meet you. Did you come to train as well, Miss Lila?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Lila Decyrus：</span><br>
Yeah. I'm still learning the ropes of my "rigging" as you call it. I had some spare time, so I thought I'd use it to practice.<br>
Having just seen what you're capable of, I feel like the skill gap between me and everyone else has only widened.<br>
I would've never thought you could fight at close quarters whilst firing a volley with such grace...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Takao：</span><br>
If you'd like some advice, I suggest not treating your rigging as a niche weapon, but rather as an extension of your body.<br>
Use it with your mind, not your strength, and it will move as if it were a part of you.<br>
Then you will realize that your cannons are more than just cannons, like how a sword is more than just a long blade.<br>
Additionally, your firepower is strongest when you unleash your full volley. However, you can fire individual shots when the situation calls for it.<br>
As for swinging a melee weapon without disrupting your aim, it is possible, albeit difficult.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Choukai：</span><br>
You'll likely want to practice that, Miss Lila, since your claws and your main cannons appear to be interconnected.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Lila Decyrus：</span><br>
You're right, I should. Would you two be willing to spar with me?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Choukai：</span><br>
Absolutely. Takao has been training all day, though, so she should take a break. Let's start with just you and me.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Takao：</span><br>
If you insist. Remember, while she may not have mastered her rigging yet, she is indisputably a seasoned warrior. Do not underestimate her.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Choukai：</span><br>
I won't!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Lila Decyrus：</span><br>
Well then, Choukai... Show me what you've got.<br>
Let's see how you handle THIS!<br>
<br>
KABOOOM!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Choukai：</span><br>
Phew... That was close. You're a skilled fighter, Miss Lila. Do you feel you're getting the hang of your rigging now?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Lila Decyrus：</span><br>
I'm getting better with each fight, though I still can't compare to you.<br>
(That said, it is surprisingly fun to be learning under someone.)<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Akashi：</span><br>
Nice fighting there, nya.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Takao：</span><br>
Akashi? You're a rare sight around these parts. Have you come to hone your skills?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Akashi：</span><br>
"Skills" like what, nya? My ability to perform repairs while under fire, nya?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Takao：</span><br>
I didn't think of that, but that would be worth practicing, yes.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Akashi：</span><br>
Ahahaha... I was joking, nya. I'm just here to deliver your lunch, nya. It's on that transport ship over there, nya.<br>
Go on and grab your food, nya. I'll just be over here with Lila for a bit, nya.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Choukai：</span><br>
Lunch? Why, thank you! Are you sure you don't want to eat with us?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Akashi：</span><br>
I've got business with her, nya. We'll join you after we're done talking, nya.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Lila Decyrus：</span><br>
What do you want, Akashi? It must be important if it's in private.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Akashi：</span><br>
Ahem... See, I discovered a hot spring on an island not far from here, nya.<br>
The problem is, some mass-produced Sirens like to hang out around there, nya. I need someone to take care of 'em, nya.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Lila Decyrus：</span><br>
A hot spring? I'm intrigued.<br>
(Moreover, some real battles would be the best way to rack up rigging experience.)<br>
Alright. I'll do it.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Akashi：</span><br>
Great, nya! I knew I could count on you, nya.<br>
Let's set off at once, nya! I'll explain why you had to leave to them later, nya.<br>

<br>
4 A Royal Tea Party<br>
Port - Royal Navy dormitory<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Illustrious：</span><br>
We are honoured to have you at our tea party today, Miss Patricia.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Patricia Abelheim：</span><br>
Please, I'm just honored to have been invited.<br>
All the more so considering you're said to be a very high-class lady, Miss Illustrious.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Illustrious：</span><br>
Hehehe. You needn't be so modest. We are all friends here at port.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Belfast：</span><br>
Would you like some tea, Miss Patricia?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Patricia Abelheim：</span><br>
Yes, please. Thank you.<br>
<br>
Patricia takes a sip from her cup of tea.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Patricia Abelheim：</span><br>
Oh!<br>
(It's hard to find tea this sublime even in the Royal Capital... These ladies know their stuff.)<br>
(I can also tell it was intricately brewed based on this rich fragrance... That maid is definitely no ordinary housekeeper.)<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Illustrious：</span><br>
What do you think? I hope it is to your taste.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Patricia Abelheim：</span><br>
It's delicious. I feel incredibly privileged to get to drink something this wonderful!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Illustrious：</span><br>
Hehe. It relieves me to know that you like it.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Patricia Abelheim：</span><br>
By the way, Miss Illustrious, you are free to call me "Patty" instead.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Illustrious：</span><br>
In that case, you're also free to simply call me "Illustrious." On another subject, do you feel like you've grown accustomed to life here at port?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Patricia Abelheim：</span><br>
Yes, I do. I've settled in quite well, thanks to the Commander and so many others.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Illustrious：</span><br>
That is good to hear. If you ever need guidance, you may come talk to me whenever you like.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Belfast：</span><br>
I've brought biscuits. Would you like some, Miss Patricia?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Patricia Abelheim：</span><br>
Why, yes, I would. Thank you.<br>
<br>
The elegant and courtly tea party continues. Then, the still mood is disrupted by shouting.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Formidable：</span><br>
Illustrious! We've returned from our expedition! You're not going to believe what we saw... out...<br>
Oh...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Indomitable：</span><br>
Ahem. Good day to you, Miss Patricia. We appreciate that you could be our guest at this tea party.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Patricia Abelheim：</span><br>
Huh? Um... Thank you for having me.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Illustrious：</span><br>
I presume you've already met Formidable. She is one of my sisters, as is this other lady. Her name is Indomitable.<br>
I have one more sister, Victorious, who unfortunately can't join us today as she is on a mission. I'd have loved to introduce her to you.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Patricia Abelheim：</span><br>
Ah, I see... It's a pleasure to meet you, Miss Indomitable. I'm Patricia, one of the new residents here at port. If I may ask, what was Formidable about to say?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Indomitable：</span><br>
N-nothing important, I'm sure! If you'll excuse me and her, we'll go and get changed now. Please do carry on with your conversation.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Patricia Abelheim：</span><br>
Okay...?<br>
Apropos of nothing, Miss Ryza told me that Sardegna plans to open a hot spring. Have you ladies heard about that?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Illustrious：</span><br>
That we have. We've already made plans for after the hot spring has been excavated.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Formidable：</span><br>
There's also been talks of erecting a building where one can relax after they've finished bathing.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Indomitable：</span><br>
Yes. Her Majesty has announced that the Royal Navy will supply the food and beverages as well.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Patricia Abelheim：</span><br>
Interesting. That being the case, I'd like to ask for a favor...<br>
Would you let me assist in the hot spring's development? I want to help people out as much as I can.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Illustrious：</span><br>
Of course you can! As a matter of fact, we've yet to reach an agreement with Sardegna regarding the decorations around the hot spring.<br>
I'd like you to handle that detail, if you feel up to the task.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Patricia Abelheim：</span><br>
Yes, I'd love to!<br>
<br>
And so, the tea party became enriched with an air of enthusiasm.<br>

<br>
5 Teamwork Makes the Dream Work<br>
Area near the port - Hot spring island<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Alfredo Oriani：</span><br>
Okay! The time has finally come to use these bad boy bombs!<br>
<br>
Alfredo sets fire to the fuse and quickly runs behind cover.<br>
Fssshhhh...<br>
BOOOOM!<br>
KABOOOOOOM!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Alfredo Oriani：</span><br>
Heck yeah! Ryza's bombs did just the trick!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Leonardo da Vinci：</span><br>
I dunno, I think that blast was way overkill... Also, why were there TWO explosions?<br>
<br>
Once the smoke clears, the Sardegnian girls lay eyes on a hot spring bigger than their wildest expectations. They then catch sight of a familiar figure...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Akashi：</span><br>
*cough cough*... That scared the life out of me, nya! What the heck was that, nya?!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Alfredo Oriani：</span><br>
Hey, it's Akashi! And Shiranui! How'd you get here? I made sure that nobody else was here, like, a minute ago...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Akashi：</span><br>
We're excavating a hot spring and were just about to set off the TNT we'd put down, nya.<br>
Then we heard a huge boom when neither of us had touched the detonator, so we came to investigate, nya!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Shiranui：</span><br>
Since you are all here, I think I can guess what happened...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Alfredo Oriani：</span><br>
If your guess is that we are also excavating a hot spring, you'd be correct! We found and claimed this place in Sardegna's name!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Torricelli：</span><br>
Not quite... I think we discovered two separate hot springs, but those huge explosions made them merge into one...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Alfredo Oriani：</span><br>
Wait, seriously? Uh, in that case, how about we work together to establish one single huge hot spring inn? The bigger, the better for everyone!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Akashi：</span><br>
Hmm... I guess that's the only realistic option at this point, nya.<br>
A bigger inn also equals bigger earnings... so you know what, I'm in, nya!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Shiranui：</span><br>
As am I. There remains the issue that the supplies we prepared will not suffice for a much larger inn, however. We will need additional manpower.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Klaudia Valentz：</span><br>
Heheh, I think I can help with that!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Akashi：</span><br>
Klaudia? How'd you find this place, nya?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Klaudia Valentz：</span><br>
I heard about it through Ryza, then I thought helping you all out would be a way to repay you for all your help.<br>
I should be able to procure supplies for you. I've got all kinds of experience working in business.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Akashi：</span><br>
That expertise would be amazing to have, nya! Thanks, nya!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Klaudia Valentz：</span><br>
You're welcome. Having said that, I don't think my help alone will be enough. We'll need some more people to get all the additional supplies...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Charles Ausburne：</span><br>
Heheh! That's where I come in! When you're in a tight spot, Captain Ausburne of the Little Beavers has you covered!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Cleveland：</span><br>
The Knights of the Sea, a.k.a. the Cleveland class is here too! Hope you don't mind us helping out with your cool project!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Montpelier：</span><br>
Cleve looks super hyped... I've gotta give this my all.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Klaudia Valentz：</span><br>
Huh? What's brought you all here?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Cleveland：</span><br>
Same thing as you. We heard someone's working on a hot spring and wanted to check it out.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Alfredo Oriani：</span><br>
Hey, don't forget about us! We're the ones who found this spot in the first place!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Klaudia Valentz：</span><br>
Heheh, don't worry, we hear you. Now we should have all the help we're going to need!<br>
Okay, it's time to get to work, everyone!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Akashi：</span><br>
Woohoo! Let's get this hot spring inn built, nya!<br>

<br>
6 Flowers<br>
Port - Outskirts<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Serri Glaus：</span><br>
I've never seen a plant like this before... Nor this one...<br>
I suppose it's to be expected that different worlds have different vegetation...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Hanazuki：</span><br>
Um, hello. Are you looking for some flowers?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Serri Glaus：</span><br>
Yes, in fact. Who are you?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Hanazuki：</span><br>
Oh, I should've introduced myself first! I'm Hanazuki from the Sakura Empire. If I remember correctly, you're... Miss Serri, right?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Serri Glaus：</span><br>
Yes. Nice to meet you.<br>
Actually... Earlier while I was looking for seeds, I remember hearing about a girl around port who's especially fond of flowers. I don't suppose that's you they were talking about?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Hanazuki：</span><br>
I'm humbled that you've heard of me.<br>
Picking flowers is the reason I came out here, in fact. I'm working on a floral arrangement, but I'm struggling to decide on which species to use since there are so many...<br>
Seeing as you're here as well, are flowers your hobby by any chance, Miss Serri?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Serri Glaus：</span><br>
Not exactly, but you're pretty close. I'm specifically looking for a flower with potent purifying properties.<br>
Do you know any flowers like that, Hanazuki?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Hanazuki：</span><br>
Purifying properties? Umm, do you mean something akin to an air freshener?<br>
Then I would suggest this one, a species of aloe. You can leave it in a vase to freshen up the air in a room.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Serri Glaus：</span><br>
So this is what you call "aloe"... Interesting.<br>
<br>
Serri inquisitively touches the flower, then softly shakes her head.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Serri Glaus：</span><br>
You're right, it probably would purify the air. However, that's not the kind of purifying I'm after.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Hanazuki：</span><br>
Oh, I see... Well, you might find what you need not far from here.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Serri Glaus：</span><br>
I really doubt I will. Ryza and I have only found a single flower with the right properties after we searched countless places.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Hanazuki：</span><br>
That's... unfortunate.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Serri Glaus：</span><br>
We went through a lot in order to find that flower... Now, however, I look back fondly on our adventures.<br>
Oh, that reminds me. You said you can't decide on a flower to use, right? How about this one?<br>
While it hasn't fully bloomed yet, touching it fills me with a kind of warmth. I think it represents warm feelings of love and affection.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Hanazuki：</span><br>
Ah, that flower is called a "carnation." You know, I think that's quite a nice suggestion. I'll use this one.<br>
Incidentally, how do you know about one of its symbolisms? Do carnations exist in your world, too?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Serri Glaus：</span><br>
It's an ability I have as a member of the Green Plume clan. We can figure out most things about plants by just looking at them.<br>
...It's easier to show than to explain. Do you have some plant seeds on you?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Hanazuki：</span><br>
I do, in fact. Here you go.<br>
<br>
Hanazuki takes out a couple of seeds and hands them to Serri. She makes guess after guess at what they grow into and, miraculously, is correct every time.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Hanazuki：</span><br>
Wow, that's incredible! I wish I had an ability like that...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Serri Glaus：</span><br>
I'd say you're already immensely knowledgeable about flowers even without my ability.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Hanazuki：</span><br>
Aww, thank you. If I learn anything about a plant like what you're looking for, I'll be sure to tell you as soon as possible.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Serri Glaus：</span><br>
Thanks. I appreciate it.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Suzutsuki ：</span><br>
Hey, there you are, Hanazuki! I've been looking for you!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Hanazuki：</span><br>
Suzutsuki? What's the matter?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Suzutsuki ：</span><br>
Akashi and a whole bunch of people are building a new hot spring inn. They need someone who knows flowers, and I thought who'd be better for the job than you, right?<br>
So, if you've got some time, could you give us a hand?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Hanazuki：</span><br>
Of course. I'll pick some flowers right now and bring them with me!<br>
Oh, and Miss Serri, would you mind accompanying me? I think I could do an even better job if I could ask for your wisdom.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Serri Glaus：</span><br>
Sure. Ryza told me about the project, and I want to help you all in any way I can.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Suzutsuki ：</span><br>
Perfect! Follow me, then!<br>

The Alchemist and the Archipelago of Secrets - Peaceful Port Days<br>
<br>
7 All in a Day's Work<br>
Now, after all that labor, the hot spring inn is finally complete.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">ReisalinStout：</span><br>
Okay, I say let's raise a toast to everyone's hard work!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">The Team：</span><br>
To everyone's hard work!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">ReisalinStout：</span><br>
Whew. It makes me happy to see people's efforts pay off.<br>
And what a great hot spring we made. I knew all that labor was worth it after my quick dip which totally cleared my mind.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Klaudia Valentz：</span><br>
Yeah, I also never thought my business knowledge would be useful in the creation of an inn.<br>
Although, I was pretty nervous about having to suddenly coordinate that many people.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">ReisalinStout：</span><br>
You did it well, Klaudia. And for all your hard work, you geeet... yummy boiled eggs! Have a bite!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Klaudia Valentz：</span><br>
Nom... Hmm, did you boil these in hot spring water?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">ReisalinStout：</span><br>
Yup! Some Sakura Empire girls taught me how. They said they're a great pre-breakfast snack. Pretty good, aren't they?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Klaudia Valentz：</span><br>
Yeah, really good! You should try one yourself.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Patricia Abelheim：</span><br>
*sigh*...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Lila Decyrus：</span><br>
Is something the matter, Patricia?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Patricia Abelheim：</span><br>
Oh, no, it's nothing. I was just thinking about how nice everyone here is.<br>
Some Royal Navy ladies invited me to a tea party the other day, and they were also really kind to me. The tea and biscuits they served were lovely, too.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Serri Glaus：</span><br>
That's nice. Speaking of their tea, I wonder if the Royal Navy's tea leaves are locally sourced. If not, do they have to import them from far away?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Patricia Abelheim：</span><br>
You could come with me to their next tea party and ask if you'd like, Miss Serri. I'm sure Miss Illustrious would be happy to have you.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Serri Glaus：</span><br>
...I could, yes. Staying here for a while longer sounds nice.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Akashi：</span><br>
Sorry to interrupt, nya!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">ReisalinStout：</span><br>
Hey, Akashi! Want a drink?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Akashi：</span><br>
Thanks, but I have something to... Huh? What's the pink stuff in that teacup you've got, nya? I've never seen anything like it, nya!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">ReisalinStout：</span><br>
This? It's what we call nectar! I synthesized it using alchemy.<br>
Not only is it yummy, but it's also a solid revival potion.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Akashi：</span><br>
Ooh... I smell money to be made, nya...<br>
Wait, I'm supposed to deliver a message, nya! The Commander wanted me to tell you that dinner is ready, nya!<br>
Come with me, nya. The party is only getting started, nya!<br>
