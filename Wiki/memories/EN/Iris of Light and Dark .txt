<br>
Every Light Must Cast a Shadow<br>
In the thousands of years in which our civilization has blossomed and wilted, within the light of every Golden Age has lurked the shadow of war.<br>
From Hastings, to Trafalgar, to Waterloo...<br>
From the most primitive stone knife to the thunderous roar of a ship's cannons...<br>
One cannot spark the flames of lofty ideals...<br>
without also casting the shadow of fear and sacrifice across the lands.<br>
But it is only from within the shadows that the light of hope can be clearly seen.<br>
That is why those who sacrifice everything for freedom are forever engraved in the annals of history.<br>
That is the foundation of our glory, and of our faith.<br>
That is my will, and the banner that I fly as I press forward.<br>
And thus, I lay down my life...<br>
In the name of the light of liberty.<br>
"Iris of Light and Dark"<br>
"Méditerranée." the world's largest land-bound sea, boasts a particular climate not frequently found elsewhere in the world - a scorching, dry summer and a warm, rainy winter.<br>
It is also the cradle for some of humanity's most ancient civilizations. Today, over twenty countries share its borders.<br>
Throughout its thousands of years of human history, countless civilizations have risen and fallen here.<br>
And now, a storm once again brews...<br>
On the calm sea, three battleships and an aircraft carrier can be seen, accompanied by over a dozen escorts.<br>
Arethusa：<br>
Reporting! All calm on the sea today. Our fleet is rapidly approaching Mers-el-Kébir.<br>
Ark Royal：<br>
So it's come to this... even if they used to be our mortal enemies for generations, we've fought on the same side for a while now. I didn't think we'd get an order like this...<br>
Hood：<br>
I'm sure Headquarters has their reasons. Once a country has been taken over by the Iron Blood, they can no longer be considered our allies.<br>
Ark Royal：<br>
That's a pity... but...<br>
Hood：<br>
The Vichya Dominion now commands the fourth largest navy in the world. They've become the greatest immediate threat to the Royal Navy.<br>
In order to not repeat the mistakes of the Iris Orthodoxy, we must strip them of their fangs before the Iron Blood turns them upon our homeland.<br>
Ark Royal：<br>
Hood...<br>
Hood：<br>
You don't need to have such a grave expression. We're not going to sink them, you know? Let's just say, we'll be giving them a chance to elect a new government.<br>
Nobody wants a repeat of what happened a hundred years ago at Trafalgar, right?<br>
Arethusa：<br>
I've detected Siren signals! I believe they belong to the new Executor-class!<br>
Hood：<br>
All members of the H Fleet, attention! Be on alert, and prepare for battle! Siren fleet detected at 12 o'clock!<br>

Ark Royal：<br>
According to the scouting report, there are four battleships, one light carrier, and six destroyers stationed at port, but none of them seem to be operational.<br>
However, it appears that the Siren forces are blockading them. If we are to enter the port, we have to break through their lines first.<br>
Hood：<br>
The Templar Knights have fallen in with the Sirens...? 'tis a sad day indeed...<br>
Ark Royal：<br>
Curiously, two of the important battleships that we were targeting are missing.<br>
Hood：<br>
That might work to our advantage. It would be a much harder fight with those two here.<br>
The purpose of our operation today is to issue a warning, and to perhaps convince them to choose a different path... We want to avoid unnecessary bloodshed.<br>
But let's set that aside for later... Now, let's break through the Siren blockade!<br>

Dunkerque：<br>
I've been expecting you, dear guests from the Royal Navy.<br>
Hood：<br>
Good day. I am Hood, flagship of the Royal Navy's H Fleet. We've come to offer our warm regards.<br>
<br>
Hood picked up the hem of her skirt and offered an elegant curtsy as was customary of the Royal Navy.<br>
Dunkerque：<br>
I am Battlecruiser Dunkerque. May the Heavenly Father, Son, and Holy Spirit bless you.<br>
<br>
Dunkerque, the dashing knight from the Vichya Dominion, drew a cross across her chest while speaking.<br>
Hood：<br>
I do hope that you understand the reason we are here today. The Royal Navy would like your cooperation in halting the advances of Iron Blood.<br>
Dunkerque：<br>
The Templar Knights will not bow to any foreign power.<br>
Hood：<br>
In that case, I shall give you four options.<br>
First: Leave with us right now, and enlist in the Royal Navy in our fight against Iron Blood and the Crimson Axis.<br>
Second: Completely disarm. In return, the Royal Navy shall offer safe harbor for all of you.<br>
Third: Allow us to escort you to the Eagle Union, where they shall disarm you.<br>
Or, the final option we would rather not see: Sink right here and now.<br>
Dunkerque：<br>
... Is this your ultimatum? And what if all your options are unacceptable to us?<br>
Hood：<br>
Then I hope you won't take it personally when we simply follow the orders we were given... and disarm you forcefully.<br>
Dunkerque：<br>
... ...<br>
Hood：<br>
I cannot tell you what it is you need to do for your country, but... as a warrior, it should be your duty to fight for your homeland. I hope that you can reconsider and join our fight.<br>
Dunkerque：<br>
I decline your offer.<br>
<br>
Dunkerque brandished her saber at Hood with determination in her eyes.<br>
Dunkerque：<br>
The Templar Knights are loyal to our Cardinal and to our faith. We will not take orders from anyone else.<br>
And that includes the Iron Blood as well as the Empire. We shall never allow ourselves to become the instruments of their aggression.<br>
Hood：<br>
Well then, I hope you can back up your words by disarming right now.<br>
Dunkerque：<br>
It is clear to me how cynical your "alliance" is.<br>
Hood：<br>
Ever since Operation Dynamo, we've completely lost contact with your group.<br>
And now that even the Sirens have taken an interest in you, we no longer can trust your choices. Hopefully, you can understand where we're coming from.<br>
Dunkerque：<br>
These Sirens are mass-produced models funded by the Iron Blood, used to monitor our movements.<br>
We do owe you our gratitude for clearing out the blockade for us.<br>
Hood：<br>
We must take our leave now, but... we do hope to hear your official response soon.<br>
Dunkerque：<br>
Our official response is this: "The Royal Navy is not trustworthy. We will fight until our last breath."<br>
Hood：<br>
Is that so...<br>
It's about to rain...<br>

Arethusa：<br>
Confirming combat results... Dunkerque - heavily damaged. Provence - heavily damaged. Bretagne - sunk...<br>
Hood：<br>
...<br>
Ark Royal：<br>
What about Strasbourg?<br>
Arethusa：<br>
She managed to get through the naval mines and escaped during the night.<br>
Ark Royal：<br>
I suppose... that too is fine...<br>
Hood：<br>
In all my years of service, I never thought that I would have to turn my guns upon my allies...<br>
Ark Royal：<br>
It's not your fault. We don't have a choice as things currently stand.<br>
We were made to follow orders, from both Commander and Headquarters... as weapons...<br>
Hood：<br>
It'd be much easier if we were only weapons...<br>
Ark Royal：<br>
Hood...<br>
Hood：<br>
My apologies. I allowed my emotions to get the best of me.<br>
<br>
Hood removed her hat and bowed slightly, apologizing to Ark Royal.<br>
------- (Bzzzzzt...)<br>
Arethusa：<br>
We... we're receiving an area-wide broadcast!<br>
This is from... Richelieu?!<br>
Hood：<br>
We've been searching for her all this time, so why is she...<br>
Please track down the source of the signal!<br>
Arethusa：<br>
The signal is coming from...<br>
...<br>
... the Royal Navy<br>
<br>
... Brothers and sisters, awaken to my call!<br>
Our country has been shattered. Overnight, we became a puppet of the Crimson Axis.<br>
"Put down your weapons, and do not resist." This was the order that we were given.<br>
Iris's proud Templar Knights, tasked with preserving the teachings of the Orthodoxy, were declared defeated without even having an opportunity to fight.<br>
Just decades ago, our predecessors made countless sacrifices to reclaim the lands that were rightfully ours.<br>
But now, our country has once again been betrayed, sold off by those who have turned against the Scriptures!<br>
Due to their fear, they have thrown away their dignity and condemned us to slavery.<br>
Is there any greater humiliation than watching the Iron Blood tread all over our beloved Arc de Triomphe and Champ de Mars? No, there is not!<br>
Our immortal souls may patiently await salvation in Heaven, but our mortal country must be protected here and now, at all costs!<br>
From this moment forth, I declare the formation of Iris Libre!<br>
This standard was once flown by the Holy Virgin during the Hundred Years' War, and is a symbol for freedom and sacrifice. It shall once again fly in these lands.<br>
Brothers and sisters, awaken to my call! For the sake of our country's future, gather underneath this banner!<br>
Our country faces a grave peril, but we are not alone, nor are we helpless!<br>
Brothers and sisters, great power still dwells within you. It is time to awaken that power!<br>
In doing so, we will push back our enemies and emerge victorious. When that comes, we shall regain our lost glory!<br>
Remember, the light of God illuminates our path! Be steadfast in your convictions, and never lose hope!<br>
No matter what happens, the flames of liberty will never be extinguished!<br>
To all my brothers and sisters...<br>
May you all be blessed by Father, Son, and the Holy Spirit.<br>
Hood：<br>
...<br>
Ark Royal：<br>
Quite the stirring speech. So that's the girl who has become the new Cardinal...<br>
Hood：<br>
By the looks of things, the world order is about to shift once again.<br>
Ark Royal：<br>
Yes... I fear that the storm will grow even more.<br>

???：<br>
So, you're saying that humanity created us in order to counter the Veneto-class?<br>
Hm? Well, that's certainly true on paper.<br>
If that is the case, then we were made to be nothing more than instruments of death.<br>
I wouldn't say that. See, no matter what era it is, humans always cling to heroes to maintain their faith. They can't survive without it.<br>
In other words, we're supposed to be their heroes?<br>
Not yet, anyway. At least not until you're able to move... Heehee~<br>
Richelieu! You're mocking me again! But just you wait... I'm going to surpass you soon enough!<br>
I'll be looking forward to it. By the way, do you know what our names mean?<br>
Huh?<br>
Yes, the name that we inherited from a warship. It represents the great expectations that humanity has for us.<br>
Hmm... what was my name based upon again?<br>
Seems like... a mighty pirate ship... Suits you well, doesn't it?<br>
Huuh?! You're mocking me again! I won't let you get away with it a third time!<br>
All right, all right. But remember... whether you will be a glorious hero who protects the land, or an instrument of death and destruction... is a decision only you can make.<br>
... ...<br>
Don't do anything that will tarnish your noble name...<br>
Jean Bart：<br>
Another dream... How laughable.<br>
So what if the strongest battleship on the seas, the loftiest Templar Knight, has had to rely on the powers of others... Hmph.<br>
... And just what exactly is wrong with that? Foolish sister...<br>

Renown：<br>
Greetings, Allied Fleet. I'm Renown, from the Royal Navy. I've come to join you.<br>
Ranger：<br>
Task Force 34 Aircraft Carrier, Ranger. It's a pleasure to have you with us.<br>
Cleveland：<br>
Hello, hello! So you're the legendary Renown, huh? It's a relief to have someone as reliable as you here!<br>
Renown：<br>
Nay, I am honored to be here. Thank you for your cooperation. I intend to fully support this fleet's operations as well.<br>
Ranger：<br>
This will be a joint operation between the Royal Navy and the Eagle Union. Our objective is to secure the coastal landing for our ground forces.<br>
If we are able to establish a foothold and expand a new front to the south of the Mediterranean, we would be able to reduce the risk that the Crimson Axis poses to both the Royal Navy and the Northern Parliament.<br>
Cleveland：<br>
In other words, we'd be diverting their attention!<br>
Ranger：<br>
That's one way of looking at it, but this operation has much more strategic importance behind it. It's also important to our alliance.<br>
In any case, everyone, please welcome Renown to the fleet.<br>
Wichita：<br>
So, who are we gonna be fighting?<br>
Renown：<br>
Apart from the Sirens that will be blocking our advance, there is only one possible enemy.<br>
Massachusetts：<br>
The Vichya Dominion...<br>
Renown：<br>
That's correct. It's impossible to determine what the current situation is, but I would expect heavy resistance.<br>
Wichita：<br>
If they dare to aim their guns at us, we will teach them a painful lesson!<br>
Massachusetts：<br>
...<br>
Ranger：<br>
Here is a summary of the operation. We will commence in 60 minutes, but...<br>
Before that, we'll have to take out the Sirens that are approaching us!<br>

WARNING: Large numbers of enemy hostiles detected. All hands prepare for combat.<br>
WARNING: Large numbers of enemy hostiles detected. All hands prepare for combat.<br>
Jean Bart：<br>
You've come at last! "The storm brewing over the ocean..." I've waited two long years for you!<br>
Tell me, Richelieu, is this the outcome that you wished for?<br>
<br>
Cavaliers of the Vichya Dominion, our crusade begins now!<br>
Two years ago, our homeland was vandalized by invaders.<br>
They would resort to any unscrupulous means in order to seize our glorious navy!<br>
They lack any concept of chivalry, in the same way they lack any concept of faith.<br>
The only things they know are deception and betrayal!<br>
Dunkerque, Provence, Bretagne, we will always remember your names, as well as the humiliation we endured on that day!<br>
On that day, we did not stand and deliver.<br>
On that day, we chose to turn the other cheek.<br>
Does that mean that the true will of the Iris Orthodoxy, Vichya Dominion, is afraid of those who have made bargains with an outside enemy?<br>
Certainly not!<br>
On that day, we were indeed defeated. However, we were able to painfully learn the true nature of this world better than anyone else.<br>
The enemy was strong then. But we too have grown. We are no longer the same Vichya Dominion that we were before.<br>
Those evildoers were able to evade divine retribution once...<br>
And now they come for our homeland once more!<br>
They claim to want to "liberate us," to "give us the right to choose freely." Their platitudes are nothing more than honey laced with poison.<br>
"Render unto Caesar the things that are Caesar's, and unto God the things that are God's."<br>
Freedom is not something that can be obtained as someone else's prisoner! It can only be given by God!<br>
With the new powers that we possess, we are now unstoppable!<br>
Once again, Cavaliers of the Vichya Dominion, our crusade begins now!<br>
We shall now prove to the world that we are the true Iris Orthodoxy! Glory shall smile upon us!<br>
Que Dieu vous bénisse tous.<br>
All fleet members, take aim... and fiiiiiire!!<br>
Jenkins：<br>
V-V-Vichya warships are firing at us!<br>
Brooklyn：<br>
The landing force has sustained significant damage! Requesting backup!<br>
I repeat! The landing force has sustained significant damage! Requesting backup!<br>
Ranger：<br>
I knew it wouldn't be that easy...<br>
All air and sea forces, the mission has changed.<br>
Prioritize suppressing all shore defenses near Casablanca and begin landing operations there.<br>
Cleveland：<br>
So, looks like we've ended up fighting after all... Though, I won't get to show off if the enemy doesn't have any planes...<br>
Wooaaahhh! We're getting bombed by Siren planes?!<br>
Wichita：<br>
Don't let your guard down! I'll leave the air defense here to you! I'm going to find that Siren carrier and smash it to pieces!<br>

Massachusetts：<br>
These... err, zealots... have a pretty extreme fighting style...<br>
This shell... was fired from a large-caliber cannon. Is it her?<br>
What's her name again... Jean... Jean Ball?<br>
Ranger：<br>
It's Jean Bart.<br>
Massachusetts：<br>
Interesting. This battle might be a bit more worthwhile with her around.<br>
Ranger：<br>
Massachusetts, don't forget your duties as flagship of the Task Force.<br>
Massachusetts：<br>
Neutralize the enemy threat while minimizing the damage we sustain... Got it.<br>
I'll be off now.<br>
Wichita：<br>
I'm also good to go over here!<br>
Cleveland：<br>
Hey, wait up!<br>
Jenkins：<br>
I... I'll escort you!<br>
Ranger：<br>
Hold up, all of you...<br>
Ahh, jeez... why does nobody bother thinking before they act?!<br>
Air squadrons, provide support for our forces!<br>

Jean Bart：<br>
So you've finally returned, invaders!<br>
Cleveland：<br>
We're just here to recover what was taken by the Crimson Axis! We don't have to fight!<br>
Jean Bart：<br>
We won't be deceived again by your hypocritical little "alliance." We shall be the ones to protect our homeland!<br>
Cleveland：<br>
Look, I'm telling you! Nobody here is trying to occupy your lands!<br>
Massachusetts：<br>
Shush. There's no point trying to reason with these brainwashed zealots.<br>
Jean Bart：<br>
You, that battleship over there... South Dakota-class, huh? Heard you're the strongest battleship on that side of the ocean.<br>
Massachusetts：<br>
Flagship of Task Force 34 and 3rd ship of the South Dakota-class, Massachusetts.<br>
It is always an honor when my foes recognize me. Unfortunately, that doesn't change the fact that I'll have to sink you.<br>
Those girls in the landing force... That was your doing...<br>
Jean Bart：<br>
Mere riffraff without a shred of faith or conviction. Got a problem with that?<br>
Massachusetts：<br>
Riffraff...? Faith? The only faith that matters is the absolute firepower that I'm about to beat your miserable face to a pulp with!<br>
Jean Bart：<br>
Hmph. This is but an opportunity from God. If I defeat "the world's strongest," then perhaps Richelieu...<br>
Come at me! Jean Bart, second ship of the Richelieu-class battleships, shall face you!<br>
Massachusetts：<br>
Show me what you've got, "the Ocean's strongest battleship!"<br>
{{折叠面板|内容结束}}

Ranger：<br>
Dauntless, press the attack!<br>
Massachusetts：<br>
That's enough. She already... can't fight anymore.<br>
Jean Bart：<br>
Move! Move!! I said, move!!<br>
Massachusetts：<br>
...<br>
Jean Bart：<br>
Why?! Why was my construction never finished?!<br>
Why was Richelieu the only one...?!<br>
Massachusetts：<br>
You never fired your second battery. Were you holding back on me?<br>
Jean Bart：<br>
...<br>
Richelieu, I heard that we're all going to be moved to another dock. Is that true?!<br>
Richelieu：<br>
Indeed. Due to... the situation changing on the battlefield. For the sake of safety...<br>
Jean Bart：<br>
Doesn't that mean that you're telling us to flee?! How do you expect us to do something so cowardly?<br>
Richelieu：<br>
Headquarters might have some long-term plans. For the time being, since you aren't able to move, we'll have to move you to somewhere safe.<br>
Jean Bart：<br>
Let me fight! With our combined strength, my one gun is enough to drive back these pagans from our lands!<br>
Richelieu：<br>
...<br>
Jean Bart：<br>
Don't tell me... you're with those other powers...<br>
Richelieu：<br>
The world is not such a simple place... Just do as you've been told. When your fitting is completed, seek me out again. I'll always be waiting for you.<br>
Jean Bart：<br>
...<br>
Fine. Mark my words though! One day, I will surpass you!<br>
Maybe... they never planned to finish building me in the first place.<br>
Perhaps the Crimson Axis thought that having yet another battleship would be like having a puppet. Perhaps that was what they were thinking all along.<br>
I had hoped that the power of the Sirens would allow me to assume a completed form, but in that end, that too was futile.<br>
Heh, how ironic. The country split apart because I was trying to protect it.<br>
I tried so hard to catch up to the person most dear to me that I ended up betraying her... How laughable...<br>
<br>
------- (Bzzzzzt...)<br>
Ranger：<br>
We've received an emergency communication from Headquarters!<br>
Massachusetts：<br>
"An Iron Blood Carrier Battle Group is quickly approaching from the north! Prepare for combat." Could they have picked a worse time...?<br>
Jean Bart：<br>
Don't worry. They're not coming for you.<br>
Our Templar Knights are scattered throughout various ports in the Méditerranée. Perhaps...<br>
<br>
------- (Bzzzzzt...)<br>
"Attention, all members of the Vichya fleet. This is an important message from Headquarters."<br>
"As of now, the Vichya Dominion has been dissolved. All former Vichya ships are to join the Azur Lane Alliance Fleet, effective immediately."<br>
"May you all be blessed by Father, Son, and the Holy Spirit."<br>
Massachusetts：<br>
...<br>
Jean Bart：<br>
Aha... ahahahahahahaha!!<br>
Renown：<br>
Lay down your arms, and come with us...<br>
Jean Bart：<br>
Silence, blasphemers! I will not allow a repeat of what happened to Dunkerque and others at Kébir.<br>
<br>
Ugh...! Jean Bart, flagship of the rightful Vichya Dominion, decrees to all ships in the Méditerranée...<br>
Casablanca has fallen! The pagans now bare their fangs at the heart of our motherland!<br>
The Iron Blood seeks to violate our lands, and the so-called Allies seek to drink our blood.<br>
Even the traitors at the Headquarters seek to sell out Vichya Dominion for cheap trinkets!<br>
While I draw breath, I will never permit this to pass!<br>
Remember what happened at Kébir! The Azur Lane already made their intentions clear to us with what they did to Dunkerque and the others.<br>
While I draw breath, I will never allow us to bow before such hypocrites!<br>
The Vichya Dominion is about to draw its last breath, surrounded by vultures ready to devour us. But what of it?<br>
The proud Templar Knights shall never bow their heads! So that we may never become puppets, I hereby order all of you to sink!<br>
All things mortal must come to an end, but there is no need for sorrow. This is the cycle of life, and we shall become one without lies or hypocrisy.<br>
Perhaps in a distant dawn, I shall wake up once more in a different form.<br>
Despite that, blessed be God's name. Thank you for granting me a life in service of this splendid country.<br>
Thank you for granting me a life of happiness.<br>
And thank you for welcoming me into the seas of Heaven.<br>
Blessed be the successors of the true Iris Orthodoxy.<br>
The Vichya Dominion represents the justice, passion, and love of the Iris Orthodoxy.<br>
May you all be blessed by Heavenly Father, Son, and Holy Spirit.<br>
Second flagship of the Vichya... no, of Iris... Jean Bart...<br>
Massachusetts：<br>
How could you do such a thing?<br>
Jean Bart：<br>
With this... I was able to honor the pact that we made with the Royal Navy in the past... to not be used by the Iron Blood, to not become a hue in the Crimson Axis...<br>
Renown：<br>
Jean Bart...<br>
Jean Bart：<br>
Honestly, I envy you. You have such a strong country, capable of producing such strong cannons and hulls...<br>
If I could also... be like that... one day...<br>
Massachusetts：<br>
I'll be looking forward to it.<br>
When the war is over, you'll surely be completed. We'll settle our score then.<br>
Jean Bart：<br>
Even a rotten Eagle like you can speak with some chivalry, eh...<br>
Massachusetts：<br>
Is that so? We call that talkin' like a cowboy.<br>
Jean Bart：<br>
(Unexpectedly... there's one more person who I want to overcome... We're surprisingly similar...)<br>
Sure. I'm also looking forward to that day... Until then... let me rest a while...<br>
Massachusetts：<br>
You've earned it. The Iris Orthodoxy, the Iron Blood, and now the Imperium of Sardegna...<br>
Now it's our turn to settle things.<br>
Richelieu：<br>
By the way, did you ever figure out what our names mean?<br>
Jean Bart：<br>
Huh?<br>
Richelieu：<br>
Yes, the name that we inherited from a warship. It represents the great expectations that humanity has for us.<br>
Jean Bart：<br>
...<br>
Richelieu：<br>
Remember, don't do anything that will tarnish your noble name...<br>

<br>
The tragedy of Casablanca and Touraine has passed... In order to carry out their beliefs, the Templar Knights chose to sacrifice themselves.<br>
Great were their sacrifices, and great was their freedom.<br>
In the face of an overwhelming Goliath, they said this: "You may come at us with spears and swords,"<br>
"But we are armed with the protection of the Lord."<br>
In a new era, the power of liberty has awakened.<br>
The just shall once again gather underneath a holy banner.<br>
The time to reclaim our glory has come once again.<br>
Upon this name that was bestowed upon me by the Cardinal, and upon this mantle that I now wear, I swear to protect the freedom in this world.<br>
In the name of the Heavenly Father, Son, and Holy Spirit<br>
Let us honor our comrades who sacrificed themselves so that we may be free.<br>
Forbin：<br>
We've detected a light fleet from the Imperium of Sardegna! Requesting orders from the flagship!<br>
Le Triomphant：<br>
This kind of work is perfect for us Le Fantasque-class destroyers. Just give me the order!<br>
Émile Bertin：<br>
The enemy has entered our range. Let's drop the hammer already!<br>
Jeanne：<br>
Haah... haah... Sorry for lagging behind, you're all so much faster than me...<br>
I, flagship of Iris Libre's Second Strike Force Fleet, Jeanne d'Arc, shall now assume command!<br>
In the name of liberty, all ships, commence attack!<br>
