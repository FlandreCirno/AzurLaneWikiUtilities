The Special Banquet<br>
<br>
Chapter 1: Preparations Done, Nya!<br>
Port - Kitchen<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">{{AF|Akashi}}：</span><br>
Uunya... I'm finally done with the preparations, nya! I was afraid I wasn't going to be able to make it to the banquet, nya!<br>
I'm wiped, nya... It's not easy setting up an event for everyone here at port, nya...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">{{AF|Shiranui}}：</span><br>
That should be obvious... Anyway, you should get down from there before you get your new clothes dirty.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">{{AF|Akashi}}：</span><br>
Don't wannya, I'm gonna sit here for a bit longer. It's clean over here, nya.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">{{AF|Hiei}}：</span><br>
I see that you two are working hard.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">{{AF|Akashi}}：</span><br>
Thanks for staffing the kitchen, Hiei. Tonight's ingredients should have all arrived by now, nya.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">{{AF|Hiei}}：</span><br>
Indeed. I appreciate it.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">{{AF|Akashi}}：</span><br>
But is it fine for you to not help out at the main banquet, nya? Hosting is your specialty, isn't it?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">{{AF|Hiei}}：</span><br>
A banquet's success isn't solely determined by its glitz or glamor. The hard work behind the scenes is far more important.<br>
For me, being able to put in this kind of work is the essence of being a good host.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">{{AF|Shiranui}}：</span><br>
You have a point... We're only able to have extravagant events like this because of everyone's hard work...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">{{AF|Akashi}}：</span><br>
The festival is so much fun, nya! I went to Lexington and Sara's concert, and also bought some new clothes, nya!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">{{AF|Shiranui}}：</span><br>
You're as energetic as ever... Well, I even entered that cooking contest. Heheh, it was more memorable than I first thought.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">{{AF|Akashi}}：</span><br>
Nuinui, you can cook, nya?!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">{{AF|Hiei}}：</span><br>
She was very close to advancing to the finals, but she lost to Matsukaze's home-style cooking in the semifinals...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">{{AF|Shiranui}}：</span><br>
Matsukaze's motherly meals were truly tremendous... I stood no chance...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">{{AF|Hiei}}：</span><br>
Hehe, I was one of the judges for the match. It was an amazing round.<br>
Nowhere else except in this fleet would you be able to see so many various cuisines placed together side-to-side.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">{{AF|Akashi}}：</span><br>
...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">{{AF|Shiranui}}：</span><br>
Before you ask, you're not mooching a free meal off of me.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">{{AF|Akashi}}：</span><br>
Why, nya?! What are friends for, nya?!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">{{AF|Shiranui}}：</span><br>
You cheapscat! Get your paws off me! Let go!<br>
Fine, fine, have it your way! Just this time, I'll bring you something.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">{{AF|Akashi}}：</span><br>
That's more like it, nya!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">{{AF|Hiei}}：</span><br>
Hehe~ I'm glad you two get along so well.<br>
But... Shiranui made an important point. We're only able to celebrate like this because of everyone's hard work.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">{{AF|Shiranui}}：</span><br>
That's right. Even now, there's still someone buried in work...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">{{AF|Hiei}}：</span><br>
Oh my. Shiranui, are you worried about Commander?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">{{AF|Shiranui}}：</span><br>
... As if. I just hope that Commander doesn't forget about the banquet due to having too much work.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">{{AF|Hiei}}：</span><br>
Hehe. I'm sure everyone knows just how hard Commander is working. We can all see the lights of the office glowing through the night.<br>
We just need to do our part so that everyone can have a good time at the banquet.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">{{AF|Akashi}}：</span><br>
That's right, nya~ I've had enough of a break, so I'm off to the banquet, nya!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">{{AF|Shiranui}}：</span><br>
I'm not a fan of crowded places, so I'll help out from here.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">{{AF|Hiei}}：</span><br>
Hehe~ Your help is much appreciated~<br>

The Special Banquet<br>
<br>
Chapter 2: A Little Chat Outside the Office<br>
Port - Outside the Office<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">{{AF|Yamashiro}}：</span><br>
Hum dee dum~ hum de dum~♪<br>
Heading to the banquet~ in some cute new clothes~ with Milord~♪<br>
Ehehe, I wonder if Milord will be surprised when seeing my new outfit~<br>
... But I never wear Western-style clothes... I hope I don't look weird...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">{{AF|Taihou}}：</span><br>
Oh my, if it isn't Yamashiro. I could hear your voice from far away.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">{{AF|Yamashiro}}：</span><br>
M-Miss Taihou! D-did you have business with Milord?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">{{AF|Taihou}}：</span><br>
Business...? Hardly. I'm just going to sneak into the office.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">{{AF|Yamashiro}}：</span><br>
S-sneak in? Why would you do something like that...?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">{{AF|Taihou}}：</span><br>
Because my beloved Commander is hard at work. It would be unbecoming of me to interrupt.<br>
In any case, that's why I'm out here. I'm just having a little something to drink while waiting for Commander to accompany me to the banquet.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">{{AF|Yamashiro}}：</span><br>
I see...<br>
But, um, Miss Taihou seems a bit different from usual today.<br>
Like, a lot more calm...?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">{{AF|Taihou}}：</span><br>
Are you saying that I'm not calm normally?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">{{AF|Yamashiro}}：</span><br>
I-I didn't mean it like that! It's just, how do I put it... Miss Taihou sometimes feels hard to approach... not as bad as Akagi, but... Eek!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">{{AF|Taihou}}：</span><br>
Heehee~♪ You don't need to be so nervous. I was just messing with you.<br>
Anyways... Tonight might be a bit special.<br>
I feel like I'm willing to overlook a lot more things than usual.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">{{AF|Yamashiro}}：</span><br>
I can't tell if I can totally relate to that or not at all...<br>
But what I do know is that Milord has been hard at work all this time. I want to be able to get Milord to relax...<br>
That's why I'd like to invite Milord to the banquet!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">{{AF|Taihou}}：</span><br>
Ahaha, I see now.<br>
... ...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">{{AF|Yamashiro}}：</span><br>
... ...... ...<br>
Oh, um, by the way... Miss Taihou, even though you just joined the fleet, you already have your dress... and it's so beautiful too...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">{{AF|Taihou}}：</span><br>
I've been planning for this moment for a long time, after all. That is, for Commander to take me to the banquet.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">{{AF|Yamashiro}}：</span><br>
Wow! I just wanted to play with Milord a bit. I never was good with the planning stuff...<br>
But, it'd be a shame to not go to the banquet after going through all that trouble to find a dress...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">{{AF|Taihou}}：</span><br>
The only thing that matters to me is Commander. Other things aren't of any concern to me.<br>
Or rather, that's what I thought at first... Honestly, this fleet... feels like home.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">{{AF|Yamashiro}}：</span><br>
Ehehe~ It's a home made by Milord, after all!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">{{AF|Taihou}}：</span><br>
Yamashiro, did you go to any events?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">{{AF|Yamashiro}}：</span><br>
Me? Um, I suppose I've been helping Fusou this whole time... Oh, and I went on a test of courage with some of the destroyers...<br>
That was so scary... I'm getting the shakes just thinking about it...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">{{AF|Taihou}}：</span><br>
Hehe, sounds like you had a good time. I'll have to join in myself the next time around.<br>
But by the looks of things, Commander won't be done for a while...<br>
Yamashiro, care for a drink?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">{{AF|Yamashiro}}：</span><br>
Um, sake?! Fusou said it'd be best for me not to drink... but I've always been a little curious!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">{{AF|Taihou}}：</span><br>
Hehe. This stuff isn't very strong, so you should be fine...<br>
Here, come sit next to me. Until Commander is finished with work, let's have some girl's talk.<br>

The Special Banquet<br>
<br>
Chapter 3: Cleveland Enters!<br>
Port - Outside the Gymnasium<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Cleveland：</span><br>
Ugh... Should I go in or not...<br>
I know that I caved and agreed to wear men's attire, but I'm not sure I have the heart to go in...<br>
Why the heck do I have to wear a suit anyway when everyone else is wearing a pretty dress...<br>
... But I have to admit, this is way more comfortable...<br>
No no, it's definitely weird that I'm the only one wearing a suit...<br>
…………<br>
But man, they really went all-out with this party... From the outside, you can't even tell that this place is a gymnasium anymore...<br>
…………<br>
Well, in any case, since I'm already here, it wouldn't make sense to turn around and change back...<br>
It's just a coincidence that I look good in men's attire. It's just a coincidence that I look good in men's attire. It's just a coincidence that I look good in men's attire.<br>
All right!<br>
One, two three!<br>
It's... magnificent!<br>
I knew it'd be a big deal, but this is beyond my wildest expectations...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Illustrious：</span><br>
Victorious, I'll entrust that to you~<br>
Oh my, Cleveland? You look just as dashing as everyone was saying~<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Cleveland：</span><br>
Ahaha... Your dress definitely lives up to your name, Illustrious.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">{{AF|Akashi}}：</span><br>
Good evening nya, Cleveland!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Unicorn：</span><br>
Good evening, Miss Cleveland.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Cleveland：</span><br>
Hello, you two!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Illustrious：</span><br>
Unicorn, Hiei asked me to make sure all the guests are taken care of, so I have to make a few more rounds. Will you be fine by yourself?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Unicorn：</span><br>
Mm... Unicorn will be a good girl and wait here for Big Brother...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Illustrious：</span><br>
Hehe... Unicorn, you're sticking to Commander as always.<br>
Anyway... Akashi, can I leave Unicorn with you?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">{{AF|Akashi}}：</span><br>
You betcha, nya!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Unicorn：</span><br>
Mm! Illustrious, Cleveland, bye-bye!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Cleveland：</span><br>
Huh? Isn't that Enterprise over there? She seems to be in a good mood, so that means Essex is probably here too.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Illustrious：</span><br>
That's true. Essex is an excellent mentee, after all, so she's been in high spirits for a while.<br>
Cleveland, are you enjoying the banquet so far?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Cleveland：</span><br>
Hmm... It's so glamorous that I feel out of place...<br>
But seeing so many friendly faces puts me at ease. I think I'll be fine.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Illustrious：</span><br>
Hehe~ I'm glad to hear that.<br>
For the time being, I need to continue making rounds, since the ball will begin when Commander gets here. You might have a pretty busy night ahead of you, Cleveland~<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Cleveland：</span><br>
Ahaha... Don't make fun of me like that. You know, I want to dance with Commander too...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Montpelier：</span><br>
Ah! Cleve! Over here!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Illustrious：</span><br>
Someone's calling for you. Anyway, I'll be taking my leave now.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Cleveland：</span><br>
Right. See you later.<br>

The Special Banquet<br>
<br>
Chapter 4: The Queen at the Banquet<br>
Port - Banquet Hall<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Illustrious：</span><br>
Your Majesty, what are you doing here?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Queen Elizabeth：</span><br>
Illustrious? Hmph. I am clearly overseeing this banquet here.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Illustrious：</span><br>
Hehe~ I wonder if Your Majesty finds this banquet to her liking.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Queen Elizabeth：</span><br>
Of course! From the design of the venue to the delicacies being served, every facet of this banquet was designed with Royal specifications.<br>
Even though I've become accustomed to this fleet's tastelessness and lack of true gourmet...<br>
I simply had to have an event like this to demonstrate to the commoners what true culture looks like.<br>
Ohohoho!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Illustrious：</span><br>
Nothing is more important than Your Majesty's enjoyment. All the guests are having a good time as well, so this banquet has been a resounding success so far.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Queen Elizabeth：</span><br>
Hmph. Of course!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Illustrious：</span><br>
Oh my, are Belfast and Sheffield not here this evening?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Queen Elizabeth：</span><br>
I sent those two to the kitchen. We have to make sure nothing falls short of perfection.<br>
Besides, this place is as safe as my very own bedroom. There's nothing to worry about!<br>
... What are you laughing at?!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Illustrious：</span><br>
Hehe~ It's nothing, Your Majesty. I simply had some pleasant thoughts.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Queen Elizabeth：</span><br>
Pleasant thoughts? I'd like to hear about them.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Illustrious：</span><br>
... There's nothing special about them. I was just thinking about how this banquet embodies everyone's happiness.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Queen Elizabeth：</span><br>
Hmph. You can't fool me, Illustrious! I bet you secretly entered in the swimsuit competition and took first place!<br>
You and your monsterous udders! Hmph! They're blocking my view of the banquet!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Illustrious：</span><br>
Eek! Y-Your Majesty?! Everyone can see us... Please don't squeeze them...<br>
And I swear, I didn't enter. As a matter of fact, I'm a bit insecure about stuff like that...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">{{AF|Mikasa}}：</span><br>
Well met, Elizabeth. Stop bullying your subordinates and come have a drink with me.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Queen Elizabeth：</span><br>
That's Your Majesty, Queen Elizabeth to you! How many times must I repeat myself! Also, this is education, not bullying!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">{{AF|Mikasa}}：</span><br>
Ahahaha! In that case... Would Your Majesty, Queen Elizabeth deign to partake of some libations with this lowly Mikasa?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Queen Elizabeth：</span><br>
Hmph... Good enough...<br>
Illustrious, you may leave now. Continue to carry out your duties.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Illustrious：</span><br>
Yes, Your Majesty.<br>
... I'm glad that Her Majesty has found something that she considers interesting.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">???：</span><br>
Would you look at that? Even a Queen like that still wants to make friends~<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Illustrious：</span><br>
... Ajax? You would do well to mind your tone when referring to Her Majesty.<br>
Even with her personality, she is still the Queen. There's nothing wrong with being a little selfish.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ajax：</span><br>
I can't tell if your heart is too big or you're just dense... Forget it, I'm content as long as I have my little piggy.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Illustrious：</span><br>
That's just like you, Ajax~<br>
Are you finding the banquet to your liking?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ajax：</span><br>
Even though the little piggy is currently buried in papers, I suppose I'm adequately entertained.<br>
That card game that Hermes is playing seemed pretty fun. Enough to kill some time, anyway.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Illustrious：</span><br>
Card game? Oh, that one called Yu-...<br>
Oh my... is someone playing the piano?<br>

The Special Banquet<br>
<br>
Chapter 5: The Pianist of the Banquet Hall<br>
Port - Banquet Hall<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">South Dakota：</span><br>
... I never expected to be doing something like this.<br>
Wearing a flowing dress, sitting at the piano, about to perform for so many people...<br>
The old me that knew only the sound of battle... would never have imagined a day like this...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Aurora：</span><br>
It's for the best, though, right?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">South Dakota：</span><br>
Aurora, is everything set up for the performance?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Aurora：</span><br>
Yes, sorry to keep you waiting.<br>
We still have some time left. Want to chat?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">South Dakota：</span><br>
That's fine by me. Let's continue where we left off.<br>
I don't regret the part of me that only knows battle. All the unnecessary weight of the world disappears in the heat of battle, after all.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Aurora：</span><br>
But, we weren't born just to fight...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">South Dakota：</span><br>
You're right. We have the freedom to choose our personalities and the things that we want to do.<br>
This is the most important lesson that I've learned since joining the fleet.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Aurora：</span><br>
It's not just you who has changed. We all meet a bunch of different people, exchange ideas, and become better as a result.<br>
I think you're much more approachable now than you were at first.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">South Dakota：</span><br>
... I'll take that as a compliment.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Aurora：</span><br>
Anyway, I was surprised when you decided to learn how to play the piano!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">South Dakota：</span><br>
It was Massachusetts's recommendation. At first, I thought that the elegance of the piano was a poor match for someone as stolid as me...<br>
But I soon realized... that music is able to express so many emotions that I'd never be able to with words.<br>
Joy, anger, sorrow, grief...<br>
For someone like me, who is not good at expressing emotions, music was actually the most suitable fit for me.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Aurora：</span><br>
After hearing all that, it sounds like you and the piano were an unexpected match made in heaven.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">South Dakota：</span><br>
Hard to say...<br>
But, let's move on from the piano... Um, this dress doesn't look weird on me, does it?<br>
It's too different from what I normally wear... I feel like I can't settle down at all...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Aurora：</span><br>
Hehehe... South Dakota, I don't think you're aware of your own charms yet~<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">South Dakota：</span><br>
... What?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Aurora：</span><br>
Don't worry about it. When Commander gets here, you can ask for yourself~<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">South Dakota：</span><br>
*sigh*...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Aurora：</span><br>
In any case, it's about time for your performance.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">South Dakota：</span><br>
That's right...<br>
South Dakota drew a deep breath...<br>
Now then... let's begin...<br>

<br>
The Special Banquet<br>
<br>
Chapter 6: Anniversary Orchestra<br>
Port - Banquet Hall<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Amazon：</span><br>
Phew. Looks like everyone's having a great time at the banquet, which means all the effort we've put in these last few days won't go to waste.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">{{AF|Fubuki}}：</span><br>
Everyone in the Royal Navy has been working so hard for this... I'm only helping out on the side, but it's been amazing to see everything come together.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Amazon：</span><br>
Well, we all want Her Majesty to have a good time. We wanted to throw the best banquet possible for everyone, so it wasn't really hard work at all~<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">{{AF|Fubuki}}：</span><br>
But Amazon, you don't look very happy yourself.<br>
Plus, when does our orchestra even get to play?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Amazon：</span><br>
Ack... So you've noticed...<br>
*sigh*...<br>
The reason is pretty simple. The most important person hasn't shown up yet, and we can't start playing until that person shows up.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">{{AF|Fubuki}}：</span><br>
Erm... Right, Commander still has yet to arrive...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Amazon：</span><br>
Good grief... Half of this banquet was prepared for that idiot who still hasn't shown up...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">{{AF|Fubuki}}：</span><br>
I see... That's unfortunate...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Amazon：</span><br>
I see... That's unfortunate...<br>
... Though that idiot is unreliable, this fleet has been running smoothly all this time. We might not say it, but I think everyone knows how much we all owe...<br>
Putting in so much work every day, managing all that paperwork, and still having time to spend with all of us...<br>
Without that idiot, we wouldn't even be able to have a celebration like this...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">{{AF|Fubuki}}：</span><br>
Amazon... you really care about Commander, don't you?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Amazon：</span><br>
... *Hmph*! As if. It's just some basic human courtesy I'd give to anyone.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">{{AF|Fubuki}}：</span><br>
(Well, she didn't deny it... Looks like Amazon is willing to open up as long as Commander isn't around~)<br>
So this orchestra was formed just for tonight?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Amazon：</span><br>
Incorrect! It's almost the other way around - you can't have a proper banquet without live music!<br>
In a sense, you could say that this banquet is a celebration of all of us.<br>
All the work we've put in up to this point is what allows us to proudly celebrate.<br>
But we can't forget that there is someone who is still working harder than any of us, even while we are enjoying ourselves.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">{{AF|Fubuki}}：</span><br>
So that's why you want Commander to take it easy and relax just for this evening?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Amazon：</span><br>
That's right. *sigh*... I hope that idiot didn't fall asleep in the office...<br>
We even made a promise... and I had a surprise prepared...<br>
If it takes any longer, I'm going to...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">{{AF|Fubuki}}：</span><br>
Ahh!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Amazon：</span><br>
Woah! What's the matter, Fubuki? You surprised me!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">{{AF|Fubuki}}：</span><br>
I just saw Commander! With Taihou and Yamashiro...<br>
Woah! Yamashiro's face is all flushed! She's wobbling like a top!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Amazon：</span><br>
Huhh? Well, they're heading this way, right?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">{{AF|Fubuki}}：</span><br>
Yes!<br>
