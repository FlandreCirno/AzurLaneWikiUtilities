Nyaaargh! Stop darting all over the place, nya!<br>
*Pant*... *pant*... Unya? Commander, you're back! Perfect timing, nya! Come help me catch these little buggers, nya!<br>
Commander, you saved my hide, nya...<br>
What are these things, nya? Hehe, I thought you'd ask that! These little guys are the results of countless hours of hard work and collaboration between Akashi and the Research Department!<br>
They're called "Meowfficers," nya!<br>
Allow me to introduce them to you!<br>

Meowfficers will accompany your ships into battle, providing various benefits to your fleet, nya!<br>
You'll understand once you see for yourself, nya! First, you'll have to use a Cat Box to train a Meowfficer, nya!<br>

These ordinary kitties normally require a bit of time before they can become qualifed Meowfficers, nya... But just this time, Akashi will carry out some special training, nya!<br>
We're all done, nya! Get ready to meet your first Meowfficer friend, nya!<br>

That's the gist of it, nya! Hm... our current production capacity is a bit limited, nya... Hold on, only the first Cat Box per day is free, nya. After that, there will be a charge, nya!<br>
Heh... hehe... After all, nya~ Akashi and the Meowfficers will be working hard for your sake~<br>
Anyways! If you want to get a lot more Meowfficers, Akashi welcomes your patronage at any time, nya!<br>
I'll send those Meowfficers to you in no time!<br>
In addition to increasing your fleet's power, Meowfficers also have different talents and abilities, but I'll let you discover those on your own, nya!<br>
You can add them to your fleet through "Formations," nya. Huh? What exactly are Meowfficers?<br>
Th-that's a trade secret, nya! You can just think of them as cuddly companions that are both cute and strong, nya!<br>
Anyway, Akashi is busy and has to head back to the store, nya!<br>
<br>
That sounds a bit fishy... but let's see what these Meowfficers are capable of...<br>
