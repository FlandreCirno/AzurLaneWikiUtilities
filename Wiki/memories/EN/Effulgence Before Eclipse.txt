<br>
Present Day – Somewhere in the Sakura Islands<br>
At the same time as the crisis at the World Expo, strange developments were occurring in the waters near the Sakura Islands.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Musashi：</span><br>
It's gotten rather chilly...<br>
If I didn't know better, you might be able to convince me that I'm somewhere in the Northern Parliament.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Nagato：</span><br>
Indeed. The warmth brought by the Sacred Sakura is fading.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Musashi：</span><br>
In other words, the Prime Sakura that lies beyond the boundary...<br>
<br>
The sacred trees of the Sakura Islands overflow with the power of their ancestral homeland, Mizuho. The most important of these, the Prime Sakura, has begun to wither.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Nagato：</span><br>
Your premonitions were correct. The sea is weeping.<br>
<br>
Nagato, the miko who oversees the rite of the Sacred Sakura, scooped up the frigid seawater between her hands.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Nagato：</span><br>
Now that I think about it, I have seen glimpses of this in a dream.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Musashi：</span><br>
Yes, I, too, have been touched by the portents of ruin.<br>
A nightmare in which the Sacred Sakura withers, the world is devoured by lightlessness, and everything comes to a silent end.<br>
And in none of those nightmares does the Great Sage appear to protect the Sacred Sakura.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Nagato：</span><br>
...Just like the time when I stepped down from my position as flagship of the Combined Fleet.<br>
......<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Musashi：</span><br>
Perhaps it would be wise to send a fleet to the Prime Sakura's sanctuary.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Nagato：</span><br>
Of course I plan to do so. But even in doing that, we can do little more than defend the physical territory around the tree.<br>
The innermost depths of the Prime Sakura are sealed off by a barrier that normal people cannot hope to even approach.<br>
<br>
Musashi and Nagato continued to sail, the seas and skies growing darker around them, the fog becoming denser.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Nagato：</span><br>
It has been an awfully long time since we last fought side by side, but I still remember it like it was yesterday.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Musashi：</span><br>
Nagato, the injury you sustained back then...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Nagato：</span><br>
...Has already healed. Though at times, it still continues to ache.<br>
Perhaps you could call it an illness of the heart.<br>
<br>
Three wakes continued into the distance.<br>
Before long, the voices of the wind and water disappeared, and the whole world was engulfed in silence.<br>
It was a strange, unsettling sensation, as if one's senses were being pulled from their body.<br>
An inscrutable amount of time passed, and then the discomfort faded.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Nagato：</span><br>
We've arrived... at the Prime Sakura's sanctuary.<br>
<br>
Cracks began to appear in the darkness, and through them, shimmering light burst forth.<br>
Despite the effulgence that seemed to burn at one's eyes, the light almost seemed to carry a certain warmth with it, far from any aura of hostility.<br>
After the visitors entered the sanctuary from the crack in reality, the path behind them quickly closed off.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Musashi：</span><br>
The Prime Sakura's sanctuary...<br>
<br>
In stark contrast to the lightless sea they had emerged from, what they now saw in front of them was the abundance of spring.<br>
Beneath a clear, blue sky, a majestic waterfall rumbled amidst countless cherry petals dancing in the gentle wind.<br>
The frigid mist choking the dark ocean had turned into rosy, wisp-like clouds that lingered at one's feet.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Nagato：</span><br>
The sanctuary's interior has hardly changed over the years, as if time has stood still...<br>
Back then, I came here with the Great Sage––<br>

<br>
Past – Prime Sakura Sanctuary<br>
There was a small lake at the foot of the Prime Sakura.<br>
By that lake, the shipgirl protector of this sanctuary, called the Great Sage by many, placed a hand on the tree with her companions.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Musashi：</span><br>
A soft, warm sensation touched their palms as they did.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Nagato：</span><br>
...But after a moment, that softness turned into pain like needles prickling their skin.<br>
<br>
Sensing a disturbance, the shipgirls pulled away all at once.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Musashi：</span><br>
What was that...?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">The Great Sage：</span><br>
I have a feeling I know the answer, Musashi.<br>
"Once upon a time, a star fell from the northern sky."<br>
"Darkness spread from the sea in which it fell. Frightened, the seas and skies of Mizuho shed tears."<br>
"Lamenting the tears of the Sakura Empire, the stars set themselves ablaze to create a blinding light that sealed the darkness into this sanctuary."<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Nagato：</span><br>
......<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Musashi：</span><br>
Great Sage, are you reciting a legend from the Watatsumi Chronicles?<br>
The text that details many of the stories surrounding our sacred relic...<br>
Why mention it now? Is it somehow related to the Prime Sakura's anomaly?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">The Great Sage：</span><br>
Most observant.<br>
During our journey here, you asked why I brought you to the Prime Sakura's sanctuary.<br>
While the Watatsumi Chronicles themselves are but stories and legends, their contents conceal a deeper truth.<br>
In this sanctuary – rather, within the Prime Sakura – lies a fragment of the very star that had fallen from the northern sky.<br>
The Prime Sakura's power sealed the shard away, containing the calamitous darkness...<br>
But impurity continues to seep out, gnawing away at the tree's power.<br>
If the rot is not expelled and the seal is not renewed, the calamitous darkness will one day return.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Musashi：</span><br>
What is this calamitous darkness of which you speak?<br>
...And do we have the power to deal with it in our current state?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Nagato：</span><br>
Indeed. We are drained from our decisive battle against the Sirens... Even if we were to fight, our power would be lacking.<br>
Besides, if this threat could be quashed through firepower alone, I assume you would have asked us much earlier.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">The Great Sage：</span><br>
It is as you say.<br>
The reason I have sought the two of you out is simple–<br>
Through a ritual, I wish to permanently annihilate this world-ending calamity.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Nagato：</span><br>
Annihilate?<br>
Are your rituals able to do that?<br>
<br>
Instead of answering directly, the shipgirl known as the Great Sage nodded solemnly and began chanting the words of the ritual.<br>
The Prime Sakura began to resonate, threads of light rising from its roots towards the sky like cherry blossoms in the wind, weaving back and forth until they formed a complex structure – that of a gate.<br>
This was the Sakuran ritual of forming a barrier domain.<br>
Once the barrier had been fully formed, the colors surrounding them seemed to be absorbed into the domain itself.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">The Great Sage：</span><br>
There. The preparations are complete.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Nagato：</span><br>
What incredible skill. No wonder you're the protector of this sanctuary...<br>
I couldn't have hoped to understand during my studies, but it is astounding to see the intricacies of this ritual up close.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">The Great Sage：</span><br>
Your praise honors me, but understand that the road ahead will still be dangerous.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Musashi：</span><br>
That is why I am here. Explain your intentions while you guide us onward.<br>
<br>
Musashi materialized her sword, which crackled with electricity.<br>
She then drew it from the scabbard and gripped its hilt tightly, reaffirming her determination to fight.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">The Great Sage：</span><br>
...I see your resolve.<br>
Then I shall guide you to the star fragment – to Watatsumi.<br>
Guardian Fox, I will have you enter the seal and confront Watatsumi.<br>
Impurity has accumulated in the sacred tree along the way, but this barrier's power will protect us.<br>
However, once you enter the seal, the darkness that has become Watatsumi's shadow will lash out at you.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Musashi：</span><br>
I will protect Lady Nagato. Continue.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">The Great Sage：</span><br>
...Thank you, Musashi.<br>
Nagato, as the Sakura Empire's Guardian Fox, you are the only one who can resonate with Watatsumi.<br>
Regardless of how strong the seal is, the powers vested within you will grant you safe passage.<br>
But know that you, alone, can accomplish this.<br>
For a short time, you should be able to wield Watatsumi's remaining power.<br>
We must push back the darkness and form a new seal that does not draw its power from the very same source of corruption.<br>
...Yes, I will become the foundation for the new seal.<br>
Musashi, you must protect Lady Nagato until the ritual is complete.<br>
Once the mist has been vanquished, there will no longer be a need for a seal.<br>
And I will leave the star fragment, the remnants of Watatsumi, in your care.<br>
It will be but a shell, exhausted of its power, but it should still be enough to help you change this nation's future.<br>
Lady Nagato, Musashi... Please protect the future of the Sakura Empire.<br>
And finally...<br>
Musashi, I will fulfill my agreement with you.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Unzen：</span><br>
The Great Sage retrieved a small box from within her sleeve and handed it to Musashi.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">The Great Sage：</span><br>
May this assist you in repairing the "roots" that make up our physical forms.<br>
<br>
A heavy air hung over the group as they steeled their resolve.<br>
There might have been a thousand words the three wished to exchange, but not a single one was to be heard.<br>
{{折叠面板|内容结束}}

{{折叠面板|标题=Dark Void|选项=3|主框=1|样式=primary|展开=是}}
<br>
When the Great Sage began the ritual, the scenery before them changed.<br>
The magnificent Prime Sakura abruptly began to wither, the flowers and leaves upon its intricate branches falling as if all life had been drained from it.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">The Great Sage：</span><br>
Lady Nagato, now! Go into the seal!<br>
<br>
Before the impure darkness could overwhelm them, they stepped into the Prime Sakura.<br>
The earth shattered, and a black haze spewed forth like a geyser.<br>
Chunks of ground that had been thrown into the air continued to float, as if gravity no longer had any effect.<br>
They were now in the Prime Sakura, where the Watatsumi star fragment lay.<br>
Light shone from what seemed to be the tree's roots.<br>
The deeply-embedded roots were yanked out of the ground before rising up into the air with the rest of the massive tree.<br>
Lumps of earth looked like shining pink crystals as they reflected the dazzling light around them.<br>
Despite knowing that not everything they saw was necessarily reality, the group was overwhelmed by the sight of the inner seal.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Musashi：</span><br>
Such power...<br>
Is this Watatsumi...? No, the core of that crystal—<br>
Huh?! Lady Nagato!<br>
Sensing danger, Musashi rushed over to Nagato's side with sword in hand.<br>
Even as the devouring darkness threatened to swallow the two of them whole, Nagato focused herself entirely on communing with Watatsumi.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Nagato：</span><br>
She closed her eyes tight, focusing every fiber of her being into feeling the star fragment's lingering power.<br>
She reached for the light in the distant darkness, like navigating towards a lighthouse on a dark stormy night, like grasping for a tree's roots when caught in a flood.<br>
Then, finally...<br>
Shard of the fallen star! Shine your light upon my path forth!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Musashi：</span><br>
Lady Nagato!<br>
With a violet spark, the dark mist reaching out to seize the girl from behind was snuffed out.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Nagato：</span><br>
That was too close... Thank you, Musashi.<br>
I've made contact with Watatsumi. Now, we can proceed to the center of the seal.<br>
<br>
As a result of the ritual, the void around the shipgirls changed. Now, an invisible sea spread out beneath their feet.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Nagato：</span><br>
This will make movement and fighting easier. I'll lead the way now.<br>
Musashi, stay on guard. Something is eroding the seal, trying to break through.<br>
<br>
Countless rays of light slowly extended from Watatsumi in the center of the darkness, drawing some kind of pattern.<br>
An enormous gate, symbolizing the sealing ritual itself, had appeared before them.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Nagato：</span><br>
I'm going into the center now... Huh?!<br>
Main cannons, prepare for salvo!<br>
<br>
Nagato fired her cannons, crushing the approaching black mist. However, she did not erase it entirely.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Musashi：</span><br>
Right rudder, sharp turn!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Nagato：</span><br>
Huh?!<br>
<br>
The dark haze took the form of a giant beast, opening its maw to attack.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Musashi：</span><br>
Urgh...!!<br>
Musashi immediately materialized her rigging and used her turret's plating to stop the beast's bite.<br>
Hold it back!<br>
<br>
Musashi's main guns fired shells that exploded in mid-air, sending pellets forth in a fan shape that tore through the beast of black mist.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Musashi：</span><br>
Lady Nagato!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Nagato：</span><br>
I know! Type 3 shells...<br>
Main cannons, prepare for salvo!<br>
<br>
Another thick hail of shells struck the beast, causing its physical form to disperse back into the darkness.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Nagato：</span><br>
Look out, Musashi! It's a trap!<br>
<br>
The dispersed darkness tore into Musashi's armor like a giant maw, a shower of sparks erupting as a portion of her rigging was torn straight off.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Musashi：</span><br>
Nngh...<br>
So you created just a maw instead of an entire body that we can shoot at, huh?<br>
Not bad... Looks like even monsters are capable of learning...<br>
But I won't let you interrupt Lady Nagato!<br>
If cannons won't work... How about facing my lightning?<br>
<br>
–––KRRZZSHHH!!<br>
Faster than the eye could react, Musashi's sword had already found its way through the dark mist.<br>
Where lightning flash met darkness, the mist seemed to melt away into nothingness.<br>
It sputtered and sizzled with a hoarse screech, like droplets of water sublimating on a hot iron plate.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Musashi：</span><br>
I thought we had been cut off, Great Sage, but I see you're still protecting us.<br>
The mist is weaker here now. Lady Nagato, let's move on!<br>
Musashi shed the rest of her rigging and rushed forward with her blade drawn.<br>
Then, she looked to the black mist blocking the way forward and readied her sword.<br>
Thunderbolt that shines through eternal night, gather upon my blade.<br>
With this strike, I carve a way forward!<br>
<br>
Lightning shot from Musashi's katana, brushing aside the darkness and clearing the way in front of them.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Musashi：</span><br>
It won't hold for long! We must press on!<br>

<br>
They reached the center of the seal and attempted to perform the ritual. However...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Nagato：</span><br>
The barrier's defenses still resist the erosion...<br>
We must continue to protect Watatsumi until the Great Sage's ritual is complete.<br>
If Watatsumi is destroyed first, the seal itself will break.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Musashi：</span><br>
Indeed. However, it seems easier said than done...<br>
<br>
Musashi looked upward, beyond the withered Prime Sakura's trunk.<br>
At the canopy, the giant eyes of the black mist beast glowered down at the shipgirls.<br>
That ominous being was none other than the shadow of calamity.<br>
And when she looked further up, toward the sky...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Musashi：</span><br>
A shooting star? No, is that the Great Sage...?<br>
"Once upon a time, a star fell from the northern sky." So this is what the legend meant...<br>
She's merged with the concept of Watatsumi and reinforced it. Now, she's trying to eradicate the darkness herself...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Nagato：</span><br>
Musashi, that legend said that the stars set themselves ablaze!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Musashi：</span><br>
Does she mean to burn out her own life—<br>
<br>
Cutting off Musashi's words, the star falling from the sky struck the Prime Sakura.<br>
The light emitted from Watatsumi was as brilliant as a jewel.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Nagato：</span><br>
...Am I hallucinating?<br>
<br>
What remained was a fragment of memory.<br>
A sea of clouds. From the dark clouds emerged an eldritch beast, devouring all in its path.<br>
The Prime Sakura was wreathed in flames.<br>
The black mist, now in the form of a shadowy leviathan, was tearing at its trunk with its fangs.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Distorted Noise：</span><br>
(RUN...! RUN, NOW...!)<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Musashi：</span><br>
Is this... one of our cities...?!<br>
Lady Nagato, look!<br>
<br>
Amidst the raging windstorm, the dark mist eroded the boundary between land and sky.<br>
Beneath a blood-red moon, ordinary citizens scrambled for safety from the conflagration roaring around them.<br>
From the highest point in the city, the roof of the castle tower, a woman clad in white stepped forth.<br>
She looked down across the surging, roiling mist, a deep sorrow etched upon her face.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Nagato：</span><br>
The Great Sage...<br>
<br>
Before Nagato could call out to her, the Great Sage leapt from the tower and became a flash of light that pierced the mist.<br>
What formed was a mirage of memories.<br>
The mirage changed again, this time into the scene of spring they had witnessed before entering the sanctuary.<br>
Blue skies above, a gentle breeze caressing their cheeks.<br>
Atop a tall hill in this peaceful world, the woman in white awaited Nagato and Musashi.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Nagato：</span><br>
Great Sage...<br>
What was that vision? Are you... okay?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">The Great Sage：</span><br>
Guardian Fox. Musashi.<br>
You two had the same dream, as I recall.<br>
Some say that dreams are an extension of reality, while others call them a reflection of your mind.<br>
Unlike you, however, I dream of potential futures.<br>
To be honest, I've dreamed of that same future of destruction countless times.<br>
Tens... No, hundreds of times, even.<br>
I was able to act of my own will, so I investigated various things throughout the dreams.<br>
That beast of black mist that withers the Prime Sakura and brings calamity to the Sakura Empire...<br>
I call it the Shadow of Corruption.<br>
While Watatsumi, that which fell from the heavens, gives us the wisdom and power to expel evil...<br>
The Shadow of Corruption, too, will inevitably become the calamitous darkness.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Musashi：</span><br>
...Did Watatsumi and the black mist come at the same time?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">The Great Sage：</span><br>
Yes. Like two sides of a coin, like light and shadow.<br>
Wherever there is light, there is also darkness. Normally, they maintain balance instead of leading to ruin, but...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Musashi：</span><br>
But due to this anomaly, you've witnessed our future.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">The Great Sage：</span><br>
The more Watatsumi's power is used, the stronger the darkness's influence becomes.<br>
No, even if Watatsumi's power isn't used, as Wisdom Cubes grow stronger...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Musashi：</span><br>
I... don't understand what you're saying.<br>
Are you saying that Watatsumi and Wisdom Cubes are one and the same?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">The Great Sage：</span><br>
To be more precise, they're similar but different. As time passes and branches shift, our names for them change as well.<br>
Regardless of the name you call them by, they tap into the same wellspring of power that gives form to our hulls... In other words, a conduit to a root source.<br>
Humans may wield this power and manifest it in different ways, but this primordial wellspring is far beyond their ability to control.<br>
Nevertheless, if we do not define it in terms of human cognition, we would have no way of understanding its scale on a cosmic level.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Musashi：</span><br>
What do you mean to say...?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">The Great Sage：</span><br>
A miraculous entity born of countless wishes, interwoven with the laws and truths of countless worlds.<br>
That is Watatsumi. That is me.<br>
<br>
"Once upon a time, a star fell from the northern sky."<br>
"Darkness spread from the sea in which it fell. The stars set themselves ablaze to create a blinding light that sealed the darkness into this sanctuary."<br>
KABOOOOOOM!<br>
Thus, Watatsumi struck the Sakura Empire. Its enormous power radiated from the point of impact.<br>
Amidst scorching light, pink crystals emerged from the shattered earth and accelerated upward into the sky.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Nagato：</span><br>
This is...the Prime Sakura...<br>
The sanctuary that seals the dark mist...<br>
<br>
The vision faded, and Nagato and Musashi saw the current spectacle within the sanctuary once more.<br>
The Shadow of Corruption, created by the Reenactments and given form by the black mist, seemed to writhe in agony.<br>
The ominous black fog closed in from all directions.<br>
Musashi tried to cut it away with her purple lightning blade, but the severed darkness only reformed again to attack.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Nagato：</span><br>
Bear witness! Haaaah!<br>
<br>
Materializing her mental imagery, Nagato's prayer became a guiding light that drove off the darkness.<br>
However, it was weak, and it only managed to slow the darkness's encroachment temporarily.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Nagato：</span><br>
No...!<br>
<br>
......<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Nagato：</span><br>
We only have one choice now.<br>
Musashi, I'll entrust the last of the Guardian Fox's power to your blade. Strike true, and cut a way out of this situation!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Musashi：</span><br>
...You mustn't.<br>
Even if I were to escape, you...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Nagato：</span><br>
It is my duty as a miko to protect the Sakura Empire.<br>
I vowed to do so, and I showed you my resolve during our game.<br>
Bear witness... to the Guardian Fox's power!<br>
<br>
The young woman forcibly pushed the sheathed sword into Musashi's arms.<br>
In the next instant, the blackness engulfed Nagato.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Musashi：</span><br>
Lady Nagato...!<br>
<br>
Pure nothingness—a world devoid of sound or light, home only to endless darkness.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Owari：</span><br>
Nngh... What was all that...?<br>
<br>
In the distant future, one girl would witness these events in a vision.<br>

<br>
Past – Nagato's Abode<br>
Before the Great Sage would become the foundation of the new seal in the Prime Sakura's sanctuary...<br>
In a room for treating guests, Kawakaze, a disciple of the Guardian Fox, placed white cups of fresh tea in front of a guest.<br>
Though her etiquette was rather simple, the refreshing aroma of the fresh tea was proof that the host would never neglect their guests.<br>
After repeating this process several times, Kawakaze bowed, opened the sliding door, and gracefully exited the room.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Musashi：</span><br>
Great Sage, I'd like to talk about the withering of the Prime Sakura you informed us of.<br>
I've looked into it, and I've received one other report of a Sacred Sakura withering...<br>
Are these two situations related?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">The Great Sage：</span><br>
I have to apologize. There's something I haven't disclosed to you two.<br>
The roots of every Sacred Sakura in this empire are all connected to the Prime Sakura.<br>
If the roots are severed by the erosion, even these hallowed trees will not be able to recover.<br>
They will be cut off from nutrients, and eventually wither.<br>
As for the report you received, its cause can be traced back to the Prime Sakura itself.<br>
<br>
A breeze blew through the window, bringing in some flower petals.<br>
One of them happened to fall right into the Great Sage's teacup.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">The Great Sage：</span><br>
Even this one petal of the Sacred Sakura...<br>
...Shows that the erosion is spreading throughout all the nation.<br>
If left alone, the Prime Sakura and all of its children will wither.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Nagato：</span><br>
Hmm... If that is true, then we have to resolve this as soon as possible.<br>
Great Sage, can we presume that the source of the erosion is somewhere within the Prime Sakura?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">The Great Sage：</span><br>
I suppose you could say that it is "somewhere" inside of it, yes...<br>
<br>
The Great Sage said, evasively, before continuing to speak.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">The Great Sage：</span><br>
More precisely, the Prime Sakura itself is the source.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Nagato：</span><br>
What...?!<br>
<br>
Nagato was surprised, but the Great Sage offered no further explanation. She simply stared at the petal floating in her teacup.<br>
*knock* *knock*<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Nagato：</span><br>
Kawakaze?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Kawakaze：</span><br>
Lady Nagato, the dinner party is ready. Everyone is waiting for you.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Nagato：</span><br>
...I'm sorry to cut the conversation short, but I have important guests to entertain over the coming days.<br>
I understand you're a wanderer, but would you please stay here until I'm done? We can plan to deal with the Sacred Sakura problem then.<br>
<br>
After the Guardian Fox's request, the Great Sage closed her eyes in quiet thought for two, three seconds.<br>
The sound of wind chimes traveled through the window and into the spacious room.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">The Great Sage：</span><br>
...I would like to take you up on that offer, Guardian Fox.<br>
<br>
Nagato's expression softened slightly. That was exactly what she wanted to hear.<br>
After drinking down the tea given to her, she stood up and followed her aide.<br>
Once the little girl's footsteps had faded into the distance...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">The Great Sage：</span><br>
Musashi, I'd like to ask you one more thing.<br>
How is Shinano doing?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Musashi：</span><br>
...I see there's no point trying to hide anything from you.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">The Great Sage：</span><br>
Sorry to trouble you. But... Could you let me meet her?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Musashi：</span><br>
If that is your request, then I won't decline.<br>
But it's too late today. Let us plan for another... No, I'm sure tomorrow will do just fine.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">The Great Sage：</span><br>
Thank you. Tomorrow is perfect.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Musashi：</span><br>
Now, I have other business to attend to, as well. Spend your time as you please.<br>
<br>
Finally, the Great Sage was left alone in the room.<br>
She had no plans for some time, so she decided to enjoy the rest of her tea as she admired the courtyard.<br>
It was already evening. Golden light reflected on the lake water.<br>
Perhaps she ought to pay a visit to the dinner party.<br>

<br>
Past – Musashi's Abode<br>
The next day, on Musashi's invitation, the Great Sage visited Shinano's room.<br>
When she listened carefully, she heard faint breathing behind the screen door.<br>
She carefully opened the door, trying not to make a sound, and glanced inside before closing it again.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">The Great Sage：</span><br>
.........<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Musashi：</span><br>
Could Shinano be related to the Sacred Sakura's withering?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">The Great Sage：</span><br>
No, I believe it's due to the influence of our roots – our hulls.<br>
That isn't something particular to Shinano, but at the same time, it isn't exactly easy to solve.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Musashi：</span><br>
Does this mean... Amagi too...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">The Great Sage：</span><br>
Yes, but...<br>
There may be no way to reverse an injury of that extent.<br>
<br>
The Great Sage went into the hallway, put a hand on the fence, and finally looked back to Musashi.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">The Great Sage：</span><br>
The Prime Sakura's sanctuary.<br>
Please pay me a visit there. Bring Lady Nagato, if you'd please.<br>
We may be able to talk now, but my real body cannot leave that sanctuary.<br>
If possible, I'd like to talk about the most important matters there.<br>
Come to its trunk, and I shall tell you everything.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Musashi：</span><br>
Great Sage, I understand your wishes...<br>
But leaving me aside, why Lady Nagato... Why did you choose us?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">The Great Sage：</span><br>
As the inheritor of the Guardian Fox, Lady Nagato has a power that nobody else has.<br>
As for you, Musashi, I would simply be more at ease if you protected her.<br>
She is the miko who protects the Sacred Sakura, and you...<br>
(I hope you... will protect Mizuho's seas and skies once I'm gone.)<br>

<br>
Present Day – Prime Sakura Sanctuary<br>
In a corner of the Prime Sakura's sanctuary, shipgirls on guard duty were enjoying their work.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Zuihou：</span><br>
Where did Hatsuzuki go off to?<br>
<br>
One bored little girl glanced occasionally at the Prime Sakura from the guardroom she was cleaning.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Asanagi：</span><br>
She claimed she went off in search of Owari, but I assume she's simply bored.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Zuihou：</span><br>
Really? She looked kinda pale when she left...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Asanagi：</span><br>
Pale? Hahaha!<br>
Why, anyone would look pale if they were plagued all throughout the night by nightmares!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Zuihou：</span><br>
Hmph... She could've talked to us about it.<br>
This is the first time she's just up and disappeared.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Asanagi：</span><br>
You worry too much, Zuihou.<br>
Nothing will actually happen in this boring little outpost.<br>
Think about it. This is the Prime Sakura's sanctuary, a sacred place in our empire.<br>
Taboo aside, this place is protected by the Guardian Fox's barrier.<br>
Why, you could go out and play all alone, and nothing bad would happen to you.<br>
And really, I think it's for the best that nothing happens.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Zuihou：</span><br>
Shh!<br>
Geez, Asanagi! You can't let Owari hear that!<br>
She doesn't say it, but she takes this job REALLY seriously!<br>
"It's like, nature, y'know? Nobody as far as the eye can see, it's all just grass and little animals!"<br>
"Kinda like we're livin' in the sticks!"<br>
"For me, you can't get much more nostalgic than that!"<br>
That's what she said! Not that it made a lot of sense to me...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Asanagi：</span><br>
Oh ho. So that's how it is...<br>
Regardless, that doesn't mean she cares about the mission. She just enjoys being in this environment!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Zuihou：</span><br>
E-either way!<br>
As protectors of the sanctuary, we have to do our job!<br>
That means you, too, Asanagi! If you're bored, then let's go search for Owari and Hatsuzuki!<br>
If anything happens, our homeland Mizuho...<br>
<br>
Just then, they heard a girl calling out from outside the guardroom.<br>
The girl, clad in red and black, jumped out from the horizon and rushed toward the courtyard.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Zuihou：</span><br>
What was that sound?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Asanagi：</span><br>
Look! There's Hatsuzuki!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Zuihou：</span><br>
She's in a real hurry. Is someone chasing her?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Hatsuzuki：</span><br>
*BEEP BEEP BEEP*<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Zuihou：</span><br>
The communicator's beeping!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Hatsuzuki：</span><br>
Zuihou snatched up the communicator and listened in close with Asanagi.<br>
*rustle* *rustle*<br>
H-hurry and get ready...!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Zuihou：</span><br>
Hatsuzuki's breathing was ragged, and her voice faltered.<br>
Don't panic! Calm down!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Hatsuzuki：</span><br>
I-it's too late...<br>
Zuihou, Asanagi! Are you still listening?!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Asanagi：</span><br>
Taken aback by Hatsuzuki's ferocious speed, they failed to notice her shouting through the communicator.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Hatsuzuki：</span><br>
Despite the fact that she was moving with her rigging, she looked like she was dashing as fast as she could.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Zuihou：</span><br>
Hatsuzuki's really going fast...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Asanagi：</span><br>
I'm amazed that she can run so fast with her rigging on...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Zuihou：</span><br>
Maybe I should try... Whoa! Now isn't the time to think about that!<br>
Hatsuzuki, are you okay?! What's too late?!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Hatsuzuki：</span><br>
When she finally reached the beach outside of the guardroom, Hatsuzuki hit the brakes and drifted up the shore from inertia.<br>
*pant*... *gasp*... *WHEEZE*...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Zuihou：</span><br>
While Hatsuzuki panted and gasped for air, Zuihou ran over with broom in hand—<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Hatsuzuki：</span><br>
...But Hatsuzuki held out her hand, gesturing that she was fine and prompting Zuihou to stop.<br>
It's too late now.<br>
After some deep breaths, she returned to normal and said with a sad look on her face.<br>
It's just too late!<br>
Lady Nagato, Musashi, and someone else...<br>
They're here in the Prime Sakura sanctuary!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Asanagi：</span><br>
Lady Nagato and Musashi? ...Hmph. That isn't a very funny joke.<br>
They would never come here out of nowhere.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Zuihou：</span><br>
Whoa, whoa! I-I gotta hurry up and finish sweeping the courtyard!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Hatsuzuki：</span><br>
Hey, I'm not joking. I saw them with my own eyes!<br>
While I was looking for Owari, I suddenly saw them sailing, too.<br>
I'd never mistake the figure of the Sakura Empire's Guardian Fox!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Asanagi：</span><br>
...Y-you mean you were serious?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Hatsuzuki：</span><br>
I've BEEN serious this whole time! Maybe I'd be happier if I was mistaken, but...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Zuihou：</span><br>
Oh, no, no! Wh-what do we do?!<br>
I'll send my carrier-based aircraft to search for Lady Nagato now...<br>
Hatsuzuki, go in and rest! Asanagi, wake up Natori, and... And make her clean her room!<br>
We need to make tea, too... If we hurry, we might make it in time!<br>
B-but if I start getting ready now, what if I'm so focused when they get here that—<br>
Argh! Why are you all just standing around doing nothing?!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Asanagi：</span><br>
Right! I'll get going right away!<br>
<br>
The once-peaceful outpost was livened up by the presence of uninvited guests.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Zuihou：</span><br>
(I-is this related to Owari? What in the world is going on...?)<br>
{{折叠面板|内容结束}}

{{折叠面板|标题=At the Outpost|选项=8|主框=1|样式=primary|展开=是}}
<br>
In an empty plot of land in the outpost, Asanagi took a broom in hand – a rare sight to see.<br>
She began sweeping the ground haphazardly and hurriedly, but sweeping it all the same.<br>
It was pure curiosity that was driving her to do this. She wanted to know what was happening inside the house.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Asanagi：</span><br>
Psst! Hatsuzuki!<br>
<br>
With a hushed voice, she approached the building and addressed Hatsuzuki, standing in the passageway.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Asanagi：</span><br>
Three there were, you said. Where is the third? I've seen only Lady Nagato and Musashi.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Hatsuzuki：</span><br>
I don't know where she is. It's always possible I was wrong...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Asanagi：</span><br>
No matter. Do you know why the two of them are here?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Hatsuzuki：</span><br>
You know what I know? That it's rude to eavesdrop!<br>
<br>
Asanagi put down her broom and tried to enter, but Hatsuzuki hurriedly stopped her. At the same time, somebody emerged from a room opposite them.<br>
It was Zuihou. Tray in hand, she nimbly turned around and gave a quick bow.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Zuihou：</span><br>
If you need anything, just let me know!<br>
<br>
Then, she stepped aside and slid the paper sliding door shut.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Zuihou：</span><br>
Phew...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Asanagi：</span><br>
Zuihou! Come here!<br>
Tell me – what is happening in there? What are those two discussing?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Hatsuzuki：</span><br>
Take it easy! Give her a moment to compose herself.<br>
<br>
Zuihou was shaking like a leaf. She dropped the tray off in the storeroom before Asanagi hauled her off into another room.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Zuihou：</span><br>
Gosh... That was nerve-racking...<br>
I've never spoken face-to-face with Lady Nagato or Musashi before.<br>
I wasn't the least prepared for it either, and I nearly spilled their tea on the floor...<br>
Thank goodness nothing happened.<br>
When I nearly spilled the tea, Lady Nagato had this dead-serious look on her face, but at least Musashi shot me a comforting look.<br>
It was nearly a disaster...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Asanagi：</span><br>
Yes, yes. Did they speak of anything relating to Owari?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Zuihou：</span><br>
Huh? Uh, Lady Nagato said something about "going to the Prime Sakura."<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Asanagi：</span><br>
Are you certain of that? THE Prime Sakura?<br>
<br>
Asanagi gestured with a finger towards the giant Sacred Sakura at the sanctuary's center.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Zuihou：</span><br>
Yup.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Asanagi：</span><br>
That's where she is? Then it's no wonder Hatsuzuki could not find her.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Hatsuzuki：</span><br>
Why do that, though? Why would she go to the tree?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Zuihou：</span><br>
Oh! Shoot! I forgot to report that Owari has gone missing!<br>
Now I've really messed up... What if Lady Nagato or Musashi get hurt because of it?<br>
<br>
While Asanagi and Hatsuzuki held their heads in their hands and Zuihou lost her composure, another person cut into the conversation.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Musashi：</span><br>
No harm done. Moreover, we learned that Owari is safe just moments ago.<br>
Our companion will show her back to the outpost shortly.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Hatsuzuki：</span><br>
M-Musashi?! Um, I...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Musashi：</span><br>
No need to be so stiff. It's alright. Also, Lady Nagato has a special mission for you three.<br>
You are to gather some materials we will need for a ritual.<br>
Musashi produced a slip of paper from her sleeve to give to the outpost girls.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Zuihou：</span><br>
The three, however, stood motionless, paralyzed by Musashi's sudden appearance.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Musashi：</span><br>
Hatsuzuki?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Hatsuzuki：</span><br>
Y-Yes, ma'am?!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Musashi：</span><br>
So it was you I saw earlier.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Hatsuzuki：</span><br>
S-sorry for not introducing myself earlier! None of us were expecting you, and the chance to say hello passed us by...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Natori：</span><br>
"It happens," said a voice belonging to none of the girls. It came from just behind Musashi.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Asanagi：</span><br>
If it isn't Hiranuma... Or rather, Natori.<br>
Pardon me. I was supposed to wake you, but carelessly forgot about it when Lady Nagato and Musashi turned up.<br>
I ask you for forgiveness as well, Musashi!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Musashi：</span><br>
It's fine. You have nothing to apologize for.<br>
Musashi turned on her heel and directed Natori toward the rest of the girls.<br>
Zuihou, I trust you to find the materials.<br>
There's still time before the ritual. Until then, let's discuss the outpost and the sanctuary, shall we?<br>

<br>
After wading through the darkness for who knows how long, a ray of light finally shone through to Owari.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Owari：</span><br>
Mmgghh...<br>
<br>
Her head was heavy. She had been subjected to far too many apparitions, or possibly visions of the past.<br>
She ran her hand along her nape and felt the back of her head. No signs of injury.<br>
Strangely, though, it felt as though her feet weren't touching the ground.<br>
It didn't feel like she was standing, but rather lying down – suspended in the air like with strings, something gripping her waist.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Owari：</span><br>
The heck is this... The wind? Did a hawk capture me or somethin'?<br>
Can't even open my eyes. Dammit...<br>
Startin' to think this is some kinda sleep paralysis... Or a nightmare...<br>
What was I doing before this? I can't remember...<br>
<br>
Her memories were a jarbled mess. It was a struggle to remember much of anything.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Owari：</span><br>
Oh, right!<br>
I remember seeing Lady Nagato and Musashi over by the Prime Sakura!<br>
And they were, like, fighting something? Wait, nah, that's not right...<br>
That ain't one of my memories, it's an event the Prime Sakura recorded waaay back.<br>
Why would it show me that, though? Something, something, "come to the tree"... Sounds creepy.<br>
<br>
A headache came over her and she was forced to stop thinking.<br>
Some time passed, and eventually, the feeling of being suspended wore off. She could feel the sanctuary's soil beneath her feet again.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Owari：</span><br>
...Am I back on the ground again?<br>
<br>
This time when she opened her eyes, her vision had returned to her.<br>
Flowing rivers, lush fields of grass, and the Prime Sakura's great pink canopy all laid before her.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Owari：</span><br>
Guess I'm back? Some weird-ass nightmare that was...<br>
Got the feelin' something ain't right. I'd better hurry back to the outpost.<br>

<br>
Sanctuary Outpost - A while prior<br>
Zuihou, in her anxiousness, nearly spilled tea on the floor. Musashi comforted her, then asked her to leave the room.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Zuihou：</span><br>
If you need anything, just let me know!<br>
<br>
Nagato and Musashi listened for her nimble footsteps, waiting for them to fade before resuming their conversation.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Nagato：</span><br>
You, I, and the Great Sage all came to this sanctuary once before when the dark mist plagued the Prime Sakura.<br>
The Great Sage took the recreated Watatsumi and attempted to reach a stalemate with the dark mist. I did not watch this event to its conclusion.<br>
Just as I thought I'd be consumed by the darkness, I suddenly found myself back under the Prime Sakura in full bloom.<br>
Musashi, I ask you this: was the withering Prime Sakura within the seal no more than an illusion?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Musashi：</span><br>
That is what the Great Sage said.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">The Great Sage：</span><br>
Once the mist has been vanquished, there will no longer be a need for a seal.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Musashi：</span><br>
The seal still holds. Which means, the dark mist continues to be.<br>
And so, it continues spreading. We will only learn how severe it is by entering the seal.<br>
Well... If the seal breaks, then we'll know as well.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Nagato：</span><br>
At the very least, I've heard no reports of abnormalities from the outpost.<br>
I also tried to reach the Great Sage through the Prime Sakura's roots whilst I was asleep within my Sacred Sakura.<br>
However, the seal blocked my attempts to speak with her.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Musashi：</span><br>
All the withering Sacred Sakuras across our homeland show no sign of recovery.<br>
There's no guarantee that cleansing the Prime Sakura will solve the problem at its roots, even if the dark mist is responsible.<br>
That being the case, our only option is to head inside the seal and investigate.<br>
A troubling proposition, as doing so invariably means fighting the Shadow of Corruption.<br>
You are powerful, Guardian Fox, but it would be extremely dangerous even for you.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Nagato：</span><br>
Yes, that is why we must finish the ritual the Great Stage started, and quickly.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Musashi：</span><br>
What ritual?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Nagato：</span><br>
Though it lacks a name, the Watatsumi Chronicles do speak of a ritual involving the seal.<br>
Perhaps it was made for a time precisely such as this.<br>
If you're concerned of my safety, Musashi, do not be.<br>
I laid out my resolve when you, Akagi, Mikasa, and I faced off. I've not neglected to prepare for a circumstance such as this.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Musashi：</span><br>
Very well. I shall help you with this ritual, then.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Nagato：</span><br>
You need not waste your time. The girls stationed here may do it.<br>
<br>
Nagato took a sip of her tea and looked around the room.<br>
It was furnished like a traditional Sakuran room, not reminiscent at all of a military base. It was simple, like a room at a roadside inn.<br>
If one removed the view of the Prime Sakura through the window, it would be the spitting image of an average room.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Nagato：</span><br>
Hmh. Owari is absent.<br>
<br>
Another sip from her teacup.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Musashi：</span><br>
If I may, Lady Nagato, I think I should give them the order.<br>
<br>
Without skipping a beat, Musashi took out a brush and paper from the storage and brought them to the table.<br>
With refined handwriting, she composed a list of the materials needed for the ritual that Nagato spoke of.<br>
That was when, suddenly...<br>
*clunk* *rattle*<br>
Something in the room fell over.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">???：</span><br>
*yaaaawn*...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Natori：</span><br>
Hatsuzuki... Zuihou... Where are you?<br>
<br>
The sliding door parted, revealing a sleepy-looking young girl, rubbing her eyes.<br>
A curious, mirror-like object hovered beside her. Musashi and Nagato knew instinctively that it and the girl were one and the same.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Natori：</span><br>
*sniff sniff*... That's the scent of Zuihou's tea!<br>
<br>
With a sleepy gait, she walked over to the table, picked up a teacup, and placed it before Nagato.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Natori：</span><br>
Zuihooou! I want some of that tea too!<br>
"You fool! That isn't Zuihou you're addressing – it's Lady Nagato!"<br>
<br>
Nagato, further confused by the mirror's incessant hoping, poured a serving of tea into the cup.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Natori：</span><br>
*gulp gulp*... Ohh, that's good!<br>
The girl completely ignored the dumbstruck Nagato and chugged all of the cup's contents.<br>
Eventually, her senses came to her. She stared back and forth between the two battleships with a surprised look on her face.<br>
H-Hatsuzuki... Wow, you've certainly had a makeover!<br>
You too, Owari... Your skin looks so pale...<br>
<br>
Musashi let out an exasperated sigh and placed her brush on the table.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Musashi：</span><br>
Lady Nagato, this little one is Natori.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Natori：</span><br>
N-Nagato? Lady Nagato is here?!<br>
The girl rubbed her eyes several times, adopted a look of shock, then retreated backwards at lightning speed.<br>
"Just as I said! You should've listened!"<br>
<br>
The realization finally hit her. Lightning quick once more, she bowed her head to the floor in apology.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Natori：</span><br>
F-f-forgive my terrible rudeness!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Musashi：</span><br>
Raise your head. We have a mission for all you stationed here – Owari included.<br>
May I ask you to help as well?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Natori：</span><br>
O-of course! Anything that's within my power!<br>
<br>
Nagato quietly rolled her eyes whilst she poured new tea into her cup.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Nagato：</span><br>
You had no chance to prepare for our arrival. Your reception will not be judged.<br>
Musashi, it is time to prepare the ritual. I trust you to gather the materials.<br>
<br>
Finishing her list with a few final strokes, Musashi then slid the paper into her sleeve.<br>
She shot a glance at Natori, who took hold of her mirror and hurriedly circled behind Musashi.<br>
She wrapped up her preparations and entered the corridor, heading for the room with girls' voices leaking through the door.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Zuihou：</span><br>
Oh! Shoot! I forgot to report that Owari has gone missing!<br>
Now I've really messed up... What if Lady Nagato or Musashi get hurt because of it?<br>
<br>
Musashi opened the door and gently addressed the clumsy yet endearing girl who nearly spilled her tea.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Musashi：</span><br>
No harm done. Moreover, we learned that Owari is safe just moments ago.<br>
Our companion will show her back to the outpost shortly.<br>

<span style="color:#4eb24e;">???：</span><br>
"To the sanctuary, where the Prime Sakura is..."<br>
"Come to its trunk, and I shall tell you everything."<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Owari：</span><br>
There it is! The voice in my head!<br>
Sounds familiar... Is it the Great Sage?<br>
<br>
Owari reached into her memory and pulled out a name, identifying the voice.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Owari：</span><br>
I can't go there, though. The Guardian Fox's barrier stops one from getting close.<br>
There's no way in hell I'm getting past that.<br>
<br>
She refuted the voice, and suddenly, a sense of unease seized her.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Owari：</span><br>
Wait... But I think I touched the Prime Sakura yesterday, and I've been havin' these weird nightmares since then...<br>
<br>
A flood of memories gushed forth, and with them came a headache as she turned to face the giant tree.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Owari：</span><br>
OH!<br>
<br>
The Prime Sakura's form began to quiver, then flashes of light out from its roots to its leaves.<br>
Complicated patterns formed up in the canopy then vanished, and the lights slowly faded.<br>
With the final ray of light going out, the lands around the sanctuary began quaking.<br>
The seal holding back the dark mist was broken.<br>

<br>
The clear blue skies turned dark in mere moments as greyish clouds enveloped the sanctuary.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Hatsuzuki：</span><br>
What's happened to the Prime Sakura?!<br>
<br>
The shipgirls rushed outside to see what was going on. Musashi, the head of the group, urged her shocked friends to calm down.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Musashi：</span><br>
No harm shall come to these girls on my watch!<br>
Roaring thunder pierced the clouds and struck right outside the outpost.<br>
The blinding light faded to reveal the silhouettes of all the shipgirls, ready for battle with riggings now deployed.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Hatsuzuki：</span><br>
Musashi! Lady Nagato is still inside the outpost!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Musashi：</span><br>
(I can't sense the mist. Has the ritual already commenced?)<br>
She's going to be fine. We have other things to worry about.<br>
The foreboding dark mist – the Shadow of Corruption – whatever you do, do not let it escape the sanctuary!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Hatsuzuki：</span><br>
"Dark mist"? "Shadow of Corruption"? Do you mean that mass on the horizon?<br>
<br>
A black tidal wave towered in the far-off distance, all but blotting out the horizon.<br>
The dark mist assuming a watery state was looming – the notion of escaping its path was unthinkable.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Musashi：</span><br>
Stay close to me!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Hatsuzuki：</span><br>
Musashi! Look out!<br>
<br>
From the encroaching tsunami emerged a black beast – no, a pitch-black leviathan.<br>
The darkness-shrouded monster raised its head and roared menacingly before engulfing Musashi whole faster than the eye could see.<br>
Immediately following that, it produced a shockwave that pushed all the remaining shipgirls back.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Hatsuzuki：</span><br>
Something's wrong! It's like... it's pushing us away!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Asanagi：</span><br>
What is happening?! Let go! Let go of me, I say!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Hatsuzuki：</span><br>
Asanagi! Zuihou! Take my hand!<br>
<br>
Some invisible, immense force pulled them further and further away from the dark mist.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Zuihou：</span><br>
I can't hold on! It's too powerful!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Hatsuzuki：</span><br>
Zuihooou!<br>
<br>
A turbulent wave of air crashed into Zuihou, and she vanished from view in the blink of an eye.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Asanagi：</span><br>
What are we supposed to do?!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Hatsuzuki：</span><br>
Hold on to something! Anything!<br>
Hatsuzuki desperately swam through the air, grabbed on to Natori's sleeve, and clutched Asanagi's heel.<br>
Through some miracle, she managed to cut the distance between the three and wrap her arms around them.<br>
Hang on tight!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Natori：</span><br>
I'll use my cheat skills! Old Man, don't you move a muscle!<br>
<br>
A brief instant later, the three laid eyes on what they were on course towards.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Zuihou：</span><br>
What the...?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Asanagi：</span><br>
What's that coming from the roots?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Hatsuzuki：</span><br>
The Prime Sakura... It's completely withered!<br>

<span style="color:#4eb24e;">???：</span><br>
Aaaahhh!<br>
Heeeeelp!<br>
<br>
In the midst of the torrent produced by the black mist, Owari heard her friends cry out whilst she tried to return to the outpost.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Owari：</span><br>
Was that... Zuihou?<br>
Nah, what am I sayin'? Ain't no way that's her.<br>
It's coming from above, and last I checked, she couldn't fly through the–<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Zuihou：</span><br>
Aaaahhh!<br>
Owariiiii! Heeeelp!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Owari：</span><br>
......<br>
You kiddin' me?<br>
What the heck are you doin' up there, girl?!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Zuihou：</span><br>
I dunno! Get me dooown!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Owari：</span><br>
How are you airborne? Did ya learn how to fly using those wings you got?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Zuihou：</span><br>
I'm not in control! Something's lifting meeee!<br>
<br>
Though she wasn't the sharpest tool in the shed, Owari quickly realized she'd need some sort of rope to save her friend.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Owari：</span><br>
What to do, what to do... Wait, I've got it! Hold on!<br>
<br>
Using her bare hands, she removed a chain from her rigging and coiled it up into a lasso.<br>
Then, like a cowgirl from a western flick, she flung it up at Zuihou.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Owari：</span><br>
Hang on tight, now!<br>
<br>
She successfully pulled Zuihou out of the air, but the momentum carrying her led her to collide with Owari.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Owari：</span><br>
Oof!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Zuihou：</span><br>
......<br>
*sniff*... *sob*...<br>
Owari! Owariii! Waaahhh!<br>
<br>
Zuihou wound up on top of Owari. Neither of them were hurt, but nonetheless, Zuihou began crying as soon as she got up.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Zuihou：</span><br>
I was so scared... *sob*...<br>
Owari... Musashi... She's...<br>
<br>
Owari, too, got up and looked around. The impact had sent them flying to one of the massive boulders floating in the sky.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Owari：</span><br>
Yeah, what about her? Did she come to the sanctuary?<br>
<br>
Zuihou, while hardly the most calm and composed person Owari knew, had never broken down crying like this before.<br>
She had many questions to ask, but first of all, finding a place to gather themselves was pertinent.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Owari：</span><br>
Hey, uh, don't cry, please?<br>
Look, we'll find a safe place for you to calm down! Follow me!<br>
You can explain all that's happened later!<br>
<br>
Owari wrapped her arms around the sobbing Zuihou. She glanced over at the withered Prime Sakura before leading Zuihou away.<br>

<br>
Hatsuzuki, Asanagi, and Natori were still holding on to each other, being dragged along by the unknown force.<br>
On one hand, the dragon made of dark mist had gone away – on the other, they'd lost all sense of direction due to the invisible current tossing them around.<br>
Natori, the lowest of the three, decided to change posture and move her body. That's when her fingertips brushed against something soft.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Natori：</span><br>
There's something here!<br>
<br>
She looked down, but couldn't see anything. It was like staring into a pitch-black abyss.<br>
She tried again, looking more closely, and this time saw ripples travel outward from the spot her fingers touched. Then, she noticed little grains of light, like distant stars in a galaxy.<br>
It was as though a body of water was below them – pliable, too, like a soft mat.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Asanagi：</span><br>
Hrmh. What an indescribable surface...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Natori：</span><br>
"Hohoho. This must be Natori's renowned water-walking skill."<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Asanagi：</span><br>
It must be quicksand – you'll sink in it if you're not careful.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Hatsuzuki：</span><br>
Asanagi, Natori, form a line and let's start our engines.<br>
We'll try to move forward. Slowly.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Natori：</span><br>
You can stand on it too?! So it wasn't my skill! What are we dealing with here?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Hatsuzuki：</span><br>
I have no idea, and I don't think we have time to think about it.<br>
We've got to find Zuihou quickly, then go and rescue Musashi!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Asanagi：</span><br>
Musashi... Could she be...<br>
No, that's preposterous! A wee beast made of fog could never as much as scratch Musashi!<br>
If anything, she has no doubt felled the creature by now!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Hatsuzuki：</span><br>
I hope so...<br>
Let's see if we can't reach anyone via our communicators.<br>
Hello? Does anyone read me?<br>
<br>
BRRRZZZT...<br>
KABOOOM!<br>
Out of nowhere, the mist surrounded the shipgirls, birthing creatures far smaller yet far more numerous than the black dragon.<br>
They had no set forms. One moment they were mass-produced ships, the next they were Sirens, and sometimes, even Pawns.<br>
There was only one constant among them – that they were approaching.<br>
In response, the girls adopted fighting stances and readied their cannons.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Hatsuzuki：</span><br>
We've no choice but to fight on our own for now!<br>
Come on! Let's go!<br>
{{折叠面板|内容结束}}

{{折叠面板|标题=Uphill Battle|选项=15|主框=1|样式=primary|展开=是}}
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Hatsuzuki：</span><br>
Haaaah!<br>
Hatsuzuki's sword cut the black mist away, fending off the approaching foes.<br>
However, they quickly changed form and resumed their attack.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Asanagi：</span><br>
What are these things?!<br>
<br>
Artillery fired all over the place, whipping up wind and smoke that disrupted the mist.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Hatsuzuki：</span><br>
Haaaah!<br>
...Yet once more, they simply changed form and attacked again.<br>
I hit something hard! That wasn't mist, was it...?!<br>
The moment Hatsuzuki's blade touched it this time, what was once black mist transformed into a temporary solid form.<br>
PING!<br>
She hadn't put enough strength behind it to cut through the plating, so her blade was deflected.<br>
C'mon...!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Natori：</span><br>
We've been surrounded!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Asanagi：</span><br>
Insignificant worms! Behold as my fists of fury put a dent in you!<br>
Torpedo volley! Main cannons, fire!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Hatsuzuki：</span><br>
Asanagi, don't touch that black mist!<br>
We're running out of ammo! We gotta run away while we still can!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Asanagi：</span><br>
How long do you plan to run?! Let's send up a signal flare!<br>
Owari and the others may be struggling, too, but it's better than fighting alone!<br>
Let us join up and fight together!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Natori：</span><br>
I'll take care of it!<br>
<br>
Natori pointed her main cannon toward the sky and shot a signal flare.<br>
It burst in the air, becoming a lone star in the desolate black sky.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Asanagi：</span><br>
Kh... Ammunition is wearing thin quickly...!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Hatsuzuki：</span><br>
("Fight until the last light has faded...")<br>
(I know...! I'm not giving up until the end!)<br>
{{折叠面板|内容结束}}

{{折叠面板|标题=Within the Light|选项=16|主框=1|样式=primary|展开=是}}
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Asanagi：</span><br>
Nnh?!<br>
Damn it all...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Hatsuzuki：</span><br>
Asanagi, are you out of ammo now...?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Asanagi：</span><br>
Nearly. But I have deadlier weapons. With one fist, I'll break us out of this quagmire!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Hatsuzuki：</span><br>
Natori, it's dangerous. You hide behind us.<br>
Even if only one of us can escape, you'll—<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Natori：</span><br>
How dare you?! I will be the one to protect us all using my cheat abilities!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Hatsuzuki：</span><br>
Geez, can you cut that out already?!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Asanagi：</span><br>
Yes, yes. That's enough, you two!<br>
<br>
They turned their rigging and used their broadside plating to narrowly fend off attacks. Their backs were truly against the wall now.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Hatsuzuki：</span><br>
Looks like this is it for us...<br>
<br>
But Hatsuzuki and her fellow shipgirls did not give up the fight just yet.<br>
The black mist monsters all attacked at once—<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Hatsuzuki：</span><br>
......<br>
............<br>
<br>
Hatsuzuki's surroundings were lit up as bright as daytime, as if a spotlight had been pointed at her.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Asanagi：</span><br>
What is the meaning of this...?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Natori：</span><br>
"Heheheh, mwahahahah! How do you like that?! See how they turn tail and run!"<br>
<br>
Illuminated by the light, the black mist shrieked and disappeared.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Natori：</span><br>
So waaarm...<br>
Is this Lady Nagato's ritual?<br>
<br>
The light continued to expand and envelop the trio.<br>
For some reason, there wasn't darkness outside the light anymore; something else entirely had unfolded.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Natori：</span><br>
Could it be? Teleportation magic?!<br>
<br>
Instantly after, the light became so dazzling that they saw nothing but white.<br>
{{折叠面板|内容结束}}

{{折叠面板|标题=Safe Haven|选项=17|主框=1|样式=primary|展开=是}}
<br>
Teleported away from the black mist and into a Sakura Empire garden, the trio looked back and forth at each other dubiously.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Hatsuzuki：</span><br>
......<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Asanagi：</span><br>
......<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Natori：</span><br>
......<br>
Are we... alive?<br>
<br>
Hatsuzuki abruptly pinched Asanagi's arm.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Asanagi：</span><br>
Ouch! Why?!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Hatsuzuki：</span><br>
Well, we're not dreaming!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Asanagi：</span><br>
If you wanted to check, then pinch your own cheek instead of my poor arm!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Hatsuzuki：</span><br>
But that hurts, and I don't wanna stretch my cheeks out...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Asanagi：</span><br>
What sort of logic is that?!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Natori：</span><br>
"Now, little girls, stop your arguing."<br>
<br>
The mirror jumped out of Natori's clothes.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Natori：</span><br>
Old Man! Where are we?!<br>
"My, my... Have we been returned to the Sakuran archipelago...?"<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Hatsuzuki：</span><br>
I think so... The style is Sakuran, and this place kinda looks familiar...<br>
Is it... Lady Nagato's courtyard?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Natori：</span><br>
So Lady Nagato DID save us, after all?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Asanagi：</span><br>
Let's investigate the area for the time being. Standing around won't do us any good.<br>
<br>
Rubbing her arm, Asanagi tried to start walking—<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">???：</span><br>
No.<br>
<br>
A woman's voice interrupted her.<br>
Everyone turned around toward it. There, they saw a woman in white standing next to the lake.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Unzen：</span><br>
The lake surface reflected her figure. Despite her loose attire, her shapely curves were quite plain to see.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">The Great Sage：</span><br>
If you take another half-step forward, you will fall into a bottomless abyss.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Asanagi：</span><br>
Asanagi looked down and, indeed, the ground at her feet and that just in front seemed different somehow.<br>
Taking another half-step forward would mean falling into an abyss. That much seemed to be true.<br>
Getting goosebumps from the cold chill, Asanagi pulled her extended leg back to her.<br>
Who are you...?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Natori：</span><br>
"Ho ho ho! You're a pretty little lady!"<br>
Aha! You must be a goddess! Or a hermit!<br>
<br>
Heedless of the many curious eyes on her, the Great Sage approached the shipgirls.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">The Great Sage：</span><br>
One, two, three... I see. More of your friends are still trapped in there.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Unzen：</span><br>
She went back to the lake. The once-placid waters suddenly changed, taking on a more sinister look.<br>
It was as if it wasn't a Sakura Empire courtyard's lake at all, but an abyss leading straight to hell.<br>
The Great Sage was unmoved as she gazed into the abyss.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">The Great Sage：</span><br>
...I've found your friends. Don't worry; they're okay.<br>
<br>
Light shone in the abyss, and then...<br>
Both the light and the abyss disappeared, returning the lake to its usual calm.<br>

<br>
Meanwhile, after rescuing Zuihou, Owari managed to reach the "water" within the seal and began sailing on it.<br>
They left the floating rocks behind and hid behind a safe hill.<br>
Zuihou had stopped crying, but her eyes were still red and hot.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Zuihou：</span><br>
You're so mean, Owari! You dreamed of the Prime Sakura withering, and you just went all on your own to check on it!<br>
You could've talked to me, or Hatsuzuki, or anyone! Why didn't you say anything?!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Owari：</span><br>
Sorry! It's all my fault! I won't do it again, so just forgive me, would ya?!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Zuihou：</span><br>
...You promise?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Owari：</span><br>
Uh-huh, I super duper promise.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Zuihou：</span><br>
You're not sorry at all! Geez! You don't get me, Owari!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Owari：</span><br>
I am, I swear! Pinky promise, scout's honor, and all that!<br>
Anyway, is it true that Lady Nagato and Musashi are here?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Zuihou：</span><br>
Lady Nagato is preparing some kind of ritual at the outpost.<br>
And Musashi said we needed to gather materials for the ritual, but...<br>
The Prime Sakura started withering out of nowhere...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Owari：</span><br>
Materials for a ritual, the Sakura withering...<br>
I know what's going on! Umm, the... Barrier? Seal? Whatever, I saw it disappear!<br>
Yeah! I saw it in my dream, too! The seal disappeared, so the black mist stuff in there all came out, right?!<br>
It started off in the Prime Sakura! No wonder we didn't realize it.<br>
I heard Lady Nagato reinforced the barrier when the outpost was built...<br>
But I guess that wasn't enough, huh? Rough...<br>
Huh? Musashi isn't with you?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Zuihou：</span><br>
When the barrier broke, Musashi was trying to protect us. She got taken away by the black mist...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Owari：</span><br>
Whoa, that's BAD! Gah, if only Kii was here...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Zuihou：</span><br>
Kii? Is Kii around, too? We never saw her.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Owari：</span><br>
Uh, nope, that's what I just said. She set up a secret communication line when I was assigned to this outpost...<br>
And she said to contact her if anything happened so she could pass it on to Musashi.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Zuihou：</span><br>
Mmh... You could've told us!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Owari：</span><br>
Maybe I just forgot, y'know?<br>
A-anyway, there's no use talking about all this complex stuff right now! I'm gonna get a headache if we keep this up!<br>
We got separated from the others, and Musashi got taken away from us...<br>
Most of all, the Prime Sakura's in such awful shape...<br>
Zuihou, can you send out your carrier-based craft?<br>
Instead of going crazy on our own, I think we should try sending your carrier-based craft out to search for the others.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Zuihou：</span><br>
Okay! Leave it to me!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Owari：</span><br>
Also...<br>
<br>
Owari peeked over the hill to get a look at her surroundings.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Owari：</span><br>
No good... I can't tell where the heck that outpost is...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Zuihou：</span><br>
J-just leave it all to me, okay?<br>

<br>
In the dark, cold seal, monsters made of black mist shrieked and roared ceaselessly.<br>
They jumped between the ethereal sea and floating rocks, launched out of the ground by the uprooting of the Prime Sakura, searching for the targets of their ire.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">The Great Sage：</span><br>
............<br>
<br>
After the signal flare from before, she'd used the seal's divine light to find and rescue the trio.<br>
The light had repelled the black mist and brought them to this safe haven for the time being.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">The Great Sage：</span><br>
I did warn them not to try to walk around, so I'm sure they will be safe for now.<br>
Next...<br>
<br>
She had a general idea of their remaining friends' whereabouts, but there was no way to narrow it down and help them.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">The Great Sage：</span><br>
That sound... Is that aircraft?<br>
<br>
A single carrier-based aircraft, hardly useful in the black mist's domain, quickly lost control and crash-landed.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">The Great Sage：</span><br>
Which direction...? Aha, that way.<br>
<br>
She stepped into the ethereal waters and used the sanctuary's power to rush to the shipgirls' aid.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Zuihou：</span><br>
I-I've lost another carrier-based craft!<br>
Urk... I don't have any more recon craft to send out...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Owari：</span><br>
This is rough... It's dangerous, but I've got no choice but to act.<br>
But first... Let's deal with what's right in front of us!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Zuihou：</span><br>
S-someone's coming this way!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Owari：</span><br>
I'll give 'em the trouncing of a lifetime! Which way, Zuihou?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Zuihou：</span><br>
Behind you! Six o' clock!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Owari：</span><br>
Behind me?!<br>
<br>
Noticing a presence in an unexpected direction, Owari used her rigging to whip around in a hurry.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Owari：</span><br>
Fiiiire!<br>
<br>
*PING*<br>
Her shells were deflected by an invisible barrier, covering the surroundings in smoke.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">???：</span><br>
*cough* *cough*...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Owari：</span><br>
...A shipgirl?!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">???：</span><br>
Heehee. Bit of a rude welcome, I have to say.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Unzen：</span><br>
She floated above the water without rigging, but there was no doubt she was a shipgirl just like Owari and Zuihou.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Zuihou：</span><br>
Sorry, sorry!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Owari：</span><br>
(I think I saw this person in that illusion... Great Sage, or something?)<br>
<br>
As she approached the Prime Sakura, Owari's memory of the illusion became more vivid.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Owari：</span><br>
Great Sage...?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">The Great Sage：</span><br>
That is me. I've taken your friends to a safe place, and now, I'll have you two come with me as well.<br>
It's the last pure land remaining in this seal. With my power, I will protect you all.<br>
<br>
Once she finished talking, light shone through the sky and enveloped Owari and Zuihou.<br>
However, the pillar of light flickered multiple times before disappearing.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Zuihou：</span><br>
...Was that a light signal, or...?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">The Great Sage：</span><br>
Unfortunately, straying too far away makes it consume far too much power... My remaining strength isn't enough.<br>
We have no choice. I'll just have to guide you myself.<br>
Come with me.<br>

<span style="color:#4eb24e;">The Great Sage：</span><br>
Zuihou, I need your aerial coverage.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Zuihou：</span><br>
On it!<br>
Most of my little birds are, uh, gone, but I'll send what I have left!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">The Great Sage：</span><br>
Make sure you stay close! We can't have you getting lost!<br>
<br>
They cruised through the shapeless sea and approached the light emanating from the fallen Prime Sakura's branches.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Owari：</span><br>
Hey, apologies if I just need glasses, but ain't the light comin' from the branches kinda fading?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Zuihou：</span><br>
Owari! Look out!<br>
<br>
An enemy vessel made of dark mist fired a volley at Owari. She dodged, but lost her balance briefly.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Owari：</span><br>
Aw crap! There's enemies, like, all around us!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Zuihou：</span><br>
All around us, and more are showing up! They have us completely surrounded!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">The Great Sage：</span><br>
...They're not after you. It's me they want.<br>
<br>
The Great Sage descended from the air and stood on the water's surface.<br>
She drew her katana, unleashing a wave of spiritual energy that stopped the misty foes in their tracks.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">The Great Sage：</span><br>
This much range should be sufficient.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Zuihou：</span><br>
What are you gonna do?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Unzen：</span><br>
The Great Sage did not answer. She summoned a pillar of light from above Owari and Zuihou.<br>
Once they were fully encased in light, she moved closer.<br>
A smile flashed on her lips as she bid them goodbye.<br>
Then, she turned on her heel, and went forth to face the army of enemies all alone.<br>

<br>
All of a sudden, the courtyard Hatsuzuki's team found themselves in began to rumble.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Asanagi：</span><br>
Is that an earthquake?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Hatsuzuki：</span><br>
No, it's not! Look at the sky!<br>
<br>
A giant crack formed in the clear night sky, different from the crack within the seal.<br>
From it, dark mist began to gush forth and infect this domain, too.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">The Great Sage：</span><br>
It's time.<br>
<br>
Butterflies glowing blue began to circle around the Great Sage as she stood in the courtyard.<br>
It wasn't long before the butterflies eventually covered every inch of her body.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Natori：</span><br>
What in the world?!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Hatsuzuki：</span><br>
Natori! The mist is coming for us again!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Asanagi：</span><br>
How did it find us all the way here?!<br>
<br>
Ever more dark mist continued to pour out of the great hole in the sky. The girls, all but out of ammunition, were cornered.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Natori：</span><br>
Hey, where'd that other lady go?<br>
<br>
In the spot where the Great Sage previously stood, a pillar of light projected skywards.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Asanagi：</span><br>
Somebody else is teleporting in!<br>
<br>
The new arrivals fired a volley at the girls through the light before they could so much as be identified.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Owari：</span><br>
Damn! They're everywhere!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Asanagi：</span><br>
We are not "them"! At least identify us before you fire at us!<br>
<br>
It wasn't until the light faded that both sides finally recognized each other.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Asanagi：</span><br>
Owari! Zuihou!<br>
Thank the heavens you are alright! We'd feared for the worst!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Owari：</span><br>
Hey, Asanagi! How come you're all here? Actually, first, where even are we?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Hatsuzuki：</span><br>
In the so-called "safe haven," apparently. Although, it's not so safe anymore, I guess...<br>
First thing first – we have to deal with these enemies!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Asanagi：</span><br>
We're here to begin with because we CAN'T deal with them! Only that lady seemed capable of it with her columns of light.<br>
And now, she has vanished!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Owari：</span><br>
"That lady"? Does she have white hair and wear white clothes, by any chance?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Asanagi：</span><br>
That she does. What of it?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Owari：</span><br>
Aha! I knew it was the Great Sage. She's the one who saved you all, and...<br>
Wait... If she did that, then who was the person we met just earlier?<br>
Either that one was a ghost, or she has an identical twin...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Asanagi：</span><br>
Are you suggesting there is not one, but two Great Sages?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Owari：</span><br>
Not exactly! Because, like, I accidentally fired at her, and she blocked the shot.<br>
So at the very least, the one we ran into was the real deal!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Hatsuzuki：</span><br>
Right... In other words, the person we spoke to was just a phantom.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Asanagi：</span><br>
Nonsense. This Great Sage saved us, too, lest you forget.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Natori：</span><br>
Then she knows not just teleportation magic, but also how to clone herself and create phantoms out of butterflies.<br>
"The lass is either a goddess or a hermit."<br>
Yeah, Old Man! As I said, it all makes sense if she's a hermit!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Hatsuzuki：</span><br>
It really doesn't matter what you call her...<br>
Let's put that aside and try to think of any way to deal with the mist, before we lose the courtyard to it.<br>

<br>
Musashi had been swallowed whole by the dragon of black mist. Aimlessly, she had been roaming a plane of darkness for hours.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Musashi：</span><br>
......<br>
<br>
That's when a light appeared – the light from the ritual Nagato previously performed inside the seal – and enveloped her.<br>
The light showed her a vision of the Guardian Fox performing the same ritual.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Musashi：</span><br>
Lady Nagato...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Nagato：</span><br>
Forgive me. I should've come sooner.<br>
Do you know where the rest of the girls are?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Musashi：</span><br>
I do not. But, assuming the Great Sage's seal still hasn't been fully destroyed...<br>
Then there is one place. The only place they could seek shelter.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Nagato：</span><br>
The Prime Sakura... They must be within the seal.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Musashi：</span><br>
I'll go inside to look for them, as well as for any traces of the Great Sage.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Nagato：</span><br>
Aye. I will soon begin the main part of the ritual, and I have no leeway to rescue the others.<br>
Only you can do it, Musashi. I trust you to save them.<br>
I will send you to the inside of the seal. Once you find the others, set fire to this talisman.<br>
I shall then use the power of the sanctuary's seal to transport all of you outside it.<br>
But, to fully resolve this abnormality, we will need the Great Sage's help.<br>
As it stands, my powers alone are insufficient to seal away the dark mist.<br>
Replicating the Watatsumi worked once. To purge the mist, we will need to take a different approach.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Musashi：</span><br>
You're referring to the dragon god?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Nagato：</span><br>
That, I am not. Never mind that – focus on finding the others as soon as possible.<br>
Once I know that you're all safe, I will attempt to strengthen the seal temporarily.<br>
As brilliant as the Great Sage's ritual is, it cannot even keep the situation from worsening as long as she is the Watatsumi.<br>
Especially now that the Watatsumi's power has nearly run out.<br>

<br>
Danger approached the courtyard, the final safe haven left by the Great Sage.<br>
Now that the seal was broken, the dark mist grew stronger. It now tried to encroach upon the last pure land in the Prime Sakura's sanctuary.<br>
Indeed, just as the moon up above was eroded by shadow...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Hatsuzuki：</span><br>
A lunar eclipse...?<br>
<br>
The shipgirls gathered by the lake that served as the entrance to the abyss.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Owari：</span><br>
That rift lettin' the black mist in is gettin' the moon, too... But that's a whole lot of mist!<br>
<br>
Before long, the fleeting night sky had been almost fully engulfed in black mist.<br>
It solidified into the shape of crows and carrier-based craft that flew through the black.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Owari：</span><br>
Get behind me, everyone!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Hatsuzuki：</span><br>
Owari, do you still have ammo?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Owari：</span><br>
Just a li'l! I can still fight a while!<br>
How 'bout you all?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Hatsuzuki：</span><br>
Of course!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Asanagi：</span><br>
I shall fight, too!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Owari：</span><br>
Natori, protect Zuihou! We'll show you what we're capable of together!<br>
<br>
Their main guns roared like thunder, shaking their surroundings.<br>
Meanwhile, real thunder crackled beyond the rift.<br>
Purple lightning shone upon the full moon, warding off the black mist.<br>
Lightning, symbolic of the Guardian Fox's authority, flashed multiple more times.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Owari：</span><br>
Musashi!<br>
<br>
Divine lightning struck the courtyard from above.<br>
Air that had once been filled with black mist cleared up all at once, causing all of the black to disappear in the storm.<br>
The rift in the sky shrunk, and the black mist that had seeped through was sucked back into it.<br>
After peace and calm had returned to the courtyard, Musashi appeared before the shipgirls.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Owari：</span><br>
Musashi, it really is you!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Musashi：</span><br>
Owari, Zuihou, Asanagi, Hatsuzuki. Is that everyone?<br>
.........<br>
Am I to assume that nobody else is here?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Owari：</span><br>
Oh... Right!<br>
I dunno if she was the real one or an illusion, but the Great Sage was just here a minute ago!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Musashi：</span><br>
I see. So the Great Sage is alive and well.<br>
Listen well. The one who created this seal, and thus the Prime Sakura, was not the Guardian Fox. It was the Great Sage.<br>
When disaster fell upon the Prime Sakura long ago, Lady Nagato and I worked with the Great Sage to empower the black mist's seal.<br>
However, due to the Reenactment of Watatsumi, the Great Sage was forced to remain here.<br>
Lady Nagato established the sanctuary outpost in order to research how to rescue the Great Sage, find out how to expel the darkness, and keep an eye on the seal.<br>
Now that the seal has begun to rupture, those who monitor the sanctuary at the outpost...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Owari：</span><br>
So we're, like... free from duty now?<br>
Hmm... Now that you mention it, what was that illusion I saw before?<br>
Just to be sure, WE didn't break the seal or anythin' crazy like that, right?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Hatsuzuki：</span><br>
I doubt that. We didn't really help much though, did we...?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Musashi：</span><br>
I'll have to disagree. The message Owari sent to Kii and the signal flare you fired both helped to notify everyone of this situation.<br>
Thanks to your drive to struggle to the very end, we've managed to barely maintain the sanctuary's seal.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Hatsuzuki：</span><br>
What's this...?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Zuihou：</span><br>
Lady Nagato's charm?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Musashi：</span><br>
Yes. Use it, now.<br>
<br>
Musashi handed it to Hatsuzuki.<br>
When she accepted it, the charm burst into flames and burned up in almost an instant.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Hatsuzuki：</span><br>
.........<br>
Musashi? Wh-what happened?<br>
I didn't do anything wrong, did I? O-or did I mess it up...?<br>
Urk... I burned Lady Nagato's precious charm, just like that...<br>
I've really done it now... Ugh...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Musashi：</span><br>
You did nothing wrong. This allows Lady Nagato to know where we are.<br>
<br>
Light shone from above—that was the signal for teleportation magic.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Musashi：</span><br>
"It will be but a shell, exhausted of its power, but it should still help you change this nation's future."<br>
Great Sage... No, you are no empty shell.<br>

<br>
Consciousness—a blank, white space constructed only of a simple mental image.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">The Great Sage：</span><br>
To annihilate the black mist is to return it to nothingness.<br>
Not a conflux of heaven and earth, not a harmony of yin and yang. A complete removal.<br>
As if it had never existed in history to begin with.<br>
That is the end of Watatsumi – the end of you and I.<br>
No, perhaps it isn't an end. For we'll have never existed at all.<br>
I, born to bear human wishes. You, born to give them form. Our essence is fundamentally the same.<br>
Am I wrong?<br>
Hmm. Perhaps my attempts to bear the concept of Watatsumi have changed me.<br>
I still can't forget the people I met that night...<br>
With this power, I've seen countless branches destroyed.<br>
I finally realized that this was the only way to ensure survival.<br>
Annihilation. That's the only way.<br>
I know that.<br>
I do.<br>
That is the will of Watatsumi and the Great Sage...<br>
That is the resolve to confront fate, a resolve that cannot be shaken...<br>
Yet I only exist... because my resolve was shaken.<br>
Because I wanted to feel this ever-so-beloved world... To bathe in its sunshine and savor its seasons.<br>
To let the wanderlust take over, to see the smiles of other people.<br>
To throw myself into this beautiful world, just as I did on that rainy night when the wisterias danced.<br>
And... I want to be reunited with you.<br>
That is the reason I am here, after failing to bring the Reenactment to bear.<br>
Waiting for one miraculous moment, not as Watatsumi, not as the Great Sage.<br>
My one desire...<br>
Is to be able to meet you again.<br>
That's all I need.<br>
...Have they made it out of the seal?<br>
Hmm. Perhaps my attempts to bear the concept of Watatsumi have changed me.<br>
That's wonderful.<br>
I've already made up my mind.<br>

<br>
First, a swing. Cutting the dark mist's clouds aside, using the momentum to leap forth.<br>
Second, a stab. The blade pierced the enemy's heart and dispersed it.<br>
Black mist condensed once more into the shape of a human.<br>
The Shadow of Corruption reflected her figure, her features, even her presence.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">The Great Sage：</span><br>
...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Unzen：</span><br>
Third, a sweep. The two opponents' swords clashed, sending sparks flying.<br>
Fourth, a quick-draw. She took a half-step back and sheathed her blade. The moment the shadow showed an opening—<br>
She loosened her sword slightly and unleashed a powerful blow upon the defenseless mist.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">The Great Sage：</span><br>
Haaaah!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Unzen：</span><br>
The sword drew a crescent moon arc in the darkness of night.<br>
<br>
Her strike, affixed with the concept of the seal, cleansed the wicked mist.<br>
All is futile.<br>
As if taunting her, the darkness formed an army and roared as it closed in from all directions.<br>
...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Unzen：</span><br>
She jumped straight upward, causing the army to collide and collapse into itself.<br>
She then pulled back her long, flowing clothes, keeping them out of enemy reach as she danced out of range.<br>
<br>
All is futile.<br>
She weaved between black figures, aiming for the core—one that emitted a red gleam.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">The Great Sage：</span><br>
Found you.<br>
<br>
She instantly accelerated, aiming her blade tip toward it.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">The Great Sage：</span><br>
Prepare to be annihilated.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Unzen：</span><br>
Though the thrust was backed by all her strength, the blade was stopped just short of the core.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">The Great Sage：</span><br>
This is...<br>
<br>
Made not of flesh and blood, the black body emitted an ominous aura.<br>
The Shadow of Corruption seized the blade in its hands and roared.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">The Great Sage：</span><br>
The end... of me and Watatsumi...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Unzen：</span><br>
Arm after arm lunged from the black mist, trying to rip the blade away.<br>
<br>
「———」<br>
The sword broke, and a black shockwave exploded throughout the sanctuary.<br>
Powerless and limp, she fell pitifully onto a floating mass of rock and soil.<br>
The mist's core was once again concealed, and it condensed once more into a horrifying monster. The beast opened its maw and swallowed the sanctuary's protector.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">The Great Sage：</span><br>
...<br>

<span style="color:#4eb24e;">The Great Sage：</span><br>
Why have you come again?<br>
No matter how many times I face destruction, I will appear here again.<br>
Because I am you. I am Watatsumi.<br>
Then pass that burden to me.<br>
I... cannot.<br>
This is my duty. Something that only I can do.<br>
The destiny I believe in is different.<br>
Countless times I have seen visions of entire branches, wiped away. Countless times, I have seen them come to fruition until I had no choice but to understand.<br>
Destruction is inevitable. Your efforts will only amplify the pain and misfortune.<br>
Only by abandoning the self and choosing annihilation can you prolong this world's existence.<br>
I see...<br>
Is this my belief as the Great Sage, rather than that of Watatsumi?<br>
How noble it is to bear the weight of the world upon your shoulders. To become a martyr.<br>
But that is the duty of a god, not that of a human.<br>
Who am I to transcend above the mortal realm, looking down upon creation like some sort of god? No salvation can come from that.<br>
I must be... not a bystander of this world, but a member of it... A single grain of sand among many.<br>
Even if all of my effort is in vain...<br>
Even if inevitable destruction comes...<br>
All that I've done to defy destiny will remain as proof that I was human.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Unzen：</span><br>
In this mental space, she offered a hand to "herself."<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">The Great Sage：</span><br>
Watatsumi, Great Sage... Join me.<br>
As one will. One concept. One shipgirl.<br>
Let us purge the dark mist that threatens to burn the world down.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Unzen：</span><br>
She held fast to her volition and adjusted the concept that anchored her existence.<br>
<br>
In the white space, a kaleidoscope of butterflies surrounded, approached, and crossed between them.<br>
No longer were there two figures confronting each other—they were one now.<br>
In the center of the seal, a shikigami dragon curled up its giant figure.<br>
It made a cocoon, wherein a new being was born.<br>
The light symbolizing the concept of the sanctuary seeped in through the gaps in the paper cocoon.<br>
The concept recorded in her hull bubbled to her surface.<br>
In her rigging, she saw her existence in a new light.<br>
Collected thoughts, engraved memories, defined moments.<br>
Her rigging, though it affixed to her as a mere item, was given life as an essential part of the concept that was her new self.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Unzen：</span><br>
This is my rigging.<br>
I am... the heavy cruiser Unzen.<br>
<br>
Her time as the Great Sage that protected the sanctuary, her time as Watatsumi, had come to an end.<br>
She had taken back her identity as the shipgirl Unzen.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Unzen：</span><br>
............<br>
Why, it already fits me like a glove.<br>
<br>
The shikigami dragon floated away slowly as another shipgirl appeared before Unzen.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Shimanto：</span><br>
Great Sage... No, Unzen.<br>
I am the blueprint ship, Shimanto. On Musashi's orders, I have come to release you.<br>
Like yourself, your rigging is an embodiment of ideals brought into reality, and that made it difficult for me to gather information...<br>
But my tireless efforts have borne fruit, and your powers have finally been restored.<br>
Now, you are no longer the Great Sage, but a shipgirl of the Sakura Empire just like us.<br>
Without Watatsumi, the seal is extremely unstable, but that also means you are no longer bound to be its steward.<br>
...In short, you've been saved by the great Dragon God.<br>
Well, Owari helped too, but the sudden rupture of the seal meant I had to adjust my plan on the fly.<br>
Sorry. To make it up to you, I'll pass on the offering this time. Call us even.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Unzen：</span><br>
Great Dragon God, allow me to correct you about one thing.<br>
While Watatsumi indeed played an important role, it was not the only thing maintaining the seal.<br>
For me... No, for all of the Sakura Empire...<br>
This battle is not over yet.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Shimanto：</span><br>
That's right.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Unzen：</span><br>
However, now that I am no longer the Great Sage, it will be much more difficult to control the sanctuary's power.<br>
I can confirm that the Guardian Fox is deploying the ritual, but there isn't much time left to destroy the black mist's core.<br>
To that end, I humbly beseech your assistance.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Shimanto：</span><br>
Say no more!<br>

<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Shimanto：</span><br>
Behold– the might of the Dragon God!<br>
<br>
The concept of the seal had weakened, and Unzen now confronted the black mist with Shimanto's support.<br>
Shimanto protected herself with her shikigami dragon, supporting Unzen from afar as she sailed through the void sea.<br>
Despite the paper-like appearance of her rigging, Shimanto was easily able to repel the attacks from the black mist.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Shimanto：</span><br>
Unzen, now!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Unzen：</span><br>
Now, may this place be cleansed by my flames!<br>
<br>
The explosive impacts of her artillery fire caused the shadows to reel back.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Shimanto：</span><br>
The corruption is gathering... It's going to unleash its full might!<br>
<br>
The serpentine heads of the beast created by the creeping shadows continued to grow longer and longer.<br>
The leviathan's coils continued to grow and expand, casting a profound darkness across all who turned who would turn their heads upward at it to wallow in their utter insignificance.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Shimanto：</span><br>
No effect. In that case...!<br>
<br>
The Dragon God struck again, but her attacks were not even enough to cause a ripple in the infinite darkness.<br>
The next moment, another of the leviathan's heads erupted from the water's surface, bearing its unfathomable form down upon the shipgirls there.<br>
The beast seemed inevitable.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Shimanto：</span><br>
Kh...?!<br>
<br>
The paper dragon placed itself in the path of the mist's onslaught, but shattered the moment it came into contact with its yawning maw.<br>
All seemed to be futile–<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">???：</span><br>
......<br>
Impurity be purged!<br>
<br>
In a flash, only a single blade of cold steel held the threshold before the abyss.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ibuki：</span><br>
Kh...?!<br>
Back off, you two!<br>
<br>
Using the massive beast's momentum, Ibuki parried the leviathan's head aside and sent it hurtling into a nearby island.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Shimanto：</span><br>
Who...?!<br>
<br>
Just as quickly as she had appeared to save the day, Ibuki disappeared beneath the eruption of debris, leaving the other two to scramble for cover.<br>
Unzen and Shimanto looked at each other with tacit agreement. They had to find a way to mount a counterattack, and fast.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Shimanto：</span><br>
Lady Nagato doesn't have much time left... Unzen, do you have a plan?<br>
<br>
When asked, Unzen thought for a moment before releasing her rigging.<br>
That part of her being became butterflies of light that disappeared into her left eye.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Unzen：</span><br>
Shimanto, I have a request.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Shimanto：</span><br>
Sure. I'll do whatever it takes!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Unzen：</span><br>
If we can break the "core" of the black mist, we'll be able to fend it off long enough to restore the seal.<br>
But that involves jumping into the depths of that darkness. We'll only have one chance.<br>
I will need to call upon the Prime Sakura to make that moment count–<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Shimanto：</span><br>
Understood. Before that though, I'll do my part–<br>
...and clear a way to the core!<br>

<br>
Outside the sanctuary...<br>
Sakura Empire - Nagato's Abode<br>
It was just before dawn, and the horizon to the east was beginning to brighten.<br>
The Guardian Fox's little sister, Mutsu, opened a silk pouch and retrieved the roll of paper from within.<br>
Inside was a message from Nagato. A mere few lines of text.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Mutsu：</span><br>
Huh?!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Kawakaze：</span><br>
Lady Mutsu, where are you going?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Mutsu：</span><br>
We have to help Nagato! Kawakaze, get ready, fast!<br>
Send a message to everyone in the Sakura Empire! We need to light the lanterns!<br>
<br>
In almost no time at all, a massive lantern rose in the sky above the castle's ramparts.<br>
It ascended higher and higher, carried by the Prime Sakura's power, shining more brilliantly than the brightest star.<br>
After a long night of guard duty, Sakawa witnessed the lanterns' rise from her bedroom.<br>
She rushed outside, to the site of Musashi's own giant lantern, where she ran into Kii.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Sakawa：</span><br>
W-woah, what's the occasion? Did someone start a festival without me or something?<br>
<br>
Unlike Sakawa, who was still scrambling to order her thoughts in her head, Kii was quite calm in comparison – almost even excited.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Sakawa：</span><br>
We only light the big lanterns to notify everyone of an emergency, right?! Then that means...<br>
Lady Nagato calls for aid!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Kii：</span><br>
.........<br>
And the Sakura Empire will answer.<br>
Let's light the giant lantern!<br>
<br>
Another lantern ascended skyward.<br>
Before long, others began to rise in response. Lights began to dot the horizon, as far as the eye could see.<br>
One after another, the lanterns rose into the skies, forming their own galactic river in the early morning sky.<br>
And, as if guided by said river, they slowly floated toward the Prime Sakura.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Mutsu：</span><br>
Nagato...<br>
<br>
Mutsu gingerly placed one hand on the sacred tree, its dry bark betraying its spent power more clearly than ever before.<br>
The Sacred Sakura trees, symbols of human wishes – their indomitable will to dream – were all connected by their roots to the Prime Sakura.<br>
While corruption could spread through these roots, so too could the heartfelt wishes that nourished the Sacred Sakura.<br>
Countless hands from all over the Sakura Empire extended toward the Prime Sakura's sanctuary, gently holding its withered roots and imbuing it with vitality.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Mutsu：</span><br>
Nagato...<br>
This has to help you somehow, Nagato...<br>
Nagato, please be safe.<br>

<br>
A flash of a sword dispersed the thick, black mist.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ibuki：</span><br>
Lady Shimanto, Lady Unzen, leave this place to me!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Shimanto：</span><br>
Ibuki?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ibuki：</span><br>
Yes! I had resumed training for the sake of my master, but the way the air had changed made me suspicious, so I entered the sanctuary...<br>
I-I do know that I shouldn't enter the sanctuary without permission, but I was just so worried about what was happening in here.<br>
Anyway, long story short, I came running to help you all.<br>
As a fellow member of the Sakura Empire, I cannot overlook this situation!<br>
I may not be much help, but I offer what protection I can give!<br>
<br>
<br>
Unzen faced the rampaging beast anew and tightened her grip on her twin swords. A new power flowed into them and coalesced around her blades, giving them a new form.<br>
She recalled the sight of her own countless failures in past dreams.<br>
Her swords hadn't been broken yet, and she now had others by her side.<br>
Light gathered around her, creating many swords with the power of the concept of cleansing.<br>
They created a wall of flashing steel around the shipgirls, repelling any shadows that dared encroach.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Unzen：</span><br>
Closer...<br>
Just a little closer...<br>
<br>
She channeled all her focus into a single point as she continued parrying and warding off the darkness, drawing ever nearer to the core.<br>
No matter what attacks the enemy threw at her, she knew that she was not alone.<br>
Shimanto and Ibuki had been beside her this entire time.<br>
Lights from bursts of flame and glints of steel continued to dance and weave together, never wavering while she was yet to complete her work.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Shimanto：</span><br>
Unzen!<br>
We're not going to be able to hold out much longer!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ibuki：</span><br>
Unzen!<br>
Lady Unzen, you'll have to go the rest of the way yourself!<br>
<br>
Shimanto's shikigami dragon had already caught on fire, yet it still tried to throw itself in the way of the enemy.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ibuki：</span><br>
Ugh... My blade's about to give out...<br>
<br>
Ibuki cast a single glance at the notches that the shadow's teeth had left in her dulled blade, before anointing it once more in the flames of battle without hesitation.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Unzen：</span><br>
I mustn't subject you to any further danger...<br>
Soon, my blade will reach the core!<br>
<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ibuki：</span><br>
Lady Unzen!<br>
I must withdraw!<br>
<br>
Finally, the place where Ibuki once danced her flurry of blades fell dark and silent.<br>
Unzen was all alone.<br>
The leviathan of shadow looked down upon the tiny speck of light within its domain of endless darkness with the contempt of a god.<br>
「Meaningless. Futile. Hopeless. Worthless. All is in vain.」<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Unzen：</span><br>
You're wrong.<br>
<br>
Nothing lasts, like bubbles on the water's surface. Wasted effort, like a castle of sand before the inevitable tide.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Unzen：</span><br>
It isn't futile at all.<br>
I've witnessed the destruction of countless branches.<br>
Each time, I made the same decision.<br>
I believed it was the Great Sage's destiny to be annihilated from existence along with you.<br>
I believed it was Watatsumi's destiny to be the cocoon from which fate hatched.<br>
But I am not the Great Sage, and I am not Watatsumi.<br>
<br>
Redundant. Ostentatious. Unavailing. The incoherent mutterings of someone lost in dreams.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Unzen：</span><br>
Indeed. I tried to banish my emotions so that I could become the vessel through which the Reenactment would bear out.<br>
But now, my hull is full of emotions that never should have been let in.<br>
Yearning for another, the desire to see them again...<br>
Doubt, hesitation, indecision, irresolution.<br>
All of these emotions define who I am, here and now.<br>
I am a shipgirl, and I am a human.<br>
I...<br>
...am no god.<br>
......<br>
And neither are you!<br>
<br>
<br>
The released power of the sacred tree filled the seal and became a sword of energy that pierced the sky.<br>
Both the cloud canopy and Shadow of Corruption alike were split in two, showing a glimpse of a different-colored sky beyond.<br>
The leviathan of mist writhed, as if feeling real agony.<br>
Already having lost its form, the mist began gathering in one place.<br>
Instead of launching a counterattack, or even displaying a hint of malice, it was actually trying to flee.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Shimanto：</span><br>
Unzen!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ibuki：</span><br>
Shimanto, are you alright?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Shimanto：</span><br>
Heheh, remember, I am the Dragon God! That was nothing to me...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Unzen：</span><br>
We mustn't let the core escape us!<br>
<br>
The corpse of the beast spat out a black mass that emitted dark-red light as it passed over the shipgirls' heads.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ibuki：</span><br>
Is that... the core?!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Unzen：</span><br>
We can't possibly catch up from here!<br>
<br>
It was then that the clouds covering the sky opened up.<br>
That was the sanctuary sky that Sakuran shipgirls knew. The sight outside of the seal.<br>
Seemingly of its own volition, the core ascended toward the opening in the clouds.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Unzen：</span><br>
In that case...!<br>
<br>
Unzen fired her cannons, but the core had already escaped just beyond her range.<br>
At this rate, the calamitous black mist would reach the outside world—<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Nagato：</span><br>
Haaaaaah!<br>
<br>
The core collided with a glowing, pink pattern—the seal.<br>
The glyphs of power spread like ripples on water, engulfing the entirety of the black mist.<br>
The moment it had the mist in its clutches, the seal condensed into the roots of the Prime Sakura, the center of the ritual.<br>
Time seemed to flow backwards. The withered Prime Sakura and the islands of earth floating in the air all began returning to their original form.<br>
Thus, the black mist was sealed once more.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ibuki：</span><br>
Lady Nagato!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Nagato：</span><br>
I-I made it...<br>
Great Sage... I've repaired... the seal...<br>
<br>
No sooner as those words left her lips, Nagato collapsed to the ground, unconscious.<br>
The nearly-escaped core had been dragged instantly back into the seal. Now, its presence was seemingly gone.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ibuki：</span><br>
Lady Nagato!<br>
<br>
Ibuki rushed to help her.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ibuki：</span><br>
...Phew. Thank goodness, it's just fatigue.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Shimanto：</span><br>
Even for the Guardian Fox, performing a ritual of such scale by force...<br>
How much did she have to push herself for that? Phew...<br>
I sure do have a long way to go.<br>
<br>
Exhausted from the fierce battle, Shimanto collapsed to her knees to take a break.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Unzen：</span><br>
Lady Nagato, Shimanto, Ibuki. It's an honor to have fought with you.<br>
<br>
Unzen stabbed her swords into the soil. As the sacred tree's remaining power had returned to the sanctuary, the swords disappeared as well.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Unzen：</span><br>
It's almost time.<br>
<br>
One blue butterfly landed by Unzen, followed by hundreds, no, a thousand more.<br>
The light cast by their wings extended slowly toward the Prime Sakura.<br>
Voices of the other shipgirls in the sanctuary reached them from afar.<br>
Amidst the cherry blossom-colored rain, the Prime Sakura also slowly merged with the light...<br>
Floating along the river towards destinations unknown.<br>
When they turned back, Unzen was already gone.<br>

<br>
Past – Somewhere in the Sakura Islands<br>
The special exercise to decide the new flagship, along with the events with Kaga, Amagi, and Akagi, had passed.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Musashi：</span><br>
How is Lady Nagato doing?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Kii：</span><br>
Presumably safe and sleeping in the Prime Sakura?<br>
However, I don't think that's what it's for...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Musashi：</span><br>
Don't ever breathe a word of this to anyone again.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Kii：</span><br>
...Yes, ma'am.<br>
Anyway, are you sure I should really just write that Lady Nagato gave up her position as flagship because of the Reenactment?<br>
If she's hurt, then we should really tell everyone...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Musashi：</span><br>
We don't know how others might act if it's known that the Sakura Empire Combined Fleet's flagship is wounded and unable to battle.<br>
Lady Nagato herself has expressed that she would like it to be known as simply part of the Reenactment.<br>
You and I are here to obey.<br>
<br>
Seemingly understanding, Kii quickly nodded and left the room.<br>
Musashi looked at a little girl sitting behind the curtain—particularly, at the treasure in her hands.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Minazuki：</span><br>
"Can what the Great Sage gave us really change the Sakura Empire's future...?"<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Musashi：</span><br>
Yes. I'd thought it a Wisdom Cube, but it displays wildly different characteristics.<br>
So far, there is little that I know about it.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Minazuki：</span><br>
"Hmm... What of Shinano?"<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Musashi：</span><br>
It seems she has inherited some of the Great Sage's dream powers...<br>
She cannot fully control them, making the boundary between dreams and reality fuzzy for her. This is why she hasn't woken up.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Minazuki：</span><br>
"Then let's move her to the Diadem of Light. It's far from our mainland, so that will keep her far from the trouble stirring here."<br>
"If Shinano wakes up... then offer her my blessings on my behalf."<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Musashi：</span><br>
Yes, gladly.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Minazuki：</span><br>
Mmnh... Lady Musashi? Is it already over...?<br>
Then I'm gonna go change clothes and go to bed...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Musashi：</span><br>
Of course. Make sure you brush your teeth first.<br>
Good night, Minazuki.<br>
What are you planning, exactly?<br>
...Yamato.<br>

<br>
The light fragrance of mugwort tickled her nose. Warm rays of sunshine caressed her cheek.<br>
In a world of comfort, Unzen awakened.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Unzen：</span><br>
Nnh...?<br>
<br>
Her mind was still a mess, and her eyes had yet to adjust to the bright light.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ibuki：</span><br>
Good morning, Unzen.<br>
<br>
Ibuki helped her sit up.<br>
It seemed she was in a Sakuran room, and a rather fancy one at that.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ibuki：</span><br>
Are you thirsty? Heheh, how would you like some mugwort tea?<br>
<br>
Ibuki handed her a cup of tea, just barely steaming. This was the source of the fragrance.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ibuki：</span><br>
Allow me to introduce myself properly. I'm Ibuki, and I've been tasked with taking care of you here in the sanctuary.<br>
<br>
Fragmented memories finally began to connect.<br>
Once the black mist had been sealed again, Unzen's body had begun to disintegrate.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ibuki：</span><br>
I'm so glad you're okay, Unzen.<br>
<br>
Out of joy, Ibuki sat on the bed and grasped Unzen's empty hand.<br>
The texture of her hand told Unzen that this wasn't a dream.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Unzen：</span><br>
Ibuki, where's Watatsumi...?<br>
<br>
The star fragment she'd given Musashi had once been the backbone of the seal, but now, it was believed to be powerless.<br>
While the seal was being repaired, the Prime Sakura had already begun to disappear. When Unzen looked outside now, she saw no trace of it.<br>
More precisely, what once had been the Prime Sakura had reverted into a sapling.<br>
A figure with a red parasol stood on the shore of the lake surrounded by pink crystals.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ibuki：</span><br>
Are you curious about the Prime Sakura?<br>
After we found you in the middle of the lake, a new tree started to grow where the roots of the Prime Sakura were.<br>
Heheh, Amagi goes to visit every day.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Unzen：</span><br>
Amagi? But I thought she already...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ibuki：</span><br>
About that... Well, it would be best if you asked her yourself.<br>
Oh, but you're still recovering, so don't push yourself too much.<br>
If you want to just take a light stroll, I can get your clothes ready for you. Would you like that?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Unzen：</span><br>
Yes, if you wouldn't mind.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ibuki：</span><br>
I'd be happy to, Unzen.<br>

<br>
Past Sakura Empire – Nagato's Abode<br>
Wanderlust would be an apt word.<br>
As the Commander of a fleet, it was common for me to travel to other places.<br>
I got many opportunities to travel all over the world and learn the customs of various lands.<br>
However, the responsibility on my shoulders made it difficult for me to relax and have fun.<br>
I open up the itinerary and check my plans for the day.<br>
A packed schedule, a whole mountain of notes left by my friends... It's enough to make me dizzy.<br>
But, I signed up for this, and I can't let something like this discourage me.<br>
Plus, I happen to have a little bit of free time before my next engagement.<br>
Maybe it would be a good idea to take a breather.<br>
Now that I think about it, the Sakuran tour guide showed me around various places and introduced me to quite a few shipgirls.<br>
We'd visited places together, tried all kinds of foods...<br>
Worked, sat through endless meetings...<br>
Looking back, I had to give speeches and manage the proceedings, so I was focused the whole time...<br>
Whoops. Can't let those kinds of thoughts get to me too much.<br>
I tidied up my clothes and made my way over to the dinner venue Nagato had invited me to.<br>
{{折叠面板|内容结束}}

{{折叠面板|标题=Moonlit Encounter, Part II|选项=33|主框=1|样式=primary|展开=是}}
<br>
The dinner party was in full swing.<br>
We were here to have a peaceful, friendly time together, but the party had gotten a bit rambunctious for my tastes.<br>
So, I came up with a reason to slip away from the venue to catch a breath of fresh air.<br>
Being out in the courtyard in the cool evening breeze was refreshing to say at the very least.<br>
I even decided to check out a little side trail.<br>
I walked around, slowly and aimlessly, under the moonlight.<br>
Certainly, much better than the stifling feeling of being inside.<br>
Just being there in the moment felt so peaceful for some reason, like I was liberated from all the stuff I constantly have to think about normally.<br>
.........<br>
I lost track of how long I had been walking for, and how many corners I had turned.<br>
But soon, the dark and narrow path opened up into an elegant courtyard.<br>
Everything there, from the architecture to the arrangement of the decorations to the landscape, seemed to have been placed deliberately and tastefully. The dim glow of a lantern gave it a delicate yet profound atmosphere.<br>
A calming, comforting scene.<br>
I took a few steps, and saw the moonlight reflecting off the surface of a little pond.<br>
And next to the gleaming water was a shipgirl clad in white.<br>
{{折叠面板|内容结束}}

{{折叠面板|标题=Moonlit Encounter, Part III|选项=34|主框=1|样式=primary|展开=是}}
<br>
She might be the owner of this place... Should I apologize for entering without permission?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">???：</span><br>
Did you find our cuisine satisfactory?<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Ahh, umm... I'd like to apologize for barging in first.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">???：</span><br>
No worries. The way here is rather jumbled to begin with.<br>
To pass through my barrier, you had to overcome the realm of possibility to arrive here.<br>
Hmm, perhaps I should say... that this is fate?<br>
<br>
She seemed to speak in riddles, as if pondering to herself.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">???：</span><br>
You look rather worn down by the banquet. My condolences.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Am I being that obvious about it?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">???：</span><br>
Well, that isn't all. You're different, in many ways.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
You're one to talk...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">???：</span><br>
Hmm... I wonder what makes you say that.<br>
<br>
A brief look of astonishment flashes across her delicate features.<br>
Then, our eyes met.<br>
I saw within them something akin to joy and loneliness.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
......<br>
<br>
Unexpectedly, I felt myself getting jittery and had to break eye contact first.<br>
She was a shipgirl, of course, but staring at each other too long might lead to misunderstandings.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
In any case...<br>
Are you waiting for someone here?<br>
<br>
It felt awkward just standing there in silence, so I tried changing the subject.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">???：</span><br>
...No, I was just lost in thought.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Really?<br>
If something's wrong, you can talk to me about it.<br>
<br>
It didn't take long for me to regret my thoughtless offer.<br>
This was my last day at the Sakura Empire. I was supposed to start packing after the dinner party.<br>
Despite my job and ability to travel, I didn't know when I'd meet her again.<br>
Add the war with the Sirens, and this might be the last time I'd ever see this stranger.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Oh, but if you're not in the mood to talk about it right now, we can another time.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">???：</span><br>
Another... time?<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
I'm kind of sating my wanderlust right now. It's just, you know, it'd be nice to meet again someday.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">???：</span><br>
Wanderlust...<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
People talk about once-in-a-lifetime encounters, and all, but we should always be optimistic where we can.<br>
I mean, look. I already slipped through your barrier and met you this time.<br>
<br>
This time, she was the one to turn away bashfully.<br>
Under the moonlight, the two of us gave ourselves up to the passage of time.<br>
Neither of us said a word, but we were comforted by this silent time together.<br>
Eventually, I told her that I'd best get back to the dinner party. When I turned around to do just that...<br>
She grabbed my hand and gestured with her eyes up to the moon in the sky.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">???：</span><br>
...The moon is lovely tonight, isn't it?<br>
<br>
Her beautiful, yet fleeting smile would be forever burned into my memory.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
......<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Essex：</span><br>
Commander?<br>
Commander, we're going to land soon.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Shangri-La：</span><br>
Essex? Why are you still here?<br>
If you want to attend Richelieu's ceremony at the Iris as an Eagle Union representative, you'll need to hurry and get ready.<br>
I prepared new clothes for you, so let's go change, okay?<br>
And Commander, I think you should get ready, too.<br>
<br>
My friends' voices faded along with their footsteps.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
......<br>
I've been steeped in nostalgic memories for a little too long.<br>
Today, I'll be in Europa...<br>
<br>
There was a loud rumbling, followed by calm. It seemed we'd landed without issue.<br>
I still had far too many plans today.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Things are going to be busy for a while...<br>
<br>
I closed my eyes, trying to squeeze out every moment of rest.<br>
The face of the woman I met that night, along with the scenery of that mysterious moonlit encounter, came to mind.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Yeah... I'm sure we'll meet again. Somewhere, someday.<br>
Great Sage of the Sakura Empire... Unzen.<br>
<br>
"One step closer are you to revealing the truth of this world."<br>
"While you have shed the penumbra of the past,"<br>
"The true darkness is yet to come."<br>
"Trees seek quietude, but the wind refuses to stop blowing."<br>
