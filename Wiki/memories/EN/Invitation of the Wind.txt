Invitation of the Wind<br>
<br>
1 Splendid Breeze<br>
On one fine, sunny day, Clemenceau invites me out to the golf course.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Clemenceau：</span><br>
The wind isn't too loud or too quiet. It's just right for golf.<br>
Both the wind speed and the soft sensation of the wind touching your cheeks are perfect.<br>
Even better, my dear Commander is by my side. Today is shaping up to be a good one.<br>
My, you look worried about something.<br>
Relax. Even if you're a poor golfer, I won't make fun of you.<br>
I'll patiently teach you all the ins and outs of the sport, okay? Heehee.<br>
Your stance looks great~ Did someone study ahead of time?<br>
But I wonder how well you practiced... this?<br>
Suddenly, Clemenceau circles behind me and massages my hands and shoulders while I hold the club.<br>
Your stance and grip are flawless, but...<br>
You shouldn't tense up so much before you swing.<br>
I feel Clemenceau's warmth through my back.<br>
Focus on the ball, not on me, okay?<br>
There. Raise your club, and prepare to hit the ball.<br>
Lean your upper body forward just slightly, bend your knees a tiny bit...<br>
Are you embarrassed? Don't be. I'm only getting handsy to right your posture, after all.<br>
Next, the shot itself. While you do need to put force behind your shoulders and arms, you also need to do so here...<br>
Clemenceau's fingers trace around my waist. She's looking awfully mischievous, for someone who's "just fixing my posture."<br>
Aww, you make such pitifully adorable noises... Heehee.<br>
Carefully maintain your balance, and hit the ball with a fast swing.<br>
Got it? Ready to give it a try?<br>
Let's see your hole-in-one.<br>
Clemenceau steps back, and I'm released from her warm touch.<br>
(Now...)<br>
<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项1：(Swing the club.)</span>'''''<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Clemenceau：</span><br>
...Nothing happens. The ball still sits proudly atop the tee.<br>
(I was so embarrassed that I missed my swing.)<br>
Hmm... You're still nervous, and it's making you tense up.<br>
Heheh, it looks like you'll need more of my guidance.<br>
We'd best get started, then.<br>
The day is still young... We have plenty of time together♪<br>
Clemenceau whispers into my ear, her warm touch against my back again.<br>

<br>
2 Shimmering Triangle Wave<br>
Awash in the morning sea breeze, I stroll along the beach.<br>
But I run into someone else who's already beat me to seeing the sights.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Helena：</span><br>
Ahh, the breeze is lovely...<br>
In a few days, the Commander and I...<br>
<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项1："Good morning, Helena."</span>'''''<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Helena：</span><br>
Good... morning?<br>
C-Commander?! Why are you here right now...?<br>
(SG, why didn't you tell me the Commander was coming?)<br>
(I'm not mentally prepared for this...!)<br>
"I have a lot of work to do today, so I woke up early..."<br>
W-well, you woke up too early.<br>
"Now that you mention it, I thought so, too."<br>
"But I didn't think too much of it. Instead, I just decided to come watch the sunrise."<br>
"Did you wake up early to see the sunrise, too, Helena?"<br>
Y-yeah... Maybe...<br>
(You wouldn't need to change into a swimsuit just to see the sunrise.)<br>
(The morning breeze is kind of chilly. I'm a little worried Helena will catch a cold out here in that swimsuit.)<br>
C-Commander? Are you interested in my swimsuit?<br>
"Of course I am. It looks really cute on you."<br>
Cute...<br>
(I would've liked it better if you said pretty, but...)<br>
(Oh, not that I hate to be called cute... O-of course, I don't want to force the Commander to say anything, so either is... Ummm...)<br>
"Of course, you're pretty, too."<br>
Oh... Thank you.<br>
The thing is, um, Commander...<br>
I didn't come to watch the sunrise.<br>
Do you remember our promise to go swimming in a few days?<br>
Umm, basically, I'll need to be in a swimsuit then...<br>
At first, I thought I'd be fine, but the thought of you seeing it...<br>
It's so embarrassing...<br>
So I decided to come to the beach wearing it in advance, as a kind of practice.<br>
I had no idea I'd run into you here...<br>
"Let me be honest. I'm so busy today because I want to get things done and make time for you."<br>
Wh-what a coincidence...<br>
"Now that we've run into each other here, it almost feels like a rehearsal for my day off."<br>
I don't know if this would be close enough to count...<br>
Achoo! Sorry... Commander, could you come a little closer?<br>
Close enough that I can feel your body heat...<br>
Hmm... Maybe this does feel like our day off, after all.<br>
The sun rising on the horizon dyes the sea gold.<br>
Her dazzling, joyful smile is the perfect complement for the shining sea ahead.<br>

3 Diving Under Blue Skies<br>
The light above grows brighter, informing us that we'll reach the surface soon.<br>
I gesture to my partner next to me and swim up to the surface.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Enterprise：</span><br>
Phew...! We're back on the water's surface!<br>
Commander, you look pale...<br>
I get it. If you're not used to diving, it's easy to get scared.<br>
I panicked a little when I started out, too.<br>
You're okay now, Commander. Look at the skies above, and see that you're safe.<br>
"Actually, Enterprise, I'm not worried about myself. Look down."<br>
Her diving suit has a big hole in the thigh.<br>
Oh, this?<br>
"I heard you yelp during our dive, so I decided to have us exit early."<br>
Heh, yeah, it was a surprise when I hit that rock.<br>
I felt better after I checked the damage, though.<br>
We weren't that deep, either. Just tearing my suit a little is no biggie.<br>
And see? I'm not even wounded.<br>
Don't believe me? Check it out for yourself.<br>
Enterprise swims closer to me.<br>
See, I'm just fine.<br>
I appreciate your concern, but it's not like I'm acting tough, or anything.<br>
Fortunately, Enterprise isn't hurt. All the scrape did was tear her wetsuit.<br>
Suddenly, I realize that she's gotten really close to me.<br>
It's normal to be this close mid-dive, but she doesn't care even when we're on the water's surface.<br>
Those colorful reefs, all the little sea creatures...<br>
It was just like a busy city, wasn't it?<br>
We think we know the sea well, because we're always fighting on it.<br>
Carrier-based craft might let us see beyond the horizon...<br>
But there's a whole other world hidden down there.<br>
Is this how our submarines feel when they fight?<br>
"It's a shame that only they get to see certain sights. You need special gear to descend that far."<br>
"Even mass-produced submarines wouldn't let us take a leisurely look around."<br>
...Yeah, you're right.<br>
Sitting in a windowless submarine, deep underwater...<br>
I'll pass. I'm built for fighting on the surface.<br>
Oh, sorry. I just can't stop talking about fighting.<br>
Here I'd promised that we'd relax together... So much for that, huh?<br>
Phew... Feel better now, Commander?<br>
That's enough of a break. Let's start our next dive, alright?<br>
"I have plenty of stamina and oxygen left, but what about your wetsuit?"<br>
...Now that you mention it, this is kind of a problem.<br>
Diving in a damaged wetsuit is against safety regulations.<br>
Let's go back to the coast, then.<br>
It doesn't matter if we're on the surface or underwater. Me, I can relax as long as you're here.<br>
What say you, Commander?<br>
"I feel the same, of course."<br>
Heheh. Let's find another way to enjoy the rest of our time together.<br>
The sights underwater may be pretty, but they don't beat the world above.<br>
Enterprise's smile is as clear as the blue sky. She offers me her hand—and I hold on tight.<br>
