<br>
1 The Lost Purse<br>
In order to strengthen the fleet's operational abilities, I decided to build another supply depot in port.<br>
While pacing around thinking about where to best build it, I saw a drawstring purse lying on the ground.<br>
I picked up the purse and shook it around, the ringing of coins coming from within. Who had dropped it?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Fusou：</span><br>
...<br>
Um, Milord...<br>
Oh! That's the purse I dropped earlier... Where did you find it?<br>
<br>
I handed the purse over to her, explaining that I had just found it on the side of the road.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Fusou：</span><br>
Oh, thank goodness... I was afraid it had fallen into a gutter.<br>
It is truly a blessing that the kindhearted commander was able to find it.<br>
Perhaps this is a sign that my daily prayers are being answered. Hehe~<br>
<br>
There's no way that dropping your purse could be considered good luck, right...?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Fusou：</span><br>
By the way, Milord, what are you doing all the way out here?<br>
...I see. You're looking for a place to build a new supply depot.<br>
There might be a plot of land spacious enough by the shrine that Yamashiro and I attend to.<br>
<br>
Hmm... Now that she mentioned it, I did recall seeing an empty plot of land around the shrine...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Fusou：</span><br>
I would be glad to show you around, should you wish me to.<br>
<br>
After seeing her gentle smile, there was no way I'd be able to turn down her generous offer.<br>

<br>
2 Shopping for Sweets<br>
Curiosity overtook me, and I asked Fusou what she had planned on doing with the money.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Fusou：</span><br>
Actually... I was headed to the store to buy some sweets for the girls who help out at the shrine every day.<br>
Would you like to accompany me, Milord?<br>
There's a shop just ahead that sells daifuki mochi stuffed richly with red bean paste.<br>
<br>
When we arrived at the shop, we ran into Michishio, who had come at about the same time as us.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Michishio：</span><br>
Oh, hi there, Commander~ And Miss Fusou as well! Did the two of you also come to buy some sweets?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Fusou：</span><br>
Indeed. I wanted to prepare a treat for everyone at the shrine... Oh, is there only one daifuku left?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Michishio：</span><br>
Ehh? You're also here for the daifuku?!<br>
Ugh... They're my favorite, but... I can't just put myself over all the girls helping out at the shrine...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Fusou：</span><br>
It's alright, Michishio. I'll just buy the ingredients for dango instead and make them by hand.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Michishio：</span><br>
Huh? S-seriously? Are you sure?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Fusou：</span><br>
Don't worry about it. Please enjoy your treats~<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Michishio：</span><br>
Thanks, Fusou, you're the best! Ahh, I love daifuku~♪<br>
<br>
Michishio happily bounced out of the store with the purchased daifuku in hand.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Fusou：</span><br>
...Very good. We have everything we need to prepare some dango.<br>
Milord, you're more than welcome to stop by if you'd like. As a special token of my appreciation for finding my purse...<br>
I'd be glad to feed you~<br>
<br>
I wasn't sure if Fusou was joking or not, but she was giggling lightheartedly.<br>

3 Bad At Writing Mail?<br>
The day after my shopping trip with Fusou, I received an e-mail.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Mail：</span><br>
"Any spare time?"<br>
<br>
That was the entire content of the message. I didn't recognize the sender... Almost immediately afterwards, I received the next message.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Mail：</span><br>
"Be there soon."<br>
<br>
Was someone supposed to be coming to the office? ...I still had no idea who the sender was, so I wrote a response asking for their name.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Mail：</span><br>
"In front of the fountain."<br>
"In the building."<br>
<br>
From the emails that were arriving in rapid succession, I could tell that the sender was gradually approaching.<br>
I started to wonder if I'd get a message that said "I'm right behind you" like in one of those scary movies. That's when I got another message.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Mail：</span><br>
"In front of you."<br>
<br>
As soon as I had read the message, someone knocked on the door to the office.<br>
I approached the door cautiously and opened it...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Fusou：</span><br>
...E-excuse me, Milord... I wanted to discuss the lot for the supply depot with you, but... typing is hard for me...<br>
I am still getting the hang of smartphones... I'm not sure why it keeps entering "Privacy Mode" when I'm sending e-mails though...<br>
I have always struggled to deal with electronic devices... Um, did something happen, Commander? You look relieved...<br>
<br>
Fusou looked at me with a quizzical expression.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Fusou：</span><br>
Um, in any case... I'd like to show you to the vacant lot. Would you happen to have time?<br>
You do, right? Please follow me then.<br>
<br>
I left the office and followed Fusou, feeling both relieved and a bit silly at the same time.<br>
For my sake, I really needed to teach her how to send e-mail.<br>

After the Flowers Bloomed<br>
<br>
4 Promise<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Fusou：</span><br>
"I am bringing Milord over to the vacant lot." Is that better, Milord?<br>
<br>
I gave Fusou some general tips while we headed towards the vacant lot, and at least she managed to write complete sentences.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Fusou：</span><br>
I shall go ahead and send this message to Yamashiro then. Mm, I think it went through. Probably.<br>
I am sorry that I inconvenienced you with my carelessness earlier, Milord.<br>
If there is anything I can do for you to make up for it...<br>
<br>
Fusou's words suddenly trailed off as she stopped and looked into the distance.<br>
I followed her gaze into the distance – In the mountains behind the shrine, cherry blossoms bloomed in profusion like a sea of pink clouds.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Fusou：</span><br>
By the way, this is the time of the year when the cherry blossoms come into full bloom.<br>
That's one of the best places to take a stroll. Being able to walk beneath the swirling cherry blossoms is a rare experience.<br>
<br>
Time seemed to fly as we talked, and we soon arrived at the empty lot. The torii gates marking the entrance of the shrine were just a stone's throw away.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Fusou：</span><br>
Is this place suitable for the depot you wished to build?<br>
<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项1："Mm... It's not bad."</span>'''''<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项2："We're going to be neighbors."</span>'''''<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Fusou：</span><br>
If the location is suitable, then let us hold a prayer so that the construction may be completed safely.<br>
And, um, Milord, if you'd like...<br>
After we finish the ritual, would you like to head to the mountains together to see the cherry blossoms?<br>
<br>
I wasn't expecting the sudden date invitiation... but excitement crept through me and I could only nod slowly.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Fusou：</span><br>
Ehehe, thank you. I'll bring your dango at that time then.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ryuuhou：</span><br>
Oh, it's you, Commander. And Fusou as well, huh?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Fusou：</span><br>
Good day, Ryuuhou. Did you come to help out at the shrine today?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ryuuhou：</span><br>
That I did. By the way, what are the two of you doing at this empty lot...<br>
<br>
*ring* *ring* *ring*<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Fusou：</span><br>
Eep!<br>
<br>
Fusou suddenly clung to me, perhaps surprised by the sudden noise from my phone.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Fusou：</span><br>
I-I'm so sorry, Milord, I'm not sure what came over me...<br>
That really scared me... I keep getting reminded that I'm not good with electronic devices...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ryuuhou：</span><br>
Um, Fusou... I think you should consider unhanding the commander soon...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Fusou：</span><br>
Huh? Ah, um... I'm really sorry for clinging to you...<br>
<br>
Fusou, whose body had been closely stuck to mine, started to pull away gently. It seemed as if her ears were red.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Fusou：</span><br>
In any case, Milord, we will hold our ceremony tomorrow. I hope to see you there.<br>
<br>
With those words, Fusou passed through the torii gate with Ryuuhou.<br>
I wanted the moment to last a bit longer, but all I could think about was getting to see her again tomorrow.<br>

<br>
5 Smiling Faces<br>
The next day, I headed out for the vacant lot again. The ritual was about to begin.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Fusou：</span><br>
Milord, Harutsuki and Yoizuki will be carrying out the ceremony. Please watch them from here.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Harutsuki：</span><br>
(Gods, please watch over me...)<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Yoizuki：</span><br>
Harutsuki, you won't be able to wave your staff around properly if you keep your eyes shut.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Fusou：</span><br>
...I see that Harutsuki has yet to overcome her nerves.<br>
I know she's more than capable of following what I taught her, it's just a matter of getting her to calm down... And that will take time and experience.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Harutsuki：</span><br>
Ah, um... Next, bow twice... Wait, huh? Was it, two or three...?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Yoizuki：</span><br>
What's with you, Harutsuki? Get back here already.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Harutsuki：</span><br>
Y-Yoizuki... I can't seem to remember... What do I dooo?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Yoizuki：</span><br>
...Bow twice, then clap twice. Then one final bow.<br>
<br>
In the end, Harutsuki managed to get through the ritual with Yoizuki's help.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Fusou：</span><br>
Well done, you two. Please rest while I prepare the tea.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Harutsuki：</span><br>
Ugh... I botched the whole thing...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Fusou：</span><br>
That's not true. You did commendably for your first time, and the ritual was completed just fine.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Harutsuki：</span><br>
B-but...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Fusou：</span><br>
Besides, take a look at your tea~<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Harutsuki：</span><br>
Ah! The tea stalk is floating upright!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Fusou：</span><br>
The gods are pleased by your efforts, and this auspicious omen is proof of that~<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Harutsuki：</span><br>
How grateful I am to thee, O Great Gods!<br>
Um, is it okay for me to show this to Yamashiro?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Fusou：</span><br>
Of course.<br>
<br>
After seeing off the reinvigorated Harutsuki, Fusou turned back towards me.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Fusou：</span><br>
About that... Of course, I prepared it so that Harutsuki would feel better.<br>
Besides, it's an undeniable fact that she gave it her all to carry out this ritual. More important is that she gains the confidence to succeed next time.<br>
An act of kindness, you say? Hehe. I'm happy as long as I can see a smile on everyone's faces.<br>
<br>
I could tell that Fusou genuinely believed this from the bottom of her heart. Her kindness was reflected upon her gentle expression.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Fusou：</span><br>
Now that the ritual is over, are you still in the mood for our little tour tomorrow?<br>
<br>
Just as Fusou opened her mouth, I heard the roar of thunder from the sky.<br>
When I looked towards the sky, the sun was beginning to be covered with dark clouds.<br>

6 Rain of Disappointment<br>
Port - Office<br>
Come evening, the port had been completely engulfed by a storm. Rain pelted down rhythmically against the office's windows.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Fusou：</span><br>
At this rate, I'm not sure we'll be able to go on our trip tomorrow...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Mogami：</span><br>
Coming through, Commander~<br>
<br>
I heard the sound of knocking at the office's doors, and Mogami soon let herself in.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Mogami：</span><br>
I've printed out the current weather map. Apparently, the storm's going to be sitting right over the port for the next few days.<br>
…………<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Fusou：</span><br>
What's wrong, Mogami?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Mogami：</span><br>
Maybe this ended up happening because I went to look up the data...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Fusou：</span><br>
There's no way you had anything to do with this. Besides, this data is very helpful for us. Thank you, Mogami.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Mogami：</span><br>
{namecode:78}……<br>
Um, is it okay if I stop by the shrine next time?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Fusou：</span><br>
Mm, if you'd like. Though, I don't think it's really necessary.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Mogami：</span><br>
I see. Well, I wanted to at least get it out there. Sorry for taking up your time then. Wouldn't want to keep Mikuma waiting.<br>
<br>
After Mogami left, Fusou exhaled as if something was weighing heavily upon her.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Fusou：</span><br>
Do you think that... all the cherry blossoms are going to get scattered by this storm?<br>
I've never missed my prayers or broken my strict practices, and yet... misfortunes continue to befall me...<br>
If only I wasn't so unlucky...<br>
<br>
Before she finished her words, Fusou shook her head around vigorously and smiled as if warding off her anxiety.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Fusou：</span><br>
Right, I was supposed to finish making those dango. They'd go great with this tea.<br>
I originally intended to share them with Harutsuki and the others, but you can help yourself if you'd like.<br>
Here, open your mouth. Say "ahhn"~<br>
<br>
Though caught off guard by Fusou's embarrassing request, I opened my mouth obediently and chewed on the tasty dango as instructed.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Fusou：</span><br>
Hehe... Even though we weren't able to view the cherry blossoms together, just being able to have this moment together is enough for me...<br>
Maybe I truly am blessed after all...<br>
<br>
I thought I heard a quiver in her voice, but it might have just been the timbre of the rain coming down around us.<br>

<br>
7 A Small Blessing<br>
A few days after the storm passed...<br>
As expected, all the cherry blossoms had been ripped from the branches, muddied and strewn across the ground.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ryuuhou：</span><br>
Commander, will you be staying here today as well?<br>
Fusou is currently away from the shrine on official duties. Would you like to wait for her?<br>
<br>
I told Ryuuhou that I'd come back later, and went by myself to the trail where Fusou and I were supposed to go on our date.<br>
The cherry grove had been hit just as hard as the trail leading to it. The road was covered with broken branches and twigs.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Yoizuki：</span><br>
Commander, what are you doing at a place like this?<br>
As you can see, this trail is now closed to visitors. I'm cleaning up around here, so maybe you can come back next time.<br>
...Hm? Sure, you can have the cherry tree branch, but what for?<br>
<br>
An idea came to mind as I looked over the cherry tree branch in my hand, and I rushed back towards the office.<br>
Days later...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Fusou：</span><br>
(I've been too embarrassed to face the commander, but I never expected to be summoned by e-mail...)<br>
(We haven't seen each other since the day of the storm, but... I can't keep moping about it forever.)<br>
Excuse me, Milord...<br>
<br>
Fusou quietly slipped into the office after knocking.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Fusou：</span><br>
Milord, I apologize for not being present sooner. The mission took a bit longer than expected...<br>
That vase... Commander, are those cherry tree branches?<br>
<br>
Fusou stared blankly at the branches I had stuck into the vase.<br>
While cleaning, Yoizuki had found some branches with buds that had not yet bloomed.<br>
I figured that if I watered them quickly enough, there was a chance that they might still bloom. My bet had paid off, and fresh cherry blossoms were now gracing the office.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Fusou：</span><br>
Did you... do all this for me?<br>
You knew how much I wanted to go see the cherry blossoms...<br>
<br>
Fusou clutched her chest, her eyes fixated on the beautiful cherry blossoms.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Fusou：</span><br>
I have no words to express my gratitude, Milord...<br>
I never thought I'd feel this much happiness...<br>
Even if I am unlucky, the time I spend with you is like a bunch of small blessings...<br>
And that alone makes me realize... that I must be more lucky than anyone else.<br>
<br>
I reached out and took Fusou's hands, unable to look away from her gentle, moist eyes.<br>
Whatever misfortunes awaited us in the future, I still wanted to see Fusou smile, rain or shine.<br>
Every little moment of happiness, no matter how insignificant... I wanted to share it all with her.<br>
