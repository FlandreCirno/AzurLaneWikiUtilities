In an infinite cycle of rebirth, time has lost its meaning.<br>
Where the probable and improbable collide,<br>
all ephemerals are swept up in flames...<br>
 <br>
If it wasn't for that lone encounter,<br>
might there be an alternate ending.<br>
Is that you, my Creator?<br>
if I may so ask?<br>
O, my Creator?<br>

The storm is too strong! We'll be annihilated if we try to ride it out!<br>
We're committed now, we can't just give up! Trust me, we will break through this storm soon enough!<br>
Unknown enemy detected, bearing 150 degrees! Initiate evasive maneuvers...<br>
An unknown enemy, in a storm like this? Tell me its coordinates!<br>
......<br>
Answer me, Shoukaku! What are its coordinates?!<br>
......<br>
......<br>
... Get... out of… here…<br>
Crap, we're losing radio contact... This isn't looking good...<br>
Damn it... I still haven't had the chance to fight the Grey Ghost...<br>
... Wait, what's...? What's that light...?<br>
Oh god!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">{namecode:96}：</span><br>
......<br>
... Where... am I?<br>
Hey... I'm still in one piece! I made it!<br>
Ow! My head hurts, though... And I don't remember what happened...<br>
Damn... I can't radio Shoukaku... Now things really aren't looking good...<br>
......<br>
No, get it together! I finally made it, after all...<br>
I made it here! To the Sanctuary!<br>

What a sight to behold... The sea is entirely encompassed by the storm...<br>
This looks like a graveyard for those who sought out the Sanctuary... Had I not been so lucky, this would have been my final resting place, too...<br>
... Anyway, I need to establish radio contact with Shoukaku. This place is giving me the creeps...<br>

<span style="color:#4eb24e;">{namecode:96}：</span><br>
Is that you, Akatsuki?! Good timing! I was worried about you ever since we got separated in the storm, but I'm glad to see you're okay!<br>
Help me finish off these mindless drones so we can talk!<br>

Hmph. So the 5th Carrier Division is on our tail.<br>
That idiot has taken the bait. All systems normal.<br>
The Sanctuary system check returned normal values. I suppose there is nothing to worry about.<br>
Ah, the little one from the 5th Carrier Division? So persistent, yet so naïve...<br>
Those who dare oppose the Creator shall pay for their ignorance with their lives.<br>
Let's give them a little surprise. This is a perfect opportunity to test the new weapon the Creator gave us...<br>
Those who dare stand between the Creator and me must be punished...<br>

Dammit, one imposter after the next... If only I hadn't lost so many planes to that storm...<br>
Huh? Is that a distress signal...? It could be Shoukaku!<br>
Wait for me, sis! I won't lose you again...!<br>

Sis, check it out! This is the key to the Sanctuary!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">{namecode:95}：</span><br>
The key... But how did you find it?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">{namecode:96}：</span><br>
Heheh, that would be thanks to Akatsuki's intel! Surely you believe me this time, right?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">{namecode:95}：</span><br>
If it really is the key, then we have to act now... Have everyone mobilize immediately!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">{namecode:96}：</span><br>
This time we'll expose their plan for what it really is!<br>
Now that I think about it, maybe this trap was also part of their plan...<br>
Damn...! They tricked us, again!<br>

I can't let you go any further, Zuikaku!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">{namecode:96}：</span><br>
Yamashiro?! Surely they didn't get to you, too...<br>
<span style="color:#ff0000;">{namecode:132}：</span><br>
Of course not! I am who I've always been! I'm Yamashiro!<br>
I'm here because I was ordered to prevent you from causing any ruckus in the Sanctuary...<br>
So... could you please lay down your arms and surrender? Pretty please!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">{namecode:96}：</span><br>
If you really are who you claim to be, then tell me: where is Shoukaku?<br>
<span style="color:#ff0000;">{namecode:132}：</span><br>
You'll have to defeat me if you want to know!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">{namecode:96}：</span><br>
... This is ridiculous! Why do all my superiors have to be such a pain to deal with?!<br>
Fine, have it your way! If a battle is what it takes to get an answer, then a battle it is!<br>
<span style="color:#ff0000;">{namecode:132}：</span><br>
I have to warn you: when I was being retrofitted, they installed some weird equipment on me... Apparently, I'm now an aviation battleship!<br>
They worked hard on it, and I'm really, really strong now! I can even launch aircr- Ow, that hurt! Please let me finish before you start attacking!<br>

... You were holding back, weren't you?<br>
<span style="color:#ff0000;">{namecode:132}：</span><br>
N-no I wasn't! And I'm not going to tell you that they locked Shoukaku away within the deepest part of the Sanctuary! It's super secret!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">{namecode:96}：</span><br>
Thanks. I'll be taking my leave now.<br>

Our brave little bird seems to be heading to the Sculpture Room. How annoying...<br>
How many times must they meddle in things that aren't their concern? Why do they not realize the magnificence of the Creator's plans?<br>
......<br>
My sister, please, control yourself. As long as the Original does not awaken, all will be well. Sculpting it should not take long.<br>
Then let's send out a rabbit to stall the little bird. She's been waiting for her tea party long enough...<br>
Let's send that child over there to stall her.<br>

Sorry, Nowaki, I don't have time to play games. Shoukaku's in danger, so I want to finish this quick.<br>

You're strong... but I'm also strong...<br>
I've fought carriers before... I can do this... probably...<br>

<span style="color:#4eb24e;">{namecode:96}：</span><br>
You are lucky. You just picked a bad opponent.<br>
... Now tell me everything you know.<br>
<span style="color:#ff0000;">{namecode:24}：</span><br>
Well, I got lost and wandered into this place... then I met some strange people.<br>
They've been researching the technology their "Creator" gave them in hopes of turning the tide of war around...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">{namecode:96}：</span><br>
That's just as the intel said. Looks like they weren't lying after all.<br>
Come with me, Nowaki. I need to save Shoukaku, and the more support I have, the better.<br>
<span style="color:#ff0000;">{namecode:24}：</span><br>
But I can't go against their will...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">{namecode:96}：</span><br>
Even if this "Creator" of theirs is nothing but a lie?<br>
<span style="color:#ff0000;">{namecode:24}：</span><br>
They gave us hope... Even if I'm going down the wrong path, I can't...<br>

I see... Good luck, then.<br>

All planes, take off! Target the enemy carrier: Lexington!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">{namecode:95}：</span><br>
You should leave some planes behind! Don't underestimate the enemy!<br>

H-how can that be?!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">{namecode:95}：</span><br>
Go take cover in the storm! I'll draw the enemy's attention!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">{namecode:96}：</span><br>
But sis...!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">{namecode:95}：</span><br>
There's no time! We've already lost Shouhou, we can't afford to lose more people!<br>
I will always protect you. But next time, don't underestimate the enemy...<br>

Not you too...<br>
... Why are you doing this?<br>
<span style="color:#ff0000;">{namecode:91}：</span><br>
An exquisite sacrifice is needed so that the Creator will continue gracing us with his blessings.<br>
<span style="color:#ff0000;">{namecode:92}：</span><br>
This is all for the sake of the Sakura Empire's future.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">{namecode:96}：</span><br>
... "The Sakura Empire's future"... How many times do you think you can fool people with those words?!<br>
And it doesn't stop at lying! Now you've dragged our people in your twisted experiments!<br>
That cursed power is no gift from the gods! It won't deliver us our future!<br>
I knew it... I knew all along that what you two were doing was crazy.<br>
And by forcing my sister into your dirty little schemes, you've made me really, REALLY mad!<br>
<span style="color:#ff0000;">{namecode:91}：</span><br>
*Giggle*~ Have you thought about how you're going to defeat the enemy in front of you?<br>
We've already offered her soul to the Creator. And now we will turn you into an empty husk as well!<br>

Sis, you're...<br>
<span style="color:#ff0000;">{namecode:92}：</span><br>
The Pawn defied us? How?!<br>
<span style="color:#ff0000;">{namecode:91}：</span><br>
She saved her sister from danger. Interesting...<br>
(So even a Pawn will rush to protect those they love...)<br>
<span style="color:#ff0000;">{namecode:92}：</span><br>
This must be an Awakening Response... Brought on by remembering something important from the depths of her mind at just the right time...<br>
<span style="color:#ff0000;">{namecode:91}：</span><br>
Kaga, let's retreat. Our priority right now is to report to the Creator that a Pawn has Awakened.<br>
<span style="color:#ff0000;">{namecode:92}：</span><br>
Understood.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">{namecode:96}：</span><br>

Argh... is that you... Zuikaku?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">{namecode:96}：</span><br>
Sis?! Yeah, it's me! But more importantly, what did Akagi do to you?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">{namecode:95}：</span><br>
I don't know... It... it feels like I just woke up from a long dream.<br>
And don't worry, I feel fine.<br>
In fact, I should apologize. For making you worry about your fool of a big sister.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">{namecode:96}：</span><br>
Sis... I'm sorry... I haven't matured one bit... I'm still so reckless and shortsighted...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">{namecode:95}：</span><br>
As long as you're safe and well, there is still hope... You are the only one who can defeat the enemy that is upon us...<br>
I will always be by your side... always protecting you...<br>
Always look forward, confidently... and stay true to our goals...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">{namecode:96}：</span><br>

My sister, everything in this world has its cause and effect. We must always look for another possibility through this infinite cycle of death and rebirth...<br>
That is why we conduct experiments in this Sanctuary.<br>
One day you will understand the reason why we do what we do...<br>
May all the gods watch over you...<br>
<span style="color:#ff0000;">Tester：</span><br>
The simulation at Test Site Gamma has concluded.<br>
<span style="color:#ff0000;">Observer：</span><br>
Hm? Let me see... Test Site Gamma...? Oh, that insignificant zoo of a test site...<br>
Well, this is interesting. The copy created in the Sculpture Room experienced what looks like an Awakening.<br>
<span style="color:#ff0000;">Tester：</span><br>
Yes, that one. Hmm, "resists attempts at control and unleashes latent power to save her friends"... This is beyond our expectations.<br>
<span style="color:#ff0000;">Observer：</span><br>
Interesting... By deviating from their predetermined destiny, they've managed to break free from the shackles of fate... I thought we were in control of everything, but perhaps that was all a lie...<br>
In either case, the question is if this is a true Awakening. It doesn't meet the right conditions.<br>
<span style="color:#ff0000;">Tester：</span><br>
Who knows. Ultimately, these intangible "emotions" are nothing more than electric signals in their processing centers.<br>
Nevertheless, this is superb data. It seems the Creator has taken a liking to these girls.<br>
<span style="color:#ff0000;">Observer：</span><br>
Hmph! It's no more than the Creator's way of playing a joke on us.<br>
<span style="color:#ff0000;">Tester：</span><br>
The data shows... they need more experience. At the very least... we can't let them face each other yet.<br>
<span style="color:#ff0000;">Observer：</span><br>
Resetting all Pawns. Clearing all data. Increasing all parameters by 5%... Releasing the key... And so, the next round of testing begins...<br>
