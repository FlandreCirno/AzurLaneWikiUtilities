SOS received from the Floating Fortress.<br>
Support fleet assembly in progress.<br>
Designated Flagship: KMS Bismarck<br>
Some time after the defeat of the high-level Siren program, Compiler...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">U-556：</span><br>
Correct heading, clear visibility... But looks like we have some rough weather on the horizon.<br>
But that's nothing you and I can't overcome, Lord Bismarck!<br>
Heehee... You know, I'm so glad I get to sortie with you once more.<br>
I can't wait to get out there and do some good work!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Bismarck：</span><br>
Just don't be reckless. Both of us might be a bit rusty after all this time.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">U-556：</span><br>
Got it. I'll be careful!<br>
Because if I go down, who else is gonna cover you?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Bismarck：</span><br>
Heh, that's true. You are my steadfast little Parzival, after all.<br>
I'll be careful as well.<br>
Not everyone has the fortune of getting a second chance like me.<br>
I've already had my fair share of tempting fate... and there are so many people counting on me.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">U-556：</span><br>
Lord Bismarck...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Bismarck：</span><br>
Forgive me for bringing up such a heavy topic.<br>
I'll make it up to you by taking you to a concert after we get back.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">U-556：</span><br>
No, no, I'm fine. All that matters is that you're safe and sound, Lord Bismarck.<br>
And I swear, I'll lay down my life for you if anyone tries to hurt you ever again!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Bismarck：</span><br>
Haha. You're too diligent for your own good, but I appreciate it.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">U-556：</span><br>
Alrighty then, I'll scout ahead for now! Please follow my lead!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Bismarck：</span><br>
(You've already more than fulfilled your promise, my friend. This time, I'll be the one to protect you...)<br>
(I'll use my new strength to that end...)<br>
<br>
U-556 sailed ahead of her eagerly, sometimes looking around, other times dipping into the ocean before leaping out like a dolphin.<br>
This small girl had once ferried her corrupted hull away from the brink of destruction.<br>
She followed behind her friend's frolicking figure, inexplicable feelings swirling around her chest.<br>
<span style="color:#ffd000;">Queen Elizabeth：</span><br>
...What's this? An urgent message?<br>
It's from Scapa Flow. The gate is acting up, it seems.<br>
I must see what's wrong with it. It's time we said goodbye for today.<br>
In the meantime, don't use the Tower of Midgard under any circumstances. Is that clear?<br>
The very world depends on it. Goodbye.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Bismarck：</span><br>
(Our teleporter began to act up around the same time the Royal Navy's did...)<br>
(Worse yet, we've lost all contact with the Floating Fortress that houses it at around the same time the Royal Navy reported their issues.)<br>
(The possibility of a Siren attack is high, but with Peter Strasser and Ulrich von Hutten stationed there, combat prowess should be the least of our concerns.)<br>
(One thing is clear– we can't afford to let our guard down.)<br>
(If they have the capacity to launch a multi-pronged attack like this... we may well be dealing with a META or Ashes enemy.)<br>
(Whatever the case, time is of the essence.)<br>
<br>
Fortress Support Fleet - Rendezvous point<br>
Dark clouds covered the seas, with distant thunder rumbling now and then.<br>
Amidst the rain, two girls made their way to the rendezvous point to meet with Bismarck.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Jade：</span><br>
What terrible weather... How am I supposed to scout anything out with this awful visibility?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Otto von Alvensleben：</span><br>
Just deal with it. You can't exactly reschedule for better weather when there's an emergency.<br>
It'd take too long to send a fleet from back home, so we're the only ones who can respond in time, along with Bismarck herself.<br>
You're not going to let a little storm get in the way of your duties, are you?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Jade：</span><br>
It's not the rain I'm concerned about. You know how high-ranking Sirens and abnormal weather tend to go hand-in-hand.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Otto von Alvensleben：</span><br>
Sure, but what are you afraid of? We already took down Compiler.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Jade：</span><br>
That's ONE. How many more are out there? Purifier and Omitter, just to name a couple.<br>
...Hold on, I'm seeing a strange silhouette to our twelve.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Otto von Alvensleben：</span><br>
H-huh?! It's not a Siren, is it?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Jade：</span><br>
Long hair, big guns, and rigging that looks like it has a life of its own...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Otto von Alvensleben：</span><br>
PLEASE tell me one of our colleagues forgot to RSVP, and that's not a Purifier right ahead of us...<br>
Ugh! Let's get out of here for the time being, and apologize to Bismarck later.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Jade：</span><br>
It miiiight be a tad late for that. Look, it's approaching us at high speed~<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Otto von Alvensleben：</span><br>
Dammit... Then, then... Make a break for it while I cover you!<br>
Get some backup while I keep the elite at bay!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Jade：</span><br>
...Huh?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Otto von Alvensleben：</span><br>
Aircraft carriers are more important to the Iron Blood fleet than destroyers, so... You have to get out of here safely!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Jade：</span><br>
Wait, sorry, I took the joke too far... I was just kidding!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Otto von Alvensleben：</span><br>
Look, you don't have to console me. I've already come to terms with my greater purpose...<br>
I'll hold 'em back. You go and tell Bismarck–<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Jade：</span><br>
Would you stop and use your eyes? They're an ally!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Otto von Alvensleben：</span><br>
Horns, long hair, and a wing-like cape...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Regensburg：</span><br>
...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Otto von Alvensleben：</span><br>
Oh, uhh... During the mission briefings... There was something about meeting up with a "rigging tamer," right?<br>
Wait, were they talking about Regensburg?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Jade：</span><br>
Now you're finally using your head.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Otto von Alvensleben：</span><br>
What the hell! Why didn't you say anything earlier?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Jade：</span><br>
I mean, you had the right answer... before your mind went on a magical journey, anyway.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Regensburg：</span><br>
...What's the matter with you two?<br>
Frightened by my Regina? Upset stomachs, perhaps?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Otto von Alvensleben：</span><br>
It's... nothing. We've been waiting for you.<br>
You okay? Encounter anything on the way here?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Regensburg：</span><br>
A handful of stray Sirens. They made a decent meal for my Regina.<br>
Where's Bismarck? Has she not arrived yet?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Otto von Alvensleben：</span><br>
More like, we haven't. We're not at the rendezvous point just yet.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Regensburg：</span><br>
Then what are we standing around for? Chop-chop!<br>
I've waited long enough to fight side by side with Bismarck as it is!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Jade：</span><br>
Yes, yes, whatever you say...<br>
Okay, I get it! Stop pushing me!<br>
<br>
"Friedrich, how are you feeling?"<br>
"The performers have gathered, and I am ready to conduct."<br>
"I'll ask you one last time– are you sure about this?"<br>
"Of course. For power to serve as a deterrent, it must be displayed."<br>
"The symphony must be played to its conclusion."<br>
"Very well. Carry out the plan then."<br>
"We're ready when you are, Enterprise."<br>
"Good."<br>
"Begin the mission."<br>

<br>
Mirror Sea - α phase<br>
The sound of waves roused her consciousness. From the darkness, her hazy eyes slowly came into focus.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ulrich von Hutten：</span><br>
Where... am I?<br>
<br>
Nearby, the teleporter connecting the Floating Fortress to the Tower of Midgard hummed with an eerie light.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ulrich von Hutten：</span><br>
The Tower of Midgard has been... activated?<br>
<br>
She rose to her feet and looked around. There was nobody there– only an empty sea that seemed to stretch on forever.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ulrich von Hutten：</span><br>
(I should be in the Floating Fortress right now...)<br>
(Is this another daydream? But it feels so real...)<br>
<br>
Her memory was a mess, and her recurring nightmares made her very thoughts feel unreliable.<br>
Her physical body had also been wracked by bouts of lethargy, blurring the lines between dream and reality even further.<br>
But, as she reached down, brushing her fingertips through the water swirling around her feet...<br>
She felt an icy-cold reality that did not pass right through her fingers.<br>
The massive construct near her pulsed with a hypnotic light, as if calling to her...<br>
And she chose to answer it.<br>
Just as the spinning sensation in her head was starting to subside, a burst of light from the Tower of Midgard illuminated the world around her.<br>
It was as if sky and sea had swapped places, the lucent surface at her feet shimmering more brilliantly than the stars.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ulrich von Hutten：</span><br>
Is this the same place... only turned upside-down?<br>
Hah, guess that settles it. Another damn dream.<br>
<br>
In the distance were strange cube-like objects rising from the sea, casting long shadows in every direction.<br>
Her eyes were drawn to the Tower of Midgard – it was working, but not as normal.<br>
The column of blue light surging from it ascended straight into the sky, like a lighthouse guiding the lost.<br>
Following its call, Ulrich activated her rigging and started to make her way towards the light.<br>

<br>
Floating Fortress - Main entrance<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Jade：</span><br>
I can't see a thing, but that must mean we're in the right place.<br>
If we COULD see the Fortress, its cloaking device wouldn't be working.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Otto von Alvensleben：</span><br>
Don't you think it's odd, though? That no one has come out to meet us?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">U-556：</span><br>
Yeah! Lord Bismarck is here, and that warrants a royal welcome!<br>
Something must be seriously wrong here!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Regensburg：</span><br>
Yet, the SOS signal wasn't jammed, nor do I see any signs of a Siren attack.<br>
But we aren't getting any responses to our calls either. Whatever happened, it must've taken place from the inside.<br>
We won't learn anything else without going in ourselves. Shall we, Bismarck?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Bismarck：</span><br>
Wait. This route is too dangerous to use.<br>
I know another way in for emergencies. Come with me.<br>
<br>
Floating Fortress - Inner complex<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Jade：</span><br>
...My, my. We have quite the situation on our hands.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Otto von Alvensleben：</span><br>
The whole sky's turned purple! If that isn't ominous, I don't know what is!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">U-556：</span><br>
It wasn't like this the last time I was here!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Regensburg：</span><br>
At least there wasn't a Siren ambush party waiting for us.<br>
Bismarck, all the equipment still seems operational. It's not a mechanical issue.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Otto von Alvensleben：</span><br>
...So where are all the people who're supposed to be here?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Bismarck：</span><br>
That's what we're here to find out.<br>
First of all, let's head to the control center and enable the defenses.<br>
After that, we'll check the data logs. There's bound to be something on them.<br>
U-556, take my access card and investigate all the security checkpoints along the way.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">U-556：</span><br>
Roger-roger!<br>
<br>
Floating Fortress - Security gate A1<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Automated System：</span><br>
User credentials verified. Welcome back, Bismarck.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Bismarck Zwei：</span><br>
Run a self-diagnostic.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Automated System：</span><br>
Running self-diagnostic...<br>
Inner Structure: Secure. Fortress Perimeter: Secure. Fortress Server Array: Secure.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">U-556：</span><br>
Whew... This stuff seems so futuristic, no matter how many times I see it~<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Bismarck Zwei：</span><br>
It sure is. Now let's go.<br>
<br>
Bismarck brought her fleet through a long corridor and several security gates, arriving at the control center.<br>
The lights were on, as they should be, and big computer screens were still relaying information from all sectors of the Fortress.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Prinz Heinrich：</span><br>
Zzzzz...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Otto von Alvensleben：</span><br>
Hmm? Is that Prinz Heinrich?<br>
What are you doing sleeping on the floor?<br>
Hello? Hellooo! Wake up!<br>
WAAAAKE UUUUP!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Prinz Heinrich：</span><br>
Zzzzz...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Jade：</span><br>
She's out cold... I heard before that she's a deep sleeper, but this is totally ridiculous...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">U-556：</span><br>
This can't be regular sleep! She's gotta be in a coma or something!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Regensburg：</span><br>
Without a doubt. Something isn't right here.<br>
Look at Adalbert over here. She's not waking up either.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Bismarck：</span><br>
No wonder our calls have gone unanswered.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Jade：</span><br>
Shall we slap them around a bit and see if that works?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Bismarck：</span><br>
No. It's a bad idea to try to wake them before we know what made them unconscious to begin with.<br>
I suspect these two aren't the only ones either. Let's split up and check on the others.<br>
If you find anyone else, bring them to the sickbay.<br>
Report to me at once if you start to feel unwell at all.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Everyone：</span><br>
Roger!<br>
<br>
Bismarck took a seat in front of a computer and monitored the Fortress' facilities.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Bismarck：</span><br>
Almost everyone has been found and brought to the sickbay. We're just missing three people–<br>
Gneisenau META, Ulrich, and Zuikaku. Everyone else is in a coma still.<br>
In addition, the Tower of Midgard has been activated for some reason... Elizabeth, how did you foresee this?<br>
<br>
She entered two commands into the control system terminal and executed them–<br>
First, raise the Fortress' security level to maximum. Second, activate all defense systems.<br>
The screens around the control center showed the Fortress' various defense weapons coming to life one after another.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Bismarck：</span><br>
This will buy us some time.<br>
Now, let's check on the Tower itself...<br>
<br>
As she scrolled through the central system's data logs, a set of entries highlighted in red caught her attention.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Bismarck：</span><br>
There are TWO records of it having been used recently?<br>
Both point to the same destination, but someone scrambled the coordinates...<br>
Who could have done this?<br>
<br>
She tried diverting computing resources towards deciphering the coordinates. However...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Bismarck：</span><br>
I can't unscramble them, but the gate should still be tethered to the same place.<br>
There's a good chance I'll find Ulrich on the other side, even if we don't know where it leads.<br>
But there's also a good chance that it's a trap. So what do I do...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">U-556：</span><br>
Lord Bismarck! We've brought everybody we found down to the sickbay!<br>
But, we still haven't found Gneisenau META, Ulrich, or Zuikaku, and we've already searched this place from top to bottom!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Bismarck：</span><br>
It's okay. I doubt you'll find them here.<br>
Tell everyone to get ready and gather at the Tower of Midgard.<br>
I'll meet up with you in a bit. I need to check on the wounded in the sickbay first.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Regensburg：</span><br>
At the tower? You've already figured out where they went?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Bismarck：</span><br>
More or less, I suppose.<br>
I've raised the Fortress' security level to maximum. Our mass-produced ships will hopefully keep the incapacitated safe.<br>
They'll have to, because we...<br>
We're going to use the gate and rescue our missing friends.<br>

<br>
Mirror Sea - α phase<br>
In a place where time and space seemed to blur together, only the brightly-shining Tower of Midgard provided any sense of direction.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Zuikaku：</span><br>
Woah... So pretty. It's like we're walking on the Milky Way!<br>
And what do you think those giant cubes floating in the distance are?<br>
<span style="color:#ff9900;">Gneisenau META：</span><br>
......<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Zuikaku：</span><br>
Right, sorry! Now's not the time for sightseeing!<br>
So, uh... Where the heck are we?<br>
Just making sure, but we followed Ulrich through the gate... and are supposed to be in a separate Mirror Sea, right?<br>
<span style="color:#ff9900;">Gneisenau META：</span><br>
Correct. We came under attack, and everyone else except us fell into a coma.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Zuikaku：</span><br>
I know that– I went to check out the situation... But that doesn't explain why the Tower of Midgard is still here even after we went through the gate!<br>
I thought it was supposed to be a doorway to a different Mirror Sea, but does it actually function as a teleporter? Or, is this a different tower altogether?<br>
<span style="color:#ff9900;">Gneisenau META：</span><br>
When it comes to traveling across branches, there may be some variance in where you appear.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Zuikaku：</span><br>
Do you think you can use it to teleport to a certain location if given precise coordinates, like the Royal Navy's gate?<br>
<span style="color:#ff9900;">Gneisenau META：</span><br>
Put that aside for now. Notice anything unusual about this place?<br>
Look at the surface of the water. It doesn't properly reflect what's in the sky.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Zuikaku：</span><br>
Oh, you're right! The positions of the stars don't match at all, and I don't see the moon at all!<br>
This has to be some kind of trick... How'd you notice that so quickly?<br>
<span style="color:#ff9900;">Gneisenau META：</span><br>
By carefully observing my surroundings, rather than prancing around like a little kid.<br>
In any case, proceed with caution. This place might be much more than an ordinary Mirror Sea.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Zuikaku：</span><br>
It certainly does feel a bit foreboding... Why in the world would Ulrich want to come here?<br>
<span style="color:#ff9900;">Gneisenau META：</span><br>
You can ask her yourself once we find her.<br>
Let's hope she hasn't wandered too far from here.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Zuikaku：</span><br>
Yeah. Let's get a move on!<br>
<span style="color:#ff9900;">Gneisenau META：</span><br>
......<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Zuikaku：</span><br>
Err... Yeah, I should probably search for her with my planes first...<br>
I'm on it! Just a sec!<br>
<br>
Mirror Sea - α phase<br>
It did not take long for Zuikaku's eyes in the sky to spot Ulrich von Hutten.<br>
She had not gotten far, but something was clearly amiss–<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ulrich von Hutten：</span><br>
Just... a little more...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Zuikaku：</span><br>
We finally found you, Ulrich!<br>
...Ulrich? Are you okay?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ulrich von Hutten：</span><br>
......<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Zuikaku：</span><br>
Don't you recognize me? What's wrong?<br>
<br>
Ulrich did not respond in any way, simply continuing to shuffle forward.<br>
Her eyes were empty, and though she muttered to herself, it seemed as though her consciousness had detached from her body.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Zuikaku：</span><br>
Ulrich! Snap out of it!<br>
<br>
Zuikaku reached for Ulrich, trying to stop her in her tracks, but Gneisenau intervened.<br>
<span style="color:#ff9900;">Gneisenau META：</span><br>
Stop. She might be trapped in a nightmare, and we don't know what the risks are of forcefully rousing her.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Zuikaku：</span><br>
Trapped in a nightmare...?<br>
Wait, hold on! I think I've seen something like this before!<br>
Something really similar to this happened to Akagi and Kaga not too long ago!<br>
<span style="color:#ff9900;">Gneisenau META：</span><br>
When and where?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Zuikaku：</span><br>
It was during Operation Siren, when we were converging on the central stronghold. Akagi's fleet entered into a sea of fog.<br>
That's when everyone started acting like they were hallucinating, firing at the ocean as if there was something there. We nearly got attacked by Kaga!<br>
Do you think Ulrich might be affected the same way?<br>
<span style="color:#ff9900;">Gneisenau META：</span><br>
It's possible, but we need a more tangible link.<br>
Do you have any idea what caused those hallucinations?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Zuikaku：</span><br>
At the time, we were all bumbling around in the fog, plus there was so much confusion...<br>
But after the fact, I think we had data linking the phenomenon to Arbiter: The Hermit IX.<br>
<span style="color:#ff9900;">Gneisenau META：</span><br>
Hmm... I thought as much.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Zuikaku：</span><br>
Do you know anything about her?<br>
<span style="color:#ff9900;">Gneisenau META：</span><br>
No, but I do have a bit of history with other Arbiters...<br>
And I still have a score to settle.<br>
But enough of the past. How did you break your allies out of their hallucinations?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Zuikaku：</span><br>
Well, uhh... We kinda brute-forced it. Just incapacitated them.<br>
Then, we extracted everyone from the fog just to make sure the hallucinations didn't start up again.<br>
<span style="color:#ff9900;">Gneisenau META：</span><br>
Quarantine? That's not good enough. You have to destroy the root cause.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Zuikaku：</span><br>
In an ideal world, sure. But our top priority is making sure everyone gets out safe and sound, right?<br>
<span style="color:#ff9900;">Gneisenau META：</span><br>
Yes, that is true...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Zuikaku：</span><br>
So, I guess we'll have to incapacitate Ulrich unless you have a better idea. Do you have any training rounds on you?<br>
<span style="color:#ff9900;">Gneisenau META：</span><br>
No. Why would I carry blanks around?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Zuikaku：</span><br>
Err, okay then! I'll figure out a way to snap her out of... Wait, where's Ulrich?!<br>
<span style="color:#ff9900;">Gneisenau META：</span><br>
Damn... I think she ran for the tower while we were busy talking.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Zuikaku：</span><br>
Oh, crap! We've gotta hurry after her!<br>
<br>
Mirror Sea - α phase, inside the tower<br>
Ulrich made her way through the tower's labyrinthine interior as if she knew it like the back of her hand. Zuikaku and Gneisenau were barely able to keep pace with her.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Zuikaku：</span><br>
How in the world does she know her way around? Isn't she basically sleepwalking?<br>
Plus, this place's layout is nothing like what it looks like on the outside!<br>
There's no way in hell this place is the actual Tower of Midgard!<br>
<span style="color:#ff9900;">Gneisenau META：</span><br>
Agreed. While I'm no expert on the tower's interiors, it definitely wasn't this convoluted.<br>
(Ulrich's moving around like a puppet pulled by strings. If my gut instincts are correct...)<br>
Zuikaku! We're getting closer to the source of her nightmares!<br>
We need to knock Ulrich out of it right now, even if we have to rough her up a bit.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Zuikaku：</span><br>
On it! Wait, hold on, she's coming to a stop in front of a dome of some sort...<br>
What is that thing...?<br>
<br>
The two pursued Ulrich into a large chamber. At its center was a large, hemispherical screen.<br>
Ulrich came to a halt in front of it, her enraptured eyes blankly fixed on the image projected across the dome.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ulrich von Hutten：</span><br>
Friedrich...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Zuikaku：</span><br>
Woah, do you see that, Gneisenau?<br>
That's Friedrich, isn't it? She... She seems to be hurt!<br>
<span style="color:#ff9900;">Gneisenau META：</span><br>
(Wasn't she trying to make contact with the Ashes? That could only mean...)<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ulrich von Hutten：</span><br>
I'm... finally... here...<br>
But... I'm too late...<br>
DAMN IT!!<br>
<br>
Ulrich started to pound on the dome with her fists, with no regard for Zuikaku or Gneisenau's presence.<br>
Almost immediately, black ripples bounced back from the dome's surface.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Zuikaku：</span><br>
Get a hold of yourself, Ulrich! Urgh–!!<br>
<span style="color:#ff9900;">Gneisenau META：</span><br>
Zuikaku! Get behind me!<br>
<br>
......<br>
The shockwave knocked out both Zuikaku and Gneisenau before propagating through the tower, and then across the sea.<br>

<br>
After passing through the gate, Bismarck and her party found themselves in the middle of a vast, unknown ocean.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Regensburg：</span><br>
All readings look normal. Seems we made it safely.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Otto von Alvensleben：</span><br>
Yeah, we made it. But, we have no idea where we are or what this place is.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Jade：</span><br>
Heehee. Elbe will be so jealous when she finds out I've seen the other side of a Singularity~<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">U-556：</span><br>
*sniff, sniff*... Wow, even the air around here smells totally different.<br>
So this is what it's like to travel to a different world!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Bismarck：</span><br>
This isn't right...<br>
When using transference devices, the gate back to the original location should stay open.<br>
And yet I see nothing of the sort around here, or something to anchor this place to the Tower of Midgard.<br>
The closest thing to a gate would likely be that pillar of light in the distance, but even that seems too far away.<br>
What do you make of this, Regensburg?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Regensburg：</span><br>
I heard Ulrich was making upgrades to the Tower of Midgard's functionalities. Think it might be related to that?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Bismarck：</span><br>
It doesn't make any sense. Having the gate be accessible is crucial for logistics and evacuation. Ulrich should be well aware of the dangers of messing with the gate's location.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Regensburg：</span><br>
That's a good point. I guess we'll have to find her and ask what's going on.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Bismarck：</span><br>
(We don't have much of a lead to work with except these undecipherable coordinates, and the fact that three people are missing.)<br>
(We also can't use a brute-force method to search this place given our lack of manpower and resources. What exactly is the purpose of this place?)<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Jade：</span><br>
Bismarck, I think my recon planes have found something.<br>
That light is coming from a structure that resembles the Tower of Midgard. There are also these strange cubes floating in the waters surrounding it.<br>
We obviously don't have anything of the sort around our Tower of Midgard.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">U-556：</span><br>
Do you think it's some kind of alchemy circle?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Regensburg：</span><br>
If they're arranged in a discernable pattern, perhaps they serve a function?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Jade：</span><br>
Also, this place seems to be a closed system. After a certain point, the water blurs into a red haze.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Otto von Alvensleben：</span><br>
That definitely sounds like a Mirror Sea to me.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Jade：</span><br>
There's also not a single star in the sky. It looks almost like they're under the water's surface.<br>
Basically, I think we've been sent to a different dimension.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">U-556：</span><br>
Whoa! So like, we're on an alien planet?<br>
That's so cool! My heart's racing now!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Otto von Alvensleben：</span><br>
Yeah, mine too...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Jade：</span><br>
Try not to have a heart attack, please.<br>
In any case, it's good that we can at least breathe here, but there's still an unsettling aura about this whole place.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Regensburg：</span><br>
That's right. We still don't know the full extent of what Mirror Seas are capable of.<br>
We already know the Sirens are capable of creating all sorts of meteorological anomalies. I wouldn't put it past them to be able to make something that messes with your mind too.<br>
But, no point in speculation. What do we do next, Bismarck?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Bismarck：</span><br>
Any signs of Ulrich or the other missing people, Jade?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Jade：</span><br>
Sorry, not yet.<br>
I'll bring my planes closer to the water's surface. Assuming they haven't entered the tower itself, I should have a pretty clear view of everything in the surrounding waters.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Bismarck：</span><br>
No Sirens either, I take it?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Jade：</span><br>
So far, nothing. Believe it or not, there's pretty much nothing here except the ocean.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Bismarck：</span><br>
Alright. Let's move ahead to investigate the tower. Jade, keep your planes out and let me know if you find anything.<br>
We'll need to examine those strange cubes as well as the "boundary" around this area, but those things are lower priority.<br>
We need to locate Ulrich first.<br>
U-556, submerge and keep your eyes open. Report to me if you spot anything.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">U-556：</span><br>
Got it! Parzival of the Seas won't let anything slip by undetected!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Regensburg：</span><br>
What a reliable knight. Now, let's go.<br>

<span style="color:#4eb24e;">U-556：</span><br>
Lord Bismarck! Something's rising to the surface!<br>
<br>
KABOOOM!<br>
Before U-556 even had a chance to finish her warning, a fierce artillery barrage hurtled towards them from the horizon.<br>
The waters shook violently, but the shells all missed. Either the girls were out of range, or they weren't the intended target.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Regensburg：</span><br>
What incredible power... We would've been done for if we got caught in that.<br>
Jade! What's the status?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Jade：</span><br>
I see... about a dozen mass-produced Siren ships. Where in the world did they come from?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">U-556：</span><br>
There's a ton of enemies surfacing from beneath the waters!<br>
They've even got submarines too! Be careful, everyone!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Jade：</span><br>
Seems we've walked into an ambush... Enemies are starting to close in on us from all directions!<br>
They're no pushovers either... Those are Type-IV Sirens!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Otto von Alvensleben：</span><br>
The same model Ulrich fought when she made contact with the METAs, right?<br>
Not only are they extremely dangerous, but they can also continue posing a serious threat even without a command unit!<br>
There's no way we can handle those numbers all by ourselves!<br>
This is bad. REALLY bad!<br>
<br>
KABOOOM!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Regensburg：</span><br>
A second barrage is coming! Regina, cover me!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Otto von Alvensleben：</span><br>
What the...?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Jade：</span><br>
Bismarck...?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Regensburg：</span><br>
What's going on?<br>
<br>
Explosions went off all around the girls like dazzling fireworks, but the devastating impact never reached them. Before them loomed a massive shadow that they had never seen before.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Bismarck Zwei：</span><br>
Geryon, become an iron temple! Do not allow harm to befall our friends!<br>
<span style="color:#ff9900;">Geryon：</span><br>
ROOOAAAR!<br>
<br>
The massive metallic beast spread its wings, the bombardment from the Sirens finding no purchase as shell after shell fizzled harmlessly.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">U-556：</span><br>
Yeah! Show 'em how it's done, Geryon!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Regensburg：</span><br>
"Geryon"? Is that what your new rigging is called?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Bismarck Zwei：</span><br>
Why so surprised? I'm far from the first to name my rigging.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Regensburg：</span><br>
Don't get me wrong, I like the name. But how in the world did you–<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Bismarck Zwei：</span><br>
We'll talk about it later. A third barrage is coming.<br>
<br>
KABOOOM!<br>
Bismarck once more pivoted into a defensive stance, protecting her allies while they took evasive maneuvers.<br>
Explosions once again filled the sky, but even the few shells that appeared on target did nothing more than reflect off Bismarck's rigging.<br>
What would have otherwise been certain destruction was turned into little more than a fireworks show beneath the massive iron wings.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Jade：</span><br>
Wooooah... What is that magnificent rigging?<br>
I've never seen anything like it before...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Otto von Alvensleben：</span><br>
I... I'm totally speechless...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Bismarck Zwei：</span><br>
Ahem... Let's, uh, first get back into formation.<br>
(Impressive. So this was the final piece of the puzzle– a reinforced hull that harnesses conceptual energy...)<br>
(It has many limitations right now, but I can envision a future where everyone has access to this power.)<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">U-556：</span><br>
We finally get to witness Lord Bismarck's TRUE power!<br>
The power of the Type Zwei!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Otto von Alvensleben：</span><br>
You knew she had it all along?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">U-556：</span><br>
Well, duh!<br>
She wanted me to keep it a secret though, and what kind of knight would I be if I couldn't keep a promise?<br>
And now that you all know, you also have to keep it a secret for now!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Bismarck Zwei：</span><br>
Yes. It's experimental and has hardly been tested, so I'd appreciate it if you'd keep quiet about it.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Regensburg：</span><br>
So this is the absolute power of a superior being... I've seen the light...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">U-556：</span><br>
Lord Bismarck, let's launch our counterattack!<br>
Whatever happens, I'll fight with you until the very–<br>
<br>
Just as U-556 started to cheerily approach Bismarck, she suddenly took a step back.<br>
A moment later, she staggered, letting out a scream as if her whole body had been wracked by an electric shock.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Bismarck Zwei：</span><br>
U-556? What's wrong?!<br>
<br>
A black mist crept up from the water beneath U-556 and started to coil around her body rapidly.<br>
KABOOOM!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Otto von Alvensleben：</span><br>
A FOURTH volley?! Why haven't they given up already?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Bismarck Zwei：</span><br>
Damnit... Geryon! To me!<br>
<span style="color:#ff9900;">Geryon：</span><br>
ROOOAAAR!<br>
<span style="color:#ff9900;">U-556?：</span><br>
Lord Bismarck... don't worry... about me...<br>
Protect... the others...<br>
<br>
Before the black mist could entirely engulf her, she mustered the last of her strength to extend her hand.<br>
Towards the one she vowed to protect – the one she admired so – the one she had already saved in the past, and was now trying to save once more.<br>
But, she could not reach. Her hand fell limp and disappeared beneath the waves.<br>
{{折叠面板|内容结束}}

<br>
When the fighting ended, the once calm waters had been littered with Siren wreckages.<br>
Bismarck's display of overwhelming power rallied her allies and neutralized the threat of what should have been a deadly enemy.<br>
Yet, never had the nectar of victory tasted more bitter.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Otto von Alvensleben：</span><br>
What happened to U-556?<br>
Why did she suddenly... get swallowed up by that black mist?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Bismarck Zwei：</span><br>
I don't know, but I have a theory.<br>
When I sank following the battle with the Royal Navy long ago, she dove into the water to save me.<br>
While she did manage to drag me to safety, I was severely corrupted by my use of the Black Cube at the time.<br>
Her close proximity to me must've caused some erosion to her Wisdom Cube, though not to the same extent.<br>
What we just witnessed... might be related to that.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Otto von Alvensleben：</span><br>
Just like an old wound opening back up, huh?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Bismarck Zwei：</span><br>
I can't say for sure... She's reassured me again and again that all her inspections have come back normal, but I should've been more attentive...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Regensburg：</span><br>
How did you get better? Can't you give her a brand new rigging like yours?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Bismarck Zwei：</span><br>
It's hard to say. Her recovery seemed on-track with standard medical treatment, and there are still limitations with the rigging technology...<br>
(Without the Commander's help, there's no way of connecting to her Wisdom Cube...)<br>
This is my fault for underestimating the extent of the Black Cube's corruption...<br>
<br>
Just then, the vivid imagery of U-556 just before she disappeared beneath the waves flashed through Bismarck's mind.<br>
Her trembling, outstretched hand, her anguished scream, that look of desperation and fear on her face. The fear of becoming something else–<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Bismarck Zwei：</span><br>
(The Black Cube's corruption... METAmorphosis...)<br>
(That's right... Something in this Mirror Sea must be amplifying the effects of the Black Cube corruption...)<br>
(I didn't notice it during the battle, but that must've been what caused U-556 to relapse.)<br>
(If we can take it out, it might not be too late to save U-556.)<br>
(I can't put anyone else at risk... This is my duty as the wielder of the Zwei rigging!)<br>
This might be a long shot, Jade, but can you see if you can find U-556?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Jade：</span><br>
Sadly, I can't see much of anything right now other than Sirens in the distance.<br>
Several fleets of mass-produced ships, in fact. They're moving towards the Tower of Midgard.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Bismarck Zwei：</span><br>
That must be it. What's the quickest way there?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Jade：</span><br>
To the northwest. It's a straight line for the tower.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Bismarck Zwei：</span><br>
Everyone, follow me. We're going after the Siren fleets.<br>
Full speed ahead to the tower!<br>
{{折叠面板|内容结束}}

{{折叠面板|标题=Hunting Ground and Grave|选项=8|主框=1|样式=primary|展开=是}}
<br>
A deep red sky, a murky, jet-black sea.<br>
Burning wreckages smashing together before disappearing beneath the waves.<br>
<span style="color:#ff9900;">Gneisenau META：</span><br>
This place is...<br>
Yes, I remember now...<br>
My hunting grounds... and my grave...<br>
<br>
KABOOOM!<br>
Gneisenau's cannons rang out, tearing the smoldering husks around her into fine dust that was carried away on the wind.<br>
How long had she been fighting here all by herself? How many enemies had she sunk? None of it mattered anymore.<br>
Her existence had become nothing more than wandering this vast, boundless ocean, destroying everything in sight.<br>
<span style="color:#ff9900;">Gneisenau META：</span><br>
Yes... That is the sole purpose I have left.<br>
I don't need to think or feel. I need only destroy my enemies.<br>
<br>
She never stopped treading through the smoke and flames, lest the icy water beneath her feet swallow her.<br>
But suddenly, her eternal, unchanging vigil was torn by a new, alien sound.<br>
The acceleration of a torpedo that should not exist. A foe that was not of Siren origin.<br>
<span style="color:#ff9900;">Gneisenau META：</span><br>
New... reinforcements?<br>
You'll need to try harder than that if you– What?!<br>
<br>
She cleanly shot through the slow-moving torpedo, but from the torrent of water leapt a small, familiar figure.<br>
<span style="color:#ff9900;">U-556 META?：</span><br>
*SPLASH!!*<br>
<span style="color:#ff9900;">Gneisenau META：</span><br>
What?! U-556?!<br>
<br>
The sight of the girl left Gneisenau utterly bewildered.<br>
She instinctively sidestepped the incoming submarine, but staggered in surprise as a spark of life returned to her hazy eyes.<br>
<span style="color:#ff9900;">Gneisenau META：</span><br>
You... I thought you sank with Bismarck long ago...<br>
How are you here? And what became of you...?!<br>
You're... just like me now! A cursed husk of your former self!<br>
<span style="color:#ff9900;">U-556 META?：</span><br>
Need to hurry... I need to go back...<br>
<br>
U-556 ignored Gneisenau. She dove beneath the waves once more, heading straight towards a light in the distance.<br>
<span style="color:#ff9900;">Gneisenau META：</span><br>
The Tower of Midgard? That can't be... It doesn't exist in my branch...<br>
No, I see... I understand now...<br>
This is just a dream. A hallucination drawn from my memories.<br>
I've already rediscovered my reason to fight... So I don't have time to waste on these illusions!<br>
...How could I have been careless enough to fall prey to the Arbiter's hallucinations?<br>
I must've fallen unconscious after that shockwave back in the control room...<br>
Right... Ulrich, Zuikaku, and the control room...<br>
<br>
She looked around and saw she was on the tower's outer ring.<br>
And not far from her, there was another shipgirl, lying unconscious on the ground.<br>
<span style="color:#ff9900;">Gneisenau META：</span><br>
Looks like I'll have to make some noise to wake her up...<br>
I really should bring some blanks next time.<br>
<br>
KABOOOM!<br>

<br>
Mirror Sea - α phase, inside the tower<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Otto von Alvensleben：</span><br>
That sounded like cannon fire!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Regensburg：</span><br>
I heard it too! Someone must be fighting!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Bismarck Zwei：</span><br>
It's coming from the outer ring platform. Jade, send some planes there to see what's happening.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Jade：</span><br>
On it!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Bismarck Zwei：</span><br>
Quickly now, everyone! We have quite some distance to cover!<br>
<br>
Mirror Sea - α phase, tower outer ring<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Jade：</span><br>
*pant*... *pant*... I've found the target!<br>
<span style="color:#ff9900;">Gneisenau META：</span><br>
I had a hunch it was you all when I saw those Iron Blood aircraft.<br>
I see you've learned to use the Type Zwei rigging, Bismarck.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Bismarck Zwei：</span><br>
Ah, I've never shown it to you before, have I?<br>
I owe you and the Commander thanks for helping me stand once more. You have my gratitude.<br>
<span style="color:#ff9900;">Gneisenau META：</span><br>
Don't mention it. I only did what needed to be done.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Bismarck Zwei：</span><br>
Zuikaku, I'm glad you're safe.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Zuikaku：</span><br>
Y-yeah, I'm fine! Hope I didn't make you worry!<br>
(Is that really Bismarck? I'm still a bit woozy after waking up...)<br>
(Her rigging seems completely different, both in looks and size!)<br>
Sorry for asking, but... is that rigging yours?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Bismarck Zwei：</span><br>
Indeed. This is the Type Zwei rigging, a collaborative effort with my life on the line, quite literally.<br>
But, you can just call him "Geryon."<br>
I didn't mean to hide his existence from you, but this technology is still highly experimental.<br>
Had we not encountered an emergency situation, I would've preferred to not bring him into combat.<br>
After we get back, I'll be glad to answer any questions you have. Before that, however, I'm afraid we need to talk business first–<br>
Why was the Tower of Midgard activated, and where is Ulrich?<br>
<span style="color:#ff9900;">Gneisenau META：</span><br>
It's a bit complicated, but let me explain–<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Bismarck Zwei：</span><br>
So, this began as a conceptual attack that placed everyone from Iron Blood into a deep sleep. Ulrich was manipulated through these hallucinations to activate the Tower of Midgard.<br>
It's at least a relief to know that their lives are not in any imminent danger.<br>
Thank you, both of you, for explaining the situation and for coming to aid Ulrich.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Zuikaku：</span><br>
I mean, I haven't done anything worthy of thanks yet...<br>
Just curious, did you guys not sense the shockwave that knocked me and Gneisenau out?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Otto von Alvensleben：</span><br>
Uhh, don't think so? We had our hands full with the Sirens.<br>
If it even reached us, it probably had already fizzled out to the point of not being noticeable.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Jade：</span><br>
I didn't sense anything of the sort either.<br>
If it had the same effect on us, the Sirens would've turned us into mincemeat.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Regensburg：</span><br>
Didn't notice anything here. Regina says the same thing.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Zuikaku：</span><br>
That makes sense... Energy does dissipate as it travels, after all.<br>
But, if none of you felt anything... What happened to U-556?<br>
<span style="color:#ff9900;">Gneisenau META：</span><br>
If I had to speculate, I'd say she started undergoing METAmorphosis.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Zuikaku：</span><br>
METAmorphosis? You really think so?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Bismarck Zwei：</span><br>
What makes you say that?<br>
<span style="color:#ff9900;">Gneisenau META：</span><br>
I was actually trapped in a hallucination myself during that time frame. I only was able to snap out of it because U-556 attacked me.<br>
I clearly remember, she looked very similar to how I look now.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Bismarck Zwei：</span><br>
I see... Where is she now?<br>
<span style="color:#ff9900;">Gneisenau META：</span><br>
She likely went inside the Tower of Midgard.<br>
Before I managed to completely shrug off the influence of the hallucination, I saw a pillar of light in the distance.<br>
That's a signal that someone activated the gate.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Bismarck Zwei：</span><br>
...I need you two to come with me.<br>
We must head for the control center and see if Ulrich is there.<br>
<br>
Mirror Sea - α phase, inside the tower<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Jade：</span><br>
There she is!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Otto von Alvensleben：</span><br>
Ulrich!<br>
<span style="color:#ff9900;">Gneisenau META：</span><br>
No! Stay away!<br>
Bismarck, you feel it too, don't you? The aura coming from the control room is making my stomach turn.<br>
Going in unprepared is dangerous. We should find another way.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Bismarck Zwei：</span><br>
I know that feeling. Her hull is undergoing corrosion as we speak, but it might not be too late if we act now.<br>
Gneisenau, take the others away from the door.<br>
Wait outside the door. No, just to be safe, at the end of the corridor. I'll handle this.<br>
<span style="color:#ff9900;">Gneisenau META：</span><br>
You can't be serious, Bismarck! You already know the risks of being exposed to further corruption–<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Bismarck Zwei：</span><br>
Don't worry about me. I'll be fine.<br>
Stick together. I'll call you once I'm done.<br>

Within a dream, Ulrich was reunited with a friend she had been separated from.<br>
She was once a conductor of the battlefield who played music as effortlessly as she played her foes. Now, she lay on the ground, powerless.<br>
<span style="color:#ff9900;">Ulrich von Hutten：</span><br>
This can't be the ending you wanted, Friedrich.<br>
<br>
Alone, surrounded by fire and destruction, with neither friends nor foes for company.<br>
<span style="color:#ff9900;">Ulrich von Hutten：</span><br>
Hmph... So much for the High Seas Fleet you had such hopes for.<br>
If only you had trusted me... This wouldn't have happened to you...<br>
...<br>
Who did this to you?<br>
If you're still alive, answer me! Answer me!!<br>
<br>
Only the strident death throes of metallic beasts answered her cries.<br>
<span style="color:#ff9900;">Ulrich von Hutten：</span><br>
...<br>
Even had you managed to get the Eagle Union and Sakura Empire on the same page, would they have listened to you?<br>
You can't change anything... Not Bismarck, not you.<br>
<br>
Click, clack... Footsteps were drawing closer.<br>
In this place where she did battle against an Arbiter and lost, she was no longer alone.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Bismarck：</span><br>
...Is this the nightmare that haunts your heart, Ulrich?<br>
<span style="color:#ff9900;">Ulrich von Hutten：</span><br>
...Bismarck. You abandoned Iron Blood when it needed you most... Why are you showing your face again now?<br>
It's over, Bismarck. We've already lost the war.<br>
Look around. Our counterattack was a failure. Everyone we know is dead, and for what? The Arbiter still lives.<br>
So why even come here? What the hell do you want?!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Bismarck：</span><br>
I know what happened.<br>
<span style="color:#ff9900;">Ulrich von Hutten：</span><br>
Friedrich liberated us from forever being slaves to the Sirens' Reenactments.<br>
But, you. You sought the power of the Black Cube. You would've had us dancing in the palms of their hands.<br>
You charged ahead without saying anything to us. You left us behind to fend for ourselves!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Bismarck：</span><br>
I know what happened.<br>
<span style="color:#ff9900;">Ulrich von Hutten：</span><br>
What do you know?! You've done jack shit for us!<br>
Friedrich and Eugen worked their asses off while you lay in a sickbed!<br>
And now, after it's all over, you finally decide to show your face?!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Bismarck：</span><br>
I know what happened.<br>
<span style="color:#ff9900;">Ulrich von Hutten：</span><br>
......<br>
Why aren't you defending yourself? Why aren't you saying anything?<br>
How? Why? Are you a coward? Have we been led by a coward this whole damn time?!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Bismarck：</span><br>
I have nothing to say. What you said is true.<br>
Thank you for being honest with me, Ulrich.<br>
It's true that I've made mistakes, and that I've let down my country and my friends. But, allow me to correct one thing–<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Bismarck Zwei：</span><br>
Iron Blood has not fallen.<br>
<span style="color:#ff9900;">Geryon：</span><br>
ROOOAAAR!<br>
<span style="color:#ff9900;">Ulrich von Hutten：</span><br>
I see... So, it was all a dream after all...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Bismarck Zwei：</span><br>
You knew?<br>
<span style="color:#ff9900;">Ulrich von Hutten：</span><br>
Like a vague itch in the back of my mind. I somehow knew it wasn't real, but didn't want to snap out of it either.<br>
Perhaps because it reflected my heart's deepest desires, just as you said...<br>
All I wanted... was to fight by Friedrich's side.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Bismarck Zwei：</span><br>
I know what happened.<br>
<span style="color:#ff9900;">Ulrich von Hutten：</span><br>
And, I wanted to look for someone to blame.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Bismarck Zwei：</span><br>
Yes... I know.<br>
Iron Blood's survival was thrown into jeopardy because of my actions.<br>
And in my absence, you received immense pressure from all sides. From the other factions, from the Sirens, even from the Naval HQ.<br>
Despite that, and despite the toll it took on you, you and many others worked selflessly to protect Iron Blood.<br>
I won't say I know how hard it was for you, but I will say this – thank you.<br>
Thank you for your commitment to Iron Blood, Ulrich von Hutten.<br>
<span style="color:#ff9900;">Ulrich von Hutten：</span><br>
You have some nerve. I feel like punching you.<br>
Of course, I won't. You are our leader, after all.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Bismarck Zwei：</span><br>
If you really did do it, I wouldn't hold it against you.<br>
Do you still feel like you're dreaming? It's almost time to go.<br>
<span style="color:#ff9900;">Ulrich von Hutten：</span><br>
Yeah. There's still something in my head, screaming a whole lot of nonsense...<br>
Am I... going to turn META?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Bismarck Zwei：</span><br>
Not necessarily. While I detect the corruption taking hold in your hull, it can still be stopped.<br>
I understand what you're going through, to feel like you're being crushed beneath overwhelming despair.<br>
But, you've managed to hold on to your sanity. That is already remarkable and worthy of hope.<br>
<span style="color:#ff9900;">Ulrich von Hutten：</span><br>
I thought METAmorphosis was irreversible? Isn't it only a matter of time?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Bismarck Zwei：</span><br>
Normally, yes. But, Queen Elizabeth and the Commander gave us an invaluable hint.<br>
While existing corrosion cannot be reversed, externally-induced cases such as yours...<br>
Can be baited out with a more suitable "host."<br>

<br>
Geryon let out a mighty roar, and the nightmare surrounding Bismarck and Ulrich shattered into pieces.<br>
But even as the fragments of illusion fell away, the attack did not end there.<br>
As if responding to the situation, a black-and-red haze gushed out from Ulrich's body and began to lurch towards Bismarck.<br>
The shadowy substance climbed up her body and rigging like a ravenous beast, shaking wildly as if reveling in a successful hunt.<br>
It seemed as if she would become its next victim.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Bismarck Zwei：</span><br>
Interesting. So this is the same energy as the shockwaves given off by the black tornado from the Northern Parliament's data files.<br>
A risky gambit, but well worth the effort.<br>
Geryon, devour it.<br>
<span style="color:#ff9900;">Geryon：</span><br>
ROOOAAAR!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ulrich von Hutten：</span><br>
The voice... It's gone?<br>
(It's as if her rigging completely dispelled the haze... But how is it possible to do something like that?)<br>
You said something about a "host"...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Bismarck Zwei：</span><br>
The nightmare you experienced is a conceptual attack on the very thing that makes up our being – the Wisdom Cube.<br>
Our riggings share this same concept, and essentially are extensions of our hulls with the same properties.<br>
By temporarily strengthening the concept of the hull within a powerful, autonomous being, Geryon became the strongest "concept" of a shipgirl here.<br>
Furthermore, I've already experienced a severe degree of corruption in the past, and am better equipped to deal with it.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ulrich von Hutten：</span><br>
Alright, alright, I get it. I'm too tired to listen to your technobabble right now.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Bismarck Zwei：</span><br>
Hah. There's the Ulrich I know.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ulrich von Hutten：</span><br>
Yeah. Feels pretty damn good now that my head's finally clear for the first time in forever.<br>
Wait, hold on a sec... What happens next now that your rigging went and absorbed all that nasty gunk?<br>
You've taken on the corruption, but what are you going to do if you can't get rid of it?<br>
You should already know how dangerous this is. Why would you, the leader of Iron Blood, shoulder this risk for me?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Bismarck Zwei：</span><br>
Because things will change this time, Ulrich. I sincerely believe it. But more importantly...<br>
Because you, Gneisenau, and U-556...<br>
You're more than just my subordinates. You're my friends, my family.<br>
<br>
Bismarck offered her hand out to Ulrich, who hesitated for a moment before finally accepting it.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Bismarck Zwei：</span><br>
Ulrich, we need you. Not just me or Iron Blood, but all of us.<br>
Together, we can forge a brighter future.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ulrich von Hutten：</span><br>
Yeah. I'm with you.<br>
<br>
Ulrich straightened herself out before turning to face Bismarck. No longer was there any doubt or loneliness in her eyes.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Bismarck Zwei：</span><br>
Glad to have you back. Let's go get the others.<br>
<br>
Mirror Sea - α phase, inside the tower<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Jade：</span><br>
Thank goodness the two of you are fine!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Regensburg：</span><br>
Ulrich looks like she's doing a whole lot better too.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Otto von Alvensleben：</span><br>
Would you look at that. Everything turned out okay in the end.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ulrich von Hutten：</span><br>
Yeah. Doubt that nightmare's ever coming back to haunt me.<br>
I still feel a little out of it, but I'll be back to normal before you know it.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Bismarck Zwei：</span><br>
Did anything happen while I was inside the control center?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Regensburg：</span><br>
Actually, yes. As ordered, we stood on standby at the end of the corridor.<br>
At first, everything was normal, but then something rather strange happened.<br>
We all felt a palpable sense of danger in the air, and then saw a strange black mist seeping out from the doorway...<br>
Gneisenau was about to rush in to check on you, but that oppressive feeling dissipated as quickly as it had come on.<br>
That pretty much brings us to where we're at now.<br>
What was that thing?<br>
<span style="color:#ff9900;">Gneisenau META：</span><br>
That energy is strong enough to corrode a shipgirl's hull. There's no way something like that could just vanish into thin air.<br>
What did you do, Bismarck?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Bismarck Zwei：</span><br>
I took a little gamble, that's all. Thanks to Queen Elizabeth and the Commander's findings, we have more insight into how Wisdom Cubes manifest their power.<br>
Combined with Scharnhorst's research, we now have the technology to temporarily redirect this corrosive energy into our riggings and neutralize it to a certain extent.<br>
It doesn't address the root of the problem, but at least it'll provide us some resistance to META corruption from external sources.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Jade：</span><br>
In other words... We won't have to worry about getting knocked out by that black energy or getting trapped inside a nightmare?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Otto von Alvensleben：</span><br>
That's great news. We'll have a fighting chance against whatever it was that got its hands on U-556, right?<br>
<span style="color:#ff9900;">Gneisenau META：</span><br>
I see... You've found a way to stem the corruption.<br>
I was right to place my trust in you, Bismarck.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Bismarck Zwei：</span><br>
We've only seen a brief glimmer of this technology's potential. With further testing, we might even be able to reverse–<br>
<span style="color:#ff9900;">Gneisenau META：</span><br>
I know what you're about to say, but give up on that notion. There's no reversing METAmorphosis.<br>
...And even if it does somehow become possible, I've already accepted the reality of this body, and of this power.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Bismarck Zwei：</span><br>
I understand.<br>
<span style="color:#ff9900;">Gneisenau META：</span><br>
One last thing. I've had some time to review what I know with what I learned from Zuikaku. All these phenomena we've been experiencing likely tie back to Arbiter IX: The Hermit.<br>
If we go after U-556, we will likely be delivering ourselves straight to her.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Bismarck Zwei：</span><br>
An Arbiter? We hardly have the resources to deal with their spare vessels, let alone a complete Arbiter.<br>
But, there's no other way. We have to keep searching the tower.<br>
Zuikaku, I'm sorry for getting you tangled up in this mess.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Zuikaku：</span><br>
Oh, uh, don't be sorry!<br>
You've given me the VIP treatment while I was at the Floating Fortress, so it's only natural I return the favor!<br>
Whatever happens, I'm with you 'til the end!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Bismarck Zwei：</span><br>
Thank you. Everyone, let's bring U-556 back!<br>

<br>
Mirror Sea - α phase<br>
In a burst of light, the Tower of Midgard sprung to life again without warning.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Otto von Alvensleben：</span><br>
...What just happened? Did we get teleported?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Jade：</span><br>
Seems so. By the looks of things, we got ejected from the tower, but are still inside the same Mirror Sea.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Regensburg：</span><br>
Yeah, I can still see the Tower of Midgard in the distance. We just have to make our way back there again...<br>
<br>
Everyone surveyed their surroundings. The scenery around them seemed slightly different, but without a doubt, they were still inside the Mirror Sea.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Bismarck Zwei：</span><br>
Whoever is behind this clearly doesn't plan on letting us leave.<br>
Also, take a look around. The boundary of the red sea is closing in on us.<br>
Remember how far away it seemed when we first arrived? It's almost touching the edges of those floating cubes now.<br>
Jade, launch your planes and take a closer look at what's going on.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Jade：</span><br>
You got it!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Regensburg：</span><br>
Bismarck, is it just me, or does it feel like something major shifted inside this Mirror Sea at some point?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Bismarck Zwei：</span><br>
I noticed it too. It was likely at the moment the Tower of Midgard was last activated.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Regensburg：</span><br>
Let me get one thing straight then – Zuikaku, you and Gneisenau were the first to arrive, right?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Zuikaku：</span><br>
Yeah, we were looking for Ulrich when we first arrived, and there was no red sea here at all.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ulrich von Hutten：</span><br>
......<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Zuikaku：</span><br>
Oh, uh, you were sleepwalking at the time, so it's natural you wouldn't remember it.<br>
While I can't be 100% sure, I think Jade was the first to observe the red sea.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ulrich von Hutten：</span><br>
(All I did remember from my episode is going through the gate and heading straight for the control center... No, wait, there's one more thing.)<br>
Those giant cubes. I don't remember them being there.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Zuikaku：</span><br>
Huh? That's weird. Gneisenau and I definitely saw them when we first got here.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Regensburg：</span><br>
If what Ulrich said is true, and the cubes aren't based on some kind of timetable, we must've done something to cause them to appear.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Jade：</span><br>
Let's see... We went through the gate, used the dome projector in the control center, and fought a bunch of mass-produced ships...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Otto von Alvensleben：</span><br>
It could be anything, for all we know.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ulrich von Hutten：</span><br>
Out of those, I think passing through the gate is the most likely culprit.<br>
The most conspicuous changes to this area occurred each time the Tower of Midgard was activated.<br>
After I arrived, a column of light appeared from the Tower of Midgard on this side. After Zuikaku arrived, the cubes showed up along with the red sea.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Bismarck Zwei：</span><br>
And following that line of reasoning, this last activation of the tower is what caused the red sea to start expanding.<br>
This is completely unlike any functionality of the Tower of Midgard we're familiar with in the real world, but the more pressing question is – what do those floating cubes do?<br>
<span style="color:#ff9900;">Gneisenau META：</span><br>
All that said, we should try to avoid the cubes as well as the red sea as much as possible. They reek of corruption to me.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Bismarck Zwei：</span><br>
Agreed. While my Geryon is able to offer some protection, I do not want to test its limits with your lives on the line.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Jade：</span><br>
Oh! My recon planes have spotted something!<br>
There are recent signs of battle, and the wreckage of a Siren fleet!<br>
Before you ask – no, they're not the same ones we fought earlier.<br>
Don't you think that's odd? Maybe there's someone else trapped in here with us?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Bismarck Zwei：</span><br>
(Based on what we know about the Tower of Midgard, the gate allows travel between branches.)<br>
(It shouldn't function like a fancy transference device that simply teleports you around in the same area.)<br>
(Wait... Objects appearing out of nowhere, Sirens materializing from hidden spaces... What if we actually ARE moving within branches, except contained in a multi-layered system?)<br>
Jade, where are the Siren wreckages? Can you lead us to them?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Jade：</span><br>
Of course! They're to the northeast. Interestingly,the signs of battle intensify closer to the tower.<br>
Hang on! I just saw a bomb go off!<br>
Someone is fighting the Sirens as we speak!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Bismarck Zwei：</span><br>
It might be U-556. Everyone, full speed towards the tower!<br>

<br>
Mirror Sea - α phase<br>
As the fleet got closer, it became increasingly clear who was wreaking havoc on the Sirens.<br>
KABOOOM!<br>
<span style="color:#ff9900;">U-556 META?：</span><br>
Hahaha! An army of trash is still a bunch of trash!<br>
The Parzival of the Seas still has important things to do, so stop wasting my time!<br>
<br>
KABOOOM!<br>
<span style="color:#ff9900;">U-556 META?：</span><br>
Fine! If you're gonna be like that, I'll sink you all!<br>
You're all going to sink!<br>
<br>
The once cheerful and easygoing self-proclaimed knight was now ripping through the Sirens, shouting uncharacteristically.<br>
She was so absorbed in fighting that she didn't even notice Bismarck and the rest of the fleet approaching.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Jade：</span><br>
Is that... U-556?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Otto von Alvensleben：</span><br>
Looks sort of like her, but she sure doesn't SOUND like her.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Bismarck Zwei：</span><br>
Without a doubt, that's a telltale sign of METAmorphosis.<br>
While her appearance is broadly the same, her rigging looks very different. It's a reflection of the changes to her psyche.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Regensburg：</span><br>
Can you use your Geryon to bring her back to normal?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Bismarck Zwei：</span><br>
I'm not sure. Geryon is able to absorb external sources of corrosion. If her hull has already been corrupted, I'm afraid there's not much I can do about that.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Regensburg：</span><br>
Does that mean... she's beyond salvation?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Bismarck Zwei：</span><br>
I'd have to examine her more closely to answer that.<br>
(From what Scharnhorst and Gneisenau have told me, the symptoms of METAmorphosis, namely changes in power and external appearance, do not necessarily reflect the degree of corrosion.)<br>
(In some cases, even minor hull corrosion can cause extremely noticeable abnormalities, whereas on the other hand, there are cases in which late-stage corrosion hardly exhibits any symptoms.)<br>
(In other words, it all depends on the hull in question.)<br>
To the best of my knowledge, U-556's condition was stable until it was exacerbated by the black mist. If I can draw it away from her the same way I did with Ulrich...<br>
There's a chance she can still be saved.<br>
So, don't give up hope.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Regensburg：</span><br>
Okay. Thank goodness.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ulrich von Hutten：</span><br>
Bad news, Bismarck. Before we can talk about any of that stuff, we have to first make sure she comes back in one piece.<br>
More Sirens are coming, but this time, they've brought Enforcers.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Zuikaku：</span><br>
Enforcers?! That means––<br>
Damnit, I can see them too now! Where these guys go, the Arbiters follow!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Bismarck Zwei：</span><br>
Enforcer IX: Exploration... So, the Hermit really is the one behind all this.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Otto von Alvensleben：</span><br>
They've got U-556 surrounded! Even a META doesn't stand a chance against this many of 'em!<br>
<span style="color:#ff9900;">Gneisenau META：</span><br>
During the early stages of METAmorphosis, it's easy to be intoxicated by that newfound power.<br>
It happened to me, and I suspect it's happening to her.<br>
In this state of recklessness, she's likely to fight to the death if backed into a corner. We have to go after her right now, Bismarck!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Bismarck Zwei：</span><br>
Jade, Zuikaku, give us aerial support while we close in!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Jade：</span><br>
Understood! Scrambling planes now!<br>
<br>
KABOOOM!<br>
<span style="color:#ff9900;">U-556 META?：</span><br>
More enemies? Dammit...<br>
Of course they've got aircraft... Piss off, all of you!<br>
<br>
KABOOOM!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Jade：</span><br>
Hey! U-556 is shooting at my aircraft!<br>
What's she doing? Did her memories get wiped by METAmorphosis or something?<br>
<span style="color:#ff9900;">Gneisenau META：</span><br>
That's not the issue. She doesn't seem to have the ability to distinguish friend from foe at the moment. The more aggressively we intervene, the more likely she'll see us as enemies.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Otto von Alvensleben：</span><br>
What do we do then? We can't just watch while she gets blasted to pieces!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Bismarck Zwei：</span><br>
I have an idea, but I'll need you all to help.<br>
I'll make a beeline to U-556.<br>
In the meantime, create a diversion and try to draw the Sirens away from us.<br>
Ulrich, can you take command?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ulrich von Hutten：</span><br>
Sure. You be careful now.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Bismarck Zwei：</span><br>
I'll be fine. Good luck.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ulrich von Hutten：</span><br>
Alright, listen up! On my mark, fire three volleys at the Sirens and take heat off of Bismarck and U-556!<br>
Once they're on us, we'll spread out away from 'em!<br>
Remember, our job is just to keep them busy! Buy Bismarck enough time to get U-556 to safety!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Everyone：</span><br>
Roger!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ulrich von Hutten：</span><br>
Okay! Go!<br>

<br>
Mirror Sea - α phase<br>
Thanks to the team's coordinated efforts, nearly all Sirens had been lured away from U-556.<br>
Now only a few remained at the center of the battlefield – Bismarck, U-556, and a few Enforcers who were dead-set on fighting despite their injuries.<br>
<span style="color:#ff9900;">Geryon：</span><br>
ROOOAAAR!<br>
<br>
With a simple order to her rigging, Bismarck forced the Enforcers to flee.<br>
<span style="color:#ff9900;">U-556 META?：</span><br>
You're the last one standing in my way...<br>
Fine, I'll make this quick!<br>
My Lord needs me! I have no time to waste on you!<br>
<br>
U-556 mounted her rigging and rushed straight towards Bismarck.<br>
<span style="color:#ff9900;">Geryon：</span><br>
ROOOAAGHH!<br>
<br>
The giant mechanical dragon moved on its own accord, forming a shield with its wings to halt the submarine's attack.<br>
Her attack neutralized, U-556 dove back beneath the waters.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Bismarck Zwei：</span><br>
Enough, Geryon. Get back.<br>
<span style="color:#ff9900;">Geryon：</span><br>
......<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Bismarck Zwei：</span><br>
Good boy. Let me handle this.<br>
<br>
At Bismarck's command, the steel beast reluctantly stood down.<br>
She, too, took a step back, and that's when the water under her feet shook.<br>
<span style="color:#ff9900;">U-556 META?：</span><br>
You're wide open! It's oveeer!<br>
<br>
U-556 reemerged, her weapons pointed straight at Bismarck.<br>
Bismarck answered the attack with open arms, embracing her dear friend.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Bismarck Zwei：</span><br>
You're right. It's over now.<br>
<br>
The girl had a nightmare. A lonesome, fading light, just barely illuminating the figure of a person important to her sinking deeper into the depths.<br>
<span style="color:#ff9900;">U-556：</span><br>
Lord Bismaaarck!<br>
Hang in there! I'm coming for you!<br>
<br>
Her engines sputtered. She had already pushed them beyond their breaking point, and they threatened to give out at any moment.<br>
Enemy after enemy emerged from the dark. A black mist congealed around her, becoming thicker and thicker. The currents seemed to be pushing her back towards the surface.<br>
<span style="color:#ff9900;">U-556：</span><br>
Where are all these jerks coming from?!<br>
Ugh... Lord Bismarck! Just wait for me!<br>
I promised I'd bring you back home even if I have to tow you!<br>
They just won't stop coming... I...<br>
...Get the hell out of my way!<br>
<br>
She shot at the shadows, clawed at them, tore at them with her teeth, but it was no use.<br>
Every time she destroyed them, they would form again between her and her sinking friend, as if mocking her.<br>
Despite her best efforts, her slender fingertips could never reach.<br>
<span style="color:#ff9900;">U-556：</span><br>
Lord Bismarck... Wait... Hang on!<br>
I just need to deal with these things... Then I'll be right there!<br>
Just wait for me... Please...<br>
<br>
Tears clouded her eyes. Her Lord sank deeper and deeper, until nothing but darkness remained.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">???：</span><br>
Everything is fine now, U-556.<br>
<br>
From the darkness, a voice called out to the little girl.<br>
She gathered her courage and opened her eyes.<br>
The dim light gradually became brighter, revealing the source of the voice.<br>
There she was. The person she couldn't save in her nightmares.<br>
<span style="color:#ff9900;">U-556 META?：</span><br>
Lord Bismarck...? You're... not dead?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Bismarck Zwei：</span><br>
No. You saved me, don't you remember?<br>
<span style="color:#ff9900;">U-556 META?：</span><br>
Oh, yeah... I remember now... Thank goodness I wasn't too late...<br>
You know, I had the worst nightmare just now...<br>
You were sinking, and no matter how hard I tried, I couldn't reach you...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Bismarck Zwei：</span><br>
That's all it was. A nightmare. Look, I'm here with you now, alive and well.<br>
<span style="color:#ff9900;">U-556 META?：</span><br>
Yeah... You're here with me, and...<br>
We're... underwater?!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Bismarck Zwei：</span><br>
Haha. That we are, my little Parzival.<br>
Come on. It's time to wake up.<br>
<br>
Some time later...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ulrich von Hutten：</span><br>
Bismarck, we're done on our end.<br>
And... looks like you've taken care of business as well.<br>
<span style="color:#ff9900;">U-556 META?：</span><br>
Ulrich! Are you okay?!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ulrich von Hutten：</span><br>
I should be asking you that. How are you holding up?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Jade：</span><br>
Hey! Hey! Do you recognize me now?<br>
<span style="color:#ff9900;">U-556 META?：</span><br>
Yeah... You're Jade.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Otto von Alvensleben：</span><br>
And me? Remember my name?<br>
<span style="color:#ff9900;">U-556 META?：</span><br>
Hi, Otto!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Jade：</span><br>
Phew... At least she's come back to her senses.<br>
But, she still doesn't look like she used to.<br>
<span style="color:#ff9900;">Gneisenau META：</span><br>
Seems like we were too late after all.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Bismarck Zwei：</span><br>
No. Let's not jump to conclusions.<br>
I used Geryon to administer some emergency treatment, but this corruption seems to be a lot more persistent and hasn't disappeared in its entirety. I fear we'll need to confront the one behind all this first.<br>
<span style="color:#ff9900;">Gneisenau META：</span><br>
......<br>
<span style="color:#ff9900;">U-556 META?：</span><br>
It's totally fine, Lord Bismarck! I dig my new look!<br>
Plus, I feel like I get stronger the more I fight. I can protect you better than ever before!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Bismarck Zwei：</span><br>
U-556... Unless absolutely necessary, I don't want you fighting at all until we return to the Floating Fortress.<br>
The power you feel now is the same mistake I once made – the power of the Black Cube. Don't use this power lightly, or you'll only worsen your condition.<br>
<span style="color:#ff9900;">U-556 META?：</span><br>
Wh-what?! Really?<br>
I mean... If you're sure, then I'll do as you say!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Zuikaku：</span><br>
Well... Happy ending, I guess? Everyone's safe and sound, despite everything.<br>
Now all that's left is to find a way out of here.<br>
<br>
The girls turned their eyes towards the Tower of Midgard and the beacon of light pouring from its gate.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Bismarck Zwei：</span><br>
Let's get going. There's only one way home.<br>
{{折叠面板|内容结束}}

{{折叠面板|标题=Upside-Down|选项=15|主框=1|样式=primary|展开=是}}
<br>
The girls once more returned to the Tower of Midgard and passed through the gate.<br>
However, it didn't lead to where they hoped...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Zuikaku：</span><br>
Thiiis... doesn't look like the Fortress.<br>
<br>
They all looked around. While a few details had changed, they were, without a doubt, still trapped in the perplexing Mirror Sea.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Bismarck Zwei：</span><br>
Beyond the red sea expanding again, it's all the same...<br>
(What will happen if it expands to cover everything? Nothing good, I imagine...)<br>
Wait... What's that in the sky?<br>
<span style="color:#ff9900;">Gneisenau META：</span><br>
It almost looks like... a city.<br>
<br>
Above them, a city full of high-rises was suspended upside-down in the starless sky.<br>
Two helix-like pathways spiraled through the city, reaching down towards the Tower of Midgard's gate.<br>
An entity that should not exist, yet somehow felt hauntingly familiar.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Otto von Alvensleben：</span><br>
I keep rubbing my eyes, but it's not going away!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Jade：</span><br>
That's no illusion, silly!<br>
It's flooding me with pings and rendering my radar completely useless!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ulrich von Hutten：</span><br>
The tallest building... Why does it seem like I've seen it before?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Regensburg：</span><br>
Have you? Where?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ulrich von Hutten：</span><br>
I can't quite tell from here. I need to get a bit closer.<br>
Gneisenau, come along, will you? You too, Zuikaku. Might need your planes.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Bismarck Zwei：</span><br>
You should use the elevator to get up to the viewing platform.<br>
It's the highest point on the tower and should give you a better view.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Jade：</span><br>
Heads up! I've spotted a Siren fleet within range of the facility!<br>
...Huh, that's odd. They appear coordinated, yet they're not attacking us.<br>
Wait, they seem to be fighting "something"...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Bismarck Zwei：</span><br>
What do you mean by that?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Jade：</span><br>
I... I can't get clear visuals on it all. It's like... my recon planes can't focus in on it at all!<br>
The shape is so vague I can't even tell if it's a plane or a person...<br>
It's almost as if it's wrapped in some sort of living fog... Solid, yet not really.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Regensburg：</span><br>
That doesn't tell us anything at all. Can you try taking a picture of it?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Jade：</span><br>
It's worth a shot, but don't expect anything.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Otto von Alvensleben：</span><br>
A vaguely-shaped mass of mist... You sure that's not a ghost?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Bismarck Zwei：</span><br>
(An unidentifiable "something"... That sounds similar to what Queen Elizabeth encountered when Bon Homme Richard pursued her.)<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Regensburg：</span><br>
Alright, we'll just have to get closer. I'll send in Regina.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Bismarck Zwei：</span><br>
("Please fight until the last light has faded"...)<br>
<span style="color:#ff9900;">U-556 META?：</span><br>
Lord Bismarck, do you think we should all split up?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Bismarck Zwei：</span><br>
Yes. You can come with me and search the control center for potential leads.<br>
Ulrich, Zuikaku, Gneisenau, head up to the observation deck and see what you can figure out about the city in the sky.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ulrich von Hutten：</span><br>
That's what I was gonna do anyway.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Bismarck Zwei：</span><br>
Regensburg, Otto, Jade, stand guard outside the facility and keep an eye on the Sirens and this unidentified enemy.<br>
Whatever you do, don't intervene, and don't get too close.<br>
Let the two sides wear each other out.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Regensburg：</span><br>
Understood.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Bismarck Zwei：</span><br>
And remember, stay vigilant at all times.<br>
Our comms should still work at this range. Report anything you find.<br>

<br>
Mirror Sea - α phase, tower observation deck<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Zuikaku：</span><br>
Whoooa! The view from up here is amazing!<br>
Is it this good up on the original Tower of Midgard as well?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ulrich von Hutten：</span><br>
Do you mean the Floating Fortress's control tower?<br>
The view's not too bad, but we normally don't let unauthorized personnel onto the deck.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Zuikaku：</span><br>
Dang. It's a great place to do recon from...<br>
I mean, heck, you can make out every detail of that massive city up here.<br>
Speaking of, now that you've had a closer look, does anything jump out to you?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ulrich von Hutten：</span><br>
Sort of.<br>
It doesn't really match the architectural style of the Sirens.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Zuikaku：</span><br>
Yeah. Now that you mention it, it almost looks like something... humans would build.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ulrich von Hutten：</span><br>
It doesn't mean much when they've copied us time and time again, but that's not important. Take a look at that huge tower in the middle.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Zuikaku：</span><br>
In the dead center? Hmm, yeah, that one doesn't look anything like the other buildings surrounding it.<br>
If you ask me, it looks more like...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ulrich von Hutten：</span><br>
The tower we saw in Compiler's mainframe when we took the fight to her.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Zuikaku：</span><br>
I thought the same thing! Does that mean... this Mirror Sea might be another Siren's mainframe?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ulrich von Hutten：</span><br>
It's a possibility.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Zuikaku：</span><br>
I'm thinking... Gneisenau said that The Hermit is behind the attack on the Fortress.<br>
There's no way this tower is supposed to be her mainframe, right? Ahaha...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ulrich von Hutten：</span><br>
Your guess is as good as mine. None of us have ever seen an Arbiter's mainframe with our own eyes.<br>
Not to mention, it would be immensely illogical.<br>
Their mainframe allows them to essentially come back to life endlessly.<br>
I can't think of any reason they'd willingly expose themselves like this.<br>
<span style="color:#ff9900;">Gneisenau META：</span><br>
Unless, they're trying to bait us into attacking it?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ulrich von Hutten：</span><br>
Highly unlikely. There's no way in hell we'd ever have the firepower to assault an Arbiter mainframe head-on.<br>
If she wanted to get rid of us, she could easily overwhelm us with her vessels.<br>
<span style="color:#ff9900;">Gneisenau META：</span><br>
No, you're right. Why waste time on setting an elaborate trap when she could get rid of us in a fraction of the time?<br>
Perhaps her goal is to force us inside the city, then.<br>
I could see her thinking that we'd feel pressured to look for a place to flee the red sea once it starts closing in on us.<br>
This city in the sky would be the obvious option in such a scenario.<br>
Especially if she provided the means for us to reach it...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ulrich von Hutten：</span><br>
She wants to corner us for some reason, is what you're saying?<br>
Still seems easier to just kill us and be done with it. One thing's for sure – we're in no condition to take on an Arbiter or a mainframe right now.<br>
I say we head back. Let's ask Bismarck what we should do next.<br>
{{折叠面板|内容结束}}

{{折叠面板|标题=Vision - Bismarck|选项=17|主框=1|样式=primary|展开=是}}
<br>
Mirror Sea - α phase, control center<br>
<span style="color:#ff9900;">U-556 META?：</span><br>
So this is where you found Ulrich, trapped in a nightmare...<br>
Are you sure it's a good idea to use the dome projector, Lord Bismarck?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Bismarck Zwei：</span><br>
It's the quickest way to get a grasp on what this place really is.<br>
All you need to do is keep an eye on me. If something happens to me, hit me with a dummy round.<br>
<span style="color:#ff9900;">U-556 META?：</span><br>
O-okay! I'll try my best not to hurt you with it!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Bismarck Zwei：</span><br>
Heh. That would be preferable, yes.<br>
<br>
Bismarck deployed her rigging and started to divert resources into anti-corruption measures as before, getting ready to place her hand on the dome's surface.<br>
Instantly, her vision distorted like ripples moving across a lake's surface.<br>
When she opened her eyes again, she once more found herself in that burning graveyard, with Friedrich collapsed on the ground next to her.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Bismarck Zwei：</span><br>
This was Ulrich's deepest fear, the root of her nightmares.<br>
But I was the one to touch the dome this time, not her.<br>
<br>
She rose to her feet, called her rigging, and looked around the area.<br>
The metallic dragon slowly rose into the sky, conveying large amounts of information to Bismarck in real time.<br>
It did not take long for her to locate the "edge" of the nightmare.<br>
Beyond the edge of the burning graveyard was a thick wall of inscrutable black fog. Even one glance at it was enough to make one's stomach turn.<br>
Through Geryon's eyes, however, she could catch a glimpse beyond the fog – of something moving, stirring.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Bismarck Zwei：</span><br>
What is that...?! Geryon, get closer! Blow away that fog!<br>
<span style="color:#ff9900;">Geryon：</span><br>
ROOOAAAR!<br>
<br>
Geryon let loose a piercing roar, the shockwave blowing away the black fog just enough to expose what lay below – a jet-black aircraft, with a red core that glistened like a sinister eye.<br>
At the exact same moment the fog parted, a flash of light appeared on the horizon for just a moment.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Bismarck Zwei：</span><br>
Is it... beckoning me closer?<br>
No, that light wasn't meant for me... It's what led Ulrich to this Mirror Sea!<br>
<br>
KABOOOM!<br>
<span style="color:#ff9900;">Geryon：</span><br>
ROOOAAAR!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Bismarck Zwei：</span><br>
An ambush?! Geryon, come back! Defensive position!<br>
<br>
The red eye fixed on her seemed to glare harshly, and patterns of light soon appeared one after another across the mangled wreckages of the mass-produced ships.<br>
They lurched to life, aiming their weapons at Bismarck.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Bismarck Zwei：</span><br>
Is that strange plane... controlling these Siren husks?<br>
Setting secondary guns to automatic fire. Geryon, use your main battery to take out that command unit!<br>
<span style="color:#ff9900;">Geryon：</span><br>
ROOOAAAR!<br>
<br>
The steel dragon flapped its wings and set sights on the Siren aircraft.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Bismarck Zwei：</span><br>
Let's see what's behind that mask of yours!<br>
<br>
The instant her cannons fired, Bismarck was abruptly whisked away back to reality.<br>
<span style="color:#ff9900;">U-556 META?：</span><br>
Lord Bismarck! Wake up!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Bismarck Zwei：</span><br>
What happened? Did I start acting up?<br>
<span style="color:#ff9900;">U-556 META?：</span><br>
No, you were fine! Jade warned us that a humanoid Siren is coming this way, and fast!<br>
She scrambled her aircraft to intercept, but they were all shot down immediately!<br>
And that's not the worst part! Zuikaku said the enemy is The Hermit herself!<br>
...Sorry for waking you up, but I had to, or else everyone would be in danger!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Bismarck Zwei：</span><br>
(I was this close to finding something out, too... But, we'll need to deal with this threat before I can try again.)<br>
Thanks, U-556. Come with me, but don't attack unless I order you to.<br>
<span style="color:#ff9900;">U-556 META?：</span><br>
Okay! I promise I won't!<br>
{{折叠面板|内容结束}}

{{折叠面板|标题=The Arbiter's Arrival|选项=18|主框=1|样式=primary|展开=是}}
<br>
Mirror Sea - α phase<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Bismarck Zwei：</span><br>
Sorry I'm late. How's the battle?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ulrich von Hutten：</span><br>
Stressful, but we're somehow managing.<br>
Zuikaku swears otherwise, but I'm pretty sure this is only one of The Hermit's vessels.<br>
It still packs a punch, but I can tell that it operates like a Pawn in certain regards.<br>
But now that you're back, we don't need to hold this turf anymore.<br>
Let's put some distance between us and this thing, so it'll go back to fighting that blob of mist again.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Bismarck Zwei：</span><br>
(Wait, the moment this thing started targeting us is when I tried to attack the fog beyond the nightmare. What could this mean...)<br>
There's no point trying to run. It's specifically targeting us.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Zuikaku：</span><br>
Then we'll just have to turn it to scrap.<br>
If Akagi can defeat an Arbiter vessel, there's no reason we can't!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Bismarck Zwei：</span><br>
(Akagi did what...?)<br>
...As long as we're quick, we should go undetected by that unidentified enemy.<br>
Everyone, get ready for battle!<br>
<br>
<br>
KABOOOM!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Otto von Alvensleben：</span><br>
Haha! Can't touch this!<br>
Arbiter-like threat, my ass! It only knows how to blindly attack what's in front of it!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Regensburg：</span><br>
Is this really the best it can do without its master giving it orders?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Jade：</span><br>
Hold on, guys! Don't get too ahead of yourselves just yet!<br>
I've been keeping tabs on its movements, and it's been steadily advancing towards the tower as if we're just afterthoughts!<br>
Hell, it's had plenty of opportunities to intercept my planes, but doesn't seem to care at all!<br>
<span style="color:#ec5d53;">Arbiter: The Hermit IX：</span><br>
……………………<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Zuikaku：</span><br>
I knew it! I thought something wasn't quite right.<br>
Why would it do that, though? Does it want to bomb the tower?<br>
No, wait, that's it! If it destroys the gate, we'll be stuck here forever!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Bismarck Zwei：</span><br>
There's no way to know that's what it's really after.<br>
Regardless, the risk is too great to let it near the tower.<br>
We must stop it here, once and for all!<br>
Regensburg, Otto, Jade, Zuikaku, work together to shoot down its aircraft!<br>
Meanwhile, Ulrich, Gneisenau, and I will destroy the vessel itself!<br>
<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Bismarck Zwei：</span><br>
All guns, straight ahead! Fire!<br>
<br>
Again and again, the sound of cannon fire rang out across the vast ocean. The very surface of the water seemed to be evaporating from their fierce assault.<br>
<span style="color:#ff9900;">Gneisenau META：</span><br>
I've broken through its armor! A few more volleys should do it!<br>
<br>
KABOOOM!<br>
<span style="color:#ff9900;">Gneisenau META：</span><br>
What was that?!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Bismarck Zwei：</span><br>
We're getting flanked?!<br>
<span style="color:#ff9900;">{namecode:515}？：</span><br>
It's the unidentified enemy, Lord Bismarck! We're under attack!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ulrich von Hutten：</span><br>
Bastard... How'd it get this close to us?!<br>
<span style="color:#ff9900;">Gneisenau META：</span><br>
What even is that thing? I still can't tell from this distance–<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Bismarck Zwei：</span><br>
Gneisenau! Watch out!!<br>
<span style="color:#ff9900;">Geryon：</span><br>
Graaaar...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Bismarck Zwei：</span><br>
Urgh...! What's with this insane firepower?! How are we supposed to––<br>
No, this won't be our end! Everyone, get behind me!!<br>
<span style="color:#ff9900;">Geryon：</span><br>
ROOOAAAR!<br>
<br>
Bismarck mounted her rigging and flew forward, turning herself into the wall separating her friends from the enemy.<br>
Moments before impact, she saw her life flash before her eyes. Even Geryon let out a warning cry.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Bismarck Zwei：</span><br>
We shall fight! Until the last light has faded!<br>
<br>
Was it an explosion tearing through her body? A blunt force battering her around? Or a massive shockwave trying to turn her inside out? Even Bismarck herself could not tell.<br>
All she knew was that countless waves of pure malice were crashing into her, threatening to tear her asunder, forming crystalline black deposits on Geryon's wings.<br>
Beneath its unrelenting onslaught, even her massive rigging seemed like little more than a dingy rowboat trapped in a hurricane.<br>
Yet, she and her friends continued to cling on for dear life.<br>
Though the boat was tossed around mercilessly by the storm and waves, it never capsized.<br>
As the shock from the initial attack wore off, the deposits on Geryon's wings faded away like dust in the wind.<br>
The storm died down, and the seas were calm once more.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Jade：</span><br>
*pant*... *pant*... Phew...<br>
I thought we were all done for...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Otto von Alvensleben：</span><br>
Is... Is it over? Please tell me it's over!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Regensburg：</span><br>
The Arbiter, the Sirens, and that strange enemy are all just... gone.<br>
We probably would be too, were it not for Geryon. Good boy.<br>
<span style="color:#ff9900;">Geryon：</span><br>
RAAAWR♪<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Zuikaku：</span><br>
Holy crap... Not even an Arbiter's vessel could survive whatever that was...<br>
But considering how dumb its tactics were, maybe that's to be expected.<br>
<span style="color:#ff9900;">U-556 META?：</span><br>
You did it, Lord Bismarck! The tower is safe now!<br>
So, what now? Do we use the gate? The red sea will reach the tower if it expands again!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ulrich von Hutten：</span><br>
I'd say so. It's not like there's anything else we can do, and it feels like the way forward.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Bismarck Zwei：</span><br>
And go into the upside-down city, you mean?<br>
It's a risky gamble... Or so I'd say, but we truly don't have any other option.<br>
Let's go. Back to the tower, everyone.<br>
<span style="color:#ff9900;">Gneisenau META：</span><br>
(How did she block that attack? Not even one of the Ashes could...)<br>
(No matter how advanced her Zwei rigging is, it cannot possibly be immune to corruption.)<br>
Bismarck, I must know... What is the Zwei rigging, exactly?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Bismarck Zwei：</span><br>
I once fell because I used the Black Cube and tasted the powers of "META." Zwei is the power that goes beyond my past limitations.<br>
It is the power that will lead Iron Blood forwards.<br>

{{折叠面板|标题=Vision - Zuikaku|选项=19|主框=1|样式=primary|展开=是}}
<br>
Before reaching the gate, Zuikaku remembered a familiar scene from another Mirror Sea.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Zuikaku：</span><br>
Huh? Is this the Sanctuary? Why am I here?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Shoukaku?：</span><br>
Remember what I said? About keeping your promise?<br>
And then I died, just like that.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Zuikaku：</span><br>
Shoukaku...?<br>
No, this isn't right. The you I saw in the Sanctuary wasn't...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Shoukaku?：</span><br>
Real? Are you sure?<br>
Are you sure your memory is correct?<br>
Actually, never mind. Come closer, will you?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Zuikaku：</span><br>
You're not my sister. Who are you?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Shoukaku?：</span><br>
Come to me, Zuikaku... I've missed you~<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Zuikaku：</span><br>
Bullcrap! I know what you're up to!<br>
This is just a nightmare, and you're the one who planted those hallucinations in Akagi and Kaga!<br>
<span style="color:#ec5d53;">Shoukaku?：</span><br>
Oh, how I wish you'd listen to your sister... Heehee...<br>
<br>
Shoukaku's phantom disintegrated into a black matter which spread in all directions to engulf Zuikaku.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Zuikaku：</span><br>
You're gonna pay for impersonating my sis!<br>
Hiyaaah!<br>
<br>
Zuikaku drew her blade. In a flash of light, her shikigami aircraft materialized and effortlessly tore through the black substance.<br>
Or she thought. The bits of matter started crawling towards each other, forming once more into several figures.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Zuikaku：</span><br>
Looks like you're not gonna let me walk out of this nightmare, huh?<br>
But don't think you can break my will just by outnumbering me.<br>
We're in the Sanctuary after all, and this is my home turf! Come at me, and do your worst!<br>
<br>
Despite her confident retorts, Zuikaku tightly gripped the hilt of her sword.<br>
The sound of windchimes rang lightly in her ears, followed by the rhythmic, almost serene crashing of waves.<br>
The next thing she knew, she stood in front of a procession of torii gates leading into the distance.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Zuikaku：</span><br>
Huh? The vision changed? What is it this time?<br>
Whew... Need to stop, breathe, and think for a bit.<br>
The first one was in the Sanctuary with an impostor of Shoukaku, and she suddenly split into a bunch of shadows...<br>
And then... Yeah, I heard the sound of windchimes, and then I was here.<br>
But that doesn't tell me a thing about where I am.<br>
<br>
As she looked around, she once again heard the sound of windchimes from further ahead of her, up a series of stairs.<br>
She looked up the stairs and saw the fuzzy figure of a person.<br>
She squinted, and as the figure slowly came into focus, she suddenly felt a wave of nostalgia, warmth, and safety wash over her.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Zuikaku：</span><br>
Wait! You're...<br>
<br>
But as soon as she reached out, she was pulled from her vision by the loud explosion.<br>
<span style="color:#ff9900;">Gneisenau META：</span><br>
What's wrong? Why'd you stop moving all of a sudden?<br>
We're not at the gate yet. It's a bit further up ahead.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Zuikaku：</span><br>
Oh, uh, I'm fine! I remembered a weird dream from a while ago, that's all.<br>
<span style="color:#ff9900;">Gneisenau META：</span><br>
Ah, sorry about that. I had to do something, and didn't have any other method on hand.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Zuikaku：</span><br>
It's fine, don't apologize! You only did what you had to do to wake me up, and it's not like I got hurt or anything.<br>
Anyway, sorry for wasting time! Let's catch up with the others!<br>

<br>
Mirror Sea - ω phase<br>
The gate vibrated as it came to life once more.<br>
Contrary to Ulrich's expectations, however, it was not the city in the sky that awaited on the other end.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ulrich von Hutten：</span><br>
We didn't get to the city or the mainframe, huh...<br>
My assumptions from before were a bit optimistic after all.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Regensburg：</span><br>
Hey, see that around us? The red and blue zones in the sea have swapped places!<br>
And that's not all. The Tower of Midgard seems to be receiving that beam of light instead of emitting it!<br>
<br>
Everyone started surveying their surroundings. Indeed, everything around them had changed drastically.<br>
The city in the sky was gone without a trace, and the celestial bodies were back in their proper places.<br>
And, from somewhere up on high, a pillar of light beamed endlessly into the heart of the Tower of Midgard, as if everything had been inverted.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ulrich von Hutten：</span><br>
Seems like we were thrown back out between the red and blue zones, just like before.<br>
Except this time, we'd have to cross the red zone to get back to the tower.<br>
Bismarck, I believe we should confirm the properties of the water before we proceed.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Bismarck Zwei：</span><br>
I agree. It would be ideal to collect samples from a few locations to assess how dangerous it is.<br>
Jade, is it possible to do that using your aircraft?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Jade：</span><br>
It should be. I'll give it a try, at least.<br>
<br>
Everyone kept their eyes on Jade's plane as it skimmed delicately over the surface of the foreboding water with a container in tow.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Otto von Alvensleben：</span><br>
What the hell? You can even do THAT with your aircraft?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Jade：</span><br>
What can I say? Good girls practice their technique~<br>
<br>
Some time later...<br>
Ulrich rocked the test tubes containing water samples from both the red and blue zones, analyzing them through the light coming from the Tower of Midgard.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ulrich von Hutten：</span><br>
Clear and colorless. There's nothing unusual about either of 'em.<br>
They're both regular saltwater.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Zuikaku：</span><br>
Wait, what? Then how come one looks red and the other doesn't?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ulrich von Hutten：</span><br>
Based on what I've seen, I have reason to believe that this Mirror Sea has multiple "states."<br>
Think about it. The column of light, the sea changing whenever we use the gate, and the sky and sea being reversed.<br>
What causes all of these phenomena are basically sets of "rules" imposed by the Mirror Sea.<br>
In other words, the water here has no inherent properties other than what the current set of rules dictates.<br>
...Which is why I have two ordinary test tubes of sea water in my hands now.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Zuikaku：</span><br>
Lemme get this straight... This place is basically "projecting" colors onto the sea?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ulrich von Hutten：</span><br>
That's a simplified way of understanding it. Except instead of projecting a color, the Mirror Sea is capable of projecting properties.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Zuikaku：</span><br>
Woah, that's pretty crazy... How big of a projector would you need to do something on that scale?<br>
But I guess the more important question is, are these properties you're referring to dangerous?<br>
If I remember properly, Gneisenau said something about the red area seeming to be dangerous?<br>
<span style="color:#ff9900;">Gneisenau META：</span><br>
Yes, I did feel META corruption coming from the red zone... But nothing from these test tubes.<br>
It certainly lends credence to your theory, but I can't say I've seen anything like this before.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Bismarck Zwei：</span><br>
It wouldn't surprise me if this Mirror Sea is projecting information onto its surrounding environment, but it's still just a theory at this point.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Zuikaku：</span><br>
That's pretty crazy, but it does sound like something the Sirens would be able to pull off!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Bismarck Zwei：</span><br>
Take it with a grain of salt for now. We'll need to gather more evidence before we can make any sort of conclusive claims.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Zuikaku：</span><br>
Then, uh, the only thing we can do is move forward, right?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Bismarck Zwei：</span><br>
Yes. Besides, we can't just sit around here forever doing nothing. We have to return to the Tower of Midgard one way or another.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Jade：</span><br>
Uh oh, Bismarck! I'm detecting some enemy signals from right behind us!<br>
They appear to be the same type as the ones we encountered when we first got here! And it's a whole army of them!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Bismarck Zwei：</span><br>
Awfully convenient timing. Almost as if they're trying to force us into the red zone.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Zuikaku：</span><br>
If we're gonna have to fight them anyway, we might as well engage them on our own terms!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Bismarck Zwei：</span><br>
Agreed. Our resources are limited, so we should avoid fighting battles of attrition.<br>
Let's head straight for the tower. We should be far away enough to avoid the bulk of their fleet.<br>
Geryon and I will do what we can to keep everyone safe, but do act quickly and decisively.<br>
Time is of the essence! Let's get going!<br>
{{折叠面板|内容结束}}

{{折叠面板|标题=Traces|选项=21|主框=1|样式=primary|展开=是}}
<br>
KABOOOM!<br>
The girls sailed forward as quickly as possible while moving in a tight formation, Bismarck and Geryon acting as sword and shield for the fleet.<br>
Despite the palpable danger of the red zone, the group was able to traverse through it without losing combat effectiveness.<br>
After losing a significant chunk of their pursuing forces, the Sirens began to fade from sight, signaling an end to the offensive.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Jade：</span><br>
My, my. Autonomous riggings sure look frightening, but aren't you the goodest boy ever~<br>
<span style="color:#ff9900;">Geryon：</span><br>
......<br>
<br>
Bismarck's rigging cocked its three heads, unable to understand what Jade meant.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Bismarck Zwei：</span><br>
A rigging's personality depends on its wielder... Hm?<br>
<br>
Sensing something, Bismarck quietly placed her hand on her rigging.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Bismarck Zwei：</span><br>
(Traces of META activity...?)<br>
<br>
Communicating with her rigging was fairly simple, as it was like her second half. She quickly noticed a response from her beacon tracker.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Regensburg：</span><br>
Is something the matter, Bismarck?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Bismarck Zwei：</span><br>
Looks like we're not the only ones out here.<br>
Another META ship has been active here.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Jade：</span><br>
What?<br>
<br>
Everyone instinctively turned their eyes towards Gneisenau.<br>
<span style="color:#ff9900;">Gneisenau META：</span><br>
Please, there's no way it's me. Surely you don't think Bismarck would bring up this subject as a joke?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Zuikaku：</span><br>
No, you're right.<br>
Wouldn't you have sensed something, though? You're a META yourself, and you keep talking about your instincts.<br>
<span style="color:#ff9900;">Gneisenau META：</span><br>
Unfortunately, this entire sector seems to have traces of META corruption as far as I'm concerned, so I'm the least useful person here in that regard.<br>
Besides, we all have our own unique signals, so I have no way of recognizing someone I don't know.<br>
You have those fancy beacon trackers, don't you? I reckon you'll have better luck using those than asking me for help.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Otto von Alvensleben：</span><br>
...Uhh, about that.<br>
This was kind of an emergency operation, and META beacon trackers don't exactly come cheap...<br>
Come to think of it, Bismarck, how'd you find this META in the first place?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Bismarck Zwei：</span><br>
I installed a beacon tracker on Geryon before we departed. I've already cross-checked the signal with our database.<br>
Whoever it is, I can safely say we've never encountered them before.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Regensburg：</span><br>
Huh? You baked a beacon tracker into Geryon on top of all the insane stuff he already can do?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Bismarck Zwei：</span><br>
Well, it's not that inconceivable. Geryon was specifically designed with combatting META corruption in mind, so a beacon tracker would naturally be part of his core functions.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Regensburg：</span><br>
Argh... I'm so JEALOUS... But also so impressed at the same time!! Write that down, Regina!<br>
<span style="color:#ff9900;">Gneisenau META：</span><br>
An unknown quantity, huh...<br>
Think she might be connected with that unknown entity we faced earlier?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Zuikaku：</span><br>
Huh? Can you create those black shockwaves as well?<br>
<span style="color:#ff9900;">Gneisenau META：</span><br>
No, that's not what I meant.<br>
It's just... I think I saw something like it before.<br>
I once had a friend who was undergoing METAmorphosis... She was determined to fight until her final breath.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Zuikaku：</span><br>
Oh... Sorry, I didn't mean to bring back tragic memories.<br>
<span style="color:#ff9900;">Gneisenau META：</span><br>
It's alright. Few can put up a fight against that kind of power.<br>
In any case, if these energy traces are still fresh, the person behind it should still be nearby. And, expect her to wield tremendous power.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ulrich von Hutten：</span><br>
Strong, by META standards? Think it might be one of the Ashes?<br>
<span style="color:#ff9900;">Gneisenau META：</span><br>
One of the Ashes could certainly fit the bill.<br>
Unlike us, they don't care about collateral damage. They would have no issue with razing the whole tower should it stand in their way.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ulrich von Hutten：</span><br>
(If she's anything like Scharnhorst, there's a good chance we can negotiate with her.)<br>
(Should worse come to worst and we're forced to fight an Arbiter, she could be the ace up our sleeve.)<br>
(Hell, maybe she even knows where Friedrich's gone off to.)<br>
(I know what I saw in that hallucination wasn't real, but I still want to know...)<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Bismarck Zwei：</span><br>
......<br>
In hindsight, it makes sense. We probably weren't the unknown enemy's intended targets.<br>
Whoever this META is, we should look for her.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ulrich von Hutten：</span><br>
I'll do it. Just give me the order.<br>
If she's from the Ashes, she should sympathize with the situation we're in!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Bismarck Zwei：</span><br>
Hm? Ah, yes.<br>
Whether she ultimately ends up being a friend or a foe, this is a lead we at least should pursue.<br>
But first, we need to make sure we're in a safe area – head for the Tower of Midgard's control room!<br>

<br>
Mirror Sea - ω phase<br>
<span style="color:#ff9900;">U-556 META?：</span><br>
Lord Bismarck, wouldn't it be smart to patrol the area?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Bismarck Zwei：</span><br>
No need. I'll have my hands full with touching up Regensburg's rigging.<br>
In the meantime, I want to discuss the Mirror Sea's structure with someone. Will you stay?<br>
<span style="color:#ff9900;">U-556 META?：</span><br>
Of course! I'd do anything if it helps you out!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Bismarck Zwei：</span><br>
Heheh. Alright, then I'd like you to tell me what you think this place is.<br>
<span style="color:#ff9900;">U-556 META?：</span><br>
What it is? Uhhhh... Hmmmm...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Bismarck Zwei：</span><br>
Don't think too hard. Just tell me the first thing that comes to mind.<br>
<span style="color:#ff9900;">U-556 META?：</span><br>
In that case... A loop? Maybe an hourglass?<br>
Yeah, I think it's like an hourglass!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Bismarck Zwei：</span><br>
An hourglass?<br>
<span style="color:#ff9900;">U-556 META?：</span><br>
A really, reeeally big one.<br>
Like, you know how at first, everything was red other than the area around the Tower?<br>
And every time we used the gate, we ended up in the same place, but the red sea was getting closer...<br>
Then, when we used it again after seeing the upside-down city, the red and blue were reversed!<br>
So I think the Tower is the middle of the hourglass, and the gate is the passage of time.<br>
The sea starts out blue, then gradually becomes red...<br>
And when it's all turned red, the hourglass is flipped, turning red sea back into blue sea...<br>
I've got it! If the red sea is sand, then us passing through the gate is what lets it fall through!<br>
I mean, look at the Tower. Its light beam has changed from blue to red. I think that indicates what's on the other side of the hourglass!<br>
And maybe the reason we saw the upside-down city is because we were standing on top of the sand!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Bismarck Zwei：</span><br>
This Mirror Sea is an hourglass, and the red sea represents sand falling down...<br>
Using the gate only transports us through time, not space, during which sand falls down, expanding the red sea.<br>
Hang on, that reminds me...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Zuikaku：</span><br>
Yeah, we were looking for Ulrich when we first arrived, and there was no red sea here at all.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ulrich von Hutten：</span><br>
......<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Zuikaku：</span><br>
Oh, uh, you were sleepwalking at the time, so it's natural you wouldn't remember it.<br>
While I can't be 100% sure, I think Jade was the first to observe the red sea.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ulrich von Hutten：</span><br>
(All I did remember from my episode is going through the gate and heading straight for the control center... No, wait, there's one more thing.)<br>
Those giant cubes. I don't remember them being there.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Zuikaku：</span><br>
Huh? That's weird. Gneisenau and I definitely saw them when we first got here.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Regensburg：</span><br>
If what Ulrich said is true, and the cubes aren't based on some kind of timetable, we must've done something to cause them to appear.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Bismarck Zwei：</span><br>
(Ulrich said that when she first arrived, there was no sign of the red sea, or those floating cubes.)<br>
(After Ulrich activated the tower, Zuikaku and Gneisenau came through and saw the floating cubes, but not the red sea.)<br>
(By the time I arrived, the red sea was already present, and with each activation of the tower, the red area grew more and more.)<br>
(When we saw the upside-down city, that must've been when all the "sand" had passed through one phase.)<br>
(Then, there's the corrosion effect of the red sea, the METAmorphosis phenomenon, and the unknown enemies that appear from the red waters...)<br>
(But if we assume that this Mirror Sea houses a Siren Arbiter's mainframe, why would those things be here? Unless...)<br>
...Oh my god!<br>
<span style="color:#ff9900;">U-556 META?：</span><br>
What's wrong, Lord Bismarck? You look pale!<br>
I think my guess might be wrong after all...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Bismarck Zwei：</span><br>
Ugh... Sorry, I didn't mean to make you worry.<br>
I'm working with a number of assumptions here, but it's best if we act quickly.<br>
Come with me, U-556. We're going back to the control center.<br>
<span style="color:#ff9900;">U-556 META?：</span><br>
Wh-what is that?<br>
<br>
In place of the previous vision of Friedrich, the dome in the central control room displayed a new, rather ill-boding image.<br>
<span style="color:#ff9900;">U-556 META?：</span><br>
All of Iron Blood has been defeated?!<br>
<br>
Heaps of wreckages floating in a burning sea. Among them were the girls of Iron Blood, including Bismarck's sister, Tirpitz.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Bismarck Zwei：</span><br>
Calm down. It's not real.<br>
(My corrosion sensor is responding, though. This place really does connect to the throat of the hourglass.)<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Communicator：</span><br>
BEEP BEEP BEEP!<br>
<span style="color:#ff9900;">Gneisenau META：</span><br>
Bismarck, we've finished surveying the nearby waters. There seems to be nothing of note here.<br>
The other META's trail also seems to have vanished, I'm afraid.<br>
<span style="color:#ff9900;">Geryon：</span><br>
......<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ulrich von Hutten：</span><br>
Don't draw conclusions just yet, Gneisenau. We're bound to find a lead on her if we keep looking.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Bismarck Zwei：</span><br>
I admire your drive, but pursuing a wild goose chase will only squander our finite resources.<br>
If the META is here, we'll run into her sooner or later. If she's already left, we'll gain nothing by searching for her.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ulrich von Hutten：</span><br>
...Alright. We'll head back to the Tower.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Bismarck Zwei：</span><br>
Meet me at the gate. I have a theory I'd like to prove.<br>
<span style="color:#ff9900;">U-556 META?：</span><br>
Are you sure about this, Lord Bismarck?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Bismarck Zwei：</span><br>
It'll be fine. The corruption in the control center is dormant for now.<br>
Now, as for my theory... Use your communicator to relay a message to everyone.<br>
"I strongly believe this Mirror Sea is structured like an hourglass."<br>
"We are going to test if the gate advances the passage of time and makes the red sea, symbolizing sand, expand or not."<br>
"If the red sea does not expand, or if it thins out, that means we're on the top side of the hourglass."<br>
<span style="color:#ff9900;">U-556 META?：</span><br>
Ah! So once all the sand is gone, we can safely investigate the city at the hourglass' throat!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Bismarck Zwei：</span><br>
I've not made my mind on that just yet. We'd need to find a way to get there, too.<br>
As I was saying... "Conversely, if the red sea does expand, that means we are on the bottom side."<br>
"We must find a way out of this place as soon as possible, before the corruption bears down on us."<br>

<br>
Mirror Sea - ω phase<br>
The Tower of Midgard glowed brightly, and the party once again stepped through the gate.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Regensburg：</span><br>
Bismarck, the red zone is even bigger this time.<br>
It even looks like we were dropped off farther away from the tower than before.<br>
<span style="color:#ff9900;">U-556 META?：</span><br>
Does that mean we've basically moved backwards?<br>
It's as if the sand falling from the top keeps pushing us farther and farther away.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Bismarck Zwei：</span><br>
Going off our working theory, yes.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Zuikaku：</span><br>
So basically, the corrupting stuff is raining from the sky?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Bismarck Zwei：</span><br>
Not literally, but expect to see it manifest in the form of that black mist from before, or perhaps that unknown enemy.<br>
<span style="color:#ff9900;">Geryon：</span><br>
ROOOAAAR!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Bismarck Zwei：</span><br>
Speak of the devil.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Zuikaku：</span><br>
Yeah, my aircraft have spotted something too!<br>
A swarm of indiscernable blobs are pouring out of the Tower! They're heading straight for us!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Jade：</span><br>
First they went for the Tower, now they're coming out of it... What a bother.<br>
Karma must be mad at me for being such a good girl all the time~<br>
What shall we do, Bismarck? Run for our lives?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Bismarck Zwei：</span><br>
(These things seem to be able to materialize hull-corroding attacks. I don't want to push my luck with them twice.)<br>
(On the other hand, the corrosion here isn't as bad as I expected... Depending on how we fight them, may be able to gather some valuable data.)<br>
Ulrich, take command. Bombard them to slow them down.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ulrich von Hutten：</span><br>
And what are you planning to do?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Bismarck Zwei：</span><br>
I have a theory I'd like to test. With me, Geryon!<br>
<span style="color:#ff9900;">Geryon：</span><br>
ROOOAAAR!<br>
<br>
Geryon's thrusters roared to life, and Bismarck broke formation to charge straight ahead.<br>
Right into the mass of the writhing, amorphous foes.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Otto von Alvensleben：</span><br>
Bismarck?! Wh-what is she thinking?!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ulrich von Hutten：</span><br>
She's the only one here who can neutralize their hull-corroding attacks.<br>
Most likely, she intends on using this opportunity to analyze exactly what those enemies are, up close and personal.<br>
Everyone! Give her the space she needs! Don't let those enemies overwhelm Bismarck!<br>
<br>
Although the colossal size of Bismarck's rigging made her an easy target, she managed to approach the enemies without taking much damage at all thanks to her fleet's covering fire.<br>
Without a moment to hesitate, she engaged anti-hull-corruption measures and closed in.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Bismarck Zwei：</span><br>
Even this close, I can't make out any details...<br>
<br>
Their very being seemed to defy description.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Bismarck Zwei：</span><br>
Then let's see how you respond to THIS!<br>
<br>
She stretched her hand out, palm aimed straight at the enemy.<br>
It responded almost like a parasite that had found a new host, emerging from its old one. It turned into a single string of mist before Bismarck absorbed it with her hand.<br>
It felt like nothing in her hand – like grasping smoke.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Bismarck Zwei：</span><br>
...Just as I thought. The sand isn't so tough.<br>
Geryon, can you keep going?<br>
<span style="color:#ff9900;">Geryon：</span><br>
ROOOAAAR!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Bismarck Zwei：</span><br>
Good boy. If you're worried about me, don't be.<br>
I know to stop before I reach my limit.<br>
<span style="color:#ff9900;">Geryon：</span><br>
ROOOAAAR...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Bismarck Zwei：</span><br>
(Simply shooting them should work if this is all they're made of. Time for the others to shine.)<br>

<br>
Mirror Sea - ω phase<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ulrich von Hutten：</span><br>
Bismarck, we've taken out most of those... things.<br>
So, did you get the answer to your theory?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Bismarck Zwei：</span><br>
Unfortunately, no.<br>
But, I didn't leave empty-handed.<br>
What I did learn is that those things are not Sirens of any kind that we know of.<br>
They appear more to be rough "projections" from some sort of entity, but it's as if our psyches are trying to reject them outright.<br>
While it's possible we're not designed to be able to perceive them, I fear they might be beings that transcend our cognition...<br>
Until we can shed light on their true form, I propose we call them "Shades" for now.<br>
In any case, we should try to steer clear of them until we have a better idea of what we're up against.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Zuikaku：</span><br>
Projections? You mentioned that before...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Bismarck Zwei：</span><br>
Yes. Think of them as the shadows cast off from light.<br>
There's one more thing I learned, and it's where we are in the hourglass...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ulrich von Hutten：</span><br>
So in short, the farther the red sea expands, the likelier we are into those manifestations of corruption.<br>
Damn those Sirens, their schemes just get more and more convoluted... Unless the corruption is somehow separate?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Zuikaku：</span><br>
What even is this corruption you keep talking about? Is it the reason why we've been having hallucinations?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Bismarck Zwei：</span><br>
Very likely. The last battle all but confirmed it for me.<br>
Corruption is advanced corrosion of the hull. In other words, the energy of METAmorphosis.<br>
The corrosion likely started to spread when Ulrich activated the Tower of Midgard, and has grown with each subsequent activation.<br>
When the corrosion reaches a critical threshold, those Shades from before start to appear.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Zuikaku：</span><br>
So let me get this straight, the Shades are an external corruption affecting the Sirens as well? Is that why the Sirens are trying to fight them off as well?<br>
<span style="color:#ff9900;">Gneisenau META：</span><br>
That makes sense, which also explains why The Hermit's vessels were largely ignoring us earlier and focusing on the tower instead.<br>
They're most likely trying to destroy it to sever the source of the corruption.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Zuikaku：</span><br>
So now my question is, how'd the corruption get inside in the first place? If this really is an external attack on the Arbiter's mainframe, how is it ever going to reach that upside-down city?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Bismarck Zwei：</span><br>
That could have something to do with why we were brought here in the first place.<br>
Our initial assessment - that this whole thing is a trap, appears to be correct. But it wasn't a trap laid by The Hermit.<br>
The Arbiters themselves are being targeted.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Zuikaku：</span><br>
Really? Do you think the Ashes are behind it? Maybe it has something to do with that unidentified META?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Bismarck Zwei：</span><br>
Unlikely. Even with all the tools in their arsenal, that kind of conceptual attack isn't something I'd associate with the Ashes.<br>
It's still possible they're responsible, given that not all METAs share the same goal.<br>
But, if they wanted to spread corruption through repeated use of the gate, they wouldn't need our help to do it.<br>
I'm more inclined to believe that like us, they were also lured in here...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ulrich von Hutten：</span><br>
Wait, Bismarck... It just dawned on me - the nightmares originated in our Floating Fortress, right? In other words...<br>
Whoever it is that launched this attack against an Arbiter mainframe... is somewhere out there in our world.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Bismarck Zwei：</span><br>
I'm afraid so. At least, their actions are disruptive enough to leave a lasting mark.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ulrich von Hutten：</span><br>
Damnit... We need to get back there this instant! We still have allies out there who don't know about the dangers we might be facing!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Bismarck Zwei：</span><br>
If there's anything you should've learned in my absence...<br>
Is that Iron Blood will continue to move forward, with or without my will.<br>
For now, we need to focus on escaping so that nobody else gets caught up in this plot.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Regensburg：</span><br>
The longer we take, the stronger the Shades will get...<br>
But how on earth are we supposed to get out of here?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Bismarck Zwei：</span><br>
We cannot use the Tower of Midgard any longer.<br>
Whoever set us up clearly factored our reliance upon the tower into their plans.<br>
It's hard to say what will happen once this entire Mirror Sea becomes a red zone, given what we currently know about its dangers.<br>
In any case, we need to keep moving, but perhaps not in the same way as before.<br>
This whole time, we've been fixated on the Tower of Midgard as the singular notable destination here, giving us the illusion that there's only one route.<br>
But, I also had Geryon searching for traces of the unknown META during the previous battle.<br>
And believe it or not, there were no traces of META energy.<br>
In other words, the unknown META took a completely different path from us that does not go through the Tower of Midgard.<br>
Finding that path is the next crucial step we must take.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Jade：</span><br>
Are you certain? I haven't seen anything that could possibly house something like a gate, other than the tower.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Bismarck Zwei：</span><br>
So it seems, but remember where we found Zuikaku and Gneisenau. They weren't in there.<br>
<br>
The two of them blacked out inside the control center, yet Bismarck's party found them somewhere else entirely.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Bismarck Zwei：</span><br>
Perhaps they were subjected to a hallucination and moved after losing consciousness, but that's all the more reason to investigate it.<br>
Why does the dome projector in the control room display a specific image to everyone who sees it, while everyone else has their own individual nightmares?<br>
What I'm inclined to believe... is that not all hallucinations come from the same source.<br>
Perhaps, the hallucinations themselves are similar to the way things are projected across this Mirror Sea.<br>
If the corruption can travel through the control room, it may also be a channel we can utilize.<br>
At the very least, it's worth investigating.<br>

<br>
Mirror Sea - ω phase<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Bismarck Zwei：</span><br>
The control center is ahead, Ulrich. I'll need your help.<br>
Gneisenau, take command while I'm gone. Secure the Tower of Midgard and make sure the control room is safe.<br>
<span style="color:#ff9900;">Gneisenau META：</span><br>
Me? But...<br>
...Alright. I'll do as you say.<br>
<br>
Tower of Midgard - Control center<br>
The two stepped into the command center. The projector dome's surface still continued to reflect the annihilated Iron Blood fleet.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ulrich von Hutten：</span><br>
Is this why you kept everyone away?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Bismarck Zwei：</span><br>
Yes. Sometimes, even fiction is not meant for everyone's eyes.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ulrich von Hutten：</span><br>
Yeah... Even if we rationally know something to be false, it is far harder to avoid having our emotions compromised.<br>
You brought me because I've already experienced this once, so it won't have the same effect on me, right?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Bismarck Zwei：</span><br>
That's not the only reason I brought you.<br>
Remember the other nightmares you told me about before?<br>
The black sun. The tower calling out to you. Friedrich lying dead in the water.<br>
Out of those three, only two were purposely meant to spur you into action.<br>
The third one with Friedrich is the odd one out. If anyone else here had seen it on the dome, they'd immediately dismiss it as fake.<br>
And yet, it showed it to you. It even showed it to me.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ulrich von Hutten：</span><br>
It showed it... to you?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Bismarck Zwei：</span><br>
It did. When I had that same nightmare, I caught a glimpse of what's controlling it.<br>
That's when something happened. As soon as I tried to attack it in the nightmare, that Arbiter vessel began attacking us in reality.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ulrich von Hutten：</span><br>
In other words... the nightmare on this screen is connected to the Mirror Sea, and...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Bismarck Zwei：</span><br>
That's right. In fact, what we see here might not be a "nightmare" at all, but rather a stable space that can be entered, exited, and manipulated.<br>
Which brings me back to a conclusion both Zuikaku and Queen Elizabeth reached independently: Mirror Seas seem to be malleable through "conceptualization."<br>
If this Mirror Sea shares a similar property, as long as we grasp this Mirror Sea's framework, we should be able to use the concept of an hourglass to direct us to the throat.<br>
I'm going to try something. During this time, I'll have no way of knowing what is taking place around me.<br>
Wake me up if we're under attack, or if I've been inside for too long.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ulrich von Hutten：</span><br>
Alright then. Don't get yourself killed.<br>
<br>
Bismarck reached out to touch the screen, and the scenery in front of her rippled like the surface of a lake.<br>
In an instant, the boundary between reality and dream blurred together once more.<br>
{{折叠面板|内容结束}}

{{折叠面板|标题=Vision - ???|选项=26|主框=1|样式=primary|展开=是}}
<br>
The air wafting above the ocean was still hot and rancid, irritating the nostrils.<br>
Bismarck rose to her feet and slowly looked around her.<br>
<span style="color:#ff9900;">Geryon：</span><br>
......<br>
<br>
Geryon rumbled with a hint of mechanical sorrow, whipping up a gale with its steel wings to clear the surrounding smoke and flame.<br>
There, in front of him, lay a lifeless phantasm in the image of Bismarck's sister.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Bismarck Zwei：</span><br>
Tirpitz...<br>
<br>
One of the dragon rigging's three heads brushed up against her hand, as if telling her to snap out of it.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Bismarck Zwei：</span><br>
Don't worry. I know none of this is real.<br>
......<br>
I know it isn't, but still...<br>
<br>
Bismarck took a deep breath, before turning around and mounting her rigging. Geryon's wings flapped and his engines fired, and the two gradually rose from the water's surface.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Bismarck Zwei：</span><br>
...Let's do what we came here for.<br>
Clear the mist and show us the way forward!<br>
<span style="color:#ff9900;">Geryon：</span><br>
ROOOAAAR!<br>
<br>
The wall of black mist along the outer border of the nightmare receded before the dragon's storm.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Bismarck Zwei：</span><br>
I don't see the aircraft from before, but there indeed is a path forward...<br>
<br>
Bismarck followed through the path into the mist opened by Geryon.<br>
The deeper she went in, the more the boundaries of the sea seemed to expand, seemingly reaching a scale of unfathomable proportions.<br>
After what felt like ages, a light finally appeared in front of her.<br>
<span style="color:#ff9900;">Geryon：</span><br>
ROOAAR...<br>
<br>
Sensing the significance of this discovery through his owner's excitement, Geryon let out a low growl and accelerated in the direction of the light.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Bismarck Zwei：</span><br>
This must be the way to the hourglass' throat!<br>
<br>
Without a hint of hesitation, Bismarck rushed directly through the light.<br>
–Not only in the nightmare, but also in reality.<br>
{{折叠面板|内容结束}}

{{折叠面板|标题=Lingering Echo|选项=27|主框=1|样式=primary|展开=是}}
<br>
When the blinding light faded, Bismarck opened her eyes once more to an apocalyptic hellscape.<br>
Beneath dilapidated structures half-submerged beneath the water, she saw the lonesome figure of a person.<br>
She was clad in religious attire, her back turned towards Bismarck. Her melancholic features were reflected onto the water by the ashen sun.<br>
Scattered around her were a number of glistening, gemstone-like objects.<br>
<span style="color:#ff9900;">Geryon：</span><br>
Grrrrrrrrr...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Bismarck Zwei：</span><br>
Who is that...?<br>
<br>
Bismarck signaled for Geryon to stand down, approaching the girl alone.<br>
Even as the girl's face came clearly into view, Bismarck's attention was instantly drawn to the objects around her.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Bismarck Zwei：</span><br>
Wisdom Cubes?!<br>
<br>
A number of shattered Wisdom Cube fragments lay scattered around the girl, appearing like gemstones at a pawn shop from a distance.<br>
<span style="color:#a020f0;">???：</span><br>
*sob*... Why did this have to happen...<br>
I was completely useless...<br>
I'm sorry... I'm so sorry...<br>
You were the ones fighting on the front lines, so why is it that I get to live on?<br>
You were supposed to get better...<br>
My job was to ensure that all of you survive...<br>
But I failed, and now I'm the only one left...<br>
What point is there to go on without you...?<br>
No... Maybe there's still time...<br>
I've gathered up this many pieces of you already...<br>
I just need to put you back together in the right order!<br>
I will bring you back, even if nothing of your old selves remain!<br>
<br>
The muttering woman suddenly fell to her knees and started scrabbling together the glittering fragments as if possessed.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Bismarck Zwei：</span><br>
What's the matter? What happened here?!<br>
<br>
The woman ignored her.<br>
Though blood dripped from her hands, that didn't stop her search for more glimmers of hope.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Bismarck Zwei：</span><br>
(This is not a phantasm... She's real. Is she a shipgirl who's been trapped in this place?)<br>
Excuse me. I need to talk to you.<br>
<br>
Bismarck gestured to Geryon, and the dragon let out a roar in an attempt to rouse the girl.<br>
Her expression cleared for a moment. Then, the girl blinked, and slowly turned to face Bismarck.<br>
Her tragic expression changed to a look of surprise, if only for a moment.<br>
<span style="color:#a020f0;">Vestal META：</span><br>
...This was once one of the largest, most prosperous cities.<br>
Now, it is nothing more than rubble beneath your feet.<br>
Over there is NY Port. On the other side, is where some of the world's most-renown architecture once stood.<br>
I never thought I'd see another shipgirl touring this place...<br>
Pleased to meet you. I am repair ship Vestal.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Bismarck Zwei：</span><br>
I am battleship Bismarck of Iron Blood. I take it you're a META.<br>
<span style="color:#a020f0;">Vestal META：</span><br>
That I am, yes.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Bismarck Zwei：</span><br>
Why are you here?<br>
<span style="color:#a020f0;">Vestal META：</span><br>
I could ask you the same. What brought you to this place?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Bismarck Zwei：</span><br>
I'm trying to save my comrades.<br>
<span style="color:#a020f0;">Vestal META：</span><br>
Your comrades? Not yourself?<br>
<br>
Vestal reached forward and gently placed her hand on Bismarck's rigging.<br>
<span style="color:#a020f0;">Vestal META：</span><br>
So that's why. You're unlike the others.<br>
<br>
Her curiosity piqued, Vestal stood up and looked intently into Bismarck's eyes.<br>
<span style="color:#a020f0;">Vestal META：</span><br>
You're hanging in there, but you must know that it's only a matter of time.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Bismarck Zwei：</span><br>
...I know.<br>
<span style="color:#a020f0;">Vestal META：</span><br>
Shh. Just listen to my diagnosis for now.<br>
The Wisdom Cube constituting your hull has undergone severe corrosion.<br>
So severe, that there are no known means to restore it to its original state.<br>
But, you are capable of shifting the concept of "Bismarck" into an external augmented hull, to avoid damage to your own Wisdom Cube.<br>
Am I correct?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Bismarck Zwei：</span><br>
How do you know all that?<br>
<span style="color:#a020f0;">Vestal META：</span><br>
Simple. I, too, am not the same person I used to be.<br>
It's an ingenious idea, but as long as you keep fighting, the corruption will continue to consume your hull.<br>
No matter how cautious you are, it will only get worse.<br>
<br>
Vestal gently caressed the steel beast.<br>
Geryon silently lowered its head, like an animal comfortable with being stroked.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Bismarck Zwei：</span><br>
...What are you doing?<br>
<span style="color:#a020f0;">Vestal META：</span><br>
Geryon – a warrior, but also a kindhearted cattle herder. What a lovely name. His three concepts suit him perfectly, too.<br>
I reinforced his frame a little to allow him to endure as much corruption as possible. Don't worry, this treatment is free.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Bismarck Zwei：</span><br>
(Not just that, you also made him run smoother...)<br>
(Is this your unique power as a META?)<br>
<span style="color:#a020f0;">Vestal META：</span><br>
Now, I assume you have other questions for me.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Bismarck Zwei：</span><br>
Not to be rude, but have you realized that this place is an illusion?<br>
<span style="color:#a020f0;">Vestal META：</span><br>
Thanks to you. This is a vision produced by the Tower of Midgard, no?<br>
I sensed something was wrong with the tower, so I came to investigate. Unfortunately, that's how I ended up here.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Bismarck Zwei：</span><br>
Good, we're on the same page then. How do you plan to get out?<br>
<span style="color:#a020f0;">Vestal META：</span><br>
......<br>
I don't have a plan, at the moment.<br>
I can't fix the distortion at the root of this Mirror Sea, much less break out on my own.<br>
My allies would surely know what to do, but on my own, I'm helpless.<br>
If I could just contact them, maybe they could come and rescue me.<br>
But for the time being, we're on our own.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Bismarck Zwei：</span><br>
What if I offered to help you?<br>
<span style="color:#a020f0;">Vestal META：</span><br>
I see no reason to refuse.<br>
But just so we're clear, I am not one of the Ashes. I overheard your conversation earlier, and apologize for the confusion.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Bismarck Zwei：</span><br>
Meaning, you're the unidentified META whose signal we picked up.<br>
<span style="color:#a020f0;">Vestal META：</span><br>
Indeed I am. I wish I could tell you where Friedrich is, but I do not know.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Bismarck Zwei：</span><br>
At least this saves us time in getting you up to speed. I'm guessing you know what's at the throat of the hourglass, too?<br>
<span style="color:#a020f0;">Vestal META：</span><br>
You mean the upside-down city? Did you see it as well?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Bismarck Zwei：</span><br>
In all its "glory." Do you what the tower in the middle of it is?<br>
<span style="color:#a020f0;">Vestal META：</span><br>
I suspect it's the Mirror Sea's control device.<br>
With all due respect, why didn't you investigate it when you had the chance?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Bismarck Zwei：</span><br>
*sigh*... We only just figured out this place is structured like an hourglass. Back then, we didn't know it was important.<br>
We were so focused on the Tower of Midgard, we assumed that was our key to getting out.<br>
But, the tower itself is part of the trap, and using it only causes us to sink deeper into it.<br>
<span style="color:#a020f0;">Vestal META：</span><br>
And so, you went diving into hallucinations, looking for answers. Just like me.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Bismarck Zwei：</span><br>
Actually, I already developed a theory before coming here.<br>
I could explain it, though the details might be lost on you if you're not up to date on the Sirens.<br>
<span style="color:#a020f0;">Vestal META：</span><br>
By all means, let's hear it.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Bismarck Zwei：</span><br>
Alright. To start with...<br>
<span style="color:#a020f0;">Vestal META：</span><br>
Using the power of concepts to move between dimensions, similar to the corruption...<br>
I thought only Helena could do something like that...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Bismarck Zwei：</span><br>
Helena?<br>
<span style="color:#a020f0;">Vestal META：</span><br>
Oh, just thinking out loud. Your theory seems fairly sound.<br>
If you can analyze the structure of an illusion, then the illusion itself can be considered a pathway of sorts.<br>
Given the proper methods, it is not only consciousness that can pass through, but perhaps even matter.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Bismarck Zwei：</span><br>
The very thing that keeps us trapped is also our key to escape.<br>
<span style="color:#a020f0;">Vestal META：</span><br>
Yes. Well put.<br>
You passed through two sets of visions on your way here, did you not?<br>
Following the trail of visions may actually lead us to the hourglass' throat.<br>
But first, would you please show me back to vision of your origin?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Bismarck Zwei：</span><br>
Of course. Geryon, send us back.<br>

<br>
After the blinding light faded, a new illusion appeared in front of Bismarck.<br>
This time, a group of shipgirls were breaching the enemy line to the peal of roaring cannons.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Seydlitz：</span><br>
I've lost contact with Thüringen's squadron, Lady Friedrich! Things are looking dire!<br>
We won't last much longer!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Friedrich der Große：</span><br>
The time isn't right. You must keep fighting.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Lützow：</span><br>
They're surrounding us!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Friedrich der Große：</span><br>
Intercept them.<br>
<span style="color:#ec5d53;">Arbiter: The Hermit IX：</span><br>
Here I thought you'd at least come prepared. What a joke.<br>
Disappear.<br>
<br>
One by one, the members of Friedrich's fleet were engulfed by continuous, overwhelming artillery fire.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Bismarck Zwei：</span><br>
......<br>
<span style="color:#a020f0;">Vestal META：</span><br>
Have you been shaken by this vision?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Bismarck Zwei：</span><br>
No, I'm thinking... About how all these visions seem to be connected.<br>
...Were these visions truly fabricated, or are they based on reality?<br>
<span style="color:#a020f0;">Vestal META：</span><br>
It's not impossible. Originally, these visions were just a way for Sirens to store information.<br>
Some of their contents are from simulations run by the mainframe, while others are records from actual events in the experimental field.<br>
Later on, the Sirens would go on to weaponize these visions just as they did with all technology at their disposal, much like the Mirror Seas.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Bismarck Zwei：</span><br>
Or... They could be things that happened in other branches.<br>
<span style="color:#a020f0;">Vestal META：</span><br>
A keen observation. I didn't expect you to ask me a question from this angle.<br>
What if I were to tell you, "yes"?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Bismarck Zwei：</span><br>
...All the more reason not to dwell on it.<br>
Getting back on topic... Assuming these visions are all connected through temporal continuity, I suspect that we're seeing them in the reverse order.<br>
So, if my theory about traveling through concepts is correct, following these visions should lead us to their source.<br>
<span style="color:#a020f0;">Vestal META：</span><br>
Indeed. We might already know the way to move backwards.<br>
You mentioned something earlier about a black aircraft beyond the mist, yes?<br>
I think I have an idea of where to find it.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Bismarck Zwei：</span><br>
If I remember right, it should be... this way. Let's go, Geryon.<br>
<br>
Bismarck engaged her engines and followed the vision's foggy boundary line.<br>
<span style="color:#ff9900;">Geryon：</span><br>
ROOOAAAR!<br>
<br>
Geryon flapped its wings to create another blast of wind, its movements seemingly smoother and more flexible than before.<br>
The obscuring veil parted to reveal multiple jet-black Siren aircraft. The instant they spotted Bismarck, they scattered and began to flee.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Bismarck Zwei：</span><br>
You're not getting away this time! Geryon!<br>
<span style="color:#a020f0;">Vestal META：</span><br>
...There's no need for that. I already know who those planes belong to.<br>
They belong to an Arbiter... Arbiter: The Devil XV.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Bismarck Zwei：</span><br>
The Devil? Not The Hermit?<br>
We're dealing with not one, but TWO Arbiters now?!<br>
<span style="color:#a020f0;">Vestal META：</span><br>
I'm afraid we'll need to gather more intel...<br>
First, though, the way out of the vision is open. Let's get out of here!<br>
<br>
After passing through the light again, Bismarck once again found herself in front of the Tower of Midgard and the inverted city in the sky.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Bismarck Zwei：</span><br>
...This isn't where we're supposed to be. I must've taken a wrong turn.<br>
Are we still dreaming? This doesn't feel real to me...<br>
<span style="color:#a020f0;">Vestal META：</span><br>
We're not. I can confidently say that this is reality.<br>
(But why did we end up here? Outside interference? Or is the corruption affecting Bismarck's hull?)<br>
Don't worry about your allies. We'll meet up with them soon.<br>
...There it is. This place is where The Hermit's mainframe is.<br>
There's no mistaking it. The Mirror Sea, the upside-down city, and that massive tower...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Bismarck Zwei：</span><br>
That's it... We must've been sent here by someone who wants the mainframe destroyed.<br>
<span style="color:#a020f0;">Vestal META：</span><br>
Perhaps so. One thing is for sure – your presence here has made attacking the mainframe much easier.<br>
...Oh! I've regained connection! I can talk with my allies again!<br>
That must mean The Tower XVI still hasn't gained full control of this place.<br>
<br>
After breathing a sigh of relief, Vestal punched a number and a code into her communicator.<br>
<span style="color:#a020f0;">Vestal META：</span><br>
Helena, can you hear me?<br>
<span style="color:#ff9900;">Helena META：</span><br>
Vestal! Thank goodness you're alive.<br>
Where are you right now? What's your status?<br>
<span style="color:#a020f0;">Vestal META：</span><br>
The good news is, I'm in the Mirror Sea that houses The Hermit's mainframe. As for the bad news... matters have gotten complicated.<br>
Bismarck is here, and we spotted aircraft belonging to The Devil.<br>
<span style="color:#ff9900;">Helena META：</span><br>
"The Devil" as in Arbiter XV, correct?<br>
<span style="color:#a020f0;">Vestal META：</span><br>
Yes. I don't know why she's here, but it's a very bad sign.<br>
I'll send you all the intel I've gathered now while I still can. There's no telling how long this connection will remain stable.<br>
<span style="color:#ff9900;">Helena META：</span><br>
Deep breaths, Vestal. Let me just... There, I got your intel.<br>
Hmm? Now, that's an interesting quandary.<br>
There's a whole Iron Blood fleet out there? How'd they get in?<br>
Hang on, I'll send you some data of my own. It'll help you out of the situation you're in.<br>
<span style="color:#a020f0;">Vestal META：</span><br>
*huff*... *puff*... Okay. I received your data.<br>
Wait, how is that possible? ...The Devil already has full knowledge of the Ashes' movements?!<br>
<span style="color:#ff9900;">Helena META：</span><br>
We don't know for sure, but we have to work under the assumption that she does.<br>
We've already sent a rescue team after you, but...<br>
I'm afraid the place you're stuck in is impossible to infiltrate from the outside.<br>
The only way I can help you is by hacking the Mirror Sea to your benefit.<br>
The Hermit has a vessel stationed near her mainframe. Find and destroy it as soon as you can.<br>
In the meantime, I'll do whatever I can.<br>
<span style="color:#a020f0;">Vestal META：</span><br>
...Okay. I'm on it.<br>
<span style="color:#ff9900;">Helena META：</span><br>
I'm sorry about all this. I shouldn't have sent you there.<br>
<span style="color:#a020f0;">Vestal META：</span><br>
Don't apologize. I'll be okay.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Bismarck Zwei：</span><br>
Who was that?<br>
<span style="color:#a020f0;">Vestal META：</span><br>
Helena, our "ol' reliable."<br>
I'm sure you have many questions, but let me cut to the chase.<br>
First and foremost, Friedrich is alive and well. She and the Ashes are currently engaging The Hermit.<br>
While she was away, another Arbiter, The Devil, infiltrated her mainframe.<br>
As for why she'd do that, I cannot say. All I know is, she's causing damage to The Hermit while the latter is pinned down by the Ashes.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Bismarck Zwei：</span><br>
Causing damage to her?<br>
Are you saying there's infighting between the Arbiters?<br>
<span style="color:#a020f0;">Vestal META：</span><br>
No, not infighting. All the Arbiters are Zero's subprograms. They would never turn on each other in the conventional sense.<br>
But that may change if there's a special experiment involved. In any case, this is the first time we've ever witnessed something resembling conflict between Arbiter programs.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Bismarck Zwei：</span><br>
Whatever her reason, it works in our favor. Won't we be rid of The Hermit for good if her mainframe is destroyed?<br>
<span style="color:#a020f0;">Vestal META：</span><br>
If only it were that simple. Should that be the case, the Arbiters would've been wiped out long ago.<br>
This is but one of many mainframes, and we have no way of knowing how many she has, or where they are hidden.<br>
However... If you're only interested in obtaining or tampering with certain pieces of information, invading the mainframe certainly is the most efficient method.<br>
At least, that's what Helena suspects.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Bismarck Zwei：</span><br>
Then, is The Devil behind all of this? The nightmares, the weaponization of hull corrosion, and the vision of Friedrich we saw just before?<br>
<span style="color:#a020f0;">Vestal META：</span><br>
Actually, some of those things are parts of The Hermit's arsenal, which may signify that The Devil has begun to gain control of the mainframe.<br>
As for the use of META corruption, this has only been observed in relation to The Devil.<br>
Maybe that has something to do with The Devil's current condition...<br>
But that's speculation, and even we can't say for sure one way or the other.<br>
Ultimately, her presence here isn't entirely beneficial to us. If we were to bump heads with her, we stand no chance of winning.<br>
Her vessels are a different story, though. We can defeat those if we work together.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Bismarck Zwei：</span><br>
That much I already know. We ran into one of The Hermit's vessels earlier and took care of it.<br>
But, since she only sent a vessel, she mustn't be too alarmed by us being here.<br>
<span style="color:#a020f0;">Vestal META：</span><br>
Pardon? You fought one of The Hermit's vessels?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Bismarck Zwei：</span><br>
Yeah. Is that a problem?<br>
<span style="color:#a020f0;">Vestal META：</span><br>
Well, no... Like you said, it just means she doesn't consider you a serious threat.<br>
At any rate, it's time we reunited with your allies. Let's get moving.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Bismarck Zwei：</span><br>
Alright. By the way, what you said about my rigging earlier...<br>
<span style="color:#a020f0;">Vestal META：</span><br>
I know. I won't tell them about it.<br>

<br>
Some time later, in the Tower of Midgard's control center...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ulrich von Hutten：</span><br>
...The hell?! Who are you?!<br>
<span style="color:#a020f0;">Vestal META：</span><br>
Forgive me, you couldn't have anticipated my arrival.<br>
I am Vestal – though not the Vestal you know. Well met, Ulrich von Hutten.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Bismarck Zwei：</span><br>
She's the unknown META we were searching for before.<br>
Ulrich, gather everyone. I'll explain what we're going to do next.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Regensburg：</span><br>
The Devil wants The Hermit's power, so she called us here and crippled the mainframe using her corruption...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Otto von Alvensleben：</span><br>
And to get out of here, we'll need Helena META to hack the mainframe for a while?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Jade：</span><br>
Seems the Arbiters are so despicable they've started fighting each other.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Otto von Alvensleben：</span><br>
Hey, just be happy we didn't have to duke it out with one of the kingpins.<br>
In fact, it doesn't seem like either of the two have plans on annihilating us.<br>
As much as I don't like the idea of running with our tails between our legs, I'll do anything to get out of this place.<br>
<span style="color:#a020f0;">Vestal META：</span><br>
Yes, and since The Devil's attention is on seizing control of the Mirror Sea, she should leave us alone for the most part.<br>
That said, I don't think we can just walk out. Her aircraft will still pose a threat to us.<br>
Especially so, considering her arsenal of support aircraft is the most advanced out of any Arbiter – or Siren, period.<br>
The Commander must have warned you about their capabilities.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Bismarck Zwei：</span><br>
Yeah. The information you provided will be useful, too.<br>
The Devil must know we're here, seeing how far the red sea has expanded...<br>
Our window of time to get out of here shrinks with every passing minute.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Regensburg：</span><br>
Speaking of which, Bismarck, the sea didn't expand while you were gone.<br>
The gate didn't activate a single time. It was only just before you got back that the red sea grew.<br>
<span style="color:#a020f0;">Vestal META：</span><br>
Either The Devil is trying to put pressure on us, or the corruption has reached critical mass.<br>
Which means our time is running out. We need to get moving immediately.<br>
We must defeat The Hermit's vessel before The Devil gains full control over the mainframe.<br>
If we take too long... we will be trapped in here forever.<br>
Now, let's access the database in the control center. It should take us to the hourglass' throat.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Bismarck Zwei：</span><br>
One quick thing before we do that. Could you examine this one?<br>
<br>
Bismarck held U-556's hand and led her to Vestal.<br>
<span style="color:#a020f0;">Vestal META：</span><br>
Ah. U-556, yes? You told me about her.<br>
(I sense the corrosion eating away her hull... But wait, it's not past the point of no return...)<br>
<br>
Vestal felt a little confused seeing such a bright smile on a body so clearly tarnished by the corruption.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Bismarck Zwei：</span><br>
She suffered damage to her hull long ago, and the red sea's corrosion suddenly reopened and aggravated her old wounds.<br>
I entered her vision and managed to cleanse the external corruption, but she's still in this form...<br>
<span style="color:#a020f0;">Vestal META：</span><br>
I see...<br>
Luckily, her condition is still reversible. I should be able to cleanse the internal corruption as well.<br>
Just give me a minute, please.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Bismarck Zwei：</span><br>
...Thank you so much.<br>
<span style="color:#a020f0;">Vestal META：</span><br>
Please, it's nothing. One important thing, though – she still needs to abstain from fighting for a while after I've treated her.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Bismarck Zwei：</span><br>
Alright.<br>
<span style="color:#ff9900;">U-556 META?：</span><br>
Hey, hold on a sec!<br>
Vestal, you know more than anyone else here about METAmorphosis, right?<br>
<span style="color:#a020f0;">Vestal META：</span><br>
I... suppose so.<br>
<span style="color:#ff9900;">U-556 META?：</span><br>
Okay, then listen. We're still in danger and need as many of us fighting as possible.<br>
I'm the Parzival of the Seas, and I'm duty-bound to protect Lord Bismarck as well as all my other friends!<br>
If you cure me now and I'm forbidden from fighting, I'll only be dead weight!<br>
So, could you just... put a bandaid on, but let me stay like this for a while longer?<br>
You can fully cure me after this is all over!<br>
<span style="color:#a020f0;">Vestal META：</span><br>
Are you sure you want to do that?<br>
(Even if she's willing to take a risk, there's a lot at stake here...)<br>
(Worse comes to worst, she might lose herself again...)<br>
Okay. I'll do what I can, but if you push yourself too far, there's no going back.<br>
You need to promise that if Bismarck or I order you to stop fighting, you will do so at once. Is that clear?<br>
<span style="color:#ff9900;">U-556 META?：</span><br>
Yeah! Promise!<br>

<br>
Following Bismarck's guidance, the girls all touched the control center's dome and were transported through the datastream.<br>
They carefully traversed it to its terminus and arrived beneath the inverted city, only to discover that it looked nothing like it did before.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Jade：</span><br>
Oh no! What's wrong with this place? It looks totally corrupted!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Otto von Alvensleben：</span><br>
Yeah, what's going on? Everything here is dyed red!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Regensburg：</span><br>
Are we too late after all?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ulrich von Hutten：</span><br>
If The Devil has seized full control, there's no point in going after The Hermit's vessel.<br>
In that case, our only hope of ever escaping is to take on The Devil herself...<br>
<span style="color:#a020f0;">Vestal META：</span><br>
I fear that may be the case.<br>
If only I could reach Helena and ask for help...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Zuikaku：</span><br>
There's no going back to the control center now. It's do or die!<br>
My planes have spotted The Hermit's vessel! She's not far from here!<br>
Although... is it just me, or does she not look right?<br>
<br>
Zuikaku put on display the picture her aircraft took.<br>
The Arbiter vessel was glowing red and standing idly in the sea as though it was waiting on somebody.<br>
<span style="color:#ec5d53;">Arbiter: The Hermit IX?：</span><br>
......<br>
<br>
The robotic yet intense drive its kin displayed the last time they fought one was completely gone.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Bismarck Zwei：</span><br>
Just to confirm, Sirens do not have Wisdom Cube-powered hulls, and thus cannot be affected by METAmorphosis. Is that correct?<br>
<span style="color:#a020f0;">Vestal META：</span><br>
Yes. In theory, Sirens should immune to the effects of corrosion.<br>
While they do utilize Cube technology, they only use it as a power source. It's not integral to their design.<br>
It may be possible to damage this power source, but that would have no bearing on the Siren's properties, let alone cause METAmorphosis.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Bismarck Zwei：</span><br>
Both you and the Commander said that The Devil isn't like other Arbiters.<br>
So if this isn't the effects of corruption, what is it then?<br>
<span style="color:#a020f0;">Vestal META：</span><br>
Well, there's another theory about that... It basically holds that The Devil's erratic qualities are perfectly normal.<br>
Just as their naming pattern implies, the Arbiters may have both upright and reversed forms.<br>
Under this theory, she is simply exhibiting the reversed characteristics of her Major Arcana.<br>
Of course, there's no proof one way or the other, and the theory has holes.<br>
(She's caught between the ideas of being a person and being a weapon, much like us.)<br>
In any case, this vessel is a wholly different beast to the last one you fought.<br>
The Devil's support makes it many, many times more powerful than before.<br>
The difference is so drastic, fighting this vessel would be like taking on two Arbiters at once.<br>
(Worse yet, none of us here have fought a juiced-up Arbiter before...)<br>
(If only I could reach Helena, or if Arizona was here with us...)<br>
(Or better yet, if I was only a more capable fighter...)<br>
(Enty... Give me courage...)<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Zuikaku：</span><br>
(Vestal looks like she's about to break down...) It's alright, Vestal! Let's think this through first!<br>
What if The Devil hasn't actually seized full control over this place yet, and is actually bluffing?<br>
If she's already seized full control, she wouldn't have any reason to care about us!<br>
She's just trying to stall for time! We can win if we take her on here and now!<br>
<span style="color:#a020f0;">Vestal META：</span><br>
(Zuikaku...)<br>
I... I think you're right.<br>
The Devil is an incredibly cunning Arbiter. I certainly wouldn't put it past her to resort to deception...<br>
I believe we can win. Let's take on this vessel!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Bismarck Zwei：</span><br>
That's what I like to hear.<br>
<span style="color:#ff9900;">U-556 META?：</span><br>
Now it's our turn to go on the offensive!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Bismarck Zwei：</span><br>
Yes. I've had enough of dancing in the Sirens' palms.<br>
Everyone! Commence the attack!<br>
{{折叠面板|内容结束}}

{{折叠面板|标题=Corrupted Hermit|选项=31|主框=1|样式=primary|展开=是}}
<br>
Geryon roared as Bismarck led the ships into battle, launching a fierce attack on the Arbiter vessel.<br>
However, the vessel and its Enforcers did not descend into chaos, instead exhibiting greater synergy as they intensified their defensive fire.<br>
<span style="color:#ff9900;">Gneisenau META：</span><br>
It's not just the vessel that's stronger! The Enforcers are on a whole other level, too!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Bismarck Zwei：</span><br>
Nobody overextend! Advance slowly and steadily!<br>
<span style="color:#ff9900;">Gneisenau META：</span><br>
I'll provide covering fire!<br>
<span style="color:#ff9900;">Geryon：</span><br>
ROOOAAAR!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Regensburg：</span><br>
Regina, back off! Bah... These Sirens are even nastier than normal.<br>
<span style="color:#a020f0;">Vestal META：</span><br>
The Devil has supercharged not only The Hermit's vessel, but these Enforcers as well...<br>
I fear there's no hope for us anymore...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Jade：</span><br>
I've lost quite a few aircraft, but you don't see me throwing in the towel already.<br>
Good girls fight the good fight, no matter the odds.<br>
I know it's tempting to give up, but if there's even a sliver of a chance we can make it out of here alive, I'll pursue it.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Zuikaku：</span><br>
You heard her, Vestal! We're all in this together!<br>
<span style="color:#a020f0;">Vestal META：</span><br>
You're... No, you're right. We still have a shot at victory, risky as it may be.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Zuikaku：</span><br>
Risky? What do you mean?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Bismarck Zwei：</span><br>
I think I know. It requires someone skilled in electronic warfare, and someone who can bust that vessel open.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Zuikaku：</span><br>
Sure, but we have to get through the Enforcers first!<br>
Even if they were standing still, we've still got to dodge their attacks! We can barely land a hit on them!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Bismarck Zwei：</span><br>
Remember how we fought the last vessel and just repeat what you did.<br>
Ulrich, you're in charge. Keep the Enforcers occupied and buy me some time.<br>
While they're distracted, I'll get in close.<br>
<span style="color:#a020f0;">Vestal META：</span><br>
Are you sure we should do this, Bismarck?<br>
We can pull it off if we coordinate well enough...<br>
But what if this is exactly what the Sirens want us to do?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Bismarck Zwei：</span><br>
You can't think like that, Vestal.<br>
Before you can make a decision, you need to overcome your fears and doubts.<br>
The old me would try to carry the weight of the world, unwaveringly following the path she believed in, even if she had to do it alone.<br>
Not anymore. I trust my comrades with my life. With them by my side, I am stronger than ever.<br>
It's not great leaders that forge the future, but rather those who believe in them.<br>
<span style="color:#a020f0;">Vestal META：</span><br>
I... Okay. I trust you, Bismarck. We stand behind you.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Bismarck Zwei：</span><br>
Thank you. I'm counting on you.<br>
<span style="color:#ff9900;">U-556 META?：</span><br>
Let me come with you, Lord Bismarck!<br>
I won't let anything get between us again!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Bismarck Zwei：</span><br>
...Okay. Let's go!<br>
<br>
<br>
Under Ulrich's command, the girls fought hard and managed to lure the Enforcers away.<br>
Meanwhile, Bismarck – and U-556, sat on top of Geryon – charged straight towards the Arbiter vessel.<br>
<span style="color:#ec5d53;">Arbiter: The Hermit IX?：</span><br>
<br>
<span style="color:#ff9900;">U-556 META?：</span><br>
Look out! It's going to attack us!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Bismarck Zwei：</span><br>
Geryon, block it!<br>
<br>
Her giant rigging swerved to the side and absorbed the incoming shells with its armor.<br>
<span style="color:#ff9900;">U-556 META?：</span><br>
Whoooa! That was amazing!<br>
<span style="color:#ec5d53;">Arbiter: The Hermit IX?：</span><br>
<br>
<br>
<span style="color:#ff9900;">Geryon：</span><br>
ROOOAAAR!<br>
<br>
Without even flinching at the next incoming volley, Bismarck engaged her engines and kicked up massive waves as she pursued the vessel.<br>
<span style="color:#ec5d53;">Arbiter: The Hermit IX?：</span><br>
<br>
<br>
<span style="color:#ff9900;">U-556 META?：</span><br>
Lord Bismarck! Please let me fight, too!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Bismarck Zwei：</span><br>
Damn, she's deployed mini-subs!<br>
U-556, listen! Go underwater and don't resurface until I tell you to!<br>
Got it? Then go, my Parzival of the Seas!<br>
<span style="color:#ff9900;">U-556 META?：</span><br>
Understood! Submerging now!<br>
Be careful, now!<br>
<br>
After confirming U-556 was safely under the surface, Bismarck charged ahead at unbelievable speed.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Bismarck Zwei：</span><br>
Modulating Cube output, shifting power into rigging framework–<br>
Disable safety limiter number one! Remove inhibitor from the Cube energizer!<br>
<br>
Geryon began firing main cannon shells at the Arbiter vessel from point-blank range.<br>
It dodged the first shell with a backstep, and the second hit the water behind it...<br>
But the third, accompanied by a concentrated beam of energy, landed a direct hit.<br>
Piercing an Arbiter's armor with one hit from a conventional shipgirl weaponry is exceedingly improbable.<br>
But multiple hits? A lot more likely. Bismarck's plan was to pound the vessel with shell after shell, and scorch it with lasers, even if it damages her own rigging.<br>
The sky turned red from the fire of her cannons, and the sea steamed from the immense heat.<br>
And yet, despite all that, her cannon fire could not penetrate the vessel's strengthened core.<br>
<span style="color:#ec5d53;">Arbiter: The Hermit IX?：</span><br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Bismarck Zwei：</span><br>
(Friedrich... The High Seas Fleet... I consider this second life a gift from you.)<br>
I'm done playing games with you.<br>
Disable safety limiters number 2, 3, and 7! Engage tri-layered hull superimposition!<br>
<span style="color:#ff9900;">Geryon：</span><br>
ROOOOOOAAAAAARRRR!!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Bismarck Zwei：</span><br>
You will taste Iron Blood's fury!<br>
<br>
<br>
With Bismarck and U-556 riding atop it, Geryon flew up towards the upside-down city.<br>
The tremendous momentum behind its ascent kicked up a scarlet spindrift big enough to blot out the sky.<br>
<span style="color:#ff9900;">U-556 META?：</span><br>
We're flyiiiiing!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Bismarck Zwei：</span><br>
Don't lose sight of that Arbiter, Geryon!<br>
<span style="color:#ff9900;">Geryon：</span><br>
ROOOAAAR!<br>
<span style="color:#ec5d53;">Arbiter: The Hermit IX?：</span><br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<span style="color:#ff9900;">U-556 META?：</span><br>
Lord Bismarck! We have incoming Sirens!<br>
They look like The Devil's Enforcers!<br>
There's so many of them... Don't tell me they were waiting for us this whole time!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Bismarck Zwei：</span><br>
(Exactly what we were both aiming for.)<br>
(Now that she's gained control of the mainframe, destroying The Hermit's vessel won't help us. She can isolate and take us out one at a time to gain control over the Mirror Sea.)<br>
(But, to do that, she has to split up computing resources among not just her own Enforcers, but The Hermit's as well.)<br>
(So until they get everything under control, her anti-hacking defenses are at their weakest.)<br>
Don't be afraid, U-556. This will all be over once we defeat that Arbiter vessel.<br>
<span style="color:#ff9900;">U-556 META?：</span><br>
Okay! I believe in you!<br>
<br>
Hovering in the air, The Hermit's body gave off an ill-boding light<br>
<span style="color:#ec5d53;">Arbiter: The Hermit IX?：</span><br>
<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Bismarck Zwei：</span><br>
Disable safety limiter number 4, 6, 8, and 9!<br>
<span style="color:#ff9900;">Geryon：</span><br>
ROOOOOOAAAAAARRRR!!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Bismarck Zwei：</span><br>
Unleash everything you have with this one attack, Geryon!<br>
<br>
Heeding her order, the dragon roared with all three of its mouths.<br>
Streaks of light then appeared all across its steel body.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Bismarck Zwei：</span><br>
(Thank you, my Parzival. You are my pride and joy.)<br>
Listen, fiends! I am Bismarck! I reject the past and the future you've forced upon me!<br>
 This body, this power, and this burning resolve will not be martyred to your darkness!<br>
Truth can only be found within my range!<br>
<br>
Everything came down to these final, ultimate attacks.<br>
A blinding beam of energy shot forth, their intensity bringing the sea to a boil.<br>
It struck the Arbiter directly, cutting through its armor like a hot knife through butter.<br>
Even with The Devil's entire arsenal of support enhancing the vessel, it could not block this attack.<br>
The battle was over.<br>

<br>
The Mirror Sea began to change immediately following the destruction of The Hermit's vessel.<br>
Massive metallic rings suddenly emerged from the red sea, surrounding the Tower of Midgard from all sides.<br>
Meanwhile, in the sky, Bismarck began descending back down and saw the ring fuse itself to the big cubes floating above the surface.<br>
In only a matter of moments, the ring and the cubes had merged into one single structure.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Bismarck Zwei：</span><br>
I assume this is the work of that friend Vestal spoke about.<br>
She wields powers far beyond what I imagined...<br>
<br>
Immediately upon landing, Bismarck was hit with an overpowering sense of dizziness that brought her to her knees.<br>
<span style="color:#ff9900;">U-556 META：</span><br>
Lord Bismarck! Are you okay?!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Bismarck Zwei：</span><br>
Stay back!<br>
<span style="color:#ff9900;">U-556 META：</span><br>
But... Lord Bismarck... Look at me.<br>
<br>
U-556 came closer, despite Bismarck's clear order. Black mist was coiling around the little girl.<br>
<span style="color:#ff9900;">U-556 META：</span><br>
Umm... Looks like I got a bit too excited...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Bismarck Zwei：</span><br>
There are still Enforcers around... can you fight?<br>
<span style="color:#ff9900;">U-556 META：</span><br>
Sure!<br>
<span style="color:#a020f0;">Arizona META：</span><br>
...No. This isn't the time for that.<br>
I am battleship Arizona. One of Vestal's friends.<br>
Allow me to handle this.<br>
<span style="color:#a020f0;">544845544F574552：</span><br>
45 78 65 63 75 74 65 63 6F 6E 74 72 6F 6C 70 72 6F 74 6F 63 6F 6C 2E<br>
49 6E 69 74 69 61 6C 69 7A 65 70 75 72 69 66 69 63 61 74 69 6F 6E 70 72 6F 67 72 61 6D 2E<br>
<br>
The giant ring encasing the Tower of Midgard began glowing, rapidly increasing in intensity until everything was dyed a blinding white.<br>
Little by little, the light dimmed until it was possible to see again.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Regensburg：</span><br>
What was that?! The red sea is completely gone!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Jade：</span><br>
The Sirens all went up in smoke too...<br>
And that's not all...!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Otto von Alvensleben：</span><br>
Bismarck! U-556! Are you alright?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Bismarck Zwei：</span><br>
Where... am I...?<br>
<br>
Indeed, the red sea had disappeared entirely, as though by magic.<br>
As was the noxious air signifying the presence of corruption.<br>
U-556 and Bismarck regained their footing and listened to the META girls' conversation.<br>
<span style="color:#a020f0;">Vestal META：</span><br>
Arizona... You...<br>
You used the tower? Why?<br>
<span style="color:#a020f0;">Arizona META：</span><br>
It was the only way to resolve the situation.<br>
<span style="color:#a020f0;">Vestal META：</span><br>
And Helena? Where is she?<br>
<span style="color:#a020f0;">Arizona META：</span><br>
She... has her hands full right now.<br>
Never mind her. Shouldn't you tend to those two?<br>
<span style="color:#a020f0;">Vestal META：</span><br>
Tend to– Oh my god...<br>
<br>
Vestal regained her bearings and turned her attention to Bismarck and U-556.<br>
The black mist had all but completely enveloped them.<br>
<span style="color:#a020f0;">Vestal META：</span><br>
You've been exposed to extreme amounts of corrosion!<br>
What happened?! What did you do?!<br>
...You disabled your limiters, didn't you?!<br>
Why would you do that?! You nearly got yourself killed!<br>
<br>
Visibly shocked by the state they were in, Vestal rushed to their side.<br>
<span style="color:#a020f0;">Vestal META：</span><br>
You have to stay awake! Can you talk?!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Bismarck Zwei：</span><br>
Don't worry about me...<br>
I took measures against the corrosion... It'll be fine...<br>
My rigging will absorb it...<br>
Focus on U-556... She's the one who needs help...<br>
<span style="color:#a020f0;">Vestal META：</span><br>
...If you say so. I'll take care of her.<br>
U-556? Can you hear me?<br>
<span style="color:#ff9900;">U-556 META：</span><br>
It's so dark... Lord Bismarck... where are you...?<br>
<span style="color:#a020f0;">Vestal META：</span><br>
......<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Bismarck Zwei：</span><br>
Is it... too late... for her...?<br>
<span style="color:#a020f0;">Vestal META：</span><br>
...No, it is not.<br>
She can still be saved.<br>
<br>
Vestal kneeled by U-556's side and opened her hand, manifesting a cube which glowed with a soft blue light.<br>
Dozens more appeared shortly after, forming a loose circle that slowly swirled around her and U-556.<br>
Little by little, the cubes absorbed the black mist enveloping U-556.<br>
After being treated for a while, the pained look on her face eased while the black deposits gradually discolored the cubes.<br>
CRACK...<br>
The cube in Vestal's hand first turned a red color, then crumbled to pieces.<br>
Her facial muscles contorted with pain.<br>
<span style="color:#a020f0;">Vestal：</span><br>
*cough, cough*! Urgh...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Zuikaku：</span><br>
Vestal! Are you alright?!<br>
<span style="color:#a020f0;">Vestal：</span><br>
I'll be fine... I just need to rest for a while...<br>
(Now we're square, and can part ways without debts to settle...)<br>
<br>
Zuikaku offered Vestal a hand, but she politely shook her head and stood up on her own.<br>
The next time eyes turned on U-556 again, she had reverted to her regular appearance. All external signs of the corrosion were gone.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">U-556：</span><br>
Nngh...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Jade：</span><br>
She's finally back to normal!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Otto von Alvensleben：</span><br>
U-556!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">U-556：</span><br>
Whoa, hey! I'm soaking wet right now! Hugging me just feels icky!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Regensburg：</span><br>
Give her some space. She needs to recover.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Otto von Alvensleben：</span><br>
Right. My bad...<br>
You had me worried sick, you know... I thought you'd never be the same again.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">U-556：</span><br>
Well, now I am, so it's all good!<br>
<span style="color:#a020f0;">Arizona META：</span><br>
Seems everything turned out fine in the end.<br>
I sent you the data. I trust you to take care of the aftermath.<br>
<span style="color:#a020f0;">Vestal META：</span><br>
Yes... It's all here. I'll take care of it.<br>
<span style="color:#a020f0;">Arizona META：</span><br>
Then this is farewell. Until next time...<br>
<span style="color:#a020f0;">Vestal META：</span><br>
......<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Bismarck：</span><br>
So, this is it? It's over?<br>
<span style="color:#a020f0;">Vestal META：</span><br>
Yes. I got what I was looking for.<br>
All you need to do now is activate the Tower of Midgard's gate one last time, and you should be sent back home.<br>
...I still cannot believe the corrosion can be purged.<br>
Although, I suppose doing so requires a sacrifice. It still has to go somewhere.<br>
While your hull remains intact, the same cannot be said for those merged with it... Geryon will be out of commission for quite some time.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Bismarck：</span><br>
I suppose so. What do you plan to do next?<br>
I'm guessing you're not thinking about coming with us.<br>
<span style="color:#a020f0;">Vestal META：</span><br>
Unfortunately, no. I have other things I must do.<br>
Truth be told, I must ask you for a favor. Once you're back home, please see to it the Tower of Midgard in your world is destroyed.<br>
It was the reason why this whole near-disaster happened in the first place.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Bismarck：</span><br>
Destroy it? Are you serious?<br>
Do you know the ungodly amount of resources we poured into it?<br>
<span style="color:#a020f0;">Vestal META：</span><br>
Yes, I do.<br>
I also know this is an extremely hard decision to make, but it must be done.<br>
The Tower of Midgard's exact location is already out there now. Simply closing the gate won't prevent future incidents.<br>
Leave it intact, and one day, the corrosion will come flooding through the gate and spread through your whole world.<br>
If you don't want that to happen, you must destroy it.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Bismarck：</span><br>
...Very well. I swear the Tower of Midgard will be destroyed as soon as possible.<br>
<span style="color:#a020f0;">Vestal META：</span><br>
Good. You should get moving now, while the Arbiters have their eyes on me.<br>
<br>
At the Mirror Sea's heart, the open gate shone with a bright blue light.<br>
The massive machine rumbled and roared, presenting the girls with a way home.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">U-556：</span><br>
Vestal, thank you for everythiiing!<br>
<br>
With a final goodbye from U-556, the Iron Blood girls' long excursion was finally over.<br>
<span style="color:#a020f0;">Vestal META：</span><br>
I'm sure our paths will cross again.<br>
<br>
A while after Vestal watched the group disappear in the light, the communicator in her hand started beeping.<br>
<span style="color:#a020f0;">Vestal META：</span><br>
...I wondered when you were going to call me.<br>
...So, tell me, The Tower XVI...<br>
What will you do now?<br>
{{折叠面板|内容结束}}

{{折叠面板|标题=An Ending, and a...|选项=33|主框=1|样式=primary|展开=是}}
<br>
Floating Fortress - Area A1<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Bismarck：</span><br>
Whew... It's good to be home again.<br>
I wonder if Queen Elizabeth solved her Singularity issue.<br>
Might as well call her and ask.<br>
<br>
Bismarck opened up a communication channel.<br>
She called up the queen, but the only thing on the other end was white noise.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Bismarck：</span><br>
Huh? That's strange...<br>
<br>
Confused, she then attempted to get in touch with her comrades on the Iron Blood mainland, as well as those attending the World Expo.<br>
But, again, the only thing she heard was white noise.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Bismarck：</span><br>
Is the Mirror Sea's jamming field still active? That's really odd...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Regensburg：</span><br>
Bismarck, I've finished my inspection.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Bismarck：</span><br>
How are the others holding up?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Regensburg：</span><br>
Just fine. They're all still sleeping like babies.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Bismarck：</span><br>
...Anything else that's wrong with them?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Regensburg：</span><br>
There's nothing wrong with them, medically speaking.<br>
They're just sleeping. That's all.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Bismarck：</span><br>
Very well. Continue monitoring them.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Regensburg：</span><br>
As you say.<br>
<br>
Bismarck gazed through the window in her office. The Tower of Midgard's light was fading.<br>
They had promptly shut off the gate and deactivated the facility as soon as they got back.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Bismarck：</span><br>
It's supposed to be over. Everything should be back to normal, and yet...<br>
Destroying the Tower of Midgard really is the only way, it seems.<br>
<br>
She observed the silent tower whilst weighing its pros and cons in her head.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Bismarck：</span><br>
......<br>
Ulrich, do you hear me?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ulrich von Hutten：</span><br>
Loud and clear. What's up?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Bismarck：</span><br>
Are you done inspecting the tower?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ulrich von Hutten：</span><br>
Still working on it. It's gonna take a lot of time if you want me to be thorough.<br>
But, from what I can tell so far, it's back to working as normal.<br>
......<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">{namecode:464}&{namecode:435}：</span><br>
– Bismarck... – Ulrich...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Bismarck：</span><br>
Ahah. We both had the same thought, huh?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ulrich von Hutten：</span><br>
...Are we really going to destroy it?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Bismarck：</span><br>
...Yes.<br>
It has served its purpose. If Friedrich were here, she would agree that destroying it is the correct move.<br>
But before we do so, download the logs saved on it.<br>
Make backups of all the project files on it as well. Once that's done, demolish it.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ulrich von Hutten：</span><br>
Got it. I'm on it.<br>
{{折叠面板|内容结束}}

<br>
Somewhere, in an unknown location...<br>
A sea dyed deep red. This battlefield had become a grave shipyard – the final resting place for dozens of smoking wreckages.<br>
Friedrich lay on her back in the water, gazing silently into the distance.<br>
Although her rigging had suffered terrible damage, the light of determination still glimmered in her eyes.<br>
KABOOOM!<br>
The Hermit fell to her knees, Enterprise META having dealt the final blow.<br>
<span style="color:#ff9900;">Enterprise META：</span><br>
...You did good, keeping her busy.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Friedrich der Große：</span><br>
No need to thank me.<br>
<span style="color:#ff9900;">Enterprise META：</span><br>
We're done on our end. All of you, give me a status report.<br>
<span style="color:#ff9900;">Fusou META：</span><br>
This space has been successfully sealed. The Hermit cannot get help from other Arbiters.<br>
<span style="color:#ff9900;">Scharnhorst META：</span><br>
Not only that, she's completely isolated from her mainframe.<br>
<span style="color:#ff9900;">Hiyou META：</span><br>
As for Temperance, she's started evacuating.<br>
<span style="color:#ff9900;">Junyou META：</span><br>
As has Strength. They must be pretty freaked out over The Hermit's disappearance.<br>
<span style="color:#ff9900;">Takao META：</span><br>
This was an insanely risky gamble. I can't believe this fool's errand worked.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Friedrich der Große：</span><br>
(This was no small feat, but we had all the tools to pull it off. The Ashes' strength, the High Seas Fleet's acting, Bismarck's quick thinking...)<br>
(And the ever-important outlier... my child.)<br>
<span style="color:#ff9900;">Enterprise META：</span><br>
Time to check on our prey.<br>
We meet again.<br>
<span style="color:#ec5d53;">Arbiter: The Hermit IX：</span><br>
...What are you going to do?<br>
<span style="color:#ff9900;">Enterprise META：</span><br>
Nothing much. I just want to see what happens if I activate one of your backup vessels.<br>
<span style="color:#ec5d53;">Arbiter: The Hermit IX：</span><br>
That's it? That's your plan?<br>
Should've figured. You Ashes have absolutely no idea what you're doing.<br>
Do yourselves a favor and give up already.<br>
<span style="color:#ff9900;">Enterprise META：</span><br>
We have you by the neck, yet you still act like you have the upper hand.<br>
"You can't do anything without Zero's express permission." That's what you're thinking.<br>
What if I told you I have an emergency identification code from the Creator?<br>
<span style="color:#ec5d53;">Arbiter: The Hermit IX：</span><br>
What?! No, you're lying! No such thing exists!<br>
<span style="color:#ff9900;">Enterprise META：</span><br>
Oh, but Anzeel showed it to me once.<br>
It so happens I remember it.<br>
<span style="color:#ec5d53;">Arbiter: The Hermit IX：</span><br>
......<br>
You can't threaten me, Code G. Zero will know the instant you use that.<br>
Besides, what good is an Arbiter vessel to you?<br>
It'll connect to the network and automatically synchronize its data.<br>
All you'll do is create one more thing that wants you dead.<br>
<span style="color:#ff9900;">Enterprise META：</span><br>
We'll see if that's true, once we've made a few changes to your mainframe.<br>
<span style="color:#ec5d53;">Arbiter: The Hermit IX：</span><br>
What?! What are you going to do to it?!<br>
<span style="color:#ff9900;">Enterprise META：</span><br>
Stop it with your fake human reactions. You calculated that this would happen long ago.<br>
Thinking about blowing yourself up? Not gonna work.<br>
This space was made specifically to contain you.<br>
You know you've lost connection to your mainframe. Don't kid yourself.<br>
<span style="color:#ec5d53;">Arbiter: The Hermit IX：</span><br>
Where... Where did you get the technology to sever me from it?<br>
<span style="color:#ff9900;">Enterprise META：</span><br>
In a distant place long ago, Antiochus.<br>
When Anzeel requested help with testing your kind.<br>
<span style="color:#ec5d53;">Arbiter: The Hermit IX：</span><br>
You've sat on this trump card for ages, yet never used it before? You're bluffing.<br>
<span style="color:#ff9900;">Enterprise META：</span><br>
I never cared about your equipment.<br>
But, that was then. I've changed my mind.<br>
<span style="color:#ec5d53;">Arbiter: The Hermit IX：</span><br>
......<br>
<span style="color:#ff9900;">Enterprise META：</span><br>
It's sinking in now, isn't it? You've lost.<br>
Once I find where your mainframe is, you're going to–<br>
<br>
The very atmosphere seemed to vibrate violently–<br>
<span style="color:#ff9900;">Enterprise META：</span><br>
...What was that?<br>
<span style="color:#ff9900;">Hiryuu META：</span><br>
Enterprise! There's some huge thing coming right towards us!<br>
<span style="color:#ff9900;">Enterprise META：</span><br>
What?!<br>

<br>
Somewhere, in an unknown location...<br>
A young girl dressed in black stood in front of a control device, making changes of some sort.<br>
Then, she heard footsteps from behind her. Someone entered the room.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Arbiter: The Tower XVI：</span><br>
Devil, got a moment?<br>
Didn't catch you at a bad time, did I?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Arbiter: The Devil XV：</span><br>
Oh, it's you. Surprised to see you here.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Arbiter: The Tower XVI：</span><br>
I'M the one who's surprised.<br>
Where have you been? I couldn't trace you.<br>
What are you doing inside Hermit?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Arbiter: The Devil XV：</span><br>
Ugh, give me a break...<br>
Look, we have a lot in common, don't we?<br>
So tell you what. I'll give up peacefully. Happy?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Arbiter: The Tower XVI：</span><br>
I'll let you off the hook this time, but you still have to repay me for breaking my lens.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Arbiter: The Devil XV：</span><br>
Oh, for... That's your fault for letting rats inside.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Arbiter: The Tower XVI：</span><br>
They're chinchillas.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Arbiter: The Devil XV：</span><br>
Same difference.<br>
I've got important stuff to do, so let's just pretend we didn't see each other. Deal?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Arbiter: The Tower XVI：</span><br>
That depends on your answer to this next question.<br>
Who's that behind you?<br>

<br>
Somewhere in the ocean...<br>
The moonlight splashed across the ocean, only blemished by a solitary figure crossing beneath it.<br>
But suddenly, she slows her steps.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">???：</span><br>
You've entered the Vichya Dominion's territorial waters. State your name, affiliation, and purpose.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">La Galissonnière：</span><br>
Come on out already, Algérie~<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Algérie：</span><br>
You noticed?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">La Galissonnière：</span><br>
You've gone soft, my dear~♪<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Algérie：</span><br>
Want to test me? ...Hmm?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">La Galissonnière：</span><br>
Nah, I'll pass for today. I don't mind taking an L here or there.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Algérie：</span><br>
...Wait, you're wounded.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">La Galissonnière：</span><br>
It's just a scratch. Once I head home and sleep it off, I'll be fine in no time.<br>
How's everything going at the Tribunal?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Algérie：</span><br>
Not sure what to say... It feels like everyone's sneaking off doing their own things.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">La Galissonnière：</span><br>
So, it's not too late for me to come back?<br>
Oh, and hear anything from Clemenceau?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Algérie：</span><br>
Yes, but I'll only tell you after you come back to base.<br>
You'd best take care of those wounds, after all.<br>

A woman's voice echoed across the chamber of a cathedral.<br>
<span style="color:#ffd000;">Marco Polo：</span><br>
"Listen! Everyone has gathered at the same place."<br>
"There are those from Sardegna, who would pick up stone and mortar, some who would become lost."<br>
"There are those from the Royal Navy, who would erect a white castle; and those from the Iron Blood, who would build a tower to reach the heavens."<br>
"O, Awe-inspiring Avalon, Magnificent Midgard!"<br>
"This is why they gather – to spread their own glory!"<br>
O, Heavenly Father–<br>
Will you not cast your judgment upon these sinners?<br>
<br>
Shortly afterwards...<br>
<span style="color:#ff9900;">Trento META：</span><br>
...Um, are you done yet?<br>
<span style="color:#ffd000;">Marco Polo：</span><br>
Yes, of course. So, what did you see?<br>
<span style="color:#ff9900;">Trento META：</span><br>
A flickering candle. An upside-down tower. And, stars without a reflection...?<br>
<span style="color:#ffd000;">Marco Polo：</span><br>
Well, that makes no freakin' sense! Is that supposed to be some kind of prophecy?<br>
So, let me tell you what I saw instead...<br>
Splendrous victory! Ahahahahahahaha!<br>
