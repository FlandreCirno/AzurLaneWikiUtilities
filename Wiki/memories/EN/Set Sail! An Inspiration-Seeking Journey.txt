<br>
1 Writer's Block<br>
Port - Office<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Hai Tien：</span><br>
Commander, I've brought you the itinerary for next week. Please go over it.<br>
<br>
Hai Tien, the newly-appointed secretary ship, hands me a schedule for the upcoming week as well as the corresponding task list.<br>
The schedule is packed with detailed notes, and the task list is numbered in order of priority. Everything is logically arranged and beyond reproach.<br>
However–<br>
The super-focused girl doesn't seem to notice that there are some peculiar strips of paper stuck to the documents she just handed me.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
("She leaps as hard as she can into the arms of the one she loves..." Scribbles. "Her lover's embrace is so strong, yet so very warm..." More scribbles.)<br>
(Scribbles... "The rain surrounds the two of them like a silken veil, casting the illusion that nothing exists between heaven and earth except for each other..." Scribbles.)<br>
(Huh. Is this a story that Hai Tien has been working on?)<br>
(There are a lot of things scribbled out, and she clearly threw the paper into a shredder... Maybe she's been struggling with her work?)<br>
(Though, writing a novel is a time-consuming process. Formulating the story's framework is no easy feat...)<br>
<br>
After gathering my thoughts, I decide to...<br>
<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项1：Give Hai Tien the rest of the day off.</span>'''''<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项2：Ask Hai Tien about the matter.</span>'''''<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项1）</span>'''''Mm. According to the itinerary, I should be able to take care of everything on my own today.<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项1）</span>'''''Why don't you go back and get some rest? Oh, but I don't mind if you'd like to stay in the office to get your personal work done.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项2）</span>'''''(There's no point making wild speculation. I might as well ask her since she's already here...)<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项2）</span>'''''Hai Tien, has something been bothering you lately?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Hai Tien：</span><br>
Huh? What do you mean by...<br>
D-did I do something to displease you? Have I failed to meet your expectations as secretary ship in any way?<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
That's not it at all. If anything, you've been doing remarkably well considering you were just assigned the job.<br>
You've already helped me in a whole lot of ways, so I'd like to take this opportunity to return the favor.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Hai Tien：</span><br>
Umm... If that's the case, I will accept your gracious offer.<br>
...So that's basically the gist of things.<br>
I've been going through a bit of writer's block, and now I can't come up with anything remotely satisfying anymore...<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Have you tried drawing inspiration from other works? Maybe a song or an old masterpiece of some sort?<br>
<br>
The girl shakes her head helplessly.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Hai Tien：</span><br>
I already tried that, but it didn't do anything.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Oh, I've got just the thing! You know how in the olden days, people would take long journeys through the rivers and mountains to draw inspiration for their poetry?<br>
Why don't we go on a camping trip of our own and give that a try? Maybe you'll find your inspiration somewhere along the way!<br>

<br>
2 Camping Preparations<br>
Hai Tien was more than glad to accept my invitation for a camping trip, and we started making preparations for our next day off.<br>
After wrapping up the remainder of the work, the two of us head out to the port's shopping district for our day off.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Hai Tien：</span><br>
Commander, I've consulted all my other peers and compiled a list of camping supplies. Let's follow this list when deciding what to buy.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Sounds good to me!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Owari：</span><br>
Woah, if it isn't Commander and Hai Tien! Are you guys out here to stock up for a camping trip?<br>
I'm quite familiar with that stuff, y'know, so feel free to gimme a holler!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Hai Tien：</span><br>
If memory serves me properly, don't you run a produce store, Miss Owari? I'm not sure you'd be able to help us with camping supplies...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Owari：</span><br>
Hmm~ Well, yeah, but fruits and veggies aren't the only things we sell. We've got a whole bunch of other useful stuff too.<br>
After all, doin' business around the port is no walk in the park. You've gotta branch out and expand your market share if you don't wanna strike out.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Akashi：</span><br>
Nya? Did I hear someone say they were shopping, nya?<br>
<br>
As if we had spoken forbidden words of power, a familiar green cat suddenly popped out right in front of us.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Akashi：</span><br>
Let's take a look at that shopping list you've got there, Hai Tien... Hrmm, hrmm... I see, I see, nya.<br>
Looking for camping supplies, nya? You'll find everything you're looking for, and more, in Akashi's store, nya~♪<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Owari：</span><br>
Wait, hold yer horses! I was the one who found these customers first! This is practically daylight robbery!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Akashi：</span><br>
Nya? In the end, it's the customer who decides where to do business, and with whom.<br>
That being the case, why don't we both bring our wares and let Commander and Hai Tien decide, nya?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Owari：</span><br>
You're on! Practically took the words right outta my mouth!<br>
<br>
Some time later...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Owari：</span><br>
*pant*... *pant*... Feel's like my tongue's going numb just explainin' all the different products...<br>
Why does Akashi look like she's not havin' a hard time at all?!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Akashi：</span><br>
Mwahaha... Well, well~ it comes with the turf, nya~!<br>
Drumroll please... and tadah! An 'oral spray that keeps your mouth hydrated no matter how much you talk', nya!<br>
An absolute essential for anyone who wants to do business! And, it can be yours for a cheap, cheap price of 9,999 coins, nya!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Owari：</span><br>
Woah, that sounds crazy useful! Gimme two canisters!<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
(...What's crazy is how she's had the tables turned on her completely. And how does anyone fall for that shady sales pitch anyway?)<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Akashi：</span><br>
Thanks for your patronyage!<br>
Now then, you two, have you decided on what you want, nya? Since it's your first time camping, you might want to make some extra preparations by buying everything. Just in case, nya~♪<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Owari：</span><br>
Exactly! Supplies aside, you'll also want to make sure you have a first aid kit and some non-perishable food on hand~<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Err... Why don't you give us some time to browse on our own first?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Hai Tien：</span><br>
Miss Owari certainly brought up a good point. While there seem to be a lot of things on the list, unforeseen circumstances can always pop out...<br>
I'd like this, and this. And all of these over here!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Akashi＆Owari：</span><br>
- Thank you, thank, nya! You are most generous, Hai Tien! - Thanks a ton for supporting my biz! Come back again next time~♪<br>
<br>
I wasn't able to stop Hai Tien from going on her shopping frenzy, nor did I want to rain on her parade either. In the end, we bought every last thing that Akashi and Owari brought.<br>

<br>
3 Set Sail! An Inspiration-Seeking Journey!<br>
I brought all our freshly-purchased wares back to the office and spread them out on the floor to organize them–<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
A tent, a tarp, two camping chairs, a foldable sunbed... Insect spray, wet wipes, sunscreen...<br>
Wait, what? Why is there an axe here?!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Hai Tien：</span><br>
Um, well, just in case we need firewood or encounter a ferocious beast... It's better to come prepared, right?<br>
<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项1：There shouldn't be any wild beasts around the port, I think...</span>'''''<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项2：I'm not sure how much of a threat wild beasts pose to cannon-toting shipgirls, but...</span>'''''<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Hai Tien：</span><br>
Y-yes, you're right...! We can leave the axe behind, and the crowbar as well...<br>
<br>
After returning a whole bunch of items we didn't plan on using such as walkie-talkies, a folding clothesrack, and a chainsaw...<br>
Hai Tien and I finally set out on our camping trip in search of inspiration.<br>
A bit later, in the woods behind the port...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Hai Tien：</span><br>
Phew... The air here is so crisp and refreshing. My mind already feels totally refreshed.<br>
I haven't had any flashes of inspiration yet, but at least my body feels lighter than before.<br>
<br>
Hai Tien has a smile on her face as she speaks. A squirrel hops down from the tree trunk, circles around her, and then darts off deeper into the woods.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Want to try following the squirrel?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Hai Tien：</span><br>
That sounds like an excellent idea! Thank you!<br>
<br>
The two of us head deeper into the woods as well, following the direction of the squirrel.<br>
It seems that we happened to go on our camping trip during the flowering season. A kaleidoscope of flowers are in full bloom everywhere we look, and I inadvertently slow down to admire them.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Hai Tien：</span><br>
Have these flowers piqued your interest, Commander? I happen to know a thing or two about them, if you'd like to learn more about them.<br>
<br>
Hai Tien's eyes are shimmering with anticipation. She clearly wants to demonstrate her knowledge to me.<br>
<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项1："I'd be glad to learn more."</span>'''''<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项2："Actually, I'm not too sure..."</span>'''''<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项1）</span>'''''You're my teacher today, Miss Hai Tien!<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项2）</span>'''''The scenery here is certainly beautiful, but...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Hai Tien：</span><br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项2）</span>'''''...But?<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项2）</span>'''''It pales in comparison to your beauty.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Hai Tien：</span><br>
*cough*, *cough*... Geez, Commander, please don't tease me like that...<br>
<br>
But, she is unable to hide the faint blush on her cheeks.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Hai Tien：</span><br>
Now that I think about it, you didn't come here just to hear me yap about flowers...<br>
Oh, right! Commander, have you ever heard of the Flying Flower Game? It's a game where we take turns reciting poetry verses around a particular word or theme, and the loser has to play a punishment round.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Sounds interesting. Definitely a good way to spruce up our stroll.<br>
Alright, let's do this!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Hai Tien：</span><br>
Heehee. Allow me to begin, then: "Before the Calyx Tower, spring is in full bloom."<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
(According to the rules, I have to respond with a poetry verse that includes a flower-themed word)<br>
<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项1："Beneath the swirling petals, glasses clink and feelings deepen."</span>'''''<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项2："Flowers and spring showers? Naw, we gon' make it rain!"</span>'''''<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Hai Tien：</span><br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项1）</span>'''''Wow, that's a great response, Commander, I'm surprised.<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项1）</span>'''''I shall continue then.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Hai Tien：</span><br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项2）</span>'''''Um, Commander... I believe we might be going a bit off-topic...<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项2）</span>'''''Ahem... Oh, is that so? It, uhh, might just be... yeah, a poem you've never heard before!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Hai Tien：</span><br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项2）</span>'''''Hrmm... Really now? Well, it matters not. I shall continue then.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Bring it! Let's see what you've got!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Hai Tien：</span><br>
"As moon waxes, floral shadows fall before the window."<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
"There rests a beauty, like a flower wreathed in clouds."<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Hai Tien：</span><br>
"Clothes like dancing clouds, cheeks like a rosy blossom."<br>
<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项1："The spring breeze gently caresses the steps, peonies even more beautiful in the rich dew."</span>'''''<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项2："And upon the branches bloom countless pear flowers."</span>'''''<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Hai Tien：</span><br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项1）</span>'''''Hmm... Commander, are you sure this verse connects with the previous one?<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项1）</span>'''''I guess not, but... When I look at you, it feels like everything wants to connect back to the starting verse...<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项1）</span>'''''"If not a fairy descended the mountains, she must be a goddess bathed in moonlight" ...I think those words describe you perfectly, Hai Tien.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Hai Tien：</span><br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项1）</span>'''''Um... I, I guess I can overlook this and not count this as your loss...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Hai Tien：</span><br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项2）</span>'''''Well done! Let's keep it up–<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Hai Tien：</span><br>
"As song comes from boats, flowers line the shore."<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Let me think... Urgh, I don't think I can come up with anything else...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Hai Tien：</span><br>
Heehee. It appears that I'm the victor. Now then... "A flower must be harvested when the time is right. Wait not until the branches are empty."<br>
Commander, would you mind making me a flower crown?<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
(A flower crown? That shouldn't be a very difficult request...)<br>
<br>
I nod my head and agree to go along with Hai Tien's request.<br>
Just as I am hard at work scavenging for flowers and branches, weaving them together into a circlet large enough to rest atop her head...<br>
I feel a slender, soft hand slide into my own, gently dropping a carefully-crafted ring of grass into my palm.<br>
My eyes turn towards the hand's owner. It is not just her cheeks that are bright red this time – even the tips of her ears are dyed an adorable pink.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Hai Tien：</span><br>
This is... my way of thanking you for the flower crown.<br>
<br>
Her voice sounds tender, almost wavering.<br>

<br>
4 A Short Story<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Hai Tien：</span><br>
Hum hum~♪<br>
<br>
Hai Tien walks next to me with a sprightly spring in her step, wearing the semblance of a flower crown that I had crafted on her head.<br>
As I follow her, I also wear the ring of grass she had made for me on my left hand.<br>
We continue to pass through a tiny trail in the forest, and eventually arrive at a pleasant clearing that seems perfect for camping.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Hai Tien：</span><br>
Commander, shall we pitch the tent? I'd be glad to help out.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Sure, good idea.<br>
<br>
Though this is the first time camping for both of us, we still manage to get the tent set up without any difficulty.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
(Hmm... The sun might get pretty intense soon. Maybe I should throw up the tarp?)<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Hai Tien：</span><br>
Commander, is there anything else I can help with?<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Uhh, I think I'll be fine. Here, I just finished unfolding the chairs. Take a breather and see if you can come up with any inspiration.<br>
I can put up the tarp by myself.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Hai Tien：</span><br>
Well then, I'll leave it to you.<br>
<br>
As I go to set up the tarp, I suddenly hear Hai Tien's voice.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Hai Tien：</span><br>
No, not like that! The emotion here is completely off! There needs to be more intimacy in your expression!<br>
Yes, yes, that's it! That's exactly how you should be looking at your crush!<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
(Hmm? That's weird... I don't think there's anyone else here, so who is she talking to...?)<br>
<br>
Curiosity gets the better of me, and I stop what I'm doing to head back to where Hai Tien is–<br>
At some point, a whole bunch of squirrels had lined up in front of her.<br>
And Hai Tien is... enthusiastically teaching them to act.<br>
When I listen in a bit more, I notice that the content of her "playbook" seems to be from the novel she was working on before.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Squirrel：</span><br>
Squeak, squeak!<br>
Squeak! Squeak squeak squeak!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Hai Tien：</span><br>
You're doing great~ That's exactly the emotion you want! Next, the storm scene is about to start!<br>
Hold your lover tight, and let her feel your heartbeat–<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
......<br>
<br>
There's a certain magic to her fairytale-like story that puts a wide smile on my face.<br>
The question is, how is Hai Tien able to teach the lines to the squirrels? Does she know how to communicate with them...?<br>

<br>
5 An Unseen Scenery<br>
I finish setting up the tarp and then come back to watch Hai Tien for a little longer before the squirrels scurry off.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Your story's pretty captivating, Hai Tien.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Hai Tien：</span><br>
Oh, umm... I got a bit carried away in the moment. I forgot that you'd be able to hear me.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
By the way, are you able to talk to squirrels?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Hai Tien：</span><br>
Huh? I definitely can't...<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
What? The way they were moving and responding to you made it seem like you were able to communicate with them...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Hai Tien：</span><br>
I think they were just responding to me being nice to them...<br>
The reason it looked like we were communicating is probably because of some preconception on your part, Commander~<br>
Since you've been working so hard, why don't you take a seat and rest for a while? We can take another walk around the area later.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Actually, I'm good to go still.<br>
<br>
I put down the work tools and start taking Hai Tien around our campsite.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Hai Tien：</span><br>
Hmm? Do you see that little trail over there?<br>
<br>
I look in the direction she's pointing.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Looks promising. Want to head over and take a look?<br>
<br>
The path leads to a grassy clearing, and there's even a little lake in the distance.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Hai Tien：</span><br>
"Winding paths lead to secluded beauty" ...I'm not sure this saying quite captures the essence of this place, but...<br>
This scenery is quite different from what we've seen so far in the woods.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
That's true.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Hai Tien：</span><br>
Heehee. That's an interesting idea. You certainly have a way with words, Commander.<br>
"Willow threads sway in the wind, the grass' garments trimmed by the rain"...<br>
I never expected to see such beautiful scenery here.<br>
Commander. I've got it. I think I just had an epiphany.<br>
<br>
The girl next to me gently gets up on her tiptoes, and rests her head against my shoulder.<br>

<br>
6 The Distance Between Us<br>
Hai Tien and I continue our leisurely stroll through this wonderful new scenery.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Hai Tien：</span><br>
Oh, I really should head back to the campsite soon.<br>
Shall we go together, Commander?<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Sure thing.<br>
<br>
Just at that time, rain starts to fall from what had been a seemingly boundless blue sky just moments ago.<br>
We are still a fair distance away from the campsite, and even if we try to hurry back, the trail would be muddy and slippery by the time we get there.<br>
To avoid any potential accidents, the two of us decide to take shelter nearby and wait for the rain to pass.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Looks like luck hasn't completely abandoned us after all. I didn't expect to find a cave like this so quickly...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Hai Tien：</span><br>
Heehee. Might this be the "promising" thing that you mentioned earlier?<br>
<br>
Hai Tien covers her mouth and giggles in a mischievous way that I've rarely seen from her before.<br>
It isn't until then that I notice, her casual clothes are drenched in rain and clinging tightly to her body.<br>
Maybe it's because the fabric is slightly transparent, but, I can't help but to marvel at her skin, almost as fair as pure white snow.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
*cough*... Oh, umm, there are some rocks and dry twigs here.<br>
Let's try to make a fire and dry our clothes out.<br>
<br>
After much effort, I am finally able to start a fire.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Hai Tien：</span><br>
It's getting a bit dull sitting around waiting for the rain to stop... Want me to tell you a fairytale to pass the time?<br>
<br>
As Hai Tien nestles up to me, the light from the bonfire flickers in her eyes, making her gaze even more dazzling than usual.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Is it a story that you wrote yourself?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Hai Tien：</span><br>
Not this time. Commander, have you ever heard of the "Legend of the Umbrella Lent Upon a Lakeside Sojourn"?<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
I can't say I have.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Hai Tien：</span><br>
In ancient times, there once was a man named Xu Xian who was sweeping tombs during the Qingming Festival. When he reached West Lake, it started raining all of a sudden.<br>
During the heavy rain, he met a white snake spirit that had transformed itself into a young girl.<br>
The two shared the same boat, and began to fall in love with one another...<br>
<br>
Hai Tien cups her cheeks with her palms, smiling softly as she continues her story.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Hai Tien：</span><br>
By the time the boat reaches the shore, the rain has still not let up, so Xu Xian lends his oil-paper umbrella to the girl.<br>
And that umbrella becomes a symbol of the love between them.<br>
Unfortunately...<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Hm?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Hai Tien：</span><br>
Unfortunately, even though we're caught up in the heavy rain, I'm unable to be like the snake spirit-turned-girl and borrow something from you...<br>
<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项1："You've already borrowed something from me."</span>'''''<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项2："You've already given me something precious."</span>'''''<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Hai Tien：</span><br>
Huh?<br>
<br>
I hold out my left hand to the confused Hai Tien and show her the ring woven from grass that she had given me earlier.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Hai Tien：</span><br>
That's... the ring I made for you today...<br>
Wait, Commander... Does this mean...?<br>
<br>
Suddenly, as if a realization had just dawned upon Hai Tien, the girl leaps straight into my arms.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Hai Tien：</span><br>
Umm, Commander, you're still soaking wet, and even if there's a bonfire here, it's still quite cold inside the cave...<br>
I apologize for my indiscretion, but... this is for the sake of your health!<br>
<br>
The constant pitter-patter of the rain seemingly cuts the two of us off from the outside world.<br>
The light from the flame suddenly dances in a flurry, and my vision is temporarily obscured by the flight of the girl's damp clothes–<br>
And all that I see next is lustrous, moist skin, as fair as pure white snow.<br>

7 Wellspring of Inspiration<br>
Perhaps it was the heat from the bonfire, or perhaps it was the warmth of our bodies pressed together.<br>
I'm not sure when it was that we fell asleep, but when I next open my eyes, the rain had already stopped.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Hai Tien?<br>
<br>
The girl next to me still has her eyes shut, her lips curled into a slight smile, a look of contentment on her face.<br>
As I call out to her, she slowly begins to stir.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Hai Tien：</span><br>
Huh...? Commander?<br>
<br>
When she realizes how "close" the two of us are, a familiar blush once again spreads across her cheek.s<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Hai Tien：</span><br>
Um, I'm so sorry for what just happened... I don't know what came over me...<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
It's fine, don't worry about it.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Hai Tien：</span><br>
C-Commander... Since the rain has stopped, umm.. sh-should we put out the fire and head back?<br>
<br>
The embarrassment from her words is so thick that it's almost palpable.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Mm, sounds good to me.<br>
<br>
We step out from the cave, back into the picturesque scenery we had accidentally discovered.<br>
After the rain, the sun shines brightly once more. A rainbow streaks across the clear, blue sky.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Hai Tien：</span><br>
"The seven-colored bridge cleaves the rain, the autumnal sky pristine and clear. Upon the mounts' brow, fresh verdance doth appear."<br>
Though the seasons don't quite line up, the scene that this poem describes really resonates with me.<br>
I'm so glad that I was able to enjoy such a splendid view together with you, Commander. Going on this camping trip truly was a worthwhile experience.<br>
Last but not least, I've found the inspiration to continue my story.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Oh, right. You did say you had an epiphany earlier when we were taking in the scenery.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Hai Tien：</span><br>
Yes, that's right.<br>
The inspiration only came to me because I was with you.<br>
More importantly... When love nestles within your heart, words will flow forth freely like a fountain.<br>
In other words, the wellspring of my inspiration... is none other than you, Commander.<br>
<br>
Hai Tien takes my left hand and gently strokes the ring that she had woven herself. Her adorable smile blooms as brightly as any flower.<br>
