My Fond Memories<br>
<br>
Chapter 1: A Small Luncheon<br>
Port - School Courtyard<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Achilles：</span><br>
My~ It sure has been a while since we last partook of lunch together~<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ajax：</span><br>
I must say, Leander's cooking is simply delicious, without fail.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Leander：</span><br>
Ajax, isn't it about time you learned how to cook too? Considering how you're still making Commander cook all the time...<br>
<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项1：With pleasure, Your Highness!</span>'''''<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项2：Ugh, how mortifying...! But I just can't help it!</span>'''''<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Achilles：</span><br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项1）</span>'''''Well, the person in question is happy about it, so isn't it fine?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ajax：</span><br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项1）</span>'''''Right? Commander is actually quite a hard worker, though it's not always apparent.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Achilles：</span><br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项2）</span>'''''I-Is that so...?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ajax：</span><br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项2）</span>'''''Hehe~♪ Well then, what's the problem~?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Leander：</span><br>
Ajax, you shouldn't bully Commander around too much, all right? Here, have a drink.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ajax：</span><br>
Thanks... Phew. Oh my, are you thirsty too, Commander? Would you like some water?<br>
<br>
Ajax held out the water bottle that she had just been drinking from.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Achilles：</span><br>
C-Could this be...! An indirect kiss...?!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ajax：</span><br>
Go on, take a sip. Or... would you prefer it mouth to mouth~?<br>
<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项3：(Take a sip)</span>'''''<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Leander：</span><br>
Jeez... I don't know anything about "indirect kisses" or whatever, but could you stop bothering the Commander already?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Achilles：</span><br>
You might be wrong about that...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ajax：</span><br>
Okaaay~ It seems like we can't do these kinds of things where Leander can see.<br>
But, if you do want to do these kinds of things with me later, I'll let you drink as much as you'd like, okay~?<br>
Please, do look forward to it. Hehe~♪<br>

<br>
Chapter 2: The Meaning of Glory<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Exeter：</span><br>
Ajax, you're really...!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ajax：</span><br>
I was simply speaking from a logical perspective. After all, we have a higher chance of victory if we face them in a night battle rather than facing them head-on.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Exeter：</span><br>
Enough already, you're dragging the Royal Navy's Glory through the mud by ignoring the position of allies that have requested for help, are you not?!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ajax：</span><br>
Exeter, aren't you the one getting carried away by putting too much emphasis on "Glory"? Splitting our allied forces up like that, are you planning on fighting the enemy's main fleet by yourself? Though, if that's what you were going for, I wouldn't have stopped you~♪<br>
<br>
As always, Exeter and Ajax were quarreling with each other.<br>
Ajax's battle plans were surprisingly logical and accurate. That said, because she prioritized logic over all else, it appeared that she wasn't able to meet eye-to-eye with girls who prioritized honor or formalities.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Exeter：</span><br>
Grr...! There's no point in arguing about this any further. I'll just follow the Commander's plans when it's time!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ajax：</span><br>
Are you running away? Or should I say, making an honorable retreat?<br>
<br>
As one was bound to get more worked up the more the opponent rebutted one's argument, oftentimes the situation would get more and more tangled up...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ajax：</span><br>
I apologized properly to Exeter, since this is just what always happens.<br>
Since Exeter is the kind of person who won’t listen even if you try to persuade her, is it not faster to anger her and then make her cave in, rather than explaining to her for days on end?<br>
Well, that's also because my plans rely on you to come in there to deal the finishing blow~♪<br>
<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项1：Even if that's the case, you don't have to mess with her so much...</span>'''''<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ajax：</span><br>
My, it appears that you do not support my actions, even though I am the secretary ship. Quite commendable, Commander.<br>
Even though you're usually so gentle, you can act like a proper commander when it counts.<br>
... And that's why I like you. Hehe~♪<br>

Chapter 3: The Secretary Ship's Responsibilities<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ajax：</span><br>
Commander. Here are the itinerary and exercise schedules that have been planned for the day, along with the situation reports from each sea zone patrol.<br>
Also, here is the tally of the school's equipment, the inventory of our raw materials, the acquisition requests from the shop, the list of commissions entrusted to us, the progress of uniforms being manufactured, and the inventory of the blueprint storehouse.<br>
And submission of the observation data of Sirens to the higher-ups, maintenance of mental cubes, and what’s left is the organization of Her Highness Elizabeth’s public assistance program...<br>
As stated in the report, everything is progressing without any issues.<br>
Right, this concludes today's duties as the secretary ship. Commander, thank you for your hard work.<br>
<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项1：Thanks, Ajax.</span>'''''<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ajax：</span><br>
Hehe~ I am merely doing the work of a Secretary Ship. Feel free to sit back and relax, Commander.<br>
... You'll be making dinner and tomorrow's breakfast, won't you? As well as handling the cleaning?<br>
Tomorrow I'm off-duty, so I’m going shopping with Achilles. I’d like for it to be earlier than usual.<br>
<br>
Though Ajax was able to perform her duties as a secretary ship flawlessly, there was one glaring characteristic about her work...<br>
And that was - she was unable to properly do anything that remotely fell under the category of "chores."<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ajax：</span><br>
Are you dissatisfied? Even if I'm like this, I believe that I am properly handling my duties as secretary ship.<br>
Or, could it be that you intend to make me do these chores, Commander?<br>
Hehe~ I'm alright with doing just a liiittle bit, but... my evaluation of you will drop, Commander.<br>
You're aware that you may ask a member of the maid team for help if needed, right? Of course, only if you're not satisfied with simply pushing chores onto your secretary ship, but also want to make a pass at one of the maids... Oh you~♪<br>
You'd happily do something like that, wouldn't you? Little piggy~♪<br>
<br>
Ajax was... bad at housework.<br>

<br>
Chapter 4: Friend? Foe?<br>
Port - Hallway<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ajax：</span><br>
I've always thought about this, but... I'd love for an "incident" to occur on one of my patrols.<br>
Don't you think so too, Commander? For example...<br>
<br>
Ajax entwined her arm around mine.<br>
<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项1：...?!</span>'''''<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项1：?! ...?!</span>'''''<br>
<br>
I felt a soft but slightly firm sensation pressing against my skin.<br>
...<br>
Hm? The person over there is...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Admiral Graf Spee：</span><br>
Ajax...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ajax：</span><br>
Oh, if it isn't Spee. Are you taking a walk by your lonesome?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Admiral Graf Spee：</span><br>
In poor taste, as always. ... I feel bad for the Commander.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ajax：</span><br>
I wonder. To me, it doesn't seem like the Commander is bothered at all, isn't that right? Could it be that actually, you want to do something like this as well, Spee?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Admiral Graf Spee：</span><br>
Not really... Unlike you, I don't have any interest in teasing the Commander. If I did so, I would sully the name of the Iron Blood.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ajax：</span><br>
You're suuure telling me, even though you've already lost once. Or, could it be that looking at this little piggy has made you feel jealous?<br>
<br>
The feeling of a heated rivalry between them... was nonexistent.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Admiral Graf Spee：</span><br>
... Sigh... Never mind what just happened. The restaurant we went to last time was pretty good. Will you take me there again some time?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ajax：</span><br>
Sure thing~ I really like that place too. Well, since that store has a strict "No Pets" policy... our little piggy won't be able to go~♪<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Admiral Graf Spee：</span><br>
Is that so... Also, regarding the outfit you gave me the other day... when Hipper saw it, she got really mad at me for some reason... I wonder if it's fine...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ajax：</span><br>
It's perfectly fine. Because those sweaters are especially effective against virgins, it will raise your battle power considerably more than it would otherwise seem.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Admiral Graf Spee：</span><br>
I-I guess so... Thanks, Ajax.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ajax：</span><br>
Hehe~ I guess I'll have to ask Oklahoma for more good restaurant recommendations...<br>
<br>
Before I knew it, Ajax had left me behind, all alone.<br>

Chapter 5: Cute Little Piggy<br>
When I woke up, I was in the bed in the office.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ajax：</span><br>
What a troublesome little piggy... Didn't I tell you to rest properly?<br>
Since you're already having me nurse you back like this, if you don't follow my every order, you're going to be punished~<br>
Hmm... How should I tease you once your cold gets better... I'm getting excited just thinking about it~<br>
<br>
My head feels dull and sluggish... It seems like I've caught the cold.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ajax：</span><br>
But you know, I can't just neglect the work that has been piling up just because you're out with the cold, so...<br>
Tonight, I'm going to stay up all night - I shall take care of work while also taking care of you. lit~tle~ pig~gy~♪<br>
Why are you a little piggy, you ask? Why are you only asking this now?<br>
To me, anyone that's worth teasing is a little piggy, you know? ... Well, that said, little pet piggies are special to me.<br>
<br>
After replacing the soaked towel on my forehead, Ajax brought a bowl of chicken noodle soup and a spoon over.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ajax：</span><br>
I went through the trouble of making some chicken noodle soup. Eat it while it's still hot, got it?<br>
Okay, open your mouth. Say ahhhn~.<br>
<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项1：Ahhhn...</span>'''''<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ajax：</span><br>
Wait, it's still too hot... Phew~<br>
<br>
...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ajax：</span><br>
Alright, once again. Say ahhhn~?<br>
<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项1：Ahhhn...</span>'''''<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ajax：</span><br>
Good piggy~ ...Earlier, I said that pets are different, right? Despite the way I am, I still love pets.<br>
But, the ones I'm raising are... hehe, to be exact, there's only one. So...<br>
Get well soon, little piggy~♡<br>

Chapter 6: Stubbornness and Sincerity - Part 1<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ajax：</span><br>
Achoo...!<br>
<br>
Ajax was in bed, her face flushed red. The thermometer indicated that she had a high fever.<br>
Though ships were said to be quite different from regular humans, it seems that they can still contract colds.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ajax：</span><br>
Good grief, colds truly are troublesome...<br>
The secretary work is at a standstill, I can't learn how to cook from Leander, and...<br>
Ugh... There's absolutely nothing good about this...<br>
And on top of it all, I have to be seen in this kind of state by my little piggy...<br>
<br>
It seems that she won't be satisfied unless she can be in control of the situation.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ajax：</span><br>
If I had things my way... I'd be laughing while teasing my little bedridden piggy...<br>
I guess today is my turn to be laughed at... It's fine to leave me by myself today... I won't punish you for it later, so...<br>
What is it? After seing me weakened like this, are you thinking something like, "Today is the day I'll get even with her!" or something?<br>
Sigh... Considering how much I tease your normally... to be honest, I'm simply getting my just desserts.<br>
Achoo! ...Well, do as you please.<br>
<br>
Gently drape a wet towel on Ajax's forehead.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ajax：</span><br>
...Huh...?<br>
You... why...<br>
<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项1：And now, we're even.</span>'''''<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ajax：</span><br>
Jeez... Anything would have been fine... *sniffle*... *cry*...<br>
<br>
Ajax hid her face in the sheets.<br>

Chapter 7: Stubbornness and Sincerity - Part 2<br>
Around one hour after nursing Ajax.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ajax：</span><br>
*Sniffle*... *cry*... Why do I have no choice but to be treated like this by little piggy...<br>
I... I... Ugh...<br>
Uwaaah...<br>
<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项1：Try teasing Ajax</span>'''''<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ajax：</span><br>
Waaah... Why am I being teased by my little piggy...?!<br>
You little...! Mark my words, when I get better...! When I get better, I'm going to...<br>
<br>
It seemed that she was throwing a tantrum in bed.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ajax：</span><br>
As I am right now, I can't punish you...<br>
Ugh... having this happen to me... There's no other choice... I'll have to step all over you!<br>
<br>
...<br>
Suddenly, all movement in the bed stopped.<br>
<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项2：Get closer to check on Ajax</span>'''''<br>
<br>
When I got closer to check on how Ajax was doing, she suddenly pulled me under the sheets.<br>
I felt Ajax's breath close to my face...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ajax：</span><br>
I'm sorry... I, just can't live on being pampered like this...<br>
Having only my face be flushed red, being the only one that has to be seen in this weak state... is absolutely unfair.<br>
So this time... shall we both have a cold, together?<br>
My beloved little piggy~♡<br>
