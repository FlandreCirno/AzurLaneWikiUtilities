Fun & Play Holiday<br>
Port - Harbor<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Asuka：</span><br>
Man, I envy you girls.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Reno：</span><br>
Envy us? How so? Is this about the food again?<br>
Because you really gushed about the sashimi the Commander treated you to yesterday.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Asuka：</span><br>
What? Oh, yeah, that was amazing. So fresh, so piquant, so... Wait, that's not what I was thinking about!<br>
True, I do envy the food you girls get here, but it was something else...<br>
Right! The sea! Opening my window and hearing the waves! The smell of the ocean when I go outside to grab a bite!<br>
Leaving the dorm and feeling the cool breeze! Walking just a short distance and seeing the beautiful coast!<br>
And finally, a body of water being just a short walk away when I wanna swim! I envy you because it's all so great.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Reno：</span><br>
Well, sure, there's fun to be had at sea, but the sea basically means exercises and expeditions for us.<br>
We also get in a more somber mindset once we put our riggings on.<br>
While it's nice being so close to the sea, it's more convenient for going on missions than it is for enjoying yourself.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Asuka：</span><br>
Oh, really? Huh. But I've seen girls wearing both swimsuits AND riggings when they disembark.<br>
Were they going on some sort of special mission?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Reno：</span><br>
You mean the submarines, right? They fight under the water, so they wear swimsuits optimized for diving.<br>
Now that you mention it, though, I could also fight in a swimsuit if I wanted!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Asuka：</span><br>
Really?! Well, I can't... I tried a swimsuit the other day and couldn't equip my rigging for some reason.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Reno：</span><br>
Maybe you need a special swimsuit designed for rigging use.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Asuka：</span><br>
Or one made with special fabric...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Akashi：</span><br>
What are you girls chatting about, nya?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Reno：</span><br>
Akashi? Where'd the HECK did you come from?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Asuka：</span><br>
You appeared out of nowhere, almost like a ninja!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Akashi：</span><br>
Heh. My methods are a trade secret, nya.<br>
Anyway, I'm dropping by to deliver Asuka's new swimsuit, nya. The Commander requested one, and it's finally done, nya. Just sign here, nya.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Asuka：</span><br>
Sign where? The dotted line?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Akashi：</span><br>
Yep, nya. My work here is done, and I've got places to be, so... toodles, nya!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Asuka：</span><br>
Gone just as quickly as she came... Is this swimsuit what I think it is?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Reno：</span><br>
Wow, perfect timing on the Commander's part! Now you can go into battle wearing a swimsuit!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Asuka：</span><br>
Heck yeah! That sounds like it'd be a bucketload of fun! I so wanna try that.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Reno：</span><br>
You do? Then go for it. I'll call some people and we'll organize a mock battle!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Asuka：</span><br>
Just for little ol' me? Aww, thank you so much!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Owari：</span><br>
Ahahah! Wasn't expectin' this when I woke up today. It's cool, though – just so happens my schedule's empty!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Unzen：</span><br>
Look at us, all wearing swimsuits. Heehee. What a magnificent sight.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Asuka：</span><br>
Whoooa! You look so good! Like you came straight out of a TV show!<br>
Seriously! I'm not exaggerating when I say you look like models! You're gorgeous, you're sex bombs, you're... so much prettier than me!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">New Jersey：</span><br>
Don't say that. You're a real bombshell yourself!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Asuka：</span><br>
Y-you think so? Heehee. You're just saying that!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Shimakaze：</span><br>
I would argue all you shinobis are slim to perfection and have curves that could kill, though.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Hatsuzuki：</span><br>
Take Fubuki, for one. She's drop-dead sexy.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Asuka：</span><br>
That's true! She is one pretty lady...<br>
Oh, Yumi, too! How she sparkles like falling snowflakes... She's got such a mystical vibe!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Reno：</span><br>
Guess who's ready! Heehee! How do I look?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Asuka：</span><br>
Cute as all heck!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Reno：</span><br>
Thanks! So, let's all do some stretches, then get this mock battle started, shall we?<br>
The Commander got us these swimsuits, so let's put on a cute battle as thanks!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Everyone：</span><br>
Okay!<br>

Trainers Training Trainees - Part 1<br>
Port - Gymnasium<br>
The shinobis were undergoing intensive training...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Reno：</span><br>
Gotcha!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ikaruga：</span><br>
I'm afraid not! That is only an illusion!<br>
<br>
BONK!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Reno：</span><br>
Owwww... You pulled a fast one on me!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Kirishima：</span><br>
You've got a lot of training to do if you're falling for simple tricks like that, mecha-ninja.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Haguro：</span><br>
"Mecha-ninja"... Wonder which game you got that name from– Oof!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ikaruga：</span><br>
To get distracted during training is to underestimate your teacher. It's time for punishment!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Haguro：</span><br>
W-wait! I'm sorry! I'll take this seriously from now o– Aaahhh!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Kirishima：</span><br>
Scoring a point only for this to happen... Cramming all night clearly backfired on you.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Haguro：</span><br>
Yeah, sorry...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ikaruga：</span><br>
You must watch the battle carefully and make the right decisions accordingly. Taking all-or-nothing risks is the worst thing shinobis can do.<br>
They should be able to determine if what they see is real or an illusion, a commitment or a feint.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Reno：</span><br>
I know that, it's just... How do I put this... Your way of teaching is pretty punishing.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Homura：</span><br>
Pfft!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ikaruga：</span><br>
What?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Homura：</span><br>
Your draconian nature is showing!<br>
<br>
Meanwhile, outside the gymnasium...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Akatsuki：</span><br>
How I envy them...<br>
Speaking to them was so easy during the mission, but now, back at the port, I feel too shy...<br>
Asking a genuine ninja for their teachings is so, so discourteous!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Bremerton：</span><br>
Akatsuki? Whatcha doin' in there?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Akatsuki：</span><br>
Hibiki?! Oh, it's you, Bremerton... Please don't scare me so.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Bremerton：</span><br>
Uh, sorry. So, why aren't you training with the others?<br>
Are you hiding here as part of some special training or whatever?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Akatsuki：</span><br>
No, I'm just... Well...<br>
...And that's essentially it.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Bremerton：</span><br>
Ahh... I mean, you fought the Sirens side-by-side with 'em. It makes no sense to be afraid now.<br>
You know what? You've got a problem, and I'm gonna help you solve it!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Akatsuki：</span><br>
What? No, wait! Wait a second!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Bremerton：</span><br>
Hey! Sorry to interrupt!<br>
I just was wondering if you could instruct Akatsuki on her training. You folks got the time?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Homura：</span><br>
Huh? No, I don't, I'm busy. Really busy with something. Haven't been this busy in aaages.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Bremerton：</span><br>
Ohhh, I see. You can't just walk up and ask an evil ninja for something.<br>
<br>
KA-CLICK!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Homura：</span><br>
Whoa, whoa! Easy! What's the deal with the huge cannon all of a sudden?!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Bremerton：</span><br>
C'mon, you've got time. At least enough to help Akatsuki out.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Homura：</span><br>
Okay, okay! I'll do it, just put that thing away!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Bremerton：</span><br>
Great! Be nice to her now, 'kay?<br>

Trainers Training Trainees - Part 2<br>
Port - Gymnasium<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Homura：</span><br>
Phew... So, we doing this?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Akatsuki：</span><br>
Yes. I'm ready.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Homura：</span><br>
Come on! You can't fall for such a simple feint! Use your judgment to determine when an attack is fake or real!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Akatsuki：</span><br>
S-sorry! I'll try!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Homura：</span><br>
And don't just stand there when your opponent activates a spell! Block or dodge!<br>
You've gotta develop a habit of reacting in time to when they start casting!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Akatsuki：</span><br>
That's really difficult... The path of a shinobi is harsh and unforgiving...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ikaruga：</span><br>
You're leagues and bounds more draconian than I am, Homura! Are you okay, Akatsuki?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Akatsuki：</span><br>
*whimper*... As they say, spare the rod and spoil the child...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Kirishima：</span><br>
She's so overwhelmed she's lost her senses. Give her some water and let her rest for a bit.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Haguro：</span><br>
You don't think you could, y'know, go a little easier on her?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Homura：</span><br>
You kidding? Nothing's gonna stick if I'm not strict with her. But... Hmm, lemme think.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Haguro：</span><br>
Is that a "fine" I hear? Akatsuki, you can take five. We'll also go ahead and–<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Homura：</span><br>
A real fight is the best kind of practice. Ikaruga, you're gonna help out. Same with the rest of you.<br>
We're doing a mock battle. Several of you against one of us. If you're still standing by the end of it, your training's done for the day.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Haguro：</span><br>
...Are you serious?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Akatsuki：</span><br>
No, please! Let's just stick to regular training!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Homura：</span><br>
It's do or die, Akatsuki!<br>
<br>
Sometime later...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Bremerton：</span><br>
Yo, Akatsuki, you good? You still breathin'?<br>
...Yeah, nah. She's totally out cold.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Homura：</span><br>
Hmm... I'll compromise and say she passed, if just barely.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ikaruga：</span><br>
Did it make you happy, seeing her last until the end? Heehee. Just admit it.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Homura：</span><br>
Shut up!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ikaruga：</span><br>
You all did a stellar job today. Someone, please carry Akatsuki to her dorm room.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Kirishima：</span><br>
Thanks for taking the time to teach us your ninjutsu. I've learned so much from you.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Akatsuki：</span><br>
Zzzzz...<br>
Witness my ultimate technique... Destroyer ninjutsu... Torpedo Blitz... Zzzzz...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Bremerton：</span><br>
Hah! Sounds like she's still training in her dreams.<br>

<br>
Teenage High School Ninja Girls - Part 1<br>
Port - Break Room<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Baltimore：</span><br>
Hey, tell me about your school. What's Gessen Girls' Academy like?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Yumi：</span><br>
Oh? Why do you ask?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Baltimore：</span><br>
We've got an academy of our own, so I figured it's something to talk about.<br>
Plus, I'm a little curious about what an academy for ninjas is actually like.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Yumi：</span><br>
I'm afraid you'll find the answer rather boring.<br>
For a start, the Shijuku Gessen Girls' Academy is a school specializing in raising shinobis.<br>
It's a bit different to ordinary schools. The curriculum is mainly centered around practicing ninjutsu.<br>
Which is to say... Well, it's not much different from the training we do on a daily basis here.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Yūyaki：</span><br>
In the case of the Tohno Tengu Shinobi Group, it may be a misnomer to even call us a "school."<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Unzen：</span><br>
Tengu Group... From the name alone, it sounds like you'd reside up in the mountains, and not in a school building within a town.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Yumi：</span><br>
Yes, the Hidden Village is something quite different. I suppose you could call it a school for shinobi that has existed in Japan since ancient times.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Yūyaki：</span><br>
What about Asuka's school? Isn't Hanzō National Academy fairly normal?<br>
If nothing else, it does present itself as being ordinary.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Baltimore：</span><br>
Do you study general subjects there? Y'know, math, history...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Yumi：</span><br>
All the standard subjects are important parts of our school's curriculum as well, actually.<br>
I would assume you shipgirls learn the same things about society as us. Shinobis need to blend into the world, after all.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Fubuki：</span><br>
Yep, we learn all kinds of stuff at the academy! Not much teacher variety, though – it's always the same shipgirl...<br>
There are lectures, combat training, and tests, of course. The only we don't really have is a uniform.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Baltimore：</span><br>
Oh, yeah. I'd almost forgotten that.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Yumi：</span><br>
You... don't have a uniform?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Baltimore：</span><br>
Nope. It's fair game to wear clothes resembling a uniform, or you could wear your regular fit if you want. Commander says both are fine.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Memphis：</span><br>
Honestly, sometimes it feels like the students are straight-up cosplaying at school.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Fubuki：</span><br>
As long as it's cute, I don't mind what people wear!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Memphis：</span><br>
Looking cute is not what's important with uniforms...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Yumi：</span><br>
To be fair, even in our case, I feel like many regard our respective shinobi attires as their true uniforms.<br>
Oh, I'm not saying we don't like the uniforms we wear every day. It is an essential part of blending in with society.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Yūyaki：</span><br>
But there are also some who take it off at the first chance.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Yumi：</span><br>
That is true. Oftentimes, they also get torn in unavoidable circumstances. Despite them being made of strong fabric...<br>

<br>
Teenage High School Ninja Girls - Part 2<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Baltimore：</span><br>
Speaking of schools, any decent one's gotta have seasonal events, too. With all kinds of attractions.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Unzen：</span><br>
While I wouldn't call it a school trip, we also sometimes go on trips together with the Commander.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Yūyaki：</span><br>
I don't think journeys thousands of kilometers from home can be called "trips"...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Fubuki：</span><br>
Ahahah... So, events. Do you have sports days, and stuff?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Yumi：</span><br>
We have something similar – competitive events where we demonstrate the fruits of all our training.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Yūyaki：</span><br>
Those are important to help us gauge the skills of other schools.<br>
They are also a way for us to measure how strong we ourselves are.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Memphis：</span><br>
This topic turned into something much bigger than school events...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Baltimore：</span><br>
You got some kind of system where teams get points based on their placing in the competitions?<br>
With the top team being given exposure, of course.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Yumi：</span><br>
Hmm... I think we have something similar.<br>
Ours involves one person taking out the most enemies they can and being awarded points accordingly. Does that count?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Fubuki：</span><br>
Wait... Enemies? As in, enemies-enemies?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Yumi：</span><br>
Yes. Exactly that.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Memphis：</span><br>
Geesh. Brutal...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Yumi：</span><br>
I think a few of the categories may also be replicable here.<br>
Obviously, the scale and rules will need to be changed somewhat, but the idea should stay largely the same.<br>
Would you shipgirls like to participate as well?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Unzen：</span><br>
Yes, please. It would provide invaluable experience for the future.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Fubuki：</span><br>
A cross-worlds sports competition, eh? Could be fun.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Baltimore：</span><br>
I'll let girls from all the other factions know they're welcome as well!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Memphis：</span><br>
It's an opportunity to learn new things. I'll fill out an event application form to the Commander.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Yūyaki：</span><br>
Great. Then I'll call my fellow shinobis and start setting everything up.<br>
<br>
The following day, in the gymnasium...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Fubuki：</span><br>
Holy smokes! Ayanami's team really brought their A-game today.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Yūyaki：</span><br>
As expected, we couldn't replicate the competition to a T. Still, this is more or less what it's like.<br>
By the way, Baltimore – you mentioned yesterday that you have sports days. What are those like?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Yumi：</span><br>
Please don't tell me you play catch with depth charges, or shoot clay pigeons out of the air...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Baltimore：</span><br>
Obviously, we don't do anything THAT dangerous.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Reno：</span><br>
We can show you what a sports day is like. We've still got time to spare!<br>
<br>
Sometime later...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Yūyaki：</span><br>
Gosh, this looks like a lot of fun! I wish we had something like this at our schools.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Yumi：</span><br>
You know, after seeing this for myself, I've been thinking...<br>
Is their idea of a "sports day" not more normal than ours?<br>
I've read books on everyday life before which describe a sports day very much like this, so...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Yūyaki：</span><br>
Yumi, you mean...?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Yumi：</span><br>
......<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Yūyaki：</span><br>
Let's discuss it with our fellow shinobi when we get back home.<br>

Start the Training - Part 1<br>
Port - Training Area Campsite<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Asuka：</span><br>
Akatsukiii!<br>
I'm gonna climb that rock over there for training's sake. You wanna come with me?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Akatsuki：</span><br>
Of course! I would love to accompany you!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ikazuchi：</span><br>
I see! This is what you'd call a random event!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Inazuma：</span><br>
Finishing it should award you with a significant amount of affection.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Hibiki：</span><br>
There they go, doing stuff for no reason again. Oh well, it's nice to see Akatsuki in such high spirits for once.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ikaruga：</span><br>
It's a problem when they get carried away. While being active is good, it's important to rest up after intense exercise.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Kashino：</span><br>
Hey, girls! Who wants a cold bottle of milk?<br>
...By the way, where's Murasaki? Shouldn't she be here?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Homura：</span><br>
Nah. If I had to guess, she's probably playing video games in her room again.<br>
<br>
Meanwhile, in a dark corner of the island...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Murasaki：</span><br>
This was a mistake... I fell for the sound of people having fun... Going outside was a horrible mistake...<br>
I'd much rather be somewhere dark and quiet where I can relax by myself...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Leipzig：</span><br>
Why does it have to be so sunny... I feel like I'm going to faint...<br>
Almost there... Almost at the campsite... Fishy, I need your encouragement right now...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Murasaki：</span><br>
......<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Leipzig：</span><br>
......<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Murasaki&{namecode:424}：</span><br>
Umm...Aren't you...?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Hatsuharu：</span><br>
Eep!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Murasaki&{namecode:424}：</span><br>
Who's there?!Eek!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Hatsuharu：</span><br>
Oh... S-sorry. I didn't expect to see people here at this time of day.<br>
I-I'll be out of your hair soon... Just give me a minute...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Torricelli：</span><br>
Heheh... Heheheheh...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Murasaki&{namecode:424}&{namecode:30}：</span><br>
EEEEEEEEK!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Torricelli：</span><br>
AAAAAAHHHHH!<br>
Y-you nearly scared me to death... You don't have to scream so loud...<br>
I-in case you didn't know... I've been here since the start...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Murasaki：</span><br>
You have? Oh... Sorry. I didn't realize when I first got here.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Hatsuharu：</span><br>
L-like I said, I'll be out of here before you know it... I-I won't be long...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">New Jersey：</span><br>
What's going on here? Some kind of party?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Everyone Else：</span><br>
AAAAAAAHHHHHHHHHHH!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">New Jersey：</span><br>
So, basically, you wanna participate in the exercise, but you lack the courage to show up.<br>
Now you're all meeting up here with others who aren't participating either. Is that right?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Murasaki：</span><br>
Not exactly... It's not like... we all agreed to meet here or anything.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">New Jersey：</span><br>
Ah. So you independently opted for a place where there's few people, then?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Murasaki：</span><br>
Correct...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">New Jersey：</span><br>
You don't like dealing with people, I suppose...<br>
Oh! That gives me an idea! Heheh!<br>

Start the Training - Part 2<br>
Training Area - Somewhere else<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Torricelli：</span><br>
So... What's the point in forcing us to come here, exactly?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Hatsuharu：</span><br>
That's a lot of mass-produced training ships...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Murasaki：</span><br>
A-and their guns are trained on US!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Leipzig：</span><br>
Is this... what I think it is?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">New Jersey：</span><br>
Yup! Since you can't handle groups of people, I got you some non-people opponents!<br>
Take your time getting used to practicing with these and you'll be ready to try the real deal with the rest of us!<br>
(Heheh. I'm a genius.)<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Torricelli：</span><br>
St-starting mission... I'll go underwater...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">New Jersey：</span><br>
Also, there's swarms of mass-produced subs waiting under the surface. There's nowhere to run!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Murasaki：</span><br>
N-nowhere to run? Umm...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">New Jersey：</span><br>
Don't worry! You've got me for backup!~<br>
I'll handle the small stuff so you can focus on the bigger picture. Plus, we'll get buddy-buddy faster if we fight side by side.<br>
If you don't wanna get KO'd, you've either gotta evade or KO the enemy first. Either way, don't just stand there! Go, go, go!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Hatsuharu：</span><br>
*pant*... *pant*... *pant*...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Murasaki：</span><br>
G-god... That was insane...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">New Jersey：</span><br>
Oopsie... I might've gone too far in a few places.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Murasaki：</span><br>
WAY too far...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Leipzig：</span><br>
I can't move a muscle... Fishy, help me...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Torricelli：</span><br>
Heheh... Heheheh... Heheheheh...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">{namecode:188}：</span><br>
Murasaki! Are you okay?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Asuka：</span><br>
We're here to rescu– Whoa. Check out the numbers on their report sheet!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Akatsuki：</span><br>
I can't believe my eyes! Look how many foes they defeated!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Homura：</span><br>
Here I thought they'd need a hand. Looks like we came for nothing.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">New Jersey：</span><br>
Oh, if you girls haven't had enough, I'll call in some more ships.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Murasaki：</span><br>
*whimper*...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Kashino：</span><br>
All this fighting has left them exhausted. I think this is a good time to call it for today.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Hatsuharu：</span><br>
Are you sure? But you just got here to help us out.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Homura：</span><br>
You saying you wanna fight some more? 'Cause I'm up for it.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Torricelli：</span><br>
Nuh-uh, no way... I'm done...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Asuka：</span><br>
Alright, then that's enough training for today! Let's all go swimming now!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Akatsuki：</span><br>
Did you not swim, like, several kilometers just a minute ago?!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Asuka：</span><br>
Yeah, but that's different! It's not the same as swimming with these girls!<br>
No time to waste! I'll see you there!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Hibiki：</span><br>
I'm down for a swim!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Akatsuki：</span><br>
I-I will join you, then!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">New Jersey：</span><br>
Well... That worked out surprisingly well in the end.<br>
In the heat of battle, all you think about is what your teammates will do, when to dodge, and what enemy to sink...<br>
There's no time to waste thinking about your own little troubles. Isn't that nice?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Murasaki：</span><br>
Yes, but the thing is, my friends have told me that before...<br>
I went into the battle already knowing about that...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">New Jersey：</span><br>
Wait, you did? So in the end, you didn't need me to do anything for you?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Murasaki：</span><br>
No. You can be a bit of a hothead sometimes... Does anyone tell you that?<br>
Still, even if this wasn't necessary, it showed that you care for us... Thank you for that.<br>
……………………<br>
I need to work on becoming more confident...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Asuka：</span><br>
White sands and blue waves – I'm coming for you!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Murasaki：</span><br>
...But to reach her level of confidence is going to take years.<br>
