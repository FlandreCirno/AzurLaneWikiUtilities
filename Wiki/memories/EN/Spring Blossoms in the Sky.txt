1 Warmth Arrives on the Spring Breeze<br>
Port shopping district - Right before Lunar New Year<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Hwah Jah：</span><br>
Oh. Hi, Commander. Happy Lunar New Year!<br>
<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项1："Hi there."</span>'''''<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项2："Happy Lunar New Year."</span>'''''<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Hwah Jah：</span><br>
Fancy meeting you here. I was just about to visit your office.<br>
What brings you here? Are you patrolling the port, perchance?<br>
Always working tirelessly, even with holidays around the corner... You poor thing.<br>
<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项1："I'm just on a leisurely stroll, actually."</span>'''''<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项2："I don't have TOO much work at the moment."</span>'''''<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Hwah Jah：</span><br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项1）</span>'''''Ah. That's good to hear.<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项1）</span>'''''Say, I could use your help with something. Do you have a moment?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Hwah Jah：</span><br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项2）</span>'''''Ah. So you have time for other things, I presume?<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项2）</span>'''''See, I was hoping you could help me with something. Would you mind?<br>
<br>
"It depends. Tell me more."<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Hwah Jah：</span><br>
Sure. I'm planning to expand the firework workshop for the festival.<br>
The Spring Festival is a time for everyone to get together and have a blast.<br>
And what better way to do that than with some stunning fireworks, right?<br>
Unfortunately, in its current state, the workshop can't produce fireworks that are quite up to snuff.<br>
But, that can be fixed with an expansion. We could make new and exciting kinds of fireworks! What do you say, Commander?<br>
<br>
I had a similar idea earlier while I was strolling through the port and noticed how quiet it is.<br>
And you can't have Lunar New Year without ear-splitting firecrackers and dazzling fireworks.<br>
"I'm in favor of it. Also, I'm a bit surprised you of all brought up the idea. I didn't think a quiet girl like you would like fireworks."<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Hwah Jah：</span><br>
Heehee. One shouldn't judge a book by its cover. I actually love big, exciting events.<br>
Seeing as you're on board, shall we get right to it?<br>

<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Hwah Jah：</span><br>
Whew... That's almost all the materials we'll need.<br>
I tried my hand at making a firework earlier, and it was easier than I expected. Let's launch it and see how it performs.<br>
<br>
Hwah Jah lights the fuze, and the firework takes off to the sky, bursting into thousands of little glimmers that fade into the night.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Hwah Jah：</span><br>
Whoa... That was beautiful. It came out perfectly!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">???：</span><br>
Commandeeer! Hwah Jaaah!<br>
<br>
I look over my shoulder and respond...<br>
<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项1："Hi there."</span>'''''<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项2："Happy Lunar New Year."</span>'''''<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ting An：</span><br>
Mhm. Happy Lunar New Year to you both.<br>
I saw that firework from way over there! It was gorgeous. Did you two make it?<br>
<br>
I give Ting An a quick rundown of what's going on.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ting An：</span><br>
I think it's great that you're expanding the fireworks workshop. In fact, I'd love to help!<br>
The more, the merrier, right? Or at least, it'll get done quicker that way. I'll ask around if anyone else can give a hand!<br>
Oh, I almost forgot – here, I brought you some snacks. Have a break and recharge your batteries♪<br>
Now, just wait here. I'll be right back with some volunteers!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Hwah Jah：</span><br>
Wait, before you–<br>
Go... *sigh*... She made off like the wind.<br>
<br>
We open the small ornamental box Ting An gave us and find an assortment of premium rice cakes, crisp candies, and buns filled with red bean paste and custard.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Hwah Jah：</span><br>
Ooh. They look and smell absolutely delicious.<br>
I say we do as she suggested and help ourselves while we wait for her to come back.<br>

Some time later, with the expansion well underway...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Bismarck：</span><br>
Commander, the main structure is complete. We await your inspection and approval.<br>
<br>
Thanks to people from all factions lending a hand, work on the expansion has finished way ahead of everyone's expectations.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Kirov：</span><br>
See, Comrade Commander? This is what strength through unity can accomplish!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Leonardo da Vinci：</span><br>
I took the liberty of redesigning the building. If you ever want to expand it again in the future, it should be easy peasy~<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Dunkerque：</span><br>
Excellent work, everyone. Why don't we take a break with some desserts?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Hiei：</span><br>
Lovely idea. I have freshly made kuzu-manjuus, if anyone wants.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ping Hai：</span><br>
I do!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Le Téméraire：</span><br>
Me! Me! Me!<br>
Hey, girls, watch this! I can do magic just like Opie! I cast Crackly Fire!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">L'Opiniâtre：</span><br>
Don't be silly, Tem – that's just running around with a lit firework!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Fu Shun：</span><br>
I get it! Clearly it has to be bigger and flashier to be truly magical!<br>
I've got just the thing... My mega firework bazooka! Let's give this bad boy a shot.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Le Téméraire：</span><br>
Holy smokes! I wanna try it myself!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">An Shan：</span><br>
Fuuuu Shuuuun!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Fu Shun：</span><br>
Yikes! Heeeelp! An Shan's going to eat meeee!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Chang Chun：</span><br>
Hey, don't run away! I wanna see the bazooka in action!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Tai Yuan：</span><br>
Gosh, she's quick on her feet... Um, Commander, An Shan and I will go make sure Fu Shun doesn't get up to no good.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Saratoga：</span><br>
Look at this! I've made a firework based on my idol image!<br>
If this won't leave you all dazzled, nothing will♪<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Hai Chi：</span><br>
Wow! We've built up a real mountain of fireworks here. Great job, everyone.<br>
I can hardly wait to see them go off!<br>
<br>
Firework after firework rockets off into the sky, illuminating it in a stunning display. Many – me included – can't help but gasp in wonder.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Illustrious：</span><br>
My word... It's beautiful.<br>
May all these thoughts and feelings given luminous form be seen for miles and miles around.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Hai Tien：</span><br>
"As sun, moon, and stars in the firmaments above; as fireworks and falling snow on the ocean below." The only thing we're missing to complete this magnificent winter night's scenery is some light snow.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Yat Sen：</span><br>
Hwah Jah, I will be the first to say you have our gratitude for proposing the workshop expansion.<br>
It's seldom we all get the opportunity to get together as one big family, and your suggestion helped make this an unforgettable gathering.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Hwah Jah：</span><br>
You flatter me. All I wanted was to make our Lunar New Year as lively as it should be.<br>
Oh, right... Commander, if you could make a wish for the new year, what would it be?<br>
<br>
"Good question. I'd say..."<br>
"I wish for nothing more than another year full of laughter and joy with all of you."<br>
