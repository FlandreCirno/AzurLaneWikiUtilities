I'm Not A Baby!<br>
<br>
Chapter 1 - Getting Work Done!<br>
Port - Commander's Office<br>
To supervise a whole fleet, a method of communication to transmit and receive messages and materials throughout the port's many departments is of utmost importance.<br>
Just as there are times where one phone call is sufficient, there are times where just a single slip of paper has to be delivered by a messenger.<br>
It's times like the latter when she – my secretary – is a huge help.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Cavalla：</span><br>
Commander!<br>
I've delivered the documents to the provisions manager!<br>
Also, I've got something for you!<br>
This! Your regularly scheduled inventory report! I asked for one just like you told me to!<br>
<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项1：Take the inventory report</span>'''''<br>
Anything else you want me to do?<br>
<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项1：Give Cavalla some time to rest</span>'''''<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Cavalla：</span><br>
Okey-dokey, I will!<br>
Whoopee♪<br>
I got three tasks done for the commander today! I went to the research lab, school, and the depot...<br>
Way to go, me!<br>
Cavalla looked pleased with herself.<br>
<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项1：Tell her she did well</span>'''''<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项2：Pat her on the head</span>'''''<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Cavalla：</span><br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项1）</span>'''''Heheh~ You couldn't manage without me, could you~<br>
<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项1）</span>'''''I wouldn't say I couldn't make do without her, but I'm still grateful because she's such a big help.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Cavalla：</span><br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项2）</span>'''''Bah... Don't treat me like a baby, Commander!<br>
<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项2）</span>'''''She doesn't seem to like it when I pat her on the head.<br>
<br>
Let's call it here for today and ask for her help again later tomorrow.<br>

<br>
Chapter 2 - Justice Is Served!<br>
A few hours ago...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Akashi：</span><br>
Commander, something bad's happened, nya! There's been a catastrophe in the depot, and we need help, nya!<br>
What's that, nya?! You're too busy and can't spare the time, nya?! C-can't you help in some way, nya...?<br>
... Your secretary can give us a hand, nya? That'd be great, nya!<br>
<br>
It's now been several hours since Akashi took my secretary and left.<br>
With no one around to help, I've been out and about the port, doing things on my own.<br>
Come to think of it, that thing Akashi said about the depot–<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Cavalla：</span><br>
I'm back!<br>
<br>
... Cavalla came back sooner than I expected.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Cavalla：</span><br>
I did just as you instructed, and I even managed to get some friends to help out in the depot!<br>
Justice has been served!<br>
... Huh? Nobody told you what happened? Okay, let me explain...<br>
<br>
Cavalla gave me a detailed account of the events that had unfolded.<br>
In short, Akashi had made a mistake which put the inventory in disorder, and they helped reorganize it.<br>
The "friends" she mentioned refers to the Little Beavers. She'd crossed paths with them by happenstance on her way to the depot.<br>
Apparently, they weren't very sure about what had caused the inventory mixup. I will have to investigate later...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Cavalla：</span><br>
"Justice will always prevail!" That's what the captain of the Little Beavers said!<br>
What a cool catchphrase!<br>
I wanna be a partner of justice too!<br>
<br>
Cavalla's eyes were gleaming with enthusiasm.<br>

<br>
Chapter 3 - Prepare To Strike!<br>
Port - Exercise Area<br>
An exercise focusing on Gato-class submarines was being held.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Albacore：</span><br>
Darn, can't find any good targets...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Dace：</span><br>
Yeah! I'm gonna be super disappointed if we have to head back without firing even a single torp!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Cavalla：</span><br>
You said it! We'll be the laughing stock of the other subs if we return empty-handed!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Albacore：</span><br>
Sadly, U-81's team has already sunk the primary target, and I dunno how but I-26's team also got points for sinking something. We're in a real herringed pickle...<br>
... Huh?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Laffey：</span><br>
*Yawn*...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Albacore：</span><br>
Heheh...<br>
Guys, you see how tired Laffey is looking over there...? It's the perfect opportunity for an ambush!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Dace：</span><br>
Huh?! Are you serious?! Laffey's a destroyer!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Albacore：</span><br>
I know, which is why I've thought up a plan~<br>
Cavalla, you act as bait to lure her attention, then Dace and I will wait for an opening to strike.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Cavalla：</span><br>
Sounds like a plan! Let's do it!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Albacore：</span><br>
All right! Over here, Dace!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Laffey：</span><br>
So tired... I definitely don't wanna go sleep in my room... Nope, not at all...<br>
... What the...?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Albacore：</span><br>
(That's it, Cavalla! You have her on the hook!)<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Cavalla：</span><br>
WRAAAGH!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Albacore：</span><br>
... Huh?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Cavalla：</span><br>
Have a taste of my cannons!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Laffey：</span><br>
You're trying to fight on the surface, even though you're a submarine...? Don't underestimate me...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Cavalla：</span><br>
What the?! She evaded my attacks?!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Albacore：</span><br>
(What the heck is Cavalla doing?!)<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Laffey：</span><br>
Deactivating self-imposed limiter...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Cavalla：</span><br>
Destroyers don't scare m– Oh, God! That nearly hit me!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Albacore：</span><br>
Dace! Do it!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Dace：</span><br>
Take this! Total torpedo turmoil attaaaack!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Laffey：</span><br>
An attack from beneath...!<br>
<br>
Laffey was (in this exercise scenario) sunk.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Laffey：</span><br>
You got me...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Cavalla：</span><br>
Hooray! Mission successful!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Albacore：</span><br>
... Okay, I DID tell you to act as bait, but you didn't need to do crazy things like that!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Dace：</span><br>
Still, I'm sure Cavalla's actions gave the commander quite a surprise...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Cavalla：</span><br>
Eheheheh!<br>

<br>
Chapter 4 - Mistakes Were Made!<br>
Port - Nearby Waters<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Dace：</span><br>
Pwah! Heck yeah, first place!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Albacore：</span><br>
Dangit... Welp, I'm clearly not performing at my best today~<br>
... Oh, hey, Commander!<br>
... What we're doing? Just a friendly competition between us subs. Loser has to buy Oxy-cola for everyone else.<br>
And it's looking like Cavalla's the loser this time.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Dace：</span><br>
You think she lost cause she's been skipping out on training in favor of her secretary work?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Albacore：</span><br>
That'd make the Commander feel bad about it and make her resign. Now then, Cavalla, you owe us some...~<br>
... drinks? Hey, where's Cavalla?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Dace：</span><br>
Wasn't she right behind you?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Albacore：</span><br>
No? Maybe she just kept going past the buoys that indicate the extent of the exercise area?<br>
(Whispering) Oops. I probably shouldn't have moved those around to confuse people...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Dace：</span><br>
If she did then she'll end up where the Sakura Empire is conducting an exercise...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Albacore：</span><br>
That'd be big trouble! C'mon, Commander, we gotta find her!<br>
<br>
Exercise Area<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Zuikaku：</span><br>
Bah! You win!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Shoukaku：</span><br>
Victory is mine♪<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Zuikaku：</span><br>
It's not fair to pull a sneak attack like that, sis!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Shoukaku：</span><br>
*Giggle*, it's your fault for not realizing one was coming. You won't be able to defeat me if you don't concentrate~<br>
Furthermore, you should expect to see sneak attacks utilized in a real battle, since–<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Cavalla：</span><br>
Pwah!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Shoukaku：</span><br>
Huh?!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Cavalla：</span><br>
I made it here first! Heheh, Albacore, Dace, you know what that means! It's time to buy me some Ox... y... cola...?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Zuikaku：</span><br>
I know you...!<br>
Sis, this time, I will protect you! Stay back, pesky sub!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Cavalla：</span><br>
W-wait, where am I?<br>
I-I'm so confused!<br>
<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项1：Call out to Cavalla</span>'''''<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Shoukaku：</span><br>
I see... So Cavalla went beyond the boundary buoys and ended up here.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Cavalla：</span><br>
I made such a stupid mistake...<br>
I'm so sorry!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Shoukaku：</span><br>
*Giggle*, it's fine. My little sister shouldn't have reacted the way she did, either.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Zuikaku：</span><br>
Y-yeah, I shouldn't have... Sorry, Cavalla!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Shoukaku：</span><br>
As punishment, you will give the Commander and these submarines half of your tempura ration today♪<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Albacore & Dace：</span><br>
Yippee!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Zuikaku：</span><br>
And when did you all show up?!<br>
<br>
Later that day, we all savored Shoukaku's delicious handmade tempura.<br>

<br>
Chapter 5 - Tell Me A Story!<br>
Port - Commander's Office<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Cavalla：</span><br>
All done!<br>
Well, Commander? Aren't I amazing~?<br>
<br>
With Cavalla's help, I managed to finish all the work for today.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Cavalla：</span><br>
Dace and friends didn't show up earlier, and all the other subs seem busy...<br>
*Sigh*... I bet I'll end up spending the afternoon just sitting on my butt...<br>
Oh, I've got an idea! Let's have a storytelling contest, Commander!<br>
<br>
I'm presuming the idea is that we'll each take turns telling a story and then decide whose is the best.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Cavalla：</span><br>
You go first, Commander!<br>
Right, what kind of story should I tell her?<br>
<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项1：A story about a hero who sacrifices himself to save the world</span>'''''<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项2：A story about a king who abdicates to be with his sweetheart</span>'''''<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项3：A story about a detective who uses his wits to track down a criminal</span>'''''<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Cavalla：</span><br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项1）</span>'''''……<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项1）</span>'''''Why did the hero have to die?<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项1）</span>'''''There's gotta be a way to save the world without sacrificing yourself! Boo!<br>
<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项1）</span>'''''Cavalla seemed really upset with my story.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Cavalla：</span><br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项2）</span>'''''……<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项2）</span>'''''Why did he need to... "abbey-cate"... to be with his sweetheart?<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项2）</span>'''''I don't get it!<br>
<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项2）</span>'''''... It seems Cavalla is too young to enjoy the story.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Cavalla：</span><br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项3）</span>'''''Zzzzzzzzz……<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项3）</span>'''''H-huh? Is the story over?<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项3）</span>'''''I must've fallen asleep... Sorry!<br>
<br>
It seems Cavalla thought my story was rather dull.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Cavalla：</span><br>
Okay, now it's my turn!<br>
Heheh! I'm sure my story will be much more exciting!<br>
<br>
She told me a story centered around her own service record.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Cavalla：</span><br>
Well? Aren't I the best? No one else would ever understand the richness of Cavalla's personal story!<br>
<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项1：Pat her on the head</span>'''''<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Cavalla：</span><br>
Hey! You're treating me like a baby again!<br>
That does it! Next time I'm gonna make it clear to you that I'm not a baby anymore!<br>
<br>
I sensed an unusual flash of determination in her words.<br>

<br>
Chapter 6 - I'm A Grownup!<br>
Port - Commander's Office<br>
So far it's been a normal day without any–<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Cavalla：</span><br>
Commander, go on a date with me!<br>
<br>
……？<br>
(W-what did she just say?)<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Cavalla：</span><br>
Commander, didn't you hear me? Date! With me!<br>
<br>
(Calm down, me. Prime numbers, prime numbers...)<br>
<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项1：Ask her why she wants a "date"</span>'''''<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Cavalla：</span><br>
Shoukaku told me about it!<br>
She said, "the Commander won't think you're a baby anymore if you go on a date"!<br>
Although I'm not really sure what a "date" is...<br>
Point is: you think I'm just a baby, that's why you always act so cautious around me!<br>
And it makes me mad!<br>
So, go on a date with me! Then, I'll show you a part of me you've never seen before!<br>
... Please?<br>
<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项1：Agree</span>'''''<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项2：Refuse</span>'''''<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Cavalla：</span><br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项2）</span>'''''I'm not leaving until you say "yes"!<br>
<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项3：Agree</span>'''''<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Cavalla：</span><br>
Great!<br>
Um, Shoukaku didn't teach me what you do on a date... So let's just go out and have fun.<br>
<br>
(Yup. I knew this is how things would turn out one day...)<br>

<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Cavalla：</span><br>
I've been waiting, Commander!<br>
Let's get going right now!<br>
... Actually, where do we even go?<br>
<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项1：Pick out a destination for her</span>'''''<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Cavalla：</span><br>
Okey-dokey! I'm counting on you to pick out a good place, then!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Akashi：</span><br>
Thank you for your patronyage~<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Cavalla：</span><br>
Wow! Thanks, Commander!<br>
Commander, look! A seagull!<br>
Squawk! Squawk! Come here, seagull!<br>
Where'd I put my camera... Ah, there it is!<br>
Okay, Commander! Say cheese!<br>
Phew...<br>
Hey! You're still totally treating me like a baby!<br>
... Was Shoukaku lying to me all along...?<br>
<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项1："You enjoyed yourself, though, didn't you?"</span>'''''<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Cavalla：</span><br>
I did! I had a whale of a time! But...<br>
No matter what I do, you'll probably still treat me like a baby...<br>
………………<br>
Ah, screw it! I'm just not gonna think about it anymore!<br>
Even if you think I'm just a baby, you still need me in the end!<br>
Commander, today was a lot of fun, so let's go on another one of these "dates" soon! Ehehe~<br>
<br>
Cavalla's smile was just as dazzling as ever.<br>
