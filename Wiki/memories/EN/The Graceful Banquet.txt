The Graceful Banquet<br>
<br>
1 The Teahouse<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Hai Tien：</span><br>
"The moon shines on streams among swaying pines – rising mist flanks the dew-rich apricot trees."<br>
Mmh... This tea is so fragrant.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Howe ：</span><br>
Is this the place? It matches the description...<br>
Oh, seems someone left the door open.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Hai Chi：</span><br>
Welcome to the Dragon Empery Teahouse! Are you visiting alone?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Howe ：</span><br>
Yep, it's just me.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Hai Chi：</span><br>
Right this way then, please!<br>
<br>
Howe entered the old-fashioned teahouse and Hai Chi showed her to a seat.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Hai Tien：</span><br>
Welcome, Howe.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Howe ：</span><br>
Thanks. I hope you don't mind having me here.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Hai Tien：</span><br>
Not at all, we're honored to. Hai Chi, would you get her some tea?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Hai Chi：</span><br>
Sure! Here you go.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Howe ：</span><br>
Thanks. I've brought homemade cookies. Would you like some?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Hai Tien：</span><br>
My, Howe, you're too generous for a guest.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Howe ：</span><br>
Don't be shy. We're all friends here.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Hai Chi：</span><br>
Look, sis! This cookie's shape spells out "good fortune!"<br>
And this one looks like a garden lantern! These are so cool, Howe!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Howe ：</span><br>
Yes, I went for some Dragon Empery design elements, since I'm visiting you all today. I hope you like them.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Fu Shun：</span><br>
Hey, did someone say cookies? Save some for us!<br>
<br>
Fu Shun entered the teahouse with Grozny in tow, the scent of cookies seemingly having attracted them.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Fu Shun：</span><br>
Wow! These are almost too pretty to eat... I mean, right, Grozny?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Grozny：</span><br>
Yeah. But I still wanna eat.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Howe ：</span><br>
Then by all means, eat. I've made lots in preparation for this evening's banquet.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Fu Shun：</span><br>
Hehehe. So, the reason I brought Grozny along is she said she wants to try Dragon Empery tea. I'm not stepping on anyone's toes here, am I?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Hai Tien：</span><br>
Not at all. In fact, that's very kind of you. Hai Chi, please get some tea for Grozny as well.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Grozny：</span><br>
Is this a teapot? Then I can pour for myself.<br>
<br>
Grozny poured the contents of the teapot into her trusty canteen, then chugged the hot tea all in one go.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Hai Tien：</span><br>
Goodness gracious...! Didn't that burn?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Grozny：</span><br>
...*burp*. Nope, I'm good.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Fu Shun：</span><br>
You can't do that, Grozny! You're supposed to take your time with tea, you know? Also, you should be drinking from a teacup instead!<br>
<br>
Fu Shun snatched the canteen from Grozny and put a teacup on the table in its place.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Grozny：</span><br>
That's tiny. What's the point if I can't chug?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Fu Shun：</span><br>
It's the prime experience! Watch, I'll show you how to drink it like An Shan taught me.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Hai Tien：</span><br>
Heehee, how lovely. Hosting a tea party was the right decision indeed.<br>

The Graceful Banquet<br>
<br>
2 The Garden<br>
Meanwhile, at a set designed after a Dragon Empery garden...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Chen Hai：</span><br>
Look this way, Chitose. Yes, hold that pose... *click*<br>
Hmm... It came out nicely, but I don't quite feel like it's "the one."<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Chitose：</span><br>
Snapping the perfect photo is tricky... Ow, my hair!<br>
<br>
Just as Chitose stood up, her hair got caught on a tree branch.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Chen Hai：</span><br>
Oh dear. Let me help you with that. Hold still, please.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Chitose：</span><br>
Ugh... Sorry, and please do...<br>
<br>
The calm and collected Chen Hai carefully disentangled Chitose's hair without incident.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Chen Hai：</span><br>
That should do it. You've got such gorgeous hair, and I'm truly relieved it wasn't damaged just now.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Chitose：</span><br>
Thanks... Chiyoda deserves the credit for my hair, though. She's the one who puts in all the work.<br>
This photoshoot was her idea, actually.<br>
She said it'd be a shame not to take a photo after all the effort of dressing me up and styling my hair.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Chen Hai：</span><br>
I find it wonderful how close you two are. Next time, why not invite her to take pictures together with us?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Chitose：</span><br>
That would be nice...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Chen Hai：</span><br>
Oh, I just had a flash of inspiration. Could you stay for just one more photograph?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Chitose：</span><br>
Sure, I guess. What do you want me to do?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Chen Hai：</span><br>
Could you gently hang your hair on the branch back there?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Chitose：</span><br>
Huh? But it got caught on it just a second ago.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Chen Hai：</span><br>
I know, hence my use of the word "gently." Would you mind doing that for me?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Chitose：</span><br>
Uh, sure... I-is this good enough?<br>
<br>
*click*<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Chen Hai：</span><br>
Heehee, now this is a wonderful picture. I think I'll call it, "Beauty Among the Branches."<br>
<br>
After she and Chitose parted ways, Chen Hai heard some sort of loud noise, which she decided to go investigate.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ying Swei：</span><br>
Nice and easy. Try not to push down too hard.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Boise：</span><br>
Okay... Nice and easy... Oh. Aww...<br>
I broke it... Ugh, I just can't do it right...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ying Swei：</span><br>
Please don't fret, Miss Boise. You just need a little practice.<br>
It's true you punctured the paper, but your calligraphy itself is excellent. Try again, but relax your hand a bit and I'm sure it'll go better.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Boise：</span><br>
Well, all right! I'll give it another shot...<br>
<br>
Boise laid out a new sheet of paper, then picked up the writing brush with a determined look.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ying Swei：</span><br>
Please take your time. I know you have it in you, Miss Boise.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Boise：</span><br>
Huff... Puff... Deep breaths... Huff... Puff... Okay!<br>
...I did it!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ying Swei：</span><br>
And you did it very well. See? I knew you could pull it off.<br>
<br>
*click*<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Chen Hai：</span><br>
Heehee. This one I will call, "Bitterness Passes, Sweetness Lingers."<br>

The Graceful Banquet<br>
<br>
3 The Music Room<br>
Over in the music room, Roon was pouring her soul into a piano performance.<br>
Tirpitz and Yat Sen were listening, taking in her beautiful notes like the whispers of a stream.<br>
She concluded her melody and turned to ask them a question.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Roon：</span><br>
How was it this time around?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Yat Sen：</span><br>
My. You have improved so much I can hardly believe what I just heard.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Tirpitz：</span><br>
Agreed. You'll unquestioningly steal the show at the banquet with this performance.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Roon：</span><br>
I'm glad to hear it~ It means I'm one step closer to my goal of giving the Commander a private recital.<br>
Having said that, I feel my musical repertoire is lacking.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Yat Sen：</span><br>
Practice makes perfect. Don't be too hasty, instead focus on mastering the piano little by little.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Roon：</span><br>
Of course. For now, I must focus on nailing my performance at the banquet tonight.<br>
I'm dedicating it to the Commander, so I cannot afford to make any mistakes.<br>
Now let's do it one more time, from the top. Yat Sen, would you mind listening again?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Yat Sen：</span><br>
Gladly. I'd love to offer my input after hearing how much better you've become.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Tirpitz：</span><br>
Roon, upon further consideration, I'm willing to do a duet with you.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Roon：</span><br>
Heehee. You've finally made up your mind?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Tirpitz：</span><br>
I cannot deny I feel the urge to perform in front of the Commander.<br>
Besides, I can't just sit back after hearing that melody of yours.<br>
It's time I took the plunge.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Roon：</span><br>
In that case, you're free to join in.<br>
But, allow me to say this upfront – I will not hold my performance back just to make yours look better.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Tirpitz：</span><br>
Neither will I. You're not the only one who's been practicing.<br>
Yat Sen, I take it you'll be listening to us quite a lot before the actual show.<br>
So would you mind giving me your input as well?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Yat Sen：</span><br>
Of course, I'd be happy to. I'm certain your duet will take the banquet to the next level.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Roon：</span><br>
Now then, let's get to it, shall we?<br>
<br>
A melody filled the room. The notes of Roon's piano and Tirpitz's flute came together harmoniously.<br>

<br>
4 The Banquet<br>
Port - Banquet Hall<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Washington：</span><br>
The time's finally come, huh...<br>
(I've been training my ass off. I SHOULD be able to crack a natural smile now...)<br>
(Take it easy, Washington. Just enjoy the banquet like everyone else and you'll be fine!)<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Le Mars：</span><br>
N-nice to meet you!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Washington：</span><br>
(Man, she's tense, just like me! Pretty sure she's... Le Mars, from the Vichya Dominion?)<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Le Mars：</span><br>
Ahem, um... G-good evening, Miss Washington!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Washington：</span><br>
You're worked up like crazy, aren'tcha?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Le Mars：</span><br>
Pardon?! H-how could you tell?!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Washington：</span><br>
I mean, it's written all over your face.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Le Mars：</span><br>
So it's that obvious... Apologies for my embarrassing display.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Washington：</span><br>
(Geesh... Somehow seeing someone more stressed than me is helping me ease up considerably...)<br>
This your first time at a banquet?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Le Mars：</span><br>
It is! I've been on guard duty by the entrance numerous times, but never been here as a guest before...<br>
Not only that, I have to wear a dress and pay attention to so many little things... It's so much all at once... Ugh...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Washington：</span><br>
You don't gotta worry so much. We all know each other here – no point stressing over being prim and proper.<br>
In fact, you'll probably struggle to hold a conversation if you act so stiff.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Le Mars：</span><br>
Actually, now that you mention it, that's true!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Washington：</span><br>
Right? Try smiling like me, and I'm sure you'll feel more comfortable too.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Le Mars：</span><br>
...You're right! It's helping quite a lot!<br>
Thank you so much, Miss Washington! I feel I'm getting used to this already!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Washington：</span><br>
Good to hear it. Go on and enjoy yourself now. I'm gonna hit the dinner table and help myself to some grub.<br>
(She didn't comment on my smile at all... Do I take that to mean she thought it was natural?)<br>
(Hell yeah! Actually, hang on... How'd the muscles in my face move to pull that off...)<br>
(Consarnit! Need to remember now, before I forget!)<br>
<br>
Washington solved someone's problem only to quickly end up with one of her own.<br>
Some time later, after the banquet had begun...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Howe ：</span><br>
I've brought freshly baked cookies. If anyone wants one, don't be shy.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Grozny：</span><br>
Lemme have that one shaped like a garden lantern... Nom.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Chitose：</span><br>
I think I'll have... this one that looks like a folding fan.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Boise：</span><br>
Thanks, Howe... I'll take the one that looks like a Dragon Empery character...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Tirpitz：</span><br>
Whew... I suppose it's time to perform in front of a big audience.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Roon：</span><br>
Are you still nervous?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Tirpitz：</span><br>
No, I'm fine. What I'm feeling could be better described as exhilaration.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Roon：</span><br>
Heehee. That's just what I like to hear.<br>
Pour that feeling into your performance, and let's give them a passionate duet.<br>
<br>
*click*<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Chen Hai：</span><br>
"A gathering of lovely guest seats – a banquet more pleasant than words can describe. A reverberating duet of wind and string instruments – a melody so wondrous in the air."<br>
This one I shall title, "The Graceful Banquet."<br>
I think that's enough photographs for today. The banquet is underway, and now it's time to focus on having a good time.<br>
Speaking of which... Commander, would you like to join me for a dance?<br>
