<br>
Some time ago, before the incident with Bismarck's Black Cube...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Bismarck：</span><br>
Thank you for coming, and forgive me for dragging you into such a time-consuming operation.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Blücher：</span><br>
It's all good! We're happy to be contributing to Iron Blood science!<br>
Just making sure – we're basically doing an experiment to test the Mirror Sea's functions, yeah? I've always wanted some Pawns of my own to play with!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Z16：</span><br>
You've got nothing to worry about with the one-and-only ME here! I'll do anything for the Iron Blood!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Bismarck：</span><br>
Your readiness is admirable. I'm glad I chose you two.<br>
Before we start, do either of you have any further questions? I'll try to give you everything you need to know.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Blücher：</span><br>
We'll be fine for this operation, but... are you sure you don't need us here with a major battle just around the corner?<br>
Everyone has been on edge recently, and I'm worried you might be in danger if we split up our forces too much...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Bismarck：</span><br>
You needn't worry about that. Neither I nor Iron Blood has anything to fear.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Blücher：</span><br>
Alright, if you're sure. I'll focus only on my own mission, then!<br>
Oh, also, where's Eugen? I can't believe my own little sister isn't coming to wish me good luck!<br>
Heheh☆ Well, maybe she stayed up late worrying about me and ended up oversleeping or something~<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Bismarck：</span><br>
No. She and Hipper are taking part in a different operation.<br>
Let's just say some urgent business cropped up. I'll inform them of this operation later.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Blücher：</span><br>
That's probably not needed, right? This Mirror Sea's top secret AND fully explored, and I'm sure she has her own things to worry about.<br>
In any case, I don't have anything else to ask, so let's get this show on the road!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Bismarck：</span><br>
If your preparations are done then you're free to set sail... But I do have one last question before you go.<br>
Who'll be playing the enemy this time?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Blücher：</span><br>
I mean, who else but this little dork?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Z16：</span><br>
Exactly! It's me against the big dork here!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Bismarck：</span><br>
...I suggest you take another look at page 15 of the mission briefs.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Blücher：</span><br>
Page 15? Okay, let's see... Oh.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Blücher & Z16：</span><br>
- Hold up, we're on the same side?! - I'm supposed to work together with HER?!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Bismarck：</span><br>
Please don't tell me you haven't even opened the briefs until now.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Blücher：</span><br>
I have! I remember every little detail about the operation, where it's taking place, and what the surveys said!<br>
Although I kinda stopped reading before page 15. Heheh☆<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Z16：</span><br>
Same here! This means all my efforts devisin' a winning strategy against Blücher was for nothing...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Blücher：</span><br>
That makes two of us! I racked my brain sooo hard figuring out my great plan to take you down, and it's worthless now!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Bismarck：</span><br>
No matter. There is still time to explain the rest to–<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Blücher：</span><br>
Excuse me, question!<br>
So if she and I are on the same team, who ARE we fighting against?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Z16：</span><br>
My thoughts exactly! Our names are the only ones in here!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Bismarck：</span><br>
That's just what I was about to tell you.<br>
Your opponent's identity is sadly classified information at the present. Just think of her as a fellow shipgirl.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Blücher：</span><br>
Teasing us, eh... Alright, so when will we get to meet her?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Bismarck：</span><br>
After the experiment begins.<br>
Rest assured, you won't be fighting the whole time. You may also communicate freely with her while the area's facilities are inactive.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Z16：</span><br>
Now you've got me excited to see who it is!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Bismarck：</span><br>
I'm happy to hear it. You may be quite surprised when you find out.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Z16：</span><br>
Interesting... Can't wait to learn more about this new friend of mine.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Blücher：</span><br>
If you're that eager, finish the rest of the briefs so we can get started!<br>
And Bismarck, good luck on your own operation! Say hi for me to any familiar faces you meet! Heheh☆<br>

{{折叠面板|标题=Mirror Sea Facility|选项=2|主框=1|样式=primary|展开=是}}
<br>
Mirror Seas. Pocket dimension created by the Sirens.<br>
These artificial dimensions are almost completely cut off from the outside world. On the inside, they have their own environment, structure, and even physical laws.<br>
Indeed, a Mirror Sea can exist within a place that appears completely empty from the outside. That there would be a huge island inside with a large array of facilities is not beyond the realm of imagination.<br>
Mirror Sea - Iron Blood Encampment<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Blücher：</span><br>
Woah, so this is our Mirror Sea research facility...<br>
It looks like another gloomy Siren construct from the outside, but once you walk inside, it's actually rather comfy!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Z16：</span><br>
No kidding! With how spacious and fancy this place is, it seems more like a luxury resort than a base of operations.<br>
Is this where we're goin' to stay until the end of our experiment?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Blücher：</span><br>
Whew~!<br>
<br>
Blücher plopped herself down on a sofa inside the rest area and opened up the mission briefs.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Blücher：</span><br>
That's right. We're gonna be here for a long, long while, so we might as well make ourselves at home.<br>
Hmm, let's take a look around. This is the rest area... And here's the fleet... Um, is this a crafting room and a workshop?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Z16：</span><br>
This must be where the Sirens make their Pawns! It's my first time seeing something like this! How 'bout you, Blücher?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Blücher：</span><br>
Well yeah. It's not like the Sirens normally let us wander around their facilities.<br>
And if I'm seeing this right... This Mirror Sea can produce upgraded Pawns with enhanced combat capabilities and more autonomy...<br>
I guess they've been modified for the purpose of our experiment, just like our own riggings.<br>
Remember to be careful though. If you charge in recklessly against these kinds of enemies, you might end up injured, experiment or not.<br>
Heheh☆ Pretty spooky stuff, huh?<br>
<br>
While Blücher was running through operational briefs, Z16 was investigating the empty canteen next door.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Z16：</span><br>
Would you look at that, Blücher, the pantries are totally stocked with goodies!<br>
They've got all sorts of food here! It's not just Iron Blood stuff, they've got Iris, Royal, and Sardegnian cuisine as well!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Blücher：</span><br>
I see, I see... Each sea area is divided into smaller sectors. If the flagship of a sector is incapacitated, then that sector will be considered "captured."<br>
Once enough sectors have been captured, then it will be possible to attack the enemy's base of operations...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Z16：</span><br>
Blücher, are you listening?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Blücher：</span><br>
What was that again?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Z16：</span><br>
I just checked out the canteen! We've got lots of good stuff here!<br>
Aren't you hungry after we spent such a long time sailing? Let's chow down before we get to work!<br>
It's not like we can start the operation before startin' these facilities up anyway.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Blücher：</span><br>
Hmm, you do have a point... So, what are you gonna have?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Z16：</span><br>
Schweinhaxe, Sauerkraut, and Kartoffelbrei!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Blücher：</span><br>
Get me some Schweinhaxe as well then. And some wurst and grilled veggies to go with that.<br>
Now let's see... Until one of the operational bases has been captured, we won't be able to leave the Mirror Sea, nor will anything be able to come in from outside...<br>
...What the heck is this?!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Z16：</span><br>
Gah! What are you yelling about all of a sudden?<br>
That was a close one... I almost dropped the food you asked me to bring.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Blücher：</span><br>
Appreciate it. Uhh... The operation will begin at 3 P.M. on the first day...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Z16：</span><br>
Huh?! We're already going to have to fight on the first day?<br>
What time is it anyway...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Blücher：</span><br>
It's already 11:30, and I haven't even inspected the facilities yet!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Z16：</span><br>
Uh-oh...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Blücher：</span><br>
Let's finish eating quickly and inspect the conditions of the facilities and the Pawns!<br>

{{折叠面板|标题=The Pawn Fleet|选项=3|主框=1|样式=primary|展开=是}}
<br>
Mirror Sea - Pawn Fleet<br>
Following the map depicted in the mission briefs, Blücher and Z16 arrived at the production area. What they found there left them speechless.<br>
The place was like a massive factory. At its center stood uncountably many Pawns, silent and motionless.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Z16：</span><br>
This... This is one giant fleet of Pawns!<br>
Is this where they're created? Like machines out of a factory, then sent into battle?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Blücher：</span><br>
There's Z1, Z2, Karlsruhe... even Pawns of Eugen and Hipper!<br>
Boy, there's still more! Gneisenau, Scharnhorst... Bismarck, too?!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Z16：</span><br>
With this many of 'em, even their original selves would lose if they all attacked at once!<br>
Which means we have this mission in the bag! Right, Blücher?<br>
What about you all? Am I right, or am I right? Hahahah!<br>
<br>
Z16 was jumping with anticipation for the upcoming battle. She turned and chatted up a Pawn of Z2.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Z16：</span><br>
I know you agree for sure, Thiele! We'll get to go all-out this time!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Blücher：</span><br>
I hope you're not expecting an answer... Pawns aren't able to communicate with us normally.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Z2?：</span><br>
......<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Blücher：</span><br>
Still as creepy as I remember them... But I know from fighting them that they're able to change their expressions.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Z16：</span><br>
Come on, I wasn't serious! Even I know Pawns are another one of the Sirens' sick jokes.<br>
They're the reason we're here – to test 'em in combat! ...Oh look, someone's left a tape recorder.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Prinz Eugen?：</span><br>
"Operation Convergence experiment summary."<br>
"The fleet of Pawns is to be activated and guided into simulated enemy territory. They are to destroy the flagship of each area."<br>
"After a set amount of areas have been secured, the assault on the enemy base begins. The experiment will conclude upon successful takeover."<br>
"Nobody is permitted to enter or exit the Mirror Sea until one of the experiment parties has achieved victory."<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Z16：</span><br>
Huh? We already know about that. She's just reading off the briefs!<br>
Is this a jab at me or something? Does Eugen think I don't know how to read or something?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Prinz Eugen?：</span><br>
"Operation Convergence experiment summary."<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Blücher：</span><br>
Huh? Is it stuck on repeat?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Z16：</span><br>
Maybe there's more on the tape, like details about our mystery opponent. Let me try something.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Prinz Eugen?：</span><br>
"Operation Convergence experiment summary."<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Z16：</span><br>
No, it's just sayin' the same thing over and over...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Prinz Eugen?：</span><br>
"If you want to know more about your opponent, listen closely... It's a secret, sorry. Heehee♪"<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Z16：</span><br>
What?! Did Eugen really predict I'd try this and left a message just to mess with me?!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Blücher：</span><br>
Let's just move on, alright? Knowing Eugen, she probably has more than one way of getting in your head~<br>
...Actually, now that I think about it, maybe this message isn't even specifically meant for us.<br>
We might even be playing the baddies, but neither side has any way of knowing that yet!<br>
Alright, let's round up these Pawns and mop the floor with whoever our mystery opponent is!<br>

<br>
Mirror Sea - Experiment Area H8<br>
<span style="color:#ec5d53;">Z46？：</span><br>
......<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Z16：</span><br>
Enemy recon fleet spotted!<br>
It's made up of a bunch of mass-produced Sirens, with a Z46 Pawn at the helm!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Blücher：</span><br>
Z46, huh? Last time I saw her she was still getting used to her rigging.<br>
Guess this Pawn version of her is ready for action, though. Now that's interesting~☆<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Z16：</span><br>
Even if her Pawn ends up being pretty strong, we have her fleet completely outgunned.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Blücher：</span><br>
That just means our first match is gonna be a crushing victory! Let's gooo!<br>
{{折叠面板|内容结束}}

{{折叠面板|标题=Graf Zeppelin|选项=5|主框=1|样式=primary|展开=是}}
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Z16：</span><br>
Enemy reinforcements spotted!<br>
It's Graf Zeppelin! A Pawn of her, anyway.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Blücher：</span><br>
One lone carrier without escorts? That's certainly a novel way of doing things...<br>
Even if she isn't commanding the Pawns directly, she should really retake Tactics 101. Heheh☆<br>
Hey, isn't Zeppelin also still training with her rigging? It's why she couldn't make it for Bismarck's operation.<br>
<span style="color:#ec5d53;">Graf Zeppelin?：</span><br>
......<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Blücher：</span><br>
The Z46 Pawn wasn't that tough, and I bet this one won't be much– Whoa, never mind!<br>
Gee-heesh! So that's how Zeppelin's rigging looks in action!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Z16：</span><br>
Impressive! Powerful! But she still can't compare to the one-and-only... ME!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Blücher：</span><br>
Alright, enough tooting those horns, and focus on shooting those planes down!<br>
AA guns, let 'er rip!<br>
{{折叠面板|内容结束}}

{{折叠面板|标题=Brünhilde|选项=6|主框=1|样式=primary|展开=是}}
<br>
KABOOOM!<br>
The Pawn's airstrikes proved futile, and the duo succeeded in eliminating it.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Z16：</span><br>
That Pawn looked like a flagship to me, so that's one sector secured!<br>
Whoa, did you see that? The mass-produced ships are going haywire now that we've taken out their boss!<br>
Now our own mass-produced ships will make quick work of them. Piece of cake!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Blücher：</span><br>
Phew, that Pawn really surprised me. Carriers don't play fair!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Z16：</span><br>
That's just part of the experiment! We would've won in a heartbeat if there weren't all these rules in place.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Blücher：</span><br>
Yeah, but there'd be no point to the experiment if we were allowed to go all-out.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Z16：</span><br>
True...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Blücher：</span><br>
Heheh☆ In any case, all we have to do is wait for our ships to finish their jobs, so we can kick back and relax for now.<br>
...Oh, hang on a sec. I'm picking up another shipgirl's signal. A battlecruiser named Brünhilde? Uhh, who's that again?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Z16：</span><br>
Brünhilde? Don't think I know her... But that's one badass name!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Blücher：</span><br>
Wonder if she is playing the baddie! Heheh☆<br>
Shame we're not allowed to talk to each other until the fighting part is over...<br>
Wait, since she's a shipgirl, that might mean she's bringing reinforcements here!<br>
Then we've gotta get back into gear and drive out all the enemies!<br>
{{折叠面板|内容结束}}

{{折叠面板|标题=Victory Right Out the Gate|选项=7|主框=1|样式=primary|展开=是}}
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Z16：</span><br>
They're retreating, Blücher!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Blücher：</span><br>
Already? That was hardly a fight at all!<br>
We can't let 'em get away! Come on, let's go!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Z16：</span><br>
Don't. Brünhilde's long since left the scene, and we'll enter a new area if we chase after the ships.<br>
That's against the rules, remember? We've already won, so let's just head back.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Blücher：</span><br>
Grr... She played us like a fiddle...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Z16：</span><br>
What are you talkin' about? We're victorious and she's on the run.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Blücher：</span><br>
Sure, we won this time, but we've not learned any useful information about our opponent.<br>
What's worse, it's gonna be an uphill battle if she decides to field a ton of carriers!<br>
Then we'll be outranged and outsmarted by an opponent we know nothing about... Ugh, that's so annoying!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Z16：</span><br>
Damn, you're right... I never knew you had so much stuff to think about.<br>
Plus, when'd you get so good at the tactical stuff? I never took you to be the book-smart type.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Blücher：</span><br>
Hipper used to always nag me about studying. Besides, it doesn't exactly take a genius to figure this stuff out.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Z16：</span><br>
Hmm... Maybe I should ask Z23 for some tutoring at some point as well. I wanna get smart too!<br>
But that's for another time! Now let's head back. I'm dying to fill up with some dinner!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Blücher：</span><br>
Dinner sounds good! I'm right behind you!<br>
{{折叠面板|内容结束}}

{{折叠面板|标题=Reflection Over Dinner|选项=8|主框=1|样式=primary|展开=是}}
<br>
Mirror Sea - Iron Blood Encampment<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Blücher：</span><br>
Tonight we're having – drumroll please – tadah! A full course of Iris cuisine!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Z16：</span><br>
Holy crap, that's a lot of food! And it all looks delish!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Blücher：</span><br>
Mhm! It's not every day we get to pig out like this!<br>
There are drinks too, if you want something. Just go pour it yourself.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Z16：</span><br>
Sweet! Maybe I'll have a soda or something...<br>
Speaking of food, what do Pawns eat? Do they even eat at all?<br>
I was thinking, wouldn't it be surreal if they just all walked in and started queuing up?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Blücher：</span><br>
I can't imagine them needing to eat. I mean, they're basically just Siren-created robots, right? I doubt they'd need food.<br>
The survey notes say that when Pawns returns to the workshop, the first thing they do is upload their combat data to a separate facility.<br>
Then they go to... I forget what it's called, but some place where they compare their data amongst each other to reflect on their performance.<br>
After that, I guess they just head into storage and take a nap.<br>
That's when they recharge, regroup with the other Pawns for the next day, and get ready for the next experiment. Seems simple enough.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Z16：</span><br>
Interesting... I'm surprised you know all this stuff.<br>
Before we got here, I just assumed we were both equally clueless.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Blücher：</span><br>
You'd have known too if you maybe read the briefs. It's all in there.<br>
Think about the situation we're in here. Nobody's allowed in or out of the Mirror Sea until a victor's been determined.<br>
Meaning, we're stuck here until the experiment's over. Isn't that really scary?<br>
Learning everything you can is super important if you want to leave as soon as possible and reunite with our friends.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Z16：</span><br>
Oof. You're absolutely right... I just assumed this would be like any regular exercise...<br>
Maaan, realizin' that we're stuck here is making my appetite go away...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Blücher：</span><br>
Hey, it's not all bad. Our opponent is one of our own and she's not a Pawn, meaning that we can communicate with her in case something goes wrong.<br>
But more importantly, as long as we keep winning, we'll be out of here in no time!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Z16：</span><br>
Yeah, you're right! You know what, I think I'll have a burger as well!<br>

<br>
Mirror Sea - Iron Blood Encampment<br>
Blücher and Z16 finished their meals and went to relax in the break room. Then, in the middle of their lounging...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Brünhilde：</span><br>
Sorry for interrupting your break. Can you hear me?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Blücher：</span><br>
Whoa! Since you're reaching out to us, that can only mean one thing... Brünhilde, was it?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Brünhilde：</span><br>
Yes. I am an Iron Blood shipgirl assigned to this operation, just like you.<br>
Blücher, Z16, I wish the two of you luck on this great, shared undertaking of ours. May the best strategist win.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Z16：</span><br>
W-woah, this girl's got CLASS!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Brünhilde：</span><br>
Class? This is the first time anyone has said that about me. I appreciate your words of praise.<br>
Allow me to also say you fought admirably today.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Blücher：</span><br>
Heheh☆ Hey, you too! Heck, you did better since you kept your identity and true strength concealed!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Brünhilde：</span><br>
I suppose so. You did win only because I conceded victory.<br>
Out of curiosity, are the conditions at your encampment to your satisfaction?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Blücher：</span><br>
Couldn't be better! We had a great dinner and now we're lying down in cozy beds!<br>
Oh yeah, just checking – the next experiment's scheduled in three days, right?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Brünhilde：</span><br>
The Mirror Sea's central terminal determines the schedule. We shouldn't assume it'll stay constant.<br>
It could be in three days, five, or even one. Anything is possible.<br>
Based on personal experience, however, I can say there should be no back-to-back sorties.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Blücher：</span><br>
Really? You've got experience with this Mirror Sea?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Brünhilde：</span><br>
No. This is my first time coming here, just like you.<br>
However, I've trained in other similar Mirror Seas.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Z16：</span><br>
Whoa, does that mean you have all sorts of secret intel? Do you know where our riggings came from?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Brünhilde：</span><br>
I'm afraid I can't say anything about that.<br>
The one thing I say is this – the theory that our riggings are connected to Siren technology is correct.<br>
Just look at this Mirror Sea for proof. The Pawns have already mastered the riggings that their originals are still getting used to.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Z16：</span><br>
Yeah, you're right! They showed they're pretty strong, too!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Brünhilde：</span><br>
The originals are even stronger. This technology makes the Iron Blood more powerful than it's ever been before, perhaps even moreso than any other faction.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Z16：</span><br>
So you're saying... the Iron Blood is on top of the world right now. We're the one and only ones with this tech!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Brünhilde：</span><br>
Probably.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Z16：</span><br>
Man, hearing that is getting me all fired up! I wanna get back as soon as possible and tell everyone else about this!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Brünhilde：</span><br>
Don't be hasty. There is still much we don't know about these riggings.<br>
For instance, how we control them. They take on vastly different forms based on our hulls. Just compare how different yours are to mine.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Z16：</span><br>
Too many unknowns and too few answers, huh... Bummer.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Blücher：</span><br>
Question! Z16 and I are here because Bismarck put us on the case. Did she put you on it as well?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Brünhilde：</span><br>
Bismarck? No, it was someone else. I cannot tell you who, I'm afraid.<br>
Rest assured, Bismarck is aware of my role in this operation. I met her in another Mirror Sea not long ago.<br>
She, I dare say, has an important role to play in this as well.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Blücher：</span><br>
Whoa, someone beside Bismarck got you involved? Now I'm really curious!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Brünhilde：</span><br>
You'll learn who in due time. It cannot stay a secret forever.<br>
Now, it's late, so I suggest we all get some rest.<br>
The Mirror Sea operates training protocols even while the workshop is deactivated. It may occasionally create Sirens and hostile Pawns. Take them as a learning opportunity.<br>
Lastly, feel free to contact me if you have any questions. I'm available at all times on days without experiments.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Blücher：</span><br>
Gotcha! Don't forget to get plenty of food and rest!<br>
We'll see you in person during the next experiment!<br>

<br>
The experiment continued smoothly with the girls all resting on some days and fighting on others.<br>
While Brünhilde had lost the first battle, she mustered additional Pawns for the following rounds, slowly but surely turning the tides in her favor.<br>
Even so, a clear victor had yet to emerge. Neither side had achieved the experiment's objective of conquering the other's base.<br>
Until that happened, nobody was allowed to leave the Mirror Sea.<br>
Mirror Sea - Iron Blood Encampment<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Z16：</span><br>
Darn it! We were in such a good position, but she turned the tables on us just like that!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Blücher：</span><br>
She somehow knew we weren't prepared for two carriers out of nowhere. They completely ruined our formation!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Z16：</span><br>
What a load of bull! Like Graf Zeppelin wasn't tough enough, she even had a Pawn of one of your sisters!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Blücher：</span><br>
Seydlitz? Yeah, it felt weird seeing a Pawn of her... To make things worse, there are still more carriers Brünhilde can field if she wants!<br>
How the heck are we gonna deal with those?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Z16：</span><br>
CAN we even deal with 'em? The way I see it, this experiment is rigged against us!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Blücher：</span><br>
I get what you mean. Not only does she have more Pawns, those Pawns are all carriers and cruisers.<br>
And what do we get? Just a bunch of submarines and destroyers.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Z16：</span><br>
Hey! Don't talk crap about destroyers! I'm one, and I'm the best there is!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Blücher：</span><br>
I'm not badmouthing them at all, but it's objective reality that they're no match against a whole fleet of capital ships.<br>
Remember, this is Pawn-on-Pawn combat. Our own capital ships don't stand a chance if they're outnumbered.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Z16：</span><br>
You have a point...<br>
On the bright side, a lot of her Pawns don't have ASW capabilities. We could use our subs to chip away at her fleet.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Blücher：</span><br>
Ah, wolfpack tactics! That might just work!<br>
Putting strategy talk on hold for a sec, there's one thing that's been bothering me...<br>
The radio silence. Have you heard anything from Bismarck?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Z16：</span><br>
Nope, still nothing.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Blücher：</span><br>
She must be busy with her own operation, then. She said she'd give us advice if we needed, but... I guess we only have ourselves to rely on.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Z16：</span><br>
You don't think she might've...?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Blücher：</span><br>
Nuh-uh, no way! She's the flagship of our fleet, the strongest of us all!<br>
The Royal Navy's even grumbled over how unsinkable she is, remember? That battle is nothing she can't handle.<br>
If anything has gone wrong, it has to be our on-site equipment.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Z16：</span><br>
Yeah, I guess... Ugh, I'm so fed up with being stuck here. I wanna go hoooome!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Blücher：</span><br>
I do too, but we can't walk out on this experiment. Bismarck trusted us to finish it!<br>
And don't let your homesickness get the better of you, or we'll end up losing!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Z16：</span><br>
I'm not gonna walk out or give away the win! I know Iron Blood's future hinges on this thing!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Blücher：</span><br>
Good! If it helps, I think our final match is tomorrow.<br>
While we do have a Bismarck Pawn, we'll still have to go all-in and win as fast as we can.<br>

<br>
Mirror Sea - Experiment Area C3<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Blücher：</span><br>
Alright, let's put our new plan into action today! We'll swing this battle right back in our favor with these U-boat Pawns!<br>
Z16, lead the vanguard and perform a feint! Make sure you draw her attention!<br>
Once her Pawns give chase, I'll turn the capital ships around and break up the formation guarding her carriers!<br>
Our U-boats will make short work of 'em while they're in disarray!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Z16：</span><br>
Got it! Sounds like the perfect plan!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Blücher：</span><br>
Heheh☆ Let's see how those carriers hold up once we get all up in their faces!<br>
If our subs manage to neutralize 'em all, our victory is guaranteed!<br>
Now, let's do this thing!<br>
{{折叠面板|内容结束}}

{{折叠面板|标题=Blind Spot|选项=12|主框=1|样式=primary|展开=是}}
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Z16：</span><br>
Blücher, do you hear me?<br>
Your plan worked! Their attention is entirely on my Pawns!<br>
Also, the small-fry escorts have already broken off from their carriers!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Blücher：</span><br>
Heheh☆ She's been too focused on crushing us with an overwhelming frontal assault that she won't notice her blind spot!<br>
Come on, capital ships! On me!<br>
Her carriers are coming into view! We've almost... Wait, what the hell?!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Z16：</span><br>
What's happening, Blücher? Have you taken care of the carriers yet? My fleet won't last much longer!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Blücher：</span><br>
Got some trouble here! A battleship Pawn appeared out of the blue!<br>
<span style="color:#ec5d53;">Ulrich von Hutten?：</span><br>
......<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Blücher：</span><br>
We've got bad news... It looks stupidly strong!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Z16：</span><br>
Time is running out! You've got a Bismarck Pawn and greater numbers, so just deal with her!<br>
It's now or never, Blücher!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Blücher：</span><br>
Don't have to tell me twice! All ships, advance and take out that Pawn!<br>
{{折叠面板|内容结束}}

{{折叠面板|标题=Eve of the Finale|选项=13|主框=1|样式=primary|展开=是}}
<br>
The experiment was nearing its final stage.<br>
Blücher's fleet of capital ships tried to push through with brute force only to be stopped and swiftly defeated by a single battleship Pawn.<br>
What followed was another victory for Brünhilde. All areas were now under her control, save for one – the base's last line of defense.<br>
Blücher and Z16 were facing defeat. If Brünhilde conquered their base, that would spell the end of the experiment.<br>
Mirror Sea - Iron Blood Encampment<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Z16：</span><br>
She beat us AGAIN! How could this even happen...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Blücher：</span><br>
It's not hard to explain, really. We lost our firepower advantage as soon as that battleship Pawn showed up.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Z16：</span><br>
Well, what do we do now?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Blücher：</span><br>
There's not much we CAN do. It's game over for us once she takes the next area.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Z16：</span><br>
Grrr... What a load of bull!<br>
This game is rigged! It's unfair! Our Pawns have nothing on hers!<br>
Hell, we've hardly even gained any new Pawns since the start while hers keep getting stronger! And we still haven't heard a darn thing from Bismarck!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Blücher：</span><br>
That's all part of the operation. Well, probably.<br>
In the end, it doesn't matter whether we win, or Brünhilde wins. Both outcomes benefit Iron Blood.<br>
And hey, we did everything we could, from strategizing to commanding! If we lose, we lose knowing we did our best!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Z16：</span><br>
That's not much consolation...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Blücher：</span><br>
Look, I'm fed up with this place too! There's barely anything to do to kill time!<br>
Like, what are we supposed to do for fun? Talk to the Pawns? They don't say a thing back!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Z16：</span><br>
What do you mean? Thiele and I talk all the time.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Blücher：</span><br>
...You what? Are you joking? What do you talk about?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Z16：</span><br>
Just stuff. I talked about food just yesterday and she listened to it all!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Blücher：</span><br>
What?! This is huge if true! I've gotta note it down in my report!<br>
I need details! What exactly did she say?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Z16：</span><br>
Is it that important? Hang on, let me try to remember...<br>
Hey, Thiele! Just had breakfast – probably the best I've ever had!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Z2?：</span><br>
"Wow, did you? I'm listenin'. What else you got?"<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Z16：</span><br>
Yesterday's lunch was off the hook too! I never even knew Sardegna had so many kinds of pizza!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Z2?：</span><br>
"Wow, did you? I'm listenin'. What else you got?"<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Z16：</span><br>
And it's not just the pizza, they've got a million different kinds of spaghetti too!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Z2?：</span><br>
"Wow, did you? I'm listenin'. What else you got?"<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Z16：</span><br>
Wonder what we're havin' for dinner! Bet it'll be great too!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Blücher：</span><br>
...This is just a hunch, but I think that conversation only took place in your head.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Z16：</span><br>
What the hell! Why do you say that?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Blücher：</span><br>
First of all, she would never talk the same way you do. Second, why does she sound like a broken record. *sigh*... I'm not gonna bother writing any of that down.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Z16：</span><br>
Why not? What's the harm?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Blücher：</span><br>
I dunno, someone reading it and thinking you've lost your marbles?<br>
Now let's hit the hay. We're gonna need all the energy we can get for tomorrow's experiment.<br>
Now that I think about it, we used to have experiments every three days, but recently we've been fighting every day. Do you think something's wrong with the central terminal?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Z16：</span><br>
Maybe it's just as fed up as we are.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Blücher：</span><br>
Wouldn't that be funny? Heheh☆<br>
Oh well. Next battle's probably gonna be our last, but that's no reason not to give it our best shot!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Z16：</span><br>
Damn right. I'm not going down without a fight!<br>
{{折叠面板|内容结束}}

{{折叠面板|标题=The Final Battle|选项=14|主框=1|样式=primary|展开=是}}
<br>
The battle for the final area immediately adjacent to the base began, both sides knowing how it would end.<br>
Nevertheless, they fought with all their might. Blücher and Z16 mobilized a desperate last defense, bringing with them every Pawn they could.<br>
After much fighting, the victor's flag was finally hoisted over the loser's base. Brünhilde had won.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Blücher：</span><br>
Welp, guess that's it, even if the loss hasn't set in yet.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Z16：</span><br>
No surprise we lost in the end...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Brünhilde：</span><br>
I want to say there's more to a battle than winning or losing, but that would be in bad taste.<br>
In your defense, the Pawns were unfairly distributed from the very beginning, and you were also subject to a variety of restrictions.<br>
It wouldn't surprise me if the results of the experiment were predetermined, and our only role was to see it to completion.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Blücher：</span><br>
I know it wasn't fair and all that, but I still wanted to win! Winning's obviously more fun than losing!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Brünhilde：</span><br>
Of course. That goes without saying.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Z16：</span><br>
I suppose the Pawns have served their purpose now that the experiment's over. What's gonna happen to them now?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Brünhilde：</span><br>
In the case of the mass-produced ships, they'll be taken apart for materials per the central terminal's command.<br>
As for the Pawns, they'll likely also be taken apart after they've uploaded their combat data.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Z16：</span><br>
Doing your job only to get scrapped in the end... I know they're our enemy, but man, I kinda feel bad for them.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Brünhilde：</span><br>
Look around you. The Mirror Sea itself is changing – presumably because the experiment ended.<br>
See how the wreckages are being salvaged and the structures are changing form?<br>
I believe our exit will appear once everything is back the way it was. Then we will be able to go home.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Blücher：</span><br>
Well, while we're still here, why don't we end things with a proper shipgirl-on-shipgirl battle?<br>
The Pawns have gotten almost all the action this whole time, and I wanna see how we actually compare to each other. What do you say?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Brünhilde：</span><br>
Are you sure you want to? While I do have blanks to spare, they still hurt if they hit you in the wrong places.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Blücher：</span><br>
The same goes for you. If you don't have a problem with that, then I'm all for it!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Z16：</span><br>
Me too, on Blücher's side! Think you can handle that? I wouldn't hold it against you for chickening out versus the one-and-only ME!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Brünhilde：</span><br>
Hah. I'm a battlecruiser. It's child's play keeping up with one heavy cruiser and a destroyer.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Blücher：</span><br>
I wouldn't be so sure about that~! So, wanna settle this over at that exercise area?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Brünhilde：</span><br>
Fine by me. May our all-out battle be a satisfying climax to this long operation!<br>
{{折叠面板|内容结束}}

{{折叠面板|标题=The Way Home|选项=15|主框=1|样式=primary|展开=是}}
<br>
KABOOOM!<br>
The exercise area became host to the Mirror Sea's final battle, its combatants all in high spirits.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Blücher：</span><br>
Impressive! You battlecruisers are something else!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Brünhilde：</span><br>
Same to you both. What you lack in firepower you make up for with teamwork. I can see that you're closely coordinating to cover each others' weaknesses.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Z16：</span><br>
Your luck has run out, though! I've figured out your movements, so let's see you try to dodge THESE torpedoes!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">???：</span><br>
Well, well, it looks like you're all having fun over there.<br>
<br>
A calm voice spoke to the girls over the comms. All three promptly lowered their weapons.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Prinz Eugen：</span><br>
The experiment's over, yet here you are still fighting. Still high on the thrills of battle, hmm?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Z16：</span><br>
Is that... Prinz Eugen?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Prinz Eugen：</span><br>
Yep. The way out is open, and I've come to guide you to it.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Blücher：</span><br>
Heyo, Eugen! How come you didn't show up before to see me off?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Prinz Eugen：</span><br>
Sorry about that, I had my hands tied. At least now I'm here to pick you up.<br>
Congratulations on completing the experiment, Blücher, Z16, and... Brünhilde, I assume?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Brünhilde：</span><br>
Yes, Brünhilde of the O class. I'm glad that you and Friedrich came personally to see us.<br>
Friedrich, I've done everything you instructed me to. I will now return to my original fleet.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Z16：</span><br>
Friedrich? Is that the "someone other than Bismarck" person you mentioned a while back?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Brünhilde：</span><br>
Yes, that's her. I wasn't expecting to be graced by her company today.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Friedrich der Große：</span><br>
Heheheh. I am Friedrich der Große, blueprint ship of the Iron Blood. Allow me to congratulate you as well.<br>
Blücher, Z16, and Brünhilde, you have completed your experiment. Your contribution shall be the strength that takes Iron Blood another step forward.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Blücher：</span><br>
Heheh☆ Glad I could be of help!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Z16：</span><br>
And I'm glad that I got to see all sorts of badass rigging! Including yours, Friedrich!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Friedrich der Große：</span><br>
Why, thank you.<br>
Brünhilde, I'm afraid I have bad news concerning your original fleet. Its members have been reassigned.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Brünhilde：</span><br>
Oh... I see. That is a shame...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Blücher：</span><br>
So, Eugen, is Bismarck okay? I've got so much to ask her!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Prinz Eugen：</span><br>
Hmm? What are you talking about?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Blücher：</span><br>
She never called us, obviously! Oh, and the Pawn!<br>
She said she'd contact us at some point, but she never did. There's something weird about her Pawn, too.<br>
We were set to win initially, then Brünhilde's Pawns kept getting stronger while ours didn't! Even the Bismarck Pawn lost to some new battleship she got!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Prinz Eugen：</span><br>
Interesting... That Reenactment had ripple effects that even reached this place.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Friedrich der Große：</span><br>
Let's go, Eugen.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Prinz Eugen：</span><br>
Sure... Come on, we're heading back. We'll answer your questions later.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Blücher：</span><br>
Hmph. Well, fine!<br>
I'll hold on to my questions, but you can't stop me from making small talk with you!<br>
All this time I've only had Z16 and Brünhilde to talk to! I would've actually gone nuts if we'd been stuck here much longer!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Prinz Eugen：</span><br>
Fine, fine. I suppose I can lend an ear to my big sister's woes.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Z16：</span><br>
Oh man, I've been dying to finally go home!<br>
<br>
Eugen's and Blücher's animated chattering echoed across the vast expanse. The group of ships eventually reached the Mirror Sea's exit, and vanished into thin air.<br>

<br>
Before the experiment began...<br>
Somewhere, in an undisclosed location...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Bismarck：</span><br>
The moment of truth has come.<br>
Regardless of whether I succeed or fail, the curtains will rise on a new future for Iron Blood.<br>
No matter what becomes of me, you will take the reins henceforth.<br>
You are a blueprint ship and one of our key contacts to the Sirens. Observer trusts you.<br>
Iron Blood's fate rests upon your shoulders, Friedrich. Carry out the plan that we've so carefully crafted.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Friedrich der Große：</span><br>
It shall be done, Bismarck.<br>
I do have a question, though. Have you told Eugen about this yet?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Bismarck：</span><br>
Not yet. She has her part to play in this battle, and her "acting" must be authentic.<br>
You should decide when to tell her about our plan.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Friedrich der Große：</span><br>
Very well. I just hope she won't receive it too poorly.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Bismarck：</span><br>
She will come to understand. I'm sure of it.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Friedrich der Große：</span><br>
One last thing. Once you use the Black Cube, what then? Who will come to your aid?<br>
You don't have a rescue plan as far as I can tell.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Bismarck：</span><br>
I was hoping you wouldn't catch on so soon.<br>
I have no such plan. There's no need for one.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Friedrich der Große：</span><br>
Bismarck, there is still a non-zero chance that you will be able to control the Cube.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Bismarck：</span><br>
I'm aware of that, which is why I must make this gamble.<br>
But, even if I am able to control it, will I still be myself?<br>
You know how the Cube works. The more you synchronize with it, the deeper its corrosion seeps into you.<br>
Regardless of who – or what – I become, it is my fate to sink here. Whether by the Royal Navy's hands or by Siren technology, it matters not.<br>
While I continue to live, this Reenactment can never end... And Iron Blood will never be free to pursue its own future.<br>
Don't waste time or resources trying to save me. I shall see to it that I am the last sacrifice they ever make in their little game of chess.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Friedrich der Große：</span><br>
Sorry, but I can't accept that, Bismarck.<br>
Upon this blank score you've left me, I shall compose a symphony.<br>
I will free Iron Blood from the shackles of fate. You and the Commander are both indispensable in leading us to a brighter future.<br>
No matter how long it takes, no matter what it costs.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Bismarck：</span><br>
I presume you won't take no for an answer.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Friedrich der Große：</span><br>
No, I will not.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Bismarck：</span><br>
...I'll keep your plan in mind then.<br>
Hopefully I'll get to hear your symphony someday, somewhere.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Friedrich der Große：</span><br>
Yes. We will meet again, Bismarck. I swear it to you upon these seas.<br>
