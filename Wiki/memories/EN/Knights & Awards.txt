Chapter 1 - Sudden Invitation<br>
I received a sudden invitation from my secretary...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Cleveland：</span><br>
Commander, you wanna join my team for a basketball game?<br>
<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项1：Yeah, Clevebro, I sure as hell do!</span>'''''<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项2：I'd love to, Clevebro.</span>'''''<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Cleveland：</span><br>
Stop calling me Clevebro already! ... Also, I'm not asking if you wanna play, I'm asking if you wanna be our coach!<br>
Why, you may wonder? Hehe, you see, Akashi suggested it as a way to bolster relations between the Eagle Union and Sakura Empire. Although, we somehow ended up picking a competitive sport for it.<br>
The format's 3x3... Basically, each team consists of 4 players against another team of 4! And since we'll be playing, I thought I'd ask you to be our coach!<br>
There's a prize involved, of course! The winner receives — and get this — a money tree!<br>
Well, it's not really a tree, it's a plant, but that means I can make a bonsai out of it! That's two birds with one stone! Anyway, please, Commander! Be our coach!<br>
<br>
I knew that money doesn't actually grow on the plant she was referring to, despite its nickname... But I decided not to mention that and went along with becoming their coach.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Cleveland：</span><br>
... You'll do it? Sweet! I knew I could count on you!<br>
Oh, right, we still have work to do! A lot of it, too. C'mon, let's get a move on!<br>
I'll gather all the team members once we're done! Heheh, I haven't been this fired up in ages!<br>
Sorry, getting sidetracked! For now, let's focus on this paperwork! Here, please stamp this thing.<br>
<br>
Putting a pin in the basketball conversation for later, Cleveland got right back to work. It's just like her to be reliable like that.<br>
But still, why did they choose a basketball tournament out of all things...?<br>

Chapter 2 - Knights, Group Up!<br>
Evening - In the gymnasium<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Cleveland：</span><br>
Alright, everyone's in one place! And by everyone, I mean my little sisters, but... *Ahem*! Knights of The Sea, are you motivated?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Denver & Montpelier：</span><br>
Yeeaah!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Columbia：</span><br>
……Yeeaah!<br>
<br>
It looked like Cleveland had already assembled a team with 3 of her sister ships.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Cleveland：</span><br>
Okay, so, we'll be tackling a basketball tournament all as one team. For support, we'll have the Commander as our coach! Add some elbow grease and we have all the ingredients to win this thing!<br>
Let's begin with a rundown of the tournament's rules! If you didn't catch anything, just tell me.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Montpelier：</span><br>
... Understood. Give me the order, and I'll wipe out every opposing team by myself if I have to.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Cleveland：</span><br>
No, no, Monty! We're not shooting anyone, we're playing basketball!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Denver：</span><br>
Oh, I get it. A basketball tournament will promote the spirit of teamwork while at the same clearing out some friction between us! You're a genius, sis!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Cleveland：</span><br>
Um, I didn't plan all THAT, but okay... *Sigh*... Columbia, you get the idea, right?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Columbia：</span><br>
The gist of it, I guess... You basically wanted an excuse to show off to the Commander, right?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Cleveland：</span><br>
... W-wha?!<br>
<br>
Cleveland blushed up to her ears.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Denver：</span><br>
NOW I get it! If you can form a bond with the Commander, the fleet will grow stronger for sure! Okay! If it makes everyone happy, then I'll do all in my power to help!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Montpelier：</span><br>
That makes sense... Listen here, Cleveland's gone out of her way to captivate you. From this moment onwards, you'll need to always stay within 16 feet of her. Pay attention to everything she says and does and don't forget any of it.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Cleveland：</span><br>
No, you guys have it all wrong! Listen to me, for crying out loud!<br>

Chapter 3 - Make It Grain!<br>
A few days later - At the gymnasium<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Cleveland：</span><br>
*Pant*... *Pant*... Sorry I'm late!<br>
<br>
While everyone was training hard for the basketball tournament, something rather unusual happened: Cleveland arrived late.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Cleveland：</span><br>
Phew... Sorry, guys! I had some business I had to take care of! — Oh, water? Thanks, Commander!<br>
*Glug*... *Gug*... Ahhh! Just what I needed! Okay, okay, I'm late because I was just about done with my shift and...<br>
... And I was like, "What?! San Diego's responsible for a forest of wheat growing in the lawn behind the dorm?" ... But, like, what's wrong with that? Why don't they get you can make food with the wheat...<br>
And they're tellin' me, "If we just leave the wheat, the Fletchers are gonna play around in there.." But, like, there's not enough room for nearly 180 people back there; they like to play together...<br>
Then they're all like, "Well the trees you gave away have been buried under all the wheat!" Well, I gave them away, so I don't really mind! But NOW they're all goin' on about these trees and trying to guilt me into caring about them and stuff...<br>
But I, like, gotta go, you know, so I just said, "Okay, fine! I've got stuff to do, so we'll just have to harvest all that wheat super quickly! And stop calling me Clevebro!..."<br>
In short, some of the girls from the Eagle Union dorm asked me to help... I'm really sorry I wasn't on time!<br>
<br>
Cleveland apologized a few times before she settled down. She's been a part of my fleet for a long time, so I'd gotten pretty used to her doing that.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Cleveland：</span><br>
Let's get straight to the training! ... Actually, just a sec... Heeey! Guuuys! I brought some lunch boxes Helena put together! Let's eat later once we're done!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Denver：</span><br>
Thanks, sis! I owe you one!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Columbia：</span><br>
Oh, sis, when will you learn? Helena's are great, don't get me wrong, but sometimes you just wanna eat one of Cleveland's lunches. Y'know what I mean, Commander?<br>
<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项1：I second Columbia's opinion.</span>'''''<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Cleveland：</span><br>
H-huh, really? Then maybe I'll ask Helena about it next time... But only because you said you want it, Commander!<br>

Chapter 4 - Game Day<br>
Day of the basketball tournament - Assembly hall<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Cleveland：</span><br>
Finally, the day has come... We're all ready, Commander! We'll be counting on your instructions during the match!<br>
<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项1：It'll be easy!</span>'''''<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项2：Good luck!</span>'''''<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">St. Louis：</span><br>
Good luck, Cleveland! If you win, I'll have Helena make more lunches for you!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Helena：</span><br>
H-hey! Don't make promises like that without my say!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Cleveland：</span><br>
Ahahahah... Yep, that's just like her. But that aside, let's discuss our strategy one more time! Time's money... you know the drill~<br>
<br>
The first round was against the Justice Beavers.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Charles Ausburne：</span><br>
Well met, friends! I'm afraid you stand no chance against our righteousness! Little Beavers, let's go! ... Wait, guys...?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Foote：</span><br>
Ugh, too bothersome for me... I'm sitting this one out.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Thatcher：</span><br>
Ahahaha! Spence looks like she's gonna trip again! ... Oh, shoot, we're gonna collide!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Spence：</span><br>
Oh no, oh no! Look out, we're gonna collide!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Cleveland：</span><br>
This is our chance! Let's alley-oop for the slam-dunk!<br>
<br>
Cleveland's team won easily, making all the efforts of the Justice Beavers' coach, Downes, in vain.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Cleveland：</span><br>
Nice, we're off to a good start! If we keep this up, we'll win the finals! ... But the next one might not be so easy, heheh~<br>
<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项1：Pat Cleveland on the shoulder</span>'''''<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Cleveland：</span><br>
Thanks! Keep a watchful eye on us, Commander! We'll give it everything we have today!<br>

Chapter 5 - A Tough Team<br>
Cleveland's team went on winning match after match until it was time for the final round.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Columbia：</span><br>
Next, we're up against... Wait, seriously?! Sendai, Agano, and Myoukou?!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Montpelier：</span><br>
Hmph, whatever. We'll mop the floor with them. Right, sis?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Cleveland：</span><br>
I doubt it'll be that easy... They're probably already working out a counter to our positioning... For this match, we've gotta be cautious.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Denver & Columbia：</span><br>
Hooyah!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Montpelier：</span><br>
You're pretty tough after all... Guess that's why you're the flagship of Destroyer Division 3!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">{namecode:38}：</span><br>
Not bad, you've managed to keep up with me... But this ain't gonna be a repeat of last time we met!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Denver：</span><br>
I don't care if you're a heavy cruiser... I'm not gonna let you win!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">{namecode:63}：</span><br>
Come at me! I've trained long and hard for this, and I'm not planning on losing to you lot!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Cleveland：</span><br>
It's come down to a 1 on 1 for each of us...! They're using that strategy from way back then!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">{namecode:49}：</span><br>
Are you displeased with my choice of tactics? *Giggle*, then say it to my face~<br>
<br>
Cleveland's team was struggling with the strategy the opposing team was employing.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Cleveland：</span><br>
Dammit... I'm sorry, guys... It's all my fault for being such a poor leader...<br>
We made it all the way to the finals... And if we lose here, all will have been for nothing...!<br>
<br>
Then came the final half time. Though the match wasn't over yet, the Sakura Empire team had a pretty big point lead. Cleveland felt down, something she rarely does.<br>

Chapter 6 - From The Brink<br>
Cleveland's team went to cool down in the break room. They weren't exactly grumbling, but their faces showed signs of distress.<br>
<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项1：Cheer Cleveland up</span>'''''<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Cleveland：</span><br>
Thanks for trying to cheer me up, but this is all my fault... As the team leader, I'm trying to think of how to face everyone when we worked so hard to get here...<br>
Especially since I was the one who dragged you all into this thing in the first place...<br>
"I don't like seeing you depressed, Clevebro"?! ... Why do you keep calling me Clevebro?! Especially right now when I'm not feeling too great!<br>
"If you don't want me to call you Clevebro, then get your act together and be the dependable bro the team needs"...?<br>
Dammit, you're right! Let's rock and roll this thing! — Later, I'll make you regret calling me that!<br>
<br>
Once Cleveland started getting fired up, the rest of the team followed shortly.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Cleveland：</span><br>
C'mon! We're not out of the game yet! We'll show 'em what the Knights of The Sea are truly made of!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Denver & Montpelier：</span><br>
Hooyah!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Columbia：</span><br>
(Whispering) Thanks, Commander~<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">{namecode:63}：</span><br>
They're going to break through! Stop them from passing the ball, no matter what!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">{namecode:38}：</span><br>
Crap! Now that they've formed up, our strategy ain't gonna work...!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Cleveland：</span><br>
For the team... and for the Commander... this victory is OOOOUUUURS!<br>
<br>
HWEEEEEEE!<br>
Just as the whistle marking the game's end sounded, Cleveland landed a powerful dunk through the opposing team's basket.<br>
......<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Cleveland：</span><br>
WE DID IT! WE WOOOON!<br>
<br>
Immediately after scoring the winning goal, Cleveland came running over and threw herself at me.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Cleveland：</span><br>
Thank you, Commander! I love you!<br>
<br>
Though she was exhausted from the match, her joy and excitement could be felt through her tight grip around me.<br>

Chapter 7 - The Best Prize<br>
Port - Gymnasium<br>
Cleveland was in high spirits as she was holding the prize — the "money plant" — over her head.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Cleveland：</span><br>
First place, baby! The prize isn't what I was expecting, but it's still worth growing!<br>
So, let's... Huh? Commander, where's the team gone off to? I wanted to show them this thing, but I guess they left...<br>
Oh, and uh... Sorry, Commander... I heard money grows on this thing... so I wanted to win and give it to you, so you'd have a bit more money on your hands...<br>
Huh?! You knew all along money doesn't grow on it?! ... Then why didn't you stop me back when... Wait, did you WANT to do this...?<br>
<br>
Cleveland blushed up to her ears again.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Cleveland：</span><br>
Even putting the money stuff aside, this was a good chance to look cool in front of you, but I failed to capitalize on it...<br>
And in the end, you had to pick me up when I was feeling down... Oh well... All in all, how did I do during the tournament? <br>
<br>
I put my hand on Cleveland's head and gently ruffled her hair.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Cleveland：</span><br>
"As Cleveland, the team captain, you really weren't all that cool"... I mean, we've already established that much...<br>
"But as Clevebro, my secretary, you were hella cute"...<br>
Huh?<br>
Y-y-y-y-you think I was c-c-c-cute?!<br>
U-uh, uh... Um... C-cute, m-me...? Ahh... Oh, man... I...<br>
— H-hey, I told you to stop calling me Clevebro already!<br>
<br>
Then, Cleveland — fidgety, but with tears of joy in her eyes — and I left the gymnasium together.<br>
