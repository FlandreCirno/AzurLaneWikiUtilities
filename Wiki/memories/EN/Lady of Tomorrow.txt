<br>
Chapter 1 - A Little Visitor<br>
Port - One Day<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">???：</span><br>
So... this is the "Port," is it?<br>
It's much larger than I expected...<br>
Right! I must report to this "Commander" Akashi spoke of~<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Warspite：</span><br>
Are these documents ready for the Commander, Your Majesty?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Queen Elizabeth：</span><br>
Naturally! You're not implying my royal self would make mistakes, hmm?<br>
Hmph... and yet my servant still expects me to deliver them in person. The nerve of... Hm?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">???：</span><br>
Ah...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Warspite & Queen Elizabeth：</span><br>
Belfast?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Belfast?：</span><br>
Good day, mesdames. I am Belfast. May I ask, do either of you know where the "Commander" might be?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Queen Elizabeth：</span><br>
B-B-Belfast! You've shrunk! Aiiieeee!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Warspite：</span><br>
What... what's become of you...?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Little Bel：</span><br>
Hm? What are you talking about? Mesdames, I can assure you that I have not shrunk.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">{{AF|Akashi}}：</span><br>
Nya! I finally found you, nya! Didn't I tell you not to go running off, nya?!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Little Bel：</span><br>
Oh, Madam Akashi...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Queen Elizabeth：</span><br>
A-A-Akashi?! Explain yourself at once!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">{{AF|Akashi}}：</span><br>
Well, er, okay, so it's like this, nya...<br>

<br>
Chapter 2 - Accidents Have Consequences<br>
Port - A Few Days Ago<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">{{AF|Akashi}}：</span><br>
Ready, nya?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">{{AF|Yuubari}}：</span><br>
Yep. Just give the word.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">{{AF|Akashi}}：</span><br>
Hit it, nya! Commence "Wisdom Cube Composition Analysis Test #256," nya!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">{{AF|Yuubari}}：</span><br>
It's fair to say the Wisdom Cubes are sort of like our keels.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">{{AF|Akashi}}：</span><br>
If there's something wrong with your keel, you're in big trouble, nya.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">{{AF|Yuubari}}：</span><br>
Although it's common knowledge we were born from the Wisdom Cubes, no one has ever successfully analyzed the internal composition of the cubes themselves...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">{{AF|Akashi}}：</span><br>
The only way to get our hands on a Wisdom Cube is to harvest 'em, nya... They're what you'd call a "black box," nya...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">{{AF|Yuubari}}：</span><br>
But this time is different! This time we have this!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">{{AF|Akashi}}：</span><br>
This "weapon" we got from a battle with the Sirens, nya.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">{{AF|Yuubari}}：</span><br>
We've tentatively named it the "Focused Beam Emitter."<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">{{AF|Akashi}}：</span><br>
While we don't yet understand the principles at work, we do know that the device emits a heat ray with tremendous penetrative power when stimulated by a high voltage direct current, nya.<br>
We had a little problem last time... Yuubari said we oughta try recharging it, nya. Result was a base-wide blackout, and damn near a hole in my head, nya...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">{{AF|Yuubari}}：</span><br>
We must be willing to make sacrifices in the name of science...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">{{AF|Akashi}}：</span><br>
Safety comes first, nya...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">{{AF|Yuubari}}：</span><br>
We've prepared a large capacitor to guard against any power surges this time.<br>
So I don't expect we'll run into any such problems again...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">{{AF|Akashi}}：</span><br>
Let's run through the experiment one more time, nya!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">{{AF|Yuubari}}：</span><br>
We will direct the high-energy heat ray at the Wisdom Cube in an attempt to disintegrate or penetrate it, that we may analyze its internal composition.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">{{AF|Akashi}}：</span><br>
Wisdom Cube and Emitter in position nya! We're gonna see some serious shit, nya...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">{{AF|Yuubari}}：</span><br>
Engaging. Countdown: three, two...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Belfast：</span><br>
Madam Akashi, I've come to retrieve those docu—<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">{{AF|Akashi}}：</span><br>
B-Belfast, nya!? Yuubari, halt the expe—!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">{{AF|Yuubari}}：</span><br>
One! Firing the Emitter!<br>

<br>
Chapter 3 - Sisters?<br>
Port - Present<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">{{AF|Akashi}}：</span><br>
The prismatic light dancing from the irradiated Wisdom Cube was spectacular, nya!<br>
Belfast did take a direct hit from the beam, that was indeed a concern, nya...<br>
But on the other hand, the results were...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Warspite：</span><br>
On the other hand?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">{{AF|Akashi}}：</span><br>
The Wisdom Cube we were testing just disappeared, nya!<br>
And this little kid appeared in its place, nya...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Little Bel：</span><br>
Oh, my sister Madam Belfast is here too.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Belfast：</span><br>
Here you are. Good day, Your Majesty, Madam Warspite.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Edinburgh：</span><br>
Oh, uhhh... good day, your majesty... Come now, Little Bel, give your big sister a hug~<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Little Bel：</span><br>
Er, Edinburgh, Dear Sister, this... hurts...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Edinburgh：</span><br>
Awwww, you're so cute, Little Bel!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Belfast：</span><br>
Calm yourself, Dear Sister.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Edinburgh：</span><br>
Awww, does Big Bel want a hug too~?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Queen Elizabeth：</span><br>
So... does this mean there are three sisters now...?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Warspite：</span><br>
That is to say, this child is Belfast's little sister, right?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">{{AF|Akashi}}：</span><br>
When she first appeared, she introduced herself as "Belfast," nya.<br>
So as not to mix them up, I wanted to call her "Bel-chan" in the Sakura Empire way, but Yuubari reminded me she ought to have a Royal Navy name, nya. Hence "Little Bel," nya.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Belfast：</span><br>
I feel it needs to be said that I was born in precisely this form, having never known a childhood.<br>
However, it is my duty as head of the Royal Maids to instruct, raise, and nurture new recruits.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Little Bel：</span><br>
I shall proudly follow in the footsteps of my older sister!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Queen Elizabeth：</span><br>
Very good, then. Proceed!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Edinburgh：</span><br>
And it is my duty as your big sister to love you ever so dearly~<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Little Bel：</span><br>
Big Sister Edinburgh...<br>

<br>
Chapter 4 - An Adorable New Recruit<br>
Office - Later<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Little Bel：</span><br>
Good Day, "Commander," Maid-in-Training Bel, reporting for duty.<br>
<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项1：Ask Belfast what happened to her</span>'''''<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Belfast：</span><br>
I am over here, Master. This is my— No, that's not right. Rather, I am... Hmm...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">{{AF|Akashi}}：</span><br>
Let me explain it, nya...<br>
Get it, nya? Things've gotten a teensy bit complicated, so I thought we'd just bring her over here, nya...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Little Bel：</span><br>
May I... stay here? "Commander?"<br>
<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项1：Tell her of course she can</span>'''''<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项2：Tell her she's adorable</span>'''''<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Little Bel：</span><br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项1）</span>'''''Splendid~ You know, you're exactly as wise and as kind as the ladies said you were.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Little Bel：</span><br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项2）</span>'''''Does that mean... I can stay? This "Commander" may be a bit odd, but all the nice things the ladies said about the Commander were true.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">{{AF|Akashi}}：</span><br>
I knew the Commander wouldn't leave a kid out on the street, nya~<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Belfast：</span><br>
Thank you very much, Master. As head maid, I vow to educate this child in our ways, raising her to be a truly magnificent maid.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Little Bel：</span><br>
Aye-aye! I shall do my best!<br>
<br>
And so, the port welcomes a new recruit...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">{{AF|Akashi}}：</span><br>
But I still don't know how Little Bel came to be in the first place, nya...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">{{AF|Yuubari}}：</span><br>
Mental Cube... logrithmic casing... radiation... two similar people... radiation... ?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">{{AF|Akashi}}：</span><br>
Yuubari, do you have an idea, nya?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">{{AF|Yuubari}}：</span><br>
It's like... I almost have something... but... No, it's gone...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">{{AF|Akashi}}：</span><br>
Sounds like we've got more experiments to do, nya...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">{{AF|Yuubari}}：</span><br>
Right then, how shall we conduct Test #257...?<br>
