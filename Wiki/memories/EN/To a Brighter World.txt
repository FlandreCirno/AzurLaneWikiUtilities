Owing to Elizabeth's efficient orders, I'd been assigned a mission to attend a commemorative naval review with the Royal Navy before my private plane had even landed in the Orthodoxy.<br>
As such, my plane stopped only for a quick refueling before heading to the Royal Islands – to Scapa Flow, where Elizabeth had been staying for long. It was even starting to become a second administrative center.<br>
Royal Islands - Scapa Flow Anchorage<br>
Gate of Avalon<br>
Reception Area<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Miss D：</span><br>
Assistant! You've finally come to play with me!<br>
<br>
A girl with a stuffed whale in her arms flies at me as soon as I enter the reception room.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Oh, you don't need to be around the whale anymore? What happened to Death's Shadow?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Miss D：</span><br>
Heheh! She's gone off to somewhere! I don't have to deal with her anymore!<br>
That means I can go anywhere now!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Queen Elizabeth：</span><br>
Anywhere as long as it's within range of the Gate, that is.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Miss D：</span><br>
Hmph! Only because Elizabeth META won't let me go outside! She's a butthead!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Vanguard：</span><br>
You'd be in a lot of trouble if she heard that, young lady.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Miss D：</span><br>
Yeah, well, screw her!<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Elizabeth, Vanguard. Good to see you again.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Queen Elizabeth：</span><br>
The same to you, servant. Take a seat. You came just in time for tea. Let's wet our whistles and have a chat, shall we?<br>
<br>
I savor a cup of tea while admiring the beautiful garden. Time slips away in this leisurely atmosphere.<br>
I tell Elizabeth about what unfolded in Sky Realm Amahara, as well as what Helena META told me. She falls silent for a while, looking like she's brooding over something.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Queen Elizabeth：</span><br>
Yes. She does have a point – since she's no longer here, this is the safest place in the world.<br>
It's clear that she's afraid of something, however. Some kind of danger that would come for you as soon as she left, or something of that nature.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Honestly, I have no idea either. I'd like to ask the META Elizabeth about it.<br>
Would it be possible to get some time with her?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Queen Elizabeth：</span><br>
Well, she's currently in the middle of upgrading Avalon's navigation system, you see.<br>
Due to some unique circumstances, even I'm unable to get in direct contact with her.<br>
Fortunately, we do share news once every three days. Our next scheduled contact is actually tomorrow at noon, so I could bring you along then.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
That's great. I guess I'll be staying here until then.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Queen Elizabeth：</span><br>
But of course. You ought to stay under my protection until the danger has passed.<br>
Bel, bring us something good to eat.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Belfast：</span><br>
Certainly, Your Majesty.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
(Considering how much Helena stressed her point, something seems bound to happen.)<br>
(She was in such a rush that day that she might not have had time to share intel with Memphis and the rest.)<br>
(Even so, it's been several days now. Why hasn't anyone tried to contact me?)<br>
(I'd contact them if I could, but I have no way to do it.)<br>
(I feel so powerless, having no choice but to wait...)<br>
<br>
Royal Islands - Gate of Avalon<br>
Commander's Break Room<br>
Late at Night<br>
Before I go to sleep, I receive a message from Memphis.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Memphis：</span><br>
Heheh. I'm not in the Orthodoxy's capital anymore, Commander. Can you guess where I am?<br>
I'll let you in on a secret. I made a crazy discovery just a while ago.<br>
If you're lucky, you might receive a surprise in not too long!<br>
Keep an eye out for it!<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
That's... awfully mysterious of her.<br>
"Surprise," she says. What kind of surprise? Hope it's a good one.<br>
<br>
Somewhere, in an unknown location...<br>
As the light fades, a bright campus landscape fills my view.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
What the...?<br>
I should be asleep at the Gate of Avalon... Did I end up here as I was dreaming? Sure hope Elizabeth META's defenses weren't breached...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">？？：</span><br>
Hi.<br>
<br>
Suddenly, I realize there's a girl wearing a white dress in front of me.<br>
Her presence feels so natural, almost like she's been standing here the whole time.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Who are you? Haven't we met before?<br>
Where's Lady E? Is she here?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">？？：</span><br>
On vacation.<br>
<br>
The girl in the dress suddenly appears under a tree in the distance, then one blink of an eye later, she appears under another tree further away.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Are you telling me to follow you?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">？？：</span><br>
......<br>
<br>
Without a word, the girl quickly moves between the trees.<br>
Following her trail of afterimages, I run around the campus.<br>
As I go deeper, a single thought emerges from the back of my mind.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Are you trying to lead me to someone?<br>
Someone other than Lady E?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">？？：</span><br>
Hurry.<br>
<br>
She suddenly moves a lot faster. I pick up the pace to keep up with her.<br>
Then, as I turn a corner...<br>
The world is instantly repainted a white color. The girl, the school, and everything else vanish.<br>

To a Brighter World<br>
<br>
2 Act One<br>
I open my eyes to the morning sunshine and an unfamiliar ceiling.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
...Talk about a big room.<br>
Is this... where I fell asleep last night?<br>
No. Something's not right.<br>
<br>
I get dressed and leave the room. Charybdis from the Royal Maids is already there outside the door, waiting for me.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Charybdis：</span><br>
Good morning, Master. I hope that your night at the castle was most pleasant.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Figures. I'm in a castle. Though, I'm pretty sure I went to bed at Av–<br>
<br>
The words get stuck in my throat, and my train of thought halts.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Did I... spend the night here?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Charybdis：</span><br>
That is correct.<br>
Your confusion is understandable. It was a busy day for you, with the naval review in the morning and a spontaneous mock night battle with Her Majesty.<br>
Please follow me. Her Majesty awaits you for breakfast in the courtyard.<br>
<br>
Charybdis brings me out to the courtyard. When we arrive, Belfast and the Royal Maids have just finished preparing breakfast.<br>
There is a long table set up on the green lawn, at which Elizabeth, Vanguard, Monarch, as well as Illustrious and her sister sit.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Queen Elizabeth：</span><br>
Good morning, servant.<br>
Don't just stand there! Come, sit. I reserved this seat just for you.<br>
<br>
Despite being surrounded by smiles, I get an odd sense that something isn't quite right.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
(A short girl carrying around a stuffed animal... Why do I feel like someone matching that description is missing?)<br>
(Stuffed animal... A stuffed whale?)<br>
Elizabeth, did I bring up anything about a whale yesterday?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Queen Elizabeth：</span><br>
A whale? Ladies, do you remember anything?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Illustrious：</span><br>
Hmm... No, I'm afraid I don't remember such a thing. Why do you ask, Commander? Would you like to see a whale?<br>
We don't have any large aquariums at Scapa Flow, sadly. Perhaps at LD Harbour?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Victorious：</span><br>
Seeing one in its natural habitat would be quite lovely, too!<br>
Although, it would take a while to find one. Are you planning on staying here for an extended time, Commander?<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
(Yeah. I would like to see a whale. But... not in that way, exactly?)<br>

To a Brighter World<br>
<br>
3 Act Two<br>
After I finished all my business in the Royal Islands, Elizabeth gave me an ardent vacation offer, which I politely declined.<br>
Then, without a minute to rest, I headed to my next destination – the Sea of Stars.<br>
The very moment I set foot on the base, the mood feels strangely off to me.<br>
Every single person I pass looks at me with a smile concealing something deeper, and once I leave their sight, I hear them whisper something among each other.<br>
Memphis spoke of a surprise. Now I'm here, on a sudden visit to the Sea of Stars. The dots connect in my head.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
(...Oh my god!)<br>
<br>
With my heart beating out of my chest, I walk faster, passing through several wards. Then, finally...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Sea of Stars Main System：</span><br>
Identity verified. Welcome, Commander.<br>
<br>
This is the sickroom where Lexington's care pod was housed. It's supposed to be here, and yet...<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
It's gone...<br>
......<br>
<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项1：Lexington... Are you there?</span>'''''<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">???：</span><br>
I'm glad you came, Commander.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Huh?!<br>
Is... Is that really you?! You've finally woken up! Are you feeling okay?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">???：</span><br>
Of course! I've made a full recovery thanks to the hard work Sara put in day after day.<br>
The next time you see her, be sure to praise her for doing such a good job.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
(Huh? Where...)<br>
Where are you? Why can't I see you?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">???：</span><br>
Why, I'm hiding to create a sense of mystery and make it more of a surprise.<br>
Why don't you look for me, hmm?<br>
<br>
I look around the room. The cold medical equipment and the care pod have all been put away.<br>
In their place, there is a bed with soft sheets and pillows, a large closet, and a few couches and furnishings. The place feels lived in.<br>
If she's hiding in here, the best place to look would be...<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Wait... "Look for me"?<br>
...It's YOU, Saratoga!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Saratoga：</span><br>
Teehee! No surprise you figured it out so quickly!<br>
Whoa! Hey, don't be mad! Take it easy!<br>
I just wanted to lift the mood in this place a bit, you know? Plus, this surprise isn't for you – it's for Lex as well.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Okay... So Lexington really did make it?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Saratoga：</span><br>
Yep! I was just having a little bit of fun with you. I wouldn't go THAT far, you know.<br>
I mean, listen. Do you hear that?<br>
<br>
I listen closely, and I hear a pair of voices from the hallway, drawing closer.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Memphis：</span><br>
I saw all your test results came back looking great. What a relief!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Lexington：</span><br>
Why, of course. I know my body better than anyone else.<br>
If Sara weren't such a worrywart, I think I'd have gotten a discharge yesterday.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Memphis：</span><br>
Ahaha... It wasn't just her – we've ALL been worried. Remember, don't assume things and be careful.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Lexington：</span><br>
Sure, but some of the things they tested for today were a bit... odd, it felt like.<br>
It feels like I'm being kept in the dark. Are you and Sara planning something?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Memphis：</span><br>
Ahaha... Well, the thing is...<br>
Oh! Lex! You've got a guest!<br>
Go on. Open the door and see for yourself!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Sea of Stars Main System：</span><br>
Identity verified. Welcome, Lexington and Memphis.<br>
<br>
With an automated announcement, the door silently opens.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Lexington：</span><br>
Huh?!<br>
<br>
Lexington stands at the entrance to the room. There is nothing standing between us now.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
......<br>
<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项1：Welcome back, Lexington.</span>'''''<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Lexington：</span><br>
I'm glad to be back, {playername} – my Commander.<br>
<br>
This was certainly a surprise by any meaning of the word. A pure, massive, and unexpected surprise.<br>
So much so that when Lexington was reprimanding Saratoga for her prank, I couldn't help but tell her to let it go.<br>
As Saratoga went on to explain, it was a series of recent technological breakthroughs at the Sea of Stars that made Lexington's recovery possible.<br>
In the back of my mind, I felt a little doubt and a dash of discomfort about these breakthroughs...<br>
However, those were unimportant compared to what really mattered.<br>
That Lexington was back with us.<br>

<br>
4 Act Three<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Enterprise：</span><br>
We have located all of the Sirens' hidden test sites across the Pacific.<br>
Now it is time to clear them out in one fell swoop and restore peace to this ocean.<br>
Commander, welcome to PH Harbor.<br>
I hereby cede command over the Pacific theater to you. Lead us to victory.<br>
<br>
There are operations taking place across the world to eliminate the remnants of the Sirens.<br>
Among all the regions, the one with the largest remnant force is the Pacific Ocean.<br>
It's for that reason that I've returned to PH Harbor to resume a duty that I haven't performed in a long time – that of a fleet commander.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Bayard：</span><br>
Tester once ruled over this ocean, and now there remains no sign of her.<br>
What few test sites remain will stand no chance against us.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Sovetskaya Rossiya：</span><br>
Precisely. Thanks to the Commander uniting our various factions with different goals, we're able to work together and destroy one mainframe after another.<br>
The first light of daybreak now shines upon us.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Zuikaku：</span><br>
Commander, you have the full cooperation of the Sakura Empire's fleets and regional bases!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Chien Wu：</span><br>
Heehee. United we stand, and step by step do we advance. Together, we will fully reclaim the Pacific.<br>
<br>
Later that night...<br>
During my voyage with the fleet, I had something I hadn't experienced in a while – a dream.<br>
A figure draped in red was running through a field of dark clouds.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Akagi：</span><br>
Commander! Commandeeer!<br>
<br>
She was cradling the Watatsumi, a faint light emitting from her body.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Akagi：</span><br>
Commander, you must return to Amahara at once! I have something I need to tell you!<br>
<br>
Her expression was contorted with panic, like something was chasing her from behind.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Akagi：</span><br>
Please... Please make haste!<br>
<br>
Pure white enveloped the world in an instant. Akagi, the dark clouds, and everything else were gone.<br>

<br>
To a Brighter World<br>
<br>
5 Act Four<br>
Based on prior experience, I can't dismiss this as just another dream, given that Akagi and the Watatsumi were involved.<br>
And so, I decide to adjust the fleet's course toward the Sakura Empire under the pretense of inquiring about the state of Amahara's reconstruction.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Asama：</span><br>
Commander, whilst we did experience some rather disagreeable malfunctions, the Venerable Three have already reconstructed the dubitable areas.<br>
Amahara is now, for all intents and purposes, free of concealed dangers.<br>
At present, we are making efforts to further bolster the barriers' mentally stabilizing effects, as well as putting into practice a plan to expand the Five Provinces and Seven Districts.<br>
As a positive side effect, all within the range of Amahara's grace have additionally reported a notably improved quality of sleep.<br>
<br>
From what I heard, it sounded like the Amahara Project had finally gotten on the right track.<br>
After an exchange of technological progress, I decided to visit Akagi's residence by myself.<br>
However, once I arrive, I'm instead greeted by an unexpected character.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Hakuhou：</span><br>
A pleasure it is to see you again, Commander. Do you have any business with Akagi?<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
...Hakuhou? Yeah, I wanna talk to her.<br>
She apparently had something to tell me. Can I see her?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Hakuhou：</span><br>
My apologies. Akagi is... not in a state fit for conversation at the moment.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
What do you mean?<br>
<br>
An unpleasant feeling crawls into my mind.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Hakuhou：</span><br>
You see, a few days ago, Akagi took the Watatsumi without our permission.<br>
Once we understood what had happened, we discovered her fast asleep in her own room.<br>
Miss Yamato speculates that Akagi had used the Watatsumi to perform some kind of ritual. This ritual is believed to have failed and caused some damage to her psyche.<br>
While it doesn't appear to be severe, only the heavens know when she might wake up again.<br>
Perhaps as little as a few months. Perhaps as much as a few years...<br>
<br>
The creeping feeling I had was right.<br>
I asked Hakuhou to lead me to where Akagi is.<br>
There she lies on the bed, a look of calm restfulness on her face. She's in a deep slumber.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
(This reminds me a lot of Marco– Wait, who?)<br>
<br>
A thought crosses my mind, only to instantly vanish like it went up in smoke.<br>
Akagi has reliable people like Yamato at her side. I don't need to be too worried about her.<br>
If only I could know when she'll wake up, and what she was trying to tell me in that dream.<br>
After leaving Amahara behind, I suddenly receive a message from Veneto.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Vittorio Veneto：</span><br>
Greetings and salutations, Commander.<br>
I've been informed that the fleet you're leading across the Pacific Ocean has enjoyed victory after victory, and I wish to congratulate you.<br>
Should circumstances permit it, once your campaign there is over, could you offer your aid to the Mediterranean Sea?<br>
As you are aware, the situation here is exceedingly complicated, and the Sirens' lingering forces are powerful indeed.<br>
The greatest help we could ask for is if you were to personally take command in our battles.<br>
I sincerely hope to hear back from you soon.<br>
Also, I look forward to a chance to personally speak to you about a vacation in– Pardon, I meant, "Speak to you about our campaign."<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
...She just said "vacation," didn't she?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Memphis：</span><br>
"As you are aware," the enemy they're fighting is "powerful indeed."<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Helena：</span><br>
She doesn't sound the least bit convincing.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Memphis：</span><br>
That said, the reports I've read from the front over the past few days say the enemy is way weaker than anticipated.<br>
If they stay that way, then we'll fully wrap up the Pacific campaign within this month.<br>
And if we do, wouldn't it be nice to go to the Mediterranean?<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
The Mediterranean...<br>
<br>
Our next target after the Pacific is supposed to be the Atlantic.<br>
On the other hand, the storm at the heart of it has calmed down, making that front rather stable.<br>
Beyond that, there's also the South Pacific and the Mediterranean. It doesn't matter much which one we pick.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Memphis：</span><br>
Then let's go to the Mediterranean! Veneto's already asked for help, so the situation must be pretty dire, right?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Helena：</span><br>
That's true. What do you say, Commander?<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
(They've got "Please! Let's go there!" written all over their faces...)<br>
Alright. The Mediterranean is our next objective.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Memphis：</span><br>
Sweet!<br>
<br>
Sky Realm Amahara - ???<br>
After Amahara regained its calm, the woman lying in bed opened her eyes.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Akagi：</span><br>
The Commander has left...<br>
This time, it was I who broke a promise between us...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ikazuchi：</span><br>
"Your meeting was not to be. Bide your time."<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Inazuma：</span><br>
"All outside interference has gone. You are the one thing remaining."<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ikazuchi：</span><br>
"By which I mean – you are the final anomaly."<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Inazuma：</span><br>
"Were it discovered, it shall be amended."<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ikazuchi：</span><br>
"Thus shall this world's system achieve self-congruency."<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Inazuma：</span><br>
"The Commander shan't awaken again."<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Akagi：</span><br>
Urgh...<br>
Please, Commander... Don't let those bright possibilities carry you away...<br>
<br>
After softly sighing out her plight, Akagi quietly closed her eyes again, sinking back into her deep sleep.<br>

To a Brighter World<br>
<br>
6 Act Five<br>
By the end of the month, the Pacific campaign had concluded as expected, and I made my way to the Sardegna Empire.<br>
After a series of formal events, it was finally time to convene a military conference to get things on track...<br>
That is, until I learned a shocking fact – the Sardegna Empire hadn't even begun amassing its fleet.<br>
I was somewhat braced for this, but seeing it with my own eyes, I couldn't help but sigh.<br>
With little option left but to stay for a few days longer, I decided to enjoy the beautiful sights around the capital.<br>
Today, Memphis, Helena, and I have come to the Grand Cathedral Museum, the most famous of its kind in Rome.<br>
In line with its name, its interior is absolutely stunning.<br>
Helena appears fascinated with the many sculptures in the animal hall.<br>
Memphis, meanwhile, looks around at the paintings in the art gallery.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Memphis：</span><br>
This place has an interesting layout.<br>
This place, too... It's got a lot of history, and these buildings are massive.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
(I hope she hasn't confused that antique map of Sardegna for some kind of tourist map.)<br>
(Ancient castles, old maps... It feels like I'm forgetting something.)<br>
(Oh, right! Ever since I got here, it's felt like another important person should be here...)<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Littorio：</span><br>
Hahaha! Commander! I take it the Museum is to your liking?<br>
<br>
Just as I sink deep into thought, a buoyant voice rings out in my ear.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Yeah. This place has earned its reputation. It's well worth the visit.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Littorio：</span><br>
I'm glad to hear it.<br>
As it so happens, our fleets have finished amassing and our flagship has arrived in Rome. I've heard we can convene the conference shortly.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
At long last. How about–<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Littorio：</span><br>
One more thing. Veneto and I would like to host the conference tomorrow morning. Is that fine with you?<br>
Ah, seems the Museum is about to close. Why don't we go and spend the rest of the day sightseeing?<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Alright. Sounds like a plan.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Littorio：</span><br>
Heh – it's not like you could cover the whole Museum in a single day anyway.<br>
If you feel like visiting again, do give me a call.<br>
I'd be glad to show you around not just the Museum, but the spectacles around all of Sardegna.<br>
We have ample time, and there's no shortage of things to see in our country.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
(She's totally in vacation mode...)<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Memphis：</span><br>
Okay, then could you show us around the old town of Florence?<br>
Oh, and the Lighthouse of Genoa! I wanna see that!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Littorio：</span><br>
I would love to, Signorina! Incidentally, I saw you passionately eyeing that mural a minute ago...<br>
Searching for places to visit, were we? Ah, such a brilliant mind you have!<br>
Florence and Genoa are splendid places, of course, but I also strongly recommend you pay a visit to the aquatic city that is Venice!<br>
<br>
As the topic changes to vacation destinations, Memphis and Littorio suddenly find a wide array of things to talk about.<br>
Based on the intel I've gathered over the past days, the Siren force situated in the Mediterranean is – as previously thought – the weakest among all the theaters.<br>
Four groups have jointly undertaken the task of sweeping them up – the Royal Navy, the Iris Orthodoxy, Iron Blood, and the Sardegna Empire.<br>
Iron Blood's fleet is being led by Bismarck, while Richelieu commands the Orthodoxy's force.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
(The Sirens' fates are practically sealed already.)<br>
(Looks like my stay in the Sardegna Empire will be a leisurely vacation after all.)<br>

To a Brighter World<br>
<br>
7 Act Six<br>
During my stay in Sardegna, I received status updates from all the various fronts.<br>
The remaining Siren forces in the Antarctic Ocean, the Pacific Ocean, the South Pacific Ocean, the Atlantic Ocean, and the Arctic Ocean have all been eliminated.<br>
Reports of victory have also come in from the Great Lakes, the Caspian Sea, the Dead Sea, Lake Baikal, Lake Victoria, and many other inland bodies of water.<br>
As I'm compiling all of this news into one report, something suddenly dawns on me – we've reached a juncture that will go down in human history.<br>
At this point in time, all the Siren stragglers on the planet have been completely eliminated.<br>
After fighting the Sirens for so many years, we have finally achieved a complete victory over them.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Once this news gets public, the whole world will rejoice in celebration...<br>
<br>
While going through battle reports from across the world, an unexpected notice from the Northern Parliament reaches me.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Sovetsky Soyuz：</span><br>
Comrade Commander, based on the Siren data we recovered, we have discovered enormous, perfectly-preserved Siren facilities at the North and South Poles, one in each.<br>
We, the Northern Parliament, have been studying polar magnetism trajectories occurring during geomagnetic reversals.<br>
It is our belief that these newly discovered facilities are the cause of the planet's magnetic trajectory anomalies.<br>
It's believed the Sirens used these facilities to manipulate our poles, intentionally aligning our geographic poles with our geomagnetic ones.<br>
As for why they did something like this, we don't yet know.<br>
However, based on other data, we learned about a huge risk associated with the sun entering a period of activity.<br>
Under certain circumstances, the energy particle flow found in solar winds can interact with space-time itself, causing a series of time-space anomalies with anything in their path.<br>
This can create an array of Singularities that, while unstable, short-lived, and coming in various sizes, are most certainly still Singularities.<br>
The Sirens refer to this phenomenon as an "Intertwined Storm."<br>
In addition, the Sirens possessed a technology that could create a unique protective layer outside our planet by manipulating our stable geomagnetism.<br>
To use an analogy, if the Sakura Empire's Sky Realm Amahara was an attempt to construct a mental barrier, then this Siren technology was an attempt to construct a physical barrier.<br>
We don't yet understand the connection between this technology and the facilities at the poles, or the Singularities created in outer space and the unique protective layer.<br>
Even so, we believe these are monumental discoveries. We hope to put further resources toward thoroughly studying them.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
She's right. This is a colossal discovery.<br>
A physical barrier and a mental one... Couldn't you create a shield that perfectly envelops the world if you combined them?<br>
All world factions need to get involved in this. We need to thoroughly research these things.<br>

致美好世界<br>
<br>
第七幕<br>
终于，到了这万众瞩目的一天。<br>
大会堂中，今日座无虚席。<br>
无尽的会议迎来了终结。<br>
一切的争执，一切的试探，一切的妥协都迎来了终结。<br>
没有在碧蓝航线指挥部，而是在此地，在「联盟合并」会议开启的地方，迎来了其自身的终结——<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">列克星敦：</span><br>
塞壬——突然出现，以压制性力量占据了海洋的异形敌人。<br>
在这场突如其来的浩劫之初，我们各怀心思、各自为战……<br>
所带来的结果也是惨痛的。<br>
我们失去了90%以上的大海，科技与生活水平急剧倒退，文明几乎崩坏……<br>
生死存亡之际，我们摒弃前嫌、团结一致，集中所有力量成立了联合军事组织「碧蓝航线」。<br>
我们集结共享了所有技术与资源，以期能打造出一支与塞壬抗衡的精锐舰队。<br>
结果而言，我们成功了。<br>
而在这数十年间鲜血的浸染下，「碧蓝航线」所代表的含义已经远远超出了单纯的军事联盟。<br>
它更是一个象征，一个代表着我们从分散到联合，从绝望到希望，从旧日磨难走向未来新生的象征——<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">{namecode:435:俾斯麦}：</span><br>
碧蓝航线成立于我们历史中最黑暗的时代。<br>
我们虽心怀对美好未来的憧憬，却不得不面对每日挣扎在生死边缘的现实。<br>
在塞壬的重压下，我们所有人都迷茫过，彷徨过……<br>
最初，或许只是一个不同的看法，一个理念的分歧……<br>
可随着时间推移，这些细小的裂纹在暗中连结、扩散……直到形成了一道不可忽视的、无法弥合的大裂痕。<br>
碧蓝航线在那一刻分裂了。<br>
那是一段混乱的时期。<br>
有限的情报、过度的猜忌、膨胀的野心，再加上塞壬无孔不入的挑拨……<br>
这场晦暗的风暴中，我们所有人都做出过错误的决定。<br>
万幸的是，那束在碧蓝航线成立之初点亮的火苗依然在我们所有人的心中燃烧着。<br>
我们所有人都没有放弃，这份希望之火也没有放弃。<br>
最终，火焰融化了隔阂的坚冰，光芒驱散了晦暗的雾霭。<br>
我们心中的目标一致，因此，我们理应殊途同归。<br>
塞壬的出现让我们文明进入了一个全新的阶段，而碧蓝航线的成立为这个全新的阶段奏响了主旋律。<br>
自然，赤色中轴则是这段主旋律中一段别样的插曲。<br>
如今，到了这段插曲圆满结束的时候了。<br>
赤色中轴将在今天之后成为历史。<br>
让我们以团结一致的姿态，昂首挺胸向着未来进发吧——<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">列克星敦：</span><br>
两条道路，合二为一。<br>
破碎的联盟，再次统一。<br>
我们战胜了塞壬，不代表为了战胜其而建立的碧蓝航线从此失去了意义。<br>
恰恰相反，它将在未来发挥出更加重要的作用。<br>
毕竟，这一次入侵的是塞壬，这一次我们胜利了。<br>
那，下一次呢？<br>
世界之外并不安全。<br>
我们能做的只有团结与联合，以一个整体的姿态，同进同退。<br>
在碧蓝航线的旗帜下，一同走向那不确定的未来——<br>
<br>
列克星敦和{namecode:435:俾斯麦}的演讲结束了。<br>
世界在此刻陷入沉默，世界正等待着我的发言。<br>
美好的世界就在前方，只需再向前踏出一步。<br>
踏上主席台，以推动联盟重新合并之人、以带领人类文明取得胜利之人、以碧蓝航线的指挥官……<br>
为这个美好的故事画上一个完美的句号——<br>
「这样，就好么？」<br>
<br>
<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项1：这样就好……</span>'''''<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
嗯，这样就好……<br>
<br>
我放下了怀疑，沉浸在欢庆的气氛中，与这个美好的世界融为了一体。<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Lexington：</span><br>
指挥官，分裂的碧蓝航线能够再次融为一体，最大的功劳非你莫属呢。<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Saratoga：</span><br>
了不起的大成就哦~我以前做梦都没想过会有这样一天！<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Yorktown II：</span><br>
塞壬失败了，世界也走向了团结。接下来的一段时间内，大家可以筹备一下度假的事了呢~<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Enterprise：</span><br>
度假么……指挥官，你有什么想去的地方么？<br>
无论你去哪里，我都跟着你。<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">New Jersey：</span><br>
Honey~！我也一样~我也一样！<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Queen Elizabeth：</span><br>
没想到这件事真让你给办成了……<br>
了不起，史书上会重重记你一笔的。<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">King George V：</span><br>
你缔造了无数难以想象的奇迹，你无愧于真正的海上传奇。<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Hood：</span><br>
指挥官，战争虽然结束了，但皇家永远是你的盟友。<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Illustrious：</span><br>
愿光辉永远与你同在~<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Bismarck Zwei：</span><br>
漫长的一天，不是么？<br>
我们为此准备了许久，在泥潭中挣扎了许久。<br>
但一切都是值得的，新的时代开始了。<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Prinz Eugen：</span><br>
呵呵~主席台上的你是如此迷人，我都有点心动了呢~<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Richelieu：</span><br>
这是一场在鸢尾见证下的伟大成果，祝贺你，指挥官。<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Clemenceau：</span><br>
从今往后，鸢尾教国新生中最后一丝不谐之音也可以烟消云散了呢~<br>
很荣幸能与你处于同一个时代，指挥官。<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Amagi(CV)：</span><br>
至此，重樱再次成为了碧蓝航线的一员，我们彻底站在了同一面旗帜下。<br>
今后也请多指教了，指挥官~<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Nagato：</span><br>
在吾接手前，吾真没想到一件看似简单的事……执行起来竟是如此……繁琐。<br>
还好，一切都已尘埃落定，吾可以全身心投入下一项工作了。<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Mikasa：</span><br>
哈哈哈~没想到我还能再次见到如此壮观的外交盛事，如此之景，真是未来可期啊！<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Unzen：</span><br>
{playername}，不论未来如何，我都永远支持你。<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Sovetsky Soyuz：</span><br>
我就知道这件事能成功，祝贺你，指挥官同志。<br>
世界虽然恢复了和平，但我们要做的事还有很多。<br>
我计划近日就向指挥部提出两极塞壬设施的研究计划，碧蓝航线内的所有阵营应该合作研究这些资料。<br>
到时候又要拜托你了，指挥官同志~<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Avrora：</span><br>
呵呵，所谓能者多劳，就是这样子啦~<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Kirov：</span><br>
别担心指挥官同志，我们永远和你站在一起。<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Vittorio Veneto：</span><br>
真是一场无可挑剔的演讲，令人心潮澎湃。<br>
如此盛会，要是在撒丁帝国举办就更好了……鸢尾真是好福气。<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Littorio：</span><br>
啊哈哈~如今我们又是碧蓝航线的一员了，可喜可贺，同喜同贺~！<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Andrea Doria：</span><br>
我从没想过能够看到联盟再次合并的一天……谢谢你，指挥官。<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Impero：</span><br>
显而易见，指挥官的伟大也是自然的、当然的、无可置疑的……！<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Gouden Leeuw：</span><br>
呵呵，我们今后再也不用头疼怎么向人解释王国的阵营归属问题了呢。<br>
这一切多亏了你哦，郁金王国舰队的恩人，尊敬的指挥官阁下~<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Yat Sen：</span><br>
各大阵营放下分歧……在同一面旗帜下以一个整体的身份携手并进。<br>
毫无疑问，这是一场属于文明的胜利。<br>
对于在这样的未来下，人类文明能取得的最终成果，东煌很期待，我也很期待。<br>
指挥官，东煌永远是你的朋友。<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Memphis：</span><br>
啊……联盟合并成功了……再也不用开会了……<br>
指挥官！海伦娜！咱们终于解放了……！<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Helena：</span><br>
上次还没玩得尽兴……在下一项工作之前，要不要一起再去度个假呢？<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Memphis：</span><br>
完全赞同！<br>
指挥官~你要是同意的话就是三比零，不同意的话就是二比一——<br>
少数服从多数，我们去放个长假吧~！<br>
<br>
「与塞壬的战争结束了，联盟合并会议也结束了」<br>
「碧蓝航线自诞生之初就是一个整体，今后也将会永远是一个整体」<br>
「由于你在这期间积攒了巨大的声望与人脉，你成为了当之无愧的当世第一人」<br>
「你拥有着无数头衔，你在世界范围内拥有着超然的地位」<br>
「但你始终只以碧蓝航线指挥官这一个身份自居」<br>
「纵使和平与发展成为了主旋律，你依然没有放松警惕」<br>
「你依然活跃在第一线」<br>
「当然，节假日除外」<br>
「你推动了天域天原项目的完善，为世界构建了一层精神上的屏障」<br>
「你推动了极地堡垒项目的完善，为世界构建了一层物理上的屏障」<br>
「从此，这个脆弱的世界拥有了全方位的保护」<br>
「远离了安蒂克丝、远离了META」<br>
「亦远离了那些更加恐怖的存在」<br>
「偶尔，你心中会浮现出些许疑惑」<br>
「你总觉得忘了些什么，总感觉故事似乎不应该是这样的结局」<br>
「但是，每当你看向这个欣欣向荣的世界，看向那些欢声笑语的同伴」<br>
「你总会强压下这最后一丝违和感」<br>
——「致这美好的世界」<br>

'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项1：果然，有哪里不对……</span>'''''<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
一定有哪里不对……<br>
<br>
我没有沉浸于美好的氛围中，而是径直离开了会场，遵循心中的那最后一丝违和感展开了调查。<br>
鸢尾教国是因何而统一，联盟合并会议是因何而召开？<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
……加冕式。<br>
……陆上神国。<br>
……马可波罗？<br>
<br>
星海基地为何如此重要，星海主机究竟是什么？<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
……银河之心。<br>
……领航员-TB！<br>
<br>
天域天原因何而故障，{namecode:91:赤城}为何在天原之中？<br>
她与神石有何关系，异常区域中究竟发生了什么？<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
奈落……奇异点……<br>
牢笼……X……海伦娜。<br>
我好像都想起来了……<br>
果然，这是一起影响全球的异常事件。而其源头……<br>
皇家，斯卡帕湾锚地。<br>
虽然已经完全看不到痕迹了，但是皇家的人工奇异点阿瓦隆之门就在这里。<br>
这场异常事件的起点也在这里……<br>
我来到斯卡帕湾参加纪念活动，本来只是伊丽莎白找的借口……我的真实目的是来找伊丽莎白·META。<br>
是海伦娜让我来皇家找她的……<br>
难道她在临行前所担心的就是现在这样的事……<br>
……<br>
<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项1：伊丽莎白·META，我需要你的帮助！</span>'''''<br>
<br>
周围的空间在顷刻间改变了——<br>
<span style="color:#ffc960;">Queen Elizabeth META：</span><br>
你的呼唤，本王听到了。<br>
好久不见，指挥官。<br>
这么多年过去了，外面的变化还真是大……<br>
怎么样，对现在这个“美好世界”还喜欢么？<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
……X的情报不存在，仲裁机关的情报不存在，奇异点的情报不存在，META的情报也不存在。<br>
这个所谓的美好世界……<br>
细想下来，不过是剔除了所有涉及世界之外的要素所构建出的沙箱罢了。<br>
继续下去的话，就算在实验场β内部能够形成一个封闭的美好世界。<br>
但终究树欲静而风不止。<br>
这份埋头于沙堆内的美好，又能持续多久呢……<br>
……等等。<br>
所以这么多年以来，你原来一直在冷眼旁观么？！<br>
<span style="color:#ffc960;">Queen Elizabeth META：</span><br>
……抱歉，本王实在是有心无力。<br>
其实，我在消散星空事件中受了很严重的伤……只是我没让伊丽莎白告诉任何人。<br>
自然，你也好，海伦娜·META也好都不知道这个情报。<br>
说实话，本王一直是有些怀疑海伦娜·META的。<br>
她……偶尔有些太偏执了。<br>
本王担心，她在知晓本王失去了制衡她的力量后，会对实验场β做些极端的事。<br>
没想到她会做出这种选择……居然将你的安危完全托付给了本王。<br>
这次是我做了狭隘的判断……险些坏了大事。<br>
当你第一次来阿瓦隆的时候，彼时的世界虽然一切正常，但我那时正处于深度昏迷的状态中。<br>
而随着时间推移，本王的身体逐渐恢复，意识逐渐清醒，直到意识到这场正在发生的异常事件后……<br>
本王却发现，实验场β已经被双重屏障所保护，变得几乎无法从外部介入了。<br>
多亏了你刚才意图明确地直接呼唤了本王之名，本王才终于找到介入的机会。<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
……双重屏障保护？<br>
……屏障是真实存在的，不是单纯的幻境么？<br>
（而且……各阵营还没开始研究物理屏障啊？）<br>
<span style="color:#ffc960;">Queen Elizabeth META：</span><br>
当然了，这些年你所经历的一切可不是幻境，而是「可能性」。<br>
彼此相互叠加，一念之间就能转变为真正现实的可能性。<br>
不然你以为为什么那么多能够凭自身意志从幻境中醒来的人，这次都无一例外地中招了。<br>
本王本来也拿不准你最后会做出何种选择……<br>
还好，你很出色，比本王预期中还要出色很多。<br>
因此，我们都算是因祸得福了。<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
……因祸得福？<br>
<span style="color:#ffc960;">Queen Elizabeth META：</span><br>
你拒绝了这份可能性，世界将重回发生分歧的那一刻。<br>
但这么多年来的经历、知识和情报可都是切实存在于你的脑海中了。<br>
你因此获得了对于可预见未来的情报优势。<br>
而本王呢，则是利用这段额外时间把伤养好了，顺便还有了一个重要发现。<br>
——指挥官，要不要去跟幕后黑手亲自对峙一下？<br>
<br>
致美好世界<br>
<br>
后日谈<br>
光芒消散后，映入眼帘的是一片璀璨星空。<br>
就像每次与海伦娜聊天时所看到的景色一样。<br>
只不过这次，星空之中漂浮着一个陌生人。<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Arbiter: The Tower XVI：</span><br>
哟~终于见面了，指挥官。<br>
如你所见，我是托瓦，「塔」的真正所有者。<br>
<br>
面对眼前这个如同人偶般的陌生少女，我的心中不知为何产生了一种熟悉的感觉。<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
（……所有人一直以来描述的“熟悉但想不起来”的感觉，我算是有了切身体会了。）<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Arbiter: The Tower XVI：</span><br>
欸~我和伊丽莎白打了个赌。<br>
如果你能凭借自己的意志拒绝我所提供的“美好世界”。<br>
我就要从幕后走出来面对你，亲自回答你的问题，以此作为你的通关奖励。<br>
现在我就在这里，相信你也积攒了不少问题——问吧，放马过来吧~<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
……仲裁者·托瓦·XVI，我真没想到幕后黑手会是你。<br>
……海伦娜最后让我立刻去找伊丽莎白·META，居然是在防你？<br>
孟菲斯她们迟迟没有跟我恢复联系……想来也是你做的吧。<br>
你不一直是海伦娜她们的盟友么，为什么要做这种事？<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Arbiter: The Tower XVI：</span><br>
呵呵~最后海伦娜让你去找伊丽莎白，不光是猜到了我要有所行动，更是希望用你把她卷入到接下来的事件中哦~<br>
毕竟在她的计划里，伊丽莎白·META可是极其重要的一环呢。<br>
可惜她没想到伊丽莎白这么靠不住，也没想到我发起的行动居然是替她的计划打了补丁。<br>
不知道这算不算你们都很喜欢的“生活中的意外之喜”呢~<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
……也就是说，只要我察觉到了异常，拒绝了那个“美好世界”的可能性，你所做的一切其实都是好事？<br>
……如果我没能拒绝呢？<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Arbiter: The Tower XVI：</span><br>
那便永远生活在美好世界中吧~远离所有活在旧日的幽灵，度过无忧无虑的幸福一生。<br>
平静而幸福的生活——这可是很多人的愿望哦，你难道不喜欢么？<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
这种假装所有风险都不存在，关起门来的幸福生活么？<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Arbiter: The Tower XVI：</span><br>
我会负责到底的哦~<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
谢谢，但是我不喜欢。<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Arbiter: The Tower XVI：</span><br>
呵呵——记住你现在的选择哦~<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
……海伦娜提到过，仲裁机关最近都在忙于「越界实验」，你不用去的么？<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Arbiter: The Tower XVI：</span><br>
仲裁机关的实验和我没关系哦~<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
……？那你能告诉我越界实验的内容么？<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Arbiter: The Tower XVI：</span><br>
嗯——不能哦~<br>
这些是“下一集”的内容了，你很快就能看到的，耐心点~<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
……那下一个问题，在这几年的“美好世界”中，我确实得到了很多知识与情报。<br>
按照伊丽莎白的说法，我获得了对于可预见未来的情报优势。<br>
你这……算是在帮我么？<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Arbiter: The Tower XVI：</span><br>
算也不算，在剪除了外部情报的“美好世界”可能性中，这些事件是必定发生的。<br>
我所做的只是筛选，而非操控。<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
那{namecode:91:赤城}是怎么回事？<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Arbiter: The Tower XVI：</span><br>
啊……她啊。<br>
理论上来说，她也应该忙于和你的约会啊，度假啊之类的……好好享受享受生活的。<br>
谁知道她太敏锐了，我也就只能先如此处理咯~<br>
这确实算是唯一一次我亲自下场所进行的干预吧。<br>
不过既然你已经干脆利落地拒绝了“美好世界”的可能性，这点小事就不用再介意了嘛~<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
……我对你的态度，有些困惑了。<br>
你到底是希望我选择你所提供的“美好世界”，还是拒绝它呢？<br>
……老实说，你为什么要做这些事？<br>
我不要听你的目的，我想听你的想法。<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Arbiter: The Tower XVI：</span><br>
……<br>
龙猫丢了，难过。<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
……啊？<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Arbiter: The Tower XVI：</span><br>
呵呵~开个玩笑。<br>
其实是看得久了，总想下场导演一下嘛~<br>
亲自验证一些事，改变一些事。<br>
是啊，原本是可以没有这么一段的，我可以什么都不做，稳稳留在观影席上。<br>
就这样看着接下来的尸横遍野，血流成河。<br>
当然，我不讨厌血流成河哦~<br>
只是我认为，“下一集”不应该以这样的悲剧收尾，仅此而已。<br>
啊——这场番外篇的评分你就不必说了哦。<br>
我已经深刻理解到了资深影评人和亲自导演之间的区别……<br>
果然，我还是不适合做这些事啊~以后不做了！不做了！<br>
至于你嘛，回去之后先休息一下，然后准备前往“下一集”的片场吧~<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
……你从刚才起就一直提到的“下一集”究竟是什么？<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Arbiter: The Tower XVI：</span><br>
那当然是在“下一集”播出的时候你就知道啦~<br>
回去之后——记得关注星海方面的消息哦~<br>
奖励环节到此结束，我们有缘再见~！<br>
<br>
——未完待续<br>
