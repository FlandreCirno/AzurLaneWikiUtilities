Owing to Elizabeth's efficient orders, I'd been assigned a mission to attend a commemorative naval review with the Royal Navy before my private plane had even landed in the Orthodoxy.<br>
As such, my plane stopped only for a quick refueling before heading to the Royal Islands – to Scapa Flow, where Elizabeth had been staying for long. It was even starting to become a second administrative center.<br>
Royal Islands - Scapa Flow Anchorage<br>
Gate of Avalon<br>
Reception Area<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Miss D：</span><br>
Assistant! You've finally come to play with me!<br>
<br>
A girl with a stuffed whale in her arms flies at me as soon as I enter the reception room.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Oh, you don't need to be around the whale anymore? What happened to Death's Shadow?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Miss D：</span><br>
Heheh! She's gone off to somewhere! I don't have to deal with her anymore!<br>
That means I can go anywhere now!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Queen Elizabeth：</span><br>
Anywhere as long as it's within range of the Gate, that is.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Miss D：</span><br>
Hmph! Only because Elizabeth META won't let me go outside! She's a butthead!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Vanguard：</span><br>
You'd be in a lot of trouble if she heard that, young lady.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Miss D：</span><br>
Yeah, well, screw her!<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Elizabeth, Vanguard. Good to see you again.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Queen Elizabeth：</span><br>
The same to you, servant. Take a seat. You came just in time for tea. Let's wet our whistles and have a chat, shall we?<br>
<br>
I savor a cup of tea while admiring the beautiful garden. Time slips away in this leisurely atmosphere.<br>
I tell Elizabeth about what unfolded in Sky Realm Amahara, as well as what Helena META told me. She falls silent for a while, looking like she's brooding over something.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Queen Elizabeth：</span><br>
Yes. She does have a point – since she's no longer here, this is the safest place in the world.<br>
It's clear that she's afraid of something, however. Some kind of danger that would come for you as soon as she left, or something of that nature.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Honestly, I have no idea either. I'd like to ask the META Elizabeth about it.<br>
Would it be possible to get some time with her?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Queen Elizabeth：</span><br>
Well, she's currently in the middle of upgrading Avalon's navigation system, you see.<br>
Due to some unique circumstances, even I'm unable to get in direct contact with her.<br>
Fortunately, we do share news once every three days. Our next scheduled contact is actually tomorrow at noon, so I could bring you along then.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
That's great. I guess I'll be staying here until then.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Queen Elizabeth：</span><br>
But of course. You ought to stay under my protection until the danger has passed.<br>
Bel, bring us something good to eat.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Belfast：</span><br>
Certainly, Your Majesty.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
(Considering how much Helena stressed her point, something seems bound to happen.)<br>
(She was in such a rush that day that she might not have had time to share intel with Memphis and the rest.)<br>
(Even so, it's been several days now. Why hasn't anyone tried to contact me?)<br>
(I'd contact them if I could, but I have no way to do it.)<br>
(I feel so powerless, having no choice but to wait...)<br>
<br>
Royal Islands - Gate of Avalon<br>
Commander's Break Room<br>
Late at Night<br>
Before I go to sleep, I receive a message from Memphis.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Memphis：</span><br>
Heheh. I'm not in the Orthodoxy's capital anymore, Commander. Can you guess where I am?<br>
I'll let you in on a secret. I made a crazy discovery just a while ago.<br>
If you're lucky, you might receive a surprise in not too long!<br>
Keep an eye out for it!<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
That's... awfully mysterious of her.<br>
"Surprise," she says. What kind of surprise? Hope it's a good one.<br>
<br>
Somewhere, in an unknown location...<br>
As the light fades, a bright campus landscape fills my view.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
What the...?<br>
I should be asleep at the Gate of Avalon... Did I end up here as I was dreaming? Sure hope Elizabeth META's defenses weren't breached...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">？？：</span><br>
Hi.<br>
<br>
Suddenly, I realize there's a girl wearing a white dress in front of me.<br>
Her presence feels so natural, almost like she's been standing here the whole time.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Who are you? Haven't we met before?<br>
Where's Lady E? Is she here?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">？？：</span><br>
On vacation.<br>
<br>
The girl in the dress suddenly appears under a tree in the distance, then one blink of an eye later, she appears under another tree further away.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Are you telling me to follow you?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">？？：</span><br>
......<br>
<br>
Without a word, the girl quickly moves between the trees.<br>
Following her trail of afterimages, I run around the campus.<br>
As I go deeper, a single thought emerges from the back of my mind.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Are you trying to lead me to someone?<br>
Someone other than Lady E?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">？？：</span><br>
Hurry.<br>
<br>
She suddenly moves a lot faster. I pick up the pace to keep up with her.<br>
Then, as I turn a corner...<br>
The world is instantly repainted a white color. The girl, the school, and everything else vanish.<br>

To a Brighter World<br>
<br>
2 Act One<br>
I open my eyes to the morning sunshine and an unfamiliar ceiling.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
...Talk about a big room.<br>
Is this... where I fell asleep last night?<br>
No. Something's not right.<br>
<br>
I get dressed and leave the room. Charybdis from the Royal Maids is already there outside the door, waiting for me.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Charybdis：</span><br>
Good morning, Master. I hope that your night at the castle was most pleasant.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Figures. I'm in a castle. Though, I'm pretty sure I went to bed at Av–<br>
<br>
The words get stuck in my throat, and my train of thought halts.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Did I... spend the night here?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Charybdis：</span><br>
That is correct.<br>
Your confusion is understandable. It was a busy day for you, with the naval review in the morning and a spontaneous mock night battle with Her Majesty.<br>
Please follow me. Her Majesty awaits you for breakfast in the courtyard.<br>
<br>
Charybdis brings me out to the courtyard. When we arrive, Belfast and the Royal Maids have just finished preparing breakfast.<br>
There is a long table set up on the green lawn, at which Elizabeth, Vanguard, Monarch, as well as Illustrious and her sister sit.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Queen Elizabeth：</span><br>
Good morning, servant.<br>
Don't just stand there! Come, sit. I reserved this seat just for you.<br>
<br>
Despite being surrounded by smiles, I get an odd sense that something isn't quite right.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
(A short girl carrying around a stuffed animal... Why do I feel like someone matching that description is missing?)<br>
(Stuffed animal... A stuffed whale?)<br>
Elizabeth, did I bring up anything about a whale yesterday?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Queen Elizabeth：</span><br>
A whale? Ladies, do you remember anything?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Illustrious：</span><br>
Hmm... No, I'm afraid I don't remember such a thing. Why do you ask, Commander? Would you like to see a whale?<br>
We don't have any large aquariums at Scapa Flow, sadly. Perhaps at LD Harbour?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Victorious：</span><br>
Seeing one in its natural habitat would be quite lovely, too!<br>
Although, it would take a while to find one. Are you planning on staying here for an extended time, Commander?<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
(Yeah. I would like to see a whale. But... not in that way, exactly?)<br>

To a Brighter World<br>
<br>
3 Act Two<br>
After I finished all my business in the Royal Islands, Elizabeth gave me an ardent vacation offer, which I politely declined.<br>
Then, without a minute to rest, I headed to my next destination – the Sea of Stars.<br>
The very moment I set foot on the base, the mood feels strangely off to me.<br>
Every single person I pass looks at me with a smile concealing something deeper, and once I leave their sight, I hear them whisper something among each other.<br>
Memphis spoke of a surprise. Now I'm here, on a sudden visit to the Sea of Stars. The dots connect in my head.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
(...Oh my god!)<br>
<br>
With my heart beating out of my chest, I walk faster, passing through several wards. Then, finally...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Sea of Stars Main System：</span><br>
Identity verified. Welcome, Commander.<br>
<br>
This is the sickroom where Lexington's care pod was housed. It's supposed to be here, and yet...<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
It's gone...<br>
......<br>
<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项1：Lexington... Are you there?</span>'''''<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">???：</span><br>
I'm glad you came, Commander.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Huh?!<br>
Is... Is that really you?! You've finally woken up! Are you feeling okay?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">???：</span><br>
Of course! I've made a full recovery thanks to the hard work Sara put in day after day.<br>
The next time you see her, be sure to praise her for doing such a good job.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
(Huh? Where...)<br>
Where are you? Why can't I see you?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">???：</span><br>
Why, I'm hiding to create a sense of mystery and make it more of a surprise.<br>
Why don't you look for me, hmm?<br>
<br>
I look around the room. The cold medical equipment and the care pod have all been put away.<br>
In their place, there is a bed with soft sheets and pillows, a large closet, and a few couches and furnishings. The place feels lived in.<br>
If she's hiding in here, the best place to look would be...<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Wait... "Look for me"?<br>
...It's YOU, Saratoga!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Saratoga：</span><br>
Teehee! No surprise you figured it out so quickly!<br>
Whoa! Hey, don't be mad! Take it easy!<br>
I just wanted to lift the mood in this place a bit, you know? Plus, this surprise isn't for you – it's for Lex as well.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Okay... So Lexington really did make it?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Saratoga：</span><br>
Yep! I was just having a little bit of fun with you. I wouldn't go THAT far, you know.<br>
I mean, listen. Do you hear that?<br>
<br>
I listen closely, and I hear a pair of voices from the hallway, drawing closer.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Memphis：</span><br>
I saw all your test results came back looking great. What a relief!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Lexington：</span><br>
Why, of course. I know my body better than anyone else.<br>
If Sara weren't such a worrywart, I think I'd have gotten a discharge yesterday.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Memphis：</span><br>
Ahaha... It wasn't just her – we've ALL been worried. Remember, don't assume things and be careful.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Lexington：</span><br>
Sure, but some of the things they tested for today were a bit... odd, it felt like.<br>
It feels like I'm being kept in the dark. Are you and Sara planning something?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Memphis：</span><br>
Ahaha... Well, the thing is...<br>
Oh! Lex! You've got a guest!<br>
Go on. Open the door and see for yourself!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Sea of Stars Main System：</span><br>
Identity verified. Welcome, Lexington and Memphis.<br>
<br>
With an automated announcement, the door silently opens.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Lexington：</span><br>
Huh?!<br>
<br>
Lexington stands at the entrance to the room. There is nothing standing between us now.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
......<br>
<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项1：Welcome back, Lexington.</span>'''''<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Lexington：</span><br>
I'm glad to be back, {playername} – my Commander.<br>
<br>
This was certainly a surprise by any meaning of the word. A pure, massive, and unexpected surprise.<br>
So much so that when Lexington was reprimanding Saratoga for her prank, I couldn't help but tell her to let it go.<br>
As Saratoga went on to explain, it was a series of recent technological breakthroughs at the Sea of Stars that made Lexington's recovery possible.<br>
In the back of my mind, I felt a little doubt and a dash of discomfort about these breakthroughs...<br>
However, those were unimportant compared to what really mattered.<br>
That Lexington was back with us.<br>

<br>
4 Act Three<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Enterprise：</span><br>
We have located all of the Sirens' hidden test sites across the Pacific.<br>
Now it is time to clear them out in one fell swoop and restore peace to this ocean.<br>
Commander, welcome to PH Harbor.<br>
I hereby cede command over the Pacific theater to you. Lead us to victory.<br>
<br>
There are operations taking place across the world to eliminate the remnants of the Sirens.<br>
Among all the regions, the one with the largest remnant force is the Pacific Ocean.<br>
It's for that reason that I've returned to PH Harbor to resume a duty that I haven't performed in a long time – that of a fleet commander.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Bayard：</span><br>
Tester once ruled over this ocean, and now there remains no sign of her.<br>
What few test sites remain will stand no chance against us.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Sovetskaya Rossiya：</span><br>
Precisely. Thanks to the Commander uniting our various factions with different goals, we're able to work together and destroy one mainframe after another.<br>
The first light of daybreak now shines upon us.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Zuikaku：</span><br>
Commander, you have the full cooperation of the Sakura Empire's fleets and regional bases!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Chien Wu：</span><br>
Heehee. United we stand, and step by step do we advance. Together, we will fully reclaim the Pacific.<br>
<br>
Later that night...<br>
During my voyage with the fleet, I had something I hadn't experienced in a while – a dream.<br>
A figure draped in red was running through a field of dark clouds.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Akagi：</span><br>
Commander! Commandeeer!<br>
<br>
She was cradling the Watatsumi, a faint light emitting from her body.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Akagi：</span><br>
Commander, you must return to Amahara at once! I have something I need to tell you!<br>
<br>
Her expression was contorted with panic, like something was chasing her from behind.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Akagi：</span><br>
Please... Please make haste!<br>
<br>
Pure white enveloped the world in an instant. Akagi, the dark clouds, and everything else were gone.<br>

<br>
To a Brighter World<br>
<br>
5 Act Four<br>
Based on prior experience, I can't dismiss this as just another dream, given that Akagi and the Watatsumi were involved.<br>
And so, I decide to adjust the fleet's course toward the Sakura Empire under the pretense of inquiring about the state of Amahara's reconstruction.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Asama：</span><br>
Commander, whilst we did experience some rather disagreeable malfunctions, the Venerable Three have already reconstructed the dubitable areas.<br>
Amahara is now, for all intents and purposes, free of concealed dangers.<br>
At present, we are making efforts to further bolster the barriers' mentally stabilizing effects, as well as putting into practice a plan to expand the Five Provinces and Seven Districts.<br>
As a positive side effect, all within the range of Amahara's grace have additionally reported a notably improved quality of sleep.<br>
<br>
From what I heard, it sounded like the Amahara Project had finally gotten on the right track.<br>
After an exchange of technological progress, I decided to visit Akagi's residence by myself.<br>
However, once I arrive, I'm instead greeted by an unexpected character.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Hakuhou：</span><br>
A pleasure it is to see you again, Commander. Do you have any business with Akagi?<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
...Hakuhou? Yeah, I wanna talk to her.<br>
She apparently had something to tell me. Can I see her?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Hakuhou：</span><br>
My apologies. Akagi is... not in a state fit for conversation at the moment.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
What do you mean?<br>
<br>
An unpleasant feeling crawls into my mind.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Hakuhou：</span><br>
You see, a few days ago, Akagi took the Watatsumi without our permission.<br>
Once we understood what had happened, we discovered her fast asleep in her own room.<br>
Miss Yamato speculates that Akagi had used the Watatsumi to perform some kind of ritual. This ritual is believed to have failed and caused some damage to her psyche.<br>
While it doesn't appear to be severe, only the heavens know when she might wake up again.<br>
Perhaps as little as a few months. Perhaps as much as a few years...<br>
<br>
The creeping feeling I had was right.<br>
I asked Hakuhou to lead me to where Akagi is.<br>
There she lies on the bed, a look of calm restfulness on her face. She's in a deep slumber.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
(This reminds me a lot of Marco– Wait, who?)<br>
<br>
A thought crosses my mind, only to instantly vanish like it went up in smoke.<br>
Akagi has reliable people like Yamato at her side. I don't need to be too worried about her.<br>
If only I could know when she'll wake up, and what she was trying to tell me in that dream.<br>
After leaving Amahara behind, I suddenly receive a message from Veneto.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Vittorio Veneto：</span><br>
Greetings and salutations, Commander.<br>
I've been informed that the fleet you're leading across the Pacific Ocean has enjoyed victory after victory, and I wish to congratulate you.<br>
Should circumstances permit it, once your campaign there is over, could you offer your aid to the Mediterranean Sea?<br>
As you are aware, the situation here is exceedingly complicated, and the Sirens' lingering forces are powerful indeed.<br>
The greatest help we could ask for is if you were to personally take command in our battles.<br>
I sincerely hope to hear back from you soon.<br>
Also, I look forward to a chance to personally speak to you about a vacation in– Pardon, I meant, "Speak to you about our campaign."<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
...She just said "vacation," didn't she?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Memphis：</span><br>
"As you are aware," the enemy they're fighting is "powerful indeed."<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Helena：</span><br>
She doesn't sound the least bit convincing.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Memphis：</span><br>
That said, the reports I've read from the front over the past few days say the enemy is way weaker than anticipated.<br>
If they stay that way, then we'll fully wrap up the Pacific campaign within this month.<br>
And if we do, wouldn't it be nice to go to the Mediterranean?<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
The Mediterranean...<br>
<br>
Our next target after the Pacific is supposed to be the Atlantic.<br>
On the other hand, the storm at the heart of it has calmed down, making that front rather stable.<br>
Beyond that, there's also the South Pacific and the Mediterranean. It doesn't matter much which one we pick.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Memphis：</span><br>
Then let's go to the Mediterranean! Veneto's already asked for help, so the situation must be pretty dire, right?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Helena：</span><br>
That's true. What do you say, Commander?<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
(They've got "Please! Let's go there!" written all over their faces...)<br>
Alright. The Mediterranean is our next objective.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Memphis：</span><br>
Sweet!<br>
<br>
Sky Realm Amahara - ???<br>
After Amahara regained its calm, the woman lying in bed opened her eyes.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Akagi：</span><br>
The Commander has left...<br>
This time, it was I who broke a promise between us...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ikazuchi：</span><br>
"Your meeting was not to be. Bide your time."<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Inazuma：</span><br>
"All outside interference has gone. You are the one thing remaining."<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ikazuchi：</span><br>
"By which I mean – you are the final anomaly."<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Inazuma：</span><br>
"Were it discovered, it shall be amended."<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ikazuchi：</span><br>
"Thus shall this world's system achieve self-congruency."<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Inazuma：</span><br>
"The Commander shan't awaken again."<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Akagi：</span><br>
Urgh...<br>
Please, Commander... Don't let those bright possibilities carry you away...<br>
<br>
After softly sighing out her plight, Akagi quietly closed her eyes again, sinking back into her deep sleep.<br>

To a Brighter World<br>
<br>
6 Act Five<br>
By the end of the month, the Pacific campaign had concluded as expected, and I made my way to the Sardegna Empire.<br>
After a series of formal events, it was finally time to convene a military conference to get things on track...<br>
That is, until I learned a shocking fact – the Sardegna Empire hadn't even begun amassing its fleet.<br>
I was somewhat braced for this, but seeing it with my own eyes, I couldn't help but sigh.<br>
With little option left but to stay for a few days longer, I decided to enjoy the beautiful sights around the capital.<br>
Today, Memphis, Helena, and I have come to the Grand Cathedral Museum, the most famous of its kind in Rome.<br>
In line with its name, its interior is absolutely stunning.<br>
Helena appears fascinated with the many sculptures in the animal hall.<br>
Memphis, meanwhile, looks around at the paintings in the art gallery.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Memphis：</span><br>
This place has an interesting layout.<br>
This place, too... It's got a lot of history, and these buildings are massive.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
(I hope she hasn't confused that antique map of Sardegna for some kind of tourist map.)<br>
(Ancient castles, old maps... It feels like I'm forgetting something.)<br>
(Oh, right! Ever since I got here, it's felt like another important person should be here...)<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Littorio：</span><br>
Hahaha! Commander! I take it the Museum is to your liking?<br>
<br>
Just as I sink deep into thought, a buoyant voice rings out in my ear.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Yeah. This place has earned its reputation. It's well worth the visit.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Littorio：</span><br>
I'm glad to hear it.<br>
As it so happens, our fleets have finished amassing and our flagship has arrived in Rome. I've heard we can convene the conference shortly.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
At long last. How about–<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Littorio：</span><br>
One more thing. Veneto and I would like to host the conference tomorrow morning. Is that fine with you?<br>
Ah, seems the Museum is about to close. Why don't we go and spend the rest of the day sightseeing?<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Alright. Sounds like a plan.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Littorio：</span><br>
Heh – it's not like you could cover the whole Museum in a single day anyway.<br>
If you feel like visiting again, do give me a call.<br>
I'd be glad to show you around not just the Museum, but the spectacles around all of Sardegna.<br>
We have ample time, and there's no shortage of things to see in our country.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
(She's totally in vacation mode...)<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Memphis：</span><br>
Okay, then could you show us around the old town of Florence?<br>
Oh, and the Lighthouse of Genoa! I wanna see that!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Littorio：</span><br>
I would love to, Signorina! Incidentally, I saw you passionately eyeing that mural a minute ago...<br>
Searching for places to visit, were we? Ah, such a brilliant mind you have!<br>
Florence and Genoa are splendid places, of course, but I also strongly recommend you pay a visit to the aquatic city that is Venice!<br>
<br>
As the topic changes to vacation destinations, Memphis and Littorio suddenly find a wide array of things to talk about.<br>
Based on the intel I've gathered over the past days, the Siren force situated in the Mediterranean is – as previously thought – the weakest among all the theaters.<br>
Four groups have jointly undertaken the task of sweeping them up – the Royal Navy, the Iris Orthodoxy, Iron Blood, and the Sardegna Empire.<br>
Iron Blood's fleet is being led by Bismarck, while Richelieu commands the Orthodoxy's force.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
(The Sirens' fates are practically sealed already.)<br>
(Looks like my stay in the Sardegna Empire will be a leisurely vacation after all.)<br>

To a Brighter World<br>
<br>
7 Act Six<br>
During my stay in Sardegna, I received status updates from all the various fronts.<br>
The remaining Siren forces in the Antarctic Ocean, the Pacific Ocean, the South Pacific Ocean, the Atlantic Ocean, and the Arctic Ocean have all been eliminated.<br>
Reports of victory have also come in from the Great Lakes, the Caspian Sea, the Dead Sea, Lake Baikal, Lake Victoria, and many other inland bodies of water.<br>
As I'm compiling all of this news into one report, something suddenly dawns on me – we've reached a juncture that will go down in human history.<br>
At this point in time, all the Siren stragglers on the planet have been completely eliminated.<br>
After fighting the Sirens for so many years, we have finally achieved a complete victory over them.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Once this news gets public, the whole world will rejoice in celebration...<br>
<br>
While going through battle reports from across the world, an unexpected notice from the Northern Parliament reaches me.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Sovetsky Soyuz：</span><br>
Comrade Commander, based on the Siren data we recovered, we have discovered enormous, perfectly-preserved Siren facilities at the North and South Poles, one in each.<br>
We, the Northern Parliament, have been studying polar magnetism trajectories occurring during geomagnetic reversals.<br>
It is our belief that these newly discovered facilities are the cause of the planet's magnetic trajectory anomalies.<br>
It's believed the Sirens used these facilities to manipulate our poles, intentionally aligning our geographic poles with our geomagnetic ones.<br>
As for why they did something like this, we don't yet know.<br>
However, based on other data, we learned about a huge risk associated with the sun entering a period of activity.<br>
Under certain circumstances, the energy particle flow found in solar winds can interact with space-time itself, causing a series of time-space anomalies with anything in their path.<br>
This can create an array of Singularities that, while unstable, short-lived, and coming in various sizes, are most certainly still Singularities.<br>
The Sirens refer to this phenomenon as an "Intertwined Storm."<br>
In addition, the Sirens possessed a technology that could create a unique protective layer outside our planet by manipulating our stable geomagnetism.<br>
To use an analogy, if the Sakura Empire's Sky Realm Amahara was an attempt to construct a mental barrier, then this Siren technology was an attempt to construct a physical barrier.<br>
We don't yet understand the connection between this technology and the facilities at the poles, or the Singularities created in outer space and the unique protective layer.<br>
Even so, we believe these are monumental discoveries. We hope to put further resources toward thoroughly studying them.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
She's right. This is a colossal discovery.<br>
A physical barrier and a mental one... Couldn't you create a shield that perfectly envelops the world if you combined them?<br>
All world factions need to get involved in this. We need to thoroughly research these things.<br>

To a Brighter World<br>
<br>
Act Seven<br>
Finally, the day the world had been waiting for has come.<br>
Each and every chair in the assembly hall is filled today.<br>
This long journey of conference after conference is almost finally at its end.<br>
All the confrontations, all the mutual prodding, all the compromises – this moment spells the end for all of it.<br>
It is not at the Azur Lane headquarters, but here, where the reformation talks first took place, that the curtains historically fall on an era.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Lexington：</span><br>
The Sirens. Our enigmatic foes that appeared out of nowhere and seized our seas with overwhelming force.<br>
At the start of this unprecedented calamity, we each had our own agendas and fought our own battles.<br>
The result of this was almost too painful to bear.<br>
We lost 90% of our seas. Our technological progress and living standards rapidly regressed. Civilization itself stood at the very brink of collapse.<br>
However, we survived, and we did it by burying old hatchets, uniting our hearts as one, and establishing the multinational military organization that is the Azur Lane.<br>
We shared our resources and technology, and we built fleets that could fight back against the Sirens.<br>
As a result, we seized victory.<br>
After a bloody war that has gone on for decades, "Azur Lane" no longer just refers to a military alliance.<br>
It has become a symbol. A symbol of fracture becoming unification, of despair becoming hope, of humanity overcoming old hardships and stepping into a new future.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Bismarck Zwei：</span><br>
The Azur Lane. It was born in the darkest period in human history.<br>
As we dreamed of a hopeful future, we struggled day after day, straddling the line between life and death.<br>
Faced with the Sirens' immense pressure, we all felt hesitant and lost...<br>
At first, maybe it was nothing more than a slight difference of opinion or a conflict of ideas.<br>
But, as time went on, those small cracks quietly connected and spread until they'd grown into an enormous rift that could neither be ignored nor be filled.<br>
It was this moment that the Azur Lane fell apart.<br>
It was a time of chaos.<br>
Our information was limited, our suspicions were intensified, and our ambitions were enlarged. Cleverly, the Sirens schemed to divide us.<br>
Trapped in this dark storm, we all made decisions that were incorrect.<br>
As fortune would have it, though, the little fire lit in our hearts when the Azur Lane was established had not gone out.<br>
None of us gave up. No one turned their back on the flame of hope.<br>
This fire, eventually, thawed the ice of separation, and its light dispelled the long, dark fog.<br>
We all share the same goal. Therefore, we should arrive at the same destination through different paths.<br>
The appearance of the Sirens brought human civilization to a new stage, and the establishment of the Azur Lane set the tone for this new era.<br>
The Crimson Axis, meanwhile, played a resounding and different instrument within this main melody.<br>
Now, however, this instrument has played its last note.<br>
As of today, the Crimson Axis belongs to history.<br>
Let us raise the banner of unity, hold our heads high, and walk proudly into the future.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Lexington：</span><br>
Two paths have now become one.<br>
A once-fractured alliance has again become whole.<br>
Just because we have achieved victory over the Sirens does not mean that the Azur Lane, built to combat them, has finished serving its purpose.<br>
In fact, it means the opposite. The Azur Lane is going to become an even more important organization.<br>
This time, it was the Sirens that invaded us. We defeated them.<br>
So, then, what happens next?<br>
There is no knowing if the universe beyond our world is safe.<br>
There is only one thing we can do: Unite, stand together, and move forward as one group.<br>
Under the banner of the Azur Lane shall we step into the uncertain future ahead of us.<br>
<br>
Lexington and Bismarck's speech comes to an end.<br>
The world is silent. It's waiting for me to speak next.<br>
A bright world unfolds before me. All I need to do is take one step forward.<br>
One step forward onto the stage. As the one who made the alliance reformation happen. As the one who led humanity to victory. As the Commander of the Azur Lane...<br>
To etch the perfect ending into this story.<br>
"Is it meant to be this way?"<br>
<br>
<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项1：It is...</span>'''''<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Yes... This is how it's meant to be.<br>
<br>
I let go of my doubts, yield myself to the celebration and joy, and become one with this brighter world.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Lexington：</span><br>
Commander, the greatest accolade of reuniting the fractured Azur Lane absolutely belongs to you.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Saratoga：</span><br>
It's the mother of all achievements! I could never even have dreamed this day would come!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Yorktown II：</span><br>
The Sirens are defeated, and the world is united. Now, we can all start planning our vacation!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Enterprise：</span><br>
A vacation, eh... Where do you wanna go, Commander?<br>
Wherever you go, I'll come with you.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">New Jersey：</span><br>
Yeah! What she said, honey!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Queen Elizabeth：</span><br>
To think you actually went and did it...<br>
Hats off to you, servant. History will never forget your name.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">King George V：</span><br>
You are responsible for miracle after miracle. A true legend.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Hood：</span><br>
Commander, whilst the war may be over, know that the Royal Navy shall always be your close ally.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Illustrious：</span><br>
May the light forever shine upon you.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Bismarck Zwei：</span><br>
What a long day it's been.<br>
We've trudged through many a swamp and suffered many an injury for this day.<br>
Still, our efforts were all repaid. A new era begins here and now.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Prinz Eugen：</span><br>
Heehee. You shine like the light itself up on the stage. I'm almost swooning over here.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Richelieu：</span><br>
This was a spectacular feat, accomplished with the Iris' blessing. Congratulations, Commander.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Clemenceau：</span><br>
Now, the last sounds of opposition to the Orthodoxy's reformation have finally dispersed.<br>
I'm honored to have lived in the same era as you, Commander.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Amagi(CV)：</span><br>
With this, the Sakura Empire will return as a member of the Azur Lane and stand under its flag.<br>
I eagerly look forward to cooperating with you, Commander.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Nagato：</span><br>
Such a simple task this seemed. To one's surprise, attempting it in practice proved far more vexatious.<br>
Even so, it was achieved in the end. I can hence fully dedicate myself to my coming duties.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Mikasa：</span><br>
Hahaha! That I get to see this grand a feat of diplomacy a second time is nothing short of outstanding!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Unzen：</span><br>
{playername}, whatever the future may have in store for us, I shall be your ally now and always.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Sovetsky Soyuz：</span><br>
I knew you'd be able to do it. Congratulations to you, Comrade Commander.<br>
Well, although the world is at peace again, there is still much work to be done.<br>
In the coming days, I intend to submit a research plan for the Siren facilities located in both of the Poles. They will be something that warrants the cooperation and research of all Azur Lane members.<br>
When that time comes, I trust we will have your help, Comrade Commander.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Avrora：</span><br>
Heehee. "Those with great capabilities are given greater responsibilities" holds true.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Kirov：</span><br>
Worry not, Comrade Commander! We will always be there to help you!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Vittorio Veneto：</span><br>
That was a perfect speech. My heart shook from how splendid it was.<br>
I wish this grand announcement could've been given in the Sardegna Empire instead, but alas. Heehee. The Orthodoxy is truly blessed.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Littorio：</span><br>
Ahahaha! We're now members of the Azur Lane once more. Nothing could be more joyous!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Andrea Doria：</span><br>
I never thought I'd see the day that the alliance became united again. Thank you, Commander.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Impero：</span><br>
But of course. The Commander's magnificence is natural, inevitable, and absolute.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Gouden Leeuw：</span><br>
Heheh. We can say goodbye to the days of having to explain to whom the Kingdom of Tulipa answers.<br>
And it's all thanks to you, respected Commander and benefactor of our fleet!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Yat Sen：</span><br>
All of us have put aside our squabbles and become one under the same banner...<br>
This, to civilization, is what true victory means.<br>
The Dragon Empery eagerly looks forward to the great heights human civilization will reach in the future – and so do I.<br>
The Empery will forever be your ally, Commander.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Memphis：</span><br>
Whew, yes! The Azur Lane is finally back together! We don't have to debate it anymore!<br>
Commander, Helena – we're all finally free!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Helena：</span><br>
I wasn't fully satisfied with our last trip, sooo... how about we take a little vacation before our next mission?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Memphis：</span><br>
Couldn't agree more!<br>
Commander, if you agree, then it's three to zero, and if you don't, it's still two to one.<br>
The minority has to obey the majority, which means we're going on a looong vacation!<br>
<br>
"The war with the Sirens had ended, as had the meetings to discuss the Azur Lane's reformation."<br>
"The Azur Lane was whole since its moment of inception, and would stay whole forevermore."<br>
"The prestige and connections you've accumulated have made you the undisputed number one of this era."<br>
"You are the holder of countless titles and command an unquestionable status across the world."<br>
"Yet, there is but one title that you use – the Commander of the Azur Lane."<br>
"Even as the world pivoted to peace and development, you never once let your guard down."<br>
"Wherever the front line was, you would always be there."<br>
"Excluding holidays, of course."<br>
"You pushed the Sky Realm Amahara Project forward, constructing a mental barrier around the world."<br>
"You also advanced the Polar Bunker Projects, supplementing the mental barrier with a physical one."<br>
"Thus, this fragile and transient world was bestowed a flawless defense."<br>
"A defense against Antiochus and the METAs alike."<br>
"It was also protected against those even more frightful beings."<br>
"Despite all this, something in the back of your mind nagged at you from time to time."<br>
"You felt like you had forgotten something – like your story should have ended differently."<br>
"But when you looked around you, seeing your companions smiling widely, and the world regaining its life."<br>
"In light of such a sight, you pushed those misgivings back into the depths of your mind."<br>

'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项1：Something's not right...</span>'''''<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
No. Something's not right.<br>
<br>
Rather than give in to the celebratory mood, I trust the faint nagging feeling in the back of my mind and leave the venue to find the truth.<br>
How did the Iris Orthodoxy unify? Why were the Azur Lane reformation meetings held?<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
...The coronation ceremony.<br>
...The Kingdom of God.<br>
...Marco Polo?<br>
<br>
Why is the Sea of Stars such an important base? Who is the beating heart of its central system?<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
...The Galactic Core.<br>
...TB!<br>
<br>
Why did Amahara malfunction? Why was Akagi there?<br>
What's her connection to the Watatsumi? What happened in the anomalous area?<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Naraka... The Singularity...<br>
The prison... The X... Helena...<br>
I remember it... Everything.<br>
That's it. This abnormal phenomenon is affecting the whole world. And its source is located in...<br>
Scapa Flow in the Royal Islands.<br>
Even though there's not a single trace left, I know that the Royal Navy had an artificial Singularity here. The Gate of Avalon.<br>
That's where this all began, too.<br>
I went here to attend a commemoration. Of course, that was just an excuse Elizabeth came up with. My real goal was to speak with the META Elizabeth.<br>
Helena sent me here to do that, and...<br>
My god... Is this exactly what she feared would happen?<br>
......<br>
<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项1：Elizabeth META, I need your help.</span>'''''<br>
<br>
The surrounding space changes in an instant.<br>
<span style="color:#ffc960;">Queen Elizabeth META：</span><br>
We heard your call loud and clear.<br>
We meet again, servant.<br>
Goodness. The outside world certainly has undergone a drastic change.<br>
So, tell us – how do you like this "brighter world"?<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
...There's nothing pertaining to the X. Nothing about the Arbiters, Singularities, or METAs either.<br>
At a glance, it is a brighter world...<br>
But upon closer inspection, it's merely a sandbox created by removing all elements from outside the world itself.<br>
Even if you could create such an isolated world within test site beta, it wouldn't hold up.<br>
The winds outside of it would keep raging regardless.<br>
We can blissfully bury our heads in the sand, but for how long?<br>
Wait a second...<br>
Have you been watching me this entire time?!<br>
<span style="color:#ffc960;">Queen Elizabeth META：</span><br>
Forgive us. There was naught that we could do.<br>
We suffered severe wounds from the Day the Stars Faded, and urged Elizabeth not to tell anyone of it.<br>
Naturally, you and Helena META didn't know, either.<br>
Speaking of her, though – frankly, we've always been cautious of her.<br>
She has exhibited a... dangerous level of attachment to you at times.<br>
We fear that if she comes to learn that we have lost the ability to restrain her, she may do something extreme to test site beta.<br>
God knows what goes through her mind... She actually entrusted your well-being wholly to us.<br>
We were craven this time... It almost cost us everything as a result.<br>
When you first visited Avalon, the world appeared perfectly normal – however, we were still in a deep coma at the time.<br>
By the time we'd started slowly recollecting ourselves, this absurd abnormality had already developed.<br>
It wasn't long before test site beta itself was enveloped in a two-tiered barrier, preventing practically all outside interference.<br>
But, when you called our name just now, it finally allowed us an opening to intervene.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Wait... A two-tiered barrier?<br>
Those are real? I thought they were just part of the illusion.<br>
(Hang on... We hadn't even begun researching the physical barrier yet, had we?)<br>
<span style="color:#ffc960;">Queen Elizabeth META：</span><br>
Indeed they are. What you experienced was not a fantasy, but rather a possibility.<br>
With but a single thought, a possibility can transform into reality.<br>
Were that not the case, how do you explain how you couldn't escape this incident on your own, even though many others have done so before?<br>
To be frank, we weren't certain that you'd make the correct choice...<br>
Fortunately, you did. You've proven more outstanding than we could've imagined.<br>
One might even say that you've turned a disaster into a miracle.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
A miracle?<br>
<span style="color:#ffc960;">Queen Elizabeth META：</span><br>
Yes. By rejecting this possibility, you've restored the world to its point of divergence.<br>
Despite that, all the experience, knowledge, and information you gained during that time remain inside you.<br>
In other words, you now possess a staggering informational advantage with regard to the foreseeable future.<br>
As for ourselves, we used this surplus of time to heal our injuries. While at it, we also made an important discovery.<br>
Would you like to meet the string-puller responsible for all this? Then come with us.<br>
<br>
To a Brighter World<br>
<br>
Addendum<br>
As the light fades, an ocean of twinkling stars comes into view.<br>
It looks a lot like the view of space I'd see when communicating with Helena.<br>
Only with one major difference – there's a stranger floating among the stars.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Arbiter: The Tower XVI：</span><br>
We meet at last, Commander.<br>
As you can see, I am Tower. The true owner of THE Tower.<br>
<br>
Upon seeing this puppet-like girl who seems strangely familiar, an inexplicable sense of deja vu hits me.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
(I get it now... That feeling of recognizing yet not remembering someone or something that everyone's told me about.)<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Arbiter: The Tower XVI：</span><br>
I made a bet with Elizabeth META.<br>
I wagered that you wouldn't refuse that brighter world by yourself. I lost.<br>
My end of the deal was to step out from behind the curtains, directly answer your questions, and give you something of a "job-well-done reward."<br>
So, here I am. I'm sure you have many questions on your mind. Let's hear them all.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
I'm shocked to learn that you were the mastermind behind all this.<br>
Did Helena tell me to go find Elizabeth META because she wanted to protect me from you?<br>
And was it your fault that I couldn't contact Memphis or any of the other METAs?<br>
I had the impression you were their ally. Why did you do this?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Arbiter: The Tower XVI：</span><br>
Helena sent you to find Elizabeth because she could predict what I'd do, but that's not all. In fact, she used you to force Elizabeth to get involved in what's to come.<br>
Elizabeth is a key part of her plan, you see.<br>
Sadly for her, Elizabeth proved far less reliable than she'd expected. No doubt she didn't expect my actions to have the effect of patching up holes in her plan either.<br>
It was a blessing in disguise, as you people so like to say.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
So you're saying that, as soon as I realized what was up and refused the possibility of this brighter world, your actions worked to our benefit, huh?<br>
What if I hadn't refused it, then?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Arbiter: The Tower XVI：</span><br>
Then you could've just lived in that world forever. It would've been a happy life, free of worries – the ghosts of bygone days far behind you.<br>
Is a life of peace, calm, and fulfillment not the ideal of so many people? Are you some sort of contrarian?<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Is living in a closed-off garden, pretending there is no danger, what you call "a happy life"?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Arbiter: The Tower XVI：</span><br>
Oh, but you would've been looked after and protected to the very end.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
That kind of happiness is not what I want.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Arbiter: The Tower XVI：</span><br>
Very well. Don't forget the choice you made, then.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Helena said you Arbiters have been busy with a "transboundary experiment." Shouldn't you be doing that instead?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Arbiter: The Tower XVI：</span><br>
What experiments they run is none of my business.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Huh? Okay, so tell me about it, then.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Arbiter: The Tower XVI：</span><br>
Hmm. How about no?<br>
That's for the next episode, so to speak. You'll see it soon, so that's something to look forward to.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Fine. Next question. I learned a lot of facts and information while in that brighter world.<br>
Elizabeth said what I learned will give me a huge upper hand in the events of the foreseeable future.<br>
So what I'm wondering is: Are you trying to help me?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Arbiter: The Tower XVI：</span><br>
In a way, yes, but also no. In the possibility of that brighter world with all external information removed from it, those events are inevitable.<br>
I simply filtered the world. I did not manipulate it.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
What about Akagi?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Arbiter: The Tower XVI：</span><br>
Ah. That one.<br>
Theoretically, you two would've been going on dates and vacations. "Enjoying life" things.<br>
Unfortunately, she was a little too sharp for her own good. I had to adjust her a little.<br>
I believe that was the one and only time I directly intervened in the world.<br>
No need to worry about her. You refused the brighter world, after all. It's gone now – like chalk wiped from the board.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Your attitude is giving me mixed signals.<br>
What did you actually want me to do? Embrace the brighter world, or refuse it?<br>
Answer honestly – WHY did you do this?<br>
I'm not concerned about your goals, I just want to hear your thoughts.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Arbiter: The Tower XVI：</span><br>
......<br>
I lost my chinchillas. I was sad.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
...Come again?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Arbiter: The Tower XVI：</span><br>
Heheh. Just a little joke.<br>
After watching from afar for so long, I just had to get onto the stage.<br>
I wanted to see it with my own eyes. I wanted to change it a bit.<br>
That's right – this wasn't originally meant to happen. I could've done nothing and watched from the audience seats.<br>
I could have simply watched as the pile of corpses grew.<br>
Not that I dislike those, mind you.<br>
It's just that I felt disappointed with what a tragedy the "next episode" would've ended with. It would've been boring, that's all.<br>
Oh, and don't ask for my rating for this side episode.<br>
The difference between being a critic and a director has become painfully clear to me now.<br>
And when it comes to directing, it seems I have no talent. This is my last time trying it.<br>
As for you... Once you're back, I suggest you rest for a bit, then prepare to head to the scene of the "next episode."<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
You keep saying "next episode." What do you mean by that?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Arbiter: The Tower XVI：</span><br>
You'll know once it starts.<br>
When you get back, keep an eye out for news from the Sea of Stars.<br>
That concludes your job-well-done reward. May we meet again someday.<br>
<br>
To Be Continued<br>
