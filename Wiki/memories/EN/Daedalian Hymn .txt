Sardegna Empire - Taranto Conference Hall<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Libeccio：</span><br>
All right, Maestrale! Let's hear your report!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Maestrale：</span><br>
O-okay... The other faction representatives have finally left, huh...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Libeccio：</span><br>
C'mon, why are you such a nervous wreck? I know how hard you've been working, so everything's gonna be fine!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Nicoloso da Recco：</span><br>
Yeah, shinsh you puff in all ish wurk, you shoub be froud ob yourhelf!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Libeccio：</span><br>
Hey, stop talking with your mouth full!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Nicoloso da Recco：</span><br>
*nomnomnom*... *gulp*... Phewww, in any case, I'm just glad that scary Iron Blood lady is gone...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Vittorio Veneto：</span><br>
Scary? Are you talking about Friedrich?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Nicoloso da Recco：</span><br>
Oh, Lady Veneto! Welcome back!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Vittorio Veneto：</span><br>
Thank you. You've all done well. Da Recco, despite her appearances, Lady Friedrich is an excellent stateswoman who earned the trust of Bismarck.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Maestrale：</span><br>
Is she headed back to Iron Blood now?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Vittorio Veneto：</span><br>
Who knows? She did say she wanted to take a quick tour around Sardegna.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Maestrale：</span><br>
...and you're fine with that?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Vittorio Veneto：</span><br>
Hmm... If you put it that way...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Maestrale：</span><br>
Are you sure it's okay for such an important person to be touring around leisurely?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Nicoloso da Recco：</span><br>
You're waaaay too uptight, Maestrale. You're acting just like Carabiniere~<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Maestrale：</span><br>
Ugh... Well, if Miss Veneto says it's fine, then...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Nicoloso da Recco：</span><br>
My navigator's instinct is telling me that everything's gonna be just fine!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Vittorio Veneto：</span><br>
Now now, I'm sure she will be availing herself to information about how our Senate functions. Moreover—<br>
...Littorio, what's the matter?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Littorio：</span><br>
Sorry for interrupting, but we've got a situation on our hands.<br>
I've already forwarded the relevant information to you, so let's discuss the details shortly. I'm on my way back as we speak, so please wait for me in the conference hall.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Vittorio Veneto：</span><br>
Understood. I'll be waiting for you right here.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Libeccio：</span><br>
All right! Let's hear Maestrale's report in the meantime!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Nicoloso da Recco：</span><br>
Oooh... You can do it, Maestrale! Go, go!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Maestrale：</span><br>
Ahem! Anyway, this is Maestrale, destroyer from the Sardegna Empire, now beginning the situation report—<br>
<br>
"During the last "Reenactment," we engaged with ships from both Sardegna and the Royal Navy."<br>
"The Royal Navy confirmed the fractures between us and the Azur Lane."<br>
"Consequently, Sardegna continued to side with the Crimson Axis under the advisement of the Senate."<br>
"We continued to communicate with the different factions, and kept a particularly close eye on the Iron Blood." <br>
"At the Iron Blood's behest, Carabiniere went to one of their facilities and was given an exhibition of Iron Blood technology related to their research into Mirror Seas."<br>
"Also, Lady Veneto gained some insight based upon the development of Siren movements in the NA Ocean and Mediterranean."<br>
"A treaty was forged for a joint operation among the major naval powers, and a summit was held for that purpose."<br>
"Furthermore, we know that the Commander has returned to the Eagle Union following a lengthy stay in the Northern Parliament."<br>
"We are currently spearheading a counteroffensive against the Siren forces."<br>
"This is the end of the situation report regarding the current state of the Sardegna Navy."<br>
"Now we await your orders, Lady Vittorio Veneto, Eternal Flagship of Sardegna—"<br>

<br>
Sardegna Empire - Taranto Conference Hall<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Littorio：</span><br>
"Locate the whereabouts of the fleet that has gone missing in the Aegean Sea, and try to retrieve as much of the lost "artwork" as possible— or at least make the Sirens pay their due price." —These are the orders we've received from the Senate.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Vittorio Veneto：</span><br>
The Senate ship that sailed from Istanbul went missing, if I'm understanding this correctly?<br>
I didn't think it possible, but... this wasn't the fleet that Vincenzo Gioberti was escorting, was it?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Littorio：</span><br>
I'm afraid so. It was a special fleet put together by the Senate to transfer a large amount of artwork.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Vittorio Veneto：</span><br>
Where's Gioberti then? I hope she's fine...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Littorio：</span><br>
Not sure, I'll have to look into things further... How does an entire fleet go missing in the middle of the Mediterranean?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Vittorio Veneto：</span><br>
Had I known this would've happened, I would've sent more escorts...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Littorio：</span><br>
Don't feel guilty about what you can't control, Veneto. Besides, there's no way we could've gotten a lot of escorts over to a fleet at that position.<br>
And above all else, for an entire fleet to suddenly vanish, it's highly likely that the Sirens are involved. The situation would not have changed regardless of how many ships we added.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Vittorio Veneto：</span><br>
You're right, Littorio... When did we lose contact with the fleet?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Littorio：</span><br>
Just before daybreak yesterday, I believe? The Senate started investigating things on their own without contacting us...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Vittorio Veneto：</span><br>
……………………<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Littorio：</span><br>
In the end, they have no choice but to rely on us shipgirls.<br>
Unlike what's going on in the NA Ocean, Siren activity has only increased in the Mediterranean, and this is making the Senate nervous.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Vittorio Veneto：</span><br>
And Sardegna being unable to handle its own affairs would reflect poorly upon them...<br>
(Defeating the Sirens is something that only we can do... But we have several other objectives that we cannot afford to fail.)<br>
(The retrieval of the pieces of art. The rescue of Vincenzo Gioberti... and locating a fleet that has disappeared into thin air. Under normal circumstances, traces of the fleet would've been visible from the air.)<br>
It seems highly plausible that the fleet has gotten lost in a Mirror Sea.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Littorio：</span><br>
A Mirror Sea? Right in our backyard?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Vittorio Veneto：</span><br>
There's no other explanation. Let's plan to deploy not only a rescue convoy, but also a combat force to eliminate the Sirens.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Littorio：</span><br>
Sounds good. The usual arrangement then? I will valiantly take command of the vanguard while the fine signorina manages the situation from the rear.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Vittorio Veneto：</span><br>
Hold on, Littorio. This time, I'll also be sortieing.<br>
Unlike that "Reenactment" with the Royal Navy fleet, we may be dealing with an actual Siren encampment. In that case, I want to ensure that our combat force is without holes.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Littorio：</span><br>
As meticulous as ever, milady. But just what do you take me for?<br>
Are you sure you're prepared to stand on the front lines after staying in the back for so long? Surely you know that Littorio makes no mistakes as flagship.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Vittorio Veneto：</span><br>
Ahaha... and surely you know that as your sister ship, I can see right through your bluster.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Littorio：</span><br>
Fine, I'll admit that we both have certain areas that we excel in more than the other.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Vittorio Veneto：</span><br>
In that case, why don't you continue to take the lead? I'll join up with a supporting fleet later.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Littorio：</span><br>
Of course, I can't possibly stop you if you actually wanted to come, Eternal Flagship.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Vittorio Veneto：</span><br>
Very well. I shall join you after I have fully mustered my strength.<br>
Our goal is to wipe out the Sirens and protect the peace of the Mediterranean.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Littorio：</span><br>
Well said. We know these waters well, and we shall make the Sirens regret encroaching upon our homeland.<br>
Naturally, I look forward to witnessing what kind of fleet you'll be able to muster. Hahaha!<br>

<br>
Near the Aegean Sea<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Littorio：</span><br>
Ahhh~ The Aegean Sea, the cradle of Sardegna's civilization. Truly a place that will fascinate you with its beauty again and again.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Duca degli Abruzzi：</span><br>
Well said. The shining sun and calm waters themselves seem to be celebrating our sortie.<br>
Look at all the transport ships coming and going— Is this not precisely the reason why we must safeguard this route?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Nicoloso da Recco：</span><br>
Wow... Aristocrats really do have a way of bringing out the beauty in our language!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Littorio：</span><br>
If you don't study this sea more, the old navigator you were named after will be rolling in his grave~<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Nicoloso da Recco：</span><br>
Ehh? Seriously?!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Torricelli：</span><br>
Look at all those mass-produced ships escorting the transports... Hehe... Hehehe...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Nicoloso da Recco：</span><br>
Woah! There's way more of 'em than there used to be!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Duca degli Abruzzi：</span><br>
Regardless of Veneto's plans, it seems that the Senate is still paying close attention to the escort situation on their own.<br>
...But as far as I can see, there really aren't any shipgirls with them...<br>
Perhaps that degree of caution is no longer necessary, given that the world has come together to strike back against the Sirens.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Littorio：</span><br>
We've also got a fuel shortage on our hands. Did those stingy old curmudgeons in the Senate forget to allocate resources for us first?<br>
"There is no need for excessive KAN-SEN presence since autonomous control is sufficiently effective for mass-produced ships."<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Torricelli：</span><br>
.........Insidious... How insidious...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Duca degli Abruzzi：</span><br>
I see. So that is why the convoy's escorts were so sparse.<br>
Unthinkable... The sheer folly of only having one shipgirl to safeguard the priceless jewel that is the art of our Sardegnian civilization—<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Littorio：</span><br>
They didn't even want to send any in the first place.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Torricelli：</span><br>
...Gross...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Littorio：</span><br>
Veneto and I were equally confused by this decision, but it seemed like they wanted to handle this situation as a logistical one rather than something that required naval involvement.<br>
Veneto had to make some pretty strong demands just to get Gioberti involved.<br>
...And unfortunately, that's why she's now caught up in this mess.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Duca degli Abruzzi：</span><br>
So that's the situation, huh? As an aristocrat, I cannot afford to overlook such a blunder.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Torricelli：</span><br>
Do you really think that fleet was abducted by the Sirens...?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Duca degli Abruzzi：</span><br>
The Aegean Sea is only so big. There's no way that a search operation conducted only a day after losing contact with the fleet would result in absolutely nothing... unless the Sirens are responsible.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Littorio：</span><br>
Veneto and I reached the same conclusion. Now's not the time to question why the Senate hid these facts from us for a whole day.<br>
We must first head to the scene and investigate what happened with our own eyes.<br>
If allies require our aid, we shall rescue them.<br>
If it is the Sirens intruding upon our waters, we shall drag them out and punish them.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Duca degli Abruzzi：</span><br>
The glory of Sardegna is on the line with this operation. I, Duca degli Abruzzi, shall fulfill my obligations without fail.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Littorio：</span><br>
That's what I want to hear.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Nicoloso da Recco：</span><br>
If this route ends up looking dangerous, I'll be sure to map it out thoroughly!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Littorio：</span><br>
That's right. Let's see you live up to your name, li'l miss Navigator.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Nicoloso da Recco：</span><br>
Heck yeah! Now, let's set sail!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Torricelli：</span><br>
W-well... Guess I'll go scout around...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Nicoloso da Recco：</span><br>
Huh? Where'd Torricelli go...?<br>
{{折叠面板|内容结束}}

{{折叠面板|标题=History Lesson|选项=4|主框=1|样式=primary|展开=是}}
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Nicoloso da Recco：</span><br>
Littorio, I heard that these pieces of art came from a place called "Constantinople." What kind of place is that? I don't know of any place called that...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Littorio：</span><br>
Ahh, it was a great city of the past. All the tales in the world would not do justice to its splendor, but allow me to share some of them with you.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Torricelli：</span><br>
(Geh... She's about to start on one of her monologues again...)<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Duca degli Abruzzi：</span><br>
I heard that the pieces of art were relics from a bygone era. If they did in fact originate from that time, it only makes sense why the Senate would want them transferred.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Littorio：</span><br>
Yes, that was the name of the capital of an ancient empire, and it represents the origin of Sardegna's eternal glory.<br>
An impregnable castle, a sprawling cultural center, the hub of all worship. Through all its culture and history, Constantinople was the crowning jewel of our civilization.<br>
Even before Sardegna, it was the King's domain, the greatness that overlooked the seas.<br>
The city was given countless names in an effort to capture its glory, but there are never enough.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Torricelli：</span><br>
Well, it's called Istanbul now, huh?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Littorio：</span><br>
......<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Torricelli：</span><br>
Heheh... Hehehehe...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Littorio：</span><br>
That's right. Times change.<br>
But its greatness does not. It is hard to imagine how many priceless pieces of art the city still houses.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Nicoloso da Recco：</span><br>
Wow... That place must truly be special!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Littorio：</span><br>
Exactly!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Duca degli Abruzzi：</span><br>
However, to put it another way, the Senate's carelessness has resulted in a terrible blunder.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Littorio：</span><br>
Believe me, as much as I want to give them a piece of my mind, I cannot place the blame solely upon the Senate.<br>
Sardegna is set up in a way such that her maritime force is rarely mobilized.<br>
If we demonstrate Sardegna's capabilities to the other factions that are watching us, our prestige will spread throughout the land.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Duca degli Abruzzi：</span><br>
It would also present a prime opportunity to open an exhibition of the reclaimed art, and to invite the factions to experience our culture.<br>
Haha! Lady Veneto has thought so far ahead!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Littorio：</span><br>
Veneto aside, however, I truly do not understand what the Senate is thinking. Why did they suddenly decide to transfer all that artwork, now of all times?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Torricelli：</span><br>
D-do you think they're trying to conceal something under the guise of calling it a work of art...?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Nicoloso da Recco：</span><br>
Torricelli? Where'd you go?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Torricelli：</span><br>
Heheh, hehehe... Just went on a little dive just now...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Nicoloso da Recco：</span><br>
Oh, right, you really don't like being exposed to the sunlight.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Torricelli：</span><br>
Y-yeah, that's why... tell me when we're getting near Crete so I can dive again...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Nicoloso da Recco：</span><br>
Crete... Crete...? Oh! I've heard of that before! There's an old legend about a huge maze or something being there!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Torricelli：</span><br>
But that's just a tall tale... Hehehe... Heh. It's just an ordinary island.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Nicoloso da Recco：</span><br>
Oh, I see... But, what if there actually is a maze deep underground or something? The navigator within me is saying to check it out!<br>
And I'm gonna need your help, Torricelli! You seem to know so much stuff!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Torricelli：</span><br>
Not gonna happen, sorry... Don't wanna melt under the sun, hehehe...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Nicoloso da Recco：</span><br>
Hey! Come back here! Why are you diving again?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Torricelli：</span><br>
Heheh... Hehehehe......<br>

<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Nicoloso da Recco：</span><br>
The communication device is reacting to something! It's a stray Siren!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Duca degli Abruzzi：</span><br>
Stray or not, it is not welcome in our waters. Lead us to it!<br>
Torricelli, contact the noncombatant ships on the route we came from. I'm going to wipe out the Sirens, so have them evacuate.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Torricelli：</span><br>
Sure...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Littorio：</span><br>
Wait just a moment. Make sure to let them know that Littorio's fleet is here, and that they are under the protection of Sardegna's Navy.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Torricelli：</span><br>
Okay, got it...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Littorio：</span><br>
Hahaha! Fellow defenders of Sardegna, form battle lines and prepare to intercept the enemy!<br>

<br>
KABOOM————————!!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Duca degli Abruzzi：</span><br>
I've confirmed a direct hit on the Siren target. Too easy.<br>
Such a paltry foe was no match for me, Luigi di Savoia Duca degli Abruzzi!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Torricelli：</span><br>
Yeah... That thing seemed kinda puny...<br>
(How did Sirens this weak even manage to slip into the Mediterranean in the first place...? Hmm...)<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Littorio：</span><br>
Good. Prepare to let the other ships know that we have neutralized the Siren threat—<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Nicoloso da Recco：</span><br>
You got it! ...Wait, huh? Is there something wrong with the communication device?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Duca degli Abruzzi：</span><br>
What do you mean? Try sending the message again.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Nicoloso da Recco：</span><br>
...It's still no good!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Littorio：</span><br>
It's just like that intelligence report that Carabiniere sent...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Torricelli：</span><br>
The coordinates where the fleet went missing...!<br>
(Th-that must be... this is a Mirror Sea that I've heard so much about... I've always wanted to see what it's like, hehehe...!)<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Nicoloso da Recco：</span><br>
Noooo! Half of my navigator skills are completely useless in a Mirror Sea!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Duca degli Abruzzi：</span><br>
Looks like your predictions were correct, Littorio. Gioberti and the convoy entered into the Mirror Sea at this position, and that's when we lost contact with them.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Littorio：</span><br>
This is within my calculations. Veneto should be bringing reinforcements to our coordinates soon.<br>
(Ships still pass through this area quite often. Nobody noticed anything out of the ordinary, at least until we arrived here.)<br>
(This must mean... that they were waiting for us!)<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Nicoloso da Recco：</span><br>
Everyone, look over there!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Torricelli：</span><br>
Is that... a sea mirage?<br>

<br>
Sardegna Empire - Taranto<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Aquila：</span><br>
The winds are favorable, and the waters are calm. What a fine day it is for my planes to take flight~<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Vittorio Veneto：</span><br>
Aquila, how are you feeling?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Aquila：</span><br>
Just fine. My planes and my rigging are all in good shape.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Vittorio Veneto：</span><br>
Excellent. In that case... how about one more test run before we depart?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Aquila：</span><br>
Yes ma'am! ...Phew... I'm sure I've got the hang of this...! Take flight, my planes!<br>
<br>
With the sound of engines roaring, plane after plane took off from Aquila's flight deck.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Vittorio Veneto：</span><br>
Hmm... Looks like you're in top form today.<br>
(Sardegna's sole aircraft carrier, Aquila... She's a hard worker and has a down-to-earth personality, but... she can be a bit of an airhead at times.)<br>
(We were already having all kinds of troubles even before outfitting her with aircraft... Ahaha...)<br>
(...But, that's not really her fault.)<br>
(Sardegna has always lagged behind when it came to the development of aircraft carriers and planes, and without the Iron Blood's assistance, we wouldn't even have gotten this far...)<br>
(I tried to leverage my influence as the Eternal Flagship to open talks with the Senate regarding this matter, but that conversation was cut short abruptly.)<br>
(It must be out of their hands... I wish we had some kind of tactical edge, perhaps one of those "prototype blueprint ships" that the other factions seem to have been developing...)<br>
(I can't let this weigh me down forever though. All right...!)<br>
Aquila, call your planes back. It's time to depart.<br>
(Why aren't her planes coming back? Did something go wrong?)<br>
...Aquila, please call your planes back.<br>
<br>
Snapped back to reality, the flustered Aquila hurriedly began to recall her planes and stowed them back in her rigging.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Aquila：</span><br>
I'm so sorry, Lady Veneto... It was just so mesmerizing watching them fly around...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Vittorio Veneto：</span><br>
Ah, there's no need to apologize. You've been working hard, so it's only understandable to appreciate the beauty of your planes soaring through the sky.<br>
Of course, you'll have plenty of time after this to fly them to your heart's content.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Aquila：</span><br>
Thank you! I won't let you down!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Vittorio Veneto：</span><br>
Good. I'll be counting on you then~<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Libeccio：</span><br>
Miss Veneto, we've got big trouble!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Maestrale：</span><br>
W-we've lost contact with Littorio's fleet...!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Aquila：</span><br>
How terrible...! Lady Veneto, I'll deploy my recon planes right away!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Libeccio：</span><br>
The coordinates at which the signal disappeared was... right here, yeah! Maestrale wrote it down!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Aquila：</span><br>
Excellent work! Lady Veneto, let's not tarry here any longer!<br>
{{折叠面板|内容结束}}

{{折叠面板|标题=Veneto's Stratagem|选项=8|主框=1|样式=primary|展开=是}}
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Maestrale：</span><br>
Lady Veneto, we are approaching the waters surrounding the island of Crete.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Vittorio Veneto：</span><br>
Thank you. That means we'll be entering the Aegean Sea soon...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Aquila：</span><br>
I heard that Littorio's fleet engaged a Siren enemy in combat here not too long ago.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Libeccio：</span><br>
All the ships along this route have already been evacuated.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Vittorio Veneto：</span><br>
Yes, Littorio is always looking out for our people.<br>
She may be prideful and glory-seeking, but she understands the importance of protecting these shipping routes.<br>
Once we've handled the Mirror Sea situation, I'd like to take this opportunity to warn the Senate about further Siren activity.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Aquila：</span><br>
Since private vessels would also be affected, wouldn't that make it harder to reach any kind of agreement with the Senate?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Vittorio Veneto：</span><br>
That's where the reclaimed art comes into play. Hehe~<br>
Libeccio, there's no doubt that we are in the right place. Littorio's fleet should be just ahead of us.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Libeccio：</span><br>
Yes! This is where I last received a communication from her!<br>
I've been trying to contact the other members of the fleet, but nobody has responded...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Vittorio Veneto：</span><br>
Sudden equipment failure, abrupt weather changes, and disappearing ships... I hope civilian ships haven't been caught up in all this.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Maestrale：</span><br>
Based on Littorio's broadcast, it seems that all the other ships have already evacuated the area.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Vittorio Veneto：</span><br>
And then she rushed right in, huh?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Aquila：</span><br>
Hehe~ Lady Veneto, aren't you forgetting about someone? I believe I can be of assistance.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Vittorio Veneto：</span><br>
Right, we do have an aircraft carrier with us now. I'm not quite used to...<br>
Ahem... Aquila, can you use your recon planes to check out the coordinates listed here?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Aquila：</span><br>
As you wish~♪<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Vittorio Veneto：</span><br>
Let's move forward carefully while monitoring the status of our communications equipment.<br>

<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Aquila：</span><br>
I'm sorry, Lady Veneto, I was unable to locate Littorio's fleet. Furthermore, I seem to have lost a few recon planes as well...<br>
I'm sorry I fell short of your expectations...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Vittorio Veneto：</span><br>
Don't worry about it. It's difficult to operate aircraft within a Mirror Sea.<br>
What we do know is that the coordinates of this Mirror Sea match the ones given to us by Vincenzo Gioberti. I can confidently say that this is the same place.<br>
Maestrale, can you compare the information we collected with what Carabiniere provided us?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Maestrale：</span><br>
Every sign points to this being a Mirror Sea – a physically isolated space, electronic interference, and Siren readings.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Vittorio Veneto：</span><br>
Yes, that is in line with our expectations.<br>
We weren't able to locate Littorio or Gioberti, but we do have a pretty good idea of this Mirror Sea's range.<br>
Assuming Littorio stuck to the plan we prepared beforehand, she should be waiting for us not too far away.<br>
Otherwise... the situation might be a lot more complicated.<br>

Lady Veneto, look over there!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Vittorio Veneto：</span><br>
What is that...? It's nothing like what Carabiniere described...<br>
<br>
From the Mirror Sea surrounding Crete rose a massive labyrinth, exactly as the legends stated.<br>
But it did not seem to stop at Crete. The labyrinth sprawled towards the horizon, as if engulfing the entire Aegean Sea.<br>
The ships that witnessed this phenomenon were overwhelmed by the sheer magnitude of the spectacle.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Libeccio：</span><br>
Woahhhhh...<br>
This is the Labyrinth, right? Maestrale, have you ever heard of anything like this before? It's amazing!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Maestrale：</span><br>
Calm down, Libeccio...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Vittorio Veneto：</span><br>
It may just be a mirage. Aquila, can you send your planes over it to give us a visual confirmation?<br>
Everyone, continue to monitor the condition of your communications equipment.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Everyone：</span><br>
Understood!<br>

<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Aquila：</span><br>
Ugh... It's no good! There seems to be some kind of "wall" stopping my aircraft...<br>
My planes are just coming to a halt... They're not getting damaged, but there doesn't seem to be any way past the wall!<br>
I'm able to get a birds' eye view of the Labyrinth, but there's some kind of haze coming from the passages that makes it impossible to see where we are.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Maestrale：</span><br>
Miss Veneto... This Labyrinth must be a trap set by the Sirens!<br>
According to Carabiniere, Mirror Seas are supposed to be Siren research facilities, but I don't think there's such a rational explanation for this labyrinth...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Vittorio Veneto：</span><br>
(That's a valid point... I can't see what the purpose would be of erecting such a large labyrinth.)<br>
(But there's no knowing what machinations the Sirens are scheming up within their research facilities... We've already heard about some that defy all reason.)<br>
(There's no telling what waits for us in there, but I don't think there's any other way to get to the bottom of this and rescue Littorio and Gioberti.)<br>
It's alright, Maestrale. Trap or not, there is nothing that we cannot overcome.<br>
O Eternal Glory of Sardegna, guide our path—<br>

<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Vittorio Veneto：</span><br>
—Torricelli? Weren't you with Littorio's fleet?<br>
Where is she right now? Is everyone safe?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Torricelli：</span><br>
Safe? Yeah... Everyone's safe...<br>
There was a small Siren attack, so we had to move out... but all the Sirens are taken care of.<br>
As for how Littorio is doing... Hehehe... I think you can see for yourself...<br>
I'm not so good at dealing with her... Hehe, hehehe...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Libeccio：</span><br>
Dealing with what?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Maestrale：</span><br>
I think I have an idea...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Vittorio Veneto：</span><br>
I suppose she is rather... unique.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Torricelli：</span><br>
Yes, unique... Anyway, she is waiting at the entrance of the Labyrinth... Follow me...<br>

Hehe, hehehe... Here we are...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Libeccio：</span><br>
We're pretty close to Crete's shore! But where are the others?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Maestrale：</span><br>
Maybe they're on that mass-produced ship?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Torricelli：</span><br>
That's right... Everyone's there, except me of course... Hehehe...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Vittorio Veneto：</span><br>
……………………<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Littorio：</span><br>
My dear Eternal Flagship, and compatriots of the support fleet, welcome aboard Battleship Littorio, mass produced version!<br>
Your journey from port must've been arduous. Do come forth and be at ease, for relaxation awaits you here.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Vittorio Veneto：</span><br>
Littorio... What's gotten into you?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Littorio：</span><br>
Can't you see, we're clearly having a tea party?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Vittorio Veneto：</span><br>
No, I can see that very clearly. But why are you having a tea party in the middle of an important operation?<br>
Didn't we agree to meet up in an easily-accessible location if we got pulled into a Mirror Sea?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Littorio：</span><br>
Yes, which is why I set up at the entrance of the Labyrinth. Eventually, you would have to come here to explore the depths of the Mirror Sea, no?<br>
So, you decided to do this to uplift your fleet's morale while waiting for reinforcements?<br>
Uhh, yes, exactly!<br>
But more importantly... how could Littorio not prepare a splendid reception for the arrival of the beautiful Signorina?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Vittorio Veneto：</span><br>
Sigh...<br>
Well then... I'd like to have some coffee~♪<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Littorio：</span><br>
Would you like this special blend of black tea from the Royal Navy? I heard it is quite popular even with Her Maj—<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Vittorio Veneto：</span><br>
Coffee is fine, thank you.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Littorio：</span><br>
Fine, fine. We'll get going after we wrap things up here.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Vittorio Veneto：</span><br>
Good. Everyone, rest up while you still can.<br>

<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Littorio：</span><br>
Are Maestrale and Aquila back yet?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Vittorio Veneto：</span><br>
She's not used to flying her planes around under these conditions, so she went closer to the labyrinth to investigate.<br>
We'll work on getting whatever information we can from the air. In the meantime, do you have anything new for us, Torricelli?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Torricelli：</span><br>
Me...? Um, possibly, but...<br>
Um... I found some power generators and energy storage devices, but... I did the usual thing but nothing happened...<br>
So yeah, I'm thinking... it's probably in the back. There's no way of destroying the device without entering the Labyrinth.<br>
Also, I don't think we can do anything about the walls... I tried shooting at 'em with a torpedo, but it didn't even leave a scratch...<br>
Littorio even tried firing a salvo at it, but same deal...<br>
In other words, we probably shouldn't expect to smash our way through the labyrinth...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Vittorio Veneto：</span><br>
As expected, we have no choice but to find our way through.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Torricelli：</span><br>
Mm, yeah, that's what I think... Maybe this whole labyrinth is like, some sort of giant shield...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Libeccio：</span><br>
Torricelli, you did all of that while the rest of us were goofing off?!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Torricelli：</span><br>
Ehe, hehehe... No way I'd be able to join in a tea party, so... I had some free time, hehehe...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Duca degli Abruzzi：</span><br>
So, the Sirens are trying to recreate the Labyrinth of Crete? In the legend, there's also supposed to be a Minotaur inside.<br>
If they followed the script and there is such a ferocious monster waiting for us inside, we'll be in for a tough battle. Proceed with caution, everyone.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Nicoloso da Recco：</span><br>
My navigator skills might not work in here, but leave it to me to keep track of our route!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Vittorio Veneto：</span><br>
Hehe~ I brought some balls of yarn that we can use to find our way back to the entrance in case we get lost.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Nicoloso da Recco：</span><br>
Great! Leave it to me then!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Littorio：</span><br>
We have Aquila surveying the situation from the air, Torricelli's field intel, and da Recco's navigation. With them, we are given new hope!<br>
We fear no Siren or Minotaur, and this Labyrinth shall be ours!<br>

<br>
"Sardegna's splendor is more than just power."<br>
"It is our magnificent culture, history, and arts. It is the embodiment of the Mediterranean's civilization."<br>
"To know this, to feel this, to be proud of it..."<br>
"That is what it means to spread Sardegna's splendor." <br>
"At least that is my belief, as the Eternal Flagship."<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Aquila：</span><br>
Nobody has actually set foot in the Labyrinth of legends, but I imagine it would look a lot like this.<br>
It's spacious enough to allow mass-produced ships to travel through, and yet, still feels so claustrophobic... The towering walls certainly don't help with that.<br>
Perhaps the Sirens were greatly influenced by the artwork they stole.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Libeccio：</span><br>
Art inspiring life, huh? Not in a good way, though.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Vittorio Veneto：</span><br>
I find that highly unlikely. It's on the same scale as depictions of the legendary Labyrinth, but it doesn't appear all that elaborately designed.<br>
Moreover, from everything that I've heard, the Sirens have chiefly been interested in upgrading the performance of their units. Until now, their appearances haven't changed significantly.<br>
It would be very uncharacteristic of them to suddenly start incorporating artistic elements into their designs.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Aquila：</span><br>
Speaking of art... Doesn't the very term, "Siren," derive from the mythology native to this region?<br>
I wonder where this name came from in the first place...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Vittorio Veneto：</span><br>
Who knows? They may have chosen this name themselves. Certain Sirens are capable of communication, after all.<br>
There might be some document in the Naval HQ archives pertaining to this question, but I'm not so sure myself.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Duca degli Abruzzi：</span><br>
From a logical point of view, it makes no sense for them to have given themselves this moniker.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Littorio：</span><br>
Fascinating, isn't it? They first made their appearance decades ago, and their name has become known through every corner of the world. And yet, nobody knows the origin of that name.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Aquila：</span><br>
I'm sure many others have noticed this before. We can't be the first.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Duca degli Abruzzi：</span><br>
I can only assume that we, like so many many before us, are not privy to that information.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Littorio：</span><br>
It makes one think, does it not? Where the Sirens came from, and why their name shares a connection with our mythos.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Duca degli Abruzzi：</span><br>
...I don't know, but I think there is little use pondering it when our knowledge is so scarce.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Littorio：</span><br>
True. I suppose if any one of us did have that knowledge, she would've already gotten summons from the Senate's Research Department.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Aquila：</span><br>
Pardon? Why is that?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Littorio：</span><br>
Because they would be dying to hear the details, of course. They conduct Siren research there.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Vittorio Veneto：</span><br>
Siren research... Now that's a fascinating topic, albeit one that's much out of our league.<br>
Perhaps Queen Elizabeth, or Bismarck, are invested in it? Hmm... After all, they have much more stake in it than just the pursuit of scientific knowledge...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Littorio：</span><br>
The leaders of all the factions are keenly interested in Siren research. It's an open secret, and there's no need to dance around it.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Vittorio Veneto：</span><br>
I suppose that also means that nobody knows anything concrete about the Sirens' origins.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Nicoloso da Recco：</span><br>
Your friendly neighborhood navigator has a groundbreaking theory!<br>
The sirens in old legends would sing to lure unsuspecting sailors to a watery grave. Everyone knows that, right?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Aquila：</span><br>
Why yes, I do believe that is how the epics went.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Nicoloso da Recco：</span><br>
And the Sirens – capital S – have a lot of plans that boil down to trying to lure us into a Mirror Sea.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Vittorio Veneto：</span><br>
Are you suggesting that Mirror Seas are areas in the ocean that are naturally more prone to shipwrecks?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Nicoloso da Recco：</span><br>
Err, I don't think there's an actual connection there, but the outcome is pretty similar, right? There are some obvious similarities between the two.<br>
Granted, a Mirror Sea's a lot more dangerous than how the sirens were described in the stories. Mirror Seas don't actually exist on the ocean, and once you're inside, none of the usual navigation rules apply anymore.<br>
Huh... Come to think of it, doesn't that sound a bit more like a natural disaster than the doing of some monster? Hmmm...<br>

<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Nicoloso da Recco：</span><br>
Full turn to port at the next crossing! Aquila, send out your planes and do your thing!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Vittorio Veneto：</span><br>
(Da Recco's plan of scouting ahead using planes and trusting her navigator's sense seems to be working. Let's hope we're not actually going in circles.)<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Aquila：</span><br>
Lady Veneto, I've spotted a Siren fleet straight ahead! I suspect they're waiting to ambush us!<br>
It's too hazy to say for sure, but they seem to be new models based on their color scheme!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Duca degli Abruzzi：</span><br>
New Siren models. Just what we needed...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Littorio：</span><br>
Their coloration is downright revolting... It's a mockery of our Sardegnian palette.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Duca degli Abruzzi：</span><br>
According to Torricelli, these are not new models. They differ only in appearance.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Vittorio Veneto：</span><br>
Imitation is the sincerest form of flattery, as they say. Even the Sirens are moved by Sardegna's splendor.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Littorio：</span><br>
So they stole our artwork and were so impressed that they decided to imitate us? Who but you would be astute enough to see that possibility, my signorina?<br>
But, an imitation is an imitation, and this is a cheap one at that. Any proud Sardegnian would take this not as flattery, but as an insult.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Vittorio Veneto：</span><br>
Just an interesting thought, if nothing more...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Littorio：</span><br>
They shall find that mere imitations are nothing compared to the true splendor of Sardegna that we bring.<br>
We are more than just a coat of paint on floating hunks of metal. We are the successors of Sardegna and all her glory.<br>
Even supposing the resemblance is merely a coincidence, we Sardegnians alone have the right to display these colors, not the Sirens.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Vittorio Veneto：</span><br>
Coincidence or not, those colors make them stick out like a sore thumb against their surroundings.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Duca degli Abruzzi：</span><br>
They may as well have painted giant bullseyes on themselves.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Aquila：</span><br>
Indeed. Because of those bright colors, I was able to detect them very early on.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Torricelli：</span><br>
Yeah... I wouldn't have seen 'em from down below... Hehehe...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Littorio：</span><br>
It's very fortunate... Unless... It's a ploy? Did they choose this conspicuous coloration to trick us into attacking them?<br>
Our forces are far superior to theirs, giving us a false sense of security by making us believe we can just move forward with no need to be cautious...<br>
And to make them so obvious that Aquila could spot them far ahead of time with her planes... It's all too convenient.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Vittorio Veneto：</span><br>
Perhaps we need to reevaluate the way we paint our own ships...<br>
{{折叠面板|内容结束}}

{{折叠面板|标题=Imitations |选项=17|主框=1|样式=primary|展开=是}}
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Duca degli Abruzzi：</span><br>
It's as Torricelli said. Just a fresh coat of paint.<br>
What were they hoping to achieve by changing their coloration? It will do nothing to impede our fleet, accompanied by the Eternal Flagship herself–<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Aquila：</span><br>
Abruzzi! Lady Veneto! Your attention, please!<br>
I've spotted ships from the Royal Navy directly ahead of us!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Vittorio Veneto：</span><br>
That wouldn't be surprising if we were on the west side of the Mediterranean. Out here, however...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Littorio：</span><br>
Those poor signorinas must be lost and afraid, praying for me to come to their rescue.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Vittorio Veneto：</span><br>
It's a little far-fetched to suppose that they sailed right through Sardegna's busiest routes and wound up in here, all without anyone noticing them first, wouldn't you say?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Littorio：</span><br>
A little, yes. The simplest explanation is clear enough – that they are Siren Pawns.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Vittorio Veneto：</span><br>
Aquila, can you identify who they are?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Aquila：</span><br>
I shall try. Give me a moment to bring my planes closer.<br>
I see Illustrious, Warspite, Formidable, and... a few light cruisers and destroyers.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Duca degli Abruzzi：</span><br>
First they mock our proud colors, then they send Pawns at us. Disgusting.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Vittorio Veneto：</span><br>
That's all quite typical for a Mirror Sea, I believe.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Littorio：</span><br>
Well, if they thought it would wear at our morale, they thought wrong.<br>
I will concede, they caught us off guard once in the past, but now is different. We must put any conflicts we've had with the other factions behind us.<br>
Sardegna shall not become "pawns" in their petty games. It's time we make this abundantly clear to the Sirens, and to the rest of the world.<br>
(It takes mental fortitude to shoot an adversary with the face of someone you know. We of course have it, but still...)<br>
(Those armored carrier sisters must've had similar apprehensions when they first fought their own doppelgangers.)<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Vittorio Veneto：</span><br>
Torricelli, attract the attention of those carriers! Make it as easy as possible for Aquila to leverage her planes against them!<br>
Everyone else, prepare to engage! Let us show these masquerading Sirens the splendor of Sardegna!<br>

<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Duca degli Abruzzi：</span><br>
Confirming all Pawns have been eliminated. What's our damage?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Maestrale：</span><br>
A few scratches and bruises, but not much else.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Duca degli Abruzzi：</span><br>
Hmph. Their likeness to the real Royal Navy is only skin-deep.<br>
I'm well aware Pawns are only imitations of us, but this is just pathetic on the Sirens' part.<br>
Normally, they would adjust their tactics to match that of the targets they're copying, but these ones did not.<br>
They behaved erratically. Much like they were fighting without a clear goal.<br>
It makes me wonder how we would fare in a fight against the real Royal Navy.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Nicoloso da Recco：</span><br>
They can keep 'em coming for all I care! I could pop these losers with my eyes clo– Whuah?!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Libeccio：</span><br>
Did the walls... just move?<br>
<br>
The dense walls of the labyrinth suddenly shifted around in the blink of an eye.<br>
All at once, they turned to face another direction. It was as if the Sardegnian ships had been transported to an altogether different labyrinth.<br>
Even Aquila, with her planes circling overhead, could only stare dumbfounded at what just transpired. The other ships were similarly lost for words.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Nicoloso da Recco：</span><br>
Nooooo! All the love and artistry I poured into drawing this map were for nothing! It's useless now!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Maestrale：</span><br>
Ugh... We were making such good progress too with Aquila's reconnaissance...<br>
There won't even be much of a point to scouting ahead if our surroundings will just change on us out of nowhere...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Torricelli：</span><br>
A-actually... I think we're still fine...<br>
Remember... Gioberti's team is on the other side of the labyrinth... They're making progress too...<br>
If the labyrinth keeps changing, that's a sign it's... trying to hide something... So I think we're on the right path...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Vittorio Veneto：</span><br>
Either that, or the Sirens are trying to lure us into a corner with Pawns as the bait, then turn the walls and trap us.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Torricelli：</span><br>
M-maybe... But the path to the exit has... stayed the same...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Libeccio：</span><br>
She's right. That sounds more like they're trying to stop us from getting too close to something, rather than throw our sense of direction off.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Maestrale：</span><br>
If the goal was to trap us, the smart move would be to neutralize Aquila's planes first.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Nicoloso da Recco：</span><br>
We can stand around theorizing all day, but all I know is that our only real option is to keep moving forward!<br>
So! Aquila, keep on doing your thing with the recon!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Aquila：</span><br>
Understood! I can confirm that the labyrinth's structure has changed, but our location has remained the same, as has the path back to the entrance! Rest assured, we are at no risk of getting trapped!<br>

"As the Eternal Flagship and leader of this fleet, I must bear both of these in mind at once."<br>
"If I am too nervous in my conduct, our morale will suffer."<br>
"If I am too relaxed in my conduct, our guard will falter." <br>
"For these reasons, Littorio's presence provides me such relief."<br>
"Because, in stark contrast to her reputation as being frivolous,"<br>
"Nobody is more dependable than her when the cards are on the table."<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Libeccio：</span><br>
Hey Maestrale, is it just me, or does it feel like we're going in circles?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Maestrale：</span><br>
I don't think so, but I can understand why you might think that. Every segment does look the same.<br>
The labyrinth of Knossos was said to have countless misleading twists and turns. It was so confusing that even its designer almost got lost in it...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Torricelli：</span><br>
A-at least the walls in that labyrinth probably didn't sh-shift around...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Nicoloso da Recco：</span><br>
Worst-case scenario, we'll have to rely purely on gut instinct... Not the best way to get around...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Duca degli Abruzzi：</span><br>
If this is a Siren research facility, they are perhaps interested in seeing whether we can navigate our way through it.<br>
How daring the Sirens are, to try to make a guinea pig out of Luigi di Savoia Duca degli Abruzzi!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Aquila：</span><br>
Indeed, the Sirens enjoy conducting psychological warfare as much as they do normal warfare.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Duca degli Abruzzi：</span><br>
It's no wonder we have never achieved a decisive victory against them after all this time. Winning a battle does not win one the war.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Torricelli：</span><br>
M-makes you wonder... what they're trying to find out through their experiments... Hehehehe...<br>
I mean... they wouldn't go making elaborate research facilities just for fun to see what happens...<br>
Take the Iron Blood one that Carabiniere went to... That one was for testing the performance of aircraft, I think...<br>
Hehe, hehehe... M-makes me curious... what the purpose of this one is...<br>

<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Vittorio Veneto：</span><br>
What did Friedrich and I discuss at the last faction summit? Why do you ask, Littorio? I thought you weren't interested in politics.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Littorio：</span><br>
Make no mistake, I am not. But me being clueless about political developments would not stand in the event you were incapacitated, my dear Eternal Flagship.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Vittorio Veneto：</span><br>
I'm sure we would be just fine with you taking over the fleet~<br>
In any case, we mostly talked about the Mirror Sea that Carabiniere went to. Apparently, a battle against the Sirens broke out there.<br>
They were able to emerge victorious thanks to the efforts of their new carriers, Peter Strasser, as well as our Carabiniere.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Littorio：</span><br>
There must be a reason behind that as well. Veneto, you also don't believe that their involvement with the Sirens ends at merely "using captured technology," do you?<br>
I've heard that the Northern Parliament uses captured technology as well, though nothing to the extent of what the Iron Blood has at their disposal.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Vittorio Veneto：</span><br>
While I see your point, what good does it do for us to distrust them?<br>
Now that I think about it, you were opposed to letting Friedrich visit Sardegna, weren't you?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Littorio：</span><br>
The better question is, why weren't you? You practically rolled out the red carpet for her!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Vittorio Veneto：</span><br>
Huh, was that a poor decision on my part?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Littorio：</span><br>
Now the realization dawns on you? Your ignorance is sometimes as stunning as your beauty, "signorina."<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Vittorio Veneto：</span><br>
Oh my, I never knew you had... such a sharp tongue. How fascinating.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Littorio：</span><br>
But yes, I knew that she was interested in prying into the inner workings of our Senate.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Vittorio Veneto：</span><br>
Oh? Have you spoken to Friedrich as well?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Littorio：</span><br>
That I have. She asked me how I felt about our leaders, and if I was interested in further spreading Sardegna's splendor.<br>
I was more than happy to talk about the latter, but the former? I had no desire to invite that kind of trouble, so I said nothing.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Vittorio Veneto：</span><br>
It's good that you were able to have a conversation with her. And even better that you were able to carefully watch your words.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Littorio：</span><br>
I think it's fair to say that I have some experience with that. My signorina, the two of you can be quite similar in certain regards~<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Vittorio Veneto：</span><br>
Hehe~ I'm glad you're sufficiently perceptive. In any case, the splendor of Sardegna is something that Sardegnians should spread, using Sardegnian methods.<br>
The routes in the Mediterranean that connect countless peoples and cultures have been an important part of human history. Only through keeping it safe for all... can the world truly understand what it means to be Sardegnian.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Littorio：</span><br>
Yes, we shall spread peace and prosperity in a way that has never been seen in the past, first throughout the Mediterranean, then all of Europa.<br>
These noble dreams and aspirations are a constant reminder that we are more than weapons of war.<br>
More than ever, we understand the importance of shattering this Siren Labyrinth and retrieving the stolen artwork.<br>
No matter how many obstacles lie in our path, we will never lose sight of our goal!<br>

More Royal Navy pawns spotted to our front! Their numbers and formation are the exact same as the last one!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Nicoloso da Recco：</span><br>
The EXACT same?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Libeccio：</span><br>
"Keep 'em coming for all I care"... Well, I guess you got your "wish" granted.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Nicoloso da Recco：</span><br>
I didn't wish for it! Don't try to pin this on me!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Maestrale：</span><br>
She's not blaming you, she's just teasing you!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Nicoloso da Recco：</span><br>
Sure hope that's all. But what if... I'm able to influence the Sirens? Maybe that's why we're fighting the same enemies!<br>
Ahem... Gee, it would be nice if a path straight to the center opened up!<br>
<br>
……………………<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Nicoloso da Recco：</span><br>
Oh, come on! Open sesame, you stupid Sirens!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Duca degli Abruzzi：</span><br>
Settle down. You're only making a laughingstock out of yourself to the Sirens.<br>
They are already trying to make a mockery of us with this labyrinth. Let us not make it any easier for them.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Littorio：</span><br>
Uh-huh! Let's get real and show these Sirens who's boss!<br>

<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Duca degli Abruzzi：</span><br>
That's the end of them.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Littorio：</span><br>
All their efforts amount to is a temporary hindrance at best in the face of Sardegna's greatest fleet.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Aquila：</span><br>
Allow me to handle the skies. I shall support you while scouting ahead to the best of my abilities.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Littorio：</span><br>
Of course, just don't overextend yourself now.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Duca degli Abruzzi：</span><br>
Yawn. I can't be bothered to keep track of how many enemies we've defeated by now.<br>
(As trivial as they are to fight, they still eat away at our ammo reserves. Furthermore, more of them seem to appear every time the labyrinth changes...)<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Nicoloso da Recco：</span><br>
Over here, folks! This-a way!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Libeccio：</span><br>
You heard her! Last one there's a rotten egg, Maestrale!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Maestrale：</span><br>
W-wait! Don't go running off! *sigh*...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Littorio：</span><br>
We've made significant progress through the labyrinth now, all thanks to Aquila's eyes in the skies.<br>
But, though we've traveled a great distance, we have nothing to show for it... It might be time I took a good look around to see what's here.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Vittorio Veneto：</span><br>
Be careful, Littorio. The Sirens' deployments don't bode well for us.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Littorio：</span><br>
I'm well aware. Rest assured, I'm not about to let myself get overconfident just from a few victories against measly Pawns.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Vittorio Veneto：</span><br>
Good. If Gioberti and the Mirror Sea control device are at the center of the labyrinth, then their defenses should start ramping up significantly pretty soon.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Littorio：</span><br>
Even if they do, have no worries. Our forces are strong, and should we need to retreat, the exit is right behind our backs.<br>
All you need do, my dear Eternal Flagship, is continue calmly issuing orders like normal.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Narration：</span><br>
The Sardegnian fleet's venture into the labyrinth continued...<br>
{{折叠面板|内容结束}}

{{折叠面板|标题=Dangerous Allure |选项=23|主框=1|样式=primary|展开=是}}
<br>
On and on the Sardegnian fleet progressed through the Mirror Sea labyrinth in the Aegean Sea.<br>
Quite some time had passed since they entered. By now, they had fought and destroyed many fleets comprised of Pawns.<br>
And each time they defeated a fleet, the very walls of the labyrinth changed all around them.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Torricelli：</span><br>
(It's kinda weird... The labyrinth keeps changing, but it still feels like we're getting closer and closer to our goal...)<br>
(Maybe they aren't trying to keep us out... but rather lure us deeper inside...)<br>
(Still, we don't have much choice if we wanna save Gioberti and the artworks... Hehehehe... I'd better tell Lady Veneto...)<br>
Lady Veneto, d-do you know about this thing called "the siren's song"?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Vittorio Veneto：</span><br>
Hm? Why do you ask, all of a sudden?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Torricelli：</span><br>
I-I might just be overthinking it, but... You know how we feel like we're getting closer to the labyrinth's center...?<br>
Hehe, hehehe... I think it's because that's what the Sirens want us to think...<br>
I mean... They're ignoring Aquila's planes, painting their own ships bright colors, and trying to lure us into battles with Pawns...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Vittorio Veneto：</span><br>
...And hoping we don't catch on?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Torricelli：</span><br>
L-like I said, I might be overthinking it... But it's something...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Vittorio Veneto：</span><br>
(It is something, all right. The only thing we've encountered since we set foot in here has been more and more enemies...)<br>
(It's possible... that it was a mistake to enter the labyrinth. But, we still have to keep going...)<br>
{{折叠面板|内容结束}}

{{折叠面板|标题=Littorio and Veneto |选项=24|主框=1|样式=primary|展开=是}}
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Duca degli Abruzzi：</span><br>
Lady Veneto, Littorio has already taken out the last of the enemies.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Aquila：</span><br>
There's a certain sense of satisfaction you get from cleaving through swaths of enemies with ease.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Vittorio Veneto：</span><br>
I guess so... Hm? Littorio?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Littorio：</span><br>
What's the matter? Did you want to check on our kill count?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Vittorio Veneto：</span><br>
Of course not. I just had a question.<br>
How do we know that we're headed in the right direction?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Littorio：</span><br>
Because Vincenzo Gioberti must still be deeper inside, protecting the fleet and our precious artwork. What choice do we have but to keep pushing forward to complete our mission...?<br>
Besides, didn't we establish that there's a good chance that the Mirror Sea control device is somewhere in here?<br>
If we find it and destroy it, we can eliminate this Mirror Sea and end the threat to our shipping routes.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Vittorio Veneto：</span><br>
That's exactly what I'm talking about. Why are we navigating through this labyrinth in the first place, and what if we've made a fundamental error about our objectives?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Littorio：</span><br>
Veneto... What are you trying to say?<br>
What else can we do but to go deeper inside the labyrinth?<br>
All the enemies we've defeated means that we're on the right path, does it not?<br>
Besides, Aquila and da Recco would've said something if they felt like we weren't going in the right direction.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Vittorio Veneto：</span><br>
I'm not trying to imply that the two of them aren't performing...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Littorio：</span><br>
Of course. All of our colleagues are giving their utmost to make this operation a success.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Vittorio Veneto：</span><br>
But, I've been thinking about whether we've been on the right track this whole time...<br>
I am starting to believe that we've conflated "navigating through the labyrinth" with our original objectives of rescuing Gioberti and retrieving the artwork.<br>
Sure, at first, we had no choice but to enter the labyrinth.<br>
But each time the labyrinth shifts, I'm forced to reevaluate whether or not we're doing the right thing.<br>
At least it's comforting to know that the path back to the entrance has not changed.<br>
Though I do not wish to deny the efforts that all our friends have put forth, if what pushes us forward obstinately is our sense of pride and splendor, then...<br>
I'm sorry... This is my failure as a leader.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Duca degli Abruzzi：</span><br>
Lady Veneto...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Vittorio Veneto：</span><br>
(It's not too late yet, but there is no "glory" in what we are doing. We have to change our mentality that forward is the only direction we can go...)<br>
(We consume ammunition every time we engage the enemies, no matter how weak they are. Sooner or later, having to remain alert while sailing will deplete our strength.)<br>
(While Aquila is already dramatically exceeding my expectations with her resilience and focus, we have no backup should she become exhausted.)<br>
(Did I overlook all of this simply from thinking that we're in a Siren research facility...?)<br>
(You might be worried about your missions, but don't ever lose sight of your friends, Veneto!)<br>
(I see... It's not that the Sirens don't know enough about us... It's that they know too much about us.)<br>
(They've exploited our tendency to rush to act, constantly giving us the illusion that we're moving forward and getting closer to our goals, without ever stopping to think what our goal actually is. Perhaps that little tea party that Littorio threw was...)<br>
Littorio, I'm going to need your help to complete this operation.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Littorio：</span><br>
…………………………………………<br>
But whatever you have planned, always know that I, as your other half, shall fully support you.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Duca degli Abruzzi：</span><br>
I, Duca degli Abruzzi, have also underestimated the enemy. For that, I am deeply ashamed of myself.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Aquila：</span><br>
I'm also sorry! Because of my inexperience, I was unable to recognize...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Nicoloso da Recco：</span><br>
Looks like I also need more training...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Libeccio：</span><br>
Huuuh? Why's it like confession hour in here?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Vittorio Veneto：</span><br>
Have we all managed to take a step back? We can still get through this, but we'll need to change the way we do things.<br>
Littorio, I'm ready to lead once more – Everyone, get ready to set sail!<br>

<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Aquila：</span><br>
More Siren Pawns are starting to show up again!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Nicoloso da Recco：</span><br>
Damn it! Do we have to fight our way through them no matter what?!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Duca degli Abruzzi：</span><br>
Lady Veneto, I have an idea.<br>
The enemy clearly has no will to fight. Why don't we try to bypass them without trying anything fancy?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Aquila：</span><br>
Are you serious? What if they turn on us when we're right next to them?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Libeccio：</span><br>
Heeeeey! Maestrale, check this out!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Maestrale：</span><br>
Wait, Libeccio! ...Stay away from them!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Vittorio Veneto：</span><br>
No! Come back, Libeccio...!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Littorio：</span><br>
Wait, they're seriously not attacking her...<br>

<br>
"Hey, Veneto, do you consider yourself an art aficionado?"<br>
"Who knows~ There's a lot in Sardegna that I love even more."<br>
"We do have the best food though, don't we? And the world's best bathhouses."<br>
"Yes... and the best friends anyone can ask for." <br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Maestrale：</span><br>
In short, if we leave the Pawns alone, the labyrinth won't shift around.<br>
But what about the aggressive Sirens?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Nicoloso da Recco：</span><br>
That's a good point... Even if we can leave them alone for now, what's not to say that they don't all come crashing down on us when we're trying to leave?<br>
We'd be caged in from both sides...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Maestrale：</span><br>
We've never had to worry about any Sirens sneaking up from behind us so far though...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Libeccio：</span><br>
Yeah! It's gonna be a huge issue if we find our way through the labyrinth but can't make our way back!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Duca degli Abruzzi：</span><br>
I suspect the Sirens aren't so generous as to allow us to just follow our ball of string back to the entrance.<br>
However, our primary focus right now shouldn't be on how to escape.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Littorio：</span><br>
It seems that the shortest leg of our journey will be getting to the center of the labyrinth, rather than to the end or the beginning.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Vittorio Veneto：</span><br>
I'm sure Aquila's planes will be able to get us to that "center."<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Aquila：</span><br>
So that's your idea of how to leave the labyrinth, huh? Let's call it Operation Daedalus~♪<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Vittorio Veneto：</span><br>
Quite fitting. Please prepare your aircraft, Aquila.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Aquila：</span><br>
Of course! I've never tried something like this before, but just leave it to me!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Vittorio Veneto：</span><br>
Good. If we avoid fighting the Sirens, we'll be able to at least see what they're trying to keep us away from.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Littorio：</span><br>
Wait, hold on a darn minute, Veneto... Are you seriously suggesting... that we hop on Aquila's planes?!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Nicoloso da Recco：</span><br>
Hwuh? Is that even possible?!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Torricelli：</span><br>
I, I don't think it's impossible in theory... B-but it might not be the best idea to try it here...<br>
Aquila would be left behind by herself... and it's not like carrier-based planes work the same way as passenger planes...<br>
Shipgirls might be able to do some pretty amazing stuff, but... I think this might be a bit too dangerous to try without training... Hehe, hehehehe...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Vittorio Veneto：</span><br>
(I've actually seen someone pull it off before, but that person... defies all normal rationality...)<br>
Of course I don't think we'll be able to ride on top of the planes... Rather, what I'm trying to say is...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Duca degli Abruzzi：</span><br>
...I see, you'll try to exploit the fact that the labyrinth shifts when we defeat the Siren Pawns?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Vittorio Veneto：</span><br>
First, our objective isn't to go through the labyrinth, but to rescue Gioberti and retrieve any missing artwork.<br>
The distance to the center of the labyrinth grows each time we destroy the Pawns.<br>
So far, we've been focusing exclusively on "defeating the Sirens," and this has only taken us further and further away from our real goals.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Duca degli Abruzzi：</span><br>
Focus on getting through the labyrinth rather than on fighting, huh?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Littorio：</span><br>
Avoid engaging the Sirens and head straight for the middle, then pull away any enemies in our way with our planes?<br>
I'm not sure they'll fall for that more than once or twice, so we'll have to stay alert and ready to fight just in case.<br>
Anyway, you heard the Eternal Flagship. Let's make our way towards the center as quickly as possible without engaging the enemy.<br>
<br>
30 minutes later...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Littorio：</span><br>
Ugh... Things never quite work out the way we plan,...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Vittorio Veneto：</span><br>
It's also very hard to disregard all our training and sail right by mass-produced ships without any protection...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Torricelli：</span><br>
Hehehe... Does that mean we can finally beat them up...?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Vittorio Veneto：</span><br>
The labyrinth doesn't seem to shift when we engage the Sirens, but only after defeating them.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Duca degli Abruzzi：</span><br>
Is that true?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Vittorio Veneto：</span><br>
Yes, and if we can manage to engage them but not sink them, as if conducting a friendly naval exercise, we can get them to move.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Aquila：</span><br>
I see... So we'll fight them right up to the point where they stop being a threat to us, but still won't cause the labyrinth to shift?<br>
In other words... We'll be trying to chase them away but not trying to annihilate them.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Littorio：</span><br>
Well, I suppose it'll be a new learning experience to figure out how to fight Sirens without completely destroying them.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Vittorio Veneto：</span><br>
Right. I suspect that there should be some kind of control panel in the middle of the Mirror Sea, with a Siren guarding it.<br>
We'll need to save our strength for the final battle, so please try to hold back for now.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Torricelli：</span><br>
Hehehe... I can obviously just go right underneath them... Submarine supremacy and all...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Littorio：</span><br>
Trying to dive with all this rigging stuck to us seems even harder than trying to stand on an airplane... Anyway, let's give this a try.<br>

At least the labyrinth hasn't been shifting, which is a good sign.<br>

<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Duca degli Abruzzi：</span><br>
Fantastic! Did you finally locate them?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Aquila：</span><br>
The escorts are with them as well! I see Gioberti and... Who's that? Someone from the Northern Parliament?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Vittorio Veneto：</span><br>
(Why would someone from the Northern Parliament be here? ...Did she come to the meeting with Soyuz?)<br>
(Well, let's not overthink. More importantly, we need to rescue Gioberti right now!)<br>
Do you see any Sirens nearby?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Aquila：</span><br>
Yes...! There's some kind of humanoid figure in front of them!<br>
I can't see how many mass-produced ships there are from this altitude...<br>

<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Vittorio Veneto：</span><br>
So this is your doing, Tester...<br>
You're the one who attacked Sardegna's transport ships and abducted our escorts.<br>
<span style="color:#ec5d53;">?????：</span><br>
...Excellent. This matches the expected data from our simulations.<br>
Hmm, maybe a bit longer than expected? It's difficult to avoid errors, after all.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Vittorio Veneto：</span><br>
...You really are treating us as experimental guinea pigs, just as your name suggests.<br>
Did you create this Mirror Sea and attack our shipping routes just to lure us in?<br>
<span style="color:#ec5d53;">?????：</span><br>
This is an experiment using incomplete "Reenactment" in a closed system under normal conditions, without the confounding variables of "humans" or "Them."<br>
We have determined that the aircraft carrier from the Sakura Empire is "extremely anomalous."<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Vittorio Veneto：</span><br>
Answer me, Tester!<br>
<span style="color:#ec5d53;">?????：</span><br>
Now uploading data. This body will then be surrendered for the purpose of testing experimental EMP weapons.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Duca degli Abruzzi：</span><br>
She's completely ignoring us, as if we don't even matter to her.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Aquila：</span><br>
From what I've read, the other factions have fought against Sirens calling themselves "Tester" on several occasions, but they've been able to communicate before...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Vittorio Veneto：</span><br>
We might have a special case on our hands by the looks of things...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Libeccio：</span><br>
Veneto, we've finished evacuating Gioberti and the transport ships!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Maestrale：</span><br>
Can we leave now? Is that thing just not interested in us?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Duca degli Abruzzi：</span><br>
I am loathe to run my rapier through an opponent that will not draw her blade, but my code of conduct does not prohibit any tactic from being used against a Siren foe.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Torricelli：</span><br>
R-rigging parts... hehe, hehehe... I'd like to retrieve some, if possible... Hehehe...<br>
<span style="color:#ec5d53;">?????：</span><br>
Weapon test settings confirmed.... Loading EMP Artillery... Commencing operation–<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Nicoloso da Recco：</span><br>
Holy! She's pointing her guns at us!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Torricelli：</span><br>
I guess we have to fight after all... Hehehe...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Vittorio Veneto：</span><br>
If you're going to be the first to draw, we won't hold back! Everyone, ready your guns! Defeat that high-level Siren!<br>

<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Libeccio：</span><br>
Ehhh...?! All the electronic devices on my rigging started going haywire!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Maestrale：</span><br>
Me too... I can barely even aim...! I don't even know what's wrong though!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Torricelli：</span><br>
This must be the work of the Siren's secret weapon... How terrifying... and exciting... Hehe, hehehehe...!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Nicoloso da Recco：</span><br>
Is this the mythical Siren song that leads sailors to their demise? I can't feel it, but I can't hear it at all...!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Torricelli：</span><br>
Maybe it's a weapon that's firing at a specific frequency... Some kind of electromagnetic wave that we aren't able to detect...<br>
But wow... What a dramatic effect it's having on our equipment... How scary...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Vittorio Veneto：</span><br>
(At that moment, we all understood why the Sirens were given that name...)<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Vincenzo Gioberti ：</span><br>
Veneto! Littorio! Vincenzo Gioberti is ready to fight!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Littorio：</span><br>
Are you sure? Don't push yourself if you're injured!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Vincenzo Gioberti ：</span><br>
No worries, Miss Littorio! We all worked hard to keep the transport ships safe!<br>
But, after we got caught up in here, I haven't had anything to eat... It's been two days already, and I'm starving!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Littorio：</span><br>
We wanted to come after you as soon as we heard that the transport fleet was attacked, but we got pushed back a day due to various reasons...<br>
In any case, Veneto and I owe you an apology.<br>
...And who might you be, young lady?<br>
<span style="color:#ffd000;">Stremitelny ：</span><br>
I'm Stremitelny from the Northern Parliament! I'm carrying out a diplomatic mission at the instructions of Miss Soyuz!<br>
...Well, that was the plan, anyway, before I got caught up in a Mirror Sea! Ugh...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Vittorio Veneto：</span><br>
(Soyuz brought someone with her? How unexpected...)<br>
I'm sorry you got caught up in our troubles, Stremitelny. After we finish this operation, I'd like to show you around our capital.<br>
This place is going to turn into a warzone soon though, so I'd recommend you evacuate with the others–<br>
<span style="color:#ffd000;">Stremitelny ：</span><br>
Don't underestimate my ability to beat up those Sirens!<br>
Besides, I owe you for coming to our aid!<br>
So let me join you, and I'll show those big bad Sirens why they should fear my name!<br>

KABOOM–––––––!<br>
<span style="color:#ec5d53;">?????：</span><br>
Weapon output has dropped to 70% – Initiating protocols to speed up acquisition of test results.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Duca degli Abruzzi：</span><br>
Tester's strength aside, it's incredibly frustrating not being able to use my full strength because of this accursed jamming...!<br>
We're going to be at a severe disadvantage as the battle draws on if we can't destroy that EM weapon!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Aquila：</span><br>
The sky's way too hazy for me to operate my planes effectively! Even though there's not much anti-air fire, my bombers can't get a clear visual...!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Vittorio Veneto：</span><br>
(This area's large enough to conceal a large number of mass-produced ships as well as all the transports... Locking onto Tester is going to be almost impossible with all this haze...)<br>
(Calm down, Veneto... There has to be a way to tip the scales in our favor...)<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Littorio：</span><br>
Veneto, head down there and see if you can find anything! I'll hold the enemies back!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Aquila：</span><br>
Littorio? What are you trying to do...?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Littorio：</span><br>
The same thing we always do. Veneto commands, and I take the scene in a blaze of glory! Everyone, don't waste your ammo on shots that won't land, and focus on evasive maneuvers!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Aquila：</span><br>
Lead us to victory, Miss Littorio! Lady Veneto!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Littorio：</span><br>
Now, let's have a closer look at just what we're dealing with here...!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Vittorio Veneto：</span><br>
(Where is this mist that's interfering with Aquila coming from? Yes, I see it...!)<br>
Littorio, have everyone aim over there at Tester's position! Make sure to sync your attacks!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Littorio：</span><br>
I'm not sure what we're shooting at, but I trust your judgment!<br>
Everyone, follow our Eternal Flagship's commands! Don't worry about hitting Tester, just aim at her location, and shoot at maximum elevation!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Aquila：</span><br>
I see! I can work with this!<br>
Bombers, fighter-bombers, dive now...!!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Littorio：</span><br>
I get it now... Instead of trying to disperse the haze, you tried to create a route for Aquila's bombers even if they couldn't see the target...!<br>
But how can we ensure that her bombs hit the mark? Wait... this is a concentrated bombardment through sheer force...?!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Vittorio Veneto：</span><br>
Follow her lead! Continue to lay down your fire! Don't let Tester escape!<br>
You shall learn what happens when you attempt to defile the splendor of Sardegna, Siren scum!<br>

<br>
It was unclear whether Aquila's devastating bombardment was able to destroy Tester's experimental EM weapon, but it was certain that the Siren had been pushed back.<br>
With Tester's retreat, the Mirror Sea that threatened the Aegean began to fade, along with the giant labyrinth sitting atop the ocean.<br>
All that remained were the smoldering husks of mass-produced Sirens, drifting supplies, and the safely-evacuated Senate transport.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Vincenzo Gioberti ：</span><br>
Heheh~ Sardegnian shipgirls are the best of the best!<br>
<span style="color:#ffd000;">Stremitelny ：</span><br>
Hmph. Not a bad display, but you guys still don't hold a candle to the might of the Northern Parliament!<br>
Let's have a joint exercise next time!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Vincenzo Gioberti ：</span><br>
I'll make you eat your words! You'd better not chicken out!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Aquila：</span><br>
Everyone fought their hearts out, but it seems like we're all safe and sound~<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Duca degli Abruzzi：</span><br>
I've finished checking on the condition of the transport ship. None of the pieces of art on board were damaged.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Vittorio Veneto：</span><br>
Thank goodness... I was getting a little worried from how heated the battle was becoming...<br>
We all had to work a lot harder than expected, especially Aquila. I must thank everyone for making this operation a success.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Aquila：</span><br>
Thank you for your praise, but I still have much to learn. Compared to the leadership of Miss Littorio and Lady Veneto, and the tireless efforts of everyone here, I barely accomplished anything.<br>
I will continue to study and train harder, so that I may become a carrier that Sardegna truly can be proud of.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Vittorio Veneto：</span><br>
Now now, if you try too hard to be humble, you'll come off as being insincere. Hehe~<br>
(The Mirror Sea completely disappeared before we were able to thoroughly investigate it...)<br>
(We managed to rescue Gioberti and retrieve the art, eliminate the Siren threat, and even help out one of the Northern Parliament's ships. And yet...)<br>
(I can't shake the feeling that we did not truly achieve a victory here today...)<br>
Phew... I haven't fought like that in a long time...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Littorio：</span><br>
All's well that ends well. Isn't that right, my precious sister, and Eternal Flagship of the glorious Sardegna Empire?<br>
We were able to rescue the transport ship and secure the artwork. After the Senate sees our report, we might even earn ourselves a little beach vacation.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Vittorio Veneto：</span><br>
Hmm...... You know what, that does sound pretty nice.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Littorio：</span><br>
Right? Oh, did the Senate say anything?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Vittorio Veneto：</span><br>
Quite the opposite, actually. I was told that they received the report, but I haven't been able to reach any of them.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Littorio：</span><br>
Do you think this is a side-effect from the EMP attacks we suffered in the Mirror Sea? Well, I guess there's no immediate rush to contact the Senate anyways...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Vittorio Veneto：</span><br>
Exactly. Now's the time to enjoy the company of friends. By the way, do you still happen to have some of Her Majesty's tea?<br>

<br>
A few days before the Battle of the Labyrinth...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Pamiat Merkuria：</span><br>
Yo, Snezhok, I'm here to play~<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Stremitelny ：</span><br>
Oh, hey Pamiat! Did you buy another new video game?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Pamiat Merkuria：</span><br>
Maybe I did, maybe I didn't! More importantly, how've you been?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Stremitelny ：</span><br>
Meh, it sucks that there's been no snow... No battles either, just the same old training every day.<br>
Oh, right! This is your first time here, yeah? I'll show you around if you'd like.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Pamiat Merkuria：</span><br>
Hmm... Thanks for the offer, but maybe later! My back's a bit sore from the long trip, and y'know, there's sometimes stuff you just aren't in the mood for... Next time though!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Stremitelny ：</span><br>
Next time? Are you going somewhere?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Pamiat Merkuria：</span><br>
I guess? Planning to leave tomorrow~<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Stremitelny ：</span><br>
Ehh? E-even though you're so busy, you still came to see me?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Pamiat Merkuria：</span><br>
Hehe, I'm gonna let you in on a little secret. It's been a while, but Soyuz contacted me personally to give me a mission...<br>
It's nothing complicated though~ I just have to deliver the documents in this briefcase... *yawn*<br>
But man am I beat! Maybe I'll take a little nap... after checking on any new releases...<br>

KABOOM–––––––!!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Giulio Cesare：</span><br>
What?! A Siren attack near the capital?!<br>
Where's our patrol fleet? And our coastal defenses? Why haven't we heard anything?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Pola ：</span><br>
Can't say. But since we've confirmed that the Mirror Sea in the Aegean has completely vanished, maybe it's a group of stragglers from somewhere else.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Giulio Cesare：</span><br>
We should contact the Royal Navy about this...<br>
In any case, our top priority is protecting the safety of this port. Have we sent evacuation orders for civilian ships?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Pola ：</span><br>
Already took care of that.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Giulio Cesare：</span><br>
Now, we need to figure out why our coastal installations have been sleeping on the job...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Pola ：</span><br>
I don't think we should worry about that at this point. Unlike us, the coastal artillery takes a long time to get warmed up.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Giulio Cesare：</span><br>
Just great... And even Veneto isn't here following that Mirror Sea incident...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Pola ：</span><br>
Zara and others are trying to lead the interception efforts, but we're already on the back foot. I wonder if the Sirens are directly controlling those aircraft...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Giulio Cesare：</span><br>
Damnit, I can't believe that I'm still not at full strength at such a crucial moment...<br>
But right now, the only shipgirls stationed at Civitavecchia are you and I. So it falls upon us to stop the attack.<br>
Our imperial capital emerged unscathed from the previous war against the Sirens. It would be a travesty should she be attacked now.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Pola ：</span><br>
I agree. One battleship and one heavy cruiser should be a sufficiently formidable force.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">？？？：</span><br>
Nay... Make that two battleships.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Pola ：</span><br>
Who...?! You're...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Friedrich der Große：</span><br>
The acting leader of the Iron Blood, Friedrich der Grosse.<br>
I do hope you will allow me to compose the next movement of your symphony...<br>
Ahahahaha!<br>

<br>
Royal Navy - Naval Base<br>
Illustrious, one of the Royal Navy's aircraft carriers, opened an invitation.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Illustrious：</span><br>
This invitation is from... Littorio?<br>
...a request to attend a joint meeting for cooperation between the various factions...<br>
It feels like after so long, all the differences in this world are finally being set aside...<br>
………………………………<br>
<br>
She closed the invitation and picked up another letter.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Illustrious：</span><br>
This one's from Richelieu...<br>
"It is a relief that the Iron Blood is willing to cooperate, but we must always be wary of their ulterior motives..."<br>
Is there something that the Naval HQ isn't telling us?<br>
Oh... Um, come in.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ajax：</span><br>
Sorry to interrupt. I've just received a message from the East.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Illustrious：</span><br>
From the Vichya Dominion? Or perhaps Sardegna?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ajax：</span><br>
It's from Sardegna. They say that Sirens have appeared near their capital.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Illustrious：</span><br>
Sirens... near their capital? How is that possible...?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ajax：</span><br>
I don't know what the exact situation is, but it seems they don't have the numbers to handle it...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Illustrious：</span><br>
I understand. Thanks for letting me know.<br>
I know that Littorio left to deal with the Mirror Sea that appeared in the Aegean... Will their capital be able to withstand the attack...?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Richelieu：</span><br>
"Miss Friedrich, or more accurately, the Iron Blood, is still an unknown variable to us. Even if we see eye-to-eye for the time being, I am not inclined to expose my back to them."<br>
"As a representative of Iris Libre, I can say that we would feel much safer if the Royal Navy maintained its presence in Malta to ensure the peace and stability of the Méditerranée."<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Illustrious：</span><br>
………………<br>
My, my... I wonder what we should do...<br>
