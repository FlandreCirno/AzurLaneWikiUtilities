I 「Holiday Encounter」<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Long Island：</span><br>
Huh... it's the Commander... I didn’t expect to bump into you at a place like this...<br>
I am in vacation-mode --- hehehe~ Sigh, it's too much trouble to even say “hello”. I just want to go back and nap...<br>
Talk about timing... I’ve almost run out of all the sodas in the cooler... can you help me top up my supply, Commander?<br>
Pretty please, I know my Commander won't refuse to help me...right?<br>
Then I’ll leave it up to you Commander~<br>

II 「No More Exercise!」<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Long Island：</span><br>
*Gulp gulp, munch munch*... ha! Coke and fries are such a natural pairing~<br>
Commander, do you want to try some chips?<br>
Hmm? Do I look that different?<br>
Sigh, I left my "social armor" in my dorm... it’s rare to go on vacation, so we should all unwind and relax!<br>
You want me to maintain my fitness? Umm...<br>
You want me to start right now? Hey ~ let me go ~ I want to go back ---<br>

I’m so tired that I can’t even move my body...<br>
What? I’ll also need to do intensive training?<br>
Nooo~ What about my coke.. chips... and also that soft bed and air conditioning... sigh---<br>

Hmph... don’t think that you can change my lazy nature!<br>
I’m going to be busy, so please don’t bother me ---<br>
What am I busy with? Playing, of course!<br>
Ah, since the Commander is also here, then help me take care of these things---<br>
Hehe, with the Commander's help, I don't need to go out, just as I planned~<br>

Yes! To celebrate my victory, let’s open up two more bags of chips~<br>
Th-there’s no more?!<br>
Emergency food shortage, I’m going into panic mode!<br>

Ah~ If I can always stay here like this, how great would that be... then my life would have no regrets...<br>
Hmm? C-Commander?<br>
I’ll say it here and now, I don’t plan to go outside just so you know.<br>
--- One last time? And you’ll buy me a new video game? And a new model toy?<br>
Sigh...I’ll go, I’ll go already, there goes my ideal vacation---<br>
