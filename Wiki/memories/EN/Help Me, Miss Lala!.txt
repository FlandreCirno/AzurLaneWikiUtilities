Port - Lala's Improvised Laboratory<br>
When I heard that Lala could invent things to grant any desire, I headed straight to her lab to see what was going on.<br>
But when I arrived, the place was even busier than I'd anticipated.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Akashi：</span><br>
My business isn't seeing infinite growth! Help me out with your inventions, nya!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Sirius：</span><br>
Miss Lala, I beg a moment of your time, please...!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Long Island：</span><br>
If it'll help me avoid responsibilities, then I want your help, too~<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Dupleix：</span><br>
Using Lala's genius for such things is just unthinkable. It should be put to more productive use – for work!<br>
<br>
Everyone crowding around her rattles off their demands expectantly.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Are we sure she even has an invention that can do all this stuff?<br>
Has anyone tried asking her that yet?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Lala Satalin Deviluke：</span><br>
Oh, Commander, you're here~ Sorry, I didn't notice...<br>
As for your question... Well...<br>
<br>
Hopeful eyes all hone in on her at once.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Lala Satalin Deviluke：</span><br>
Hehe... If you all tell me what you need, I think I can help~! You all put a lot of hope into me, so I don't wanna let you down!<br>
Everyone, line up over here~ Write down your needs in an orderly fashion, please~<br>
Commander~ If you don't have anything you want, could you help me with this?<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
I'd be happy to.<br>
Huh? Wait, what if I wanted something...?<br>

<br>
We finish and deliver the invention meant to help with Sirius's problem.<br>
A few days later, she invites the two of us to her ultimate dinner.<br>
Frankly, I have enough experience with that maid that I'm not ready to let my guard down yet.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Lala Satalin Deviluke：</span><br>
What's wrong, Commander? You look pale~<br>
Don't you worry~ My Bubbly-Boily Chef invention permeates into the food and cooks it at a molecular level.<br>
In theory, it should be able to cook perfectly!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Sirius：</span><br>
My honourable Master. Miss Lala. Thank you both for coming to partake in the meal that I have chosen to stake my honour on.<br>
<br>
Sirius approaches, pushing a cart with foods lined up on it.<br>
When she opens the lid, an odd-colored gas spills out. Meanwhile, the plate itself is empty.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Smells good... Hm? Where's the food?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Sirius：</span><br>
Wh-what...? The food I prepared has disappeared?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Lala Satalin Deviluke：</span><br>
Ahahaha... Okay, so Bubbly-Boily Chef really did work at a molecular level. I guess that gas from before WAS the whole meal...<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Looks like you have no choice but to learn the old-fashioned way. Good luck with that!<br>

<br>
Lala and I visit the shopping area to give Akashi her completed invention.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
(I just hope that furball doesn't use it for evil...)<br>
<br>
The following evening, I'm so beside myself with worry that I bring Lala to the unusually busy shopping area.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Lala Satalin Deviluke：</span><br>
Ooh. My invention lets Akashi know what customers are thinking, so she can advertise more effectively than ever before! And it sure looks like it's working!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Akashi：</span><br>
Nya~ Commander and Lala, nya! Thanks to you, sales are up like never before, nya!<br>
This bad boy gives me hidden customer insights that let me scalp... ahem, adjust prices on the fly, nya!<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
I knew you were up to no good.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Akashi：</span><br>
Nuh-uh! This is a perfectly legal price adjustment, nya!<br>
<br>
"WARNING! WARNING! Prices at this location may be 95% higher than average!"<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Akashi：</span><br>
Wh-what the hell?!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Lala Satalin Deviluke：</span><br>
I think the Sales Boosta-Bot is picking up customers' dissatisfaction and automatically broadcasting it out loud~<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Akashi：</span><br>
Th-this is real bad, nya! Lala, shut this thing up right now, nya!<br>
D-dearest customers, don't listen to it! This is all a huge misunderstanding, nyaaa!<br>

<br>
When it's time to give Long Island her invention, Lala is unusually hesitant.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Lala Satalin Deviluke：</span><br>
Hey, so... This spray makes it so people gradually stop perceiving you. Don't overuse it, okay?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Long Island：</span><br>
Okaaaay. I'm a ghost anyway, so it's fine~ Thanks, you two~<br>
Heheh, now I can game all day without a care in the world!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Lala Satalin Deviluke：</span><br>
Oh, she already left... Maybe I should've stopped her and explained it better?<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
I wouldn't worry about it. Let her do something stupid, and she'll learn her lesson... hopefully.<br>
<br>
Some days later, I'm wandering around the port with Lala when we happen upon a strange building.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Hmm...? A vacant house? It's a total mess, too.<br>
Manga, candy wrappers, game consoles... Whose is this?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">???：</span><br>
C-Comm–...!<br>
<br>
Thinking I'd just heard a voice, I search the room until, suddenly, my foot hits something.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Lala Satalin Deviluke：</span><br>
Oh... Wait, my Sneaky-Stealthy Prowler? Why is that here?<br>
Huh. I think I let someone borrow it... Ack! It's empty already?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">???：</span><br>
H-help...! M-my ghostly form...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Lala Satalin Deviluke：</span><br>
That's bad. When you use too much of this stuff, people don't just stop perceiving you. They forget you entirely...<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
So this place belongs to whoever you gave the spray to? And we've already forgotten whoever it was?<br>
That IS bad. What in the world do we do now?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Lala Satalin Deviluke：</span><br>
Hmm... Sneaky-Stealthy Prowler's effects do wear off over time, so they should return to normal eventually.<br>
Oh, well! Let's get outta here.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Yeah. Knowing Long Island, she won't learn until she regrets something.<br>
...Hm? Long Island...?<br>

<br>
Lala and I successfully deliver the All Work, All Play Robot to Dupleix.<br>
Days later, when I'm walking through the hallway, Fleuret screams about an emergency, seizes my arm, and drags me to my office.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Fleuret：</span><br>
She was really excited to do her secretary work ahead of time, but she ended up like... this.<br>
<br>
Her voice quivers.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Dupleix：</span><br>
Commandeeer... Hehehee... Work is fun... Sooo much fun...<br>
All this work and nothing else... I don't have to think, it's just work, work, work...<br>
Do nothing... but work until your arms fall off...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Le Malin：</span><br>
Commander, you have to help her.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">L'Audacieux：</span><br>
Why... Why is she making us work overtime with her?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Épée：</span><br>
I can't take it anymore... I'm sorry...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Dupleix：</span><br>
Oh, Commander? And Fleuret, too? Did you both come to help us?<br>
I've been at this for fifty hours without a single break. It's just so fun, so very fun...<br>
Come, everyone... Join in the fun...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Fleuret：</span><br>
This is bad... She's broken! You have to stop her!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Dupleix：</span><br>
I won't let you! Work with meee!<br>
<br>
Right on cue, the All Work, All Play Robot lets out a puff of white smoke as it breaks from the stress.<br>
Dupleix falls face-first onto the desk and loses consciousness. A blissful smile on her face is the only remaining sign of life.<br>
I warily approach and examine her. Unsurprisingly, she fainted from overwork.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Okay... I'll go call Perseus and the others to come get her.<br>

<br>
Some days after we'd given Owari the plant growth-inducing Speedy Sprouty Botanist invention, she invited us to dinner.<br>
Lala and I arrive on time at our prearranged meeting spot.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Owari：</span><br>
Hey, c'mon in! I brought a truckload of fresh vegetables!<br>
That Speedy Sprouty Botanist had them growin' hella fast!<br>
Big thankies, Lala~♪<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Lala Satalin Deviluke：</span><br>
Hehe, it's my pleasure! How'd they come out?<br>
<br>
Owari removes the white cloth hanging over the table, revealing vegetables of awe-inspiring size.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Owari：</span><br>
Heheh♪ I'm gonna cook these bad boys for the two of ya!<br>
<br>
She picks up a cooking knife and tries to cut a massive carrot.<br>
But as she does, the carrot flashes bright and grows to twice its size in one spurt.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
What in the world...?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Lala Satalin Deviluke：</span><br>
Oh, no... Did I set the speedy sprouty frequency too high?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Owari：</span><br>
Huh? Whaddya mean?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Lala Satalin Deviluke：</span><br>
Umm... It might not be done growing.<br>
<br>
Even as we speak, the veggies on the table double and triple in size. The sheer weight of them breaks the poor table, sending them careening onto the floor.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Lala Satalin Deviluke：</span><br>
Aaaah! Commander, get everyone from the port here, pronto! We're gonna have to eat our way out of this one!<br>
Otherwise... They might never stop!<br>

<br>
Bristol left with a big smile and the Spooky, Scary Specter.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Lala Satalin Deviluke：</span><br>
Nice! Bristol was really happy with that one... Huh? Commander, is it just me, or do you look super concerned?<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
I'm not sure how to put this. Uh... It's really hard to say this, but...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Lala Satalin Deviluke：</span><br>
Geez, quit worrying so much~! The effective range is only around the user, and I added a limit to its power output!<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Okay. I just hope nothing bad happens...<br>
<br>
Days later, I'm discussing other requests with Lala in my office.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Hmm? Lala, did you feel that just now? It's like something changed.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Lala Satalin Deviluke：</span><br>
Really? I didn't feel anything...<br>
<br>
A cold air blows through the office, and everything around me suddenly changes.<br>
My previously bright office dims all at once. Spider webs and eerie fog fill my vision.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Lala, we should go look outside...<br>
<br>
But when I leave, nothing changes.<br>
Dark skies, endless fog, spider webs... accompanied by a faint, yet bone-chilling sobbing in the distance.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Z43：</span><br>
Urgh... The power of darkness encroaches now upon this land... I-I will not abide by it!<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Z43? What're you doing here?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Z43：</span><br>
C-C-Commander?! Awawah... I-it got scary here out of nowhere!<br>
I mean! Uh, Augur of Destiny... We must escape before the dark engulfs us once and for all!<br>
<br>
As if on cue, Bristol appears, cradling the glowing Spooky, Scary Specter.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Bristol：</span><br>
Hm? Commander and Lala? Z43, too? Great timing! You all should come investigate the mysteries of the port with me!<br>
Heheh, the vibe's just right, isn't it? Feel that gust of cold air – ouchie!<br>
<br>
I promptly confiscate the Spooky, Scary Specter and return it to Lala. After Z43 and I have given the culprit a firm tongue-lashing, peace returns to the port.<br>

<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Queen Elizabeth：</span><br>
Hmm? So this is the invention meant to enhance my royal charisma?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Lala Satalin Deviluke：</span><br>
Yep! It's my newly completed More-y Glory Aura Booster~<br>
Wear this, and you'll glow all the time as proof of your majesty!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Queen Elizabeth：</span><br>
Oh, really? Why, it sounds perfect.<br>
Very well! I shall test it at once!<br>
<br>
When she puts the More-y Glory Aura Booster on her head, soft light surrounds her.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Queen Elizabeth：</span><br>
Ohohoho~ Simply magnificent. I love it!<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
(Is this one just a light source? Surely that can't cause any problems...)<br>
<br>
That night, Lala and I are arranging our list of requests as of late.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
It's getting late – you have to be tired by now. Go home and get some rest, would you?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Lala Satalin Deviluke：</span><br>
I'm fine~! This is giving me lots of interesting data, and it's still not dark outside...<br>
Wait, what? It's REALLY late. Why is it not dark yet?<br>
<br>
The door to my office is thrown open. A humanoid avatar of pure light enters.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Lala Satalin Deviluke：</span><br>
Aaack! Too bright!<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
My eyes... My eyes!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Queen Elizabeth：</span><br>
What's the matter? Covering your eyes before a queen is hardly polite!<br>
<br>
It took a while to get our little queen to give up on her noble ideal of "letting the port bathe in the queen's light, day or night."<br>
After we'd adjusted the More-y Glory Aura Booster to a more appropriate brightness level, the sun had finally set on the port once more.<br>
