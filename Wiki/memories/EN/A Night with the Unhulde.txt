A Night with the Unhulde<br>
<br>
1 The Unhulde's Invitation<br>
Port - Office<br>
Having finished a good chunk of my accumulated paperwork, I stop and take a breather. That's when I hear a knock on the door.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Come in.<br>
<br>
The door slowly opens, and August von Parseval steps in.<br>
In her hand is a black envelope adorned with golden highlights. She approaches me with a graceful gait, the look in her eyes a bit more implicative than usual.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">August von Parseval：</span><br>
Just as I thought. You have time on your hands.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
What brings you here?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">August von Parseval：</span><br>
The stars of fate will intersect tomorrow night. Take this, and give me your answer.<br>
<br>
She presents the envelope to me. The luxurious paper gives off a mysterious smell.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
What is this? An invitation?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">August von Parseval：</span><br>
For you, my familiar. Dare you to undertake destiny's ritual?<br>
<br>
I manage to decipher the contents of the invitation, albeit after some effort.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
So, if I understand this right, you want to go camping with me, right?<br>
Something about this tells me it's no regular camping trip, though.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">August von Parseval：</span><br>
Would I take such elaborate measures, were it a regular wilderness excursion?<br>
<br>
With grace, she sits down on a chair opposite me and gently runs her fingers through her long hair.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">August von Parseval：</span><br>
Perhaps you consider it a mere leisure activity.<br>
To me, however, it is an ideal opportunity to guide you to your destiny.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
That doesn't sound very laid-back.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">August von Parseval：</span><br>
I have said nothing suggesting thusly.<br>
Will you join me on this occasion? You've yet to decline.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Yeah, I'll come along.<br>
Question, though – if we're going camping, don't we need to pack a lot of stuff?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">August von Parseval：</span><br>
Don't worry about that. I've already composed a list of all the items we will need.<br>
We will go on a shopping trip tomorrow morning.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Wow. You really came prepared.<br>
Were you that sure I was going to say "yes"?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">August von Parseval：</span><br>
I do not make erroneous predictions.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Clearly not, as proven right here.<br>
Just to be clear, do I really not need to bring anything beyond what's on the list?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">August von Parseval：</span><br>
There is one thing. Bring high expectations.<br>
High expectations for the unknown and the destiny that's to come.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Okay then... What time do we meet up?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">August von Parseval：</span><br>
Tomorrow, six in the morning. By the gates.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Six? That's pretty early.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">August von Parseval：</span><br>
I'm not partial to the sun rising too high. It stifles the whispers of the stars.<br>
<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项1：Alright. Just don't be late.</span>'''''<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项2：Okay, then that's everything.</span>'''''<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项1）</span>'''''Alright. Just don't be late.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">August von Parseval：</span><br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项1）</span>'''''How could I call myself a guide if I were late to my own rendezvous? You need only keep up with me.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项1）</span>'''''"Guide"? So you'll be handling everything for me? Somehow, that sounds a bit risky.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">August von Parseval：</span><br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项1）</span>'''''Risk is, after all, the spice of destiny.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项2）</span>'''''Okay, then that's everything.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">August von Parseval：</span><br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项2）</span>'''''Ah, you're using my title now, "Commander."<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项2）</span>'''''You've taken to your role quite well, I see.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项2）</span>'''''Just trying to keep up with you, like you asked.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">August von Parseval：</span><br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项2）</span>'''''Of course. This is why I find you so amusing.<br>
<br>
August gets up and gives me a small smile as she leaves my office.<br>
A whiff of her eternally lingering scent lights inside my heart a spark of anticipation for the mystic journey ahead.<br>

<br>
A Night with the Unhulde<br>
<br>
2 The Unhulde's Trial<br>
It's the next day. I arrive on time at the place where August told me to meet her.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">August von Parseval：</span><br>
Your proactiveness has not escaped my notice.<br>
Well done, my "Commander," my familiar.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Wouldn't wanna disappoint you after such a painstaking invitation.<br>
<br>
We exchange some light jests as we head to the shopping district together.<br>
The streets are lined with stores that just opened for the day. The smells of the sea and freshly baked bread mingle in the air.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
What are we buying first?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">August von Parseval：</span><br>
Our first item: A starlight collector.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
The... The what now?<br>
I kind of assumed we'd just be buying regular camping stuff.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">August von Parseval：</span><br>
What do you think it is, then?<br>
<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项1：A small generator?</span>'''''<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项2：Maybe a telescope?</span>'''''<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项1）</span>'''''A small generator?<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项1）</span>'''''That'll give us access to a light source other than the stars.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">August von Parseval：</span><br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项1）</span>'''''An overly pragmatic guess.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项2）</span>'''''Maybe a telescope?<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项2）</span>'''''A telescope lens collects starlight. It makes sense.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">August von Parseval：</span><br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项2）</span>'''''It does not. A telescope does not collect starlight, it gazes at it.<br>
<br>
There is a hint of amusement in her voice, almost like she enjoys seeing me confused.<br>
Whilst I ponder if there's anything that fits the bill better, she elegantly turns on her heel and heads into a shop specializing in illumination.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Will we find the answer in there?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">August von Parseval：</span><br>
Follow me.<br>
<br>
She walks up to a display shelf and goes straight for a nightlight that glows like stardust. As she holds it, the soft light illuminates her delicate hand.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">August von Parseval：</span><br>
Starlight exists not to brighten up the night, but rather to linger in the memory of a certain someone.<br>
A certain someone who is willing to approach the stars and understand them.<br>
Such a light is just right.<br>
<br>
She expresses a sentiment that's hard to put into words while she hands the nightlight to me.<br>
I look at it for a while, then something dawns on me.<br>
Esoteric though her phrasing may be, I'm starting to grasp her sense for naming things.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">August von Parseval：</span><br>
Next item: An effulgence of bygone days.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Uhh...<br>
You mean like this antique oil lantern?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">August von Parseval：</span><br>
Not a bad suggestion.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Huh. Have to say, I find your riddles surprisingly fun.<br>
You might even call them "the Unhulde's trials."<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">August von Parseval：</span><br>
Ah, so you've grown accustomed to my manner of speech.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
I like taking on intellectually stimulating tasks.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">August von Parseval：</span><br>
"Taking on"? No. What you're doing is being guided by me.<br>
While I do not attempt to forcibly change anyone's way of thinking, I do lovingly impart teachings to those who come to me.<br>
<br>
We continued shopping for a while, and I kept guessing what her extravagantly named items really were, with some hits and some misses.<br>
After half a day of touring the district, we've now finally procured everything on the list.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
The "eye of the abyss" is black velvet with an eye pattern, and the "echo of fate" is a string of bells...<br>
Hey, are we really prepping for a camping trip here?<br>
If anything, this looks more like a shopping list for some occult ritual.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">August von Parseval：</span><br>
At times, even stars must surround themselves with ashes for their light to stand out more.<br>
What you do not yet know is how their visages appear in the night.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
So you're gonna keep me waiting until night before I "see the light"?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">August von Parseval：</span><br>
No. I will have your undivided attention until then.<br>
<br>
With a relaxed expression, she adjusts my collar before grazing the back of my neck with a cold fingertip.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">August von Parseval：</span><br>
Even something as pedestrian as a camping trip can mayhaps be the starting point of a contract.<br>
<br>
The sunlight gently adds a contour to her side profile, on the lips of which a mysterious smile sits.<br>
All of a sudden, I look forward to seeing the "visage the stars show in the night" to an absurd degree.<br>

<br>
A Night with the Unhulde<br>
<br>
3 The Destined Spot<br>
Having finished our shopping, August and I went to the suburbs.<br>
The hustle and bustle of the city gradually grew distant while the landscape got filled with gentle hills and dense forests.<br>
We come to a stop at an unremarkable, narrow path. There are no signs or guideposts.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Is this the place?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">August von Parseval：</span><br>
Yes. From here and onward, we will have to walk.<br>
Not that I expect you'll get cold feet after coming all this way.<br>
<br>
She walks up to a small road hidden under the shadow of the trees.<br>
A tangle of foliage hangs overhead. The sunlight leaking through the gaps draws a patchwork on her fair skin.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
This place is getting more barren with each step...<br>
You're not gonna pick a campsite randomly, are you?<br>
<br>
She comes to a sudden stop, turns around, and pinches my chin.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">August von Parseval：</span><br>
Casting doubt upon the Unhulde incurs a punishment.<br>
I have, in fact, chosen a location in advance.<br>
The stars of fate will intersect tonight, and I alone can witness this.<br>
You need only come along for the journey.<br>
<br>
After cutting through the woods, our visibility suddenly gets much better.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Talk about a pretty sight. Guessing this is the spot you chose.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">August von Parseval：</span><br>
I'll take that to mean you like it, my familiar.<br>
This is an elevated location, surrounded by trees while simultaneously providing ample space.<br>
Look over yonder – we have an uninterrupted view of the lake.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
It's more open than I pictured it.<br>
Basically the perfect place to enjoy the view.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">August von Parseval：</span><br>
"Enjoy" – yes, now you've touched upon why we came here.<br>
To enjoy ourselves, and more specifically, enjoy the crossing of fates tonight.<br>
We will be the sole beholders of one another's fate.<br>
<br>
Slowly, she walks to the center of the clearing and stretches her arms out, as if gesturing for the curtains of fate to rise.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">August von Parseval：</span><br>
Listen. The wind has started to whisper.<br>
Once the veil of night falls, you will understand its voice.<br>
<br>
This remark of hers reminds me that we'll be staying the night here.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Well, I can't complain about the view...<br>
But we're far, far from civilization out here.<br>
You sure staying here is a good idea?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">August von Parseval：</span><br>
Is safety your concern?<br>
Your safety, in particular. I have to keep you safe.<br>
Remember, the fates are about to cross. Not just anyone is qualified to witness it.<br>
Even if, as you worry, someone would come and disturb us...<br>
It is not we who should be alarmed, but rather the disturber.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
...Alright. I'll trust you on this.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">August von Parseval：</span><br>
Rest assured. This place is for you and me alone tonight.<br>
<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项1：Just for us...</span>'''''<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项2：As you say.</span>'''''<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项1）</span>'''''Just for us...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">August von Parseval：</span><br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项1）</span>'''''Very good. Now, I have a reward for you. For being such an excellent familiar.<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项1）</span>'''''I will allow you to attend to me closely throughout the entirety of the process ahead of us.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项2）</span>'''''As you say.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">August von Parseval：</span><br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项2）</span>'''''Very good. Obedience does at times symbolize not yielding to authority, but rather trusting in your partner.<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项2）</span>'''''Destiny will answer those who seek it out, and I never lead anyone astray.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">August von Parseval：</span><br>
Now, let us start building our temporary dwelling – or I should say, our camp.<br>

<br>
A Night with the Unhulde<br>
<br>
4 Place That Lights the Stars<br>
I finish looking around the campsite, put down my backpack, and start setting things up.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Do we start with the tent?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">August von Parseval：</span><br>
Yes. Somewhere around here. It will be your "stage."<br>
<br>
August points to where to erect the tent and hands me a stack of materials.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Wow, this is a novel tent. It can't have been easy to find.<br>
<br>
The tent's textile is covered with esoteric and complex patterns, its rim is fitted with antique gold thread, and it even has small spangles woven in.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">August von Parseval：</span><br>
It will be our dwelling for a brief time.<br>
It will also be a world dedicated solely to us tonight.<br>
Which is to say, be thorough in setting it up, my "Commander."<br>
<br>
I spread the cloth just as she instructs, hammer in the pegs, and build out the frame.<br>
Once the main part is done, I also put down a ground sheet, a layer of waterproof cloth, and set up a simple window screen.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
You're quiet all of a sudden. What's up?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">August von Parseval：</span><br>
I'm simply carrying out my duty.<br>
<br>
I exit the tent and find that the campsite has undergone radical change.<br>
There are flowers and nightlights spread around everywhere, lending the place an irregular yet mysterious beauty.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
You've got a reliable and proven aesthetic sense.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">August von Parseval：</span><br>
The stars tonight will not shine upon the banal.<br>
For that reason, I need to make the campsite suitably worthy of their light.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
I suppose I'll have to deal with spending the night without incandescent light.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">August von Parseval：</span><br>
You should also be grateful that the stars will shine for you tonight.<br>
<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项1：Then I will.</span>'''''<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项2：Alright, if you insist.</span>'''''<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项1）</span>'''''Then I will.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项2）</span>'''''Alright, if you insist.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">August von Parseval：</span><br>
Good. Destiny more kindly greets those who look forward to it.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Okay, so what do we do next?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">August von Parseval：</span><br>
Go gather some rocks. We're going to make a domain.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
A domain?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">August von Parseval：</span><br>
My domain, yes. Once it's complete, no outside noise will be able to disturb us.<br>
<br>
I both trust and distrust her plan, but since it's not particularly hard work, I did as instructed.<br>
Meanwhile, she took the nightlights and the velvet we bought today and used them to decorate the campsite.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
This is one elaborate ritual you're setting up.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">August von Parseval：</span><br>
It's only for tonight. You'll be glad later that I didn't skip a single step.<br>
<br>
I stand at the edge of the campsite surrounded by flowers, stones, and lights, and I look at her.<br>
The sun is setting behind her, and it looks almost like the whole campsite – or even, this entire place – has become her domain.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">August von Parseval：</span><br>
Almost done. The domain boundary has been set and the points and lines have been linked.<br>
However... there is still one crucial thing missing. Without it, this domain will not be truly complete.<br>

<br>
A Night with the Unhulde<br>
<br>
5 The Unhulde's Domain<br>
The sun sets on the westerly horizon, draping the whole campsite in golden light.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Do you smell that? Something's in the air.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">August von Parseval：</span><br>
I'm burning aromatic oils.<br>
It's a mixture of medicinal herbs and resin. Old and calming.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Smells a bit odd, but you're right – it is calming.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">August von Parseval：</span><br>
Scent is the magic that makes people mingle.<br>
Moreover, it makes you feel like this place is more than just a campsite, doesn't it?<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
That's true. Like you said earlier, it's missing some crucial thing, though.<br>
<br>
I look around the campsite.<br>
We have a tent, our essential camping supplies form a neat stack, and the flowers encircling the camp add a soft color as the cherry on top.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
On the surface, we have everything we could possibly need.<br>
So what is it that's missing?<br>
<br>
This place has symbols, a campfire, stones, and vines. It's all here, and yet, the full picture isn't complete.<br>
The scene feels like a full painting ready to come to life, but there's not a single sound.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">August von Parseval：</span><br>
It seems you've figured it out.<br>
Color, smell, form, light – those are all here.<br>
If there is a single thing missing, it would have to be...<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Sound, I'm guessing.<br>
<br>
She produces a velvet bag, prudently undoes the knot, and then takes out a couple of silver bells.<br>
They're all fairly small and have minute patterns engraved on their surfaces, which reflect a cold light.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">August von Parseval：</span><br>
These are no mere ornaments. They are musical anchors, so to speak.<br>
Each and every one of their syllables will summon an echo of fate.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Where are you gonna hang them?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">August von Parseval：</span><br>
In the four cardinal directions. Each somewhere where the wind blows.<br>
The wind ringing the bells will awaken this domain.<br>
<br>
She hangs a bell in all four corners of the camp.<br>
As soon as she hangs the last one, a gentle wind blows by, and the bells start ringing one by one with a clear sound.<br>
First there is one sound, then another – they resonate with each other, creating a rhythm. It's like some sort of signal from space.<br>
<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项1：So... has the ritual started?</span>'''''<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项2：You really prepared a lot for this.</span>'''''<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项1）</span>'''''So... has the ritual started?<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项2）</span>'''''You really prepared a lot for this.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">August von Parseval：</span><br>
The domain has been made.<br>
There will be no turning back once you step forward. Are you ready, Commander?<br>
<br>
The bells continue ringing without end. She stands at the center of the campsite, a mysterious smile on her face.<br>
Her figure is bathed in golden light and encased in a strange aura. It really is like she's standing in a domain of her own making.<br>
I don't even stop to ask a question, I simply walk toward her.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">August von Parseval：</span><br>

<br>
A Night with the Unhulde<br>
<br>
6 The Unhulde's Feast<br>
Seizing the fading glow of sunset, August and I started making food.<br>
She did most of the cooking, while I committed myself to a more supporting role.<br>
She spread out a tablecloth with a star map motif and placed down one dish after the next. Her motions were careful at every step, almost like she was performing a ritual.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Will dinner also be in your signature esoteric style?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">August von Parseval：</span><br>
Naturally. I'd loathe to break up the mood tonight.<br>
<br>
She takes out a bottle of jam from the basket and spreads it thinly on her rye bread, then covers it with a few slices of some purple vegetable I don't recognize.<br>
Meanwhile, the fruit and meat stew in the pot simmers quietly. It smells rich, with a dash of the unknown mixed in.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
The soup smells like... I don't even know what.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">August von Parseval：</span><br>
It's the flavor of destiny.<br>
There's sweetness amid the acidity, and it's soft, yet prickly – much like the distance between us tonight.<br>
<br>
She takes out a glass bottle with an antique shape and pours its contents into a cup.<br>
The liquid is deep crimson. It looks like blood under the light of the campfire.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">August von Parseval：</span><br>
And this is the blood of the stars. Drink it and rejoice. I made it myself.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
I don't like the dangerous ring that name has.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">August von Parseval：</span><br>
With danger comes rewards – nothing ventured, nothing gained.<br>
<br>
Once she's done preparing everything, she presents me with the first dish.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">August von Parseval：</span><br>
Enjoy, my "Commander." You'll hurt my feelings if you won't even have one bite.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Uh... Just asking to make sure: All the ingredients ARE edible, right?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">August von Parseval：</span><br>
That is unimportant. What matters is that those who eat this will be etched into the Unhulde's memory.<br>
Granted, you already are – but still, there is no wriggling your way out of this.<br>
<br>
The corners of her lips curl upward ever so slightly. Her voice carries that familiar blend of danger and kindness.<br>
The campfire's light is reflected in her eyes, twinkling quietly like the stars above.<br>
I accept the food – black bread with jam spread on top – and take a bite.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
It's... actually pretty good.<br>
<br>
Next, I have a spoonful of the meat soup.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
The meat flavor really comes through, and the freshness of the fruit meshes well with it.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">August von Parseval：</span><br>
Did you perchance think the Unhulde would give you food poisoning?<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
No, but I thought the herbs and weird jam you prepared were going to make me hallucinate or something.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">August von Parseval：</span><br>
Well then, do you think what I'm doing now is a hallucination?<br>
<br>
She runs her delicate fingers along my cheek and lips, leaving them with a lingering warmth.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
...No.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">August von Parseval：</span><br>
I'm pleased.<br>
I was all but certain you'd refuse to touch the food.<br>
Many flinch at the first sight of them, but you didn't.<br>
<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项1：I must be under a spell.</span>'''''<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项2：That's because I trust you.</span>'''''<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项1）</span>'''''I must be under a spell.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">August von Parseval：</span><br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项1）</span>'''''Even if you are, it's a spell that you chose to receive.<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项1）</span>'''''You've never belonged to the mundane rabble.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项2）</span>'''''That's because I trust you.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">August von Parseval：</span><br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项2）</span>'''''Trust, you say?<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项2）</span>'''''I see. Still, you'd be wise to remember this: Once you start, it's hard to stop with "trust" alone.<br>
<br>
She pours the "blood of the stars" into my cup. Forebodingly, yet elegantly, the red liquid shakes.<br>
We cling our silver glasses together, and they produce a clear sound.<br>
I taste the suspicious drink. The first thing that hits me is a fruity sweetness, then a faint bitterness. It leaves an indescribable aftertaste on the tip of my tongue.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
I've never tasted anything like this before.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">August von Parseval：</span><br>
This flavor was made specifically for this night and for you.<br>
<br>
She leans closer, either probing me for a reaction or overtly cutting the distance between us.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">August von Parseval：</span><br>
Dinner is over, my familiar.<br>
Now, let us head into the galaxy.<br>

<br>
A Night with the Unhulde<br>
<br>
7 Into the Galaxy<br>
The sun has completely set over the horizon and the curtain of night has descended.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">August von Parseval：</span><br>
The time has come to change the light.<br>
<br>
She claps lightly two times, and the light sources all around the tent go out one by one.<br>
Everything turns black, almost like the darkness itself has answered her summons. Even the wind seems to stop on August's command.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Is it finally time for your ritual?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">August von Parseval：</span><br>
Yes. Close your eyes and accustom yourself to the dark.<br>
<br>
I close them gently and I sense that she's coming closer. I sit down, and she does the same.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">August von Parseval：</span><br>
Now slowly open them again, my familiar. The stars have lit up for us.<br>
<br>
The vast night sky stretches on above. The stars seem so close it feels like I could reach out and touch them.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">August von Parseval：</span><br>
Give me your hand.<br>
<br>
The touch of her hand is soft and cool – it's like the light of the stars on my skin.<br>
She points up at the sky, toward one star in particular.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">August von Parseval：</span><br>
That is the first star. Remember it.<br>
That's the second, and that one... a little more to the left.<br>
<br>
She points to one, then another, connecting them like she's weaving a thread high up above.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">August von Parseval：</span><br>
This is Corona Borealis.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
It looks like... a crown made of stars.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">August von Parseval：</span><br>
That's precisely what it is.<br>
According to an old myth, it was a gift from Dionysus, the god of wine, to his lover.<br>
It shines with a light that is not of this world and only appears during the night.<br>
<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项1：We must be really lucky to see it tonight.</span>'''''<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项2：What if I were to take it?</span>'''''<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项1）</span>'''''I suppose we should count our lucky stars for that.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">August von Parseval：</span><br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项1）</span>'''''What's even luckier for you is that I'm here, watching the stars right by your side.<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项1）</span>'''''Etch this good fortune into your memory, my familiar.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项2）</span>'''''What if I were to take it?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">August von Parseval：</span><br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项2）</span>'''''Well, I wouldn't stop you, I know that much.<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项2）</span>'''''You are my familiar. You deserve everything.<br>
<br>
She suddenly shifts away a bit and tilts her body, looking for an angle to the sky.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">August von Parseval：</span><br>
This crown is yours now.<br>
Tonight, I will be the one to crown you.<br>
<br>
Her fingertips grace my forehead.<br>
It's as if something actually fell from the skies, and she's carefully adjusting it between my eyebrows.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">August von Parseval：</span><br>
Others may try to approach, but the stars will not respond – they only do so for the chosen.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Did the stars choose me, or did you?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">August von Parseval：</span><br>
Why not both?<br>
<br>
She runs her fingers along my cheek, gently stopping at the very tip of my jaw.<br>
Her gaze pierces through my body like a stake.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">August von Parseval：</span><br>
You don't seem intent... on running away.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
You wouldn't give me the chance to in the first place.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">August von Parseval：</span><br>
Ah, my familiar has learned to struggle.<br>
Now I'm all the more eager to see what becomes of you after I make you fully submit.<br>
How far will you take things tonight? The decision is all yours.<br>
<br>
All of a sudden, the starlight pouring down on us is starting to warm me up.<br>
