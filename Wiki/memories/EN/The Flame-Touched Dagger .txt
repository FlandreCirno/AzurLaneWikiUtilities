Vichya Dominion - Naval Port<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Algérie：</span><br>
It seems Sardegna has become part of the Crimson Axis... In line with what we expected.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Foch：</span><br>
The battlefield is always changing, and an ally of yesterday may become your enemy tomorrow...<br>
They say man is bound to unknowingly repeat history forever. Maybe they're not entirely wrong.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Algérie：</span><br>
I wish they'd at least keep up the pretense of neutrality. We don't want to get into an all-out war...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Foch：</span><br>
What can you do? What's done is done.<br>
What's up with you lately anyway, Algérie? I rarely see you this serious.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Algérie：</span><br>
As opposed to what? Do I normally come across as a jokester?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Foch：</span><br>
Haha, of course not. I guess I'm just used to seeing you always be elegant and composed, in control of any situation.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Algérie：</span><br>
Don't tease me like that. Given the importance of this operation, I think it deserves at least a little gravitas.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Foch：</span><br>
Can't argue with that. On that note, can you guess why I'm here?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Algérie：</span><br>
I don't know, can I?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Foch：</span><br>
Knowing you, I'm sure you already have a hunch.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Algérie：</span><br>
How about... HQ has decided to respond to Sardegna's sudden fall to the Crimson Axis with a show of force?<br>
And you're part of the group tasked with staging an assault on them?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Foch：</span><br>
Dang, it's scary how on-point that guess is... Nothing gets past you, huh?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Algérie：</span><br>
It's not hard to figure out the broad strokes when you're involved. But what, exactly, are you going to do?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Foch：</span><br>
It's very simple. We're going to bombard an important port.<br>
We've pinpointed one of their naval arteries based on the movements of their capital ships. That's the one we'll strike.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Algérie：</span><br>
The plan is to cut off their supply lines and render their strongest ships inoperable. Fairly waterproof, if you ask me.<br>
Do we have the Royal Navy backing us?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Foch：</span><br>
Nope. I can summarize the message they sent us.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Algérie：</span><br>
What did they say?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Foch：</span><br>
"Based upon the current situation, we do not have the ability to commit our forces to unplanned operations before the arrival of additional support."<br>
"Please consider your operation plans carefully and do not act hastily."<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Algérie：</span><br>
I see. And what of our intel?<br>
I know this plan's fairly urgent, but surely they didn't have to send a strategist like you to the front lines...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Foch：</span><br>
Haha, it's best to not overthink things. The top brass operates in mysterious ways, and a lot of that is going to be beyond us.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Algérie：</span><br>
...Fair enough. I guess it really is up to us.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Foch：</span><br>
We'll be fine! After all, we're the best out there when it comes to taking care of business!<br>
Approach danger with a cool head, and lead cautiously! We've got a formula for success, and just have to follow through with it!<br>
As a strategist, I tried to put together a plan with the greatest chance for success...<br>
But ultimately, an operation like this isn't something a single person can come up with.<br>
And besides–– maybe I prefer slugging it out rather than planning from behind the scenes~?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Algérie：</span><br>
All right. So, when do we begin?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Foch：</span><br>
We'll set sail in the evening, and attack under the cover of darkness. We'll be gone before they know what hit them.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Algérie：</span><br>
Understood. I'm looking forward to seeing what you're capable of, Miss Strategist. Hehe~<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Foch：</span><br>
Haha, you're gonna make me blush...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Algérie：</span><br>
If you like it so much, maybe I'll call you that instead of Foch from now on~<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Foch：</span><br>
Uhh, I think I'll pass on that!<br>

<br>
With the sun setting behind them, the fleet departed for their target.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Algérie：</span><br>
I do wonder how Sardegna will respond... If we're lucky, they won't even get the chance to.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Foch：</span><br>
Mhm. Fingers crossed they don't catch on to us, or we'll lose the element of surprise.<br>
In any case, as long as we can disrupt their operations, the mission will at least be a partial success.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Algérie：</span><br>
What must we do for total success, then?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Foch：</span><br>
Do as much damage a possible.<br>
Of course, that won't be possible unless we get there unnoticed.<br>
Until then, we'd better stay on our guards. Lead the way, Algérie!<br>

<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Algérie：</span><br>
Oh dear... Foch! Enemy fleet, incoming!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Foch：</span><br>
What?! A Sardegnian fleet?<br>
Oh man... Just our luck, running into a patrol here of all places!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Algérie：</span><br>
Calm down. Our cover hasn't been blown just yet.<br>
They won't have a chance to sound the alarm if we just neutralize them first!<br>
<span style="color:#ec5d53;">Trento：</span><br>
Are you... Vichya ships? What are you doing here? There's not supposed to be any major fleet movement tonight...<br>
Unless... you're here to stage an attack?!<br>
Sorry, but your naughty little plan isn't going to happen on my watch!<br>
<br>
BOOOOOM!<br>
<span style="color:#ec5d53;">Trento：</span><br>
My firepower may not be what it once was, but it's still capable of puncturing armor!<br>
{{折叠面板|内容结束}}

{{折叠面板|标题=The Approach|选项=4|主框=1|样式=primary|展开=否}}
<span style="color:#ec5d53;">Trento：</span><br>
Ugh...!<br>
Even though I did everything I could...<br>
No... I have to stop you, no matter...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Algérie：</span><br>
My, she put up much more of a fight than I anticipated.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Foch：</span><br>
It's praiseworthy, quite honestly. She knew she couldn't win, so she did everything she could to wear us down.<br>
Good thing we managed to take her out before she could alert anyone to our presence.<br>
Now, time to move on, wouldn't you say?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Algérie：</span><br>
Mhm. Let's get going.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Foch：</span><br>
Seeing as Sardegna has patrols moving about, it's safe to assume our "friends" are aware of our presence.<br>
I doubt they know exactly what we're here to do, though. For now.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Algérie：</span><br>
At any rate, don't underestimate them. They're not stupid.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Foch：</span><br>
Of course not. Their response is going to be slow, but come the time for action, they won't pull their punches.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Algérie：</span><br>
In other words, better exploit the fact they're asleep in their beds right now.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Foch：</span><br>
Well said. Onward we go.<br>
{{折叠面板|内容结束}}

{{折叠面板|标题=Preemptive Strike|选项=5|主框=1|样式=primary|展开=否}}
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Algérie：</span><br>
Foch, there's another fleet incoming.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Foch：</span><br>
Never a moment's rest, eh... What's their course?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Algérie：</span><br>
The same way we're going.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Foch：</span><br>
Hmm... So they're not coming to intercept us. Either it's another patrol, or it's the port's backup...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Algérie：</span><br>
Let's hope it's not the latter. If it is, then I think they're onto us.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Foch：</span><br>
Yeah, and it'd mean I grossly underestimated Sardegna's capabilities...<br>
Supposing it is their backup, that leads me to believe they haven't set up defenses yet.<br>
And in that case... If we get there first, there'll be nothing to stop us from bombarding the port.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Algérie：</span><br>
Not a good idea. They'd surround us in no time flat.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Foch：</span><br>
If that's a no-go, our only other choice is to focus our offensive on that fleet before they're in any position to fend us off.<br>
Sound good? Great, then get ready to engage!<br>

{{折叠面板|标题=Wake-Up Shot|选项=6|主框=1|样式=primary|展开=否}}
<span style="color:#ec5d53;">Zara：</span><br>
*Yawn*... Why did Littorio make us sortie this late in the night... What a slavedriver...<br>
Pola's going to kill me if this becomes a routine thing and I get baggy eyes because of it...<br>
Stupid defense duty... Oh well, I'll manage as long as all I have to do is camp out here for the night.<br>
Heh, imagine if anyone actually attacked this la– Eek?!<br>
<br>
BOOOOOM!<br>
<span style="color:#ec5d53;">Zara：</span><br>
Should've kept my mouth shut! Who's attacking?!<br>
Well, they picked a bad day to mess with me... I'm coming for you, jerkwads!<br>
{{折叠面板|内容结束}}

{{折叠面板|标题=Breakthrough|选项=7|主框=1|样式=primary|展开=否}}
<br>
BOOOOOM!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Foch：</span><br>
Whew... That's that fleet dealt with.<br>
Hey, you really ought to take a breather, Algérie. You'll exhaust yourself if you keep this up...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Algérie：</span><br>
Please. I don't want to hear that from you, Ms. Knight who's always busting her butt in battles.<br>
You have to give it your all in war. You of all people should know that.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Foch：</span><br>
Hahah, I suppose we're both overachievers by nature, huh!<br>
Although, I'm glad I don't have to make a show out of using my rigging, like you.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Algérie：</span><br>
What can I say? Conducting yourself with elegance is demanding.<br>
(I have no desire to turn my weapons upon fellow shipgirls, but...)<br>
(Because the Vichya wills it... we have no choice but to use force to achieve our "ideals.")<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Foch：</span><br>
Let's keep moving. We're going to reach our target soon.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Algérie：</span><br>
Is there anything else we should be keeping our eyes on?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Foch：</span><br>
Probably not. I'm pretty sure we've taken out all the patrols around the port.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Algérie：</span><br>
I wonder how many checkboxes we'll be able to tick before their main force arrives~<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Foch：</span><br>
Yeah. This is going to come down to a race against time more than a battle against enemies.<br>
All righty, let's get this job done quickly!<br>
{{折叠面板|内容结束}}

{{折叠面板|标题=Flames|选项=8|主框=1|样式=primary|展开=否}}
<br>
A blaring alarm ripped through the night sky at the Sardegnian facility, now under a surprise attack.<br>
The Vichya fleet rained destruction down upon the port, taking out facilities and defensive weapons.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Algérie：</span><br>
Phew... We sure did a number on them.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Foch：</span><br>
Their defenses were a lot thinner than I expected.<br>
Usually, we'd be at a disadvantage bombarding a land target.<br>
I guess they tried to compensate for this fact with their patrols.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Algérie：</span><br>
So... Did we achieve our objectives?<br>
Launch a surprise attack by night and cut off their supply lines, limit their operational activities...<br>
Though I'm not sure we brought enough firepower. Maybe we should've brought more mass-produced ships...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Foch：</span><br>
That's a no-go. The more firepower we bring, the higher the chance of us getting detected.<br>
And no matter how many ships we bring, the number of ships that can actually attack land targets are limited.<br>
In any case, I think we did a good enough job here.<br>
But now, we need to get out of here before Sardegna's main fleet arrives!<br>
{{折叠面板|内容结束}}

{{折叠面板|标题=The Hound|选项=9|主框=1|样式=primary|展开=否}}
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Algérie：</span><br>
They're here. Sardegna's main fleet.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Foch：</span><br>
Luckily, they took so long to get here. Let's retreat now, Algérie.<br>
The sun's about to come out anyway, and we'd lose our biggest advantage.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Algérie：</span><br>
Right. Let's get in touch with the others.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Foch：</span><br>
Already on top of it.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Algérie：</span><br>
All right, let's have the fast ships put up a bit of a diversion to buy time for everyone to retreat.<br>
We'll regroup back at the Vichya base!<br>
{{折叠面板|内容结束}}

{{折叠面板|标题=The Hunter|选项=10|主框=1|样式=primary|展开=否}}
<br>
The light from the flames of the burning port grew dimmer and dimmer as the Vichya ships made their retreat.<br>
By the time the first rays of light illuminated the surrounding waters, the fleet had already vanished.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Foch：</span><br>
Phew... We made it back in one piece.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Algérie：</span><br>
A fleet of capital ships doesn't exactly make for the most agile hunters.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Foch：</span><br>
Yeah, and it's also good that we were able to disable the port's defenses. It would've been awful if they cut off our retreat.<br>
<br>
Just when the two Vichya ships sighed a breath of relief, a sole Sardegnian battleship appeared before them.<br>
<span style="color:#ec5d53;">Littorio：</span><br>
Is it customary for the esteemed Templar Knights to be sneaking around without saying hello first?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Foch：</span><br>
Battleship Littorio...?!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Algérie：</span><br>
They sent two fleets...? Was the first one just to lure us into a false sense of security...?<br>
<span style="color:#ec5d53;">Littorio：</span><br>
Who knows? There's no way a lumbering main fleet would be able to catch up to you, no matter how hard it tried.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Foch：</span><br>
So that was a bluff to flush us out of the port...!<br>
<span style="color:#ec5d53;">Littorio：</span><br>
That's right. Nobody said that there was only a single fleet chasing after you.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Foch：</span><br>
It would be my honor to exchange fire with you right here, Littorio, but why don't we try to resolve this without violence?<br>
<span style="color:#ec5d53;">Littorio：</span><br>
A bit rich considering what you just did, but... it's not like you actually accomplished anything.<br>
I can consider taking you up on that offer... but don't think that means I'll just let you go.<br>
First, you'll answer a few of my questions––<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Algérie：</span><br>
That's not on the table, Littorio.<br>
You already know what the Templar Knights' Code dictates.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Foch：</span><br>
(Do we really have to fight? I'm not sure I like the odds...)<br>
(Considering it's Littorio we're up against...)<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Algérie：</span><br>
(I know there are some battles that you shouldn't take, but... Sometimes, you don't have a choice and just have to leave things to fate, right?)<br>
<span style="color:#ec5d53;">Littorio：</span><br>
I see. Is that a part of your plan as well?<br>
Considering what you did to Trento and Zara last night, it would be unbecoming of me not to return the courtesy.<br>
Littorio, Vittorio Veneto-class battleship of Sardegna...<br>
...will now test your mettle, Templar Knights!<br>
{{折叠面板|内容结束}}

{{折叠面板|标题=The Hunted|选项=11|主框=1|样式=primary|展开=否}}
<br>
The ships continued to exchange fire as the sun took its place in the morning sky.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Foch：</span><br>
As expected, we're simply no match for Littorio...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Algérie：</span><br>
How unfortunate. If only I hadn't used up so much ammo during our operation...<br>
Foch, I'll hold Littorio back. Take advantage of the opportunity to get out of here.<br>
As long as one of us makes it back to the Vichya, then the operation––<br>
<br>
Steeling her resolve, Algérie adjusted her rigging and prepared to face Littorio in close combat.<br>
However, Foch rushed forward to block her advance.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Foch：</span><br>
Wait, calm down first, Algérie.<br>
Anyone can play the hero, but very few sacrifices are worth it. Unnecessary sacrifices only endanger us down the road.<br>
No matter what the operation plan calls for, I want you to think things through.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Algérie：</span><br>
I understand. But I vowed to lay down my life.<br>
And if the Vichya needs me to make that sacrifice, then...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Foch：</span><br>
Sure, sure, but I don't recall "fight until you sink" being a part of our orders.<br>
That being the case, isn't returning home safely a higher priority?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Algérie：</span><br>
...That sounds like an unreasonable request.<br>
How are we to achieve that when we're facing Littorio?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Foch：</span><br>
Goodness, sometimes you're so stubborn that you can't even see what's in front of you.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Algérie：</span><br>
Foch?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Foch：</span><br>
If Littorio was going all-out with the intention of destroying us, how would we still be alive to have this conversation?<br>
Remember what Littorio said just before engaging us?<br>
...that she'd test our mettle.<br>
In other words, even if she has her orders, she's trying to avoid going all-out for whatever reason!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Algérie：</span><br>
Now that you mention it, that does make sense...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Foch：</span><br>
Sardegna is known to be very careful with preserving their forces.<br>
Littorio's orders probably also were to return home in one piece. The risk of her being injured here is probably too great a risk for them.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Algérie：</span><br>
...Because of the incident with the Cardinal?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Foch：</span><br>
See, aren't you glad that I'm here?<br>
Littorio has given us a bit of breathing room, but let's settle this situation and go home!<br>
Let's offer up our mass-produced ships so we can get away!<br>
{{折叠面板|内容结束}}

{{折叠面板|标题=Triumph|选项=12|主框=1|样式=primary|展开=否}}
<br>
Avoiding further direct confrontation, Algérie and Foch used their remaining mass-produced ships to create space for them to exit Littorio's firing range.<br>
<span style="color:#ec5d53;">Littorio：</span><br>
Heh. Looks like they finally saw through me.<br>
No matter how seasoned the hunter, the prey will always find a way to escape from a half-hearted hunt.<br>
<br>
Suddenly, a dagger flew at Littorio from over the horizon.<br>
Littorio instinctively moved to block it, the blade lodging itself into her rigging.<br>
When she turned to inspect it, she could see a hilt of Iris design.<br>
<span style="color:#ec5d53;">Littorio：</span><br>
If I recall properly... Foch was carrying this.<br>
Is this a declaration of her fighting spirit...<br>
...or just a parting gift for Sardegna?<br>
<br>
With dagger now in hand, Littorio contemplated the true meaning of Foch's action.<br>
<span style="color:#ec5d53;">Littorio：</span><br>
A finely-crafted piece. Its owner clearly took good care of it.<br>
I see.<br>
The mass-produced ships were not the only presents those two left for us.<br>
How curious. It seems like there are some good people left in the Vichya after all.<br>
If I bring this back, it'll prove that I managed to subdue a powerful Vichya ship.<br>
...I suppose I'll head back before Veneto starts to worry about me again.<br>
However, the "theatre" that their HQ has put on will not end with this battle.<br>
...I do hope that you survive their machinations, Knights of Vichya.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Foch：</span><br>
Phew... Littorio stopped chasing us...<br>
Dang, that was more excitement than I bargained for... I never thought I'd have to go against Littorio in person.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Algérie：</span><br>
Oh, Foch, what happened to your dagger?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Foch：</span><br>
Oh, that? Uhh... I think I lost it during the scuffle.<br>
<br>
Foch took out her empty scabbard and waved it in front of Algérie.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Algérie：</span><br>
How unlike you. I thought that dagger was really important to you.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Foch：</span><br>
Haha, I suppose so. It's gonna be a pain to get it back.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Algérie：</span><br>
Reckon it's now one of Littorio's spoils of war?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Foch：</span><br>
Maybe. We'll find out soon enough if it ends up on the newspapers, haha~<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Algérie：</span><br>
Heh, that we will.<br>
Are you sure you're going to be okay though?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Foch：</span><br>
Well, it does hurt a bit... but it's a small price to pay for our lives.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Algérie：</span><br>
Mm. I guess we'll have to win it back next time.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Foch：</span><br>
Jeez, Algérie, I really can't get used to seeing you all serious like this.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Algérie：</span><br>
Oh, are you telling me that this clever strategist hasn't already made plans three steps ahead?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Foch：</span><br>
Who knows~ Anyway, let's worry about getting home first.<br>
We can think about how to get that dagger back from Littorio later.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Algérie：</span><br>
It's a promise then. I swear upon my reputation as a Templar Knight that I'll return that dagger of yours to its rightful owner~<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Foch：</span><br>
I... I don't need a promise like that from you!<br>
No matter how precious it might've been, it's just an object. You know what... aren't you just teasing me at this point?<br>
Maybe we can go to a cat café next time to help you go back to normal.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Algérie：</span><br>
Hehe, now that's a promise I can get behind. I'll hold you to your word then.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Foch：</span><br>
Ah, wait, I never said it was a promise...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Algérie：</span><br>
Let's just make it a Knight's Oath then?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Foch：</span><br>
That's overdoing it even more!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Both：</span><br>
Hahaha~<br>
<br>
"May our flag fly victoriously over every battlefield."<br>
"May our might bring peace to the land."<br>
"Even should we be engulfed in flames..."<br>
"We will continue to tread forth dauntlessly."<br>
