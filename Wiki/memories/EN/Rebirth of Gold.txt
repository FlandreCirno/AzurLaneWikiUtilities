<br>
A fireplace burned in the corner of a dimly lit house, letting out quiet crackles now and then.<br>
The owner of the house sat in a rocking chair, gently rocking back and forth.<br>
There was a cat in her lap. She petted it while looking out the window, watching the setting sun.<br>
For some reason, seeing it brings back an old memory.<br>
A memory from the distant past.<br>
The moment that she changed her own fate.<br>
And the day that that terrible, unspeakable tragedy happened.<br>
Long, long ago...<br>
It was a weekend, and the setting sun painted the sky orange. It was an ordinary day like any other.<br>
Or rather, it was, until the Iron Claw Demon appeared without any warning whatsoever.<br>
Although she was only on the island for five minutes, the damage she caused to it was tremendous.<br>
She didn't stop at destroying the candy store, no – she even ransacked the depot of all 120 candies stored there.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Prototype Bulin MKII：</span><br>
This can't be, purin...<br>
I was a moment too late, purin...<br>
Who did this, purin?! Who committed this heinous crime, purin?!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">"Little" Saratoga：</span><br>
It was the Iron Claw Demon!<br>
She used to go by a different name that everyone knew...<br>
But now, people simply call her the Iron Claw Demon.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Prototype Bulin MKII：</span><br>
Why do people call her that, purin?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">"Little" Saratoga：</span><br>
Because she was responsible for so much trade disruption.<br>
She was unbelievably powerful, able to sink an entire convoy of merchant ships transporting candy with just a single strike.<br>
One of her victims, Little Cheshire, said she was in and out in an instant and couldn't follow her.<br>
Also, the great strategist Amagi-chan said, "No single faction will be able to stop her."<br>
So every last faction banded together and created the biggest combined fleet ever seen in history.<br>
Then they finally managed to corner her, and they sunk her along with all her stolen candy.<br>
The big bad was gone, and everyone lived happily ever after...<br>
Or so they thought!<br>
She didn't sink after all. She came back, and with new powers, too.<br>
Now she's become the Iron Claw Demon, appearing and vanishing like a ghost, leaving destruction in her wake.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Prototype Bulin MKII：</span><br>
What an unimaginably strong adversary, purin...<br>
But my sisters aren't here, purin...<br>
And without them...<br>
There's nothing I can do, purin...<br>
<span style="color:#fef15e;">God of Gold：</span><br>
Really, now? Nothing?<br>
<br>
Just as the Prototype Bulin sank into despair, a golden figure appeared before her.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Prototype Bulin MKII：</span><br>
W-wait... Aren't you the God of Gold, purin?!<br>
<span style="color:#fef15e;">God of Gold：</span><br>
I sure am! See how I glitter!<br>
Don't lose hope, Bulin.<br>
Remember the power within you.<br>
The power you inherited from the Gilded Age! The power of the Golden People!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Prototype Bulin MKII：</span><br>
The power of gold, purin...<br>
I get it now, purin!<br>
You must be talking about my Super Drill MKII golden mech, purin! That's definitely from the Gilded Age, purin!<br>
It's been gathering dust in the warehouse ever since I forgot the activation phrase, purin...<br>
But, I just need to rediscover the phrase, purin! Then I can bring an end to the Iron Claw Demon, purin!<br>
<br>
The God of Gold gave a nod and smiled before fading into thin air.<br>
And so, the Prototype Bulin set forth on a journey to find the activation phrase and defeat the demon. Little did she know what was waiting for her over the horizon...<br>

<br>
Once again, the Mechadrake suddenly brandished its iron claws and charged forward, splitting the Prototype Super Drill MKII in half.<br>
But then...<br>
Wasting not even a second to mourn the loss of her mech, the Bulin charged back into battle with a new mech.<br>
<span style="color:#ff9b93;">Iron Claw Demon：</span><br>
So stubborn...<br>
Come back to me, my second half – Iron Claw Mechadrake!<br>
<br>
The Iron Claw Demon cried out, and her iron beast was restored to full health!<br>
<span style="color:#ffc960;">Iron Claw Mechadrake：</span><br>
ROOOOOOAAAAARRRR!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Prototype Bulin MKII：</span><br>
I'm done messing around with you, purin!<br>
Prototype Super Drill MKII, pierce the heavens at triple speed, purin!<br>
<br>
Another two golden mechs descended upon the battlefield.<br>
The already fierce battle grew even fiercer.<br>
<br>
<br>
A fierce battle unfolded. The Mechadrake suddenly brandished its iron claws and charged forward.<br>
It happened so fast, the Prototype Super Drill MKII couldn't dodge, and was cleaved in two with just one attack.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Prototype Bulin MKII：</span><br>
What, purin?! An iron claw sweep, purin?!<br>
<span style="color:#ff9b93;">Iron Claw Demon：</span><br>
Heheh! It's over for you!<br>
I'm not surprised. This is the best your antiquated Gilded Age mech could do.<br>
<br>
The Iron Claw Demon smirked, drunk on a sense of triumph.<br>
But then...<br>
Wasting not even a second to mourn the loss of her mech, the Bulin charged back into battle with a new mech.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Prototype Bulin MKII：</span><br>
Pierce the heavens once more, my Prototype Super Drill MKII!<br>
<span style="color:#ff9b93;">Iron Claw Demon：</span><br>
What?! You have another?!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Prototype Bulin MKII：</span><br>
Hahaha! "Another," purin? What a naive fool you are, purin!<br>
Obviously there wasn't just ONE Gilded Age mech, purin!<br>
<br>
Indeed, the mech was of a mass-produced variety. The Iron Claw Demon was not expecting this.<br>
She couldn't react in time to its golden laser, which reduced her Mechadrake into a pile of scrap.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Prototype Bulin MKII：</span><br>
NOW it's over, purin!<br>
Victory is mine, purin!<br>
<span style="color:#ff9b93;">Iron Claw Demon：</span><br>
Are you sure about that?<br>
Then how come the results screen hasn't popped up yet?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Prototype Bulin MKII：</span><br>
Purin?! No, it can't be...<br>
<span style="color:#ff9b93;">Iron Claw Demon：</span><br>
Come back to me, my second half – Iron Claw Mechadrake!<br>
<span style="color:#ffc960;">Iron Claw Mechadrake：</span><br>
ROOOOOOAAAAARRRR!<br>
<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Prototype Bulin MKII：</span><br>
My intel says the Iron Claw Demon's base lies in a part of the sea where candy appears out of nowhere, purin...<br>
This sweet scent in the air... I've found it, purin!<br>
<br>
KABOOOM!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Prototype Bulin MKII：</span><br>
An attack, purin?! Nice try, but I can block that easily, purin!<br>
<span style="color:#ff9b93;">Iron Claw Demon：</span><br>
Huh? Wow, you're a lot stronger than the last one I fought.<br>
Who are you?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Prototype Bulin MKII：</span><br>
Heheh! I am Prototype Bulin MKII, the Avatar of Gold, purin!<br>
<span style="color:#ff9b93;">Iron Claw Demon：</span><br>
The Avatar of Gold, huh... I know you.<br>
Gold has long been a symbol of greed and evil.<br>
There was once someone claiming to be what you are, and she went on a rampage, turning candy into gold.<br>
...I won't let you do that.<br>
I'm taking you down, you golden fiend!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Prototype Bulin MKII：</span><br>
No! Gold is the embodiment of light, hope, and justice, purin!<br>
YOU'RE obviously the bad guy here, purin!<br>
<span style="color:#ff9b93;">Iron Claw Demon：</span><br>
Enough talk! Come down to me, Iron Claw Mechadrake!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Prototype Bulin MKII：</span><br>
Hah, "Steel Fists," purin? Is that what gives you your power, purin?<br>
My Super Drill will make quick work of it, purin!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Prototype Bulin MKII & Iron Claw Demon：</span><br>
- Get her, Prototype Super Drill MKII, purin! - Give me a war cry, Iron Claw Mechadrake!<br>
<span style="color:#ffc960;">Iron Claw Mechadrake：</span><br>
ROOOOOOAAAAARRRR!<br>
<br>
<br>
The great battle between good and evil and gold and iron continued.<br>
"Come back to me, my second half – Iron Claw Mechadrake!"<br>
"ROOOOOOAAAAARRRR!"<br>
Wasting not even a second to mourn the loss of her mech, the Bulin charged back into battle with a new mech.<br>
"Come back to me, my second half – Iron Claw Mechadrake!"<br>
"ROOOOOOAAAAARRRR!"<br>
Wasting not even a second to mourn the loss of her mech, the Bulin charged back into battle with a new mech.<br>
"Come back to me, my second half – Iron Claw Mechadrake!"<br>
"ROOOOOOAAAAARRRR!"<br>
And so the cycle repeated, continuing seemingly for eternity.<br>
Only one will survive this ultimate showdown of ultimate destiny. Who will it be?<br>
