Avrora and Her Jovial Friends<br>
<br>
Chapter 1: Daybreak of Victory<br>
Today, many light cruisers from around the port gathered to conduct a ship-class specific exercise...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Atlanta：</span><br>
Crap! Damn it, don't tell me I've also been sunk...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Cleveland：</span><br>
Another team member is out... at this rate, we won't be able to hold out!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Edinburgh：</span><br>
D-did Akashi mess up the settings with these virtual enemies? I've never fought enemies this tough before...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Belfast：</span><br>
Sister, please focus on the enemies in front of you! Otherwise, you too will be sunk!<br>
<br>
Even with their combined strength, the light cruisers were still struggling.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ping Hai：</span><br>
Ning Hai, what are we gonna do?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ning Hai：</span><br>
Focus on dodging! But if this keeps up...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Avrora：</span><br>
Don't panic, everyone!<br>
<br>
Suddenly, the inspiring voice of the protected cruiser, Avrora, rang out across the surface of the ocean.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Avrora：</span><br>
In our fights against the Sirens, my comrades never lost hope, even when severely outnumbered and outgunned.<br>
We shouldn't treat this exercise any differently - treat this as a life or death battle, and show your true power - the determination of a ship!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Cleveland：</span><br>
Heh, if Avrora's going to give us a pep talk like that...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Belfast：</span><br>
...then we have no choice but to do our utmost. Am I correct, Lady Cleveland?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Cleveland：</span><br>
You betcha! All right everyone, we're gonna take out every last one of them!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ning Hai：</span><br>
Ping Hai, we're pushing ahead! Follow me!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ping Hai：</span><br>
Got it!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Edinburgh：</span><br>
Jeez, look at them, charging forward after saying something cool...<br>
I-I'm coming too! If everyone else is going, I can't be left behind!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Avrora：</span><br>
Hehe~ Now that's what revolutsiya looks like~<br>
<br>
After hearing Avrora's rousing words, her colleagues began to charge forward courageously, smashing through the enemy ships.<br>
...By the way, Akashi really did make a mistake in the settings.<br>

<br>
Chapter 2: Nostalgia<br>
Avrora told me about what happened at the training exercise.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Avrora：</span><br>
In the end, I didn't really do much. The others were the ones who charged forward and seized victory...<br>
But maybe that's not a very satisfactory explanation? Hmm... how should I explain this then?<br>
<br>
Avrora brought two stainless steel cups before me, each filled with a clear liquid.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Avrora：</span><br>
This story might take a while, so why don't we have a drink first?<br>
This is one of our authentic specialties from the Northern Parliament.<br>
<br>
"Authentic specialty?" ...Was she talking about... "that?"<br>
Come to think of it, the label on the bottle she poured the liquid from...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Avrora：</span><br>
Here you go, Commander.<br>
<br>
If it really is "that," then I should...<br>
<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项1：Sip it like a hoity-toity bourgeoisie</span>'''''<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项2：Slam it down like a true proletariat</span>'''''<br>
<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项1）</span>'''''...I knew it, it's alcohol...<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项1）</span>'''''With even a small sip, a burning sensation spread through my mouth as if I had consumed fire.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Avrora：</span><br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项1）</span>'''''Commander, are you all right...?<br>
<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项2）</span>'''''I could feel the flames slithering through my body...<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项2）</span>'''''Not only were my mouth and throat on fire, it felt as if all the organs that substance had coursed through were also wreathed in fire, a burning halo threatening to burst through my skull as lights danced before my eyes.<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项2）</span>'''''.........It took a few minutes for my senses to fully return to me.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Avrora：</span><br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项2）</span>'''''Commander, are you still with me...?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Avrora：</span><br>
To bring the "light of dawn" to our peoples, and to fulfill the history of revolutsiya embodied within the keels of us Northern Parliament ships...<br>
Commander, there's a lot that I have to tell you...<br>
<br>
And thus Avrora began here recollection of the Northern Parliament with a soothing voice.<br>
It was a lighthearted tale of her daily misadventures with her quirky friends.<br>
It was a solemn tale of her peoples' struggles against the Sirens.<br>
It was an eye-opening tale of the various peoples whose diverse cultures and lifestyles dyed the white of the North into a dazzling array of colors.<br>
And as one topic flowed into the next, the bottles of vodka flowed freely into my cup.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Avrora：</span><br>
Someday, I want to take you to the Northern Parliament with me, Commander.<br>
<br>
Her words, tinged with nostalgia and longing, seemed as profound as her stomach.<br>

Chapter 3: Welcoming Party<br>
One day, at port...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Avrora：</span><br>
Commander, that letter... is that an invitation?<br>
"You are invited to the welcoming party of the Northern Parliament..."<br>
I see. Commander, would you like to come with me?<br>
...It would seem like this is the place.<br>
The door doesn't seem to be locked. Ahem, I'm coming in...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">???：</span><br>
Avrora is here!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Northern Parliament Crowd：</span><br>
Avrora!!<br>
<br>
With two loud bangs, streams of confetti shot straight towards us.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Pamiat' Merkuria：</span><br>
Aha~☆ Didn't think you had it in you to snag the commander. Good going, girl~♪<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Avrora：</span><br>
Eh? Everyone...!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Sovetskaya Rossiya：</span><br>
Avrora, we decided to throw a simple welcoming party to celebrate your return to the naval base.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Gangut：</span><br>
That's right! We've gotta celebrate the return of our wonderful comrade in style! Ahahaha!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Avrora：</span><br>
Ah, um, thanks, but... why a "welcoming party"...?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Minsk：</span><br>
Heheh, it's thanks to a flash of inspiration I had!<br>
You see, normally, you're supposed to throw a welcoming party for the new arrivals. But in the Northern Parliament, the new arrivals throw a welcoming party for you!<br>
And, as Gangut said... we're welcoming the return of an old comrade, so... welcome back, Avrora!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Tashkent：</span><br>
Sure, sure... Tashkent is only doing this for a friend.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Avrora：</span><br>
Everyone...<br>
<br>
Avrora wasn't the only one impressed by the warmth and hospitality of her friends from the Northern Parliament.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Avrora：</span><br>
Hehe. In that case, I'll be sure to enjoy this party to the fullest. Oh, speaking of parties...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Grozny：</span><br>
Mhm. I brought lots of hot chocolate.<br>
...*glug* *glug*<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Chapayev：</span><br>
Hehe~ Grozny, take your time with that, okay?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Avrora：</span><br>
Ah, since Commander is here, why don't we all have another toast?<br>
γpa！<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Northern Parliament Crowd：</span><br>
γpa！<br>

Chapter 4: Old Soldiers<br>
One day, at port...<br>
Unfolding before me was the strangest tea ceremony(?) I had ever witnessed in my life.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Pamiat' Merkuria：</span><br>
Hehh~ So this is the Sakura Empire's famous matcha~<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Gangut：</span><br>
Hahah! Wouldn't mind having some of this stuff every now and then!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Avrora：</span><br>
Mikasa, thank you for bringing us all these souvenirs from the Sakura Empire.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Mikasa：</span><br>
Ahaha! No need to be reserved, my comrades! We've all lived through the same era together!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Pamiat' Merkuria：</span><br>
How strange... I don't seem to see anyone here who fits that description! There aren't any girls here with super long service histories~<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Avrora：</span><br>
Come to think of it, you're right. Hehe~<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Pamiat' Merkuria：</span><br>
Hey Avrora, the video game that Commander bought looked super fun, right? Why don't we all give it a try next time?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Mikasa：</span><br>
Video games? I'm no good at those...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Pamiat' Merkuria：</span><br>
Ehh? Mikasa, you're not a gamer~?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Mikasa：</span><br>
I-is there any particular reason for me to become a "gamer?"<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Avrora：</span><br>
Well, we're all allowed to have our own hobbies. Besides, Kuku, wouldn't it be better if you had other interests outside of playing games?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Pamiat' Merkuria：</span><br>
Suuure, whatever you say~<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Mikasa：</span><br>
Hahaha, it's good to see that neither of you have changed.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Gangut：</span><br>
Hmm... Seems like I'm the only person here whose memories are a rather hazy... though it's not like I don't remember anything at all.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Mikasa：</span><br>
What are you saying, Gangut? Regardless of the length of time, we've always been working together towards the same goals.<br>
The sudden emergence of powerful enemies from the depths that seized the seas from us and resulted in countless sacrifices... the despair that came from the overwhelming difference in power between us...<br>
And, the friends from all over the world who set aside their differences and banded together to desperately fight to protect our azure lanes...<br>
Mm... and while the times may have changed, comrades from all different factions once again gather at the same port to sail under the same banner, just like back then...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Avrora：</span><br>
Yes, and it's all thanks to Commander's hard work.<br>
Even though we are older, we can still use our powers to guide our juniors on the right path.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Mikasa：</span><br>
Ahh, but it's still too soon to retire. Hahaha!<br>
<br>
And thus, the conversation of the venerable veterans continued.<br>

Chapter 5: Arresting Wire<br>
One day, at port...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Avrora：</span><br>
Seems like there's nothing for me to do today...<br>
Maybe I should go check on how Pirozhki is doing... a good cuddle always brings me back...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Minsk：</span><br>
Hey, Avrora! Um, the Northern Parliament and the Eagle Union are...!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Avrora：</span><br>
What's wrong? Calm down, and tell me what happened.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Minsk：</span><br>
R-right! So, what happened was...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Avrora：</span><br>
In other words, something happened between Sovetskaya Rossiya and Saratoga during the exercise, and things escalated from there...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Minsk：</span><br>
Yeah! I have no idea what exactly happened, but they're both on edge now...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Avrora：</span><br>
Would you take me to them?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Minsk：</span><br>
They're right there! Look, they're still arguing...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Saratoga：</span><br>
This is the last time I'm repeating myself! When you're fighting with carriers, you have to remain in formation at all times to escort the carrier! What are you going to do if you rush ahead and your carriers get flanked?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Sovetskaya Rossiya：</span><br>
Considering this was a carrier-centric operation, shouldn't the fleet have been organized differently to utilize battleships more effectively?<br>
Squandering the formidable firepower of battleships as floating anti-air platforms is a grievous waste of resources!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Saratoga：</span><br>
I'm so done with you! They probably don't even teach you the basic carrier battlegroup tactics in the Northern Parliament because you barely even have any carriers!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Sovetskaya Rossiya：</span><br>
How dare you...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Avrora：</span><br>
That's enough, you two. Quibbling won't solve anything.<br>
It is true that the Northern Parliament does not have a robust knowledge of operating carriers.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Sovetskaya Rossiya：</span><br>
Avrora...<br>
However, that hasn't stopped us from fighting back the Sirens. If anything, it means the other factions have not properly recognized our power.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Saratoga：</span><br>
Well, you do have a point, but...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Avrora：</span><br>
See? Did you two manage to cool down a bit?<br>
The issue is that we haven't fully understood how to fight alongside each other yet, given our differences.<br>
Why don't we hold a mock battle at the next exercise?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Rossiya & Saratoga：</span><br>
Let's do it...!<br>

Chapter 6: True Power<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Minsk：</span><br>
Eh?! We're really going to fight against the Eagle Union?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Avrora：</span><br>
Yes, I got permission to use the exercise area tomorrow afternoon.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Tashkent：</span><br>
Is that so. Well, all we have to do is beat 'em up, right?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Avrora：</span><br>
Wanting to win is fine, but the true purpose of this exercise is to understand how they fight.<br>
Remember, their carriers have a much longer range than our main batteries, so stay vigilant at all times.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Sovetskaya Rossiya：</span><br>
Avrora's absolutely right. During this exercise, we need to carefully analyze our opponents and adapt our strategies accordingly.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Everyone：</span><br>
Understood!<br>
<br>
The next day, at the exercise area...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Mikasa：</span><br>
As the referee for this mock battle, I hereby declare the start of this exercise!<br>
Begin the mock battle, combatants!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Everyone：</span><br>
Yeah!!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Chapayev：</span><br>
I assume we'll be sticking to Rossiya's plans?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Avrora：</span><br>
Yes, I'll be working with a separate squad. Chapayev, Tashkent, I'll be counting on you two to draw away the enemy vanguard.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Tashkent：</span><br>
Sure thing. Leave it to me.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Avrora：</span><br>
Sail closer together in formation to increase the density of your anti-air fire, and respond accordingly to their air power.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Everyone：</span><br>
Understood!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Sovetskaya Rossiya：</span><br>
And as soon as we find the enemy carriers, increase your rigging's output and focus everything into firepower.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Avrora：</span><br>
Umm, they're just dummy rounds, but...<br>
Well, anyway, I'll be off...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Saratoga：</span><br>
I see, you took advantage of the fact that we wouldn't prioritize older ships to sneak up behind us...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Avrora：</span><br>
Yes, that's right.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Saratoga：</span><br>
And while our planes were focused on offense and our vanguard fleet was distracted, you flanked our main fleet...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Avrora：</span><br>
We'd be able to disrupt the return of the first wave of planes as well as prevent the launch of the second wave.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Saratoga：</span><br>
But, that strategy is based upon the assumption the Sister Sara can't fight back, right?<br>
Behold! Sister Sara's Magic Cannon!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Avrora：</span><br>
What...?!<br>

Avrora and Her Jovial Friends<br>
<br>
Chapter 7: The Light of Dawn<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Saratoga：</span><br>
Heheh, Saratoga's cannon bombardment is nothing to scoff at!<br>
I told you I needed an escort because I couldn't defend myself, but... woah!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Avrora：</span><br>
Indeed, it would be a fatal mistake to go into battle without an escort.<br>
I'm not too proud of it, but I used to conduct this type of operation against the Sirens' large-scale fleets.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Saratoga：</span><br>
Operation...?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Avrora：</span><br>
Yes, this is what we're best at here in the Northern Parliament. Everyone, I've located the enemy commander! Forward!!!<br>
<br>
Through the smoke and flames where the Eagle Union was exchanging fire with the Northern Parliament, a figure clad in white came charging towards them at surprising speed.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Saratoga：</span><br>
That's... Sovetskaya Rossiya!!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Avrora：</span><br>
Entering range in 3... 2... 1... And, that's checkmate.<br>
<br>
And thus, the Eagle Union flagship was "sunk," resulting in a victory for the Northern Parliament.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Saratoga：</span><br>
Waahh, I'm so sorry, we lost because of me...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">South Dakota：</span><br>
No, I am also to blame. I completely got caught up in their diversion.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Avrora：</span><br>
Well, that was only possible because you only sent one battleship. If we were up against your entire task force, there's no way we'd be able to pull off something like this.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Sovetskaya Rossiya：</span><br>
Yes, if Saratoga had another battleship protecting her, Avrora and I would not have been so lucky.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">South Dakota：</span><br>
Breaking through the enemy's weak point, identifying their leader, and taking them out in a single decisive strike... this must have been a strategy you optimized to fight the Sirens.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Mikasa：</span><br>
Ahaha! This sure brings me back. Avrora, what was the purpose of this exercise?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Avrora：</span><br>
Well, let's see...<br>
For the Northern Parliament, seeing carrier-centric operations was a good learning experience. Right?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Sovetskaya Rossiya：</span><br>
Indeed. Results aside, the tactical advantages offered by a carrier task force are evident to me.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Avrora：</span><br>
In any case, we harbor no ill will against the Eagle Union. If you all feel the same way about us, then...<br>
I hope that this exercise was a good way to deepen our trust, develop bonds, and help us both take the first step towards a brighter future together. I think that you'll agree~♪<br>
So how about it? Let's get together this evening to further strengthen our new bonds.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Crowd：</span><br>
All right!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Gangut：</span><br>
Ahahaha! Bring out the good stuff for tonight!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Grozny：</span><br>
Mm... I'm looking forward to it.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Saratoga：</span><br>
Sister Sara will come too!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Avrora：</span><br>
...All right everyone, good work today. Let's enjoy ourselves at the party.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Mikasa：</span><br>
You're as wonderful as ever. Even though you aren't a commander, you're always guiding the children of the Northern Parliament.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Avrora：</span><br>
Oh my. I'd say the same about you as a role model for the Sakura Empire.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Mikasa：</span><br>
All I do is just give them a little push on the back. You, on the other hand, are the "light of dawn" that illuminates their path.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Avrora：</span><br>
Heheh, I'm flattered~<br>
<br>
...And thus concluded her story, a tale of the coming of the light of dawn.<br>
