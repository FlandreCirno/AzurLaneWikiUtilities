Where All Roads Lead<br>
<br>
1 To a Brightly Shining World<br>
Sardegna - Communication Room<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Bismarck：</span><br>
Sorry to keep you waiting, my esteemed allies of Sardegna.<br>
On behalf of the Iron Blood, I am glad to announce that we plan to attend the "World Expo" you've proposed.<br>
As such, I've proposed extending our ceasefire to our respective higher-ups through the Naval HQ.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Vittorio Veneto：</span><br>
That is good news indeed. Thank you for your courtesy and consideration, Flagship Bismarck.<br>
With your return to the world stage, I'm looking forward to seeing what Iron Blood will bring to the expo.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Bismarck：</span><br>
You flatter me, Veneto.<br>
Sardegna is a trusted ally to the Iron Blood. I hope this opportunity will allow us to further strengthen our bonds.<br>
The Naval HQ will have little choice but to extend the ceasefire during our celebration of peace.<br>
You have the support of the entire Crimson Axis, as we all wish for the expo to proceed smoothly and safely.<br>
Regardless of what happened in the past, we are united in wanting the people of this world to become more interconnected through safe waters, and improving everyone's lives.<br>
As the Iron Blood... No, as shipgirls, we must protect that future first and foremost.<br>
...In any case, Prinz Eugen will be your point of contact with the Iron Blood during the expo. She and her fleet should be arriving in Sardegna shortly.<br>
Despite her appearances, she's extremely capable. I'd like you to treat her as my proxy during this event.<br>
Do you find these arrangements acceptable?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Vittorio Veneto：</span><br>
Of course. We are well aware of Prinz Eugen's abilities.<br>
As always, Sardegna looks forward to your visitation.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Bismarck：</span><br>
Excellent. In that case, I wish Sardegna the best of luck. May your World Expo be a resounding success.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Vittorio Veneto：</span><br>
Phew... That's one fewer thing to worry about. Preparing for the World Expo is more of a hassle than I imagined...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Littorio：</span><br>
Huh? Hasn't everything been going great so far? Such an expression is ill-suited for your lovely face.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Vittorio Veneto：</span><br>
...I'm making this expression because I'm stressed out, jeez!<br>
Bismarck has always represented the will of the Iron Blood, and when she disappeared after the incident with the Sirens, we thought everything had changed. But now, she's suddenly front and center again as if nothing happened...<br>
Don't you think everything's moving a bit too quickly? Even though the Commander did notify you beforehand, you must be as surprised as I am, right?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Littorio：</span><br>
True, I was not expecting Bismarck to make her return like that either...<br>
But just between the two of us, I'd rather be dealing with Bismarck than that Friedrich der Große woman. Can't trust someone who always acts like she's holding all the cards.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Vittorio Veneto：</span><br>
I know, I know. That said though, isn't it equally dangerous to blindly go along with whatever Bismarck says?<br>
Even if she says she's no longer taking orders from the Naval HQ, that doesn't rule out the possibility that she might have plans of her own, just like Friedrich.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Littorio：</span><br>
Mm, that's a good point.<br>
But, I do believe the Signorina worries too much.<br>
Remember, the joint operation proposed by the Northern Parliament was carried out with the authorization of the Naval HQ.<br>
The fact that alliances and loyalties are so fluid for the Iron Blood means that the Naval HQ's higher-ups will have a closer eye on them than ever.<br>
Their survival now hinges on one thing – some kind of massive commotion that can divert their attention.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Vittorio Veneto：</span><br>
Hehe, so you're not all brawn and no brain after all, Littorio~<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Littorio：</span><br>
A-ahem... It's just guesswork on my part. I certainly can't read Bismarck's mind of all people...<br>
You got me good there, Veneto. In any case, we'll need to strengthen our security to ensure that they don't get their massive commotion during our World Expo.<br>
Worst case scenario, if we get involved in some Iron Blood "operation," we should still be able to flex our muscles as the event organizer.<br>
With Iron Blood on board, the Sakura Empire and Vichya Dominion shouldn't have any objections either.<br>
As for the Azur Lane... Well, the Northern Parliament has already agreed. The rest should follow suit sooner or later.<br>
"A celebration of peace." ...There's no way anyone would turn down an event like this, even if for the optics alone.<br>
The Naval HQ likely has their suspicions, but all we need to do is keep our heads down and continue with the preparations.<br>
Both Iron Blood and the Commander have proven that as long as nobody makes the first move, nothing will happen.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Vittorio Veneto：</span><br>
Indeed. And that is why we cannot pass on this prime opportunity to spread the splendor of Sardegna.<br>
Shipgirls from all over the world will gather in our warm, welcome waters, bask in our splendid scenery, and immerse themselves in our lush history and exquisite cuisine.<br>
In the end, they will all bow before Sardegna's splendor... In that regard, Marco Polo's proposal is quite compelling.<br>
...Phew. All this running around has worked up a sweat. Littorio, shall we head to the baths after this?<br>
We might even get some inspiration for the expo while enjoying the luxurious waters of our thermae~♪<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Littorio：</span><br>
I would be more than glad to accompany you, my beautiful signorina~<br>

<br>
2 The Northern Parliament's Speculation<br>
Somewhere in the Northern Parliament...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Sovetsky Soyuz：</span><br>
Kronshtadt, what do you think about the invitation we received from Sardegna?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Kronshtadt：</span><br>
The return of the World Expo? To my understanding, the event has been on the decline since the rise of the Crimson Axis.<br>
Now that the situation in the NA Ocean is finally starting to wind down, it's certainly not a bad time to reboot the event.<br>
I just didn't expect Sardegna to be the first to make the proposal.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Sovetsky Soyuz：</span><br>
No, I'd say that was a fairly predictable outcome. Sardegna likely sees the World Expo as a prime opportunity to "spread their splendor."<br>
I must admit, it's an efficient way of doing so.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Kronshtadt：</span><br>
And, through completely peaceful means too.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Sovetsky Soyuz：</span><br>
Do you think the Northern Parliament should participate?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Kronshtadt：</span><br>
I do think it would be in our best interests to go.<br>
The World Expo is an event where not only the organizers, but all the participants as well, can show off their abilities.<br>
Needless to say, that's meaningful for us as well.<br>
...And, knowing you, I'm sure you've already sent the reply saying that we'll participate.<br>
I'm just speculating here, but I suspect that there's nobody else you'd rather have hosting the World Expo than Sardegna.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Sovetsky Soyuz：</span><br>
Oh? Your speculation is rather prescient. If I didn't know better, I'd suspect you've been secretly browsing through confidential intelligence and communication records.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Kronshtadt：</span><br>
We all get lucky sometimes. By the way, for what purpose did you secretly dispatch Stremitelny to Sardegna?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Sovetsky Soyuz：</span><br>
Just your routine business contact. Strengthening our communication with Sardegna is a worthwhile endeavor, no?<br>
As for the matter of our participation in the World Expo, your "speculation" is correct. I have already responded on behalf of the Northern Parliament.<br>
As the first party from the Azur Lane to accept the invitation, our prestige has already increased in Sardegna's eyes. Treat it as my loan for them to repay.<br>
As for the girls who will be representing us to Sardegna, there are actually a few things I'd like to take care of beyond the routine stuff.<br>
Are you interested in going, Kronshtadt?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Kronshtadt：</span><br>
Of course. It's my job to take care of whatever goes "beyond the routine stuff" after all.<br>
Having that said, if I'm to serve as a delegate, all eyes will automatically be on me no matter how much I try to keep a low profile. I'll need some backup.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Sovetsky Soyuz：</span><br>
Avrora will accompany you. She's quite familiar with the workings of the other factions.<br>
Unfortunately, the Polar Fleet is tied up with some investigatory work right now and won't be able to provide you with much support. I do hope you understand.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Kronshtadt：</span><br>
I've been dealt worse hands before. But, I do have one request.<br>
I want authorization to see all of the higher-ups' classified documents on the Europa operation. Can't be rushing in blind after all.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Sovetsky Soyuz：</span><br>
...I do wonder, is that request actually for work purposes, or to sate your own curiosity?<br>
But, I understand. I will give you the authorization. Be sure to make good use of that information.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Kronshtadt：</span><br>
Understood. ...Oh, there's one last thing.<br>
Um... What about Comrade Commander? Should we send an invitation from our end as well?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Sovetsky Soyuz：</span><br>
It can't hurt to try... But this time, our chance of success is probably pretty close to zero.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Kronshtadt：</span><br>
All the factions are going to want to get their hands on the Commander, huh... Wait, isn't this pretty bad for us?<br>
Whichever faction's invitation the Commander ends up accepting will likely have ramifications for all of us. I can see it becoming a very sensitive issue.<br>
Plus, the Commander likely is being hosted by someone else right now. Us sending an invitation could potentially create a diplomatic mess...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Sovetsky Soyuz：</span><br>
Indeed. And that's why I already sent the invite, Kronshtadt.<br>

3 The Commander's Worries<br>
Somewhere in the Eagle Union...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Saratoga：</span><br>
W-wow, this isn't good... It's actually double plus ungood...<br>
<br>
Imagine my confusion when I got an "Invitation to the World Expo" from just about every camp in the world.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Saratoga：</span><br>
They're all asking for you to go with them... right? And the communications are all private too...<br>
<br>
I don't think anyone has any ill intentions, which is exactly why it's hard for me to say anything... Though, there's at least one sender who's doing this to mess with me...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Saratoga：</span><br>
But Sister Sara was just about to ask you if you had some free time in your schedule...<br>
<br>
For whatever reason, Saratoga looked like she was about to cry on the other side of the communicator.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Saratoga：</span><br>
Commander, listen to me! It's all one big conspiracy!<br>
<br>
"Now that you mention it, it IS extremely unlikely that I'd receive pretty much the same message from everyone at roughly the same time."<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Saratoga：</span><br>
That's right! I knew this would happen the moment Sardegna announced that they'd be rebooting the World Expo!<br>
<br>
A festival held in the beautiful seas of Sardegna, where shipgirls from all over the world come together to compete and represent their proud cultures.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Saratoga：</span><br>
Of course there's nothing wrong with inviting you, Commander, but the question of whose invitation you'll accept is a major crisis!<br>
I also sent you an invitation, and you didn't even respond... But you were happily laughing and chatting with THAT girl as if you two were dating... *sniffle*<br>
<br>
I wanted to correct the record and say that wasn't what was going on at all, and that I just wanted to participate as a regular, uninvolved party, but...<br>
There will definitely be a major problem if I make a wrong move. Plus, the Naval HQ will be watching my every move.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Saratoga：</span><br>
So, what are you going to do? You're going to go with Sister Sara after all so that nobody else gets the wrong idea, right?<br>
<br>
...I had to carefully think about what I wanted to do with these invitations. Except one. I slapped a big, fat "NO" on it, before sending it back.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Saratoga：</span><br>
This sucks... We won't even be able to relax and have a good time there at this rate...<br>
<br>
"There's nothing wrong with being in a festive mood, but the World Expo is a weeks-long event. It's not worth getting into trouble."<br>
"Let's focus on the task at hand first, and once everything blows over, we'll enjoy the rest of the event like ordinary people."<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Saratoga：</span><br>
F-fine, I suppose you're right...<br>
In case you were wondering, Essex is the Eagle Union's representative, so there's nothing to worry about.<br>
Oh, before I forget! I know you can't go right now, but here are some pictures of Eagle Union's pavilion! It has sci-fi vibes and looks super badass, doesn't it?<br>
When you get there, you definitely have to go check it out... *click*<br>
<br>
*knock* *knock*<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Eldridge：</span><br>
Commander... Eldridge is here to remind you... that the next round of equipment testing is starting...<br>
Um... I thought I heard Saratoga's voice...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Saratoga：</span><br>
Anyway, I'll leave it there for now! We're still busy setting up for the expo over there, so I'll talk to you later!<br>
<br>
After seeing Eldridge come into the room, Saratoga scrambled to end the call.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Saratoga：</span><br>
Bye bye! Sister Sara out!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Eldridge：</span><br>
Commander, are you okay?<br>
If you're tired... Eldridge will try to... get the tests pushed back.<br>
<br>
"No, I'm fine. You know what they say: work hard, play hard––"<br>

4 The Royal Exhibition<br>
Royal Islands - Queen's Museum<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Warspite：</span><br>
Your Majesty, shouldn't you take a break? It's been two hours already.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Belfast：</span><br>
I've gone ahead and prepared tea and snacks. Please feel free to ask me should you have any requests.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Queen Elizabeth：</span><br>
Give me a minute. Ugh...<br>
Now isn't the time for tea... Warspite, help me move this portrait outside!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Warspite：</span><br>
Urgh... Why is this... so... heavy?!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Queen Elizabeth：</span><br>
I'll have you know, that's one of the Queen's Museum's treasures! It's very important!<br>
This one over here too – Valiant, come help me out!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Valiant ：</span><br>
H-huuuh? Why are you making ME do manual labor?! Hermione, heeeelp!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Hermione ：</span><br>
Y-yes ma'am! Right away!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Warspite：</span><br>
*pant*... *pant*... Your Majesty, are you sure you want to take so many of our treasures to the World Expo? What if something happens...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Queen Elizabeth：</span><br>
The fact that we're not hosting the World Expo means that it's even more important for us to demonstrate our greatness!<br>
Make no mistake - the World Expo is also a battlefield! We will attract more guests to the Royal Navy's pavilion and defeat this so-called "Sardegnian splendor!"<br>
For that purpose, I shall utilize everything in my museum!<br>
...But, you do have a point, Warspite. Taking all these treasures over to Sardegna is a rather risky affair.<br>
Which is why what you see before you are elaborate replicas, completely indistinguishable from the real articles!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Warspite：</span><br>
How astute, Your Majesty! That solves the problem of security!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Queen Elizabeth：</span><br>
Indeed! I thought of that idea right away! ...Howe, I need your help too!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Howe ：</span><br>
Y-yes, Your Majesty!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Queen Elizabeth：</span><br>
And, that should settle things nicely. Bel, have you compiled a list of our exhibits?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Belfast：</span><br>
Yes, it's all. Please take a look.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Queen Elizabeth：</span><br>
Mm... Hmm... Don't you think this is too many antiques?<br>
With this lineup, Sardegna might think we're there to pawn off our old wares...<br>
Maybe we should go with something more modern? Let me think...<br>
Bel, help me collect some more modern stuff!<br>
Find stuff that isn't very important but still showcases the Royal Navy's technological prowess!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Belfast：</span><br>
As you wish, Your Majesty. I'll look for things that fit that description.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Warspite：</span><br>
Y-your Majesty, if we keep adding more things to the exhibition, we won't even have room in the pavilion for our guests!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Queen Elizabeth：</span><br>
Just make it bigger then!<br>
That's right, our Crystal Palace has to be larger and more luxurious than whatever Sardegna can throw together!<br>
Hmph! I'll show them that their talk of glory and splendor is just that. Only the Royal Navy understands what Glory truly is!<br>
Illustrious will be in charge of the pavilion and its security. As for transporting the items...<br>
I'll have the Royal Maids handle that. Go call Sheffield for me.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Warspite：</span><br>
Your Majesty, is there nothing for me to do?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Queen Elizabeth：</span><br>
Hmm? Are you dissatisfied, Warspite? I think the two of them are more than sufficient to carry out those duties.<br>
What I'm more concerned about are the Sirens. Ever since the Iron Blood made their move, the Sirens have been suspiciously quiet.<br>
Then, there's the wildcard of that Richard Bon Homme girl we encountered in Camelot. In other words, our very own waters may well become a flashpoint.<br>
Warspite, Valiant, and Howe – the three of you are tasked with defending our homeland, and our important waters!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Warspite & Valiant & Howe：</span><br>
Understood!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Queen Elizabeth：</span><br>
Phew... I'll let Bel handle the exhibition then... Time to sit back and enjoy a nice cup of tea~♪<br>

Somewhere in Africa...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Illustrious：</span><br>
Cardinal Richelieu, this concludes our arrangements for the exhibition.<br>
I do believe Iris Libre was also invited to attend the World Expo, but what is your opinion on this matter?<br>
Her Majesty stated that should you choose to participate, the Royal Navy would shoulder the construction costs of your pavilion.<br>
There is still plenty of space in the venue, and we would certainly love to have Iris Libre hold a joint exhibition with us.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Richelieu：</span><br>
I truly appreciate Queen Elizabeth's generous offer.<br>
But... I'm sorry. I'm afraid I need more time to think this over.<br>
I promise to provide you with an answer after consulting with my friends and colleagues.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Illustrious：</span><br>
Very well, do take your time. We all sympathize with Iris Libre's present situation.<br>
In any case, I eagerly await your response.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Jeanne：</span><br>
Cardinal, with all due respect, Iris Libre has too many things on its plate right now to justify going.<br>
While the issue with the Vichya remains unresolved, I fear that there is little room for celebration and fanfare...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Le Terrible：</span><br>
If I may, Jeanne. Iris Libre ought to participate precisely because the Vichya will be there.<br>
Simply stated, the World Expo is a rare opportunity for the various camps to show off their culture, prestige, and... legitimacy.<br>
If the Vichya participates while we do not, that will be taken as a sign that the Vichya is the legitimate heir of the Iris Orthodoxy.<br>
Besides, awkward as it may be, I do not think any disagreements between our two sides will devolve into conflict.<br>
After all, the World Expo is ultimately a celebration of peace, and we are all expected to set aside our differences during this time.<br>
If we do end up running into each other, I don't think that's a particularly difficult situation to diffuse. Right?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Jeanne：</span><br>
I see, you do have a point... But, what will the other factions make of us sharing the same space with the Vichya?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Le Terrible：</span><br>
Who knows? It is what it is.<br>
The reality is, Iris Libre and the Vichya Dominion are at a complete stalemate, with neither side having the power to break through.<br>
Regardless of what the Vichya decides to do, this is still a good opportunity for Iris Libre to make itself known on the world stage.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Jeanne：</span><br>
You've convinced me. Cardinal Richelieu, I'm now in support of attending the expo.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Richelieu：</span><br>
Phew... I'm glad we were able to reach a consensus.<br>
As for our exhibition, how about we use the technology of the Basilica to put on a holographic display?<br>
The quintessence of our technological development, and a representation of our piety...<br>
A spectacular dome that embodies the resurgence of the Iris... Nay, of all of humanity––<br>

<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Hakuryuu：</span><br>
Sky-Rending! Retribuuuution!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Kasumi：</span><br>
Enemy down at 4 o'clock, confirmed!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Hakuryuu：</span><br>
Only cowards would ambush us in the middle of a storm!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Shinano ：</span><br>
This one shall... dispatch the stragglers...<br>
<br>
KABOOM–––––––!!!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Hakuryuu：</span><br>
Huh, you're not half-bad for someone who spends all day sleeping.<br>
Color me impressed, even though you basically were just doing clean-up duty.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Shinano ：</span><br>
This one sees that... you too have awakened to great power...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Hakuryuu：</span><br>
Hey, don't get the wrong idea just because I was hibernating inside the Dragon Palace! There simply was no reason for me to unleash my true powers at that time!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Shinano ：</span><br>
Kasumi... Report on the enemy's status... Also, stay with us and do not get separated...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Kasumi：</span><br>
R-right away... Umm, our fleet members are individually dealing with remaining enemies... But, umm, where's Noshiro's team?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Shinano ：</span><br>
This one did not need the extra escort... As such, Noshiro has been sent to assist Chikuma...<br>
(The Sirens' wreckages... are disappearing far too quickly...)<br>
All ships... Be on your guard...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Noshiro：</span><br>
Always ready, Lady Shinano.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Shinano ：</span><br>
Hakuryuu shall remain here with this one... The enemy may well be targeting our mass-produced ships.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Hakuryuu：</span><br>
The transports? What do the Sirens want with–– Oh, do you think it has something to do with the strange rock we got from the Iron Blood girls?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Shinano ：</span><br>
Their goals... are beyond this one's comprehension...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Hakuryuu：</span><br>
Hmm... Well, lemme ask you something you can answer this time.<br>
You seemed to know that the Sirens were going to attack us right here... How'd you manage to pull that off?<br>
Can you predict the future or something?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Shinano ：</span><br>
That was... this one's dream... A single fragment, strung together by destiny. And thus, one comes to see the end of things.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Hakuryuu：</span><br>
...Sorry. I won't bother trying to ask you questions anymore.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Shinano ：</span><br>
...My apologies.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Suruga：</span><br>
Lady Shinano, the Siren fleet has completely retreated. We're safe now.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Shinano ：</span><br>
What of our damages?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Suruga：</span><br>
None to report of. Our mass-produced ships are all unharmed.<br>
Yamakaze, Umikaze, Yura, and Katsuragi took a bit of scratch damage at the very beginning of the sneak attack, but there shouldn't be any issues there.<br>
Shimakaze, um... seems to have gotten lost chasing after an enemy in the storm. I'll go bring her back.<br>
I apologize on her behalf... Good grief, that girl just can't keep out of trouble...<br>
Thanks to your foresight, we were able to anticipate the enemy's surprise attack and came away relatively unscathed. Kii even managed to arrive in time to reinforce us.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Shinano ：</span><br>
It was simply a dream... A fragment of a dream does not necessarily reflect the rules of the present world...<br>
But Musashi... Even from the Sakura Islands, she was able to foretell my peril and respond appropriately...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Kii：</span><br>
Oh, uh, Shinano... That actually has nothing to do with foreseeing anything.<br>
Musashi was simply worried about you, and insisted on sending a support team just in case. It's nice that things panned out.<br>
But before we left, she did give us these orders: "If Shinano is safe, accompany her back to the Sakura Islands, and retrieve Watatsumi." <br>
"In the event of a Siren attack, Kii is to retrieve Watatsumi and bring it back to the Sakura Islands, while Shinano will go to Sardegna."<br>
"She will participate in the World Expo as the representative of the Sakura Empire." ...So there you have it.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Shinano ：</span><br>
The World Expo...?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Kii：</span><br>
Yup. All the camps from around the world are going to Sardegna to display their culture. Apparently, Musashi wants you to be the Sakura Empire's delegate.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Shinano ：</span><br>
Is this... Musashi's order, or Akagi's...?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Kii：</span><br>
That, I am unsure of, as Akagi has yet to return. In the meanwhile, Musashi is in charge of all matters around the Sakura Empire.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Shinano ：</span><br>
I see...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Hakuryuu：</span><br>
Wait up a sec, Musashi is Shinano's sister ship, right?<br>
She hasn't even had a chance to go home yet, and now she's getting sent off to Europa again?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Shinano ：</span><br>
Hakuryuu, control yourself...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Hakuryuu：</span><br>
Tch...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Shinano ：</span><br>
As the representative of the Sakura Empire... Sardegna will treat this one with utmost respect.<br>
This journey has not been a difficult one... If anything, it has been more of a vacation.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Hakuryuu：</span><br>
A vacation, huh? Fair enough. I guess sending you off to do an easy mission is Musashi's way of showing kindness.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Shinano ：</span><br>
Indeed... Now, the mass-produced ships and escorts will be transferred to Kii, while this one proceeds to Sardegna...<br>
(To be kept away from the Sakura Islands once again... Musashi, what is the purpose behind this...?)<br>

7 The Great Peng Takes Flight<br>
Somewhere in the Dragon Empery...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">An Shan：</span><br>
Good evening, Miss Yat Sen.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Harbin：</span><br>
Yat Sen cooking dinner for us? Has the karma of the cosmos turned upside down or something?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Chen Hai：</span><br>
Oh my, if it isn't An Shan and Harbin.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Harbin：</span><br>
Chen Hai's here too? Well, something big must be happening if we're all here in one place, heh...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Yat Sen：</span><br>
Please be seated, you two. Let's have a little chat over dinner.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Harbin：</span><br>
Woah... What the heck did you cook for us today? Is this... a vulture?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Chen Hai：</span><br>
It's the Great Peng.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Harbin：</span><br>
It looks pretty exquisite, but the portions are a bit...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Yat Sen：</span><br>
What did I say, Chen Hai? You know how Harbin is.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Chen Hai：</span><br>
Yes, yes, I should've known better. I'll go bring out the rest of the portion.<br>
This should be enough to eat to your heart's content, yes?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Harbin：</span><br>
Haha! That it is! The best food is whatever fills your stomach up!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Yat Sen：</span><br>
Alright then. Everyone, have you heard about Sardegna's World Expo?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">An Shan：</span><br>
Sorry, but I've been a bit out of the loop... All the training recently has taken a lot out of me.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Harbin：</span><br>
Yeah, I heard about it. Like, five seconds ago.<br>
So what's this expo thing, and are going?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Yat Sen：</span><br>
What do you all think? We've been invited, and the Commander has also been contacted regarding this matter.<br>
So I do wonder if this is the right opportunity for us.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Harbin：</span><br>
Right opportunity? What are you... Wait, do you mean–<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Yat Sen：</span><br>
Yes, we're about to make a big announcement, right?<br>
"Upon the wind the Great Peng soars into the sky, in a single day ninety-thousand meters high."<br>
In other words, the Dragon Empery shall step onto the world stage as a major player.<br>
As such, let us enliven the World Expo together and make it the prelude to our great announcement.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Harbin：</span><br>
I like the sound of that! So, have you decided on who's going? Is there anything I can do?<br>
I, for one, would love to see Europa in person!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Yat Sen：</span><br>
Hehe. Sorry, Harbin, but you'll have to wait for your turn.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Harbin：</span><br>
I guess that's true... Sucks, but I'll just have to deal with it! Ahaha!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">An Shan：</span><br>
Then, who will be our representative?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Yat Sen：</span><br>
That has already been decided.<br>
The fact that we've been relatively isolated from the other camps up until this point has been both a blessing and a curse.<br>
Naturally, the others have little knowledge of the cards we hold in our hands.<br>
But we also know very little about them.<br>
Therefore, our top priority at this expo should be to learn as much as we can about the other camps, and bring that knowledge back.<br>
Chen Hai, will you make the journey to Sardegna?<br>
Take Hai Tien and Hai Chi with you, and broaden your horizons for the sake of the Dragon Empery. Then––<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Chen Hai：</span><br>
Display the allure of the Dragon Empery to the world, yes? I will try not to disappoint you. Hehehe~<br>
