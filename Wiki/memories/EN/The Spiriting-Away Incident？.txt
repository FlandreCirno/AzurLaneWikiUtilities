The Spiriting-Away Incident?<br>
<br>
Summer, Hot Springs, and Ghost Stories<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Memphis：</span><br>
So there's absolutely no consensus on our next vacation destination...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Bristol：</span><br>
Then obviously we go to the deep sea instead!<br>
Think about it – there are undiscovered monsters and lost treasure down there!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Fu Shun：</span><br>
Sounds great... if you like being stuck inside a submarine. My vote still goes to pursuing ghost ships!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Shimakaze：</span><br>
Fu Shun, Bristol, don't be absurd! Those aren't summer activities!<br>
Summer means swimsuits, beaches, and sunbathing! Ideally, all three at once!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Fu Shun：</span><br>
Yeah, but we can do that right here. Shouldn't we do something, you know, different for our vacation?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Cleveland：</span><br>
The Knights of the Sea could organize a vigilante patrol.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Hornet：</span><br>
Aaand... what's that got to do with vacationing?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Cleveland：</span><br>
Think of it like a work-cation.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Hornet：</span><br>
Someone play the extremely loud incorrect buzzer. We're vetoing that plan!<br>
<br>
The debate continues for some time, with no sign of a consensus in sight.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Hatsuzuki：</span><br>
None of these ideas really feel like "the one"... Oh, hey, Commander! What's this?<br>
<br>
Hatsuzuki pulled out a leaflet from among a pile of documents.<br>
<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项1：Just another one of Akashi's ads.</span>'''''<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项2：Toss that one into the shredder!</span>'''''<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Hatsuzuki：</span><br>
Okay. Let me just skim it and see what it's about...<br>
Huh. "A place to get away from it all"... "Refresh your body and spirit at our onsen resort and bathe in water straight from the source"...<br>
..."Experience sublimity surrounded by nature"... "Enjoy some of the local ghost stories"...<br>
..."The elusive Youkai Troupe, which remains a legend"...<br>
"Youkai Troupe," eh... The ad touts it as real, but it's obviously just a shtick to lure in tourists.<br>
<br>
It suddenly becomes palpable how silent it is in the office. Everyone's gaze is transfixed on the flyer in Hatsuzuki's hands.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Hatsuzuki：</span><br>
Oh well. I'll go ahead and dispose of it as...<br>
...Wh-why are you all looking at me?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Everyone：</span><br>
That's the one!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Hatsuzuki：</span><br>
It is?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Bristol：</span><br>
Of course it is! Summer is the season of testing your courage, and ghost stories!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Fu Shun：</span><br>
It sure gets my vote if it means I get to see some sick youkai!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Hornet：</span><br>
Like from Sakuran legends? Hell yeah, I'm in!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Hatsuzuki：</span><br>
Y-you know youkai aren't real, right? They're just stories!<br>
I say we go for something else, like–<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Yura：</span><br>
Shinano, what do you think?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Shinano ：</span><br>
Washing away one's stress and fatigue in an onsen... A splendid proposal...<br>
As it also sits on a remote Sakuran isle, we could further invite other factions to experience our hospitality...<br>
<br>
Hatsuzuki's objections are drowned in a sea of discussion in favor of the idea.<br>
To no surprise, the onsen resort plan took the vast majority of the votes, and so our next vacation destination was decided.<br>

<br>
The Spiriting-Away Incident?<br>
<br>
Calm at the Onsen Resort<br>
Onsen Resort - Inn Main Building<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Miyuki：</span><br>
I've finished airing out all the futons... Now they're nice and soft.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Sakawa：</span><br>
And I finished cleaning the rooms. You won't find one speck of dust in there!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Owari：</span><br>
Snacks and refreshments're lookin' good, and I just got done setting up my stall. This is gonna be one profitable vacay for me♪<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Noshiro：</span><br>
Don't you think it's odd that Akashi just... lets you run a stand?<br>
It's her resort, and I can't think of any good reason why she'd be fine with others earning money she could be making.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Owari：</span><br>
I mean, she straight-up told me she's busy with somethin' else and she's got no choice but to let me have her biz.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Shinano ：</span><br>
I take it the preparations are proceeding smoothly, Noshiro?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Noshiro：</span><br>
Yes. I just received the final confirmation letter, in fact.<br>
Our visitors will have unrestricted access to the resort, the island, and the surrounding waters during their stay.<br>
I've put in the requests for everything you outlined, so all should be in order.<br>
I'm confident that we, as the hosts, will be able to provide the best possible experience for the Commander as well as all our other guests.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Shinano ：</span><br>
That is excellent to hear...<br>
Incidentally, where are Shimakaze and Suruga? This one hasn't seen them...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Yura：</span><br>
Shimakaze asked to look around the resort, so she's on a patrol at the moment. As for Suruga... she went after her to keep an eye on her.<br>
Shall I summon them here?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Shinano ：</span><br>
Nay... Let them continue their patrol...<br>
<br>
Onsen Resort - City Streets<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Shimakaze：</span><br>
Hrmh... Eerie...<br>
Suruga! This place is eerie to the extreme!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Suruga：</span><br>
Uh-huh? Like how?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Shimakaze：</span><br>
It's daytime, yet the lanterns are lit!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Suruga：</span><br>
It's not "daytime," it's evening. It makes sense to start lighting them now.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Shimakaze：</span><br>
So you say, but I've not seen anybody actually lighting the flames!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Suruga：</span><br>
Because this place is mostly automated. The lanterns turn themselves on when it's time. Noshiro told me.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Shimakaze：</span><br>
Oh! That explains that...<br>
But it doesn't explain THAT! See? Something about that torii gate feels mighty eerie to me!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Suruga：</span><br>
And what is that "something," huh? Fine, it's eerie. So what?<br>
It doesn't matter. It's nearly dinnertime, so let's head back or we'll be late.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Shimakaze：</span><br>
Oh! Suruga! Did you see that?!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Suruga：</span><br>
Ugh. What is this time?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Shimakaze：</span><br>
Something definitely flew out from behind that torii gate!<br>
I must look into this! Stay here while I go investigate!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Suruga：</span><br>
We'll miss dinner if we don't... Hey! Wait, Shimakaze!<br>
<br>
Meanwhile, inside the inn's main building...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Tengu：</span><br>
Okay, let us move. We wouldn't want to keep the audience waiting.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Kappa：</span><br>
I-I can't wait... to see everyone's reactions...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Yuki-Onna：</span><br>
*sigh*... Don't go too far with the pranks now, okay?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Umibouzu：</span><br>
You needn't tell me twice. I know how to moderate myself♪<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Shinano ：</span><br>
Are you... youkai...?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Tanuki：</span><br>
Hey! Who's there?!<br>
How can you see us? How did you even get here?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Shinano ：</span><br>
I sensed a barrier in the vicinity of the resort...<br>
I went to investigate... Of course, an encounter with the Youkai Troupe is not what I expected...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Chouchinobake：</span><br>
This ain't good, chief! We've been exposed 'fore the show even started!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Tengu：</span><br>
Our only option is to subdue her here and now! Do not let the cat out of the bag!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Shinano ：</span><br>
Subdue, you say...?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Tengu：</span><br>
Gaahhh! Such power!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Kappa：</span><br>
We don't stand a chance, wearing these costumes...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Umibouzu：</span><br>
Aye... Even I am forced to raise the white flag.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Tanuki：</span><br>
Screw it, chief! We need to bail, nya!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Shinano ：</span><br>
"Nya"? Might your true form be...?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Dream-Eater Baku：</span><br>
Quiet. Everybody, quiet.<br>
I'm... *yawn*... the dream-eater baku, also known as the chief. The Youkai Troupe bids you welcome.<br>
First of all... Let me make it up to you for how rude the others were.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Shinano ：</span><br>
As you say...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Dream-Eater Baku：</span><br>
Great. I knew you'd be willing to talk it out.<br>
*yawn*... So, our troupe has been entertaining the resort for a looong time, and we've never hurt a soul...<br>
So, be nice and pretend you didn't see us, alright?<br>

The Spiriting-Away Incident?<br>
<br>
Spirited Away<br>
Onsen Resort - 2 days later...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Saratoga：</span><br>
Commander, we're almost there!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Fu Shun：</span><br>
Commander, we're almost there!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Saratoga：</span><br>
...Why are you parroting me?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Fu Shun：</span><br>
I'm just so excited I couldn't think of anything else to say!<br>
Although, it's weird how empty this place is. Shouldn't there be people in the lobby?<br>
The first group that went said they'd come out and meet us...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Kirov：</span><br>
It IS weird. Stranger yet, Comrade Commander, I haven't received any word from Shinano since we disembarked.<br>
She would never leave us hanging under normal circumstances.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Kasumi：</span><br>
Unless...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Bristol：</span><br>
Heheheh... This just screams "mystery" to me!<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
(Something is wrong here. We should head to the main building and investigate.)<br>
<br>
Onsen Resort - Inn Main Building<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Kasumi：</span><br>
Shinano made the place really tidy... I'd stay here any day of the week.<br>
There are lots of fresh and tasty ingredients in the kitchen too...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Bristol：</span><br>
I suppose this tea was going to be our welcoming drink... Curiously, the kettle is still warm.<br>
Someone must've been here recently. But who? And where are they now?<br>
This feels eerie... It's almost as if everyone was spirited away!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Fu Shun：</span><br>
Commander! Look at this!<br>
<br>
Fu Shun gestures toward the dining table, on top of which there's a card radiating an abnormal energy.<br>
And on top of the black and red card, there's a slip of paper with letters in various fonts cut out from magazines. To be frank, it looks extremely creepy.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Bristol：</span><br>
Wow! Let me read it aloud.<br>
"Dear Commander, ever the wise and brave one..."<br>
"We wish to make you and your fleetmates feel welcome, and have planned the most wonderful play in the world for you."<br>
"Please head through the entrance of the amphitheater. Your companions are waiting for you."<br>
"We cannot wait to see you. Yours truly..."<br>
"...The Youkai Troupe."<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Fu Shun：</span><br>
Look! It really says "Youkai Troupe" on it!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Bristol：</span><br>
The same troupe that that flyer mentioned! Incredible! The Youkai Troupe actually exists!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Hatsuzuki：</span><br>
It'd be false advertising if it DIDN'T exist! That doesn't mean they're real youkai, though...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Kirov：</span><br>
It sounds to me like these "Youkai Troupe" people kidnapped the group that arrived before us.<br>
This goes beyond some little prank. This is dead serious, Comrade Commander.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Well...<br>
Sure, the first group is nowhere to be seen, but I think it's jumping the gun to assume that they've been kidnapped.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Bristol：</span><br>
You know what this means, Commander. Let us investigate what's happened!<br>
<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项1："Us"?</span>'''''<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项2："Investigate"?</span>'''''<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Bristol：</span><br>
You heard me! Between me, Fu Shun, Kasumi, and Hatsuzuki, we've got just enough people to form an investigation team.<br>
Trust us, we've got this. Let the four of us investigate!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Hatsuzuki：</span><br>
Hold on! Why am I automatically a part of this?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Bristol：</span><br>
Because it's customary for an investigation team to consist of four people, duh!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Hatsuzuki：</span><br>
Uh-huh... "Customary."<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Kirov：</span><br>
I'm feeling apprehensive about this, Comrade Commander. Should we radio the port and request backup?<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
I mean, other groups coming to the resort after finishing their respective tasks was our original plan.<br>
While calling in backup feels excessive, I believe we should inform the groups arriving after us about this Youkai Troupe in advance.<br>
Until everyone has arrived, I say we let Bristol and her team conduct the investigation.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Bristol：</span><br>
Hooray! We'll have this case solved in no time, I promise!<br>

<br>
The Spiriting-Away Incident?<br>
<br>
Entrance to the Dark World<br>
Onsen Resort - Near the eerie torii gate<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Kasumi：</span><br>
Foo says this place feels eerie...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Hatsuzuki：</span><br>
Foo? Who's that? And what exactly about it is so eerie?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Kasumi：</span><br>
Foo is just Foo...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Bristol：</span><br>
Hmm... My investigation lantern is getting brighter and brighter. I think there's a new investigation point just behind this torii gate.<br>
It does match the description that was in the note... The amphitheater must be up these stairs.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">???：</span><br>
Look ooout! Out of the waaay!<br>
<br>
A voice cries out from the treeline and is followed by a thud.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Fu Shun：</span><br>
Owww...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Bristol：</span><br>
Fu Shun? I was wondering where you'd gone.<br>
What were you doing in that tree?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Fu Shun：</span><br>
Owch... I wanted to get to a vantage point to see if I could find the kidnappers and the first group, but my new booster rocket completely failed...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Hatsuzuki：</span><br>
You could just, you know, ask Saratoga to launch her recon planes for you.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Fu Shun：</span><br>
But that's cheating! It wouldn't feel like I'M doing the investigating! Oww...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Bristol：</span><br>
At least the gang is all together now. All clues point past the torii gate, so I think that's where we'll find the Youkai Troupe's base or something like that!<br>
Come on, team! Let's get in there and investigate!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Hatsuzuki：</span><br>
What?! We're going in just like that?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Kasumi：</span><br>
Let's go, Foo.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Hatsuzuki：</span><br>
Hold up! Let me at least radio the Commander before we–<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Fu Shun：</span><br>
Hurry along, Hatsuzuki! You're gonna get left behind!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Hatsuzuki：</span><br>
...Okay, okay! Wait for me!<br>
<br>
Onsen Resort - ???<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Hatsuzuki：</span><br>
Um, just for the record, monsters and ghosts don't scare me! Not in the slightest!<br>
I'm only staying so close because I don't want any of you running into danger, okay?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Fu Shun：</span><br>
Sure, I'll believe that~<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Hatsuzuki：</span><br>
Good... A-also, haven't we been walking for quite some time now?<br>
It feels like we've been wading through this fog for ages... Do torii gates always lead to stairs this long?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Kasumi：</span><br>
They don't. We should be way past the resort by now.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Hatsuzuki：</span><br>
What?!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Kasumi：</span><br>
But Foo said the fog will come to an end very soon. Our friends are waiting for us.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Fu Shun：</span><br>
Friends? Are we finally gonna come face-to-face with the Youkai Troupe?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Hatsuzuki：</span><br>
I dunno... I wouldn't call them "friends," and I'm not too keen to meet them...<br>
Let's just turn back and report this to the Commander!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Yuki-Onna：</span><br>
It's too late to turn back now...<br>
<br>
PANG! PANG!<br>
Firecrackers panged and popped while multicolored ribbons rained from the ceiling.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Chouchinobake：</span><br>
Welcome to the amphitheater, y'all!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Kappa：</span><br>
W-welcome...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Hatsuzuki：</span><br>
EEEEEEEK!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Umibouzu：</span><br>
Settle down, li'l lassie. Us youkai mean you no harm.<br>
The name's Umibouzu. I'm the vice-chief o' this here troupe, and this here is our youkai theater. Welcome!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Tanuki：</span><br>
And I am Tanuki, the manager.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Bristol：</span><br>
Wow! You're real! The Youkai Troupe is real!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Fu Shun：</span><br>
So you're all youkai, huh? Makes sense why you look completely different to us!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Hatsuzuki：</span><br>
(extremely quiet whisper) Thank god they're youkai and not ghosts...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Kasumi：</span><br>
Was it you who left the calling card in the inn?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Tengu：</span><br>
...What calling card?<br>
We left you an invitation, and no more than that.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Hatsuzuki：</span><br>
You call that an "invitation"?!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Tengu：</span><br>
Yes...? Our chief and your leader spoke about this. We are working on a play to amuse the guests.<br>
And since we are short on hands, your leader has relocated her staff from the inn to help with rehearsals and preparations.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Kasumi：</span><br>
"Leader"? Do you mean... Shinano?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Fu Shun：</span><br>
That explains a lot! The first group just wanted to surprise us!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Hatsuzuki：</span><br>
(extremely quiet whisper) More like scare the life out of us...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Tanuki：</span><br>
The show is about to get started. Just hang on a minute.<br>
I can tell you right now that you're gonna love it!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Fu Shun：</span><br>
Awesome! I for one can't wait to see this play!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Kasumi：</span><br>
Foo looks forward to it too.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Hatsuzuki：</span><br>
Wait, what? The play is starting now? But...<br>
But we still haven't radioed the Commander!<br>

<span style="color:#4eb24e;">In-Story Narration：</span><br>
As the white mist cleared, the travelers suddenly found 'emselves in a hella snowy mountain landscape!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Bristol：</span><br>
Wh-where did all this snow come from?!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Fu Shun：</span><br>
Achoo! Talk about a scene transition!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Hatsuzuki：</span><br>
Brrr! It's freezing cold... Is this real snow?!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">In-Story Narration：</span><br>
The wind was all, like, super cold, drainin' the travelers of energy and making 'em shudder.<br>
Geesh, y'all really screwed the pooch here. No sane person travels up a snowy mountain in this season.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Hatsuzuki：</span><br>
We didn't exactly WANT to come here! Don't force dumb backstories on us!<br>
I know that's you, by the way, Owari. What's going on here?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">In-Story Narration：</span><br>
I ain't Owari, I'm the narrator!<br>
And you four are, like, travelers. You're a part of the play!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Bristol：</span><br>
Ohhh. This is "the show" they mentioned just earlier!<br>
I thought we'd sit down in a theater or something. It's even cooler that we get to play a role ourselves!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Fu Shun：</span><br>
Immersive storytelling... I like it!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">In-Story Narration：</span><br>
Cool. Then let's carry on.<br>
So... The travelers kept wadin' through the insano blizzard. It was rough.<br>
They were at their breaking point. Freezing, exhausted, and boutta pass out.<br>
But then – bum-bum-buuum – they spotted a hut in the wilderness!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Bristol：</span><br>
Hooray! We won't have to freeze our butts off out here!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Hatsuzuki：</span><br>
Thank god. Let's go inside, quickly.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">In-Story Narration：</span><br>
The travelers forced the hut's door open with their cold, shaking hands and went in.<br>
God must've felt bad for 'em or something, 'cause the hut was full of divine surprises. There was tons of food and firewood, and the hut's walls were thick and durable!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Bristol：</span><br>
Phew... We can use the wood to start a fire and warm up!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Kasumi：</span><br>
There's food, too, so we won't go hungry.<br>
Although... doesn't it feel wrong to break into someone's hut and eat all their food?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Fu Shun：</span><br>
It's fiiine. This is an emergency, so I'm sure they won't mind!<br>
Let's roast some meat over the fire until nice and crispy. Aaand... done!<br>
Frankly, I'm starving, so I'm gonna dig in right now!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">In-Story Narration：</span><br>
The travelers, free of the freezing temperatures and harsh snow outside, sat around the fire and chewed the fat – and their food.<br>
But then, the door flung open with a thud, and a snowy gust blew into the room!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Bristol：</span><br>
Brrrr! Someone close the door, quick!<br>
We can't let the wind blow out the fire!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">In-Story Narration：</span><br>
It took a lotta work, but the travelers managed to shut the door. The cabin was quiet once more.<br>
Or so they thought! The realization hit 'em like a cold breeze – someone else was here!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Livid Yuki-Onna：</span><br>
Get out.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Hatsuzuki：</span><br>
Huh? Bristol, did you hear that?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Bristol：</span><br>
No? I didn't hear anything.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Livid Yuki-Onna：</span><br>
Get out of here!<br>
Foolish mortals! You are not welcome inside my hut! I shall turn you to ice as punishment for your intrusion!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Hatsuzuki：</span><br>
Eek! I-it's another youkai!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Fu Shun：</span><br>
Take it easy! Miss Ghost, do you have any way to prove this is your home?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Livid Yuki-Onna：</span><br>
I am Yuki-Onna – the snow lady – and I've roamed this mountain for ages upon ages. Everything around you belongs to me!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Bristol：</span><br>
Everything? Do you have the landowner documentation? What about the hut's construction permit? If you don't, how can you claim it belongs to you?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Livid Yuki-Onna：</span><br>
L-landowner documentation? I, uh...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">In-Story Narration：</span><br>
At that moment – slam! – the door swung open, and another snowy gust blew into the hut!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Bristol：</span><br>
Not again! Close the door!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Headstrong Yuki-Onna：</span><br>
Stupid mortals! Who gave you permission to enter my hut? I'm gonna turn you into a popsicle as punishment♪<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Kasumi：</span><br>
Sakawa?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Headstrong Yuki-Onna：</span><br>
I'll only say this once, dummy! I am not Sakawa, I am Yuki-Onna!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Hatsuzuki：</span><br>
No, it's painfully obvious you're Sakawa!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Headstrong Yuki-Onna：</span><br>
I am Yuki-Onna – the snow lady – and I've roamed this mountain for ages upon ages. Everything around you belongs to me!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Bristol：</span><br>
This is getting out of hand... Now there are two of them!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Headstrong Yuki-Onna：</span><br>
No! There is only one of me! Now, tremble in fear! Your shipgirl powers do not work here. You are fully at my–<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Fu Shun：</span><br>
Okay, pause! Which one of you is the real deal?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Livid Yuki-Onna：</span><br>
...What?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Headstrong Yuki-Onna：</span><br>
She's the impostor! I am the real one!<br>
(whisper) It's in the script, y'know.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Livid Yuki-Onna：</span><br>
That's news to me. As far as I know, you're the fake and I'm the real one.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">In-Story Narration：</span><br>
Sooo... there were, like, two Yuki-Onnas in the hut.<br>
But then! The door swung open with a loud thud!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Bristol：</span><br>
That's the third time now! I'm gonna shut the door tightly this time!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Lazy Yuki-Onna：</span><br>
M-mortals... Who said you could go into my hut? You've made me mad, so I'm g-gonna... Umm...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Kasumi：</span><br>
...Turn us into ice?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Lazy Yuki-Onna：</span><br>
Right, yeah... I'm gonna turn you into ice...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Hatsuzuki：</span><br>
Seriously, Miyuki?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Lazy Yuki-Onna：</span><br>
I-I'm not Miyuki, I'm Yuki-Onna...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Bristol：</span><br>
Alright, alright, you wanna turn us into ice. Let's be polite and get in line.<br>
There are two more Yuki-Onnas waiting to do the same.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Lazy Yuki-Onna：</span><br>
T-two more? But... But I'm the real one...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Headstrong Yuki-Onna：</span><br>
That's exactly what an impostor would say!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Livid Yuki-Onna：</span><br>
You're right about that much. I am the real one, after all.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Headstrong Yuki-Onna：</span><br>
No, no, no! I – me – I'M the real one!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Hatsuzuki：</span><br>
(What a farce. This is gonna go on forever.)<br>
Hmm... Okay, I've figured it out!<br>
She's the real one. The one who's tired of this.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Headstrong Yuki-Onna：</span><br>
What? You're saying I'm a poser?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Lazy Yuki-Onna：</span><br>
How... How do you know it's her?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Hatsuzuki：</span><br>
Come on. It's obvious even at a glance.<br>
Sakawa, Miyuki, you two keep insisting you're the real deal, but you don't look like it at all!<br>
Meanwhile, she's actually dressed to look the part! She's the real Yuki-Onna!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Fu Shun & Bristol：</span><br>
Whoa! That makes total sense!<br>

<span style="color:#4eb24e;">In-Story Narration：</span><br>
As the white mist cleared, the travelers suddenly found 'emselves aboard a big-ass wooden boat!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Bristol：</span><br>
...What does that mean? Is this the second act?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">In-Story Narration：</span><br>
Ding-ding-ding! Correctamundo.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Kasumi：</span><br>
But we were just in a hut in a snowstorm... What a strange transition.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">In-Story Narration：</span><br>
Rain was pourin' down, the wind was howling, and the seas were rockin' like crazy. The travelers were starting to get some mad seasickness.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Fu Shun：</span><br>
Are we? I feel perfectly fine.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Bristol：</span><br>
Yeah, it makes no sense for shipgirls to get seasick.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">In-Story Narration：</span><br>
That so? Ahem... Rain was pourin' down, the wind was howling, and the seas were rockin' like crazy. Despite that, the travelers looked right as rain!<br>
Clearly, they were badasses – badasses, but they were tiny compared to the ocean.<br>
Especially compared to the colossal beast of the sea. Yes, an Umibouzu towered above them and their teensy fishing boats!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Umibouzu：</span><br>
Aye. I demand tribute. Tribute for the Umibouzu!<br>
Your food, your valuables... Give them all to me!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Bristol：</span><br>
Yikes... I've heard about this. It's an extortion tactic where criminals demand protection money, I think.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Virtuous Fisherwoman：</span><br>
Hippity hoppity... Such is life, I'm afraid.<br>
You need to appease the Umibouzu, or else the storm will never let up.<br>
And if the storm never lets up, I won't be able to fish. Then I'll go out of business!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Fu Shun：</span><br>
That's so mean to the poor fisherwoman! I say we gang up on the big baddy and take it down!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Bristol：</span><br>
Agreed. It doesn't matter if it's a powerful youkai – our cannons will make short work of it!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Brave Fisherwoman：</span><br>
Exactly. We need to stand up to our oppressors!<br>
I worked like a dog for this haul! Why should I stand and watch while some youkai steals the fruits of my labor?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Virtuous Fisherwoman：</span><br>
Goodness... Please, brave lady, simmer down!<br>
It's infuriating, I know, but we are compelled – destined, even – to offer tribute to the youkai!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Brave Fisherwoman：</span><br>
Really? Well, I've had enough of this! On this day, I'm going to defy destiny and teach this cruel monster a lesson!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">In-Story Narration：</span><br>
Oookay... The brave fisherwoman took up a harpoon and leaped out of her boat, hell-bent on taking down the Umibouzu.<br>
But! Just a moment later, a giant wave rose from the turbulent sea, and swallowed the unfortunate fisherwoman!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Virtuous Fisherwoman：</span><br>
*sigh*... See? I tried to warn you!<br>
The rest of you! I suggest you stay in your boat!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Bristol：</span><br>
So the waves will sweep us away if we get out... Yeah, I guess we can't use our riggings then.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Kasumi：</span><br>
We could sail closer, acting like we're going to offer tribute... then beat it up.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Fu Shun：</span><br>
Something tells me there's no way to advance without giving it something for realsies.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Hatsuzuki：</span><br>
Look! That fisherwoman chucked something into the sea!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">No-Nonsense Fisherwoman：</span><br>
O mighty Umibouzu, I offer you this tribute! Please give me your blessings so I may go unnoticed and nothing bad will happen to me!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Umibouzu：</span><br>
Brazen human... You think this paltry tribute will appease me?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">In-Story Narration：</span><br>
Uh-oh. Looks like that wasn't enough for the Umibouzu. It sent a huge wave after the fisherwoman and sank her boat!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Virtuous Fisherwoman：</span><br>
Oh geesh, oh man... I doubt what little we have will be nearly enough to satisfy the Umibouzu!<br>
We're damned if we do, damned if we don't!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Fu Shun：</span><br>
So offering goods won't work, and shooting it won't either... Then what are we supposed to do?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Hatsuzuki：</span><br>
First of all, let's search the ships for anything left of value.<br>
We'll distract the Umibouzu with as many goods as we can, then knock its lights out.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Fu Shun & Bristol：</span><br>
That's brilliant! You're a genius!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Virtuous Fisherwoman：</span><br>
(Isn't that essentially what Kasumi proposed, though?)<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">In-Story Narration：</span><br>
The travelers took tributes from all the surroundin' boats and gathered them in one place. The Umibouzu looked at all of it with greedy eyes!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Umibouzu：</span><br>
The last of the goods, that be. Now offer them to me!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">In-Story Narration：</span><br>
The Umibouzu closed in on the heap of treasure as it bellowed an order.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Bristol：</span><br>
Okay, it's on the hook!<br>
Hatsuzuki, throw a few tributes into the water! Get it just a bit closer!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Hatsuzuki：</span><br>
Alright, got it!<br>
This should do it. One, two, three... EEEEEK!<br>
Wh-wh-wh-what the heck is this?! That is NOT a fish!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">In-Story Narration：</span><br>
That's uh, lemme see... That's a will-o'-the-wisp.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Hatsuzuki：</span><br>
W-w-will-o'-the-wisp?! Why is it moving?! WHY IS IT MOVING?!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">In-Story Narration：</span><br>
Uhh... One of the travelers was so utterly filled with fear that it gave her the strength to perform a small miracle.<br>
Like a frog juiced up on energy drinks, she jumped through the air onto another fishing boat! But, there was another surprise awaiting her there...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Hatsuzuki：</span><br>
OH MY GOD! THERE'S A WHOLE SWARM OF THEM HERE! EEEEEEK!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">In-Story Narration：</span><br>
Shoutin' and shriekin', she leaped from boat to boat until eventually, she was face-to-face with the Umibouzu!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Umibouzu：</span><br>
Impressive... Fancy that herculean acrobatic feat as tribute, do you?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Hatsuzuki：</span><br>
*lets out an ungodly scream as she swings her katana*<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">In-Story Narration：</span><br>
The Umibouzu was slain. Calm returned to the seas and the fishers were finally able to resume their peaceful lives.<br>
And everyone lived happily ever after.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Hatsuzuki：</span><br>
What? That's it?<br>
THAT'S how the story ends?!<br>

The Spiriting-Away Incident?<br>
<br>
Assemble the Fleet!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Tengu：</span><br>
Well, it's time for the intermission.<br>
Travelers, was our play to your liking?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Kasumi & Hatsuzuki：</span><br>
- It was great. - I'll have nightmares about this!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Bristol & Fu Shun：</span><br>
- I can't wait for more! - Show us the next act already!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Hatsuzuki：</span><br>
Wait, there's more?! God, have mercy on me...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Tengu：</span><br>
Ah. That's great to hear.<br>
Now, let us continue to the–<br>
<br>
BOOOM!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Kasumi：</span><br>
...What was that?<br>
<br>
BOOOM!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Fu Shun：</span><br>
Zoinks! Is that an earthquake?!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Chouchinobake：</span><br>
Naw, girl, that's definitely no earthquake!<br>
This ain't good, folks! Someone's attacking the barrier!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Owari：</span><br>
Attacking it?<br>
Oh boy... Lemme guess, y'all forgot to tell the Commander you were goin' here, didn'tcha?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Bristol：</span><br>
Oh! Right! I knew we'd forgotten something!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Fu Shun：</span><br>
Uh-oh! We need to stop the attack immediately!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Owari：</span><br>
*sigh*... Just what we needed...<br>
Shimakaze, you're the quickest – scoot over there 'n tell the Commander to stop! We'll take things from here!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Shimakaze：</span><br>
Roger-dodger! I'm on my way!<br>
<br>
Meanwhile, outside the strange torii gate...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Kirov：</span><br>
Comrade Commander, we've finished blockading the waters around the island. Entry will be possible once the barrier has been destroyed.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Saratoga：</span><br>
I've got the skies under complete lockdown, too. Not a single bird or ghost is getting out!<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Excellent. Nagato, how are things on your end?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Nagato：</span><br>
Expected to finish in ten minutes.<br>
Yamashiro, Musashi, focus fire. Coordinate your attacks on the talisman with me.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Yamashiro：</span><br>
Understood, Lady Nagato!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Musashi：</span><br>
Shinano and the girls' safety hinges on us. I will hold nothing back.<br>
<br>
Nagato, Yamashiro, and Musashi are bombarding the barrier. A group of shipgirls from all factions stood just behind them, ready to run in.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
The talisman will be destroyed in ten minutes. All ships, prepare for battle!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Everyone：</span><br>
Roger!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">???：</span><br>
Wait, wait! Please wait, Commander!<br>
<br>
A familiar voice calls out to me from nowhere. Then, Shimakaze appears seemingly out of thin air from beyond the torii gate.<br>
More follow a few moments later. Owari, Hatsuzuki, and Bristol with the rest of her team.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Fu Shun：</span><br>
Geesh, you guys gathered a small army here...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Hatsuzuki：</span><br>
See? I TOLD you we should've called the Commander before we went in!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Shimakaze：</span><br>
This is all a big misunderstanding, Commander! Please allow me a minute to explain!<br>
<br>
Shimakaze, in her panic, blew way past a summary and dove into a convoluted explanation...<br>
Fortunately, Shinano had come along, and she provided me with a brief overview of what had happened.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Shinano ：</span><br>
All we intended for was an unforgettable summer experience... We are truly sorry...<br>
This one suspected the invitation of poor messaging... A mistake most unfortunate...<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
I understand now. You wanted to make it look like a spiriting-away case as part of the play.<br>
Instead, it made your intentions all the more fuzzy.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Nagato：</span><br>
Such a misunderstanding is nobody's fault. Let it not bother you.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Kirov：</span><br>
I'll admit, it DID result in an unforgettable experience.<br>
It was certainly the last way I expected that flyer to keep its word.<br>
I wondered what form this Youkai Troupe would take, and I was not disappointed.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Saratoga：</span><br>
Speaking of them, is that where we'll meet the troupe? Just past the barrier under the torii gate?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Shinano ：</span><br>
Yes... They cannot leave the barrier in their current forms...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Saratoga：</span><br>
Did you hear that? We'll get to see some real youkai! Let's go!<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
(Well... I suppose the crisis is over now.)<br>
(Everyone's safe, and I don't want to undermine the efforts Shinano and the Youkai Troupe put into all this.)<br>
(Let's head in and see what this play is like.)<br>

{{折叠面板|标题=General Commander|选项=8|主框=1|样式=primary|展开=是}}
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">In-Story Narration：</span><br>
It was a fervid summer day... The skies were clear, and the sun hung high in the sky...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Mysterious Voice 1：</span><br>
Hey! They got a new narrator!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Mysterious Voice 2：</span><br>
And new actors, too. The Commander's the lead now, and it's our turn to watch the play.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Mysterious Voice 3：</span><br>
We should be quiet then! Like audience members are supposed to!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">In-Story Narration：</span><br>
Ahem... As this one was saying...<br>
An army marched the path through the woodlands. Their general – the Commander – was resting inside a sedan chair, carried by the troops...<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Wait, a sedan chair? Is this story set during the Warring States period?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">In-Story Narration：</span><br>
Indeed... The Commander's sedan chair was large and highly ornate, filled with curiosities and antiques – more than one could count...<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
It IS pretty spacious in here. It could do without all the boxes and bottles, though...<br>
And this uniform... it's very different to my usual one. I look like some sort of Edo-period magistrate.<br>
Safe to assume, I must be playing an extremely wealthy person.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Fleet-Footed Retainer：</span><br>
I-I bring you a report, Milord! Our battle on the front is unfolding smoothly!<br>
Milord's vanguard has already seized two castles with all the ease of a walk through the grasslands! Victory shall surely be yours soon!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Boastful Retainer：</span><br>
Hahahah! Of course! Our great army's victory is inevitable, particularly with Milord at the helm!<br>
Our foes would be wise to surrender, and instead they struggle like imbeciles! They must be taught a lesson!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Graceful Retainer：</span><br>
I-I think you should calm yourself... It's hot today, and you risk a heatstroke if your anger overboils.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Fleet-Footed Retainer：</span><br>
Milord! A large group of villagers have gathered on the road ahead of us!<br>
They knew of Milord's coming and are offering alcohol and rations to thank Milord's army!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Boastful Retainer：</span><br>
So the commoners embrace the tides of change. Milord, shall we halt and savor a moment's respite?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Graceful Retainer：</span><br>
I support this idea. It's sweltering, and the villagers are extending their goodwill. Let us stop and rest.<br>
As for where... Yes, I think the flat plain by the side of the mountain shall do. It's not the most spacious, but it's adequate to set up camp.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Hmm...<br>
<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项1：Aye! Rest we shall!</span>'''''<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项2：Hold your horses!</span>'''''<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">In-Story Narration：</span><br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项1）</span>'''''The army set up camp by the mountain, gorged themselves on the offerings of the villagers, and enjoyed their break...<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项2）</span>'''''Can we really stop and nonchalantly put down camp by the roadside? Aren't we marching for war?<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项2）</span>'''''(The location is suspect. It's a long way away from our other units, and the enemy may ambush us from over the mountain...)<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">In-Story Narration：</span><br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项2）</span>'''''The army set up camp by the mountain, gorged themselves on the offerings of the villagers, and enjoyed their break...<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项2）</span>'''''What? I thought I as the general would decide!<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项2）</span>'''''(I suppose not... Something tells me I don't get a say in this story.)<br>
<br>
Moments later, the scene changes to a massive encampment.<br>
A feast of delectable dishes is lined up before me. I look around me and see swords, books, treasures... and even exotic animals around the camp.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
The flyer wasn't lying about taking you from one magic place to the next.<br>
Why would a marching army be hauling these things around, though?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Attractive Dancer：</span><br>
Oh, my General, why are you all alone in here? Everyone outside is enjoying their drinks~<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Passionate Dancer：</span><br>
Perhaps it's because... you really wanted to see us? Heehee♪<br>
There's no one else here but you, me, and her... You can do aaanything you want with us♥<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Attractive Dancer：</span><br>
Good point! The only question is – WHAT would you do, hmm? Heehee♥<br>
...Excuse me, why won't you look at me?! My script says I'm the attractive dancer!<br>
Come on, say it~ Aren't I attractive?<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Um... Yeah.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">In-Story Narration：</span><br>
The lovely mood was suddenly disrupted by the rumble of lightning...<br>
In mere moments, a rainstorm had swept over the camp...<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
That sure came out of nowhere.<br>
I feel like I've forgotten something really important...<br>
<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项1：Umbrella! I need to find an umbrella!</span>'''''<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项2：Where are we now?</span>'''''<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项1）</span>'''''...Well, I do, but more importantly – where even am I?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Fleet-Footed Retainer：</span><br>
We are in Okehazama, Milord!<br>
It's shocking how quickly rain came upon us, when the skies were clear just moments ago... An unfortunate change of weather.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
I see. So we're in Okehazama...<br>
<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项1：Let us play kemari!</span>'''''<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项2：Wait a second...</span>'''''<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项2）</span>'''''It's been a really hot day, rain and thunder came suddenly...<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项2）</span>'''''And I'm playing a general in the Warring States period... Oh no!<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项2）</span>'''''We must prepare for battle, posthaste!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">In-Story Narration：</span><br>
Meanwhile, under the cover of the thunderstorm, a cavalry unit had gathered in an attacking position atop the mountain...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Valiant Officer：</span><br>
We are in position. Awaiting orders to commence the attack.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Dignified Officer：</span><br>
Heehee. Imagine a sudden rainstorm whipping up to our benefit. The heavens are on our side.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Diligent Officer：</span><br>
Indeed. Milord's unyielding determination to attack has resulted in the perfect opportunity for us.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Adorable Lord：</span><br>
Heehee~ Keep the praise coming~♪<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Timid Officer：</span><br>
D-do we really need to fight?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Principled Officer：</span><br>
Yes. There is no room for personal feelings on the battlefield.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Self-Confident Officer：</span><br>
Milord, give us the order, and the cavalry will charge. We shall return to you victorious.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Impatient Officer：</span><br>
I am on the brink of keeling over from boredom. Let's begin, shall we?<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Hmm...<br>
<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项1：Cavalry? But some aren't even riding horses!</span>'''''<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项2：Really? They all count as cavalry?</span>'''''<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">In-Story Narration：</span><br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项1）</span>'''''Apologies, but we lacked the resources for a complete cavalry unit...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">In-Story Narration：</span><br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项2）</span>'''''Some say that a soldier atop any vehicle of war may be considered cavalry...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">In-Story Narration：</span><br>
Ahem. Unfortunately, we did not have sufficient time to provide uniform equipment for the cavalry unit...<br>
Regardless, they all exhibit a burning fighting spirit under their lord's leadership...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Adorable Lord：</span><br>
My Owner's waiting for us down there~♪<br>
Troops, hear me! Go get 'em!<br>
Your target is my Owner, and my Owner alone!<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
My troops camped nearby won't be able to make it here in time due to the rainstorm...<br>
This is bad. Very bad. My camp is isolated and exposed...<br>
<br>
I can already hear rallying cries calling out from outside my tent.<br>
Then, the opposing lord lifts the flap and comes running into my tent!<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
So this is the end...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Adorable Lord：</span><br>
Owneeeeer! There's no escaping your fate!<br>
Come heeeere!<br>
<br>
She lunges at me like a cat, arms outstretched... without a weapon!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">In-Story Narration：</span><br>
The battle was over, and peace was restored to the lands...<br>
And so, the curtains fall on this act...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Cheshire：</span><br>
Owneeer! *squeeze* *cuddle* *sniff*<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Memphis：</span><br>
It's over now. You can stop hugging the Commander to death...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Cheshire：</span><br>
I'm not letting go of my Owner even if it's over! ...Hey, when did you get here, Memphis?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Memphis：</span><br>
I've been here this whole time!<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Well, I suppose that's the end...<br>
Or...?<br>

<br>
Several days have passed since the incident, and the onsen resort is back in holiday mode.<br>
Plays are held daily at night, and they've become a hugely popular attraction with the guests.<br>
I'm still on vacation now, and this morning, I received a report on the so-called "Spirited-Away Incident" slid in under my door.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
"The Onsen Resort Spiriting-Away Incident - By investigator Bristol."<br>
"...We live on an isolated island, completely unaware that the Great One is already in our midst."<br>
"...I saw that in the shadow of that violent storm, the white snow ceased to be snow."<br>
"...I saw that in the grimy ocean water, an indescribable beast was madly devouring its own twisted kind."<br>
"...I saw that when the rain gave way, the sky bared a foreboding smile. The dark shadows twisted and danced madly, blotting out the light of the lone flame."<br>
"...Human logic, human laws, they are meaningless here."<br>
"...I should not have dove deeper. I should have turned back. Yet, I keep moving deeper and deeper even now, searching for more..."<br>
"...For the forbidden miracles that are a mixture of unfathomable beings and mystery."<br>
"By the way, we've also attached copies of the other investigation team members' reports. Signed, Kirov and Saratoga."<br>
<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项1：What the hell is this?</span>'''''<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项2：Feels like I lost some sanity just from reading this...</span>'''''<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Akashi：</span><br>
Hehehe... The onsen resort, the Youkai Troupe, even the spiriting away... they earned me a pretty penny, nya♪<br>

<br>
The Spiriting-Away Incident?<br>
<br>
Before the Play<br>
This is a small story from before the Youkai Troupe performed their play...<br>
Onsen Resort - ???<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Dream-Eater Baku：</span><br>
Great. I knew you'd be willing to talk it out.<br>
*yawn*... So, our troupe has been entertaining the resort for a looong time, and we've never hurt a soul...<br>
So, be nice and pretend you didn't see us, alright?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Shinano ：</span><br>
This one has a question, as a fellow member of the Napping Club...<br>
Is this play of yours merely a contrivance to frighten my compatriots?<br>
<br>
The sleepy Shinano questioned the also sleepy Dream-Eater Baku with a sharp tone she seldom ever employs.<br>
This shook the Dream-Eater Baku in a way that made it impossible to nap, even though she wanted to.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Dream-Eater Baku：</span><br>
We're not gonna scare them. It's just an attraction – a part of the onsen resort, you see?<br>
But if you really don't want us pulling pranks on people, I'll be sure to tell them not to do that.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Shinano ：</span><br>
No, what I really meant was... why do you wear those outfits?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Dream-Eater Baku：</span><br>
Hmm? Because the youkai asked us to.<br>
The onsen resort gets a looot of customers, but nobody plays with them. So the play and the outfits are like a way to draw them closer.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Shinano ：</span><br>
What are you implying...? That a real Youkai Troupe exists beyond the boundary of the torii gate...?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Dream-Eater Baku：</span><br>
Pretty much. The barrier's entrance is starting to crumble, and it needs people to maintain it, so...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Shinano ：</span><br>
So what seemed like an act of greed on Akashi's part was actually for the greater good... I am sure the guests will adore the youkai...<br>
"Chief"... I have an idea that may benefit everyone...<br>

<br>
The Spiriting-Away Incident?<br>
<br>
Youkai, Spirits, and...<br>
This is a small story from before the Youkai Troupe performed their play...<br>
The Sakuran girls had finished tidying up and returned to their rooms to rest for a while.<br>
Little did they know that something strange was already in motion.<br>
Onsen Resort - Inn Main Building<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Sakawa：</span><br>
Is it just me, or does the resort look... wrong all of a sudden?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Miyuki：</span><br>
Yeah... It's almost like it was sent into a bizarro dimension...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Noshiro：</span><br>
It may have something to do with that rumble a moment ago... I'll go see Shinano.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Yura：</span><br>
Wait, Noshiro. It's a bad idea to split up. We should all stick together.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Owari：</span><br>
Hey, Yura... Am I seein' things, or is that cup some new hi-tech thing I haven't heard about?<br>
It's kinda... moving on its own.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Sakawa：</span><br>
You're right! It's moving! Oh god, it's FLOATING!<br>
What's going on?! Is there a ghost here?!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">???：</span><br>
Leeeave... Leeeave this place...<br>
You are not welcome heeere...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Miyuki：</span><br>
Eek! The rumors about youkai are true! They do exist!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">???：</span><br>
Leeeave! Turn back and leeeeave! Go awaaaay!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Sakawa：</span><br>
The voice is getting louder!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Yura：</span><br>
...I know where it's coming from.<br>
"Silence."<br>
<br>
Yura's other Self reached out and grasped something. Somehow, that made the ominous voice disappear.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Yura：</span><br>
...A will-o'-the-wisp, hmm?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Sakawa：</span><br>
What? Where? Did you catch something? I don't see anything!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Yura：</span><br>
It's too weak to assume physical form, so it's no wonder you can't see it.<br>
Now, what shall we do with you, little one? Something tells me you'll stir up trouble if I let you be...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Communicator：</span><br>
BEEP BEEP!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Yura：</span><br>
Hm? A call from Shinano?<br>

<br>
The Spiriting-Away Incident?<br>
<br>
Run Like a Rabbit<br>
This is a small story from before the Youkai Troupe performed their play...<br>
Onsen Resort - ???<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Shimakaze：</span><br>
Aha! I knew I wasn't imagining what I saw!<br>
Suruga! Look! Right there!<br>
...Suruga? Where did you go? Surugaaa!<br>
<br>
Shimakaze looked all around, but Suruga was nowhere to be found.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Shimakaze：</span><br>
Oh no! I must've became so engrossed in chasing that thing that I left Suruga behind!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Chouchinobake：</span><br>
So busy, so busy... Oh! Miss Rabbit!<br>
Whatcha doing here? The show's about to begin.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Shimakaze：</span><br>
Hm? Are you talking to me?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Chouchinobake：</span><br>
No, I meant the other rabbit beside you. Yes, I'm talking to you!<br>
C'mon, hurry off and let Kappa know the play is starting!<br>
Now, excuse me, there's a ton of other people I've gotta notify!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Shimakaze：</span><br>
Whoa! How is it so fast?!<br>
Hmm... You may be fast, but nobody is faster than me!<br>
Full steam ahead!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Kappa：</span><br>
O-okay... I'll be on my way...<br>
If you could... tell Yuki-Onna as well, that would be great...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Shimakaze：</span><br>
Yuki-Onna, you say? Got it! I'll find them in a jiffy!<br>
Full steam ahead once again!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Yuki-Onna：</span><br>
Why, thank you for letting me know, little bunbun.<br>
I hate to ask, but could you go and tell Tengu as well?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Shimakaze：</span><br>
Full steam ahead once again!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Tengu：</span><br>
Who do you take me for? A granny? Hmph. Go and tell–<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Shimakaze：</span><br>
Roger! Full steam ahead, no breaks!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Tengu：</span><br>
Wait! I haven't even told you her name yet! Come back here!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Shimakaze：</span><br>
*pant*... *pant*... That was the last one.<br>
Interesting how the youkai are organizing a play... I can hardly sit still just thinking about it!<br>
Come to think of it, I feel like I've forgotten something... What was I doing again?<br>
Oh, right! I was supposed to look for Suruga and I completely forgot!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Communicator：</span><br>
BEEP BEEP!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Suruga：</span><br>
Hey, Shimakaze, do you hear me?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Shimakaze：</span><br>
Whoa! Speak of the devil! I'm so glad to hear you're okay!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Suruga：</span><br>
...Okay?<br>
I'm gonna assume something happened while I was gone. What was it?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Shimakaze：</span><br>
Nothing! Nothing happened whatsoever!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Suruga：</span><br>
Oookay then. If you say so.<br>
Anyway, I'm in the theater's reception room with Shinano and the Youkai Troupe. They're in the middle of a meeting.<br>
Think you can make it here?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Shimakaze：</span><br>
Oh, has she already gained control over the Youkai Troupe? That's amazing!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Suruga：</span><br>
Uh... No. They're workshopping a surprise for the Commander's group when they arrive.<br>
Just come here and we'll tell you the rest.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Shimakaze：</span><br>
Working together with youkai to create a fantastic surprise... That sounds so much fun!<br>
I just know the guests are going to love whatever they come up with!<br>
I'll be there in a second!<br>
<br>
The girls at the time had no idea what their plan would turn into.<br>
Because what began as an innocent surprise would go on to become a major incident...<br>
