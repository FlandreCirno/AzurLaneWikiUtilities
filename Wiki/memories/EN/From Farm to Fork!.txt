From Farm to Fork!<br>
<br>
1 Farmlandia<br>
Just as I wrap up work for the day and prepare to leave the office, I hear light footsteps coming down the hall.<br>
In the blink of an eye, a small figure pops up right in front of my doorway.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Lung Wu：</span><br>
*pant*, *pant*... Thank goodness, I barely made it in time...<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Lung Wu? Why are you in such a hurry? Did something happen?<br>
<br>
Lung Wu shakes her head as she bends over to catch her breath.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Lung Wu：</span><br>
No, don't worry, it's nothing bad.<br>
I actually wanted to come earlier in the afternoon, but I got so wrapped up in my recipe research... Next thing I knew, it was already getting dark and so I had to hurry over!<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Umm... What does it mean?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Lung Wu：</span><br>
This... right here! Take a look and tell me if you're interested, Commander!<br>
<br>
Lung Wu hands me a flyer with some flashy text printed on it:<br>
"Farmlandia Grand Opening! Special Tour for Two: Enjoy 2 Days and 1 Night of the Best Countryside Views!"<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Huh. Is this that new joint project that Akashi and Owari launched together?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Lung Wu：</span><br>
Yes, that's the one! I wanted to go take a look because it might give me inspiration to cook up some new recipes.<br>
If you're not too busy over the weekend, I'd be really happy if you could maybe join me...<br>
<br>
Lung Wu looks at me timidly with upturned eyes, her tail wagging around anxiously like a puppy.<br>
<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项1：Of course I'll go with you.</span>'''''<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项2：I was just thinking I'd like a change of scenery.</span>'''''<br>
<br>
The girl's eyes light up with joy.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Lung Wu：</span><br>
Then, let's meet here on Saturday morning!<br>
I'll whip up some snacks for us to enjoy on the road ♪<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Sounds great. See you tomorrow.<br>

From Farm to Fork!<br>
<br>
2 Strawberries and Sweetness<br>
First thing Saturday morning, Lung Wu and I arrive at Farmlandia.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Owari：</span><br>
Yo, Commander! Lung Wu! Glad y'all could make it!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Akashi：</span><br>
Welcome to Farmlandia, nya!<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Good morning, you two.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Lung Wu：</span><br>
Good morning... Thank you so much for offering us this discount...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Owari：</span><br>
Haha, it's just good marketin'~ Anyway, I'm stoked ya two could come!<br>
After all, Lung Wu can help evaluate the quality of our ingredients, and if we can even get some review from the Commander... Ahaha ♪<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Lung Wu：</span><br>
Sure thing! I'll write down my feedback about every ingredient!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Akashi：</span><br>
Nyahaha... I'm sure we'll be able to get some great feedback from our illustrious guests here, nya.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Owari：</span><br>
Alrighty then, I don't wanna take up too much of your time with my yapping, 'cause there's a ton of stuff waiting for you at Farmlandia!<br>
<br>
With Akashi and Owari's recommendation, we decide to start with a visit to the strawberry orchard, where the berries are just ripe and in season.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Lung Wu：</span><br>
Commander, we've arrived at the strawberry farm!<br>
Wow, these strawberries look so succulent!<br>
<br>
Lush, green leaves overlap, with bright-red fruits peeking out through the gaps, filling the air with their sweet aroma.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Lung Wu：</span><br>
Let's pick some strawberries!<br>
<br>
Lung Wu is unable to contain her enthusiasm any longer. Taking a bucket in one hand, and my hand in the other, she bounds over to the strawberry plants and starts harvesting them skillfully.<br>
In no time at all, both of our baskets are filled to the brim with strawberries.<br>
She doesn't seem to have noticed, though, and keeps picking strawberries even as beads of sweat roll down her forehead.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Lung Wu, why don't we take a breather?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Lung Wu：</span><br>
Huh? But we only just got here...<br>
Oh, wow... Have we picked this many already?<br>
Alright, let's take a little break, Commander.<br>
I'll go wash a few for us to eat. Just give me a moment!<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Great. I'll help out as well.<br>
<br>
After washing the fresh strawberries, Lung Wu and I find a bench to sit on.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Lung Wu：</span><br>
Hmm, I guess I'm indeed a bit tired. Thank you for being so thoughtful, Commander!<br>
And, umm, I'm sorry for getting a bit carried away. When I start thinking about ingredients and recipes, I tend to lose sight of everything else...<br>
I kept thinking to myself, if we could share these delicious strawberries with everyone, they'd surely have big smiles on their faces...<br>
The more I was thinking about that, the more my hands kept moving on their own...<br>
I shouldn't have been so focused on picking the strawberries and instead thought more about sharing them with you first... because freshly picked strawberries taste the best!<br>
<br>
As she says that, Lung Wu holds a strawberry up to my lips with sparkles in her eyes.<br>
<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项1：(Take a bite)</span>'''''<br>
<br>
I eat the strawberry in a single bite. Its sweet, slightly tart taste and unique aroma spread throughout my mouth.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Woah, it's so delicious!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Lung Wu：</span><br>
See, Commander? You're smiling happily right now!<br>
That's all the motivation I need to get back to picking more!<br>
<br>
We have the strawberries we picked sent back to our place, and then set off for our next stop – the lake in the middle of Farmlandia.<br>

<br>
From Farm to Fork!<br>
<br>
3 Shells and Coolness<br>
We arrive at the lake in the middle of Farmlandia—<br>
The water's clear surface shimmers brightly, with the sunlight making the shoreline vegetation look even more vibrant.<br>
For a moment, I am captivated by the idyllic scenery around me, until I am pulled back to my senses by a familiar laughter.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Z52：</span><br>
Woooow! Look at how pretty the sky is! And the water, too!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">{namecode:536}：</span><br>
Ehhh? Aren't you just being dramatic again, Z52!<br>
<br>
When I turn towards the voices, I see two familiar figures – and they also happen to see me at the same time.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Z52：</span><br>
Ahh! It's the Commander and Lung Wu!<br>
<br>
Z52 practically dives towards me, somehow managing to come to a screeching halt before bowling me over.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Z52：</span><br>
What a coincidence! The two of you came to play, too!<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
We sure did. Z52, are you just here with U-31?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Lung Wu：</span><br>
G-good morning.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Z52：</span><br>
We were just on our way to see the waterfall. Do you two wanna come with?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">U-31：</span><br>
Jeez, learn to read the room! Can't you tell that those two are on a date right now?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Z52：</span><br>
Hwuh? A d-date?!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">U-31：</span><br>
Yeah, so, c'mon. Let's move it along here.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Z52：</span><br>
I get it, I get it! Okay, Commander, see ya later!<br>
<br>
U-31 hits me with a playful wink before dragging Z52 away.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">U-31：</span><br>
I'll see you around, Commander, hehe.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Uhh, thanks...<br>
<br>
I glance over at Lung Wu to see her reaction, but her eyes are glued to a nearby sign that says "Fish Hatchery."<br>
...So much so that she didn't even notice that U-31 and Z52 had left.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Lung Wu：</span><br>
It seems there's even a hatchery! Let's go take a look, Commander!<br>
<br>
As we walk down the winding cobblestone path in the hatchery area, Lung Wu intently observes the shellfish in the water.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Lung Wu：</span><br>
These look incredibly fresh... but I'm not sure they'd suit your palate...<br>
Oh, these mussels might be better. They can be a tad on the chewy side, but with the right seasoning...<br>
And they have clams here too! Hmm, to make them into soup, or to steam them with garlic and butter...<br>
<br>
Lung Wu is so caught up in thinking about how to cook these various ingredients that she doesn't even notice the gaps between the stones beneath her feet getting wider and wider.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Lung Wu?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Lung Wu：</span><br>
Oh?! Was I spacing out again? I'm so sorry about that!<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
No worries. You don't need to apologize at all.<br>
The walkway here is pretty uneven and slippery, so watch your step and don't fall.<br>
<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项1：Offer your hand to Lung Wu.</span>'''''<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项1）</span>'''''Let's hold hands as we walk.<br>
<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项1）</span>'''''Lung Wu's cheeks glow for a second, but she quickly looks down in embarrassment as soon as I take her hand.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Lung Wu：</span><br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项1）</span>'''''Th-thank you, Commander...<br>
<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项1）</span>'''''And so, the two of us continue strolling around the hatchery, hand-in-hand, searching for some good ingredients to put on the dinner table.<br>
<br>
As we make our way around the lake, we gather fresh ingredients like mussels and mandarin fish.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Lung Wu：</span><br>
Hmm, what should I do with the fish tonight? Braise or stew?<br>
<br>
Lung Wu's skirt and shoes get a bit wet during the process, but she's too absorbed in planning her cooking to even realize.<br>
I guess her enthusiasm is contagious. I watch Lung Wu talk about the menu with her lips curved in a big smile, and it makes me look forward to dinner even more.<br>

<br>
From Farm to Fork!<br>
<br>
4 Cherries and Hugs<br>
After going through all our scheduled activities, the two of us start wandering aimlessly and eventually find ourselves at the entrance of a cherry orchard.<br>
The cherries inside the orchard already appear to be ripe, but the gate is firmly locked with a sign reading "Closed for Construction."<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Lung Wu：</span><br>
Ehh? Cherries, at this time of year? And they look ripe and ready-to-eat too...<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Might be a variety that Owari bred.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Lung Wu：</span><br>
Owari is super amazing, isn't she? The cherries are all growing so well, as if they're begging to be eaten right now...<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Let me give her and Akashi a call and see if they can let us in as a favor.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Lung Wu：</span><br>
Really? I'd really appreciate that!<br>
<br>
After getting their permission, we step into the orchard.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
When Owari improved this strain, she didn't expect the trees to grow so tall. They had to close this area down for now because they couldn't set up adequate safety measures in time.<br>
Which is why they wanted to tell us: Be very careful when picking the cherries.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Lung Wu：</span><br>
I'll be fine! I often have to climb trees when I go looking for ingredients.<br>
<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项1：It's something you do often...?</span>'''''<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Lung Wu：</span><br>
Of course. A lot of food ingredients, like mangoes and lychees, grow high up off the ground.<br>
Though you can also buy them from the market, those freshly picked taste the best!<br>
Now then. Time to head up!<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Remember to be VERY careful.<br>
<br>
Lung Wu nods, rolls up her sleeves, then nimbly climbs up a cherry tree to start picking the fruit.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Lung Wu：</span><br>
Alright. With this much...<br>
Commander, I'm coming down—<br>
<br>
Before she can finish her words, a bird lands on a thin branch in front of Lung Wu.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Lung Wu：</span><br>
A wild dove? Err, not quite... It does look a bit like squab, so the meat should be pretty good...<br>
<br>
Lung Wu is still perched in a precarious place, and I can tell that she's starting to get lost in her thoughts about cooking again. I quickly try to grab her attention.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Lung Wu, it's dangerous up there! Please come down first!<br>
<br>
However, the moment I call out to her, the bird is also startled by my voice and flies straight into Lung Wu's face.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Lung Wu：</span><br>
Bwehh!<br>
<br>
Completely caught off-guard, Lung Wu loses her grip on the branch she was holding for support.<br>
<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项1：Catch Lung Wu.</span>'''''<br>
<br>
I rush forward and catch Lung Wu, holding her firmly in place. She must've been quite spooked by what just happened, because she is trembling in my arms while inadvertently wrapping her tail around my waist.<br>
All I can do is quietly pat her until she calms down.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
You're fine now. There's nothing to be scared of.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Lung Wu：</span><br>
*sniffle*... Th-thank you, Commander...<br>
<br>
I wait a few more minutes for Lung Wu to gather herself before setting her back down again.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Can you stand on your own?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Lung Wu：</span><br>
Yes... Thank you again for looking out for me...<br>
Oh no! The cherries!<br>
<br>
Lung Wu looks over at her basket in a panic to check the cherries she just collected. Seeing that they're safe and sound, she lets out a sigh of relief.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Lung Wu：</span><br>
Phew... Thank goodness the cherries didn't get crushed...<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
I'd rather the cherries get bruised than you, but all's well that ends well.<br>
It's starting to get late, so why don't we head back now?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Lung Wu：</span><br>
Okay! I'll make lots of delicious food once we get back!<br>

<br>
5 Showers and Surprises<br>
As soon as we get back to where we're staying, Lung Wu immediately heads to the outdoor kitchen in the backyard to start cooking.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Lung Wu, do you need my help?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Lung Wu：</span><br>
I'm fine, thanks. You must be tired too after a whole day of following me around, so just relax!<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
I didn't find it tiring at all...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Lung Wu：</span><br>
More importantly, Commander, the kitchen is a battlefield! It is not a place you should step into unless you've steeled yourself!<br>
<br>
Just then, a few cold raindrops strike my cheek; moments later, it turns into a full downpour.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Lung Wu：</span><br>
Oh no! Why's it raining all of a sudden?!<br>
<br>
Lung Wu turns toward the various food ingredients still spread out in front of her, while the rain grows heavier by the moment.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Lung Wu：</span><br>
Commander! Can you help me move everything inside?! Hurry, or the ingredients will go to waste!<br>
<br>
As Lung Wu starts gathering the ingredients, I jump in to help without missing a beat.<br>
As soon as everything has been taken inside, we get a call from Akashi and Owari.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Akashi：</span><br>
My sincerest apawlogies! I thought that an outdoor kitchen would create a more romantic atmosphere, nya...<br>
I guess in the future we get to put a roof over the backyard, and set up an indoor kitchen too!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Owari：</span><br>
Do you need some food right now...?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Lung Wu：</span><br>
Umm... Don't worry about it...<br>
<br>
Lung Wu notices a brazier in the corner of the living room.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Lung Wu：</span><br>
Akashi, Owari, do you mind if I use the brazier in the living room as a grill?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Akashi & Owari：</span><br>
- Go for it, nya! - Good idea!<br>
<br>
Lung Wu removes the grate from the barbecue grill outside and places it on top of the charcoal-burning brazier.<br>
She then puts a tea kettle on the grate and goes back to prepping the ingredients.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Lung Wu：</span><br>
...The heat is low, so the fish will need to cook slowly... In that case, cut it into small pieces, season it, then wrap it in tin foil and slow-roast it to give it a texture similar to dry-frying...<br>
Mussels get tough when grilled over an open flame, so I'll dice them up and stew them with fresh bamboo shoots...<br>
Okay. I can do this. With these fresh ingredients, even simple dishes will turn out delicious!<br>
Now, for the sauces... Hmm, I don't have a whole lot of seasonings here, but thankfully, I brought some five-spice powder and chu hou sauce...<br>
<br>
Lung Wu looks like she's about to overheat from processing too many things at once, so I once again offer to help her.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Lung Wu, are you sure there's nothing I can help you with?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Lung Wu：</span><br>
Umm... If you insist, let me see...<br>
Could you wash those fruits for me? We can have them after dinner.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Sure thing.<br>

<br>
6 Tea and Hearth<br>
As the rain continues to fall outside, tendrils of cold drift into the room.<br>
The heat from the glowing coals sends steam rising from the kettle on the grate, and the aroma of tea gently wafts around us.<br>
The light fragrance of the tea is soon joined by a deeper, richer aroma – that of mussels boiling away in a clay pot.<br>
The sound of tin foil being peeled back is followed by an explosion of garlicky, buttery goodness. The skin of the mandarin fish she's been cooking looks perfectly crispy and delicious.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Lung Wu：</span><br>
Mmmmh... that smells so good! It turned out really well!<br>
<br>
Lung Wu places a slice of the fish on a small plate, gently blows on it to cool it down, then sets it in front of me.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Lung Wu：</span><br>
Commander, this is for you! Please enjoy!<br>
<br>
I excitedly take a bite of the freshly cooked fish.<br>
The flesh has just the right amount of firmness while also melting in my mouth. The garlic and butter accentuate the fish's natural flavor perfectly without overpowering it.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Lung Wu：</span><br>
Commander, how's the taste?<br>
<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项1：Amazing! It's mouth-wateringly good!</span>'''''<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项2：Excellent! As one would expect from Master Chef Lung Wu!</span>'''''<br>
<br>
It's so delicious that I can't help but to beam at Lung Wu and give her a thumbs up.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Lung Wu：</span><br>
The taste might be a bit different from what you're used to since it wasn't cooked in the traditional manner. But with such great ingredients, I think it turned out pretty okay!<br>
Now, please try the mussel soup!<br>
<br>
Lung Wu ladles a bowl of soup for me, and the aroma of bamboo shoots and mussels immediately wafts up, tickling my nose.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Mmm, I can't wait!<br>
<br>
We enjoy the rest of our rustic dinner while listening to the pitter-patter of the rain outside the window.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Lung Wu：</span><br>
Fresh ingredients really are the best, aren't they? Next time, I want to invite everyone to try this!<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Sounds like a plan!<br>
If the weather's better tomorrow, let's get everyone here together.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Lung Wu：</span><br>
Wow, really? That'd be amazing!<br>
I should probably cover the expenses, then...<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
No worries. If we talk to Akashi and Owari and explain it can be a great opportunity for promotion, I'm sure they'll be able to cover the cost.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Lung Wu：</span><br>
Okay! I'll go send out the invites!<br>

<br>
7 Sharing and Friendship<br>
Just as we hoped, the next day dawns bright and clear with no rainclouds in sight. All our friends have gathered here at Farmlandia.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Hu Pen：</span><br>
Commander! The mighty tiger has cooooooome! Ah, shoot! Almost crashed into the well...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ning Hai：</span><br>
What an amazing view... Umm, are you sure we don't have to pay for this...?<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Yup. Don't worry about it – it's totally free.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Hu Pen：</span><br>
Where's Lung Wu, by the way? Is she already in the kitchen?<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
That's right. Lung Wu is already busy cooking. She's probably so focused that she hasn't even noticed everyone's arrived...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Sirius：</span><br>
Honourable Master, please allow Liverpool and me to help Lung Wu. It would also be an opportunity for us to hone our culinary skills...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Liverpool：</span><br>
That's right, Master! We can't let Lung Wu cook for this many people all by herself!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Hu Pen：</span><br>
Um, I don't think that's a good idea... It'll be good enough if just I go help her out...<br>
Ya should know how she can get at times. Lung Wu in the kitchen is a whole different person!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Sirius：</span><br>
Is that so? But Lung Wu normally seems like such a kind soul to me...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Liverpool：</span><br>
Heehee, I don't think she's that scary at all. Let's go together!<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Wait, hold on—<br>
<br>
Before I can finish, Sirius and Liverpool are already making their way toward the backyard kitchen.<br>
But it doesn't take long for the two to come back utterly defeated. Five minutes, to be exact.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Sirius：</span><br>
Lung Wu can be so intimidating...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Liverpool：</span><br>
I don't want to set foot in a kitchen ever again!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ping Hai：</span><br>
I've seen how intense Lung Wu can get when she's in her kitchen-crafting mode... But I can't believe even Liverpool couldn't handle it.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
I can't do much either.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ning Hai：</span><br>
The kitchen is Lung Wu's domain. There, everyone is the same...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Hu Pen：</span><br>
In any case, let's, uh, take a look around Farmlandia until the food is ready!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ning Hai：</span><br>
I picked some tasty fruit on the way here. Let's all enjoy it together!<br>
<br>
While we were strolling around Farmlandia, munching on the fruit Ning Hai had picked, Hu Pen caught up to us with good news.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Hu Pen：</span><br>
Everyone, it's time to eat!<br>
<br>
When we arrive at the table, a colorful and fragrant kaleidoscope of flavors unfolds before us: deep-fried mandarin fish with sweet-and-sour sauce; golden, jiggling steamed egg and clams drizzled with savory sauce; shrimp and tofu stew; fiery peppercorn chicken...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Lung Wu：</span><br>
I made a little bit of everything today, to take into consideration everyone's different tastes.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Liverpool：</span><br>
The kind and caring Lung Wu is back!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Lung Wu：</span><br>
Please dig in before the food goes cold!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Liverpool：</span><br>
Just one sec! With so many delicious, gorgeous dishes in front of us, you just HAVE to take a picture first!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Lung Wu：</span><br>
...Fine, but please make it quick. The food won't be as good if it cools down.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Liverpool：</span><br>
Got it! Everyone, gather 'round! Let's get a quick group photo with all the food!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Sirius：</span><br>
Miss Lung Wu, please come stand here in the middle along with our Honourable Master!<br>
<br>
The girls let me have the center-most spot in the group photo.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Liverpool：</span><br>
Ehehe, look at the camera on the count of three ♪<br>
Everyone, smile☆<br>
<br>
Even after taking the group photo, Lung Wu still has that genuine smile on her face.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Lung Wu：</span><br>
I'm so glad I got to cook for you and our friends, Commander! It really was so much fun!<br>
<br>
She then turns to the crowd of friends gathered around—<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Lung Wu：</span><br>
It's time to eat, everyone!<br>
