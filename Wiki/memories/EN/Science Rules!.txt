Chapter 1 - An Afternoon, One Day<br>
It was a clear afternoon...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Z23：</span><br>
Okay, lunch break is over! It's time for the afternoon lect... Hey, Laffey, wake up! You too, Javelin and Ayanami!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Laffey：</span><br>
Zzzzz...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ayanami：</span><br>
... Just... five more minutes...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Javelin：</span><br>
Jeez, the weather is too good! I need to be rested for when class ends~!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Z23：</span><br>
*Sigh*... It doesn't matter if we don't have any missions today, you can't be slacking around like this!<br>
Get! UP!<br>
<br>
KA-BOOM!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Laffey：</span><br>
Huh...!?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Z23：</span><br>
W-was that an explosion!?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ayanami：</span><br>
Are we being attacked...?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Javelin：</span><br>
I-I don't think so... I heard it coming from the classroom down the hall.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Z23：</span><br>
We'd better go check what it was!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Everyone：</span><br>
Yeah!<br>

Chapter 2 - A Big Experiment<br>
A few minutes later - In the science room<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Javelin：</span><br>
It came from this room!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Z23：</span><br>
*Cough*... What's with all this smoke...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">U-73：</span><br>
*Cough*... Welp, that's one more failed experiment...<br>
But on the other hand, failure leads to success! The next time, I'll get it right!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ayanami：</span><br>
Is she...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Laffey：</span><br>
One of Zed's friends?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Z23：</span><br>
So this is where you were, U-73... Wait, what were you even doing in there during the lunch break!?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">U-73：</span><br>
Hm? Oh, hey, Zed. During lunch break? Taking a break, what else? What about you? Done with the preparations for your afternoon lectures?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Laffey：</span><br>
If it weren't for Zed and that weird explosion, we could've had a longer nap.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ayanami：</span><br>
... I'm still not fully awake.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Z23：</span><br>
How is that my fault in any way!?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">U-73：</span><br>
Ahah, guess I woke you from your little nap... Sorry 'bout that...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Javelin：</span><br>
What were you doing in here? I heard a really loud explosion!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">U-73：</span><br>
Hahah! You'll be astonished once you know! I was, in fact, working on a big experiment!<br>
On what, you say? Why, I'm glad you asked...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Everyone：</span><br>
... WHAAAAT!?<br>

Chapter 3 - I Dream Big!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">U-73：</span><br>
I'm experimenting with practice ammunition made of candy! ... How's that? Have I caught your attention?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Javelin：</span><br>
I've... got so many issues with that that I'm at a loss for words...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Z23：</span><br>
It's strange and I don't know how to react to it... But I suppose you're doing earnest science...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">U-73：</span><br>
That's right! After all, I dream big, as I'm sure you can tell by my white lab coat!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Z23：</span><br>
I... don't think the lab coat signifies dreaming big.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">U-73：</span><br>
Don't fuss over the details!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Laffey：</span><br>
Candy torpedoes... Sounds yummy...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ayanami：</span><br>
Gluttony is a vice, not a virtue.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Z23：</span><br>
Why are you all taking it seriously too...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">U-73：</span><br>
Well? Don't you think it's a pretty wonderful dream to have? Come on, join me in making scientific progress!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">？？？：</span><br>
What an admirable dream. Ohoho, consider your offer officially accepted.<br>

Chapter 4 - A Real Experiment?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ayanami：</span><br>
... Yuubari?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Yuubari：</span><br>
I could have you court-martialed for using the science room without permission.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Javelin：</span><br>
R-really!? Can she do that!?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ayanami：</span><br>
Yuubari is part of the committee that oversees the science room.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">U-73：</span><br>
Oh gosh, I'm so sorry!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Yuubari：</span><br>
But, you love science and have your heart in the right place, so just this once I'll let it pass.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">U-73：</span><br>
Phew... Thank you, Yuubari!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Yuubari：</span><br>
Now, this smoke... *Sniff sniff*... Hmm, interesting...<br>
And what about these chemicals... Ah, I see, you're making practice ammunition made of candy?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">U-73：</span><br>
Yep, hit the nail on the head!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Javelin：</span><br>
Is it even possible, though!?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">U-73：</span><br>
It is! Remember that Christmas thing? Something called a "gear skin"?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Javelin：</span><br>
But is it edible!?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Yuubari：</span><br>
Hoho, it seems I must offer guidance to our new science department members.<br>
Come, I will show you what it means to conduct a real scientific experiment.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">U-73：</span><br>
Heck yeah!<br>

Chapter 5 - Science Is Never Done<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Javelin：</span><br>
S-so this is Akashi's and Yuubari's research room...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ayanami：</span><br>
The scale of it is impressive.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Laffey：</span><br>
Seems U-73 and Yuubari are already at it...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Yuubari：</span><br>
You see, U-73, the explosion happened because you mistreated the reagent for another. This is how you do it, see?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">U-73：</span><br>
T-that explains it!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Yuubari：</span><br>
Now, watch closely and learn...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">U-73：</span><br>
I had no idea you could even do that...!<br>
<br>
......<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Javelin：</span><br>
W-wow, it actually worked! They made a candy cane torpedo!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Laffey：</span><br>
... It's really sweet.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">U-73：</span><br>
P-please, Yuubari! Allow me to call you "Professor"!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Yuubari：</span><br>
Hum hum, no need to go so far. After all, science is always moving forward with no end in sight.<br>
That is something you must remember now that you've chosen to become a scientist.<br>
If you ever have any questions, don't hesitate to come to the science department.~<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">U-73：</span><br>
I will! I'll try to be the best scientist I can!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Z23：</span><br>
... U-73, I think this scientist schtick of yours may fit you better than your usual one...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Laffey：</span><br>
... I think Zed could be right.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ayanami：</span><br>
Should we just... leave the science room as it is now?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Z23：</span><br>
You're right. Wasn't Köln going to use it this afternoon...?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">U-73：</span><br>
Oh, oops, ahaha... I forgot to clean up...<br>
<br>
In the distance, one could hear Köln angrily exclaiming "who did this!? Who forgot to clean up before they left!?"<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">U-73：</span><br>
I-I think I'd better get going!<br>
<br>
Though U-73 now had a talented teacher to guide her, she still had a long ways to go to become a scientist.<br>
