Port - Dragon Empery Dorm<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Aquila：</span><br>
Lady Veneto, we have arrived.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Vittorio Veneto：</span><br>
Oh! Look at all these decorations. My, the Empery holiday mood is in full swing here.<br>
I'll have to make note of this... And that...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Littorio：</span><br>
See? I told you it was worth a visit. Since we have plenty of time to look around, does anything catch your eye?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Vittorio Veneto：</span><br>
Hmm... No, I can't seem to think of anything in particular.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Littorio：</span><br>
Then let's just walk around. Who knows, maybe we'll come across something interesting?<br>
Something like...<br>
<br>
BANG!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Vittorio Veneto：</span><br>
What?! What was that?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Littorio：</span><br>
It came from over there! Come on, follow me!<br>
<br>
The Sardegnian shipgirls followed the cloud of smoke rising into the air and soon arrived at its point of origin.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Hu Pen：</span><br>
Greetings! ...Oh, I don't see you girls every day. Do you have business at our dorm or something?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Littorio：</span><br>
Ah! If it isn't Hu Pen and Fei Yuen. It's been a while.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Fei Yuen：</span><br>
It's the Sardegnians! The cuisine-knowers! Hello hello!<br>
Yat Sen said anyone who visits is a guest, so just come to Lady Yuen if you need something!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Aquila：</span><br>
Um... thank you? I should mention that we aren't here on a formal visit or anything.<br>
Rather, we're here to watch and learn from how the Dragon Empery celebrates its holidays.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Vittorio Veneto：</span><br>
Indeed. I hope we're not intruding on anything.<br>
See, many of our fellow Sardegnians have expressed an interest in your holiday customs.<br>
We would like to decorate our dormitory in the same style as yours and perhaps even have some fun together.<br>
Aquila here is our most knowledgeable lady when it comes to your culture, so we brought her along.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Aquila：</span><br>
Please, my knowledge starts and ends at what I've read in comic books.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Hu Pen：</span><br>
I see! I understand perfectly!<br>
You've come to the right place, my friends!<br>
But, your timing isn't the best. We have our hands full in the kitchen and nobody's available to give you a tour right now!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Littorio：</span><br>
That's fine. We'll just wander around and see for ourselves.<br>
One thing we're wondering about, though – was that an explosion just a minute ago?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Hu Pen & Fei Yuen：</span><br>
- No! - It wasn't an explosion!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Fei Yuen：</span><br>
It was a culinary experiment, that's all!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Hu Pen：</span><br>
A what...? Oh, yeah, what she said! She's trying to come up with a new dish!<br>
With a kind of stir-frying. The kind that goes "bang"!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Aquila：</span><br>
Oh, I've read about this in a comic! It's the "big flame, ample oil" technique, no?<br>
You crank the heat up, use copious amounts of oil, and fry like you're trying to make the food blow up. That explains the noise we heard!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Vittorio Veneto：</span><br>
It does...?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Hu Pen：</span><br>
I mean...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Fei Yuen：</span><br>
Y-yeah! I'm surprised you know one of our country's most well-kept cooking secrets!<br>
If you don't believe us, we'll cook a feast for you tonight! That's sure to help with your own festival prep.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Littorio：</span><br>
Sounds like a promising idea. What's your take, Veneto?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Vittorio Veneto：</span><br>
No objections here. While we're at it, though, can we invite others to join us? Us Sardegnians surely aren't the only ones interested.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Fei Yuen：</span><br>
Go right ahead! We'll make enough of this new dish to feed every last guest! You have Lady Yuen's word on this!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Littorio：</span><br>
A bold proposition. We accept. Now, if you'll excuse us, we have other places we want to check out.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Fei Yuen：</span><br>
Sure! See you later!<br>
<br>
......<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Fei Yuen & Hu Pen：</span><br>
Phew...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Fei Yuen：</span><br>
They would so have caught on to us if it weren't for my quick wit...<br>
We can NOT let the other factions find out how bad of a cook Chi An is!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Hu Pen：</span><br>
Ahahahah...<br>
To be honest, I'm worried about her.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">???：</span><br>
Worried? Why?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Hu Pen：</span><br>
I mean, she just made the kitchen go kaboom, so...<br>
Wait, Chi An?! Err, um... I was just kidding!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Fei Yuen：</span><br>
Y-yeah! We both know you would never intentionally blow up the kitchen and leave a huge mess!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Chi An：</span><br>
Um, that's kind of rude.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Hu Pen：</span><br>
What we're saying is: it's okay! C'mon, Fei Yuen, say something!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Fei Yuen：</span><br>
Huh?<br>
Oh, uh... Chi An, your kitchen adventure was astonishing! It almost moved Lady Yuen to tears!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Chi An：</span><br>
*sniffle*... I can't believe this!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Hu Pen：</span><br>
Look what you did. You made her cry!<br>
Let's clean this place up before poor Chi An feels any worse!<br>
<br>
After moving through the kitchen like a cleaning tornado, the girls eventually got it looking like it did before.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Chi An：</span><br>
Whew... Good as new. Thanks, you two.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Fei Yuen：</span><br>
Don't thank me. As long as you're happy, I'm happy!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Chi An：</span><br>
No, you deserve it. I DID blow up the kitchen and cause a mess for you to clean up. I'm sorry.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Hu Pen：</span><br>
It's not like it's the first time...<br>
Ah, forget it! We have more important things to focus on!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Chi An：</span><br>
True. The Sardegnians are visiting for dinner tonight.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Fei Yuen：</span><br>
Right, right! They're real gourmands, so we need to plate up a whole feast!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Chi An：</span><br>
Yes, but who's going to cook?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Hu Pen：</span><br>
Lung Wu, obviously!<br>
When it comes to cooking, you can trust her to deliver!<br>
Speaking of Lung Wu, I haven't actually seen her all day. Do either of you know where she is?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Chi An：</span><br>
Hm... She's not at the port today.<br>
She, Yat Sen, and a few others are out buying things for Lunar New Year. Did nobody tell you?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Hu Pen：</span><br>
Now that you mention it... She DID tell me to get my food from the canteen today.<br>
Hold on, doesn't that mean there are no good cooks available?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Fei Yuen：</span><br>
Then how are we supposed to serve dinner to the Sardegnians tonight?!<br>
No, calm down, Lady Yuen... You've been in this situation countless times... Just calm down and think about it...<br>
I've got it! Let's go ask the Commander for advice!<br>

<br>
Port - Dragon Empery Dorm<br>
Looking up the words "Huan Ch'ang" written on the door plate, I couldn't help but wonder... How did it come to this?<br>
Commander's office, 30 minutes earlier...<br>
SLAM!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Hu Pen：</span><br>
We're in trouble, Commander!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Fei Yuen：</span><br>
Lady Yuen needs your help, Commander!<br>
<br>
The door to my office is thrown open, and in jumps two little shipgirls.<br>
Seeing the anxious looks on their faces makes me tense up.<br>
<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项1：What's wrong?</span>'''''<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项2：Let's take a deep breath now.</span>'''''<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Fei Yuen：</span><br>
Okay, let me explain...<br>
Some Sardegnian girls came to visit, and I ran my big stupid mouth and promised them a huge feast tonight...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Hu Pen：</span><br>
It's not your fault, Yuen! You didn't know all our cooks were away today. I didn't either, or else I'd have stopped you!<br>
But what's done is done, and we need your help, Commander!<br>
Not only are we known for our delicious food, we also finished our holiday preparations the earliest so we have no excuse to delay!<br>
It's gonna bring terrible shame to our name if we serve our guests food that tastes like crap!<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
(Sardegna came to visit? Oh, yeah, Veneto did say something about wanting to celebrate Lunar New Year.)<br>
(They probably came to the Empery dorm, then this and that happened...)<br>
(Wait a second, something feels odd here.)<br>
(Why did she "run her mouth" to begin with? Was she just boasting, or was she covering something up?)<br>
<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项1：Why did you invite them to dinner to begin with?</span>'''''<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Hu Pen：</span><br>
Well... Ahahaha... You know...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Fei Yuen：</span><br>
It's complicated...<br>
<br>
They were forthcoming a moment ago, and now they're reluctant to share anything, looking back towards the door.<br>
I follow their gazes and spot a figure in the hallway – Chi An, peeking in through the gap.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Chi An：</span><br>
Oh dear... Why me...<br>
Ahem... Good morning, Commander!<br>
<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项1：It's afternoon.</span>'''''<br>
Ah, right! You have to forgive me, I've been rather forgetful as of late.<br>
<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项1：Have you had lunch yet?</span>'''''<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Chi An：</span><br>
Lunch? Not yet.<br>
I was actually making lunch earlier, but I had a small... accident.<br>
As a result, it's on hold for now. Heehee!<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
(I get it. The Sardegnian visitors saw this "accident" and Fei Yuen invited them to dinner as a coverup.)<br>
(Knowing these three, they only made it harder to ignore what happened.)<br>
<br>
I shoot Chi An a look of doubt – among other feelings – as she tries to act cute.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Chi An：</span><br>
Don't look at me like that... It hurts my feelings.<br>
I tried, okay? I really tried to cook something.<br>
I just need to keep practicing and practicing. I'll be able to make good food one day, I'm sure of it!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Hu Pen：</span><br>
Yeah, right...<br>
Ahem! Sorry, that's a distant future issue. We've got a near future issue to deal with! Like, TONIGHT near-future!<br>
You're a good cook yourself, aren't you, Commander? What if we just let you handle the...<br>
<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项1：(Say nothing.)</span>'''''<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项2：(Say nothing.)</span>'''''<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项3：(Say nothing.)</span>'''''<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Hu Pen：</span><br>
...I'll take that as a no.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Fei Yuen：</span><br>
I think the Commander wants to say we got ourselves into this mess, so we should solve it ourselves.<br>
Don't you know your way around the kitchen, Hu Pen? You're always helping Lung Wu with her cooking.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Hu Pen：</span><br>
Oh yeah, I do.<br>
While I'm no five-star chef like her, I certainly can make some good eatin' with the right ingredients!<br>
The problem is – we don't have the ingredients...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Fei Yuen：</span><br>
Let's ask Huan Ch'ang! She'll get the bagua to point us in the right direction!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Hu Pen：</span><br>
I don't think that's such a hot idea... She won't like diving a solution to a problem of our making.<br>
But... what if the Commander asked for us?<br>
If anyone can persuade her, it's the Commander!<br>
Chi An, say something! Convince the Commander to do it!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Chi An：</span><br>
Okay... Commander, do it for me? Pleeease?<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
......<br>
(Dang it. I got caught up in a mess.)<br>
(Probably.)<br>
<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项1：(Ring the outdoor phone.)</span>'''''<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Huan Ch'ang：</span><br>
Who is it?<br>
...Oh?<br>
{{折叠面板|内容结束}}

{{折叠面板|标题=Huan Ch'ang's Decision|选项=3|主框=1|样式=primary|展开=是}}
<br>
Huan Ch'ang's Place - Living Room<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Huan Ch'ang：</span><br>
Have a seat.<br>
My divinations told me unexpected visitors were coming, but I sure didn't think it would you and an entourage of Empery girls, Commander.<br>
What brings you here? Do you need my help?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Fei Yuen：</span><br>
So you knew we were coming! That's our bagua fortune-teller for you!<br>
And yeah, that's exactly why we're here!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Hu Pen：</span><br>
See, we're actually in a real pickle here...<br>
We invited another faction to dine with us tonight, but Lung Wu is away and I'm the only one who can cook the food.<br>
And I'm not even half the chef she is!<br>
But! I can make up for it if I can just get some good ingredients!<br>
Which is what we need help with! Huan Ch'ang, can you please divine where to find ingredients that'll make delicious food?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Huan Ch'ang：</span><br>
In order to do that, I need to know the cause and consequences of the events that led you to this point.<br>
You'll need to give me more details.<br>
For a start, why did you suddenly invite them to dinner if Lu Wung wasn't there?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Fei Yuen：</span><br>
...It was because I ran my mouth and made a promise I couldn't keep. Sorry.<br>
Please don't be mad at Lady Yuen...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Hu Pen：</span><br>
L-look, what's done is done!<br>
We can't let down our guests, or we'll sully both Lung Wu's name and the rep of our cuisine!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Huan Ch'ang：</span><br>
Chi An, are they telling the truth?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Fei Yuen：</span><br>
Um... Umm...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Chi An：</span><br>
It's okay, little ones. I know you don't want to be rude, but you don't need to walk on eggshells for my sake.<br>
In truth, this was all my fault. I was in the kitchen, and–<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Huan Ch'ang：</span><br>
You insisted on cooking, caused an accident, and just by pure bad luck, the Sardegnians happened to be visiting at the same time. Is that right?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Chi An：</span><br>
Huh? Wait, did you divine all that?<br>
No, it doesn't matter. Yes, you're exactly right. I caused an explosion in the kitchen.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Huan Ch'ang：</span><br>
......<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Chi An：</span><br>
It's fine. You can laugh at me.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Huan Ch'ang：</span><br>
I can?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Chi An：</span><br>
Yes.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Huan Ch'ang：</span><br>
......<br>
Heh... Heheh...<br>
You actually blew up the kitchen. Wow. I knew you were a bad cook, but this is something else.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Chi An：</span><br>
Hmph. It's not THAT funny.<br>
Just because I'm from the Empery doesn't mean I was born with great cooking skills.<br>
That's a stereotype, you know.<br>
What I lack in talent, I'm trying to make up for with hard work and practice. I'll get good at it eventually.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Huan Ch'ang：</span><br>
Of course. Keep at it. Now, how do you want me to help?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Chi An：</span><br>
It's simple. We'd like you to divine where to find the ingredients Hu Pen needs.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Huan Ch'ang：</span><br>
Just to be sure – you're not going to "help" in the kitchen, are you?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Chi An：</span><br>
Heehee, no. I know my limits.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Huan Ch'ang：</span><br>
One last thing, then. Commander, as the one who knocked on my door, what is your opinion on this?<br>
The heavens discern not between matters great and small, good or evil.<br>
I'd like to hear a reason for me to call upon the bagua.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
(Is she asking me to give the final push?)<br>
(Alright then...)<br>
<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项1：We already have the right time and right place. What we need is the right person.</span>'''''<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项2：We'll never know what the heavens decide if we don't at least try.</span>'''''<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项3：I need your help, my lovely Huan Ch'ang!</span>'''''<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Huan Ch'ang：</span><br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项1）</span>'''''Such sophistry...<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项1）</span>'''''But, given the current situation, I suppose it's not beyond the realm of possibility...<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项1）</span>'''''If you insist...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Huan Ch'ang：</span><br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项2）</span>'''''So you're leaving it to me?<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项2）</span>'''''But, given the current situation, I suppose it's not beyond the realm of possibility...<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项2）</span>'''''If you insist...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Hu Pen & Fei Yuen：</span><br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项3）</span>'''''...Wow.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Huan Ch'ang：</span><br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项3）</span>'''''Hey!<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项3）</span>'''''Wh-what's with you? You don't say that in front of people...<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项3）</span>'''''Ahem... Alright... I'll start divining now...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Huan Ch'ang：</span><br>
......<br>
Of paths fiftyfold, only forty-nine may be divined. The hidden truth is...<br>
...I've got it.<br>
You can catch good fish at the port's freshwater lake.<br>
<br>
For some reason, she shoots me a glance when she says that.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
(Hm? Is she talking about the same freshwater lake where we went fishing the other day?)<br>
(Does she want to fish some more?)<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Hu Pen：</span><br>
Really?!<br>
Hooray! Let's get going, then!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Huan Ch'ang：</span><br>
I'll come with you.<br>
Since the bagua pointed us there, now I'm curious to see what ingredients we'll get.<br>

<br>
Port - Freshwater Lake<br>
Huan Ch'ang led the way, bringing us beneath a canopy by the lakeside.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Huan Ch'ang：</span><br>
Here we are.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Hu Pen：</span><br>
Whoa! I never knew we had a place like this by the lake!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Fei Yuen：</span><br>
This looks like a great spot for fishing!<br>
Oh, shoot! Lady Yuen forgot to bring a fishing rod!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Huan Ch'ang：</span><br>
I did.<br>
As they say, plan ahead for rainy days. Opportunities come only to those who prepare for them.<br>
<br>
Huan Ch'ang produces a fishing rod seemingly out of nowhere.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Hu Pen：</span><br>
That's a looong rod!<br>
Hey, do you come here to fish often, Huan?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Huan Ch'ang：</span><br>
Only sometimes. To clear my mind. I wouldn't call it "often."<br>
In addition, I'm not the only one who comes here to relax.<br>
<br>
Huan Ch'ang shoots me a glance.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
(The cat's out of the bag.)<br>
<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项1：(Take out your own fishing rod.)</span>'''''<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Fei Yuen：</span><br>
Oh! The Commander brought one, too!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Hu Pen：</span><br>
Hang on, there's not just a tackle box under the canopy. There's a cooking stove and a fridge as well!<br>
You could set up camp here, or cook food for a picnic!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Chi An：</span><br>
Gosh. Huan Ch'ang's "divination" sure led us to a special spot, hm?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Huan Ch'ang：</span><br>
Ahem...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Chi An：</span><br>
It IS a nice place. It's got a great atmosphere, it's compact, and it has all the equipment you need.<br>
Say, do you come here often with the Commander?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Huan Ch'ang：</span><br>
Well... occasionally.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Chi An：</span><br>
Right. "Occasionally."<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Huan Ch'ang：</span><br>
The first time really was a coincidence!<br>
I came out to fish one day, and it suddenly started raining.<br>
I knew it was going to, because I divined it. I came prepared and set up under the canopy.<br>
Then, just as I thought I was going to be fishing alone, someone came seeking shelter...<br>
<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项1：Right under that canopy.</span>'''''<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Huan Ch'ang：</span><br>
My only catch that day was a fishing buddy. I couldn't go home emptyhanded.<br>
Ever since then, the canopy has stood right here.<br>
As time went on and we fished more together, we slowly added more amenities and upgrades.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Fei Yuen：</span><br>
Ahh, no wonder...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Hu Pen：</span><br>
Wait, "couldn't go home emptyhanded"? You didn't catch a single fish that day?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Huan Ch'ang：</span><br>
Well... Fishing is about doing all you can and letting fate run its course.<br>
The fact that I didn't catch anything just means the heavens didn't ordain it! Do you understand?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Fei Yuen：</span><br>
I don't...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Huan Ch'ang：</span><br>
It's fine if you don't...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Hu Pen：</span><br>
Enough talking! Can I fish now, Huan?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Huan Ch'ang：</span><br>
Of course. The whole reason we came here is to catch ingredients for your dinner.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Fei Yuen：</span><br>
Lady Yuen wants to try, too!<br>
<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项1：Here. Use my rod.</span>'''''<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Fei Yuen：</span><br>
Yay! Thanks, Commander!<br>
Heheh! Watch this! I'm gonna catch the biggest fish you've ever seen!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Huan Ch'ang：</span><br>
Easy, now. Fishing is a matter of patience.<br>
Hold your rod steady. Don't scare the fish off, or they'll never–<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Fei Yuen：</span><br>
Nibble! I got a nibble!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Hu Pen：</span><br>
Me too!<br>
<br>
Huan Ch'ang's advice is interrupted by the girls both getting something on the hook. They reel in their catches – two large fish.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Huan Ch'ang：</span><br>
WHAT?!<br>
This has to be beginner's luck...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Hu Pen：</span><br>
It's ginormous! You were right, Huan! These are good fish!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Fei Yuen：</span><br>
Got another on the hook!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Huan Ch'ang：</span><br>
A... Another?<br>
Is this your luckiest day of the year or what?!<br>
<br>
Shocked by their success, Huan Ch'ang starts quickly divinating.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Huan Ch'ang：</span><br>
No... The bagua isn't aligned right... How are you catching so many?<br>
Unless... the lake itself...<br>
...Have people been overfeeding the fish?<br>
But even then, that doesn't explain how you've caught so many big fish in a row.<br>
Fei Yuen, Hu Pen, may I try?<br>
Since you've been having such luck, I might be able to catch even bigger fish.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Fei Yuen：</span><br>
Go ahead!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Hu Pen：</span><br>
You're on, Huan! Let's see who can catch the biggest fish!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Huan Ch'ang：</span><br>
Heheh. I won't go easy on you.<br>
I've fished with the Commander so much that I'm a fishing master now!<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
(What? Why is she making this into a competition now?)<br>
(Good luck to her, I suppose...)<br>
<br>
Just like that, a fishing competition began between these two.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Well, I think the moral of this story is...<br>
Divination won't help a bad fisher.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Huan Ch'ang：</span><br>
Commandeeer!<br>

Port - Dragon Empery Dorm's Kitchen<br>
Lung Wu heard about the incident at the dorm and hurried back to the port. By the time she was back, the sky had grown dark.<br>
Meanwhile, the Empery's kitchen is operating at full speed in preparation for the dinner.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Lung Wu：</span><br>
...What's going on?! Someone explain!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Hu Pen：</span><br>
Lung Wu! You're back!<br>
We're cooking up a feast for our guests, that's what!<br>
Ah, the fish soup is done! Come here and give it a taste!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Lung Wu：</span><br>
Uh... Thanks?<br>
No, forget about the soup! Why are you cooking up a feast?<br>
And who are the guests?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Chi An：</span><br>
Hey, does anyone know what I'm supposed to do with this?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Hu Pen：</span><br>
Whoa, whoa! You need to dish that up in a very specific way!<br>
Leave it be! I'll show you in a second!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Lung Wu：</span><br>
What's Chi An doing in the kitchen?!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Hu Pen：</span><br>
Don't worry, she's forbidden from touching the pans! Just eat some soup and relax! I'll explain everything later!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Lung Wu：</span><br>
Not so fast! You need to tell me what's–<br>
Aaand she's gone...<br>
<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项1：You don't need to worry about them.</span>'''''<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Lung Wu：</span><br>
Oh, Commander. Hello.<br>
Wait, why are YOU in the kitchen? Let me guess...<br>
<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项1：No, I'm not cooking anything today.</span>'''''<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项2：They did all the work, not me.</span>'''''<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Lung Wu：</span><br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项1）</span>'''''You're telling me THEY cooked all this?<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项1）</span>'''''Not bad. Not bad at all.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Lung Wu：</span><br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项2）</span>'''''Really? Wow. I'm impressed.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Lung Wu：</span><br>
So, who are the guests? And who invited them?<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Does it really matter?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Lung Wu：</span><br>
Yes, it does!<br>
That said... I can't deny that this soup is pretty good.<br>
Maybe I should trust them a little more...<br>
This is a trial, and it's theirs alone to overcome. I'll let–<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Hu Pen：</span><br>
No, no, no! You're doing it all wrong, Chi An!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Chi An：</span><br>
What? I am? Okay... How about this?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Hu Pen：</span><br>
Nope! Still wrong!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Lung Wu：</span><br>
...I will NOT let Chi An cook!<br>
She should not be allowed inside the kitchen!<br>
*sigh*... And here I hoped they could handle it on their own, at least this once...<br>
<br>
Lung Wu covers her face with her hands and mutters despondently. Despite this, I can see a smile on her face.<br>
<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项1：You want to do it yourself?</span>'''''<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Lung Wu：</span><br>
Yes. Even if it means leaving out their help!<br>
Also, I'll make you one special dish as thanks for helping them as much as you did.<br>
Any theme you want. Just name it, and I'll try to create it!<br>
<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项1：How about a dish based on happiness?</span>'''''<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Lung Wu：</span><br>
...You really know how to pick a theme.<br>
Then I'll make an additional dish as a bonus, based on the idea of a family reunion.<br>
Now, those dishes aren't going to make themselves! I'd better get started!<br>
<br>
Lung Wu dons an apron and plunges into the busy kitchen.<br>
With her at the helm, this dinner will no doubt go without a hitch.<br>
A happy ending for everyone.<br>
The Sardegnians and everyone else they invited all relished in the feast the Empery cooked up for them.<br>
But, as a result, the stereotype that everyone from the Empery is great at cooking solidified even further.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Chi An：</span><br>
It shouldn't be that way!<br>
<br>
The End<br>
