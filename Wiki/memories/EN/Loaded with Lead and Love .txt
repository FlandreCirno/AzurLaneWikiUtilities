Chapter 1 - The Cleaning Crew<br>
Though I was supposed to be taking the day off, I didn't particularly have anything I wanted to do, so I soon found myself wandering aimlessly around the port.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">？？？：</span><br>
Hey, Suffolk! Let's have a race to see who can get across the corridor faster!<br>
Eh? I think I'll pass~ Besides, I can't keep up with you anyway, so just let me space out over here~<br>
I take my eyes off you two for a second, and....<br>
<br>
I could hear the voices of Kent and Suffolk coming from the Royal Navy dormitory, but who was this third voice?<br>
<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项1：Take a look</span>'''''<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Sheffield：</span><br>
Kent, though I commend your dedication towards staying active, you may find that you cannot clean the floor by running all over it.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Kent：</span><br>
I understand... it's my mistake!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Sheffield：</span><br>
Suffolk, you haven't moved from that cranny since before I left. It must either be very cozy, or very, very, dirty.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Suffolk：</span><br>
Eh? Y-y-you've got it wrong! I've been cleaning properly!<br>
<br>
Sure enough, it was Sheffield, who recently was assigned to secretary duties.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Sheffield：</span><br>
Hm... Master? Do you require something?<br>
So, you're just taking a stroll...?<br>
Well then, if you don't mind, please take a few steps back. You're soiling the freshly-mopped floor.<br>
<br>
Ah... as professionally merciless as ever...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Sheffield：</span><br>
Also, since you're just taking a stroll, I would like to recommend you a more pleasant place to stroll to. Anywhere but here, actually, since we are currently busy cleaning.<br>
If you return in, say, about an hour, there may be the possibility of tea and scones. Just maybe.<br>
<br>
As soon as she finished talking, Sheffield promptly returned to her cleaning. So this is the absolute professionalism that even has Belfast's seal of approval...<br>
Well, since I really did have nothing better to do, I might as well come back later.<br>

Chapter 2 - For the Sake of "Cleaning"<br>
Port - Shop<br>
Early in the morning, I headed to Akashi's shop in order to take care of some business. To my surprise, someone was there before me.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Akashi：</span><br>
Sheffield's request for Akashi was a bit unreasonable, but... Hehe, I managed to pull through in the end, nya!<br>
Tada! Akashi's "Special Cleaning Bullets," nya!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Sheffield：</span><br>
Impressive work as always, Akashi.<br>
<br>
Sheffield was wearing the same poker face as usual, but her eyes seemed to glimmer with excitement.<br>
<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项1："Akashi's Special Cleaning Bullets? What are those?"</span>'''''<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Sheffield：</span><br>
Master...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Akashi：</span><br>
Ehehe, confused-looking customer over there. Yes, you, nya! Let Akashi demonstrate -<br>
<br>
(Boom!)<br>
In a single fluid motion, Sheffield loaded the "cleaning bullets" into her pistol and unloaded them into the wall.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Akashi：</span><br>
Nyaa?! W-woah... what are you doing, nya! That's not what I meant by demonstrate!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Sheffield：</span><br>
Showing is more straightforward than explaining.<br>
<br>
Something began to emerge from the place that Sheffield shot at... Bubbles...?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Sheffield：</span><br>
As you can see, I asked Miss Akashi to make me bullets containing detergent.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Akashi：</span><br>
The heads are custom-made with special materials and will release the detergent upon impact, nya!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Sheffield：</span><br>
Indeed. With this, I will be able to clean some things that are not easily reached.<br>
<br>
I couldn't decide if this was an awesome idea or a terrible one...<br>
But it's rare to see Sheffield happy(?), so I suppose I'll let her have her fun.<br>

Chapter 3 - A Maid's Hobby<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Sheffield：</span><br>
Master, are you interested in how we maids spend our everyday life?<br>
If that's the case, please stop by during the next day off. We'll be sure to extend our Royal hospitality to you.<br>
<br>
So on the next Sunday, I made my way over to the Royal dormitory and rung the bell...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Sheffield：</span><br>
Master, you're here. Is there something I can do for you?<br>
H-huh...? I thought...<br>
It's a joke. Please come in.<br>
<br>
I expected nothing less of Sheffield's room. Impeccable, without a trace of dust.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Sheffield：</span><br>
Here, Master. Please have some black tea.<br>
<br>
A Royal maid's skill is truly formidable... a normal person would be hard-pressed to make tea of this caliber.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Sheffield：</span><br>
Well then, Master, you may leave whenever you want.<br>
<br>
Somehow... I don't feel like I'm the "Master" here at all...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Sheffield：</span><br>
You're overthinking things. When I said "you may leave whenever you want," I merely meant that you may stay as long as you like.<br>
<br>
Then... does that mean other people can't stay as long as they like? Does Sheffield kick them out?<br>
Also, there seems to be something on the table... is this a disassembled pistol?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Sheffield：</span><br>
Guns require maintenance as well. If they are not taken care of, they will stop working, just like lazy commanders.<br>
<br>
As terse as ever... Come to think of it, Sheffield, doesn't this gun look a bit like your rigging?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Sheffield：</span><br>
It's just a hobby of mine. Although if you're interested, Master...<br>
Allow me to tell you everything you need to know about "work" firearms, including selection, disassembly, maintenance, accessories, and technique...<br>
<br>
It's a bit like drinking out of a fire hose, but your lecture is undoubtedly quite interesting.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Sheffield：</span><br>
... Is that so. In that case, I will make sure your body remembers every detail. Prepare yourself.<br>
<br>
Although her voice was still calm as always, I could somehow sense a passion, burning deep within her.<br>
And thus, my day off turned into a seminar on firearms.<br>

Chapter 4 - Motivation?<br>
Port - Office<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Sheffield：</span><br>
Master, please wipe your feet first.<br>
<br>
In addition to her normal duties as secretary, Sheffield insisted on keeping the office clean as well.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Sheffield：</span><br>
Cleaning is a joy, after all. There is nothing more satisfying than seeing everything in order.<br>
<br>
That is true. Ever since you took on the secretary position, the office has been refreshing and pristine.<br>
I can't deny that my work productivity has increased as well, but...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Sheffield：</span><br>
I simply would like to point out that there are things that even I cannot keep in order. For example, this indolent Master here who loves to daydream.<br>
<br>
What I was going to say was, I'm not sure if it's due to the clean work environment or to your strictness.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Newcastle：</span><br>
Sorry to intrude, Master. Belfast asked me to deliver this message to you.<br>
Here you go. Don't worry about me, it's just how we handle internal affairs. Moreover, I figured I would take this opportunity to visit a fellow member of the Maid Team.<br>
Sheffy, you look like you're quite accustomed to secretary work.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Sheffield：</span><br>
I have no idea who you're talking to. Or what you're talking about.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Newcastle：</span><br>
Hehe, I see. I was a bit worried at first, but it seems like everything is fine over here.<br>
Commander, Sheffy might sound rude at times, but she would absolutely never do anything that she didn't want to do.<br>
<br>
I see... In other words...<br>
(Bang!)<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Sheffield：</span><br>
How negligent. I forgot to clean up these two dirty spots.<br>
<br>
I felt a cold gust go past my ear... Just now, was that a cleaning bullet?<br>
Sheffield stood there calmly as if she hadn't just fired a warning shot into the wall.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Sheffield：</span><br>
I thought I had already cleaned here, but looks like I missed a spot. How careless of me.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Newcastle：</span><br>
Oh my, it looks like I've said some extraneous things. In any case, Master, please continue to get along well with Sheffy~<br>
<br>
Newcastle grinned mischievously as she left the room. Just what part of this looks like "getting along?"<br>

...-ster... Master...<br>
...Looks like I have no choice.<br>
(Bang!)<br>
<br>
E-enemy attack?!!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Sheffield：</span><br>
Good morning, Master.<br>
When I opened my eyes, I could see Sheffield's cold expression in front of me, her gun still smoking. So that was the sound...<br>
<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项1："Sheffield, what are you doing here?"</span>'''''<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Sheffield：</span><br>
Are you sleeptalking? Did we not agree that from now on, I will be cleaning your room?<br>
<br>
Wait, when...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Sheffield：</span><br>
Commander, I figured that your room was as sloppy and disorganised as you are. Therefore, I will need to clean it.<br>
<br>
Come to think of it, I did ask her to help me clean...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Sheffield：</span><br>
What a helpless Master.<br>
I also took the liberty of making breakfast. It's not as good as what Belfast makes, but for the likes of you, surely it is more than sufficient.<br>
<br>
So that explains the pleasant smell from earlier...<br>
Even though she said all that stuff, the food was still delicious.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Sheffield：</span><br>
Master, after finishing your meal, please leave everything where it is so I can clean it up. If you tried to move it, you'd only make a bigger mess.<br>
<br>
She only shot me a glance from across the living room<br>
Well, I have to admit, this place looks brand new.<br>
<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项1："Thank you, Sheffield."</span>'''''<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Sheffield：</span><br>
I'm just doing my job as a maid. Furthermore...<br>
Since we are spending quite a bit of time together, Master, you should also call me "Sheffy" for the sake of convenience. Saves a syllable.<br>

Chapter 6 - A Maid's Feelings (Part 1)<br>
Port - Commander's personal quarters<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Sheffield：</span><br>
Good morning, Master. Breakfast is ready, so please get rinsed. I mean, washed.<br>
<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项1：Greet her energetically</span>'''''<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Sheffield：</span><br>
Please don't greet me as if you're one of those Destroyer girls. Surely you did not miss me that much.<br>
<br>
But I did! Since you've been helping me around the house so much, I look forward to seeing you even on the weekends.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Sheffield：</span><br>
...I never thought that I was catering to such a depraved Master. How careless of me...<br>
Perhaps I should not pamper you anymore, so please clean up the table after breakfast by yourself.<br>
Surely you do not mean to tell me that you want to become a piece of bloated driftwood who expects to be cleaned up after by maids?<br>
<br>
"I just want to be able to stay with you like this."<br>
Days later, Port - Commander's personal quarters<br>
I found myself awake earlier than usual. What's the time...? Seems like I can afford to go back to sleep...<br>
I could hazily hear a conversation occuring in the hallway outside my room...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Newcastle：</span><br>
...Are you really fine with this?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Sheffield：</span><br>
This is how a maid should conduct herself. After all, I'm not as greedy as Belfast.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Newcastle：</span><br>
But Sheffy, deep down, you know you want this. And your heart isn't going to let you give up so easily...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Sheffield：</span><br>
I...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Newcastle：</span><br>
Even if you want to pursue stability in your life, I still feel that you should pursue a stability that still allows you to be true to yourself.<br>
<br>
I seemed to have overheard quite a difficult conversation.<br>

Chapter 7 - A Maid's Feelings (Part 2)<br>
Port - Bedroom<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Sheffield：</span><br>
Good morning, Commander. For you to be awake at this time... should I actually be saying "good night?"<br>
<br>
Not quite, but it is true that I haven't been able to get back to sleep...<br>
Sheffield, I was thinking of giving you a leave.<br>
<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项1：Tell her that she can go home today</span>'''''<br>
<br>
For some reason, Sheffield's normally fluid, adroit movements suddenly ground to a halt.<br>
Looking back at it, I realized how much I've been imposing on you unwittingly, never even paying attention to what you really wanted to do, so...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Sheffield：</span><br>
Master...<br>
Sheffield suddenly drew close and put her hand on my forehead.<br>
You don't seem to have a fever... did you perhaps hit your head?<br>
I don't think I've ever been tended to more rudely.<br>
<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项1：Explain the reason to her</span>'''''<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Sheffield：</span><br>
So, that's what happened. You heard the conversation I had with Newcastle...<br>
Good grief, as expected of you, Master. Jumping to conclusions without hearing the whole story.<br>
<br>
Sheffield let out a long sigh.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Sheffield：</span><br>
The discussion we were having just now, was actually about romance.<br>
<br>
R-romance?!!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Sheffield：</span><br>
Newcastle told me that since I love you, I should be brave and tell you directly.<br>
I thought that it would be fine to just stay by your side like this, but if Master decides to develop strange misconceptions, I have no choice but to be clear.<br>
<br>
Sheffield looked straight at me.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Sheffield：</span><br>
Master, are you troubled by the way I talk and act toward you? If so, you must understand that is the way I express my love.<br>
Master, for me, being able to serve you forever is my one true wish, my happiness.<br>
Master, I love you. So very much.<br>
<br>
Even her confession was true to herself.<br>
Though our journey together was full of detours, I knew just how I wanted to respond to her feelings<br>
