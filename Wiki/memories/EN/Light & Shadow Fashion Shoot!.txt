<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Alfredo Oriani：</span><br>
Alabama, turn just a little more outward for me... Yeah, that's it!<br>
Ready, Takao? Then let's see your most confident, stylish look!<br>
Ooh... Looking good! This will do great!<br>
Everyone, your attention, please! The photoshoot for the Commander's exclusive and private fashion mag has officially started!<br>
Niiice! Great poses all around, folks.<br>
<br>
I step into the photo studio, where I catch sight of Alfredo hurriedly issuing commands while rapidly changing camera angles.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Alfredo Oriani：</span><br>
Hmm... Something's missing. I dunno what, considering every minute detail should be perfect...<br>
<br>
Chien Wu, standing beside her, furrows her brow with contemplation.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Chien Wu：</span><br>
Have a look over there. That's the missing element.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Not interrupting your photoshoot, am I?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Alfredo Oriani：</span><br>
Oh! Commander! Amazing timing! Have a look-see at the pics I took!<br>
Being the port's top journalist, I have no doubt in my ability to take incredible photos... Still, something feels off about 'em.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Chien Wu：</span><br>
Yes. It's unlikely that the composition or poses are the issue...<br>
What do you think it could be, Commander?<br>
<br>
Alfredo hands me her camera, so I look at her pictures. The models look fantastic under the lights, and each one is brimming with natural and distinctive grace.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Alabama：</span><br>
Oh... Commander. I think I've figured it out.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Takao：</span><br>
Of what do you speak?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Alabama：</span><br>
Since this is goin' into a private mag, shouldn't we show what's beneath, too?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Alfredo Oriani：</span><br>
Hot diggety! That's it! When you're too focused on the looks, it's easy to miss what you were supposed to capture in the first place!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Takao：</span><br>
By "what's beneath," surely you don't mean to suggest...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Alabama：</span><br>
Need a hand?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Takao：</span><br>
Ah!<br>
<br>
Takao softly bites her lip. Bracing herself, she grabs the rim of her shirt and quickly lifts it up.<br>
Impressed by her swiftness, I press the camera shutter and snap a picture.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Alfredo Oriani：</span><br>
Nice one!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Takao：</span><br>
C-Commander?! I did not expect you to photograph me... Heavens above, I am embarrassed...<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Don't say that. You look great.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Alfredo Oriani：</span><br>
Let's hear it from the designer herself! Would you agree that the Commander's photo is perfect?<br>
<br>
Chien Wu casts her gaze on the picture. Her lips curve into a knowing smile.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Chien Wu：</span><br>
This should easily be the magazine's cover image.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Alfredo Oriani：</span><br>
Heheh! I think we all agree this is what we were looking for!<br>
You must've been a photographer in your past life, Commander! You captured the perfect moment.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
I just took the picture when I felt it was right.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Alfredo Oriani：</span><br>
No need to be so humble! It takes a keen sense to get the absolute perfect timing.<br>
Heck, you should be the one holding the camera! The rest of the photoshoot is yours!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Chien Wu：</span><br>
Not a bad idea. I'll prepare all the outfits in advance, and... Wait, are you sure you're up for this, Commander?<br>
On one hand, it's more meaningful for you to take the photos yourself, since this magazine is meant just for you. On the other hand...<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Don't sweat it – I'm happy to help. Just wondering, though, why'd you decide on this particular theme?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Chien Wu：</span><br>
Well, a certain someone has been selling this type of fashion lately, and I got my hands on an order form with some reference pictures.<br>
To be blunt, none of the designs I saw could be considered passable.<br>
So, as a designer, I felt it necessary to let my own work speak for itself, and also to present you with some actually worthy outfits.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Interesting...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Alfredo Oriani：</span><br>
Right, then! Let's take some more pics, Commander!<br>
I just know you'll have no problem bringing out the best in all these models!<br>
<br>
Meanwhile, unbeknownst to everyone there, the infamous green cat was eavesdropping on the conversation through a gap in the photo studio door.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Akashi：</span><br>
Nyahaha... This is going even better than I imagined, nya...<br>
This whole special magazine was just an excuse to pin down the Commander's tastes, and now the person in question is personally taking the photos, nya!<br>
Now they just have to place orders based on the special-edition designs, and then...<br>
I'm gonna be swimming in money, nya! Fortune, come to mama, nya!<br>

{{折叠面板|标题=The Truth I Offer to You|选项=2|主框=1|样式=primary|展开=是}}
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Francesco Caracciolo：</span><br>
...The waters of my mind are calming.<br>
So you really are here, Commander.<br>
You have my thanks for personally coming to my photo session.<br>
Francesco Caracciolo, sitting idly in front of the couch, slowly turns to face me. Her soft skin under the lamplight radiates a faint glow.<br>
I've heard that a picture lies bare one's true self...<br>
One thing I do wonder is how I reflect in the lens of your eye.<br>
However... This is my first time doing a photoshoot such as this.<br>
Can I ask of you to guide me through it?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">{playername}：</span><br>
Don't stress over it – you'll be fine. Let's start with a few test pictures, shall we?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Francesco Caracciolo：</span><br>
Of course... What should I do?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">{playername}：</span><br>
We could try a different pose. Just sit on the floor and lean against the couch... Yeah, that's it.<br>
Now tilt your head a little further to the left... Oh, that's too much. Go back a little.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Francesco Caracciolo：</span><br>
Is this... adequate?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">{playername}：</span><br>
Yeah. That's a great angle.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Francesco Caracciolo：</span><br>
Through the camera's viewfinder, I place Francesco in the center of the frame. Her taut clothes follow the contours of her body, outlining her soft curves.<br>
Ah... Having your gaze upon me... It makes my heart throb harder than I'd thought...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">{playername}：</span><br>
Try to relax. Imagine that it's a regular, quiet afternoon, and we're just having a chat as usual.<br>
Relax your muscles and try to find the most comfortable pose for you.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Francesco Caracciolo：</span><br>
Despite the jitter of hesitation in her eyes, she does as I ask and slowly stretches out her legs. The tips of her round toes gently touch me.<br>
As usual...<br>
May I... be open with you, Commander?<br>
I think I understand what you're saying.<br>
She gives me a knowing nod, and I raise my camera in readiness to capture her relaxed, natural self.<br>
Before I can do that, though, something happens that throws me for a loop.<br>
She slowly raises the hem of her sweater. Bit by bit, the soft fabric slips away from her waist, revealing her delicate skin.<br>
Commander... I wish for you to see it...<br>
My truer self...<br>
As the fabric rustles, she raises the hem again until eventually the cloth is all piled up on her chest.<br>
Although her cheeks are red, her gaze is unwavering as she stares right at me.<br>
Commander... Do you see my true feelings now?<br>
Snap goes the shutter. My fingers act on instinct and take the picture.<br>
Through this angle, through this pose...<br>
I wish to convey my feelings that words fail to.<br>
Are they reaching you, I wonder?<br>
If they do... then could you take some pictures closer up?<br>
Shall I... assume a more intimate pose?<br>
I want to leave a deeper imprint upon your heart.<br>
Before the curtain of night falls... allow me to offer you the pure, untainted truth.<br>

{{折叠面板|标题=A Heart-Throbbing Wager: Winner Takes All|选项=3|主框=1|样式=primary|展开=是}}
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Alberto di Giussano：</span><br>
Ooohohoho! You've finally come, dearest Commander!<br>
Your personal model has been waiting for you!<br>
Like a butterfly gracefully fluttering past, Alberto leads me into her own little world.<br>
Welcome to my studio! I took this dressing room and redecorated it a little. Heheh – it's quite marvelous, wouldn't you agree?<br>
I have a challenge worthy of an expert such as yourself – can you capture the endless possibilities within this limited space and lighting?<br>
Naturally, a fantastic reward awaits you, should you accept this challenge.<br>
Now, kindly direct your attention to these! My secret weapons, carefully chosen to stir a throbbing in your heart!<br>
She points at a collection of various garments neatly hung on the clothes rack.<br>
Their delicate lacing outlines their refined silhouettes, and their see-through chiffons offer a suitable amount of glamour.<br>
Today, I shall don an outfit so alluring that you'll be unable to take your eyes off me, and you shall photograph me!<br>
Ah, but before we do that, may I propose a little wager between us?<br>
The wager is this: I bet that I will make your heart throb today!<br>
If I win, you must follow me anywhere I go tomorrow as my personal attendant.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">{playername}：</span><br>
And if I win?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Alberto di Giussano：</span><br>
In that event... Yours truly, graceful and charming, shall accompany you through a perfect day by anyone's metric!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">{playername}：</span><br>
Isn't that basically the same thing?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Alberto di Giussano：</span><br>
No, not at all! There is a world of difference between leading and following! The loser is obliged to politely fulfill all the wishes of the winner, you see.<br>
She twirls on her toes, picks out two pieces of clothing, and holds them up to her chest, looking at me with an impish glint.<br>
Pray tell, what do you think of these two? The blue makes my skin look brighter and further highlights my grace, doesn't it?<br>
Or perhaps your heart sings more at the sight of the purple one?<br>
Heehee... You're already picturing how I'd look in each, aren't you?<br>
The choice is yours, dearest Commander. Which one do you most wish to see me wear?<br>
She stares at me with a broad smile. A smile more full of light and love than even she herself realizes.<br>
Subconsciously, I raise my camera to capture her – and this heart-throbbing moment – through the lens.<br>
CLICK!<br>
Pardon? Are we photographing already? You haven't even given me an answer yet!<br>
<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项1：(Both.)</span>'''''<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项2：(Her smile is better.)</span>'''''<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">{playername}：</span><br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项1）</span>'''''They both look wonderful. I can't pick one over the other.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">{playername}：</span><br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项2）</span>'''''As wonderful as they both are, the thing I love the most is your smile.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Alberto di Giussano：</span><br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项2）</span>'''''M-my smile? Oh...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Alberto di Giussano：</span><br>
You silly goose, you! I suppose I'll forgive your surprise picture in light of that.<br>
However, your heart just throbbed a little, did it not? It must have!<br>
Ooohohoho! In other words, I am the winner of this wager!<br>
For the entirety of tomorrow, you are to obey my every command!<br>
Heheh... Would you mind assisting me with tidying up this photography equipment? Kindly think of it as practice for tomorrow!<br>
Or... perhaps you'd rather make a wager to see who can tidy up first?<br>
She walks up to me and whispers in an enchanting tone.<br>
Let's say the winner gets to tell the loser to do any one thing they wish for. Yes, I mean ANYTHING. How's that, hmm?<br>

{{折叠面板|标题=A Lovely Sur-Prize|选项=4|主框=1|样式=primary|展开=是}}
<br>
I arrive at the set prepared for Ugolino. It's a room that has been decorated warmly.<br>
At the center of it, several eye-catching claw machines have been set up, each one filled with various stuffed animals.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ugolino Vivaldi：</span><br>
Ugolino stands in front of one of them, her hands gently placed on the glass as she stares intently inside.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">{playername}：</span><br>
Which one do you want? I'll get it for you.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ugolino Vivaldi：</span><br>
Eep! C-Commander...<br>
No, I couldn't ask you to... I just kind of... Um... Sh-should we start the photo session?<br>
Although she brushes off my offer, I can see her eyes are fixated on a pink stuffed rabbit.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">{playername}：</span><br>
It's no biggie. Besides, I wanna test if I've got the skill to get one.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ugolino Vivaldi：</span><br>
Well, in that case... Please try to be careful. This machine doesn't look too healthy.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">{playername}：</span><br>
Guessing you mean it's prone to breaking. Don't worry, I'll be gentle.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ugolino Vivaldi：</span><br>
I insert a coin, operate the control stick, and then push the button. The claw descends right on target, firmly grasping the pink bunny... only to drop it as it rises back up.<br>
Aww! So close!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">{playername}：</span><br>
It's not over yet. One more try.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ugolino Vivaldi：</span><br>
A second attempt, a third attempt... a tenth attempt – every time, it drops it right at the last moment.<br>
Ugolino's expression gradually turns more and more dour, with little wrinkles forming on her brow.<br>
Commander, I'm convinced that the claw is sick. Allow me to examine it.<br>
She takes out her stethoscope, skillfully opens the machine's unlocked door, and carefully slips into the pile of stuffed animals.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">{playername}：</span><br>
You could just... do that?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ugolino Vivaldi：</span><br>
It's an examination, I assure you! Hmm... Yes, it really does seem to be sick. I need to treat it at once.<br>
Let's see... There's an issue with the arm's joint. That must be why it couldn't get a good grip on the cute little bunny.<br>
There, all better now!<br>
Commander, can you give it another try?<br>
I press the button again. The claw slowly descends again and grasps not a stuffed animal, but Ugolino's left hand.<br>
Huh? Wh-why did it grab me?<br>
Gently, the claw rises, carrying her wrist with it.<br>
Unlike last time, however, the claw refuses to let go.<br>
C-Commander, what's going on?<br>
Are you saying that... it was actually me you wanted to get?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">{playername}：</span><br>
Yeah. Looks like your treatment worked like a charm.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ugolino Vivaldi：</span><br>
It's a spectacular sight – as the claw holds her wrist in the air, she has a look of confusion in her eyes, and her cheeks are faintly flushed.<br>
I raise my camera and press the shutter before she has time to process anything.<br>
This isn't a great time for pictures, Commander!<br>
Immediately after the click of the shutter, the claw loosens its grip and lets go of her.<br>
Before I even look at the photo, I rush over to her. As she falls into my arms, she looks up at the swaying claw in a puzzled manner.<br>
Um, thank you?<br>
It felt kind of like... you captured me just now, and...<br>
It did spook me a little on one hand, but on the other...<br>
It also made me vaguely happy. Heehee.<br>
In truth, I've always wanted that... For you to "catch" me.<br>
I want to mean something special to you... To be that unique person in your camera lens.<br>
If I ever do become that... my heart will be filled with joy♪<br>

<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Takao：</span><br>
Takao strikes a pose in front of a plain background in the photo studio.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">{playername}：</span><br>
Ready to get started?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Takao：</span><br>
Understood. I am ready.<br>
As soon as I raise the camera and turn the lights on, she gets straight into character.<br>
With each snap of the shutter, she deftly changes poses. In one moment, she crosses her arms; in the next, she faces away with a defiant turn of the neck. However...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">{playername}：</span><br>
Takao, stop for a moment.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Takao：</span><br>
Commander? Are my poses lacking?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">{playername}：</span><br>
You're doing great, but I feel like you're pushing yourself.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Takao：</span><br>
...So you realized. I sprained my ankle during this morning's practice, but it shouldn't affect the photo shoot...<br>
Let's continue. My training is not over yet.<br>
...You think maintaining my health is part of training? Hmm. There is some logic to that...<br>
Takao hesitates for a moment, but then she sits down.<br>
If you don't mind... Commander, would you please check on my ankle?<br>
Ah! Commander, your fingers...<br>
I-it's nothing. It just... feels odd... being touched through my tights as such.<br>
Hyah! N-not there... Nkh...<br>
I-I'm sorry for yelping all of a sudden! An obvious issue of self-control...<br>
All you're doing is massaging me, but for some reason... my breath is suddenly ragged...<br>
Ah... Y-you're rubbing my foot so forcefully...<br>
It's tingling... all the way up my calves... I-I've never experienced such training...<br>
.........<br>
Ah! I-I'm sorry, Commander! My ineptitude has troubled you far too much!<br>
But I do feel much better now...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">{playername}：</span><br>
Wanna rest a little longer?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Takao：</span><br>
D-do not worry for me. I can continue the shoot now.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">{playername}：</span><br>
No. Rest a little longer. I just had a great idea.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Takao：</span><br>
She happens to be sitting right in front of the snow-white background. There's an unusually soft look on her flushed face.<br>
*snap!*<br>
Commander! You didn't tell me how to pose...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">{playername}：</span><br>
It's okay. I wanted to capture your real charms.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Takao：</span><br>
I turn the camera toward Takao, showing her natural and gentle expression.<br>
Is this... how I look when I'm relaxed?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">{playername}：</span><br>
That's enough training for today. When you get home, take a well-earned break.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Takao：</span><br>
Yes, Commander. Say...<br>
If it's no trouble... would you help me train tomorrow, too?<br>

<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Alabama：</span><br>
When I go into Alabama's studio, I find her carefully adjusting the lights.<br>
Hmm... Maybe a little closer to the camera would make it feel softer...<br>
She takes a step back. When her back bumps into me, she suddenly stops.<br>
Commander?<br>
Great timing. Can you help me check the lighting?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">{playername}：</span><br>
It looks great to me. A little more soft lighting on the right, and I think it would be perfect.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Alabama：</span><br>
Gotcha.<br>
She nods. Then, for some reason, she hooks a finger around her stockings and begins pulling them down.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">{playername}：</span><br>
Why are you stripping now, exactly?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Alabama：</span><br>
I figure... these stockings aren't exactly the focus of this shoot... There.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">{playername}：</span><br>
Let's do one with them on first. They might help guide the eyes better.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Alabama：</span><br>
You think so?<br>
She tilts her head in thought.<br>
After pulling the half-removed stockings back up, she smooths out the wrinkles.<br>
So what you're saying is... guiding the viewer's eyes with them would help highlight the main attraction?<br>
Alabama turns slightly to let the light hit the patterns on the fabric.<br>
Mm... The light's nice and warm. Feels like my stockings could melt right off.<br>
Do you need me to slide closer so you can get a better look, Commander?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">{playername}：</span><br>
You're fine just as you are.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Alabama：</span><br>
She poses naturally under the soft light. With each move, I quietly click the shutter.<br>
Before long, the sun sets. Alabama stretches and lets out a sigh.<br>
Phew... It's hot in here. Lend me a hand, Commander?<br>
I put my hand on hers. With my support, she takes a step forward.<br>
The distance between us suddenly closes so much that I can feel her body heat.<br>
Commander... Is this angle better?<br>
Would I be out of focus? Okay... How about this?<br>
Before I can answer, she places the camera on the tripod, sets a timer, takes my hand, and guides me into the light.<br>
Stay still, Commander. Let's take one together.<br>
Following her lead, I place my hand on her waist.<br>
She lifts her leg slightly and peels her stockings down once more.<br>
It's a two-shot, so you and I are the focus now.<br>
No need to guide the viewer's eyes, no need for emphasis... Just you and me...<br>
With her stockings pulled past her knees, she leans into my arms.<br>
Mind taking them off for me, Commander?<br>
This photo's all about you and me, in each other's embrace...<br>

{{折叠面板|标题=One-on-One Lesson|选项=7|主框=1|样式=primary|展开=是}}
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Chien Wu：</span><br>
I arrive at Chien Wu's studio. The door is slightly ajar, giving me a glimpse of her hunched over her desk.<br>
Her pencil glides softly across paper, sketching out perfect curves.<br>
Come here instead of staring blankly at the door. I already know you're there.<br>
Did you bring the coffee I asked for? Oh... I suppose there are more important matters at hand.<br>
She stands up, seizes me by the wrist, and leads me under the soft overhead lighting of the studio.<br>
To design the perfect garment, I need timely and frank feedback.<br>
Behold my latest creation... I call it Shadow of Light Carved.<br>
She raises her hands, showing me the design of her perfectly form-fitting outfit.<br>
Pay extra attention to how the curves guide your eyes, highlighting the model's figure while preserving a sense of mystery.<br>
I'd like you to rate it on a scale from one to ten.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">{playername}：</span><br>
It's such an incredible design that I struggle to rate it. Can you show me more... details?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Chien Wu：</span><br>
Oh? Hehe... I see.<br>
No worries. Look all you want... At the design, or at me.<br>
Chien Wu twists to the side, stretching the fabric alongside her to outline her curves.<br>
Her lips curl into a meaningful smile.<br>
By the way, Commander, do you know the three most important elements of clothing design?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">{playername}：</span><br>
Form, color, and... material?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Chien Wu：</span><br>
Wrong. The correct answer would be model, model, and finally, model.<br>
She punctuates this incredible revelation with a slow sip of coffee.<br>
Truly great fashion is more than just decoration. It must awaken the wearer's unique temperament, charm, and at times... desire, as well.<br>
However, this all requires that it be worn by the perfect model.<br>
Do you understand what I mean?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">{playername}：</span><br>
What you're saying is, my rating should be influenced by your appearance?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Chien Wu：</span><br>
As a smug look creeps onto her face...<br>
*snap!*<br>
Well done. You now understand the true essence of design, Commander.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">{playername}：</span><br>
I hereby dub this photo "The Designer and the Three Elements."<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Chien Wu：</span><br>
Not bad. In return...<br>
Chien Wu takes a single step closer to me and gleefully observes my reaction.<br>
Now, I'd like you to observe this design from another angle.<br>
I need more comprehensive feedback, after all... Perhaps your thoughts on the fabric's texture, too?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">{playername}：</span><br>
Wait, you want me to touch you?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Chien Wu：</span><br>
Of course.<br>
As a photographer, your job is more than just to observe. You have to truly immerse yourself in your subject.<br>
Now, feel the texture of the fabric... Its elasticity... The heat beneath, as well.<br>
What's your score, Commander?<br>
There's no need to rush your conclusion. Take as much time as you need, and then give me your final answer.<br>

<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Admiral Nakhimov：</span><br>
Tripod stability and optical calibration confirmed. Equipment in optimal condition...<br>
All that's left is to verify that the shooting is done.<br>
But only the Commander can do that...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">{playername}：</span><br>
You called?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Admiral Nakhimov：</span><br>
Nakhimov's cables perk up. She spins around to face me, nearly dropping the tools in her hands.<br>
Oh... Commander.<br>
Shall we begin?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">{playername}：</span><br>
Yeah. Let's decide on a composition first.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Admiral Nakhimov：</span><br>
I was practicing some placements and poses based on my past photo shoot experience.<br>
She stands in front of the backdrop and clasps her hands in front of her, taking a rather stiff pose.<br>
I click the shutter. When the flash goes off, she flinches slightly.<br>
The flash... is a little bright.<br>
I'm fine, though. Continue.<br>
Mm... Sorry, my pose is off again...<br>
Ah. Did I blink? Okay... I'll try not to this time.<br>
Every time the flash goes off, Nakhimov squints and recoils away from it. It's getting difficult to make much headway.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">{playername}：</span><br>
How about a quick break?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Admiral Nakhimov：</span><br>
Is my performance not up to snuff? Or does the equipment need to be tuned?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">{playername}：</span><br>
You're doing fine, and the equipment is fine.<br>
I just want to help you in case you're nervous. Don't worry.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Admiral Nakhimov：</span><br>
I head over to the equipment rack and take out a photography guide.<br>
What is this?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">{playername}：</span><br>
The Thirty-Six Stratagems of Photography. Let's give it a try together.<br>
First, the cat... Er, the model should look slightly away from the camera, rather than directly into it.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Admiral Nakhimov：</span><br>
She nods and turns her head slightly to the side. However, her eyes remain fixed on me.<br>
Like this?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">{playername}：</span><br>
Next... Using a toy to attract the model's attention.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Admiral Nakhimov：</span><br>
A toy?<br>
I take a feather toy out and wave it around. Her eyes are naturally drawn to it.<br>
Commander... I feel weird...<br>
It's hard to focus... Mmm... Meooow...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">{playername}：</span><br>
Let's try this one, too: keeping the environment quiet and avoiding sudden noises.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Admiral Nakhimov：</span><br>
Okay... Quiet is more calming.<br>
Suddenly, the photo shoot proceeds as smoothly as butter. Nakhimov's expressions become more natural and relaxed, as well.<br>
When I click the shutter, I capture a perfect moment.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">{playername}：</span><br>
Nice. That'll do it.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Admiral Nakhimov：</span><br>
Are we done already?<br>
She gazes at me almost sadly. Her eyes then fall on the cover of the guidebook.<br>
Thirty-Six Stratagems of... Cat Photography?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">{playername}：</span><br>
Whoops. Yeah, you got me. It worked, though! Wanna see how the photos came out?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Admiral Nakhimov：</span><br>
I hand her the camera. Despite her embarrassment, she peeks at the screen.<br>
Oh... They do look good.<br>
Next time... A normal guide would be nice...<br>
Though... Since it's you... I guess I don't mind this special treatment.<br>

<br>
After finishing the morning's shoots, I go into the dressing room for a break.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Mogador：</span><br>
When I reach over to turn the light on, someone suddenly approaches me from behind and pushes me against the wall.<br>
Commandeeer... I finally found yooou...<br>
Mogador presses up against me, wearing nothing but a thin towel.<br>
You promised me... You're gonna take pictures of me today, aren't you?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">{playername}：</span><br>
Er, weren't our plans for this afternoon?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Mogador：</span><br>
I couldn't bear to wait like a good girl in the studio... All I could hear were machines being prepared for the shoot...<br>
Just imagining you taking pictures of me got me all hot and bothered... I couldn't stop myself from coming to see you.<br>
Plus...<br>
I know what a talented, brilliant photographer like you wants most of all...<br>
No pretense, no artificiality...<br>
Just the most authentic, most attractive moment...<br>
That's the Mogador you want to see, isn't it, Commander?<br>
Her hot breath pours over me as she presses herself even closer to me.<br>
Soft curves stand out beneath her towel, intertwining with her sweet scent and heat.<br>
Come on, Commander... Is your camera ready?<br>
I'm so hot, I can hardly take it anymore...<br>
Mid-sentence, she pinches her towel and slowly peels it away.<br>
Come ooon, Commander...<br>
Take me with that camera of yours... Make this moment yours, all yours...<br>
The white towel slips down the contours of her body. Just before it can reveal something truly intimate, it catches on her arm.<br>
Reflexively, I raise the camera and click the shutter.<br>
*snap!*<br>
The very instant that she reveals everything is burned into the screen of the camera.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">{playername}：</span><br>
Wait... A swimsuit?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Mogador：</span><br>
That's right! It's our private little gravure shoot... It's sweat-proof, too...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">{playername}：</span><br>
You really thought this through.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Mogador：</span><br>
Every moment and every angle...<br>
You really do understand me more than anybody else, Commander.<br>
Still... I feel so cramped in this swimsuit...<br>
And our photo shoot is over... Hehe, hehehe...<br>
Mogador reaches behind her back, fumbling for the hooks of her top in hopes of escaping this last restraint. However..<br>
Hmm? Something's stuck...<br>
Every failed attempt only makes her breathing more feverish.<br>
I can't get it off on my own, Commander...<br>
*pant*... *pant*... Sooo hot...<br>
Hehehe... I need your help. Please... Won't you help me?<br>
Yeah... Right there, right there...<br>

A few days later, Chien Wu hands me the completed photo collection.<br>
The coated paper beautifully displays everybody's pictures.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Chien Wu：</span><br>
Take a look, Commander. Every photo you took is documented in here.<br>
They run the gamut from complex elegance to perfect simplicity. Which one tugs at your heartstrings the most?<br>
<br>
As I flip through the pages, an answer forms in my mind.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
They're all wonderful, but I can't pick a single one. It's not the product, but every little moment that went into making them.<br>
Because there's beauty in the raw, genuine feelings behind each one.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Chien Wu：</span><br>
It's the resonance between designer and model that drives pure beauty.<br>
In short, instead of obsessing over the perfect design, it's better to find the best way to show off each combination.<br>
Hehe. Thanks to you, Commander, I've learned a valuable lesson today.<br>
<br>
Outside the window, the setting sun casts a veil of gold across the port.<br>
Thus ends my photographic journey for now, but Chien Wu's exploration of fashion design has only just begun.<br>
Meanwhile, in Akashi's warehouse...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Akashi：</span><br>
This can't be... I can't believe this is happening, nya!<br>
Why aren't they selling at all, nya?!<br>
It's supposed to be an untapped market, nya! I did so much research all over the port, and I promoted everybody's designs, nya...<br>
And the Commander even photographed them, nya!<br>
Why? Why haven't I sold a single outfit, nya?<br>
Could it be... that the demand just isn't there, nya?<br>
