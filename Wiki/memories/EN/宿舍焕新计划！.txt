Port - Office<br>
It's the early hours of the morning, and Akashi has told me she has something important to discuss.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Akashi：</span><br>
Good morning, nya. Good news, nya!<br>
I have a new proposal for you – the Dorm Extension Project, nya!<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
I see. Is this the "important" thing you had to discuss?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Akashi：</span><br>
Sure is, nya! The port has grown over the years, and we ought to build new homes to accommodate everyone, nya!<br>
Conveniently, there was a disused factory that Ingraham demolished a while ago, nya. That has cleared up plenty of space, nya.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Wait, you're going to construct new buildings? I thought this was limited in scope to a renovation.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Akashi：</span><br>
No, we're building from the ground up, nya. It's more profitable, nya.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
......<br>
(She's not even trying to hide her intentions.)<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Akashi：</span><br>
My vision is to create a place where shipgirls can be more comfortable than ever and enjoy the simple pleasures of everyday life, nya.<br>
Combat and work both take a toll, nya. With a place to better rest and recover, they'll perform better than ever before, nya!<br>
You have to agree it's a pretty good idea, nya.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Can't deny that. It'll help them work and fight with renewed vigor.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Akashi：</span><br>
Exactly, nya. That's why each home should also be decorated to suit the occupant, nya.<br>
Each room is going to be tailor-made according to the inhabitant's tastes, nya!<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
So basically, occupants can move in without packing their bags or anything.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Akashi：</span><br>
That's precisely what I'm thinking, nya.<br>
Oh, also – while this project is designed first and foremost for the shipgirls...<br>
We CAN also build a private space exclusively for you if you want, nya.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Hmm. I'll think about it.<br>
For now, proceed with just this plan. Incidentally, when will the construction start?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Akashi：</span><br>
It can start right away, nya! Although, there's a catch, nya.<br>
Given the port's resource stockpiles and technology, finishing the actual construction won't take very long...<br>
But, relocating everyone at once isn't feasible, nya.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
How come?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Akashi：</span><br>
Designing and furnishing a home takes time, nya. Everyone could move in at the same time if we were making cookie-cutter homes, nya.<br>
But we aren't, nya! I've already promised to provide every person with a unique residence, nya!<br>
So, the girls will just have to wait for their turn and move in one at a time, nya.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Not ideal, but I suppose that's how it is.<br>
Since we're doing it this way, it's important to decide who's moving in first. She'll provide valuable feedback on how it feels to live in this new dorm.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Akashi：</span><br>
I've already picked someone, nya! One of the Royal Maids, nya.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
(A Royal Maid? That's probably Belfast. She's the perfect candidate for a test run of the project.)<br>
<br>
The office door opens, and a familiar face walks in.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Sirius：</span><br>
Good afternoon, my honourable Master.<br>
As your humble servant, I am truly honoured to be the first resident of the new dormitory.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Akashi：</span><br>
There she is, nya. The blueprints for her personalized place are already done, so all you need to do is sign this, nya!<br>
<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项1：Well, since you've already made up your mind...</span>'''''<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项2：(Stop and think about it first.)</span>'''''<br>
<br>
After mulling it over for just a moment, I put my signature on the documents.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Sirius：</span><br>
I shall perform my duty with grace and live up to your expectations, my honourable Master!<br>
<br>
One month later, in the office...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Akashi：</span><br>
Commander, nya! The construction on the dorm extension is done and Sirius' room has been furnished, nya!<br>
Naturally, the homes are all built with safe materials with no trace of formaldehyde or other harmful substances, nya. It's all up to standards, nya!<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
I... see... Hey, where's Sirius?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Akashi：</span><br>
In her new home, waiting for you, nya! Go and speak to her, nya!<br>
