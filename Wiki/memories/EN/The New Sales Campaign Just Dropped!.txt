Wait a second. Is today...<br>

That's right, nya! It's that time of year again, nya!<br>
Commander, get a load of my promo video, nya!<br>

Um...?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Akashi：</span><br>
Nya...? I-I mixed up the files, nya!<br>
<br>
[Overhead view of city. Music dramatically surges]<br>
[Swap cameras to introduce actors]<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Chkalov：</span><br>
Urgh, my head is spinning... I might've had a little too much to drink.<br>
Good thing we're dubbing over it in post. If I can just lip sync my lines right, I'm good.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Admiral Nakhimov：</span><br>
Don't look at the camera, speak as naturally as possible...<br>
Ms. Chkalov, tell me again how you got those goodies for such a discount!<br>
Where in the world can I get an awesome deal like that?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Chkalov：</span><br>
These are all from Akashi's big promotional sale. The drinks are practically a steal... You should TOTALLY check them out!<br>
<br>
[Luxury car enters scene. Camera zooms]<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">New Jersey：</span><br>
Wooow, honey, look! I rule the road now!<br>
Just ignore the fact that it's closed for filming, so I'm the only person who gets to drive on it anyway!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Strasbourg：</span><br>
AHEM. New Jersey, your lines?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">New Jersey：</span><br>
Oh, riiight... Honey! I heard Akashi's holding another big Black Friday sale this year!<br>
Let's go check it out later!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Strasbourg：</span><br>
That was ad-libbed, wasn't it? You don't... actually think these are good deals, do you?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">New Jersey：</span><br>
Huh? You don't think so?!<br>
But she has daily giveaways!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Strasbourg：</span><br>
I will admit, that is one tradition that I appreciate.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Akashi：</span><br>
You heard right, nya!<br>
This year, we're trimming all the fat and delivering all the savings straight to YOU yet again, nya!<br>
We've got returning outfits, limited-time special sets, and more, nya!<br>
See you on the day of the sale, nya!<br>
<br>
[Camera pans up to the blue sky. End]<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
.........<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Akashi：</span><br>

<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项1：It was... memorable, I'll give you that.</span>'''''<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项2：That was novel. Maybe not in a good way.</span>'''''<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Akashi：</span><br>
I'll go grab the right files right now, nya!<br>
Make sure you read the flyers again, nya! Or else you might miss the opportunity of a lifetime, nya!<br>
<br>
After leaving a bundle of flyers, she bolts out of my office like a flash of green lightning.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Turning my office into an ad space again, I see...<br>
Well, I guess it is a special occasion.<br>
After work, I'll go check it out.<br>
