1 The Application<br>
Ingraham stretches and lets out a yawn, getting ready to start the day's work.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ingraham：</span><br>
Why don't we do a little cleaning first?<br>
Let me take a quick look at today's itinerary. Other than the routine maintenance, we also have...<br>
Jeez, I'm practically backed up to the moon with requests... Looks like I'll have to figure something out.<br>
Maybe I can submit an application to the Commander for some extra supplies and equipment?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Cooper：</span><br>
Sup, Ingraham~!<br>
I decided to drop by because I was bored, but look at you with that stony expression on your face~<br>
Whatcha up to?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ingraham：</span><br>
Nothing major, just thinking about how to get some work done. Speaking of which, are you here to pick up that thing you asked me to repair for you last month?<br>
If so, I unfortunately have bad news for you. I still need, lemme think, another two months or so? That should do it.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Cooper：</span><br>
Nah, it's not that. I seriously just wanted to come say hi to you.<br>
Are you THAT swamped in work?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ingraham：</span><br>
As you can see, each and every day, there's always an endless stream of people asking me to fix this and that. Throw on the other work I have to take care of regularly, and I hardly have any spare time.<br>
I suppose I can push myself a bit harder over the holidays.<br>
But even so, the repairs still take a bit of time to get through, so of course I end up with a massive backlog.<br>
<br>
Ingraham throws open the door to the warehouse behind her, revealing a mountain of miscellaneous items that leaves Cooper awestruck.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Cooper：</span><br>
Holy crap... That's way too much stuff!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ingraham：</span><br>
Yeah, and that's after I already finished the last batch of repairs and sent them back...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Cooper：</span><br>
Oh, right! The Commander gave you permission to store your stuff in this warehouse, right? Why don't you apply for another storage place?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ingraham：</span><br>
Forget it. All that would do is double the backlog eventually.<br>
The real reason I have so much junk lying around is... there are too many parts I can't normally get my hands on.<br>
So, I make my own parts to make the repair process go more smoothly.<br>
But, making my own parts requires special equipment and facilities, and I have to submit applications to access them...<br>
Nowadays, I submit the applications in a big batch, but that's because it's not good to apply too often. The result... is this huge pile of stuff you see here.<br>
If only I could have a personal workshop...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Cooper：</span><br>
That's it!<br>
Instead of applying to use the devices one at a time, you should solve the problem at its root!<br>
Ask the Commander to set up a personal workshop for you! That way, you'd have your own set of equipment to work with!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ingraham：</span><br>
...Do you have any idea how ridiculously expensive the equipment is?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Cooper：</span><br>
The Commander is super nice, so I'm sure you have nothing to worry about!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ingraham：</span><br>
...A bit too nice, if you ask me.<br>
If I only ask for some of the smaller devices, there might be some hope...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Cooper：</span><br>
Then without further ado, let's get that application ready!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ingraham：</span><br>
Hmm... Give me a bit to think about what I'll need.<br>

2 The Request<br>
*knock* *knock*<br>
<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项1："Come in."</span>'''''<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ingraham：</span><br>
Pardon me, Commander.<br>
Did you need something from me?<br>
<br>
"I want to talk about the personal studio request you submitted earlier."<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ingraham：</span><br>
*sigh*... I knew it was a long shot to begin with...<br>
<br>
Ingraham's head droops in disappointment as she sees the application form I placed on the desk in front of her.<br>
But, she soon realizes that the form had not been stamped at all – it wasn't approved, but it wasn't denied either.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ingraham：</span><br>
Commander, what does this mean...?<br>
<br>
"I wanted to speak with you one-on-one before making a formal response."<br>
"Why are you submitting the application right now? Is there something you're having trouble with?"<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ingraham：</span><br>
Actually, about that...<br>
<br>
"I see. I think I understand your situation now."<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ingraham：</span><br>
Does that mean... you'll approve my application?<br>
<br>
"Before I make a decision, I need to ask you something first."<br>
"What does it mean to you when you help fix stuff for your friends around the port?"<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ingraham：</span><br>
Umm... What does it mean to me?<br>
I'm not sure. I just want to get things fixed up ASAP so I can move on to fixing the next thing.<br>
<br>
"What do you think about the way people react after you finish repairing things for them?"<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ingraham：</span><br>
Well, I normally notify people as soon as I finish the repairs.<br>
As for their reactions... That's not something I usually pay attention to.<br>
<br>
"I see. I'll have to give your application some thought then."<br>
"While I'm doing that, there's a set of recently-retired equipment in the warehouse. How about you use those to take care of your problems in the short term?"<br>
"You can use the abandoned storeroom near the warehouse if you'd like."<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ingraham：</span><br>
I'll do just that! Thank you so much, Commander!<br>

3 The Workshop<br>
Ingraham and Cooper are struggling to tidy up the abandoned storeroom to move the old equipment into.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Cooper：</span><br>
Phew... We've finally... cleared up enough space... to move the equipment in!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ingraham：</span><br>
Thanks a ton, Cooper... I couldn't have done it... without you...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Cooper：</span><br>
Think nothing of it, buddy! That's what we have hands for~! Since you're always helping me out, it's only natural that I return the favor!<br>
Having that said, why didn't you ask Bristol to come over as well?<br>
We could've tidied up much faster with an extra helper here.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ingraham：</span><br>
Mm. In theory, that's true.<br>
But just think about it: an abandoned warehouse, old dust-buried wares, and Bristol. If anything, our efficiency would decrease.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Cooper：</span><br>
Ahaha... I guess you're right. Maybe we can let her "adventure" in here after we're done cleaning up.<br>
<br>
As the sky gradually begins to darken, Ingraham looks around the old storeroom that's been converted into a simple workshop, and nods with satisfaction.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ingraham：</span><br>
Now, I can finally get some serious work done...<br>
In any case, let's pick up on that half-finished project I was working on before...<br>
<br>
Ingraham stares contemplatively at the strangely-shaped shield on her workbench.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ingraham：</span><br>
Reno's mechanical shield, huh...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Reno：</span><br>
...I'm telling you, it doesn't make any sense why these aren't installed with the same functionalities they have in those movies!<br>
They're supposed to be able to transform and bounce around, but these can't do anything like that at all! Such a disappointment!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ingraham：</span><br>
So in other words... you want a vibranium shield?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Reno：</span><br>
That's right! Take a look over here – in the movies, this bit is supposed to automatically transform. But, I have to do it myself with this version!<br>
And when I put some strength into it... it snaps right off.<br>
If you're not too busy, would you mind fixing it for me?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ingraham：</span><br>
Sure. I'll take a look at it.<br>
Hmm... An auto-transform function?<br>
Well, I have to take it apart anyway to repair it. Wouldn't be much extra work to add in a power system. In this case...<br>
<br>
Ingraham doodles a few diagrams on her workbench, puts on her goggles, and starts "repairing" the shield.<br>

4 The Surprise<br>
A few days later – Ingraham's makeshift workshop<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ingraham：</span><br>
That's one job taken care of. Now onto the next thing...<br>
Umm... What does it mean to me?<br>
I'm not sure. I just want to get things fixed up ASAP so I can move on to fixing the next thing.<br>
<br>
"What do you think about the way people react after you finish repairing things for them?"<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ingraham：</span><br>
Well, I normally notify people as soon as I finish the repairs.<br>
As for their reactions... That's not something I usually pay attention to.<br>
...Maybe I'll deliver it myself this time and see how she reacts?<br>
<br>
The reassembled shield is casually lying on the workbench, along with a few other completed objects.<br>
Ingraham scoops them up quietly, and turns to leave the workshop.<br>
*knock* *knock*<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Reno：</span><br>
Coming~!<br>
Hm? Ingraham, is that you? Wait a sec, is that...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ingraham：</span><br>
Mhm. Sorry it took so long. I've finished repairing your shield.<br>
Want me to help you put it on?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Reno：</span><br>
If you don't mind, yes please!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ingraham：</span><br>
You just need to buckle it on like this, and then... Try waving your arm around a bit to see if it wobbles.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Reno：</span><br>
It feels perfect; no problems at all! Thank you so much!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ingraham：</span><br>
Piece of cake. Oh, and there's one more thing I need to tell you.<br>
Do you feel that little bump right by your little finger? Go ahead and press it.<br>
<br>
ZAM!<br>
The shield suddenly doubles in size, accompanied by the slick sound of metal rubbing together.<br>
It all happens in a flash, before Reno can process what even happened.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ingraham：</span><br>
...That seems good enough.<br>
By the way, because the original shield used metals that were too unwieldy, I remade the frame using carbon fibers.<br>
The metallic sound is just a sound effect. If you find it too jarring, you can hit this switch to disable the speaker.<br>
In addition to the automatic expansion function I added, you can also retract it using this switch by your index finger.<br>
Hold it down for three seconds, and it'll retract automatically.<br>
Reno...? Are you listening?<br>
Reno?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Reno：</span><br>
You made the automatic transformation... a real thing?<br>
Sorry, sorry, this is just... too much for me to take in all at once!<br>
Is that seriously the same toy shield I gave you earlier? You didn't jump into some futuristic dimension to buy a real one for me, did you?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ingraham：</span><br>
...I didn't do anything except add a few simple modifications. I'm glad you like it though.<br>
<br>
Unfortunately, Reno doesn't seem to be paying attention to any of Ingraham's words.<br>
The "vibranium shield" has her mesmerized as though she's holding a magic treasure, unable to put it down for even a second.<br>
Ingraham simply watches her from nearby, noticing a strange glimmer shining in Reno's eyes.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ingraham：</span><br>
(So this is how people react after getting their stuff back...)<br>
(Is this what the Commander wanted me to see?)<br>
......<br>
<br>
A strong drive inexplicably arises within Ingraham's heart.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ingraham：</span><br>
(Since I already have the equipment I need, I guess I should knock out everything on the backlog.)<br>
<br>
After waving goodbye to Reno, Ingraham trots back to her makeshift workshop.<br>
The lights in the workshop do not go out until late, late into the night.<br>

5 The Cost of Efficiency<br>
About a week later...<br>
In a breathtaking display of tenacity, Ingraham knocked out about a quarter of the projects in her backlog.<br>
She personally returned each and every item to its respective owner.<br>
After all that, she finally earned herself a well-deserved break.<br>
The workbench that had been in use constantly over the last week suddenly falls silent, Ingraham accidentally slipping off into slumber right in front of it.<br>
An uncertain amount of time later, she feels someone prodding at her cheek.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Cooper：</span><br>
Woah, I didn't think I'd wake actually wake you up. Sorry.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ingraham：</span><br>
...Oh, it's just you, Cooper. Did you need something from me?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Cooper：</span><br>
I wouldn't say "need," but do you still remember that transforming device I asked you to make before?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ingraham：</span><br>
Of course. Didn't I fix it up and hand it back to you? Don't tell me you went and broke it again...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Cooper：</span><br>
Not this time! It's about something else...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ingraham：</span><br>
Well? Tell me. It's not like you to beat around the bush like this.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Cooper：</span><br>
I'm not sure how to tell you this, and I don't want you to take it the wrong way...<br>
<br>
Cooper takes a deep breath.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Cooper：</span><br>
Ingraham, why do you think everyone keeps asking you to fix or modify their knick-knacks?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ingraham：</span><br>
Because I happen to have the know-how?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Cooper：</span><br>
That is one reason, but I think there's more to it than that.<br>
Take my transforming device as an example. The truth is, Akashi is just as capable of doing that job.<br>
But if I had her do it, she would've returned the same thing to me, exactly as I found it.<br>
The whole "element of surprise" would be missing.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ingraham：</span><br>
...The element of surprise?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Cooper：</span><br>
Yeah... Y'know, like that vibranium shield you did for Reno? That's the element of surprise I'm talking about. Stuff you'd never get asking anyone other than you.<br>
That's why everyone comes to you to get their stuff fixed, no matter how long it takes!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ingraham：</span><br>
I see... And another way of saying that is, you're not satisfied with what I pump out doing these rush jobs?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Cooper：</span><br>
No, no, that's not what I'm saying at all! See, that's why I said I didn't want you to take it the wrong way!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ingraham：</span><br>
It's fine. I'm not offended.<br>
After throwing myself at these projects for the entire last week, the way I approach my work mentally has shifted a bit as well.<br>
The excitement that I used to feel towards turning the ideas in my head into reality has slowly been disappearing.<br>
Instead, when I think about the mountain of work I still have to get through, I feel pressured to work faster and faster. I'd say it's even starting to turn into irritation.<br>
The more I want to see that glow in their eyes, the harder it is to see it.<br>
It almost feels like... I've been traveling for so long I forgot why I left home in the first place...<br>
<br>
Ingraham wearily rubs her eyebrows.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Cooper：</span><br>
Do you remember when I helped you make the transforming device?<br>
We talked a whole lot, didn't we? Although, I was doing most of the talking...<br>
I remember really clearly – no matter how much you complained, every little detail was done perfectly by the time the project was finished.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ingraham：</span><br>
Mm... I even went to see that movie to get a reference for what you wanted me to make.<br>
(But after I started getting fixated on efficiency, I stopped doing stuff like that...)<br>
(I'm starting to understand now... This is what the Commander really meant with that question.)<br>
(And it's also why my application couldn't be approved right away...)<br>
<br>
Ingraham's cheeks flare up in embarrassment as she realizes that she's been read like a book without even being aware of it herself.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ingraham：</span><br>
Umm... In any case, I'll have to send out a post-delivery survey, and make new plans to fix things people might be dissatisfied with!<br>
Cooper, come help me out too!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Cooper：</span><br>
Heheh, as you wish~<br>

6 That Glimmer In Their Eyes<br>
*knock* *knock*<br>
There's no answer from the other side of the door.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ingraham：</span><br>
(I know it's already nighttime, but isn't it too early for her to be asleep?)<br>
<br>
*knock* *knock*<br>
After a long while, the door cracks open.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Bristol：</span><br>
Oh, Ingraham... Good evening...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ingraham：</span><br>
Bristol, I've brought your lantern.<br>
You mentioned something about the circuitry being a bit shaky before, right? So, I took a look at that for you and made some upgrades.<br>
Want to give it a try?<br>
<br>
Ingraham poses this question softly, with a hint of hesitation in her voice.<br>
After all, this lantern is the first project she completed since her talk with Cooper a while ago.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Bristol：</span><br>
Woah! It's as good as new now! You're amazing!<br>
<br>
Bristol takes the lantern from Ingraham's hands and gives it a good shake before flipping the switch on.<br>
The mote of light inside the glass cage dances rhythmically, as if living and breathing.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Bristol：</span><br>
Woah... what's going on with this light? What'd you do to it?<br>
I'll say it again: you're way too amazing! With this, the legendary investigator is back in action!<br>
<br>
Bristol runs around her room in circles, like a child with a new toy.<br>
There is that unmistakable glimmer of wonder in her eyes once more, a fact that does not escape Ingraham's notice.<br>
That glimmer may well have existed in Ingraham's eyes at one point.<br>
After each obstacle she overcame, after each flash of brilliance in her designs.<br>
She falls into deep contemplation.<br>
Why would she overlook something this important? How could she forget that the most important thing when it came to her repair work was not efficiency, but that extra touch of attentiveness?<br>
Had she not been so attentive to Reno's wants, that vibranium shield would not have had an auto-transform feature. It would've just been a regular old toy shield.<br>
Bristol's lantern would not have been able to shine with such an enchanting, beautiful light.<br>
And no amount of expensive machinery or equipment could have produced these things.<br>
She continues to look at Bristol, her lips finally curling into a gentle smile.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ingraham：</span><br>
(Maybe this is why everyone keeps coming to me for help?)<br>
(Maybe repairs and maintenance aren't just about fixing up an object, but more like undoing and smoothing over the scars left by time.)<br>
(And now that I think about it, nobody ever really complained about my work taking a long time.)<br>
(Seriously, what was I doing...?)<br>
......<br>
<br>
After saying goodbye to Bristol, Ingraham suddenly has another flash of inspiration.<br>
Her steps become faster and faster until she breaks out into a run, heading back towards her workshop.<br>
If she starts now, it might not be too late...<br>

Days later, at the Office...<br>
*knock* *knock*<br>
<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项1："Come in."</span>'''''<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ingraham：</span><br>
Hey, Commander.<br>
<br>
"Ah, Ingraham. Perfect – I was just about to call for you."<br>
"As you can see, I've finalized the documents to get you the equipment you asked for."<br>
"Said equipment will probably arrive within a week."<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ingraham：</span><br>
Um, Commander...<br>
<br>
"In any case, why don't you hold on to the paperwork?"<br>
Ingraham pauses for a moment before taking the documents from me.<br>
"So, did the increase in efficiency fix your problems?"<br>
She hastily shifts her eyes to the side.<br>
I can tell that she realized I was testing her all along.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ingraham：</span><br>
Actually, Commander, about the new equipment...<br>
<br>
"I went through all the trouble of getting it, so you might as well put it to good use."<br>
"Don't think of it as a way of increasing your efficiency – rather, think of it as a tool to let you better make use of your creativity."<br>
Ingraham doesn't argue back. She simply nods while holding on to the documents.<br>
"Great. That settles things for today then. Now if you'll excuse me, I'm heading out for a breath of fresh air."<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ingraham：</span><br>
...Wait, hold on a second, Commander!<br>
<br>
Just as I'm about to leave, Ingraham calls for my attention.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ingraham：</span><br>
Umm... Would you mind bending down real quick?<br>
Uhh... Just like that. Don't move, okay?<br>
<br>
Ingraham takes out a shiny medal from her pocket and pins it in front of my chest.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ingraham：</span><br>
There we go~<br>
D-don't worry, it's only silver-plated. It's been a while since I last made a medal for you, right?<br>
So, I figured it was time to make you another one.<br>
<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项1："Thank you, Ingraham."</span>'''''<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项2："You're the best."</span>'''''<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项3：Pat her head.</span>'''''<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ingraham：</span><br>
Hehe...<br>
<br>
"Oh, before I forget, mind if I come visit your workshop?"<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ingraham：</span><br>
Huh?! N-no, it's way too messy in there!<br>
B-besides, it's hardly worthy of being called a workshop! It's just a hodgepodge of junk at the moment!<br>
<br>
"But, the official equipment has already been approved, so it will be worthy of being called a workshop sooner or later, right?<br>
"And as an official facility, it deserves a name. Unless you have a better idea, I'm going to dub it 'Ingraham's Repair Workshop' or 'Ingraham's Fix-It-All Shop.' How does that sound?"<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ingraham：</span><br>
You don't need to stick my name onto it, seriously...<br>
<br>
"Really? I think it sounds cuter that way."<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ingraham：</span><br>
Commander!<br>
