<br>
1 Stolen Treasure<br>
Port - Park<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Fu Shun：</span><br>
Fei Yuen, Fu Po! Caught you! You're it now!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Fu Po：</span><br>
Shh! Pipe down!<br>
Forget about being it! Look over there!<br>
I think I've caught wind of some super-duper secret project!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Fu Shun：</span><br>
Wait, for real?!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Fei Yuen：</span><br>
Hide, quick! It's over if they see you!<br>
<br>
Fei Yuen and Fu Po pulled Fu Shun into the bushes and hid. They concentrated on the group of people walking in the distance.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Cleveland：</span><br>
Hmm... All our stuff is over at Chien Wu's place...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Formidable：</span><br>
Getting them took so much work...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">New Jersey：</span><br>
Well, whining about it won't help... Something so precious... Only she has that...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Formidable：</span><br>
It seems all we can do is wait for the show...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">New Jersey：</span><br>
Yeah, let's go back... Still so much to do...<br>
<br>
With long faces, they turned around and left the scene.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Fei Yuen：</span><br>
Ugh... Lady Yuen couldn't hear a word of what they said! Let's get closer!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Fu Po：</span><br>
No! Any closer and they'll see you! Their guard is up!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Fei Yuen：</span><br>
Fiiine... Did you see how they were sneaking around? That's suspicious! I bet they're hiding something!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Fu Shun：</span><br>
They said something about getting stuff, and it was all over at Chien Wu's place...<br>
They must've been talking about some kind of treasure...<br>
<br>
Fu Shun adopted a serious expression while she watched the group of girls leave.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Fu Shun：</span><br>
Hmm... I get it. That's how it is...<br>
<br>
WHOOSH!<br>
Caring little about the dry grass caught in her hair, Fu Shun leaped like a tiger out of the bushes.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Fu Shun：</span><br>
The dastardly supervillain Chien Wu must've stolen their treasure!<br>
We've got to defeat her and take all the treasure back!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Fu Po：</span><br>
Really? That sounds like fun!<br>
Err, I mean... Agreed! We must reclaim that which has been stolen!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Fei Yuen：</span><br>
Right! And they said something about a show...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Fu Shun：</span><br>
A show... Maybe they meant the port fashion show that's in two days?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Fu Po：</span><br>
Then time must somehow be a factor in this...<br>
Oh no... Is the stolen treasure going to fully become her property when the fashion show starts?!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Fu Shun：</span><br>
If so, there's no time to waste! We've got to take action now!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Fu Po：</span><br>
Hold your horses!<br>
<br>
Fu Po slowly stood up and thoughtfully put her hand under her chin.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Fu Po：</span><br>
Ahem... In vain does the archer shoot his arrow before he aims – something-something success, the rest doesn't matter!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Fei Yuen：</span><br>
Huh?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Fu Shun：</span><br>
What? What does archery have to do with anything?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Fu Po：</span><br>
Of course a layman doesn't get it. What I'm saying is: If you want to succeed, you have to think ahead!<br>
That is to say, we must plan out this mission and not just rush in blindly!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Fei Yuen：</span><br>
Ooh! Lady Yuen agrees!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Fu Shun：</span><br>
Hang on! If we're going on a mission, then there's something even more important than the plan itself!<br>
First of all, this mission needs a name!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Fu Po：</span><br>
Hmm. True! Every good mission deserves an epithet.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Fu Shun：</span><br>
Then I dub thee...<br>
The Great Adventure Where We Topple Chien Wu and Take Back the Treasure!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Fei Yuen：</span><br>
Hooray! An adventure!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Fu Shun：</span><br>
Yeah! Adventuuure!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Fu Po：</span><br>
Who decided that it's an adventure now? Bah, doesn't matter.<br>
I'm going to hatch a plan now! I'll call you when I'm finished!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Fu Shun：</span><br>
Good luck, our mastermind!<br>

Spring Fashion Festa<br>
<br>
2 Phase 1: Sneak and Search<br>
Nighttime - On a wall enclosing the port's fashion show venue<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Fu Po：</span><br>
Hngh! Hnngghh!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Fu Shun：</span><br>
Come on, you can do it! Just a teeny bit more and you'll be over the wall!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Fei Yuen：</span><br>
You're shaking like a newborn baby deer!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Fu Po：</span><br>
*pant*... *pant*... I made it over... Oh! Nooooo!<br>
<br>
Port - Inside the fashion show venue<br>
The group of adventurers snuck around the corridor, covered from head to toe in dust.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Fu Po：</span><br>
What a rough start... From now on, we'll stick strictly to the plan! Find the treasure before anything else!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Fu Shun：</span><br>
I mean, when you think about it, it was all your fault. It was you who couldn't climb the wall and you who fell right on us!<br>
You need to adventure more and build some muscle!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Fu Po：</span><br>
Ugh... I'm a strategist, okay? A strategist! I don't belong in the thick of the battle!<br>
EEEEEEEK!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Fei Yuen：</span><br>
AAAAAHHHHHH!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Fu Shun：</span><br>
What's wrong?!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Fei Yuen：</span><br>
Lady Yuen doesn't know!<br>
I only screamed because her scream scared me!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Fu Po：</span><br>
S-s-s-something just ran by! I-I saw it myself!<br>
It was pale white! With long hair! And went that way!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Fu Shun：</span><br>
Whoa! I saw it! That was a ghost!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Fu Po：</span><br>
R-really? A ghost?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Fu Shun：</span><br>
That's what I said! My adventurer's eyes are never wrong!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Fei Yuen：</span><br>
Lady Yuen saw it, too! Let's chase after it!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Fu Po：</span><br>
H-h-hey, wait! Don't be hasty! And don't leave me behind!<br>
<br>
Fu Shun took the lead, with Fei Yuen in the middle and Fu Po bringing up the rear. Their pursuit of the ghost led them onto the runway.<br>
It was dark, and there were sparse human figures standing on the runway.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Fu Po：</span><br>
S-surely those aren't all ghosts, right?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Fei Yuen：</span><br>
They're just mannequins, silly. Heheh, if you're scared, get behind me and Lady Yuen will protect you!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Fu Po：</span><br>
Hey, I'm not scared...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Fu Shun：</span><br>
Shh! Quiet! I just heard something!<br>
<br>
There was a tap-tap-tap, like the sound of footsteps...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Fu Po：</span><br>
S-someone's moving?! But the runway is empty... IS there a ghost here after all?!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Fu Shun：</span><br>
Well, yeah, duh!<br>
There's got to be not just one ghost, but a whole team of them. Almost like they were put here to guard something...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Fei Yuen：</span><br>
If so, it's gotta be the treasure!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Fu Shun：</span><br>
Yeah! Let's split up and look around!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Fu Po：</span><br>
I-I'll go with Yuen! There will be things that only my keen senses will notice!<br>
<br>
The three fumbled through the dark in search of anything at the venue – but they found nothing.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Fu Shun：</span><br>
Damn that Chien Wu! Nobody should be this cautious!<br>
Without any clues, I don't think we're going to find anything.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Fei Yuen：</span><br>
What do we do? Our adventure's going to end in failure at this rate!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Fu Po：</span><br>
I think what we need to do is start over from square one.<br>
Clearly, the treasure is exceptionally well hidden. There are ghosts guarding it, too.<br>
Seeing as my plan isn't going as I'd hoped, the odds that we'll find the treasure tonight are extremely low.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Fu Shun：</span><br>
So you mean...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Fu Po：</span><br>
The clouds grow dark – it's time to skedaddle!<br>
<br>
Meanwhile, backstage at the fashion show venue...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Noshiro：</span><br>
Guam, did you just do a sound test? Did something go wrong?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Guam：</span><br>
Sure did. It played a footsteps sound effect for some reason!<br>
Boy, am I glad I ran that test. It'd be so embarrassing if that happened during the actual show!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Noshiro：</span><br>
Yes, it would be. Also, have you inspected the security camera feeds?<br>
Is every area of the fashion show covered?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Guam：</span><br>
I'm checking that right now! Mogador's helping out by making a lap around the whole place.<br>
Right now she's aaat... checkpoint number 28!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Noshiro：</span><br>
Huh? Why does she have a white towel wrapped around her?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Guam：</span><br>
Oh, that? Ahaha. Because it's dark in the venue at night, that makes her more visible on the feed.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Noshiro：</span><br>
I see... Wait, what's this? There are people on the runway at checkpoint 2...<br>
Fu Po, Fei Yuen, and Fu Shun? What are they doing here?<br>
Last time I checked, they weren't staff members.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Guam：</span><br>
They're probably just on another one of their wacky adventures. Knowing them, I think they're up to some harmless pranks!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Noshiro：</span><br>
Good point... Still, I don't want any accidents to happen. I'll tell Chien Wu about this.<br>

<br>
3 Phase 2: Ambush<br>
The following night, the three adventurers snuck into the venue once more, eager for redemption.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Fu Shun：</span><br>
12 o'clock... Clear!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Fei Yuen：</span><br>
Left and right... Clear!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Fu Po：</span><br>
Whew... No ghosts tonight. Thank god.<br>
<br>
With Fu Shun and Fei Yuen as her shields, Fu Po marched onward. After carefully surveying her surroundings again, she chose a particular spot.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Fu Po：</span><br>
Hmm... The end of the runway is the best place. We'll put the devices here!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Fei Yuen：</span><br>
Heheh... Hiding the devices right under the runway – what an ingenious plan.<br>
Even the dastardly Chien Wu won't see this coming.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Fu Shun：</span><br>
Yeah! This is gonna be exciting!<br>
<br>
After much heavy lifting, the adventurers managed to move their mysterious devices into place.<br>
Fu Shun and Fei Yuen sat on the floor, exhausted from their labor, while Fu Po ascended the runway and gazed down at them.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Fu Po：</span><br>
There's no time to rest!<br>
The mission isn't over! Remember version 2.0 of the Great Adventure Where We Topple– Ugh! You know the rest!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Fei Yuen：</span><br>
Uhh... First we haul in the devices, then we... What was the next part?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Fu Shun：</span><br>
That's the part when our great adventure begins! I think!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Fu Po：</span><br>
WRONG!<br>
Ugh... Fine. I'll explain my brilliant plan to you again!<br>
First, let me introduce these two devices that da Vinci lent to us.<br>
This is the Biggy Blowy Bubble Machine. It blows a huge stream of bubbles, making the floor slippery and impossible to stand on!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Fu Shun：</span><br>
Ooh! That's going to stop the evil Chien Wu so she can't chase us, right?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Fu Po：</span><br>
Correct! And this other contraption is the Burny Brighty Firework Launcher! You just press this button to launch every firework at once! It will send Chien Wu's cohorts into a panic.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Fu Shun&Fei Yuen：</span><br>
- Yeah, cohorts like An Shan! - Yup, cohorts like Chang Feng!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Fu Po：</span><br>
Precisely! As long as we can draw their attention away, they'll never catch wind of our plan! Heheh!<br>
So, now we simply have to place the devices as planned and set timers so they activate at just the right moment. Then, when Chien Wu gets up on the runway tomorrow...<br>
Vrrr! Ka-bang! Boom! The fireworks go off and the bubbles spray everywhere at the same time! Then that's slam-bang slam-dunk victory for us!<br>
It's going to get really chaotic, and we'll exploit that commotion to take back the treasure!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Fei Yuen：</span><br>
We're gonna teach Chien Wu that being evil never pays off!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Fu Shun：</span><br>
Yeah! Let's show her what it's like to be stolen from!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Fu Po：</span><br>
That's the spirit! Now come on, set the devices up like in the diagrams!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Fei Yuen：</span><br>
Okay! ...Wait, Lady Yuen can't make any dang sense of this diagram!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Fu Po：</span><br>
You're holding it upside down... Here. Get it now?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Fu Shun：</span><br>
I still can't make heads or tails of it... What's this supposed to be? An octopus?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Fu Po：</span><br>
No, that's ME!<br>
For the love of... I'll just instruct you directly.<br>
<br>
After Fu Po painstakingly explained what to do using hand gestures and mimes, Fei Yuen and Fu Shun finally managed to set up the devices according to the diagrams.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Fu Po：</span><br>
There... That's the last one. It's finally over...<br>
Now we– Whuaahhh! I slipped!<br>
<br>
Fu Po not only slipped, she ran into the fireworks launcher – and even worse yet, she slammed the button to launch the fireworks.<br>
BANG! CRACKLE! POP! BOOM!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Fu Po：</span><br>
Oh no! H-how do I stop it?!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Fu Shun：</span><br>
What happened?! Why's the machine launching fireworks?!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Fu Po：</span><br>
I... I simply wanted to test the Burny Brighty Firework Launcher's capabilities!<br>
Seeing just how powerful it is, I know now that it's absolutely going to shock everyone tomorrow!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Fei Yuen：</span><br>
Ohh! Good thinking!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Fu Shun：</span><br>
Not really! Chien Wu will know something's up because of all this noise!<br>
If she catches us, all our hard work will be for nothing!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Fu Po：</span><br>
Uh, true! I'd better make it stop! Uhh, where is the off button?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Fu Shun：</span><br>
Should I just use my flying kick to make it stop?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Fu Po：</span><br>
No! Don't break it! We're borrowing it, remember?!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Fei Yuen：</span><br>
Lady Yuen thinks pressing the power button will do the trick. Hmm... It should be this red button!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Fu Po：</span><br>
Hey, wait, just because it's red doesn't mean it's–<br>
<br>
Fu Po's words fell on deaf ears – Fei Yuen is too adventurous for such warnings. She pressed the red button.<br>
BANG! BOOM! BOOM! KABOOM!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Fei Yuen：</span><br>
Uh-oh! That just made it launch even more!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Fu Po：</span><br>
Fei Yuen, you numbskull!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Baltimore：</span><br>
Who's there?!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Fu Shun：</span><br>
Crap! Someone's here!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Fu Po：</span><br>
They're onto us... Time for plan B!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Fu Shun：</span><br>
And what's plan B?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Fu Po：</span><br>
As the Thirty-Six Stratagems say... If all else fails, retreat!<br>

<br>
4 Expecting the Unexpected<br>
After finishing all my side-tasks, I went to the fashion show venue to do some final checks with Chien Wu before it kicks off tomorrow.<br>
Then, while looking around the entrance on the outside, I suddenly heard footsteps rushing toward me.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Fu Shun：</span><br>
Faster, faster! Please don't tell me anyone's after us!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Fei Yuen：</span><br>
No, we're clear!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Fu Po：</span><br>
*pant*... *pant*... How are you so fast?! Wait for me!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Fu Shun：</span><br>
We're not fast, you're just too slow!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Fei Yuen：</span><br>
Hang on, isn't that...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Fu Shun：</span><br>
Oh! It's the Commander?!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Fu Po：</span><br>
Wait, what?! Look ooout!<br>
<br>
Fu Shun and Fei Yuen dodge left and right without effort, but Fu Po is too tired and reacts too late. She's running right toward me.<br>
<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项1：(Catch her.)</span>'''''<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项2：(Move out of the way.)</span>'''''<br>
<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项1）</span>'''''In the blink of an eye, I extend my arms and catch Fu Po.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Fu Shun：</span><br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项1）</span>'''''Whoa, that was awesome!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Fu Po：</span><br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项1）</span>'''''Whew... Thanks, Commander!<br>
<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项2）</span>'''''Instinctively, I get out of danger's way.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Fu Shun：</span><br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项2）</span>'''''Nice dodge, Commander!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Fu Po：</span><br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项2）</span>'''''Whew... I finally stopped. And nobody got hurt!<br>
<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项1：What's going on? Is someone chasing you?</span>'''''<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项2：Are you alright?</span>'''''<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Fei Yuen：</span><br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项1）</span>'''''What? Uh, no! Why would there be?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Fu Shun：</span><br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项2）</span>'''''Right as rain!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Fu Po：</span><br>
Uhh... Why are you here, Commander?<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
To talk to Chien Wu and discuss how the preparations for tomorrow's fashion show are going.<br>
What about you three? Why are you out this late?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Fei Yuen：</span><br>
Um...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Fu Shun：</span><br>
Err...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Fu Po：</span><br>
Well...<br>
<br>
The destroyers take a step back, huddle together, and start whispering amongst themselves.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Fei Yuen：</span><br>
Should we spill the beans?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Fu Po：</span><br>
The Commander's here to see Chien Wu and will appear at the fashion show tomorrow. Under threat from Chien Wu, maybe?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Fu Shun：</span><br>
I think Chien Wu may already have brainwashed the Commander!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Fu Po：</span><br>
Everything will be ruined if our plan gets out, so the smartest move is to be quiet about it for now!<br>
Dang it... I'll have to figure out how to break the Commander free from Chien Wu's evil spell!<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
(I heard every word of that, but I'll keep that to myself...)<br>
<br>
After a little while, they gather their thoughts.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Fei Yuen：</span><br>
Okay, Commander! We were on an adventure in–<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Fu Shun：</span><br>
No, we weren't! We were racing each other! Uh, probably! Right, Fu Po?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Fu Po：</span><br>
Right, yeah! Racing! Each other!<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Uh-huh...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Fei Yuen：</span><br>
*yaaawn*! Gosh, I'm so tired! Let's go home and go to bed!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Fu Shun：</span><br>
See you later, Commander!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Fu Po：</span><br>
Toodles!<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Uh-huh...<br>
(Alright then. I'll go talk to Chien Wu.)<br>
<br>
A few minutes later, in the venue's waiting room...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Baltimore：</span><br>
Look! The Commander's here!<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Good evening, everyone.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Illustrious：</span><br>
Good evening to you.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Good evening, everyone.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Daisen：</span><br>
How good of you to come. I shall put on some tea. Actually, since it's so late, would you perhaps prefer warm milk instead?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Belfast：</span><br>
Miss Daisen, I can go warm the milk right now.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
No need, really. I know you have work to do, so don't mind me.<br>
Do you know where Chien Wu is? I'm looking for her.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Hai Yung：</span><br>
She's over there, doing some final checks. I'll take you to her.<br>
<br>
Hai Yung leads me to the design and tailoring area. Not far away, I catch sight of Chien Wu focused on perfecting the final details of a new outfit.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Hai Yung：</span><br>
Chien Wu, the Commander's here.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Good evening.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Chien Wu：</span><br>
Impeccable timing. Come here and try on this outfit. It's easier to adjust if I see how they fit with my own eyes.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Come again? I thought I was only going to attend as a guest.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Chien Wu：</span><br>
That's correct, but even guests need new outfits, don't they?<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
True, but this is also the first time I've heard of this.<br>
Is this something special you planned in secret?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Chien Wu：</span><br>
More or less. There were some twists and turns along the way of making it happen.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Twists and turns?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Hai Yung：</span><br>
Uhh, let me explain.<br>
When we first discussed this, opinions were split and we couldn't decide on a final look for the outfit.<br>
In the end, we decided to split into six groups and each make an outfit based on our own ideas.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Wait, will I have to try out six different outfits tomorrow?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Hai Yung：</span><br>
No, just one.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Huh? So did you pick out the best one of the bunch?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Hai Yung：</span><br>
Nope. All six outfits were rejected.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
What? How?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Hai Yung：</span><br>
Cleveland's group wanted to make an outfit out of spider silk. They had a hard time procuring it and literally poked a hornets' nest along the way.<br>
New Jersey's group wanted to make theirs out of black cloth that glows like the rainbow. They succeeded with the first bit, but not the second.<br>
Formidable's, Marco Polo's, da Vinci's, and Shimakaze's groups similarly ran into troubles of their own.<br>
Ultimately, not a single group managed to complete an outfit.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Even da Vinci couldn't do it?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Chien Wu：</span><br>
No. Unless you'd call a steam-powered suit of armor "an outfit."<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
......<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Hai Yung：</span><br>
Since they failed, Chien Wu went back to the initial plan and made a better outfit using the materials the others gathered.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
That can't have been easy. Good job, Chien Wu.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Chien Wu：</span><br>
Don't mention it. I did it because I personally enjoyed it.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
(Those were some twists and turns, alright... They all had their own adventure along the way.)<br>
(...Wait, why did I suddenly think of the word "adventure"?)<br>
(Oh, right...)<br>
On another subject, I ran into Fu Po and her friends outside the venue just earlier. Are they part of your staff?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Chien Wu：</span><br>
Ah, them. Heehee.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Chen Hai：</span><br>
Rest assured, we know everything that they're up to.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Chien Wu：</span><br>
Mostly, they just make a racket. Sometimes, though, they come up with some clever ideas.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Clever ideas?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Chien Wu：</span><br>
For instance, they left some interesting machines under the runway. Da Vinci is already on the way to check them out.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Hai Yung：</span><br>
Heh... They have no idea that da Vinci is on our side and that we've been watching them ever since they borrowed her inventions.<br>
Whatever their plan is, I guarantee you they won't cause any trouble.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Since you have them under control, I have nothing to worry about.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Chien Wu：</span><br>
Indeed. Was there anything else?<br>
If you don't have any more questions, I'd like you to try this outfit on.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
You want me to get changed right now?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Chien Wu：</span><br>
Yes, there's still time to adjust the details if it doesn't fit you well.<br>
The changing room is over here. It's a bit tricky to put on, so I'll help you out.<br>

Spring Fashion Festa<br>
<br>
5 Phase 3: Curtain Call<br>
Day of the port fashion show - Venue<br>
In a dark corner that the spotlights could not reach, three shadowy figures were skulking about the audience seats.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Fu Shun：</span><br>
Phew! We just made it in time!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Fei Yuen：</span><br>
I blame Fu Po for slowing us down! Chang Feng nearly found us!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Fu Po：</span><br>
Look, I had to check on the devices! We would have been in way more trouble if they caught us during last night's commotion!<br>
Nobody's found them yet. Everything is working as it should...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Fu Shun：</span><br>
Shh! Be quiet or people will hear you!<br>
<br>
Fu Po covered her mouth with her own hands and nodded apologetically.<br>
At that same moment, the runway lit up brightly with blinking neon lights, drawing the whole audience's attention.<br>
Then, one by one, the models started to walk out.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">{namecode:199}：</span><br>
Hellooo! New Jersey is in the house!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">{namecode:523}：</span><br>
Pretty lively here. Not bad.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Brest：</span><br>
Good evening, dear audience! Let us together weave a wonderful poem tonight!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Flasher：</span><br>
*sniffle*... All their outfits are so pretty... I'll have to ask Chien Wu how to make Empery-style clothing later...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Anchorage：</span><br>
Pretty clothes... Anchorage likes them!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Fei Yuen：</span><br>
Whoooa! Lady Yuen wants to wear something like that too!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Fu Po：</span><br>
Focus, Yuen! Now is not the time for that!<br>
Our priority right now is to rescue the Commander and take back all the stolen treasure!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Fu Shun：</span><br>
Now that you mention it, where IS the Commander? Not in the audience, that's for sure...<br>
<br>
Fu Shun made a confuddled look, and at the same time, the lights in the venue went out and fancy music began playing through the speakers.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Guam：</span><br>
Now it's time for the most electrifying moment of the night! Let's welcome the Commander and Chien Wu to showcase the most premium and beautiful work!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Fu Shun：</span><br>
What?! The Commander's going on stage with the treasure?!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Fei Yuen：</span><br>
Then that means... the Commander's also gonna get freaked out by the fireworks and bubbles!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Fu Po：</span><br>
Damn you, Chien Wu! How dare you use the Commander as a shield!<br>
Grr... This is leaps and bounds more difficult than extracting the Commander from the audience!<br>
Our only option now is to enact plan C!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Fei Yuen：</span><br>
What's plan C?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Fu Po：</span><br>
Splitting up! I'll whip up a distraction and lead the Commander to safety! You two take care of the treasure!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Fu Shun&Fei Yuen：</span><br>
Roger!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Guam：</span><br>
Now it's time for the most electrifying moment of the night! Let's welcome the Commander and Chien Wu to showcase the most premium and beautiful work!<br>
<br>
In time with Guam's announcement, the platform under my feet ascends to the runway, bringing me into the spotlight.<br>
Just as I'm about to start speaking, a little girl bursts onto the stage out of nowhere.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Fu Po：</span><br>
Quick, Commander! Come with me!<br>
<br>
She looks tense. I answer her with an appropriately serious look.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Why? What is it?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Fu Po：</span><br>
No time to explain! Chien Wu stole everyone's most precious treasure! She's also trying to use you to protect herself!<br>
Fu Shun! Fei Yuen! Hurry and find the treasure!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Fu Shun&Fei Yuen：</span><br>
- The Queen of Adventure is on the scene! - Don't forget about Lady Yuen!<br>
<br>
Two more figures jump onto the stage. Everything looks to be going according to Fu Po's plan.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">An Shan：</span><br>
Fu Shuuun! I will not stand by while you stir up trouble again!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Fu Shun：</span><br>
Crap, it's An Shan! Girls, please write good things about me in my obituary...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Chang Feng：</span><br>
Fu Po, Fei Yuen, might I ask what you're trying to do?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Fei Yuen：</span><br>
Uh-oh! Chang Feng! I haven't done anything wrong! Commander, help meee!<br>
<br>
Well, this is also exactly as Chien Wu and the others predicted.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Fu Po：</span><br>
Listen, Chang Feng! We were only trying to reclaim the treasure that this supervillain stole!<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Come again? Treasure? Supervillain?<br>
<br>
I look over at Chien Wu. She cracks a mysteriously knowing smile and nods.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Fu Shun：</span><br>
There she is! The supervillain!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Fei Yuen：</span><br>
She's finally shown herself!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Hai Yung：</span><br>
Wow... You've sure spun up some story in your heads.<br>
Just let me explain what's actually going on.<br>
<br>
Hai Yung explains to the three little adventurers what she told me yesterday.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Fu Shun：</span><br>
Wait, what? Chien Wu was just making clothes?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Fu Po：</span><br>
And the Commander's outfit was the treasure?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Hai Yung：</span><br>
Yup. That outfit is the crystallization of our hard work. Well, I say "our," but Chien Wu did most of it.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">An Shan：</span><br>
How in the world did you three even jump to that conclusion?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Fei Yuen：</span><br>
We're so sorry...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Fu Shun：</span><br>
Well, talk about a big misunderstanding, huh? Haha...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Fu Po：</span><br>
W-wait... It's happening!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Chang Feng：</span><br>
What is?<br>
<br>
KABOOOM!<br>
PEW! BOOM! BOOM! KABOOM! BANG!<br>
Da Vinci's Biggy Blowy Bubble Machine and Burny Brighty Firework Launcher both power up at the same time.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Fu Po：</span><br>
Look out, Comma– Huh?<br>
What's going on?<br>
How'd the firework launcher end up in the corner over there?<br>
And why is the bubble machine blowing so few bubbles? It's not making the runway slippery in the least...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Leonardo da Vinci：</span><br>
Because I reconfigured them last night, of course!<br>
If you're going to use them on the runway, safety comes first!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Fu Po：</span><br>
No... Don't tell me... you knew about our plan?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Hai Yung：</span><br>
Yeah? Obviously.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Fu Shun：</span><br>
Our grand plan... All for nothing!<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
While it failed to disrupt the show, it succeeded in creating some fancy stage effects.<br>
<br>
Brilliant fireworks blossom in the air while the bubbles glisten like pearls. It's like a scene out of a dream.<br>
Coupled with the Empery-style attire the models are wearing, the stage takes on a fantastical feel.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Fei Yuen：</span><br>
Wooow... So our adventure wasn't a total flop then, right?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Fu Shun：</span><br>
Yeah, I guess?<br>
The Great Adventure Where We Topple Chien... I mean, Where We Celebrate the Port Fashion Show – was a huge success!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">An Shan：</span><br>
You're not off the hook just because you changed the name, young lady.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Fu Shun：</span><br>
Ahahaha...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Chang Feng：</span><br>
Fu Po, Fei Yuen, we're going to have a long talk later.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Fu Po：</span><br>
No! This is all a big misunderstanding! You have to believe me!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Fei Yuen：</span><br>
Lady Yuen had no idea what we were doing! Honest!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Alfredo Oriani：</span><br>
Commander! Girls! Look this way and say "cheese"!<br>
<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项1：(Face the camera and smile.)</span>'''''<br>
<br>
SNAP!<br>
And so, the fashion show comes to a wrap amidst joyous laughter.<br>
Spring Fashion Festa - The End<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Fu Po：</span><br>
I'll plan things through next time, I swear...<br>
Actually, no...<br>
No more plans! I'm never doing this ever again!<br>
