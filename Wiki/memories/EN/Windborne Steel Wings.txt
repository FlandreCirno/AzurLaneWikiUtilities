Blue skies, white clouds, and a dreamlike paradise surrounded by the sea. The Samoan Islands care little for the change of seasons.<br>
Among these tropics was a girl, piloting an aircraft.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Fargo：</span><br>
Results: Mild winds, 83% humidity, which is 3% higher than yesterday; temperature is 80 degrees Fahrenheit, more or less the same as measured at the same time yesterday.<br>
No rain clouds detected within the monitoring range of my aircraft.<br>
The probability of rainfall is 1% within the next 8 hours, 15% within the next 16, and 23% within the next 24.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Bell：</span><br>
So in short, great weather on the whole.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Herring：</span><br>
Daaamn, talk about professional. Don't need a weather station when you've got Fargo!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Fargo：</span><br>
Thank you for using our weather forecast service. Now please pay the fine.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Bell：</span><br>
F-fine? You're gonna charge us?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Fargo：</span><br>
I meant it as a joke.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Herring：</span><br>
Sure didn't sound like one!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Fargo：</span><br>
Oh. That might be because I'm still practicing my facial expressions. Let me raise my happiness index by 200%. Ahem...<br>
I just wanted to say something sillyyy! Don't take everything so seriouslyyy!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Herring & Bell：</span><br>
……<br>
……<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Fargo：</span><br>
I overdid it, didn't I?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Bell：</span><br>
A little. Ahahaha...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Herring：</span><br>
Anyhow, we know the weather's gonna stay good now. Will make things easier for us.<br>
Y'all ready to go?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Bell：</span><br>
Uh, sure... Are we really doing this?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Herring：</span><br>
Too late to be gettin' cold feet. The girls are already waiting for us at the campsite.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Communicator：</span><br>
BEEP BEEP!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Herring：</span><br>
That's Pittsburgh calling. Probably got the place set up by now. Hello?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Pittsburgh：</span><br>
Herring, we've finished up over here.<br>
We have a tent, a grill, and beautiful Samoan scenery waiting for you.<br>
How are things going on your end?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Herring：</span><br>
Relaaax, we've got everything we'll need and lots of it. On another note, what's Indiana up to?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Pittsburgh：</span><br>
She went into the forest to gather wood.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Fargo：</span><br>
Wood? What for?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Pittsburgh：</span><br>
Fuel for the grill.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Fargo：</span><br>
But our grill uses a special type of charcoal made just for it.<br>
You could just have just asked me to bring you more. I'm a logistics expert, remember?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Pittsburgh：</span><br>
Yeah, that's exactly what I told Indiana.<br>
But she insisted on doing it her way anyway. Said something about being unable to sit still and wanting to do something wild while we're here.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Bell：</span><br>
She... She knows we're having canned herring, right?<br>
How much wilder does it need to get to satisfy her?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Pittsburgh：</span><br>
No idea.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Fargo：</span><br>
Hah. I like her gusto.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Bell：</span><br>
Wait, was that you, Fargo?!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Fargo：</span><br>
Yes? What about it?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Bell：</span><br>
You showed some emotion without adjusting your indexes or whatever! You did it!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Fargo：</span><br>
Yes, yes...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Herring：</span><br>
Let Indiana have her fun. I can make canned herring taste good even with plain ol' firewood.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Fargo：</span><br>
I believe in you.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Herring：</span><br>
Oh really? Then what's in that big box behind you?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Fargo：</span><br>
Extra ingredients. It's a freezer container to keep them fresh.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Herring：</span><br>
"I believe in you," my ass! You know what? I'm gonna make something so good you'll be jumping for joy after tasting it!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Pittsburgh：</span><br>
Heehee. I'll send you the coordinates now, so don't be too long. Oh, and don't forget the wine.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Bell：</span><br>
Got it!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Herring：</span><br>
Let the picnic begin! It's time to clear the name of canned herring and prove how good it really is!<br>
Onward, to a future where herring is herr-king!<br>
<br>
An illusion has taken hold across every corner of the Pacific.<br>
Some of its victims embrace it, replacing reality with an idealized dream.<br>
Others fight against it, grasping onto the truth for what it is.<br>
Close your eyes in a dream, and the dream becomes reality. Open your eyes, and reality becomes truth.<br>
A battle was on the cusp of starting. Meanwhile, the Commander was en route to the Dragon Empery.<br>

<br>
Blue skies, white clouds, and a dreamlike paradise surrounded by the sea. The Samoan Islands care little for the change of seasons.<br>
Among these tropics was a fleet of shipgirls dashing across the glittering waves.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Shimanto：</span><br>
Lady Nagato, Harutsuki and I will arrive at the objective soon.<br>
I haven't seen anything unusual yet... but I do get this uncanny feeling.<br>
It was cloudy this whole time, then it suddenly turned sunny as soon as we approached the island.<br>
Even if it looks peaceful on the surface, it's safe to assume some twisted illusion hangs over this sea.<br>
Understood. Rest assured, Milady, we will handle this.<br>
You take care, too. We'll come back as soon as our mission here has concluded.<br>
<br>
Shimanto hung up, then looked at Harutsuki and said something to her.<br>
They kicked their engines into high gear and separated, leaving hundreds of shikigami in their wake. The shikigami created a cherry-pink magic circle.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Harutsuki：</span><br>
Dragon God, everything is set up. We can breach whenever you're ready!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Shimanto：</span><br>
Good. With these shikigami created with Lady Nagato's help, we will sneak inside this massive illusion.<br>
Shikigami serpent, unleash your divine might!<br>
<br>
Eagle Union Samoa - Campsite<br>
The afternoon sun shone on the island, casting shadows of the trees on the ground.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Bell：</span><br>
Last night was great! The hours really flew by, too. Next thing you know, it's late in the night!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Pittsburgh：</span><br>
Ugh... I feel dizzy...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Bell：</span><br>
I don't know how you did it, but you ACTUALLY got drunk off of soda...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Pittsburgh：</span><br>
Mmgh... Gimme another... Cheers...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Indiana：</span><br>
Doesn't look like she'll be up anytime soon.<br>
Girl, the herring you made yesterday went well with the cocktail... I can't deny it was pretty interesting.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Herring：</span><br>
Ooh, is that acknowledgment I hear? Acknowledgment that herring is good?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Indiana：</span><br>
I admit it. Besides, herring's rich in protein, so it's a power food for building muscle.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Herring：</span><br>
Does physical exercise even, y'know, have an effect on our bodies? Is there any science behind that?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Indiana：</span><br>
Don't need any science. All you need is belief and determination. And motivation!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Herring：</span><br>
Uh-huh. Belief, determination, and... Hang on, we're gettin' off-topic here!<br>
The canned herring! What did you think about it?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Indiana：</span><br>
Well, everything you cooked up yesterday was good... except for that canned herring.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Herring：</span><br>
Damn... So a partial success. That's not nearly good enough for me, though. I'll nail it next time!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Bell：</span><br>
Wait... We're doing this again?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Herring：</span><br>
Again and again until you're all loco for the canned herring!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Bell：</span><br>
Well... I suppose in the comics I read, ninjas do train themselves to stomach anything... Fine, if I must!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Herring：</span><br>
Relax, I'm not gonna put you through torture! It was just a joke.<br>
Anyway, thanks for the feedback, y'all. I'll focus on modifying the recipe and make it more palatable for next time!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Indiana：</span><br>
Attagirl. Keep at it, and one day you'll cook up something we can all stomach.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Herring：</span><br>
Aww, thanks! Hey, where's Fargo? Is she still sleeping?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Bell：</span><br>
Fargo is the opposite of a sleepyhead. She got up early this morning and said she's got something to do.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Pittsburgh：</span><br>
Zzzzz... Huh? Something to do?<br>
Oh, crap!<br>
That reminds me! A tourist party from the Sakura Empire's coming here today!<br>
I shouldn't have drank all that dang soda... Come on, let's clean the place up quick and get ready to greet our guests!<br>
Amagi's leading the delegation! They may be tourists, but that doesn't mean we can slack on their reception!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Communicator：</span><br>
BEEP BEEP!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Fargo：</span><br>
You picked up fast. Awake already?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Pittsburgh：</span><br>
The tourists, Fargo! Where are they?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Fargo：</span><br>
Calm down. I've set the table for them. Wash up, put on a change of clothes, and come to pier three where I am.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Indiana：</span><br>
Professional as always. Way to go, Fargo.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Pittsburgh：</span><br>
You heard her, girls. Get yourselves in order, then it's time to speak to the Sakurans. This place is about to get busy!<br>
<br>
BOOOM!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Pittsburgh：</span><br>
Huh? Did you hear that?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Bell：</span><br>
Did... Did a torii gate just appear out of nowhere over there? I'm not seeing things, am I?<br>
<br>
A torii gate that was certainly not there a minute ago had appeared in a flat, grassy field not far from them.<br>
Stranger yet, they saw two shipgirls donning Sakuran attire on the other side of the gate. With a casual stride, they emerged from it.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Shimanto：</span><br>
You must be the Eagle Union fleet stationed here. Ahem... I am Shimanto, and this is Harutsuki.<br>
We're here on behalf of Lady Nagato. Could you point us to your leader? It's important.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Indiana：</span><br>
That'd be me. I'm Indiana, the boss around here. We're on vacation here, so we've not exactly been "stationed" anywhere.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Shimanto：</span><br>
Excuse me? A vacation?<br>
Hmm... It seems that us simply being here isn't enough to dispel the cognitive tampering caused by the illusion.<br>
That's okay. I still have another trick up my sleeve.<br>
Hold still.<br>
<br>
Shimanto suddenly took a step forward and stuck a paper talisman on Indiana's forehead.<br>
It burst into a cherry pink light upon contact before falling apart into strips.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Indiana：</span><br>
What did you just... do to me?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Shimanto：</span><br>
Don't be alarmed. I simply used an external means to break the illusion's spell on you.<br>
Do you remember now? Do you remember your original mission?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Indiana：</span><br>
Yeah... We're the fleet holding the fort here at Samoa, and I'm the flagship.<br>
We're not on a damn vacation. This is serious business.<br>
I don't get it, though... How did I forget that until just now?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Shimanto：</span><br>
That's what I'm trying to figure out. I'm glad you snapped out of it.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Indiana：</span><br>
Appreciate it. Now can you explain how you got here and how you worked out that we're under some sort of spell?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Shimanto：</span><br>
Harutsuki and I were originally on the Solomon Islands, together with Lady Nagato.<br>
As for how we got here... The thing that happened to you happened over there, too. Strange foes appeared just as it occurred.<br>
We managed to break the illusion and somehow hold on to the islands, but then we lost contact with the base on the nearby Marshall Islands.<br>
Lady Nagato realized how serious the situation was and foresaw that an all-out war between us was inevitable if we didn't do something.<br>
Therefore, we decided to try and get in contact with you – as in, the Eagle Union.<br>
We tried to call every base of yours we knew of, but none of them would answer us.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Indiana：</span><br>
Wait... Are you saying every last one of our bases has been affected by this illusion?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Shimanto：</span><br>
Yes. That's the only explanation.<br>
Anyway – Lady Nagato then dispatched us to this island, as it was the closest to us.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Indiana：</span><br>
Man, I almost can't believe what I'm hearing... On behalf of all of us, thanks for reaching out to us.<br>
If it weren't for you, I'd have been none the wiser to any of this.<br>
How's the Sakura Empire dealing with all this? Do you need our help?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Shimanto：</span><br>
Thanks, but we're okay. You should be more concerned with the situation over at your own bases.<br>
Take these talismans. You can use them to wake people up from the illusion.<br>
Sorry, I should add... you'd be wise to accept this gift from the Dragon God.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Indiana：</span><br>
Thanks. You've saved our bacon today, and we will not forget that.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Shimanto：</span><br>
You're welcome. Now, if you'll excuse us, we must get back to Lady Nagato.<br>
Breaking the illusion will make the weather return to normal, by the way. It'll be cloudy, so get ready for that.<br>
If you want my advice – bring your umbrellas and raincoats!<br>

<br>
Eagle Union Samoa - Sometime later<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Fargo：</span><br>
Base at Kiritimati. No response.<br>
Base at AF. No response.<br>
Port at PH. No response.<br>
Base at SD. No response.<br>
I've tried to contact each and every one of our bases across the Pacific now. None of them answered.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Bell：</span><br>
Shimanto wasn't kidding, then... This situation is far, far more serious than I thought.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Fargo：</span><br>
It IS possible that our communicators simply don't have the signal strength necessary since we haven't fully lifted the illusion yet.<br>
For all we know, the bases may be unreachable due to plain jamming.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Pittsburgh：</span><br>
That's true.<br>
But also, how can you tell that we've not eliminated the illusion fully yet?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Fargo：</span><br>
My recon planes spotted an approaching fleet. Affiliation unknown.<br>
Their external identifiers match with Sakuran mass-produced ships, but only by 35.75%.<br>
They're shrouded in black mist, making further identification impossible.<br>
Here's a picture my planes took.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Indiana：</span><br>
They're covered in black mist alright... Looks a lot like those corrosion entities the Commander told us about.<br>
Only thing is, that intel said they can't be identified at all, yet you said you recognize at least part of 'em.<br>
Back this data up just to be safe. We'll send it to SD once we've got signal again.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Fargo：</span><br>
I know.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Herring：</span><br>
Y'know... when we were "dreaming," or whatever, didn't we say some Sakuran tourists were coming soon?<br>
Looking at the clock, I think our "tourists" are the enemy!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Bell：</span><br>
You might be right... If we hadn't snapped out of it, that might have been the end for our base here!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Indiana：</span><br>
But we DID snap out of it. The enemy's lost the element of surprise.<br>
Let's give 'em a head-on battle! Don't stop shooting until they're all fish food!<br>
{{折叠面板|内容结束}}

{{折叠面板|标题=The Next Move|选项=4|主框=1|样式=primary|展开=是}}
<br>
The Eagle Union fleet tore through the enemy with overwhelming momentum, coming face-to-face with their leader.<br>
KABOOOM!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Indiana：</span><br>
Heads up! I've sighted their command unit!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Pittsburgh：</span><br>
Come now, reveal your true self to us.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Indiana：</span><br>
All cannons! Fireee!<br>
<br>
KABOOOM!<br>
<span style="color:#ff9b93;">???：</span><br>
......<br>
Heehee...<br>
<br>
The instant before the shell could hit, the being donning a fox mask vanished in a cloud of pink smoke, leaving not a trace.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Bell：</span><br>
She disappeared! How?!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Pittsburgh：</span><br>
We're not dealing with any regular old Pawn here.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Herring：</span><br>
A META, then? Or a new kind of Siren?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Fargo：</span><br>
It seems our "visitor" was going to be someone known as "Amagi."<br>
Does anyone have any information on this person?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Indiana：</span><br>
Nope. There's no one named Amagi among the Sakura Empire's current leadership.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Herring：</span><br>
Yeah, sorry, I don't do politics or whatever so...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Pittsburgh：</span><br>
Aren't you our local Sakuran expert, Bell? Do you know anything?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Bell：</span><br>
I mean, I only watch their movies and read their manga... I've never heard of anyone named "Amagi."<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Indiana：</span><br>
Guess we'll have to reestablish contact with SD before we can figure out who she is.<br>
Catch your breaths then we'll head out again. We're going to Kiritimati.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Pittsburgh：</span><br>
Why Kiritimati?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Fargo：</span><br>
Their radio equipment is more advanced than what's here. Maybe we can reach another base from there.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Indiana：</span><br>
That's not all. Did any of you notice where those misty things were coming from?<br>
Just from their bearing, chances are pretty high they came from Kiritimati.<br>
If true, that could also mean the fleet stationed there is in some deep shit...<br>
We're the closest allied fleet to them, so we're obliged to assist.<br>
{{折叠面板|内容结束}}

{{折叠面板|标题=Copycat|选项=5|主框=1|样式=primary|展开=是}}
<br>
As the fleet approached Kiritimati, the dark clouds overhead suddenly and instantly cleared.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Pittsburgh：</span><br>
Figures. The weather anomaly ignores the laws of nature. Fargo, what do you see on the island?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Fargo：</span><br>
Nothing abnormal. My recon planes don't see any signs of fighting, or anyone preparing to fight, for that matter.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Indiana：</span><br>
They didn't answer our calls, though.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Fargo：</span><br>
That's true. My confidence index is at 94.75% that the effects of jamming would be eliminated at this close range.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Indiana：</span><br>
Then it's pretty safe to assume they've got it just as bad as we did back on Samoa.<br>
The things we saw with our own eyes, the photos taken by the recon plane, the sea and the sky changing in the blink of an eye – it all points to this place being affected by the illusion.<br>
If Shimanto didn't wake up the people stationed here, there's a good chance the island's already been taken over.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Herring：</span><br>
Then we gotta get in there and save 'em!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Pittsburgh：</span><br>
Yes, but carefully. We know that the illusion distorts your very perception of the world.<br>
It might paint us as the enemy, like how it tricked us into thinking those enemies were Sakuran tourists.<br>
If it comes to that, we'll just have to stick these talismans to their foreheads.<br>
It worked on us, so it should work on them, right?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Indiana：</span><br>
How do we even get close to them, though? Shimanto used a torii gate portal, and that ain't exactly Eagle Union standard issue.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Herring：</span><br>
Bell? Got any ideas?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Bell：</span><br>
Why do you all keep turning to me? I'm just a girl who likes Sakuran movies and manga!<br>
Actually, wait, I DO remember watching a movie where they made a portal.<br>
They held the tag between their fingers, then threw it forward while shouting something cool. It could work!<br>
<br>
Bell took one of the talismans and placed it between her fingers just as she had seen in the movie.<br>
Amazingly, the talisman began to pulsate with cherry pink light at a set rate, like it was breathing.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Bell：</span><br>
Th-that actually worked! I can't believe it!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Herring：</span><br>
Don't forget to yell something.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Bell：</span><br>
Right, yeah! How about... Sakuran talisman, dispel this dream!<br>
<br>
The talisman turned into a glowing arrow and flew across the water's surface.<br>
It vanished in the air, and in its place appeared a torii gate.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Pittsburgh：</span><br>
So this is how they showed up out of nowhere. I hope they don't mind us copying them.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Indiana：</span><br>
Hell yeah! Good job, Bell!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Bell：</span><br>
Don't thank me, thank Shimanto for giving us these talismans.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Herring：</span><br>
Good job both of you, then. Let's go through the gate and save some peeps!<br>

<br>
Pacific Ocean - Kiritimati<br>
Nearby Waters<br>
Inside the Illusion's Borders<br>
Smoke so thick it blotted out the night sky hung above. Warning sirens rang through the air. From sea to land, everything was ablaze.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Fargo：</span><br>
Judging by the topography, this appears to be the Long Island defense line near NY City.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Bell：</span><br>
NY City? I thought we were going to Kiritimati.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Indiana：</span><br>
Doubt it'd be so simple. We're playing by the illusion's rules. Fargo, can you see anything else?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Fargo：</span><br>
There are supposed to be way more defensive structures ever since the front line was attacked. Those are nowhere to be seen.<br>
If I had to guess, this illusion is a recreation of the day of the attack.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Pittsburgh：</span><br>
That's the day when the Commander, Baltimore, and Victorious pushed back Tester...<br>
Dewey's station was on Kiritimati back then, and she just so happened to be at the defense line.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Herring：</span><br>
Maybe the illusion latches on to past trauma... If so, Dewey is in danger! Not just her, but her whole garrison!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Indiana：</span><br>
Where are they?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Fargo：</span><br>
I'm still looking. Let me expand the search range.<br>
Judging from my latest recon footage... the Sirens have all been wiped out.<br>
No offense to Dewey and her fleet, but they couldn't possibly have fended off all those Sirens by themselves.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Indiana：</span><br>
Yeah, I doubt it. Something's up.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Fargo：</span><br>
Found them! There's a fleet heading to land. I can see Dewey, Halsey Powell, and even Hazelwood.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Bell：</span><br>
Thank god. We should link up with them imme–<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Fargo：</span><br>
Wait. There's a stranger among them, wearing a mask.<br>
That's not all... I see those same quasi-Sakuran mass-produced ships from earlier.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Pittsburgh：</span><br>
Oh no. Those girls have no idea...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Indiana：</span><br>
There's still time. Charge in there and let's save 'em!<br>

<br>
Pacific Ocean - Kiritimati<br>
Eagle Union-Sakura Empire Joint Fleet<br>
Present Time<br>
The motley fleet sailed gently onward through the blazing seas.<br>
The defense line had suffered catastrophic damage following the intense fighting.<br>
Though the shipgirls fought for dear life to try to prevent this, their best simply was not enough.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Hazelwood：</span><br>
Why... How could this happen?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Halsey Powell：</span><br>
We defeated all the Sirens, and still they caused all this damage...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Dewey：</span><br>
The line fell all because of us... We were weak...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Amagi：</span><br>
No, that's not true. It wasn't your fault.<br>
There were so many of them, and so few of you. As important as this line of defense is, you could've never protected it alone.<br>
You not only survived the battle, you even repelled the first attack. You should be commended for that.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Dewey：</span><br>
Thank you... Thank you, Amagi.<br>
And thank you for helping us. Without you, we'd be on the bottom of the sea by now!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Amagi：</span><br>
You're welcome. My conscience wouldn't let me stand by and leave an ally to their fate.<br>
You know, this wouldn't have happened if you had more support. Instead, your higher-ups rerouted forces away from here.<br>
I saw the writing on the wall and came here, hoping to resolve your manpower shortage... Alas, I was too late.<br>
The Sirens' next attack could come at any minute. We should leave as soon as possible. Come with me and we'll retreat inland.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Communicator：</span><br>
BEEP BEEP!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Indiana：</span><br>
This is Indiana. Dewey, what's your status?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Dewey：</span><br>
I-Indiana? Why are you here?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Indiana：</span><br>
What do you think? To save your asses! Pittsburgh, Fargo, Herring, and Bell are here with me.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Dewey：</span><br>
We're glad you came for us, but I'm afraid it's too late...<br>
Although we managed to push back the first wave of Sirens, the defense line has been utterly destroyed.<br>
Worse yet, we're unable to reach anyone nearby. You're the only ones who have come to help.<br>
You shouldn't stick around! The Siren command unit has yet to show itself, so their next attack could come at any second!<br>
We're going to pull back with the Sakuran delegation. You should come with us.<br>
We need to retreat and regroup, then we can mount a new defense!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Indiana：</span><br>
What was that? You're gonna retreat?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Dewey：</span><br>
Affirmative! I hate to admit it, but we are woefully unprepared to fend off another assault at the moment.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Amagi：</span><br>
The Sirens are going all-out. This line is only one of the many, many fortifications around the Eagle Union that they're attacking.<br>
To think that the capital fleets are so far away at such a crucial moment...<br>
Regardless, staying here is foolish. Retreating and conserving your strength is your best option.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Pittsburgh：</span><br>
Nobody asked for your advice, "Amagi."<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Indiana：</span><br>
Yeah. Keep it to yourself, you manipulative monster.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Dewey：</span><br>
M-monster? But she saved our lives!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Indiana：</span><br>
No. Listen up, Dewey. None of what she did for you is real.<br>
This is a dream – an illusion she conjured up to exploit your weakness!<br>
My fleet wasn't there when the line was attacked, but we looked into what happened after the fact.<br>
The Sirens caught you off-guard. They caused serious damage to the line. That's all true...<br>
But that's not the whole story, is it?<br>
The Sirens sent a huge force at you, but you stood your ground, fighting until the end. None of you even thought about giving up.<br>
Despite having no backup, despite the huge gap in strength, you held the line – with the aid of one person in particular!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Dewey：</span><br>
One person? Wait...<br>
Farragut-class destroyer, Dewey, reporting for duty!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Aylwin：</span><br>
I'm another Farragut-class destroyer, Aylwin. Reporting for duty.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Victorious：</span><br>
Are you two from the defense line?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Dewey：</span><br>
Yes we are, Miss Victorious.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Baltimore：</span><br>
What about the others?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Dewey：</span><br>
The diversion force managed to draw the Sirens' attention away, giving us the opportunity to retreat with the wounded. But after that...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Aylwin：</span><br>
We'd like to check back with the others, but the Siren fleet is blocking the way back.<br>
It's too much for just us to handle...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Dewey：</span><br>
B-but... as long as you're here, Commander, you'll think of something, right?<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Yeah. It'll be fine.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Baltimore：</span><br>
Don't worry. You've done well. With the Commander's help, we'll get through this.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Victorious：</span><br>
The goddess of victory is with you! We'll keep you two safe – just stay behind us!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Dewey：</span><br>
V-Victorious! We received a transmission from Juneau and Birmingham, informing us that they made contact with an elite Siren!<br>
Commander, we should go save them!<br>
I remember now! The Commander fought with us and we WON that day!<br>
No Sakuran delegation came by back then, either!<br>
But then... Who are you?!<br>
<span style="color:#ff9b93;">Amagi：</span><br>
Heheh. So you've opened your eyes.<br>
Even with outside help, I didn't think you'd wake up so quickly... Memories can be powerful things, I suppose.<br>
This is interesting. VERY interesting.<br>
Now that you've awoken, enjoy your perpetual stay.<br>
<br>
The moment her fake identity was stripped away, the masked person laid bare her rigging while black mist coiled up around her body.<br>
The similarly sinister mass-produced ships, too, began radiating a foreboding aura the very next moment.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Dewey：</span><br>
O-oh no!<br>
<br>
Gone was the warm embrace of safety the dream gave them, replaced entirely with a bursting lust for blood.<br>
All of a sudden, a torii gate appeared in the sky with a flash of pinkish light. Their savior leaped out from it.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Indiana：</span><br>
Leave!<br>
Our!<br>
DESTROYERS!<br>
ALOOOONE!<br>
<br>
Relentless cannon fire rained down upon the mass-produced ships, forcing the masked figure to back off.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Dewey：</span><br>
What?!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Halsey Powell：</span><br>
Did she just jump out of the sky?!<br>
That's SO COOL!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Indiana：</span><br>
If you've got something to say, say it to me, monster.<br>
Girls! The wolf in sheep's clothing has shown her true colors! Let's kick her ass then get the hell out of here!<br>

<br>
The masked figure didn't put up too much of a struggle, as the arrival of Indiana's fleet caught her by surprise.<br>
She fought back merely for form's sake for a while, ultimately disappearing in a pinkish mist just like last time.<br>
With their command unit now gone, the rest of her fleet quickly fell into chaos and was disposed of. The illusion's grip on the island disappeared.<br>
By the time the shipgirls returned to Kiritimati, it was already evening.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Dewey：</span><br>
We're back to Kiritimati! Gosh, that was TOO realistic for just a dream...<br>
We're sorry we failed you like this – by falling for the illusion...<br>
If you hadn't been here, I fear we wouldn't have survived.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Indiana：</span><br>
Don't feel bad about it. You fought valiantly against an extremely cunning enemy.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Pittsburgh：</span><br>
Truth be told, we also fell for the illusion and had to be saved. In our case, it was Shimanto and Harutsuki.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Herring：</span><br>
Those two were the real deal. Not like that fake fox lady.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Dewey：</span><br>
The Sakurans saved you? Why were they in Samoa?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Indiana：</span><br>
They were also attacked by an unidentified enemy, just like we were.<br>
Also, the enemy disguises themselves as Sakurans, so they wanted to get to us first before any misunderstandings could happen.<br>
Worst-case scenario, the whole Pacific has fallen for this illusion... but as long as we can keep fighting, things'll be okay.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Dewey：</span><br>
I hope so!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Halsey Powell：</span><br>
Oh, I've got a question!<br>
You used some cool portal thingy to get here, right? What was that?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Indiana：</span><br>
Hahahah! That was a torii gate made with a special talisman Shimanto gave us. They're for getting inside these illusory dimensions.<br>
And also for removing the effect the illusion has on your mind. We didn't even need to this time, though.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Herring：</span><br>
Oh yeah! We didn't even use 'em.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Bell：</span><br>
I didn't really do anything "cool," I just copied what I saw in a movie once...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Fargo：</span><br>
If you'll excuse me for butting in, I've finished reconning the area.<br>
I'll cut to the chase. Most of the automated production facilities have fallen into enemy hands.<br>
Also, as far as I can see, they're using Kiritimati as their base of operations to dispatch forces to other islands across the Pacific.<br>
I estimate there's a 99.95% chance the fleet that attacked Samoa came from here.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Indiana：</span><br>
Then they're running a coordinated operation here. We can't let them just walk all over us.<br>
Dewey, you're coming with me. We'll recapture the island's command facilities and get in touch with HQ.<br>
If anything gets in our way, we'll smash it!<br>

<br>
Kiritimati<br>
Command & Communications Facility<br>
Sometime Later<br>
In the end, the superior communications equipment on Kiritimati still couldn't connect them to their base at SD.<br>
But, luckily for the girls, they received a call from a surprising person.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Enterprise：</span><br>
This is Enterprise, flagship of the Pacific Fleet.<br>
I thought we'd completely lost Kiritimati... Thank god you're still alive and kicking.<br>
Whoever's in command, could you brief me on the current situation?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Pittsburgh：</span><br>
Enterprise?!<br>
Ahh, you're okay... That's such a relief.<br>
Well, to make a long story short...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Enterprise：</span><br>
I see. Not even Samoa was safe from the illusion.<br>
You handled the situation well.<br>
We sortied as soon as we realized that Kiritimati was on the brink of falling. En route to your location as we speak.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Indiana：</span><br>
Any idea what's happening in the Pacific? Do you know who the enemy is, or what's happened to our SD base?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Enterprise：</span><br>
I don't know a thing, sorry. I was hoping you did.<br>
All I can tell you is that there's jamming all across the entire Pacific and that all of our bases have been affected by the illusion.<br>
It's not limited to the Pacific, though. It's affecting our SD base, NY City, and even DC. We can't reach any of them.<br>
While it's possible that's just due to the jamming, I think we should assume the worst case has come to be.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Pittsburgh：</span><br>
My god...<br>
Did the illusion affect you, too? And you escaped it?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Enterprise：</span><br>
Yeah. I had a dream about...<br>
<br>
Flames. Flames as far as the eye can see.<br>
Among the inferno – a stranger, yet familiar all the same...<br>
<span style="color:#ffc960;">Enterprise·META：</span><br>
Come to have a chat, huh?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Enterprise：</span><br>
No... There are still things I must do. I don't have any time to waste.<br>
<span style="color:#ffc960;">Enterprise·META：</span><br>
Hmph. Okay.<br>
Leave. It's time to wake up.<br>
<br>
The woman shook her hand, enveloping everything in flames.<br>
Just like that, the illusion was broken.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Enterprise：</span><br>
Actually, it's not important.<br>
What matters is that the illusion isn't unbreakable. We're all awake and trying to win this battle.<br>
There have to be others. In DC, NY... There must be other people who've awoken.<br>
For now, we just have to do what we can and have faith in our comrades.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Indiana：</span><br>
Agreed.<br>
I'm transferring command to you. What's our plan now?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Enterprise：</span><br>
As we've established, contact has been lost with practically every base we have in the Pacific.<br>
That includes the bases at PH and AF.<br>
They have massive amounts of supplies and equipment, and plenty of personnel, too, but I've heard nothing from them.<br>
If those two bases fall into enemy hands, the situation will get much more difficult for us.<br>
Our top priority should be to help those we can and build up the forces necessary to recapture those two bases.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Indiana：</span><br>
Understood.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Enterprise：</span><br>
Bunker Hill and some others are currently engaging the enemy. They came from the base on the Marshall Islands.<br>
I suspected it was a Sakuran surprise attack on account of their looks, but I've completely eliminated that possibility thanks to the intel you just provided.<br>
I've forwarded the intel to Bunker Hill and given her orders not to provoke any Sakuran bases.<br>
Until we recapture PH and AF, we're stuck playing defense.<br>
Fortunately, you bought us a lot of time by retaking Kiritimati. You might even have saved our rears.<br>
Once we've verified that all our bases have survived, we'll focus on waking up as many people as–<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Indiana：</span><br>
Let me stop you there. I agree that waking people up is high on our to-do list...<br>
But the enemy has a huge upper hand on us, AND we can't contact anyone. Spreading our forces too thin is way too dangerous.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Enterprise：</span><br>
I know. My plan accounts for that.<br>
We're not going to split up. We'll just send out aircraft to awaken people.<br>
The planes can use one of those talismans to create an entrance into the illusion, drop another one to awaken someone, then strike at the enemy when possible. How does that sound?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Pittsburgh：</span><br>
Yeah... that's easier said than done. It'd take inhuman precision to drop a talisman right onto someone's forehead.<br>
I think a more effective approach would be to contact those under the illusion directly, like we did with Dewey's group.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Enterprise：</span><br>
True. That's not an easy drop to make...<br>
Not many options, then. We'll just have to spread out as little as possible while carrying out our objectives by order of priority.<br>
Even then, there's the risk the enemy will detect us and eliminate our isolated rescue fleets...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Fargo：</span><br>
If all we need to do is reach out to them, my drones are more than enough for the job.<br>
My Fargo Direct Drones can airdrop packages of talismans and can even play audio.<br>
Our aircraft can concentrate on escorting our forces and eliminating stragglers. My drones will handle the rest.<br>
This affords us greater operational precision while we rescue people at the same time.<br>
Using their onboard equipment, the drones can also enhance our communications, facilitating intel exchange and letting us relay tasks and orders.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Enterprise：</span><br>
A combination of drones and aircraft working in tandem... It's worth a shot.<br>
Alright. Our aircraft will deal with any enemies we come across.<br>
Once you're ready, we'll set off for PH and AF.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Indiana：</span><br>
Got it. Let's give those bastards hell!<br>
<br>
Amid the sunset glow, a girl performed her final checks surrounded by drones.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Fargo：</span><br>
Destination: Base at SD. Changing voice pack to NINJABELL. Setup complete.<br>
<br>
She placed a talisman inside the drone's storage compartment, and then it took off, getting in formation with the aircraft.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Fargo：</span><br>
Next. Destination: Base at Panama Canal. Changing voice pack to NINJABELL. Setup complete.<br>
Next. Destination: Easter Island...<br>
<br>
One after the next, the drones take to the skies and link up with the aircraft, their wings carrying both cargo and hope.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Fargo：</span><br>
If this goes well, it will turn this whole thing around.<br>

{{折叠面板|标题=The Fighting Lady, Lost at Sea|选项=10|主框=1|样式=primary|展开=是}}
<br>
Somewhere, in the waters around the base at SD...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Hornet II：</span><br>
Hey, Yorktown, we JUST passed through this area!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Yorktown II：</span><br>
You're right...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Northampton II：</span><br>
The GPS says we should've arrived at the base long ago...<br>
And yet, I can't even see land on the horizon. Do you think the GPS is malfunctioning?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Houston II：</span><br>
Could be... It was working fine until we got close to the base.<br>
Wait, maybe it's not the GPS, maybe it's this particular area that's acting up?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Kearsarge：</span><br>
Are you saying that we've entered a Mirror Sea?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Houston II：</span><br>
That's exactly what I'm saying! I can't get in contact with DC and the Sea of Stars, either!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Hammann II：</span><br>
A Mirror Sea THIS close to the base?! That's a big, BIG problem!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Hornet II：</span><br>
Yeah, no kidding. But if we're in a Mirror Sea, where are all the enemies?<br>
Look around. Not a plane in the sky, not a ship in the water, not even a blip on the radar. There's nothing.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Houston II：</span><br>
Ugh! Look at that! You jinxed us, Hornet!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Hornet II：</span><br>
What, are you picking something up? Oh, you're right – I see blips on the radar, and they're getting closer!<br>
Yorktown, let's launch our planes and intercept them before...<br>
Wait, cancel that... Apparently, those are allied.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Yorktown II：</span><br>
Yes, mine says the same. What's even stranger is, there are even drones mixed in with the aircraft.<br>
That's really weird. Drones can't fly as fast as an aircraft, so putting them together would slow the formation down.<br>
<br>
The formation flew over the girls' heads and airdropped a package. The next moment, a pink light flashed, and a torii gate appeared in the sky.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Hammann II：</span><br>
Is that Bell's voice? And what the heck is that?! Why's there a gate in the air?!<br>
Look! Those drones and aircraft flew into it!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Houston II：</span><br>
I've got it! We're not the only ones trapped in a Mirror Sea – the base is, too.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Hornet II：</span><br>
That explains why we can't reach 'em. But if we're both in the same Mirror Sea, why can't we reach them no matter where we go?<br>
Well, I guess there are Mirror Seas that utilize that fog that bends the laws of physics...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Northampton II：</span><br>
I've read some documents that described a Mirror Sea similar to this – a locked Mirror Sea.<br>
It works like Iron Blood's Floating Fortress. You can only access the Fortress itself through some specific method.<br>
If you don't know what it is, you'll either wander around aimlessly forever, or just casually come out the other side of the Mirror Sea.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Hornet II：</span><br>
That reminds me a bit of the space surrounding a Siren's mainframe. Works kinda like that...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Northampton II：</span><br>
I see where you're coming from, even if those ones are WAY more intricate.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Yorktown II：</span><br>
If I understood that right, then we're only at the border of the Mirror Sea while the base is locked deeper inside, yes?<br>
Presumably, that Sakuran gate is the "specific method" Northampton just mentioned.<br>
Speaking of that gate, it's still just sitting there...<br>
Hornet, Kearsarge, let's all use our aircraft to get inside!<br>

<br>
Easter Island<br>
Merkurialand<br>
The Eternal Paradise (Placeholder Name)<br>
Life in Paradise is peaceful, joyful – a beautiful dream that never ends.<br>
Pamiat' Merkuria META was walking down the beach when she saw some fellow dreamers. She waved at them.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Kimberly：</span><br>
Morning, Pamiat'. Nice weather we're having today.<br>
<span style="color:#ffc960;">Pamiat' Merkuria META：</span><br>
The weather's ALWAYS nice! You gotta love it.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Kimberly：</span><br>
Yeah. It's great.<br>
<span style="color:#ffc960;">Pamiat' Merkuria META：</span><br>
Where are you two going?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Mullany：</span><br>
We're on a patrol.<br>
<span style="color:#ffc960;">Pamiat' Merkuria META：</span><br>
Again? I already told you, this place is as peaceful as can be. There are no fights, no wars, no quarrels.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Stephen Potter：</span><br>
Sure, but only IN Paradise. We still gotta keep a lookout for threats from the outside. This place is small, and the world is big.<br>
<span style="color:#ffc960;">Pamiat' Merkuria META：</span><br>
You do have a point...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Kimberly：</span><br>
Also, sitting around all day isn't good for you.<br>
<span style="color:#ffc960;">Pamiat' Merkuria META：</span><br>
Alright, alright! Go on your patrol or whatever! You won't find anything!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Kimberly：</span><br>
You're right. We won't find anything.<br>
<br>
Pamiat' bid farewell to the girls. With a flick of the wrist, she materialized a bench on the beach.<br>
<span style="color:#ffc960;">Pamiat' Merkuria META：</span><br>
Phew... I really thought it had hit the fan when I heard those sirens go off.<br>
So much for Amagi and her fleet...<br>
What a big letdown that was.<br>
On the other hand, she did help me out, so I'll look the other way this time.<br>
And I regained a lot of my strength after she reconfigured my illusory boundary, and provided me with a temporary base to produce all kinds of handy stuff.<br>
Most of all, I got to enjoy a vacation! On the whole, everything went perfectly!<br>
Maybe this is a sign my bad luck in test site beta is running out.<br>
Ahh, this is the dream right here...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">PA System：</span><br>
*sirens blaring*<br>
<span style="color:#ffc960;">Pamiat' Merkuria META：</span><br>
...Hm?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Communicator：</span><br>
BEEP BEEP!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Kimberly：</span><br>
Pamiat'! Do you read me? An enemy has invaded!<br>
<span style="color:#ffc960;">Pamiat' Merkuria META：</span><br>
You've got to be kidding me!<br>
Stay where you are! I'll deal with them myself!<br>
Seems the mastermind has finally sprung into action...<br>
That means this dream is about to end, then.<br>
My beautiful dream... You will suffer for taking it away from me.<br>
ALHY AOLT HWHYA<br>
<br>
At Pamiat's beckon, hundreds upon hundreds of white tentacles appeared from under the water. They engulfed the encroaching black mist fleet in an instant.<br>
<span style="color:#ffc960;">Pamiat' Merkuria META：</span><br>
Consider this a gift from me.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Communicator：</span><br>
BEEP BEEP!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Kimberly：</span><br>
Holy cow! You took them all out just like that!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Mullany：</span><br>
Wow...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Stephen Potter：</span><br>
You should teach me how to do that sometime.<br>
<span style="color:#ffc960;">Pamiat' Merkuria META：</span><br>
Sometime? I suppose I will, if there ever is a next time.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Kimberly：</span><br>
What do you mean? Are you leaving or something?<br>
<span style="color:#ffc960;">Pamiat' Merkuria META：</span><br>
Yeah. This means goodbye.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Mullany：</span><br>
What? Why now of–<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Communicator：</span><br>
......<br>
<br>
Pamiat' hung up and stared into the distant sky.<br>
On the horizon, she saw a formation of drones and aircraft, flying toward the boundary of her paradise.<br>
<span style="color:#ffc960;">Pamiat' Merkuria META：</span><br>
This is so we won't meet again.<br>

Panama Canal Fortification<br>
Sometime Later<br>
With the help of the drones and aircraft infiltrating through a torii gate, the shipgirls stationed at Panama Canal managed to awaken from the dream.<br>
The utopian mirage vanished into thin air and reality presented itself to them once more.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Intrepid：</span><br>
My head is still spinning...<br>
I can't believe we were dreaming all this time.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Casablanca：</span><br>
We were completely clueless, from the start to the end...<br>
Well, I've finished surveying the air. Everything looks normal. What about inside our facilities?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Cooper：</span><br>
I just got done inspecting those. No abnormal data logs or anything!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Bluegill：</span><br>
And I'm done searching under the surface. Nothing to report!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Intrepid：</span><br>
Phew... That's a relief. It would've been a disaster if the enemy had attacked while we were daydreaming.<br>
I still feel pissed about falling for it in the first place! They made laughing stock of us!<br>
When I find out who did this, they're in for a world of pain!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Communicator：</span><br>
BEEP BEEP!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Kimberly：</span><br>
This is Kiritimati communication station. Panama Canal, do you copy?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Intrepid：</span><br>
This is Intrepid. I hear you loud and clear. Did you make it out alright?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Kimberly：</span><br>
Yeah. We woke up from our dream with the help of Enterprise and Fargo.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Intrepid：</span><br>
Really? Same with us. On another note, do you have any intel on the enemy?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Kimberly：</span><br>
Well... I guess you could call it that.<br>
It's about Pamiat' Merkuria META.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Intrepid：</span><br>
This is bad news...<br>
If she really is heading to Antarctica, she's definitely gonna try to cause another superimposition event!<br>
Just when our hands are tied and we can't reroute any forces to Antarctica, too...<br>
Wait, I've got it!<br>
Fargo's drones must have a receiver antenna. Fargo, do you copy?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Fargo：</span><br>
I hear you, Panama Canal. How can I help you?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Intrepid：</span><br>
I was just wondering – what will you do with the drones and planes you sent to us? Gonna take them back already?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Fargo：</span><br>
They've completed their mission there, so yes, I'm bringing them back to save on fuel.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Intrepid：</span><br>
Understandable. Do you have any more of those Sakuran talismans?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Fargo：</span><br>
I have some to spare, yes.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Intrepid：</span><br>
Fantastic. I was hoping you could send some to the base at Tierra del Fuego, pronto!<br>
If you want to save fuel, you can just bring your aircraft back and we'll top off the drones. I'll escort the drones to the South Atlantic with my own planes.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Fargo：</span><br>
Let me discuss the idea with Enterprise first.<br>
I'm back. Enterprise approved the route change.<br>
This is an extensive crisis, and the Eagle Union can't possibly deal with it alone.<br>
That being the case, I sent out another formation to the Royal Navy's fleet stationed over in Sydney.<br>
If you can, tell the fleets in the South Atlantic to stand by until the Royal Navy has a grasp on the situation.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Intrepid：</span><br>

Eagle Union - DC<br>
Lexington Estate<br>
July 26th<br>
Bags of groceries stood at the entrance to the residence, brimming with goods eager to be part of the feast being held at the mansion that night.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Lexington：</span><br>
Sara, you really went overboard this time.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Saratoga：</span><br>
Maybe a little, but it's warranted. I invited tooons of people tonight! Enterprise, Hornet – everyone, basically!<br>
We can't cheap out when we're throwing such a big party, right?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Lexington：</span><br>
Heehee. That's true. We should go big with it since for once all our vacation days conveniently overlap.<br>
I'll let you do the sorting. I'll do one last round of cleaning, then we'll start making the food.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Saratoga：</span><br>
Sure thing!<br>
<br>
Lexington went into the living room, and for just a brief moment, everything was silent.<br>
<span style="color:#ff9b93;">???：</span><br>
BEEP... BEEP... BEEP...<br>
<br>
There was an ever-so-faint beeping noise. A sound like a cruel clock, ticking down the seconds until death.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Saratoga：</span><br>
It's that sound again...<br>
I wish it would just stop...<br>
<br>
Eagle Union - DC<br>
Golf Course<br>
October 25th<br>
The sun was shining and the skies were clear – the perfect weather for a round of golf.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Saratoga：</span><br>
I heard you've been working really hard at the academy, Lex.<br>
And since hard work deserves to be rewarded, I went and booked out this whole golf course for today!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Lexington：</span><br>
Gosh... I appreciate it, I really do, but isn't this way too big for just two people?<br>
Besides, booking it for the whole day can't have been cheap.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Saratoga：</span><br>
So what? The bigger, the better, I say!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Lexington：</span><br>
Sara.. You're not hiding something from me, are you?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Saratoga：</span><br>
Huh? What do you mean? I've got nothing TO hide!<br>
Look at this big smile on my face! This is the face I make when nothing in the whole world is bothering me!<br>
If you want my advice, you should concentrate on your swings, or your little sister's gonna win easy-peasy!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Lexington：</span><br>
My, those are big words, coming from you!<br>
But big words don't win matches, skill does – and you're going to witness mine.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Saratoga：</span><br>
That's more like it. What do you say we have a quick warmup, then get right to it?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Lexington：</span><br>
Sounds good. I'll be right back.<br>
<br>
Lexington walked away. For a passing, lonesome moment, the golf course was silent.<br>
<span style="color:#ff9b93;">???：</span><br>
BEEP... BEEP... BEEP...<br>
<br>
There was an ever-so-faint beeping noise. A sound like a cruel clock, ticking down the seconds until death.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Saratoga：</span><br>
No, please, I'm begging you...<br>
Make it stop...<br>
<br>
Eagle Union - DC<br>
Shopping District<br>
December 24th<br>
Holiday songs echoed through the streets while neon lights and ribbons painted facades, street lights, and windows in the colors of Christmas.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Saratoga：</span><br>
Wow, look at all these stores offering Christmas deals and events! My wallet's gonna hate me for this, but who cares!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Lexington：</span><br>
There really is a lot. Haven't you already bought enough for today, though?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Saratoga：</span><br>
No way! We've still got three blocks of stores to look at!<br>
Besides, that Sakuran delegation is coming tomorrow, remember? We need to have gifts ready!<br>
I've heard a lot about Amagi before. Honestly, I've always wanted to meet her!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Lexington：</span><br>
Right. Amagi. With the Sakuran delegation...<br>
If you'll indulge me... Do you really think she's coming?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Saratoga：</span><br>
Yes? We've been planning this for quite a while. It'd be omega rude to cancel at the last minute.<br>
Why are you asking that out of nowhere?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Lexington：</span><br>
Oh, no reason. I'm just so happy that it feels like I'm dreaming. Like this is all too good to be real.<br>
Do you feel anything like that? At all?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Saratoga：</span><br>
L-Lex, come on... Don't ruin the mood...<br>
There's no such thing as "real" or "fake" happiness.<br>
As long as we're happy and the Commander is here with us, what more could you want?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Lexington：</span><br>
Sara... I know something has been weighing heavily on you these past few days.<br>
I'm your sister. I can tell when you're not telling me something.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Saratoga：</span><br>
That's enough spoiling the mood, okay? It's almost Christmas, so let's enjoy ourselves instead!<br>
Hey, look, that's the Colorado sisters! Let's see what they bought!<br>
Maryland! Colorado! West Virginia! Hiii!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Maryland：</span><br>
Well, if it ain't Lex and Sara! Out doing your Christmas shopping too, eh?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Saratoga：</span><br>
Yup-yup! We're shopping our hearts out.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Maryland：</span><br>
Ahahahah! Good to hear it. We've still got places to check out, so we'll catch up with you later! Merry Christmas!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Saratoga：</span><br>
Merry Christmas! Have fun!<br>
See, Lex? Christmas is all about fun.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Lexington：</span><br>
Maryland, Colorado, and West Virginia...<br>
If the report I read was right, they were reassigned to DC's defense fleet to reward their stellar performance while serving at PH.<br>
Is that really true?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Saratoga：</span><br>
What? Of course it's–<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Lexington：</span><br>
Sara. Look me in the eyes.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Saratoga：</span><br>
D-do I have to?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Lexington：</span><br>
Yes. Listen to your heart and answer me.<br>
Is that REALLY what happened?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Saratoga：</span><br>
......<br>
No. It's not.<br>
They... They were reassigned to PH not long before that Reenactment happened, and they were caught up in it.<br>
They fought tooth and nail, but still sustained crippling injuries.<br>
They spent a long time in recovery, but their wounds were too severe. In the end, they were mothballed.<br>
Then there came a breakthrough in retrofitting technology that let their riggings be rebuilt. It wasn't until recently that they finally returned to the front lines and were assigned to posts across the country...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Lexington：</span><br>
What about Yorktown? We threw a party with her not long ago.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Saratoga：</span><br>
Yorktown's hull became corroded after the Reenactment at AF. Her prospects of recovery have always been bleak.<br>
That is, until the Commander used Type II technology to miraculously bring her back to full health.<br>
She's finished her rehabilitation program at the Sea of Stars and should be back in fighting order.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Lexington：</span><br>
Okay... And what about me?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Saratoga：</span><br>
Just... Just stop it with these questions, please.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">???：</span><br>
BEEP... BEEP... BEEP...<br>
<br>
The beeping was loud and clear.<br>
It sounded even colder and crueler than usual.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Lexington：</span><br>
What has become of me?<br>
Am I leading a happy life together with you, far away from the front lines?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Saratoga：</span><br>
Shouldn't we all? What's wrong with being happy?!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Lexington：</span><br>
Calm down, Sara. Answer me.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Saratoga：</span><br>
Lexington... You...<br>
You suffered severe corrosion damage in the Reenactment at the Coral Sea.<br>
You haven't made any recovery from your injuries, and there's still no known way to cure you...<br>
To this day you're still resting in a care pod in the Sea of Stars...<br>
It's not fair...<br>
*sniffle*... They all recovered one way or another... but you're still sick...<br>
Why? Why won't you come back to me?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Lexington：</span><br>
I don't know why.<br>
All I know is that you can't stay here forever.<br>
All dreams must come to an end.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Saratoga：</span><br>
But...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Lexington：</span><br>
Open your eyes, Sara.<br>
Your friends need you. They need you with them in reality. The Commander is waiting for you, too.<br>
I'm sure you already know that.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Saratoga：</span><br>
Yes, I know...<br>
I know it perfectly well...<br>
I know what I have to do. I have to keep fighting.<br>
As long as I keep fighting, one day, things will change...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Care Pod：</span><br>
BEEP... BEEP... BEEP...<br>
<br>
There was a barely audible beeping noise. Steady and cold, like the waves of a dead sea lapping against a barren beach.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Saratoga：</span><br>
I'm going to leave now, Lex.<br>
You're right about everything. There are people in the real world that need me.<br>
TB, do you copy?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">TB ：</span><br>
This is TB. Awaiting orders.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Saratoga：</span><br>
Great! I'm gonna head to the control room. Find out what's happening in the Sea of Stars meanwhile.<br>
We're going to start fighting back.<br>

<br>
Dragon Empery - Base at BP<br>
Command Building<br>
Commander's Office<br>
The Dragon Empery's plan is to destroy the Storm. As such, they've codenamed their operation, "Wind-Crushing Ice Dragon."<br>
This operation has been in the works for a long time. The chain of command across all of the Empery are now performing the final preparations.<br>
That includes me, the one who'll lead the fleet.<br>
There's one thing I've been hung up on, however.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
(As far as the briefing says, even though the Storm has grown in intensity, the Empery has the strength to snuff it out.)<br>
(If they succeed, they'll finally regain direct access to the sea.)<br>
(But, my bad feeling from earlier proved right. The Pacific has fallen into chaos.)<br>
(The Empery might get caught in the crossfire if they proceed with the operation, not knowing any better.)<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Memphis：</span><br>
Since the storm has picked up, it's basically impossible to get info on what's happening beyond the Empery's borders.<br>
At least thanks to you, we've made contact with the Northern Parliament's base at Karaginsky Island.<br>
Speaking of which, I have Sovetsky Soyuz on the line. She wants to talk to you.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Soyuz? What's she doing in the Pacific?<br>
Patch me through to her.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Sovetsky Soyuz：</span><br>
It's a relief to see you're okay, Comrade Commander.<br>
I wasn't expecting us to meet again under these circumstances, but here we are.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
What are you doing all the way out here? Did something happen back home?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Sovetsky Soyuz：</span><br>
Well, I'm sure you're already aware of the illusion that has struck Europa.<br>
All across Europa, regions of space capable of causing widespread, mass delusions have appeared.<br>
These spaces are growing in size, but fortunately, those who've snapped out of the illusion are able to emerge by themselves, to an extent.<br>
However, since their growth cannot be stopped, we've relocated our chain of command to this side of the planet.<br>
We've issued commands for all our fleets to relocate as well, but we were slightly too late. Only approximately 50% of our forces made the move in time.<br>
Luckily, some of our assets and shipgirls are outside the range of these spaces – those being our Arctic fleet, blueprint ships, and our research teams.<br>
On the whole, I would argue the Northern Parliament still has the crisis under control.<br>
Rest assured, we will mount a counterattack as soon as our investigation into these spaces is complete.<br>
Additionally, I have something else to relay to you.<br>
Yat Sen told me that you want to know what's happening across the Pacific.<br>
The Northern Parliament is willing to share what information it has.<br>
According to our defense fleet stationed on the Aleutian Islands, there is currently fighting taking place all across the Pacific.<br>
The Sakura Empire is on the offensive, while the Eagle Union has a fleet moving toward the Marshall Islands.<br>
Our intel also claims that the Sakurans have already entered battle on the Solomon Islands and the Marshall Islands.<br>
As you can imagine, it's not so straightforward.<br>
Meanwhile, in the Eagle Union, all contact was lost with DC and the bases at SD and NY at nearly the same time as the illusory spaces appeared.<br>
Considering what's happening in Europa, it's safe to assume the Eagle Union has been similarly affected by illusions.<br>
I'm afraid I can't send forces directly to the Pacific to verify this information since the situation is complicated as it is.<br>
Still, I hope this intel may be of some use to you.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Thanks, Soyuz. It helps a lot.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Sovetsky Soyuz：</span><br>
You're welcome. I hope your operation will be a success.<br>
<br>
I hang up the line and start processing the information she just gave me.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
(She said it's under control, but it's clear they're in crisis mode as much as the rest of us.)<br>
(Still, it's good to know that they're more or less okay.)<br>
(On the Eagle Union side, I know Enterprise and her peers are out in the Pacific. I know they'll pull through just fine.)<br>
(Based on the last report I got from Europa, Shinano and Clemenceau are trying to create a conceptual weapon to dispel the illusions.)<br>
(While it likely won't solve this crisis in one fell swoop, it can benefit Soyuz if it turns out she needs assistance.)<br>
(Then there's the Sakura Empire... I haven't really gotten any intel on them.)<br>
(They'll have to wait, though. Operation Wind-Crushing Ice Dragon comes first.)<br>
(The Sirens must have noticed that we're gearing up. The fighting is going to be fierce.)<br>
(I'll focus on this operation for now, then take things one at a time.)<br>

<br>
Pacific Ocean<br>
Port of PH<br>
Eagle Union Pacific Fleet<br>
The port of PH was back in business, busier than ever before.<br>
In addition to Enterprise's Pacific Fleet, reinforcements had arrived from all over, including the base at SD and Panama Canal.<br>
They had assembled in the briefing room to analyze the current state of the battle.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Enterprise：</span><br>
All of our bases across the Pacific have been recaptured, including PH, AF, and the Panama Canal.<br>
While there have yet to be any casualties due to the illusions, there have been numerous cases of equipment damage.<br>
Lastly, all garrisoned fleets are currently undergoing necessary repairs and rearming so they can join us on the front lines.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Yorktown II：</span><br>
You recaptured all these bases in this little time? You really pulled off a miracle.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Enterprise：</span><br>
Yeah. I was expecting this to turn into a battle of attrition.<br>
We couldn't have done it so fast without the talismans the Sakurans gave us – and Fargo's ingenuity.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Saratoga：</span><br>
Oh, speaking of the talismans, I have something to report.<br>
I took the talismans Yorktown's fleet retrieved at SD and sent them over to the Sea of Stars.<br>
Incidentally, they've resumed regular operations and are investigating ways to analyze and break the illusions.<br>
If they're successful, we should be able to liberate the places across the country that have fallen under its influence.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Enterprise：</span><br>
Good job, Saratoga. I knew I could count on you.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Saratoga：</span><br>
Heheh! Of course you can!<br>
We'll handle the domestic situation so you all can focus on the front lines. Anyway, uh, that's all I wanted to say. Back to you.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Bunker Hill：</span><br>
The situation on the front lines isn't great. The enemy is applying pressure on us, even if they're advancing at a snail's pace.<br>
Their forces are coming from the direction of the Marshall Islands, and their fleets are growing in size.<br>
At present, we count a total of seven of them, each with a presumed flagship with a total hull length of almost three kilometers.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Hornet II：</span><br>
THREE whole kilometers? I haven't even seen a Siren ship that gargantuan before.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Bunker Hill：</span><br>
Me neither. Worse yet, these ships are equipped with shields and quite good firepower.<br>
Numerous attempts were made to bombard them from the air, but honestly, it had no effect.<br>
We're trying a different approach now – attack with submarines to kill their command unit and send them into disarray.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Constellation：</span><br>
Wait! Bunker Hill, put that attack on hold!<br>
Our analysis of the enemy just yielded its initial results.<br>
Apparently, what we're up against is a kind of corrosion entity.<br>
As for what kind, they partly base themselves off of existing ships in our world, as opposed to being projected into our branch from another.<br>
That's the reason why we were able to partly identify them unlike all others before. It's also why our attacks are more effective against them.<br>
We still don't know HOW they come into existence, though.<br>
What's clear is that, whoever's masterminding this attack, they've reappropriated Sakuran mass-production tech.<br>
Oh, one more thing...<br>
In all our previous encounters, the corrosion entities vanished into thin air when they were destroyed, leaving not a single trace.<br>
These, on the other hand, leave behind metal parts that resemble some sort of mineral ore.<br>
We analyzed a sample and discovered that these parts possess properties that make them corrode other materials.<br>
The good news is, they can't corrode our hulls. They CAN corrode electronics, though.<br>
Which brings me to why you shouldn't attack that flagship...<br>
We haven't analyzed a sample from it yet, but given how much larger it is than its peers, its corrosion properties might also be on a different level.<br>
Meaning, attacking it may create a wreck that corrodes the surrounding water or gets stuck to the submarines attacking it. It's just speculation, but it's better to be safe than sorry.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Bunker Hill：</span><br>
Thanks for all that intel. We'll reconsider the attack.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Indiana：</span><br>
I've got some intel from our observation station in Samoa.<br>
The readings say a fleet has departed from the Solomons and is heading toward the Marshall Islands.<br>
Best-case scenario, the Sakuran fleet stationed there is still affected by the illusion, but they're alive.<br>
Worst-case scenario... they snapped out of it and the enemy wiped them out.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Yorktown II：</span><br>
It's all thanks to Shimanto and Harutsuki that we could wrestle back control so quickly.<br>
If they're in danger, we can't just leave them to their fates.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Saratoga：</span><br>
Of course not! Besides, if the Solomons fall, that's another angle for the enemy to attack from!<br>
We're obliged to help them, both from a strategic and a repaying-our-debt-of-kindness angle!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Enterprise：</span><br>
I agree.<br>
Bunker Hill, keep up the defense. Take it slow and steady.<br>
Gather as much intel as you can on the enemy flagships and find out what they're really after.<br>
After you've helped the Sakurans on the Solomons, head for the Marshall Islands from an angle they won't expect.<br>
We'll then pincer the enemy and take them all out.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Bunker Hill：</span><br>
Roger.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Yorktown II：</span><br>
Enterprise, we've still got forces to spare. Should I reroute them to the Solomons?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Enterprise：</span><br>
Those islands will be fine. Send them to Bunker Hill instead.<br>
Our forces can regroup later if saving the Sakurans doesn't prove too costly, and we can expect reinforcements from Iron Blood's Floating Fortress.<br>
If need be, we can always contact Iron Blood directly.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Yorktown II：</span><br>
Are you sure that's such a good idea? Wouldn't it be best if we spoke to the Royal Navy fleet stationed in Sydney?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Enterprise：</span><br>
They've got their hands full with tracking Pamiat' Merkuria META and preparing themselves in case something sudden happens in the Antarctic Ocean.<br>
If we draw reinforcements from them, they'll be unable to respond to changes in Antarctica.<br>
Iron Blood is our best bet. The Commander made negotiating with them a lot easier.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Yorktown II：</span><br>
Alright. Be careful out there, Enterprise.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Enterprise：</span><br>
You, too.<br>
You have the power of a Type II on your side, but we still haven't figured out who's behind all this. Be ready for anything.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Yorktown II：</span><br>
Heehee. I'll be fine. It's true I haven't fought in a long while, but I still remember how to.<br>
This will be my first battle fighting alongside you all since my return to the front lines. Whoever the enemy commander is, they'll regret earning my fury!<br>

<br>
KABOOOM!<br>
With a loud boom, the foes standing in the Sakurans' way were annihilated, leaving only a few wreckages behind.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Kawakaze：</span><br>
Lady Nagato, this is the same as our last encounter. Exactly as many enemies from exactly the same direction.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Shoukaku：</span><br>
We've been through here several times now. I'm starting to fear we've been thrust behind a different, non-illusory barrier.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Nagato：</span><br>
If it is a barrier, it must have an exploitable weak point. Shimanto is searching for it.<br>
You must all stay close to me, lest you fall for the illusion's misleadings.<br>
<br>
The Sakuran fleet sailed onward through the cherry seas dyed ink black.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Nagato：</span><br>
(I've undone so many anchors, yet the illusion shows no sign of lifting...)<br>
(In fact, the only effect of undoing these anchors seems to be that the illusion shifts and changes.)<br>
(I'd assumed this illusion was like the rest... In reality, have we walked into a prison?)<br>
(Then there's that Amagi... What if she isn't a mere phantom conjured up by the illusion?)<br>
<br>
Nagato racked her brain to recall the crimson figure in a fox mask that passed her by not long ago.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Nagato：</span><br>
(She said something, but I cannot remember what...)<br>
(I did not listen to her when we first crossed paths, presuming that she was only a figment of this illusion.)<br>
(Yet, I followed her when she walked ahead, as it seemed as though she was guiding me...)<br>
(Despite my misgivings, I did discover those anchors along the way.)<br>
(In hindsight, accompanying her was reckless. I allowed her to lure me...)<br>
(Here, to this sea with the Sacred Sakura...)<br>
(Wait... Sacred Sakura... Amagi?)<br>
(That's it! I understand now!)<br>
(THIS is what Mikasa wanted me to investigate!)<br>
(Amagi's lingering soul swirled around the roots of the Sacred Sakura, allowing her consciousness to take form...)<br>
(Moreover, her range of influence far exceeds the barrier that guards the Sacred Sakura...)<br>
(Ordinarily, such a thing would be impossible... unless someone employed an illusion to extend the Sacred Sakura's domain even beyond the Sakura Islands.)<br>
(But how could anyone do such a thing?)<br>
(I thought that the former Great Sage fixed the seal on the Prime Sakura, then Yamato inherited the Watatsumi...)<br>
(Unless... it actually was not Yamato who took over...)<br>
(Is that it? Is that why she tried to warn me?)<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Minazuki：</span><br>
"Heaven's Door will be opened. I beseech you to join us, if possible, Lady Nagato."<br>
"...Lady Nagato."<br>
"Recall Zuikaku posthaste, and keep Shimanto close by your side."<br>
"A fire that will scorch the world is coming."<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Nagato：</span><br>
(A fire that will scorch the world?!)<br>
(How careless I've been... Such a fool I've been!)<br>
(Akagi... Your refusal to let go really is driving you to do unthinkable things.)<br>
(I do empathize. If my sister's hull were damaged and barely able to sustain itself, I would do all in my power to save her.)<br>
(But this? Do you even know who it is that you're trying to revive?)<br>
<br>
KABOOOM!<br>
That very moment, a volley of shells struck Nagato's anti-deception barrier.<br>
Explosions went off on the barrier's surface, sending ripples through it.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Nagato：</span><br>
Urgh!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Kawakaze：</span><br>
Lady Nagato!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Haguro：</span><br>
Son of a... There's no end to them! Where the hell are they coming from?!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Shimanto：</span><br>
Lady Nagato, let me handle this!<br>
You've still yet to fully regain your strength. Pushing yourself is dangerous!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Nagato：</span><br>
No! I shall do this!<br>
You expended too much of your own strength on creating those talismans. If anyone here needs time to recover, it's you!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Kongou：</span><br>
That's more than enough reason for us to evacuate immediately, then! Shimanto, have you found a weak spot in the barrier yet?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Shimanto：</span><br>
I have! Come with me!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Nagato：</span><br>
Halt! Both of you!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Shimanto：</span><br>
Lady Nagato?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Nagato：</span><br>
This illusion does not exist solely to misguide us. The Sacred Sakura over yonder is its core.<br>
That is the very thing that Mikasa sent us here to investigate!<br>
Change course! We will head to the center of the illusion!<br>

<br>
Sakura Empire - Solomon Islands Base<br>
Eagle Union Fleet<br>
Post-Breach Illusion Breach<br>
Having dispatched waves of enemies in their way, Indiana's and Enterprise's fleet then created a torii gate and breached the illusion.<br>
The illusion seen from the inside was like a sprawling forest of cherry blossoms, with a lone, giant, withered tree towering in the distance.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Bell：</span><br>
You know, flowers are a symbol of life...<br>
And yet despite how many there are in here, it just feels so desolate.<br>
Is this really it? The illusion that's trapped our Sakuran friends?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Indiana：</span><br>
I see signs of fighting. They look fresh, too.<br>
Enterprise, you see anything from up above?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Enterprise：</span><br>
More signs of fighting. Loads, even.<br>
That suggests the Sakurans are not just alive, but fighting right this moment.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Pittsburgh：</span><br>
Doesn't anyone else find it strange that they're still trapped in here?<br>
The Sakurans came to US first, so shouldn't they be able to leave on their own?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Fargo：</span><br>
This illusion may be unique – possibly even designed specifically to contain them. Whoever's behind all this is targeting them.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Herring：</span><br>
Targeting them specifically? That sounds bad! Like, REALLY bad for them!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Enterprise：</span><br>
Found them. They're heading toward that massive tree in the middle.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Pittsburgh：</span><br>
Then there's still time! We need to hurry!<br>

<br>
Nagato and her fleet pushed onward, maintaining her protective barrier as they sailed for the Sacred Sakura.<br>
They encountered hardly any opposition along the way, in a clear contrast to when they were trying to break out.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Nagato：</span><br>
(Why the lack of resistance? Are they trying to bring me closer to the Sacred Sakura?)<br>
(For what reason could that be?)<br>
<br>
Unlike the blooming trees all around them, the Sacred Sakura had long since withered.<br>
Nagato gazed up at its branches.<br>
A moment passed. Then, a single red dot appeared on a branch, and suddenly, all the buds blossomed at once.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Amagi：</span><br>
Lady Nagato...<br>
Lady Nagato?<br>
<br>
The clouds parted, and radiant sunlight shone down upon the forest of cherry blossoms.<br>
A gentle voice called out to Nagato again and again. Finally, she came back to her senses.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Nagato：</span><br>
Amagi? But... Where am I?<br>
<br>
She looked around. She was in a guest room, both strangely familiar to her and extravagant in design.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Amagi：</span><br>
You've seemed a bit distracted ever since you came here.<br>
Is there something on your mind?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Nagato：</span><br>
Aye... It feels as though I've had a long dream, and I'm dazed after being so suddenly thrust back to reality.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Amagi：</span><br>
I understand. It's been quite rainy as of late, and anyone would be surprised to see the skies clear out of nowhere.<br>
I know you've been pushing yourself, too. Please take better care of yourself, okay?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Nagato：</span><br>
Very well. Incidentally...<br>
Was it you who guided me to the Sacred Sakura?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Amagi：</span><br>
Pardon? Yes, that was me. Why do you ask? Did you have an unpleasant dream?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Nagato：</span><br>
Dreams are just that – dreams.<br>
Worry not about me. Now, what would you request of me?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Amagi：</span><br>
If you pardon my rudeness, I would like to make a request on behalf of Kaga.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Nagato：</span><br>
Very well. Speak.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Amagi：</span><br>
As you know, the treaty allows any two large capital ships to be converted to aircraft carriers. I seek to rescind the decommissioning of Battleship Kaga based upon the Treaty's demands.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Nagato：</span><br>
Hmm... Amagi, nobody wishes for this outcome...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Amagi：</span><br>
The Treaty is binding once signed, I know. There is no changing fate.<br>
Unless someone takes her place...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Nagato：</span><br>
From the very beginning, the world has never judged who is weak or strong. You are just using that as an excuse to escape from reality.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Amagi：</span><br>
Lady Nagato, you should already know that I am not fit to serve as the flagship of the Combined Fleet. Sooner or later, the role must be entrusted to someone else.<br>
While she may not be up to the task just yet, if you were to pass on the role to Kaga, I would be able to rest easy knowing that I was able to serve the Sakura Empire, even with this flawed body.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Nagato：</span><br>
Is this truly what you desire?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Amagi：</span><br>
Without a doubt. Right now, Kaga is alone in the Mirror Sea due to her despair, but I will personally bring her back.<br>
Should we be able to return safely, I humbly request that you consider my decision, and hold another wargame to see that Kaga can become an aircraft carrier.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Nagato：</span><br>
...No.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Amagi：</span><br>
Lady Nagato?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Nagato：</span><br>
I shan't allow it.<br>
Don't give up now, Amagi. I will fix you, I swear it!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Amagi：</span><br>
"Fix" me? How will you do that?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Nagato：</span><br>
By using the Watatsumi as well as the Sacred Sakura's power.<br>
Though your hull may degrade, your soul – the thing that makes you who you are – can be sustained with the Sacred Sakura.<br>
The Sacred Sakura will be nourished by the Watatsumi's power, and its roots can be connected to the Prime Sakura.<br>
We can create for you a new body, using the Watatsumi as the core.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Amagi：</span><br>
I see your plan... It's exactly the same as hers, isn't it?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Nagato：</span><br>
"Hers"? Whose?<br>
...I see now. What I thought was a dream was reality. THIS is the dream.<br>
<span style="color:#ff9b93;">Amagi：</span><br>
From the very beginning, the world has never judged who is weak or strong. You are just using that as an excuse to escape from reality.<br>
<br>
The crimson figure did not answer. Wordlessly, she placed her fox mask upon her face.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Shimanto：</span><br>
Shikigami serpent, break this illusion!<br>
<br>
The silence between them was broken by a shout from afar.<br>
<span style="color:#ff9b93;">Amagi：</span><br>
It seems our conversation is over.<br>
Lady Nagato, please, turn back. Stay out of this matter.<br>
<br>
With the illusion broken, foes lying in ambush revealed themselves.<br>
They posed little threat to the combined might of the Sakura Empire's and Eagle Union's fleet, however.<br>
Amidst the chaos, the crimson figure once more disappeared.<br>
All that remained – an echo of her hollow sigh in Nagato's ear.<br>
Solomon Islands - Sakura Empire Base<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Pittsburgh：</span><br>
(THAT'S Nagato? Wow, she's pretty dang cute.)<br>
Hey, are you the leader of this fleet?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Nagato：</span><br>
I am Nagato, the guardian fox as well as the former flagship of the Sakura Empire's Combined Fleet.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Pittsburgh：</span><br>
Oops, sorry if that sounded rude. I've heard a lot about you, but I didn't think you'd be so... small.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Kawakaze：</span><br>
How dare you?!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Enterprise：</span><br>
Ahem. Pittsburgh.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Pittsburgh：</span><br>
Right, yeah, I'm going too far. Forgive me.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Enterprise：</span><br>
I'm Enterprise. Flagship of the Eagle Union's Pacific Fleet and currently in charge of operations in and around the Pacific.<br>
It's an honor to meet you, guardian fox.<br>
<br>
And so, the Eagle Union and the Sakura Empire finally met on the Solomon Islands.<br>
With a firm handshake, the Pacific's two most influential factions officially made contact.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Nagato：</span><br>
Enterprise. The Grey Ghost. I've heard about you.<br>
You came to our aid today, and for that, I thank you.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Enterprise：</span><br>
Please, I should be thanking YOU. Your actions saved us.<br>
On behalf of us all... Actually, time is of the essence, so pardon me for cutting to the chase.<br>
According to our intel, the situation is even worse on the Marshall Islands than it is here.<br>
We're going to link up with a capital fleet and launch a pincer attack. Our goal is to break the illusion and help the fleet garrisoned on the island.<br>
Would you be willing to share what your fleet plans to do next?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Nagato：</span><br>
......<br>
(The times are changing...)<br>
(To guard and follow tradition, or embark with the new winds... The choice is already clear to me.)<br>
(Much have I experienced since my awakening under the Sacred Sakura, from meeting the Reborn Combined Fleet, to Akagi and her fierce stubbornness.)<br>
Let me preface by saying that all of this – these illusions, these strange new foes – it all has to do with a plan that Akagi advocates for.<br>
She has taken the Watatsumi and the Sacred Sakura and repurposed them to her own malicious ends. I can tolerate it no longer.<br>
The Sakura Empire is ultimately responsible for this crisis, and you were caught in the middle of it.<br>
For that, I will bear responsibility. My fleet will gladly accompany you and crush this scourge upon our seas.<br>
Once that is done, we'll have to see what comes next.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Enterprise：</span><br>
I couldn't ask for more. I'm just glad I won't need to explain later why our forces were seen within earshot of the Marshall Islands.<br>
With your help, I'm confident this operation will go without a hitch.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Nagato：</span><br>
Aye. Let us form up and disembark for the Marshall Islands!<br>

<br>
From atop her high tower, the true ruler of the Pacific observed the battlefield through her many hidden cameras.<br>
Her gaze slid past the countless lights over the West Pacific and stopped on the East Pacific – on the Dragon Empery.<br>
<span style="color:#ff9b93;">Tester：</span><br>
The situation is deteriorating further.<br>
A staggering amount of the Empery's electricity has been rerouted to one location – the Celestial Tower.<br>
Early observations indicate it's more than 40% of all their electricity, and the number is growing.<br>
I can also see that the whole country has entered level one combat readiness status.<br>
Considering the size of their force, and the fact that the Commander is at the helm, there's a 98% probability that they'll breach through the Storm.<br>
In conclusion, emergency measures must be taken.<br>
Observer's orders are clear – any attempts to destroy the Storm must be stopped until the experiment reaches its next phase.<br>
As a precautionary measure, I'm raising the Storm's intensity from IV to V.<br>
I'll hold them back until they run out of ammunition and can't keep up the assault any longer.<br>
<br>
Tester came to a conclusion and began sending out orders across all her modules.<br>
The modules, however, did not respond to the orders. They remained unresponsive even after seconds passed.<br>
<span style="color:#ff9b93;">Tester：</span><br>
Did my connection time out?<br>
Is somebody jamming the tower of my mainframe?<br>
No... That's impossible...<br>
<br>
In the city of steel that is her mainframe, a single blue dot flickered.<br>
The flicker burst into a dazzling torrent that spread across the entire city.<br>
It faded, becoming a dot once more before disappearing right where it originated.<br>
<span style="color:#ff9b93;">Tester：</span><br>
Orders received.<br>
Canceling original plan to increase Storm's intensity.<br>
Alternate plan received.<br>
Activating Type IV mass-produced ships.<br>
Repositioning units to form defensive line. Engaging enemy units until Storm initiation sequence has completed.<br>
<br>
She issued new sets of orders to her many modules, and this time, they responded.<br>
With a series of electrical signals, construction was begun on the Type IV mass-produced model – massive units that have rarely been seen in test site beta.<br>
The situation was now a powder keg waiting to blow.<br>

Before Operation Wind-Crushing Ice Dragon's Start<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Yat Sen：</span><br>
Together as one! Advance with courage!<br>
The final victory will be ours!<br>
<br>
Yat Sen delivered one last rousing speech.<br>
All the communication lines were dead silent. Every fleet was mustering their courage and waiting for the shot to begin the operation.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ying Swei：</span><br>
Storm Alpha – all monitoring values normal. Storms Beta through Delta – all normal.<br>
Final check complete. The four principal Storm monitoring values are all within normal ranges.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Chao Ho：</span><br>
Hooray! Victory is guaranteed for us as long as the Storm doesn't ramp up!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Huan Ch'ang：</span><br>
Ahem.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Chao Ho：</span><br>
Right, uhh... All units, in position!<br>
853 Dongyu-type arsenal vessels are standing by on the front lines, awaiting orders.<br>
Supply and cargo vessels are also ready to go.<br>
It's estimated that our supplies are sufficient to enable five rounds of saturation attacks, ensuring continuous fleet activity for the next three days.<br>
We've really pulled all the stops for this operation, heheh. The fighters on the front lines are gonna have a heck of a time.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Huan Ch'ang：</span><br>
You could say that again.<br>
(These Dongyu-type ships are equipped with their signature Freezing Rain extended-range cluster rockets.)<br>
(They can be launched en masse in little time, and their payload has a potent temperature-lowing effect on impact.)<br>
(All we need to do is destabilize the Storm's thermodynamic equilibrium and we'll win.)<br>
If our simulations are accurate, four rounds of saturation attacks will be enough to completely destroy the four main storms.<br>
With those four gone, the Storm will no longer stand between us and the sea.<br>
The only real uncertainty is what is happening beyond the Storm.<br>
We do know that Siren activity has increased around the Mariana Islands, thanks to the Northern Parliament's intel.<br>
Some have speculated that their stronghold in that area is, in fact, the source of the Storm.<br>
That theory is all but confirmed now that they've begun amassing at the same time as we did.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Chao Ho：</span><br>
Then we'll just crush them, too!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ying Swei：</span><br>
That will have to come after we take care of the Storm.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Huan Ch'ang：</span><br>
Yes. Taking out the Storm comes first.<br>
Once we do, the Sirens will have a massive army waiting for us. A battle with them is inevitable.<br>
Unfortunately, we'll have to deal with them alone as well. The Northern Parliament can't provide any support.<br>
We will just have to do our best and wait. Comrades, get ready!<br>
<br>
Ships and shipgirls of the Dragon Empery were lined up at the front lines, waiting for the signal to begin.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Memphis：</span><br>
My gosh. I didn't think they were dead serious about taking on the Storm head-on.<br>
Their simulations WERE accurate... but I just can't shake this nervousness inside of me.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
It'll be fine. They've prepared for everything. They just have to follow the first step of the plan.<br>
It's only after that when things get dicey. We have very limited intel on how the Sirens in the Pacific will respond.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Helena：</span><br>
I think we should expect a fierce battle.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Agreed. All units, begin the countdown!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Communicator：</span><br>
Eight... Seven... Six... Five...<br>
Four... Three... Two... One...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Yat Sen：</span><br>
Commence Operation Wind-Crushing Ice Dragon!<br>
<br>
One moment, nothing. The next, hundreds of Dongyu vessels launched their cluster rockets, lighting up the stormy skies.<br>
The Storm trembled under the immense bombardment. It looked like it was even shrinking.<br>
Through the Storm the ice dragon broke, soaring through the air like a rainbow.<br>

Commander, this is the South Sea Storm Analysis Fleet. First round of saturation attack is complete. Target still intact!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Chen Hai：</span><br>
This is the North Sea Storm Analysis Fleet, reporting identical results. First round of attack is finished, but target shows no sign of weakening.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Chi An：</span><br>
East Sea Storm Analysis Fleet here. Completed first round of saturation attack. It did nothing.<br>
That was all our first attacks. Storms Alpha through Delta are all unscathed. Fleets will reload and resupply then initiate second round of attacks.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Understood. When that's done, commence the second round on my command.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Chi An：</span><br>
Roger that. Will begin second round following resupply.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
(This is about what I expected from the first round.)<br>
(It didn't look like it did anything, but the third round should do it. Or the fourth at most.)<br>
<br>
The second round of attacks came. While the Storm itself looked unchanged, the abnormal ambient weather blanketing the area clearly let up somewhat.<br>
Then came the third round. Storms Alpha and Delta, which were already comparatively weak, were struggling even to sustain themselves. Meanwhile, storms Beta and Gamma were starting to weaken.<br>
Finally, the fourth round finished. The seas had turned silent.<br>
The Storm was fading away before everyone's eyes while the unusual weather above, too, cleared.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">An Shan：</span><br>
We did it... We defeated the Storm!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Chi An：</span><br>
Commander, approaching Sirens spotted! They're coming toward us!<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
With the Storm gone, their jamming should be a lot weaker! Send out scouts, recon from the air, and commence a wide-area radar sweep!<br>
Vanguard fleets, intercept the Sirens!<br>

Commander, this is the North Sea Storm Analysis Fleet. All Sirens have been eliminated.<br>
We haven't sighted any elites, so it's likely the force they sent at us is only a scouting fleet.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Hwah Jah：</span><br>
South Sea Storm Analysis Fleet here. We suspect the same.<br>
All targets have been wiped out. Commencing refuel and resupply.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Great work, both of you. Chi An, what are your damages?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Chi An：</span><br>
Thanks to the support we received, we only lost less than five percent of combat effectiveness.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Chen Hai：</span><br>
Less than three percent here, on account of us being in close proximity to the BP base.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Hwah Jah：</span><br>
Oh dear... Ours is estimated at around nine percent. That's quite a lot.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
It's fine. Your fleet has less firepower than the other two and you have a wider area to cover. You're doing great.<br>
Our max allowable losses for the first stage was 15% total, and you all kept it below that value. Outstanding work.<br>
Huan Ch'ang, do you see any enemy movements within your recon range?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Huan Ch'ang：</span><br>
From what I have now, it looks like a sizable force is gathering at their Mariana base. On the bright side, I don't see any reinforcements anywhere else.<br>
In short, there have been no major changes.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
The Storm has been eliminated, our damages are within estimates, and there are no surprises from the Sirens. All in all, this is going great.<br>
Yat Sen, do you have anything to report?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Yat Sen：</span><br>
Everything is as normal around the BP base. I think we can move on to the next stage of the operation.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Thanks. All fleets, you'll set off in one hour as planned.<br>
Oh, and send the Northern Parliament a message for me – "We'll meet at the Mariana Islands."<br>

KABOOOM!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Memphis：</span><br>
Commander, we're losing mass-produced ships at an increasing rate.<br>
The Sirens have deployed Type IVs. Here, we caught a picture of one.<br>
It's half-submerged, but it's possible it's been there for quite a while.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Wait, Type IV?<br>
(I know that one. It's a rare model that was mentioned in Bismarck's files and showed up during Operation Frostfall.)<br>
(This is more of them than we've ever seen before.)<br>
(Chkalov told me they're a big upgrade to the previous model, as you'd expect.)<br>
(The fact they're attacking in such large numbers only makes them even more dangerous.)<br>
(The Empery is heavily reliant on its mass-produced ships, owing to the fact that they have few shipgirls.)<br>
(While our mass-produced ships can handle their Type IIIs, Type IVs are a much bigger ask.)<br>
(We'll be forced into a dragged-out losing battle if we keep fighting like this.)<br>
(Our best hope is to regroup with the Northern Parliament ASAP.)<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Communicator：</span><br>
BEEP BEEP!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">An Shan：</span><br>
Commander, they've sent in Type IVs. Our mass-produced ships are taking heavy casualties.<br>
I have a plan, though. We'll bombard the enemy using our Dongyus.<br>
The Type IVs may be powerful, but even they can't survive a volley of cluster rockets!<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Are you sure that's going to work?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">An Shan：</span><br>
I'm sure! We gathered intel on the Type IV and ran combat simulations back at the base to test the theory.<br>
Trust me! It's going to work!<br>

<span style="color:#ff9b93;">Tester：</span><br>
You're pushing your luck, shipgirls of the Dragon Empery.<br>
Cease fighting and return to your base and I'll leave you alone until the Storm is operational again.<br>
Or, you can stay and I'll sink every last one of you.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Harbin：</span><br>
Hah! You expect us to accept being stuck on land 'cause of the Storm?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Chang Chun：</span><br>
Imagine thinking we'll just lie down and take it.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Tai Yuan：</span><br>

<span style="color:#ff9b93;">Tester：</span><br>
So much for talking it out. Ships, advance!<br>
<br>
<span style="color:#ff9b93;">Tester：</span><br>
This is your final warning. Take your fleet and retreat now.<br>
<br>
KABOOOM!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Harbin：</span><br>
Did ya hear that? That was our final answer!<br>
<span style="color:#ff9b93;">Tester：</span><br>
......<br>

What's the matter? Cat got your tongue?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Communicator：</span><br>
BEEP BEEP!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Chen Hai：</span><br>
Commander, numerous Tester vessels have been spotted on our course.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Can you defeat them?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Chen Hai：</span><br>
Easily.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Hwah Jah：</span><br>
We're seeing Tester vessels here as well. There's a dozen or more of them!<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
A dozen is a lot... Can you can handle them?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Hwah Jah：</span><br>
We will. Our fleet will accomplish its objective no matter what.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Alright. I'll apply enough pressure to deal with Tester herself to make sure she can't divert resources to her vessels.<br>
Continue the operation. We'll rendezvous at the Mariana stronghold!<br>
<br>
<br>
KABOOOM!<br>
Through teamwork and the Dongyus' rocket barrages, we managed to endure Tester's assault.<br>
Her vessels went down one after the next. Our victory is all but certain.<br>
<span style="color:#ff9b93;">Tester：</span><br>
You broke through the Storm, clueless as to what lies beyond it.<br>
Hell, you don't even know we're trying to protect you.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Yat Sen：</span><br>
Even if we assume you're telling the truth, your "protection" is no better than a cage.<br>
Besides, we can clearly see what lies beyond the storm.<br>
It is freedom. Freedom and the future!<br>
<span style="color:#ff9b93;">Tester：</span><br>
I will not let you go there.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Harbin：</span><br>
Too late. We're already going there!<br>
Destroying your Storm was only the first step! We're gonna choose our own path!<br>
If you think you can stop us then quit yapping and try it!<br>
We'll crush your fleet, your vessels, AND your mainframe!<br>
<br>
KABOOOM!<br>
After much fierce fighting, all of Tester's vessels have been destroyed.<br>
BEEP BEEP!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">An Shan：</span><br>
Commander, this is the East Storm Analysis Fleet. All Sirens have been eliminated.<br>
We've broken through the storm area and are currently en route to the destination!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Chen Hai：</span><br>
So am I. Heading to the objective now.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Hwah Jah：</span><br>
We're on the way, too!<br>
<br>
Reports are coming in from all directions that Tester's vessels have been taken care of.<br>
At long last, the Dragon Empery has broken through the Storm and set forth toward their own future.<br>
{{折叠面板|内容结束}}

{{折叠面板|标题=Concurrent Operations|选项=25|主框=1|样式=primary|展开=是}}
<br>
There are three steps to Operation Wind-Crushing Ice Dragon, each with their own objectives.<br>
The first – break through the storm and eliminate all Sirens in the area. When this step has been completed, and only if losses are less than 15%, can step two be initiated.<br>
Next step – advance to the Mariana Islands stronghold and regroup with the Northern Parliament's support fleet.<br>
Finally – eliminate the Siren presence at the stronghold and neutralize all the facilities on the island.<br>
Now that it's all but certain that the Mariana Islands are the origin point of the Storm, we know that we must root them out entirely, lest all our efforts be for nothing.<br>
After savoring the glory of eliminating Tester for just a moment, all our fleets focused their minds once more on the main goal.<br>
All three of us coming from a different direction, we reunite in the waters of the Mariana Islands.<br>
Pacific - Vicinity of Mariana Islands<br>
East Sea Storm Analysis Fleet<br>
Commander's Vessel<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Memphis：</span><br>
Commander, I've received a report of what's been happening in the Pacific.<br>
The Sea of Stars has widely deployed drones with signal enhancement functions across various bases.<br>
This will facilitate much smoother communication between our units, moving forward.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
(I've dealt with mass illusions before, but never on THIS scale.)<br>
(It's affecting not just the Pacific, but the Eagle Union and Europa as well.)<br>
(A remote base like PH falling into enemy hands would be bad enough, but NY City and the Sea of Stars almost fell, too.)<br>
(Thankfully, Shimanto and Harutsuki came to the rescue, and the hard work of Saratoga, Indiana, and Enterprise pulled us back from the edge of the cliff.)<br>
(Which brings us to where we are now...)<br>
(All illusory realms detected across the Eagle Union have been erased.)<br>
(Enterprise has grouped up with Nagato's fleet and they're all en route to the Marshall Islands.)<br>
(It's not easy out there, and the fact they're working together brings a smile to my face.)<br>
(I wouldn't have expected the guardian fox to appear on the front lines of such an unusual operation, but any help we can get is appreciated.)<br>
(If we can get her on our side, reforming the Azur Lane should be easier.)<br>
(Then there's that report she gave me. About Akagi...)<br>
(And her alleged connection to this whole incident.)<br>
(I don't know how to feel about Akagi being involved in this.)<br>
(We once fought, she and I. Right here, in the Pacific.)<br>
(It was a sudden attack. Nobody anticipated it.)<br>
(Then came the battle of the Coral Sea.)<br>
(And then the battle at AF.)<br>
......<br>
(There were rumors that she'd sunk following that battle. It was later proven to be false.)<br>
(She's a crafty one, that fox. Leading the Sakura Empire by day, and working out schemes by night. I wish I'd had more chances to speak to her one-on-one.)<br>
(We DID fight alongside rather than against each other during the battle of Compiler's mainframe...)<br>
(That was a time for action, not for dialogue, though. A shame.)<br>
(Maybe I should've pulled her aside and talked to her...)<br>
(While she didn't attend the meetings to discuss the Azur Lane's reformation, I've heard rumors that she has a rather distinct stance on the topic.)<br>
(Still, something doesn't sit right with me.)<br>
(Even if she does have a dangerous side to her, she doesn't strike me as someone who'd cause an incident that has world-spanning effects.)<br>
(After all we've been through – after all SHE'S been through – I don't want to believe she'd throw her friends under the bus like this.)<br>
(She's not some egomaniac who wants to take over the world...)<br>
(...Or maybe I don't know her as well as I think I do.)<br>
(I'll task some people with gathering intel for me, just to prepare for a possible worst-case scenario.)<br>
(For now, I need to focus on what's right in front of me – recapturing the Marshall Islands and toppling the Mariana Islands stronghold.)<br>
(Starting with the Marshall Islands. It's fallen into the hands of that still-unidentified enemy, who's using it as a forward operating base.)<br>
(Bunker Hill's fleet is blockading the path to other bases. They'll make sure nothing comes in or out.)<br>
(Enterprise, Nagato, and their fleets have departed from the Solomons. They'll soon reach the Marshall Islands.)<br>
(Once they're there, Bunker Hill will join them in recapturing the island.)<br>
(For backup, we have two Eagle Union fleets in reserve.)<br>
(One will set off from SD, resupply and refuel at PH, then head straight to us.)<br>
(The other comes from NY, which does mean they'll have to take the route through Panama Canal.)<br>
(They're really far away and won't make it in time, but I'm bringing them over just in case anyway.)<br>
(Then there's my current objective – the Mariana Islands.)<br>
(For the longest time, it had been a very unremarkable base for the Sirens with little activity to speak of.)<br>
(That is, until last year when the Dragon Empery began evaluating a plan to break through the Storm. Suddenly, it flared up with activity.)<br>
(It's almost like the Sirens knew what the Empery was planning, just like how the Storm intensified when the Empery rallied its troops.)<br>
(That was essentially soft confirmation that the Storm's control center is on those islands.)<br>
(This theory was further reinforced by the intel Iron Blood shared, as well as Tester's serious attempt to push us back.)<br>
(Boy, did all of this come at the perfect time for us.)<br>
(The Empery is sending in fleets from three directions, and the Northern Parliament is sending a fleet of their own to the south.)<br>
(Seeing as we've worked around the jamming, maybe I should also ask for help from the garrisoned fleet at Iron Blood's Floating Fortress.)<br>
(Oh, and then there's the Royal Navy fleet stationed in Sydney.)<br>
(From what I've heard from our allies at Tierra del Fuego, there's not much of anything happening around Antarctica. Not yet, anyway.)<br>
(On one hand, someone has to keep an eye on Pamiat' Merkuria META. On the other, spreading my forces isn't ideal.)<br>
(I don't like having to choose one over the other, but...)<br>
(Alright. Maybe something like...)<br>
(I'll tell the Royal Navy's fleet to join in the attack on the Mariana Islands.)<br>
(Pamiat' likely won't be a problem. Kimberly said she simply wanted to enjoy a vacation for some reason. Besides, I can count on Observer not letting Pamiat' do as she pleases in Antarctica.)<br>
(As the old saying goes – the enemy of my enemy is my friend.)<br>
(Finally, we have the question of how to allocate forces for these two separate operations.)<br>
(The Marshall Islands are the unknown enemy's headquarters, and they're still affected by the illusions. They're a threat we need to take seriously.)<br>
(At the same time, the Storm can return if we don't destroy the control center soon. We need to be ready for that.)<br>
(The Empery is keeping the storm in check with their Dongyus, but they can't keep up the assault forever.)<br>
(There's also very little time to reposition anyone since the Mariana Islands will keep producing those Type IVs.)<br>
(Okay. I've got it.)<br>
(We'll just run both operations concurrently.)<br>
(Operation Wind-Crushing Ice Dragon will continue as planned. If it feels like we're outnumbered, I'll wait for backup from the Royal Navy and Iron Blood.)<br>
(If Enterprise, Indiana, and Nagato take back the Marshall Islands quick enough, I'll regroup with them, too.)<br>
(So that's it. Destroy the Storm's control center and neutralize the Type IV production facilities.)<br>
(As nice as it would be to destroy a mainframe today, there's no way Tester will expose her beating heart to us like that.)<br>
(I also don't want to provoke her. Playing safe is the name of the game here.)<br>
Memphis, I've got some orders.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Memphis：</span><br>
I'm listening. Whenever you're ready.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Thanks. Be sure to write this down.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Memphis：</span><br>
Of course!<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
One – tell the bases at Karaginsky, BP, and SD to keep close eyes on the Sakura Islands. Gather intel whenever possible.<br>
Two – tell the Royal Navy fleet stationed in Sydney to depart for the Mariana Islands and aid in the operation to capture it.<br>
Additionally, they must be ready to relay any monitoring info from Antarctica and its ocean directly to me.<br>
Three – tell the Eagle Union fleet stationed at Tierra del Fuego to be on standby. Command of it will be transferred to the Royal Navy's fleet in Sydney until this operation has concluded.<br>
Four – contact Peter Strasser and inform her that we request the Floating Fortress Fleet's assistance in the capture of the Mariana Islands.<br>
Additionally, share with her all the intel relevant to this operation and tell her to contact her comrades in Europa immediately to let them know.<br>
Five – inform Enterprise that her group is responsible for recapturing the Marshall Islands.<br>
Their mission continues as planned under her leadership. The Sakuran fleet accompanying her is to follow her orders.<br>
Six – Operation Wind-Crushing Ice Dragon will continue as planned. The Northern Parliament's and Dragon Empery's fleets are to aid in destroying the Sirens' stronghold on the Mariana Islands.<br>
Finally, seven – if one of our two task forces finishes their objective before the other does, they are to swiftly link up with the other.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Memphis：</span><br>
Got it.<br>
Is there anything else?<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
No, that's everything. I'm going to rest my eyes a bit now. If something happens, give me a call.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Memphis：</span><br>
Heehee. You have a nice, long rest now.<br>
You're really going above and beyond for us all here, Commander. Thank you.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Don't mention it. I'm just doing my job.<br>

<br>
The Marshall Islands stood ominously still on the horizon, juxtaposed by a trio of approaching fleets.<br>
Following their battle at the Solomon Islands, the shipgirls determined that the illusion gripping the Marshall Islands was far, far more dangerous than anticipated.<br>
Enterprise, Nagato, and her fleet got into attacking positions while Bunker Hill pivoted from defense to offense, trying to draw the enemy's attention as much as possible.<br>
Meanwhile, Enterprise's fleet split up into smaller squadrons that each attacked one island, probing around to try to find the heart of the illusion.<br>
Pacific - Marshall Islands<br>
Nagato's Fleet<br>
Within the Illusion<br>
Birds were singing, flowers were blooming, and blue waters intersected green mountains. It was like a painting, inviting you to get lost inside it.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ashigara：</span><br>
Man. This place sure is a sight for sore eyes.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Shoukaku：</span><br>
It's so beautiful – like a dream come true. Too beautiful to be real.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Shimanto：</span><br>
Lady Nagato, do you recognize this?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Nagato：</span><br>
Aye. It's unmistakeable.<br>
<br>
Nagato surveyed her surroundings, a grim look occupying her face.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Kongou：</span><br>
Do you know what this place is?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Nagato：</span><br>
It is the sanctuary of the Prime Sakura.<br>
It is a closely guarded place, thus it's to be expected that none of you know it.<br>
(If the Eagle Union ladies' speculation is true, then the illusion is a projection of the dreams of those within it.)<br>
(Supposing that the Solomon Islands' illusion was a projection of mine, then whose is this?)<br>
(Unzen, mayhaps? No, that cannot be. She is under Yamato's protection.)<br>
(Musashi, then? Highly unlikely. She has left the Sakura Islands and would have no reason to come here.)<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Hiei：</span><br>
Lady Nagato, it appears that some people are sleeping up ahead.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Nagato：</span><br>
Sleeping within a dream, are they? Show me to them.<br>
<br>
There was a Sakuran gazebo by the stream. Surrounding it was grass and young girls wearing Sakuran clothing, fast asleep.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Kongou：</span><br>
I-13, I-19, I-25, I-26, I-56, I-58, I-168...<br>
What are our submarines doing here? They can't all have been stationed on the Solomons!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Kawakaze：</span><br>
Wake up! Open your eyes!<br>
It's no good. They won't awaken.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Hiei：</span><br>
There is a picnic blanket and snacks strewn around inside the gazebo. I would assume that they were going to have a flower viewing party.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Harutsuki：</span><br>
Lady Nagato, there's someone else here! It's Ryuuhou!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Nagato：</span><br>
What? Ryuuhou?<br>
(I could've sworn she was in the Diadem of Light... If not there, then in Europa with Suruga and Noshiro.)<br>
(Did Akagi purposely bring her here? If so, why?)<br>
(I take that back... She is clearly under the illusion's spell.)<br>
(Meaningless would it be to place her here to do something only for her to be put to sleep.)<br>
<br>
Nagato and the rest marched on, investigating the illusion.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Nagato：</span><br>
(This is no impostor. She is the real Ryuuhou.)<br>
(How strange. Neither she nor the submarines have ever seen the Prime Sakura's sanctuary.)<br>
(Then, if none of them know how it looks, who in the world could have created this place?)<br>
(Furthermore, if they lost consciousness in the illusion, would it still project what's in their minds?)<br>
(If imprisoning them here is the goal, what reason is there to render them unconscious?)<br>
<br>
The Sakurans moved the unconscious girls to a safe place, then began heading toward the illusory Prime Sakura.<br>
After a peaceful walk free of enemy attacks, the girls arrived at the foot of the Prime Sakura.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Nagato：</span><br>
(This tree is the heart of the illusion – and the reason why the illusion has become so powerful.)<br>
(Within the illusion on the Solomon Islands, I collected a fragment of the Watatsumi.)<br>
(The illusion was just that – an illusion. So was the Prime Sakura. Yet, the Watatsumi fragment was undeniably genuine.)<br>
(In this fragment, I sensed the corruption. Faint, but certain.)<br>
(The Great Sage rid the Watatsumi of corruption, so why has it become tainted once more?)<br>
<br>
Nagato placed her hand on the Prime Sakura and sensed the flow of its energy.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Nagato：</span><br>
(I am certain now. This Prime Sakura is indeed what sustains the illusion.)<br>
(Yet, strangely, its aura passes through the other trees in the illusion and connects to the outside... But why?)<br>
(Oh no... The illusion must be pumping energy into a foe on the outside!)<br>
(It's little wonder she was able to maintain her form, in spite of the Shadow of Corruption...)<br>
Our Eagle Union allies will be overwhelmed soon. We must act quickly.<br>
Shimanto, Kongou, take the others and destroy all the trees. They're sending energy to someone outside the illusion.<br>
I shall dispose of this false Prime Sakura.<br>
<br>
After issuing her orders, Nagato focused her mind on the Prime Sakura again.<br>
As she did, her surroundings suddenly changed in the blink of an eye.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Nagato：</span><br>
(Much like the real Prime Sakura, it has a grotto-heaven inside of it.)<br>
(I was right. The tree's energy is flowing out to the trees, which then reroute it to the outside.)<br>
(One needs to destroy the power source within this grotto to curb the flow. The tree itself will simply regenerate if felled.)<br>
(You sly dog, you...)<br>
<span style="color:#ff9b93;">Amagi：</span><br>
I knew you'd come, Lady Nagato.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Nagato：</span><br>
...Amagi. Is this your doing?<br>
I thought the Watatsumi's corruption had polluted your soul... Yet, on the Solomon Islands, you wanted me to walk away from this incident.<br>
I have many, many questions for you.<br>
The only issue is...<br>
<span style="color:#ff9b93;">Amagi：</span><br>
You don't know how much of my true self remains. Is that it?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Nagato：</span><br>
......<br>
<span style="color:#ff9b93;">Amagi：</span><br>
Heehee. I understand. When we spoke on the Solomons, I'd say about 30% of myself remained.<br>
Now, however... I'm honestly not even sure, myself.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Nagato：</span><br>
I see...<br>
<br>
To Nagato, Amagi was an unfortunate soul born with a defective hull. She was laid to sleep at the Prime Sakura's foot, praying she would recover. Alas, the Watatsumi's impurity took away even her hopes of ever waking again.<br>
Nagato had known this for a long time, but hearing the words straight from Amagi's mouth cast a shadow of sadness over her.<br>
Only 30% of her was still Amagi. Even so, she had to speak her mind to the one who worried for her.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Nagato：</span><br>
(I won't run away... No longer.)<br>
Amagi... Just who are you?<br>
<span style="color:#ff9b93;">Amagi：</span><br>
I'm Amagi.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Nagato：</span><br>
Are you really?<br>
<span style="color:#ff9b93;">Amagi：</span><br>
I am. I have her likeness, memories, personality, way of thinking, even her mannerisms.<br>
Amagi is the only thing I am.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Nagato：</span><br>
Speak not such absurdities. Amagi would never do what you're doing now.<br>
<span style="color:#ff9b93;">Amagi：</span><br>
Correct – I WOULD never do such a thing in the past. However, you're speaking to my future self.<br>
I'm afraid the person you once knew and the person standing here now are different people.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Nagato：</span><br>
That is a lie.<br>
You are not, and will never be, Amagi.<br>
You are nothing but a doppelganger. A doppelganger who devoured her soul and regrettably succumbed to evil.<br>
And I... I will put a stop to you!<br>
<span style="color:#ff9b93;">Amagi：</span><br>
I had a feeling this would happen.<br>
Be that as it may, I must accomplish my objective.<br>
I will not be stopped. Not by you or anyone else.<br>
Not even you – my dear sister Amagi!<br>
<br>
A thousand shikigami flew through the air, painting the grotto a pinkish color.<br>
Spells flashed brightly and cannons boomed thunderously. A fierce battle began.<br>

<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Shimanto：</span><br>
Shikigami serpent, strike like the winter moon!<br>
<br>
KABOOOM!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Enterprise：</span><br>
Nagato! Are you okay?!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Indiana：</span><br>
I knew it! There's a hidden second layer to this damn place!<br>
We more or less dispelled the illusion on every other island, but this one remained for some reason!<br>
Good thing we came to check on y'all! And even better that we're not too late!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Shimanto：</span><br>
Forgive me, Lady Nagato! Breaking down the barrier took a while.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Hiei：</span><br>
Get behind us, guardian fox!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Amagi：</span><br>
Well, you got here early.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Nagato：</span><br>
Forget about me! Bombard that evil spirit with all you have!<br>
She is extremely dangerous! We must eliminate her here and now!<br>
<br>
In that brief exchange, Nagato had figured out who their opponent really was.<br>
She sensed in her the same aura as she did from the Watatsumi fragment. The same corruption that rotted the Prime Sakura.<br>
This was not Amagi – it was the Shadow of Corruption.<br>
The corruption that Musashi and the Great Sage worked so hard to purge had not only returned, but also it seemed even stronger than it had been in the sanctuary.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Nagato：</span><br>
(The Eagle Union is with us! We need only stop this evil spirit, drain her power, and exorcise her one more–)<br>
(No! Damn! She cannot be stopped with ordinary attacks! The power she just flaunted was but a ruse to lure me closer!)<br>
<br>
By the time Nagato finally realized she had carelessly reached the trunk of the withered Prime Sakura, it was too late.<br>
The next moment, a massive entity perched atop a dead branch leaped down to attack her.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">{namecode:74}&{namecode:71}：</span><br>
- No! - LADY NAGATO!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">▇▇▇▇▇：</span><br>
▊▇ ▊▇■■■▊▇ ▊▇ ▊▇ ■■■■▋▌▊▎▇<br>
<br>
Just before the torrent of black mist could consume her, someone jumped out to protect her.<br>
It was Hiei – or rather, she looked like Hiei. The dark dragon swallowed her instead, then flew skyward.<br>
A moment later, it was all gone. The Amagi impostor, the Shadow of Corruption, and the woman who sacrificed herself for Nagato.<br>

<br>
Sometime later...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Indiana：</span><br>
Enterprise, I did a sweep of the area, but couldn't find anything.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Enterprise：</span><br>
Then we'll have to expand our search range.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Herring：</span><br>
You do that! Me and the other subs will go have a look!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Shimanto：</span><br>
Lady Nagato, I'll search the inside of the illusion one more time.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Bell：</span><br>
Let me help you with that!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Nagato：</span><br>
Enough already. I'm calling an end to the search.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Shoukaku：</span><br>
What?! Why?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Nagato：</span><br>
They aren't here. She used a Sacred Sakura to move to a new domain.<br>
It would be one thing if the Sacred Sakura domain was limited to the Sakura Islands. With it being stretched this wide, though, there's no reason to search this one place from top to bottom.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Pittsburgh：</span><br>
Wait, so you're saying she kidnapped Hiei and just teleported somewhere?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Nagato：</span><br>
Aye. Warping with a Sacred Sakura was a closely guarded secret of ours. I needn't withhold that knowledge now that you've witnessed it.<br>
(I swore to protect them. All of them. And yet, my own carelessness led to Hiei being abducted right before my eyes...)<br>
(No, calm down. It will be okay.)<br>
(That Amagi-like spirit was after me. She should be coming back to finish the job...)<br>
(And yet, rather than try again after she got Hiei, she simply vanished and hasn't been back since.)<br>
(This gives me a very, very bad premonition.)<br>
(I need to...)<br>
(No. Calm down. You cannot afford to lose your cool again.)<br>
(For now, it's time to recapture the Marshall Islands and meet up with the Commander!)<br>
<br>
Nagato took several deep, calming breaths, then placed her hand on the false Prime Sakura's trunk again.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Nagato：</span><br>
(There it is. There is another Watatsumi fragment here. I sense corruption, too.)<br>
Crumble to dust.<br>
<br>
Its core now pulverized, the Marshall Islands illusion fell apart in an instant.<br>
The black vessels beyond the illusion, too, disintegrated as their power source had been destroyed.<br>
At last, the battle of the Marshall Islands ended in a victory for the shipgirls.<br>

Pacific Ocean - Mariana Islands<br>
East Sea Storm Analysis Fleet<br>
Commander's Vessel<br>
Four fleets are displayed on the command system screen – three en route toward the Mariana Islands, and one giant fleet that just recaptured the Marshall Islands.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Memphis：</span><br>
Thanks to this, the operation is still on track, despite the slow-down.<br>
It's good our fleets advanced carefully, since now that we've retaken the Marshall Islands, we luckily have some troops to spare.<br>
The bad news is, moving forward will only get harder from here on out.<br>
Do you want me to tell the Royal Navy and Iron Blood to pick up the pace?<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
That won't be necessary. Considering our now-advantageous position, I'd like to keep them in reserve.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Helena：</span><br>
You're worried about that Amagi, aren't you?<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
I am. After hearing the reports of what she did, plus Nagato's account of what happened, I have good reason to be.<br>
We need to keep an eye out for any surprises from her.<br>
(I wonder what she wants – that being who has some traits from both Akagi and Amagi.)<br>
<br>
Sometime earlier...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Nagato：</span><br>
....As you've surmised, it was not the Sirens who were responsible for the illusory phenomena. It was someone who claimed – and believed – to be Amagi.<br>
To me, she is akin to a lingering will given form by the Watatsumi, tainted with corrosion from head to toe.<br>
...Indeed, she shares many similarities with the beings you call corrosion entities.<br>
One could say she is an offshoot of the corruption that eats away at the world. It would lend sense to us calling it "the Shadow of Corruption."<br>
However, what sets the Shadow of Corruption apart is that it took the form of our own mass-produced ships on the battlefield.<br>
Moreover, the Amagi-like entity knew how to and was able to use a Sacred Sakura domain to move to a new location.<br>
...It's true. The Sacred Sakura domain, the Sirens' teleporters, and the microlayer transference system share some striking similarities.<br>
Putting that aside, what's important is that this entity is dangerous.<br>
You and I both have apprehensions about Akagi. It's for that reason we must stop her as soon as possible.<br>
Otherwise, she may un-become herself and turn into a monster that ravages not just the Sakura Empire, but the entire world...<br>
...What? Don't try to be everywhere at once?<br>
...So you are keeping an eye on the Sakura Empire, too. I see.<br>
Then I will take your advice to heart and do what I can. To a reasonable degree.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
(I've considered a lot of angles, and none of them quite explain what – or who – this fusion of Amagi and Akagi really is.)<br>
(Is she a part of Amagi's soul which the corruption absorbed? Is she a phantom conjured up by the corruption? Is she a puppet controlled by Akagi? Is she Akagi herself, distorted and warped by the corruption? The possibilities are many.)<br>
(Personally, I doubt that she's either simply a puppet or a corrosion entity with identity issues.)<br>
(What we know for sure is that she's extremely dangerous and not to be taken lightly.)<br>
(...Thanks for this, Nagato. Be safe out there.)<br>

BEEP BEEP!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Chi An：</span><br>
Commander, the fleet is in position. I can see the Sirens' defenses from here.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Chen Hai, Hwah Jah, what's your status?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Chen Hai：</span><br>
In position, ready and waiting to start firing at your command.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Hwah Jah：</span><br>
Ditto. We've arrived at our designated location, awaiting your order to open fire.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Communicator：</span><br>
BEEP BEEP!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Sovetsky Soyuz：</span><br>
This is Sovetsky Soyuz, reporting to the Empery and the Commander. Our Antarctic Fleet and Blueprint Fleet are in position and awaiting orders.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Are you commanding the fleets yourself?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Sovetsky Soyuz：</span><br>
I am. Our objective, after all, is to take the Mariana Islands and destroy the machine that creates the Storm.<br>
To that end, I feel I should be on the ground with my troops. Well, on the water, but you know the saying.<br>
I have blueprint ships and Kirov META accompanying me. I hope they'll be of service to you.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Admiral Nakhimov：</span><br>
Admiral Nakhimov here. I'm glad to be fighting with you all.<br>
<span style="color:#ffc960;">Kirov META：</span><br>
Bringing several different factions to the same battle... Very interesting. I'll be watching and learning from your commanding style.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Communicator：</span><br>
BEEP BEEP!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Peter Strasser：</span><br>
This is Peter Strasser of Iron Blood.<br>
You called, Officer, and the Floating Fortress Fleet has answered. We will help you capture the Mariana Islands.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Hindenburg：</span><br>
Hindenburg speaking. We're waiting, Contract Binder. Give us your orders.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ägir：</span><br>
Heheh. I could never turn down a request for aid from you.<br>
I expect this to be a rousing battle. As always.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Implacable：</span><br>
The Royal Navy's South Pacific Fleet has arrived.<br>
We encountered an Orthodoxy squire along the way. She wants to talk to you, so I'll put her on.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Forbin：</span><br>
I am Forbin, Templar Knight of the Orthodoxy! I'm here to partake in your operation on Cardinal Richelieu's orders!<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Wait, Forbin? Are you able to signal Richelieu all the way from here?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Forbin：</span><br>
Well, I was! I received a very brief transmission from the Cardinal. She said she's dealing with the illusions in Europa as we speak!<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
(That's good news. Means Shinano and Clemenceau are handling things well. That's one less thing to worry about.)<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Communicator：</span><br>
BEEP BEEP!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Nagato：</span><br>
This is Nagato. My fleet is in position.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Excellent. Thanks for letting me know.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Hornet II：</span><br>
Hey, Hornet here! With my Type II and all! I'm on the way!<br>
Yorktown's staying at SD, so she handed command over our fleet to me!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Enterprise：</span><br>
Good call. She helps the place run, so it's best that she stays there until all the problems caused by the illusions have been sorted out.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Hornet II：</span><br>
Yeah, that's what she told me! Oh, and that she's sad she didn't get to meet the Commander, but there's always next time!<br>
Man, you three are so close. Commander and Enty and Yorky, sitting in a tree...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Enterprise：</span><br>
Hornet.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Hornet II：</span><br>
Uh-oh! That's my cue to shut up! Sorry!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Enterprise：</span><br>
Ahem. Commander, our fleet will arrive in an hour. Unfortunately, Hornet's fleet will need two hours even at top speed to get here.<br>
We don't wanna give the enemy too much time, so let's launch the attack in an hour. The Eagle Union will lead the charge – the other fleets can follow our trail.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
No problem. The attack will start in one hour, then.<br>

<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Indiana：</span><br>
Harutsuki! You okay?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Harutsuki：</span><br>
I-I'm fine, thank you!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Indiana：</span><br>
These Type IV Sirens mean business. Don't let your guard down.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Harutsuki：</span><br>
Okay! I'll be careful.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Indiana：</span><br>
Come with me. We're gonna regroup with the Sakurans.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Harutsuki：</span><br>
As you say!<br>
Wait! Indiana, behind you!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Indiana：</span><br>
God dammit! Turn around for one second and they rush you like hyenas!<br>
Think you can catch me off guard?!<br>
<br>
KABOOOM!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Indiana：</span><br>
Another Tester vessel destroyed. One point for me.<br>
Phew. Sure looks like that enemy stronghold is getting cooked.<br>
This'll be done in no time at this rate. Hahah.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Memphis：</span><br>
Got a report from Chen Hai! They've destroyed what they believe to be the Storm's control device!<br>
Also, the coordinated attack on the stronghold is going well! The mission objective should be completed pretty soon!<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Alright! Once the fortress is destroyed, all fleets will pull out of the area. Destroying Tester's mainframe will have to come another time when we're better prepared.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Hornet II：</span><br>
Well, about that mainframe – I think she's exposing it to us.<br>
Sending you the recon data I took. Take a look.<br>
<br>
Hornet sends me a picture and a set of coordinates.<br>
The picture depicts a great rupture suspended above the sea, almost like someone punched a giant hole through space.<br>
On the other side of the hole, there are thousands of faintly glowing lines, and in the background, a sprawling city of steel situated in a sea of electronics.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Memphis：</span><br>
Is that really it? Her mainframe?<br>
She's showing it for the whole world to see?<br>
<span style="color:#ff9b93;">Tester：</span><br>
Invasion prevention plan must be executed... Storm must be reconstructed...<br>
Actual test site values... far exceed projected values...<br>
Requesting local cleanup authorization...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Bell：</span><br>
"Cleanup"? That sounds bad!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Fargo：</span><br>
Very bad. Compiler tried to initiate the same thing when we breached her mainframe.<br>
Our forces are too spread out to take her on. I say we retreat before she can activate it.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Herring：</span><br>
Why the hell is she escalating like this?! We aren't even after her damn mainframe!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Pittsburgh：</span><br>
Maybe it's not us... It's someone else!<br>
<span style="color:#ff9b93;">Tester：</span><br>
REQUEST DENIED.<br>
YOUR VESSEL IS SHOWING SIGNS OF MANIPULATION. SUBMIT TO A SELF-DIAGNOSTIC.<br>
A self-diagnostic NOW?!<br>
I'm perfectly fine! Do I look like I'm malfunctioning?!<br>
Look-look-look-look li-li-like mal-mal-mal-mal–<br>
<br>
KABOOOM!<br>
<span style="color:#ff9b93;">Amagi：</span><br>
Oh dear. You should see a repairman about that.<br>
<br>
From seemingly nowhere, the Amagi doppelganger appeared.<br>
With that, the final Tester vessel on the path toward her mainframe was destroyed instantaneously.<br>
<span style="color:#ff9b93;">Amagi：</span><br>
I'll make good use of your mainframe, if you don't mind.<br>
<br>
Dark tendrils pulsated forth from her fox mask.<br>
Black mist shot through the air, aiming for the rift in space where the wrecks of Tester and her ships lay.<br>
But, just as they were about to enter the rift, they hit an invisible wall, sending sparks flying.<br>
Meanwhile, more of the black mist had covered the wreckages of the mass-produced ships. It pulled them together, transmutating them into a single, enormous vessel.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Communicator：</span><br>
BEEP BEEP!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Nagato：</span><br>
It's her! That's the Shadow of Corruption!<br>
She is trying to seize control of Tester's mainframe and connect the Watatsumi to her false Sacred Sakura!<br>
Commander, you must stop her IMMEDIATELY!<br>
<span style="color:#ff9b93;">Amagi：</span><br>
Computational resources. A soul. A body...<br>
Now I have them all.<br>
Orochi! Reveal yourself to me!<br>
<br>
The sea was blanketed in the black mist of corrosion. It first became a gust, then a tornado, then assumed its final form as a corrosion entity.<br>
The colossal battleship dubbed "Orochi" radiated a foreboding crimson light, its form distorting.<br>
Then, it shrunk down, taking the form of a human.<br>
First, there was one, then two, then three, ten, a hundred...<br>
Finally, a crimson crowd of people stood there ominously, like an army of Pawns.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Nagato：</span><br>
Those... things... they're not shipgirls.<br>
Nor are they Pawns, nor are they ships... and they're certainly not people!<br>
This is mad!<br>
What have you done?! You've horribly misused the Watatsumi's power!<br>
<span style="color:#ff9b93;">The Many Amagis：</span><br>
Ahahahahaha!<br>
I've done it!<br>
I'm so, so happy!<br>
<br>
Cacophonous laughter echoed across the sea.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Memphis：</span><br>
Abnormal weather detected! Corrosion entities are appearing... and mass-produced ships... My god, there are so many of them!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Nagato：</span><br>
The impostor's strength is still growing... How? She should have no power outside of an illusion...<br>
The mainframe! That's it! If need be, we must put our lives on the line to stop her from reaching it!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Memphis：</span><br>
But how? That corrosion storm is too dangerous to get close!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Chen Hai：</span><br>
There is a solution! That storm is very similar to the one we destroyed just earlier! What's more, it's already very unstable!<br>
I believe we can dissipate it using the Dongyus' rockets!<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Doesn't hurt to try! Do it!<br>
Dragon Empery units, target the corrosion storm with your Dongyus! Iron Blood units, protect them!<br>
Enterprise, Bunker Hill, Pittsburgh, disperse the crowd of Amagi doppelgangers!<br>
We'll head for Tester's mainframe and stop the head Amagi from getting in at any cost!<br>

<br>
KABOOOM!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Nagato：</span><br>
With your blasted corrosion storm gone, you cannot move as you please!<br>
Give up! Your plan has failed!<br>
<br>
The Dongyus were successful in eliminating the corrosion storm – the very thing that sustained the army of the Amagi doppelganger. Without it, the Eagle Union readily eliminated them all.<br>
<span style="color:#ff9b93;">Amagi：</span><br>
You look so awe-inspiring now, Lady Nagato. I'm surprised.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Nagato：</span><br>
Do not speak using Amagi's voice, you fiend.<br>
<span style="color:#ff9b93;">Amagi：</span><br>
You can think whatever you like, because – guess what? I've already succeeded.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Nagato：</span><br>
"Succeeded"? You're lying to yourself about being satisfied with creating these abominations.<br>
Do you think THAT'S what Akagi would've wanted?<br>
<span style="color:#ff9b93;">Amagi：</span><br>
Not at all. The fates of these creatures were sealed the moment they were made.<br>
Tell me, Nagato – when you look at them, what do you see?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Nagato：</span><br>
A herd of impostors that shan't ever, ever reach the truth.<br>
<span style="color:#ff9b93;">Amagi：</span><br>
Interesting. Impostors of who, exactly?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Nagato：</span><br>
What do you mean, "who"?<br>
<span style="color:#ff9b93;">Amagi：</span><br>
A falsehood can only exist if a truth exists. Imitations owe their existence to an original. Whose hull are they based on, and where is its owner?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Nagato：</span><br>
The owner is long since dead!<br>
<span style="color:#ff9b93;">Amagi：</span><br>
Dead? Is she? Why?<br>
Close your eyes and think about it, please. Have you not found a way to cure Amagi's illness?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Nagato：</span><br>
What are you talking about? That was a dream – a vision produced by the illusion.<br>
<span style="color:#ff9b93;">Amagi：</span><br>
A dream, you say?<br>
You are in reality right now. Yet you cannot forget the memory of that perfect dream you had.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Nagato：</span><br>
You can't be serious...<br>
<span style="color:#ff9b93;">Amagi：</span><br>
Where there is cause, there is effect, and vice versa.<br>
The impostor is the effect, the original is the cause. It's only logical.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Nagato：</span><br>
No... You implanted memories within us, then used the Watatsumi to make them real... That's it, isn't it? That was your plan all along!<br>
<span style="color:#ff9b93;">Amagi：</span><br>
Heehee... AHAHAHAHAHAHA!<br>
<br>
The figure with the red fox mask turned around and walked inside the rift in space, laughing triumphantly.<br>
As the last traces of the corrosion storm faded away, the portal to the mainframe closed up.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Shimanto：</span><br>
Dammit! We were THIS close!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Nagato：</span><br>
No. We were not. That impostor was already in possession of a body able to exist outside an illusion.<br>
She let herself be attacked. She pretended as though she could not reach the mainframe. All to make a mockery of us.<br>
She wanted to flaunt her victory to me...<br>
Commander... I must talk to you...<br>
<br>
A crowd of shipgirls had gathered at the entrance to the Mirror Sea housing Tester's mainframe.<br>
The space ahead of them appeared empty. They all knew, of course, that this was only camouflage.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Nagato：</span><br>
I closely examined this place before you all got here.<br>
The route to the mainframe is undoubtedly here. However, an extremely intricate barrier protects it. It will take some time to dispel it.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Pittsburgh：</span><br>
A barrier, eh... Hmm...<br>
Given the context, do you think she's talking about a Mirror Sea?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Fargo：</span><br>
Likely. When Sakurans use the word "barrier," they sometimes refer to a special kind of Mirror Sea known as a locked Mirror Sea.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Nagato：</span><br>
Locked Mirror Sea? Go on.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Fargo：</span><br>
Well, the first of its kind was discovered in–<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Herring：</span><br>
It's a kind of Mirror Sea whose inside is hidden! Ya gotta know the right procedure to actually get inside!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Fargo：</span><br>
...That's the gist of it.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Nagato：</span><br>
Yes, that does seem like what this is.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Saratoga：</span><br>
What's that? I think I just heard something interesting!<br>
Our researchers have had success cracking the code to get inside those locked Mirror Seas! This sounds like a good opportunity to test some theories!<br>
What do you say, Commander?<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Hmm. The Sea of Stars' computing power would help us find the key much faster.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Yat Sen：</span><br>
Perhaps we can help. Our supercomputer – the Celestial Tower – can share the calculation burden.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Pittsburgh：</span><br>
So we've got a Sakuran expert on the subject, an Empery supercomputer, and our own Sea of Stars...<br>
This should be a piece of cake.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Nagato：</span><br>
Aye. This will go much quicker if we work together.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Herring：</span><br>
Alright, then I'll be the crier!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Nagato：</span><br>
The what?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Herring：</span><br>
Y'know, the one who shouts something when you use a talisman.<br>
I figure we'll need a dedicated crier for this Mirror Sea, so just say the word and I'll be there.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Nagato：</span><br>
I... What?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Bell：</span><br>
Wait, do you NOT need to do that? But Shimanto did it when she threw HER talismans!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Shimanto：</span><br>
That's... simply a habit of mine.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Bell：</span><br>
A HABIT?! So I recorded all those cringy lines for nothing?!<br>
Oh god... They've been playing ON LOOP inside so many illusions!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Herring：</span><br>
Yeowch. That's embarrassing.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Bell：</span><br>
Uuuggghhh! Kill me now!<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Hah! Well, let's put that aside and get started.<br>
All fleets, restock and resupply, then prepare to invade the mainframe.<br>
While Tester herself is incapacitated, we should be ready to run into the Amagi doppelganger. Do not let your guard down.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Communicator：</span><br>
BEEP BEEP BEEP BEEP!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Memphis：</span><br>
What? An energy pulse?<br>
It looks like it's coming toward us at high speed...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">TB ：</span><br>
Warning: Massive energy pulse was detected 30 seconds ago, originating from the Sakura Islands.<br>
Energy pulse shares 96.4% similarity with that of the creation of a Singularity.<br>
The size of this Singularity cannot be determined due to all nearby monitoring equipment having gone offline.<br>
The Sea of Stars suggests giving this Singularity the provisional name "Naraka."<br>
Based on calculations using available data, Naraka is believed to affect the entirety of the Sakura Islands.<br>
Threat level: Cataclysmic.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Everyone：</span><br>
WHAT?!<br>
<br>
The tables were completely turned as one side was on the cusp of victory.<br>
The players moved their pawns while the spectators stood on the battlefield.<br>
Be cautious at every step and plan for everything before you act.<br>
Know yourself and your enemy and you needn't fear the result of a hundred battles.<br>
The battle being waged by every faction goes on.<br>
Whilst the echo from across the starry seas whispers into their ears.<br>
To Be Continued <br>

Scapa Flow - Tourist Area<br>
The streets were abuzz with people. It was another ordinary, peaceful day.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Hardy：</span><br>
Hey, does anyone else think this vacation has lasted ridiculously long?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Musketeer：</span><br>
What's so bad about that? No orders to return home means endless vacation!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Kent：</span><br>
Yeah! I mean, who DOESN'T like a long vacation?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Suffolk：</span><br>
Look... In the sky.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Musketeer：</span><br>
Did you spot a fancy cloud or– Oh my gosh! Girls, look!<br>
<br>
A black sun, quietly burning in the dusky sky.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Queen Elizabeth：</span><br>
This is your queen speaking! My loyal subjects – wake up!<br>
You're in a sweet but deadly trap, so snap out of it!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Suffolk：</span><br>
Y-Your Majesty, why are you in the sky?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Queen Elizabeth：</span><br>
THAT'S the first thing on your mind?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Hardy：</span><br>
Owch... My head hurts...<br>
So this whole vacation was nothing but a dream... I can hardly believe how realistic it seemed.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Queen Elizabeth：</span><br>
Because it's not entirely a dream. Dreams are natural, whilst yours was fabricated!<br>
It'll be alright, though. This newly developed anti-conceptual weapon will tear down this illusion in only three minutes.<br>
If you feel dizzy or have a headache, that's fine. It'll be gone when you open your eyes.<br>
I'm off to the next illusion now. You lot just focus on waking up!<br>
Let's hope the girls manning the gate haven't done anything stupid...<br>

Sardegna Empire - Taranto<br>
Blue skies, blue seas, and sparkling waves as far as the eye could see. It was another ordinary, peaceful day.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Aquila：</span><br>
Mmmh. This weather is so wonderful.<br>
It makes me want to sail out and practice formations with my aircraft. Will any of you come to watch?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Carabiniere：</span><br>
Allow me to accompany you as your escort!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Leonardo da Vinci：</span><br>
Yeah, I'll come along! I've been meaning to test out the new glider I invented.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Torricelli：</span><br>
Hehehehe... You girls go and enjoy yourself... I'll stay right here...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Leonardo da Vinci：</span><br>
Sure, we'll– Uh, what's that in the sky?<br>
<br>
A black sun, quietly burning in the dusky sky.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Vittorio Veneto：</span><br>
Ahem. Veneto here. Can you hear me? I'm speaking to you through unorthodox means.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Leonardo da Vinci：</span><br>
A black sun... I remember that! It's that conceptual weapon Marco Polo used!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Carabiniere：</span><br>
That thing?! Oh no... Don't tell me someone's trying to cause another superimposition event!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Aquila：</span><br>
Clearly, this is not who we think it is, then!<br>
You! You're merely an impostor claiming to be Veneto! Who are you really, and what do you want?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Vittorio Veneto：</span><br>
Huh?! But Aquila, it's me... Vittorio Veneto.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Aquila：</span><br>
I don't believe you. Marco Polo already tried this trick once! It didn't work then, and it definitely won't work now!<br>
Nothing you say will make me trust you! Ladies, prepare for battle!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Vittorio Veneto：</span><br>
Wait, Aquila! I know you must be confused since I awoke you so suddenly. Um...<br>
Please don't be rash. Just take a deep breath with me... It's really me, Veneto. I've borrowed this conceptual weapon to break the illusion and get you out.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Leonardo da Vinci：</span><br>
Y'know, that DID sound a lot like what Veneto would say...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Aquila：</span><br>
You think so?<br>
What is this "illusion" you speak of? I don't understand what you mean.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Vittorio Veneto：</span><br>
Have you not been having unusual dreams? Maybe you've run into strange people, or noticed odd things happening.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Torricelli：</span><br>
Uh, no? The weirdest thing that's happened lately is you...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Vittorio Veneto：</span><br>
So... nothing strange has happened there whatsoever?<br>
What about from abroad? Have you received any calls or unusual messages?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Aquila：</span><br>
No. All our communications with Rome and nearby fleets have been perfectly normal.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Vittorio Veneto：</span><br>
(Did the illusions have absolutely zero impact on our country?! There's no way that can be true!)<br>
(Oh, I get it! The perpetrator was so afraid of Sardegna's glory that they dared not touch us!)<br>
(Yes, that explains it!)<br>

<br>
In a Tribunal hideout, shipgirls who had awoken from the dream were having a meeting.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Clemenceau：</span><br>
Elizabeth and Veneto are steadily dispelling illusions across Europa. All that remains is the Northern Parliament.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Richelieu：</span><br>
Ah, them... I've heard that Soyuz transferred the chain of command over to the Pacific.<br>
This move seems calculated. I think we should refrain from employing our conceptual weapon on their shipgirls.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Bismarck Zwei：</span><br>
Next topic, then. I've received intel that some circumstances behind the illusions have come to light.<br>
There is no dancing around it – fragments of the Watatsumi played a role in this incident.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Shinano ：</span><br>
It must be stated that the Sakura Empire had no plans for any incident such as this...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Bismarck Zwei：</span><br>
Nobody is suspecting your country. It's Akagi who's suspected.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Shinano ：</span><br>
Akagi?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Bismarck Zwei：</span><br>
Let me fill you in. Many people have reported seeing someone who goes by the name of "Amagi" in their dreams.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Richelieu：</span><br>
Amagi. The lead ship of her class and sister to Akagi.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Bismarck Zwei：</span><br>
Correct. Friedrich and I looked into her once. For what's relevant to this conversation, Amagi died.<br>
When she passed on, this affected Akagi in a substantial way. She was a battlecruiser and was reborn as an aircraft carrier.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Richelieu：</span><br>
Wait, Amagi... died?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Bismarck Zwei：</span><br>
Yes. She was to be a major contender for the flagship position of their Combined Fleet.<br>
Sadly, she was born with a hull defect that weakened her body. It only got worse, until it one day claimed her life.<br>
She is, to date, the only case of a shipgirl dying to a hull defect.<br>
Akagi took the loss of her sister so harshly that she was unconsolable for a while.<br>
Once she got better, she was a changed person. She built influence on par with her sister and became a substantial leader of the Sakura Empire, along with Kaga.<br>
Not long after, the Sakura Empire allied itself with the Sirens, and the rest you already know.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Shinano ：</span><br>
Amagi... Many Sakurans grieved over her death...<br>
Still, the memory of her faded as time went on... Now, scarcely few can claim to vividly remember her...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Bismarck Zwei：</span><br>
That's not everything, though, is it? Wasn't talking about her considered taboo?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Shinano ：</span><br>
That it was... It only made her seem more forgotten... This one must ask – how do you know all this, Bismarck?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Bismarck Zwei：</span><br>
Friedrich, as I said. She told me a lot about her.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Richelieu：</span><br>
Is there reason to believe that her hull defect was implanted by the Sirens?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Bismarck Zwei：</span><br>
It's not out of the question. That's why Akagi never fully trusted them.<br>
Perhaps allying herself with the Sirens was only a means to an end for her. Perhaps she wanted to exploit them, as we did.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Clemenceau：</span><br>
To summarize – not many know about Amagi, the real one, or that she passed on.<br>
Therefore, when she appears before people in an illusion, it gives the impression that she is, in fact, alive and well.<br>
From this, we can infer that Akagi's goal is to propagate knowledge on a global scale about a shipgirl known as Amagi being alive.<br>
The Watatsumi is capable of bringing ideas to life – and Akagi wants to exploit this power to revive Amagi.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Richelieu：</span><br>
But once a shipgirl has been given form, she shouldn't be able to recover from severe hull damage...<br>
The Commander is already trying to find a cure for that, too. Why would Akagi do this?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Bismarck Zwei：</span><br>
If she achieves it, it'll be an unprecedented breakthrough. The risk, however, is extremely high.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Richelieu：</span><br>
Onto something more pressing – the Commander and the Empery are fighting in the Pacific as we speak. I think we should aid them.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Shinano ：</span><br>
This one agrees... However, the Pacific is so unfortunately far away... We would not be in time even if we set off now...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Clemenceau：</span><br>
I wouldn't say that. There is a Watatsumi fragment we can use, no?<br>

In the Orthodoxy's capital, within an Eagle Union consulate, a group of awakened shipgirls were trying to get a grasp on what was happening.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Essex：</span><br>
(No way... That was all a dream!)<br>
(Okay, need to stay calm. I've snapped out of the illusion, so now I need to figure out what's going on, and fast!)<br>
Shangri-La, has our connection to NY City fully come back online yet?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Shangri-La：</span><br>
Not yet. According to Orthodoxy intel, a lot of equipment has gone haywire, even if the illusion itself is gone.<br>
I'd assume that's the reason why.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Essex：</span><br>
Damn it. They really caught us off guard...<br>
Then again, we're used to communications going down, so it's not the worst. Start writing a report and send it as soon as we have signal again.<br>
...Hm?<br>
Hey, hang on. Look at this. Does the center of the NA Ocean look weird to you, too?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Shangri-La：</span><br>
My, these monitoring values are shooting through the roof...<br>
I'll try to get in touch with New Jersey and ask her to investigate.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Communicator：</span><br>
BEEP... BEEP... BEEP...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Shangri-La：</span><br>
Huh? It's not connecting.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Essex：</span><br>
I've got a really bad feeling about this.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Shangri-La：</span><br>
That makes two of us...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Essex：</span><br>
Call Richelieu and let her know about this. We need to find out what's happening in the NA Ocean ASAP.<br>
I'll send out recon planes and see what I can find!<br>

Somewhere, in the Antarctic Ocean...<br>
<span style="color:#ffc960;">Pamiat' Merkuria META：</span><br>
Hm-hmmm-hmmm-hm♪<br>
<br>
Pamiat' Merkuria META straightened out her cap and coat, humming cheerfully all the while.<br>
Around her, a massive graveyard of wreckages lay turned over like dead animals.<br>
<span style="color:#ffc960;">Pamiat' Merkuria META：</span><br>
Silly little Observer. You're disconnected from your mainframe, and you thought you could stop me?<br>
Not even your weirdo META with a weirdo Pawn could save you.<br>
See, the only reason I lost last time was because I got too careless! When I put on my serious gloves, that's when it's time to run.<br>
Hm-hm-hm-hmmm♪<br>
Your test site is in chaos right now. I could do anything and nobody would know it was me.<br>
This is gonna be so easy!<br>
<span style="color:#ffc960;">Helena META：</span><br>
Easy? Are you sure about that?<br>
<span style="color:#ffc960;">Pamiat' Merkuria META：</span><br>
Oh, look, another one of Observer's bodyguards. Who is it this time?<br>
Just hurry up and do your thing! I've got stuff to do, so make it quick!<br>
<span style="color:#ffc960;">Helena META：</span><br>
Data separation – activate!<br>
<br>
A torrent of blue data rushed forth from the Tower and filled the sky and sea.<br>
A vast stretch of space filled with stars stretched on in all directions.<br>
<span style="color:#ffc960;">Pamiat' Merkuria META：</span><br>
What... What is this place?<br>
<span style="color:#ffc960;">Helena META：</span><br>
YLTVCL HUK LEWLS<br>
<span style="color:#ffc960;">Pamiat' Merkuria META：</span><br>
Ugh... You blocked my access to my resources! Who the hell are you?!<br>
<span style="color:#ffc960;">Helena META：</span><br>
You don't need to know. Rodney, deal with her.<br>
<span style="color:#c3abff;">Rodney META：</span><br>
The time has come – for your demise.<br>
<br>
Pamiat' Merkuria META was gone without a trace, almost like she was deleted from reality.<br>
<span style="color:#ffc960;">Helena META：</span><br>
You did a good job, waking the Commander up.<br>
But, now you've served your purpose. It's time to get off the stage.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Compiler ：</span><br>
Impressive work. Is she gone for good?<br>
<span style="color:#ffc960;">Helena META：</span><br>
I doubt it, though this will keep her quiet for some time.<br>
Let's go. We have things to do in Antarctica.<br>
