Mar del Demonios - ???<br>
Aboard the Vengeful Queen<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Royal James：</span><br>
"Go past Mar del Demonios, and let the stars guide you."<br>
Then, we should be...<br>
Oh! Look! Land! There really are isles off in the distance!<br>
Looks like the treasure map was the real deal after all!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Queen Anne's Revenge：</span><br>
Heheh. I knew it. This treasure map wasn't going to lead us wrong.<br>
Everything's going just as I expected.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Adventure：</span><br>
You say that, but you don't know where you got that map.<br>
You don't even remember when it got into your chest...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Queen Anne's Revenge：</span><br>
Oh, shut it. I've got a bloody billion chests. It'd be impossible to keep track of them all.<br>
What matters is that these isles don't appear on any regular maps and that there's no sign of inhabitants.<br>
In other words, we're the first people to discover them.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Adventure：</span><br>
You're forgetting about whoever made the map to begin with.<br>
And that's not even mentioning the old ruins on the isles. Someone left those there.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Queen Anne's Revenge：</span><br>
You said it yourself – old ruins. Whoever made them became worm food ages ago. Same with the map.<br>
That means WE discovered these isles. So, first order of business is to name and lay claim to them.<br>
Then, ladies, we dig for treasure among the ruins. Heehee...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Royal James：</span><br>
I was the first one who saw them, so I want to name them the Royal James Is–<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Queen Anne's Revenge：</span><br>
No.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Royal James：</span><br>
I was just kidding! Heheh! Seriously, though, since we all aboard the Vengeful Queen found it, how about naming them the Vengeful Queen Isles?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Adventure：</span><br>
Or maybe "the Treasure Isles"? The map does claim that there are loads of buried treasure there, after all.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Queen Anne's Revenge：</span><br>
No to both of those. I've already got a name.<br>
As captain of the Vengeful Queen, and based on the isles' proximity to Mar del Demonios, I hereby name them...<br>
Islas de Libertád!<br>

<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Royal Fortune：</span><br>
Om, nom, nom...<br>
Come again? Islas de Libertád?<br>
<br>
It was evening, and the members of Tempesta were feasting on a lavish supper in their grand villa whilst sharing rumors.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Mary Celeste：</span><br>
Yeah. Heard the Vengeful Queen's discovered some unclaimed isles past Mar del Demonios.<br>
They named 'em Islas de Libertád and made them their own. What do you think happened after?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Golden Hind：</span><br>
Did they start settling the isles, perchance?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Royal Fortune：</span><br>
Did they find some ludicrous treasure that set them up for life?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Mary Celeste：</span><br>
Not even sort of close. What they did was send invitations to people across the world. "Seekers of liberty, come and let us explore these ruins together."<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Royal Fortune：</span><br>
Ohhh. What an interesting choice! They sound like a decent lot!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Golden Hind：</span><br>
My, what a bold proclamation. Such perfectly preserved ruins are bound to attract countless people.<br>
It will give a tremendous reputation boost to the Vengeful Queen Fleet as well.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Mary Celeste：</span><br>
You bet. Crazy to think there are still unclaimed islands in this day and age.<br>
This might just stir up a wave of sailing adventures around the world!<br>
<br>
*knock knock knock*<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Dolphin：</span><br>
Ooh! Smells yummy! Seems I came at a good time!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Royal Fortune：</span><br>
If it isn't Tempesta's own adorable little messenger! Yes, this is a good time! Come and dig in!<br>
We made whale meat roasted with curry from Crownpolis!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Dolphin：</span><br>
Whale... curry? No! No thank you!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Golden Hind：</span><br>
She insisted on it, I'm afraid.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Royal Fortune：</span><br>
It's not about the whale meat, it's about it being curry made with spices from Crownpolis! They were a right pain in the bum to procure, I'll have you know!<br>
Tonight, it's whale meat, and tomorrow, it'll be shark meat! The day after that, maybe we'll do octopus! It'll all be scrumptious!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Dolphin：</span><br>
Oh, uh... Sure it'll be! They all sound yummy! But I'll still have to pass!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Royal Fortune：</span><br>
Right, I nearly forgot – what brings you here? Whydah ask you to deliver a message?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Dolphin：</span><br>
No, nothing like that. I'm just here to deliver this invitation from the Vengeful Queen.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Royal Fortune：</span><br>
Wait, from them? Blimey, could it be...<br>
Let me see!<br>
A-ha! It IS what I thought!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Mary Celeste：</span><br>
Come on, share it with the class. What does it say?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Royal Fortune：</span><br>
Exactly what you told us a minute ago. The Vengeful Queen lot has invited us to a treasure hunt on Islas de Libertád!<br>
It's a direct invitation, no less! Seems we've made quite a name for ourselves, mateys!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Mary Celeste：</span><br>
Hell yeah. So, when do we set off?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Royal Fortune：</span><br>
Before anything else, you need to call Whydah back to–<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Dolphin：</span><br>
Uh, I don't think we'll need to! She said it's too far away and it'd be such a pain, so she won't come!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Royal Fortune：</span><br>
Sounds like she's telling us not to disturb her, whatever we do...<br>
Alright! Then contact São Martinho and Adventure Galley instead.<br>
Tell them to meet us at Limestone Island, the last supply stop on the way to Mar del Demonios. Once you've given them the message, go there and wait.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Dolphin：</span><br>
Aye aye! I'll be off, then!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Royal Fortune：</span><br>
Hey, no need to rush. Sit down with us and have some of this whale curry!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Dolphin：</span><br>
Uh... oh...<br>

<br>
This wasn't Royal Fortune's first rodeo. She didn't expect this adventure into ancient ruins to go without a hitch.<br>
As such, she decided to call in her fleetmates who were operating elsewhere and spend several days stocking up on all the supplies and weapons that she could.<br>
And not only that...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Golden Hind：</span><br>
What... are you doing?<br>
<br>
Golden Hind gave a look of confusion to Royal Fortune, who was focused on carving a piece of wood.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Royal Fortune：</span><br>
I lost my compass, remember? It's made it a pain in the arse to travel between our two worlds.<br>
Sometimes our method for entering the storm works, and sometimes it doesn't.<br>
That's when I got an idea: Since I don't have a compass, why not just make another?<br>
Check it out! Can't tell it apart from my last one, eh?<br>
<br>
Royal Fortune showed her freshly carved wooden compass to Golden Hind.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Golden Hind：</span><br>
I can't say I saw your last one, but even so, isn't this a little too crude?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Royal Fortune：</span><br>
Oi! I worked really hard on this!<br>
Maybe it's not perfect, but it at least generally LOOKS like a compass!<br>
Tell you what – let's give this baby a trial run and see how she works!<br>
<br>
Royal Fortune blew off the wood shavings stuck to the compass, placed it on the table, and then put her hands together and said a prayer.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Royal Fortune：</span><br>
......<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Golden Hind：</span><br>
Doesn't seem like that did anything.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Royal Fortune：</span><br>
Yeah... Should've figured it wouldn't be that easy.<br>
Oh well! You never know – it might start working out of nowhere.<br>
Anyway, it's getting late. You should hit the hay. We've got loads of shopping ahead of us tomorrow!<br>

<br>
After three days of preparations, the well-stocked Tempesta fleet finally departed on a course toward Islas de Libertád.<br>
The winds on their route were gentle, and the skies were fair and clear.<br>
They sailed for 10 days without incident, and eventually reached their last stop before entering the sea of Mar del Demonios, where she and her companions would meet up – Limestone Island.<br>
They anchored their vessels and headed for a tavern on the island. There, they decided to gather intel whilst waiting for their fellow members.<br>
Once they'd conducted a bit of sleuthing, a piece of concerning information reached their ears.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Mary Celeste：</span><br>
Shhh. Did you hear the rumors about Mar del Demonios?<br>
They say that three fleets have already come back with heavy losses. No wonder we saw so many battered and bruised ships at the docks...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Golden Hind：</span><br>
Mhm. Also, while I was asking around, the tavern owner warned me to stay away from Mar del Demonios.<br>
The surviving crewmates even said they not only got caught in the most terrible weather, but also that they were attacked by sea monsters.<br>
As much as I have faith in our fleet, the idea that Islas de Libertád may very well be a trap is giving me second thoughts.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Mary Celeste：</span><br>
Dammit... Guess they don't call it Mar del Demonios, the "Sea of Demons", for nothing.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Royal Fortune：</span><br>
Are you saying someone's gone and used the Vengeful Queen's name to lure us into a trap?<br>
Can't think of anyone who'd have reason to do that... Even the Federation of Polises would have to consider the ramifications. They didn't invite just established fleets, but indie adventurers as well.<br>
Also, if sea monsters show up and attack out of nowhere, isn't that more proof that Islas de Libertád are real, if anything?<br>
I mean, remember the skelebeasts and the Goddess's central unit from that time we went to the Sleeping Sea?<br>
If there are loads and loads of ancient ruins around Islas de Libertád, that might explain why there are sea monsters around here.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Mary Celeste：</span><br>
We've still got time, so why don't we verify it with the survivors?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Royal Fortune：</span><br>
Yeah, good idea. Even better if they can confirm they were skelebeasts, and if so, what kind!<br>
<br>
Sunset arrived, and the group went back to the tavern one by one.<br>
Although they failed to get any notable information, they did meet up with Dolphin, who had just arrived.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Dolphin：</span><br>
Captain! It's me! I'm here!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Royal Fortune：</span><br>
Brilliant of you to show up! Why is it just you, though? Where are the others?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Dolphin：</span><br>
Adventure Galley was busy promoting the Star Wayfinders in Stellapolis, so she couldn't come.<br>
Same with São Martinho. Also, they told me to pass on a message: "The Nebula Guardians seem interested in Islas de Libertád, and have some sort of plan for it."<br>
Also, "Try to steer clear of them." That's all!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Royal Fortune：</span><br>
Nebula Guardians meddling in stuff. Must be a day ending in Y.<br>
Whatever. The rule is first-come, first-served with unclaimed islands, AND we've already been invited to a treasure hunt.<br>
We'd be bonkers to sit this one out!<br>
Crew, rest up well tonight! We're setting off tomorrow!<br>

<br>
As the curtain of night fell, so too did raindrops begin to fall on the fleet.<br>
Royal Fortune was in her lavish bed aboard her own vessel, thinking to herself.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Royal Fortune：</span><br>
Mar del Demonios... Named such because it's home to demons who lure in sailors with their songs, then drown them.<br>
I can't believe those are actually real... Well, I haven't seen one in the past two days, but still.<br>
And to think that Vengeful Queen lot found a bunch of new islands in a place like this.<br>
"Let the stars guide you," eh...<br>
<br>
She raised the written invitation with her hand, holding it in front of her dim lamplight.<br>
The light suddenly illuminated a star map drawn onto the invitation, revealing a course that could bring them to their destination safely.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Royal Fortune：</span><br>
Such intricate craftsmanship... Doesn't look like something her crew could produce.<br>
Maybe they made it with something they found in the ruins?<br>
...Bah. No use thinking about it. I'll find out when I ask them myself. Time to sleep!<br>
<br>
Fierce winds and violent waves struck the vessels in the fleet. Tempesta's ships were at risk of sinking at any moment.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Royal Fortune：</span><br>
What the–?!<br>
Oi! Mary! Golden Hind! What the bloody hell is going on?!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Mary Celeste：</span><br>
Captain, we're under attack by a group of skelebeasts!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Golden Hind：</span><br>
And things aren't looking great. We may have to abandon ship.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Dolphin：</span><br>
Bail out! Bail ooout!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Royal Fortune：</span><br>
Nooooo!<br>
Not my beloved shiiiiip!<br>
NOT MY BELOVED SHIP!<br>
<br>
Royal Fortune awoke in her nice bed, dim light illuminating her cabin.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Royal Fortune：</span><br>
Just... Just a nightmare? Damn ill-boding, ever for a nightmare...<br>
Doubt I'll be getting any more sleep tonight...<br>
<br>
She took out her wooden compass from underneath her pillow, pressed it between her palms, and offered a prayer.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Royal Fortune：</span><br>
Commander, please protect me so I can finish this treasure hunt safely, and let my ship go unscathed...<br>
Okay... That should do. Time for an early morning patrol!<br>

<br>
Six hours later, it was eight in the morning of their third day in Mar del Demonios. Despite this, the sun had yet to rise.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Mary Celeste：</span><br>
Something's not right. It's cloudy, but it shouldn't be THIS dark.<br>
Hell, I didn't even realize it was morning 'til I looked at the clock.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Royal Fortune：</span><br>
Yeah, blimey. Has Mar del Demonios always been like this?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Golden Hind：</span><br>
Long ago, I went through this place a few times with some merchant ships, and it certainly wasn't this gloomy then.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Royal Fortune：</span><br>
Means it's probably got something to do with the Vengeful Queen lot, then. We're lucky the rain's still only a drizzle, and there've been no storms or sea monsters yet.<br>
Since we're in the clear for now, let's have some nosh!<br>
Today, we're having curry with–<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Dolphin：</span><br>
I've got cod! Freshly caught!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Royal Fortune：</span><br>
Brilliant! Cod with curry it is!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Dolphin：</span><br>
Bleh...<br>
<br>
The time was two in the afternoon. The rain had stopped, the clouds had cleared, and the stars were brightly shining on their course.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Mary Celeste：</span><br>
Hang on, why are the North Star and the Southern Cross visible at the same time? Shouldn't that be impossible?!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Golden Hind：</span><br>
This night sky doesn't sit right with me...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Royal Fortune：</span><br>
Oh! I KNEW the star map in the invitation looked odd!<br>
I thought it might've just been artistic flair at first. Here we are, looking at those same unusual constellations!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Mary Celeste：</span><br>
Things're getting weirder and weirder. Should we keep sailing?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Dolphin：</span><br>
Seems a whole lot likelier now that we'll run into trouble.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Royal Fortune：</span><br>
Of course we'll keep sailing!<br>
We've not run into any sea monsters yet, despite all the weird stuff. I don't know about you, but I don't want to be known as a coward who scurried off home already.<br>
Besides, think of the treasures just out of our reach. The crew of the Vengeful Queen are waiting for us!<br>

{{折叠面板|标题=Arrival on the Isles|选项=7|主框=1|样式=primary|展开=是}}
<br>
Another half a day went by, and as midnight rolled around, the outline of an island finally appeared on the horizon.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Dolphin：</span><br>
Captain! I see land!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Royal James：</span><br>
Attention, ship to our bow! You are about to enter the waters of Islas de Libertád!<br>
I am Royal James, member of the Vengeful Queen Fleet! State your names!<br>
<br>
Once the group spotted the island, a warship that had been standing by in the area quickly caught notice of them.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Royal Fortune：</span><br>
I am Royal Fortune with Tempesta! We came here on an invitation from you!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Royal James：</span><br>
Oh! Royal Fortune? And you're with Tempesta?<br>
Well, that changes things! Welcome to Islas de Libertád!<br>
I've been waiting for ages out here, and you're the first group that's ever shown up!<br>
I was starting to get worried that there was something wrong with the invitation, and nobody would come here!<br>
Our captain, Queen Anne's Revenge, is waiting for you! Follow me!<br>
<br>
Tempesta's fleet followed Royal James, passing by a few unusually shaped islets while avoiding dangerous reefs along the way. Eventually, they reached the pier of an especially large island.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Royal James：</span><br>
Anne, I've brought Tempesta with me!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Queen Anne's Revenge：</span><br>
Ah. You must be Royal Fortune. Your name's been knocking about lately, and I was hoping to meet you.<br>
Welcome to Islas de Libertád. Think of it as our base, and make yourself at home.<br>
<br>
Once they arrived at the pier, the group was welcomed by Queen Anne's Revenge, the captain of the Vengeful Queen Fleet.<br>
After exchanging a few brief words with them, Royal Fortune began surveying the island before her.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Royal Fortune：</span><br>
I've seen ancient ruins before, but these are something else. They're so much bigger and better preserved.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Queen Anne's Revenge：</span><br>
Remarkable, isn't it?<br>
From finding the treasure map that led us here to making the journey itself, it was hellish to get to this place.<br>
These ruins are enormous, and exploring them just by ourselves would be too dangerous and too big a faff. That's why I sent out those invitations.<br>
But, I sent them three months ago. Three whole bloody months...<br>
And in all that time, you're the only ones who came here! I don't believe it – I really don't!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Royal Fortune：</span><br>
Well, it's not that nobody else TRIED, it's that... none of them made it here.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Queen Anne's Revenge：</span><br>
Come again? What do you mean?<br>
<br>
Royal Fortune relayed the things that they learned on Limestone Island.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Queen Anne's Revenge：</span><br>
...Sea monsters? Yes, I suppose your run-of-the-mill fleets and adventurers don't stand a chance against those.<br>
You know, I included a safe route in the invitation so people wouldn't be scared off by the weird night sky. Some good that did, I suppose.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Royal Fortune：</span><br>
Right, going out on a limb here – the stars looking odd had something to do with you, but the sea monsters didn't?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Queen Anne's Revenge：</span><br>
Kind of?<br>
Let me explain. The treasure map I got supposedly also functions as a key. Using it will let you open a path to the main island's ancient temple.<br>
Well, we did that, and when we did, the sky got strange all of a sudden. I suspect it's some sort of device meant to camouflage these isles.<br>
By the way, by "main island," I mean the one we're on. It's the largest, and located in the centre, so it makes sense.<br>
It's also my first suggestion for a treasure hunt. The buildings are preserved the best here.<br>
As for the "ancient temple," I'm referring to the giant structure up on the mountain over there. I presume you can see it.<br>
If you're wondering about the cannons and the defences next to it, those have been activated.<br>
There should be no shortage of unexplored areas on the island I could activate with my treasure map, but I haven't gotten to them yet.<br>
<br>
Queen Anne's Revenge pointed to the various landmarks and explained them one by one.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Queen Anne's Revenge：</span><br>
Besides the main island, there are four large-to-medium-sized islands and another, oh, 214 islets in unusual shapes.<br>
There are ruins on those as well, but the further out you go, the more deteriorated they get.<br>
I doubt they were always like this. If I had to hazard a guess, they got destroyed in a battle long ago.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Royal Fortune：</span><br>
214 islets... You've really done the maths.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Royal James：</span><br>
We were bored out of our minds while waiting for others to come!<br>
And it's all because of those darn sea monsters! They weren't there when we first got here! What made them crawl out of the depths all of a sudden?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Royal Fortune：</span><br>
You've not seen any sea monsters this whole time?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Queen Anne's Revenge：</span><br>
Not a single one. It's been graveyard-quiet around here for the three months we've been here.<br>
What about you? Did you do in a load of sea nasties on your way here?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Royal Fortune：</span><br>
No. We didn't run into a single one either. Maybe we got lucky?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Queen Anne's Revenge：</span><br>
Strange. I suppose we'll never know.<br>
Since you managed to make it, others should be able to as well. I say we wait a little longer.<br>
Ah, right, I'll give you an islet as a present.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Royal Fortune：</span><br>
...You what, mate?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Queen Anne's Revenge：</span><br>
Pick any islet you want – excluding the main one and the comparatively larger four – and it's yours.<br>
Make it your base, or do anything you like with it. I don't mind.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Royal Fortune：</span><br>
You're GIVING us an islet? Blimey, that's generous!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Queen Anne's Revenge：</span><br>
We can't hoard them all when there are this many. Might as well give them away.<br>
I'll be giving another to whichever fleet makes it here next.<br>
They're expecting a treasure hunt, and I wasn't kidding when I said there was one.<br>
I will lead the exploration of the five largest islands. Anything you find on the smaller ones belongs to whoever owns it.<br>
Everyone is free to explore, and whatever treasures you may find, our fleet won't start a barney over it.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Royal James：</span><br>
You first pick an island, then you go look for treasure on it! It's fun in that it's almost like playing the lottery!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Dolphin：</span><br>
Yeah! That DOES sound like a lot of fun!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Royal Fortune：</span><br>
I, uh... don't really know what you should say when you're suddenly gifted an island...<br>
Anyway, cheers!<br>
From now on, you're all close friends of ours!<br>

<br>
Sometime later...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Royal Fortune：</span><br>
Hmm... While I do trust those girls, we've only just arrived in this place. We haven't explored the area yet, and can't choose an islet until tomorrow.<br>
Spending the night on land seems kinda risky, so I suggest we stay on our ships tonight!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Golden Hind：</span><br>
A prudent decision. Spending the night aboard our ships will also let us respond more quickly in the event that something happens.<br>
Mary, would you be a dear and station your pet near our fleet to keep watch?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Mary Celeste：</span><br>
Sure thing. I'll do that!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Royal Fortune：</span><br>
That's meeting adjourned, then! Get yourselves some rest!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Mary Celeste：</span><br>
Dolphin, I remember you've always wanted to feed Argo. Why don't we do it together?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Dolphin：</span><br>
Just a minute! I'm almost done drawing!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Royal Fortune：</span><br>
Whatcha drawing? A map or something?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Dolphin：</span><br>
Yep! A map of Islas de Libertád!<br>
It's mostly blank since I haven't had much time, but I'm gonna fill the whole thing in later!<br>
Ever since we got here, I've gotten this feeling like there's some super-duper valuable treasure hidden here!<br>
I've just got to find it!<br>

<br>
It was the next day. While Tempesta was looking around Islas de Libertád, another group was off in Mar del Demonios...<br>
KABOOOM!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Portsmouth Adventure：</span><br>
Ahahahaha! Got another one of 'em!<br>
Right stupid, those skelebeasts are! Tryin' to steal MY bloody ship!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Amity：</span><br>
You make it sound like we're winning, when the truth is we're being chased.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Portsmouth Adventure：</span><br>
Heh! Because we're treasure hunters who go with the wind, lassie! Not prats who tackle the enemy head-on!<br>
Took care of 'em all to our bow! How's it goin' with 'em to our stern?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Amity：</span><br>
They've been dealt with. That was the last skelebeast just now. We've shaken them off.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Portsmouth Adventure：</span><br>
Whew... This course has been bustin' our arses, eh? Been fightin' from dawn 'til dusk now!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Amity：</span><br>
...Hang on. Something isn't right.<br>
Look at the clock. It's still morning, so how come we can see the stars?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Portsmouth Adventure：</span><br>
Whuh? Damn, you're right!<br>
Ya reckon this has got somethin' do with Islas de Libertád?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Amity：</span><br>
The odds are extremely high, yes. Remember when we went through a storm and found the Skynexus Tower?<br>
Then, just as now, the space around us changed drastically when we entered it.<br>
Therefore, I'm pretty sure the Islas de Libertád ruins are the real deal.<br>
Also, look at these constellations. Don't they match up perfectly with the strange star map in the invitation?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Portsmouth Adventure：</span><br>
Bloody hell, you're right! The star map's gotta be for showin' the right course through this place!<br>
Now things're gettin' interesting, ain't they!<br>
Whaddya think'll happen if we go off-course?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Amity：</span><br>
I don't know, but let's not find out.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Portsmouth Adventure：</span><br>
Hahaha! Yeah, figures.<br>
Startin' to seem like that Vengeful Queen lot got their hands on the discovery of the year, dunnit?<br>
Onward! Full speed toward Islas de Libertád!<br>
{{折叠面板|内容结束}}

{{折叠面板|标题=Snatch Everything Up!|选项=10|主框=1|样式=primary|展开=是}}
<br>
While the treasure hunters were sailing at full speed toward their destination, Tempesta was busy at Islas de Libertád...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Dolphin：</span><br>
Darn... I don't sense any super-big treasures on this islet, so it's not this one either!<br>
<br>
Dolphin scribbled a contour of the islet and drew a cross over it.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Royal Fortune：</span><br>
21st is a bust too, then. On to the 22nd!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Dolphin：</span><br>
Let's go!<br>
<br>
After taking the evening to rest, they got up the following morning, split into two groups, and went their separate ways on Islas de Libertád.<br>
Golden Hind and Mary Celeste went off to deepen their friendship with the Vengeful Queen's crew, while Royal Fortune and Dolphin set out to investigate all the islets.<br>
With the experience of the Fountain of Youth and the Sleeping Sea under her belt, even Royal Fortune could tell with just a glance how impressive the ruins in this place were.<br>
Even so...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Royal Fortune：</span><br>
The Commander knows this stuff better than anyone, and Terminal would have a pretty good clue, and we've got neither one with us...<br>
I can't believe we're going on an actual treasure hunt, and we're solely reliant on Dolphin's ability to find anything!<br>
UGGGHHH!<br>
<br>
From the 1st to the 20th, and from the 20th to the 40th.<br>
It took the two the whole day, and they just barely managed to finish exploring one-fifth of all the islets before supper.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Mary Celeste：</span><br>
Let's have a toast! To the captain's and Dolphin's hard work!<br>
<br>
Sitting in a tavern the crew of the Vengeful Queen had built, the members of Tempesta enjoyed a lavish meal together.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Royal Fortune：</span><br>
It was hard work alright! It's been an exhausting day!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Dolphin：</span><br>
Bwuh... My ears and head hurt...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Golden Hind：</span><br>
Well, help yourselves to lots of delicious food! Goodness knows you've earned it.<br>
Incidentally, Captain, did you learn anything during your search?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Royal Fortune：</span><br>
Yeah! That there really is treasure amid these ruins.<br>
There's even some in the mostly destroyed ruins on the small islands. Just imagining what riches are hidden on the larger five islands gives me shivers!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Golden Hind：</span><br>
Oh my. They're that valuable, huh? We'll be making a killing in this endeavour, then!<br>
Have you picked out an island to get from Anne yet? I'd love to see it for myself.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Royal Fortune：</span><br>
Not yet, no.<br>
We checked about a fifth of the islets today. Sure, there is treasure on every one, but Dolphin couldn't sense a bona fide treasure trove on any of them.<br>
That's why we've decided we'll pick one only after we've searched them all!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Dolphin：</span><br>
Yeppers! We're the first crew to arrive here, so we should pick the best one there is!<br>
Urgh... If only not for this dang headache...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Golden Hind：</span><br>
Captain, I'll bring Dolphin to her room.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Royal Fortune：</span><br>
Alright! Get some good rest! We'll try again tomorrow!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Dolphin：</span><br>
Okay. I promise we'll find something amazing!<br>
{{折叠面板|内容结束}}

{{折叠面板|标题=Visit From Old Friends|选项=11|主框=1|样式=primary|展开=是}}
<br>
After having supper, Golden Hind escorted Dolphin to her room. Meanwhile, Royal Fortune and Mary Celeste decided to wander around the main island.<br>
As soon as they got there, they heard a commotion coming from the pier.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Mary Celeste：</span><br>
See that? Is that a ship entering the harbor?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Royal Fortune：</span><br>
Oh! Other ships have shown up at last! Let's go have a look-see!<br>
<br>
The two reached the harbor, where they saw a ship firmly anchored, as well as Queen Anne's Revenge having an ardent chat with the visitors of the night.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Queen Anne's Revenge：</span><br>
I'm Queen Anne's Revenge, captain of the Vengeful Queen Fleet. Welcome to Islas de Libertád, renowned treasure hunters.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Portsmouth Adventure：</span><br>
Name's Portsmouth Adventure, and this 'ere's Amity. We got an invitation from ya.<br>
Bloody hell, though, it was a nightmare gettin' 'ere! Just about managed to carve a path through hordes of sea monsters!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Queen Anne's Revenge：</span><br>
Sea monsters? You actually ran into such things?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Portsmouth Adventure：</span><br>
Sure as hellfire we did! Even brought a couple of wrecks with us as trophies. Have a gander!<br>
<br>
Portsmouth Adventure steered her ship and unfolded a net, in which innumerable wreckage skelebeast parts lay.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Royal James：</span><br>
Whoooa! Honest-to-gosh sea monsters!<br>
I've never seen this variety of them before either!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Queen Anne's Revenge：</span><br>
Let me get this straight – you two fought sea monsters the whole way here?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Amity：</span><br>
Not quite. Mostly just for the past half day. It seems they don't chase you once you get within range of this night sky.<br>
These creatures are known as "wreckage skelebeasts." We encountered a lot of them long ago in the Sleeping Sea.<br>
On another note, this island isn't as bustling as I expected. Is that on account of the sea monsters as well?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Queen Anne's Revenge：</span><br>
Probably, sadly.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Portsmouth Adventure：</span><br>
Ya tellin' me we're the first to arrive?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Queen Anne's Revenge：</span><br>
Second, actually. Tempesta's fleet made it here just before you.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Portsmouth Adventure：</span><br>
Tempesta?! They're 'ere too, eh? Things're gettin' RIGHT interesting now!<br>
<br>
After exchanging a few more words, Queen Anne's Revenge told them that she would gift them an island. The treasure hunters were elated, just as Tempesta were.<br>
Afterward, they went back to their ship and settled on choosing an island the next day once they had rested up.<br>
Royal Fortune and Mary Celeste decided to come forth and also say hello to their friends.<br>
Several months had passed since their adventure into the Sleeping Sea, and they were certainly not expecting to meet the treasure hunters again on these islands.<br>
During their chat, Portsmouth Adventure recounted their adventures with the otherworldly visitors and the port's fleet. Upon hearing this, Royal Fortune seemed to ponder something.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Royal Fortune：</span><br>
(Otherworldly visitors, eh... Maybe that's how the Commander sees us as well.)<br>
(And that mysterious DOS... She sounds powerful.)<br>
(With the storms getting more frequent, I'm expecting more and more ruins to come to light, and for weird things to keep happening.)<br>
(It's like there's some sort of force that's bringing change to the world. Could it be... them?)<br>

{{折叠面板|标题=Searching the Lighthouse|选项=12|主框=1|样式=primary|展开=是}}
<br>
It was Tempesta's fifth day on Islas de Libertád.<br>
A few other decently sized fleets had arrived on the islands, and the crew of the Vengeful Queen Fleet welcomed them with open arms.<br>
Tempesta, however, cared little for the commotion taking place at the harbor.<br>
After spending the last four days searching all the islets, Dolphin had reached a conclusion...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Dolphin：</span><br>
There's not even a single mindblowing treasure on any of the over 200 islets!<br>
<br>
The group was disappointed, but settled for the islet with the largest size and most extensive ruins. They picked this islet and named it Tempesta Island.<br>
Following this, they got in touch with Anne's crew and invited them to search through the comparatively large ruins together.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Dolphin：</span><br>
Odds are really good that there's a super-duper cool treasure hidden in the 3rd islet's lighthouse!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Royal Fortune：</span><br>
Agreed! While these islands are nice, it's also awfully dark and gloomy here. That really brings down the mood!<br>
So, even if we don't find any treasure, we can at least turn on the lighthouse for a morale boost! Let's go!<br>
<br>
They arrived at the great lighthouse on the third islet, where they were greeted by a member of Anne's crew whom they hadn't met.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Adventure：</span><br>
N-nice to meet you! I'm Adventure, a member of the Vengeful Queen Fleet. I'll be leading you through the lighthouse.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Royal Fortune：</span><br>
Top of the hour to you, Adventure! How come we didn't meet sooner?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Adventure：</span><br>
Because I've been searching the islands this whole time while setting up a new safe house!<br>
Since I'm done with that now, I've finally got the privilege of adventuring with you all.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Royal Fortune：</span><br>
Wait, five whole days setting up a safe house?<br>
Didn't you find these islands three months ago? What were you doing that whole time? Surely not cooped up in a shelter or something?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Adventure：</span><br>
I was! The outside world is a dangerous place!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Royal Fortune：</span><br>
So... you're afraid of danger, yet you wanted to come along on this adventure into the ruins?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Adventure：</span><br>
That's right. You can't find new safe houses if you don't venture out!<br>
Staying in one place for too long is also dangerous!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Royal Fortune：</span><br>
Uh... I guess I see the logic in that.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Adventure：</span><br>
You need the treasure map to open the lighthouse's defensive walls, so stick close to me!<br>
<br>
The group passed through several bulky gates, and then finally arrived at the base of the lighthouse.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Adventure：</span><br>
I'm still not sure how you plan to climb up this lighthouse. There's no entranceway, and holding up the treasure map does a whole lot of nothing.<br>
Anne said we should look around and see if there's any other way inside.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Royal Fortune：</span><br>
Ooh! Gotcha.<br>
Let's see here...<br>
Looks to be... over 600 feet tall? And yeah, no entrance on the surface from what I can tell.<br>
No doors, not even any windows. Exterior is smooth as glass, but maybe...<br>
Nope, no way of climbing that!<br>
Dolphin, have you found anything?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Dolphin：</span><br>
Well, I know we're not supposed to destroy the ruins, but listen...<br>
What if you loaded me into a cannon, shot me to the top of the lighthouse, then I dropped a rope for you to climb? Wouldn't that get us inside?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Royal Fortune：</span><br>
Stone me, that's genius!<br>
I'll go look for a cannon!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Dolphin：</span><br>
Then I'll fetch a rope!<br>
<br>
DONG DONG DONG DONG!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Royal Fortune：</span><br>
What? Bell ringing? Did someone sound an alarm?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Adventure：</span><br>
Oh no... I knew this would be dangerous!<br>
We can do the lighthouse later! For now, just get back to my safe house!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Royal Fortune：</span><br>
Don't you think it's odd, though? We're in range of the night sky, so why would there be enemies here?<br>
Unless... A group of skelebeasts are invading.<br>
This is big trouble if so! We've got to hurry!<br>

<br>
When Tempesta reached the sea – with Adventure forcibly in tow – they came upon a confrontation between the Vengeful Queen Fleet and another fleet that radiated a vibrant light.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Mary Celeste：</span><br>
Is that... a Nebula Guardian?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Golden Hind：</span><br>
I should've known they'd turn up...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Lyme：</span><br>
Attention, fleet to our bow! I am Lyme, captain of the Third Nebula Guardian Fleet.<br>
Based on the laws of the Federation of Polises, all islands that appear on the seven seas are deemed as belonging to it. Until the Federation decides on a course of action for these islands, no entity is allowed to privately occupy them.<br>
Queen Anne's Revenge, your one-sided claim is wholly void and, furthermore, illegal!<br>
As such, you are to take all your followers and leave these islands immediately. Surrender them peacefully to the Nebula Guardians, and we will overlook your crime.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Queen Anne's Revenge：</span><br>
Heh. Tell me, what exactly do YOUR laws have to do with OUR Islas de Libertád?<br>
If the Vengeful Queen Fleet, or any free fleet, for that matter, was willing to submit to your corrupt and arrogant Federation, then it wouldn't have been put together in the first place.<br>
Do you really think you, alone, can represent the will of the Nebula Guardians and the Federation?<br>
And here you are, threatening me with a handful of tatty old ships you brought. You must have a burning death wish.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Lyme：</span><br>
Enough!<br>
<br>
KABOOOM!<br>
Lyme's anger reached its tipping point, and she fired a warning shot.<br>
Although the shot hit the water, the situation was a powder keg.<br>
A number of ships appeared from the surrounding islands and joined the Vengeful Queen Fleet's ranks.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Royal Fortune：</span><br>
Uh-oh. Her crappy intimidation attempt only made her fleet even bolder...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Golden Hind：</span><br>
I've met that Lyme once. I was doing business when our paths crossed.<br>
She's fought monsters for many years in the Sea of Death, has a strong sense of justice, and hates evil from the bottom of her heart. Worse yet, she has a short fuse, and tends to be rather pushy when dealing with things.<br>
Her fleet is going to sustain heavy losses if this turns into a fight...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">São Martinho：</span><br>
Lyme... I told you not to let your feelings take control.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Lyme：</span><br>
Laws exist to be followed. I will not meet a bunch of vile outlaws halfway.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">São Martinho：</span><br>
That may be true of the monsters you've fought for many years, but their fleet is not a bunch of monsters. You cannot treat them the same.<br>
Allow me to handle this.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Queen Anne's Revenge：</span><br>
Well, well... Want to see who has the bigger cannons, do you?<br>
Try this on for size, then.<br>
<br>
KABOOOM!<br>
The artillery situated in the ruins on the main island fired a volley, its impact creating enormous waves in the water.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">São Martinho：</span><br>
...It is as you say. We do not have the final say in what is to be done with these islands.<br>
The purpose of our excursion here is to, as Nebula Guardians, explore the ruins upon these newfound islands, and evaluate what threats may lurk within them.<br>
I believe you've issued a great number of invitations. Would it therefore be possible for us to join your search team as well?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Queen Anne's Revenge：</span><br>
You're more reasonable than the last one, I'll give you that. However, my answer is "no."<br>
You may go on to claim you have an invitation, but I have no recollection of ever inviting you.<br>
So, be good little uninvited guests and leave.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Lyme：</span><br>
...There is nothing more to be said. São Martinho, prepare for battle.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">São Martinho：</span><br>
......<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Mary Celeste：</span><br>
Hey, is it just me, or is Martinho sending us a signal?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Golden Hind：</span><br>
Seems she was unable to stop it on her own.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Royal Fortune：</span><br>
Oh... Heheh! Well, looks like Tempesta's gonna have to intervene!<br>
Let's give 'em a hand! It'll be good for nobody if a fight really does break out!<br>
{{折叠面板|内容结束}}

{{折叠面板|标题=São Martinho's Concern|选项=14|主框=1|样式=primary|展开=是}}
<br>
Thanks to Tempesta's intervention and explanation, the Nebula Guardians backed off from the islands, and the Vengeful Queen Fleet didn't pursue them.<br>
Later, in the dead of night, Royal Fortune and São Martinho met up on a small and inconspicuous island.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Royal Fortune：</span><br>
Phew... Things got real dodgy earlier today. What were you lot thinking back there?! Were you seriously going to invade Islas de Libertád with such a tiny force?!<br>
For your information, that coastal battery up there is not just for show! It still works!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">São Martinho：</span><br>
Our main force is still behind the lines. Lyme was worried about the ruins, so she left in a hurry.<br>
I did tell Dolphin that we'd be making a move. I didn't expect you all to be here as well.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Royal Fortune：</span><br>
Well, isn't it jolly good that we were? I think we can both guess what would've happened if we weren't.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">São Martinho：</span><br>
That is true...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Royal Fortune：</span><br>
Alright, so what was that about Lyme? What do you mean she was "worried about the ruins"?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">São Martinho：</span><br>
You surely heard the rumors about sea monsters when you went to Limestone Island.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Royal Fortune：</span><br>
Yeah. Even saw the remains of some that Portsmouth Adventure brought along a few days ago.<br>
I had a gander at 'em. Wreckage skelebeasts.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">São Martinho：</span><br>
Yes. With the discovery of Islas de Libertád, skelebeasts suddenly began appearing in Mar del Demonios – a place where they shouldn't live. Moreover, their numbers grow by the day.<br>
We believe all of it links back to these ruins. Someone on the islands may be controlling the monsters, using them as a barrier to protect Islas de Libertád.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Royal Fortune：</span><br>
Uhh... That's probably not the case.<br>
I've been here for quite a while now, and I've not seen a single thing that looks connected to those monsters.<br>
Anne and her crew have even said that the more people come here, the better.<br>
Hell, if anything, she's fuming that they're standing in the way of the islands.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">São Martinho：</span><br>
I see. Well, I have a theory, though it's only a theory.<br>
Queen Anne's Revenge is plotting something. This much I can say with certainty.<br>
She made a big deal out of gathering this many people. It simply does not follow that she did it just to share treasure with others.<br>
For this reason, you should all exercise caution.<br>
The Federation of Polises puts great importance on this place. If things do not go well, it's only a matter of time before an army is sent here.<br>
I've heard that the Church of the Goddess has dispatched a fleet to this place as well.<br>
Lyme is considering working with them, though she does not yet know where they are.<br>
I wish to stress one thing: Do not lower your guard while there is still much we do not know.<br>
I will leave now. I'll contact you again if anything comes up.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Royal Fortune：</span><br>
Oh boy... This treasure hunt is getting a lot more complicated than I hoped.<br>
Thank gosh I prepped so thoroughly before setting off.<br>
Anyway, got it! I'll keep an eye out!<br>
{{折叠面板|内容结束}}

{{折叠面板|标题=Uninvited Guests II|选项=15|主框=1|样式=primary|展开=是}}
<br>
And so, two days passed, and as São Martinho had said, a fleet belonging to the Church of the Goddess arrived on the islands.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Pearl：</span><br>
Goddess's blessings be with you! To think fate would bring us together in such a vast ocean as this.<br>
I am Pearl, servant of the Church. This is Ganj-i-Sawai, a friend of mine.<br>
Miss Anne, would you please allow us to bring the Goddess's light to these free islands?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Queen Anne's Revenge：</span><br>
You lot... Well, you know your manners better than the Nebula Guardians.<br>
But sorry, the answer's no. Islas de Libertád only welcome those who seek liberty. I said it clear as day in the invitation.<br>
That descriptor clearly doesn't fit you, so go away.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Pearl：</span><br>
I see... How unfortunate that we must return home with nothing to show.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ganj-i-Sawai：</span><br>
A shame, truly. I suppose we'll head home.<br>
Farewell, Anne. May you and your followers have a wonderful day!<br>
<br>
The Church's fleet departed with no fanfare or fuss, leaving them with some words of blessing.<br>
Queen Anne's Revenge breathed a relieved sigh. Royal Fortune, however, felt something different after this brief exchange.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Royal Fortune：</span><br>
Hold up, Anne. Something here smells fishy.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Queen Anne's Revenge：</span><br>
Fishy? What is?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Royal Fortune：</span><br>
You may or may not know it, but the Church of the Goddess is utterly obsessed with ancient ruins.<br>
They also collect huge amounts of old relics. They've got so many, just picturing it makes me shudder.<br>
So basically, what you just did was say "no" to two total fanatics, and they simply politely turned around and left.<br>
Their reaction was even milder than the Nebula Guardians'. That just can't be right.<br>
Also, I've run into Ganj-i-Sawai in the past. She's... way, way more calculating than she lets on.<br>
I refuse to believe she'd give up just like that. You all really should be on high alert for the next few days.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Queen Anne's Revenge：</span><br>
So that's the deal with them...<br>
Ta for telling me. I'll inform the others at once.<br>
{{折叠面板|内容结束}}

{{折叠面板|标题=Early Morning Wreckages|选项=16|主框=1|样式=primary|展开=是}}
<br>
The warning from Anne made the Vengeful Queen Fleet highly vigilant. Other fleets who'd set up on their islets even joined their patrols spontaneously.<br>
It was evening that day, and rain had begun pouring.<br>
The weather got even worse when night came as strong winds blew and fierce waves churned.<br>
Yet, despite the storm around them, the people on the islands spent the night on the lookout.<br>
Contrary to their expectations, the day ended peacefully. Too peacefully, perhaps.<br>
As morning rolled around, a patrolling fleet came upon a shocking find.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Adventure：</span><br>
Look, look! Look what we found!<br>
There are loads of wrecks washing ashore!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Golden Hind：</span><br>
...The planks are made in different styles. They must belong to indie sailors or other fleet members.<br>
There's also some coating that only naval forces use. Those must be from the Nebula Guardians.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Queen Anne's Revenge：</span><br>
I see how it is... They were refused entry, so they're waiting outside the islands to ambush the people I invited!<br>
Now they've really gone and bloody done it!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Royal James：</span><br>
Captain, we should sail out there now and give those Nebula Guardians a beating!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Queen Anne's Revenge：</span><br>
That's exactly what we'll do. Those sods will learn what happens when you pick a fight with us!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Royal Fortune：</span><br>
Whoa, Anne, let's take it easy!<br>
If the Nebula Guardians did this, then they're probably working with the Church.<br>
For all we know, they could've laid a trap and are just waiting for us to walk into it!<br>
I know the Nebula Guardians are heavy-handed and cruel, but I don't think they'd go quite THIS far.<br>
I mean, there's got to be an explanation for this.<br>
It just so happens that we – Tempesta – have dealt with both the Guardians and the Church in the past. We can go there and see what's up!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Portsmouth Adventure：</span><br>
Take us with ya!<br>
We went through the Sleepin' Sea together, so there's no way they'll make things hard for us!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Queen Anne's Revenge：</span><br>
*sigh*... Whatever. Do as you wish.<br>
I'll tell the other fleets to get ready for battle... and wait for news from you.<br>

<br>
Tempesta and the treasure hunters departed from the harbor and followed the bread crumb trail of drifting wreckage amid the storm.<br>
As soon as they left Islas de Libertád, however, they came under attack by a group of skelebeasts.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Amity：</span><br>
The skelebeasts have gotten THIS close now?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Royal Fortune：</span><br>
Damn... Those bastards really are here!<br>
At least that means it's possible THEY'RE responsible for the wrecks washing up!<br>
C'mon! Let's work together and break through the siege!<br>
<br>
<br>
After smashing through several waves of skelebeasts, the girls reached the heart of all the fighting.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Lyme：</span><br>
Damned monsters... I know your habits like the back of my hand. Nothing you do can surprise me.<br>
You never stop... You know neither fear nor fatigue...<br>
Then so be it! I will give you the fight you so want!<br>
Perish!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">São Martinho：</span><br>
Lyme, the fleet can't take any more! I'm coming to support you!<br>
Watch your back!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Lyme：</span><br>
Don't worry about me. No monster like this will ever catch me off guard.<br>
You take care of the fleet. I will deal with these things myself!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Royal Fortune：</span><br>
That's the Nebula Guardians, and the Church, and ships from Islas de Libertád... I knew it! They weren't responsible for the wreckages!<br>
Hell, they're the ones holding back the horde of skelebeasts!<br>
We gotta help them!<br>
<br>
<br>
KABOOOM!<br>
While a fierce battle unfolded between the girls and the tide of skelebeasts, a red signal flare suddenly shot up from Islas de Libertád.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Mary Celeste：</span><br>
Hey, isn't that an emergency rendezvous flare?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Golden Hind：</span><br>
Perhaps something has happened back at the islands... Let's hope it's not another skelebeast attack!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Royal Fortune：</span><br>
São Martinho, Ganj-i-Sawai, there's no end to these monsters! Just because we can handle them doesn't mean the other ships can!<br>
We need to fall back to the islands!<br>
They've got the coastal battery, plus favourable geography for defence!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ganj-i-Sawai：</span><br>
While I like the idea, those ladies did just chase us off, so...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Royal Fortune：</span><br>
Look, there are too many enemies! Islas de Libertád must be under attack, too!<br>
Anne will at least be somewhat receptive to your plight, unlike these monsters that you can't reason with!<br>
I'll tell her to listen! Trust me!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Pearl：</span><br>
My, what a magnanimous young lady you are, Royal Fortune. May the Goddess grace you with her blessings.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">São Martinho：</span><br>
You have a point. Given the circumstances, it's the most optimal solution. We're in your debt!<br>
Lyme, remember what we came here for!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Lyme：</span><br>
...Okay. We'll do as she says.<br>
{{折叠面板|内容结束}}

<br>
A while had passed since the fleets entered the islands' territory.<br>
Thanks to the safety and assurance afforded by the ancient yet operational defenses, a sense of relaxation swept over everyone.<br>
Or rather, everyone except for Royal Fortune.<br>
She had had a growing suspicion about Ganj-i-Sawai ever since she reflected on their adventure in the Sleeping Sea. She never did learn why the Commander disappeared so suddenly.<br>
After that, coupled with the sudden attack of the skelebeasts, she was unable to suppress the doubt inside of her, and she decided to ask Ganj-i-Sawai directly.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ganj-i-Sawai：</span><br>
Aww. It hurts my heart that you doubt me so.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Royal Fortune：</span><br>
You would too if you were me. Hey, did you know Porty actually ran into the Commander's fleet sometime after that?<br>
From what she told me, the Commander didn't have a choice in leaving, but was forced to. Care to confirm or deny?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ganj-i-Sawai：</span><br>
Well... Do you know what happened on the day the Commander left?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Royal Fortune：</span><br>
Obviously I do! I just want to hear you say it. I need to be sure that you're not lying!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ganj-i-Sawai：</span><br>
Heh...<br>
As you already know, I held a feast on that day, and I invited the Commander to join me.<br>
But, to my shock, in the middle of our meal, the Commander just vanished into thin air.<br>
I take it you're better acquainted with that phenomenon than I am, no?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Royal Fortune：</span><br>
Of course I do!<br>
So... That's it? You were eating, then the Commander disappeared, and nothing happened after?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ganj-i-Sawai：</span><br>
Yes. It was all quite shocking.<br>
So, I suppose that the Commander indeed was "forced to leave," if you want to put it that way.<br>
For the record, I had absolutely nothing to do with these skelebeasts that attacked out of nowhere.<br>
If I could control them or somesuch, I wouldn't have had to put myself in such danger back in the Sleeping Sea, would I?<br>
There is one thing I haven't told you before, though.<br>
The true reason as to why the Church came to these islands isn't to search the ruins or anything of that nature.<br>
We have received intelligence that a Goddess-level ancient relic is hidden on Islas de Libertád. What we're here to do is to retrieve it.<br>
Oh, and the appearance of the skelebeasts has only lent even more credibility to our intelligence.<br>
They are drawn to the Goddess-level relic on these islands, just as they were drawn to the Goddess's central unit in the Sleeping Sea.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Royal Fortune：</span><br>
"Goddess-level"? You're saying there's something here that's on par with it?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ganj-i-Sawai：</span><br>
That I am. We suspect that a fragment of the Goddess lies out here.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Royal Fortune：</span><br>
Well, Monsters DID appear in Mar del Demonios before you even got here...<br>
Dolphin also said there's some super-duper ridiculous treasure somewhere around here...<br>
Given that, it does all add up.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ganj-i-Sawai：</span><br>
Do you believe me now? I never had any evil intent to begin with.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Royal Fortune：</span><br>
Ahaha... Guess my hunch was way off. Sorry!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ganj-i-Sawai：</span><br>
No, no, I'm just glad that we cleared up this misunderstanding.<br>
There's a chance that the treasure Dolphin spoke of is the same one we're after. You wouldn't already happen to know where it is, would you?<br>
If we're able to seal that relic away, the skelebeasts will have nothing to stick around for, and they'll scatter.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Royal Fortune：</span><br>
We've got it down to a few potential locations, but nothing more than that.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ganj-i-Sawai：</span><br>
Well, since we're still under attack, even being able to narrow down our search radius would help a lot.<br>
Just leave the rest to the Church and our secret arts.<br>
Time waits for no one, so let's go treasure-hunting, shall we?<br>
{{折叠面板|内容结束}}

{{折叠面板|标题=Searching the Ancient Temple|选项=19|主框=1|样式=primary|展开=是}}
<br>
Following her search from several days ago, Dolphin had been able to pin down the "mindblowing treasure" to one of three locations – the ancient temple on the main island, a metallic cave on Isla Segunda, and the great lighthouse on Isla Tercera.<br>
Royal Fortune decided to bring Ganj-i-Sawai to the main island, where the ruins were preserved the best.<br>
On the way there, as they were passing by the Nebula Guardians' temporary base...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Lyme：</span><br>
Royal Fortune, Ganj-i-Sawai, I thank you for your help.<br>
We owe it to you that we made it without sustaining major casualties.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ganj-i-Sawai：</span><br>
We're all allies here, so it's what anyone would've done.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Royal Fortune：</span><br>
Yeah. We're friends, so don't sweat it.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Lyme：</span><br>
Friends, you say...<br>
You're right. From now on, I consider you to be my friends.<br>
Then, as friends, I will give you some advice.<br>
Don't be lulled into a false sense of security. These islands still face danger.<br>
Our supplies are limited. The monsters may be repelled for the time being, but we cannot hole up here forever.<br>
We ought to prepare a breakthrough assault before supplies run out and morale drops.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Royal Fortune：</span><br>
Right! As it so happens, Ganj-i-Sawai and I were just looking for a way to repel them.<br>
If it doesn't work out, I'll tell Anne we need to break through the siege.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Lyme：</span><br>
The Nebula Guardians will take the vanguard.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ganj-i-Sawai：</span><br>
I'll do everything in my power.<br>
But, if it comes to plan B, I'm counting on you.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Lyme：</span><br>
Of course. I will prepare for the eventuality of a battle.<br>
<br>
The two bade goodbye to the Nebula Guardian, then headed toward Queen Anne's Revenge.<br>
Once she was informed of the Church's plans, she took her treasure map and went along on their treasure hunt.<br>
They searched every nook and cranny of the ancient temple. Ganj-i-Sawai and Dolphin even found a couple of hidden chambers along the way.<br>
However, the ancient relic they were looking for was nowhere to be found.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Pearl：</span><br>
*sigh*... It seems the temple was a bust.<br>
As one would expect, you won't find a miracle on your very first attempt...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Royal Fortune：</span><br>
We can't give up already! There's the metallic cave to check out next!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ganj-i-Sawai：</span><br>
Let's save that for tomorrow. I'm sure we're all exhausted after our battles earlier today.<br>
Pearl and I will fine-tune our secret arts, and hopefully raise their efficiency a bit.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Queen Anne's Revenge：</span><br>
I have to agree. They won't breach our defences anytime soon.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Royal Fortune：</span><br>
Alright, then how about we all stop by our base and have supper?<br>
I stocked up on loads and loads of supplies before coming here! We've got curry from Crownpolis to go around!<br>
Just bring some ingredients you want to add, and we'll be good!<br>
See you all there!<br>

<br>
Late was the hour, and the skelebeasts' onslaught still continued.<br>
Amidst the roaring of the ancient battery's cannons, Royal Fortune clutched her wooden compass as she dreamed a dream.<br>
Tranquil seas. A calm beach. The breeze was mild, and the sunlight was warming in this lovely dream.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Royal Fortune：</span><br>
Such a peaceful dream... Well, guess that's pretty nice!<br>
As long as you ignore how there's a battle going on in reality...<br>
<br>
Royal Fortune walked down the beach, feeling the invigorating waves while she picked some coconuts.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Royal Fortune：</span><br>
Mmm! So sweet!<br>
I love dreams with flavours! Would be even better if I had some good nosh, but hey.<br>
Hm? What the...?<br>
<br>
She suddenly realized that her wooden compass was faintly glowing.<br>
The light converged on the tip of the "needle," pointing in a certain direction.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Royal Fortune：</span><br>
Whoa! It's glowing!<br>
Wait, this is a dream, so how come it's glowing?!<br>
Oh! Maybe if I follow it...<br>
<br>
She turned in the direction indicated by the compass and broke into a sprint.<br>
After running for a while, she eventually came across someone who was sleeping in a beach chair.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Zzzzz...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Royal Fortune：</span><br>
HUH?!<br>
W-wait...<br>
Commander?!<br>
{{折叠面板|内容结束}}

{{折叠面板|标题=Reunion|选项=21|主框=1|样式=primary|展开=是}}
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
...Where am I?<br>
<br>
When I come to, I'm on a beach for some reason.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Before I fell asleep... Right, I saw that compass glowing on the bookshelf.<br>
Did the compass beckon me into this dream?<br>
That voice I just heard was oddly familiar, too.<br>
<br>
By the time I recognize the voice, Royal Fortune has already run over to me.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Royal Fortune：</span><br>
Waaaah! Commander, it's really yooou!<br>
I haven't seen you in so long! I never dreamed I'd see you in... well, a dream!<br>
<br>
The girl calling out to me is none other than Royal Fortune, captain of the Tempesta fleet.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
It has been a while... Did the light of the compass lead you here, too?<br>
Wait, but it's in my possession now. How did you come here, then?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Royal Fortune：</span><br>
Huh? You've got the compass?!<br>
Bloody hell, that's brilliant news! With the compass, you can come visit me any time!<br>
As for how I came here myself... Heh, you were right. The compass lit the way!<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Did you find another one for yourself?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Royal Fortune：</span><br>
Not even. I chiselled it from wood myself!<br>
Behold!<br>
<br>
She proudly produces a wooden compass and waves it around in my face.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Royal Fortune：</span><br>
See? Perfect, ain't it?<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Hmm... If I squint really hard, it's kind of similar, sure.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Royal Fortune：</span><br>
Hmph! You don't think it's similar at all! Forget how it looks, though – what matters is that it works!<br>
I've got a lot of questions for you, and I'd wager you have a few for me, too.<br>
<br>
We used this opportunity to exchange a bounty of information.<br>
Royal Fortune and I discussed how the flow of time differed between worlds and how a fleet back at home encountered the treasure hunters.<br>
She divulged the details of Tempesta's treasure hunt in Islas de Libertád and their hairy encounter with wreckage skelebeasts.<br>
That included the fact that the Church of the Goddess was searching for a Goddess-level ancient relic, of course.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Looking back, I disappeared in the middle of eating with Ganj-i-Sawai. Did she say anything about that?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Royal Fortune：</span><br>
Yeah, she did! I was really suspicious about it, but she convinced me when she shared her side of the story.<br>
Don't tell me... Was she the culprit after all?!<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Well, I mean... I won't say no to that, but... Forget it. It's not important right now.<br>
I have something I want to give you.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Royal Fortune：</span><br>
Whoa. Terminal?!<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
It's all yours. When I first saw the compass glow, I decided I should take it along in case it was an omen of things to come.<br>
I'm kinda surprised I was able to bring it into the dream.<br>
There isn't much material help I can offer, but if you're searching for Siren ruins, it may come in handy.<br>
<br>
The waves turn quiet, and the world around us begins to dissolve.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Looks like the dream is ending.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Royal Fortune：</span><br>
Guess so...<br>
I'd be happy to take Terminal along. Bet it'll be a great help!<br>
And you, Commander? Don't undersell yourself – you might be helpful, too.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
How do you reckon?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Royal Fortune：</span><br>
If I can take Terminal with me, then who says I can't take you, too?<br>
Kinda like... THIS!<br>
<br>
She rushes over and pulls me into a bear hug.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Royal Fortune：</span><br>
If I hold you tight enough, maybe you'll still be there when I wake up...<br>
<br>
My vision turns blank white as she whispers into my ear.<br>
{{折叠面板|内容结束}}

{{折叠面板|标题=Exploring the Metallic Cave|选项=22|主框=1|样式=primary|展开=是}}
<br>
When the light dissipated, Royal Fortune awakened in bed.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Royal Fortune：</span><br>
Mmnh... Am I awake?<br>
Commander?!<br>
<br>
She shot up, nearly sending Terminal flying in the process.<br>
However, nobody else was there.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Royal Fortune：</span><br>
Not here, huh...<br>
Damn shame... Who knows when I'll see you again?<br>
<br>
After that complaint, she slapped herself in the cheeks a few times.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Royal Fortune：</span><br>
Cheer up, you twit! At least the Commander sent you back with Terminal!<br>
You're exploring the metallic cave and the lighthouse today. Treasures abound, and they WILL be mindblowing!<br>
<br>
While she gathered personnel and prepared for the day's adventure, a commotion happened to break out at the main island's gathering place.<br>
Yesterday's sudden crisis had led to an impressive display of teamwork among the isles's fleets.<br>
However, the coming of a new day made them restless and rowdy once again.<br>
Fights broke out over patrol schedules, distrust over the Nebula Guardians and the Church of the Goddess, and perceived unfairness in resource allocation.<br>
Fortunately, Queen Anne's Revenge was well prepared for this. She resolved these issues swiftly. Armed with overwhelming support from the various fleets, she established a set of provisional regulations for Islas de Libertád.<br>
Once all was settled, she left them and set sail for Isla Segunda with the Tempesta and Church of the Goddess fleets in search of the day's treasure.<br>
Sheer rock cliffs towered a hundred meters high, forming a natural barrier around the second island.<br>
However, the treasure map opened the way inside for the well-equipped explorers, revealing its secrets.<br>
The island's interior was ancient ruins, and the rock walls were a mere facade that concealed them.<br>
Labyrinthine passages stretched in all directions, even to the clifftops above and depths below. That explained half of why Queen Anne's Revenge had dubbed this place the metallic "cave."<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Queen Anne's Revenge：</span><br>
Following a preliminary investigation of the area above, we've managed to find some valuable supplies.<br>
This is where I found the star map drawn on the invitation – the Resonant Star Chart.<br>
It was after I discovered these items resembling entry tickets that I thought to send the invitation.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Royal Fortune：</span><br>
Huh? I thought they came from the ancient temple on the main island!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Queen Anne's Revenge：</span><br>
Well, you were wrong. My theory is that this cave was used as a warehouse.<br>
Unfortunately, even I don't know if it conceals any hidden rooms like the ancient temple.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Pearl：</span><br>
That's a job for the Church's secret arts!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Royal Fortune：</span><br>
Hah, don't even bother. I have a more efficient solution!<br>
Terminal, scan the cave's structure and discover any hidden passages for us!<br>
Even better, generate a map!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Grimoire Terminal：</span><br>
Orders received. Scanning the structure of the immediate area.<br>
Local database detected. Accessing.<br>
Reading stored data.<br>
Data analysis complete. Displaying facility layout of Compiler's Fortress III's Central Corridor, Section T-02.<br>
<br>
All except for Royal Fortune watched on in slack-jawed surprise as a map of the area was projected in mid-air.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Royal Fortune：</span><br>
Anne, did you draw a map last time you came here? Let's compare them for differences!<br>
<br>
Upon comparing the two maps, the group discovered several differences between them.<br>
With Terminal's help, they took a quick tour of all the hidden rooms.<br>
They found veritable troves of ancient relics, though their uses were unclear at best.<br>
Their greatest rewards, however, were a bounty of high-quality ancient alloys and ancient crystals – objects that could power the Polises' walls, Temples of the Goddess, and virtually all of the ancient ruins sites in Islas de Libertád.<br>
And though by accident, Dolphin managed to deploy the massive cannons hidden in the rock walls, bolstering the island's defenses.<br>
However, the Goddess-level relic that Ganj-i-Sawai spoke of was nowhere to be found.<br>
This left just one final place to be searched.<br>

<br>
Later that night, after an exhausting day of searching the metallic cave, Royal Fortune took her wooden compass in hand and drifted off to dreamland, hopes high in her heart.<br>
In an endless stretch of ocean, rows of tightly-packed Echo Fleet ships stood in line.<br>
This enemy, once thought invincible, had now been forced into a desperate situation.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">？？？：</span><br>
I am... Compiler...<br>
No... I am a ▇▇▇▇▇!<br>
You invaded the ▇▇▇▇▇'s system and altered my ▇▇▇▇▇▇▇▇▇▇'s memory...<br>
Who in the world are you?!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">unknown_undefined：</span><br>
Up in the heavens hung a ball of light that glowed even brighter than the sun.<br>
Inside the light were practically countless, giant eyes that stared down at all the threats below with cold indifference.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">？？？：</span><br>
You made the ▇▇▇▇'s ▇▇▇ into a ▇▇▇▇▇▇▇▇? ▇▇▇▇ ▇▇▇▇▇?!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">unknown_undefined：</span><br>
As the voice's words grew increasingly unintelligible, the ball of light in the sky suddenly ballooned.<br>
The world was enveloped in light.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Royal Fortune：</span><br>
*pant*... *pant*... What the hell was that dream?! That freaked me out!<br>
<br>
Awoken by sheer shock, Royal Fortune almost dropped her wooden compass.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Royal Fortune：</span><br>
That little one called herself "Compiler," didn't she?<br>
But... isn't the Goddess a machine?<br>
And what was that ball of light?<br>
It kinda reminds me of the runes the Federation uses in the Blessing for the Guardian...<br>
But most importantly, why the hell did I dream about it?!<br>
Oh no... All I wanted was to grow my fleet, sail the seven seas, and go on all the adventures I wanted...<br>
Commander, please... Please protect me from getting dragged into this weird stuff from ancient times!<br>

{{折叠面板|标题=Searching the Lighthouse II|选项=24|主框=1|样式=primary|展开=是}}
<br>
Royal Fortune somehow fired herself up, and went to the great lighthouse on Isla Tercera.<br>
En route there, she overheard people talking about the Nebula Guardians proactively wiping out the enemy in nearby waters.<br>
These heroics sparked a fighting spirit in many of the fleets. Morale on the islands was high, despite them now being three days into a siege.<br>
Royal Fortune and company passed through the defensive barrier, and arrived at the foot of the lighthouse.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Pearl：</span><br>
So this is the great lighthouse. What a mysterious aura it exudes.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Dolphin：</span><br>
This is where I sensed it was most likely we'd find a mindblowing treasure!<br>
We still don't know how to get up it, though.<br>
Our original plan was to launch me to the top with a cannon so I could lower a rope for the rest of you, but, well...<br>
That's when the skelebeasts attacked, and we never got the chance to try it.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Royal Fortune：</span><br>
Heh! Now we have Terminal, and we don't need no cannon or rope!<br>
Terminal, open the door!<br>
<br>
Her trusty companion did not let them down.<br>
After just a quick scan, Terminal activated a set of hidden doors, allowing the group to search the lighthouse's interior.<br>
To their surprise, however, there was absolutely nothing inside it except for a spiral staircase leading upward.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Royal Fortune：</span><br>
Hmm... We're almost at the top, yet we've not found a thing.<br>
Dolphin, is your treasure sense tingling?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Dolphin：</span><br>
Nuh-uh. I think the treasure's higher up!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Pearl：</span><br>
My Church arts are pointing further upward as well...<br>
Therefore, what we're looking for must be at the top of the lighthouse!<br>
<br>
And so, the group arrived at the summit of the lighthouse.<br>
They found no lamp there in the center, only a pillar made of a black, metallic material.<br>
The first to begin inspecting it were none other than the two envoys from the Church of the Goddess.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ganj-i-Sawai：</span><br>
"O Goddess, lend us your wisdom to see through this mystery..."<br>
<br>
Ganj-i-Sawai scooped out a handful of liquid flame from a lantern she had brought, smearing it on Pearl's forehead and palms.<br>
Pearl then set her sights on a particular spot of the pillar and gently touched it with her left hand.<br>
The pillar let out a buzzing sound.<br>
Countless metallic plates began to shift up and down and split apart, beginning from the spot that she touched.<br>
They were like the throbbing scales of some enormous beast made of steel. Through the cracks, a red light slipped in and out of view.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ganj-i-Sawai：</span><br>
"O Goddess, may your light illuminate the path..."<br>
<br>
Ganj-i-Sawai took out another handful of flame from the lantern, this time applying it to Pearl's staff.<br>
Then, Pearl held the staff up, and firmly struck the spot she had touched with her hand.<br>
The strike from the staff made the metallic plates vanish instantly in a burst of flame, revealing an object hidden within the pillar.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Royal Fortune：</span><br>
What the...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Queen Anne's Revenge：</span><br>
A metallic ball?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Dolphin：</span><br>
Oh! This is it! The mindblowing treasure!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ganj-i-Sawai：</span><br>
Compiler's Eyes...<br>
Oh no! Ladies, look out!<br>
<br>
With the wall of metal gone, the metallic sphere so-named "Compiler's Eyes" lay itself bare.<br>
Without any warning, it shot out a dazzling beam of light toward the sky.<br>
The beam dispelled the abnormal night sky hanging above Islas de Libertád. This also ignited a ferociousness within the blocked-out skelebeasts.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Queen Anne's Revenge：</span><br>
Ah! The night-sky barrier's gone!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Royal James：</span><br>
Oh no! Look! The skelebeasts have all gone mental and are coming for us!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ganj-i-Sawai：</span><br>
I understand now. The metal pillar of the lighthouse is a device meant to confine Compiler's Eyes.<br>
Its sealing effects were waning after so many years, and that's why the skelebeasts were drawn to it.<br>
Now, with the seal completely undone, they've begun rampaging.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Royal Fortune：</span><br>
Lyme and São Martinho are still out there, fighting!<br>
They're gonna be surrounded any minute now! We have to hurry and help them!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Queen Anne's Revenge：</span><br>
...I'll call in supporting fire.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ganj-i-Sawai：</span><br>
We should probably split up. The rest of you, go and help those two. We will stay and prepare a ritual to reseal Compiler's Eyes.<br>
If we're successful, the skelebeasts should be left with no reason to attack this place. They'll be gone before long.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Royal Fortune：</span><br>
Well, be quick about it! Girls, follow me!<br>

<br>
KABOOOM!<br>
Amidst a veritable wave of skelebeasts, Lyme and São Martinho dashed forward with great courage.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">São Martinho：</span><br>
This scene... It feels familiar.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Lyme：</span><br>
Heh. It does.<br>
Without the supporting fire from the island's batteries, this would've been a nightmare.<br>
Not so much anymore.<br>
We have the upper hand. Our opponents may be numerous, but we just have to stay calm and kill them one at a time.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Royal Fortune：</span><br>
Oooi! Lyyyme! São Martinhooo!<br>
Something's thrown the monsters into a frenzy! We've come to help you get out of here!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Lyme：</span><br>
Ah, Tempesta. Good timing.<br>
Do you see the Lord-class skelebeast up ahead? Let's cut it down together.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Royal Fortune：</span><br>
Uh! Sorry if I wasn't clear, but we've come to get you the hell out of here!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Lyme：</span><br>
There's no time to turn around. Charge it head-on!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Royal Fortune：</span><br>
What?! Okay, fine!<br>
<br>
<br>
KABOOOM!<br>
Amidst booming explosions, the colossal Lord-class skelebeast sank beneath the waves.<br>
Following this, the maddened and rampaging other skelebeasts began to gradually settle down. Seeing their leader defeated, they scattered one by one.<br>
It was at this time that the group realized that the light shining from the great lighthouse was gone again.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Royal Fortune：</span><br>
Phew... Seems Ganj-i-Sawai's sealing ritual worked!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Lyme：</span><br>
"Sealing ritual"?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Royal Fortune：</span><br>
Ah, well, basically...<br>
<br>
Royal Fortune briefly explained what happened over at the lighthouse.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Lyme：</span><br>
I see. So it was sealed off.<br>
Okay. Let's head back.<br>
{{折叠面板|内容结束}}

{{折叠面板|标题=Libertypolis|选项=26|主框=1|样式=primary|展开=是}}
<br>
With Compiler's Eyes sealed anew, the skelebeasts that had besieged Islas de Libertád now dispersed.<br>
The strange starry sky hanging over the isles also disappeared along with the veil that once protected them.<br>
However, bright sunlight washed over the islands now, lifting the haze that had hung over them and making them a more comfortable place to live.<br>
With this, danger had finally passed.<br>
After a grand celebration, everyone resumed their daily routines... that is, until Queen Anne's Revenge summoned everyone for a great announcement.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Queen Anne's Revenge：</span><br>
Friends, adventurers in search of freedom, comrades in arms!<br>
On the dawn of our great victory, I must ask you.<br>
Do you remember why you first set out for adventure?<br>
For fame? For fortune? For a life of freedom? For all of these reasons and more, perhaps.<br>
But how did you feel along the way?<br>
All of us seek freedom, not bloodshed, yet the Federation of Polises has continuously oppressed us.<br>
Ever more rules, ever more restrictions. They choose to give us only two options.<br>
We can either be subservient to the Federation of Polises, to be used at their behest and discarded at their convenience...<br>
...Or we can let their rules tighten around our necks like a noose, little by little, and let them wring us for all we're worth.<br>
As for me, I don't like either option.<br>
That's why I chose not to monopolise Islas de Libertád for myself. Why I invited you all to come and share in their bounty.<br>
The results speak for themselves, don't you think?<br>
We are strong. Before our combined might, even hordes of monsters are dust in the wind.<br>
Before our combined might, the Federation of Polises and Church of the Goddess cannot deny us sovereignty!<br>
Yes, we have lost the curtain of stars that guides us as a result of our battle.<br>
But let that symbolise the freedom to make a new path. Let anyone who craves liberty be free to come and join us.<br>
These are Islas de Libertád. Just as I named them, they are a home for all who yearn for freedom from oppression!<br>
And they will become our own Polis. The archipelago of Libertypolis!<br>
Thus, I hereby declare the establishment of Libertypolis, a nation for all adventurers who desire freedom!<br>
All who love liberty and are willing to abide by our laws will be welcomed and honoured as citizens of our free state!<br>
<br>
The crowd stirred.<br>
The sailors of Islas de Libertád were naturally overjoyed, but there were others who felt it necessary to speak up – especially Lyme.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Lyme：</span><br>
Queen Anne's Revenge, have you lost your mind?<br>
The Federation of Polises won't stand for this act, and they certainly won't acknowledge the sovereignty of an illegal Polis.<br>
You're making an enemy of the entire federation, you know.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Queen Anne's Revenge：</span><br>
Then let them be my enemy.<br>
I never asked anyone for permission to establish a free state, least of all the corrupt Federation of Polises.<br>
Since you contributed to our victory, and I consider you a guest for now, I'll let that remark slide.<br>
Of course, you're more than welcome to a reward based on your contributions. Does that sound fair?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Lyme：</span><br>
Not interested.<br>
If that's all, we'll be leaving now.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Queen Anne's Revenge：</span><br>
Goodbye.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">São Martinho：</span><br>
Watch yourselves, sailors of the Vengeful Queen...<br>
<br>
As expected, the Nebula Guardians departed without delay. Queen Anne's Revenge then turned her attention to the Church's fleet, who'd watched on in silence.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ganj-i-Sawai：</span><br>
The Church typically doesn't meddle in inter-Polis affairs.<br>
If the Federation formally acknowledges your sovereignty, then you will naturally become our allies.<br>
If they do not... well, things could take an ugly turn.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Queen Anne's Revenge：</span><br>
Hmm. Well, I won't detain you.<br>
I am well aware of the Church's contributions to the success of our war effort.<br>
Would you like a token of our gratitude before you leave?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ganj-i-Sawai：</span><br>
I heard you gifted a small island to every fleet that came to the isles. Is that right?<br>
What if you were to offer one to the Church as well?<br>
Building a temple on your land would let us offer direct aid to those in need... and may serve as a useful bargaining tool in the future.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Queen Anne's Revenge：</span><br>
I have to apologise, but as I alluded to before, we only welcome those who love freedom.<br>
That would exclude the clergy of the Church of the Goddess.<br>
You may request something else.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ganj-i-Sawai：</span><br>
...Ugh. Then I would ask that you allow us to take the ancient relic back to the Church for proper storage and care.<br>
As you're well aware, the seal on the relic must be reinforced regularly, and only the Church can perform the sealing ritual.<br>
If neglected, the seal will eventually weaken and attract monster hordes yet again.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Queen Anne's Revenge：</span><br>
...You considered that a "Goddess-level" relic, didn't you? I understand it's very important to you.<br>
It would only beckon danger in our hands. Take it.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ganj-i-Sawai：</span><br>
Thank you very much.<br>
Incidentally, about the reward you intended to give the Nebula Guardians... May I deliver it to them in your stead?<br>
They've suffered their fair share of casualties in these past few days' conflict.<br>
Lyme refused out of stubborn pride, but she will be in a very difficult position if she returns home empty-handed.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Queen Anne's Revenge：</span><br>
Well, aren't you just the sweetest? Be my guest. Make them owe you one.<br>
We have no shortage of treasure, so load some up onto your ships before you go.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ganj-i-Sawai：</span><br>
Thank you. We'll prepare to depart at once.<br>
<br>
After successful negotiations with the Church, Queen Anne's Revenge shifted her focus to the Tempesta fleet.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Queen Anne's Revenge：</span><br>
Royal Fortune. Do you support the establishment of Libertypolis?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Royal Fortune：</span><br>
Huh? Me?<br>
Umm, well, I think everyone knows how the Federation of Polises has treated you.<br>
They've only gotten more overbearing, so it's good to have a safe haven like this.<br>
But, you know, managing a city-state takes more than just passion...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Queen Anne's Revenge：</span><br>
Of course. That's why I intend to craft our laws based on the Tempesta code.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Royal Fortune：</span><br>
Say what?!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Queen Anne's Revenge：</span><br>
For people who love freedom, all we need is a basic level of common understanding and rules. Isn't that right, everyone?<br>
<br>
The crowd cheered in response.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Queen Anne's Revenge：</span><br>
Let's drink the night away, everyone!<br>
To the birth of Libertypolis! Cheers!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Royal Fortune：</span><br>
Ooh... Ch-cheers!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Portsmouth Adventure：</span><br>
Cheers!<br>
<br>
Whatever the future may hold, on this day, Islas de Libertád were all feast and revelry.<br>
The establishment of Libertypolis would mark the first chapter of a new age in Federation history.<br>

<br>
A shipgirl was performing a ceremonial dance in a vast room.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ganj-i-Sawai：</span><br>
"O Goddess, let this prayer carry you to a safe place."<br>
<br>
As the light withdrew, Ganj-i-Sawai's dance came to a stop.<br>
So, too, did the mysterious ritual she was conducting.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ganj-i-Sawai：</span><br>
We have the eyes that discern... All that's left are the wings that give shape.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Fancy：</span><br>
The area revealed by the Goddess mainframe is dangerous.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ganj-i-Sawai：</span><br>
I know, I know...<br>
Our next move demands a more thorough plan.<br>
With the eyes that discern, creating the ideal plan should be an easy feat.<br>
Something elaborate, yet foolproof...<br>
No matter what, the Goddess must make her return.<br>
Otherwise, our future holds only death and destruction.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Fancy：</span><br>
Yes.<br>

<br>
After returning home from Islas de Libertád, Tempesta got to work moving.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Royal Fortune：</span><br>
Tempesta Island...<br>
Heheh... Our own island... Tempesta Island!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Whydah：</span><br>
Terminal... *sniffle*... Terminal, you're finally home...<br>
I'm never letting you out of my sight again!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Mary Celeste：</span><br>
With a whole island to ourselves, we can build whatever we want.<br>
Maybe I'll make a luxurious underwater suite for Argo.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Golden Hind：</span><br>
...We still can't abandon this trading post, but if people flock to Islas de Libertád, then business will boom, too...<br>
What if we move HQ over there?<br>
Just a what-if, since we don't know how the Federation will react.<br>
Meh... We can only take things one step at a time. First things first, we set up a trading post on Tempesta Island...<br>
<br>
Everyone dreamed of the future, some excited and some anxious.<br>
Just then, there was a knock at the door. Dolphin had returned with news from afar.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Royal Fortune：</span><br>
So Galley says the Federation of Polises is taking action?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Dolphin：</span><br>
Yep! The Federation Council is gathering representatives from every Polis to a big meeting in Crownpolis!<br>
Galley's going with the representative of Stellapolis. She said not to move to Islas de Libertád until we know what the Federation's plans are!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Mary Celeste：</span><br>
Ugh... Can't they just get over it?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Golden Hind：</span><br>
They're using the illegal establishment of a Polis as an excuse, but they really just want the land and ruins there...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Whydah：</span><br>
But hasn't Vengeful Queen already taken over the islands' defensive facilities?<br>
Even the Federation of Polises has to baulk at those huge cannons...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Royal Fortune：</span><br>
Hmm... Whatever the case, we're already in an alliance with Vengeful Queen. There's no ignoring this now.<br>
I'm going to Crownpolis myself! You all take a break at Limestone Island and wait for word from me!<br>

<br>
When the light fades, I see my bedroom ceiling again.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Guess it couldn't be that easy, Royal Fortune.<br>
<br>
Still feeling her lingering warmth, I look around my room.<br>
The compass has stopped glowing, and Terminal is gone.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
At least I managed to deliver Terminal to her. Hopefully that will give Tempesta the extra boost they need to make it out of danger.<br>
All I can do now is pray.<br>
The Virtual Tower acting up, people constantly flooding in and out from other worlds, and now Tempesta...<br>
If our world has such a thing as a boundary, then it must be getting weaker by the day.<br>
DOS...<br>
...Fine by me. If danger comes, then we'll stand and fight it.<br>
There's no point in agonizing over things that might never happen. Gotta live in the moment.<br>
Time to wash my face, eat breakfast... and get to work.<br>
