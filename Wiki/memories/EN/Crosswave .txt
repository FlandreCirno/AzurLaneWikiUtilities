Suruga, Sally Forth!<br>
Port - Exercise Area<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Suruga：</span><br>
In this exercise scenario, our fleet will ambush another fleet led by the Commander.<br>
As I'm sure you all know, this will be similar to the friendly spars we've had with the Royal Navy and Eagle Union in the past; it is merely an exercise.<br>
However, its goal isn't solely for our fleet to gain more experience; it's also meant to strengthen bonds among factions, and more importantly, to expose us to different combat formations and unexpected scenarios.<br>
And so, as per Mikasa's advice, I shall serve as the commander of the Sakura Fleet since I have not become a full-fledged member of this naval base yet.<br>
I'm sure many of you who have never seen me before are confused or upset by this decision.<br>
But I, Battleship Suruga, promise to dedicate my body and spirit to carry out this task!<br>
Now, let's get ourselves ready and see this exercise through to the end!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Mikasa：</span><br>
That was a rousing speech, Suruga. I knew it wasn't a mistake to summon you here.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Suruga：</span><br>
Thank you. I shall give it my all to ensure that this joint exercise is conducted successfully.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Mikasa：</span><br>
Of course. For this exercise, you are the one in charge, not me. I trust that you will be able to fully display the Sakura Fleet's majesty and honor to the Commander.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Suruga：</span><br>
............ Of course.<br>
Next, I shall announce our combat strategy and formations...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Yukikaze：</span><br>
Wa ha hah! Just call upon Yukikaze the Great, and Commander's fleet will fall in the blink of an eye!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Taihou：</span><br>
We can't have that happening. I have waited for this exercise for so long, and I want to truly savor each moment as my Commander's opponent.<br>
Suruga, would you please have me deployed to the area where my dear Commander will be waiting for me?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Suruga：</span><br>
......<br>
I will take it into consideration. I'm aware this is simply an exercise, but my deployment decisions must be based on logic and take the mission's goal into account...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Taihou：</span><br>
Hmm, very well. We must do our best for my Commander, after all.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Yukikaze：</span><br>
I hate to admit it, but this fleet is called the Suruga Fleet, not the Yukikaze Fleet... so just this once, I'll follow your orders, Suruga!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Suruga：</span><br>
......<br>
R-right... I shall do everything that I can...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Mikasa：</span><br>
Sorry for putting you through all this trouble.<br>

The Lucky Ship's Initiative<br>
Port - Exercise Area<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Suruga：</span><br>
I'm astonished. They responded to my strategies by immediately redeploying their forces and adjusting their weaponry with precision.<br>
Perhaps that's not very surprising, though. Who would be more familiar with this fleet's capabilities than the Commander, after all?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Mikasa：</span><br>
Suruga, how does the battle fare?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Suruga：</span><br>
We are in an engagement on the frontlines. As for how it's faring... not quite as expected. Our opponents are advancing faster than I expected.<br>
Though it would be possible to sortie our main fleet to meet theirs head-on, avoiding that engagement to lure them deeper in might be the wiser option.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Mikasa：</span><br>
Ah, you plan to wait until their advance is at its breaking point to strike them full-force.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Suruga：</span><br>
Indeed. However, I still haven't decided who would be best suited to lure the opponent towards us...<br>
Perhaps it would be best to withdraw our vanguard fleet...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Yukikaze：</span><br>
There's no need for that!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Suruga：</span><br>
Yukikaze?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Yukikaze：</span><br>
If you need someone to lure our opponents in, then Yukikaze the Great will do it! Just give me the order!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Suruga：</span><br>
I appreciate your initiative, but considering the speed of the opponent's advance, our fleet wouldn't even be ready to intercept them.<br>
In other words, we'll also need some way of buying time while luring them. Do you have any ideas on how to do that, Yukikaze?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Yukikaze：</span><br>
Heheh! We don't need any cheap tricks for that! This is nothing that cannot be solved with Yukikaze the Great's extraordinary luck!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Suruga：</span><br>
... Come again?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Yukikaze：</span><br>
Well, that's what I would normally say, but I'll be counting on you to back me up if anything goes wrong.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Suruga：</span><br>
I, I see... Then, I will do whatever I can to support you.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Mikasa：</span><br>
Hahahah! You two seem like quite the promising pair! Now go out there and seize victory!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Yukikaze：</span><br>
You can count on Yukikaze to get it done! Wa hah hah!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Suruga：</span><br>
... A-affirmative!<br>

A Leader's Prowess<br>
Port - Exercise Area<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Yukikaze：</span><br>
They got meeeee!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Suruga：</span><br>
Another dead end... Yukikaze, fall back to our line of defense! Taihou and I will cover you!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Taihou：</span><br>
You certainly know how to work someone hard... Yukikaze, now!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Yukikaze：</span><br>
Understood! ... I mean, consider yourselves off the hook for now!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Suruga：</span><br>
Somehow, we managed to fend off the Commander's onslaught... But as the battle gets drawn out, we'll surely get whittled down...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Yukikaze：</span><br>
Grrr... How is it possible that not even Yukikaze the Great could put a halt to the Commander's fleet...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Taihou：</span><br>
It seems we're at a loss. We can adjust our strategy all we want, but Commander's fleet seems to always be a step ahead of us.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Yukikaze：</span><br>
There are Eagle Union ships that have managed it before, you know...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Taihou：</span><br>
And, while I wouldn't mind suffering a crushing defeat at my Commander's hands, that would reflect poorly on the Sakura Empire's reputation...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Suruga：</span><br>
I'll admit, one's motivation starts to diminish when a battle feels as one-sided as this... Having said that, we must not resort to using cheap tricks, like Yukikaze said...<br>
......<br>
They're forcing my hand...!<br>
Taihou, Yukikaze, please listen. I have an idea for how we can turn this around.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Yukikaze：</span><br>
But how? And let me just get this out of the way; I might be lucky, but even I can't magically triple our fleet power!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Taihou：</span><br>
There's still a way for us to get the upper hand in this situation?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Suruga：</span><br>
Yes. By ignoring all the other opponents and going straight for the Commander.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Yukikaze：</span><br>
No way! Not even Yukikaze the Great could plow through to the center of that massive fleet...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Suruga：</span><br>
You won't be alone. We'll bait the ship the Commander is on to come here, then attack all at once.<br>
It doesn't matter if you use cannons or bombs, just take out that flagship! Got it?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Taihou：</span><br>
But how do you know where the Commander is?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Suruga：</span><br>
Why, I thought you of all people would know, Taihou... Would you mind doing some recon for us?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Taihou：</span><br>
Me?! ... Need I even answer that question? I would absolutely love to locate the Commander!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Suruga：</span><br>
Appreciate it. I'll give you specific instructions later, so for now just try not to let the Commander catch wind of our plan.<br>
Set sail!<br>

<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Suruga：</span><br>
Good. Keep this up, and we'll be able to lure them over before they breach our last line of defense.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Yukikaze：</span><br>
We still aren't done?! Yukikaze the Great may be second to none, but even I don't have limitless stamina!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Suruga：</span><br>
Just hold on a bit longer! But we're also nearly out of time! Taihou, any news?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Taihou：</span><br>
I can smell it! This is my dear Commander's fragrance... Hehehehe...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Suruga：</span><br>
Great! Yukikaze, once you're at the location I told you about, turn around and head back at maximum speed! We'll get them in a pincer attack!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Yukikaze：</span><br>
Understood! And how's it going for you over there?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Suruga：</span><br>
I'm drawing closer to the opponent! ... *Sigh*, and I wish I wasn't. Why did I agree to this in the first place...<br>
But it's fine... At this range, everything turns into an all-out brawl, and it'll be impossible to keep track of what every ship is doing. This is my best opportunity.<br>
Taihou, do you read me? I've transferred my flagship status to you! The moment my gunfire stops, send your bombers over to my location!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Yukikaze：</span><br>
Are you seriously going to thrust deep into the Commander's fleet all on your own?!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Taihou：</span><br>
This isn't what you promised! Didn't we agree I would be the one to dive straight into the Commander's heart?!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Suruga：</span><br>
You're a carrier; that's not happening! And keep your mind on your recon! If we lose sight of the Commander, the whole mission will fail!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Taihou：</span><br>
Fine! But just this one time!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Yukikaze：</span><br>
D-did you just get Taihou to back down?!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Suruga：</span><br>
Wait, is this really the right time to be cracking a joke?<br>
<br>
————<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Suruga：</span><br>
Thank you for having faith in my command, Yukikaze, Taihou!<br>
Now's the time! I'll show them what a Kii-class battleship is capable of! Chaaaaaarge!<br>

Suruga's Saga<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Mikasa：</span><br>
Yukikaze, Taihou, and of course, Suruga, you've all done me proud. Even the Commander has praised your outstanding performance during this exercise.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Yukikaze：</span><br>
You had me worried at the end there! Thank goodness we only use blanks for exercises!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Taihou：</span><br>
And you got within such close range of my Commander... I demand you give me that privilege the next time, Suruga!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Mikasa：</span><br>
Ahahahah! It's fantastic to see you in such high spirits immediately after an exercise! I say we have Aoba write a special news report on your exploits today.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Suruga：</span><br>
A... a whole report?!<br>
Sorry, but I would MUCH prefer not to!<br>
(Looking back, I really wasn't expecting all this to happen...)<br>
And so, as per Mikasa's advice, I shall serve as the commander of the Sakura Fleet since I have not become a full-fledged member of this naval base yet.<br>
(I only agreed to it because I was expecting that position to be purely honorary and not require me to make any decisions!)<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Yukikaze：</span><br>
Heheh! We don't need any cheap tricks for that! This is nothing that cannot be solved with Yukikaze the Great's extraordinary luck!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Suruga：</span><br>
(Ugh... I really can't deal with these empty-headed optimists who can't seem to take anything seriously...)<br>
(But, you know, we're still in this together, which means I can't just throw her under the bus! And that in turn means I have to work even harder!)<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Taihou：</span><br>
And, while I wouldn't mind suffering a crushing defeat at my Commander's hands, that would reflect poorly on the Sakura Empire's reputation...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Suruga：</span><br>
(You don't say! And how in the world could I have known the Commander's fleet would be so powerful?!)<br>
(Of course they'd mop the floor with us if I didn't pull out some clever trick! I had no choice, you know? Do you really think I like standing out like this?)<br>
(Oh, and the Commander knows all of you well enough to see right through your plans, right? But as an outsider, things were different for me.)<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Yukikaze：</span><br>
You had me worried at the end there! Thank goodness we only use blanks for exercises!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Taihou：</span><br>
And you got within such close range of my Commander... I demand you give me that privilege the next time, Suruga!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Suruga：</span><br>
(An outsider... That's what I am... But nobody here treated me like one...)<br>
<br>
What if... this is where I belong...?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Mikasa：</span><br>
Correct. There is no gap between ships that have a service history and those that lack it.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Suruga：</span><br>
...... Yes.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Mikasa：</span><br>
So what do you say, Suruga? Won't you become an official member of our fleet?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Suruga：</span><br>
I'm...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Mikasa：</span><br>
Considering your exercise performance, you might get accustomed to life here even quicker than those girls from the development dock. Hahaha!<br>
You have plenty of time. Ponder it for a while and do what your heart says is right.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Suruga：</span><br>
………………<br>
(She's right. This might be where I, and that speedy, annoying little destroyer belong...)<br>
Let us meet again soon...<br>
