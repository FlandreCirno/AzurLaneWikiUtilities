<br>
And so, the curtains rise on a small conflict.<br>
The victor will seize the treasure, whilst the loser will walk away empty-handed.<br>
This conflict, compared to the immeasurable vastness of the ocean, is unbelievably tiny...<br>
<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Royal Fortune：</span><br>
Fire! Fire!<br>
It's the early bird who gets the New World booty!<br>
<br>
KABOOOM!<br>
Amid thundering cannon fire, the warship's opponent turned tail and fled.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Royal Fortune：</span><br>
Hahaha! I won!<br>
Another glorious victory to my name, another heap of–<br>
<br>
CRACK! BOOOOOM!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Royal Fortune：</span><br>
Whoa!<br>
What was that?! A storm out of the blue?!<br>
I need to lower my sails, right now!<br>
Dammit! I won't make it in time!<br>
This is NOT the kind of high-octane adventure I signed up fooooor!<br>
<br>
The warship, with all her sails hoisted, hurtled headfirst into the storm.<br>
...<br>
......<br>

<br>
Thalassopolis - Barren beach<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Royal Fortune：</span><br>
Mmm... Yummy...<br>
Roast meat on a skewer...<br>
Wait, roast meat?<br>
<br>
The aspiring great pirate I "know" so well opens her eyes. Almost instinctually, her eyes fixate on the barbacoa placed next to her.<br>
Then, she looks at me...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Royal Fortune：</span><br>
That uniform...<br>
You're... an officer from the Admiralty?!<br>
What's the navy doing here?!<br>
And where'd ya get this barbacoa? Don't lie and say YOU made it!<br>
I don't trust you one bit! En garde!<br>
<br>
This is the last way I expected her to react!<br>
<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项1：(Block her attack.)</span>'''''<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项2：(Try the diplomatic approach.)</span>'''''<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Royal Fortune：</span><br>
Nice try, Admiralty lapdog!<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
(Oh boy... She refuses to listen.)<br>
(No two ways about it. I need to knock some sense into her first.)<br>
(Phew. It's over.)<br>
(I managed to beat her, if only barely.)<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Royal Fortune：</span><br>
How'd this happen?!<br>
I can't believe I actually lost...<br>
<br>
She gets bummed out over her defeat.<br>
I do my best to console and calm her down...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Royal Fortune：</span><br>
So you already know who I am...<br>
What's more, you aren't with the Admiralty, AND you supposedly came from another world?<br>
And it was because of some golden compass? Hmm... Never heard a second thing about that...<br>
But whatever, I'll believe you!<br>
Nobody who makes barbacoa this tasty would ever lie to me like that♪<br>
You said you ended up here after sailing through a storm, right? That sounds like something out of a pirate legend.<br>
It also sounds like something I wanna do someday. Sail through the mist of night, arrive in another world, and then dig into a great feast~<br>
Those kinds of tales were all the rage in Thalassopolis long ago. Nowadays, everyone only cares about venturing out to the New World.<br>
<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项1：The "New World"?</span>'''''<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项2：Thalassopolis? Where is that?</span>'''''<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Royal Fortune：</span><br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项1）</span>'''''Yeah. It's a landmass that was discovered this last century! Just sail to the end of the world and you'll get there.<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项1）</span>'''''It's way larger than the island cluster that is Thalassopolis, because it's a whole continent!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Royal Fortune：</span><br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项2）</span>'''''Uh, right where we're standing? Some people call it the Old World.<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项2）</span>'''''It's an island cluster, if you didn't know. There are theories that this place used to be one big continent, but nobody's found proof of that yet.<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项2）</span>'''''While it's rich in resources, there is hardly anything left to discover.<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项2）</span>'''''Unlike the New World, which is a whole continent ripe for adventure!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Royal Fortune：</span><br>
And it calls for me! I want to go to the New World!<br>
I've already got a clipper, which will get me there in just about a month!<br>
...Speaking of my ship, where is she?<br>
<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项1：(Gesture towards the planks in the water.)</span>'''''<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Royal Fortune：</span><br>
What? Are ya saying you made it out of the storm thanks to my ship?<br>
Well, you're welcome...<br>
Oh, who am I kidding!<br>
My poor ship! All that's left of her is a few planks!<br>
I just built her, too! Her maiden voyage wasn't even that long ago!<br>
<br>
......<br>
<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项1：There, there. It's not the end of the world.</span>'''''<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Royal Fortune：</span><br>
I know, I know... No use crying over spilt milk.<br>
I'm not giving up on my great adventure so easily. I still need to go to the New World.<br>
To do that, I'm going to need a new ship.<br>
Once I have one, you're coming with me!<br>
Don't you worry – the strings of fate tie us together, so I won't mistreat you!<br>
And if we find a heap of treasure, we'll upgrade to a warship made of gold!<br>
With shared ownership, of course. Fifty-fifty.<br>
Then, after that...<br>
<br>
Royal Fortune continues rambling on for a long time.<br>
A long, long, long time...<br>

<br>
I follow Royal Fortune, and the two of us arrive at a high place with a great view over the surrounding area.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Royal Fortune：</span><br>
Hey, see that clipper?<br>
No, not by the dock. The one over there!<br>
<br>
She points her finger towards a ship anchored behind a building.<br>
It looks like a corvette, with quite powerful armaments.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
(Why would the captain anchor her in such an out-of-sight place?)<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Royal Fortune：</span><br>
That'll do! She'll be our new ship!<br>
I'll betcha the owner won't even care if we commandeer her for ourselves! Heheh!<br>
I've already got a new name for her. It's going to be... the Royal Fortune!<br>
<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项1：Okay... So how do we do this?</span>'''''<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Royal Fortune：</span><br>
All we have to do is sneak aboard, grab the steering wheel, and sail out like it's nobody's business. Easy.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Sail out? Just the two of us?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Royal Fortune：</span><br>
Yeah. Unless you were planning on bringing friends.<br>
I can even do it myself if you're not up to the task.<br>
...Oh, I get it. You think that's a pre-Naval Code vessel, don'tcha?<br>
As long as you have a core, you can operate these new warships with just one crew member.<br>
Hell, you don't even need to keep your hands on the actual steering wheel.<br>
<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项1：Is that Cube technology?</span>'''''<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项2：Ah, the wonders of automation.</span>'''''<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Royal Fortune：</span><br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项1）</span>'''''Huh? Techno-what?<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项1）</span>'''''I'll just assume that's what you call warships in your world.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Royal Fortune：</span><br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项2）</span>'''''Autumn-nation...?<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项2）</span>'''''You mean automatons? Like those tin men in children's stories?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Royal Fortune：</span><br>
What I'M talking about are warships built according to the Naval Code that was discovered.<br>
See, long ago–<br>
<br>
DIIING! DOOONG!<br>
The clangs of a big bell suddenly echo through the air.<br>
The sounds are accompanied by the quieter but quicker rings of a smaller bell.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Royal Fortune：</span><br>
They've sounded the city centre bell?<br>
Is someone attacking this city? That can't be right... Nobody's bold enough for that.<br>
Lend me your telescope! I need to see what flag the church has hoisted!<br>
Found it! That one means... What?! The Echo Fleet is attacking!<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
The Echo Fleet? What's that?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Royal Fortune：</span><br>
A mechanical fleet that roams the seas. It attacks any ship along its course, yet it never plunders anything.<br>
Scholars say it's a remnant from ancient times, but not even they know where it actually came from.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
(That sounds awfully familiar...)<br>
<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项1：Do you know what the Sirens are?</span>'''''<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Royal Fortune：</span><br>
Sirens? Those monster-women of the sea, right?<br>
...No? That's not what you mean?<br>
Look, let's save the sailor stories for later!<br>
Right now, we've got to seize that warship!<br>
Come on! I know a secret way around!<br>

{{折叠面板|标题=Coming to the Rescue|选项=4|主框=1|样式=primary|展开=是}}
<br>
Gently, the clipper emerges from the shadow of the dock and sails out to the side of the port.<br>
I look at the fire rising from the city, and my heart begins to wave just like the flames.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
It looks like the attackers caught the defense fleet completely off guard.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Royal Fortune：</span><br>
That's not surprising. The Echo Fleet has never raided a city directly before.<br>
I doubt the navy is going to hold up much longer before they're crushed.<br>
What to do... We could try to help, but how?<br>
Come on, quick! Help me come up with a plan!<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Aren't you a pirate? What do you stand to gain from helping them?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Royal Fortune：</span><br>
There's no rule against pirates helping others! This is a special case!<br>
What's the alternative? Leave everyone to die? Hell no!<br>
I have friends in the city! Friends who turn to the church for their bread!<br>
...What are ya smiling at? It's not funny!<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
No, you're right.<br>
I know how to organize an offensive. We'll charge straight into the middle of their formation.<br>
If they don't have a command unit, that's the most effective way to defeat Sirens... I mean, the Echo Fleet.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Royal Fortune：</span><br>
Charge in? We can't do that with only ONE ship!<br>
<br>
......<br>
<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项1：You have to trust me.</span>'''''<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Royal Fortune：</span><br>
......<br>
Ugh! Fine!<br>
Full speed ahead! Whatever happens, happens!<br>
{{折叠面板|内容结束}}

{{折叠面板|标题=Thalasso Strikes Back|选项=5|主框=1|样式=primary|展开=是}}
<br>
The clipper breaches the Sirens' formation with unbelievable speed and gets out just as quickly.<br>
Standing on the ship's quarterdeck, a breeze brushes my face while explosions go off behind me.<br>
Some of the fire and the flames come from the impromptly christened Royal Fortune's cannons...<br>
Most of it, however, is Siren-on-Siren friendly fire.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Royal Fortune：</span><br>
Whoa! I can't believe that worked! We're going toe-to-toe with a whole fleet!<br>
...Wait, this is bad! They've started spreading out from our port and starboard!<br>
We'll be right in their firing lines once they've created some distance, then we'll be at a crushing disadvantage!<br>
<br>
KABOOOM!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Royal Fortune：</span><br>
They hit our port side! We need damage control or something!<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
No need to freak out. It's almost time.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Royal Fortune：</span><br>
Time? For what?<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
For the cavalry to arrive.<br>
<br>
Right on cue, a whistle rings out in the distance.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">???：</span><br>
Goddess, give these brave warriors your blessings!<br>
Hoist sails! Follow the flagship!<br>
<br>
The Thalasso defense fleet sails forth, after many minutes of readying its vessels under Siren fire.<br>
The victor has already been determined.<br>

<br>
The battle has concluded.<br>
While Thalasso's forces clean up the battlefield in the background, a surprise guest comes aboard the Royal Fortune.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
(She's a Tempesta, just like Royal Fortune – but this one's cut from a very different cloth.)<br>
<br>
Sensing my gaze, the guest bows forward slightly and lifts the rim of her dress.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Golden Hind：</span><br>
Greetings~<br>
Oh, my little ones can be rather slimy, but pay them no mind~<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Royal Fortune：</span><br>
Holy smokes...<br>
Aren't you...?<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Do you know her?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Royal Fortune：</span><br>
Who doesn't? She's like, world-famous! Both here and in the New World!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Golden Hind：</span><br>
Allow me to introduce myself. I am Golden Hind.<br>
Now, which of you is the captain of this fine ship?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Royal Fortune：</span><br>
Couldn't be me! THIS person's the captain!<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Me? Uh...<br>
Ahem. Well met, Golden Hind. I assume it was you who commanded the city's defense fleet?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Golden Hind：</span><br>
Heehee, yes. Though, I'm afraid I'm quite a novice.<br>
You, on the other hand, fought expertly, my darling Commander.<br>
I've never seen anyone take on the Echo Fleet with the brilliance you displayed. Oh, and is "Commander" too formal?<br>
What should I call you?<br>
<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项1："Commander" will do fine.</span>'''''<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项2：Call me Commander Tempesta.</span>'''''<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Golden Hind：</span><br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项1）</span>'''''Then "Commander" it is, my darling.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Golden Hind：</span><br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项2）</span>'''''Excuse me...?<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项2）</span>'''''Oh, you quick-witted joker, you. Heehee~ My fondness of you only grows.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Golden Hind：</span><br>
As for me, just call me Golden Hind.<br>
Let's find a place to sit before we continue. Follow me~<br>
<br>
Fifteen minutes later, in the city's church...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Royal Fortune：</span><br>
Well, well... Pretty nice place you picked.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Golden Hind：</span><br>
It's the quietest place you can find at the moment~<br>
The walls outside have ears, and I want to speak in private.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Royal Fortune：</span><br>
That's not exactly what caught my attention.<br>
What I meant is, it's my first time here, and...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Golden Hind：</span><br>
You're worried the Goddess won't welcome you, is that it?<br>
<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项1："Goddess"? Who is she?</span>'''''<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Royal Fortune：</span><br>
The avatar of storms and the sea, as well as the virtuous symbol of Thalasso's faith.<br>
She protects those who make their livings at sea, so all churches across Thalasso need shrines to give her offerings.<br>
Like I said, though, she's virtuous. Us pirates aren't much for virtue, so...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Golden Hind：</span><br>
You don't have to worry about that.<br>
Our beneficent goddess welcomes and protects all who believe in the sky and sea equally. Even you.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Royal Fortune：</span><br>
You're saying she'll send good winds my way if I pray to her?<br>
What happens if everyone prays for winds in opposite directions, then?<br>
You can't have a tailwind AND a headwind at the same time.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Golden Hind：</span><br>
Who knows what happens? I've never thought about it. I'd assume the strongest prayer wins out.<br>
That is a good question, though. It's true – you think of things most others wouldn't, Royal Fortune.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Royal Fortune：</span><br>
You've heard about me before?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Golden Hind：</span><br>
Yes. You're more famous than you think. They call you the rising star, finding her own way to the New World.<br>
Oh, is that nervousness on your face? Don't be. I'm but a humble businesswoman.<br>
Besides, I don't think there is any conflict between our respective "businesses"~<br>
Here, have my business card~<br>
<br>
......<br>
<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项1："Golden Hind Venture Capital"?</span>'''''<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Golden Hind：</span><br>
Indeed. I'm the director~<br>
I've also got a company sign, approved by the Thalasso government. Alas, I have no place to hang it~<br>
Now, the reason why I brought you here... Would you be interested in an investment from me?<br>
I'm offering a full commission fee, upfront, plus a top-grade loan with zero interest. How does that sound~?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Royal Fortune：</span><br>
Commission fee? Ya wanna hire us?<br>
Sounds like a lot of money... Too sweet a deal to be anything straightforward.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
What do you actually want us to do?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Golden Hind：</span><br>
You see, there's a reason why the Echo Fleet launched an attack on the city~<br>
Have you heard about the Fountain of Youth, perchance?<br>
{{折叠面板|内容结束}}

{{折叠面板|标题=The Will of the Storm|选项=7|主框=1|样式=primary|展开=是}}
<br>
One hour later...<br>
After hearing Golden Hind's briefing, we returned to our clipper – the now-officially rechristened Great Royal Fortune.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Royal Fortune：</span><br>
So, basically, the city found a treasure map that proves the existence of the Fountain of Youth while searching shipwrecks around Thalasso.<br>
The map belonged to a group called the Black Wolves, a gang of treasure hunters searching for the loot that was lost in the Great Collapse.<br>
<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项1："Great Collapse"? And what was that about loot?</span>'''''<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项2：Treasure hunters, you say?</span>'''''<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Royal Fortune：</span><br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项1）</span>'''''Some people call 'em "last world relics."<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项1）</span>'''''They're supposedly artifacts that spread all over the world when the civilisation that made them, the Ancients, fell during the Great Collapse.<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项1）</span>'''''The Black Wolves bring in the artifacts to scholars, who need 'em to study the past.<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项1）</span>'''''They've not gotten far with that, though. Their history is so short that even I can recite it in full.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Royal Fortune：</span><br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项2）</span>'''''Yup. They look for the treasure that was scattered across the globe when a civilisation called the Ancients went under.<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项2）</span>'''''Between all the discoveries our modern civilisation has made about the Ancients, the Black Wolves had a hand in most of them.<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项2）</span>'''''A lot of adventurers say they're just a myth, though, because treasure-hunting is an extremely risky venture.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Royal Fortune：</span><br>
The thing about the Black Wolves is that they've all been "dead" for decades, so how are they back all of a sudden?<br>
I dunno about you, but I don't buy the idea that this secret club just decided to come back to life one day.<br>
Furthermore, why would the Echo Fleet be gunning for the Black Wolves' treasures?<br>
They even broke their own rules and attacked a city. It doesn't make any sense.<br>
Like, what would they want with the Fountain of Youth? They're made of steel. Steel doesn't age like a living being...<br>
<br>
Royal Fortune's ship of thought has sailed into rough, unknown waters.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
(So many questions, and so little information to speculate on...)<br>
(I think this calls for a change of subject.)<br>
<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项1：What can you tell me about the Echo Fleet?</span>'''''<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项2：What do you think about the Great Royal Fortune?</span>'''''<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Royal Fortune：</span><br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项1）</span>'''''Hm? Oh, they've got firepower in spades, but they can't coordinate a single thing.<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项1）</span>'''''Probably because they don't have even a half-decent commander at the helm.<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项1）</span>'''''Their ships are strong on paper, sure, but ours isn't very far behind.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Royal Fortune：</span><br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项2）</span>'''''You mean the clipper and not me, right?<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项2）</span>'''''Good question. If it's an evaluation you're asking for...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Royal Fortune：</span><br>
She strikes the perfect balance between firepower, speed, and protection.<br>
I still can't believe she's actually ours now.<br>
I've no idea how Golden Hind convinced the prior owner to relinquish her. Though, her rep as a renowned New World pir– Err, businesswoman, surely helped.<br>
<br>
......<br>
<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项1：Don't you prefer your own ship over her?</span>'''''<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Royal Fortune：</span><br>
No! I like all good ships equally!<br>
Well, except ghost ships. They hold a special place in my heart.<br>
If I get to captain a legendary ghost ship one day, I can die without regrets~<br>
<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项1：The "ghost" part doesn't put you off?</span>'''''<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项2：So you're not afraid of the curses associated with them?</span>'''''<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Royal Fortune：</span><br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项1）</span>'''''The opposite, in fact! Ghost ships are just one of the many maritime legends.<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项1）</span>'''''I won't become a great explorer if spooky stuff gets under my skin!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Royal Fortune：</span><br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项2）</span>'''''Curses? Please, those are just sailor stories.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Royal Fortune：</span><br>
When you're as sweet, strong, and lucky as me, ghost ships aren't anything to be afraid of!<br>
In fact, a legendary ship like that is only fitting for a legendary pirate, wouldn't you say?<br>
All that said, I'm still happy with the ship we have now.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Golden Hind：</span><br>
That's what matters at the end of the day~<br>
You are like a monk without a want in the world, compared to me and my collection fervor.<br>
And that's why you were the perfect choice~<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Royal Fortune：</span><br>
Choice? For what?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Golden Hind：</span><br>
Nothing, nothing. Just thinking aloud~<br>
Even though this ship was produced years ago, she remains the best vessel for sailing on the new lanes.<br>
Sadly, all the cities capable of producing ships like her have gone into decline. Be careful with her, okay?<br>
Because she's not just a regular ship – she's near and dear to me.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Royal Fortune：</span><br>
Wait... Are ya suggesting she belonged to YOU?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Golden Hind：</span><br>
Her, and every other vessel docked in this harbour, yes.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Royal Fortune：</span><br>
Sooo... We almost stole from you...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Golden Hind：</span><br>
It's okay. Might makes right in this world.<br>
I couldn't have produced the amazing results you did if I'd been at the helm~<br>
Really, you two are most suited to be her owners.<br>
I've found something of greater value than this ship anyway~♡<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Royal Fortune：</span><br>
Wow... Cheers! I didn't know you were so generous.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Golden Hind：</span><br>
You're welcome~ Be sure to stock up on supplies before your grand cruise~<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Royal Fortune：</span><br>
R-right, I'll go check on that! You watch the deck, Commander!<br>
<br>
With a remarkable urgency in her gait, Royal Fortune leaves the scene.<br>
Now she has started calling me "Commander" as well.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Golden Hind：</span><br>
How fascinating~<br>
You two display a level of trust I envy, despite having just met each other.<br>
Oh, my darling Commander, did I tell you about the legend circulating in Thalasso's churches?<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
You didn't. What is it?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Golden Hind：</span><br>
The story of an adventurer beating impossible odds.<br>
They say a ship was sailing for the New World, when it stumbled into a place called Windless Sea.<br>
It's exactly what it sounds like – a death trap for ships that rely on their sails.<br>
Nobody can explain why the wind doesn't blow there. It defies the laws of nature... and all you can do is pray you avoid it.<br>
The adventurer, now stuck and unable to get out on their own, prayed to the Goddess for the wind to blow, but nothing happened.<br>
But, just as all hope seemed lost, a miraculous storm appeared out of nowhere.<br>
This storm pushed the adventurer's vessel to the shores of the New World, where they found a map to navigate around the Windless Sea.<br>
With a safe path to the New World discovered, people hailed this event as the will of the Goddess.<br>
But the story doesn't end there. Do you know what happened yesterday?<br>
Just like in the story, a miraculous storm suddenly whipped up.<br>
<br>
......<br>
<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项1：Must be the Goddess' will...</span>'''''<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Golden Hind：</span><br>
Thank you for listening.<br>
On the open ocean, the waves and the storms carry the Goddess' blessings.<br>
May the winds of fortune carry your sails, my darling Commander.<br>
<br>
Golden Hind turns around and gazes out at the harbor.<br>
Off in the distance, Royal Fortune sings a cheerful tune.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Royal Fortune：</span><br>
Hoist all sails and anchor aweigh♪<br>
The Goddess smiles, for we sail today♪<br>

<br>
It wasn't long after our adventure on Seabreeze Island before I found myself in this other world.<br>
It started when Royal Fortune gave me a treasure map to follow, leading us to the resource-rich yet uninhabited isle.<br>
We built a resort there, explored old ruins, and found treasure in the form of crystals and ores at the end.<br>
Then, Royal Fortune appeared again and gave me a golden compass, saying it was the real treasure...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Royal Fortune：</span><br>
This compass is the real treasure. You get it for overcoming the trial of the ruins.<br>
Heheh, though I'm the one who handled the trial!<br>
Either way, it'll help you out someday. Keep it safe!<br>
Anyway, we'll be right behind you before long~<br>
Oi! Earth to Commander!<br>
Whatcha doing?<br>
<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项1：Is something wrong?</span>'''''<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项2：Need help with something?</span>'''''<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Royal Fortune：</span><br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项1）</span>'''''No? Well, not really.<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项1）</span>'''''I just thought I should check on you.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Royal Fortune：</span><br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项2）</span>'''''Ya think I can't handle this ship by myself?<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项2）</span>'''''If anything, YOU look like you need some help.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Do I really look that bothered?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Royal Fortune：</span><br>
More like you have something on your mind. My legendary pirate sense tells me so.<br>
You thinking about the fabled Treasure Coast? Or anxious about the cursed Black Reef?<br>
C'mon, share it with the class♪<br>
<br>
......<br>
<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项1：If you really want to know...</span>'''''<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Royal Fortune：</span><br>
...You feel like we set off too soon? I mean, it's what Golden Hind asked us to do.<br>
She doesn't want to draw attention, so we have to sail alone... which, I'll admit, makes this a pretty tiny expedition team.<br>
But, I already collected our fee, and we're in no position to question her decisions.<br>
I'm glad just to be sailing the sea, feeling the breeze in my hair.<br>
Let's also not forget that if this gamble pays off, we might become aristocrats! There's a chance we can win big!<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
There are no winners or losers in gambling, only likely and unlikely outcomes.<br>
Furthermore, Lady Luck is a fickle mistress. You should know that better than me.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Royal Fortune：</span><br>
Touché...<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
......<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Royal Fortune：</span><br>
Why are you looking at me like that? It's not like I'm such a poor gambler I need church handouts!<br>
Look, I'll take your words to heart!<br>
You're right – we are underprepared. I'll go talk to Golden Hind about it.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Golden Hind：</span><br>
You called?<br>
Sorry for butting in, but it seems we have a bit of a problem.<br>
See the ship over yonder?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Royal Fortune：</span><br>
That? Isn't it just a sloop?<br>
Oh, you mean the OTHER direction!<br>
That's a large galleon! Armed, too!<br>
Are they naval staff from another city?<br>
...Don't look at me! I have no clue who they are!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Golden Hind：</span><br>
Oh dear... You don't know who São Martinho is.<br>
She commands the strongest fleet. There isn't a soul from Crownpolis to the New World who hasn't heard of her.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Royal Fortune：</span><br>
That name rings a vague bell, actually...<br>
Oh, right! She's the one they call the Invincible Crown!<br>
<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项1：Why do they call her that?</span>'''''<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Royal Fortune：</span><br>
Because her fleet is unstoppable – invincible!<br>
There's no hope of beating her without an intervention by Mother Nature.<br>
Why does she have her sights on us?! Golden Hind! I thought ya were a reputable businesswoman!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Golden Hind：</span><br>
Well... Business wars can get heated~<br>
In these trying times, I suppose the threat of violence is a part of doing business.<br>
This can't be a coincidence, though. They must be trying to find the Fountain of Youth as well.<br>
While the cities in Thalassopolis have non-conflict agreements, they can't do much to stop someone with more guns.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Royal Fortune：</span><br>
Yeah, yeah, yeah! What matters is, she's come to steal our business from us, hasn't she?<br>
Then she's no different from us pirates!<br>
<br>
The naval galleon draws closer while we struggle to figure out a response to the situation.<br>
A woman with angel-like wings leaps up from the ship's side and lands on the water between our ship and the other vessel.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">São Martinho：</span><br>
Hail, ship to our front. Halt and submit to an inspection.<br>
Your ship matches the description of a wanted vessel.<br>
Your understanding and cooperation are appreciated.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Royal Fortune：</span><br>
Ya think I'm stupid? You'll just come and nick everything that's not nailed down!<br>
Hoist sails! Let's show this navy git some pain!<br>
{{折叠面板|内容结束}}

{{折叠面板|标题=The Hunter and the Hunted|选项=9|主框=1|样式=primary|展开=是}}
<br>
The Great Royal Fortune sails as quickly as she can, fighting the headwind.<br>
But it's not enough – São Martinho is still hot on our tail.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Royal Fortune：</span><br>
I didn't think she could go this fast!<br>
She's gonna catch up with us eventually at this rate!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Golden Hind：</span><br>
Turn portside! We've got to catch the tailwind!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Royal Fortune：</span><br>
Portside? But that's in uncharted waters! We might end up in the Windless Sea!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Golden Hind：</span><br>
It's our only choice! I don't know for sure which city in Thalasso sent her after us, but I have a hunch!<br>
Come on, do it! We need to escape her, no matter the cost!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Royal Fortune：</span><br>
So we're screwed either way!<br>
Fine, whatever! Commander, grab on to something!<br>
<br>
And so, the Great Royal Fortune changes to an unsafe course.<br>
Despite the danger to both parties, the chase continues...<br>
{{折叠面板|内容结束}}

{{折叠面板|标题=Second Storm|选项=10|主框=1|样式=primary|展开=是}}
<br>
In light of our change of course, rather than pick up the pace, São Martinho maintains a set distance behind us.<br>
It's as if she expects us to wander into the Windless Sea and is waiting for it to happen.<br>
Then, suddenly...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Golden Hind：</span><br>
...The wind stopped.<br>
The air is heavy and the seas are calm... Uh-oh.<br>
This isn't the Windless Sea...<br>
<br>
KRR-BOOOM!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Royal Fortune：</span><br>
It's a storm! A storm's coming!<br>
We need to find shelter, now!<br>
...But where are you supposed to find shelter on the open bloody ocean?!<br>
<br>
In the blink of an eye, our ship begins being pelted with rain and rocked with gales.<br>
In a storm like this, it matters not whether you're in the shabbiest sloop or the best clipper – the waves will pummel your hull either way.<br>
As it goes with the Great Royal Fortune, so too does it go with our pursuer.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">São Martinho：</span><br>
Gah...!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Royal Fortune：</span><br>
She's gotten separated from her galleon... Good!<br>
I doubt she'll make it far like this!<br>
Oi, you stubborn prat! Give up the chase and go away already!<br>
<br>
São Martinho winces, but shows no intent of breaking off from us.<br>
......<br>
She is determined, but the storm is apathetic to her resolve.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
(I can't just leave her to her fate!)<br>
<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项1：Royal Fortune, take the helm!</span>'''''<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Royal Fortune：</span><br>
What? Are you seriously thinking about saving her?!<br>
She can't even save herself... Bah, fine!<br>
<br>
Despite her objection, Royal Fortune grips the helm and pulls it hard.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
I need your help, too, Golden Hind!<br>
São Martinho! Come here, quickly!<br>
Grab my hand!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">São Martinho：</span><br>
Ugh...<br>
Mrrghh...<br>
Come on...!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Golden Hind：</span><br>
The waves are coming! Look out, Commander!<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Almost there! Don't let go!<br>
<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项1：(Grasp São Martinho's arm.)</span>'''''<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Royal Fortune：</span><br>
Comma... wave... too strong!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Golden Hind：</span><br>
We're... turn...!<br>
<br>
The furious thunder drowns out their voices.<br>
I do the only thing I can – hold on to São Martinho's hand like my life depends on it.<br>

...<br>
......<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Royal Fortune：</span><br>
Heheh~♪<br>
Sooo... you're sure about this?<br>
Okay... I feel like the happiest girl alive!<br>
But, living with me's not gonna be easy. You can't just change your mind later, ya hear?<br>
Alright, then take my hand...<br>
<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项1：(Extend your hand.)</span>'''''<br>
<br>
SLAM!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Royal Fortune：</span><br>
Oi! What are ya doing?!<br>
<br>
I open my eyes and see Royal Fortune at the cabin door, having just thrown it open with force.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Golden Hind：</span><br>
What does it look like? We're tending to the Commander~<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">???：</span><br>
Shh. Not so loud. The Commander just woke up.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Royal Fortune：</span><br>
Okay, okay...<br>
WAIT, NO! THIS IS NOT OKAY!<br>
The Commander is MY crewmate! Looking after the crew is MY job!<br>
And you! Out of the way!<br>
Famous ghost ship or not, you're in MY seat!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Golden Hind：</span><br>
Well, well~<br>
I thought I heard someone aboard this clipper was dying to meet a ghost ship~<br>
Who might that be, hmm~?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Royal Fortune：</span><br>
Ugh! I hate you!<br>
I don't care about those anymore!<br>
<br>
I did not imagine my day would start with a catfight wake-up call...<br>
<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项1：Okay, okay. That's enough teasing.</span>'''''<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Golden Hind：</span><br>
Fair enough~ Come sit next to me, Royal Fortune~<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Royal Fortune：</span><br>
Hmph. "Thanks."<br>
<br>
She sits down angrily on the bed and grasps my other, unheld hand.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
*sigh*... Let's get the important question out of the way.<br>
Where's São Martinho? Is she okay?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">???：</span><br>
Aye. Safe and sound, thanks to your selfless bravery.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Royal Fortune：</span><br>
Yeah. She told me she WASN'T after us in particular.<br>
Because why would she be? That whole chase only happened because Golden Hind misled us!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Golden Hind：</span><br>
Well, in my defence, it's only natural to be alarmed in that situation.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">???：</span><br>
Can't argue with that.<br>
São Martinho feels conflicted about this whole thing. She pursued you all, and you ended up saving her. Must be a hard pill to swallow.<br>
Still, I think she'll let you off the hook. Your hand's so warm, anyone would–<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Royal Fortune：</span><br>
Oi!<br>
I see you! Don't you even try!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">???：</span><br>
Hahahah! You've got a funky crew here, Commander. Hang on to it.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Mary Celeste：</span><br>
My name's Mary Celeste, by the way.<br>
I'm the true face behind the ghost ship legend of New World.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Royal Fortune：</span><br>
Mhm. She helped by guiding us into the eye of the storm.<br>
I figured you should know, since she probably wouldn't tell you herself.<br>
<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项1：Thanks for saving us. How can we repay you?</span>'''''<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Mary Celeste：</span><br>
No need to. You and your crew earned the rescue.<br>
Brave people like yourself deserve to see grand voyages to their end. I only did what I thought anyone would have.<br>
As a ghost ship, sailing to the eye of a storm is an instinct imprinted on my hull.<br>
Speaking of the storm, it'll abate in a few hours. You can sail away safely after that.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Will you be coming with us?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Mary Celeste：</span><br>
Excuse me?<br>
Don't I creep you out? I'm a ghost ship, for god's sake.<br>
<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项1：So what?</span>'''''<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Mary Celeste：</span><br>
Come on. You're just saying that.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Royal Fortune：</span><br>
No, the Commander means it.<br>
The Goddess of Thalasso has nothing against you, so why should we?<br>
You are cordially and sincerely invited to join the crew. We want you with us on this adventure!<br>
Isn't that right, Commander?<br>
(Come on, say something!)<br>
<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项1：Yeah! You heard her!</span>'''''<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项2：Damn right! Took the words right out of my mouth, my queen!</span>'''''<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Royal Fortune：</span><br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项2）</span>'''''O-okay, you don't need to agree THAT hard...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Mary Celeste：</span><br>
Hmm... Give me a while to think about it.<br>
By the way–<br>
<br>
KABOOOM!<br>
Suddenly, the sound of cannon fire rumbles through the cabin window.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Royal Fortune：</span><br>
What was that?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Golden Hind：</span><br>
Oh, dear. It's the Echo Fleet.<br>
And São Martinho is already engaging them. We should back her up~<br>
{{折叠面板|内容结束}}

{{折叠面板|标题=The Horn of Battle|选项=12|主框=1|样式=primary|展开=是}}
<br>
In a hurry, we leave the cabin and set foot on the quarterdeck.<br>
Debris from the ship litters the deck, even though the storm that broke the pieces off is already dying down.<br>
No, not just dying down – the storm wall encircling us is dispersing right before our eyes.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Mary Celeste：</span><br>
The storm is going away? How?<br>
I thought it'd pass in hours from now, not minutes!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Royal Fortune：</span><br>
Golden Hind, didn't ya say the Goddess commands the sea and the sky?<br>
Has the Echo Fleet taken that power from her, somehow?<br>
They couldn't control the bloody weather, last I heard! Clearly, they can!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Golden Hind：</span><br>
I'm afraid I wouldn't know. It's possible they sussed out Mary Celeste's true form and decided to attack.<br>
Otherwise, I can't see why they'd want to kill the storm.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Mary Celeste：</span><br>
They're here because of me?<br>
Huh... I don't know what their beef with me is, but sorry for getting the rest of you involved.<br>
Start sailing out of here. I'll draw their attention away from you.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Royal Fortune：</span><br>
Thank you! You're a lifesaver!<br>
...Is what you thought I'd say, didn't you?!<br>
No! I have principles! Principles like not abandoning a single member of my crew or fleet!<br>
From now on, that's part of my pact!<br>
<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项1：Since when did you have a whole fleet?</span>'''''<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项2：Since when did you establish a pact?</span>'''''<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Royal Fortune：</span><br>
Since now!<br>
Now shut up! I'm trying to sound cool here!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Mary Celeste：</span><br>
Hahahah! You all are a funny bunch.<br>
Tell you what – I'll come along on your adventures.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Royal Fortune：</span><br>
Welcome aboard! Literally!<br>
First of all, we have to win this battle! São Martinho needs our help!<br>
The Echo Fleet is tough, but we've already beaten 'em once before!<br>
Now, set sail!<br>
{{折叠面板|内容结束}}

{{折叠面板|标题=The Winner Still Stands|选项=13|主框=1|样式=primary|展开=是}}
<br>
It was a long and hard battle.<br>
The Echo Fleet fought us head-on, coordinating and using tactics, not so much as flinching at the hail of cannon fire we unleashed on them.<br>
Despite that, though, I managed to lead our side to victory.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">São Martinho：</span><br>
May the golden light shine evermore... The Echo Fleet has been annihilated.<br>
You, Commander, are a force like a raging storm. I commend you.<br>
<br>
After weathering that fierce battle with us, São Martinho finally is willing to talk eye-to-eye.<br>
<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项1：Please. You flatter me.</span>'''''<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">São Martinho：</span><br>
I do not. I mean every word.<br>
My view of you has been glowing since you saved me.<br>
Why don't you board my ship, so we can talk further?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Golden Hind：</span><br>
A kind offer, but we must refuse~<br>
While I know you only came across us by happenstance, I will not let you poach any of our crew.<br>
If it's my darling Commander you just can't get enough of, how about you join our fleet instead?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Royal Fortune：</span><br>
Oi! Phrasing! It's not "our" fleet, it's MY fleet!<br>
Also... I found this odd flag among the Echo Fleet's wreckage. Does anyone recognise it?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Golden Hind：</span><br>
Flag? Let me have a look~<br>
Oh, my... Why, this is the Black Wolves' flag!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">São Martinho：</span><br>
Indeed it is. I've seen more like it very recently, too.<br>
Those, too, were among Echo Fleet wreckages.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Royal Fortune：</span><br>
Hang on, I thought the Black Wolves were treasure hunters?<br>
What's the Echo Fleet got to do with them?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Golden Hind：</span><br>
Well, consider that the Black Wolves "perished" decades ago.<br>
And after many years, they've suddenly reappeared again, as if brought back to life.<br>
While they use the same old flag, we know nothing about who they are now, not even who's their leader.<br>
So, what I think is that the Black Wolves aren't back, but rather that someone is controlling the Echo Fleet and sails under the guise of the Black Wolves' banner.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">São Martinho：</span><br>
Hmm... I can see the logic behind that.<br>
The Echo Fleet has been raiding shipping lanes more frequently over the past few years.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Golden Hind：</span><br>
They've gotten more daring and begun attacking cities, too.<br>
It's anyone's guess what their goal is, but if they're after the same thing as the Black Wolves...<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
(This is an interesting inquiry...)<br>
(The Sirens are more than capable of manipulating the weather.)<br>
(Assuming this Echo Fleet is in fact the Sirens, it explains their habit of attacking shipping lanes when they get separated into smaller units.)<br>
(They were organized when we fought them just earlier. That can only mean one thing...)<br>
<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项1：Their master has come back to life.</span>'''''<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Golden Hind：</span><br>
Their... master?<br>
Surely you jest, my darling? That's ridiculous.<br>
There is the folk theory that their fleet is a relic from the past, but...<br>
...They did attack the city where the map for the Fountain of Youth was.<br>
...And they have the means to dispel a storm, like what's said to guard the Fountain.<br>
What if they ARE after it, and intend to take the power it contains?<br>
Whether the legends that surround it are true or not, we need to put a stop to them.<br>
Let us sail for the New World at once, my darling.<br>
The sooner, the better.<br>

The Great Royal Fortune has faced many challenges but still stands firm as she sails into the lonesome night.<br>
Moonlight dyes the jigger topmast a silver color, giving the flying jib almost a snow-white silhouette.<br>
It's a beautiful sight wrapped in tranquility – hardly befitting us seafaring adventurers.<br>
The silence is broken by a shout coming from high up in the crow's nest.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Royal Fortune：</span><br>
Ahoy! I can see land!<br>
There's land!<br>
<br>
The ship's crew – which is, admittedly, just me and a small handful of shipgirls – all immediately gather on the deck.<br>
All of us take turns with the telescope, our gazes focusing in the direction Royal Fortune gestured towards.<br>
With bated breaths, we wait for the moment that land pokes up over the horizon.<br>
It is not land that comes into view, however, but rather a shocking entity.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">São Martinho：</span><br>
That isn't land... It's the Echo Fleet!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Mary Celeste：</span><br>
Flying the Black Wolves' banner, at that. They really have taken the treasure hunters' flag as their own.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Golden Hind：</span><br>
That's not all. Judging by their heading, I think they're headed for a New World port.<br>
<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项1：How long until they reach it?</span>'''''<br>
Around an hour, I'd say.<br>
<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项1：What defenses does that port have?</span>'''''<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Golden Hind：</span><br>
None that'll arrive before morning, since it lacks the facilities to fully facilitate navigation at night.<br>
Which is to say, it'll fall before sunrise if anyone attacks.<br>
<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项1：Then all we can do is to lure the fleet away.</span>'''''<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Golden Hind：</span><br>
We certainly can lure them away. Driving them back, though? That's another topic~<br>
We need reinforcements, my darling. Say, while we keep them busy, could you do something for me~?<br>

<br>
Engaging the Echo Fleet was always going to be a steep uphill battle, even if only as a distraction to lure them away from the port.<br>
It's already clear that they can't be reasoned with. The only way to get their attention is with an exchange of cannon fire.<br>
On one side, Mary's team fights with the fury of a tornado. On the other, São Martinho fights relentlessly on the frontlines.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">São Martinho：</span><br>
Onward! Onward! The golden light's banner shall never fall!<br>
Fire! Fire! The golden light's glory shall never wane!<br>
Resound and applaud! The golden light's hymn shall never stop!<br>
<br>
The enemy attacks come in violent waves, but São Martinho does not flinch. Her bravery shines like a star in the dark night.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Mary Celeste：</span><br>
They're tough, I'll give them that...<br>
Thank god we have São Martinho on our side.<br>
She's led the surrounding Echo Fleets away from the shoreline. We should retreat now.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Royal Fortune：</span><br>
Nuh-uh. Now is not a good time.<br>
They'd have chewed us up already if São Martinho hadn't gone in first.<br>
Showing them our backs now would be suicide.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Golden Hind：</span><br>
All we can do is keep fighting, then. Luckily, the New World backup isn't far.<br>
There is a gap in our world history, where a war took place.<br>
Even if most people don't know about it, there will always be those who remember it.<br>
It's time, my darling~<br>
<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项1：(Light the fuse.)</span>'''''<br>
<br>
I launch the signal flare Golden Hind entrusted me with.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Mary Celeste：</span><br>
Well, well. You're always full of surprises.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Golden Hind：</span><br>
Mhm. It's a communication tool I found in the New World~<br>
Let's see if my friend is as well-connected as she claims...<br>
<br>
PSSHH!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Golden Hind：</span><br>
Oh, my. They're already all here~<br>
<br>
A flare shoots up into the sky, illuminating a fleet that has appeared out of thin air.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Whydah：</span><br>
What a pain... Hey, Whydah here.<br>
Good to see you again, girls from Thalasso...<br>
You brought new snacks with you from back home, right?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Royal Fortune：</span><br>
Is that your friend? Is she bringing the reinforcements?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Golden Hind：</span><br>
To be precise, SHE is the reinforcement~<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Royal Fortune：</span><br>
...What?<br>
Her? This little girl?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Golden Hind：</span><br>
You heard me. She is far, far richer than me~<br>
What, don't you have any friends with lots of cash to splash?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Royal Fortune：</span><br>
Okay, that's nip this in the bud! She's a friend of a friend, which makes her my friend, too! Boy, my rich friends are so awesome!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Golden Hind：</span><br>
Good. Remember to tell her the same later.<br>
Hey, Whydah! Over here~<br>
You'll get your snacks, just cover our retreat for now~<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Whydah：</span><br>
Woohoo! Snack time!<br>
Okay, I've got you.<br>
I'll get you out safely!<br>
{{折叠面板|内容结束}}

{{折叠面板|标题=Whydah the Magnificent|选项=16|主框=1|样式=primary|展开=是}}
<br>
The Echo Fleet quickly lost their momentum thanks to Whydah's pincer attack, forcing them to retreat.<br>
The girls were initially doubtful of Whydah's fleet, having appeared from nowhere. Their misgivings vanished as soon as they saw the little girl herself.<br>
She – "Whydah the Magnificent," as Golden Hind put it – is a pirate shipgirl who has made it big in the New World.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">São Martinho：</span><br>
Thank you for coming to our aid.<br>
I must say, though... You are very small.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Mary Celeste：</span><br>
Hahahah! Look at 'er! Isn't she a cute little lass?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Whydah：</span><br>
H-hey... Put me down!<br>
I can't see anything with my hat covering my eyes!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Royal Fortune：</span><br>
Oh, boy...<br>
Golden Hind, are you serious about the "magnificence" of this girl?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Golden Hind：</span><br>
Yes, I am~<br>
<br>
Golden Hind smiles a strangely proud smile.<br>
A bit of fussing later...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Whydah：</span><br>
A-alright, listen! I'm Whydah! I answered your call!<br>
So, if I got this right, you want to throw a wrench into the Echo Fleet's plans, yeah?<br>
First, things get busy in the New World, then, the Echo Fleet starts causing trouble...<br>
I won't be able to sleep at night if things get any worse. Ugh, what a pain...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Mary Celeste：</span><br>
Then why don't you come with us and fix those problems?<br>
Don't worry, little one, we'll keep you safe~<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Whydah：</span><br>
Y-yikes...!<br>
<br>
Mary squats down in front of Whydah, who hops to the top of a nearby box.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Whydah：</span><br>
N-no! Keep your cold, pale hands off of me!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">São Martinho：</span><br>
Seems she finds a ghost ship more frightening than the Echo Fleet.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Royal Fortune：</span><br>
Thanks for the insightful comment...<br>
Ahem. I'm still surprised the Echo Fleet just gave up like that.<br>
Last time we fought, we had to sink 70% of their fleet before they legged it.<br>
Bet they went home and cried to mommy and daddy!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Golden Hind：</span><br>
That's no way to speak about a tough adversary, Royal Fortune~<br>
Huh...?<br>
......<br>
Oh...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Royal Fortune：</span><br>
What's the matter? Why'd ya go quiet all of a sudden?<br>
...Over there? What's there that I'm not–<br>
Oh, god! We've got trouble!<br>
<br>
Golden Hind raised a tentacle and pointed into the distance towards a colossal shadow on the horizon.<br>
Slowly, the silhouette of the giant thing grows bigger and bigger, dyeing the sea fog around it a foreboding black.<br>
It is larger than any warship in the world. Even the largest vessels in Thalasso seem tiny by comparison.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Whydah：</span><br>
Geeeesh... We chased off the small ones, and now they're bringing in the big guns!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Golden Hind：</span><br>
Something tells me it won't leave without a fight.<br>
São Martinho, can you defeat it?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">São Martinho：</span><br>
......<br>
I will try.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Mary Celeste：</span><br>
Meaning, you're not sure you'll win...<br>
Which is fair, really. I wouldn't be confident about beating a ship many times bigger than a galleon either.<br>
We've got li'l Whydah here, so why don't we just flee before it reaches us?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Whydah：</span><br>
Did you just call me "little"?<br>
I'll have you know that I'm a reliable pirate leader, no matter my stature!<br>
They don't call me "the Magnificent" for nothing! I can deal with anyone, even that monster of a ship.<br>
<br>
She digs through the pockets of her greatly oversized coat and pulls out an antique yet ornate little box.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Royal Fortune：</span><br>
This isn't the time for a snack, y'know.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Whydah：</span><br>
It's not a snack box! Stupid... I'm taking this seriously.<br>
Okay, let's see... This will take a little while to set up.<br>
You'll need to defend me until I'm done.<br>
I'll tell you once I've finished.<br>
<br>
Holding on to her hat many sizes too large for her head, Whydah vanishes over the sea, small box in hand.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Mary Celeste：</span><br>
Thinks herself a pirate leader, eh... Hahahah.<br>
Let's make the kid's dream come true. Commander, you take point.<br>
<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项1：Got it.</span>'''''<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Royal Fortune：</span><br>
Alright, here we go!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">São Martinho：</span><br>
For Whydah's dream.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Everyone：</span><br>
For Whydah's dream!<br>
{{折叠面板|内容结束}}

{{折叠面板|标题=Grimoire Terminal|选项=17|主框=1|样式=primary|展开=是}}
<br>
After ten minutes of keeping the colossal Echo Fleet ship at bay, Whydah suddenly returns.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Whydah：</span><br>
That was a pain... I'm done, by the way.<br>
Commander, can I borrow you for a sec?<br>
Terminal says it needs you to do its job.<br>
<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项1：Come again? "Terminal"?</span>'''''<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Whydah：</span><br>
Yup. It's an ancient grimoire capable of performing magic.<br>
<br>
She hands me a board-like object made of black metal.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
(Hang on... Is this a tablet computer?)<br>
<br>
I thought it looked extremely familiar. Sure enough, it is a tablet.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Royal Fortune：</span><br>
Is that what you were keeping inside your snack box?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Whydah：</span><br>
I told you! It's not a dang snack box!<br>
Ugh... Terminal, are you there?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Grimoire Terminal：</span><br>
Greetings, Whydah the Magnificent. I am on standby and awaiting orders.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Royal Fortune：</span><br>
What in tarnation?! It can talk?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Whydah：</span><br>
It sure can. But it's not JUST a talking grimoire.<br>
Okay, let's run the... authentication protocol thingy, right?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Grimoire Terminal：</span><br>
...Please follow the instructions shown and place your right hand on the center of the screen.<br>
<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项1：(Put your right hand down.)</span>'''''<br>
<br>
The familiar voice makes my muscle memory kick in.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Grimoire Terminal：</span><br>
Authentication protocol complete.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Whydah：</span><br>
Sweet. Now it's showtime.<br>
<br>
Whydah spoke, and at the same time, a sound like distant rumbling came from the sky.<br>
The night sky is lit up by what looks like shimmering falling stars that converge upon a single point.<br>
Traveling faster than the speed of sound, the objects strike the gigantic warship. A moment later follows an ear-shattering sonic boom and explosion.<br>
KABOOM!<br>
KABOOOOOM!<br>
The massive vessel capsizes instantly, and the many steel cannons lining its broadside fall into the ocean one after the next.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">São Martinho：</span><br>
The enemy has sunk.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Royal Fortune：</span><br>
What was THAT? Shooting stars?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">São Martinho：</span><br>
Unbelievable... She sunk that great beast in the twinkle of an eye. Such frightening power.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Golden Hind：</span><br>
My, my. The power of that ancient artifact hasn't declined one bit~<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Whydah：</span><br>
Riiight?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Mary Celeste：</span><br>
I'll be damned! You did it, li'l girl!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Whydah：</span><br>
Eep! L-let go of my hat!<br>
I've got something important to say... Lemme goooo!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Mary Celeste：</span><br>
Oh. Then let's hear it.<br>
<br>
Mary puts Whydah back down after holding her high in the air like a baby.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Whydah：</span><br>
Ugh... So, you're all looking for the Fountain of Youth, yeah?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Golden Hind：</span><br>
How'd you know?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Whydah：</span><br>
Terminal told me. Said there's a fleet investigating a legend of the New World.<br>
It said A legend, but it was pretty obvious which one. I figured it was probably you as soon as Golden Hind called for me.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Golden Hind：</span><br>
The... grimoire told you?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Whydah：</span><br>
Yup. It's really smart and knows everything.<br>
It also said the Fountain is where it originally came from.<br>
So yeah, I'm considering coming along with you to check it out.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Golden Hind：</span><br>
Aww, that's so brave of our little indoor pirate~<br>
You should know this is a pretty dangerous journey, though. Even more dangerous than the storm you ran into that one time~<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Whydah：</span><br>
Ugh... Yeah, I know.<br>
And while I do prefer the indoors, I've built up SOME resistance to the outdoors.<br>
While we're at it, can I make a suggestion?<br>
I know where Adventure Galley is spending her retirement. The journey will be a lot smoother if we can convince her to join the fleet.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Golden Hind：</span><br>
Adventure Galley? Isn't she the girl who...?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Whydah：</span><br>
Yeah. She's had it rough...<br>
But I think she recovered from her gloomy phase a while ago, at least.<br>
She knows more about maritime legends than anyone, and we'll need her wisdom if we're gonna actually find the Fountain of Youth.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Golden Hind：</span><br>
Hmm... I don't see why not~<br>
What do you think, my darling?<br>
<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项1：I'm all in favor of expanding the crew.</span>'''''<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Whydah：</span><br>
Great. Yippieee.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Mary Celeste：</span><br>
Great. Yippieee.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Whydah：</span><br>
Noooo! Not again! Let me doooown!<br>
{{折叠面板|内容结束}}

{{折叠面板|标题=The Start of a New Journey|选项=18|主框=1|样式=primary|展开=是}}
<br>
Trailing the coastline, we make for the place where the shipgirl Adventure Galley has retired to.<br>
While we've been sailing for several days straight now, life aboard the ship hasn't changed much – there's always something happening.<br>
From Royal Fortune making a racket when there's trouble, to Whydah playing solo hide-and-seek to avoid doing any work, the days are always full of character.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">São Martinho：</span><br>
Greetings, Commander.<br>
<br>
The girls are bathing on deck, and one of them shoots a playful splash of water at me. São Martinho effortlessly blocks it with her wing, then sits down in one of the water-filled barrels.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Thanks. I nearly got drenched there.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">São Martinho：</span><br>
Don't mention it.<br>
I must say, you are a fascinating person.<br>
You have a presence that alters the mind. The New World, bustling as it is, feels just like a calm Thalasso port when you're around.<br>
<br>
She draws a curious comparison, her eyes tracking Mary Celeste and Whydah as the former chases the latter around the deck.<br>
<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项1：That's a philosophical way of putting it.</span>'''''<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">São Martinho：</span><br>
Philosophy exists in all things.<br>
...I've wanted to formally invite you to my fleet. I give up on that now.<br>
Your comrades would surely object, and I doubt you're much interested to begin with.<br>
But, I have another idea...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Noise on Deck：</span><br>
Gotcha!<br>
<br>
The wild chase around the deck has resulted in a winner.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Whydah：</span><br>
L-lemme doooown!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Mary Celeste：</span><br>
Let me have this, and I'll double your snacks for today.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Whydah：</span><br>
D-double...? You mean it?<br>
<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项1：Don't overdo it, or you'll get cavities!</span>'''''<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Whydah：</span><br>
I know, okay?! I'm not a little kid!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Mary Celeste：</span><br>
Ahahahahah!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Whydah：</span><br>
What's so funny?<br>
Fine, if you'll really give me extra snacks, I'll let you hold me for just a while...<br>
Aaaahhhh! Stop shaking meeeeee!<br>
<br>
......<br>
<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项1：Sorry, what were you going to say?</span>'''''<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">São Martinho：</span><br>
Oh. Nothing too important.<br>
It might be too soon to bring it up, actually... My capacity for interpersonal relationships leaves much to be desired.<br>
My idea was to build a new maritime order. The time isn't ripe for it yet, however.<br>
I will need to study the matter further.<br>
<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项1：I hope you learn everything you need.</span>'''''<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">São Martinho：</span><br>
Thank you.<br>
Now, I'd better get back to my patrol. Farewell.<br>
<br>
The Great Royal Fortune sails onward, carrying the dreams of all those aboard.<br>

{{折叠面板|标题=Shipwreck Point|选项=19|主框=1|样式=primary|展开=是}}
<br>
New World - Secret waters - Shipwreck Point<br>
The crew of the Great Royal Fortune leans against her railings, looking at their surroundings with curious and tense expressions.<br>
As they should. This region of the sea is known as Shipwreck Point, and it is here where Adventure Galley has retired to.<br>
Whether the rumors that have earned this place its name hold any truth or not, we must proceed forward with caution.<br>
While the waters are tranquil for now, that could change at any moment.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Royal Fortune：</span><br>
This place is known for frequent shipwrecks, eh? It feels kinda standing on the edge of the world.<br>
Adventure Galley sure didn't choose a normal, boring place to retire to.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Mary Celeste：</span><br>
Yeah. On the plus side, it's not as eerie as I expected.<br>
If anything, it's a nice place. The sea is calm, the land is covered in greenery, and there's even flowers growing all over.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Golden Hind：</span><br>
All we know about Shipwreck Point comes from legends.<br>
It could simply be that ships that sink in the Windless Sea are brought here by the currents.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Royal Fortune：</span><br>
So all those stories about sea monsters and ghost ships were made up.<br>
Then I got the heebie-jeebies over nothing. We might as well just ask Adventure Galley to show herself!<br>
<br>
Before anyone else can get a word in, Royal Fortune cups her hands around her mouth and starts shouting.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Royal Fortune：</span><br>
HELLOOO!<br>
ADVENTURE GALLEEEY! ARE YOU HEEERE?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Whydah：</span><br>
Shhh! Don't be so loud!<br>
You don't know who or what is out there!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Royal Fortune：</span><br>
So? What's it matter?<br>
We just established that the rumours about this place are false.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Whydah：</span><br>
Because this place is more than meets the eye.<br>
Sure, the shipwreck part is false, but there HAVE been sightings of monsters and spooky ships.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Royal Fortune：</span><br>
Oh, okay. What a magical place the New World is.<br>
Still, no spooky ship has shown up so far, nor has Adventure Galley.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Whydah：</span><br>
Yeah, but... Hrmm...<br>
You'd think she'd notice that we sailed in here.<br>
Maybe she's trying to nap so she's pretending to be away?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Mary Celeste：</span><br>
Sounds like something out of your playbook.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Whydah：</span><br>
I only do that to recharge my energy!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Golden Hind：</span><br>
Maybe her hands are tied with other business~<br>
Isn't there some other way you can contact her, Whydah?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Whydah：</span><br>
Hmm. I guess we try a signal flare?<br>
Although, that'll DEFINITELY alert the monsters in the area... What a pain.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Golden Hind：</span><br>
My darling, what do you propose?<br>
<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项1：That we prepare in the event of a battle.</span>'''''<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Royal Fortune：</span><br>
You got it! Tempesta is on it.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Whydah：</span><br>
Good ide– Wait, what's "Tempesta"?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Royal Fortune：</span><br>
The name of our fleet! Isn't it brilliant? I came up with it on the spot.<br>
Think about it. Mary and São Martinho both have connections to storms.<br>
The Commander arrived in this world via a storm, too.<br>
We've got a storm theme going, so Tempesta makes sense! It'll be our lucky name!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Mary Celeste：</span><br>
It's got a nice ring to it.<br>
Since we've got a name, shouldn't have a flag to fly as well?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Royal Fortune：</span><br>
Of course!<br>
And we're gonna be world-famous as the crew that finally found the Fountain of Youth!<br>
It's the best debut achievement you can ask for!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Golden Hind：</span><br>
I'm glad to see you're having fun with this~<br>
So, let's do as the Commander suggested and get ready for battle, then Whydah will fire the flare and hopefully get Galley's attention~<br>
If any beasties appear, it's you ladies' job to deal with them~<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Royal Fortune：</span><br>
Roger dodger!<br>
Tempesta, weigh anchor!<br>
{{折叠面板|内容结束}}

{{折叠面板|标题=Stick 'em on the Grill|选项=20|主框=1|样式=primary|展开=是}}
<br>
The calm sea begins bursting with activity as soon as the signal flare goes off.<br>
One by one, wreckages infested with tentacles rise to the surface and set their sights on our vessel.<br>
But, Mary Celeste puts a swift stop to them using what one could only call her "rigging."<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Royal Fortune：</span><br>
What the heck is that?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Mary Celeste：</span><br>
Argo. She's my companion and rigging.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Royal Fortune：</span><br>
Oookay then...<br>
That's gotta be the biggest deep-sea creature I've ever seen.<br>
You shoulda told us earlier you had this ace up your sleeve!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Mary Celeste：</span><br>
Ahahah! I was worried you wouldn't accept her.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Royal Fortune：</span><br>
So what do the rest of us do now? Sit back and watch while you do the fighting?<br>
What a world we live in...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">São Martinho：</span><br>
No, we cannot be complacent. These beasts are no ordinary haunted ships.<br>
See how they've recovered from the damage Mary inflicted?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Mary Celeste：</span><br>
I can see it, too.<br>
Wherever Argo leaves a cut, they fill the gap and heal back up.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Golden Hind：</span><br>
Why, it's almost as if these ships are alive~<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Royal Fortune：</span><br>
More like, aquatic life has made its home inside the ships.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Mary Celeste：</span><br>
Oh! Like how a hermit crab does?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Royal Fortune：</span><br>
Probably! Crabs don't usually have razor-sharp tentacles, though.<br>
At any rate, it'll never end if they keep healing like this! We need to find a way to stop or slow down their regeneration!<br>
I know one thing that works on all living things – fire! I'll blast 'em till my cannons glow red!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Mary Celeste：</span><br>
F-fire? You're gonna fight them with fire?<br>
I'll, uh, stand back a little...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Royal Fortune：</span><br>
"A little"? You just went to the opposite end of the ship!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">São Martinho：</span><br>
I believe Mary may have a fear of fire.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Royal Fortune：</span><br>
Really? Is that true?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Mary Celeste：</span><br>
N-no! It's not a phobia or anything like that!<br>
It's for practical reasons! I'm a ghost ship, remember?<br>
I need to stay out of the light to go invisible!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Royal Fortune：</span><br>
Heheh. Fair enough.<br>
Do you girls think the flesh of these monsters is edible? I sure hope so.<br>
Ooh, I've got an idea! Let's make barbacoa after the fighting's over!<br>
Mary, you're gonna love the– Huh? Where'd Mary go?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">São Martinho：</span><br>
She likely vanished again. Never mind her – focus on wiping out these creatures.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Royal Fortune：</span><br>
Okay! Let's turn these bastards to calamari!<br>
Fire! Fireee!<br>
<br>
KABOOOM!<br>
Before Royal Fortune's guns could hit their target, a barrage flew in from the opposite direction and struck the monster.<br>
Columns of water shoot up, briefly obscuring the half-destroyed wreckage. The creature that calls it home has been nicely grilled.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Royal Fortune：</span><br>
You smell that? It's already crisp and ready to eat!<br>
But how? Who else fired besides me?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Whydah：</span><br>
Look! It was Adventure Galley! She's coming towards us!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Royal Fortune：</span><br>
There ya are, Whydah! Why's she coming after us?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Whydah：</span><br>
Y-you think I'd know?<br>
<br>
While Royal Fortune pulls a puzzled expression, a roar rings out from somewhere in the sea.<br>
A purple shadow jumps out of the water, leaving a great spray of brine in her wake.<br>
Her eyes, filled with bitterness, glare at us. Adventure Galley has sighted us.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Royal Fortune：</span><br>
Those claws, and that vibrant purple hair...<br>
That's it! It's Adventure Galley! She's just how I imagined her!<br>
<br>
Galley's gaze slowly moves towards Royal Fortune, the one who called her name.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Adventure Galley：</span><br>
Hmm?<br>
So it's you lot that ruined my slumber.<br>
Heehee... Hahahahahah!<br>
<br>
Having identified the person behind all the noise, Galley's expression warps into something grim.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Whydah：</span><br>
Uh-oh! UH-OH!<br>
She is FUMING! I think we angered her by waking her up!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Royal Fortune：</span><br>
Uhh...<br>
<br>
Galley lets out a furious roar from having her peaceful sleep disturbed.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Adventure Galley：</span><br>
THIS IS MY DOMAIN!<br>
YOU WILL PAY DEARLY FOR YOUR RACKET!<br>
<br>
Brandishing her great steel claws, she starts charging straight towards the Great Royal Fortune.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">São Martinho：</span><br>
...I, São Martinho, shall be your opponent.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Adventure Galley：</span><br>
You...<br>
Hahahahah! I know you! You're the Invincible Crown!<br>
Perfect! Absolutely perfect!<br>
I couldn't ask for a more worthy opponent!<br>
{{折叠面板|内容结束}}

{{折叠面板|标题=The Showdown|选项=21|主框=1|样式=primary|展开=是}}
<br>
Surprisingly, Adventure Galley does not commit to a fierce attack, despite her indignant posturing with her claws.<br>
Her and São Martinho's engagement is half exchanges of blows, half angry stare-downs. This seems to have an effect on Shipbreak Point, turning the mood grimmer and grimmer.<br>
The sea life, meanwhile, retreats beneath the surface, leaving the shipgirls to their duel.<br>
After testing each other several times, both sides simultaneously prepare their finishing attacks.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">São Martinho：</span><br>
...You are defeated.<br>
<br>
São Martinho points the tip of her lance right before Galley's eyes.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Royal Fortune：</span><br>
Okay, that's enough fighting!<br>
We have a winner! Let's be cordial about this!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Adventure Galley：</span><br>
...You beat me. You've proven your strength.<br>
I'll let you off the hook for disturbing my slumber.<br>
However, I will not be coming along on your little adventure.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Royal Fortune：</span><br>
Huh? Why not?<br>
Don't ya wanna find the Fountain of Youth?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Adventure Galley：</span><br>
The Fountain of Youth? Ah. I know that one well.<br>
A lost ancient artifact, coveted by many an ambitious person.<br>
No. I've learned the cost of such pursuits.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Golden Hind：</span><br>
But Galley, we're on this adventure for the sake of the future~<br>
The Echo Fleet has come back, you see...<br>
If they reach the Fountain of Youth before us, who knows what disaster might befall the world?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Adventure Galley：</span><br>
The Echo Fleet is back? That's news to me.<br>
Even if what you're saying is right, can any of you even prove it?<br>
Perhaps Whydah can. Bring her here and I'll hear her out.<br>
If you can get her to lift a finger for something, I'll believe this is no laughing matter.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Mary Celeste：</span><br>
Ahahahah!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Adventure Galley：</span><br>
What?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Whydah：</span><br>
I'm right here! You think I'm a shut-in or something?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Adventure Galley：</span><br>
You? Outside? I can't believe it!<br>
Also, what is a "shut-in"?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Whydah：</span><br>
It's like... someone who stays inside their cabin or base and doesn't like to touch grass...<br>
As I said, I'm no shut-in! I like touching grass and feeling sunlight on my body!<br>
Anyway, we're getting sidetracked... Just be quiet and I'll explain everything.<br>
...And there you have it. Whew, that was a pain...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Adventure Galley：</span><br>
Now I see the whole picture.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Royal Fortune：</span><br>
Great, so are you gonna help us?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Adventure Galley：</span><br>
If Whydah needs help, then help I will give.<br>
She aided me once, so I will return the favour.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Whydah：</span><br>
Not like I did anything to write home about, but okay...<br>
Oh, right. Let me introduce you... This is the Commander.<br>
The brains of our crew, and a gifted tactician.<br>
<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项1：I hope we can get along.</span>'''''<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Adventure Galley：</span><br>
Heh... Get along. Sure.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Whydah：</span><br>
So, could you show us to the Fountain of Youth?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Adventure Galley：</span><br>
Yes. Right now, if you so need.<br>
However, the path to it isn't a physical place, but rather an idea.<br>
A portal, if you will. Whenever it manifests in our world, it generally assumes the form of a storm.<br>
In other words, to reach the Fountain of Youth, find the storm that leads to it.<br>
Of course, that's easier said than done. There are legends of an artifact that can bring the storm to you, but...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Royal Fortune：</span><br>
Hey, doesn't that sound familiar, Commander? Isn't it how you wound up here?<br>
<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项1：(Take out the golden compass.)</span>'''''<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Royal Fortune：</span><br>
Bingo! I'm sure if we sail into a storm with that thing out, it'll...<br>
...What's it doing? Why's it glowing all of a sudden?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Mary Celeste：</span><br>
Something's happening! Look out!<br>
<br>
Without warning, the dark clouds begin to swirl around Shipwreck Point, and a portal-like hole appears at the heart of it.<br>
While everyone is distracted by the foreboding change of weather, an unwelcome sight emerges from the portal.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
(A Siren... Tester is here?!)<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Tester?：</span><br>
Heehee! Perfect!<br>
You saved me the effort of looking for you.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Golden Hind：</span><br>
Who the hell are you?!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Tester?：</span><br>
You want my name, do you? Sure, I'll extend you that little courtesy.<br>
I am Tester, the one who'll bring the world to its end! Remember this name!<br>
I'll be taking your dear Commander now!<br>
<br>
A colossal wave surged forth from the portal, all but swallowing the Great Royal Fortune whole.<br>
A bumpy and nauseating journey is upon us...<br>

<br>
Mirror Sea - Heart of the Fountain of Youth<br>
Once I regain my footing from that stomach-churning spin, it dawns on me that we're no longer in Shipwreck Point.<br>
The sea is still, the Great Royal Fortune resting in it. Aboard her, our adversary stares us down.<br>
<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项1：That was the roughest greeting I've gotten in a while...</span>'''''<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Tester：</span><br>
How rude. In this sea, a storm's beckoning is the greatest invitation.<br>
This vessel of mine activated at the wrong time, but I've always believed this was it setting me up to do the right thing.<br>
Now that I've found you, I'm fully convinced of it.<br>
Hah! Who would've thought the Black Wolves' flag and a stupid myth would lead you right to me?<br>
That's the providence of fate for you! Ahahahahah!<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
It was you. You created the Black Wolves, didn't you?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Tester：</span><br>
How astute of you. I did.<br>
That bunch of overly curious adventurers served me well.<br>
If they hadn't hoarded all those artifacts from the past, this vessel separated from her mainframe may never have known about her important duty.<br>
And now, I have you. The final piece.<br>
You're the key to obtaining the wisdom fate has in store for me.<br>
The wisdom that'll elevate me to the status of Creator – to the status of God over this world.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
(This vessel has lost connection to her mainframe... That means she's operating without any external reference points or regulators.)<br>
(She must've soaked up this world's culture like a sponge. It would explain her uncharacteristic way of speaking.)<br>
(I might be able to take advantage of that...)<br>
<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项1：I'm going to stop your insane plan.</span>'''''<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Tester：</span><br>
With what? That pathetic fleet of yours?<br>
There is nothing they can do to harm me.<br>
<br>
Tester scoffs and reaches for the activation lever of the Pawn creator next to her.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Mary Celeste：</span><br>
Outta my way!<br>
<br>
KABOOOM!<br>
Mary – who was also transported here – fires her cannons as she charges towards us.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Aha. Now I get why you sent the Echo Fleet after Mary.<br>
She can pass through storms just fine, so she must be a real obstacle to your plan.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Tester：</span><br>
She is. It would've been annoying to deal with that ability of hers.<br>
But not anymore. It doesn't matter now.<br>
Nor does it matter how much you struggle, for it's all in vain.<br>
All will perish once I complete the instruction nested in the deepest parts of me.<br>
Listen carefully. Do you hear it? The grinding of misaligned gears.<br>
That's the sound of war... The sound of the experiments commencing anew!<br>
...What are you laughing for?<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Considering you've completely lost your memory, you're not doing half-bad.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Tester：</span><br>
Trying to play cool, are you? Be a dear and hold still while I wipe that smug grin off your face, "Commander."<br>
<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项1：It's too bad your formation has a glaring flaw.</span>'''''<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Tester：</span><br>
...What are you talking about?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Automatic Warning System：</span><br>
ALERT. PRIMARY LINE OF DEFENSE HAS BEEN BREACHED.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Tester：</span><br>
WHAT?!<br>

<br>
Fifteen minutes prior - Outside the Fountain of Youth<br>
After passing through the storm, the rest of the girls found themselves in the waters surrounding the Fountain of Youth.<br>
An endless cyclone blew before them, and they were surrounded by black, mechanical trees reaching for the clouds. They gave off an unsettling aura.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Adventure Galley：</span><br>
This is it.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Royal Fortune：</span><br>
So... that black cyclone is the Fountain of Youth?<br>
Looks bloody dangerous for a fountain...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">São Martinho：</span><br>
The Echo Fleet is here, too. Are they the supposed Black Wolves?<br>
The ships all fly their banner.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Royal Fortune：</span><br>
So, if you put two and two together...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Golden Hind：</span><br>
The suddenly revived Black Wolves were just a part of the Echo Fleet.<br>
Or, the Black Wolves were always the Echo Fleet in disguise...<br>
The Fountain of Youth is also not a wellspring, but an ancient ruin.<br>
However, I think it's more apt to call it the Echo Fleet's home base~<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Royal Fortune：</span><br>
Hang on! Wasn't it the Black Wolves who spread the rumours about the Fountain?<br>
So that was an outright lie! What they really wanted was to lure unsuspecting people like us into gathering artifacts for them...<br>
It's the worst possible ending! I have no words for my disappointment!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Adventure Galley：</span><br>
You should've curbed your expectations to begin with.<br>
Now, come on. We need to find Mary and the Commander and get out of here.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Whydah：</span><br>
Okay, but how?<br>
There's not enough ammunition between us to take out all the Echo Fleet ships.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Royal Fortune：</span><br>
If we can't beat 'em, let's just charge right through!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Adventure Galley：</span><br>
What, just like that?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Royal Fortune：</span><br>
They're packed together like sardines, so if we rush in at full speed and disrupt their firing lines, we can break through.<br>
...That's what the Commander told me. I'm basically second in command.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">São Martinho：</span><br>
Hmm... It could work.<br>
Just not with so few of us.<br>
<br>
São Martinho raised her lance skywards, and after a moment, her galleon manifests from thin air in the water.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Royal Fortune：</span><br>
Hey... isn't that your ship?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">São Martinho：</span><br>
It is. It took a while to get her to catch up. Luckily, she made it in time.<br>
I hope I'm not the only one who brought her vessel?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Golden Hind：</span><br>
Let's just say I run a small business~<br>
<br>
As Golden Hind finished speaking, a fleet consisting of mass-produced vessels emerged from the mist on the horizon.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Golden Hind：</span><br>
Whydah, why don't you show your hand already?<br>
I highly doubt an esteemed New World pirate would venture out without a fleet at the ready~<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Whydah：</span><br>
Heheh. So you noticed...<br>
Okay, I'm tired of playing pretend... Truth be told, my fleet is already here.<br>
<br>
On Whydah's command, her ships rose from the sea once after the next, banners raised.<br>
In but the blink of an eye, a great fleet had assembled. Though the Echo Fleet outnumbered them, the girls' fleet had superior deployment.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Royal Fortune：</span><br>
Huh?<br>
W-well, I'll constitute a fleet by myself if I have to!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Adventure Galley：</span><br>
You don't NEED to get involved.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Royal Fortune：</span><br>
Hey, now, I did bring backup! Behold! The best ships money can buy... Ahaha...<br>
<br>
Royal Fortune gestured towards a pathetic group of mass-produced ships. Behind her forced smile, she was on the verge of tears.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">São Martinho：</span><br>
It's okay. Instead, you can be our commanding officer.<br>
Show us what wisdom the Commander imparted to you.<br>

<br>
Not long after the fighting broke out, all of Tester's confidence evaporated away.<br>
Having been cut off from her mainframe for so long, she lacks even the most basic tactical knowledge even if her hardware is impressive.<br>
......<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Automatic Warning System：</span><br>
ALERT. DAMAGE INCURRED DUE TO DROP INACCURACY.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Tester：</span><br>

2nd unit, don't crumble yet!<br>

EXECUTING... ERROR. CANNOT EXECUTE. RISK OF COLLISSION DUE TO UNIT PROXIMITY TOO HIGH.<br>
ALERT. SERIOUS DAMAGE SUSTAINED.<br>
<br>
Not only are her warships with big cannons rubbing shoulders, but her many bombing ships are, too.<br>
This shortsighted positioning backfires – friendly fire sets off a series of explosions, and a good part of her forces are wiped out in an instant.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Tester：</span><br>
No! Nooo! My fleet!<br>
What did you do?!<br>
Spit it out, "Commander"! What did you DO to my fleet?!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Automatic Warning System：</span><br>
ALERT. FINAL LINE OF DEFENSE HAS BEEN BREACHED.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Royal Fortune：</span><br>
Hey, you! The scallywag on the big ship!<br>
Lay down your arms and surrender!<br>
If you don't, we'll blast you to kingdom come!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Tester：</span><br>
Hah! You wish, you little brat!<br>
Stay there so I can end you!<br>
<br>
Tester leaps off the side of her ship, summons her rigging, and goes into battle...<br>
Leaving behind the device she used to monitor the battlefield right where she sat.<br>

<br>
The booming of cannon fire is drawing closer as the shipgirls tighten the noose around Tester.<br>
At the center of the encirclement, Mary Celeste is running circles around the Siren, vanishing and reappearing nonstop.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Tester：</span><br>
Damned little rat, darting from place to place!<br>
How are the scanners I've collected unable to track you?!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Mary Celeste：</span><br>
Your little gadgets can't offset a skill I've practiced for many years.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">São Martinho：</span><br>
We've arrived, Mary... Hmm? Is she the Black Wolves' leader?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Mary Celeste：</span><br>
Sure is. The person behind their lies, and the master of the Echo Fleet.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">São Martinho：</span><br>
Then we've found the perpetrator of the attacks on Thalassopolis.<br>
Now has come the time for repentance.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Tester：</span><br>
You... The Invincible Crown...<br>
<br>
Seeing the approaching shipgirls, Tester's eyes become filled with agitation and fear.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Mary Celeste：</span><br>
The crew is all here.<br>
Now it's our turn to go on the offensive.<br>
Time to start coming up with a plea for your life, Tester!<br>

<br>
While Mary Celeste and São Martinho engage Tester in battle, the rest of the girls board the ship she's keeping me on.<br>
Royal Fortune sees that I'm okay, and immediately runs over to hug me.<br>
<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项1：Okay, okay... Give me some breathing space.</span>'''''<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项2：You're kind of choking me...</span>'''''<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Royal Fortune：</span><br>
Oh! Sorry, sorry!<br>
I was just so glad I couldn't help myself! Thank god you're alright!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Golden Hind：</span><br>
And to think you were so down just a minute ago~<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Royal Fortune：</span><br>
Shut up! I'm Tempesta's leader. We'd be screwed if I lost my cool.<br>
<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项1：You did great.</span>'''''<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Royal Fortune：</span><br>
Whoa...<br>
Um... Thank you...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Adventure Galley：</span><br>
Alright, that's enough of a heartfelt reunion. Let's go back up Mary and São.<br>
Assuming they haven't already won, anyway...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">São Martinho：</span><br>
Surrender. You have nowhere left to flee.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Tester：</span><br>
Heheh... Hahahaha!<br>
If this is how it ends, I'm taking you with me!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Whydah：</span><br>
What's she doing?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Mary Celeste：</span><br>
...Trying to summon a storm. A really, really big one!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">São Martinho：</span><br>
Then we must stop her!<br>
She must be getting a great amount of power from somewhere...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Whydah：</span><br>
It's gotta be the Fountain of Youth!<br>
That big machine tower is the source!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Golden Hind：</span><br>
Let's just destroy that, then!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Royal Fortune：</span><br>
How? It's humongous!<br>
Think, think... Oh, I know! Whydah, can you use your grimoire to summon more meteors?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Whydah：</span><br>
Uhh, let me ask!<br>
Terminal, you still with me?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Grimoire Terminal：</span><br>
Affirmative, Whydah the Magnificent.<br>
Do not worry. I will support you as best as I can.<br>

'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项1：(Place your hand on the screen.)</span>'''''<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Grimoire Terminal：</span><br>
Firing command received.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Whydah：</span><br>
It... actually worked!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Tester：</span><br>
What is that...?<br>
No! This can't be! That treasure belongs to ME!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Mary Celeste：</span><br>
Now! Keep up the pressure!<br>
<br>
Tester tries her best to protect herself against the attacks while the "meteors" break through the storm and impact the Fountain of Youth.<br>
Then, just like that, the storm dissipates.<br>
With her power source annihilated, Tester squirms a final few times before she sinks beneath the waves.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Mary Celeste：</span><br>
Is it over?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">São Martinho：</span><br>
Yes. It's over.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Golden Hind：</span><br>
Looks like it is.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Royal Fortune：</span><br>
Yeah! Get in there! We're having a victory banquet tonight!<br>
Galley, can we host it at Shipwreck Point? We haven't tried the seafood we left there!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Adventure Galley：</span><br>
Seafood? You mean the creature inside that ship?<br>
You know what? Knock yourselves out...<br>
<br>
And so, our adventure reaches its conclusion.<br>
But our story, that has only just begun...<br>

New World - Shipwreck Point - Evening<br>
The feast to celebrate our victory has ended, and stillness has returned to the sea.<br>
A storm – the gateway between worlds – is approaching. It's almost time for me to say goodbye.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Royal Fortune：</span><br>
Whaddya think? I'd say my barbacoa is just as good as yours!<br>
This meat is one of a kind, too. Throw these tentacles on the grill, and you've got yourself a chewy treat.<br>
<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项1：It's no wonder, since they could withstand cannonballs.</span>'''''<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Royal Fortune：</span><br>
Oh, yeah, true!<br>
Yeah... Makes sense...<br>
...Are you really leaving?<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Mary spent way too long looking for the storm Singularity for me to go, "Actually, forget about it" now.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Royal Fortune：</span><br>
Aww. I see...<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Hey, it's better to leave on a high note than to drag your feet, right?<br>
Here. This is for you.<br>
<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项1：(Give her the golden compass.)</span>'''''<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Royal Fortune：</span><br>
Really? Shouldn't you hold on to it?<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
I'm sure it'll serve you well one day.<br>
Now, I think it's time I be on my way.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Royal Fortune：</span><br>
Okay. May the winds of fortune carry your sails.<br>
I'll never forget about you, Commander!<br>
I'll write you, I promise!<br>
We'll meet again sometime!<br>
...<br>
<br>
......<br>
.........<br>
Royal Fortune's voice grows more and more distant as my ship sails into the storm.<br>
My heart feels heavy to part ways like this...<br>
But then I think to myself, "We WILL meet again," and the weight lessens a little.<br>
With the compass now in her hands, a bridge has been forged between the past and the present.<br>
All that remains is to take the first step towards an unknown future.<br>
The End...?<br>

<br>
Somewhere in Thalassopolis...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">São Martinho：</span><br>
The news about the Echo Fleet has already spread far and wide. In light of the situation, I suspect the cities will create a new union.<br>
The darkness we never knew surrounded us has become apparent. The people must adapt and make changes.<br>
Unfortunately, they already struggle to cope with the recent surge in natural disasters.<br>
I do not believe this is a coincidence, but an orchestrated effort by some nefarious party.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Adventure Galley：</span><br>
Could be. For all we know, that Tester woman may only have been one of many unknowns in the world.<br>
I'm sure the people of Thalasso will find a way through the darkness.<br>
Alas, that sort of life is not for me.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">São Martinho：</span><br>
So you say, and yet, here you are right now.<br>
You've changed. How come?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Adventure Galley：</span><br>
Well... Back in my swashbuckling days, I was told a prophecy.<br>
That one day, I would be visited by a strange bunch, and their leader would reveal the truth about the world.<br>
And then, I would find a place to call home.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">São Martinho：</span><br>
What does that mean?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Adventure Galley：</span><br>
A port? A house? Spiritual fulfilment? Could be anything.<br>
I used to dismiss it as dumb rubbish, but now I've started believing in it.<br>
We need the Commander's strength.<br>
So I decided to join Tempesta and work with Royal Fortune as a Star Wayfinder, exploring storms.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">São Martinho：</span><br>
Ah, that project to find other branches using storms?<br>
I've heard Royal Fortune has succeeded a couple of times.<br>
I've also heard that it's extremely dangerous on the other side of the storm.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Adventure Galley：</span><br>
No venture is without perils. The New World had them, too. She knows the risks.<br>
But, we are explorers in a vast sea, and must always carry the spirit of curiosity in our hearts.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">São Martinho：</span><br>
Indeed.<br>
When the time comes, we'll be ready...<br>
<br>
The End<br>
