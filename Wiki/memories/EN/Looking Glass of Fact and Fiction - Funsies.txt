<br>
Chapter 1: Same Face<br>
Port - Dormitory<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Natsuiro Matsuri：</span><br>
Hear me out, Fubuki. Kawakaze is way too cute, right? But the real-life version is a hundred times cuter!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Shirakami Fubuki：</span><br>
Matsuri, are you trying to hit on me again...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Natsuiro Matsuri：</span><br>
I'm not just saying that because she looks like you, really! I mean it in a completely pure way. Kawakaze is totally cute, like in general.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Minato Aqua：</span><br>
Oh my, she sounds kind of hot...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Shirakami Fubuki：</span><br>
W-wait, don't be deceived, Aqua! If it's a matter of sounding manly, Kuro can pull off the same thing!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Murasaki Shion：</span><br>
Why are you using someone else to compete for you?!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Shirakami Fubuki：</span><br>
Ehehe, what belongs to Kuro, also belongs to me~<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Nakiri Ayame：</span><br>
Hmm... speaking of similarities, there is also a ship who bears my likeness.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Minato Aqua：</span><br>
Eh? Really?!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Nakiri Ayame：</span><br>
Indeed. Just wait a moment and I'll show you.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Yuudachi：</span><br>
Ayame, you said that there's gonna be something delicious, right?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Nakiri Ayame：</span><br>
Mmhmm. We are just chatting, so do feel free to partake of some snacks with us~<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Yuudachi：</span><br>
Waooo! How generous of you!!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Tokino Sora：</span><br>
Good afternoon everyone, it's Tokino Sora~ Oh, look at all the cuties here! My, doesn't she look a bit like Ayame?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Natsuiro Matsuri：</span><br>
Sora, don't you think they look like a pair of puppy dogs? See, they totally do!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Yuudachi：</span><br>
Yuudachi is no dog!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Nakiri Ayame：</span><br>
Ay am not a dog!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Tokino Sora：</span><br>
Ahaha, sorry, sorry. You're both very cute girls~<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ookami Mio：</span><br>
Hmm... Dog or not, this girl does resemble Ayame in many ways.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Nakiri Ayame：</span><br>
Right, right~? Ay encountered Yuudachi while out for a walk, so she is the first friend that I have made here!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Yuudachi：</span><br>
That's right! She's a nice person who gave me something to eat right away!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Everyone：</span><br>
......<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Nakiri Ayame：</span><br>
... It definitely was not because she reminded me of a puppy, understood?!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Shirakami Fubuki：</span><br>
Ahaha... When you brought up the topic of look-a-likes, I thought for sure you'd mention Izumo, but it turned out to be Yuudachi~<br>
Izumo is an Oni just like Ayame! Ooh...! I totally wanted to see you two co-starring in some kind of show or collaboration... But, but, just seeing the two of you stand next to each other is good enough~!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Izumo：</span><br>
Ayame! Weren't we just talking about a training regimen to improve your physical endurance? Why'd you suddenly run off?!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Nakiri Ayame：</span><br>
Bleh...! Even Ay do not wish to be put through that hellish training!<br>
But first, Ay must beat a hasty retreat! See you lateroni~☆<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Izumo：</span><br>
Hey, wait! Get back here!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ookami Mio：</span><br>
Woah. Look at how fast those two are running.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Tokino Sora：</span><br>
Things sure are energetic here at this port~<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Natsuiro Matsuri：</span><br>
Actually, there are plenty of girls who I'd like you all to meet!<br>
They might not look like me... but they have the same awesome Matsuri energy!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ookami Mio：</span><br>
Ehh? Really?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Natsuiro Matsuri：</span><br>
It's true! Hold on, I'll go get them~<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Shirakami Fubuki：</span><br>
The same energy...? Crap, did she meet that girl...?!<br>

<br>
Chapter 2: Same Energy<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Murasaki Shion：</span><br>
Fubuki, you don't look so good. Are you getting sick~?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Shirakami Fubuki：</span><br>
Ah, no, I'm fine... It's just that... I think I know who Matsuri is talking about...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Minato Aqua：</span><br>
Is she scary?!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Shirakami Fubuki：</span><br>
Scary...? Ah, well, maybe in a sense...?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Natsuiro Matsuri：</span><br>
Sorry to keep you waiting~! I've brought her with me!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ooshio：</span><br>
'ello, fine ladies of Hololive! The name's Ooshio, from the Sakura Empire, and it's a pleasure meetin' y'all!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Shirakami Fubuki：</span><br>
Huh? Ooshio...?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Natsuiro Matsuri：</span><br>
Yeah, it's Ooshio. Fubuki, who'd you think it was?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Shirakami Fubuki：</span><br>
Um, Ark something... Nevermind!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Murasaki Shion：</span><br>
Ooshio... looks like a normal, pure girl. How's she anything like this sexual harassment fiend?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ooshio：</span><br>
A pure girl, huh... Ehehe, thanks for the praise, pretty ladies~<br>
As a matter of fact, I've been dyin' to show y'all around the port since ye got here. I'm glad Matsuri here finally gave me the opportunity~<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ookami Mio：</span><br>
(Hey, Fubuki... This aura, could it be...)<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Shirakami Fubuki：</span><br>
(Yeah, Mio, it definitely is...)<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Natsuiro Matsuri：</span><br>
Just like me, Ooshio is overflowing with love for all the cute girls in the world!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Minato Aqua：</span><br>
......<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Murasaki Shion：</span><br>
Eww... Another dangerous one...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Tokino Sora：</span><br>
Huh? It's normal to like cute girls... right? Why do you all look like you found a half-eaten worm in your apple?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ookami Mio：</span><br>
It might be normal for most people, but in Matsuri's case... how do I put this, it goes a bit overboard...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Tokino Sora：</span><br>
Huh? Ehhhh?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Natsuiro Matsuri：</span><br>
Basically, I totally met Ooshio by chance, and we instantly became best friends!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ooshio：</span><br>
That's right! Matsuri and I both share a passion for the most important hobby!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Murasaki Shion：</span><br>
Unbelievable... This pure-looking girl shares the same hobby as Matsuri...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Natsuiro Matsuri：</span><br>
Oi, wait a second, aren't I also a pure and cute maiden of Hololive? Cute girls being drawn to each other is as natural as breathin'! That's why Ooshio also loves me!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Murasaki Shion：</span><br>
Oh no, not her "breathing" again!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Shirakami Fubuki：</span><br>
For Matsuri, to breathe is to have an affair... I feel like Ooshio and Matsuri are two people who never should have met...<br>

<br>
Chapter 3: Similar Traits<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ookami Mio：</span><br>
Anyways, we also have a new friend over here.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Shirakami Fubuki：</span><br>
Ehh?! Mio, you as well? When did this happen?!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ookami Mio：</span><br>
That's a bit of an overreaction, Fubuki... Her name's Friedrich der Grosse, and we get along really well.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Shirakami Fubuki：</span><br>
Th-that Friedrich der Grosse?! Mio, how in the world did that happen?!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ookami Mio：</span><br>
Umm... we were talking about how to handle children and stuff?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Shirakami Fubuki：</span><br>
I see... She's a bit of a motherly character then. Phew, at least it wasn't over something weird...<br>
It'd really suck if Mio turned over to the dark side and became a last boss or something~<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ookami Mio：</span><br>
Haha... It's true that she might seem intimidating, but she's actually caring and kind.<br>
I'm sure your impression of her would change too if you got to know her better, Fubuki.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Shirakami Fubuki：</span><br>
Is... is that so...?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Belfast：</span><br>
Pardon me for intruding upon your conversation.<br>
Madam Tokino, Madam Illustrious wanted me to inform you that the tea party is about to commence.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Tokino Sora：</span><br>
Oh my, I wasn't watching the time! I'll be there, and thanks for reminding me, Miss Belfast!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Belfast：</span><br>
The pleasure is mine. It's my duty as a maid, after all.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Tokino Sora：</span><br>
Sorry, everyone. I promised to go to the Royal Navy's tea party, so I'll talk more later.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Shirakami Fubuki：</span><br>
As expected of Sora. Of course she'd get invited to a Royal tea party.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Belfast：</span><br>
Would you like to come with us, Miss Aqua? I heard the other day that you were interested in the Royal Maids, so I would be glad to offer you a demonstration of our operations.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Minato Aqua：</span><br>
Um, yes please! Thank you very much, Miss Belfast!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Shirakami Fubuki：</span><br>
Aqua's going to receive training from the Royal Maids?! An experienced maid training her junior? Ahh~ so much wholesome goodness~ Yes, yesh!<br>
She doesn't normally do many maid-like things, so she might struggle a bit... but even that's going to be so precious...!<br>
It seems like it'll take a while to fix the server's warp gate, but at least everyone here is super nice!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Murasaki Shion：</span><br>
Mmhm! As a magician, I do believe that the air in this world is better for my skin!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Shirakami Fubuki：</span><br>
Shion, did you make new friends too?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Murasaki Shion：</span><br>
Huh? Didn't I already tell you? I'm getting along just fine with L'Opiniâtre.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Shirakami Fubuki：</span><br>
Ohh! L'Opiniâtre! She's that Iris Libre ship who calls herself a magician! Can she really use magic?!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Murasaki Shion：</span><br>
Heheh~ Who knows~<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Shirakami Fubuki：</span><br>
Eh? I've been curious ever since I saw her outfit! Tell me~!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Murasaki Shion：</span><br>
Don't wanna~! That's a secret between fellow magicians!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Shirakami Fubuki：</span><br>
Haah... a couple of magicians together are also precious~! Wait, wait, Shion~! Tell me~!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Murasaki Shion：</span><br>
No... way! Blehhhh!<br>

Chapter 4: A Peaceful World<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Murasaki Shion：</span><br>
Owww...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Vestal：</span><br>
There, there. It'll be better soon.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Kawakaze：</span><br>
You're too reckless, Shion. If I hadn't been there, you wouldn't have gotten away with just these injuries.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Murasaki Shion：</span><br>
But there were only a few enemies, so I thought I'd be fine...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Kawakaze：</span><br>
There are no buts on the battlefield.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Murasaki Shion：</span><br>
Sorry...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Vestal：</span><br>
Kawakaze, don't be too harsh on them, all right?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Kawakaze：</span><br>
... Understood.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Shirakami Fubuki：</span><br>
Ahaha... We'll need some time to get used to a new environment after all. Mmhmm!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Kawakaze：</span><br>
I didn't get to ask you before while we were in the Mirror Seas, but, just what kind of world are you from?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Murasaki Shion：</span><br>
The world we're from, huh? Hmm, I guess it's pretty normal? Strange things happen every now and then, but it's not as dangerous as this one.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Shirakami Fubuki：</span><br>
Yeah, that's true... We don't have any large-scale global conflicts or Siren invasions... So I guess it's pretty peaceful.<br>
So, when we came to this world and were told that we have to fight, we didn't really know what to think...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Kawakaze：</span><br>
War is not a game.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Shirakami Fubuki：</span><br>
Sorry... Even though we know that the enemy is right in front of us, we can't really get ourselves to attack without hesitation like you can...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Kawakaze：</span><br>
... I see...<br>
Could you tell me a bit more about where you're from?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Shirakami Fubuki：</span><br>
Huh?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Kawakaze：</span><br>
I want to learn more about this "normal world," a place without wars. It has me interested.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Shirakami Fubuki：</span><br>
Well, daily life is about the same as it is here. Do what you want to do, live life the way you want... and sometimes, work hard to make your dreams come true...<br>
And in reality, things aren't always peaceful either. But at least where we come from, none of us ever have to think about fighting.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Kawakaze：</span><br>
I see, so that's what your world is like.<br>
... It seems kind of like what that person envisioned.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Shirakami Fubuki：</span><br>
By "that person," do you mean the Commander?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Kawakaze：</span><br>
... ... ...<br>
Who knows. Maybe sending that person back along with you might not be a bad idea.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Shirakami Fubuki：</span><br>
Ehehe~ Even though you're always cool and collected, you really care about the commander, don't you, Kawakaze? Whew~!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Kawakaze：</span><br>
... Nobody said that.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Shirakami Fubuki：</span><br>
Sure, sure~♪<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Murasaki Shion：</span><br>
Hey, you have an injured person here still! Shouldn't you be taking care of me more...?!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Kawakaze：</span><br>
... If you can yell that loudly, you probably aren't that injured. Anyway, try to rest up for the time being, since we will have more missions later.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Shirakami Fubuki：</span><br>
Hey Shion, just between the two of us, but after you charged out alone, Kawakaze was the first one to go after you.<br>
Even though she talks like that, she might care the most about her companions deep down.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Murasaki Shion：</span><br>
Is that so...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Shirakami Fubuki：</span><br>
Ah, but I already knew that because I gave Kawakaze a pledge ring a long time ago in the game. She's super nice and friendly, you know!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Murasaki Shion：</span><br>
All that buildup was just for that...?!<br>

<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Shirakami Fubuki：</span><br>
Over here, over here!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Admiral Hipper：</span><br>
Haah?! Did I give you permission to touch me?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Shirakami Fubuki：</span><br>
W-woah, it's the same reaction!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Admiral Hipper：</span><br>
... What's the matter with you, weirdo?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Shirakami Fubuki：</span><br>
Ah, sorry! I'm Shirakami Fubuki, and I just recently joined the fleet. It's a pleasure to meet you.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Admiral Hipper：</span><br>
A new face, huh... I'm Iron Blood's Admiral Hipper.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Shirakami Fubuki：</span><br>
Can I be your friend?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Admiral Hipper：</span><br>
Haah? F-fine, do as you please.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Prinz Eugen：</span><br>
Oh my, Hipper. I see you're as bad at dealing with the straightforward types as ever.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Admiral Hipper：</span><br>
Eugen, when'd you get here?! How many times have I told you not to go around eavesdropping?!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Prinz Eugen：</span><br>
Eavesdropping? I was just passing through.<br>
You're Shirakami Fubuki, right? You should be careful if you want to be Hipper's friend. She has a pretty short temper.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Admiral Hipper：</span><br>
Haah? It's none of your business, so buzz off!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Prinz Eugen：</span><br>
Sure, sure. Hope you don't scare her off then~<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Admiral Hipper：</span><br>
Eu...gen...!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Prinz Eugen：</span><br>
Ooh, scary~♪<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Shirakami Fubuki：</span><br>
I see, I see~! That's how it is! So that's how you two talk to each other~!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Admiral Hipper：</span><br>
Don't pay any heed to what she said!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Shirakami Fubuki：</span><br>
Sure thing! I already know!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Admiral Hipper：</span><br>
Know what...? In any case, I'm going to see that dumb Commander right now. Want to come with me?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Shirakami Fubuki：</span><br>
Ooh, this is my chance! I'd love to~!<br>

Port - Dormitory<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Long Island：</span><br>
I have the master key on this save file. Take the lift, exit the tower, and then cross the canyon...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Minato Aqua：</span><br>
I see! I totally get it!<br>
Long Island, I think I know how to do it now! You can head back if you're busy.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Long Island：</span><br>
Hmm... are you sure? This map is pretty difficult, you know?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Minato Aqua：</span><br>
Piece of cake! I've played games just like this before!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Long Island：</span><br>
All righty, do your best then~<br>
Thanks for waiting for me. Let's go ahead and continue! I haven't had a chance to play this game before, so let's split up and explore!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ookami Mio：</span><br>
I'll head over here then~<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Long Island：</span><br>
Oh... this should be the correct route!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ookami Mio：</span><br>
I've found some clues over here too!<br>
Hmm, how strange~ There's a game just like this where I'm from. There are a lot of things our worlds have in common...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Long Island：</span><br>
Eh, really?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ookami Mio：</span><br>
That's right~ For example, you get your starting equipment from the king and stuff.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Long Island：</span><br>
Well, this is a classic after all~<br>
Ah! That's it! Mio, pass me those materials! I'm gonna craft something!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ookami Mio：</span><br>
That makes sense? There's a classic just like this where we're from too. If I recall, Aqua was playing a similar game.<br>
Ah, I found some items over here as well. Hold on a moment.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Long Island：</span><br>
Hmm... But, that game is a little different... it always changes things up on you no matter how many times you play.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Minato Aqua：</span><br>
Gaaahhh!! Where am I?! Why is there an Elite mob over here?!?!<br>
I'm sorry! I'm sorry! I'm sorry! I'm sorry! Waaaaah!!<br>
Neeeeeeee!! I don't wanna die!!!!!!!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Long Island：</span><br>
... ... ...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ookami Mio：</span><br>
Ahahahha! Well, that's Aqua for you.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Minato Aqua：</span><br>
We're trying this again! I won't give up!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ookami Mio：</span><br>
Aqua, isn't it about time to give it a rest? It's already nighttime.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Minato Aqua：</span><br>
Eh? Night doesn't begin until the date changes.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Long Island：</span><br>
That's right! The night hasn't even begun yet!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ookami Mio：</span><br>
I'm not buying that. Staying up late is bad for your health.<br>
Games may be important, but your health is the most important. You won't be able to fully enjoy your games if you aren't healthy.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Long Island：</span><br>
Nnngh... there's no denying that...<br>
Mio, you're acting just like a mother.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Minato Aqua：</span><br>
That's because Mio was number one in Hololive's "Wants to Become a Mom" rankings! Right, Mama Mio?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ookami Mio：</span><br>
Not you too, Aqua!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Minato Aqua：</span><br>
Mama Mio~ I want you to pack me a lunch today~<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Long Island：</span><br>
Mama Mio, me too~<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ookami Mio：</span><br>
... If you hurry up and go to bed, I'll consider it.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Minato Aqua & Long Island：</span><br>
Okay~!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ookami Mio：</span><br>
*sigh*... Why are they treating me like their mom anyway~?!<br>

Chapter 7: Kagura Dance<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Tokino Sora：</span><br>
Is everyone here?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Shirakami Fubuki：</span><br>
Oh, looks like Shion isn't here yet!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Minato Aqua：</span><br>
I bet she overslept again~<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Murasaki Shion：</span><br>
I heard that, Aqua!!!<br>
Jeez... It just took me a while to find my way! Don't just always assume that I overslept!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Tokino Sora：</span><br>
You're actually a few minutes early. Good job, Shion~!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Murasaki Shion：</span><br>
Don't treat me like a kid... Um, but since it's you, Sora, I guess it's fine.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Nakiri Ayame：</span><br>
Is it finally time to go sightseeing? Ay can't wait~<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ookami Mio：</span><br>
Matsuri, what's with that look?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Natsuiro Matsuri：</span><br>
Sakura Empire... Floofy catgirl destroyers... Ehehe... Ehehehe...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Shirakami Fubuki：</span><br>
... Sora, I think everyone's here~<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Tokino Sora：</span><br>
All right. Let's head out immediately so we don't keep our hosts waiting.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Kawakaze：</span><br>
Welcome to Lady Nagato's castle.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Shirakami Fubuki：</span><br>
Ah, Kawakaze!!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Kawakaze：</span><br>
P-Personal space...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Tokino Sora：</span><br>
Huh? Kawakaze, are you going to be our guide?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Kawakaze：</span><br>
Lady Nagato was most pleased to hear that you would be visiting her castle. I was selected to be your guide.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Tokino Sora：</span><br>
Thank you very much. We're not bothering you in any way, are we...?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Kawakaze：</span><br>
Not at all. Rather, Lady Nagato said that guests are welcome here.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Shirakami Fubuki：</span><br>
I want to see all the different factions eventually, but we just had to start with the Sakura Empire~!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Fusou：</span><br>
Everyone, thank you for making the arduous trip here.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Shirakami Fubuki：</span><br>
Huh? Why is Fusou here?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Fusou：</span><br>
Lady Nagato asked us to put on a performance to welcome all of you here.<br>
If it suits you, would you like to watch us practice our Kagura dances for a little while?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Yamashiro：</span><br>
Sure... But, um, I'm still practicing over here...<br>
Please enjoy the Sakura Empire's traditional Kagura dances to the fullest!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Fusou：</span><br>
Yamashiro, you don't have to be so nervous!<br>
In any case, girls who visited our world from Hololive, please enjoy your stay here.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ookami Mio：</span><br>
A splendid dance... It feels like my soul has been cleansed~<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Minato Aqua：</span><br>
Such a beautiful shrine maiden... so they really do exist...!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Shirakami Fubuki：</span><br>
Matsuri, why aren't you saying anything? Are you still with us?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Natsuiro Matsuri：</span><br>
...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Tokino Sora：</span><br>
What's the matter, Matsuri? Are you spacing out?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Shirakami Fubuki：</span><br>
Sora, don't worry about her. This is just part of her normal routine.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Kawakaze：</span><br>
It seems like you're all quite satisfied.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Murasaki Shion：</span><br>
Of course! That was absolutely amazing!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Kawakaze：</span><br>
Then, let us continue to the next show.<br>

Chapter 8: Sakura War Dance<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ise：</span><br>
So you've come, travellers from afar.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Hyuuga：</span><br>
Lady Nagato gave us a special order to show the greatest hospitality to our guests.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Shirakami Fubuki：</span><br>
It's Ise and Hyuuga this time! Surely that means...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Hyuuga：</span><br>
Very perceptive. You are about to be treated to a traditional Sakura Empire war dance.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Nakiri Ayame：</span><br>
Hm? Why are you looking at me with that strange expression...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ise：</span><br>
Nay, I was just thinking... it wouldn't be very exciting with just the two of us. Would you like to join us, Madam Oni?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Nakiri Ayame：</span><br>
Hmmm... You leave me with no choice then. Ay shall demonstrate my greatness as an Oni goddess for which Ay am renowned!<br>
How long will you be able to stand before the unleashed power of my true form?!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ise：</span><br>
Ahaha! Now we're talking! Hyuuga, now's not the time to hold back!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Kawakaze：</span><br>
No, they're our guests, so you should still show some restraint...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ise&Hyuuga：</span><br>
Ise-class Battleships, forward!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Murasaki Shion：</span><br>
No way! Since when was Ayame such a powerful character?! She's fighting those two battle maniacs on equal footing?!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Minato Aqua：</span><br>
Whew... L-let's all make sure we never make Ayame angry...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Natsuiro Matsuri：</span><br>
*huff* *huff*... Sweaty girls intertwining around each other... *huff*<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Shirakami Fubuki：</span><br>
MATSURI!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ookami Mio：</span><br>
So this is the Sakura Empire's "war dance"... Ahaha, I see. We certainly do have some cultural differences.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ise：</span><br>
Not bad at alll.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Hyuuga：</span><br>
And what more, our audience seems quite thrilled.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Nakiri Ayame：</span><br>
Aah... Phew... that was exhausting!<br>
Ay... have returned... from hell...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Shirakami Fubuki：</span><br>
Ayame, according to your backstory, didn't you originally come from a pretty hellish place?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Nakiri Ayame：</span><br>
Ay hail from... the Demon Realm...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Tokino Sora：</span><br>
All right, all right, let Ayame rest first, and save the chatter for later.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ookami Mio：</span><br>
I brought a thermos cup. Here, have some tea~<br>

Chapter 9: The Great Castle<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Kawakaze：</span><br>
... Lady Nagato appears to still be in the midst of her nap.<br>
<br>
（door opens）<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Nagato：</span><br>
Kawakaze... are they already here? I still require my midday respite...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Murasaki Shion：</span><br>
So cute!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Natsuiro Matsuri：</span><br>
Ahhh~ What is this adorable creature? No, she's an angel! An angel, I tell you!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Shirakami Fubuki：</span><br>
Yes indeed! For once, I'll admit that I agree with Matsuri!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Kawakaze：</span><br>
L-Lady Nagato...?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Nagato：</span><br>
... ... ...<br>
Gah...?! Wh-who are you?!<br>
My sincerest apologies for my reaction earlier. I must offer my apologies as the Priestess of the Sakura Empire.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Kawakaze：</span><br>
Lady Nagato, you don't need to...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ookami Mio：</span><br>
She no longer seems like she's being put on a pedestal. If anything, she's way more approachable this way.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Tokino Sora：</span><br>
She looks just like a cute little girl from the neighborhood~<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Natsuiro Matsuri：</span><br>
Hnnnggghhhh...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Nagato：</span><br>
I see. You saw Fusou and Yamashiro's Kagura dance, as well as Ise and Hyuuga's war dance.<br>
Moreover, Ise and Hyuuga even got Miss Ayame over there involved...<br>
Hmm... I must say that I chose the welcoming committee poorly.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ookami Mio：</span><br>
Not at all! Don't worry about it. Thank you for your concern.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Nagato：</span><br>
... Hiei will be preparing tonight's banquet. Until then, please make yourselves comfortable here.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Shirakami Fubuki：</span><br>
Want to play with us, Lady Nagato?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Nagato：</span><br>
I don't know...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Tokino Sora：</span><br>
You should come play with us, cutie~♪<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Nagato：</span><br>
C-cutie?! ...Mutsu, where'd you come from?!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Mutsu：</span><br>
Nagato, why didn't you tell me that your guests were already here? And why didn't you let me throw a welcoming party for them? I was trying really hard to come up with something too...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Nagato：</span><br>
I, I already told you... I would be handling the welcoming events!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Mutsu：</span><br>
That's fine and good, but, why don't you go play with them right now? Isn't it boring sitting around all day? They want to play with you, so why not?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Nagato：</span><br>
Nnnnh... F-fine, if you insist...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Mutsu：</span><br>
Yaay~!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Nagato：</span><br>
Because of my duties as the Priestess, I cannot join them in merriment. However, it is within my power to give them a tour of the castle! Kawakaze, prepare me a change of clothes!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Kawakaze：</span><br>
At once!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Murasaki Shion：</span><br>
... Hmm, does that girl named Mutsu not seem quite precocious? She reminds me of myself.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Kawakaze：</span><br>
Ah, that is Lady Nagato's little sister. As you can see, she assists with preparations for the Sakura Empire's various festivals.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Nakiri Ayame：</span><br>
And she is much cuter than Shion.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Murasaki Shion：</span><br>
What?! Nonsense! She's at most just as cute as I am! And probably not quite as smart as me!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Nakiri Ayame：</span><br>
Sure, sure.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Kawakaze：</span><br>
... With the Commander's support, Lady Nagato's emotions have become calmer and calmer.<br>
This castle as well has more visitors than it did in the past. Having that said though, this castle is still a bit too big for her...<br>
That's why Lady Nagato was really looking forward to your visit.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Shirakami Fubuki：</span><br>
Yeah, we already knew that! Nagato's selling point is her gap moe!<br>
Since we're all here, let's play with Nagato~!<br>
<br>
The girls' joyful voices resounded from the building protected by the towering walls of the castle.<br>
... Thanks to them, the castle was very lively today.<br>

<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Natsuiro Matsuri：</span><br>
Leader, this is the device! You should already know how to use it.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Minato Aqua：</span><br>
Muahahaha! Ahahaha! The fact that you've crossed through such treacherous waters to come here is proof of the spark of rebellion inside of you, waiting to be lit! Behold!<br>
The sea of TNT that stretches out before our eyes! Should we join hands, not just the Hololive Headquarters, but even the Commander's Office will...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Tokino Sora：</span><br>
TNT? Commander's Office? What are you talking about?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Minato Aqua：</span><br>
Haaaaaaah! Soraaaaaaa! Ah, ummmm, this is.. um......<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Nakiri Ayame：</span><br>
She seems to have something unconscionable related to arson...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Murasaki Shion：</span><br>
We're doing this again?!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ookami Mio：</span><br>
Well, since we're all here, let's get going. A new adventure is waiting for us! Fubuki, are you coming?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Shirakami Fubuki：</span><br>
All right, um, in any case, Commander... I hope all of us will be able to get along, both Hololive and Azur Lane.<br>
