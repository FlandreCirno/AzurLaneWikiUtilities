Whining... so many sisters, but none of them cared to wake me up!!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">{namecode:94}：</span><br>
Hmmm～～ As a bully girl, I should skip my classes without feeling ashamed, right? <br>
Ahh... That's a terrible idea, big sis will be angry again.<br>
B-but, without bully girls, there would be no taskmaster girls!<br>
Eh?<br>

Woaaa! She's coming this way!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">{namecode:93}：</span><br>

<span style="color:#4eb24e;">{namecode:94}&{namecode:2}：</span><br>
Whining — —<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">{namecode:93}：</span><br>

Whines... I just feel that everyone in class will subconsciously notice there...<br>
When it comes to "shoulder soreness", I always catch wandering eyes...especially from those troublemaker students...<br>
It's not as if I wanted it this big!<br>
<br>
……<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Honolulu：</span><br>
Confidence? This is my best trait?<br>
O-Only Commander will say something like this...<br>
