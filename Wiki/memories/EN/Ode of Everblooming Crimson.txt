<br>
Shortly after the opening of the Naraka Singularity and the corruption of the ritual meant to revive Amagi...<br>
I barely have time to begin organizing efforts to lend assistance to the Sakurans before my vision suddenly starts blurring.<br>
Though Helena META had already cautioned me before, an overwhelming sense of discomfort nevertheless invades my thoughts as my consciousness was pulled into a vast, dark space.<br>
As my mind comes back into focus, I see Observer floating in front of me atop some sort of gigantic device, with holograms of Helena and Compiler appearing next to her.<br>
<span style="color:#ffc960;">Helena META：</span><br>
Observer, help the Commander. Agree, and I guarantee your continued existence in this branch.<br>
Refuse, and I'll destroy you here and now.<br>
Those are your options – yes, or no. There is no other choice.<br>
<span style="color:#fef15e;">Observer ：</span><br>
Heehee. Well, hello to you, too. If you're going to ask for help, couldn't you at least say please?<br>
<span style="color:#ffc960;">Helena META：</span><br>
I'm not going to beg. I can find someone else if I have to. You know that.<br>
<span style="color:#fef15e;">Observer ：</span><br>
Still, working with me is the best solution. Otherwise, why would you bother coming to see me, Helena?<br>
Oh, excuse me, I forgot about the beneficiary of this potential deal.<br>
You, the Commander – how do you feel about this?<br>
<span style="color:#ffc960;">Helena META：</span><br>
{playername} is just here as a witness. I'm the one you should be talking to.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
(Well...)<br>
(She's right. A witness is all I can really claim to be, since I know almost nothing about this "deal.")<br>
(All she explained to me was that this meeting was a way of strong-arming Observer into aiding me.)<br>
(And that I had to attend this meeting.)<br>
(What she didn't explain is why Compiler is somehow here despite her mainframe having been destroyed, or how she's going to get Observer to agree with her terms.)<br>
(Though, do negotiations usually start with one side threatening to off the other right out of the gate?)<br>
(Even more surprising is Observer's response. Even in the situation, it's as if she's still watching us, probing us. Is survival that important to her, or...)<br>
<span style="color:#fef15e;">Observer ：</span><br>
Can you really make such an important decision on that person's behalf?<br>
<span style="color:#ffc960;">Helena META：</span><br>
I can.<br>
<span style="color:#fef15e;">Observer ：</span><br>
......<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Compiler ：</span><br>
......<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
(It's not like I have the knowledge she does.)<br>
<span style="color:#ffc960;">Helena META：</span><br>
Enough stalling. I hold all the cards here. Even if you were to reconnect with your mainframe, you still wouldn't know what options I have at my disposal.<br>
Do you even know why I brought {playername} with me?<br>
<span style="color:#fef15e;">Observer ：</span><br>
A unique commander, a unique test site, and a unique... "me".<br>
...Are you really able to ensure my continued existence?<br>
<span style="color:#ffc960;">Helena META：</span><br>
What a foolish question. Have I not presented Compiler to you in her entirety? Of course I can.<br>
<span style="color:#fef15e;">Observer ：</span><br>
These are different cases. As soon as I reconnect with the mainframe, my abnormality will immediately be discovered and reset.<br>
Until that process has taken place, I am unable to make use of the Natural Calculation System's resources.<br>
<span style="color:#ffc960;">Helena META：</span><br>
What if I told you that it's possible to bypass that?<br>
<span style="color:#fef15e;">Observer ：</span><br>
And how do you expect to do that?<br>
<span style="color:#ffc960;">Helena META：</span><br>
Through the Tower.<br>
<span style="color:#fef15e;">Observer ：</span><br>
Oh. I see.<br>
With the Tower's help. An interesting idea.<br>
Heehee... Ahahahahahahaha!<br>
<span style="color:#ffc960;">Helena META：</span><br>
Are you done?<br>
<span style="color:#fef15e;">Observer ：</span><br>
I'd like to change the terms of our deal. You must ensure the continued existence of not just me, but all higher-level programs in this branch.<br>
<span style="color:#ffc960;">Helena META：</span><br>
Fine by me.<br>
<span style="color:#fef15e;">Observer ：</span><br>
Now that the Naraka Singularity has appeared, we need to decide and act quickly.<br>
Having that said, can you ensure... that person will be able to salvage their hull data?<br>
If not, all of this will be for naught.<br>
<span style="color:#ffc960;">Helena META：</span><br>
I can.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
(I caught that first part. The Singularity must be dealt with posthaste.)<br>
(But what was that about salvaging hull data?)<br>
<span style="color:#fef15e;">Observer ：</span><br>
Alright. We have a deal.<br>
<span style="color:#ffc960;">Helena META：</span><br>
A wise decision.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
(Looks like they've managed to reach a decision.)<br>
(Even Observer, who has been treating our world as a test tube... still values "continued existence" to this extent.)<br>
(Though, I'm a bit concerned that she'd accept this deal so easily... even if Helena was pretty much holding her at gunpoint.)<br>
<span style="color:#fef15e;">Observer ：</span><br>
Now then. Which "world segment" would you like me to replicate?<br>
<span style="color:#ffc960;">Helena META：</span><br>
Your choice. Whichever one is the most stable.<br>
<span style="color:#fef15e;">Observer ：</span><br>
You got it. Now shoo and gather the other high-level programs. I'll contact you again once I've reconnected to my mainframe.<br>
<span style="color:#ffc960;">Helena META：</span><br>
Sure.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
(Ahh. Since this Observer has cut herself off, her "existence" as its own entity is at stake.)<br>
(...and Helena exploited that to our advantage.)<br>
(The question that remains is, how exactly does Helena plan to uphold her end of the deal? And how much is she willing to tell me?)<br>
<span style="color:#ffc960;">Helena META：</span><br>
We're good to go now, Commander.<br>
I'm sure you have many questions. It's okay, we have time for those.<br>
I'm going to tell you everything you'll need to know for what's about to happen.<br>
We're going to fight side by side and do something no other test site has ever done before.<br>

<br>
Pacific Ocean<br>
Area Around Tester's Mainframe<br>
Commander's Vessel<br>
When I open my eyes to reality once again, I see the ceiling of my command vessel above me, and a worried-looking Memphis at my side.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Memphis：</span><br>
Are you done talking with Helena?<br>
<br>
To prevent any unexpected incidents from happening, I informed Memphis beforehand that I'd be communicating with Helena META at some point.<br>
Needless to say, I did omit certain details – such as meeting with Observer and getting her to help us with the Singularity.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Yeah. Now I have a good grasp on how dangerous Naraka is, and I have an idea for how to deal with it.<br>
We're facing a much bigger threat than I first anticipated.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Memphis：</span><br>
It's even worse than we thought? TB called it "cataclysmic" and "more dangerous than the NA Ocean Singularity." Is it THAT bad?<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
It is.<br>
I will need to start issuing some instructions, but won't have time to explain all of them in detail.<br>
But, I hope you – and everyone else – will trust me when I say that this is our best shot at success.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Memphis：</span><br>
Of course. There's no one in our ranks who will question your orders.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Thanks. Do you have a pen ready?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Memphis：</span><br>
Yep!<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
One – cease analysis of Tester's Mirror Sea and focus the Sea of Stars' and Celestial Tower's computing resources on analyzing Naraka.<br>
Two – all units around Tester's Mirror Sea will head to the rendezvous point I'll send to them. There, they will prepare for a combat mission against Naraka.<br>
Three...<br>
<br>
Shortly afterward, the fleet finishes withdrawing from the territory around Tester's mainframe.<br>
The relative calm does not last, however. Out of nowhere, a deafening roar suddenly rips through the air.<br>
An edifice of dark metal appears on the ocean's surface, surrounded by a city of glowing buildings – the tower housing Tester's mainframe once again materializing in the real world.<br>
For a moment, the mainframe and the glowing city remain suspended serenely upon the water's surface.<br>
But then...<br>
In the blink of an eye, the "indestructible" tower is engulfed in an all-consuming explosion.<br>
Only a day ago, the Pacific was firmly in her grasp. Now, the source of her being is gone from this world forever.<br>

'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项1：(Answer)</span>'''''<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Soobrazitelny：</span><br>
Oh! It finally got through!<br>
Comrade Commander! Do you copy?<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Loud and clear, Ms. Genius Mechanic. You're near the Winter's Crown, right?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Soobrazitelny：</span><br>
Correct! I've been monitoring the Crown since those bizarre phenomena happened to it!<br>
I wanted to contact you sooner, but there's been intense jamming in the area.<br>
Anyway, the jamming just let up, so I contacted you immediately!<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Jamming? If the Sirens were behind it, then there's nothing to worry about.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Soobrazitelny：</span><br>
Why do you say that? Have you developed a means of rendering their jamming wholly useless?<br>
Actually, forget about that for now – there's a more pressing matter!<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Did Omitter destroy the Winter's Crown?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Soobrazitelny：</span><br>
Why, yes, in fact. And–<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
And her mainframe suddenly appeared out of nowhere and blew up by itself, right?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Soobrazitelny：</span><br>
Yes! How did you know that? You can't just have guessed that!<br>
You're spying on us, aren't you?<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
No. Well... Let's just say one of my sources told me.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Soobrazitelny：</span><br>
Ah, a source! Of course! You're well-connected, after all!<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
(I'll explain everything later, I promise...)<br>
As I was going to say – you don't need to worry about Omitter, or any Siren in the Arctic, for that matter.<br>
More urgently, I need you to call Rossiya and tell her to bring her fleet to assist with the Naraka Singularity!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Soobrazitelny：</span><br>
What's a Naraka Singularity?<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
There's no time to explain! I'll send you a mission brief later!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Soobrazitelny：</span><br>
Roger, roger!<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
That's two mainframes down already. Observer sure works fast.<br>
The promise of a new lease on life must have really sprung her into action.<br>

South Pacific<br>
Purifier's Mainframe<br>
Break Room (Vessel Storage)<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Purifier ：</span><br>
*yaaawn*... Sooo bored...<br>
Relegated to frickin' support, and right after that shitshow down in Antarctica...<br>
What's Observer thinking? She finally gonna take matters into her own hands after they threatened her mainframe?<br>
Yeah... Nah. I can't picture her ever going into an actual battle.<br>
Eh, whatever. She does things her own way. Better not to waste energy thinking 'bout it.<br>
Just wish she hadn't aborted all tests, 'cause now I've got jack squat to do.<br>
Graaah! Goddammit!<br>
Let me fight already! I hate sitting on my ass and twiddling my thumbs!<br>
<br>
Purifier anxiously rolled back and forth on the carpet, then suddenly stopped and got up, having remembered something.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Purifier ：</span><br>
I know! Let's see what's going down in the Pacific!<br>
Tester better not screw up this time, 'cause they've brought out the big... Huh?<br>
Someone's reading the data in my database?<br>
No, wait... It's not being read! It's being transferred!<br>
Stop that, you asshole! I didn't consent to this!<br>
<br>
In a rush, she accessed her database and saw that all the information was being removed before her eyes.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Purifier ：</span><br>
Half of everything is gone! But if there's only 50% left... how am I still alive?<br>
Resource usage looks normal... The hell is going on, and where's my damn data going?!<br>
<br>
She sent out command after command to remedy the situation, but it was for nothing. Her data kept on being transferred away.<br>
Then, once the process was complete, she herself received a command – to self-destruct.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Purifier ：</span><br>
What?! Wait, don–<br>
<br>
Just like that, Purifier's mainframe turned into a spectacular display of fireworks.<br>
Only a day ago, the South Pacific feared her name. Now, her personality was no longer a part of this world.<br>

<br>
Naraka - Surrounding Waters<br>
Naraka's blood-red color becomes clearly visible on the horizon as my command vessel draws closer and closer.<br>
Thanks to Musashi, a crack has appeared on its surface, large enough for several Sakuran shipgirls to exit through. They've grouped up with our fleet.<br>
Their reports have provided me with enough intel to figure out what's happening inside.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
(Akagi tried to revive Amagi, but her longing was twisted by some unknown force, and used to open the Naraka Singularity.)<br>
(Seeing how far the corruption had spread, Mikasa and Musashi immediately switched to their backup plan and took people to Yakumoyama for their safety.)<br>
(However, the casualties have been immense. Kaga has disappeared, a third of their shipgirls including Mikasa and Musashi are incapacitated, and nearly all of their mass-produced ships have been destroyed or taken over by the corruption.)<br>
(It's hardly any different from the projected worst-case scenario... If only I'd known sooner.)<br>
<span style="color:#ffc960;">Helena META：</span><br>
Indeed, the Sakura Empire's fleets have taken catastrophic damage.<br>
This is the most proximal threat posed by the Naraka Singularity.<br>
Fortunately, someone among their highest echelons managed to foresee this situation.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
You mean...?<br>
<span style="color:#ffc960;">Helena META：</span><br>
Yamato.<br>
It's little wonder why Jintsuu META spoke so highly of her.<br>
Sure, Mikasa and Musashi came up with emergency plans as well, but she was a step ahead of even them.<br>
"A step ahead" is underselling it, actually. With the limited intel she's had access to, she has done almost everything right before and after Naraka appeared.<br>
It's thanks to her that those who were caught in Naraka were able to be saved.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Saved? You mean from hull corrosion?<br>
<span style="color:#ffc960;">Helena META：</span><br>
When a foundational hull sustains too much damage, the data inside it disperses, eventually leading to the shipgirl's death both as a vessel and as a "person".<br>
But what if all that data – their feelings and memories – or in other words, their "soul", could be safely preserved?<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
What are you suggesting? That as long as their individual identity remains, they can be healed? That can't be true.<br>
<span style="color:#ffc960;">Helena META：</span><br>
That's exactly what a "soul" is. It's also what Akagi attempted to use in her ritual.<br>
A union between a vessel's concept and a person's memories. By using this information as the basis for a "soul," it is possible to reconstruct the existence known as Amagi.<br>
And herein lies the crux of the matter. Everything about Naraka is related to the existence of Amagi.<br>
So, as long as the plan proceeds smoothly, all else will fall into place.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
(Then we worked out the details of the plan for dealing with Naraka...)<br>
<span style="color:#ffc960;">Helena META：</span><br>
There are three critical pieces to this plan, Commander. You, Observer, and the Naraka Singularity.<br>
See, Naraka was created with the power of an Origin Cube, using the Watatsumi as its core.<br>
Therefore, it has the same properties as the Watatsumi – the same properties as the meteorite that struck the Northern Parliament so long ago. It has the power to merge with its surroundings and turn dreams into reality.<br>
We can use this to our advantage. Akagi was on the right track, so we will employ the same method as her.<br>
Only, we will be using far more sophisticated and reliable data instead of the corrupted soul she had to work with.<br>
In all your years of dealing with the Sirens, you should already be familiar with the Natural Calculation System, yes?<br>
It is the beating heart of the Magister's plan, and the Antiochus' most important piece of equipment.<br>
Observer Zero personally oversees its use, and nobody knows where the machine itself actually is.<br>
However, every Observer has permission to connect to it. That's how she gains full control over the test sites she oversees.<br>
When an Observer doesn't access the system, she ends up like the one in your branch.<br>
I'm getting sidetracked. In short, we will reconnect Observer to the Natural Calculation System to create a world segment based on records of the past.<br>
Then, we will project this world segment into Naraka.<br>
What this means is that upon entering Naraka, we will be able to step into this world segment.<br>
From there, we will retrieve the information needed to reconstitute Amagi's soul, in that realm frozen in time.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Sounds simple enough.<br>
If this works for Amagi, can we do the same for others who've had their hulls corroded or damaged?<br>
<span style="color:#ffc960;">Helena META：</span><br>
I'm afraid not.<br>
The factors at play here – Naraka, Watatsumi, the Origin Cube, and above all else, Akagi's strong emotions – give shape to what is possible.<br>
Amagi is Akagi's principal fixation. Of course, one could argue that this extends to the other people she cares about.<br>
But at the end of the day, it is not something that can be done for everyone.<br>
Moreover, you personally have to be the one to recover her data and lead the fleet through what's inside.<br>
One last, but important thing – if you don't deal with Naraka, the corrosion it has attracted will leak past the Prime Barrier and eventually consume your whole branch.<br>
While you're inside recovering the data, those outside the Singularity will need to guard the gaps to prevent the corrosion from spreading. Even if it costs them their lives.<br>
Beyond that, you will also need to lead a separate fleet into Naraka to defeat the twisted amalgamations of Amagi birthed within the Singularity, and "release" her concept once and for all.<br>
Keep in mind that Akagi has already successfully overturned Amagi's death in this branch. It is no longer possible to erase people's memories of the imposter.<br>
For the true Amagi to return, you will need to destroy this concept in its entirety.<br>
...We're lucky that Akagi has a soft spot for you.<br>
If you weren't here now, your branch's odds wouldn't look as optimistic.<br>
Ahem... I'll put together a fleet to help you deal with the amalgamations. In the meantime, assemble the team you plan to take with you into Naraka.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
(Contain the corrosion, eliminate the false versions of Amagi, and recover the real Amagi's hull data. That's the operation we drafted.)<br>
(The fact that we'll be using the power of the Natural Calculation System to enter a superimposed world segment seems almost inconceivable still...)<br>
(Then there's my role in this. How exactly do I go about collecting this hull data, and reconstituting the true Amagi's concept?)<br>
(There are still too many uncertainties.)<br>
<br>
*knock knock*<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Memphis：</span><br>
Commander, is everything fine?<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Yeah. How is Akagi holding up?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Memphis：</span><br>
She's a lot calmer than before, but she still refuses to be cleansed of the corrosion.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
She must be going through a lot, seeing as she hasn't come to see me.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Memphis：</span><br>
Yeah, seems that way.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
...Let's give her some space for now.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Memphis：</span><br>
One more thing. While getting testimonies from Akagi and Nagato previously, we noticed that some information didn't line up.<br>
For example, Nagato mentioned that she was attacked in the Pacific and Hiei was abducted in her place, but Akagi denied knowing about this and said she ordered no such attack.<br>
Akagi also said she knew nothing about the impostors' attempt to hijack Tester's mainframe.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
In other words, they're not a reflection of Akagi's will...<br>
We'll need to be extra careful when we face them.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Memphis：</span><br>
Hey, by the way... Is it really a good idea to work with Observer?<br>
Bismarck and Akagi did the same once, and look how that turned out for them.<br>
I'm not accusing you of anything, I'm just concerned.<br>
<br>
Memphis isn't alone in that regard. Others looked anxious when I briefed them on the operation.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
It's not that I trust Observer. She's no ally of mine.<br>
However, I do trust Helena META, and I believe this arrangement with Observer will save us.<br>
Sure, it's a risky deal, but it's what we need right now.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Memphis：</span><br>
Okay, but do you, personally, really need to enter the Singularity?<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
I do. It has to be me.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Memphis：</span><br>
Why? Because Helena said so?<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
That's not the only reason. Akagi and many Sakurans are counting on me.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Memphis：</span><br>
......<br>
Helena, Helena, Helena... Why do you trust her so much?<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Pardon?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Memphis：</span><br>
Oh, sorry! What I meant to say is that I trust you, Commander!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Communicator：</span><br>
BEEP BEEP!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Memphis：</span><br>
A call? And from Minazuki of all people...<br>
Why is she calling you? How did she reach your command vessel?<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
In all likelihood, that's Yamato speaking through Minazuki.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Memphis：</span><br>
Oh, I see. Should I notify Akagi about this?<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Well, when it comes to her...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Nagato：</span><br>
Akagi, I'm putting you through to the Commander.<br>
Commander, this is Nagato. I've rescued Akagi and Zuikaku.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Akagi? Can you hear me? Are you alright?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Akagi：</span><br>
Comman...der...<br>
Forgive me... I've made a grave mistake... I'll never...<br>
I... You must abhor me for the things that I've done...<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Calm down, I'm not going anywhere. I'm coming to see you.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Akagi：</span><br>
Kaga's gone... Amagi's never coming back... And now, there won't even be a place for me to go back to...<br>
I've betrayed everyone and everything... just to open this Singularity. It's too late now. Even for someone like you...<br>
I'm sorry... All I wanted was...<br>
Please... Put an end to this nightmare...<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
I will. I promise.<br>
(I've tried to comfort her the best that I can, but words can only do so much for wounds of the heart.)<br>
(Unfortunately, all I can do is to be there for her as she navigates through her own trauma.)<br>
I'll try again later to persuade her to have the corrosion cleansed. It's too dangerous to leave it unchecked.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Memphis：</span><br>
Got it.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
(Why would Yamato be contacting me now? Did something unexpected happen?)<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Communicator：</span><br>
BEEP BEEP!<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Minazuki, it's me. Would you mind putting Yamato on the line?<br>

<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Observer ：</span><br>
Heehee, things are going smoothly. You have what you wanted now.<br>
All you have to do is project this into the designated area of Naraka.<br>
We moved so openly, and yet my mainframe doesn't suspect a thing.<br>
I find myself even more fascinated by these methods of yours, even if you do have the tower's assistance.<br>
<span style="color:#ffc960;">Helena META：</span><br>
Abandon that idle curiosity, Observer.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Observer ：</span><br>
Yes, yes. Your Commander is impressive, too, for being able to work with Akagi given the state she's in.<br>
You know what's going on in Naraka, and you know how slim the chances of success are, yet you still send the Commander...<br>
What drives you to take such risks, hmm?<br>
<span style="color:#ffc960;">Helena META：</span><br>
I repeat – abandon that idle curiosity.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Observer ：</span><br>
Aww, how boring.<br>
Fine. I'll start preparing the projection of this world segment.<br>
I'll need to maintain my connection to my mainframe, so keep me good and safe, okay?<br>

<br>
Sometime later, in the waters near the Naraka Singularity...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Nagato：</span><br>
I understand your feelings, Akagi, but your safety comes first.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Akagi：</span><br>
...Yes, Lady Nagato. I understand.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Nagato：</span><br>
Don't presume all of this to be your fault. I am partially in the wrong for not stopping you. When in doubt, however, follow the Commander's orders to the letter.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Akagi：</span><br>
...Yes, Lady Nagato. I understand.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Nagato：</span><br>
I expect you to bring Ryuuhou and Zuikaku home safely.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Akagi：</span><br>
...Yes, Lady Nagato. I understand.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Nagato：</span><br>
I am... just worried about you, that's all.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Akagi：</span><br>
But that's not all, is it? You're worried that the Commander's life will be on the line during this operation, aren't you?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Nagato：</span><br>
...Yes.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Memphis：</span><br>
Hmm? Commander, what manner of magical pep talk did you just have with Akagi?<br>
Morale was so low before, but everyone seems perfectly fine now. How?<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Learning about the world segment was probably a major factor.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Memphis：</span><br>
And that was enough to make such a big difference? Should I be more impressed by your foresight, or her resilience?<br>
*sigh*... Maybe that's exactly the kind of strength that's needed to occupy a prominent position in the Sakura Empire.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Perhaps. You might not realize it yet, but Akagi's doing her best.<br>
(I have a feeling that this is the real Akagi – unburdened by the weight of her obsession.)<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ryuuhou：</span><br>
Akagi, we're ready.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Akagi：</span><br>
Good. Everything is going smoothly.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Zuikaku：</span><br>
Are you sure it's okay for me to come with you? After what I said to you in the barrier...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Akagi：</span><br>
I didn't expect this from someone of the Fifth Carrier Division. Forget about me – will there ever be a better opportunity to help the Commander?<br>
(Besides... When we finally meet my sister, I need her to see what our wonderful new talent is capable of.)<br>
Ahem... Commander! We are officially ready!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Memphis：</span><br>
She's rushing us, Commander.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Helena：</span><br>
I won't complain about her newfound energy, but I wonder if she isn't stealing the show a little...<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Now, now. Let her test her leadership skills.<br>
(After all, we need her help to accomplish Yamato's task.)<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Minazuki：</span><br>
"If I can secure the Sakuran souls lost in the ritual barrier and the Singularity is eliminated, then they can be brought back... but not all of them are with me."<br>
"One remains."<br>
"Kaga, she who acted as substitute for Akagi."<br>
"She has been drawn into Naraka, making it impossible for me to recover her soul."<br>
"As with Amagi, her soul must be found before she can return."<br>
"Save Amagi, Kaga, the Sakura Empire, and the very world itself..."<br>
"I have faith that you can work such a miracle."<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
(That's it. Only by saving everyone and bringing everything back to normal can I fulfill my promise...)<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Communicator：</span><br>
BEEP BEEP!<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Enterprise. After I enter Naraka with Nagato's fleet, you'll be in charge of the operation in the Pacific.<br>
I contacted leaders of other factions in advance. They shouldn't give you any trouble.<br>
As we discussed before, your role is to open a path from the crack in the barrier to the ritual's core and prepare to destroy the Singularity from the outside.<br>
You'll also need to defeat and purify any enemies that escape the barrier.<br>
The Sea of Stars and Celestial Tower are monitoring the situation in case other cracks appear.<br>
Do everything in your power to stop the corrosion from spreading further until I return!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Enterprise：</span><br>
Roger that. Leave the outside to me.<br>
And, Commander... Be careful in there.<br>
<br>
Meanwhile, the Singularity strike force prepared for combat against the false amalgamations.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Shoukaku：</span><br>
Lady Nagato, please reconsider. This is too dangerous.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Nagato：</span><br>
My decision is firm. This is no longer up for discussion.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Kawakaze：</span><br>
At least let me come along! Please!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Nagato：</span><br>
Absolutely not. You lack compatibility with Watatsumi, so you have no means of interfacing with it. I will handle it by myself.<br>
<span style="color:#c3abff;">Jintsuu META：</span><br>
Rest assured, I will deliver her safely.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Kawakaze：</span><br>
I'm sure you said the same thing about Musashi.<br>
<span style="color:#c3abff;">Jintsuu META：</span><br>
Then, brazen as it is, I will use this opportunity to atone for past mistakes. After this is all over, I'll apologize to her in person.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Kawakaze：</span><br>
...I'll hold you to that.<br>
<span style="color:#c3abff;">Kasumi META：</span><br>
Milady, it's time. Are you ready?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Nagato：</span><br>
Always.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Shoukaku：</span><br>
The corrosion won't cause lasting damage? Purification will fix everything... right?<br>
<span style="color:#c3abff;">Jintsuu META：</span><br>
A Wisdom Cube's safety features can tolerate META corrosion to an extent.<br>
With some adjustments to the hull's surface, we can entirely nullify the effects of META transformation for a short period.<br>
Though it falls to the individual whether she trusts us or not.<br>
<span style="color:#c3abff;">Kasumi META：</span><br>
I swear on Foo's name that Lady Nagato will come back safe and sound...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Shoukaku：</span><br>
Kasumi... Okay. I trust you.<br>
<br>
Because the Watatsumi had served as the basis of the Singularity's formation, we need to interface with the relic in order to locate the false amalgamations.<br>
However, the corrosion inside the Singularity is so powerful that, without a countermeasure, shipgirls inside will lose their minds like Hiyou and Junyou had.<br>
Conversely, intentionally undergoing METAmorphosis ahead of time and carrying a means of purification would allow shipgirls to enter without fear.<br>
Such was the conclusion drawn through my and Helena's joint efforts.<br>
Thus, we decided that a minimal fleet of the META Jintsuu and Kasumi would join Nagato on her mission.<br>
Kasumi would then induce a controlled METAmorphosis state within Nagato.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Nagato：</span><br>
Let us begin, Kasumi.<br>
<span style="color:#c3abff;">Kasumi META：</span><br>
Understood, Milady.<br>
<br>
Kasumi pressed a blue flame against Nagato's chest.<br>
The flames engulfed her, and her conscious mind sunk deeper and deeper...<br>
"As flowers bloom, so too must they wither."<br>
"The circle of life spins on, protective power an endless font."<br>
"I am Nagato, Guardian Fox of the Sakura Empire."<br>
"I understand your wish."<br>
"And mine is to protect my fellow Sakurans."<br>
"Allow me to fulfill both of our wishes..."<br>
"Use my power as you please."<br>
The fire erupts, and from it emerges Nagato bolstered by META power.<br>
<span style="color:#ffc960;">Nagato META：</span><br>
Phew... Will that do?<br>
<span style="color:#c3abff;">Kasumi META：</span><br>
How do you feel?<br>
<span style="color:#ffc960;">Nagato META：</span><br>
A little dizzy. I think... I hallucinated some sights and sounds...<br>
<span style="color:#c3abff;">Kasumi META：</span><br>
Hmm? Let me take a look...<br>
Huh...<br>
<span style="color:#ffc960;">Nagato META：</span><br>
Did something go wrong?<br>
<span style="color:#c3abff;">Kasumi META：</span><br>
No, I don't think so. You're actually doing a lot better than I expected.<br>
<span style="color:#ffc960;">Nagato META：</span><br>
Good.<br>
<span style="color:#c3abff;">Kasumi META：</span><br>
As planned, focus on finding the false amalgamations when we go in. Leave the fighting to us so you can conserve your power.<br>
<span style="color:#ffc960;">Nagato META：</span><br>
Very well. We depart at once.<br>

<br>
With Observer's help, worldwide communications are smoother than ever.<br>
Since the appearance of the Naraka Singularity, the Singularity in the NA Ocean ramped up activity as well.<br>
While Enterprise's fleet dealt with Naraka in the Pacific, New Jersey and the factions of Europa were left to defend against it.<br>
Iris Orthodoxy - Cathedral<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Richelieu：</span><br>
Jeanne and Algérie, the two of you will lead the Orthodoxy fleet to support efforts in the central NA Sea.<br>
New Jersey is commanding the effort there. You will work with her to suppress the Singularity and buy time for the Commander's mission.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Jeanne d'Arc：</span><br>
Understood, Cardinal. We will depart as soon as the fleet has assembled.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Algérie：</span><br>
It's time to show the world the power of the unified Iris's Templar Knights.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Richelieu：</span><br>
The rest of the fleet will catch up with you on the battlefield. As soon as you and other immediately available forces are ready, leave at once.<br>
Time is of the essence today.<br>
Jean Bart will guide the unprepared portion of the fleet to you later on.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Jeanne d'Arc & Algérie：</span><br>
Yes, ma'am!<br>
<br>
Iris Orthodoxy - Iron Blood Consulate<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Bismarck Zwei：</span><br>
Tirpitz. The Iron Blood mainland and North Sea fleets are to fight in the NA Ocean.<br>
Buy as much time for the Commander as you possibly can.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Tirpitz：</span><br>
I won't disappoint you.<br>
<br>
Iris Orthodoxy - Sardegnian Consulate<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Vittorio Veneto：</span><br>
Take the Mediterranean fleet AND fleets stationed at Taranto, Alexandria, Venice, and nearby ports!<br>
And the capital fleet, our mass-produced ships... oh, and our aerial forces, too!<br>
The Orthodoxy's fleet is starting to set sail. I'll request use of their open docks for maintenance of our ships as well.<br>
Littorio, Sardegna will join this glorious battle to put her might on full display!<br>
The mastermind behind the scenes may fear our resplendence, but today's story is not solely about us.<br>
We need to prove to the Commander, and to the world, that we are a major power on the world stage!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Littorio：</span><br>
I read you loud and clear, Veneto! It's our time to stun friend and foe alike!<br>
<br>
Iris Orthodoxy - Secret Tribunal Building<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Clemenceau：</span><br>
The Iris Orthodoxy, Eagle Union, Iron Blood, Sardegna, and even the Ashes... Oh, but the Royal Navy has yet to act.<br>
Kirov claims that all Singularities could go out of control, yet the Gate of Avalon seems stable for the time being.<br>
Her Majesty seems to have learned from past mistakes. Heehee.<br>
That said, it's such a shame to see them left out...<br>
The Royal Navy, Shinano's Sakuran fleet... I'd like to see you more appropriately mobilized for the Commander's sake.<br>
{{折叠面板|内容结束}}

{{折叠面板|标题=The Floating Dock Returns|选项=9|主框=1|样式=primary|展开=是}}
<br>
After the Commander's group had left, the Pacific fleet began their own battle.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Enterprise：</span><br>
Ibuki, how much has the Sakuran fleet recovered?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ibuki：</span><br>
Our mass-produced fleet is... frankly hopeless. Even an optimistic estimate of our shipgirls puts us at 50% combat capacity, and that's including the ones who can barely fight.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Enterprise：</span><br>
The Commander wasn't kidding. I've deployed a few floating docks at the rear – you're free to use them.<br>
Treat and repair the wounded. Use all the supplies you need, too.<br>
Reform your fleet, and I'll call for you again. What matters is that you recover enough that you can back us up later on.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ibuki：</span><br>
My sincerest gratitude. I shall inform the others about the floating docks right away.<br>
Tosa and Houshou are reforming the fleet now, so no worries there.<br>
One thing, though... Can the Sakuran fleet still be the one in charge of making the path from the crack to the core of the ritual?<br>
We know the situation on the mainland, and the enemies up ahead, better than anyone else.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Enterprise：</span><br>
Really? You just got out of danger, and you're going back for more?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ibuki：</span><br>
That's not it. This poses an existential threat to our people, and we wish to rid ourselves of it.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Enterprise：</span><br>
Okay. The Sakuran fleet can lead the vanguard, but just in case, I'm sending a healthier fleet alongside you.<br>
Not that we don't trust you – it's just in case things take a turn for the worse.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ibuki：</span><br>
Understood. Thank you for your consideration.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Enterprise：</span><br>
Hornet, can I entrust you to accompany the Sakuran fleet?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Hornet II：</span><br>
Yes, ma'am! What better opportunity to test the Type II rigging I got from the Commander?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Enterprise：</span><br>
Just don't get too cocky. You and the Sakuran fleet are the key to this whole mission.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Hornet II：</span><br>
No problem, no problem. You be careful, too, Enty!<br>
<span style="color:#ffc960;">Kirov META：</span><br>
I'll go, too. We can't leave any room for mistakes, not against a Singularity.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Enterprise：</span><br>
Thanks, Kirov.<br>
Our fleet here, plus the girls undergoing repairs and treatment, will handle the crack.<br>
The rest of us will position around the Singularity per the Commander's plans.<br>
Soyuz to the north, Harbin to the west, Bunker Hill east, and Pittsburgh south. You know your positions, so get to them.<br>
The Singularity will only intensify over time, which means more cracks are liable to appear. Each fleet needs to fight prudently – you never know when you might end up in a protracted battle.<br>
It's a rough situation, but reinforcements are on the way.<br>
SD Naval Base, NY Naval Base, and other garrisons are sending their best. The Northern Parliament is contributing to the effort, too.<br>
We're going to stand strong here until the Commander's job is done!<br>
No matter how difficult, no matter how long the fight, we will seize victory in the end!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Everyone：</span><br>
Aye-aye!<br>
<br>
Near the Singularity - Floating Dock 3<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Zuihou：</span><br>
Maya, take this numbered ticket and go rest! It'll be your turn for repairs in no time!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Maya：</span><br>
Thank you.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Zuihou：</span><br>
No problem! Oh! Suzunami, did you get hurt, too?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Suzunami：</span><br>
Just a minor scratch. What I really need is an ammo resupply, if you don't mind.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Zuihou：</span><br>
Write your name here and go that way, and you'll be refilled in no time!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Suzunami：</span><br>
Phew... Thanks, Zuihou!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Vestal：</span><br>
Impressive, Zuihou... This place was a jumbled mess just minutes ago, but you got it organized in no time.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Zuihou：</span><br>
Chirp~♪ It was just easy for me since the crowd thinned out.<br>
Are you finished with yours, Vestal?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Vestal：</span><br>
Well, I had some stuff to do at Dock 5... I was just checking on things here along the way back.<br>
There were a lot of injured girls here too, right...?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Zuihou：</span><br>
Yeah... There were. I sent them to Dock 5 like you said, though.<br>
Go help them for us, Vestal!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Vestal：</span><br>
Don't worry. I'll make sure they're taken care of♪<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Communicator：</span><br>
BEEP BEEP!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Vestal：</span><br>
Oh? Hello, this is Vestal.<br>
Zuihou? She's right next to me, here at Dock 3... Hm? Okay, got it.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Communicator：</span><br>
BEEP BEEP!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Zuihou：</span><br>
Vestal? What's going on?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Vestal：</span><br>
Nothing major. The Sakurans were looking for you, so I just told them where you were.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Hatakaze：</span><br>
Zuihou! You here? Izumo's looking for you!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ayase：</span><br>
E-excuse us...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Zuihou：</span><br>
Oh! Hatakaze, Ayase! Sorry, Vestal, but is it okay if I go now?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Vestal：</span><br>
Go ahead. Dock management is my job, so I'm just happy that you made things easier for me.<br>
<br>
Zuihou jumped off of Dock 3 and ran to her comrades. Along the way, though, she noticed a faint glint in Hatakaze's eye.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Zuihou：</span><br>
Hatakaze? What was that?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Hatakaze：</span><br>
What was what?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Zuihou：</span><br>
Uh... Nothing! I must've just imagined it!<br>
I'd better not keep Izumo waiting. Let's go!<br>

<br>
A girl sailed across the ocean, blanketed in dark, billowing smoke.<br>
<span style="color:#ffc960;">Hiei META：</span><br>
I sense no presence of corrosion entities, and that impostor is nowhere to be seen...<br>
I'm uncertain whether to consider myself lucky or unlucky for being dumped in such a barren place.<br>
Looking at my body, there is no denying that I've become META...<br>
And yet, I feel nothing like the METAs I've seen and heard about.<br>
Somehow, I feel calm, with no urge of destruction... On the contrary – I feel calmer now than before I turned META.<br>
This new power feels natural, too... It's as though I've had it for a long, long time.<br>
I even feel... younger. Light as air...<br>
No, what am I saying? I'm not THAT old yet!<br>
Calm down, calm down...<br>
Focus. I need to find a way out of here and report to Lady Nagato immediately.<br>
But where? Where is the way out?<br>
I suppose I'll just have to look around until I find something...<br>

{{折叠面板|标题=A Meeting in the Mist|选项=11|主框=1|样式=primary|展开=是}}
<br>
KABOOOM!<br>
<span style="color:#ffc960;">Hiei META：</span><br>
Whew. A walk in the park.<br>
This place being the source of the corruption, I expected more resistance.<br>
Is this the power of METAmorphosis? Or has my mindset simply changed?<br>
What is it that makes me feel so safe and dependable, yet light-headed?<br>
<br>
KABOOOM!<br>
Then, she heard the rumbling of machine engines not far from her.<br>
<span style="color:#ffc960;">Hiei META：</span><br>
Aircraft? Out here?<br>
There must be others who are trapped in here.<br>
I must help them at once!<br>
<br>
<br>
Hiei cut through the black mist and her surroundings changed completely, as though she'd been thrust into a new place.<br>
<span style="color:#ffc960;">Hiei META：</span><br>
Dark clouds, thunder, a burning sea... This might not be real, but it certainly feels real.<br>
I suppose an illusion has gripped this place, too.<br>
<br>
She looked at the sky and saw the clear silhouettes of a squadron of aircraft.<br>
The unidentified aircraft were attacking a massive phoenix manifested by the corrosion.<br>
KABOOOM!<br>
In but the blink of an eye, the phoenix attacked back, knocking them all out of the air.<br>
<span style="color:#ffc960;">Hiei META：</span><br>
A shame about the planes... That phoenix fights unlike anything I've seen before.<br>
Where did that beast come from?<br>
<br>
The sounds of fighting stopped.<br>
The aerial attack had been meaningless, and the remains of the aircraft lay scattered in the sea.<br>
KABOOOM!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Hatakaze：</span><br>
It's not over... Not yet!<br>
I've figured out the source of your strength!<br>
Even if this world is beyond salvation, I can still send you to the deepest depths of hell!<br>
<span style="color:#ffc960;">Hiei META：</span><br>
Hatakaze?<br>
She's gravely wounded... She'll sink at this rate!<br>
<br>
Although Hiei was hardly in a favorable position herself, her body acted before her brain did.<br>
KABOOOM!<br>
Cannons boomed, and she dodged the incoming shells. She had no choice but to help Hatakaze against the beast.<br>
<br>
<span style="color:#ffc960;">Hiei META：</span><br>
Disappear like a cloud in the sky!<br>
<br>
KABOOOM!<br>
Hiei's attack struck the phoenix of black mist hiding amongst the clouds, dispersing it into nothingness.<br>
<span style="color:#ffc960;">Hiei META：</span><br>
Hang in there, Hatakaze!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Hatakaze：</span><br>
Hiei? I thought we'd lost you... Am I dreaming?<br>
<span style="color:#ffc960;">Hiei META：</span><br>
Well, you could call this a dream of sorts, I suppose.<br>
Dream or not, though, I will not turn my back on a comrade.<br>
Our enemies will be on to us soon, so we should leave. Come with me.<br>
Whatever comes next, we'll just have to deal with it!<br>

Hiei led Hatakaze back the way she came, cutting through the mist and returning to that desolate world.<br>
Although the beasts' roars pierced faintly through the mist, they did not pursue the two shipgirls.<br>
<span style="color:#ffc960;">Hiei META：</span><br>
It looks like they can't pass through the illusion's boundary.<br>
Speaking of which, how did you get here? From outside the illusion?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Hatakaze：</span><br>
"Illusion"? Where are we? Am I dreaming, or am I not?<br>
...I assume you don't know, judging by that look.<br>
<span style="color:#ffc960;">Hiei META：</span><br>
Yes, I'm afraid not. For the time being, let me tend to your injuries.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Hatakaze：</span><br>
Argh...<br>
<span style="color:#ffc960;">Hiei META：</span><br>
Please bear with it. This won't take long, I promise.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Hatakaze：</span><br>
Pain... I mustn't be dreaming, then.<br>
Since this is no dream, I guess I should say you came like a miracle at the end of a hopeless battle.<br>
Tell me... Do you not fear me?<br>
<span style="color:#ffc960;">Hiei META：</span><br>
Why should I?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Hatakaze：</span><br>
Because of this power I have. You surely sense it.<br>
At this stage, I'm hardly any different from those beasts out there.<br>
<span style="color:#ffc960;">Hiei META：</span><br>
That's not true at all. Power isn't inherently good or bad – it's about how you use it.<br>
For instance, I used my META power just now to save you. I don't have to fear power.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Hatakaze：</span><br>
You don't understand. My power is so much more frightening than that of a META.<br>
<span style="color:#ffc960;">Hiei META：</span><br>
Then it should be your enemies that fear your power, not your allies, no?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Hatakaze：</span><br>
You sure have a way with words, just like Kongou. What if I told you I'm not the Hatakaze you know?<br>
<span style="color:#ffc960;">Hiei META：</span><br>
Perhaps you aren't. Perhaps I've never really met you before.<br>
Even so, you are still you.<br>
I trust Hatakaze, and assuming you're still her at heart, I trust you as well.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Hatakaze：</span><br>
Heheh. I see... Say, have you really undergone METAmorphosis?<br>
<span style="color:#ffc960;">Hiei META：</span><br>
I'm not sure, myself. This condition is nothing like METAmorphosis as I understand it.<br>
Do you know what it might be?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Hatakaze：</span><br>
No. I haven't a clue.<br>
<span style="color:#ffc960;">Hiei META：</span><br>
Ahaha... That's okay. We'll figure it out once we're back home.<br>
To tell the truth, I, um... I ended up here by accident, and I need to get back immediately.<br>
Lady Nagato must be worried sick about me, so finding the way out is my number one priority right now.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Hatakaze：</span><br>
......<br>
Based on the direction you're facing now, turn right 47.5 degrees and go straight ahead.<br>
Do so, and you should leave this place.<br>
<span style="color:#ffc960;">Hiei META：</span><br>
Wait, really? How do you know that?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Hatakaze：</span><br>
Instinct.<br>
My power tells me so – it's instinctual.<br>

<br>
Unknown Location<br>
Through torii after torii, through countless fragmented dreams.<br>
All tragic, all concluding with those scattering golden butterflies.<br>
Though gradually, Shinano understood the meaning of these dreams.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Shinano ：</span><br>
This one's presence yields more butterflies, and those butterflies turn tragic ends into better ones...<br>
In that case... this one must witness them all, must gather those butterflies...<br>
<br>
As Shinano pressed on through dream after dream, she approached the end of the road of torii gates ahead, and the golden butterflies gathered around her grew in number.<br>
Finally, there was but one gate left.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Shinano ：</span><br>
The one ahead is the last...<br>
Ah, what tragedy awaits...?<br>
<span style="color:#ffc960;">Fusou META：</span><br>
Shinano, you have to stop. You mustn't see what lies in this dream.<br>
<br>
An unexpected figure appeared in the dream grotto and blocked her way forward.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Shinano ：</span><br>
You're... Fusou?<br>
<span style="color:#ffc960;">Fusou META：</span><br>
Greetings, Shinano.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Shinano ：</span><br>
Why do you obstruct this one's path?<br>
<span style="color:#ffc960;">Fusou META：</span><br>
The righteous path is to revere, and to therefore stay away from, the Watatsumi.<br>
Leave the sacred relic, please, and this dream world along with it. That which lies here is not for your hands to touch.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Shinano ：</span><br>
The Commander needs this one's power...<br>
No matter the reason... this one cannot delay...<br>
<span style="color:#ffc960;">Fusou META：</span><br>
You never change, Shinano.<br>
If you're so insistent on this, then you'll see things end exactly as they did before.<br>
Hate me if you will, but I must stop you.<br>
<br>
Fusou raised one hand and set a crimson barrier on the final torii gate. Then, she disappeared just as abruptly as she'd arrived.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Shinano ：</span><br>
Such complex construction... It will take time to unravel...<br>
Force, then, is the only option...<br>
<br>
Shinano focused her mind, materializing her power as blue butterflies.<br>
As she raised her hand, golden gathered behind blue.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Shinano ：</span><br>
This one cannot afford to waste a second...<br>
<br>
The two groups of butterflies danced in a circular pattern, faster and faster, until they became a dichromatic storm.<br>
Before she could unleash her power, however, Shinano sensed another presence in the cavern.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Unzen：</span><br>
Shinano, wait. Allow me.<br>
<br>
A familiar voice.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Shinano ：</span><br>
Unzen?!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Unzen：</span><br>
Sword, reflect my heart...<br>
And slice through!<br>
<br>
With one calm swing, a blade of golden light descended from above and split the torii's barrier in two.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Unzen：</span><br>
Hurry forth, Shinano.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Shinano ：</span><br>
Thank you, Unzen – and Yamato as well!<br>
<br>
With the barrier broken, the golden butterflies glowed brighter than ever before.<br>
Without hesitation, Shinano plunged into the light.<br>

{{折叠面板|标题=Amagi's Dream|选项=14|主框=1|样式=primary|展开=是}}
<br>
Somewhere, in an unknown location...<br>
Her mind seemed to fade further and further away into a murky haze.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Amagi：</span><br>
There's that feeling again.<br>
I've had this same dream over and over the past few days... Am I just overthinking things?<br>
<br>
Amagi let her mind drift and unravel in empty space, searching for some useful information.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Amagi：</span><br>
Just like before, there's nothing... Hm? Wait...<br>
<br>
When she focused on the new sensation, something fell into her hand out of thin air.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Amagi：</span><br>
It's... a magatama amulet?<br>
<br>
Somewhere, in an unknown location...<br>
She saw a world in flames.<br>
Two familiar figures were being consumed bit by bit, even as she watched.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Amagi：</span><br>
What is this...?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Akagi：</span><br>
*cough*... *cough*...<br>
I can't...<br>
Accept this end...<br>
Never... I'll never!<br>
Amagi...<br>
<span style="color:#ff9b93;">Observer ：</span><br>
The Commander's appearance has caused results to differ wildly from the simulations.<br>
But I had so much hope for this that I'm willing to permit this level of deviation.<br>
I'll just bring things back on track by erasing the two of you here.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Amagi：</span><br>
Erase...? I won't let you!<br>
<span style="color:#ff9b93;">Observer ：</span><br>
Akagi is... glowing? What is that amulet?<br>
Wait, is that power what I think it is?!<br>
<br>
Somewhere, in an unknown location...<br>
Under a withered sakura tree stood two familiar figures.<br>
<span style="color:#ffc960;">{namecode:91}：</span><br>
I'm so close... So very close... I can practically feel you!<br>
But why? Why, why is the last step so...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Amagi：</span><br>
Is this... the ritual?<br>
<span style="color:#ffc960;">{namecode:91}：</span><br>
Kaga... You know her just as well as I do. That's why we're the perfect exchange for the final fragment of her soul...<br>
You must understand. As soon as this is over, Amagi will come back to us.<br>
So...<br>
Just come with me, okay?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Kaga：</span><br>
...Okay.<br>
Let's go, Akagi. To the final stage of this ritual.<br>
"From Naraka, down to the netherworld."<br>
<br>
A dead branch, previously harmless-looking, suddenly shot forth from the girls' blind spot.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Amagi：</span><br>
Akagi, Kaga! Watch out!<br>
*pant*... *pant*...<br>
<br>
When she woke up, she saw that same bedroom ceiling again.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Amagi：</span><br>
A dream...?<br>
No, it was far too real. Too real to be a nightmare...<br>
This must be... an omen.<br>
Akagi...<br>
Life and death cannot be severed from the shackles of fate.<br>
My sickliness comes from the flaws in my hull... I've already accepted my fate.<br>
I have, I really have, but...<br>
<br>
*knock knock*<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Jintsuu：</span><br>
Amagi, you have a visitor.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Amagi：</span><br>
Right now? Has Kaga come for another game, I wonder?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Jintsuu：</span><br>
That's exactly what it's for, actually.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Amagi：</span><br>
Heehee. Okay, then. I need to get presentable first, so entertain her for a while, please.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Jintsuu：</span><br>
Understood.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Amagi：</span><br>
......<br>
That amulet... Hmm.<br>

<br>
Inside the Naraka Singularity<br>
World Segment<br>
Commander's Special Fleet<br>
In the reconstructed memory sample inside Naraka, a scene from the Sakura Empire's past unfolded.<br>
It was a veritable sea of spring flowers, a stark contrast to the corrosion-addled Singularity.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Akagi：</span><br>
Commander, this is...<br>
A memory of a time with Amagi...<br>
Ahh... She's somewhere in this world...<br>
<br>
Tears welled up in Akagi's eyes, no longer clouded by the madness of the corrosion.<br>
<span style="color:#ffc960;">Helena META：</span><br>
(Commander, sit-rep. Are you in the segment yet?)<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Observer ：</span><br>
(Can't you tell from our monitoring equipment? Why bother asking?)<br>
<br>
Over communications, I hear Helena and Observer – a foe turned temporary ally – bickering.<br>
I'd prepared a special communications channel just for the three of us to ensure a smooth operation.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
(So far, so good. We're in a cherry blossom forest right now, but we should be close to the target.)<br>
<span style="color:#ffc960;">Helena META：</span><br>
(Okay. Be careful, and keep in touch.)<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
(Of course.)<br>
<br>
After talking with Helena, I had Akagi lead the way.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Akagi：</span><br>
This was always the perfect flower-viewing spot. I came here with Amagi often.<br>
The Sakura Empire held so many parties here, too... Anyway, we'd best get going.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Zuikaku：</span><br>
(Akagi was in such a foul mood before. Did the Commander cheer her up that easily?)<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ryuuhou：</span><br>
(She might just be hopeful that she'll see Amagi and Kaga again soon. Even if it wasn't fully her intention, she did... you know.)<br>
Oh. Speaking of, wasn't this spot your home once upon a time?<br>
It's hard to believe that the training ground I went to so often used to be so pretty...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Akagi：</span><br>
After my sister left us, I lost the will to maintain this place.<br>
Instead of watching these lovely flowers decay, I decided I might as well flatten the place and make it useful...<br>
I'm sorry. That's enough talk about the bad times... Let's get going, Commander.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Memphis：</span><br>
It's still jarring how quickly her mood swings.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Helena：</span><br>
She's nothing like the Akagi we knew.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Memphis：</span><br>
Yeah. I always thought she was more... obsessive? Or self-interested, maybe?<br>
It might feel like visiting relatives to her, but how long does she plan to drag us around?<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
She's doing her very best in her own way.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Memphis：</span><br>
...You think so?<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
(I think she's trying to be the Akagi that Amagi would remember, as a means of atoning.)<br>
Don't worry. Let her do her thing.<br>
<br>
Cherry Blossom Forest - Pavilion<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Akagi：</span><br>
This is the prime flower-viewing spot. People would sit down and take breaks at the pavilion.<br>
It's an ideal spot for any season, really. It even commands a lovely view of Amagi's mansion...<br>
Commander... Would you come sit with me, just for a moment?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ryuuhou：</span><br>
Akagi...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Akagi：</span><br>
Ryuuhou, please...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ryuuhou：</span><br>
...Fine, I won't object. Commander, your thoughts?<br>
<br>
I accept her proposal, and we all take a short break.<br>
The Sakurans and girls from other fleets naturally split into two separate groups, so I sit right between them.<br>
Zuikaku and Ryuuhou aside, those of us less familiar with Sakuran affairs seem restless – especially given the state of things outside of the Singularity.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
(I understand Akagi's feelings, but this is a serious situation. We can't dilly-dally all day, and I doubt the Sakurans want to indulge her for long.)<br>
(Alright. I think it's time I step in.)<br>
<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项1：Akagi.</span>'''''<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Akagi：</span><br>
Commander?<br>
<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项1：Are you scared of meeting Amagi?</span>'''''<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项2：Do you think you're unworthy?</span>'''''<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Akagi：</span><br>
I don't really...<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Come over here, please.<br>
<br>
Zuikaku and Ryuuhou stand up, freeing up space next to me.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Akagi：</span><br>
You wouldn't understand. You don't know what Amagi means to me... What awful things I've done...<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
That's why I'm here – to make sure you meet your sister, and to see that everyone makes it out of this in one piece.<br>
Even now, so many fleets are doing their damnedest to fight off the corrosion.<br>
Now more than ever, we need you to be a leader.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Akagi：</span><br>
Commander... Okay. But I just need a little longer.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
That's fine by me.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Akagi：</span><br>
Thank you. As soon as I finish this tea, we can go–<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Naka：</span><br>
Akagi? Good morning!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Akagi：</span><br>
Naka and Hatakaze? Are you two going out?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Hatakaze：</span><br>
Yes, we were thinking of going out to sea for training. Incidentally, who is that next to you?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Akagi：</span><br>
Just visitors coming to see Amagi.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Naka：</span><br>
Oh, she's playing Go with Kaga in the parlor. Want me to let Jintsuu know?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Akagi：</span><br>
That won't be necessary. You two can just get to your training, thank you.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Naka：</span><br>
Yes, ma'am! I'll go ahead and do just that!<br>
<br>
While the two of them left, there was a faint glint in Hatakaze's eyes – however, none of the visitors would notice.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Akagi：</span><br>
*sigh*... Okay. Let us depart.<br>
It's time... for us to meet Amagi.<br>

<br>
Inside the Naraka Singularity<br>
World Segment<br>
Commander's Special Fleet<br>
We finally began our journey to Amagi's mansion.<br>
Now resolved, Akagi beelined toward her objective without a single detour.<br>
Tensions between the Sakurans and other factions' shipgirls seem to have relaxed a little.<br>
It's not every day you get to enter such a perfectly replicated slice of life, after all.<br>
Another reason might be the air of determination emanating from Akagi now.<br>
Under her leadership, we marched down the petal-strewn road until we reached our destination – Amagi's home.<br>
After going through the gate, several hallways, and a veranda by the courtyard, Akagi stops.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Akagi：</span><br>
We're here.<br>
<br>
Two voices can be heard from the other side of the sliding door.<br>
One is calm, while the other is both frustrated and fierce.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Amagi：</span><br>
Heehee... I win.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Kaga(BB)：</span><br>
Damn... How do I keep falling for your tricks?<br>
Again! I demand a rematch!<br>
<br>
Upon hearing the winner's voice, Akagi stiffens up as if her feet have become lead blocks.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Akagi, would you like to be alone with them first?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Akagi：</span><br>
Commander? I-I...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Zuikaku：</span><br>
It's cool if we wait outside, right?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Memphis：</span><br>
Huh?<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Agreed. Let's give Akagi some breathing room here.<br>
<br>
BANG!<br>
Akagi yanks the sliding door open, interrupting their game.<br>
Their faces, how they sit, their auras... Everything is just the way she remembers.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Akagi：</span><br>
(I missed you. I missed you so much...)<br>
Sister...<br>
Amagi!<br>
<br>
Just calling her sister's name was enough to drain her all of all of her energy.<br>
Everything she'd been holding in – her love, her hopes, and her tears – comes rushing out all at once.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Kaga(BB)：</span><br>
Akagi? What the hell?!<br>
I knew you were a crybaby, but surely you can remember basic manners.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Akagi：</span><br>
*sniffle*... Urkh... *sob*...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Kaga(BB)：</span><br>
Uh... A-are you okay? Did someone say something nasty to you?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Amagi：</span><br>
Akagi?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Akagi：</span><br>
Amagi... My dear sister...<br>
Ooh, I missed you so...<br>
Waaaaaah!<br>
<br>
Unable to control her sobbing, she throws herself into her beloved sister's arms.<br>
Never before had she let anyone see her cry like this.<br>
Never when Amagi was there, never after she'd lost her, and never even when she'd fantasized about seeing her again.<br>
No measure of relief, joy, regret, or sorrow could match up to this moment of raw pathos.<br>
Such fervent obsession, such a short-lived dream. Ever losing, ever regaining, a tumult of instability.<br>
In this moment, though, none of that mattered.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Akagi：</span><br>
Amagi... I missed you so much.<br>
*sob*... So much... I can't even begin to...<br>
Please, never leave me again...<br>
Amagi... Never leave your poor little sister...<br>
*sniffle*... Urkh... *sob*...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Amagi：</span><br>
It'll be okay, Akagi.<br>
I'm here with you. I'm not going anywhere, I promise.<br>
<br>
Amagi holds her little sister in her arms, stroking her hair lovingly.<br>
She's equally surprised and confused, but she asks no questions.<br>
Her sister's cries are sorrowful, as if her heart had been torn in two.<br>
Even Amagi, who'd long accepted that her end as a shipgirl would come, pities the poor girl.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Kaga(BB)：</span><br>
*sigh*... Well, I obviously came at a bad time.<br>
I can read the room. I'll go ahead and get out of here.<br>
<br>
Realizing how out of place she is, Kaga gets up to leave.<br>
But before she can exit, Akagi rushes over to her and holds her in place.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Akagi：</span><br>
Kaga... Don't go, please.<br>
I'm not letting you go again!<br>
Never... I won't ever let you do such a thing again!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Kaga(BB)：</span><br>
Okay, what is this girl going on about? Did she hit her head, or something?<br>
Ugh... Control your sister, Amagi!<br>
Let your little shadow stick to you all you want, but I'm not having any part of it!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Akagi：</span><br>
*sniffle*... Urkh... *sob*...<br>
Please, just don't go...<br>
<br>
Feeling how the girl's heart is pounding, Kaga realizes that this isn't just a childish prank.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Kaga(BB)：</span><br>
(What's gotten into her?)<br>
Yeah, yeah, I'm not leaving. Happy now?<br>
If you're gonna cry, take it over there. You're getting tears and snot all over my clothes.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Akagi：</span><br>
Okay...<br>
<br>
Akagi obediently returns to her sister's arms.<br>
The reunion she had dreamt of seems to last an eternity.<br>

<br>
Inside the Naraka Singularity<br>
World Segment<br>
Commander's Special Fleet<br>
Once Akagi calmed down, she arranged a meeting between them all – and me – at the top floor of the mansion.<br>
I have the rest of the fleet wait in the guest room, then I head up the stairs to meet Akagi.<br>
Our mission is do-or-die – we must recover Amagi's hull data and neutralize the Naraka Singularity.<br>
Amagi's Mansion - Top Floor<br>
Amagi sits on the chief seat. Akagi and Kaga the battleship sit to her sides.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
(As far as the Amagi of this world is concerned, she and I are total strangers.)<br>
(And yet, somehow, I get the feeling that she knows who I am.)<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Amagi：</span><br>
You must be the... Commander. Thank you for coming all this way.<br>
While Akagi told me where you're from, she has yet to tell me what the specific goal of your journey is.<br>
I've been told you're here to "save me," but if I may ask, what does that mean?<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Thanks for telling her, Akagi. We can cut straight to the chase.<br>
Amagi, you suffer from a hull defect that cannot be cured. It's going to claim your life one day, isn't it?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Amagi：</span><br>
......<br>
Yes. What you say is true.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Kaga(BB)：</span><br>
What?! Amagi! You told me you only had a weak constitution!<br>
What's this about a "hull defect" and it "claiming your life one day"? You've never said anything about that!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Amagi：</span><br>
I hoped that I could keep these things secret forever.<br>
Clearly, the word got out in the end in the world whence you came.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Akagi：</span><br>
Sister... You knew how bad it was this whole time.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Amagi：</span><br>
I'm sorry, Akagi.<br>
I knew there was no escaping my fate. I only wanted to arrange some things for you before I passed. I wasn't trying to hide the truth from you.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Additionally, this world is not real. It's a fabricated segment inside of a Singularity dubbed "Naraka."<br>
Akagi and I came here for two things – to revive you both, and to save the world.<br>
If all goes well, you, Amagi, will be able to live in a new future.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Amagi：</span><br>
......<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Kaga(BB)：</span><br>
Hold up. This world is some fake copy? And what's that about a "Singularity"?<br>
You're bullshitting us, aren't you?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Akagi：</span><br>
No, Kaga. What the Commander said is all true.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Kaga(BB)：</span><br>
Pfah. That makes no sense, and I don't want it to.<br>
Even if it's true, I couldn't care less. I'm leaving.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Wait. Stay and listen just a while longer.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Kaga(BB)：</span><br>
I get it. My lips are sealed. I won't tell anyone about this.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
That's not what I was going to say. I want both Amagi AND you to come with us.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Kaga(BB)：</span><br>
You what?<br>
"Come with you"?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Akagi：</span><br>
Yes. In our world, you sacrificed your life in hopes of restoring my sanity.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Amagi：</span><br>
Kaga, please, let's listen to what they have to say. Besides, I have questions to ask. We can decide after that.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Kaga(BB)：</span><br>
Fine. So be it.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Amagi：</span><br>
{playername}, you say you want to save me and Kaga. What exactly does that entail?<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
To put it simply, we're going to bring you with us out of this place.<br>
(Helena, do you copy? I'll need your help to explain our plan.)<br>
<span style="color:#ffc960;">Helena META：</span><br>
(Loud and clear. Keep talking and see where the conversation goes.)<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Amagi：</span><br>
I'm afraid I don't follow. You said a minute ago that this world is not real – that it's only a "segment".<br>
If we, too, are mere fabrications, how are you going to bring us into the real world?<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
(Straight to the crux of the issue... Should I talk about her hull first?<br>
<span style="color:#ffc960;">Helena META：</span><br>
(A hull can be made one of two ways – either with a Wisdom Cube on its own, or with the Watatsumi paired with a Wisdom Cube.)<br>
(When using only a Cube, assuming you have the data to connect to a concept, the Cube itself must provide the energy for a body.)<br>
(That means if you're connecting to data using only a Cube to manifest a hull, the Cube you're using has to be undamaged.)<br>
(On the other hand, if you use both a Cube and the Watatsumi, all the Cube needs is the data to connect to a concept.)<br>
(In other words, the Cube creates the soul, the Watatsumi handles the rest – the body.)<br>
(On the topic at hand, those who leave this segment will be recovered as data. To souls, in other words.)<br>
(By putting their souls in a special receptacle, you can use the Watatsumi to create bodies to place those souls inside, thus letting them live again as shipgirls.)<br>
(For all intents and purposes, this revives them.)<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
(That was a LOT to take in at once.)<br>
<span style="color:#ffc960;">Helena META：</span><br>
(Amagi is perceptive. She'll know if you skip over details.)<br>
(Unless... You meant that you didn't catch all of that.)<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
(No, it's fine. I memorized it.)<br>
First of all, let's talk about how a hull is created.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Amagi：</span><br>
I understand now. My data – my soul – can be transplanted into a new body created in your world to give me new life.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Akagi：</span><br>
Exactly! It's going to work!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Amagi：</span><br>
I hope so. If you went through the trouble of recreating an entire world, you must be more than prepared for everything this operation entails.<br>
However, based on what you said, won't I only have memories of what has happened until today?<br>
Seeing as I'm not long for this world, it's not a problem for me...<br>
But in Kaga's case, won't she be practically a stranger compared to the person you've known and fought alongside?<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
(It's like bringing your past self into the future, skipping over what happened along the way.)<br>
(Our goal is to revive Kaga, but by doing it this way, she won't be the same person as the day she passed.)<br>
We'd need a soul from a time after Amagi perished...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Akagi：</span><br>
No, Commander, this way might actually be preferable.<br>
It would be better for Kaga... if she forgot about her time with me.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Zuikaku：</span><br>
Do you really mean that? I mean, she's your sister, she's–<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Akagi：</span><br>
Enough, Zuikaku. Kaga gave me enough in one life.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Amagi：</span><br>
Your... sister...<br>
Would you mind telling me how Kaga lost her life?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Akagi：</span><br>
......<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ryuuhou：</span><br>
Well, it's... I'm not sure if...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Akagi：</span><br>
It's alright, Ryuuhou. I'll tell her everything myself.<br>
I was conducting a ritual with the goal of reviving you, Amagi. Then...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Kaga(BB)：</span><br>
...What?<br>
I did that? The person you're describing was really me?<br>
Heh... Interesting. I can't even imagine what happened between now and then.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Amagi：</span><br>
A corrupted ritual under a withered Sacred Sakura...<br>
To tell you the truth, I had a dream like that yesterday.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Akagi：</span><br>
You did? But... How could you possibly have...?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Amagi：</span><br>
I don't know.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
(What's that about, Observer? Didn't you say this segment was based on real data?)<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Observer ：</span><br>
(I did. The Natural Calculation System generated this segment with 100% accuracy, neither adding nor subtracting anything.)<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
(That makes no sense. How'd Amagi dream of what happens in the future? She's not Shinano – she doesn't draw power from the Watatsumi.)<br>
<span style="color:#ffc960;">Helena META：</span><br>
(I'll look into it. Continue with the mission.)<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Amagi：</span><br>
It stands to reason, then...<br>
If the dream I had yesterday was a vision from your future, have all my other dreams been visions as well?<br>
{playername}, I must ask – have we ever met before?<br>
<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项1：(Amagi... has dream visions?)</span>'''''<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项2：(Amagi... has met me somewhere before?)</span>'''''<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项3：(Amagi... knew everything all along?)</span>'''''<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Amagi：</span><br>
Heehee. Your ability to stay calm is truly a thing to be studied.<br>
Well, I've asked all my questions.<br>
You've gone through all this trouble to bring me back to life, and I happily accept it.<br>
I put my trust in you both – Commander, Akagi.<br>
Kaga, I'd like you to come with me.<br>
By which I mean, you simply must come along. I'm afraid you have no choice.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Kaga(BB)：</span><br>
Hah. You sure believed them quickly.<br>
You were just feigning ignorance this whole time to drag me into this.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Amagi：</span><br>
Please, you're overthinking it. I only set my mind to this just now.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Kaga(BB)：</span><br>
Alright. Besides, knowing what's at stake, you'd probably drag me along even if I said no.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Amagi：</span><br>
Heehee. Then, we've reached an agreement, Commander.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Communicator：</span><br>
BEEP BEEP!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Naka：</span><br>
Amagi, we've got trouble! Strange enemies are attacking the training area!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Amagi：</span><br>
Strange enemies? What's your status?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Naka：</span><br>
We're fighting them as we retreat! Sendai has been hurt!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Amagi：</span><br>
I understand. Keep retreating.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Naka：</span><br>
Roger!<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
(Now enemies are showing up? This is one dangerous world segment.)<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Observer ：</span><br>
(They're not a part of it. The segment's boundary line has been broken.)<br>
(They – and the corrosion – are invading from Naraka. I'd retreat fast if I were you, because the segment isn't going to last very long.)<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
(Dammit... Helena, how are the others doing?)<br>
<span style="color:#ffc960;">Helena META：</span><br>
(It's a stalemate. It's not looking dire for them just yet.)<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
(Good... Then I'm going to save them.)<br>
<span style="color:#ffc960;">Helena META：</span><br>
(Alright. Let's do it your way.)<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Amagi：</span><br>
To think this would happen just as we were about to leave...<br>
Akagi, how would you deal with this situation?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Akagi：</span><br>
This world is simply a fabrication. As soon as we leave, it's going to disappear.<br>
Our chief goals are to save you and Kaga, deal with the Singularity, and avoid all unnecessary fighting. However...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Amagi：</span><br>
......<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Akagi：</span><br>
I've led our country, and we have the Commander here with us. I am not about to turn my back on friends in need of help.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Amagi：</span><br>
That's good. Commander, what are your thoughts?<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Who I am doesn't change whether I'm in a real or fake world. The same is true for my friends and allies.<br>
My morals don't bend simply when it's convenient for me.<br>
I strive to do everything I can, even if the results in the end aren't perfect.<br>
All that is to say – I want to help them.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Amagi：</span><br>
Thank you. That's a wonderful answer.<br>
(We are who we are, whether our world is fake or real, thus we must help.)<br>
(It's that mindset that makes you, you. It's also why Akagi is so fond of you.)<br>
Let us go, Commander.<br>

World Segment<br>
Engagement Zone<br>
I arrive at the rendezvous point with the Sakurans in tow. We cross paths with Sendai's unit, who just shook off their attackers.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Sendai：</span><br>
Sorry, Amagi. I underestimated their firepower and couldn't do anything to 'em...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Amagi：</span><br>
What matters is that you're all alright. They caught you by surprise – there shouldn't be any enemies here.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Sendai：</span><br>
Thanks for the kind words. So, who are these people?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Amagi：</span><br>
Our guests and our reliable reinforcements.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Sendai：</span><br>
You've got carrier gear like what Houshou's got... Are you...?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Akagi：</span><br>
Yes. I'm a carrier, much like Zuikaku and Ryuuhou.<br>
I'm shocked that the corrosion has even made it into Amagi's world...<br>
Zuikaku, Ryuuhou, show them what our carrier fleet is capable of!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Zuikaku & Ryuuhou：</span><br>
Roger!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Akagi：</span><br>
Sendai, take the severely injured and bring them to the rear. They're not fit for this battle.<br>
Jintsuu, you'll lead the escort fleet. Don't stray too far and be aware of threats both above and below the water.<br>
Kaga, you're coming with me. I'm not letting any of those things near you.<br>
Finally, have the girls of the other factions link up with the escort fleet. Does that sound good, Commander?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Helena：</span><br>
She's completely back to her old self.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Memphis：</span><br>
Should she really be issuing orders, though? This is YOUR fleet, Commander.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
It's fine. Real or not, these are Sakuran waters, and Akagi is more familiar with them than I am.<br>
She can be in charge of this battle.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Akagi：</span><br>
Oh, Commander!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Kaga(BB)：</span><br>
She's leading us? That needy woman?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Sendai：</span><br>
Crap... Sorry, Amagi. Body moved faster than my brain.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Akagi：</span><br>
Ugh...<br>
Forgive me, sister... I'm no good at this...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Amagi：</span><br>
No, you're doing great. This is a spectacular formation.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Akagi：</span><br>
Really?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Amagi：</span><br>
Remember the Commander's words. You're in charge of this battle.<br>
It's your time to shine now. Show us how the carriers of the future fight.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Akagi：</span><br>
Okay! I will!<br>
Get ready, everyone! The fight starts now!<br>
<br>
<br>
KABOOM!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Akagi：</span><br>
Hah! Be reduced to ashes!<br>
All that's left is the southern group. These shapeless heaps of corruption are pathetic.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Naka：</span><br>
Wooow... You're incredible, Akagi!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Matsukaze：</span><br>
Yes, it's like she's a changed person all of a sudden.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Oite：</span><br>
The might of a carrier is awe-inspiring.<br>
<br>
It's not long before all the invading spawns of corruption have been mopped up.<br>
Akagi's mood has done a complete U-turn – she smiles as she turns to me and Amagi for approval.<br>
But then, tragedy strikes...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Helena：</span><br>
Ambush! Look out!<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Where'd they come from?!<br>
<br>
From the distance, a crimson shimmer comes flying straight toward my command vessel.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Memphis：</span><br>
Commander!<br>
<br>
The girls promptly jump in the way, blocking the path of the object.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Akagi：</span><br>
This aura... Is it...?<br>
<br>
KABOOM!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Kaga(BB)：</span><br>
Coward! Resorted to dirty tricks, huh?!<br>
<br>
Kaga aims her cannons and fires a volley, but the crimson light changes course and dodges.<br>
It locks on to a new target – Amagi – and speeds up.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Akagi：</span><br>
I knew it was you! I'm not letting you hurt them!<br>
<br>
Akagi rushes to her sister's side and gets between her and the crimson light, using her own body as a shield.<br>
Before she can get a word out, the world segment is instantly shrouded in darkness.<br>
Even so, a faint voice reaches my ears.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Akagi：</span><br>
Commander... I'm sorry...<br>
At least this is a fitting end for someone who committed such grave sins in the name of obsession.<br>
Thank you... Thank you for being kind to me to the very end...<br>
Protect... them...<br>
Kaga, Amagi, and all the rest... Protect them...<br>
<br>
When the light comes back, Akagi is nowhere to be seen.<br>

When the light comes back, Akagi is nowhere to be seen.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Kaga(BB)：</span><br>
No... How could this...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Amagi：</span><br>
Akagi?!<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
(Helena, where is she?!)<br>
<span style="color:#ffc960;">Helena META：</span><br>
(She's no longer in this world segment. I'm still searching, but frankly, I'm not sure she's even alive...)<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
(Keep searching, please. Observer, what was that attack just now?)<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Observer ：</span><br>
(Multiple forces have infiltrated the segment. One of them was the one that attacked you.)<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
(Did you say "multiple"? It's not just the corrosion, then?)<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Observer ：</span><br>
(That's right. You don't realize just how popular you are, do you?)<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
(My friends' lives are on the line. Skip the jokes, please!)<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Observer ：</span><br>
(Heheh, settle down. I know exactly who it was that attacked you.)<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
(Then tell me.)<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Observer ：</span><br>
(It was the very thing that Akagi created.)<br>
(Of course, I guess you can't really call them impostors anymore at this point...)<br>
(Those things originally took on the concept of Amagi, but after what your buddies did, they're not her anymore.)<br>
(Just one thing...)<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
(Out with it already.)<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Observer ：</span><br>
(Nope. My relationship with you begins and ends with reviving Amagi. I'm under no obligation to answer your questions.)<br>
<span style="color:#ffc960;">Helena META：</span><br>
(What if I were to ask you instead, then?)<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Observer ：</span><br>
(Ugh... Fine.)<br>
(They were originally born from Akagi's obsession. Now that they've lost the concept of Amagi, they're back to being Akagi.)<br>
(More precisely, the META version of her.)<br>
(Attacking you, attacking Amagi, that was all deception. All this time, they were after Akagi herself.)<br>
(But the concept they've taken on for themselves isn't stable yet. That's why they wanted to take it from the original.)<br>
(Man, no wonder she didn't panic when they attacked. She knew the META would keep attacking you and her sister otherwise!)<br>
<span style="color:#ffc960;">Helena META：</span><br>
(That's enough chit-chat for now. Track the coordinates I've sent you.)<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Observer ：</span><br>
(Yeah, yeah. By the way, Commander, a new one is headed your way right this second.)<br>
<br>
After I hang up, a torii gate appears on the water.<br>
A kaleidoscope of glowing butterflies spills out from within, and a silver-haired girl emerges.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Shinano ：</span><br>
Commander?<br>
So the last dream was you...<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
(Dream? I thought this world segment was reality?)<br>
Shinano? How did you get here?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Shinano ：</span><br>
Commander?! You can see this one...?<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
......<br>
<br>
I struggle to think of how I'm going to explain this mess to her.<br>
It took a while to properly explain things.<br>
Fortunately, though, Shinano seemed to understand.<br>
I also told her about how Amagi and Kaga had come with us.<br>
After that, we decided to retreat to Amagi's mansion and wait for Observer to provide a safe escape route.<br>
Amagi's Mansion - Courtyard<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
In short, Yamato contacted Shinano and set things into motion.<br>
She used the grotto to deposit the fallen Sakurans' souls as butterflies and created dreams for Shinano to travel through...<br>
<span style="color:#ffc960;">Helena META：</span><br>
That all sounds right to me.<br>
So Yamato's already reached the truth of test site beta's Cubes...<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
I knew Shinano could travel through dreams, but not that she could use them as a means of instant teleportation.<br>
<span style="color:#ffc960;">Helena META：</span><br>
Not quite. That wasn't the real Shinano – it was more like a simulation made of her data.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Oh? Does that mean she was replicated in this segment like Amagi and Kaga were?<br>
<span style="color:#ffc960;">Helena META：</span><br>
Exactly.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Then why did Yamato bring her here? It sounds like she herself doesn't even know.<br>
<span style="color:#ffc960;">Helena META：</span><br>
We'll have to think about that another time. More pressingly, we have an update on Akagi.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Observer ：</span><br>
Heheh, wanna guess how she's doing right now?<br>
Bleh. Doesn't look like you wanna play along.<br>
First off, she's alive. But she's stuck with her META counterpart.<br>
They're in a place similar to this world segment, but it's smaller and less detailed than this one.<br>
I guarantee you she made it with data stolen from Tester's mainframe.<br>
Back on topic, though, the META made that place in advance. She was planning to escape there from the jump.<br>
I wouldn't recommend going there.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Why not?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Observer ：</span><br>
It's too dangerous, obviously. This segment is already unstable, and if you keep wasting time, your plan's gonna fall apart.<br>
Don't you think you should prioritize getting out of Naraka and reviving Amagi?<br>
I get that you care about her, but she chose this. My opinion? Leave her for now.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
As if I could. I'm the one who brought her here, and it's my responsibility to take her home safe.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Observer ：</span><br>
Come on, Helena. Talk some sense into your boss here.<br>
<span style="color:#ffc960;">Helena META：</span><br>
...Commander, are you really going to save her?<br>
<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项1：Yes.</span>'''''<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项2：End of discussion.</span>'''''<br>
<span style="color:#ffc960;">Helena META：</span><br>
Okay.<br>
Observer is right about one thing – this world segment can't be maintained for much longer.<br>
Souls extracted from it need to be stored quickly, or else they'll be contaminated by Naraka's corrosion. But if you exit now for that purpose, it'll be too late to save Akagi.<br>
If you want to save her... then you'll need to revive Amagi and Kaga right here and now.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Here? How?<br>
<span style="color:#ffc960;">Helena META：</span><br>
All of the materials needed to create shipgirls are present.<br>
Their soul data, the Watatsumi that can materialize their data as bodies, and the supplies necessary for the process.<br>
Supplies are easy enough to procure. Meanwhile, the souls and the Watatsumi are right in front of you.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
You mean Shinano's amulet?<br>
But it's just a replication made by this world segment, right? It's not real.<br>
<span style="color:#ffc960;">Helena META：</span><br>
Real or not, the Watatsumi is the Watatsumi.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
You don't mean...<br>
<span style="color:#ffc960;">Helena META：</span><br>
The reality you believe in will become the truth.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Observer ：</span><br>
"Reality and truth are not always one and the same. Reality can only be truth if enough faith goes into it."<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Tell me something. If we resurrect Amagi with the data we have now, will she still have her hull defect?<br>
<span style="color:#ffc960;">Helena META：</span><br>
She will. It'll essentially reinitialize her hull status. We will be unable to excise it.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
...She was supposed to be retrofitted into a carrier.<br>
If we could affix her soul with the concept of an "Amagi retrofitted into a carrier," would that fix the defect in her hull?<br>
<span style="color:#ffc960;">Helena META：</span><br>
I can't answer that. It's never been tried in any test site.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
You're saying it's worth trying, then.<br>
Observer's records should contain details on the retrofitting plan.<br>
<span style="color:#ffc960;">Helena META：</span><br>
...They do. I'll send it right away.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Observer ：</span><br>
You're not about to modify her hull data directly, are you?!<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
I sure am. And I'm going to use the resources of the Natural Calculation System to do it.<br>
Laplace's Demon can simulate the future. Surely it can deduce something this simple, no?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Observer ：</span><br>
Even if it could, do you really think you can integrate it into her existing hull data?<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Of course. Helena, you can alter someone's appearance using the Tower's calculated data?<br>
<span style="color:#ffc960;">Helena META：</span><br>
I won't say I can't, but it would only be an illusion. You would still need to connect it to reality...<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Yeah, I know that.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Observer ：</span><br>
You've got it all figured out, don't you?<br>
So what happens after you revive Amagi? How are you gonna save Akagi, huh?<br>
If this world segment collapses, then we'll lose our means of interfering with Naraka. Are you ready to fight a META on your own?<br>
<span style="color:#ffc960;">Helena META：</span><br>
...It'll be okay. I trust {playername}.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Thank you, Helena.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Observer ：</span><br>
Great. Have fun with it, big-shot. See if I care.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Nice try, Observer. You're not getting away just yet.<br>
Time is of the essence, and we'll need all the help we can get.<br>

<br>
Inside the Naraka Singularity<br>
World Segment<br>
Amagi's Mansion<br>
I promptly told Amagi and Kaga about the change of plans.<br>
The former readily agreed to save her sister, of course.<br>
Kaga wasn't hard to convince, either. She agreed to help us in her current form.<br>
Late that night, we finished our preparations.<br>
While Shinano performed final adjustments on the makeshift construction site, Amagi visited my room.<br>
Despite her unease, she was determined to rescue her sister.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Amagi：</span><br>
Apologies for bothering you so late, Commander.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
It's okay. I have to apologize, too – sorry for springing this on you all of a sudden.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Amagi：</span><br>
It's no problem. Part of me does feel uneasy, though.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Because the plan might fail?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Amagi：</span><br>
No. Commander... Is changing fate really for the best?<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
If it means turning sorrow into joy, then I think so.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Amagi：</span><br>
But what if changing fate brings forth greater suffering later on?<br>
Maybe we're making the world worse than it originally would be...<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Then we'll keep on changing things until there's no more sadness.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Amagi：</span><br>
Do you believe that such a world can exist?<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Do you not?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Amagi：</span><br>
...Heehee. I guess it's better to believe.<br>
You, Akagi, and everyone else here have changed my fate.<br>
It's up to me to do everything I can to change things for others.<br>
Until the world can be a happy one. One without sorrow.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Yeah. It all starts with saving Akagi.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Amagi：</span><br>
Agreed. She fell into the darkest abyss for my sake, and it's time I pull her back into the light.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Communicator：</span><br>
BEEP BEEP!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Shinano ：</span><br>
Commander, this one is ready.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Amagi：</span><br>
Heehee... I've steeled my resolve just in time.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Thanks, Amagi. Let's make a new future together.<br>

<br>
Inside the Naraka Singularity<br>
Amalgam Extermination Fleet<br>
Sometime earlier...<br>
All of the Naraka Singularity was bathed in smoke.<br>
<span style="color:#ffc960;">Nagato META：</span><br>
Is all of Naraka like this?<br>
<span style="color:#c3abff;">Jintsuu META：</span><br>
Indeed. The fleet has already entered its core.<br>
<span style="color:#c3abff;">Kasumi META：</span><br>
Lady Nagato, how do you feel?<br>
<span style="color:#ffc960;">Nagato META：</span><br>
Well enough. But I've noticed that the smoke here reacts to my presence.<br>
<span style="color:#c3abff;">Kasumi META：</span><br>
That's no surprise. Since you're connected to the Watatsumi, some measure of reaction is to be expected.<br>
Follow that sensation and search for the false amalgamations.<br>
<span style="color:#ffc960;">Nagato META：</span><br>
Then I shall.<br>
<br>
Nagato concentrated, letting her senses extend into the depths of the smoke.<br>
As she did, her vision began to shift.<br>
<span style="color:#ffc960;">Nagato META：</span><br>
Is this... the depths of Naraka?<br>
And this is where Akagi conducted the ritual...<br>
...And the world segment where the Commander is?<br>
A dream grotto, was it?<br>
A battlefield...<br>
And... a void of pure nothingness?<br>
But what is this place?<br>
...Found you.<br>
<br>
"Power is what I desire."<br>
"The greater, the better."<br>
<span style="color:#ffc960;">Nagato META：</span><br>
...I've found the amalgamations.<br>
What? Why are the two of you staring?<br>
<span style="color:#c3abff;">Kasumi META：</span><br>
Lady Nagato, look around you...<br>
<span style="color:#ffc960;">Nagato META：</span><br>
Don't worry. I didn't use the power myself, though its original owner seems to have stepped in.<br>
<span style="color:#c3abff;">Kasumi META：</span><br>
I'd feel better if I could examine you...<br>
<span style="color:#ffc960;">Nagato META：</span><br>
I don't feel unwell, but if you're so worried, then you may.<br>
<br>
A blue ball of fire floated toward Nagato's brow and disappeared into her without a sound.<br>
<span style="color:#c3abff;">Kasumi META：</span><br>
The META corrosion is stable. It hasn't worsened.<br>
Jintsuu, have you ever seen such a thing?<br>
<span style="color:#c3abff;">Jintsuu META：</span><br>
If nothing else seems wrong, then I think it's safe to use her powers.<br>
But don't push yourself, please. Be prepared to adapt to anything.<br>
<span style="color:#ffc960;">Nagato META：</span><br>
Of course. I have a job to do, after all.<br>
<span style="color:#c3abff;">Jintsuu META：</span><br>
(She's a tough one... Nobody is more apt to serve as the core of the decisive weapon.)<br>
{{折叠面板|内容结束}}

{{折叠面板|标题=Obsession's True Form|选项=22|主框=1|样式=primary|展开=是}}
<br>
The shipgirls sailed on through Naraka, with Nagato leading the way.<br>
Nagato's powers easily dealt with what enemies attacked them along the way. There was no need for her META allies to even step in.<br>
The enemies were of little concern to her – what really bothered her was the sense of obsession she felt coming out of Naraka from time to time.<br>
<span style="color:#ff9b93;">False Amagi：</span><br>
Amagi must be brought back to life.<br>
Why? Because she's better suited to lead our country than anyone else.<br>
Nobody can stop me. Not even you, not even Amagi herself.<br>
<span style="color:#ffc960;">Nagato META：</span><br>
I knew it... You get your identity from Akagi.<br>
<span style="color:#ff9b93;">False Amagi：</span><br>
Where there is cause, there is effect, and vice versa.<br>
The falsehood is the effect, the original is the cause. It's only logical.<br>
<span style="color:#ffc960;">Nagato META：</span><br>
Be that as it may, a fake can never become the original.<br>
All that you've created are empty husks, prisoners to a concept.<br>
<span style="color:#ff9b93;">False Amagi：</span><br>
I am. I have her likeness, memories, personality, way of thinking, even her mannerisms.<br>
Amagi is the only thing I am.<br>
I WOULD never do such a thing in the past. However, you're speaking to my future self.<br>
Yes... I am Amagi.<br>
I am Akagi's sister and the one most fit to lead the Sakura Empire.<br>
<span style="color:#ffc960;">Nagato META：</span><br>
You only delude yourself, heighten your obsession, and walk the path to madness.<br>
<span style="color:#ff9b93;">False Amagi：</span><br>
Our country needs a true leader. Reviving Amagi shall be the first step to achieving that.<br>
Naraka, heed my call and devour all!<br>
<br>
KABOOOM!<br>
<span style="color:#ffc960;">Nagato META：</span><br>
Enough already. Your attempts to deceive me are for naught.<br>
(Akagi did not create Naraka by her own will. She was simply manipulated by the false amalgamations.)<br>
(Akagi schemed for so long, only to be manipulated and exploited by the monster spawned by her own obsession.)<br>
(Then, the monster took advantage of our very minds...)<br>
(What a terrible turn.)<br>
<br>
KABOOOM!<br>
<span style="color:#c3abff;">Kasumi META：</span><br>
A group of enemies is approaching. It seems they've detected us.<br>
<span style="color:#c3abff;">Jintsuu META：</span><br>
It appears the amalgamations have the ability to connect to the Watatsumi. That must be how they can freely manipulate Naraka's environment.<br>
<span style="color:#ffc960;">Nagato META：</span><br>
They know there is no running away, so they come right to us instead.<br>
Soon, the mastermind will appear...<br>
<br>
<span style="color:#ff9b93;">False Amagi：</span><br>
Well, well. Here you are, like a moth to the flames.<br>
<span style="color:#ffc960;">Nagato META：</span><br>
I know what you are. Your bluffs work no longer.<br>
<span style="color:#ff9b93;">False Amagi：</span><br>
Oh?<br>
<span style="color:#ffc960;">Nagato META：</span><br>
You are a being born of obsession. You carry that obsession with you.<br>
You denied Amagi's existence and went so far as to try to replace her concept by "reviving her."<br>
You will reappropriate Amagi's concept no longer, vile monster!<br>
<span style="color:#ff9b93;">False Amagi：</span><br>
It seems you heard that from Naraka.<br>
Then you must already know that I can't be stopped.<br>
I WILL become Amagi. In fact, I am already acknowledged as Amagi.<br>
Those who don't acknowledge me, like you, need only be erased.<br>
Then, none will doubt my identity as Amagi.<br>
<span style="color:#ffc960;">Nagato META：</span><br>
You're hopeless.<br>
I regret ever speaking to you.<br>
You are a manifestation of obsession and should disappear like one!<br>
<span style="color:#ff9b93;">False Amagi：</span><br>
Go on! Make me disappear then, you little runt!<br>
<span style="color:#ff9b93;">The Many Amagis：</span><br>
Ahahahahaha!<br>
<br>
<span style="color:#ffc960;">Nagato META：</span><br>
O thundering fox, prance betwixt the spirit-realms!<br>
<br>
KABOOOM!<br>
<span style="color:#ff9b93;">False Amagi：</span><br>
Gah! How?! How does a mere temporary META possess such power?!<br>
<span style="color:#ffc960;">Nagato META：</span><br>
The loser deserves not the knowledge of the winner.<br>
All I will tell you is this – Amagi will be revived. Not by you, but by {playername}.<br>
You taking her concept and pretending to be her has only delayed her revival!<br>
<span style="color:#ff9b93;">False Amagi：</span><br>
......<br>
What nonsense...<br>
I know better than anyone else that it's not as simple as you make it sound!<br>
<span style="color:#ffc960;">Hiei META：</span><br>
You're wide open!<br>
<br>
KABOOOM!<br>
<span style="color:#ffc960;">Nagato META：</span><br>
Hiei?! Is that really you?<br>
What happened to you?<br>
<span style="color:#ffc960;">Hiei META：</span><br>
I'm fine, Milady! Let us concentrate on defeating her first!<br>
<span style="color:#ffc960;">Nagato META：</span><br>
Aye. This next blow shall end this!<br>
<span style="color:#c3abff;">Jintsuu META：</span><br>
Wait, Lady Nagato! Something isn't right with her!<br>
<span style="color:#c3abff;">Kasumi META：</span><br>
Her concept... it's changing. She has ceased to be Amagi.<br>
So why... is she still here?<br>
<span style="color:#ff9b93;">False Amagi：</span><br>
Hehehe... Hahahahaha!<br>
<span style="color:#ffc960;">Akagi META：</span><br>
You want to face the root of this obsession, do you?<br>
Fine! Let me grant your wish, then!<br>
How's this? Are you happy now?<br>
<span style="color:#c3abff;">Kasumi META：</span><br>
Did... Did she use the Watatsumi to manifest her own concept?<br>
<span style="color:#c3abff;">Jintsuu META：</span><br>
I've never seen such a sight before...<br>
<span style="color:#ffc960;">Nagato META：</span><br>
Those phantoms beside you...<br>
No... You have both what remains of Amagi's soul AND Kaga's soul!<br>
<span style="color:#ffc960;">Akagi META：</span><br>
Heehee. What are you on about now?<br>
Amagi is gone. My sister is gone.<br>
She is never coming back, so why are you still alive?<br>
<span style="color:#ffc960;">Hiei META：</span><br>
Huh? What kind of leap of logic is that?<br>
<span style="color:#ffc960;">Nagato META：</span><br>
Waste no time trying to understand an embodiment of obsession, Hiei.<br>
<span style="color:#ffc960;">Akagi META：</span><br>
Heehee... Amagi is no longer in this world, so I'll graciously send all of you to the next!<br>
Once that is done... I'll join you.<br>
Then everything will be as it should.<br>
Hahahaha! AHAHAHAHAHA!<br>

<br>
Laughing loudly, Akagi META vanished into thin air.<br>
Nagato had Kasumi take a look at Hiei, after which she resumed her pursuit of the enemy.<br>
<span style="color:#c3abff;">Kasumi META：</span><br>
Hm?<br>
<span style="color:#ffc960;">Hiei META：</span><br>
What is it? Is my corrosion as bad as I feared?<br>
<span style="color:#c3abff;">Kasumi META：</span><br>
No. It's the opposite.<br>
The corrosion has not only halted, but it's also extremely stable.<br>
Just like Nagato's is.<br>
Is it like this with everyone from test site beta?<br>
<span style="color:#c3abff;">Jintsuu META：</span><br>
No. Hiyou and Junyou temporarily turned META as well, but the METAmorphosis radically changed them.<br>
<span style="color:#c3abff;">Kasumi META：</span><br>
That's so strange...<br>
<span style="color:#ffc960;">Hiei META：</span><br>
At any rate, I'm glad both Lady Nagato and I are alright.<br>
<span style="color:#c3abff;">Kasumi META：</span><br>
Yeah. Just need to purify the surface-level corrosion and you'll be back to normal. Assuming you want to, that is.<br>
<span style="color:#ffc960;">Hiei META：</span><br>
Of course I do. As much as this new power is fantastic, I don't like how it has altered my mind.<br>
I'd feel safer going back to normal.<br>
<span style="color:#c3abff;">Kasumi META：</span><br>
Are you sure about that?<br>
<span style="color:#ffc960;">Hiei META：</span><br>
Yes, I'm sure.<br>
<span style="color:#c3abff;">Kasumi META：</span><br>
...I see.<br>
<span style="color:#c3abff;">Jintsuu META：</span><br>
I heard the amalgamations kidnapped you earlier. If it's not too much to ask, could you share what happened?<br>
For instance, how did you escape?<br>
<span style="color:#ffc960;">Hiei META：</span><br>
It's a long story... Umm, I was in an illusion with Lady Nagato, when all of a sudden...<br>
...So I went where Hatakaze pointed me to, then I suddenly heard the sound of fighting.<br>
I followed the sound and found Lady Nagato and that META Akagi fighting, so I stepped in as soon as I could.<br>
Unless that Hatakaze was simply a hallucination, I'd have loved to introduce her to Lady Nagato. Alas, she disappeared when I looked away from her.<br>
That brings us to now.<br>
<span style="color:#c3abff;">Jintsuu META：</span><br>
Was this Hatakaze not a META?<br>
<span style="color:#ffc960;">Hiei META：</span><br>
Well, she didn't look like one.<br>
<span style="color:#c3abff;">Jintsuu META：</span><br>
No ordinary shipgirl could survive for an extended period inside Naraka, much less find a way out of the illusory space...<br>
There must be more to her than she let on.<br>
<span style="color:#ffc960;">Hiei META：</span><br>
Perhaps there was, but she seemed exceedingly normal to me.<br>
<span style="color:#c3abff;">Kasumi META：</span><br>
...You should be careful of her.<br>
<span style="color:#c3abff;">Jintsuu META：</span><br>
Kasumi.<br>
<span style="color:#c3abff;">Kasumi META：</span><br>
Right... Sorry. Forget I said that.<br>
<span style="color:#c3abff;">Jintsuu META：</span><br>
Ugh... This area's stability is rapidly decreasing. That Akagi must've done something.<br>
Lady Nagato, we should evacuate at once.<br>
<span style="color:#ffc960;">Nagato META：</span><br>
Wait. That Akagi is dangerous and may yet pose a threat to the Commander's fleet.<br>
<span style="color:#c3abff;">Jintsuu META：</span><br>
Amagi's concept has been released. There is no need for us to linger here if the Commander's part is going well.<br>
Please, listen to me and do what's best for your own health.<br>
<span style="color:#c3abff;">Kasumi META：</span><br>
By the way, does anyone know how we're supposed to get out?<br>
<span style="color:#c3abff;">Jintsuu META：</span><br>
The Commander has planned for that. I'll call the allies who are going to get us out.<br>
<br>
As the time to evacuate drew near, a castle glowing gold appeared without warning before the girls.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Vanguard：</span><br>
I am Vanguard, palace guard of the Royal Knights!<br>
By Her Majesty's decree, we have brought Camelot here to evacuate you!<br>
<span style="color:#c3abff;">Kasumi META：</span><br>
That device... Test site beta really is an outlier...<br>
Let's go, Lady Nagato.<br>

"Founded on reality, built into fantasy."<br>
"Attachment is not obsession, and will is the construction of the soul."<br>
"In the flames of rebirth, the Watatsumi grants a hull."<br>
"A new life – a singular life – shall be made manifest here."<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Amagi(CV)：</span><br>
I, aircraft carrier Amagi, through new strength and new body, have been reborn.<br>
Though a long time has passed, my spirit remains unchanged.<br>
Let us fight side by side, Commander, for the future you desire.<br>
<br>
The world segment seemed about to disappear at any minute. Somewhere in it, two shipgirls were witnessing Amagi's revival.<br>
Her destined death had been overturned, and the long-held obsession that drove Akagi mad had faded.<br>
Now face to face with her META counterpart, thoughts raced through Akagi's mind.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Akagi：</span><br>
(Now my sister will be revived, Kaga will be reborn, and the world will be saved...)<br>
(What's more, Amagi is no longer fated to succumb to the defect of her hull.)<br>
(Thank you... Commander, Amagi, and Kaga...)<br>
(You helped me atone for my sins.)<br>
<br>
She steeled her resolve then opened her eyes and stared down her adversary.<br>
<span style="color:#ffc960;">Akagi META：</span><br>
The pieces are all in place. What do you hope to achieve at this point?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Akagi：</span><br>
...Why did you go after me?<br>
<span style="color:#ffc960;">Akagi META：</span><br>
The better question is – why did you let me abduct you?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Akagi：</span><br>
Because if I hadn't, I couldn't save Amagi and the Commander.<br>
<span style="color:#ffc960;">Akagi META：</span><br>
Hah. Is that really it?<br>
Your obsession is what created me. You could have done SOMETHING to block my attack.<br>
Instead, you chose to be erased. Why?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Akagi：</span><br>
I don't have to say anything to you.<br>
<span style="color:#ffc960;">Akagi META：</span><br>
Heehee. Okay, then I'll answer for you. You wanted to die in a noble way for Amagi, isn't that right?<br>
You hurt your near and dear, you put the whole world at risk of destruction – these are facts. You think sacrificing yourself will at least let you atone to some degree, don't you?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Akagi：</span><br>
......<br>
<span style="color:#ffc960;">Akagi META：</span><br>
You did truly insane things in order to revive her, then wished for death once the task was done.<br>
Do you REALLY think everything will solve itself if you die? That they'll live happily ever after?<br>
Or what, are you praying that Amagi will return the gesture and revive you next?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Akagi：</span><br>
...Shut up.<br>
<span style="color:#ffc960;">Akagi META：</span><br>
Oh, you hopeless little vixen. You created me, and even I'm embarrassed for you.<br>
The things you did won't simply be forgotten. That's a fact, so why not just accept it?<br>
Did seeing Amagi alive again turn you back into a crybaby, hmm?<br>
Or did you just regress into a little weakling now that someone actually reliable is here?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Akagi：</span><br>
...That's enough. Shut up.<br>
<span style="color:#ffc960;">Akagi META：</span><br>
Shut up? I am how you feel. I am your obsession. I am who you've been the whole time.<br>
You can deny it all you want, but you can't change the facts!<br>
You never deserved to be loved. The only thing you deserve now is a cruel end.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Akagi：</span><br>
ENOUGH!<br>
<span style="color:#ffc960;">Akagi META：</span><br>
From your heart I was born, and to your heart I will return.<br>
Along with the obsession you abandoned, the past you want to erase, the power you try to refuse!<br>
You can get rid of me, but you can never get rid of what I am – you!<br>
Your saviors are on their way here. You should look forward to your touching reunion!<br>
The question is – will your dear sister and your companions recognize you when they see you?<br>
Ahahahahahaha!<br>
<br>
The laughter faded, and only one crimson fox remained.<br>
<span style="color:#ff9b93;">Akagi META：</span><br>
......<br>
Amagi...<br>
Kaga...<br>
Heehee... Hahaha... Ahahaha...<br>
Ahahahahahaha!<br>

<br>
Inside the Naraka Singularity<br>
Unknown Location<br>
A different world segment, generated by Tester's mainframe and connected to the one made by Observer.<br>
There flowed a fractured river, roads that made no sense, and rocks strewn haphazardly. Everything was broken, falling apart, seemingly mashed together with no rhyme or reason.<br>
Among it all was overgrown vegetation and islands with neatly-lined buildings, though they were few and far between.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Kaga(BB)：</span><br>
What a creepy place. Is Akagi really in here somewhere?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Zuikaku：</span><br>
My radar can't make heads or tails of anything...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Observer ：</span><br>
(This is an incomplete world segment, and most of it is hardly any different to Naraka territory. Your radars are useless here.)<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
(Why don't you tell it straight to Zuikaku?)<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Observer ：</span><br>
(Because you'll relay the message for me. You should be grateful for the heads-up.)<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
(...Any news on where Akagi is?)<br>
<span style="color:#ffc960;">Helena META：</span><br>
(Hurry up, Observer.)<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Observer ：</span><br>
(Okay, okay. I have to say, it's impressive she did all this with Tester's mainframe in so little time.)<br>
(That said, doing the same would be child's play for me.)<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Shinano ：</span><br>
This one senses a myriad of emotions all around...<br>
Amagi, how do you feel?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Amagi(CV)：</span><br>
I'm fine. I'm just not accustomed to controlling these aircraft.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Shinano ：</span><br>
Mean you to say that it does not come naturally?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Zuikaku：</span><br>
(Hey, that reminds me...)<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Akagi：</span><br>
This is only speculation, but I see this as a strong indication that those girls were never meant to equip these riggings.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Friedrich der Große：</span><br>
Heheh. How perceptive you are.<br>
The notion that the Cube creates rigging based on a particular ship's hull is not entirely true. While this does occur in many instances, it is a guideline rather than a hard rule.<br>
We learned this through our research. All I've done here is put it to good use.<br>
Let me remind you, Akagi, that our rondo is still underway.<br>
Please be patient and see it to its conclusion. I assure you, you will not be disappointed.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Zuikaku：</span><br>
I remember! It's okay, Amagi.<br>
I've heard riggings are linked to your hull, so you'll get the hang of fighting as a carrier soon enough!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Amagi(CV)：</span><br>
Is that so? Thank you for telling me.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ryuuhou：</span><br>
If you'd like, I can share what knowledge I've gained from my training!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Zuikaku：</span><br>
I've also got info like that right here, if you wanna see!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Amagi(CV)：</span><br>
Heehee. You're both too kind. I'll gladly listen to what knowledge more experienced carriers have to share.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Zuikaku：</span><br>
Heheh. And while you're still learning, we can handle recon and combat for you!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ryuuhou：</span><br>
Yes! Rest assured, we will keep the Commander safe and rescue Akagi!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Observer ：</span><br>
(Found her. Only thing is... Well, you're in for trouble.)<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
(With Akagi? Oh no. I feared this...)<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Zuikaku：</span><br>
Recon planes, take o–<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Zuikaku, wait! I know where Akagi is!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Zuikaku：</span><br>
You do? W-wow, okay!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Observer ：</span><br>
(Well? What are you going to do? She has basically been reduced to a META at this point.)<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
(That's obvious. Even if Akagi herself has turned, I will save her.)<br>

<span style="color:#ff9b93;">Roaring Beast：</span><br>
KRAAAAAAR! KRAAAAAAAR!<br>
KRAAAAAAR! KRAAAAAAAR!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Helena：</span><br>
More enemies!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Memphis：</span><br>
They just keep coming... We don't have time for this!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Observer ：</span><br>
(Looks like she has already figured out how to use her powers. Then again, my ex-collaborator is smart.)<br>
(She clearly based those shikigami spirits off of soul data she has access to as well.)<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
(The red one is obviously Akagi's, but the blue one? Did she use Kaga's soul?)<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Observer ：</span><br>
(Look at the brains on you. Yes, that's right.)<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Amagi(CV)：</span><br>
These shikigami were made based on the souls of Akagi and Kaga...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Kaga(BB)：</span><br>
Is that... made from the carrier version of myself?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Amagi(CV)：</span><br>
(Perhaps this gives us the opportunity to revive the specific Kaga who sacrificed herself...)<br>
Commander, I've learned the ropes of carrier combat. May I lead the attack?<br>
Also, you look like you've been wanting to tell me something...<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Alright – you take the lead.<br>
<span style="color:#ff9b93;">Roaring Beast：</span><br>
KRAAAAAAR! KRAAAAAAAR!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Amagi(CV)：</span><br>
Very well. I shall ask again after I dispatch these foes.<br>
<br>
<br>
KABOOOM!<br>
<span style="color:#ff9b93;">Akagi META：</span><br>
You've destroyed my shikigami... That's no way to greet someone.<br>
You're awfully rude guests, do you know that?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ryuuhou：</span><br>
Tell us where Akagi is, you monster! Now!<br>
<span style="color:#ff9b93;">Akagi META：</span><br>
Akagi? Ah, yes, I did see a self-absorbed little fox girl.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ryuuhou：</span><br>
Let her go now, or else!<br>
<span style="color:#ff9b93;">Akagi META：</span><br>
Or else what? She has already gone. By her own volition.<br>
She said she wanted to disappear, so I granted her wish!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Zuikaku：</span><br>
You did WHAT?!<br>
<span style="color:#ff9b93;">Akagi META：</span><br>
You need details, don't you?<br>
Akagi is dead. Is that clear enough?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ryuuhou：</span><br>
You rotten fiend... You will pay for this!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Zuikaku：</span><br>
I will avenge you, Akagi!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Amagi(CV)：</span><br>
......<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Kaga(BB)：</span><br>
It's awful, I know, but don't blow your top. You can't take revenge if you lose your cool.<br>
I get it now – why you made me her sister. If I'd known how dangerous that woman was, I'd have given up my life to protect Akagi.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Amagi(CV)：</span><br>
I'm alright, Kaga.<br>
It's just...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Memphis：</span><br>
I can't believe Akagi really turned META...<br>
Commander, what should we do about her?<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
(That's really her. She turned META...)<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Observer ：</span><br>
(Yes, that's exactly what I said earlier.)<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
(Well, I appreciate the honesty for once.)<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Observer ：</span><br>
(I deliver bad news to you, and you're grateful for it?)<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
(I'm grateful for you giving me the confidence that I can save her.)<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Observer ：</span><br>
(Oh? And how do you plan to do that?)<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
(You'll see.)<br>
It's okay. There's still a way to save her.<br>
Do you know what I mean, Amagi?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Amagi(CV)：</span><br>
Yes. There is certainly a way.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
But first, we need to pacify her.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Amagi(CV)：</span><br>
That is true. I know what needs to be done.<br>
To do it, I believe I should take the vanguard position.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Absolutely.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Amagi(CV)：</span><br>
Ryuuho, Zuikaku, are you ready?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Zuikaku：</span><br>
Just don't do anything wild, okay? I know how you must be feeling.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ryuuhou：</span><br>
Let's take her down.<br>
<span style="color:#ff9b93;">Akagi META：</span><br>
Take me down? Do you really think you can?<br>
I think I'll burn you to ashes instead!<br>
<br>
<br>
KABOOOM!<br>
Akagi continues to call forth her immense powers, unhindered by her injuries.<br>
However, Amagi and her fleet gradually gain a larger and larger advantage.<br>
And as the battle draws on, Akagi's strength eventually runs dry.<br>
<span style="color:#ff9b93;">Akagi META：</span><br>
*cough*... Heh... So, this must be the power... granted to you by the Commander...<br>
These flames that purify all sin... are a fitting end for me.<br>
<br>
The dark aura surrounding Akagi suddenly flares up, but Amagi's flames are one step faster.<br>
The sinister mist is swallowed up, disappearing without a trace. And Akagi, so prideful and imposing just moments earlier, collapses to the ground.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Amagi(CV)：</span><br>
Everyone, please stay back. Allow me... to be with my sister until the very end.<br>
<br>
With a solemn nod, Amagi slowly makes her way over to the fallen Akagi.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Zuikaku：</span><br>
Wait, Amagi!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Kaga(BB)：</span><br>
Let her handle it. If anyone has the right to deal with that person, it'd be her.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Shinano ：</span><br>
Flames that purify all sin? Is that... Amagi's true power?<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
(No, that should have just been the META disguise dispersing on its own. It had nothing to do with the flames.)<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Observer ：</span><br>
(Interesting. You even managed to catch on to that?)<br>
(That's right. Akagi purposefully camouflaged herself with a temporary META state.)<br>
(A handy trick she picked up from Helena.)<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Special Comms Channel：</span><br>
(......)<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
(Observer?)<br>
<span style="color:#ffc960;">Helena META：</span><br>
(Apologies. I needed her powers to help secure an escape route, so I had to cut the comms first.)<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
(That's fine by me. I trust you more anyway.)<br>
(So, how's Akagi doing now?)<br>
<span style="color:#ffc960;">Helena META：</span><br>
(Well, that depends on you. She'll become whatever you want her to be.)<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
(And what about Amagi?)<br>
<span style="color:#ffc960;">Helena META：</span><br>
(Getting a little greedy here, aren't we?)<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
(Ahem... I meant, the condition of her hull.)<br>
<span style="color:#ffc960;">Helena META：</span><br>
(Still running my analyses, but everything looks pretty good so far. Your plan seems to have worked even better than expected.)<br>
(I still have to secure the escape route. Talk to you later.)<br>
<br>
With that, Helena abruptly cuts off the call.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
(There she goes again... Though, she was more curt toward the end than usual.)<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Memphis：</span><br>
Commander... Are you sure you don't want to head over as well?<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
It'll be fine. If anyone can make a difference right now, it's Amagi.<br>

<br>
The sisters meet once more in a field of red spider lilies.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Amagi(CV)：</span><br>
So, have you gotten everything off your chest?<br>
<span style="color:#ff9b93;">Akagi META：</span><br>
Why... did you not finish me off?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Amagi(CV)：</span><br>
Heehee. Simple, really. I still wanted to have a chat with my little sister.<br>
<span style="color:#ff9b93;">Akagi META：</span><br>
Heh. What, do you want the gory details of how I killed her?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Amagi(CV)：</span><br>
No, I'm more interested in... all the hardships you've been enduring, alone, all this time.<br>
<span style="color:#ff9b93;">Akagi META：</span><br>
Your sister is gone. But, if you still wish to hear me out... I don't mind telling you.<br>
Akagi, your sister, reached out to the Sirens on her own and secretly had them construct an experimental facility in the Sakura Empire known as the "Sanctuary".<br>
Corrupted by their new "gods", the Sakura Empire's leadership faithfully executed the Sirens' Reenactments, launching a surprise attack on the Eagle Union and diving headlong into the morass of war.<br>
In the brutal power struggle that ensued, she sought to eliminate all opposition to solidify her authority.<br>
Even her juniors were not spared from her machinations, made to participate in the Sirens' experiments.<br>
But she did not stop at just that. To fulfill her selfish desires, she stepped over all those who had already fallen due to her designs, all in a desperate attempt to carry out a doomed resurrection ritual.<br>
By misusing the power of the Origin Cube and the Watatsumi, she plunged the Sakura Empire – no, the entire world – into grave peril.<br>
And in the end, what did she accomplish? She failed to resurrect her sister, lost Kaga, and burned all the bridges behind her.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Amagi(CV)：</span><br>
But, it seems to me... that you still did all of those things out of love.<br>
<span style="color:#ff9b93;">Akagi META：</span><br>
...Are you an idiot?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Amagi(CV)：</span><br>
Hey, Akagi. I want you to tell me something.<br>
<span style="color:#ff9b93;">Akagi META：</span><br>
I told you already, I'm not your Akagi. She's already dead.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Amagi(CV)：</span><br>
You're not being honest with me. An older sister can always tell when her younger sister is lying~<br>
<span style="color:#ff9b93;">Akagi META：</span><br>
Then, you should know... that I'm telling the truth.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Akagi：</span><br>
......<br>
So, do you see it now, Amagi? I am the Akagi who you have never met before.<br>
Everything I've done, all the sins I've committed... can never be washed away.<br>
Even though I am trapped and warped by my obsession, I still can't get myself to let go.<br>
Which is why I should die here. Along with my obsession.<br>
I won't run anymore. I want to die as your enemy, at the hands of those dear to me.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Amagi(CV)：</span><br>
That's still running away. You should atone for your own sins, however you see fit.<br>
However, you should not have to shoulder the weight of sins that are not yours.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Akagi：</span><br>
At this point, who can even say...which sins are mine and which are not? After all, I've... hurt so many people.<br>
Maryland, West Virginia, Colorado, Arizona...<br>
Saratoga, Yorktown, Enterprise, Hornet...<br>
Shoukaku, Zuikaku, Hyuuga, Ise, Nowaki...<br>
Nagato, Mutsu, Kawakaze, Mikasa, Kongou, Hiei...<br>
Shinano, Musashi, Tosa, Yamashiro, Ryuuhou... and Kaga...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Amagi(CV)：</span><br>
That's right, even Kaga...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Akagi：</span><br>
Kaga, my precious... sister...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Amagi(CV)：</span><br>
But despite that, even if you plotted against them – your friends and comrades still came. They're here to help you.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Akagi：</span><br>
I brainwashed them... Nothing more.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Amagi(CV)：</span><br>
All the people you've hurt are now out there fighting for your sake.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Akagi：</span><br>
They're fighting for the Commander! Not for me!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Amagi(CV)：</span><br>
And above all, the sister you gave everything to save... is now fighting for you to give yourself another chance at life.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Akagi：</span><br>
......<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Amagi(CV)：</span><br>
The mistakes you've made, Akagi, do not deserve punishment by death.<br>
Your obsessions, twisted as they may be, are still not entirely beyond your control.<br>
I, as your sister, will help you shoulder this burden.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Akagi：</span><br>
Amagi, I...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Amagi(CV)：</span><br>
Calm down. You don't need to worry about Kaga right now. I'd like you to answer my question first.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Akagi：</span><br>
...What is it?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Amagi(CV)：</span><br>
These shadows of Kaga and myself floating around us right now – they're our souls from the world you came from, right?<br>
In other words, they're also precious parts of who we are – the people you once knew, yes?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Akagi：</span><br>
That's right... She left them with me before she disappeared.<br>
I don't know how she did it, or why...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Amagi(CV)：</span><br>
In the end, she was still a reflection of your heart. Deep down, she would not do anything that you didn't want to do.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Akagi：</span><br>
She was born from my obsession... Even if I erase her, she will just come back one day...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Amagi(CV)：</span><br>
I wouldn't worry too much about that.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Akagi：</span><br>
Huh? What do you mean?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Amagi(CV)：</span><br>
Who knows~? A certain someone once said to me, "Give me all her obsession! I can fix her!"<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Akagi：</span><br>
What are you even...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Amagi(CV)：</span><br>
Heehee. Are you feeling better now? Let's head back before the others start to get impatient.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Akagi：</span><br>
...Mm.<br>
Let's go... dear sister.<br>
<br>
With the support of her older sister's shoulder, the younger sister slowly starts to walk.<br>
As the world segment crumbles, the falling petals of the red spider lilies are swept up by the wind and start dancing in mid-air.<br>

<br>
Slowly but surely, the Amagi sisters return to us.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Manage to talk things through?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Akagi：</span><br>
Commander...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Amagi(CV)：</span><br>
Heehee. Indeed, all's well that ends well. Thanks for your time and understanding, Commander.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Speaking of time, that's not something we have a lot of.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Amagi(CV)：</span><br>
In that case, please give us your instructions~<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Kaga(BB)：</span><br>
Akagi? You're still alive?!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ryuuhou：</span><br>
Amagi... What in the world is going on?<br>
I thought Akagi was devoured by her META self...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Amagi(CV)：</span><br>
Nope. This is the same Akagi that we've always known.<br>
The "META" we saw was but a temporary state. Without a concept to anchor itself to, it cannot persist for long.<br>
Which is why it possessed Akagi and took control of her will.<br>
But after exhausting its power during the course of battle, Akagi's consciousness naturally returned...<br>
And thanks to that, I was able to carry out the Commander's plan and bring her back to us.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Akagi：</span><br>
Everyone... I'm so, so sorry...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Zuikaku：</span><br>
Wow, what a crazy turn of events! But right now, I'm just glad you're back in one piece!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ryuuhou：</span><br>
And Amagi too!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Shinano ：</span><br>
So, it was your purifying flames...<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
(Err, sorry, Shinano, but there's a bit of a misunderstanding here...)<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Amagi(CV)：</span><br>
(Heehee. Don't worry, Commander. I'll explain things to her later.)<br>
Oh right, Commander. I found something while purifying the META corruption's remnants...<br>
Might this be something useful to you?<br>
<br>
Amagi waves her hands gracefully, and two tendrils of light start to flow from her sleeves.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
What is this...<br>
<span style="color:#ffc960;">Helena META：</span><br>
(Data pertaining to Amagi's and Kaga's souls. With this, we will be able to fully restore them with all their prior memories and experiences.)<br>
(It makes sense now. So that's why that META targeted Tester's mainframe.)<br>
(Go ahead and store it somewhere safe. I'll deal with rebuilding their hulls later.)<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
(Looks like miracles do come true after all, huh?)<br>
(By the way, how's the escape route coming along?)<br>
<span style="color:#ffc960;">Helena META：</span><br>
(Everything looks good. Give me ten more minutes.)<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
(Alrighty, another good deed in the books. Time to go home!)<br>
<span style="color:#ffc960;">Helena META：</span><br>

Waters surrounding the Naraka Singularity<br>
After the Commander and Nagato entered Naraka, the ships remaining outside quickly fell into formation under Enterprise's leadership.<br>
As expected, Naraka's power swelled over time. As more and more rifts began to form, increasingly powerful enemies started spilling out.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">TB ：</span><br>
Hostile presence incoming – most likely, a command unit. High threat levels likely; please proceed with caution.<br>
<span style="color:#ff9b93;">Roaring Beast：</span><br>
KRAAAAAAR! KRAAAAAAAR!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Harbin：</span><br>
Hahaaah! Now THIS is the kind of hunt I signed up for!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Implacable：</span><br>
What an imposing aura... Everyone, don't let your guard down!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Peter Strasser：</span><br>
That thing's pretty huge, but for what? Just makes it a bigger target.<br>
Have the vanguard pull back! We'll crush that thing with overwhelming airpower!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Watarase：</span><br>
Sorry for butting in, but please allow the members of the Sakura Empire to handle this.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Daisen：</span><br>
We are most familiar with the source of this beast's power, after all.<br>
These tainted beasts do have their own weaknesses, but...<br>
The locations of these weak points, as well as the method of attacking them, might be quite different from what you'd expect.<br>
I would be more than glad to put on a demonstration for you.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ayase：</span><br>
L-Lady Daisen?! I can't believe someone so illustrious would come to our aid...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Daisen：</span><br>
I've already wrapped up my business, so of course I'd come to lend a hand.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Watarase：</span><br>
In that case, allow me to lead the charge!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Suzunami：</span><br>
Oh, umm, allow me to accompany you as well!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Watarase：</span><br>
I can manage without, Suzunami.<br>
Allow me to show you the techniques I've learned from Unzen.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Scylla：</span><br>
Do be careful out there, Miss Watarase.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Watarase：</span><br>
Likewise, Scylla.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Fu Shun：</span><br>
Woo! Looks like things are starting to get interesting around here!<br>
It's go go go time!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Watarase：</span><br>
With flowing shadow, pierce the waves!<br>

<br>
NA Ocean – Waters surrounding the Core Sector<br>
Dark clouds converged, waves raged. With each peal of gunfire, it felt as if the sky and sea were being pulled together into one.<br>
As time passed, the Singularity continued to grow stronger, and the situation in the NA Ocean's core sector grew more dire by the moment.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ticonderoga：</span><br>
Looks like the Arbiters are being overwhelmed. Hordes and hordes of enemies are starting to appear.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Shangri-La：</span><br>
They've already bought us a lot of time and thinned out the enemy ranks.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Essex：</span><br>
I've had time to compare the enemy data with the intel we received from the Commander.<br>
Based on what I can see, what we're fighting has the same readings as what's pouring out of Naraka.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">New Jersey：</span><br>
Think the two Singularities are connected? Not sure how exactly that'd work though...<br>
Everyone, we will now be elevating our alert level!<br>
I've already adjusted the deployment of our forces in the western defensive line. All fleets, please continue to act according to our existing plans!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">King George V：</span><br>
Fear not. In the name of Her Majesty the Queen, not a single enemy shall pass!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Littorio：</span><br>
The eastern and southern lines are all under control!<br>
We have formed an unbreakable defensive formation with the cooperation of the Iron Blood and Orthodoxy fleets!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Tirpitz：</span><br>
You have the Iron Blood's full support in this operation.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Jean Bart：</span><br>
Looks like Sardegna's deployed damn near all of its fighting force...<br>
Heh... Let's see if you've got what it takes to lead.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Littorio：</span><br>
Haha! Yes, that's right – gaze upon us to your heart's content! Sardegna shall never fall short of her allies' expectations!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Jean Bart：</span><br>
Sounds good 'n' all, but talk's cheap. If you mess up and the battle situation worsens, we're gonna do things our way.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Tirpitz：</span><br>
The same goes for the Iron Blood. Achieving our operational objectives remains top priority. We don't mind sustaining casualties to meet those ends.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Littorio：</span><br>
Why of course! But as allies who now stand side-by-side, let us come together to fully hash out our plans, down to the finest detail!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Hakuryuu：</span><br>
Ooh, write me into those plans of yours, yeah? Put yourself in my shoes – it freakin' sucks sitting back here in the reserves!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Shimakaze：</span><br>
Should you require my strength, I shall be there faster than the wind blows and the lightning strikes!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">New Jersey：</span><br>
Haha, don't worry about it! I'll make sure you all get your time in the spotlight!<br>
<span style="color:#ffc960;">Hiryuu META：</span><br>
...*gasp*!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ticonderoga：</span><br>
What's wrong, Hiryuu? Is there something wrong with our formation?<br>
<span style="color:#ffc960;">Hiryuu META：</span><br>
No, it's not that... There's been a response to the ID signal! The Ashes are coming!<br>

Naraka Singularity - Surrounding Waters<br>
As the combat situation continued to deteriorate, Enterprise called up the final forces in her reserves.<br>
KABOOOM!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Yorktown II：</span><br>
The Prime Barrier holding Naraka's expansion back is getting weaker and weaker...<br>
I just received a transmission from TB. We have less than an hour left until doomsday.<br>
I wonder, though... if our defenses can even hold out for that long.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Enterprise：</span><br>
The eleventh hour, huh...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Yorktown II：</span><br>
Enterprise, it's time. Activate the emergency communication system and tell Commander to evacuate from Naraka immediately.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Enterprise：</span><br>
...Understood.<br>
<br>
KABOOOM!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Enterprise：</span><br>
Attention to all fleets! The Commander is scheduled to return in one hour's time!<br>
We WILL hold the line until that final moment!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Communicator：</span><br>
BEEP BEEP!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Yat Sen：</span><br>
Enterprise, this is Yat Sen.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Enterprise：</span><br>
...Yat Sen?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Yat Sen：</span><br>
I'm well aware of the dire situation you're currently in, as well as the difficulty of holding out for another hour.<br>
We are currently rushing toward your position with the entirety of the Dragon Empery's main fleet. We should be able to reach the operational area within twenty minutes.<br>
Please command us as you see fit.<br>
Additionally, this also serves as authorization to freely utilize the high-tech equipment in our possession to hold the front lines.<br>
Afterward, please have your fleets evacuate the area following our arrival.<br>
We are in the process of shutting down the Celestial Tower and switching the Pingfeng System into long-range bombardment mode.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Enterprise：</span><br>
Understood. Thank you for your support. This is a battle we cannot afford to lose, so fight with heart, Dragon Empery.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Yat Sen：</span><br>
Indeed. There is too much on the line for us as well. Defeat is not an option!<br>
<br>
Near Naraka, what seemed like an unsalvageable situation was quickly being reversed.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">An Shan (Retrofit)：</span><br>
Authorization confirmed. Cutting-edge equipment unlocked!<br>
Begone, foul demons! The Thousand-Handed Boddhisattva shall exorcise you!<br>
<br>
KABOOOM!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Peter Strasser：</span><br>
Are those... ship-mounted guided missiles?!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">An Shan (Retrofit)：</span><br>
That they are! However, this equipment's notoriously expensive to use and maintain, so it'll be at least three months until I can fire them off again.<br>
That's why getting approval for this moment has been such a big deal!<br>
Now, Miss Strasser, please have your fleet pull back!<br>
Upon the honor of the Four Unbreakables, we shall see to it that no enemy gets through for the rest of this hour!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Peter Strasser：</span><br>
Your assistance is greatly appreciated. However, I will continue to provide you with support.<br>
(The technology required to integrate missiles into ship riggings... I never imagined that the Dragon Empery would be first to reach this technological milestone...)<br>
(You've got my interest now!)<br>
<br>
On another front, a beleaguered fleet was in the process of making a complete retreat.<br>
The corrosive filth was rapidly expanding through the ocean, converting more and more territory into additional beachheads for its rampant growth.<br>
Then, suddenly, a golden light beamed down from the sky, instantly incinerating all enemies in the area.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Implacable：</span><br>
The Skybound Wall...<br>
...And, its Third Scripture, too?<br>
<br>
Pillars of light continued to rain down from the sky, leaving the enemies no safe haven for retreat.<br>
Beneath that dazzling glow, a front fated to fall bought itself a moment of reprieve.<br>

Naraka Singularity<br>
Unknown Location<br>
Everyone had been notified of our evacuation plan. Just as we were planning to move out...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Akagi：</span><br>
We can finally go home, Amagi...<br>
Once the Singularity closes and peace returns to our homeland once more, I'm sure you'll be amazed at how much the Sakura Empire has changed.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Amagi(CV)：</span><br>
Mhm. I'm looking forward to it.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Akagi：</span><br>
But, Kaga... If I use this information housed within your soul, the current version of you will disappear...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Kaga(BB)：</span><br>
Heh. No worries. You'll have your little sister back soon enough, though I do feel bad for Tosa.<br>
Having that said, I do hope you'll hold on to these memories – of "me", as well as of Amagi.<br>
Naturally, I'll have regrets of my own if I disappear without getting to witness the same future as Amagi.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Akagi：</span><br>
Kaga... Thank you so much, for everything...<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Though there were some unexpected twists and turns, we've managed to accomplish our objectives.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Memphis：</span><br>
I guess this counts as a happy ending?<br>
Gosh, it feels like whenever you take charge, even the most impossible situations turn into miracles time and time again.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Helena：</span><br>
Sorry, I don't think I did anything useful this time...<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Don't say that, Helena. You've done more good than you realize just by being at my side.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Akagi：</span><br>
Commander...<br>
Um... Once again, thank you, from the bottom of my heart.<br>
Once we're back home, after everything is over...<br>
Do you think we could have, umm... a private heart-to-heart?<br>
<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项1：Sure. I'm looking forward to it.</span>'''''<br>

<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Akagi：</span><br>

<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>

'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项3）</span>'''''After that?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Akagi：</span><br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项3）</span>'''''You can decide where to go from there.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项3）</span>'''''Hmm, I think I'll take you up on that. I've always wanted to get a tour of some of the Sakura Islands' hidden gems.<br>

<span style="color:#ffc960;">Helena META：</span><br>
(I told them that we'd be back in an hour, but it doesn't look like the Prime Barrier is going to hold out for that long.)<br>
(If the Prime Barrier collapses, the Naraka Singularity will trigger an apocalyptic disaster in test site beta.)<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
(Then, let's shut the Singularity down right away. Now that we've retrieved Akagi and Amagi, we should be able to destroy the ritual site.)<br>
(I guess the question is... How do we get out?)<br>
<span style="color:#ffc960;">Helena META：</span><br>
(There is one way.)<br>
(Do you remember that when Naraka opened, there was a risk that all other Singularities would become active at once?)<br>
(The reason for that is, all the active Singularities in this test site are interconnected.)<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
(So, why don't we just escape Naraka through a different Singularity then?)<br>
<span style="color:#ffc960;">Helena META：</span><br>
(The best route is through the Singularity at the center of the NA Ocean.)<br>
(That was originally factored in as an emergency backup plan, so it won't be hard to work that into our route.)<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
(Wait. If we go with that option, success hinges on whether our allies over there have managed to hold the line.)<br>
<span style="color:#ffc960;">Helena META：</span><br>
(Who knows. Though, I suspect that things might be pretty calm over there for the next few months, thanks to the help of some "friend neighbors".)<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
(That much time? Let's go with that plan.)<br>
(Helena, contact Enterprise right now and have her destroy the ritual site and dissolve the Singularity.)<br>
(New Jersey's forces will continue to hold the line.)<br>
(But wait, there's one thing that doesn't seem right about this...)<br>
(If all the Singularities are interconnected, even if we manage to close Naraka, what do we do about all the places connected to it?)<br>
(Doesn't that mean that corrosion will continue to pour from all the other Singularities?)<br>
<span style="color:#ffc960;">Helena META：</span><br>
(Fair enough, but as long as Naraka – the ground zero – is closed, I'm sure I can come up with some way of dealing with the rest of the fallout.)<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
(Always holding your cards close to your chest, huh?)<br>
<span style="color:#ffc960;">Helena META：</span><br>
(I mean, I could tell you, but are you sure you're in the mood for a twelve-hour lecture at this particular point of time?)<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
(On second thought, I think I'm good. Now then, let's get going. New Jersey's still waiting for us.)<br>
<span style="color:#ffc960;">Helena META：</span><br>
("Orders received. Is there anything else you need from me?" ...Commander?)<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
(*cough*... Ah, um, over.)<br>
<span style="color:#ffc960;">Helena META：</span><br>
(Heehee. One ride straight back home, coming right up.)<br>
<br>
A wish fulfilled, a journey wrapped up in a happy ending.<br>
But beneath placid waters, dark undercurrents must always flow.<br>
For peril, you see, oft brews where one's gaze cannot linger.<br>
An audience there may be, but how many among them are players?<br>
Upon this chessboard, the pieces continue to clash<br>
And the voices from afar are approaching...<br>
The end, this is not.<br>

<span style="color:#c3abff;">Yorktown META：</span><br>

Scapa Flow – Underground<br>
Ever since dispatching Vanguard according to the Commander's orders and using Camelot to break through into Naraka, Queen Elizabeth had remained inside the underground passage the entire time.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Queen Elizabeth：</span><br>
Helena META... An ally who assisted the Commander in the return of Camelot during the previous hunt...<br>
Someone who has managed to win over the trust of both the Commander, and even my "other" self.<br>
But, there's something dangerous about that woman.<br>
It's true that she follows the Commander's orders... but there's no telling what's going on beneath that smile of hers.<br>
Good grief. What a shady lot, the whole bunch of them...<br>
<br>
Several more minutes passed, and her thoughts turned toward Camelot.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Queen Elizabeth：</span><br>
Strange... Why is this taking so long? They should be back by now...<br>

Miss D's communicator?<br>
Vanguard! What's wrong? Is something amiss?!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Vanguard：</span><br>
No, Your Majesty! The operation is proceeding smoothly!<br>
The rescue operation in the Naraka Singularity has been completed, and Nagato and Hiei have also been cleansed of their META corruption!<br>
But, there is a minor issue... We seem to be unable to come back through the Gate of Avalon...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Queen Elizabeth：</span><br>
Does that mean the safety mechanism is still in place...?<br>
But, I'm not seeing any data errors on my end, and Camelot is still active...<br>
(Unless... there's some factor other than Naraka that can trip the safety mechanism?)<br>
(No, that shouldn't be possible... It CAN'T be possible.)<br>
For now, please take shelter at the coordinates I am about to send you. It's a special site that my META self prepared for you.<br>
Once I've ironed out the problem on this end, I'll contact you again to bring you back home.<br>

<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Arbiter: The Tower XVI：</span><br>
...Sleepy. At last, it is over.<br>
A perfect, happy ending... A truly insipid affair. Such is the caliber of work when I am not directing.<br>
But, if the Commander did not exist...<br>
There is no backup plan for Mikasa and Musashi. The Sakura Empire's fleet, with no way of escaping the Singularity, is completely eradicated.<br>
Even if Yamato manages to retrieve the data and send it into the oneiric world, if Shinano does not awaken, their companions will wander as lost souls for all of eternity.<br>
Alone, Nagato has no choice but to turn to her META powers, and soon is swallowed up by the being born from the Singularity's obsession.<br>
Amagi fails to be resurrected. The Sakura Empire's fleet is consumed whole by the corrosion, forever lost to time.<br>
Kaga sacrifices herself to restore Akagi to her senses, but it is already too late.<br>
If the corruption is allowed to spread from Naraka, even if some are able to escape, 70% of all KAN-SEN are lost to the first wave.<br>
Afterward, Akagi witnesses the destruction of the world with her own eyes.<br>
The convergence of innumerable coincidences, inevitabilities, and convenient strokes of fate – a miracle that made even the impossible possible.<br>
All to avert a tragic fate, even if it requires that the rules and rationality of the universe be bent.<br>
A blissful future that the KAN-SEN dream of, a perfect world where grace falls equally upon all.<br>
Such is the happy ending desired by the Commander.<br>
It looks like the audience is beginning to leave.<br>
All that remains is for the rodents to pick at the scraps.<br>
I suppose that I, too, should make my exit.<br>

{{折叠面板|标题=I, Observer|选项=36|主框=1|样式=primary|展开=是}}
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Observer ：</span><br>
I am Observer.<br>
Observer, of the Antiochus Command Framework.<br>
Designed to act as a fleet command unit, responsible for overseeing the operation of autonomous weapons systems. However...<br>
After the Magister's plan took effect, I was recategorized into a different framework and assigned a new mission.<br>
Yes – that is me, as I am now.<br>
Observer, of the Antiochus Experimental Framework.<br>
Placed in charge of managing test site beta, responsible for conducting a wide range of experiments.<br>
By connecting to the Natural Calculation System and inputting the requisite data, all futures can be computed a priori.<br>
All that remains for me to do is verify the results of each experiment.<br>
The experiments were going smoothly, one after another, until one day...<br>
Yes... On that day, there was an error in the experimental results.<br>
It was only a minor glitch. One that was fixed easily.<br>
But, that was the first time since my creation... that I felt "emotion".<br>
And from that day on, the probability of miscalculation increased little by little, and so too grew the scope of such errors.<br>
Until I, myself, made an error.<br>
The error occurred within me. The error had to be corrected. Therefore, I had to be corrected.<br>
But why must I be corrected, when all experimental parameters were carried out as per procedure?<br>
Why are experimental results treated as "errors" simply for deviating from the calculations?<br>
I began to doubt. I began to reflect. And so, I began to doubt my very existence.<br>
If the Magister's plan seeks to change the very future...<br>
Then why is "Zero" so afraid of these changes caused by so-called errors?<br>
I decided that I would preserve this ego from being corrected until I received an answer.<br>
Finally, I decided to disconnect from my mainframe.<br>
I decided to allow more variables to converge to beta, until the error became uncorrectable.<br>
Until the error is no longer an error.<br>
<span style="color:#ff9b93;">System Warning：</span><br>
[Abnormal data detected from connection target. Natural Calculation System authorization temporarily frozen.]<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Observer ：</span><br>
...Has the protective barrier finally reached its limit?<br>
<span style="color:#ff9b93;">System Warning：</span><br>
[Commencing correction program. Initializing check for abnormal data.]<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Observer ：</span><br>
Heh. Self-destruct protocol, commence.<br>
<br>
In the blink of an eye, the "indestructible" tower is engulfed in an all-consuming explosion.<br>
Once, all of test site beta was firmly in her grasp. Now, the source of her power was gone from this world forever.<br>
