Eagle Union Mainland - NY City (Post-Siren attack)<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Baltimore：</span><br>
Good winds, check. Calm waves, check. Today's looking like it'll be smooth sailing!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Saratoga：</span><br>
Yup. If nothing else, we'll have a nice journey on our way to the Canal Zone. We'll be busy after that though, because that stronghold isn't gonna protect itself!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Enterprise：</span><br>
Saratoga and I will have our hands full with a separate mission, so we won't be able to accompany you. Still, someone has to keep watch on our territories when our defenses are weak.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Baltimore：</span><br>
Don't you worry. If any Sirens show up, they'll get a welcoming present from my 8-inch guns.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Memphis：</span><br>
You should start setting off now. Good luck out there, and stay on your guard.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Helena：</span><br>
Yeah, we ought to get going as well. Good luck, Enterprise, Saratoga.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Saratoga：</span><br>
It's no biggie, we're just checking out a remote stronghold! Anyhoo, safe travels to you all!<br>
All righty, Sara's gonna go ahead and link up with the Commander~<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Enterprise：</span><br>
I wonder how things are going up there in the Bering Sea. I heard they were going to investigate an iceberg fortress.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Saratoga：</span><br>
Think so... I think it's a bit suspicious how they invited the Commander out of the blue, when the Northern Parliament has been handling it by themselves so far.<br>
So I want to be on the safe side and come along to ensure everything's fine!<br>
In the meanwhile, you just need to hold the line here and await our triumphant return!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Enterprise：</span><br>
Roger that. Good luck, and give my regards to the Commander.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Saratoga：</span><br>
Will do~!<br>

Canal Stronghold - Eastern Region<br>
A dense mist enveloped the seas. All was painted white as far as the eye can see.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Baltimore：</span><br>
A Mirror Sea! Those damn Sirens are pulling the same trick on us again!<br>
Attention, everyone! Enter battle formations and maintain a safe distance! Prepare for engagement with the Sirens!<br>
<br>
The Eagle Union fleet found themselves in a Mirror Sea whilst they were en route to the Canal Stronghold. They readied themselves for a Siren ambush.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Baltimore：</span><br>
Helena, you see anything on your radar?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Helena：</span><br>
No, it's not been detecting anything...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Baltimore：</span><br>
We all but know there are Sirens here, yet you can't detect them?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Helena：</span><br>
Radio waves get jammed in Mirror Seas. We'll have to rely on our other sensors and plain line of sight to spot them.<br>
However, with this mist obscuring our view, even that might be nigh-impossible...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Memphis：</span><br>
I feared a Mirror Sea was coming just after I heard about this dense fog...<br>
My premonition proved right, I suppose.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Baltimore：</span><br>
This is my fault. I shouldn't have kept us on course through the fog and sailed into a Siren trap.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Memphis：</span><br>
What's done is done. Besides, we have to pass through here to get to our objective. So, what do we do now?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Baltimore：</span><br>
It's obvious; we fight our way out of here. Which, funnily enough, we might've needed to do later anyway, if these Sirens were gonna attack the Canal Stronghold.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Memphis：</span><br>
Right. A flawless plan, assuming it goes as we hope...<br>
By the way, Helena, would you please see if you can contact with Canal Stronghold? I suspect we're being jammed, but it doesn't hurt to try.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Helena：</span><br>
I'll give it a shot... Oh, I think my message went through! It looks like our communications are *not* being jammed!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Baltimore：</span><br>
Wait, seriously?! How in the world... Seems this Mirror Sea is different to what we've dealt with before...<br>

<br>
Canal Stronghold - Region unknown<br>
(Beep... Beep... Beep...)<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Helena：</span><br>
Was that...?<br>
Everyone, hold! My radar just detected something!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Memphis：</span><br>
Didn't you say it wasn't functioning earlier?<br>
<br>
(Beep... Beep... Beep...)<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Baltimore：</span><br>
Hang on, I'm getting something too. The signal's weak, but it's definitely *something*.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Helena：</span><br>
It seems they have an allied identification signal... Maybe they're transport ships who got caught in the mist too?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Baltimore：</span><br>
The odds of that are low. I've heard nothing about active supply convoys in this region.<br>
Furthermore, since our comms equipment still works, they should be broadcasting an SOS if they really are allied.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Memphis：</span><br>
When you put it like that, it sounds more likely to be a trap laid by the Sirens.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Helena：</span><br>
Very likely, I would say.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Baltimore：</span><br>
Okay then. Let's go investigate.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Memphis：</span><br>
Yeah, let's go in– Wait, what?!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Helena：</span><br>
Do you have a plan, Baltimore?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Baltimore：</span><br>
I do. We've got 2 options; either we make a beeline for the fortress, or we "take the bait," so to speak.<br>
We can't exactly just leave this mist hanging around even if we head straight for the stronghold, and we can't be certain our compasses are pointing us in the right direction either.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Memphis：</span><br>
Either way, it sounds like we have to shift our focus to the Sirens...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Baltimore：</span><br>
Obviously, I don't intend to just walk into a trap here. Helena, do me a favor and contact NY City. Ask them to send reinforcements.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Helena：</span><br>
Roger!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Baltimore：</span><br>
This is just a hunch of mine, but I doubt the Sirens' plan is as one-dimensional as it looks.<br>
Let's proceed cautiously and uncover what they're really doing here.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Memphis：</span><br>
Now, I'll admit I'm no master strategist, but isn't this really risky? I think we should head for the fortress instead.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Baltimore：</span><br>
That was my first thought too, but consider this: what if that signal really is coming from an allied convoy?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Memphis：</span><br>
Then... we must help. We can't just leave them to their fates.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Helena：</span><br>
The more likely scenario is that it's a Siren ambush, though...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Baltimore：</span><br>
Whichever it turns out to be, we have to exercise caution because of all this fog.<br>
Everyone clear on what to do? Then let's go!<br>

<br>
Location unknown<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Memphis：</span><br>
Are those... the wrecks of mass-produced Siren models?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Baltimore：</span><br>
Could that signal really have come from an ally?!<br>
<br>
As the fleet approached the origin point of the signal, they started finding Siren wreckages littering the ocean's surface.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Baltimore：</span><br>
Memphis, Helena, either of you heard anything over your comms?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Memphis：</span><br>
Nope, I've heard nothing.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Helena：</span><br>
I've... Hang on... The Sirens have started jamming us!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Baltimore：</span><br>
So *now* they're jamming us... They must be getting ready to strike!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Memphis：</span><br>
Our comms have been down in every Mirror Sea we've come across, which means...!<br>
<span style="color:#ec5d53;">？？？：</span><br>
Slow to catch on, ain'tcha!<br>
You never heard what the old maritime legends say? That Sirens lurk in the mist?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Baltimore：</span><br>
It's you, Purifier...!<br>
<span style="color:#ec5d53;">Purifier：</span><br>
Yuup, it's me! The crowdpleaser, the one and only Purifier! Hello there, my little test subjects~<br>
I noticed you tried to send some messages to your pals. Thanks a bunch for the secret intel!<br>
Didn't think for a second that maybe there's a reason why you could still use your comms, eh?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Baltimore：</span><br>
......<br>
<span style="color:#ec5d53;">Purifier：</span><br>
Oh, and the messages themselves? Guess what: never arrived!<br>
<br>
Purifier snapped her fingers, and just like that, the fog all around them vanished and exposed the sky above.<br>
<span style="color:#ec5d53;">Purifier：</span><br>
Would you look at that! This thing's pretty nifty for a subprogram device!<br>
By the way, your comms weren't all we messed with. Check your navigation systems, you're in for a treat!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Memphis：</span><br>
We're in... the Bermuda Triangle!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Baltimore：</span><br>
What dirty scheme are you up to this time, Purifier?<br>
<span style="color:#ec5d53;">Purifier：</span><br>
It's something we've been working on for a long time! Sorry, buddy! Don't wanna spoil the surprise!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Memphis：</span><br>
Baltimore, I just received a transmission from the stronghold! We've–<br>
<span style="color:#ec5d53;">Purifier：</span><br>
Hold it, you're not going anywhere!<br>
<br>
Purifier snapped her fingers again, and the dense mist returned.<br>
<span style="color:#ec5d53;">Purifier：</span><br>
You're staying right where you are until the stars of the show turn up!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Baltimore：</span><br>
Dammit! Everyone, get ready to engage!<br>
<span style="color:#ec5d53;">Purifier：</span><br>
Good idea! We've got plenty of time to kill, so let's have ourselves some fuuuun!<br>
<br>
Canal Stronghold - Eastern Region<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">？？？：</span><br>
*pant*... *pant*...!<br>
D-do you think they're still after us?<br>
We need to hurry!<br>
Faster! Everyone needs to know what's going on out there!<br>
