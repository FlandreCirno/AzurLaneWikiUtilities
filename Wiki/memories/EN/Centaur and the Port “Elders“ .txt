Centaur and the Port "Elders"<br>
<br>
Chapter 1 - The Venerated Elder<br>
Port - Pier<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Hermes：</span><br>
Today I practice drawing against the waves.<br>
It's my turn! Draw!<br>
<br>
Hermes was in perfect form as usual.<br>
... Just then, I saw someone peeking her head out from behind the wall...<br>
<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项1：Go see who it is.</span>'''''<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Centaur：</span><br>
Ah! Commander! Good morning!<br>
Oh, I'm here doing... perfectly normal... ordinary things! You know...<br>
<br>
I followed Centaur's line of sight all the way over to Hermes, practicing her draws.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Centaur：</span><br>
I have a little sister whose name is also Hermes. She's named after her, the Grand Matriarch of All Aircraft Carriers. I just wanted to bear witness to her.<br>
But I haven't been able to work up the courage to go talk to her... so I'd just as soon watch from the sidelines here...<br>
I don't suppose you could help me, Commander...?<br>
<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项1：Call Hermes over.</span>'''''<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Centaur：</span><br>
Waaaait?!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Hermes：</span><br>
What is it, Commander? Do you feel the urge to Duel burning within you?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Centaur：</span><br>
Um, Elder Hermes...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Hermes：</span><br>
You are... Oh! You're Centaur, our new recruit! I've heard you have a younger sister named Hermes, is that right?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Centaur：</span><br>
Y-Yes!<br>
<br>
Centaur let out a sigh of relief.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Hermes：</span><br>
Come then! Let's test your mettle in a duel!<br>
Commander, I'll be borrowing this one for a bit!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Centaur：</span><br>
Huh? Where? What?!<br>
<br>
Hermes started dragging Centaur off somewhere.<br>
She would grow accustomed to Hermes's eccentricities in time... probably.<br>

<br>
Chapter 2 - Centaur Pushes It<br>
Port - Plaza<br>
I was on patrol with my secretary, Centaur.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Hood：</span><br>
Out for a stroll with Centaur, are we, Commander?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Centaur：</span><br>
Good morning, Elder Hood! Indeed, we're making our appointed rounds.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Hood：</span><br>
My, how lovely it is to see a polite young lady who understands proper manners. Of course, you need not stand on ceremony. We are all equals here.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Centaur：</span><br>
I understand. However, as I see it, all the ladies of the fleet... you are all respected Elders worthy of esteem.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Hood：</span><br>
Hehe, I hadn't thought of it that way. Very well, as you were.<br>
I trust you'll be attending tomorrow's tea party?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Centaur：</span><br>
Yes, Elder Hood! I wouldn't miss it for the world!<br>
<br>
It seemed Centaur had no problem dealing with her "Elders" of the Royal Navy.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Mutsuki：</span><br>
Comainder, and, um, you, Ms., um... have a candy~<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Kisaragi：</span><br>
Mutsuki, that's Centaur. She's new to the fleet.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Centaur：</span><br>
Verily! Elder Mutsuki, Elder Kisaragi, I am Centaur of the Royal Navy.<br>
<br>
Centaur gave a deep bow to the two destroyers.<br>
<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项1：... What are you doing?</span>'''''<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Kisaragi：</span><br>
Huuuuh?! Elder...?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Centaur：</span><br>
Indeed. As far as I'm concerned, you two are honoured Elders worthy of my respect.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Mutsuki：</span><br>
Wow! No one's ever called me "Elder Mutsuki" before!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Kisaragi：</span><br>
Mutsuki, this isn't right... We can't have an aircraft carrier calling us "Elder," it's weird...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Mutsuki：</span><br>
It's fine! We just gotta lift up our heads and puff out our chests and act like the proud Elders we are!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Centaur：</span><br>
Yes, please don't mind me.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Kisaragi：</span><br>
Errmmm... But I still think it's kinda weird...<br>
<br>
... So Centaur would respectfully call everyone "Elder."<br>

Centaur and the Port "Elders"<br>
<br>
Chapter 3 - The Meaning of Respect<br>
Port - Office<br>
The business of Centaur calling everyone "Elder" had become the talk of the fleet.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Centaur：</span><br>
Hmmm...? Why is it I call everyone "Elder?" ... Commander, you know I was born after the War, don't you?<br>
Since the fighting was already over, there was a chance our entire class of ships would be cancelled.<br>
But in the end, for whatever reason, we came to be.<br>
However, with the War behind us, we never had a chance at the glorious, tumultuous lives of our Elders.<br>
I would be lying if I said I didn't yearn for that excitement.<br>
<br>
Centaur spoke dispassionately.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Centaur：</span><br>
And yet, it's more than that.<br>
Commander, I lived my life in a world of peace. I have never known the horrors of war.<br>
But the more I learn of the deeds of my storied Elders, the more I have come to understand what war is.<br>
It is not something that I, who has never experienced that hell, can invoke so cavalierly.<br>
That is why I so deeply respect and admire those Elders who fought in the War, and even more so those who did not survive it.<br>
In fact, the word "Elder" cannot adequately express the level of esteem to which I hold them.<br>
<br>
Centaur appeared lost in her thoughts.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Centaur：</span><br>
But if I'm causing trouble then perhaps I've miscalculated...<br>
I'll talk it over with everyone. If some Elders are bothered by it, I'll do what I can to show my respect through my actions rather than words.~<br>
<br>
I realized I had no reason to worry about Centaur, at least with this "Elder" business.<br>

Centaur and the Port "Elders"<br>
<br>
Chapter 4 - Unexpected Developments<br>
Port - Office<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Mutsuki：</span><br>
Centaur, come play house with us! Kisaragi wants you to play too!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Kisaragi：</span><br>
Yes. Even though I don't like planes, I like you, Centaur... Won't you play with me...?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Centaur：</span><br>
Oh, but of course I shall.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Sims：</span><br>
Centaur, did you forget you promised to play hide and seek with us?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Centaur：</span><br>
Certainly not, Elder Sims, I've been looking forward to it.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Sims：</span><br>
C'mon, let's go! Hammann is getting all pouty.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Cygnet：</span><br>
Um, 'scuse me, Commander... I'm lookin' for Centaur. She was gonna rehearse with me...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Centaur：</span><br>
Yes, Elder Cygnet, you go on ahead. I'll be along shortly.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Cygnet：</span><br>
Cheers. I've got a feelin' we'll have a lot more confidence with you there, Centaur. Don't forget now.<br>
<br>
I wasn't sure why, but once everyone heard about Centaur's little "Elder" quirk, she quickly grew popular among the destroyers.<br>
<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项1：Ask about her popularity.</span>'''''<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Centaur：</span><br>
I simply told the destroyer Elders my feelings, and they welcomed me with open arms.<br>
The destroyer Elders are truly kindhearted.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">???：</span><br>
...You're so lucky... How is it that my heartfelt, impassioned feelings still go unrequited...<br>
<br>
A cold, mature voice seething with jealousy emerged from parts unknown.<br>
...Although I didn't see her approach, I knew all this talk of destroyers would naturally summon one particular individual.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Centaur：</span><br>
Oh, Elder Ark Royal, good morning!<br>
<br>
Yes. That one.<br>

<br>
Chapter 5 - Centaur's Image<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ark Royal：</span><br>
You've managed to attain everything I've ever wished for in life... Oh, how I envy you...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Centaur：</span><br>
Oh, r- really...?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Victorious：</span><br>
Envying the youth is not a good look for you, Ark Royal.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ark Royal：</span><br>
But that's everything I've ever wanted!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Centaur：</span><br>
Ah! Good morning, Elder Victorious!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Victorious：</span><br>
Morning. Here's my mission report, Commander. Please look it over.<br>
<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项1：Look over the report.</span>'''''<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Victorious：</span><br>
My, upon closer inspection, I sense a sort of familiarity about you, Centaur. Why, I dare say with a change of clothes you could very well pass for me.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ark Royal：</span><br>
You think so too, Victorious? I'm glad I'm not the only one...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Victorious：</span><br>
You're in good spirits again! ...But are you sure this isn't just some psychological by-product of your jealousy?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ark Royal：</span><br>
Absolutely not! It's more that this air of familiarity emanating from Centaur has me wanting to get closer to her... at which point we can address the prior issue...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Victorious：</span><br>
All right then.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Centaur：</span><br>
To be honest, I feel the same familiarity from both of you, Elders.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Victorious：</span><br>
Do you now? What say we leave this silly old biddy behind and go for a spot of tea? We have much to discuss.<br>
Commander, would you mind lending me your secretary for a tick?<br>
<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项1：Nod in agreement.</span>'''''<br>
<br>
......<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Victorious：</span><br>
Now Centaur, your appearance here truly is unique. Take these ears, for example, are they as real as Duke of York's?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Centaur：</span><br>
Indeed. Actually, I was somewhat surprised when I noticed I was a bit different from my Elders.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ark Royal：</span><br>
That's true. They're not even like the animal ears on the Sakura girls. Really something special.<br>
Any idea why that is, Commander?<br>
<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项1：Shake your head negatively.</span>'''''<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Centaur：</span><br>
Um, while I don't fully understand it myself, from time to time, I do get a sort of foggy image that comes to mind...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Victorious：</span><br>
Oh? And what is it?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Centaur：</span><br>
Might it have something to do with my name? A centaur is a mythological creature from deep in the forest, after all.<br>
Perhaps that forms an association in the collective consciousness with the race of forest-dwelling Elves...?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ark Royal：</span><br>
"Collective consciousness...?" That sounds like the kind of thing Akashi and Yuubari are always on about.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Centaur：</span><br>
Elder Akashi and Elder Yuubari? I'll have to be sure to ask them about it next time I see them.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Victorious：</span><br>
So these ears truly are as mysterious as Duke of York's... Anyway, these fantastical clothes of yours are very much my style. You'll have to let me look at them so I can make myself a set.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Centaur：</span><br>
That would be fine...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Victorious：</span><br>
Now I have some matters to attend to. ――Commander, I'm returning your secretary.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ark Royal：</span><br>
I should be going as well. But Centaur, the next time you play with the destroyer girls, why don't you, um, well, invite me along...?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Centaur：</span><br>
Certainly! Thank you very much, Elders!<br>

Centaur and the Port "Elders"<br>
<br>
Chapter 6 - Childe of the Fleet<br>
Port - Plaza<br>
I was on patrol with my secretary, Centaur.<br>
Although, honestly, by this point, Centaur was capable of handling this particular duty on her own.<br>
But she insisted it was bad for my health to sit too long, so she forced me to come out with her.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Hood：</span><br>
Out for a stroll with Centaur, are we, Commander?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Centaur：</span><br>
Oh, yes, indeed! And good morning to you, Elder Hood!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Hood：</span><br>
Hehe, aren't you ever the polite child.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Centaur：</span><br>
Oh my no, you flatter me.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Hood：</span><br>
Did you get a chance to try that tea I gave you?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Centaur：</span><br>
Yes! I can't say I know much about tea, but it was delicious!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Hood：</span><br>
I'm glad you liked it. If you'd ever like to know more about tea, my door is always open.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Centaur：</span><br>
Thank you very much.~<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Mutsuki：</span><br>
Hey! It's Centaur!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Kisaragi：</span><br>
Are you working again, Centaur...?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Centaur：</span><br>
Yes, I am! And I see these two Elders are in fine spirits today!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Kisaragi：</span><br>
Make sure to work hard...!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Centaur：</span><br>
I won't let you down!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Mutsuki：</span><br>
Centaur, I'm giving you this candy so you'll remember to come play with us!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Centaur：</span><br>
Of course. I'll play with you later today.<br>
<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项1：Ask Mutsuki for some candy.</span>'''''<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Mutsuki：</span><br>
No candy for Comainder!<br>
<br>
I felt ever so slightly spurned...<br>
While she was still calling everyone "Elder," Centaur's interactions with the rest of the fleet had become much less awkward.<br>
<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项1：Ask her why she's still calling everyone "Elder."</span>'''''<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Centaur：</span><br>
Oh, that? I suppose it's because "Elder" has a new meaning for me~~<br>

<br>
Centaur and the Port "Elders"<br>
<br>
Chapter 7 - True Equals<br>
Centaur spoke of the "new meaning" of "Elder."<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Centaur：</span><br>
It has been some time since I first joined the fleet.<br>
In that time, I've grown closer to my Elders, and seen past the walls they put up on the battlefield.<br>
I know now they are people, just like me. They have sadness and they have joy, they have their likes and their dislikes.<br>
Like you, Commander, you have those times when you just can't take work anymore and you doze off on your desk.<br>
<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项1：Explain to her that's completely normal.</span>'''''<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Centaur：</span><br>
Yes, it's completely normal. Just as everyone has their own opinions, and from time to time that leads to conflict...<br>
But in service of our collective goals, we work together, we help each other. That's the fleet I always dreamt of.<br>
And now I'm a part of that fleet too... so no longer do I merely respect everyone, now I truly love everyone.<br>
<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项1：Ask her if that includes her Commander...</span>'''''<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Centaur：</span><br>
C- Commander... of course, I love you too...<br>
<br>
Centaur turned bright red.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Centaur：</span><br>
What I'm getting at is, in the beginning, I called everyone "Elder" because I respected their service in the Great War.<br>
But now, because I so love and cherish fighting alongside them in the name of peace, that's why I call them Elder.<br>
Ahahaha, and I'm a little embarrassed to say it, but the main reason is I just got used to calling everyone that!<br>
<br>
It was so complicated, and yet so simple...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Centaur：</span><br>
I'm doing all the talking here. Now it's your turn, Commander.<br>
I mean, I've been your secretary ship for this long. It's only natural I've gotten to know you very well.<br>
But I'd still like to hear some of it straight from the horse's mouth. Tell me a secret, Commander. Tell me something you've never told anyone.<br>
Hehe, won't you tell me more... about you? Commander...? ... Oh Elder One...?<br>
