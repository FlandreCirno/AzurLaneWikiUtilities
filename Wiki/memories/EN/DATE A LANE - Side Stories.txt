<br>
Yorktown introduced Hammann and Sims to Ratatoskr's commander, Kotori Itsuka, and explained the details of the mission they needed to help with.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Kotori Itsuka：</span><br>
It's an honor to have the two of you helping out. Here's the situation: we recently upgraded our monitoring equipment, letting us measure emotional data with greater precision.<br>
So, in order to verify this, we're going to need live data. Now then, let's get Operation Affinity Point underway. Any questions?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Sims：</span><br>
W-wait, time out... What the heck is "Operation Affinity Point" anyway?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Hammann：</span><br>
I... don't think that's something we have any business knowing.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Yorktown：</span><br>
That's not what I want to hear right now. Didn't I already explain the process of gathering and testing affinity points to the two of you?<br>
<br>
Hammann and Sims say nothing back, only shiftily glancing at one another.<br>
The gesture doesn't escape Kotori's notice. Lollipop still in mouth, she gives an expression that seems to say, "I get it."<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Kotori Itsuka：</span><br>
Hmm... So that's the issue. If you'd like, I can provide some one-on-one dating advice...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Sims＆Hammann：</span><br>
Th-then, let's get started!<br>
<br>
After arriving at the shopping district, Hammann and Sims begin their operation. Yorktown and Kotori are not far away, gathering and monitoring data in the meanwhile.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Yorktown：</span><br>
If I'm understanding this correctly... You just want them to walk around town together and have dinner?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Kotori Itsuka：</span><br>
Of course. Because, these things are surprisingly important. After all, emotional connections are nurtured by the accumulation of small, everyday happenings.<br>
In fact, it's often the little things that grant big opportunities to deepen your friendships.<br>
See, their affinity points are definitely increasing, are they not?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Yorktown：</span><br>
And, the biggest boost... came from choosing their outfits together, enjoying snacks together, and watching a movie together... Heehee. How nice.<br>
<br>
Yorktown breathes a sigh of relief after checking the graph on the monitor.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Yorktown：</span><br>
Oh, they just came out of the movie theater. So, there's just one last task on the list?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Kotori Itsuka：</span><br>
That's right. The last thing to do– is picking out a gift for each other!<br>
Now then, let's see how high those affinity points will go!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Yorktown：</span><br>
Seems like they're starting with the accessories shop? ...Hm?<br>
<br>
All of a sudden, Kotori's device starts beeping. The two lines on the graph begin to crash one after the other.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Yorktown：</span><br>
...Their affinity points are plummeting?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Kotori Itsuka：</span><br>
Hmm, that's odd... Maybe my handheld device is bugged?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Yorktown：</span><br>
One moment! I'll go check what's going on!<br>
<br>
With an anxious look on her face, Yorktown heads down to see what the situation is.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Kotori Itsuka：</span><br>
Huh... Looks like there aren't any bugs on my end...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Hammann：</span><br>
I saw it first!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Sims：</span><br>
Hmph... Doesn't count until you actually grab it.<br>
<br>
Just as Kotori finishes checking out her device, Hammann and Sims come back while continuing to argue. Yorktown can only look at them with a confused expression.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Yorktown：</span><br>
I'm sorry, Kotori. There was only one thing left at the store, and they both had their eye on it... Which led to them getting in this argument...<br>
This means... that their affinity points will go way down, right?<br>
<br>
Kotori responds with only a shrug, smiling wryly while still holding the candy in her mouth.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Kotori Itsuka：</span><br>
Ah... I see. That makes perfect sense.<br>
Don't worry. You know that they say – the more you argue, the closer you are. This sort of bickering is only possible if you've opened up to the other person.<br>
<br>
Just then, her device gives off a little beep. The lines that had previously taken a nosedive return to normal... and then suddenly start to climb even higher.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Yorktown：</span><br>
Huh? Wow, you were right... it's going higher and higher. Heehee.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Kotori Itsuka：</span><br>
Heh. Now that we've come this far, I don't think it would be an exaggeration to call the two of them best friends.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Sims：</span><br>
Us? Best friends? Yeah, right. Are you sure your device isn't broken?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Hammann：</span><br>
Yeah, that's right! A little kid who tries to grab the same thing as me is no best friend of mine! Dum-dum!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Kotori Itsuka：</span><br>
Hehe. Well, we were still able to gather some good data either way. Now then... who wants that one-on-one dating advice first?<br>

{{折叠面板|标题=How to Use Zafkiel Properly|选项=2|主框=1|样式=primary|展开=是}}
<br>
The sound of glass shattering suddenly echoed out across the quiet back alleys of the shopping district. It doesn't take long for a woman to appear in front of Kurumi Tokisaki, trying to assess the situation.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Kurumi Tokisaki：</span><br>
My, my. Is something the matter? I get so very nervous when you stare at me with such a serious expression. Here I am trying to behave and follow the rules, but...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Belfast：</span><br>
Miss Tokisaki, according to eyewitness accounts, you are responsible for breaking the window of a store in the shopping district. You will be expected to pay compensation.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Kurumi Tokisaki：</span><br>
Really, is that so? I do not remember doing anything of the sort.<br>
Hmm... Perhaps it might've been one of my clones?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Belfast：</span><br>
You... have clones?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Kurumi Tokisaki：</span><br>
Yes, indeed. My Angel, Zafkiel, can create clones of my self. At times... they can even act of their own will.<br>
Perhaps what people saw... was a slightly rowdier version of "me".<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Akashi：</span><br>
Nya?! Does that mean multiple Kurumis can exist at the same time, nya?!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Kurumi Tokisaki：</span><br>
...Who might you be?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Akashi：</span><br>
The witn– I mean, uhh, the owner of this store, nya! In any case, don't worry about the compensation, nya.<br>
The more important thing here is your ability, nya! So, I hereby propose a partnership, nya!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Kurumi Tokisaki：</span><br>
...A partnership?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Akashi：</span><br>
That's right! Using the cloning powers, we'll be able to create the greatest one-woman entrepreneurial service team in history!<br>
If every job, from manager to staff, is just another one of you, then all the customers will get to have the authentic Kurumi treatment, nya!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Kurumi Tokisaki：</span><br>
My, my. How interesting...<br>
But before that, I first want to know exactly what it is that my clone did. Would you mind showing me the scene of the incident?<br>
<br>
Though somewhat deflated-looking, Akashi shows Kurumi to the scene.<br>
Standing before the shattered glass, Kurumi finds herself deep in thought.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Akashi：</span><br>
While the security footage undoubtedly shows you in it, nya... It doesn't actually show how the glass broke, nya.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Laffey：</span><br>
Kurumi...? Thanks for saving the kitten earlier...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Kurumi Tokisaki：</span><br>
A kitten, you say? ...Heehee, I see. I think I'm starting to understand what this clone of mine was trying to do.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Laffey：</span><br>
...Clone?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Belfast：</span><br>
It seems this is no coincidence, then. Miss Laffey, could you please detail what happened earlier?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Laffey：</span><br>
Kurumi showed up out of nowhere... and fired her gun at a kitten that was standing in front of a window...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Belfast：</span><br>
She was aiming at the kitten? Not the window?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Laffey：</span><br>
...Yes. But before I realized what just happened, the kitten was safely in Kurumi's arms...<br>
<br>
Laffey's account finally begins to shine a light on what happened.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Kurumi Tokisaki：</span><br>
I see. My clone must've used the bullet that rewinds time – Dalet.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Laffey：</span><br>
Rewinds... time?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Kurumi Tokisaki：</span><br>
Yes, indeed. It is one of the bullets in the arsenal of my Angel, Zafkiel. It is a power that only I can use, though I have stored a number of these bullets with my clones, just in case.<br>
I set a condition that they would only be allowed to be used during emergencies, but I suppose if it's for the kitten's sake, there's nothing to be said.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Laffey：</span><br>
...Mhm. In any case, thanks to Kurumi, the kitten was saved.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Kurumi Tokisaki：</span><br>
As for the window itself, it likely shattered for some other reason. But, let us see this through to the end. With this bullet, allow me to prove my innocence.<br>
Zafkiel–– Dalet!<br>
<br>
The moment Kurumi fires her gun, the window itself begins to return to its original state, like a tape played in reverse.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Akashi：</span><br>
She's turning back time, nya?! If only I could use that for my businesses...!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Belfast：</span><br>
So, not only can you create clones, but you can also turn back time... Quite impressive. Might I ask what other abilities you have?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Akashi：</span><br>
Stopping time? Time travel? Teleportation? Projecting your consciousness?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Kurumi Tokisaki：</span><br>
Heehee. Who knows? You have quite the active imagination, Miss Akashi.<br>
<br>
Even though her answer is completely ambiguous, Akashi's eyes start to shimmer.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Akashi：</span><br>
This is the request of a lifetime, nya! Please partner with me, nya! We'll be able to embark on a business venture like no other, nya!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Belfast：</span><br>
Should we be able to apply this power to tactical exercises and logistics... Miss Tokisaki, should you be willing, I would like to discuss this again with you in a... calmer environment.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Akashi：</span><br>
I put in my request first, nya! I should be first in line for a partnership, nya! We can sign the contract right here and now, nya!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Kurumi Tokisaki：</span><br>
Heehee. Let's save these conversations for a later date– Aleph!<br>
<br>
Kurumi raises her gun to her own temple, her lips curling into an elegant but mysterious smile. She then pulls the trigger without any hesitation.<br>
Her figure is enveloped by a torrent of distorted time, and then vanishes completely.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Belfast：</span><br>
...Where did Miss Tokisaki go?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Akashi：</span><br>
Sh-she disappeared, nya?! What a shame... I had the best business idea ever, nya!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Laffey：</span><br>
Ehh... I wanted to ask her to make time stop... after I went to sleep...<br>
...Anyway, back to sleep. I'll ask... Kurumi again when I see her... zzz...<br>

<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Hanazuki：</span><br>
Since the botanical garden's watering system was upgraded, the plants have been watered more evenly than before, and the flowers even seem to be blooming more vibrantly.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">De Zeven Provinciën：</span><br>
Really? It appears Oleg has finally found a nice helper, and I'm sure the plants will be happy too♪<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Hanazuki：</span><br>
Heehee. You'd have to ask the plants themselves about that.<br>
<br>
Curiosity piqued, De Zeven Provinciën and Hanazuki head towards the botanical garden, only to find the flowers there on the verge of withering, a chilly aura hanging over them.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">De Zeven Provinciën：</span><br>
H-how did this happen?! The flowers are freezing to death... Was there some malfunction with the watering system?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Hanazuki：</span><br>
Where's Oleg? I need someone to tell me what's going on here first...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">???：</span><br>
Urgh...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">De Zeven Provinciën：</span><br>
Is someone there?<br>
<br>
In the corner of the garden is Yoshino, crouching and curled up into a little ball, a faint chill radiating from her entire body.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Hanazuki：</span><br>
...Are you okay?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Yoshino：</span><br>
*sniffle*... Yoshinon...went missing... I can't...control my Spiritual Power...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">De Zeven Provinciën：</span><br>
Yoshinon... That's the name of the rabbit friend you always keep with you, right?<br>
Calm down first. When did you notice that your friend went missing? Take as much time as you need.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Yoshino：</span><br>
Miss Oleg called me over...to use my Spiritual Power to help with the watering system...<br>
But suddenly, the equipment broke down... Oleg...went to fetch some parts...and that's about when Yoshinon went missing...<br>
Without Yoshinon, I... *sniffle*...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Hanazuki：</span><br>
Don't you worry. Zeven and I will help you find her! Umm... why don't we check the surveillance footage first?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">De Zeven Provinciën：</span><br>
Hold on. Did you see that? ...The moment when Oleg left.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Hanazuki：</span><br>
Yeah. It's a bit hard to tell with all the smoke and dust, but... There, tucked in Oleg's clothes...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Yoshino：</span><br>
...Yoshinon...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">De Zeven Provinciën：</span><br>
Well, that's a relief. Looks like Oleg took your friend by mistake.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Hanazuki：</span><br>
Let's go look for Oleg together, Yoshino. By the way, you also mentioned she was looking for parts, right?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Yoshino：</span><br>
Y-yes...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Hanazuki：</span><br>
That means she must've gone to the parts warehouse. Let's make our way over as well.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">De Zeven Provinciën：</span><br>
Indeed. Let's go pick Yoshinon up.<br>
<br>
When they open the door to the warehouse, the three of them find Oleg engrossed in her work, Yoshinon quietly resting in her arms.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Oleg：</span><br>
Yes, this model number should make perfect sense...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Yoshino：</span><br>
Yoshinon!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Oleg：</span><br>
Huh? You're here too, Yoshino? ...Oh, I'm so sorry! I was in such a rush that I accidentally grabbed your buddy here!<br>
Seriously, I feel really bad! You must've been worried sick, right?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Yoshino：</span><br>
It's okay...as long as Yoshinon is safe and sound...<br>
<br>
Yoshino hugs Yoshinon tightly, finally letting out a sigh of relief.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Yoshinon：</span><br>
Yoshinon has returned! Phew, what a thrilling adventure that was! But, I must say, resting in Oleg's arms was superbly comfortable...<br>
I wonder though... Yoshino, did ya keep yourself together while I was away?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Yoshino：</span><br>
...*sniffle*... Sorry...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Yoshinon：</span><br>
Now, now. Enough of that. More importantly, it looks like you've made some good friends.<br>
<br>
Yoshino looks up at Zeven and Hanazuki, then bows her head in embarrassment.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Yoshino：</span><br>
Umm... Thank you for looking for Yoshinon, and also...for looking after me.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Yoshinon：</span><br>
That's the ticket! Helping each other out – that's what friends are for!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Yoshino：</span><br>
Mhm... You're right...<br>
Thank you so much, everyone. I want to do something useful for you as well! I'll do my best to complete the watering system!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Oleg：</span><br>
Already picked up the replacement parts. Let's hurry on back, then!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">De Zeven Provinciën：</span><br>
Hehe. Our friends at the botanical garden must be eagerly waiting for our return as well.<br>
<br>
Yoshino calmly releases her Spiritual Power, a pale green light dissolving into the sprinkler system.<br>
A mist imbued with Spiritual Power falls evenly on the flowers, melting through the frost in an instant. The flowers not only regain their vitality, but even seem to bloom more vividly.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Hanazuki：</span><br>
What amazing technology... Is everything back to normal now? Rather, the plants look even better than they did before...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">De Zeven Provinciën：</span><br>
Almost all of them have started blossoming... Yoshino, you're truly amazing!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Yoshino：</span><br>
N-no way... Miss Oleg deserves the credit, if anything. Besides...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">De Zeven Provinciën：</span><br>
Besides?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Yoshino：</span><br>
Helping each other out... That's what friends are for...<br>

{{折叠面板|标题=Empathizing With Cats|选项=4|主框=1|样式=primary|展开=是}}
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Kaguya Yamai：</span><br>
Woahhh–– So this is what paradise is like!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Yuzuru Yamai：</span><br>
Affirmative. The signboard here says "cat petting area".<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Kaguya Yamai：</span><br>
Hmm, looks like we can walk right in? In that case, I'll be heading on in first!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Yuzuru Yamai：</span><br>
Disapproval. Sneaking ahead is not allowed.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Kaguya Yamai：</span><br>
W-wooow... What a fragile yet fluffy creature––<br>
M-more of them are approaching...?! D-do you all wish to become my familiars so badly?<br>
In exchange for your loyalty, I shall reward you with a "headpat"...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Kittens：</span><br>
Meow, meow~<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Kaguya Yamai：</span><br>
Nice kitties, nice kitties~ ...Wait, huh? Why does Yuzuru have more familiars than me?!<br>
*gasp*... No way! Don't tell me it's those dried fish you took from the cafeteria earlier...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Yuzuru Yamai：</span><br>
Affirmative. Planning in advance is a must.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Kaguya Yamai：</span><br>
H-how despicable, to resort to such tactics...!<br>
Ahh! Do you lot intend to betray me as well?!<br>
<br>
Seeing the kittens rush over to Yuzuru one after another, Kaguya is unable to contain her frustration.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Akashi：</span><br>
Now is the perfect time for an Akashi intervention, nya!<br>
Every cat's favorite treat stick, available now for 30% off, nya!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Kaguya Yamai：</span><br>
That's it! Gimme three, no, five!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Yuzuru Yamai：</span><br>
Request. I would like some too. Dried food supplies are almost depleted.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Akashi：</span><br>
Such generous customers, nya! You've purchased even more than the mysterious Client K who often frequents this place, nya!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Kaguya Yamai：</span><br>
The mysterious Client K...?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Yuzuru Yamai：</span><br>
Suspicion. K for Kaguya... Were you coming here secretly without informing me?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Kaguya Yamai：</span><br>
No, I swear, it's not me! There must be some other cat-lover whose name starts with K! Not that I have any clue who it might be!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Akashi：</span><br>
Thank you guys! If you ever need anything else, feel free to contact me, nya!<br>
<br>
Akashi hands the twins a bag of cat snack sticks, then casually leaves the scene.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Kaguya Yamai：</span><br>
Heh heh... We haven't had a contest for a while. How about it, Yuzuru?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Yuzuru Yamai：</span><br>
Agreement. A contest based on the number of kittens tamed?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Kaguya Yamai：</span><br>
That would be way too boring. So, let's go with this – whoever tames that jet-black beast first wins!<br>
It is the only entity that showed no reaction to either the fish or the snacks... a truly solitary and noble being!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Black Cat：</span><br>
Meow. (Glances towards Kaguya)<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Yuzuru Yamai：</span><br>
Identified. Kaguya is being looked at with contempt.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Kaguya Yamai：</span><br>
What?! You have some nerve, looking down on me like that!<br>
I'll make you bow down to me one way or another– Ah! Don't run away!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Black Cat：</span><br>
Mrreow... (Slightly grumpy)<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Yuzuru Yamai：</span><br>
Assertion. Attempting to be aggressive is the wrong approach. You should try to coax it with food first.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Black Cat：</span><br>
Meow. (Ignores Yuzuru).<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Cheshire：</span><br>
Hellooo, you two~ You know, that kind of stuff isn't going to make anyone happy~<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Yuzuru Yamai：</span><br>
Question. Who are you?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Kaguya Yamai：</span><br>
A very suspicious person has appeared...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Cheshire：</span><br>
What if I told you I can get that kitten to fall right into your lap?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Kaguya Yamai：</span><br>
Oh? How interesting. So, how do you do it?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Cheshire：</span><br>
If you want a cat to like you, the most important thing is empathy~<br>
In other words, you've gotta become a cat yourself! Here, I brought cat-eared headbands for the two of you. Why don't you try it on?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Yuzuru Yamai：</span><br>
Question. Will this really work?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Cheshire：</span><br>
It's an important part of learning how cats behave! Now then, try saying "meow"!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Kaguya Yamai：</span><br>
L-like this? Meeeow~<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Cheshire：</span><br>
Good, good! Now make a loose fist and shake it around in front of your chest♪<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Yuzuru Yamai：</span><br>
Imitation. Meow.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Cheshire：</span><br>
Yes, just like that! You look so cuuute... I mean, you look just like a cat♪<br>
Now then. Cats also have a habit of rubbing up against each other...<br>
Wow, yeah! Yuzuru's already got it even though I only showed you once! Amazing! Okay, how about this sound next? Purrrrrr...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Black Cat：</span><br>
Meeoww!!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Cheshire：</span><br>
Meoweow?! Why are you getting mad all of a sudden?!<br>
Well, that's all for today! I'll be heading out first––!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Kaguya Yamai：</span><br>
I have a feeling... that this "secret ritual" accomplished nothing at all...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Black Cat：</span><br>
Meow...<br>
<br>
The cat almost seems to let out an exasperated sigh, then trudges over and plops down between their feet.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Kaguya Yamai：</span><br>
Ah! It's getting attached to me! But, this outcome kind of feels...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Yuzuru Yamai：</span><br>
Agreement. Let's call it a draw.<br>

<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Soobrazitelny：</span><br>
Truly, a genius invention that will revolutionize our times... so why is nobody interested?!<br>
Ah, Yukikaze! What fortuitous timing! Come take a look at my latest invention!<br>
Behold, a costume that lets you change anywhere, anytime! I call it the Everchanger Mk. I!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Yukikaze：</span><br>
...It sounds a bit suspicious. Not the kind of stuff I'm interested in.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Soobrazitelny：</span><br>
No way! I thought that you, as a fellow genius, would be able to understand the greatness of my work!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Yukikaze：</span><br>
Genius, you say...?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Origami Tobiichi：</span><br>
I'm in full agreement. This is an undeniable breakthrough. A marvelous invention.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Yukikaze：</span><br>
Hwuh?! That was freaky... Just where did you come from anyway?!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Origami Tobiichi：</span><br>
I was simply passing by.<br>
I would like to learn more about your "Everchanger Mk. I", Soobrazitelny.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Soobrazitelny：</span><br>
Wah hah hah! You have quite the discerning eye, Origami!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Origami Tobiichi：</span><br>
I am simply providing the objective viewpoint from an "adult" perspective.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Soobrazitelny：</span><br>
(A-adult? What's that supposed to mean?)<br>
Ahem! In any case, let's continue this conversation in my workshop!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Yukikaze：</span><br>
Hmm... I must say, the mature and grown-up Yukikaze the Great's curiosity has been piqued!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Soobrazitelny：</span><br>
Ehehe, I knew it! As a fellow genius, I just knew you'd understand! Follow me!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Yukikaze：</span><br>
...Wait, hold on! Why are you making Yukikaze the Great change her clothes all of a sudden?!<br>
If you're going to show off your invention, shouldn't you be the one doing the demonstration?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Soobrazitelny：</span><br>
Unfortunately, it's a matter of size. It's difficult to adjust these things on the fly, so you're the only one who can be the demonstration model.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Yukikaze：</span><br>
I see, I see... Wait, how is that supposed to make sense?!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Soobrazitelny：</span><br>
Just button it up, and– tada! Take a look! A timeless invention from the genius mechanic, yours truly!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Yukikaze：</span><br>
But... isn't this... a bit heavy? I can't even lift my arms...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Origami Tobiichi：</span><br>
There's a hefty amount of metal inside, and yet the texture still feels like silk. Marvelous.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Soobrazitelny：</span><br>
Just as expected, Origami! You can tell with just a glance!<br>
The internal mechanisms are what allow the colors and patterns of this costume to be freely changed.<br>
Now then, Yukikaze. Please press the black button.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Yukikaze：</span><br>
This one? It just made a click.<br>
Woooah! It's suddenly getting longer!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Soobrazitelny：</span><br>
This one's a formal look, a favorite among spy movie enthusiasts. Pairs perfectly with sunglasses!<br>
What do you think, Origami?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Origami Tobiichi：</span><br>
Transformation took 3.47 seconds. Highly efficient, and well-suited for handling unexpected situations.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Yukikaze：</span><br>
(Handling unexpected situations? ...Wait, is she thinking of having it change forms to deal with enemies on the battlefield?)<br>
But this outfit is way too heavy. How are you supposed to move around in this...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Soobrazitelny：</span><br>
It's still a prototype. Functionality has to come first. I'll work on the comfort aspect later.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Origami Tobiichi：</span><br>
I have a question. Is it water-resistant?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Soobrazitelny：</span><br>
Perfectly so! It's completely waterproof and designed to withstand the elements. You can even wear it while swimming in the ocean!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Origami Tobiichi：</span><br>
Rating: Perfect. A truly ingenious design.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Yukikaze：</span><br>
(Waterproofing... Is this really about combat performance, though? Besides, we already have riggings. How would this be superior...?)<br>
So... how about the defensive capabilities? Especially compared to our shipgirl riggings.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Soobrazitelny：</span><br>
Who said anything about wearing this to a battlefield?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Yukikaze：</span><br>
Huh? What was all that talk about unexpected situations and waterproofing, then?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Soobrazitelny：</span><br>
Of course it's about regular work stuff, like around the workshop––<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Origami Tobiichi：</span><br>
Of course it's about going on a date––<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Yukikaze：</span><br>
......<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Soobrazitelny：</span><br>
Well, umm... I was more thinking, even if you get tired at work, you could just instantly change clothes and go to sleep...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Origami Tobiichi：</span><br>
While on a date, you would be able to change your outfit without disrupting the flow, keeping the mood right and moving onto the next phase.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Yukikaze：</span><br>
......<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Soobrazitelny：</span><br>
......<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Origami Tobiichi：</span><br>
......<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Yukikaze：</span><br>
Yukikaze the Great never should've listened to you in the first place!<br>
<br>
And so, Yukikaze runs off, red in the face and pouty.<br>

<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Tohka Yatogami：</span><br>
One more, please!!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Saratoga：</span><br>
Woah... the plates are stacked up so high, they're taller than a person! Umm, Tohka, are you sure you're not overeating?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Tohka Yatogami：</span><br>
Hrmm? Oh... is that so? I'm sorry. I seem to have inconvenienced you once again...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Saratoga：</span><br>
No, no, it's nothing that serious. I was just worried you might give yourself a tummyache. But, from the looks of it... maybe I'm overthinking things a bit?<br>
I'm just glad that you enjoy the menu here at our canteen!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Tohka Yatogami：</span><br>
Mmhm! There are so many dishes I've never seen before, and they're all so delicious!<br>
I've baked my own cookies before, but they never came out anywhere as good as these!<br>
Things would be so much more fun if I could cook this well.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Saratoga：</span><br>
So... Tohka, would you like to learn how to cook?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Lung Wu：</span><br>
...In other words, you're here on Saratoga's recommendation?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Tohka Yatogami：</span><br>
Yes ma'am! I'm looking forward to receiving your instruction, Master Lung Wu!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Lung Wu：</span><br>
M-master? ...Ahem. I see that you certainly have the right attitude.<br>
I can teach you to cook, but... You know the old adage: one step at a time.<br>
First, I'd like you to start with prepping the vegetables. Please cut them into the correct shapes.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Tohka Yatogami：</span><br>
Understood! Cutting things is my specialty!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Lung Wu：</span><br>
Y-yeah... I'm... glad you're motivated...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Tohka Yatogami：</span><br>
Master! I've done it!<br>
However... I used too much force, and the cutting board broke in two!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Lung Wu：</span><br>
That's okay... Beginners are bound to make mistakes, so just be careful with how much force you use next time.<br>
Next, I'll be showing you how to cook, so watch closely.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Tohka Yatogami：</span><br>
By the way, what will we be making?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Lung Wu：</span><br>
Steamed sea bass. It seems to be a dish that nobody can say no to.<br>
The prep work can be a bit tedious, but the actual steaming process is quite simple.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Tohka Yatogami：</span><br>
I see... So in order to become a good chef, both patience and carefulness are needed.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Lung Wu：</span><br>
If you already know that much, you're already at the threshold...<br>
Alright, feast your senses upon tonight's meal.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Tohka Yatogami：</span><br>
...Everything smells amazing!<br>
Mmh... Aah...!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Lung Wu：</span><br>
If you want it that badly, why not go ahead and give it a taste?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Tohka Yatogami：</span><br>
C-can I really?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Lung Wu：</span><br>
Part of a chef's duty is taste-testing the food before serving it.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Tohka Yatogami：</span><br>
I see! In that case, don't mind if I do!<br>
*nom*... Mmh... Mmmm! This one got a little kick to it, but it's so good! And, so aromatic as well! Master, what kind of dish is this?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Lung Wu：</span><br>
Chili chicken. Try the one next to it as well. It's one of my minor specialties.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Tohka Yatogami：</span><br>
This is... Woah! It's mapo tofu! I often see it served at supermarket counters!<br>
Mmh... But it's so much tastier than the stuff you buy outside!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Lung Wu：</span><br>
That is the charm of Empery cuisine.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Tohka Yatogami：</span><br>
And, you said this was only a "minor" specialty? Now I'm dying to find out what a "major" specialty tastes like...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Lung Wu：</span><br>
Well, if you put it that way... I suppose I can give you a special technical demonstration!<br>
...How's that?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Tohka Yatogami：</span><br>
Amazing! The taste bursts forth like bombshells! But, these are all everyday ingredients! Master, are you some sort of magician?!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Lung Wu：</span><br>
Heheh... I'm not done yet~<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Tohka Yatogami：</span><br>
S-seriously?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Lung Wu：</span><br>
As your master, allow me to reveal to you some of my secret techniques...<br>
<br>
In the evening, Saratoga quietly drops by the kitchen to check on Tohka.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Saratoga：</span><br>
Tohka, I came to see how you're doing~<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Tohka Yatogami：</span><br>
Ahh... I'm totally stuffed... I don't remember the last time I felt like this. This immense feeling of satisfaction... You're truly amazing, Master...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Lung Wu：</span><br>
Heheh... Keep up your efforts, Tohka, and I'm sure you'll reach my levels– No, maybe you'll even surpass me.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Saratoga：</span><br>
Umm... I guess... you could call this a successful cooking lesson?<br>
