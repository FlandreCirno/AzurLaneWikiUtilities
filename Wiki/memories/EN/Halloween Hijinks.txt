1 The Cat-Eared Imp<br>
.........<br>
While my mind was fuzzy from sleepiness, I felt something just as fuzzy against my cheek.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">???：</span><br>
Meeeow.<br>
<br>
I reached my hand out for the fuzzy, fluffy thing that appeared in my drowsy dream.<br>
But it had already fled from my fingertips...leaving naught behind but a cute "Meeeow."<br>
...Wait a second.<br>
That wasn't a dream, was it?!<br>
When I opened my eyes, I was surrounded by a bunch of pumpkins carved to have scary faces. It seemed I was in the port's Halloween party venue.<br>
The sandy beach could be seen in the distance. My friends' cheers mixed with the pounding of waves.<br>
It seemed I'd loosened up so much on this rare day off that I'd laid down and fallen asleep on a bench.<br>
But what had I just touched a moment ago?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Janus：</span><br>
M-mister Ghost, I'm sorry! I'm so very sorry!<br>
I'll be a good girl, I promise! Please don't abduct me!<br>
<br>
Mister...Ghost?<br>
I remembered the ghost costume I was wearing. Indeed, I'd dressed up as a ghost for Halloween.<br>
The costume didn't stop at clothes, either; I'd had a white mask prepared to go with it, so it was a quality costume.<br>
I couldn't blame her—Janus—for being genuinely afraid.<br>
<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项1：Take off the mask</span>'''''<br>
<br>
I'd feel bad scaring her any further, so I took off the mask and revealed my true identity.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Janus：</span><br>
C-Commander, it's you... Oh, you gave me a real fright.<br>
I know that monsters are never the real thing on Halloween, b-but I couldn't help myself...<br>
Especially at night...I imagine monsters popping out of the darkness... I'm so glad it was just you, Commander.<br>
<br>
"So you say, Janus, but you're dressed up like a Halloween monster, too."<br>
"Cat ears, bat wings... If you're not a vampire, I have no idea what monster you are."<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Janus：</span><br>
U-Umm... I'm a little kitty devil! I picked it out myself, but...i-is it weird, after all?<br>
Jervis told me to be careful since you'd be seeing me, so I wonder...<br>
<br>
"I honestly think you look cute in that costume, Janus."<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Janus：</span><br>
Phew... Thank you, Commander...<br>
Y-you were sleeping on this bench because you're so tired, right, Commander? You'll catch a cold out here. May I walk you to your room?<br>
<br>
"I just relaxed too much, is all. It's not as if I was too fatigued to stay awake..."<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Janus：</span><br>
I-is that so...? You're incredible, Commander, being able to sleep soundly at a Halloween party...<br>
<br>
"No point in sitting around here, right? Where are you off to next, Janus?"<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Janus：</span><br>
Oh, yeah! I'm supposed to be looking for a black kitty with a hat right now. Commander, have you... Oh. You were sleeping, so duh, you haven't seen it...<br>
<br>
"You know, I did feel something fuzzy. I think I heard its meows...that way."<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Janus：</span><br>
You know where the kitty went? Thank you so much for helping!<br>
<br>
I managed to tell her which way the cat ran and watched as Janus disappeared into the Halloween night.<br>
"I'll check on her later... Now, how should I enjoy this Halloween party?"<br>

<br>
2 Faerie Princess' Garden of Rest<br>
I faced the old castle, which exuded more awe-inspiring presence than ever on Halloween night.<br>
The cross at the tip of the tower almost seemed to emit its own light in the moonlight... What sort of being was within?<br>
I pushed the door open with that question in my mind.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Albion：</span><br>
A human intrudes on the sanctuary of the night's scion...<br>
Unwelcome mortal, for what reason do you disturb my eternal dreams?<br>
<br>
Sitting on the blood-red throne, Albion—wearing a costume akin to a succubus or vampire—welcomed me in.<br>
She's acting really different... How should I respond?<br>
<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项1："I like your costume, Albion."</span>'''''<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项2："'Tis I, a lowly servant of the night."</span>'''''<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Albion：</span><br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项1）</span>'''''Thank you, Commander... Ah! I mean! Umm...<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项1）</span>'''''Ack... How could I drop the act just from hearing my name? I'm sorry, this is so embarrassing...<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项1）</span>'''''My vampire elders said I could order you around in this costume, but it's still so hard...<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项1）</span>'''''Ah, but forget my act... Commander, if you'd please, erm...<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项1）</span>'''''Would you like to spend some time with me...?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Albion：</span><br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项2）</span>'''''Y-you don't have to try to play along like that...<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项2）</span>'''''But... Ahem. "Underling of Albion, do you desire to spend this delightful night with your master?"<br>
<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项2）</span>'''''"But of course."<br>
<br>
Albion handed me a glass. The crimson liquid within sparkled like ruby in the moonlight.<br>
"Is this...wine?"<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Albion：</span><br>
Not quite. It's grape juice colored to look like wine.<br>
I think the refreshing sweetness of it is perfect for a night like tonight.<br>
Umm, so, Comm—ahem. Underling of Albion, per our solemn vow to spend this delightful night together...<br>
W-well, this is all an act, so why don't you stay a little longer...<br>
Kneel, promise your loyalty, and then... Oh, never mind...<br>
Nothing! I said nothing! Please forget what you just heard!<br>

3 A Succubus' Love<br>
I left the Halloween castle and returned to the party venue.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Manchester：</span><br>
Welcome to Succubus Love, our hottest attraction! Even you can join in the bloody fun, Master Ghost!<br>
Oh, but keep the mask on! Take it off, and ya won't be ghastly anymore!<br>
<br>
"F-Fair, I guess..."<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Manchester：</span><br>
Wow... Your costume was so good that it scared Janus? Heheh, only on Halloween, eh?<br>
But it's okay! It'll take a lot more than that to scare me!<br>
Now, let's go in this room, lock the door, turn on the phone signal jammer... Heehee! Now nobody can interrupt us.<br>
Master-and-Commander, I welcome you anew to Manchester's special clinic, Succubus Love. Here, you can relieve all your tension until you feel sooo much better.<br>
<br>
She put a whole lot of effort into creating a situation where nobody could interrupt.<br>
An aromatherapeutic fragrance gradually filled the room...relaxing all of my tension before I knew it.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Manchester：</span><br>
Ah! Master, you look sleepy already. Are you okay?<br>
<br>
"...I think it's because of the aroma."<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Manchester：</span><br>
That's a right silly thing to say, innit. Come on, now.<br>
Your angel in white, Manchester, will make you feel all better!<br>
<br>
"Now that I'm getting a good look at your costume, I see little demon wings on your back."<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Manchester：</span><br>
I've got a demon tail, too! Ehehe, who says a succubus can't be a nurse, too?<br>
Well alright, lie down. We're gonna heal all of ya fatigue. Swallow this, and get ready for the full healing experience!<br>
Your succubus maid...no, your succubus nurse is gonna make ya feel better than ever!<br>
<br>
I've never seen her this excited. Is she just fully engrossed in the Halloween mood?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Manchester：</span><br>
Master, what are ya staring for?<br>
I know! Ya want me to help ya take it, eh?<br>
Aww, you're helpless... Okay. Open up! Say aah!<br>
<br>
As directed, I open my mouth and let Manchester put a small tablet in my mouth. It tastes like strawberry candy.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Manchester：</span><br>
Oh, I forgot to tell you! This isn't real medicine. It's just candy! Don't worry!<br>
Nooow, stay still in this bed, Master! It's time for Manchester's full healing massage experience!<br>
<br>
"Wait, you're actually doing this? It's not an act?"<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Manchester：</span><br>
Of course! I'm a royal maid, after all! Soothing my master is my forte, innit.<br>
Ehehe... You can't escape, so just relax and let me do all the work.<br>

<br>
4 The Witch of Hallow's Eve<br>
I arrived at a witch's fortune-telling shop.<br>
Witches might be "the" Halloween costume, but there were so many people in our port who fit that descriptor that I couldn't imagine who I'd find inside.<br>
"Guess I might as well just knock."<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Witch?：</span><br>
Enter, pilgrim of the night.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Memphis：</span><br>
What brings you here at such a late time? Are you a lost soul wandering through the Halloween night?<br>
Not surprised, huh? Got a problem with me being the Witch of Hallow's Eve?<br>
<br>
All I could make out in the smoke-filled shack were a crystal ball placed on a table and Memphis, clad in a witch costume.<br>
"I didn't know you could see the future, Memphis."<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Memphis：</span><br>
"It's not really... Uh, I mean, of course I can! I'm a witch, after all!"<br>
Lost pilgrim of the night, do you seek guidance toward your future? Or do you seek time with me?<br>
<br>
"Well..."<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Memphis：</span><br>
You need not answer. Come and sit. Place your hand on my crystal ball and reveal the future to me. I will predict your future.<br>
Oh... I see.<br>
There it is. If the crystal ball says so, then I have no choice but to accept it.<br>
<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项1："What did the crystal ball show you?"</span>'''''<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项2："Is it good or bad?"</span>'''''<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Memphis：</span><br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项1）</span>'''''It reveals a vision of you, Commander, spending Halloween night with a certain shipgirl.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Memphis：</span><br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项2）</span>'''''It's neither, really. Commander, the ball tells me that you'll spend the night with a certain shipgirl.<br>
<br>
"Which shipgirl...?"<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Memphis：</span><br>
Me, of course...is what I'd like to say. But unfortunately, it's not.<br>
<br>
"I thought your fortune-telling was just another Halloween attraction."<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Memphis：</span><br>
You're not wrong, but to be more precise, it's an attraction with a hint of reality.<br>
Here. Take this.<br>
<br>
Memphis handed me a witch's hat.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Memphis：</span><br>
Take a broom with you, too. It'll double as a self-defense weapon, which you might just need.<br>
<br>
"I don't understand. What the heck did you see in my future?"<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Memphis：</span><br>
The shipgirl you'll be with can be a little difficult. Trust me, you'll be better off with this.<br>
<br>
"A shipgirl you'd call 'difficult'? I can't tell if I know who you're talking about or not..."<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Memphis：</span><br>
I saw her just a while ago. Beats me how she snuck a real weapon into the party venue.<br>
<br>
"A real weapon...? If she got past the bag check with a weapon, then that's a real emergency. Did the Sirens do this?!"<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Memphis：</span><br>
You will need to check on her, but it's hardly an emergency. I wouldn't even call it dangerous. That pirate is just enjoying Halloween in her own way.<br>
<br>
"Pirate? A pirate shipgirl? That would be..."<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Memphis：</span><br>
Exactly. A pirate shipgirl wearing a red hat. I think you're just the man to deal with her, Commander.<br>
<br>
"I'm curious what happened. Instead of just wandering around, I'd better go confront her directly and confirm that she's the one I'm thinking of."<br>

5 An Uninvited Guest?<br>
On the beach near the Halloween party venue, I found a pirate girl wearing a red hat.<br>
When I addressed her...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">???：</span><br>
Shh.<br>
Do you hear the ocean's cries?<br>
<br>
"You mean the sound of waves hitting shore?"<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">???：</span><br>
Hmph. I said they're the ocean's cries! Geez!<br>
<br>
The pirate girl with the hat turned around and glared at me unhappily.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">???：</span><br>
Who are you?<br>
<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项1：(Play along)</span>'''''<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">???：</span><br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项1）</span>'''''Aha, I see. So you're the one that my friends here... Ahem. You're the one that these lasses call the Commander.<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项1）</span>'''''I am the mysterious, heartstopping shipgirl who rides wind and waves alike, searching all the seven seas for the beauties of the world...<br>

<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项1）</span>'''''"In that get-up, you don't really stand out at a Halloween party. And pirate swords kind of look like Halloween props..."<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Royal Fortune：</span><br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项1）</span>'''''Ah, well. This Halloween stuff is fun! But I'm the real thing, got it?! This ain't a costume!<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项1）</span>'''''So, I'm looking for treasure hidden in this venue. Wanna search with me, Commander?<br>
<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项1）</span>'''''"Huh? Wait, are you serious about that?"<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Royal Fortune：</span><br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项1）</span>'''''Of course! I'm Royal Fortune of the great Tempesta, after all!<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项1）</span>'''''But there are a lot of people here, so I probably won't do anything too crazy.<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项1）</span>'''''If you can't rest easy with me running around, then you'll just have to scour the venue with me!<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项1）</span>'''''You're a Commander, aren't ya? Shouldn't you be watching over the shipgirls anyway?<br>
<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项1）</span>'''''"...Well, I definitely can't leave you alone now. I've got no choice; I'll tag along for a little while."<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项1）</span>'''''"But I haven't heard about any treasure buried in the venue..."<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Royal Fortune：</span><br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项1）</span>'''''There's treasure! See?! It's written on this flyer!<br>
<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项1）</span>'''''I read the flyer, and indeed it said, "The first person to get the treasure gets free drinks for a week, nya!"<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Royal Fortune：</span><br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项1）</span>'''''As a pirate of the great Tempesta, I can't cast aside treasure lying before my very eyes!<br>

6 The Night of Tempesta's Coming<br>
Food Court<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Royal Fortune：</span><br>
What is this?! It's delicious! The port's foods are the best! No, better than the best!<br>
<br>
"Whenever the port has an event, each shipgirl faction ends up setting up their own food stalls."<br>
"The Halloween party is no exception, but...due to time and space constraints, I hear they couldn't scrape together anything big."<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Royal Fortune：</span><br>
Sausage, steak, barbecue galore! It's all meat, and you say this ain't big?!<br>
This is so much more luxurious than the port's usual food! And their food is already incredible!<br>
Hey, you! I want this, this, and that, and this!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Cleveland：</span><br>
Got it! This is all you wanted, right? Also, here's a freebie for the Commander!<br>
Wait, are you...<br>
<br>
It would be a pain to tell her everything about the costume and the real weapon, so I used my authority as Commander to get through the situation.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Cleveland：</span><br>
A-Ah, I see! Well, I hope you two enjoy the party!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Royal Fortune：</span><br>
Halt! I may not know your price, but I won't bilk on my bill!<br>
<br>
Royal Fortune took some gold coins from her pouch and slammed them onto the table.<br>
"Those are heavy... Could it be?!"<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Royal Fortune：</span><br>
Don't make light of us pirates! Even I obey the law, and I know the rules of society!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Oklahoma：</span><br>
Hold it right there, pirate shipgirl~!<br>
Let the Commander go at once!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Royal Fortune：</span><br>
What are ya going on about?! You're a pirate too, aren't you?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Oklahoma：</span><br>
Huh? Umm... This is just a Halloween costume. Ack! I mean, release the Commander at once!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Royal Fortune：</span><br>
How dare you?! The Commander is plundering with me, so he's mine! You can't have him!<br>
Who do ya think you are, running in out of nowhere and demanding him from me?!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Oklahoma：</span><br>
That's my line! Why do you get to monopolize him outta nowhere?! If you're plannin' somethin' untoward—<br>
<br>
Now Oklahoma's acting crazy too, all because of the real pirate, Royal Fortune!<br>
<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项1：Explain everything to calm them down</span>'''''<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项2：Wait and watch</span>'''''<br>
<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项1）</span>'''''I step forth to explain things before the situation can get worse.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Oklahoma：</span><br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项1）</span>'''''Oooh... So she wasn't takin' you captive? You're just enjoyin' the Halloween party?<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项1）</span>'''''It looked real to me. And when I found out she was a real pirate, I couldn't help myself... Commander, I'm real sorry!<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项1）</span>'''''And Royal Fortune, I'm sorry for what I did...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Royal Fortune：</span><br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项1）</span>'''''It's alright, friend! You were trying to protect your Commander, right? A captain needs crew like you!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Oklahoma：</span><br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项1）</span>'''''Thanks, I think? It's not much of an apology, but how would you like some pumpkin pie? I just got someone to teach me how to make it!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Royal Fortune：</span><br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项1）</span>'''''Nice! I'll take two, please!<br>
<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项1）</span>'''''With their quarrel resolved, I joined Oklahoma and Royal Fortune on a bench, and we ate pumpkin pie together.<br>

'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项1）</span>'''''Haah... Man, I'm full. I feel like I've had plenty of fun for a day, too...<br>

<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Royal Fortune：</span><br>

<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Oklahoma：</span><br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项1）</span>'''''Ahahaha... What does it mean for a shipgirl to be another shipgirl's first mate?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Royal Fortune：</span><br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项1）</span>'''''Good question... Guess you shipgirls already have the Commander, anyways...<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项1）</span>'''''Hm? Wow, it's already about time to hoist the sails, eh? But I still haven't found that treasure...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Royal Fortune：</span><br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项2）</span>'''''Haah, haah, you're not bad... I'm at a disadvantage in this fight. Time to scram!<br>

<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Royal Fortune：</span><br>

<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项2）</span>'''''Royal Fortune dragged me off to a place with nobody around.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Royal Fortune：</span><br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项2）</span>'''''Heheheh. Commander, we're all alone again...<br>
<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项2）</span>'''''"Maybe, but after you showed off that real weapon, I'm sure the others will come running soon..."<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Royal Fortune：</span><br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项2）</span>'''''That's a scary thought, yeah...<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项2）</span>'''''But it's okay! It's already about time for me to set sail!<br>
<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项2）</span>'''''"Come to think of it, Royal Fortune, weren't you searching for some treasure?"<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Royal Fortune：</span><br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项2）</span>'''''It's okay! I may not have found the treasure itself, but I've memorized the place!<br>
<br>
"What do you mean by 'that time'?"<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Royal Fortune：</span><br>
Hmm, it's a promise between pirates, so I have no other choice!<br>
<br>
"I think I've figured out what's going on. If you have plans with your friends, I won't stop you."<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Royal Fortune：</span><br>
But don't you worry! We'll have plenty of chances to see each other! Our date can wait until next time, Commander!<br>
Mm, I said next time, but when will that be...? Tomorrow, maybe?<br>
Ah, forget it! I'm not gonna worry now! The great Tempesta rolls in, rampages, and scrams just like a tempest!<br>
But be prepared! Next time, it won't just be me; I'll be back with greater numbers!<br>
<br>
"Sounds chaotic, but a tempest sounds fun once in a while."<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Royal Fortune：</span><br>
There you go! You'd better prepare lots of good food for us while you have the chance!<br>
I may not be much of a fighter, but I can feast like no other!<br>
<br>
"I can't wait."<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Royal Fortune：</span><br>
That's the spirit! Wait for us with breath bated and table set! That's a promise between you and me, Commander!<br>
Now, it's time for a tactical withdrawal! 'Til we meet again, Commander!<br>
<br>
We said our goodbyes, and the shipgirl of Tempesta, Royal Fortune, disappeared again into the Halloween night.<br>
Lighthearted and sincere, and despite her history as a pirate, she adheres to laws and promises made.<br>
She may be lacking in common sense, but she's another treasured friend.<br>
Looking forward to our future banquet, I returned to the party to spend the rest of the night with the others.<br>
