Port - Research Department<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Yumia Liessfeldt：</span><br>
Normally, you'd decide what you're going to synthesize and then pick materials based on the recipe...<br>
But this is a new world, so I think it'll be more productive to analyze the composition of each material and derive the effects they'll lead to from there.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Oleg：</span><br>
Ooh! So basically, we try whatever we want and see what blows up!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ingraham：</span><br>
Will any material work?<br>
There are still some that we don't know the internal composition of.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Yumia Liessfeldt：</span><br>
That's okay! I want to take a good look at everything first.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ingraham：</span><br>
Then it sounds like we want to start by screening our materials.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Oleg：</span><br>
Great idea! The port's sure to have all kinds of materials that Yumia's never seen before!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Yumia Liessfeldt：</span><br>
Fascinating... I can't wait!<br>
<br>
Port - Warehouse<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Oleg：</span><br>
Okay, I brought all kinds of stuff. Check it out!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Yumia Liessfeldt：</span><br>
Wow...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ingraham：</span><br>
Gunpowder, electrical system batteries... Hey, what kind of fuel is in this jerrycan?<br>
A triple gun mount missing two of its guns... and a plushie covered in soot? This is all just junk.<br>
Weren't we looking for materials?<br>
And a Wisdom Cube... Well, that one's fair.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Yumia Liessfeldt：</span><br>
This is a treasure trove to alchemists!<br>
Thank you for gathering all of this for me. I can already think of a ton of things I want to try!<br>
<br>
Thus, Yumia analyzed the materials and got to synthesizing.<br>
Shortly after...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Yumia Liessfeldt：</span><br>
Hmm... This isn't exactly what I was going for.<br>
What use does it even have, you think?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Oleg：</span><br>
Well, well. So alchemy can turn things into inexplicable messes, too.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Yumia Liessfeldt：</span><br>
This is like every day for us. We fail over and over, but it's all worth it when we finally succeed in the end.<br>
Let's keep up our momentum and get to the next trial!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Akashi：</span><br>
Heheheh... This is my lucky day, nya!<br>
If nobody wants it, then let Akashi make GOOD use of it, nya!<br>
Nyahahahaha...<br>
<br>
Shortly after...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Yumia Liessfeldt：</span><br>
Phew... I've finally done it. It took a whole lot of trial and error, ESPECIALLY errors, but I think I made some useful things.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Oleg：</span><br>
I learned a lot, too! I feel like my head is just buzzing with new ideas!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Yuubari：</span><br>
E-emergency, emergency!<br>
Akashi's contraption is out of control... Aaaaaah!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Akashi：</span><br>
Stop, stop, stop, stop, nyaaaaaa!<br>
Ever since I put that thing I found on it, it stopped listening to me, nyaaa!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Yumia Liessfeldt：</span><br>
Wait a minute... Oh, no! My first failed synthesis is missing!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Oleg：</span><br>
Damn it, Akashi!<br>
You put that thing on your machine when you didn't even know what it was?!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Akashi：</span><br>
J-just help me out, nya!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Yumia Liessfeldt：</span><br>
Oleg, I need your mechanical lobster for a moment!<br>
Now we take this, give it a little bit of THIS, and...<br>
<br>
KABOOOOM!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Akashi：</span><br>
Hurglblurf...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Yumia Liessfeldt：</span><br>
I-is everyone okay? Any injuries?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Yuubari：</span><br>
Don't worry. Everybody's fine... Even Akashi.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Oleg：</span><br>
Is that how you alchemists fight? Who knew my mechanical lobster could do all that?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Yumia Liessfeldt：</span><br>
Things don't always work out, and I'm still not used to alchemy in this world... I didn't mean to make it explode.<br>
I'm sorry...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Oleg：</span><br>
Oh! That thing was always bound to explode. Don't even worry about it.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Yumia Liessfeldt：</span><br>
I... see?<br>
Um... Akashi, was it? May I say something?<br>
Just like the machines you have here, alchemy can be dangerous if not handled carefully.<br>
If you'd like, you can learn alongside me... with experimentation and research.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Akashi：</span><br>
Yeah! I'd love to, nya!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Yumia Liessfeldt：</span><br>
Then let's clean this place up and look for materials we can use, okay?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Akashi：</span><br>
Yes, boss, nya!<br>
<br>
With that, a new round of experiments and synthesis would begin.<br>

<br>
Port - Dormitory<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Isla von Duerer：</span><br>
You know, I love how everyone of the Le Fantasque class dresses. They're all so cool and stylish!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Watarase：</span><br>
It must be their Iris heritage. I agree, many of them dress very cool.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Isla von Duerer：</span><br>
Your outfit is pretty, too! Is that Sakuran style? It's exquisite and beautiful at the same time...<br>
Same for the Dragon Empery girls' clothes! Those refined designs clearly have a lot of history behind them.<br>
And the Royal Navy's elegant dresses...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Watarase：</span><br>
You're really a fan of fashion, aren't you?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Isla von Duerer：</span><br>
Yeah! Different regions all have their own unique fashion in my world, too.<br>
Just one pattern can have so much meaning behind it!<br>
What could be more interesting than that?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Dunkerque：</span><br>
It's great that you have an interest in fashion.<br>
The more things you can talk about, the easier it is to get along with people in other factions.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Isla von Duerer：</span><br>
True!<br>
Now I'm getting even more interested...<br>
Hey, you don't think I could go around the dorms and ask to see people's wardrobes, do you?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Dunkerque：</span><br>
I don't see why not. I was already planning to show you around the port, so this is the perfect excuse.<br>
<br>
Port - Northern Parliament Dorm<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Kirov：</span><br>
You want to know about the Northern Parliament's fashion?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Chapayev：</span><br>
You have a good eye, Isla!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Isla von Duerer：</span><br>
So your outfits use white as a base, with more detailed designs to accentuate it... Is that a way of incorporating local color? Snow, maybe?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Kirov：</span><br>
Exactly right. The long, harsh winters shaped our civilization. You could say that snow itself is a cultural symbol of the Northern Parliament.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Chapayev：</span><br>
Heehee, I have plenty of outfits in my closet. Would you like to try a few on?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Isla von Duerer：</span><br>
I'd LOVE to!<br>
<br>
Port - Royal Navy Dorm<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Victorious：</span><br>
Aha! Speaking of which, I have a brilliant idea!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Isla von Duerer：</span><br>
Why do I suddenly have a bad feeling about this?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Victorious：</span><br>
Excuse you! I just wanted to suggest building your own fashion brand. What's so wrong with that?<br>
I'll be your beautiful designer, of course. It's almost too good to be true. Good for you!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Isla von Duerer：</span><br>
Whoa, whoa. This is way too sudden!<br>
<br>
Port - Iris Dorm<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Isla von Duerer：</span><br>
Excuse me?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Mogador：</span><br>
Heheh... Welcome to the Iris dorm. Is there anything I can... help you with?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Dunkerque：</span><br>
We're showing Isla around the port and letting her get a glimpse of each faction's fashion tastes.<br>
Are you the only one here right now?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Mogador：</span><br>
Yep, juuust meee.<br>
You wanna know about what we wear? Leave it all to me, Isla!<br>
For example, what I'm wearing right now. This is the ultimate pinnacle of practical clothing... Like what you see?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Dunkerque：</span><br>
......<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Watarase：</span><br>
.........<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Isla von Duerer：</span><br>
Umm... Can you even call that clothing?<br>
<br>
Port - Sardegna Dorm<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Raffaello：</span><br>
Welcome, welcome! I've been waiting for you!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Isla von Duerer：</span><br>
Huh? Did you know I was coming?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Raffaello：</span><br>
You're checking out the different faction designs, yeah?<br>
Design is an art, and no discussion of art is complete without Sardegna!<br>
Which means you were bound to come here sooner or later!<br>
Now, let's get painting!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Isla von Duerer：</span><br>
Wait...<br>
Why do I have to be the model?!<br>

<br>
Port - Training Grounds<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Nina Friede：</span><br>
Ooh... There are so many girls just like Lenja here.<br>
Their ears twitch adorably, their tails are fluffy... Heehee, how lovable.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ark Royal：</span><br>
I get you. It's just so damn hard to stop yourself from running over and giving them a big hug while they're training their hardest.<br>
The destroyers need someone to protect them, and that someone's going to be ME...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Nina Friede：</span><br>
Oh? You must be Ark Royal, I presume?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ark Royal：</span><br>
Yeah. Nina, was it? Are you watching the destroyers train, too?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Nina Friede：</span><br>
Huh? You mean those wonderfully fluffy tails...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ark Royal：</span><br>
Yeah! Heh... You'd be a great drinking mate, I bet.<br>
What do you say? After training, I'll show you the best parts of the port. Then we'll have a nice chat over drinks in the evening.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Nina Friede：</span><br>
The best parts, hmm? That sounds lovely.<br>
<br>
Port - Sakura Empire Dorm Courtyard<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ark Royal：</span><br>
Our tour begins here!<br>
This is where the Sakuran girls gather... ESPECIALLY the destroyers.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Nina Friede：</span><br>
Are those the girls with fluffy ears and tails?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ark Royal：</span><br>
Exactly! But the thing is... I don't see anyone today.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Nina Friede：</span><br>
Oh! H-hey, Ark Royal, who are those two?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ark Royal：</span><br>
Let's see... Tch! Akagi and Kaga!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Nina Friede：</span><br>
What beautiful tails!<br>
Do you think they'll let me touch them? They're so glossy and soft-looking...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ark Royal：</span><br>
Absolutely not! We gotta get outta here!<br>
Ahem. I mean, let's try somewhere else!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Nina Friede：</span><br>
Huh...?<br>
<br>
Academy - Field<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ark Royal：</span><br>
Phew... As you can see, this is the port's playing field.<br>
Every faction's destroyers love to come here, too.<br>
Normally, at this time of day... Hmm? It's quieter than usual.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Nina Friede：</span><br>
That's not true. See? There are a few over there.<br>
Oh, my... Who's that girl with the bouncy cat ears running all around?<br>
And why does she have cat ears but no cat tail?<br>
Same with the bunny-eared girl there. Wow, the port's diversity never ceases to amaze me.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ark Royal：</span><br>
Agreed! They must be... Cheshire and Benson?<br>
Right, those ears are just hairbands.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Nina Friede：</span><br>
O-oh, I see... Mere accessories. But they look just like the real thing.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ark Royal：</span><br>
Sure do. But why are heavy cruisers here right now?<br>
Well, it doesn't matter. Come – I saved my personal favorite for last!<br>
<br>
Commercial Street - Hot Spring<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Sign：</span><br>
"Sorry, nya. The hot springs are currently closed for maintenance, nya!"<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ark Royal：</span><br>
Argh... I'm sorry. I really wanted you to experience the port's beautiful hot spring.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Nina Friede：</span><br>
Don't worry yourself.<br>
You've done so much for me today. It's time I introduce you to one of OUR world's most adorable girls.<br>
Our Lenja is a Welleks, and my goodness, she's just so fluffy and cute that I could die!<br>
She lets me touch her hair sometimes... And when she does, the whole day just seems to get fluffed away before I know it.<br>
Give it a try, if she'll let you!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ark Royal：</span><br>
Come to think of it, she became a destroyer here, didn't she? Heheheh...<br>
Whoops. Let's not just stand here. I promised I'd buy you drinks, didn't I?<br>
Don't be shy. Today, you drink on my dime.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Nina Friede：</span><br>
I think I'll take you up on that.<br>
<br>
Indeed, Ark Royal and Nina's day of beautiful experiences was far from over.<br>

<br>
Port - Dormitory<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Lenja：</span><br>
Eep! Wh-why did I just feel a chill?<br>
My hackles are raised...<br>
Something's coming! I need to run!<br>
<br>
Port - Park<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Lenja：</span><br>
*pant*... *pant*...<br>
Phew... Plenty of shadows here.<br>
This should be a good place to hide...<br>
Coming in...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Leipzig：</span><br>
Umm... Who's there?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Lenja：</span><br>
Eep! S-sorry...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Torricelli：</span><br>
Hehe, hehehehe... Hehehe... Ehhh... That scared me...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Leipzig：</span><br>
A-another?!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Lenja：</span><br>
Huh?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Torricelli：</span><br>
Huh?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Leipzig：</span><br>
Huh?<br>
<br>
One commotion later...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Lenja：</span><br>
So as I'm understanding it, Leipzig didn't realize that Torricelli was here?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Leipzig：</span><br>
Y-yeah... I had no idea...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Torricelli：</span><br>
Hehehe... Neither did I. I was keeping quietly to myself... all on my own...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Lenja：</span><br>
E-excuse me! Am I intruding at all?<br>
Should I find somewhere else to hide, or...?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Leipzig：</span><br>
N-no, I don't think so!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Lenja：</span><br>
Thank goodness...<br>
Okay, I hope you don't mind me hiding here for a while. Something, I don't know what, seems to be chasing me...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Leipzig：</span><br>
Eek! Why is an enemy here in our port? We need to report this to the Commander...!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Lenja：</span><br>
Oh, no... I don't think it's an enemy. But something more... personally life-threatening?<br>
But I think I'll be okay if I can just hide for a while. Hopefully...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Torricelli：</span><br>
Hehe, hehehe... You're a destroyer here, aren't you...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Lenja：</span><br>
That should be what my rigging is, yes. Why do you ask?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Torricelli：</span><br>
Hehehehe... It's nothing, nothing...<br>
<br>
A while later...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Lenja：</span><br>
We're in the shade, but it's unusually warm here...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Leipzig：</span><br>
Is it because the trees are blocking the wind, too...? I feel... really sleepy out of nowhere...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Torricelli：</span><br>
Zzzzz...<br>
<br>
Even later...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Yumia Liessfeldt：</span><br>
Ah! I found her!<br>
There are two other girls here, too. They're all sound asleep in the shade.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Nina Friede：</span><br>
Phew... I'm just glad she's safe.<br>
Aww, let me give her a big hug!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Isla von Duerer：</span><br>
Please don't. She's sleeping so soundly, so let her be for a while.<br>
Good night, sleeping beauties.<br>
