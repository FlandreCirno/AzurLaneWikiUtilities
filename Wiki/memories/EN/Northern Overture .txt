Don't you think snow is such a strange thing?<br>
The snow may melt, and it may freeze. It may become soft, like flowing water, or hard, like adamant ice.<br>
But no matter what form it takes...<br>
Its very essence does not change. <br>
Our sacred ideals have always persisted, a bastion of power within the frigid seas.<br>
Once, there was a time where we fought alongside the rest of the world to push back the Siren threat for the sake of humanity.<br>
But as the war ground to a halt, massive Siren structures resembling icebergs began to form in our waters.<br>
As our forces were stretched thin to deal with these threats, we drifted apart from Azur Lane.<br>
War-torn, weary, and unable to join in the operations of Azur Lane, our name would soon be associated with these words...<br>
"The Northern Parliament's fleet is weak."<br>
...That is what the world came to believe.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">？？？：</span><br>
Has the battle finally begun...?<br>
Ahahaha! I can't contain my excitement any longer!<br>
In any case... Well, I hope that commander can make things worth our while.<br>
Hehe~ I'm looking forward to meeting that person~<br>
My lovely кролик is excited too.<br>
Hehe, it's great to see everyone in high spirits, but first, you all have some work to first take care of in the North.<br>
Until then, let us handle the hospitality! Isn't that right, Avrora?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Avrora：</span><br>
Haha, you're in a pretty good mood too, Pamiat.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Pamiat Merkuria：</span><br>
Of course I am! I'm all fired up too! Anyway, let's get going~!<br>

<br>
As the fleet approached the Aleutian defense line, the clouds which had blocked the skies for months suddenly parted, the water shimmering under the sun's bright glow.<br>
According to the Naval Headquarters, the clement weather would only last for a few short hours, but from our perspective, it was as if the Bering Sea was welcoming us.<br>
Hopefully, this upcoming battle would go as smoothly as planned... but the temperature was dropping sharply as we sailed north...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Saratoga：</span><br>
Heyy~ Commander, you're wide open~!!<br>
<br>
Suddenly, several planes darted past my ship, blasting the deck with frigid air and a spray of sea water.<br>
I didn't even need to guess to figure out what happened. It was another one of Saratoga's pranks...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Saratoga：</span><br>
Commander, now's not the time to be spacing out! We're about to head into battle, you know? There's a massive Siren stronghold waiting for us just ahead!<br>
<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项1：「I heard that this stronghold never launches any attacks, so we should be fine for now.」</span>'''''<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项2：「It's because I trust you to keep me safe no matter what happens.」</span>'''''<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项3：I couldn't help but to appreciate how serene the seas looked...</span>'''''<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Saratoga：</span><br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项1）</span>'''''Hmph! You know what they say, the calmer things appear on the outside, the bigger the conspiracy within!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Saratoga：</span><br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项2）</span>'''''Hmph! Your sweet talking won't get you anywhere with Sister Sara!！<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Saratoga：</span><br>
Silly Commander... There's no way the Sirens wouldn't have detected us at this point. Since you're in charge of this fleet, you should remain vigilant at all times!<br>
But, this is a bit unusual. We're practically knocking at their front door...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Hornet：</span><br>
Looks like we got a good tip from the Northern Parliament. This Siren hideout *is* a good target~!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">South Dakota：</span><br>
After what happened at NY Harbor, the Naval HQ now prioritizes eradicating small and medium-scale Siren bases within its jurisdiction.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Hornet：</span><br>
Heh. After the misery they put us through, it's only fair for us to return the favor by crashing their party.<br>
<br>
The next step of our major operation will be stalled until we can further reduce the Sirens' ability to project power across the seas.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Saratoga：</span><br>
We can't change the past. There are still many of us who are frustrated about what happened back then... So what we need now is to score an inspiring victory!<br>
But what I did not expect... is that the Northern Parliament would ask us to conduct a joint operation.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Hornet：</span><br>
The situation out here seems stable, and this Siren stronghold doesn't seem particularly threatening... so why hasn't the Northern Parliament taken this objective for themselves? Makes you wonder...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Saratoga：</span><br>
I was wondering about that too, so Sister Sara carried out a little investigation. Turns out... this place isn't as stable as you might think.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">South Dakota：</span><br>
What do you mean?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Saratoga：</span><br>
This area actually falls under the jurisdictions of both the San Diego Naval HQ and the Karaginsky Naval Command. As such, it would be too sensitive to conduct any operation unilaterally.<br>
Furthermore, based upon the records of joint operations conducted in the past, neither side has been particularly keen on deploying a main fleet to an area of such low strategic interest.<br>
And since the Sirens never launched any attacks from this location, talks about conducting an operation here didn't amount to anything...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Hornet：</span><br>
That makes sense... But right now, we can't afford to overlook any potential Siren threats, no matter how small they might seem!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Saratoga：</span><br>
That's why we're here right now~ Well, us, and a few others. Cleveland's group left a while before us, and we haven't heard from the Northern Parliament fleet in a while.<br>
Commander, we must seize victory here!<br>

<br>
After sailing a bit further, the fleet reached the naval base at the Aleutian defense line.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Avrora：</span><br>
Commander, and my friends from the Eagle Union, welcome to the Aleutian defense line.<br>
<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项1：Avrora?</span>'''''<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Avrora：</span><br>
ЗДравствуйте, Commander. It's been a while~<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Saratoga：</span><br>
Huh? Avrora? Weren't you in charge of securing aid and supplies between the Royal Navy?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Avrora：</span><br>
Hehe, I assume that this is your first time visiting the Northern Parliament. I thought it'd be appropriate for me to greet you here.<br>
After all, I will be supporting your forces in the upcoming operation.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Hornet：</span><br>
Ahaha! We're going to need all the good help we can get for a large operation like this!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Avrora：</span><br>
That's right~ Now, I'd like to introduce Pamiat Merkuria, one of the fellow members of the Northern Parliament.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Pamiat Merkuria：</span><br>
This is my first time meeting all of you, right? I'm the light cruiser, Pamiat Merkuria. Nice to meet you~!<br>
Huh? Oooh~ So you're the legendary commander who led the defense of NY Harbor? Mmm~ hmm~ Not bad, not bad.<br>
I heard that last time, you were viciously attacked as soon as you arrived at port and didn't even have a chance to catch a breath. How awful of them, hehe~<br>
But don't worry, that won't happen here. That snowy stronghold over there won't attack until we get within a certain distance, so there's no chance of them launching an offensive here.<br>
<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项1：How can you be sure that they won't take the initiative?</span>'''''<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项2：Has the stronghold been here for a while?</span>'''''<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Avrora：</span><br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项1）</span>'''''Well, we've never observed any attacks from the stronghold outside of a certain range. That's why it's largely been overlooked as a low-threat target.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Avrora：</span><br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项2）</span>'''''As long as I can remember. It appeared shortly after the end of that war, and has remained here since then.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Avrora：</span><br>
Even though we've tried our hand at attacking it in the past, we've never been able to spare enough forces to actually make a dent. Regrettably, we are quite ashamed about how little progress we've been able to make...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Saratoga：</span><br>
Don't worry about it! See, you have backup now~!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Cleveland：</span><br>
Yo, Commander! I'm glad you finally made it. I've been getting bored!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Montpelier：</span><br>
Slowpokes...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Columbia：</span><br>
I've gotta say, the view here is pretty nice. A bit cold for my tastes though, hehe~<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Saratoga：</span><br>
Oops, sorry about that~ You see, this commander was spacing out on the way here!<br>
<br>
Eh...? It's my fault?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Avrora：</span><br>
Haha... Seeing as how everyone is here, why don't we discuss the battle plan?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Hornet：</span><br>
Umm... Are you two the only ones here from the Northern Parliament?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Pamiat Merkuria：</span><br>
Ahaha... It's a bit embarrassing to admit, but the others are still tied up by some unfinished business in the Arctics...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Avrora：</span><br>
Since the stronghold won't initiate any external attacks, we'll join you for the first phase of this operation.<br>
Our other comrades will link up with us after they get here.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">South Dakota：</span><br>
You know... nothing creeps me out more than when the Sirens are sitting there *not* doing anything...<br>
{{折叠面板|内容结束}}

<span style="color:#4eb24e;">South Dakota：</span><br>
...It's too quiet. There's nothing wrong with my SK-2 radar... but undeniably, the enemy stronghold is right in front of us. Seeing a battlefield this calm is giving me goosebumps...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Pamiat Merkuria：</span><br>
We're still at a safe distance for the time being~<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Saratoga：</span><br>
Woah... these Sirens must be sleeping or something. My recon planes are flying over them without drawing a response...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Hornet：</span><br>
Hehe~ If that's the case, let's settle this with some ultra long-range bombing!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Avrora：</span><br>
Long-range attacks from carriers, huh... We've never tried something like that before.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Saratoga：</span><br>
Nice thinking, Hornet! But thinking isn't as fun as doing! Sister Sara, scrambling bombers!<br>
<br>
Saratoga issued her orders, and a squadron of bombers immediately began to fly towards the Siren stronghold.<br>
Even without protection from fighters, the bombers reached their target successfully and dropped a payload directly on top of the stronghold!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Saratoga：</span><br>
Heheh! A direct hit!!<br>
<br>
Just as Saratoga began to cheer, the stronghold's defenses came to life. The bombs that had been dropped were repelled by shields that materialized out of nowhere, and Saratoga's bombers were mercilessly mowed down by withering anti-air fire.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Saratoga：</span><br>
What... the... heck?!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">South Dakota：</span><br>
The target is responding to threats accordingly. The stronghold's anti-air capacities are stronger than expected. We can't even begin to speculate what their full capabilities might be.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Hornet：</span><br>
Good, I was afraid things would be too boring! Let's kick down their front door, smash through that carapace, and tear down their defenses!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Pamiat Merkuria：</span><br>
Be careful, everyone! We're about to enter their defensive perimeter!<br>

<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Columbia：</span><br>
The enemy's response has stopped for now, so we can catch our breath now~<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">South Dakota：</span><br>
You were right... As soon as we entered their range, all those dormant enemy suddenly started charging on us. I've never seen anything like it before...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Hornet：</span><br>
Eh? Is it over already? I haven't even finished warming up yet! How were they able to push you back so many times before with such a puny amount of firepower?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Pamiat Merkuria：</span><br>
Ahaha... The closer you get, the stronger their defenses. Consider what we just saw the appetizers.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">South Dakota：</span><br>
...Attrition warfare? If we take control of all the surrounding territory, all the defenses in the world aren't going to do them any good... What a pointless strategy.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Avrora：</span><br>
Indeed, but it's hard to know what the Sirens are thinking. What we do know is that we were met with an overwhelming defense the last time we tried to make a push.<br>
After that, we realized that the strength of the Northern Parliament alone would not be enough to tackle this issue. That's why we reached out to the Eagle Union.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">South Dakota：</span><br>
In other words, your excursions so far have only revealed the tip of the iceberg?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Pamiat Merkuria：</span><br>
That's the gist of it. We weren't able to draw out the full power of the Siren stronghold in the first place.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Hornet：</span><br>
Well, everything should be fine now that we're here. The commander's no slouch when it comes to mustering up the firepower we need.<br>
<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项1：We'll be prepared for anything they throw at us.</span>'''''<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Hornet：</span><br>
Now that's what I want to hear!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Cleveland：</span><br>
Let's do this! No matter how strong their defenses are, all we have to do is keep beating them back!<br>
{{折叠面板|内容结束}}

<br>
The Eagle Union task force is steadily making its way towards the Siren stronghold.<br>
Though the Sirens' counterattacks slowly grow stronger, they still pose no actual threat to the Eagle Union's ships.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Pamiat Merkuria：</span><br>
Wow, we've made some astonishing progress. When we first decided to investigate the stronghold, we never got *this* close.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">South Dakota：</span><br>
I'm guessing that's because the Sirens here are considerably tougher to deal with.<br>
But we still have the upper hand when it comes to firepower and durability. Let our fleet handle things from here on out.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Pamiat Merkuria：</span><br>
Ooh, do I hear an offer to clear the path for us?<br>
Because if so, I'll gladly take it! My gear's from a bygone time, so I'd struggle to keep up anyway~<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Avrora：</span><br>
We really appreciate your assistance. The rest of our forces seem to always be busy with some other mission...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Saratoga：</span><br>
No need to thank us. You've got Sirens on your doorstep to deal with, so if anything we should be thanking you for coming with us.<br>
Your number one priority is to take care of the Singularity. We know that too, of course.<br>
<br>
For decades, the Northern Parliament has been engaged in a battle with the Sirens over the Bering Sea.<br>
They may have experience, but their supplies are dwindling, and apparently they need support from other factions to hold the line...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Avrora：</span><br>
Now if you don't mind, I shall join the Commander's convoy. Vanguard fleet, please be on your guards.<br>

<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Columbia：</span><br>
Hey, you know what that thing is? The purple glowing one?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Montpelier：</span><br>
Nope. I've never seen any intel on anything like that before.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Saratoga：</span><br>
What is that, Avrora...?<br>
Is it some sort of undiscovered Northern Parliament wildlife?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Avrora：</span><br>
I don't... believe so, no...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Pamiat Merkuria：</span><br>
Did you forget your glasses at home? That's obviously a Siren!<br>
...Wait, let me guess, you were being sarcastic?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">South Dakota：</span><br>
The Sirens must've kept this secret weapon in their stronghold... Be careful, everyone! We don't know what to expect!<br>
{{折叠面板|内容结束}}

<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Columbia：</span><br>
That looks like the last of them. Good job, folks!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Hornet：</span><br>
Heheh! We sent them crawling back to mama!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Avrora：</span><br>
You never cease to amaze me, Eagle Union.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">South Dakota：</span><br>
This new enemy was tough, but nothing we can't handle.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Cleveland：</span><br>
"New" might not be the right word, you know? They might've kept it in store for decades for all we know...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">South Dakota：</span><br>
Maybe. But in any case, its combat ability is nothing to scoff at. If many more of them show up, this could get difficult.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Saratoga：</span><br>
If more show up, we'll just take them all out!<br>
Besides, the more we fight them, the more intel on them we get. Sara thinks we should keep moving forward!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Pamiat Merkuria：</span><br>
What she said. I mean, you've not had any trouble fighting what we've seen so far.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Hornet：</span><br>
Ain't that right! We can always fall back later if they turn out to be too much!<br>

<br>
Be it the Royal Navy's tale of Dagda's inexhaustible cauldron or the Sakura Empire's legend of the Dragon King's bottomless rice bag, from all around the world there are stories of objects which produce endless quantities of things.<br>
Similarly, one could describe the number of Sirens emerging from within and around the stronghold as endless.<br>
The Eagle Union forces felt confident after their initial series of easy victories, but the tides of battle have begun turning on them.<br>
Now, they are locked in a stalemate, fighting neck and neck with the Sirens.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Saratoga：</span><br>
Geesh, who would've thought there so many of them... Sara might've underestimated them a bit.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Hornet：</span><br>
We've still got reign over the skies so things are still in my favor, but what about the rest of you?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">South Dakota：</span><br>
I've not taken incapacitating damage, but I'm concerned about my ammo reserves.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Cleveland：</span><br>
Denver's team still has a decent amount of ammo left, but we shouldn't linger here for too long!<br>
Commander, you don't happen to have a plan, do you?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Avrora：</span><br>
Should it come down to it, we cannot win a war of attrition with the Sirens. It's likely that if we keep pushing, we'll be quickly surrounded even if we do make it to the stronghold.<br>
The best we can do is wait here and hold the line until our backup arrives...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Pamiat Merkuria：</span><br>
That, or we could retreat beyond the Sirens' range for a while. Then we'd just need to take out the few that come chasing us.<br>
Whichever you decide, I'll follow your orders, Commander.<br>
<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项1：Your reinforcements, when are they coming?</span>'''''<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项2：First, we have to take out the Sirens encircling us!</span>'''''<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Avrora：</span><br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项1）</span>'''''They told us they're making their way here as fast as they can.<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项1）</span>'''''But that's not to say they'll be here any second now.<br>
<br>
Then I guess retreating to a safer area is our only choice.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Pamiat Merkuria：</span><br>
Well look at you, aren't you a real strategizer!<br>
Guess I'll rev up the ol' engine and help too. I can't promise you I'll kick much Siren butt at all, but it's better than me doing nothing, right?<br>

<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Hornet：</span><br>
All right, we should be safe here. Just gotta deal with the ones that're coming after us!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Columbia：</span><br>
Heads up: more Sirens approaching from the southeast. Most of the ones we alerted have stopped moving, so we can take care of them easy peasy.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Pamiat Merkuria：</span><br>
Man, these Eagle Union guys pack some amazing firepower for not even using Siren tech...<br>
Is it because of the Commander's leadership skills? Is the Commander *that* big-brained? I've gotta look into this...<br>
<br>
...Big-brained?<br>
I could've sworn I just heard someone talking about me...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Pamiat Merkuria：</span><br>
Oh, um, ahaha! Just thinking out loud!<br>

<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Cleveland：</span><br>
A humanoid Siren is coming our way!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Hornet：</span><br>
Oh, I know her all right! I've got a bomb with her name on it!<br>
<br>
Once this enemy has been dealt with, we'll finally have some time to rest.<br>
...Huh? What's that light coming from the Siren?!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Pamiat Merkuria：</span><br>
Oh crap! Look out, Commander!<br>
<br>
The Siren's weapon glowed. Its sights are aimed at me.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">South Dakota：</span><br>
You shall harm NO ONE!<br>
<br>
A burst of entwining flame and electricity rushed towards me. South Dakota rushed in front, blocking the attack with her shield.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">South Dakota：</span><br>
That was close, it nearly hit the Commander... Pamiat, are you okay?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Pamiat Merkuria：</span><br>
Oww... I'm fine, minus the back pain...<br>
<br>
It seems Pamiat Merkuria, too, tried to protect me from the Siren's attack.<br>
South Dakota looks like she took the hit well, but had it hit Pamiat instead, she could have suffered major damage...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Pamiat Merkuria：</span><br>
Oh, and I'm expecting a "thank you" later, got it?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">South Dakota：</span><br>
You deserve my thanks as well. Had you not alerted me to it, I wouldn't have been able to block it so well.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Saratoga：</span><br>
What did I miss? Oh gosh, are you okay, South Dakota?!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">South Dakota：</span><br>
My rigging took only minor damage, but my radar and fire control are malfunctioning. I'd be hard-pressed to fight in my current state...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Saratoga：</span><br>
Malfunctioning?! Have the Sirens pulled out a new weapon on us?!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Avrora：</span><br>
It would seem so. I was never expecting to encounter a weapon that targets our electronics, not in these waters...<br>
<br>
This about confirms that the Sirens in the Bering Sea are not like what we've fought before.<br>
<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项1：South Dakota, I want you to fall back for now.</span>'''''<br>
This about confirms that the Sirens in the Bering Sea are not like what we've fought before.<br>

<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Montpelier：</span><br>
Son of a... Now we've also gotta keep an eye out for that new weapon they have.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Hornet：</span><br>
Doesn't seem to affect my planes, at least. Anyone else reckon the Sirens use this place as a testing ground for their new technology?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Avrora：</span><br>
We won't know until we investigate further. What do you suggest, Commander?<br>
<br>
If they keep hitting us with that weapon, we'll be in deep trouble. In that case...<br>
Now what...<br>

Let me handle it, Commander! My fire control just came back online!<br>
Turrets 1 through 3 are locked and loaded!<br>
Mark 6 guns, take aim and fire!<br>
<br>
South Dakota's volleys land a direct hit on the Siren wielding the strange new weapon while also tearing the enemy line to shreds. Fire and smoke envelop the waters where the Sirens stood.<br>

<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Pamiat Merkuria：</span><br>
Wha... What the hell?!<br>
<br>
The ship is rocking! What's going on?!<br>
"Urgh! *cough*! Crazy Sirens... Now you've really gone and done it!"<br>
"You leave me no choice! Sorry for this, but it's gotta be done!"<br>
All of a sudden, I feel my consciousness begin to fade.<br>
Rapidly... until everything goes black...<br>

*cough*... What just happened?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Montpelier：</span><br>
Cleve! Look!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Cleveland：</span><br>
Is this a... giant iceberg?! Hey, is everyone okay?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Saratoga：</span><br>
Dizzy, but okay... And confused! Where'd this thing come from?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Hornet：</span><br>
Straight outta nowhere, that's where... Wait, where's the Commander?!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">South Dakota：</span><br>
The Commander should be with the Northern Parliament ships on the other side!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Cleveland：</span><br>
Columbia, can you reach them?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Columbia：</span><br>
No... I can't get a line through to either of them...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Saratoga：</span><br>
I know! My planes can find where th– Whuah?!<br>
<br>
BOOOOM!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Columbia：</span><br>
They've even stationed artillery on the iceberg?!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Cleveland：</span><br>
That isn't just some iceberg! It's one of the stronghold's defense mechanisms!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Saratoga：</span><br>
We're in biiig trouble!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Hornet：</span><br>
First things first, get the hell out of its range! Those cannons will shoot us to bits if we stay here!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">South Dakota：</span><br>
Dammit... We have no choice! Let us pray the Commander is safe!<br>
<br>
Meanwhile, on the other side of the iceberg...<br>

Wake up! C'mon, wake up, Commander!<br>
<br>
Mrgh...<br>

WAKE! UP! WE NEED YOU!<br>
<br>
Hagh!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Pamiat Merkuria：</span><br>
There you are, sleepyhead! Hope my wake-up call did you good.<br>
<br>
Wake-up call...? Never mind, where are the others?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Pamiat Merkuria：</span><br>
What a thoughtful commander you are. Sorry to say, but your Eagle Union buddies are on the other side of this wall of ice.<br>
Also, I've got some good news, and some bad news for you.<br>
The bad news are: this whole region became a Mirror Sea after that iceberg showed up, and we can't establish contact with the Eagle Union girls.<br>
<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项1：And the good news?</span>'''''<br>
<br>
BOOOOM!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Avrora：</span><br>
The good news will have to wait, it seems. First we must get out of harm's way of the enemy's attacks.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Pamiat Merkuria：</span><br>
We need someone to command us, so... Do your thing!<br>

Our battle with the Sirens continues...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Pamiat Merkuria：</span><br>
Eep! Stay away, I can't handle it when combat gets too close for comfort!<br>
Avrora, any update on where our backup is?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Avrora：</span><br>
They're not far! We just need to hold on a little longer!<br>
<br>
(Update? How can they still communicate over radio in a Mirror Sea?)<br>
(Seeing how big this iceberg is, it's going to take some time before we can link back up with Saratoga's team...)<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Pamiat Merkuria：</span><br>
I'll try! But I'm nearly out of– Ah! There they are!<br>
<br>
————！！！！！！<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Avrora：</span><br>
Thank goodness, they've finally come for us.<br>
<br>
The backup is not what I had expected.<br>
From beyond the horizon, through the icy winds blowing across the frozen ocean, a group of girls clad in white winter uniforms appear.<br>
Their ranks are composed of destroyers, cruisers, and battleships.<br>
Though their silhouettes are unmistakably human, their auras are anything but; they move like a majestic wave of steel. Their presence reassures the mind.<br>
The riggings they don give off an extraordinary air, one much different to that of Pamiat's or Avrora's.<br>
The weight and ruggedness of their equipment seemed to channel the biting cold of the Arctic North, an otherworldly blue light occasionally seeping out from the gaps between their black iron plates.<br>
There was something almost "primal" about their appearance...<br>
Almost as if... they were Sirens...<br>
<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项1：The Northern Parliament...!</span>'''''<br>
<br>
...<br>
What I saw was not reinforcements from the Eagle Union...<br>
But rather the full might of the Northern Parliament which had long been locked in conflict with the Sirens.<br>

How's that for a timely entrance!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Tashkent：</span><br>
Heh. See, figures you wouldn't be able to do it without us. I suppose we can bail you out.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Gangut：</span><br>

I've grasped the situation. Just leave the rest to us.<br>

<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Chapayev：</span><br>
I'll crush you all underfoot! Take this!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Gangut：</span><br>
Ahahahaha! That's right! Let me see you struggle! Push me to the brink!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Tashkent：</span><br>
I'm not really feeling it, but... I'll do it if I must! Ура! <br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Grozny：</span><br>
кролик... Let's wipe them out so we can go home sooner...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Minsk：</span><br>
Whew! I'm getting a flash of inspiration! Take this!<br>
<br>
The concentrated fire of the Northern Parliament quickly swallowed the Siren forces.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Kirov：</span><br>
Здравствуй, comrade! The name's Kirov! Is this your first time seeing our fleet in action?<br>
If you were surprised by what you saw, don't be shy and just give it to us straight! After all, you're no longer in the Eagle Union, comrade! We'd be glad to listen to anything you have to say!<br>
But before that, let's get you acquainted with everyone here. The one who should do the honors is... the leader of the fleet!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Sovetskaya Rossiya：</span><br>
Ah, that is but a formality. Commander, I am Soveskaya Rossiya, leader of the fleet. Pleased to meet you.<br>
Having that said, that title is just provisional in nature. In actuality, we do not observe rank or status in our command structure.<br>
First of all is Kirov. Her participation in this operation will be limited, but I'd at least like you to remember her face.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Kirov：</span><br>
That's right. We'll get to fight together next time though.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Sovetskaya Rossiya：</span><br>
...This is Chapayev. She's mastered her equipment better than any of us have. Also... I'd advise you to not get on her bad side.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Chapayev：</span><br>
I brought my bridle with me just in case. Anyway, let's get along~<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Sovetskaya Rossiya：</span><br>
Over here is Gangut. She acts hot-blooded and headstrong, but she's actually quite caring.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Gangut：</span><br>
Hahaha! Comrade, let us fight for the safety of these azure lanes!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Sovetskaya Rossiya：</span><br>
This is Tashkent. She was born in Sardegna, but she is one of our irreplaceable friends.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Tashkent：</span><br>
Hmph. I'll show you how strong I really am, dear comrade.<br>
<br>
Dear...?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Chapayev：</span><br>
Haha... Don't read too much into it, all right?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Sovetskaya Rossiya：</span><br>
This is Grozny. I'd advise you to stay away from her Кроли.<br>
<br>
Clo...ri...?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Grozny：</span><br>
Yes... This is my кроли убийца... It's a cute bunny that kills things...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Sovetskaya Rossiya：</span><br>
Finally, this is Minsk. Her imagination can be a bit whimsical, but also helpful at times. Hopefully she can offer you some new insights.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Minsk：</span><br>
Ehehe, pleased to meet you, Commander!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Sovetskaya Rossiya：</span><br>
I assume I don't need to introduce Avrora and Pamiat Merkuria...<br>
<br>
So this... is the Northern Parliament...<br>
Before I saw them in action today, I always had been led to believe that they were a collection of peculiar personalities that couldn't hold their own compared to the other major factions.<br>
...But only half of that statement held true. Their abilities were far beyond anything I had expected.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Sovetskaya Rossiya：</span><br>
Under the provisions of our joint operation, the fleet of the Northern Parliament is now yours to command, comrade.<br>
<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项1：...Who, me?</span>'''''<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Sovetskaya Rossiya：</span><br>
That's correct, comrade. This operation is not over yet. I hope you will wield our power effectively.<br>

<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Sovetskaya Rossiya：</span><br>
Kill confirmed! None may stand before the might of the Northern Parliament!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Tashkent：</span><br>
I'll beat you all to a pulp!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Grozny：</span><br>
We'll kick out anything that trespasses upon our home, vermin or Siren...!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Minsk：</span><br>
Haha! What do you think, Commander? Pretty good coordination on the fly, right?<br>
<br>
Remarkably, despite not having a determined command structure, the members of the Northern Parliament all fought on the same page, as if linked by their strong sense of unity.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">？？？：</span><br>
I know you like what you see, but it's best not to stare too much, Commander~<br>
<br>
I felt a warm breath tickle my ear. Chapayev had snuck up behind me.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Chapayev：</span><br>
Here's the report on the current status of our positioning, supplies, and damages. Please look it over before everyone gets back.<br>
Whether you choose to attack the Siren stronghold or rejoin with the Eagle Union forces, we'll likely encounter more enemies.<br>
So, what will your orders be, Commander? I'll do anything you say~<br>
<br>
What we should do now is...<br>
<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项1：Join up with the Eagle Union fleet.</span>'''''<br>
<br>
I'm worried about my friends. But, now that our communications have been disrupted by the Mirror Sea, what should we do next...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Sovetskaya Rossiya：</span><br>
This is solely based upon anecdotal evidence, but we believe that the "nucleus" must be destroyed in order to escape from the influence of the Mirror Sea.<br>
From the information we've been able to analyze, we believe that then nucleus is located within the Siren stronghold.<br>
In other words, it is necessary for us to capture the Siren stronghold in order to achieve your goal - and perhaps the Eagle Union has realized that as well.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Kirov：</span><br>
дa. It is very likely that the Eagle Union is also en route to the stronghold.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Gangut：</span><br>
Of course they are! Where else would they be headed to in this Mirror Sea?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Minsk：</span><br>
Aha! I get it! If we just capture the stronghold, all we have to do is wait for the others to show up!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Sovetskaya Rossiya：</span><br>
You mixed up our objectives, but... that thought process isn't wrong.<br>
Wouldn't it be better to focus our attention on the common objective instead of expending valuable time and resources searching around blindly?<br>
<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项1：Attack the Siren stronghold.</span>'''''<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Chapayev：</span><br>
It's decided then. I'll be counting on you~<br>
<br>
Let's trust our friends' judgment.<br>

<br>
Perhaps because of the efforts lead by Saratoga's group, fewer Sirens were coming at us than expected.<br>
Ideally, we'd be able to join forces before launching our main offensive against the Siren stronghold...<br>
Hopefully that wouldn't be too optimistic...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Sovetskaya Rossiya：</span><br>
Comrade, you ought to take a break and eat. After all, "a healthy body houses a healthy mind."<br>
Our offerings may not be as sumptuous as the Royal Navy or the Sakura Empire, but it should be enough to fill the stomach.<br>
<br>
Laid out in front of me was karavai bread, canned tushonka, caviar, and...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Grozny：</span><br>
Commander, would you like some borscht?<br>
<br>
Hot borscht kept in an insulated container, and a chocolate milk blend on the side.<br>
What about this meal wasn't sumptuous?<br>
<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项1：...Delicious!</span>'''''<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Chapayev：</span><br>
I see you have quite the appetite~ Commander, I think you'd fit in great here.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Sovetskaya Rossiya：</span><br>
Take this time to get some rest before the upcoming battle.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Chapayev：</span><br>
That's right. It's hard to stay warm in this cold weather, so please drink up.<br>
<br>
Could this be...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Sovetskaya Rossiya：</span><br>
It's a classic. Nothing beats vodka for staving off the cold. Of course, you're welcome to have something else if you don't drink.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Grozny：</span><br>
"It's part of the fun of the Northern Parliament," or something along those lines.<br>
<br>

For some unknown reason, Tashkent had been glaring at me intently for some time now.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Tashkent：</span><br>

<br>
Speaking of which, this girl seems to have been rather grumpy ever since we met...<br>

'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项1：Am I in your way?</span>'''''<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Tashkent：</span><br>
 Not really? Do you have some objection to me looking at you, dear comrade?<br>
Well then, I'll keep looking at you since you're fine with it anyway.<br>
...Hey, want to hear me out on something?<br>
<br>
Why was she calling me "dear?" Had we met before? ...But I suppose that would have to wait for later.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Tashkent：</span><br>
You've been all over the place, right?<br>
So you'd... know a thing or two about Sardegna, right?<br>
<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项1：Of course.</span>'''''<br>

<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Tashkent：</span><br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项2）</span>'''''I see. Should Tashkent teach you about Sardegna then?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Tashkent：</span><br>

Near the Siren stronghold - Eagle Union fleet<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Hornet：</span><br>
Hmm? The Sirens' attacks aren't as intense as they were before.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Saratoga：</span><br>
Oh no! They must be diverting their forces to pursue the Commander!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Columbia：</span><br>
I can't imagine that being the case... but due to the interference of the Mirror Sea, we still can't get in touch with Avrora and the others.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Hornet：</span><br>
Then, we have to find some way of shutting down the Mirror Sea first. It'll be too hard for us to get around that iceberg.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Cleveland：</span><br>
In other words, we'll have to take down that Siren stronghold?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Hornet：</span><br>
Yeah, that's the quickest way to get things done. We should act quickly while their forces are diverted.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">South Dakota：</span><br>
I agree. How about you, Saratoga?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Saratoga：</span><br>
We don't have any other choice... Let's hurry up and get going!<br>

<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Minsk：</span><br>
Gangut, an unidentified fleet is approaching you!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Gangut：</span><br>
Is that one of the Sirens' "Pieces?" Ahaha!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Kirov：</span><br>
Wait, Gangut, hold on!<br>
<br>
BOOOOM!!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Gangut：</span><br>
Did I miss my first salvo? Well, try this on for size!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Kirov：</span><br>
Hold your fire! That's the Commander and the Eagle Union fleet!<br>
Оченьхорошо! Let's hurry and send the signal to join up!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Saratoga：</span><br>
Hey, what the heck was with that salvo?! You could've hit us with that!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Gangut：</span><br>
Gyaahh! I was about to betray the Azur Lane! ...Unforgivable!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Kirov：</span><br>
...Anyway, I'm Kirov from the Northern Parliament, and these two are Minsk and Gangut.<br>
As you're probably well aware, the Sirens' "Pieces" are made in the image of us and our allies. That was the quickest way of determining whether or not you were real.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Saratoga：</span><br>
I get that it's better to be safe than sorry, but did you really have to fire live ammunition? Do you guys often fire at each other here?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Minsk：</span><br>
I guess you have a point... We don't do that...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Saratoga：</span><br>
Gaaahhh!!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Kirov：</span><br>
Ahem... In any case, our main fleet has joined up with your commander, so we were instructed to find your fleet and regroup with you.<br>
Currently, the commander is also advancing upon the Siren stronghold.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Hornet：</span><br>
That means Commander is safe then? What a relief!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Minsk：</span><br>
Indeed. But that means, in the commander's absence, the one leading this fleet was...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Hornet：</span><br>
Yeah, we have a veteran here in Saratoga!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Saratoga：</span><br>
You're looking at her right now!<br>
I'm the one who has been leading the Eagle Union's fleet in Commander's absence.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Minsk：</span><br>
Eh? You're a carrier? How come you're so much smaller than Hornet over there?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Saratoga：</span><br>
.........Ruuuuude!!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Kirov：</span><br>

Ahahaha! That's the spirit, Eagle Union carrier! Today's a fine day for getting a good workout!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Saratoga：</span><br>
I still don't like the way you talk, but at least you have some real firepower to back it up.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Kirov：</span><br>
In any case, we've mopped up the last of the enemies here. Let's keep pressing forward towards the stronghold.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Hornet：</span><br>
We've got to hurry and join back up with the Commander!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Minsk：</span><br>
All right! With my inspiration and the technical expertise of the Northern Parliament, we'll be out of here in no time!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Kirov：</span><br>
Minsk managed to re-establish a link with the commander's fleet just now, and is confirming our route!<br>
Give me a second... we'll go here, and here...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">South Dakota：</span><br>
(They managed to break through the Mirror Sea's jamming?! What kind of black magic does the Northern Parliament have...?!)<br>
(Furthermore, I still can't shake the feeling that their rigging resembles the Sirens... I can't help but to be suspicious.)<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Kirov：</span><br>
Got it! Oh, wait...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Gangut：</span><br>
What is it, Kirov?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Kirov：</span><br>
The Sirens found out about our anti-jamming and is intensifying their disruption. You're going to have to give me the coordinates by hand.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Minsk：</span><br>
Here you go! As long as we have the coordinates, we'll still be able to join up with the rest of our comrades!<br>

<br>
Later, at the Siren stronghold<br>
Little could impede the progress of the Northern Parliament's fleet as it plunged deeper into the Siren stronghold.<br>
As was suspected earlier, the stronghold was linked to the defensive structures on the surrounding icebergs.<br>
Light reflected off the jagged spires of ice, revealing the countless defensive structures and artillery mounts encased within.<br>
This was the true nature of the stronghold.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Chapayev：</span><br>
I didn't expect all of this to be dwelling just beneath us...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Sovetskaya Rossiya：</span><br>
We should have addressed this threat long ago...<br>
<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项1：Why didn't you...?</span>'''''<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Sovetskaya Rossiya：</span><br>
Well, the Northern Parliament's anti-Siren capacities are concentrated along our sea routes, coastal areas, and in the Arctic region.<br>
We did not have the ability to reach a remote location like this one.<br>
Like Azur Lane, we're trying to first re-establish control over our sailing routes.<br>
As was with the case in NY City, it can be difficult to justify mobilizing forces to areas that have not presented a clear threat.<br>
I hope you understand the circumstances.<br>
<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项1：What's your broader strategy?</span>'''''<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Chapayev：</span><br>
Our general principle is to use whatever resources are at our disposal, but...<br>
Admittedly, we didn't give much consideration to the idea of taking this stronghold for ourselves.<br>
...We may not have done the proper amount of research in this case.<br>
<br>
Either way, since we've already come this far, we can't leave empty-handed.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Sovetskaya Rossiya：</span><br>
Right, our objective is still the same. We just have to take down this stronghold.<br>
We are under your command, comrade.<br>

<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Sovetskaya Rossiya：</span><br>
...Understood. Our rendezvous coordinates are...<br>
There's a message from Kirov. She's successfully joined up with the Eagle Union fleet and is making her way here.<br>
<br>
Communication technology in the Mirror Seas? We're going to have look into this.<br>
<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项1：Does the Northern Parliament have a way to bypass the Mirror Sea's jamming effect?</span>'''''<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Sovetskaya Rossiya：</span><br>
Oh? Are you interested in that? Does the Eagle Union perchance not have that technology?<br>
<span style="color:#ec5d53;">???：</span><br>
From Prometheus to Goemon, your lives are nasty, brutish, and short.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Sovetskaya Rossiya：</span><br>
Who's there?!<br>
<br>
An unfamiliar, alien voice rose from the transmission.<br>
<span style="color:#ec5d53;">???：</span><br>
I don't remember inviting you barbarous louts to my estate. Crass creatures, stupid beyond comprehension.<br>
I'll say this in a way you idiots will understand. Get the hell out of here!<br>
Overzealous ignoramuses! Boundless greed and avarice!<br>
Yes, begone, thieves in the night! Plunderers! Face destruction and sink by my hand!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Grozny：</span><br>
The ice walls are closing in around us!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Pamiat Merkuria：</span><br>
Shoot...! I don't like the looks of this! Everyone, retreat, hurry!<br>
<br>
The stronghold stirred like a behemoth given life by the mysterious Siren voice, rough winds and waves forming as sheets of ice deformed and convulsed.<br>
No, the very stronghold - and the entire Mirror Sea - was beginning to move.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Sovetskaya Rossiya：</span><br>
We've lost contact with Kirov! These damn Sirens...!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Avrora：</span><br>
All the Siren forces are congregating around us! Commander, at this rate...<br>
<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项1：Our only option is to meet up with the Eagle Union fleet!</span>'''''<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项2：Our only option is to fight back right now!</span>'''''<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Sovetskaya Rossiya：</span><br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项1）</span>'''''A courageous choice. Heh, in that case, we'll have to muster up the courage to match you!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Chapayev：</span><br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项2）</span>'''''A calculated decision, Commander. As expected, you've taken stock of the situation quickly.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Sovetskaya Rossiya：</span><br>
...Comrades, we have no choice but to fight!<br>
Our lives are in your hands, Commander!<br>

<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Saratoga：</span><br>
Commander spotted! Saratoga's making her grand entrance!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Sovetskaya Rossiya：</span><br>
Gangut, Kirov, Minsk, it's great to see you!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Kirov：</span><br>
Heh, there's a ton of enemies...! Can you still do this, Gangut?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Gangut：</span><br>
Don't underestimate me, Kirov! Our souls burn most brilliantly only in the face of adversity!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Minsk：</span><br>
Heheh, we've managed to join with the others thanks to my inspiration!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Cleveland：</span><br>
I'm so glad you're safe, Commander! And these are the girls from the Northern Parliament?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Chapayev：</span><br>
Indeed, are you ready to fight with us?<br>
<br>
The combined coalition of Eagle Union and Northern Parliament ships will intercept the Siren fleet.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Minsk：</span><br>
Oh, that's right! During that call we had earlier, an unknown enemy suddenly showed up...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Chapayev：</span><br>
We saw her too... But right now, our main priority is to defeat the enemy.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Gangut：</span><br>
That's right! This is the last battle, so we've gotta make the ground run red with blood!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Grozny：</span><br>
кролик is ready too...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Kirov：</span><br>
Follow us to glory, Eagle Union!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Sovetskaya Rossiya：</span><br>
Northern Parliament Combined Fleet, prepare for battle! Give these Sirens a taste of our true power!<br>
<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项1：Let's head towards the deepest part of the stronghold!</span>'''''<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Everybody：</span><br>
Let's go!!<br>
{{折叠面板|内容结束}}

{{折叠面板|标题=Omitter|选项=26|主框=1|样式=primary|展开=否}}
<span style="color:#ec5d53;">？？？：</span><br>
The enemies have come to challenge me... and these insects have embraced evil... How ignorant, how foolish!<br>
What they shall find at the core, Deus ex Machina, shall put an end to their journey!<br>
Give yourself to fear, for the end is nigh!!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Tashkent：</span><br>
...Is that so? The hell are you talking about? Are you trying to sound cool?<br>
<span style="color:#ec5d53;">？？？：</span><br>
.........<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Tashkent：</span><br>
Come out already. That script you're reading from is lame.<br>
<span style="color:#ec5d53;">？？？：</span><br>
.........<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Chapayev：</span><br>
Tashkent, do you know what she's talking about?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Sovetskaya Rossiya：</span><br>
Don't just skulk about in the shadows, Siren! Come out and give us a fair fight!<br>
<span style="color:#ec5d53;">？？？：</span><br>
Gahaha... You asked for it!<br>
<br>
(CREEAAAAAKKKK...!!)<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Pamiat Merkuria：</span><br>
What the heck is that...<br>
<br>
The ice walls cracked and split apart as a massive mechanical device began to stir, changing into a different form.<br>
A giant dome rose over the icy waters and blocked out the light...<br>
What in the world... is this...?!<br>
<span style="color:#ec5d53;">？？？：</span><br>
"The king dons his Crown, the flowers are in full bloom, and the souls return to the seas. Thus begins the Overture of the End!"<br>
Every finale gives way to a new overture, as destruction gives way to new life. I am "Omitter."<br>
<span style="color:#ec5d53;">Omitter：</span><br>
I am the one who rules over these seas!<br>
<br>
The Siren who masterminds these Mirror Seas has appeared before us.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Minsk：</span><br>
...I don't recognize her rigging...! Is she in the Eagle Union's database?!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Gangut：</span><br>
Good, it isn't a proper finale without a high-ranking boss!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Grozny：</span><br>
If we defeat her, we can get rid of this Mirror Sea...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Avrora：</span><br>
(There's something different about her compared to the other Sirens we've fought before...)<br>
<span style="color:#ec5d53;">Omitter：</span><br>
Ahahaha! I like the looks of your faces! Yes, that's the performance that They desire!<br>
Let's see what it says next... "My name shall be carved into your souls as you spend the rest of eternity trembling at the bottom of the abyss!"<br>
That's so lame, it's cool! Ahahahaha!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Tashkent：</span><br>
What a cheeky brat. Can I beat her up, dear comrade?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Kirov：</span><br>
Unfortunately, your idle threats mean nothing to the Northern Parliament!<br>
<span style="color:#ec5d53;">Omitter：</span><br>
What?! Impossible...!!<br>
You assholes!! You won't even play along with me for a few minutes!! Unforgivable!!!!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Minsk：</span><br>
She's coming at us!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Sovetskaya Rossiya：</span><br>
Everyone, be on your guard!<br>

<span style="color:#ec5d53;">Omitter：</span><br>
Futile, futile, futile! I built this stronghold, and I won't let you beat me in my own castle!<br>
Ahahaha! That's it, that's it! I feel like my potential is limitless! Is this the excitement that Tester is so drawn to?!<br>
Come at me, yes, come, come! Struggle! Suffer!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Cleveland：</span><br>
That attack of hers... it's not just interfering with our fire control, but also obstructing our vision!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Hornet：</span><br>
Our rigging isn't working! I can't land a hit at all!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Chapayev：</span><br>
If we can't aim, then we might as well stop trying!<br>
<br>
...Huh?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Chapayev：</span><br>
We have an absolute advantage in terms of firepower! Keep focusing your fire at a general area, and we're bound to hit!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Gangut：</span><br>
Haha! That's right! Get a load of how we fight here in the Northern Parliament!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Tashkent：</span><br>
Release suppressive fire!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Saratoga：</span><br>
In other words, quantity over quality! That's fine by me, I have all the ammunition you could ever want!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Sovetskaya Rossiya：</span><br>
That's right! Keep pummeling away at this stronghold!<br>

<span style="color:#ec5d53;">Omitter：</span><br>
They're still fighting back...?!<br>
However, the horn of the apocalypse has sounded, and the wheel of fate continues to turn...<br>
You cannot escape your demise! I will be back...!<br>
<br>
Omitter pointed her finger to the sky, and disappeared in a flash of light.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Tashkent：</span><br>
Welp, I guess that's that. After spending all that time blathering nonsense...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Kirov：</span><br>
You're right. It's our victory, Commander.<br>
<br>
(RUMBLE...!!!)<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Hornet：</span><br>
The entire stronghold is starting to collapse! We need to get out of here!<br>
<br>
...In a thunderous roar, the stronghold crumbled and sank beneath the waves.<br>
Shortly afterwards, the Mirror Sea began to dissipate. The storms stopped, and the warm light of the winter sun spilled through the clouds once more.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Avrora：</span><br>
This sea really is beautiful...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Chapayev：</span><br>
Indeed. This is what it ought to look like.<br>
<br>
The calm that spread before my eyes was reminescent of the first time I saw it, but something was also different.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Saratoga：</span><br>
Not only did you get to fight with the Northern Parliament's main fleet, but you even got to fight a new high-ranking Siren...<br>
<br>
She was right. A lot had happened in a short amount of time, and I felt like I had changed.<br>
Finally, we would be able to return home to port.<br>
At least, that's what I thought...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Sovetskaya Rossiya：</span><br>
Comrade, could I ask you to stay with the Northern Parliament for a bit longer?<br>

<br>
Years ago, in the Northern Parliament...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Avrora：</span><br>
Heave... ho... Phew, that should do it...<br>
We've seen a lot of fighting, but some things seem to never change.<br>
<br>
Avrora, a first-generation ship who was born in this era, looked around.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Avrora：</span><br>
We've arrived, comrades...<br>
...at the place which will give rise to a new world...<br>
Here is the "cube" that is capable of storing human emotion...<br>
...Let's begin, for the future of the Northern Parliament.<br>

<br>
Somewhere in the Northern Parliament... <br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Sovetskaya Rossiya：</span><br>
I'm glad you decided to stay with us for a bit longer.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Grozny：</span><br>
Hehe... Commander, it's cold outside, but warm in here. Want some hot chocolate?<br>
<br>
It really is cold here in the Northern Parliament...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Pamiat Merkuria：</span><br>
We might not have as much variety as you do in the Eagle Union, but I can assure you, the taste is unbeatable~<br>
What are you fantasizing about? Of course it wasn't I who made this for you~♪<br>
<br>
The food here was undoubtedly delicious.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Chapayev：</span><br>
Indeed. The fight against the Sirens is only going to escalate and get drawn out from here, so we'll continue to request aid from the other factions.<br>
<br>
The war between the Sirens and the Northern Parliament continues. Nevertheless...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Tashkent：</span><br>
This is where Tashkent and company go to relax.<br>
Pretty nice scenery, right? ...Right. Come on, take a seat. Let's have a chat, shall we?<br>
<br>
I was guided to the roof of a khrushchyovka, a tall building overlooking the city.<br>
The members of the Northern Parliament introduced me to a variety of different places.<br>
The whole experience was different from what I had experienced anywhere else.<br>
And today, Sovetskaya Rossiya would take me to meet a certain "important person"...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">？？？：</span><br>
"We've received your reports and data."<br>
"Wisdom cube compatibility, commanding ability, personality, political assessment... everything has been reviewed..."<br>
<br>
——！！<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">？？？：</span><br>
"Are they here?"<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Sovetskaya Rossiya：</span><br>
Comrade, this way please.<br>
<br>
Light poured into the room from the window.<br>
When my eyes adjusted, I saw a woman clad in white standing inside the room, her garb resembling that of the other members of the Northern Parliament fleet.<br>
The deliberate and dignified words she spoke seemed to echo directly into my mind.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Sovetsky Soyuz：</span><br>
"Commander, would you join the Northern Parliament?"<br>

<br>
Days later, NY City<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Saratoga：</span><br>
You're going to stay with the Northern Parliament? What's the meaning of this?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Enterprise：</span><br>
It's just a visit, nothing more to it. What did you think was going to happen?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Saratoga：</span><br>
I guess so. Well, it's not like the commander is beholden to the Eagle Union, and I'm sure all the other factions feel the same way.<br>
More importantly, look at all these photos I managed to get. What do you think?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Enterprise：</span><br>
I was quite surprised. I've never seen anything like it before... the riggin that the Northern Parliament fleet was equipped with, that is...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Saratoga：</span><br>
They seem to be making more progress on their wisdom cube research.<br>
I suspect that rigging is a product of some breakthrough they made.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Enterprise：</span><br>
Any possibility that it might have been captured or discarded Siren technology?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Saratoga：</span><br>
There's a possibility, but we can't know for sure.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Enterprise：</span><br>
Siren technology, huh... Are they also going down that path...?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">？？？：</span><br>
...the commander has headed north...<br>
...the final overture...<br>
...has begun to play...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Saratoga：</span><br>
Enterprise, did you say something?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Enterprise：</span><br>
No... (What was that... just now?)<br>
