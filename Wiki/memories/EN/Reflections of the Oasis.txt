1 Sandstorm in the Oasis<br>
Unknown Location<br>
Sardegna Fleet Garrison - The Oasis<br>
During the World Expo<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Radio：</span><br>
Before the boat had hit the water♪<br>
The whale's tail came up and caught her♪<br>
All hands to the side, harpooned and fought her♪<br>
When she dived down below♪<br>
<br>
A lighthearted sea shanty played over the desk radio in the Sardegnian docking facility's break room.<br>
*door clicks*<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Attilio Regolo：</span><br>
Oh! Andrea, hello! Are you having a lovely morning?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Andrea Doria：</span><br>
Attilio? Um, I guess...?<br>
The weather does seem a little odd today...<br>
By the way, Attilio, are you the one who put this station on the radio?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Attilio Regolo：</span><br>
Yep! I don't really understand what's going on in the song, but it sounds fun, right?<br>
Heheh, I've gotten a lot more into music ever since you found this radio for us!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Andrea Doria：</span><br>
Is that so...?<br>
Well, I'm glad I could awaken a new interest in you.<br>
<br>
*door clicks*<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Attilio Regolo：</span><br>
Oh, Gorizia's back, too!<br>
Come and listen with me. The program's already...<br>
Whaaat?! Don't change the station! They were just getting to my favorite music...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Radio：</span><br>
We now bring you urgent news.<br>
Due to an abnormal situation of unknown cause, this region will experience an enormous sandstorm from 2:30 PM today to 3:00 AM tomorrow.<br>
In order to minimize damage, the facility's windbreak walls will be closed in fifteen minutes. Please remain inside the facility to avoid injury.<br>
Now, here is a list of instructions for minimizing danger in the face of a sandstorm...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Attilio Regolo：</span><br>
A... sandstorm?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Andrea Doria：</span><br>
They did call it abnormal... Sandstorms should be unthinkable at this time of year.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Gorizia：</span><br>
I was surprised when I heard it, too.<br>
But no sandstorm has ever gotten through since the windbreak walls were installed.<br>
Actually... They were planning to hold a presentation in the Upper Senate today. I hope the sandstorm doesn't interrupt that.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Andrea Doria：</span><br>
A presentation? Who's the speaker?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Gorizia：</span><br>
Marco Polo. I hear it's related to the World Expo.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Andrea Doria：</span><br>
Ahahaha... Of course it is.<br>
I had no idea. Have you been keeping a close eye on these things lately, Gorizia?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Gorizia：</span><br>
Not really? It's peaceful around here, so I'm just finding ways to pass the time.<br>
But the sandstorm is going to make communications rough for a while, huh...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Andrea Doria：</span><br>
Not just communications. We won't be able to do any work outside.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Gorizia：</span><br>
Right... Ah, well. Guess I'm calling it quits early today!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Attilio Regolo：</span><br>
Yeah! Let's take the day off!<br>
...Oh, but the sandstorm means I won't be able to listen to the radio anymore...<br>
Now I'm sad. I won't have anything to do!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Gorizia：</span><br>
Now that you mention it... I've read all of the books I brought with me.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Andrea Doria：</span><br>
We're kind of surrounded by sand... After the sandstorm passes, we'll have to look into serious repairs.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Gorizia：</span><br>
It is an old facility, after all. You never know what they went through in the old days.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Andrea Doria：</span><br>
Haha... That's true. I happen to know of a few old stories, myself.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Attilio Regolo：</span><br>
...Stories? I want to hear stories!<br>
Yeah, tell us some stories! I want to hear stuff about you two!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Gorizia：</span><br>
Stories, huh? Will any old story from before our coming to the Oasis do?<br>
I do have some, but they're from a long time ago... Before this whole war even started.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Andrea Doria：</span><br>
Goodness, that is long ago. Now you've piqued my interest, hahaha.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Gorizia：</span><br>
I'm sure it's nothing compared to yours, Andrea...<br>
If I tell a story, then you have to share one too, okay? You must have plenty of fascinating things to talk about.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Andrea Doria：</span><br>
Of course! You have yourself a deal.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Attilio Regolo：</span><br>
I'll go get drinks and snacks!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Andrea & Gorizia：</span><br>
In moderation, please.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Attilio Regolo：</span><br>
I know! Hahaha!<br>

2 Reflections of Unity<br>
Oasis Facility - Break Room<br>
The warm light of the desk lamp illuminated the faces of the three seated shipgirls.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Gorizia：</span><br>
Before the war began...<br>
<br>
Frontline Battlefield<br>
Mediterranean Garrison - Andalusia<br>
Day 10 of the Reenactment<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Richelieu：</span><br>
With this many forces, I think we'll see a fast and decisive victory.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Implacable：</span><br>
It has only just begun, Archbishop. At this rate, it'll devolve into a mad brawl.<br>
If we aren't vigilant, we'll fail to respond when disaster strikes.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Richelieu：</span><br>
...I suppose you're right.<br>
Regardless, we have to secure the items... lest our superiors learn about this.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Implacable：</span><br>
Then I would suggest you do it quickly. I can't hide the truth forever.<br>
We don't have permission to interfere in this Reenactment.<br>
If we're questioned, we'll have no choice but to obey and let it go.<br>
<br>
*knock knock*<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Gorizia：</span><br>
Archbishop, Implacable. Excuse me.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Implacable：</span><br>
Yes, excuse you. We were in the middle of talking...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Richelieu：</span><br>
Gorizia, would you mind helping me roll up these maps?<br>
...If we take this route, we may be able to avoid unnecessary conflict.<br>
But once you arrive at the supposedly "neutral" port, the rest is in your hands.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Implacable：</span><br>
We wouldn't want to see these valuable items destroyed in this Reenactment, either.<br>
Please, Gorizia. This is an earnest request from the Iris Orthodoxy and the Royal Navy.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Gorizia：</span><br>
...Huh?<br>
D-don't be silly, you two. It's not that big a deal!<br>
Anyway... Sure. In the morning, I'll bring the recovered items to the Sardegnian fleet.<br>
When things settle down, we'll find an opportunity to return them to their rightful place. Does that work for everyone?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Implacable：</span><br>
It's our only option. I have no objections.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Richelieu：</span><br>
Then we'll execute the plan as delineated. The transport convoy will leave tomorrow at dawn, so please accompany them.<br>
The battle rages on. Gorizia, we'd feel much more comfortable if you stayed with us overnight.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Gorizia：</span><br>
Roger.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Vauquelin：</span><br>
Everyone, look at this cool thing I found!<br>
Tadaah! Fancy new harmonica!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Implacable：</span><br>
Goodness. It seems our Templar Knight wants to put on a show for us today, everyone. Shall we?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Attilio Regolo：</span><br>
So you're telling me... you've met Richelieu and Implacable?<br>
Whoooa!<br>
They all seem like such important people!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Andrea Doria：</span><br>
Wow. I had no idea...<br>
But, look at how things have changed since then... *sigh*...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Gorizia：</span><br>
Yeah, it seems not that long ago when we were all working together, and now...<br>
Oh, but, things have been getting better as of late, right? The World Expo even went off without a hitch.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Andrea Doria：</span><br>
I hear Iris Libre is even helping out at the expo?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Gorizia：</span><br>
Archbishop Richelieu may not have been able to go in person, but she's been hard at work behind the scenes.<br>
And that's not all. She has her hands tied with the Vichya Dominion...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Andrea Doria：</span><br>
Yeah, then there's the thing with the Crimson Axis...<br>
*siiigh*...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Attilio Regolo：</span><br>
Why's everyone sighing now?!<br>
Umm, Gorizia, you said things have been going well, right?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Andrea Doria：</span><br>
They really are. We sigh, but only because we're remembering how things used to be.<br>
I'm sure Mikasa would say something like...<br>
"Damn! If you haven't figured out how to end the war, then don't start it in the first place!"<br>
Speaking of Mikasa, I hear she's been working behind the scenes in the Sakura Empire. What is she after...?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Attilio Regolo：</span><br>
Mikasa...? Is she the same one who came up in my book?<br>
She's like a super-big-shot who carried a whole fight on her back a long time ago! Andrea, do you know Granny Mikasa?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Andrea Doria：</span><br>
G-Granny...?<br>
Y-yeeeah, it was sooo long ago... Attilio, would you like to know more about Granny Mikasa?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Attilio Regolo：</span><br>
Yeah! Please!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Andrea Doria：</span><br>
Give me a second to remember... Okay. You're gonna love this one.<br>

3 Reflections of Travel<br>
Oasis Facility - Break Room<br>
As the night wore on, the sandstorm outside rumbled endlessly.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Andrea Doria：</span><br>
Now, Gran—ahem... Mikasa and I fought together in one major battle...<br>
Oh, I know you. You're Mikasa, aren't you...?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Mikasa：</span><br>
Huh, so this is what Sardegna is putting all their innovation toward...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Andrea Doria：</span><br>
Innovation...?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Mikasa：</span><br>
Oh, excuse me. You are Andrea Doria from Sardegna, if I'm not mistaken?<br>
Thanks for coming all this way to the Sakura Empire. As you know, I'm the Combined Fleet's flagship, Mikasa.<br>
I'll be your guide during your stay, so feel free to speak up if you need anything.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Andrea Doria：</span><br>
Combined Fleet flagship, dreadnought Mikasa...<br>
Seeing really is believing. Even in Europa, you're as famous as they come.<br>
Together with Avrora's fleet, you struck a mighty blow to the Sirens and seized victory.<br>
A distinguished shipgirl who shattered the myth that the Sirens were invincible and untouchable. A symbol of hope.<br>
I've never so much as been on a battlefield. It would be wrong for you of all people to be stuck guiding me.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Mikasa：</span><br>
Hahaha, come on, you don't have to butter me up. We're all just doing our jobs.<br>
We might be from different factions, but we're all shipgirls. If you need combat experience, you'll be able to get plenty here.<br>
Besides, it's a host's duty to receive guests. There's nothing wrong with me taking care of you.<br>
Now that the war situation is stable, it's time for us to form relationships with other factions. For the sake of our ultimate victory, let us treat you!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Andrea Doria：</span><br>
...Th-thank you!<br>
U-umm, so where should we go next?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Mikasa：</span><br>
Good question. Your meeting with Lady Nagato is the day after tomorrow, so how about I show you the sights until then?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Andrea Doria：</span><br>
The day after tomorrow? Phew... That's good. I needed time to prepare myself...<br>
In that case, I should ask now. Are there any things I should avoid doing, or be careful about doing, in the Sakura Empery?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Mikasa：</span><br>
Uh, what...? Hahaha, you don't have to be so tense. Take it easy.<br>
You're an honored guest. Don't put so much pressure on yourself.<br>
Your speech at the Holy Iris was fantastic; you know how to carry yourself, so you'll be just fine.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Andrea Doria：</span><br>
You knew about that?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Mikasa：</span><br>
Heh. Don't underestimate your elders, now.<br>
Since the formation of Azur Lane, the global situation has been developing daily. We've put a lot of effort into information collection.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Andrea Doria：</span><br>
Ahaha... Sorry if this is sudden, but what did you think of the opinions in my speech?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Mikasa：</span><br>
I agree, of course. Azur Lane is our hopes for the future given form.<br>
I have to find it strange that we haven't signed our treaties sooner, given how long it's been since Azur Lane was formed.<br>
Time waits for no shipgirl. Someday, we pioneer ships will fall behind the times.<br>
So, we need to settle whatever we can now.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Andrea Doria：</span><br>
You're right...<br>
All I'd considered was that these treaties would make things easier for everyone.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Mikasa：</span><br>
Of course. That's a real benefit.<br>
You and I see the same things. If there's a difference between us, it's that we see them from different angles.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Andrea Doria：</span><br>
Hopes for the future... I don't know if I can envision things that far ahead, hahaha...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Mikasa：</span><br>
Consider it the wisdom of us fanciful older shipgirls.<br>
There'll be plenty of shipgirls, like you, who can do even better than we did. Maybe it's about time for us to exit the spotlight.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Andrea Doria：</span><br>
That's not true. I think you have at least ten more years in you.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Mikasa：</span><br>
I hope you're right. Hahahaha!<br>
So, about that sightseeing. Have you ever heard of the Sakura Empire's Diadem of Light?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Andrea Doria：</span><br>
Of course! Those would be the islands where rituals and ceremonies are held, right?<br>
You offer your prayers to some artifact... Umm, a divine stone, I think? Heheh, it's a lot like wishing on a shooting star!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Mikasa：</span><br>
More or less.<br>
Y'know, there's a ritual today. Want to go see it before you go to your hotel for the night?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Attilio Regolo：</span><br>
Wow! So you got to go to a festival?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Andrea Doria：</span><br>
That's right. I had a lot of fun gorging myself on Sakura cuisine!<br>
Looking back, Mikasa might have called herself old, but she had such a youthful vigor about her.<br>
I think she said that someday, a shipgirl might become the priestess of the Diadem of Light.<br>
...That was a great trip.<br>
It was a shame that I didn't get to see Watatsumi, but such a large festival is a rare opportunity.<br>
Huh. You know, last time I brought this up, Marco Polo bombarded me with questions.<br>
She really wanted to know about Watatsumi... I never saw it, though.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Attilio Regolo：</span><br>
Are you acquainted with Marco Polo, too, Andrea?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Andrea Doria：</span><br>
Acquainted... is a word. Most of my knowledge of her came from Cavour...<br>
Why do you ask?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Attilio Regolo：</span><br>
Now that you mention Marco Polo...<br>
I have a story for you two!<br>
It's a big job that Marco Polo gave me! Wanna hear about it?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Gorizia：</span><br>
Marco Polo gave you a mission? What was it?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Attilio Regolo：</span><br>
Yeah! She had me search for something before I came here!<br>
It's also the weirdest mission I've ever been on...<br>

4 Mirage in the Dead Sea<br>
Oasis Facility - Break Room<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Attilio Regolo：</span><br>
And then, we saw this unusual castle!<br>
It was enormous, but they called it a mirage!<br>
When I tried to approach and touch it, it disappeared into thin air!<br>
That was so disappointing!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Andrea Doria：</span><br>
Oh, my... You experienced a very rare sight, Attilio.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Attilio Regolo：</span><br>
Yeah! Anyway, that's basically my story.<br>
It was fun, but we couldn't find the thing that Marco Polo wanted us to look for...<br>
Mm... I'm thirsty from all of this talking. Drink time!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Gorizia：</span><br>
You went to the Dead Sea, correct...?<br>
There were shipgirls from other factions present, right? How did you get in?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Attilio Regolo：</span><br>
Yeah! So, Marco Polo gave us this incredible device.<br>
When we used it, somehow, we were able to get in without anybody noticing!<br>
But when we got back from the Dead Sea, or whatever, it was awful...<br>
Our clothes and the device were all messed up. It took ages to clean it all.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Andrea Doria：</span><br>
It is the Dead Sea, after all. The salinity is so high that it causes equipment to rust in no time.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Attilio Regolo：</span><br>
But in the end, everything worked out just fine.<br>
After that, I came to this garrison, and here we are!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Gorizia：</span><br>
I had no idea you'd gone to the Dead Sea...<br>
But you were there searching for something, weren't you?<br>
Marco Polo didn't complain when you came home with nothing?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Attilio Regolo：</span><br>
Mmm, I thought she'd lecture us, too...<br>
But when she read the report I made for her, she didn't complain at all.<br>
She just thanked us for our hard work and sent us home for maintenance.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Gorizia：</span><br>
I see... That is like her... Huh? You only reported directly to Marco Polo?<br>
None of this involved Veneto or Littorio?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Attilio Regolo：</span><br>
I dunno... Marco Polo said something about the Senate authorizing it, or something?<br>
It all goes over my head.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Gorizia：</span><br>
(It sounds like the rumors of them collecting curios are true...)<br>
(Is this the Senate's strategy, or is it Marco Polo going rogue?)<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Attilio Regolo：</span><br>
Hm? Gorizia? Is something wrong?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Andrea Doria：</span><br>
Ahahaha... That's the same face she made when she saw the expense list for the World Expo.<br>
But I can't imagine it's as shocking as that was—<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Gorizia：</span><br>
Andrea. Did you not promise you wouldn't bring that up again?<br>
Spreading the glory of Sardegna is a lovely thing, but anyone would get a migraine seeing all the zeros on that expense list...<br>
If only we could splurge that much on more romantic, exciting things. Like sightseeing locales!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Andrea Doria：</span><br>
Fair... I'd certainly be happier if we had invested more money into this oasis facility.<br>
Look around us. Oil lamps for lighting, newspapers and radios our only entertainment, surrounded by sand as far as the eye can see...<br>
*sniffle*... I didn't know that this was the life I'd forced upon you all...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Gorizia：</span><br>
Okay, that's enough of that.<br>
But goodness... This sandstorm just won't let up, will it?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Andrea Doria：</span><br>
I recall they used the word "enormous"...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Gorizia：</span><br>
Communications are still down, too.<br>
As for stories... Let's call it for now, shall we? What should we do next?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Andrea Doria：</span><br>
How about we sing?<br>
Gorizia, would you like to go first?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Gorizia：</span><br>
Huh? Why, exactly...?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Andrea Doria：</span><br>
Attilio, would you like to hear Gorizia sing?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Attilio Regolo：</span><br>
Yeah! Gorizia, I want to hear you sing!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Andrea Doria：</span><br>
Hahaha! See?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Gorizia：</span><br>
Come ooon!<br>

Sardegna Fleet Garrison - The Oasis<br>
A few hours after the start of the sandstorm<br>
The sandstorm engulfing the facility seemed unceasing.<br>
The exhausted Attilio had already drifted off into the world of dreams, and Andrea was beginning to yawn suspiciously often.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Andrea Doria：</span><br>
Gorizia, how about we get to bed early tonight?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Gorizia：</span><br>
But aren't you curious about Marco Polo's speech at the upper senate, and all?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Andrea Doria：</span><br>
It's late. I'm sure they're done by now, anyway.<br>
Even if communications were restored, we wouldn't be able to hear it live.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Gorizia：</span><br>
I'm still curious. You don't know for sure, anyway, Andrea.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Andrea Doria：</span><br>
Geez... Look, we'll receive word tomorrow.<br>
Assuming the facility hasn't been buried in sand, that is.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Gorizia：</span><br>
Not being able to join my comrades at such an important time... I don't know if this is good or bad luck.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Andrea Doria：</span><br>
Now, now. Attilio and I are here, too.<br>
We can't help the sandstorm. No matter how much you rush it, it's not going to hurry on your account.<br>
Get some rest and check in the morning. Okay?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Gorizia：</span><br>
Fine... I'll go wash up and get ready for bed.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Andrea Doria：</span><br>
Good. I'll take care of Attilio.<br>
<br>
After Andrea's lecturing, Gorizia relented and left the break room.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Andrea Doria：</span><br>
Phew... I'll just take Attilio to her room...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Radio：</span><br>
*static crackling*<br>
<br>
In the quiet room, the radio suddenly began making noise.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Radio：</span><br>
...Within...<br>
...His Kingdom...<br>
...He hath...<br>
...already come...<br>
<br>
*click*<br>
Andrea returned to the break room and yanked the radio's electric cord from the wall.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Andrea Doria：</span><br>
.........<br>
(I don't know what they're doing, but I can't let the children get involved in this.)<br>
(Marco Polo... Don't lose yourself.)<br>
