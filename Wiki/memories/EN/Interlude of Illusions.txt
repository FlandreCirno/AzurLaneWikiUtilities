<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Air Raid Alarm：</span><br>
*sirens blaring*<br>
<br>
Fire, smoke, destruction. The world is falling apart before my eyes.<br>
Sirens let out piercing wails, metal screeches and cries, bombs whistle through the air.<br>
The holy land of the Iris has been turned into a hellscape.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Strasbourg：</span><br>
This can't be...<br>
<br>
KABOOOM!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Dupleix：</span><br>
Strasbourg! I've finally found you!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">L'Audacieux：</span><br>
*pant*... Are you okay? Please talk to us!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Strasbourg：</span><br>
I'm... okay. I think.<br>
<br>
I try to concentrate, but my mind is a mess, still struggling to think straight.<br>
Even things I should know elude me – like who I am, where I am, and what I'm doing.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Strasbourg：</span><br>
I'm... That's right, I'm Strasbourg, the battlecruiser.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Dupleix：</span><br>
Well, yes?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">L'Audacieux：</span><br>
Is something wrong?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Strasbourg：</span><br>
No, it's fine. Where are we? What's happening?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Dupleix：</span><br>
This is serious, L'Audacieux. I think she's hit her head.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">L'Audacieux：</span><br>
Let's all try to stay calm! Take a deep breath, Strasbourg. Tell me what's the last thing you can remember.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Strasbourg：</span><br>
The last thing...<br>
I remember... setting up a joint exercise, and there was a banquet afterward...<br>
There were flowers, exquisite food, and music...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Dupleix：</span><br>
Stras... That banquet was two days ago.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">L'Audacieux：</span><br>
I see... It's clear that you're very disoriented.<br>
This place is dangerous, and we'll be caught in the crossfire if we don't run! We can talk later!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Strasbourg：</span><br>
We're... going to run away?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Dupleix：</span><br>
Yes, that's what she said. Come on, hurry!<br>
<br>
KABOOOM!<br>
A shell impacts nearby. The explosion sends pebbles flying just past my face, and my memories start to come back one by one.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Strasbourg：</span><br>
The Orthodoxy, the Royal Navy, Iron Blood, the Sardegna Empire... The four major factions were hosting a joint exercise to deepen their bonds.<br>
Then for some reason, we all started fighting each other...<br>
I thought we'd put this petty infighting behind us...<br>
We fled from Kébir, Toulon, and even Mont-Saint-Michel...<br>
How long are we going to keep running?! How long must we keep fighting for?!<br>
<br>
KABOOOM!<br>
My powerless, resentful screaming is drowned out by thunderous cannon fire.<br>
At the same time, the world starts to spin around me.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Strasbourg：</span><br>
*gasp*! *pant*... *pant*...<br>
<br>
Soft sunlight shines through the curtains.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Strasbourg：</span><br>
I'm... in my own room...<br>
I'm still alive... So that was just a bad dream...<br>
A horribly vivid dream, but a dream all the same...<br>
<br>
Strasbourg shakes her head vigorously to try and forget about it, but the memory doesn't want to go away.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Strasbourg：</span><br>
I should have a talk with them...<br>
<br>
Mont-Saint-Michel - Basilica<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">L'Audacieux：</span><br>
As a matter of fact... I had the same dream.<br>
We were all fighting one another while the seas burned around us.<br>
Dupleix and I were running around, trying to rescue people, and that's when we found you.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Dupleix：</span><br>
Maybe it was a stress-induced hallucination... Though the odds of such a coincidence are impossibly low.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Strasbourg：</span><br>
Did you have the same dream?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Dupleix：</span><br>
I did. Exactly the same.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Strasbourg：</span><br>
So all three of us dreamed the same thing... That has to mean something big.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Dupleix：</span><br>
This reminds me of something – the near-superimposition event.<br>
Everyone present at the World Expo at the time reported having the same vision. So, if the same thing is happening here...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Strasbourg：</span><br>
That means there are corrosion entities.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">L'Audacieux：</span><br>
There is nothing to suggest corrosion is taking place. I personally verified that no traces of corrosion were present on the way here.<br>
Taking that out of the picture, the only hint we're left with is that joint exercise. Do either of you know anything about that?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Dupleix：</span><br>
Not a thing, sorry.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Strasbourg：</span><br>
Neither do I.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">L'Audacieux：</span><br>
Then I think we're getting worked up over nothing.<br>
What we witnessed happened during said exercise, so if there won't be an exercise, then there won't be a tragedy.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Dupleix：</span><br>
Maybe, but should we really disregard our dream as one big coincidence?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Strasbourg：</span><br>
There's no way it's as simple as–<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Communicator：</span><br>
BEEP BEEP!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Strasbourg：</span><br>
Huh? A message from Clemenceau?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">L'Audacieux：</span><br>
What does it say?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Strasbourg：</span><br>
"In two days, Cardinal Richelieu will host a joint exercise near Mont-Saint-Michel. Invitations have been sent out to the Royal Navy, Iron Blood, and the Sardegna Empire..."<br>
"In addition to each respective faction's leader, the Commander will also be present. Kindly start preparing to host our guests."<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Dupleix：</span><br>
There it is. The big four coming together for a joint exercise. It's happening.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Strasbourg：</span><br>
Gather everyone and get started on the preparations. I'll inform Clemenceau about our dream.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Dupleix：</span><br>
Very well. Let's hope nothing bad happens...<br>

Iris Orthodoxy - Local Train<br>
Commander's Private Train Car<br>
July 24th<br>
It's been two and a half days since I returned from the Martyrium and got a message from the Eagle Union's top brass.<br>
On day one – that is, when I got the message – there was a follow-up report, stating that "the incident in the Pacific had wrapped up, and a follow-up investigation is being performed."<br>
On day two, all factions received a message prompting them to "concentrate on gathering intel."<br>
And now, I'm faced with all the information that Memphis and her crew have collected.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Hallucinations... Hallucinations... Nightmares... Spontaneous delirium...<br>
A sudden manic episode... Hallucinations... Nightmares... Malfunctions in electronics...<br>
Nightmares... Hallucinations... A shared nightmare... More nightmares...<br>
These unexplained phenomena have also been observed among all factions around the Pacific, not just the Eagle Union.<br>
Is this all the intel we have to work with?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Memphis：</span><br>
As far as verifiable intel goes, yes.<br>
There were tons of rumors, hearsay, and urban legends, but I filtered those out.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Those don't sound worth referencing for our purposes... but they could help me kill some time.<br>
Do me a favor and send those, too. I'll skim them until we reach our destination.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Memphis：</span><br>
Sure. Just a second.<br>
<br>
Memphis fiddles with her device and hits send. A staggering amount of files pop up on my device.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Sheesh, you weren't kidding. It's a lot.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Memphis：</span><br>
Yup. This is how much data you get when we all work together.<br>
<br>
The train tracks produce a rhythmic "thunk-thunk" as we move along. This is the perfect environment for reading some fiction.<br>
Outside the window, the idyllic pastures of summertime Europa continue on and on forever.<br>
I start to reminisce on how fortunate I am to be aboard this train and not sitting in yet another meeting in the Orthodoxy's capital.<br>
If not for the events of yesterday, maybe that's where I'd be now...<br>
July 23rd - Office<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Helena：</span><br>
Commander, we've received an invitation from the Orthodoxy.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
What kind of invitation?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Helena：</span><br>
I think they're inviting you to take part in a joint exercise on their turf.<br>
Here. Feel free to read it yourself.<br>
<br>
Helena hands me a letter adorned with a wax seal.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
"You are hereby invited to the Peace Interlude, a joint exercise between the Iris Orthodoxy, the Royal Navy, Iron Blood, and the Sardegna Empire."<br>
"A train will be sent out for you. Please board it on July 24th."<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Memphis：</span><br>
Since this came completely out of nowhere, I decided to look into it.<br>
Apparently, Richelieu and Elizabeth suddenly drafted this exercise while you were absent earlier.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
(THEY did? Then maybe this is the cover story they came up for me while I was out whale-hunting.)<br>
(Since I returned way sooner than they anticipated, I suppose that means now I HAVE to attend this exercise.)<br>
Well, it's an invitation from our allies. I see no reason to refuse.<br>
I've been craving a break from all these meetings, anyway. Spending some time with the girls will do me good.<br>
<br>
Commander's Private Train Car - The Present<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
You haven't happened to uncover any secret intel about this bizarre incident, have you?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Memphis：</span><br>
Secret intel? You have a funny way of phrasing things sometimes. What do you want to know?<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Anything. Knowledge is power, and I'll take anything you have, be it directly related to the incident or any details about what happened in the Pacific.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Memphis：</span><br>
Sadly, I know no more than you about the incident.<br>
My sources, too, have very little to share. You're better off probing Sara if you want some intel on that.<br>
As for the event in the Pacific... I don't really have anything on that, either.<br>
Oh, wait, I do know one thing. This happened around when Elizabeth dragged you off to... wherever she did.<br>
Anyway, the Sakura Empire had a sudden change of attitude.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
"Change of attitude"? In regards to what?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Memphis：</span><br>
The Azur Lane's reform. Their leaders must've finally worked something out, because now they're in favor of the idea.<br>
I've also heard they sent out lavish gifts to many factions...<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
So the Sakura Empire has adopted a more positive attitude. That's great.<br>
(Although, I don't like how sudden this 180 was. I'll have to ask Shinano about it later.)<br>
<br>
*knock knock*<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Memphis：</span><br>
Who is it?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Guichen：</span><br>
Guichen, your humble witch. Cardinal Richelieu has invited you to join her for lunch.<br>
She said she understands if you're otherwise busy, though.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
I'd be happy to, there's just one thing...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Guichen：</span><br>
Don't worry, we'll have meals delivered to your companions as well.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Memphis：</span><br>
That's so kind of you. Personally, I'll stay here and enjoy the view. You go enjoy your lunch, Commander.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Helena：</span><br>
The rest of us will be fine! Have a nice time.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
(Hmm. This exercise isn't just for a change of pace. She must have some ulterior motive.)<br>
(Regardless, I'll hear what she has to say.)<br>

<br>
Iris Orthodoxy - Local Train<br>
Commander's Private Train Car<br>
July 24th<br>
A gust of appetizing aromas greets me as soon as I open the train car door.<br>
Smells like Sardegnian food is on the menu today.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Richelieu：</span><br>
Thank you for joining me, Commander. Please, have a seat.<br>
<br>
Stepping inside, I find Richelieu and Elizabeth sitting opposite each other. Next to Elizabeth, there's Veneto, and next to Richelieu is an empty chair.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
(I'm assuming that one's meant for me.)<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Vittorio Veneto：</span><br>
It's been a long time since we last met on a pleasant occasion such as this.<br>
I'm glad to be leaving those conference rooms and meeting venues behind, for a change.<br>
Also, all the food you see here was prepared by me, using only the finest of our local ingredients. I hope it'll be to your taste.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
(Why does it feel less like Richelieu wanted to speak to me and more like she wanted me to speak with Veneto?)<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Queen Elizabeth：</span><br>
Yes, your cuisine is renowned throughout all of Europa, and clearly for good reason.<br>
Servant, help yourself. Don't be shy now.<br>
Nom... I should instruct my maids to take notes on this. Some variety would be much welcome in my diet.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
(Sounds like Elizabeth came here solely to eat, meanwhile... Speaking of which, I'm hungry. Let's dig in.)<br>
<br>
I join the girls at the table, savoring the food and engaging in some chitchat.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Vittorio Veneto：</span><br>
Really, Sardegna owes you so much, Commander. You prevented a disaster at the World Expo, and you helped us get our foot in the door at the conference.<br>
This lunch alone will by no means repay you for everything, but I hope it can serve as a gesture of our goodwill.<br>
To let us pay our debt in full, will you consider paying a formal visit to Sardegna?<br>
We will do everything in our capacity to ensure you have an unforgettable Roman holiday.<br>
<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项1：Thank you. I'll definitely visit when I can.</span>'''''<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项2：I'll have to think about it.</span>'''''<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Queen Elizabeth：</span><br>
Oi! You're not going to Sardegna without me and an entourage of Royal Maids!<br>
I've almost exclusively eaten Orthodoxy cuisine lately and I've forgotten how delicious Sardegna's is. Take me with you!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Vittorio Veneto：</span><br>
We'd be honored to have you as a guest, Your Majesty. I assure you you'll be given our best hospitality.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Queen Elizabeth：</span><br>
Excellent!<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
(She really has nothing but food on her mind...)<br>
(It's odd how quiet Richelieu has been this whole time. She's the one who invited me, so doesn't she have anything to say?)<br>
(Now's a good time to segue into the topic we've all been dancing around.)<br>
So, what are your thoughts on this joint exercise, ladies? Tell you the truth, I've got a question about it.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Richelieu：</span><br>
And what might that be?<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Well, I know you had to come up with something on account of me returning sooner than you expected...<br>
But did it have to be so large-scale? A four-faction joint exercise is a pretty big deal.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Queen Elizabeth：</span><br>
We're doing this because I want to. What more reason do you need?<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
None, if we're talking from an outsider's perspective. Personally, though, I want to know why.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Queen Elizabeth：</span><br>
Hmm?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Richelieu：</span><br>
I understand your curiosity. There is indeed another reason for it.<br>
I imagine you've already heard about the Sakura Empire's recent activity. This seemed like a good time for all of Europa to spring into action, and so, we came up with this exercise.<br>
Admittedly, we pushed it out the door with little fanfare or buildup...<br>
Regardless, we hope it will show the world how solidarity between shipgirls looks when the four of us work together.<br>
In addition, many things will be easier in the future if we're able to prove that Europa can come together as one.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
(Sounds like an offensive-defensive alliance. It would give us a lot of leeway both during advances and retreats.)<br>
(If the Azur Lane is reformed, it would significantly amplify the influence held by the factions of Europa.)<br>
(Furthermore, if the reform fails, they have a backup plan in the shape of a Europan alliance. They don't strictly need the banner of the Azur Lane to move forward.)<br>
And that's why you came up with the Peace Interlude. I get it now. It holds a lot of symbolic meaning.<br>
On a related note, where's Bismarck? Is she not here?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Queen Elizabeth：</span><br>
She'll catch up with us at the exercise area.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Richelieu：</span><br>
I believe she thought the directness of that route would be more convenient.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
(And yet, she was nowhere to be seen at the conference, observing from afar the whole time.)<br>
(Interesting how she'll be present in person this time.)<br>
(This Europan alliance might just work out...)<br>
(Imagine that. A brand new player on the world stage.)<br>
<br>
And so, our laid-back luncheon aboard the train continues.<br>

<br>
Iris Orthodoxy - Mont-Saint-Michel<br>
Peace Interlude Exercise Area<br>
July 25th<br>
Clear skies, calm waters. The faction flags of Europa flutter in the wind above Mont-Saint-Michel.<br>
Shipgirls and mass-produced ships have both gotten into position and await orders. The Peace Interlude is about to begin.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Dupleix：</span><br>
Ugh... It took some ruthless all-nighters, but we got done in the nick of time...<br>
At least we didn't run into any real trouble along the way.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Strasbourg：</span><br>
You deserve a medal, Dupleix.<br>
We can't celebrate yet, though. This is where things really kick off.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Dupleix：</span><br>
I know, I know. I just needed a little break before continuing.<br>
Whew... Now it's time to focus on the exercise itself.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">L'Audacieux：</span><br>
It seems this will be a round-robin competition with each of the factions taking turns between attacking and defending. Interestingly, there is no ranking system in place.<br>
Though, I suppose there's no reason to have one. This is, after all, just an exhibition tournament meant to deepen bonds.<br>
You'd think shooting at each other rather than a designated target would have the opposite effect, though...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Dupleix：</span><br>
You're looking at it the wrong way.<br>
Fighting fellow shipgirls lets you figure out your own strengths and weaknesses, no?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">L'Audacieux：</span><br>
You have a point. Anyway, we should start setting off.<br>
Our fleet is up first, AND Cardinal Richelieu is watching. We must give it our all.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Strasbourg：</span><br>
......<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">L'Audacieux：</span><br>
What's the matter?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Strasbourg：</span><br>
Oh, nothing. I was just lost in thought.<br>
L'Audacieux's right. Psych yourselves up and let's show them the Orthodoxy's glory.<br>
<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Hermione ：</span><br>
Good day to you, ladies.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Strasbourg：</span><br>
Good day to you as well. Welcome to Mont-Saint-Michel.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Hermione ：</span><br>
I've heard so much about this grand Basilica. Seeing it with my own two eyes now, I can say it's every bit as splendid as they say!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Strasbourg：</span><br>
It is quite the sight. I'm glad to hear you're so fond of it.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Dido：</span><br>
Ahem. Hermione, that's enough small talk.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Hermione ：</span><br>
Oh, right! Do forgive me.<br>
Then without further ado, let's begin, ladies.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Strasbourg：</span><br>
Of course. Good luck.<br>
<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Sirius：</span><br>
Congratulations. We admit defeat.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">L'Audacieux：</span><br>
You fought admirably. It's no wonder they speak so highly of you Royal Maids.<br>
We've gained a better understanding of our strengths and weaknesses thanks to you. I look forward to fighting you again with our roles reversed.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Dido：</span><br>
Likewise. It will be an honour to face you again.<br>
<br>
The Royal Navy fleet regrouped, then withdrew from the exercise area.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Strasbourg：</span><br>
Whew... Great work, girls.<br>
Catch your breaths, then we'll go and meet Iron Blood.<br>
<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Köln (Retrofit)：</span><br>
I'm afraid this is as far as you'll get.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Strasbourg：</span><br>
That's a lot of retrofits you've got. I didn't see any of that on the invitee list.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Köln (Retrofit)：</span><br>
Perhaps not the retrofit part, but we are on the list. It's not like it's against the rules.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">L'Audacieux：</span><br>
I've heard the Royal Navy is deploying retrofitted girls in batches. It seems you had the same idea.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Z23 (Retrofit)：</span><br>
Yes, though we've never fought together as a fleet before, so this will be a first for us.<br>
Still, we won't hold anything back, and I hope you won't either!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">L'Audacieux：</span><br>
Well said! Let's go!<br>
<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Dupleix：</span><br>
All our forces have either been neutralized or suffered heavy damage... That was a very close match.<br>
What's more... it looks like they earned slightly more points than us.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">L'Audacieux：</span><br>
It really is remarkable what a force multiplier a retrofit is. Especially when you concentrate them into a single team.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Leipzig (Retrofit)：</span><br>
I-I mean, you were all really strong, too...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Köln (Retrofit)：</span><br>
Now we should all catch our breaths for a bit. It'll be exciting to see how you fare in the rematch.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Strasbourg：</span><br>
Same. We'll get you next time for sure.<br>
<br>
The Iron Blood fleet regrouped, then pulled out of the exercise area.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Dupleix：</span><br>
Up next – Sardegna. They'll be our last opponent on the defensive.<br>
I know there's nothing on the line, but I would like at least two victories today.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">L'Audacieux：</span><br>
Remember that this is an exhibition tournament. Winning or losing isn't what matters.<br>
You don't want to shoot your bolt too soon, or the next three battles as the defenders will be a struggle.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Strasbourg：</span><br>
She's right. Recharge your batteries, then we'll face off against Sardegna.<br>
<br>
<br>
*snap*!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Alfredo Oriani：</span><br>
A picture's worth a thousand words! I call this, "The Orthodoxy's Fleet Sails Against the Wind."<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Pompeo Magno：</span><br>
Whoa! Look how cool they look! You might win a Pulitzer for this one!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Alfredo Oriani：</span><br>
I reckon so, too!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Strasbourg：</span><br>
You're... a journalist?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Alfredo Oriani：</span><br>
Not JUST a journalist – I'm also one of your opponents! Name's Alfredo Oriani. This is Captain Pompey, and that's Giuseppe Garibaldi.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Giuseppe Garibaldi：</span><br>
Greetings.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Pompeo Magno：</span><br>
Prepare yourself, challengers! The great Captain Pompey shall take you on!<br>
Draw your swords and show me your shimmering blades!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">L'Audacieux：</span><br>
Excuse me?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Pompeo Magno：</span><br>
Come on, surely you know what I mean? Don't your Cardinal and Fighting Angels make their weapons glow when they attack?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">L'Audacieux：</span><br>
You mean... like this?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Pompeo Magno：</span><br>
Yes, just like that!<br>
<br>
*snap*!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Alfredo Oriani：</span><br>
Beautiful. "The Templar Knight Unveils Her Radiant Sword." Another one for the collection!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Strasbourg：</span><br>
Could you take this at least a LITTLE seriously?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Dupleix：</span><br>
Also, aren't YOU the challengers here? You're in Orthodoxy waters, so...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Pompeo Magno：</span><br>
Well said! But enough words! It's time to do battle!<br>
<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Strasbourg：</span><br>
Were you even trying?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Pompeo Magno：</span><br>
I've been vanquished! How could this be?!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Alfredo Oriani：</span><br>
Man, that was a really close one! Talk about unstoppable force meeting immovable object!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Dupleix：</span><br>
I mean, the scoreboard says we beat you by a landslide.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Alfredo Oriani：</span><br>
Hey, it's not about winning or losing! It's about the friends we made along the way!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Giuseppe Garibaldi：</span><br>
Alright, Alfredo. You lost your first battle, so it's back to school with you.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Alfredo Oriani：</span><br>
No, wait! I lost on purpose, okay? I'll get serious in the next battle, promise!<br>
I've even got a foolproof secret plan!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">L'Audacieux：</span><br>
Secret plan? You've piqued my curiosity.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Alfredo Oriani：</span><br>
Oh, you're gonna love it! Just be patient and you'll see!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Strasbourg：</span><br>
Uh-huh. I'm looking forward to it.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Alfredo Oriani：</span><br>
As you should. See you later!<br>
<br>
The Sardegnian fleet regrouped, then left the exercise area behind.<br>
And so, the Iris Orthodoxy's turn as the attacking side concluded. Now it was time to play defense.<br>

<br>
Iris Orthodoxy - Mont-Saint-Michel<br>
Basilica - Commander's Quarters<br>
July 25th<br>
From the Basilica, I watch the exercise unfold through multiple drones in the air.<br>
The footage is sent to my device, processed by my tactical analysis system, and relayed to me in real time.<br>
The Orthodoxy and Iron Blood are fighting at the moment, and they are neck and neck.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Memphis：</span><br>
That's the power of retrofits for you. Retrofit a cruiser and put it up against a battlecruiser from the same era and the former will give the latter a run for her money.<br>
I hope the Eagle Union put together a retrofit-focused fleet of their own.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
(In that regard, retrofits and Type II's aren't THAT dissimilar.)<br>
(Well, strictly in terms of increasing combat potential. Retrofitting and developing augment modules are significantly less resource-intensive than creating a Type II...)<br>
(Hmm? Is that... Strasbourg?)<br>
(I've heard about her – in equal parts about her combat ability and her musical talent.)<br>
(She looks pretty nervous. It's like she's not focusing entirely on the battle.)<br>
(Maybe she's got performance anxiety from knowing Richelieu is spectating.)<br>
<br>
*knock knock*<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Helena：</span><br>
Who is it?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Brünhilde：</span><br>
I have a message from Bismarck. She says she'd like you to come and watch the exercise with her.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
(Ah. I've been waiting for that invitation, though I expected it to come in a more roundabout way.)<br>
Sure thing. Lead the way.<br>
<br>
Basilica - Bismarck's Quarters<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Bismarck：</span><br>
Hello, Commander. Make yourself at home.<br>
<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项1：It's been a while.</span>'''''<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项2：Thanks. You get comfortable too, alright?</span>'''''<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Bismarck：</span><br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项1）</span>'''''Yes, it has. We haven't spoken since the battle in the Antarctic.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Bismarck：</span><br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项2）</span>'''''Of course. This is an informal meeting and I'm happy to let go of the formalities.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
I see you're not in your Zwei rigging. Is something wrong with Geryon?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Bismarck：</span><br>
Oh. No, Geryon is fine, and my Zwei rigging works as normal.<br>
I'm only in this form to express my desire for peace. Personal image, too, matters in politics.<br>
Let's not forget that we're on Orthodoxy land as well.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Dressed for peace, but geared up to win the tournament. I think that sends mixed signals.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Bismarck：</span><br>
You have the wrong idea.<br>
This event is meant to deepen interfactional bonds. Not showing my hand to some degree invites unwelcome speculation. You must think the same, no?<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Yeah, you are showing your hand – but not JUST in the name of deepening bonds, am I right?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Bismarck：</span><br>
If it was only about bonds, I wouldn't be here in person. I'm keeping my options open for an alliance.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
A Europan offensive-defensive alliance, perhaps?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Bismarck：</span><br>
Sharp as ever.<br>
Our war with the Sirens – or at least, our war with their experiment subdivision – is coming to a close. I must start planning for what comes next.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
The reforming of the Azur Lane, in other words.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Bismarck：</span><br>
That's one thing, yes, but not the only one.<br>
If simply coming together would've let the Azur Lane flourish, the Crimson Axis wouldn't have come into being.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Things have changed, though. Now we share a common enemy.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Bismarck：</span><br>
We did back then, too.<br>
You're here, talking to me precisely because you don't believe a conference in the Orthodoxy will be enough to reform the Azur Lane, are you not?<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Correct. We don't just need the members of Azur Lane, we need ALL factions to come together and face the future – to fight on a truly united front.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Bismarck：</span><br>
Does this alliance NEED to be called "Azur Lane"?<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
"Azur Lane" is more than just a name. It is an idea and a legacy.<br>
Whatever form the alliance takes, I insist on this name.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Bismarck：</span><br>
I understand where you're coming from. Thanks for being honest with me.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Pardon? I thought you were testing me here.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Bismarck：</span><br>
Not at all. I simply wanted to watch the exercise and have a chat with you.<br>
Though, one thing sticks out to me – you didn't object when I said that our war with the Sirens has all but come to an end.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
I don't necessarily disagree. Don't get me wrong, they are still powerful foes and there's much we don't know about them.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Bismarck：</span><br>
On the other hand, we've eliminated Compiler and even figured out where Observer – their leader – keeps her mainframe.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Exactly. We're perfectly capable of destroying it even in an all-out frontal assault if we can all just band together.<br>
Once their general's out of the picture, the rest of the elites will be easy pickings without anyone to command them.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Bismarck：</span><br>
That is true. So, how are you going to do it?<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
What do you mean?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Bismarck：</span><br>
Will you wait for a chance then crush them once and for all? Or will you show them some mercy?<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
No way. Letting them run wild is out of the question.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Bismarck：</span><br>
I knew you'd say that. Yes, THAT'S off the table.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Your tone suggests you had something else in mind.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Bismarck：</span><br>
There's eliminating them once and for all, and then there's using them to our advantage. But there's a third option – allying with them.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
You and I both know that's ridiculous.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Bismarck：</span><br>
Ridiculous, but possible. You know where I'm coming from.<br>
The Sirens – or should I say, Antiochus – were created for the purpose of fighting the enemy known as the X.<br>
If we can recruit them to our side, our fighting odds against the X will improve noticeably.<br>
You've not told me much about the X, but they must be quite a powerful threat, no?<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
I'll consider your idea, at the very least.<br>
(Following my encounter with the mimic entities in the Martyrium, Helena META suggested a temporary intel ban for those who witnessed the entities.)<br>
(In light of the threat the X poses and its potential for conceptual corrosion, all parties agreed to it.)<br>
(However, this means I can only share the absolute minimum of intel about the X with everyone, which I'm definitely not happy about.)<br>
I want to stress that the X really is just that dangerous. The more you describe it, the likelier it gets that it will appear.<br>
One day, though – I promise to tell you everything one day.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Bismarck：</span><br>
Don't worry about it. Richelieu and Elizabeth have told me plenty about how dangerous intel about them is.<br>
Continue your investigation at your own pace. I assure you that Iron Blood will not proactively pursue this matter.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Communicator：</span><br>
BEEP BEEP!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Bismarck：</span><br>
A message from Memphis? Surely she's not worrying that I've done anything to you.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
No, it's just about work. I should probably get going, though.<br>
Before I do, one more thing...<br>
I have something to tell you in an official capacity as the Commander of the Azur Lane.<br>
The leaders of the Azur Lane want to issue a formal reminder to Iron Blood.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Bismarck：</span><br>
Go on.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
They request that you remember the agreements you have struck in the past and that you perform your obligations.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Bismarck：</span><br>
Of course. Iron Blood will follow through on promises made and is working on liberating occupied Reenactment areas.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
A surprisingly concise answer. I wasn't expecting that.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Bismarck：</span><br>
For the sake of the reform, we're willing to go above and beyond to demonstrate our sincerity and will to cooperate.<br>
Besides, this is necessary for Iron Blood to finally, truly break free from the Sirens' shackles.<br>
Not only that – it's also necessary for our world to face the future.<br>
We will not back down, and we will not fold under pressure.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Thank you. Now I've got something to tell the powers that be.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Bismarck：</span><br>
Heehee. By all means, tell them.<br>
Now that we've come to this point, it's clear that something big is going to happen in the world, and soon.<br>
All the factions have already begun secretly preparing for what's to come, be it good or bad.<br>
Oh, one more thing before you go – we came here with an envoy from the Kingdom of Tulipa.<br>
Yes, Tulipa. The land that for the longest time hasn't had any shipgirls in its military.<br>
There will be a party once this exercise has concluded. Why don't you come along and meet the representative?<br>

<br>
Iris Orthodoxy - Mont-Saint-Michel<br>
Banquet Hall<br>
July 25th<br>
Slow music fills the hall, furnished with classical Orthodoxy ornamentation. Members of all factions are present at the party.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Queen Elizabeth：</span><br>
Hmph... As much as I hate to admit it, this food is pretty good.<br>
You lot have prepared quite the party, considering how little time you had.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Vittorio Veneto：</span><br>
Yes. You really get the feeling that they pulled all the stops out.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Richelieu：</span><br>
Thank you. I'm humbled. With so many factions in attendance, I wouldn't dare give my guests anything less than the best.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Who's that playing the music? Strasbourg?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Richelieu：</span><br>
Indeed. I actually wanted her to relax at the party, since she worked so hard setting up the exercise...<br>
However, she insisted that playing music is her way of relaxing, and wouldn't back down.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
I see.<br>
<br>
Strasbourg's music flows through the banquet hall like the water of a crystal-clear river.<br>
The weariness I saw in her expression earlier today is nowhere to be seen now.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
I can tell she's been working really hard. Her efforts have really brought this banquet to the next level.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Richelieu：</span><br>
Heehee. I'm sure she'd be overjoyed to hear you say that.<br>
I know you're a busy person, but for now, try to forget all your troubles and enjoy yourself, okay?<br>
<br>
Commander's Private Room - Nighttime<br>
*knock knock*<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Strasbourg：</span><br>
Cardinal Richelieu told me to come, so... Do you have a minute, Commander?<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Strasbourg? Did something happen to her?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Strasbourg：</span><br>
No. It's about me.<br>
I, and everyone else at Mont-Saint-Michel had the exact same nightmare just a while ago.<br>
I've been told you know a lot about dreams. Then there's the fact that people all across the Pacific have been experiencing phenomena involving nightmares...<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
I've heard about that. How long ago was the nightmare?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Strasbourg：</span><br>
Just two days ago.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
(Two days... Today's the 25th, so then it happened on the 23rd.)<br>
(And the report concerning the Pacific came in on the 22nd...)<br>
(Similar phenomena were reported across Europa in the days leading up to the World Expo... but this time, it's being reported in the Pacific. How's it reaching all the way over here?)<br>
Anyway, come in. We'll talk inside.<br>
<br>
Sometime later...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Strasbourg：</span><br>
And that's the long and short of it.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
(They ALL had the same nightmare about a disaster happening in this exercise...)<br>
(Yeah. There's no way this is a coincidence.)<br>
Thanks for telling me about this.<br>
I saw you were a bit out of it during the exercise. You were thinking about this, weren't you?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Strasbourg：</span><br>
Ah... So you noticed. Nothing escapes you, I suppose.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
You're a real fighter, you know. Working this hard with something so heavy weighing on your mind.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Strasbourg：</span><br>
Ahem... Well, thank you for the compliment.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
You must be exhausted. I say call it for today and get some sleep. I'll investigate this, meanwhile.<br>
And if you have another nightmare, come see me and I'll make you feel better.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Strasbourg：</span><br>
Thanks for being so considerate. I wish you sweet dreams.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
(When it comes to dreams, nobody knows better than Shinano.)<br>
(I heard she's here at Mont-Saint-Michel. I'll go talk to her.)<br>

{{折叠面板|标题=The Secret of the Basilica|选项=7|主框=1|样式=primary|展开=是}}
<br>
Iris Orthodoxy - Mont-Saint-Michel<br>
Sakura Empire Waiting Room<br>
July 25th<br>
I find Shinano as I enter the waiting room. She's getting ready to leave.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Shinano ：</span><br>
This one was just about to go searching for you... Coincidences are curious things...<br>
Have you something to discuss?<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Yeah, but you go first. What were you going to tell me?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Shinano ：</span><br>
Very well... Ever since arriving here, this one has felt a strange sense of familiarity.<br>
It would seem that this Basilica holds a fragment of the Watatsumi.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
What? A fragment of a Sakuran relic? On Orthodoxy land?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Shinano ：</span><br>
Indeed... I am likely able to sense its presence thanks to this ornament, for it, too, is made of a Watatsumi fragment...<br>
However, its precise location eludes this one...<br>
<br>
As she says that, she produces an emerald magatama – a jewel shaped like a comma – with a cherry blossom design carved distinctly on the front.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
I see... Then there's a quick way to see if it's true or not.<br>
Let's give Clemenceau a call. She should still be up.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Communicator：</span><br>
BEEP BEEP!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Clemenceau：</span><br>
Ah, if it isn't Shinano and the Commander. Is there a problem?<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Not a problem, strictly speaking. I just wanted to ask you something.<br>
Is there a fragment of the Watatsumi inside the Basilica at Mont-Saint-Michel?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Clemenceau：</span><br>
Ooh. Bravo, Commander. You caught on to the Basilica's biggest secret right on day one.<br>
How did you know?<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
So there IS one here... I don't deserve credit for figuring it out. Shinano did – she says she sensed it.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Clemenceau：</span><br>
"Sensed it"... Now that's interesting.<br>
I'll be frank – apparently, we were once in talks with the Sakurans about sharing technology with one another.<br>
They handed us that Watatsumi fragment as part of the proceedings.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Bismarck said something to that tune, too. Was Sardegna at the discussion table as well?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Clemenceau：</span><br>
No, not really. Not to my knowledge.<br>
It's possible they were, but it was before my time. But, as you know, the Tribunal wasn't always the king of intelligence.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Fair enough. Shinano, do YOU know anything?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Shinano ：</span><br>
This one... was never even aware the Watatsumi had been part of any transaction...<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
That's alright. Your long slumbers don't allow you to be everywhere.<br>
(Maybe Veneto knows something.)<br>
(Although, the Sardegnians have a tendency for working on their own... If Sardegna DID discuss sharing technologies, there's a good chance Veneto was never told about it.)<br>
(She had no idea about Marco Polo's plot to superimpose the world, for example.)<br>
(And Marco... She still hasn't awoken from her slumber.)<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Clemenceau：</span><br>
If it's that important, shall I get the Tribunal on the case?<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
No need to. I was just wondering.<br>
Anyway, I've said all I wanted to. Sorry for calling you so late. Go get some sleep now.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Clemenceau：</span><br>
Heehee. You too.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Shinano ：</span><br>
Wait... Clemenceau, may this one see the fragment tomorrow?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Clemenceau：</span><br>
That can be arranged. I'll work something out with Strasbourg.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Shinano ：</span><br>
Much obliged...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Communicator：</span><br>
BEEP BEEP!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Shinano ：</span><br>
Thank you, for doing me this kindness... Now, what did you have to discuss?<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Well, it's about dreams...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Shinano ：</span><br>
Nightmares... Again...<br>
This one, too, beheld a nightmare yesternight.<br>
In it, the future I had witnessed was engulfed in flames, falling apart... 'tis an ill omen that a tremendous event is coming.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
A tremendous event... Then we've got to be ready for it.<br>
Can you show me your dream directly?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Shinano ：</span><br>
No... This one hasn't dreamt ever since that vision...<br>
Worse yet, it seems I have lost my ability to weave dreams...<br>
As it stands currently, I am afraid I can be of little use to you...<br>
However, I can ask Musashi... Perchance she can help you. Shall I?<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Yes, please.<br>
(When Shinano saw that dream, did she...? No, she wouldn't know either.)<br>
(She says it's a bad omen, and with all these nightmares across the Pacific, I really do think a disaster is around the corner.)<br>
(And Helena META is busy trying to stabilize Rodney. I can't rely on anyone else this time.)<br>
(Now the question is... what do I do?)<br>

<br>
A purple sky hung overhead while corrosion entities covered the land in white as far as the eye could see. This was a dream – a dream of the World Expo.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Dupleix：</span><br>
Strasbourg, the Cardinal's fleet is manipulating conceptual anchors and securing a path to the holy capital.<br>
Also, Lady Clemenceau has told us to cleanse Mont-Saint-Michel and activate the conceptual anchors.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Strasbourg：</span><br>
Well, ladies, this day has finally come.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">L'Audacieux：</span><br>
At long last!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Strasbourg：</span><br>
And the timing couldn't be any better.<br>
We'll tear down the old world and forge a new path for ourselves.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">L'Audacieux：</span><br>
Yes. A new path for a unified Orthodoxy.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Dupleix：</span><br>
Vichyan fleets across the country are contacting the Cardinal one by one. Should we follow suit?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Strasbourg：</span><br>
No. We won't.<br>
Lady Clemenceau's orders are only to cleanse the Basilica and activate the anchors.<br>
Which is what we'll do now.<br>
<br>
KABOOOM!<br>
Just like then, Strasbourg carved a way forward, cutting down strange foes along the way. Though calm on the surface, her heart was in discord.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Strasbourg：</span><br>
I don't understand... The closer I get to the Basilica, the stronger my feelings get...<br>
Joy, anger, happiness, regret... Why am I feeling these things?<br>
We did as ordered and split up, then regrouped, restarted, and returned to where we should be...<br>
No... That's it, isn't it? I wasn't strong enough...<br>
If only I were stronger, I could've fought back against these Reenactments and averted that blight upon our motherland...<br>
If only this day had come sooner...<br>
If only things were different, I'd be free of this regret and hopelessness...<br>
<br>
All of a sudden, the corrosion-covered Basilica began to glow like the sun, as though it heard her plight.<br>
The holy light purged the corrosion, restoring the night sky to its calm dark blue color.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Strasbourg：</span><br>
It's... gone! Did the guardian saints of the Holy Iris hear my wish?<br>
It's still not enough, though... More must be done to lift the eternal night over the Orthodoxy!<br>
I must reach it... I must go faster!<br>
<br>
She raised her engine speed and disappeared into the light.<br>
The curtains rose on a dream of Kébir – where light and dark intersected.<br>
<span style="color:#ff9b93;">Hood：</span><br>
I do hope that you understand the reason we are here today.<br>
The Royal Navy would like your cooperation in halting the advances of Iron Blood.<br>
I shall give you four options.<br>
First: Leave with us right now, and enlist in the Royal Navy in our fight against Iron Blood and the Crimson Axis.<br>
Second: Completely disarm. In return, the Royal Navy shall offer safe harbor for all of you.<br>
Third: Allow us to escort you to the Eagle Union, where they shall disarm you.<br>
Or, the final option we would rather not see: Sink right here and now.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Dunkerque：</span><br>
...Is this your ultimatum? And what if all your options are unacceptable to us?<br>
<span style="color:#ff9b93;">Hood：</span><br>
Then I hope you won't take it personally when we simply follow the orders we were given... and disarm you forcefully.<br>
I hope that you can reconsider and join our fight, and that you'll make the right choice.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Dunkerque：</span><br>
......<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Strasbourg：</span><br>
What nonsense. Dunkerque, we must NOT yield to them.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Dunkerque：</span><br>
Agreed. We will fight to the end, no matter how poor our odds are.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Strasbourg：</span><br>
Yeah. To the bitter end.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">▇▇▇▇▇：</span><br>
You seem to be in trouble, ladies.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Strasbourg：</span><br>
Who are you?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Dunkerque：</span><br>
I never wanted you to get dragged into this, ▇▇▇▇▇. I'm sorry.<br>
You aren't a knight and have no obligation to fight by our side. You should evacuate by land, quickly.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Strasbourg：</span><br>
(What? Who's "▇▇▇▇▇"?)<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">▇▇▇▇▇：</span><br>
No. I will not turn my back on you, knowing you're faced with such a dilemma.<br>
There is another way. The perfect option to get you out of this difficult situation.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Dunkerque：</span><br>
Really? Please, ▇▇▇▇▇, tell me what it is!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">▇▇▇▇▇：</span><br>
Drive them back with a show of force. Don't forget that I've not come alone this time.<br>
<br>
With booming rumbles, one massive ship after the next appeared out of the dock, cutting a wedge between the Royal Navy and Vichya Dominion forces.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Strasbourg：</span><br>
(What are these pitch-black ships? Have they been here all along?)<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">▇▇▇▇▇：</span><br>
I brought them here as part of our agreement to share technology. Surely you remember that, Strasbourg?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Strasbourg：</span><br>
Oh... Right. Yeah, that happened.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">▇▇▇▇▇：</span><br>
Yes. We all know that happened.<br>
Dunkerque, what do you believe our odds of victory are against their H Fleet if we combine our forces?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Dunkerque：</span><br>
I think we'll stand a fighting chance.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">▇▇▇▇▇：</span><br>
And you, Hood? What are your thoughts on this?<br>
<span style="color:#ff9b93;">Hood：</span><br>
You've made a grave mistake today, ▇▇▇▇▇ of the Sakura Empire. We will not forget this.<br>
Ladies, let us retreat.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">▇▇▇▇▇：</span><br>
Have a safe voyage home. Heehee.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Strasbourg：</span><br>
I don't understand... My head... I'm so confused...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">▇▇▇▇▇：</span><br>
Is something the matter? You've been acting quite disoriented.<br>
The Royal Navy is gone. What more do you have to worry about?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Strasbourg：</span><br>
Nothing, really, it's just...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">▇▇▇▇▇：</span><br>
"Just" what? Oh, I understand. Heehee. You had a nightmare last night, didn't you?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Strasbourg：</span><br>
Nightmare...?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Dunkerque：</span><br>
The Templar Knights are loyal to our Cardinal and to our faith. We will not take orders from anyone else.<br>
And that includes the Iron Blood as well as the Empire. We shall never allow ourselves to become the instruments of their aggression.<br>
It is clear to me how cynical your "alliance" is.<br>
Our official response is this: "The Royal Navy is not trustworthy. We will fight until our last breath."<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Jean Bart：</span><br>
They already made their intentions clear to us with what they did to Dunkerque and the others.<br>
While I draw breath, I will never allow us to bow before such hypocrites!<br>
The Vichya Dominion is about to draw its last breath...<br>
We are surrounded by vultures ready to devour us. But what of it?<br>
The proud Templar Knights shall never bow their heads! So that we may never become puppets, I hereby order all of you to sink!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Strasbourg：</span><br>
Now I remember... That nightmare...<br>
It lasted for so, so long...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">▇▇▇▇▇：</span><br>
Fortunately, you're awake now.<br>
All nightmares, even the most haunting ones, go away when you wake up.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Strasbourg：</span><br>
You're right. I'm awake now, and everything is fine...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">▇▇▇▇▇：</span><br>
Precisely. Now, shall we go? I'm quite excited to hear your performance at the banquet later tonight.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Strasbourg：</span><br>
Of course. The last thing I'll do is disappoint the Commander.<br>

Local Train - Commander's Private Train Car<br>
July 25th<br>
The periodic clanking of the train's wheels slows down bit by bit. Finally, the whistle rings, signaling our arrival at the station.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Helena：</span><br>
Commander. Wake up. We've arrived.<br>
<br>
I open my eyes... but everything is still pitch black.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
(Am I wearing a sleep mask?)<br>
<br>
I remove the blindfold with my hand. Looking out the window, I see a magnificent Basilica come into view.<br>
<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项1：Where'd this mask come from?</span>'''''<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Memphis：</span><br>
I put it on you.<br>
You talked big about how you were gonna get so much work done on the train, then you closed your eyes and dozed off instantly.<br>
I figured you needed your beauty sleep, so I covered your eyes for you.<br>
<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项1：Thanks. I slept like a log.</span>'''''<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项2：But what about my work backlog?!</span>'''''<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Memphis：</span><br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项1）</span>'''''You're welcome. A secretary has to know when to do these things.<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项1）</span>'''''Knowing you slept well is the best I could ask for.<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项1）</span>'''''Now, get your things in order. We've got an exercise to be at!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Memphis：</span><br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项2）</span>'''''You really are a workaholic through and through, talking about work the moment you wake up...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Helena：</span><br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项2）</span>'''''Yes, Memphis, we've heard this before...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Memphis：</span><br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项2）</span>'''''Whatever! I already did your work anyway, so just forget about it!<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项2）</span>'''''Now, get ready to disembark. We've got an exercise to be at!<br>
<br>

July 25th<br>
From the Basilica, I watch the exercise unfold through multiple drones in the air.<br>
The footage is sent to my device, processed by my tactical analysis system, and relayed to me in real time.<br>
The Orthodoxy and Iron Blood are fighting at the moment, and they are neck and neck.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Memphis：</span><br>
That's the power of retrofits for you. Retrofit a cruiser and put it up against a battlecruiser from the same era and the former will give the latter a run for her money.<br>
I hope the Eagle Union put together a retrofit-focused fleet of their own.<br>
<br>
*knock knock*<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Helena：</span><br>
Who is it?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Brünhilde：</span><br>
I have a message from Bismarck. She says she'd like you to come and watch the exercise with her.<br>
<br>
Basilica - Bismarck's Quarters<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Bismarck：</span><br>
Hello, Commander. Make yourself at home.<br>
Of course. This is an informal meeting and I'm happy to let go of the formalities.<br>
Oh. No, Geryon is fine, and my Zwei rigging works as normal.<br>
I'm only in this form to express my desire for peace. Personal image, too, matters in politics.<br>
Let's not forget that we're on Orthodoxy land as well.<br>
You have the wrong idea.<br>
This event is meant to deepen interfactional bonds. Not showing my hand to some degree invites unwelcome speculation. You must think the same, no?<br>
If it was only about bonds, I wouldn't be here in person. I'm keeping my options open for an alliance.<br>
Sharp as ever.<br>
Our war with the Sirens – or at least, our war with their experiment subdivision – is coming to a close. I must start planning for what comes next.<br>
That's one thing, yes, but not the only one.<br>
If simply coming together would've let the Azur Lane flourish, the Crimson Axis wouldn't have come into being.<br>
We did back then, too.<br>
You're here, talking to me precisely because you don't believe a conference in the Orthodoxy will be enough to reform the Azur Lane, are you not?<br>
Heehee. You don't need to answer. I know what you're thinking.<br>
Iron Blood will grant your wish. Whatever it takes.<br>
<br>

July 25th<br>
Slow music fills the hall, furnished with classical Orthodoxy ornamentation. Members of all factions are present at the party.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Queen Elizabeth：</span><br>
Hmph... As much as I hate to admit it, this food is pretty good.<br>
You lot have prepared quite the party, considering how little time you had.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Vittorio Veneto：</span><br>
Yes. You really get the feeling that they pulled all the stops out.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Richelieu：</span><br>
Thank you. I'm humbled. With so many factions in attendance, I wouldn't dare give my guests anything less than the best.<br>
<br>
The music stops. Then, out of nowhere, Strasbourg comes up to me.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Strasbourg：</span><br>
Heehee. Welcome to Mont-Saint-Michel, Commander.<br>
Richelieu told me you had many good things to say about me.<br>
Hey, if you're free... may I have a dance?<br>

Iris Orthodoxy - Mont-Saint-Michel<br>
Commander's Private Room<br>
July 26th<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Sheesh... I really slept in.<br>
<br>
It must be noon already, judging by the intensity of the light coming through the window.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Memphis：</span><br>
You really did. It's lunchtime.<br>
It's not every day you oversleep like this. I'm glad we went on this business trip.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
*yaaawn*... Yeah, true. I've not slept that well in ages.<br>
Hey, did Strasbourg stop by in the morning?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Memphis：</span><br>
Strasbourg? No, she's not been here.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
(Maybe she slept in just like me.)<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Memphis：</span><br>
Lunch is ready, by the way.<br>
Our train is departing in the afternoon. You can tour the place if you want to in the meantime.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
(Right, there's the Watatsumi thing to look into. Better call Shinano.)<br>
<br>
I finish my lunch and head outside. On the way to the Basilica, I run into Strasbourg.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Strasbourg：</span><br>
Oh. Good morning.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Morning to you, too. Did you sleep well?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Strasbourg：</span><br>
I sure did. Dancing with you really cleared my mind and let me sleep soundly.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Wait, dance? With me?<br>
Weren't you busy playing music the whole night?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Strasbourg：</span><br>
Pardon? Sounds like you're still half-asleep.<br>
If you forgot, you and I danced the night away after I put my instrument down.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
(Did we? Huh...)<br>
<br>
Come to think of it, I DO vividly remember sharing a dance with her.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
(But that can't be right...)<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Strasbourg：</span><br>
Anyway, where are you going? Are you going to admire the Basilica?<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Yeah. I assume Clemenceau already told you. Let's go pick up Shinano, then we'll head to where the fragment is stored.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Strasbourg：</span><br>
Hang on – told me about what? I haven't heard anything from her.<br>
And what's this about a "fragment"? A fragment of what?<br>
<br>
Suddenly, I get an overwhelming feeling that something is wrong.<br>
This feels just like back during the near-superimposition event, when my memories were overwritten by... something.<br>
I bid farewell to Strasbourg, then run off to Shinano's room in a hurry.<br>
Iris Orthodoxy - Mont-Saint-Michel<br>
Sakura Empire Waiting Room<br>
July 26th<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Shinano!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Shinano ：</span><br>
Ah... Why does your visage harbor such alarm?<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Let me cut straight to the chase since we could be in danger. Do you remember the Watatsumi fragment?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Shinano ：</span><br>
Fragment? Which one do you refer to?<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Last night, remember? You said there's a fragment of it here, in the Basilica.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Shinano ：</span><br>
What? Why would a fragment of it... be on Orthodoxy land?<br>
As best as this one remembers, this one returned to this room after last night's banquet... We never spoke to each other...<br>
This one has no memory of claiming there was a fragment here, as you now say...<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
(She doesn't remember? But the false memories didn't affect her the last time something like this happened...)<br>
Okay, then what about that amulet you had? You said it's also made with a Watatsumi fragment. You should be able to use it and sense the other fragment's presence.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Shinano ：</span><br>
Yes... I did have a charm, once... However, it was made not of a Watatsumi fragment, and I lost it long ago...<br>
You seem to be quite confused today... Perhaps you had a dream so vivid that you mistook it for reality?<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
(I hate to admit it, but she could be right. It'll take more than this to convince me, though.)<br>
(I've got it. Clemenceau isn't here, so maybe she's unaffected.)<br>
<br>
I bring out my device and send Clemenceau a message. I quickly get a reply.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Device：</span><br>
"There is no record of any Watatsumi fragment being handed to us, so there's no evidence that the Basilica has one."<br>
"There are also no logs of you and I having spoken yesterday."<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
(Not even SHE remembers... Did I really imagine all of it?)<br>
(Shinano bringing up the fragment, Clemenceau telling us about it...)<br>
(And Strasbourg never came to me to talk, instead we danced at the banquet...)<br>
<br>
Sometime later, at the train platform...<br>
My doubts and questions remain unresolved, but it's time to leave Mont-Saint-Michel behind.<br>
Just as I'm about to set foot on the train, someone calls out to me.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Chen Hai：</span><br>
Hello, Commander. Are you all heading back to the Orthodoxy mainland?<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Yeah. Our train's leaving soon. Are you staying?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Chen Hai：</span><br>
I suppose so. And not just me – I'm afraid you'll need to make some changes to your plans.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Memphis：</span><br>
Why?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Chen Hai：</span><br>
The Dragon Empery requests your presence at the BP military base to assist in an upcoming operation.<br>
Is that okay with you all?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Helena：</span><br>
BP military base? I've never been there before.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Me neither.Well, THAT'S out of left field...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Memphis：</span><br>
The Empery has never asked for assistance in an operation before. At least as far as I know.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Chen Hai：</span><br>
Why, yes, this is the first time ever.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Memphis：</span><br>
I'll admit, you've made me curious.<br>
However, we have protocols to adhere to. I don't blame you if you were unaware, since this is your first time asking for something like this...<br>
But regardless, taking the Commander to a new mission area requires going through the official channels and filing a request!<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Yeah... Sorry, Chen Hai. We just can't change plans on the spot.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Chen Hai：</span><br>
You needn't worry about that. We've already filed a transfer request with Naval HQ and should receive permission any minute now.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
You're sure they'll process it THAT quickly?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Helena：</span><br>
No way. Naval HQ isn't that fast.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Memphis：</span><br>
She's right. It can take an eternity for them to process a request like this.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Chen Hai：</span><br>
If you don't believe me, you should report in and hear it straight from the horse's mouth.<br>
<br>
Unbelievably, Naval HQ tells us on the spot that they've received permission to redeploy my unit.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Chen Hai：</span><br>
That should be it then, right?<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
I'll be damned...<br>
Usually, a metric ton of red tape stands in the way of any transfer request being granted.<br>
How did you get approval so quickly?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Chen Hai：</span><br>
I suppose you could say we got lucky.<br>
Haven't you noticed it, Commander? There's a peculiar aura in the air today that wasn't here yesterday.<br>
A wish, once made, makes itself come true, you could even say.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
(A peculiar aura... that wasn't here yesterday? The Empery has to know that something's up!)<br>
(So then this invitation is really just an excuse to get us out of here, isn't it?)<br>
Well, seeing as you went through all this trouble, I can't possibly turn you down.<br>
Helena, Memphis, let's visit the Empery.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Helena：</span><br>
Wow, I... I can't believe this is happening. Hang on, this means we're going on back-to-back business trips!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Memphis：</span><br>
That suits me just fine!<br>
She said we'll assist with an operation, remember?<br>
We're shipgirls. We'll get rusty if we don't do some hands-on combat now and then!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Chen Hai：</span><br>
I'm glad you're all on board, then. Let's take a car to the port and–<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Noshiro：</span><br>
Hold on a minute.<br>
Commander, Lady Shinano urgently requests your presence. Would you mind coming with me?<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Wait, Shinano?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Chen Hai：</span><br>
That's quite alright. We'll wait here for you.<br>
<br>
Noshiro leads me out to a quiet, secluded place.<br>
There, on a bench, sits Shinano, holding a green amulet in her hands.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Shinano ：</span><br>
After you told me of this amulet, the thought of it wouldn't leave my mind...<br>
I searched my person, and lo and behold... I rediscovered it after all this time...<br>
Though I've carried it with me for an untold time, I never knew it was there...<br>
It was after that that the memories of your visit yesternight returned to this one...<br>
Strangely, recognizing this amulet promptly reminded me of all the events that transpired.<br>
Our conversation, Clemenceau's answer, the confirmation that a Watatsumi fragment hides within the Basilica...<br>
And yet, I so clearly remember that which never happened – my brethren and I gazing at the moon together, whilst you never came to visit...<br>
So, at a loss, this one confided in Noshiro.<br>
At first, she only remembered the "original" version of events as I did...<br>
As I told her more, she soon remembered the "alternative" version.<br>
Telling apart the truth from the falsehoods was difficult for us both...<br>
But by holding this amulet and talking to me, the truth revealed itself – the memories of you visiting me were the real ones.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
So if I got that right... You found the amulet, regained your memories of last night, then got Noshiro to remember what happened, too?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Shinano ：</span><br>
Aye. There is no doubt that some strange spell has been cast upon the Basilica, and even this one was not immune...<br>
Had you not spoken of the amulet and had I not found it, perchance I would've remained ignorant of the mind-trickery...<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
You said your amulet was carved from a piece of the Watatsumi, right?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Shinano ：</span><br>
Indeed. Its pattern comes from a dream this one had...<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
(So whatever's happening here, dreams and the Watatsumi are involved somehow.)<br>
What about the others? Did you make anyone else wake up to the truth before coming here?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Shinano ：</span><br>
No... Meeting with you seemed a more pressing matter...<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
That might actually be for the better. I'd like you both to keep up the facade that everything's business as usual.<br>
See, I messaged Clemenceau earlier and found out her memories had been affected, too.<br>
For that reason, we should be very cautious until we know how far-reaching this phenomenon is and who could be behind it.<br>
The mastermind is still hiding in the shadows, while we're out in broad daylight.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Shinano ：</span><br>
That is true. What plans have you for now?<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
I'm going to the BP military base, over in the Empery. They've figured out that something's wrong and are drafting a plan to deal with it.<br>
While I'm there, I want you to remain in Europa and keep a close eye on things.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Shinano ：</span><br>
In that case, you should take this amulet... It may perchance be the key to awakening from this dream...<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
No, you hold on to it. There's one person I want you to wake up.<br>
Take this. It's a brooch Clemenceau gave to me a while back.<br>
Board a train to the holy capital and request to meet her face to face.<br>
If anyone tries to stop you, show the brooch to them and they'll let you through.<br>
Get into a meeting with Clemenceau and find a way to wake her up, assuming she hasn't already.<br>
Once she's awake, she'll figure out what I'm going to do.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Shinano ：</span><br>
Very well...<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Now, I've got to go. The train's about to leave. Good luck.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Shinano ：</span><br>
Likewise... Good luck.<br>
<br>
And thus, the exercise came to an end.<br>
As did the peaceful yet illusory interlude.<br>
The spectators plan their next moves.<br>
While the players on the board pick up their pieces.<br>
The echoes from afar are still reverberating among the stars.<br>
To Be Continued<br>
