Somewhere At Sea<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Trieste：</span><br>
We're about half a day away from the Port. Oil reserves are over half, ammunition is plentiful, but our supply of food is...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Pompeo Magno：</span><br>
Yikes... We're almost there, and you're still counting beans?<br>
A quartermaster you may be, but isn't this a bit too much dedication to your job?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Trieste：</span><br>
Nothing is more important than keeping tabs on our supplies. Victory or defeat during battle hinges upon it – and so does your lunch today.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Pompeo Magno：</span><br>
Hwuh?! We don't even have enough supplies for lunch?!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Trieste：</span><br>
Heh heh... Don't worry. Because I've been rationing so diligently, we'll have enough food left over for three more days.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Pompeo Magno：</span><br>
...How do we have more days' worth of food NOW than before we set sail?!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Trieste：</span><br>
...Bean counting is quite miraculous, is it not?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Impero：</span><br>
...Spaghetti.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Pompeo Magno：</span><br>
Huh? Oh, Impero, did you want spaghetti for lunch?<br>
Captain Pompey the Great happens to agree with you, so let us have spaghetti!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Impero：</span><br>
Carrier-based spaghetti. We'll shoot the spaghetti out from my planes...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Pompeo Magno：</span><br>
.........Huh?!<br>
What the heck is that! Nobody asked for this high-level playing with your food!<br>
And why are you sticking spaghetti into your planes?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Impero：</span><br>
The planes help keep the spaghetti warm.<br>
Because I still need to sleep and bathe... Spaghetti fired from my planes can be ready to eat at any time...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Trieste：</span><br>
Impero came up with something incredible again...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Pompeo Magno：</span><br>
More like incredibly stupid... Well, I must admit that the ambition behind the idea has moved Captain Pompey the Great.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Trieste：</span><br>
Huh...?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Impero：</span><br>
Uhh......<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Trieste：</span><br>
What is it this time? Flying pizza?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Impero：</span><br>
...I've lost track of my planes.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Pompeo Magno：</span><br>
What?! Could it be a Siren attack? What was the last bit of data you got from them before you lost their signals?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Impero：</span><br>
A strange city and tower... That's the last thing I got from them.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Trieste：</span><br>
Sounds a bit like a Mirror Sea, doesn't it...<br>
A Mirror Sea appearing only half a day away from the Port is definitely noteworthy.<br>
Let's request backup from the Port first, then turn around to scout out the situation.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Pompeo Magno：</span><br>
Well said! However, Captain Pompey the Great and her valiant comrades will make quick work of any Sirens even before reinforcements show up!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Impero：</span><br>
How dare they shoot down Impero's planes... How dare they shoot down my SPAGHETTI! We must make them pay!<br>
<br>
Port - Communication Room<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Carabiniere：</span><br>
Incoming communication! Seems like Pompeo and the others will arrive back at the Port in time!<br>
<br>
Carabiniere played the contents of the message, but was completely unprepared for what she heard.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Carabiniere：</span><br>
A s-support request?!<br>
Ehh?! If you need backup, you should've contacted the Commander directly!<br>
This is how you do it, right... Okay, sent the info over.<br>
...Alright, now to wait for the Commander's response. Hopefully Pompeo and the others aren't in any real trouble.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Communicator：</span><br>
BEEP––––<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Carabiniere：</span><br>
Confirming receipt, huh. Guess the secretary today is on top of it.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Communicator：</span><br>
BEEP BEEP––––<br>
BEEP BEEP BEEP––––<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Carabiniere：</span><br>
Huh? Wh-why am I getting multiple confirmation replies...?<br>
<br>
Carabiniere suddenly shuddered when she thought of a potential possibility––<br>

<br>
Abnormal Sea Area<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Gloucester：</span><br>
Lady Illustrious and Lady Formidable will be arriving in this sector shortly.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Illustrious：</span><br>
Indeed, this is quite an anomaly...<br>
From the description, it might as well have "Siren Facility" written all over it in bold letters.<br>
Formidable, has anything caught your eye?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Formidable：</span><br>
Nothing so far. No sign of either Sirens or the Sardegnan fleet.<br>
Gloucester, do you remember who the flagship of the Sardegna fleet is supposed to be?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Gloucester：</span><br>
Someone by the name of Impero.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Formidable：</span><br>
Ugh... I haven't met her before, but if she's another one of those types who won't shut up about how glorious her namesake is...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Illustrious：</span><br>
Huh? Why would you say that about her?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Formidable：</span><br>
Look, I've seen some serious shit on Juustagram...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Illustrious：</span><br>
...Is that a reliable source of information?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Formidable：</span><br>
Uhh, well, I'm sure it's nothing you'd be interested in, but... For example, she was talking about using her planes to start a band.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Illustrious：</span><br>
Using her planes to do what...?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Formidable：</span><br>
I-I told you, it's nothing you'd be interested in! Besides, we've got a job on our hands here!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Illustrious：</span><br>
Umm, alright...?<br>
In any case, the Commander ordered us to join up with the Sardegnan fleet and eliminate the Siren threat together before they can pose a threat.<br>
There's a good chance that we'll run into a Mirror Sea, so we need to get moving.<br>

{{折叠面板|标题=Flying Fish|选项=3|主框=1|样式=primary|展开=是}}
<br>
Abnormal Sea Area - Near the Center<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Impero：</span><br>
Trout, salmon, sardines...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Pompeo Magno：</span><br>
Now she's reciting the names of fish!<br>
But I'll allow it, because they're all delicious!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Impero：</span><br>
Skipjack, amberjack, saury...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Pompeo Magno：</span><br>
Her fish are getting closer and closer to the Sakura Islands!<br>
Not as fond of these, except I must admit, saury is quite tasty!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Impero：</span><br>
Koi, shad, Emperyfish...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Pompeo Magno：</span><br>
Um... What the heck are those?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Trieste：</span><br>
Actually, these are varieties of freshwater fish that are quite commonly eaten in the Dragon Empery~<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Pompeo Magno：</span><br>
Freshwater fish?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Trieste：</span><br>
Unlike the saltwater fish that we're used to, freshwater fish come from rivers and lakes rather than the sea.<br>
Some species of fish can spend their lives going back and forth between the two.<br>
By the way, I heard that shad are especially tasty. I'd like to try some if I ever get the chance...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Pompeo Magno：</span><br>
Woah, you really know your stuff when it comes to food!<br>
Though it makes sense that you'd be good at cooking since you manage our supplies and rations... But, why did Impero suddenly start naming off fish?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Impero：</span><br>
Dace, cavalla, archerfish...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Pompeo Magno：</span><br>
Err... Are we still talking about fish here, or...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Impero：</span><br>
Finally, Swordfish, Barracuda, Fairey Albacore...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Trieste：</span><br>
Wait, is she talking about...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Pompeo Magno：</span><br>
Look, over there! Those are Royal Navy planes!<br>
She probably started to name off fish because she saw those planes! ...Probably.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Trieste：</span><br>
I didn't expect reinforcements to show up THIS quickly. As expected, the Commander doesn't disappoint.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Impero：</span><br>
I wonder if it tastes good...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Trieste：</span><br>
Does what taste good?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Impero：</span><br>
Albacore spaghetti... I'll have to borrow one from the Royal Navy carriers after we get back.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Trieste：</span><br>
What the... Ahem, Impero, let's worry about that later and meet up with their fleet first.<br>
{{折叠面板|内容结束}}

{{折叠面板|标题=The Second Fleet|选项=4|主框=1|样式=primary|展开=是}}
<br>
Somewhere, a bit earlier...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Admiral Hipper：</span><br>
What's the plan, Eugen?<br>
Impero's fleet has discovered a Siren facility and requested backup from the Commander.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Prinz Eugen：</span><br>
That's too bad. Looks like our lovely vacation time is about to get cut short.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Admiral Hipper：</span><br>
But we only just left the port!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Prinz Eugen：</span><br>
Sorry, but whining isn't going to get you anywhere. Let's just treat this as a scenic detour, alright?<br>
But I must say, I'm rather interested in this "tower" described in the communication.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Admiral Hipper：</span><br>
I'm not! Not in the slightest!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Prinz Eugen：</span><br>
Fine, fine~ Should we just act like we missed the message and go enjoy our vacation?<br>
I mean, it's not our problem if the Sardegna girls end up in over their heads and something terrible happens to them~<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Admiral Hipper：</span><br>
.........<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Prinz Eugen：</span><br>
Something wrong? Didn't you want to hit the sunny beaches?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Admiral Hipper：</span><br>
Screw you! You know what? Fine.<br>
We're turning around right now. We can't leave those Sardegna girls alone!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Prinz Eugen：</span><br>
Hehe, as you say, princess~<br>

<br>
Elsewhere...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Zuikaku：</span><br>
Take this, sister of the Grey Ghost!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Hornet：</span><br>
C'mon, I have a name, you know! You're facing up against me this time, not my sister!<br>
Enty might be strong, but I'm no slouch either! Hmph!<br>
I'll show you what happens when you underestimate me!<br>
<br>
An urgent message suddenly interrupted the white-hot duel between the two carriers.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Hornet：</span><br>
...The Sardegna fleet ran into a Mirror Sea on the way back to the port and needs backup ASAP?<br>
In that case, we can't be sitting here play-fighting amongst ourselves.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Zuikaku：</span><br>
You're right. Nothing is more important than answering the call of our allies.<br>
We'll use this upcoming battle to decide the victor of this duel!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Hornet：</span><br>
Sure. Let's see who has the best performance!<br>
{{折叠面板|内容结束}}

{{折叠面板|标题=Rendezvous|选项=6|主框=1|样式=primary|展开=是}}
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Zuikaku：</span><br>
Heheh. Seems like I've sunk more enemies here. How'd you like THAT?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Hornet：</span><br>
In the first place, there's no point competing over who can clean up more trash.<br>
Plus, this is a pretty weird Mirror Sea if I've ever seen one. It looks imposing as hell, but there aren't many enemies and the only ones that do show up are weak.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Zuikaku：</span><br>
Say what you want, but a win's a win.<br>
Go tell your sister that Shoukaku and I will face her during the next mock battle – and that victory WILL be ours!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Hornet：</span><br>
Look, Enterprise has better things to do...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Zuikaku：</span><br>
Nonsense! Our rivalry spans the ages! This time, we will defeat the Grey Ghost!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Hornet：</span><br>
Well, I guess your determination deserves some kudos... But if you want to challenge her that badly, you're gonna have to ask her yourself. I'm not my sister's keeper.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Zuikaku：</span><br>
I'm the victor here, so can't you do a little favor for me?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Hornet：</span><br>
Sigh... Alright, but the battle isn't over yet. We'll settle this once and for all once everything is over.<br>
If you manage to beat me, I'll pass on your challenge to Enty.<br>
<br>
KABOOM––!!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Zuikaku：</span><br>
An explosion came from the middle of this sector!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Hornet：</span><br>
Let's take a look... Wait, huh? That's not the Sardegna fleet, but rather Eugen and Hipper from the Iron Blood?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Zuikaku：</span><br>
The fact that other fleets are showing up means that this situation must be very critical!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Hornet：</span><br>
That makes sense... Let's hurry up and meet up with the others then!<br>
<br>
Elsewhere, Prinz Eugen and Admiral Hipper are engaged – albeit leisurely – in combat with Sirens.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Admiral Hipper：</span><br>
Who gave you lowly Siren scum permission to fight back? Out of my sight!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Prinz Eugen：</span><br>
You sure are working hard today. Maybe I can just sit back and watch from a distance.<br>
Keep up the good work~ Your sister is cheering for you~<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Admiral Hipper：</span><br>
Hey, come back here! I came here to back up our allies, so you take this seriously too!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Prinz Eugen：</span><br>
I wonder who originally planned on skipping out to go on vacation––<br>
Oh, I see, I see! You're worried about your Sardegnan friends!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Admiral Hipper：</span><br>
Sh-shut up, you! They're just allies, not friends! This is just a part of the job!<br>
If you have time to tease me, then help out already!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Prinz Eugen：</span><br>
Prinz Eugen, reporting for duty–– or so I'd like to say, but that doesn't seem to be necessary anymore.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Admiral Hipper：</span><br>
Huh? What are you talking ab––<br>
<br>
KABOOM–––––!!<br>
A swarm of planes passed overhead and completely demolished the remaining Siren stragglers.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Prinz Eugen：</span><br>
Eagle Union planes flying in formation with Sakura planes... Now that's an unusual combination.<br>
I guess we weren't the only ones who responded to the backup request.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Admiral Hipper：</span><br>
Hmph! It's only natural to take a backup request seriously. The more people who show up, the better!<br>
Now, let's pick up the pace and meet up with them!<br>
{{折叠面板|内容结束}}

{{折叠面板|标题=Conjecture|选项=7|主框=1|样式=primary|展开=是}}
<br>
Abnormal Sea Area - Near the Center<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Hornet：</span><br>
Wait, did you girls also get the message sent from the port?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Prinz Eugen：</span><br>
Sure did. You should've seen my sister's face change colors as she dragged me here at breakneck speed~<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Admiral Hipper：</span><br>
Huuh? My face did no such thing!!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Prinz Eugen：</span><br>
Look, you're doing it again~<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Zuikaku：</span><br>
Alright, we've all seen enough of this comedic duo––<br>
Having that said, I'm surprised we all showed up without coordinating our efforts, and even covered different areas on our way here.<br>
Usually, the Commander provides detailed instructions when arranging these reinforcement operations.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Hornet：</span><br>
Instead, this time...<br>
We got a broadcast from the port rather than direct orders from the Commander.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Prinz Eugen：</span><br>
Doesn't seem quite right, does it? Shouldn't the Commander know that we're on vacation?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Admiral Hipper：</span><br>
Huh? Do you even know what you're saying, Eugen?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Prinz Eugen：</span><br>
What'd you think about the enemies we encountered along the way?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Admiral Hipper：</span><br>
Weak! Total trash not even worth mentioning!<br>
Wait... I think I see what you're getting at...<br>
For enemies this weak, it shouldn't be necessary to call all of us to one place...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Prinz Eugen：</span><br>
Do you remember who was on duty in the communications room before we left?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Admiral Hipper：</span><br>
Let's see... Carabiniere from Sardegna?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Zuikaku：</span><br>
Carabiniere must've received a backup request from Impero...<br>
And she forwarded the message to all of us in a hurry, and that's the reason we're all here now?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Prinz Eugen：</span><br>
That sounds about right~<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Admiral Hipper：</span><br>
...You've got to be kidding me. Is this some kind of joke?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Prinz Eugen：</span><br>
Now, now, getting angry is bad for your skin, sis. Since we're here already, why not have a look around?<br>
I'm sure we're all equally interested in that strange-looking tower in the middle of this place.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Admiral Hipper：</span><br>
...Let's get moving then! When we're done here, I'm going to give those Sardegna girls a good lecturing!<br>
{{折叠面板|内容结束}}

{{折叠面板|标题=To the Tower|选项=8|主框=1|样式=primary|展开=是}}
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Hornet：</span><br>
Impero's supposed to have her own planes, but we haven't been able to get in contact yet...<br>
Maybe finding their fleet isn't going to be as easy as we first expected.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Zuikaku：</span><br>
We didn't have their exact coordinates when we showed up. We could've passed right by each other for all we know.<br>
That tower in the middle seems to be messing with our communications too... Maybe they're over there investigating the situation.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Prinz Eugen：</span><br>
Sounds like a plan. If Impero's fleet is trying to disrupt the Mirror Sea, that's going to be the first place they look.<br>
In the meantime, let's make as much noise as we can to get the attention of their planes.<br>
For example, that earsplitting sound my sister made when she got headbutted by Glowworm.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Admiral Hipper：</span><br>
Glowworm isn't even here right now!<br>
Wait, back up! That never even happened! I did NOT make any such sound!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Zuikaku：</span><br>
The deeper in we go, the more enemies are likely to appear. The sound of combat should be all we need, right?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Admiral Hipper：</span><br>
Exactly! At least someone here is using her brain!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Prinz Eugen：</span><br>
I'm glad we have one reliable person here.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Admiral Hipper：</span><br>
EUGEN!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Hornet：</span><br>
Those two sure get along well...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Zuikaku：</span><br>
Good enough. Not like you get to pick your family anyway.<br>
...Hm? Looks like we've discovered Sirens blocking our way to the tower!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Prinz Eugen：</span><br>
Looks like our fun time has to be put on hold. Time to get serious, sis!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Admiral Hipper：</span><br>
You're the only one here having fun!<br>
So stop messing around and help us reach the tower first!<br>
You've been making fun of me this entire time, so I'll have you do your job properly!<br>
{{折叠面板|内容结束}}

{{折叠面板|标题=The Greatest Tea Party|选项=9|主框=1|样式=primary|展开=是}}
<br>
Meanwhile, Illustrious and Impero are on the way to the tower in the middle of the unknown area.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Pompeo Magno：</span><br>
I never expected the Royal Navy to be the first to come to our aid!<br>
Captain Pompey the Great shall remember this debt! Feel free to call upon me at any time!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Illustrious：</span><br>
We're all friends back home at the port now... There's no need to blow things out of proportion.<br>
After all, the Commander was the one who arranged the reinforcements. We're just doing what we should.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Pompeo Magno：</span><br>
No need to be polite! Just tell me what you would have me do!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Illustrious：</span><br>
It's not like I can come up with anything on the spot...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Formidable：</span><br>
Actually, there is one thing~<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Illustrious：</span><br>
Hmm?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Formidable：</span><br>
Before we came here, we were interrupted during our tea party.<br>
If it's not too much to ask, how about we hold another tea party with all of us, after we get back to the port?<br>
Of course, we'd invite the Commander and all our other friends~<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Pompeo Magno：</span><br>
An excellent suggestion! Captain Pompey the Great... shall arrange the greatest tea party!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Impero：</span><br>
During the tea party, can I chill in the bathtub and drink Oxy-cola?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Pompeo Magno：</span><br>
What do you think a tea party is, Impero?!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Impero：</span><br>
Can I not? Veneto was drinking coffee at a tea party, so why am I not allowed to drink Oxy-cola?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Illustrious：</span><br>
Haha, you can drink whatever you prefer. The more important thing is talking and deepening our relationships.<br>
But, I'm not sure we can accomplish that if you're in the bathtub...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Formidable：</span><br>
I suppose socializing in the bath is a classical Sardegnan custom... Hmm, I wonder if the beach counts as a bathtub...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Impero：</span><br>
A sand bath? Are you going to pour buckets of sand over your head?<br>
Wait... That'd be a sand shower rather than a sand bath...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Formidable：</span><br>
Yeah. A sand bath would be where you bury yourself up to your neck in sand.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Impero：</span><br>
...Hm? Is that what you prefer, Formidable?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Formidable：</span><br>
(I'm done. I'm so done with this girl...)<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Impero：</span><br>
Ah, but my sister is a natural when it comes to the sand. And her Colosseum...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Illustrious：</span><br>
Why are we talking about the Colosseum now...?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Trieste：</span><br>
Lady Veneto once spent the entire day making half a Colosseum at the beach.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Illustrious：</span><br>
Oh my... I'm sure that was a beautiful and elegant sight indeed.<br>
In any case, I'm looking forward to enjoying our tea party together.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Impero：</span><br>
Mm. I'm looking forward to it too... May we enjoy the sweetest of dreams from the deepest recesses of our hearts.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Pompeo Magno：</span><br>
A tea party is something you need to be awake to attend!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Impero：</span><br>
I'll make sure my planes are loaded up on coffee then.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Illustrious：</span><br>
...Loaded up with what?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Formidable：</span><br>
Don't think too much about it, Illustrious... I guess this really is the kind of person Impero is.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Impero：</span><br>
I want to go to this tea party... Let's defeat all the enemies, and go back home!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Pompeo Magno：</span><br>
Where the heck is all this motivation coming from all of a sudden?!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Impero：</span><br>
Mm... Enemies who dare lay their hands on the brilliant Impero will be met with swift retribution!<br>

Abnormal Sea Area - Center<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Hornet：</span><br>
Judging from the models of the planes approaching us, these must be...<br>
The planes of the Royal Navy and Sardegna!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Prinz Eugen：</span><br>
Oh dear. Looks like they found us instead~<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Zuikaku：</span><br>
Even the Royal Navy is here, huh... This must be a pretty big deal after all.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Hornet：</span><br>
No kidding. When's the last time carriers from four different factions have fought together?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Illustrious：</span><br>
This is Illustrious of the Royal Navy. Ships up ahead, please state your identity and purpose.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Prinz Eugen：</span><br>
Easy now, it's Prinz Eugen. We came after receiving the very same backup request from the port.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Illustrious：</span><br>
...Is that so? I thought we were the only ones the Commander sent.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Zuikaku：</span><br>
Actually...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Pompeo Magno：</span><br>
We're very sorry for causing this mix-up! We apologize on behalf of Carabiniere!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Hornet：</span><br>
Don't sweat it! I'd be pretty strung-out too if my friends were in a pickle, so mistakes like this are understandable. There's no need to chew her out after we get back.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Trieste：</span><br>
Thank you all for coming to our aid. If you'd like, we were talking about having a big tea party after returning to port.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Zuikaku：</span><br>
A tea party?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Pompeo Magno：</span><br>
Yeah! After this mission is over, we're going to have the GREATEST tea party!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Zuikaku：</span><br>
That sounds fun! Is it okay if I invite my sister?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Trieste：</span><br>
The more the merrier! The Royal Navy will be covering the expenses as well~<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Impero：</span><br>
There shall be pizza. Lots of pizza.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Pompeo Magno：</span><br>
Now it's pizza?!<br>
Well, whatever... If we're already bringing Oxy-cola, it only makes sense to bring pizza as well!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Hornet：</span><br>
Woohoo! Now that's the kind of party I can get behind!<br>
Especially the kind with big, juicy chunks of pineapple...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Pompeo Magno：</span><br>
Gwaaaaah! I'll pretend I never heard that!<br>
<br>
Upon hearing the words "pineapple" and "pizza" used together, Trieste's normally calm expression cracked.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Trieste：</span><br>
I consider myself a tolerant individual, but what... is this sacrilege against pizza I just heard...?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Hornet：</span><br>
...Huh?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Trieste：</span><br>
In any case, the importance of holding this tea-and-pizza party is now more evident than ever. I shall teach you what true pizza is.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Hornet：</span><br>
Oh, um... I actually meant to say, I'm quite an enthusiast of Sardegna's famous Pizza Margherita?<br>
I've been looking forward to trying a TRUE Sardegnan pie... Ahaha...<br>
...But most importantly! I'm glad all of you are safe and sound!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Impero：</span><br>
I'm safe. But I'm also SALTY.<br>
My planes are under attack, but the perpetrator cannot be found.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Illustrious：</span><br>
Likewise. Though we've made our way to the middle of this sector, we still haven't met any real opposition.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Prinz Eugen：</span><br>
The enemies have been utterly weak, but that tower doesn't at all resemble one of those antiquated Siren facilities.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Formidable：</span><br>
Indeed, it's quite sus–– Err, ahem... I mean, the danger is almost palpable.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Zuikaku：</span><br>
There's no telling what dangers wait for us in that tower. We should survey the area carefully and not just rush in without a plan.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Hornet：</span><br>
Yup, I agree. We have complete air superiority here though, so we'll be able to sniff out if the Sirens are up to any mischief.<br>

<br>
After exploring the surrounding area, the group arrived at the base of a massive tower.<br>
However, nothing sought to impede their progress as they approached closer and closer – no defensive installations, no fleets to intercept them.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Hornet：</span><br>
The only thing we've run into so far is the typical EM disturbance...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Impero：</span><br>
Coming through~<br>
I wonder if they're too scared to come out because the brilliant Impero is leading the fleet.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Pompeo Magno：</span><br>
Heheh. Wouldn't surprise me! After all, Captain Pompey the Great and her stalwart allies have already completely controlled this Mirror Sea!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Zuikaku：</span><br>
It's way too early to celebrate. We have no idea what's hiding inside a tower of that size.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Prinz Eugen：</span><br>
Sis, I'll make sure to stand guard at the entrance, so can I count on you to head inside that tower?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Admiral Hipper：</span><br>
Haah? Why do I have to do it?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Prinz Eugen：</span><br>
Well, we could send a measly little destroyer with flimsy armor, or a carrier that needs wide-open spaces to operate as well as an escort fleet...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Gloucester：</span><br>
Don't worry. We'll handle the exploration.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Admiral Hipper：</span><br>
I, I can do this after all. I am a heavy cruiser after all. Whenever we're sailing into uncharted waters, it's only natural that we take the lead!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Impero：</span><br>
Eugen is also a heavy cruiser.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Admiral Hipper：</span><br>
Oh... that's right! I almost let her trick me again...!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Prinz Eugen：</span><br>
Darn, so you finally noticed. In that case...<br>
<br>
KABOOM––––!!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Admiral Hipper：</span><br>
What the heck are you doing?!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Prinz Eugen：</span><br>
Hmm? Were you going to pry the door open with your bare hands or what?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Admiral Hipper：</span><br>
Wait...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Illustrious：</span><br>
There's not a scratch on the door...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Impero：</span><br>
Not enough firepower, huh. Let me give it a try.<br>
<br>
Impero tried to scramble her planes to bomb the door open, but...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Impero：</span><br>
No matter how brilliant I am, there's no way I can hit a target like that with my planes.<br>
Mm, looks like I'll have to get my sisters to help out again.<br>
Veneto, Littorio––<br>
<br>
Impero lifted her hands into the air as if preparing to launch into a great soliloquy.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Illustrious：</span><br>
Is Impero... performing a ritual of some sort?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Hornet：</span><br>
Well, uh, the important thing is that we can combine our powers, right? Even carriers can get a little extra firepower by bolstering their secondary guns and anti-air guns!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Zuikaku：</span><br>
Yeah... Let's all focus our attacks!<br>
<br>
KABOOM––––!!<br>
Everyone unloaded the weapons in their rigging at the door, wreathing the area in a cloud of smoke.<br>
But when their attacks ceased, the door to the tower still stood... As a matter of fact, basically nothing had even changed.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Communicator：</span><br>
Beep––<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Hornet：</span><br>
Are we able to connect with the port again?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Zuikaku：</span><br>
We're also getting observational data again on the weather around this sector! Does this mean... that the Mirror Sea has dissipated?!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Hornet：</span><br>
Seems like it. But, the facility is still here, and the tower is still standing...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Prinz Eugen：</span><br>
Now this would be a first. Interesting.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Impero：</span><br>
Uhh... I'm tired already. Can we go home?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Formidable：</span><br>
Go home...? Do you just plan on letting this tower sit here?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Impero：</span><br>
Yeah. The Sirens already admitted defeat. So this counts as our win.<br>
I want the folks back home to roll out the red carpet for my victorious return. I want to head back and take a bath.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Formidable：</span><br>
We didn't actually win, that's just what you convinced yourself of...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Illustrious：</span><br>
But, Formidable, it's true that we have no way of breaking through the tower's defenses right now.<br>
We've already completed the two things we came here for – linking up with Impero's fleet, and getting rid of the Mirror Sea. So, let's hurry back to port and relay the situation first.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Formidable：</span><br>
So you also think we can come back to this tower later?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Illustrious：</span><br>
Certainly. As a matter of fact, I believe it's the safer thing to do.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Impero：</span><br>
Agreed. Let us all return as heroes.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Hornet：</span><br>
Hey, don't just turn around by yourself and leave!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Prinz Eugen：</span><br>
Well, Impero was the one who requested reinforcements after all. Why don't we just follow her lead this time?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Hornet：</span><br>
Fine, fine. Maybe the weirdest person here has the best grasp on the situation.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Zuikaku：</span><br>
Once we head back and tell Akashi about what's going on, she might have some information on how we can get in.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Admiral Hipper：</span><br>
Wait, Eugen, are we also going to follow them back?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Prinz Eugen：</span><br>
Of course not. Now that we've finished our emergency mission, it only makes sense for us to get back to our vacation, right?<br>
But... Now that I think about it, we were invited to the GREATEST tea party ever, weren't we?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Admiral Hipper：</span><br>
That's right! After all the extra work we put in, this better be worth our while!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Pompeo Magno：</span><br>
Sounds good then! Back to the port we go!<br>
<br>
The girls sailed away from the tower until it vanished into the horizon.<br>
However, the story of the Siren tower and the shipgirls tasked with plumbing its depths does not end here––<br>
