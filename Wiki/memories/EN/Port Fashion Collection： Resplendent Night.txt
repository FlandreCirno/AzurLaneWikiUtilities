<br>
1 Stage-Setting Charmer<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Guam：</span><br>
Hello there~ Welcome to the Bunny Bar!♪<br>
The instant I enter the bar, I'm greeted by Guam's enthusiastic voice.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
I hear the shipgirl talents are putting on a show here...?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Guam：</span><br>
That's right~ It's time for Bunny Guam's big magic show! I call it Guam's Prize Disguise!<br>
Get ready to witness a miracle♪<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
(Magic? Does Guam do magic tricks, too...?)<br>
(I fear what comes next...)<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Guam：</span><br>
Tadaaa~ First, I'll ride this unicycle!<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
(Wasn't this supposed to be a magic circle? Also, where did she get that unicycle—)<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Guam：</span><br>
With my incredible sense of balance, I'm able to ride this unicycle with ease♪<br>
Did you think that was all? Well, it isn't~ Next, I'll make these three sandbags disappear!<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
(When did she grab those sandbags?! And from where...?!)<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Guam：</span><br>
I'll turn them into three cute little pigeons! Don't look away, or you might miss it♥<br>
Guam tosses the sandbags into the air and catches them one after another, as if juggling.<br>
Then, with dazzling speed, she throws all three up into the air. With her free hand, she reaches for the hat on her head.<br>
Don't blink, now~<br>
Here comes a miracle♪<br>
She catches all three sandbags perfectly in her hat.<br>
Three, two, one!<br>
With a magic wand, which she again pulls out of thin air, she gently taps the brim of her hat.<br>
There's a bang as ribbons and three doves come flying out of it.<br>
Thanks for watching Bunny Guam's magic show! I hope to see you again next time~<br>
<br>
The short, yet lovely performance comes to an end.<br>
I recall the striking sight of Guam on the unicycle, juggling and doing magic tricks.<br>
I'm certain that I'll never forget that.<br>
That's Guam for you.<br>

<br>
2 Sleepy on a Busy Day<br>
When I enter the pop-up restaurant, I find Laffey in uniform and carrying a tray.<br>
She's so visibly sleepy that I have to worry about the drinks balancing on it.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Laffey：</span><br>
Welcome... Commander, sit wherever you want... Any open seat is probably fine.<br>
Commander... Did you come to check on the restaurant?<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Since it's opening day, I made time to stop by. Why are you dressed like that, Laffey?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Laffey：</span><br>
Yep... Laffey promised to help everyone around the restaurant... *yawn*... Sleepy...<br>
But don't worry, Commander... All Laffey has to do is take this tray from the counter to the tables...<br>
I'm just fine... Probably, yup...<br>
Oh... Do you want to order, Commander?<br>
Here's the menu for today... If you want anything, let Laffey know...<br>
...The recommended drinks? Laffey likes... the soda...<br>
It's cold and refreshing, and... the feeling of the bubbly carbonation popping...<br>
You'll like it a lot, Commander...<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Well, yes, but soda...?<br>
(Who would go all the way to a restaurant just for soda?)<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Laffey：</span><br>
Commander... Do you hate soda?<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
No, that's not what I mean...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Laffey：</span><br>
*stare*...<br>
<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项1：O-okay. I'll take the soda!</span>'''''<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项2：Soda, please!</span>'''''<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Laffey：</span><br>
One glass of soda... Wait a minute, Commander. I'll be right back.<br>
Thanks for waiting, Commander... Here's your soda.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Laffey II：</span><br>
Laffey puts the soda on the table and sits down right next to me.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Laffey：</span><br>
Oh, the soda... Try it, Commander.<br>
<br>
The cold drink runs through me, and the carbonated bubbles burst... Yep. That's just soda with ice in it.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
It's good. Thanks, Laff—<br>
<br>
Suddenly, something heavy falls on my arm.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Laffey：</span><br>
Kkh... Nnh... Zzzzzzz...<br>
An exhale touches my arm. When I turn to look, I see Laffey asleep, leaning on me.<br>
It seems like I'll have to finish off this soda slowly.<br>

<br>
3 A Back-Alley Encounter<br>
The alleys behind the restaurant are, in a word, labyrinthine. I take a single wrong turn by accident, and I end up unable to find my way back.<br>
Just before I give up and accept that I'm lost, though, I hear a voice from the room next to me.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Cleveland：</span><br>
Commander? What are you doing here?<br>
I turn to look. There, I see Cleveland in the restaurant uniform with a jacket sloppily thrown on top.<br>
The room is illuminated by colorful lightning. The TV at her feet displays the word "PAUSED" in big letters.<br>
I look again at Cleveland, who's holding a controller in her hands. It finally makes sense: she's slacking off and playing video games instead of working.<br>
Ah... Heheh, Commander, are you... lost?<br>
<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项1：(Admit to being helplessly lost)</span>'''''<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Cleveland：</span><br>
The corridors here are pretty complex. Don't blame yourself for getting lost.<br>
Hm? What about my outfit?<br>
I figure you can tell at a glance, no? Heheh, I promised to help out in the restaurant today.<br>
Now, welcome to my little secret base~<br>
"As a special service, would you like me to introduce you to our special drink menu?♪"<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Cleveland：</span><br>
"You don't want a drink? Okay... What kind of 'service' would you like, then?♡"<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
......<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Cleveland：</span><br>
Heheh, what do you think? Did I get the vibe just right?<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
What vibe?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Cleveland：</span><br>
A girly vibe, of course!<br>
<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项1：......</span>'''''<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项2：It'll be okay. You can try again next time.</span>'''''<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项3：Don't be like that, Clevebro!</span>'''''<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Cleveland：</span><br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项2）</span>'''''Huh? Was that not good enough?!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Cleveland：</span><br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项3）</span>'''''Aaaah! Stop calling me that!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Cleveland：</span><br>
Geez. If this isn't girly, then what is?<br>
...Even if it's not quite right, you think it's good enough?<br>
Ahahaha... Not sure how I feel about that appraisal...<br>
*sigh*... Well, whatever!<br>
Anyway, this is my secret base. I came to take a break before the restaurant opened.<br>
It's been busy, but I figured I might as well make time for some light gaming.<br>
Are you free right now? If you want, we could game together.<br>
If you're lost... Beat me, and I'll show you the way back to the restaurant!<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
And if I lose?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Cleveland：</span><br>
Heheh. If you lose...<br>
You'll have a hard time making it to the restaurant~<br>
Now, bring it on!<br>

4 Today's Horoscope<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Constellation：</span><br>
Commander, would you like to know your horoscope for today?<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
My horoscope... Constellation?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Constellation：</span><br>
Under a night sky littered with shining stars, one Constellation wearing her restaurant uniform beckons to me.<br>
<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项1：I'm surprised to see you here...</span>'''''<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项2：You're in a good mood, aren't you?</span>'''''<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Constellation：</span><br>
Commander, please don't tease me.<br>
My shift at the restaurant is at night, so of course I'm in a good mood.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
It won't interfere with your star-gazing?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Constellation：</span><br>
Maybe a little... But Commander, don't you think the night sky here has its own unique flavor?<br>
It's not easy to see the sky so clear and starry, even if you climb up to the top of a mountain on a clear night.<br>
But they look so close here. As if you could take the whole galaxy into your hands if you just reach out...<br>
Constellation points up at a particular star.<br>
That one is Ursa Major, and the one next to it is Ursa Minor. And then...<br>
Constellation is always so excited to talk about the stars. She gets more talkative than ever.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
And this planetarium was built using the port's newest technology, I believe?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Constellation：</span><br>
Yep. Isn't it just full of romance, Commander?<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Yeah. Romance is an apt word.<br>
Still, I'm surprised that they got you to help around the restaurant. I thought you didn't like crowded places.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Constellation：</span><br>
Umm... I don't think you're right about that. Actually, I like it when things are livelier.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Really?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Constellation：</span><br>
But since my sleep schedule is so different from everyone else's, I don't get many opportunities to hang out with them.<br>
But here, I can talk under the beautiful stars with everyone no matter what time it is...<br>
It's so much fun.<br>
...Oh. I blabbered so much that I forgot to ask for your order, Commander.<br>
Ahem... Commander, what would you like to drink tonight?<br>
Thanks for waiting~ Here's the drink you ordered, aaand...<br>
I brought your horoscope results and advice for you♪<br>
