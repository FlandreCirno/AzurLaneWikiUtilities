Fond Memory<br>
Office - Morning hours<br>
I'm in the office with my secretary, Shangri-La, and about to get to work.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Shangri-La：</span><br>
...What's the matter, Commander? Is there something on your mind?<br>
<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项1："Yeah, actually. You see..."</span>'''''<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Shangri-La：</span><br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项1）</span>'''''Ah, so you've forgotten where you left last night's documents? That explains it. <br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Shangri-La：</span><br>
Let's start by composing ourselves, as panicking won't solve anything. Here, have some saffron tea to help with that.<br>
Could you tell me more about the documents? Do they have any markings, or other distinctive feature?<br>
Hmm... So they're already bound, signed, and have the red stamp affixed, but are missing your official seal?<br>
If my memory serves me right, those documents are in the third folder inside your left-hand drawer. They were scheduled to be posted later today.<br>
<br>
She's been taking notes on everything ever since she became my secretary. It's been a great help.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Shangri-La：</span><br>
...You know, I've been thinking. About how I've met many new people since I took up my post here.<br>
As I'm sure you know, I prefer observing events from afar than directly participating in them...<br>
She retrieves a picture album and pulls out out a photograph from it.<br>
<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项1：Take a look at the photo</span>'''''<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Shangri-La：</span><br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项1）</span>'''''Title: "Friends." Description: "Shangri-La - From gripes to smiles."<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Shangri-La：</span><br>
When I first arrived, I was solely focused on helping out Essex in any way I could.<br>
I got worked up over small things for reasons I can't remember, working so hard that even she was astonished...<br>
Hehe. Looking back at it now, I just find it funny.<br>
<br>
She really was like that when she first arrived at port. Whatever she was doing, it had something to do with Essex.<br>
I only learned about the other side of her a while after she'd gotten used to this place...<br>

The Concerns of a Friend<br>
One day, at the Exercise Area...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Shangri-La：</span><br>
That concludes all the exercises for today. Commander, it's time to return to the office and review our–<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Essex：</span><br>
Oh. Good morning, Commander and Shangri-La...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Shangri-La：</span><br>
Likewise. Good morning, Essex.<br>
Shangri-La switched gears before I could even get a word in.<br>
If I may ask... Is there something bothering you, Essex?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Essex：</span><br>
Huh? Why do you ask?<br>
Now that she pointed it out, Essex's tone did seem a little concerning.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Shangri-La：</span><br>
Does it have to do with how the Eagle Union's anti-sub exercise went, by any chance?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Essex：</span><br>
You never fail to impress with your ability to read my mind...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Shangri-La：</span><br>
All I need is one glance at that gloomy look of yours to know Enterprise is the cause of it. Heheh~<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Essex：</span><br>
Ahem! Anyway, it's nothing important. Basically: I'm tired of living in her shadow, and blah blah blah...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Shangri-La：</span><br>
So... You need a strategy to beat – or at the very least, surprise – Enterprise in the next exercise?<br>
Would you like me to help come up with a plan?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Essex：</span><br>
You'd help?! I-I mean... Sure.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Shangri-La：</span><br>
Absolutely. I first and foremost want to be of assistance to you, but I also want to verify how accurate my behavioral analysis of Enterprise is.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Essex：</span><br>
I really appreciate the help. Thank you!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Shangri-La：</span><br>
As someone once said, "if you know the enemy and know yourself, you need not fear the result of a hundred battles."<br>
So it's been since ancient times, but it rings doubly true when one is up against Enterprise.<br>
We should combine your combat experience with my records of her in order to come up with a solid strategy.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Essex：</span><br>
Good point...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Shangri-La：</span><br>
Let's put together a special training regime for you. We'll need to use everything at our disposal to maximize your chances of winning.<br>
Ah, Commander, you could observe us if you'd like. This is nothing top-secret, strictly speaking.<br>
<br>
Since she offered me, I figured "why not?" and decided to come along.<br>

Clash of Minds<br>
Later, at the Exercise Area...<br>
Shangri-La's and Essex's special training was under way.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Essex：</span><br>
Glad to see you could make it, Commander. Now, Shangri-La, what are we doing today?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Shangri-La：</span><br>
Well, based on the data I gathered from the previous exercise...<br>
In a simple 1-versus-1 battle against her, your odds of winning are rather low.<br>
However, if you avoid direct confrontation and team up on her, you may stand a good chance at defeating her.<br>
I say we test the plan I devised to see how it works in practice.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Essex：</span><br>
I see... So I can gain the upper hand by splitting my forces like this?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Shangri-La：</span><br>
Indeed. Your aircraft have the technological edge over hers, and you should use this to your advantage.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Essex：</span><br>
Right! I've got a feeling like this will actually wo–<br>
<br>
Before Essex can finish, a third party appeared out of the blue.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Hornet：</span><br>
Howdy!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Essex：</span><br>
H-Hornet?! What brings you here?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Shangri-La：</span><br>
Hornet, please, don't startle us like that.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Hornet：</span><br>
Oh, sorry! Had no idea you'd be so deep in thought... Oh hey, the Commander's here too! What fun stuff are all y'all up to?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Shangri-La：</span><br>
Essex is undergoing special training so that she can defeat Enterprise in the next exercise battle against her.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Hornet：</span><br>
Beat Enty, huh? Sounds hard, but I love me a challenge! Mind if I join in?<br>
Huh, interesting... It's a solid plan all right, but I feel it's based a little too much on numbers and data.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Shangri-La：</span><br>
Data is the basis for all theories. For that matter, isn't Enterprise's ability also based on empirical data?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Hornet：</span><br>
Well, yeah, but there's more to it than that. You gotta be able to improvise, or have a plan B. Things don't always go as you expect.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Shangri-La：</span><br>
...It seems we fundamentally disagree on this topic. Perhaps we could have a mock battle to see whose methodology is superior.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Hornet：</span><br>
Sure, I'm down for that! It'll be like a preliminary before the final showdown!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Shangri-La：</span><br>
All right, then I say we have the battle in three days. Essex and the Commander can be our judges.<br>
Psst, Essex... I'm sorry for dragging you into this, but will you do it?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Essex：</span><br>
Why not? It's not every day you get this serious about something. Hahahah.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Hornet：</span><br>
Sounds like we have ourselves a battle, then!<br>
<br>
And it sounded like I'd gotten dragged into being their referee...<br>

Know Your Enemy<br>
Two days before the mock battle...<br>
Port - Eagle Union Dormitory<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Essex：</span><br>
Wait, you're going to ask Enterprise of all people?!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Shangri-La：</span><br>
I am. After all, the quickest way to learn more about a person is to ask the people close to them.<br>
Which, in Hornet's case, aside from Northampton, would be her sisters.<br>
Greetings. I hope this isn't a bad time.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Enterprise：</span><br>
Not at all, but what brings you two here?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Shangri-La：</span><br>
Well, you see...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Enterprise：</span><br>
Huh, so basically, you're here to ask about Hornet? You sure are diligent.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Shangri-La：</span><br>
Would you mind answering our questions?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Enterprise：</span><br>
Since the answers might give you an edge over her, I'm a bit reluctant...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Yorktown：</span><br>
I say why not? This is a good chance to get to know each other, plus an opportunity to reminisce about both Hornet and myself.<br>
Also, Shangri-La could tell us about herself and we'll forward the info to Hornet. That makes us fair and square.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Enterprise：</span><br>
Good idea...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Shangri-La：</span><br>
An exchange of information it is, then. Let us do it.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Enterprise：</span><br>
All right, we'll start with Hornet. First of all, she's...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Hornet：</span><br>
Ahh... Achooo!<br>
*sniff*... I've got a hunch like somebody's talking about me...<br>

The Enemy of My Enemy<br>
The day before the mock battle...<br>
Port - Exercise Area<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Shangri-La：</span><br>
According to my notes, she should be here momentarily...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Zuikaku：</span><br>
Whew... That was some training, all right. I'm beat.<br>
Hm? Who are you?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Shangri-La：</span><br>
Nice to meet you, Zuikaku. I am Shangri-La, an Essex-class aircraft carrier.<br>
I know it's rather abrupt, but do you have a moment? I'd like to ask you some questions about the Yorktown class.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Zuikaku：</span><br>
The Yorktown class, eh! Is this about the Grey Ghost?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Shangri-La：</span><br>
Oh, no, I was actually wondering about Hornet, not Enterprise...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Zuikaku：</span><br>
Hornet, huh... Might wanna ask my sister, Shoukaku. She might know more.<br>
I'll call her over for you. Heeey! Shoukakuuuu!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Shoukaku：</span><br>
What is it, Zuikaku?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Shangri-La：</span><br>
It's a pleasure, Shoukaku. I have some questions, if you don't mind...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Shoukaku：</span><br>
Ah, so you're gathering information to give you the upper hand over her?<br>
In that case, I would be happy to share what I know!<br>
She is courageous and stands up to any challenge, no matter how dangerous.<br>
Like Zuikaku, she is tenacious and refuses to give up, even when the odds are against her.<br>
She is a worthy opponent. I would go as far as saying she can rival the Grey Ghost in strength.<br>
Oh, sorry, I never paused for you to ask questions... Um, Shangri-La? Are you listening?<br>
<br>
*intense scribbling*<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Zuikaku：</span><br>
Holy cow, look! She's written down every single thing you said!<br>
<br>
Their conversation, if one could call it that, carried on for a while.<br>

The Ace Up Her Sleeve<br>
Day of the mock battle, at the Exercise Area...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Essex：</span><br>
Are you ready?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Shangri-La：</span><br>
I'm all set. All there is to do now is put my plan into practice.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Hornet：</span><br>
That plan's not gonna do you any good if someone throws a wrench into it!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Shangri-La：</span><br>
Perhaps, but wrenches can be dodged if you know their trajectory. Especially if the wrench is slow and predictable.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Zuikaku：</span><br>
Hahah! They sure sound fired up!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Enterprise：</span><br>
I'm curious to see how this will go.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Yorktown：</span><br>
We're rooting for you, Hornet!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Shangri-La：</span><br>
I'm quite surprised by how many people came here to spectate...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Hornet：</span><br>
Heheh, yeah. By the way, just so you know: mock battle or not, I'm not gonna go easy on you!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Shangri-La：</span><br>
Neither will I. Now, if you're ready, let us begin!<br>
<br>
The two were evenly matched and the battle could go either way.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Hornet：</span><br>
Give 'em hell, planes!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Shangri-La：</span><br>
There's a 90% probability that's a feint... I won't fall for that!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Hornet：</span><br>
Tsk! Then how about THIS!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Shangri-La：</span><br>
I expected you'd try that!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Enterprise：</span><br>
Looks like the pressure's mounting on Hornet.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Shoukaku：</span><br>
Gathering intel on Hornet seems to be paying off for her. Hehehe~<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Yorktown：</span><br>
The match isn't over yet. Hornet can still turn the tables on her.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Shangri-La：</span><br>
Shangri-La will forever be out of reach if this is the best you can do!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Hornet：</span><br>
Heh, really? I beg to differ! Poke the hornets' nest and you end up with an angry swarm above your head!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Shangri-La：</span><br>
Wha–?! She's launched every bomber at her disposal?!<br>
<br>
The surrounding area became enveloped in the white smoke of the dummy shells.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Enterprise：</span><br>
Well, I'll be damned...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Yorktown：</span><br>
They both achieved hits on each other at the same time.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Essex：</span><br>
So... it's a draw...<br>

After the Battle<br>
The following day, at the office...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Shangri-La：</span><br>
Good morning, Commander.<br>
<br>
Shangri-La changed a bit after that battle...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Shangri-La：</span><br>
Did you pull another all-nighter yesterday? *sigh*... Have I not made it clear that it's bad for your health?<br>
...Pardon? You're worried about me?<br>
I do appreciate the concern, but there's nothing for you to–<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Hornet：</span><br>
Howdy! I brought the gang along!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Shangri-La：</span><br>
Why, hello, Hornet!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Hornet：</span><br>
But first: I've gotta thank you for what you taught me yesterday!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Shangri-La：</span><br>
For teaching you what?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Hornet：</span><br>
The importance of keeping notes and doing research on people you're up against! Had I done the same, I might've won!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Shangri-La：</span><br>
If anything, you taught me a valuable lesson: that you can't rely on data and probabilities alone.<br>
I'd like to show you something, if you don't mind.<br>
Shangri-La fetches a photo album from a nearby shelf.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Hornet：</span><br>
Hey, nice pics! But who snapped them?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Shangri-La：</span><br>
I got a little help from the Commander and the people who came to watch. I felt the need to fully document everything possible.<br>
These will be added to my collection of photo albums soon, but I wanted to show these to you all before that.<br>
Shangri-La takes out the pictures and passes them around.<br>
My personal favorite of them all is this one...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Hornet：</span><br>
I remember this! It's from right after our mock battle yesterday!<br>
<br>
The photograph is of everyone who was in attendance yesterday: Essex, Shangri-La, Hornet, Enterprise, Yorktown, Zuikaku, and Shoukaku. All smiling.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Shangri-La：</span><br>
I've titled it "Friends," but I don't know what to write for the description on the back. Does anyone have any ideas?<br>
<br>
To her, this photograph represented the moment she made her first friends since arriving at the port.<br>
