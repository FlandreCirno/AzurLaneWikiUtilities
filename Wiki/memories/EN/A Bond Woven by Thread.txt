1 An Invitation from Watarase<br>
Sakura Garden - Terrace<br>
The warm afternoon sun filters through layers of cherry blossoms, casting intricate shadows onto the stone below.<br>
Watarase sits on her knees beside an elegant tea table, carefully embroidering golden patterns onto deep-blue fabric.<br>
A shishi-odoshi bamboo rocker rhythmically clunks against the rock. At the same time, she notices my presence, and her focused gaze softens into a smile.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Watarase：</span><br>
Oh, Commander, you're here. I was just brewing gyokuro tea. Would you like some while it's still warm?<br>
<br>
She offers a cup of tea that emanates a wonderful aroma.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Mmm... Just smelling it is relaxing.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Watarase：</span><br>
I'm glad you like it. You know... I asked you to come today because I wanted to discuss a stage play being held by the Sakura Empire.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Hm? I'm fairly sure I approved the relevant permits already.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Watarase：</span><br>
Yes, and we're procuring costumes and preparing the stage thanks to that. But...<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Are you having trouble?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Watarase：</span><br>
No... I have a personal request. I'd like to try my hand at performing on stage this time...<br>
Not as a behind-the-scenes helper, but as a performer. Wearing a costume I made with my own hands, experiencing the feeling of being on stage.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Okay. Do you have a performance in mind?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Watarase：</span><br>
Yes, actually. I'd like to write a script based on the story of Princess Shirataki.<br>
Exact details are still in the works, though.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Princess Shirataki? Designing costumes for that must be a lot of work.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Watarase：</span><br>
Hehe, you don't need to worry about that. I'm taking care of it.<br>
But what makes the story of Princess Shirataki really moving isn't the clothes.<br>
Commander... May I ask you to perform with me?<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Hmm. I wouldn't mind an extracurricular activity or two, but wouldn't that double your workload?<br>
You still have daily sword training, and if you're going to sew a costume for me, I'm not sure if you'll ever have time to rest.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Watarase：</span><br>
Commander.<br>
<br>
She smiles softly and strokes the fabric. That fresh embroidery shines beautifully in the light.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Watarase：</span><br>
Look at this pattern, please. With colored thread as the weft, I used special techniques to make this gorgeous design. When the light hits it, it reveals its complex yet elegant beauty.<br>
Like me... When I am needed, I will take up my blade to protect the port and the people I love as a warrior.<br>
But now, as someone who wields needle and thread, I simply want to create a costume for you with all my love.<br>
Be it brewing tea, sewing costumes, or wielding a sword... All of these things are part of my life. They might as well be rest.<br>
<br>
A gentle breeze blows, lifting the deep-blue fabric. It gently drapes over the scabbard at her feet.<br>
She gingerly lifts both fabric and sword alike.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Watarase：</span><br>
I've kept this fabric for a long time, actually.<br>
At first, I planned to make a waistcoat, of sorts, to wear under your uniform as a reliable extra layer of protection.<br>
But I decided, what if I go all-out and use this to make a stage costume for you, instead?<br>
Umm... With me, that is...<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Then I'd be happy to.<br>
Uh, I will need you to help me out with rehearsing, though. And the script, of course.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Watarase：</span><br>
Heehee... I promise, I'll weave my feelings into a one-of-a-kind costume for you.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
I look forward to that.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Watarase：</span><br>
And I'm happy to hear that. But first, come with me. We have preparations to make.<br>

<br>
2 Unmeasurable Distance<br>
Sakura Garden - Workshop<br>
The setting sun shines through wooden lattice windows, warming a room full of hanging fabrics. The mingled scents of cotton and dye fill the space.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Is this where you've been sewing?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Watarase：</span><br>
That's right. All of my tools are here.<br>
Come this way, Commander. Sit here for me.<br>
<br>
She picks up a tape measure and shows me to a well-lit spot in the room.<br>
Then, she kneels down and places the chilly tape measure along my ankle. Her long, open sleeves cascade onto the floor around her.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Watarase：</span><br>
Relax and stand upright for me, okay?<br>
<br>
The tape measure moves upward along the seam of my pants. Her fingertips gingerly grasp the scale, occasionally brushing along my leg.<br>
I can't help but focus on how the atmosphere has changed.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Watarase：</span><br>
I'm sorry, Commander. The costume has to fit you like water, so my measurements have to be perfectly precise.<br>
Take a deep breath in for me, please.<br>
There. Now slowly exhale.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Phew... I'm surprised you're being this particular.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Watarase：</span><br>
Heehee, the costume is for you, so I insist.<br>
Plus, you're performing in a play. You wouldn't want to go out there with clothes that don't fit.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Fair enough.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Watarase：</span><br>
Let's do your shoulders next.<br>
<br>
She circles behind me, wraps her arms around, and puts the tape measure around my shoulders.<br>
Her warm breath tickles my neck, sending a shudder down my back.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
That... tickles a little.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Watarase：</span><br>
I'm sorry. How about now?<br>
<br>
This time, her fingers barely touch my shoulder blades.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
You don't have to hold your breath. That just surprised me, that's all. I'll get used to it.<br>
<br>
At those words, she leans in a little closer. The tape measure touches the bottom of my neck, and I feel its cold against my heartbeat.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Watarase：</span><br>
Excuse me... Can you lift your chin a little? Ah... Was I too forceful?<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
No, it's okay. You don't have to worry so much.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Watarase：</span><br>
Okay. Sorry if this doesn't make sense, but making clothes is like sharpening a blade. You need to be fastidious over the details.<br>
For example...<br>
<br>
She gives my collar a slight tug, and even that small adjustment makes my throat feel sort of constricted.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Watarase：</span><br>
If a collar is too cramped, it'll get caught with every turn you make. That gets in the way of a performance.<br>
Princess Shirataki wouldn't let her beloved go on stage in ill-fitting clothes. Isn't that right, Commander?<br>
<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项1：I get it. Details matter.</span>'''''<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项2：Yeah. I'll take this seriously.</span>'''''<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项1）</span>'''''I get it. Details matter.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项2）</span>'''''Yeah. I'll take this seriously.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
If we want the audience to be immersed in the world we create, then we need every aspect to be perfect.<br>
It's the little things that make or break a performance, even if they don't seem critical at first.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Watarase：</span><br>
Immersion in the role is fundamental for an actor, yes, but to immerse the audience as well is no easy feat.<br>
The tiniest flaw on stage can divert their attention at any time.<br>
Even if they can't explain why, they will notice that something FEELS wrong.<br>
<br>
Watarase finishes measuring me throughout our conversation, jots down the numbers with her pen, and returns the tape measure.<br>
Her eyes shine in the warm afterglow. A roll of crimson silk falls from a shelf above, covering our overlapping shadows like a robe.<br>

3 Woven Emotion<br>
Sakura Garden - Workshop<br>
As twilight begins its reign over the sky outside, lights turn on one after another in the workshop.<br>
Watarase stashes away her notebook and opens a camphorwood cabinet behind her.<br>
Fabrics of all colors practically cascade out and cover the long table – plain white velvet, light-grey silk, pale-blue chiffon, and more.<br>
Her fingers glide over the layers of fabric as a smile spreads over her lips.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Watarase：</span><br>
Commander, are you satisfied with the fabric I was preparing earlier?<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
I'm happy to let you decide.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Watarase：</span><br>
Hehe. Then next comes the lining. I'll need to touch you directly for this one.<br>
<br>
She spreads out a roll of ivory-white cotton and presses it gently to my inner forearm. It feels like a warm cloud on my skin.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Watarase：</span><br>
How is it?<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Hmm... Very soft.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Watarase：</span><br>
This is cotton cloth. It's absorbent and breathable, so it works well for high-action scenes. It also works quite well with the outer layer we chose.<br>
Now... How about this one?<br>
<br>
This time, she places the light-blue silk against my wrist. It feels chilly on my skin.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
It's chilly and smooth... Maybe a little too thin, though?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Watarase：</span><br>
Don't worry about that. I plan to line it with layers. Like this, for example...<br>
<br>
She folds the fabric over a few times and holds it together while pressing it to my skin again.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Watarase：</span><br>
Now what do you think?<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Hmm... It's kind of warm. I like this.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Watarase：</span><br>
Heehee. Okay, then this layer will be the one that touches your skin.<br>
It will need a magic touch before it can fit perfectly to your skin, though... Can I borrow you again for a while?<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Of course. What should I do?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Watarase：</span><br>
After I prepare the fabric, stand up straight here for me. That's all you need to do.<br>
<br>
Watarase spreads the previously chosen dark-blue fabric over the large cutting table and uses a piece of tailor's chalk to draw smooth arcs on it.<br>
Then, she cuts it with left-handed scissors. They make a satisfying slicing sound as they glide like a boat over water.<br>
Carefully taking the pieces she has just cut, she checks the shape against me and pins them with sewing pins.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Watarase：</span><br>
We'll need to support specific areas to really draw out your figure.<br>
<br>
This time, she fits the lining to the back of the main fabric pieces. With a delicate needle in hand, she starts to sew. Her eyelashes cast shadows under the warm lighting.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Watarase：</span><br>
The trim will be dark blue to complement the rest, and as for the seam... What do you think would be best, Commander?<br>
<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项1：Ash grey?</span>'''''<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项2：Dark blue?</span>'''''<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项1）</span>'''''Well, how about ash grey? It should tie the whole color scheme together.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Watarase：</span><br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项1）</span>'''''I think that's a great match. Would you grab the second spool over there for me, please?<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项2）</span>'''''Well, how about making it dark blue, too? Let it blend with the fabric to make it look literally seamless.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Watarase：</span><br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项2）</span>'''''That's a lovely idea. Would you grab the third spool over there for me, please?<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Gladly. I'm surprised I got the chance to help you, even if it is just picking up some thread for you.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Watarase：</span><br>
You advised me on the color, too. Hehehe, I'll have you know that you've been a big help.<br>
Only through the interweaving of warp and weft can something beautiful be made. It's a lot like human cooperation.<br>
<br>
As light casts our two shadows onto the fabric, the golden needle and silver scissors gleam in her fingertips. In this night, a silent bond seems to be woven between us.<br>

4 Warmth in Fabric<br>
Sakura Garden - Workshop<br>
A dark-blue garment lies flat on the work table. Its collar and sleeves are adorned with golden vine patterns that shine in the morning light.<br>
Watarase's fingers gently trace the inner lining, where intricate, hidden patterns are embroidered in ash-grey silk. It's a secret warmth, meant only for the skin to feel.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Watarase：</span><br>
I hope you're ready to try it on?<br>
A costume is akin to an actor's second layer of skin. When you put it on, you feel the life in the stage.<br>
<br>
I feel the weight of the costume, watching it rise and fall on my chest in time with my breathing.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
It might be... a little tight in the shoulders?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Watarase：</span><br>
I see... Your shoulder muscles will flex when you swing your sword, so we'll need a little bit of slack there. Don't worry – I'll fix it up right away.<br>
Okay, stand straight for me. The light will hit you from above onstage.<br>
If you slouch even a little, your shadow will appear much shorter.<br>
<br>
She puts a hand on my waist and steps in front of me, fastening a shakudo copper brooch to my collar. It's cold against my neck.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Watarase：</span><br>
This position should be perfect for the shape of your collar. Try moving your neck for me... Is it uncomfortable?<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Perfectly fine with me.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Watarase：</span><br>
Good. Except... I noticed your heart is beating unusually fast.<br>
Is the costume too heavy? Or... are you just imagining the two of us performing onstage together?<br>
<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项1：It's the costume.</span>'''''<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项2：I might be a little nervous.</span>'''''<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项1）</span>'''''You're right. It's very comfortable, but it is heavy.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Watarase：</span><br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项1）</span>'''''Is that so? You said it was chilly before, so I added an extra layer of lining. I'll remove that later.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项2）</span>'''''You're right. The thought of going onstage is a little nerve-wracking.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Watarase：</span><br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项2）</span>'''''Hehe, don't worry. I'll be with you, and whatever happens, we can just call it part of the show.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Thanks for that.<br>
<br>
She retrieves a leather belt, crouches down, and wraps it around my waist. Her long, black dress spreads across the floor like an inky blossom.<br>
Once the buckle is fastened, I reflexively tense up.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Watarase：</span><br>
Aww, don't be so tense. This is just to help support you, not to torture you.<br>
<br>
When I try relaxing my shoulders, I'm amazed to find that the belt doesn't feel tight anymore. It really feels like it's supporting me.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Watarase：</span><br>
Hmm... I should tighten the waist a little so that it can provide better core support.<br>
The tightening of the buckle will focus your mind, like using a sword's sheath to bolster its momentum when you draw it.<br>
<br>
She hands me a wooden sword along with the simile.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Why do you have this here...?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Watarase：</span><br>
Heehee, it's my workshop. When I'm tired of sewing, I like to swing it around a little to take my mind off things.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
That's how you relax?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Watarase：</span><br>
It may sound odd to you, but it's just a way of refocusing myself. Likewise, when I'm tired of training, I make clothes to take my mind off of that.<br>
Could you try swinging it for me? See if the cuffs feel too tight when you do.<br>
<br>
I accept the sword and swing it downward. My costume dances from the force, drawing a golden arc in the morning light.<br>
At the same time, I feel it being tugged back a little by my upper arm.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Right here... About from my underarm to my shoulder, it feels a little hard to move.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Watarase：</span><br>
Okay, then I'll need to widen the sleeves a little. Stage movements have to be more dramatic for the audience to see, so we can't have you feeling restrained.<br>
The bottom half seems to be just right, though. It moved beautifully with your sword swing, so I'd call that a success.<br>
The blade shines in the light, and you move the costume... Now we begin to see how a dynamic performance is built.<br>
<br>
Morning sunlight casts our shadows onto a wall of fabric. The warmth of her hands passes through the costume and to my skin, transforming into quiet affection and protection.<br>

5 Princess Shirataki<br>
Theater - Backstage<br>
Faint morning light filters through the curtains, lighting up the dust wafting throughout the stage.<br>
Watarase hands me the play script she just finished. Between the neatly printed lines of text, handwritten notes are scattered like inky butterflies.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
I understand the part about conveying emotion through songs, but what's this about imprisonment and elopement, exactly?<br>
And swordfighting scenes during their escape, too... I don't think this stuff was in the original story.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Watarase：</span><br>
The original story lacks a certain... ebb and flow to the action. It's a little too quiet for a modern stage production.<br>
This is our one chance to stand onstage together. I want to really liven up the story by escalating its conflict and putting the two of us into it.<br>
I think that's the best way to make this a memorable performance.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
...Is that how it works?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Watarase：</span><br>
Hehehe, relax. This may be my first script, but I've consulted with the port's most accomplished authors in the field of adventure.<br>
They happened to like it, too.<br>
<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项1：Most accomplished authors?</span>'''''<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项2：Why do I feel like this has happened before?</span>'''''<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项1）</span>'''''Who would they happen to be?<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项1）</span>'''''Oh... I think I know who you mean.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项2）</span>'''''Well, if they really liked it, I guess...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Watarase：</span><br>
Oh, my. Do you happen to have qualms with my script?<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
No. I think your ideas are good.<br>
But this scene where I fight our pursuers alone? I don't know if I can handle that much action.<br>
<br>
I try swinging the prop sword. I'd call myself an okay swordsman, but compared to the others at port, I'm far too much of a novice.<br>
Watarase suddenly charges toward me with her script in hand. The smell of her soap tickles my nose as she taps an annotation in the margin.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Watarase：</span><br>
Read it again – Princess Shirataki fights off the pursuers alone, not you. This is a fight for the person she loves.<br>
All you have to do is give the signal, and I'll handle the rest.<br>
<br>
She hands me her sword, sheath and all, and places her hand over mine.<br>
Then, she guides my arm to a proper sword swing. Her giggling is backed by the sound of bamboo clunking onto the floor.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Watarase：</span><br>
See? One swing, and the story is set into motion.<br>
Stories are like plain cloth: beautiful, but they won't truly shine without a touch of golden embroidery.<br>
The comfort of a peaceful conclusion would not feel nearly as precious without the threat of enemy arrows along the way.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
You don't think the audience will find it... cliché?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Watarase：</span><br>
They might, but when the princess fights off a hail of arrows for the sake of her beloved...<br>
That moment of heart-pounding tension is my goal. That's the fabric of something more meaningful than mere story.<br>
<br>
She mimes a swordsman parrying arrows, stepping in front of me protectively. Her drooping sleeves are like wings spread in the sunlight.<br>

6 Far from Seamless<br>
Theater - Stage<br>
I sing as I approach center stage amidst the spotlights shining the color of moonlight. My dark-blue costume ripples with every step.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Watarase：</span><br>
Commander... You were incredible. We only rehearsed a few times, but your breathing, your eye movements, and even the arcs traced by your fingers were all perfect.<br>
<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项1：All thanks to your patient teaching.</span>'''''<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项2：Only because my princess was kind enough to instruct me.</span>'''''<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Watarase：</span><br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项2）</span>'''''Heehee...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Watarase：</span><br>
Now... would you like to take the final act's hidden mechanism for a spin? I designed it myself.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
You can make those, too?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Watarase：</span><br>
Hehehe, a few. Pitfalls, raining arrows, and some little contrivances behind the scenes... So? Ready to give it a try?<br>
<br>
I look around at the floor, the beams, and beneath the curtains, but I don't see any of her mechanisms.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Did you really? I don't see any.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Watarase：</span><br>
They're hidden, so I'm quite glad that you can't see them.<br>
Don't worry. Just follow my...<br>
<br>
CLICK!<br>
Before she can finish speaking, I hear a distinct click somewhere above us.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Watarase：</span><br>
Oh. That was an experimental one.<br>
Just follow behind me, Commander.<br>
<br>
A hidden compartment opens up above, and arrows shower down around us.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Watarase：</span><br>
Commander, duck!<br>
<br>
When I promptly crouch down to evade them, a white figure rushes by.<br>
In the blink of an eye, she deflects all of the arrows.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Watarase：</span><br>
Three steps to the right now!<br>
<br>
I follow her lead and move to the edge of the stage.<br>
There's a metal creaking as the floor opens in the center, revealing a deep hole.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
You really did make pitfalls... Very intimidating.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Watarase：</span><br>
Of course. A smooth elopement wouldn't be very demanding of a princess's sword.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Uh-huh... Hey, Watarase, behind you!<br>
<br>
I spot another pitfall in a surprising side of the stage and reflexively reach out to stop her.<br>
RRRRIP!<br>
We fall into the hole together, and I realize that it has cushions on the bottom. However, my costume catches on the mechanism, tearing open a half-foot-long gash in it.<br>
Watarase looks up from her position in my arms. When she sees the tear, she visibly saddens.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Watarase：</span><br>
Commander! Are you okay?<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
I'm fine. The floor is soft, so no worries there.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Watarase：</span><br>
I'm sorry. I forgot to disable this trap after setting it up for earlier scenes.<br>
And your poor costume... This is all my fault for adding unnecessary scenes.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
I do feel bad about the costume, but it's a good thing neither of us got hurt.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Watarase：</span><br>
Right... As long as you're safe. If you weren't, I...<br>
*sigh*... It's too late for apologies now.<br>
I wanted to make the performance seamless, but in the end, it was my blunder that ruined it.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
No, Watarase. It may not be perfectly seamless, but that just gives you an opportunity to weave new memories into it, no?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Watarase：</span><br>
Hehehe... That's a bit of a stretch.<br>
But a garment filled with memories... I do like that idea.<br>
<br>
The silvery spotlights spill through our intertwined fingers, illuminating the tear in my costume.<br>

<br>
A Bond Woven by Thread<br>
<br>
7 Blossoms on the Fabric of Your Heart<br>
Sakura Garden - Beneath a tree<br>
Pale-pink petals blanket the stone path like snow. Watarase lays out the blue costume on the sunlit carpet, where the tear stands out even more.<br>
She sits on her knees, skillfully using a sewing needle to mend it.<br>
Meanwhile, I lean on a nearby sakura tree, retrieving various tools and threads for her as needed. Each time the wind blows, petals fall and dot the fabric.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Watarase：</span><br>
It's a large tear, so it's going to take more than mending. And it might open back up onstage...<br>
I'll have to reinforce it with fabric of the same color on the inside.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Here you go. I found this scrap in your workshop and thought it was the perfect size.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Watarase：</span><br>
Well done, Commander. This is the perfect color and texture.<br>
*sigh*... Despite my best efforts to make the repair inconspicuous, it does affect the original design profile.<br>
And the embroidery I worked so hard on cuts off here...<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Perfection is one thing, but I think this is unique in its own way.<br>
Besides, it's full of our memories.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Watarase：</span><br>
Memories... Yes, if you say so.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
"Shirataki, chains may be easy to break, but the prison of the heart is not."<br>
<br>
Her eyelashes droop sadly. Unconsciously, my fingers flip through the script to a page I know by heart.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Watarase：</span><br>
"If you are imprisoned so, then let my sword be that which frees you!"<br>
<br>
She keeps up her sewing efforts and replies without missing a beat.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
That line isn't in the script.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Watarase：</span><br>
True. I suppose I would be more likely to say that than would Princess Shirataki.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
But I like how it sounds. Why not add it to the finale?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Watarase：</span><br>
Gladly!<br>
<br>
I continue flipping through pages and idly reading my lines.<br>
Each time, she replies without hesitation and without stopping her work.<br>
As the final stitch is sewn, sunset dyes the golden thread crimson. The fresh stitches gleam in the light.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Watarase：</span><br>
...It's just occurred to me that the final scene could use some revisions.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
How so?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Watarase：</span><br>
"Perfection is one thing, but I think this is unique in its own way." That's what you said, right?<br>
I'd like to include that kind of uniqueness in our performance.<br>
<br>
She gently plucks the script from my hand, opens it to the last page, and rips off the perfect ending she'd envisioned.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Watarase：</span><br>
Blank space has so much more potential than the perfect end.<br>
"The princess's blade crafts a hairpin from a spring branch; her beloved's garments wear the fallen blossoms as their design."<br>
"Thus, year after year..."<br>
<br>
Watarase touches a cherry blossom petal that's fallen onto my shoulder and then leans her head on me.<br>
Tired yet satisfied with her work, she sets our script aside and leaves that unfinished final chapter to be carried on the winds.<br>
