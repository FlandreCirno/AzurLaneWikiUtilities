Chapter 1: A Christmas Conundrum<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Warspite：</span><br>
This dress might be good, but... Actually, on second thought...<br>
No, a dress wouldn't nearly suffice for Her Majesty. Besides, the dress I've chosen clearly lacks class...<br>
... I'm at a loss. I haven't the slightest clue what Her Majesty wants for Christmas!<br>
Sigh, what should I do...<br>
Hm? Who is... Oh, it's you, Cygnet. Sorry for not noticing you.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Cygnet：</span><br>
Eep! G-greetings, Warspite... I-I'm sorry for disturbing you...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Warspite：</span><br>
Not at all. I was just pondering what presents to get for the people of the Royal Navy.<br>
Speaking of which, didn't you help prepare everyone's presents last year, Cygnet?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Cygnet：</span><br>
I-I did! But I'm fairly sure that I only helped by going shopping for food and snacks...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Warspite：</span><br>
Food and snacks... Not quite what I had in mind. Still, thank you for the input.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Cygnet：</span><br>
B-b-but I haven't even given any input worth a thank-you!<br>
Um... If you'd like, I could help you with your presents! I'm not sure how to help, but I'll find a way...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Warspite：</span><br>
Don't be like that. Two heads are always better than one. And with two heads, let's go a-head and head to the store!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Cygnet：</span><br>
Of course! ... Wait, we're leaving already?! I-I'll get my coat...!<br>

<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ooshio：</span><br>
Hold yer horses, Urakaze~! I'm not done yet!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Urakaze：</span><br>
My patience has run out! How on Earth can you spend over two hours picking out presents?!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ooshio：</span><br>
I done told you, I got a lotta people to give to! 'sides, weren't you the one who talked 'bout givin' presents to everyone?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Urakaze：</span><br>
Grrr... F-fine. I'll be generous and give you another hour!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Warspite：</span><br>
Hm? Good day, Sakura Empire destroyers. What seems to be the matter?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ooshio：</span><br>
Why, if it ain't Warspite 'n Cygnet~ What're y'all here for?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Warspite：</span><br>
To pick out some presents. Although we haven't decided on what to get yet.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Cygnet：</span><br>
G-greetings...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ooshio：</span><br>
Aw heck, we can't have you cute girls in trouble, can we... If there's anythin' we can help ya with, just say the word.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Urakaze：</span><br>
No, please don't say the word! Ooshio's not even done picking presents for her own friends!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Warspite：</span><br>
In that case, we'll leave you to it. But if you don't mind my asking... Are those outfits you're wearing this year's Christmas costumes?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Urakaze：</span><br>
It is. This is my handmade Warring States-style yuletide uniform. Hohoh, no need to tell me it looks good. I know it does~<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ooshio：</span><br>
Mine's handmade too! This here's my reindeer costume for deliverin' Christmas presents~ Ain't it brimmin' with holiday spirit?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Warspite：</span><br>
I see... A handmade costume would be perfect for Christmas. The time required to make it is an issue, though...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Cygnet：</span><br>
W-we don't have time to make enough Christmas costumes for everybody!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Warspite：</span><br>
... Gah, we won't get anywhere if we can't even decide what presents to get!<br>
Maybe we should simply ask everyone what they want...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Cygnet：</span><br>
B-but then it won't be a surprise when they open their present...!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Warspite：</span><br>
Then what do you suggest?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Cygnet：</span><br>
Maybe we could ask somebody from the Eagle Union...? Enterprise might have an idea, since she was Santa last year...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Warspite：</span><br>
Ask someone else, eh? Well, we don't have any better ideas at the moment, so let's try it... Ladies, if you'll excuse us. Have a Merry Christmas!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ooshio：</span><br>
You have one, too~ See ya 'round, Warspite~<br>

Chapter 3: The Shadow over Christmas, Pt. 1<br>
Port - Eagle Union Dormitory<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Hornet：</span><br>
Ah, it's beginning to look a lot like Christmas! Although thinking of Christmas gives me chilling flashbacks to Enty's Santa costume last year...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Sims：</span><br>
I don't mind getting presents, but I'd be anxious about having her as our Santa again...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Saratoga：</span><br>
Heh heh heh! Personally, I quite liked her costume! But I say it's time for Sara to take on the role this year and–<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Lexington：</span><br>
No, Sara. No mischief during Christmas. We can't have you causing a ruckus on such a beloved holiday, can we?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Vestal：</span><br>
Enterprise is away from port on a mission at the moment. It's a little lonely here without her...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Hornet：</span><br>
Thank gosh for that! I can't for the life of me keep a straight face and accept a present from Santaprise. Let's pick a new Santa, while she's–<br>
<br>
(Knock knock)<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Hornet：</span><br>
Aw, heck! She's not back already, is she?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Warspite：</span><br>
Greetings, my Eagle Union friends! We were hoping to ask Enterprise a question. Do you know where she is?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Vestal：</span><br>
Hello there, Warspite. Sadly, Enterprise isn't here. She's out on a mission and hasn't returned yet.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Cygnet：</span><br>
Oh. Well... we wanted to ask her what would make a good present for our friends, since she has experience with being Santa...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Saratoga：</span><br>
Did I hear someone say 'presents'? Sara knows just the girl for you to talk to!<br>
She should be in her room right now. I'll take you to her!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Warspite：</span><br>
She's also from Eagle Union, I take it? Very well, show us the way!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Cygnet：</span><br>
Is it fine to just ask her directly like that...?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Saratoga：</span><br>
Of course! The Eagle Union is built on openness and freedom! Come on, follow me!<br>

Chapter 4: The Shadow over Christmas, Pt. 2<br>
Saratoga led the two before the door to a room.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Saratoga：</span><br>
Louis~! Sara's brought you visitors! They want your advi– Oh, oops...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Honolulu：</span><br>
Eeeeek! K-knock before you enter someone else's room!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Saratoga：</span><br>
What are you wearing?! Are you going to offer yourself as a kinky present to the Commander?!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Honolulu：</span><br>
It's not what you think! Th-this is a... you know, that thing people do... A cosplay! That's the word!<br>
You couldn't be more wrong if you think I was going to hide in a box wearing this reindeer outfit then pop out and say "I'll be your present!" when the Commander opens it!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Saratoga：</span><br>
Yikes, didn't even need to say it myself... It's okay, Lulu, Sara will just pretend this never even happened!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Honolulu：</span><br>
You'd better! And don't speak a word of this to anyone!<br>
<br>
Saratoga took the Royal Navy girls and quickly left the room.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Warspite：</span><br>
Getting in a box and giving yourself as a present to the Commander... That's an interesting, if unusual idea.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Cygnet：</span><br>
Warspite, please! It's too bizarre to be worth considering!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Saratoga：</span><br>
Personally, I also think it'd be a little... weird if you do that, Warspite.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Warspite：</span><br>
Ah, I see... Then we still don't have any good ideas. Hmm, we're running short on time...<br>
<br>
(Fwoosh)<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Enterprise：</span><br>
Merry Christmas! Santa's brought presents for you nice girls!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Hornet：</span><br>
Enty! You're back!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Vestal：</span><br>
Welcome back, Enterprise~<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Enterprise：</span><br>
No, no. In this moment, I'm not Enterprise, I'm Santa Claus! ... Oh, I see the Royal Navy is paying us a visit.<br>
Sorry, I didn't intend to show myself to you like this.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Warspite：</span><br>
Not at all, you actually came at the perfect time! We need your help!<br>

Chapter 5: Warspite's Wish<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Warspite：</span><br>
You see, I'm struggling to come up with good presents for my Royal Navy friends.<br>
(My word, that's a large bag of presents she's got...)<br>
And it takes quite some time to pick out presents for that many people. Unfortunately, time is a luxury we don't have...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Enterprise：</span><br>
That's not an issue. It should hardly take any time to go to the store and purchase things.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Warspite：</span><br>
It takes you hardly any time?! Do you plan out what to buy before you even leave the dorm?! Please, tell me your secret!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Enterprise：</span><br>
Plan out? Secret? Maybe I didn't make myself clear, but I'm not that selective when it comes to buying presents.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Warspite：</span><br>
Then how do you find the present that's just right for someone?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Enterprise：</span><br>
You don't need to fuss over finding the right present. They'll probably be happy just to receive a present in the first place, because it's the thought that counts.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Warspite：</span><br>
Ah, the thought behind it... I see now. It's not about the item itself, but the feelings it represents!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Enterprise：</span><br>
Exactly. Hey... this conversation gave me an idea. You should be Santa this year, Warspite.<br>
Do you have a Christmas costume ready?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Warspite：</span><br>
If it's the thought that counts, surely a costume wouldn't be necessary?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Cygnet：</span><br>
W-Warspite, you could... use the Christmas costume my sisters and I made, if you'd like...<br>
It's a spare one, so we would be delighted to see it put to use!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Warspite：</span><br>
I can't turn down an offer like that. Thank you, Cygnet! I feel the thought behind your offer loud and clear!<br>
All right, let us head to the store to buy some presents!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Cygnet：</span><br>
P-please, don't put it that way... You're making it sound weird...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Enterprise：</span><br>
The Royal Navy will surely have an interesting Christmas with Santa Clauspite around. Hahahah!<br>

Port - Nighttime<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Warspite：</span><br>
Phew, we've almost finished getting presents for everyone! Saint Nick would tip his fluffy hat to us if he saw how swift we were!<br>
Now all that remains is Her Majesty's special present!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Cygnet：</span><br>
Didn't Enterprise say we don't need to fuss over giving people the "perfect present"...?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Warspite：</span><br>
It's fine, I know exactly what she wants. I noticed how she had her gaze fixated on a particular stuffed animal when I was out shopping earlier.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Cygnet：</span><br>
Well... then I'm sure Her Majesty will adore it!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Warspite：</span><br>
This is unfortunate... We purchased too many presents to carry by ourselves...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Cygnet：</span><br>
I'm sorry... I shouldn't have bought so many snacks...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Warspite：</span><br>
Blast it... Our Christmas is doomed...!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">？？？：</span><br>
Ho ho ho, you seem to be in a frozen pickle there! But worry not, Santaprise is here!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Warspite：</span><br>
Enterprise! Thank goodness! Ah, and Nicholas too?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Enterprise：</span><br>
Looks like you could use some help transporting those presents. If you want, you could place them on my eagle sleigh.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Nicholas：</span><br>
Hop aboard, it'll be fun... You have Saint Nicholas's word for it...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Warspite：</span><br>
You're lifesavers! Err, Christmas-savers, rather. You both have my gratitude!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Cygnet：</span><br>
Thank you so much! Please take us to the Royal Navy dormitory!<br>

<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Warspite：</span><br>
Marvelous! We've gotten all the presents in one place!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Cygnet：</span><br>
*Pant*... *Pant*... Now I understand what they mean by holiday fatigue... But I'm glad I was able to help...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Warspite：</span><br>
All that is left is to hand them out! It's time for the old lady to get to work!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Cygnet：</span><br>
I-I think I need to rest for a bit...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Warspite：</span><br>
Whew, almost done. Now just to deliver this stuffed toy to Her Majesty...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Queen Elizabeth：</span><br>
Warspite...! You've brought me a present?!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Warspite：</span><br>
Yes, Your Majesty! Merry Christmas! I sincerely hope this humble gift will be to Your Majesty's liking!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Queen Elizabeth：</span><br>
... N-no, I'm not very fond of it! In fact, it's not to my liking whatsoever!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Warspite：</span><br>
If that is so, then I shall see to it that it is immediately disposed of, Your Majesty!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Queen Elizabeth：</span><br>
Halt! Place it over there for the time being. It would be a waste to simply throw it away... Especially after you just gave it to me...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Warspite：</span><br>
As you command, Your Majesty!<br>
Now all presents have been delivered. I hope everyone's having a merry Christmas...<br>
... Hm? What's with this leftover box...?<br>
What in the–?! It's making noise!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Nicholas：</span><br>
Good morning... Huh...? Where am I...?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Warspite：</span><br>
Nicholas?! How did you get in there? Aha, were you... wrapped up in the hustle and bustle of Christmas?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Nicholas：</span><br>
No puns first thing after I wake up, please... I think I fell into the box when you got on the sleigh... then fell asleep cause it's so comfy in here...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Warspite：</span><br>
I-I see... Well, this certainly was a surprise for both of us...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Enterprise：</span><br>
Hey, sorry for barging in! Warspite, have you seen Nicholas? She was with me just earlier...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Warspite：</span><br>
... Funny you say that, Enterprise! She's right here. Think of her as my present to you!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Nicholas：</span><br>
Huhhh? I'm a present now...? I guess that's fine... I don't mind being Enterprise's present...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Warspite：</span><br>
Let's just say you're a... gifted girl, Nicholas. To you, and to all, Merry Christmas!<br>
