<br>
Southern coast of Greenland, near Cape Farewell<br>
The silhouette of a little girl formed beneath the waves. She was sneakily swimming her way forwards, heading for a white leaf which had suddenly poked out from under the water.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">U-556：</span><br>
Foooound yooou!<br>
<br>
Grabbing hold of it like a gardener would a weed, the girl uprooted the strange leaf-shaped object.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">U-110：</span><br>
*Gasp*!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">U-556：</span><br>
I'm 10-and-0 now! Time to admit your defeat!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">U-110：</span><br>
Unfaaaaiiir. My dorsal fin sticks out.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">U-556：</span><br>
... That's just your hair, not a dorsal fin. And weren't you the one who suggested playing hide-and-seek in the first place?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">U-110：</span><br>
The real game begins noooow. Raaaawr.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">U-556：</span><br>
... You said that when I won for the 5th time!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">U-110：</span><br>
Doesn't count because I didn't say raaaawr then.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">U-556：</span><br>
Well, I wouldn't mind playing a little more, so... Wait, this is no time for games! We have a mission to do!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">U-110：</span><br>
Actually, today I'm in the mood for a picnic.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">U-556：</span><br>
Lord Bismarck entrusted us with this important mission! Who cares what you're in the mood for!<br>
I repeat: "Prized wolfpacks of the Iron Blood, you must not let a single enemy transport vessel pass through!"<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">U-110：</span><br>
If a pack of wolves went into the ocean, they'd all droooown.<br>
But U-110 is a shark, so those orders don't applyyyyy. Lookie look.<br>
The Iron Blood submarine proudly swung her dorsal fin-like hairstyle from side to side.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">U-556：</span><br>
L-look, we're not literal wolves, we're called a "wolfpack" as a metaphor! Lord Bismarck's orders were... Hey! Stop looking at me like I don't make any sense!<br>
*Sigh*... I'm too tired to try to explain it to you...<br>
Anyway, let's go carry out our mission! An enemy's appeared somewhere nearby!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">U-110：</span><br>
Alrightyyyy. U-110, sharky shark, ready to embaaaark.<br>

<span style="color:#4eb24e;">U-556：</span><br>
Phew! We got them all! One step closer to that Knight's Cross!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">U-110：</span><br>
With the enemies all gone, can we play now?<br>
U-110 reached into her backpack and took out her Enigma machine.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">U-556：</span><br>
... Hey, what did I tell you about playing with the Enigma machine?!<br>
Remember how you made headquarters panic last time you sent a word search puzzle through telegram?<br>
Listen, Lord Bismarck told me to look after you! So come on, put it back in your backpack!<br>
And if you don't do as I say, then I won't play with you anymore!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">U-110：</span><br>
... You're meeaaan. Booooo.<br>
U-110 did as she was told and put the Enigma machine back.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">U-556：</span><br>
*Sigh*... Oh, I received a message from Lord Bismarck! I have to go for a bit, so keep watch here by yourself!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">U-110：</span><br>
…………<br>
What she doesn't know can't hurt her. Time to play, in seeeecret.<br>
I love you, Enigma. My preeeecious~!<br>

<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Amazon：</span><br>
I'm not picking up anything on my sonar or radar...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Bulldog：</span><br>
It seems that Iron Blood submarine whose transmission we detected got away.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Amazon：</span><br>
Blast those sneaky buggers! They're toying with us like it's a game for them!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Bulldog：</span><br>
Perhaps they are, but nevertheless we must take our escort duties seriously.<br>
Escorting ships is an important and respected job, after all.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Amazon：</span><br>
You're right... Still, I'm bothered by how we can't read their messages even if we intercept them.<br>
Hmph... If only they'd leave a codebook lying around here somewhere.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Bulldog：</span><br>
I doubt they would leave behind such critical documents.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Amazon：</span><br>
I'm just saying it would be nice if they did!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Bulldog：</span><br>
Certainly, it would be nice, IF they did...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Amazon：</span><br>
... Oh, forget it! That aside, I've had enough of being caught off guard by those Iron Blood submarines!<br>
I was expecting to find them right away with the help of my outstanding leadership skills, and yet we've had no such luck!<br>
Once we're home, I need to blow off some steam. Maybe I'll put a ton of hard questions on the Lecture Hall quiz...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Bulldog：</span><br>
Taking out your anger on others probably isn't the most mature thing to do.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Amazon：</span><br>
Hmph!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Bulldog：</span><br>
And since you'd then need to buy their trust back with candy, you're better off not doing it in the first place.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Amazon：</span><br>
Hmpphhh...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Bulldog：</span><br>
Speaking of which, you wouldn't even be in this situation in the first place if you didn't go bragging about "how you'd show them how escort duty is supposed to be done."<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Amazon：</span><br>
Mmmpphhhhhhh...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Bulldog：</span><br>
At this rate, your reputation as an instructor might go down the-<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Amazon：</span><br>
Oh, would you SHUT UP already?!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Bulldog：</span><br>
There there, let's calm down a little.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Amazon：</span><br>
Stop patting my head!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Bulldog：</span><br>
Hm... That's odd. Beagle always calms down when I pat her on the head...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Amazon：</span><br>
Don't assume that she and I are alike!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Bulldog：</span><br>
... Oh, my sonar seems to be picking up something.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Amazon：</span><br>
Please, it's just a diversion, or your sonar is malfunc... Wait, there really IS something nearby...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Bulldog：</span><br>
I believe an Iron Blood submarine has fallen for our bait.<br>

<span style="color:#4eb24e;">U-110：</span><br>
That's my second cargo ship destroyed. U-110 is a shark. Raaaawr.<br>
Off to find a new targeeeet...<br>
Huh? Who are you...?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Bulldog：</span><br>
We are Royal Navy destroyers. Unfortunately for you, we are not cargo ships.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Amazon：</span><br>
There you are, submarine! You won't escape us a second time!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">U-110：</span><br>
... *Blub blub blub*<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Amazon：</span><br>
Don't you try to leave without saying a word!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">U-110：</span><br>
Amazon fired a warning shot at U-110, who'd only dove just beneath the water. U-110 resurfaced and poked her head above the surface.<br>
What a rude little girl...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Amazon：</span><br>
State your name! And aren't you a little girl yourself?!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">U-110：</span><br>
…………<br>
U-110 is a shaaaark. Fear meeee.<br>
U-110 shook her "dorsal fin" side to side, seemingly trying to intimidate the Royal Navy destroyers.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Amazon：</span><br>
... Excuse me?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Bulldog：</span><br>
Are you... garlic?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">U-110：</span><br>
... Garlic?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Bulldog：</span><br>
Yes, garlic.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Amazon：</span><br>
... What sort of conversation even is this...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Bulldog：</span><br>
Sharks are rather cool. At least, in my opinion, they are.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">U-110：</span><br>
Mhm, I'm coooool. And scaaaryyy. Raaaawr.<br>
Whatever cry sharks supposedly make, U-110 imitated it in an attempt to scare Bulldog.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Bulldog：</span><br>
You, however, are not a shark. You are a bulb of garlic. I am thoroughly disappointed.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">U-110：</span><br>
I'm not a bulb of garlic, I'm a shaaaark.<br>
You'll be sorry for making fun of U-110!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Bulldog：</span><br>
(Whispering) Amazon, it's time!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Amazon：</span><br>
Come again?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Bulldog：</span><br>
(Whispering) She's stopped moving; this is our chance!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Amazon：</span><br>
What? ... Oh, right, I remember!<br>
Hah hah! It's time for an example of how anti-submarine warfare is really done!<br>

<span style="color:#ec5d53;">U-110：</span><br>
So many depth charges... You island ape meanies...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Amazon：</span><br>
Hmph! If it gives us a tactical advantage, we'll use it!<br>
<span style="color:#ec5d53;">U-110：</span><br>
... Ugh. Maybe U-556 isn't coming baaaack.<br>
I don't wanna fight anymore. I'm going home. Then I'm gonna take a baaaath.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Amazon：</span><br>
We'll listen to your prattle later! Hold still and stop struggling!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Bulldog：</span><br>
Speaking of baths, I remember seeing you check out people's chests in the bathhouse, Amazon.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Amazon：</span><br>
Huh?!<br>
<span style="color:#ec5d53;">U-110：</span><br>
Hmm, hmm... Thanks for the infoooo.<br>
I check them out toooo.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Bulldog：</span><br>
Do you like big ones, U-110? Amazon seemed especially fixated on Cygnet's.<br>
<span style="color:#ec5d53;">U-110：</span><br>
Hmmm, I dunno. But I'm sure Hipper likes those.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Amazon：</span><br>
Why are you discussing such an inappropriate topic?!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Bulldog：</span><br>
Desiring that which one cannot have is a sign of maturity, is it not?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Amazon：</span><br>
Oh yeah? But you're just as flat!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Bulldog：</span><br>
Now that you mention it, that is true.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Amazon：</span><br>
Exactly! Which means this conversation is done and over! Full stop!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Bulldog：</span><br>
It seems someone's using this as a running-away opportunity.<br>
<br>
Bulldog pointed her finger at U-110, who was trying to dive and get away again.<br>
<span style="color:#ec5d53;">U-110：</span><br>
Shoot, the jig is uuuup.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Amazon：</span><br>
You little...! Don't you try to flee when people are talking!<br>
<span style="color:#ec5d53;">U-110：</span><br>
Then can I leave when you're done?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Amazon：</span><br>
Why do you think we would just let you get away?<br>
<span style="color:#ec5d53;">U-110：</span><br>
Why not?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Amazon：</span><br>
Oh, for the love of... Do any of you have any sense of urgency?<br>

<span style="color:#4eb24e;">U-110：</span><br>
Royal Navy, more like Royal Meanies.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Amazon：</span><br>
Uh-huh...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">U-110：</span><br>
You're all bullies.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Amazon：</span><br>
Yeah, yeah...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Bulldog：</span><br>
Command will be pleased that we managed to prize an Iron Blood submarine.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Amazon：</span><br>
Let's hope we can get some sort of clue on the codebooks out of her...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Bulldog：</span><br>
Indeed...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">U-110：</span><br>
What's in my backpack? That's a secreeeet.<br>
The Enigma machine? Yup-yup, U-110 loves the Enigma.<br>
Playing codebreaking games on it is super fuuuun.<br>
Codebooks? Bismarck warned me not to tell anyone about those, so I woooon't.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Bulldog：</span><br>
It doesn't seem she'll tell us anything.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Amazon：</span><br>
Well, when they won't give in, you use the stick and carrot method! Say, how would you like a lollipop?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">U-110：</span><br>
A lollipop? You mean I can have it?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Amazon：</span><br>
Only if you give us a lead on the Enigma machine and the codebooks! Fair trade, no~?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">U-110：</span><br>
U-556 is watching me, I'm not falling for your triiiicks.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Bulldog：</span><br>
Amazon, I just detected another submarine.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Amazon：</span><br>
... Hmph, then that confirms that you work in packs!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">U-110：</span><br>
Yup-yup. We doooo.<br>

<span style="color:#4eb24e;">U-556：</span><br>
U-110! Are you okay?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">U-110：</span><br>
I'm okay, they only captured me.<br>
<br>
U-110 seized a chance to flee and regroup with U-556, who had come to help.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">U-556：</span><br>
That's still pretty dangerous, you know?! Don't go off and get captured while I'm not looking...<br>
*Ahem*! Anyway, what's done is done! Our first order of business right now is to stun them with a counterattack before we run away!<br>
I, Parzival of the Seas, will...<br>
Uwoooah?!<br>
<span style="color:#ec5d53;">Bulldog：</span><br>
We are launching the first strike.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">U-556：</span><br>
That's so unfair! I haven't even finished introducing myself yet!<br>
<span style="color:#ec5d53;">Bulldog：</span><br>
Then I will do the same. I'm the B-class destroyer Bulldog. Nice meeting you.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">U-110：</span><br>
U-110 is a shaaaark. Fear meeee.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">U-556：</span><br>
You're fine, you don't need to introduce yourself! Go on, get out of here!<br>
<span style="color:#ec5d53;">Bulldog：</span><br>
......<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">U-556：</span><br>
Hey, what the heck?!<br>
<span style="color:#ec5d53;">Bulldog：</span><br>
Did you not allow me to attack you once you finished your introduction?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">U-556：</span><br>
Uh, I STILL haven't gotten to introduce myself!<br>
<span style="color:#ec5d53;">Bulldog：</span><br>
You're U-556, yes? At least, that's what she called you.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">U-110：</span><br>
Yup-yup.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">U-556：</span><br>
Be quiet already, U-110!<br>

<span style="color:#4eb24e;">U-556：</span><br>
Oww! Submarines really aren't meant for face-to-face combat...!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Amazon：</span><br>
That must be breaking news for you! If you want to run away like a coward, now's the time!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">U-556：</span><br>
Dang it... Crash diving...!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Amazon：</span><br>
……<br>
She got away again... Bulldog, you all right?<br>
... Bulldog?<br>
Bulldoooooog!<br>
Ow, my eyes!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Bulldog：</span><br>
... Right here. I'm all right.<br>
Amazon? I'm sorry if I blinded you.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Amazon：</span><br>
Uhhhh-huh...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Bulldog：</span><br>
Unfortunately, the submarine managed to escape.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Amazon：</span><br>
Grrr... If we don't know where they're headed, our transport ships will be attacked again...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Bulldog：</span><br>
You don't need to worry about that.<br>
I managed to acquire the codebooks, an Enigma machine, and the Iron Blood's nautical charts.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Amazon：</span><br>
How on Earth did you...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Bulldog：</span><br>
I shall explain later. For now, let's join up with the rest of our fleet.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Amazon：</span><br>
Hmm... Yes, let's. Standing around here will get us nowhere.<br>
<br>
Amazon looked in the direction U-556 swam towards.<br>
Her sonar is still picking up signs of Iron Blood submarines, but they seem to be going way off course from where their cargo ships are heading.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Amazon：</span><br>
They might destroy our cargo ships even if we chase after them now, and then all would be for nothing.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Bulldog：</span><br>
Given that they are a wolfpack and we haven't seen their third submarine yet, we should proceed with caution.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Amazon：</span><br>
That's the idea! We'll spare those pesky subs, for now!<br>
<br>
With the Enigma machine and codebooks in their hands, the two destroyers headed back to the area where their cargo ships were positioned.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Amazon：</span><br>
... By the way, what was thing you did earlier?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Bulldog：</span><br>
It's a secret.<br>

*Gasp*! I-I finally managed to throw them off...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">U-110：</span><br>
I'm glad you're okay, U-556.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">U-556：</span><br>
Bwah! Don't scare me like that...<br>
They're not chasing you, are they? Okay, then let's use this chance to run away!<br>
<br>
And then...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">U-556：</span><br>
*Pant*... I thought we were dead for sure...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">U-110：</span><br>
I'd say my ruse deserves a thank yooouu.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">U-556：</span><br>
True... You drew their attention as well, which is why we managed to get away.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">U-110：</span><br>
Yup-yup.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">U-556：</span><br>
So, what was your ruse, even?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">U-110：</span><br>
I feigned death. Then I dropped my backpack to slow Bulldog down. It was noooot easy.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">U-556：</span><br>
Well, nicely done... Just don't do anything that dangerous again, okay? Next time, they might take your lollipop away from you!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">U-110：</span><br>
Okey-dokey.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">U-556：</span><br>
Also, you keep your Enigma machine and codebooks inside your backpack, right? You retrieved it afterwards, didn't you?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">U-110：</span><br>
... Oh.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">U-556：</span><br>
OH!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">U-110：</span><br>
Oh...<br>

<br>
A summary of the confrontation between Bulldog and U-110...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">U-110：</span><br>
(Oww, so briiiight...)<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">？？？：</span><br>
"Do you wanna live?"<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">U-110：</span><br>
(Plays dead.)<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">？？？：</span><br>
(It doesn't seem this will work... Umm, let's try...)<br>
"What about your friend, then?"<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">U-110：</span><br>
......！<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">？？？：</span><br>
"If you wanna save her, hand over your treasure."<br>
"Give it to me, and in exchange, I'll spare your little friend."<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">U-110：</span><br>
............<br>
... My... friend...<br>
Okay, I'll give you my backpack.<br>
(I'll drop it in the ocean, then swim away while she's picking it up. Perfect plan.)<br>
Just my backpack, okaaay? No peeking at what's insiiiide.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">？？？：</span><br>
Oh, look, she actually dropped it.<br>
And that is how I managed to acquire the Enigma machine and the codebooks.<br>
<br>
Thus went Bulldog's after-action report.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Amazon：</span><br>
... Wait, that's it...?<br>
