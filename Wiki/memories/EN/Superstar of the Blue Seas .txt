Superstar of the Blue Seas<br>
<br>
Chapter 1 - The Marine Idol!<br>
It was a peaceful day, and I was enjoying some time off.<br>
The port was hosting a charity drive, and Saratoga plus a few others were planning to take part and help raise money.<br>
And the theme of the charity drive? Well...<br>
Apparently, it's to "help protect the seas! Join Sara and friends in the search for the Mythical Seal, said to bring luck to whoever finds it!"<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Saratoga：</span><br>
That's the gist of it! Now let's go look for the Mythical Seal, Commander!<br>
<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项1：...?</span>'''''<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Saratoga：</span><br>
C'mon, we'd better move out now! If we don't, someone else will find it before us!<br>
<br>
We... what...?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Saratoga：</span><br>
Hasn't anybody told you, Commander? There have been confirmed sightings of the Mythical Seal in certain regions!<br>
I'm telling you, it's not just an excuse for a theme! We've all decided we should go find it and give it shelter!<br>
Look, Akashi even made special gear to help us catch it!<br>
<br>
Is that a... Mythical Seal radar?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Saratoga：</span><br>
She worked pretty hard on it! It's never been tested before, but let's hope it works.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Lexington：</span><br>
It's not every day you see Sara as motivated as this~ I'm glad to see you raring to go.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Saratoga：</span><br>
Hey, Lexington!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Lexington：</span><br>
Hi there. I'm just here to hand in this report.<br>
I do have to say it's wonderful to see everyone doing their part to help protect the seas.<br>
Say, Commander, won't you be so kind as to help my little sister find the Mythical Seal?<br>
And Sara, be nice and don't cause any trouble for the Commander, okay?<br>
<br>
Well, it's for charity. Besides, this "Mythical Seal" has got me curious, so I suppose I'll offer a hand in finding it.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Saratoga：</span><br>
Fantastic! Thanks, Commander!<br>
<br>
Oh yeah, Saratoga's wearing a new outfit...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Saratoga：</span><br>
Finally noticed, have you? Hehehe~ I had it especially prepared for the fundraiser concert! I'm Sara, Superstar of the Blue Seas!<br>
<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项1："It looks great on you."</span>'''''<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Saratoga：</span><br>
With this radar and my knowledge, we'll catch the Mythical Seal in the blink of an eye! I've almost read so many books on marine life that I've got fish on the brain!<br>
If you have any aquatic inquiries, just ask, Commander! Professor Sara can teach you anything♪<br>
<br>
And so we set out on a journey in search for the Mythical Seal.<br>

<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Aylwin：</span><br>
Hmm... It doesn't seem the Seal is in this area...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Dewey：</span><br>
Aylwin, my radar is picking up something in that direction!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Aylwin：</span><br>
Okay! You lead the way! (Lexington has her hands full at the moment, so we need to do the best we can on our own...!)<br>
<br>
......<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Hardy：</span><br>
Hey, Hunter... Remember the "nefarious kraken" that Sara spoke of? Does such a thing really exist?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Hunter：</span><br>
... You've asked that question more than 40 times, Hardy. Does this Hunt frighten you? Then you may head back.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Hardy：</span><br>
Hah! Me? Frightened? I'm here to ensure you won't stand motionless when something frightens YOU!<br>
<br>
......<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Jamaica：</span><br>
It's a dream of mine to become a marine biologist and write a thesis on starfish. It goes without saying I'll protect the sea!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Baltimore：</span><br>
Hahah, that's the spirit! We've gotta search every aquatic nook and cranny for that Seal!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Bataan：</span><br>
Umm, Baltimore, everyone else is heading that way... Sh-should we really go this way?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Baltimore：</span><br>
Hey, there's no rule that says we must search nearby areas where we pick up readings. We'll outwit them by purposely heading in the opposite direction!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Birmingham：</span><br>
Cleve... I will continue down my own path...!<br>
<br>
......<br>
We came across several of the other teams as Saratoga and I were looking around.<br>
It seemed that everyone was taking their respective searches for the Mythical Seal pretty seriously.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Saratoga：</span><br>
I can really tell how excited everyone is this time around!<br>
<br>
Apparently, this legend about a creature which brings good luck may have contributed to the lively atmosphere.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Saratoga：</span><br>
(Whispering) I kind of made up that part about it bringing good luck, though...<br>
<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项1：...?</span>'''''<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Saratoga：</span><br>
N-nope, I didn't say anything! C'mon, we'd better speed up, Commander!<br>
I'm picking up readings thataway!<br>
<br>
Following the readings on the Seal radar, our little journey continued.<br>

Chapter 3 - Protectors of the Seal<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Saratoga：</span><br>
Hmm, I'm almost sure it headed in this direction...<br>
<br>
Following the reported sightings of the Seal, I thought we had managed to get a good lead on the Seal's whereabouts.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Saratoga：</span><br>
We're getting close, Commander! I know it!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">South Dakota：</span><br>
Sorry, Commander, but I'll have to ask you to stop there for a moment.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Massachusetts：</span><br>
Right, uh... "We are the Protectors of the Seal."<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Alabama：</span><br>
"If you want to pass through here, then you must first answer our question."<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">South Dakota：</span><br>
"We will not give the Seal's location to evildoers who cannot answer this question."<br>
<br>
They spoke in a lazy manner, like a bored voice actor just phoning in their lines...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Alabama：</span><br>
So, the question is: what family does the earless seal belong to?<br>
<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项1："Phocidae."</span>'''''<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项2："Panthera maritimus?"</span>'''''<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项3："I'd like to use a lifeline for this one... Saratoga?"</span>'''''<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Saratoga：</span><br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项1）</span>'''''Wow! Spot on, Commander!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Saratoga：</span><br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项2）</span>'''''That's like bad Latin for "sea lion"! Also, sea lions have ear flaps! The correct answer is "Phocidae"!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Saratoga：</span><br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项3）</span>'''''Heh heh! The answer is "Phocidae"!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Alabama：</span><br>
Ding ding ding. All right, you can move along.<br>
<br>
It seems like they'll let us pass now.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Saratoga：</span><br>
... Pfft! I never imagined you three would do something like this!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Massachusetts：</span><br>
... So? It's fun.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">South Dakota：</span><br>
They said it would be fun, and I'm along for the ride, so to speak.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Alabama：</span><br>
You not enjoyin' yourself, sis?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">South Dakota：</span><br>
That's not what I meant. I am enjoying this, as it's for a charitable cause.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Saratoga：</span><br>
Well, there's nothing wrong with having some fun at the same time! I bet many will struggle with that question!<br>
Oh, by the way, how are the preparations coming along?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">South Dakota：</span><br>
They're going well. Don't worry.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Saratoga：</span><br>
Great to hear~! Thanks for covering for me~<br>
<br>
(What "preparations" are they talking about...?)<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Saratoga：</span><br>
Okay, Commander! Let's move on!<br>

……<br>
<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项1："We must be getting close..."</span>'''''<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Saratoga：</span><br>
For sure! This is the last place it was sighted!<br>
All that's left is to roll up our sleeves and search for it!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Atlanta：</span><br>
Great job, San Diego! There's no doubt about it, this is the location of the latest Seal sighting!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">San Diego：</span><br>
See? Aren't I a genius? We'll be the first team to find that Seal~<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Juneau：</span><br>
P-pardon us, Commander!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">San Juan：</span><br>
Hey, haven't we already been here before?! We didn't find anything last time!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Saratoga：</span><br>
We're so close, and now another team is trying to get there before us?!<br>
<br>
If we're on the same course, we'll just have to speed up!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Saratoga：</span><br>
Hey! Be gentle with an idol's outfit, Commander!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Atlanta：</span><br>
C-Commander?!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">San Diego：</span><br>
Hahaha~! So, they wanna race there, huh?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Saratoga：</span><br>
Stop! Stop, Commander! It's not time yet!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">San Juan：</span><br>
Saratoga?! ... If that's how you want it, then you'll get it! Quick, everyone!<br>
<br>
Then, a large structure emerged suddenly from beneath the waves.<br>
The structure was fitted with numerous water tanks, inside of which a myriad of adorable marine animals was playing.<br>
<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项1："Is this... a stage?!"</span>'''''<br>
<br>
And then, from the center of the stage, with lights shining down on it, emerged none other than the star of the show...<br>
The Mythical Seal!<br>

Chapter 5 - The Mythical Seal<br>
Although there were a few incidents along the way, Saratoga's charity concert concluded without a hitch.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Saratoga：</span><br>
Hehehe~ Who's the cutest little seal? That's right, you are~<br>
<br>
The "Mythical Seal" – which in reality was just a regular seal – rubbed its nose against Saratoga's leg.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Saratoga：</span><br>
You see, you can't just protect cuties like this for a day and call it done. It's something you do every day and work hard at it!<br>
<br>
Had I known that, I could've offered to help sooner...<br>
<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项1：Offer to help protect the seas</span>'''''<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Saratoga：</span><br>
Thanks a ton, Commander! I was going to ask you anyway after the concert, but things just kind of went the way they did~<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Lexington：</span><br>
Sara, everything's ready in just a bit.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Alabama：</span><br>
Should be. Why don't you come too, Commander?<br>
<br>
Huh? There's more stuff going on after the concert?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Saratoga：</span><br>
It's a bit late, but today is actually when both the Sakura Empire and Dragon Empery celebrate the Night of Sevens.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ning Hai：</span><br>
Yat Sen has made mouth-watering food for the occasion, so be sure to stop by.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ping Hai：</span><br>
I'm hungry...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Akashi：</span><br>
There'll be a fireworks display too, nya~ I designed them specifically so they won't cause distress to the marine life in the tanks, nya~<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Baltimore：</span><br>
Hey... anyone else feel like we're forgetting something?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Aylwin：</span><br>
Hmm, what could that be...?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Dewey：</span><br>
The name for the little seal, I believe!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Saratoga：</span><br>
Oh, right! We can't let this cutie go nameless!<br>
Commander, do you have any good suggestions?<br>
<br>
It was decided that the name of the seal – the star of Saratoga's concert and beloved treasure of the sea – would be...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Saratoga：</span><br>
Sara... Seal... I've got it! "Sally"! Let's go with that!<br>
Okay... Commander, I'm counting on you to help me – and cute little Sally here...<br>
... protect these beautiful blue seas and all the adorable marine life it hosts! Everybody's support matters♪<br>
