<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Hestia：</span><br>
Fiiive, siiix, seveeen...<br>
<br>
It was a sunny early afternoon, and Hestia was walking along the beach while muttering to herself.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Hestia：</span><br>
Hmm... To get something to eat, or save my allowance to pay off my debt... I'm really not sure how to spend it.<br>
I don't even know what they sell here or if I can bring the money back with me to Orario. Guess worrying about it is a waste of time...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Z13：</span><br>
Hey, what's up? You look really at a loss, girl.<br>
I might be approaching you outta the blue, but don't worry, I'm not a weirdo! I'm Z13, and this is Fargo! Hope you don't mind us butting in!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Hestia：</span><br>
Oh! You two! Yeah, I was just thinking about something.<br>
See, the thing is...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Z13：</span><br>
Oh, I see! That sounds like a job for a cross-sector strategic consultant such as myself!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Fargo：</span><br>
I will also assist in exchange for getting to study your emotion index.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Z13：</span><br>
Yeah! We're gonna employ innovative and groundbreaking practices to bring you to the top!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Hestia：</span><br>
What? Uh... I don't get what that means.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Z13：</span><br>
Heh! We're gonna use your private capital and launch a startup!<br>
<br>
The sun's rays poured down relentlessly.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Hestia：</span><br>
It's so hot!<br>
How did it end up like this...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Fargo：</span><br>
Working efficiency is down 44.2% due to high temperatures... It's sooo hot...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Z13：</span><br>
You still haven't fixed the delivery drones?! Don't just sit there, Fargo! Help me out!<br>
H-Hestia, the food's done!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Hestia：</span><br>
Man, you're a real slave-driver...<br>
<br>
In the middle of summer, a business suddenly appeared on the coast – a beach restaurant.<br>
This was an idea put forth by Z13 in order to raise Hestia's wealth.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Hestia：</span><br>
*pant*... *pant*... You know, at first, I had no idea what this was supposed to be...<br>
But now, I think this beach restaurant thing isn't so bad!<br>
Okay, three servings of Heaping Crop Platters, coming right up! Also, got a Potato Poppers meal that's ready here!<br>
<br>
Contrary to Hestia's belief that this type of business was rare for a reason, the beach restaurant proved surprisingly prosperous.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Z13：</span><br>
Seems my innovative restaurant idea was a huge hit! Heheh. Sometimes even I'm frightened by my brilliant business sense!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Hestia：</span><br>
Hey! Toot your own horn in your spare time! I need help here!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ting An：</span><br>
How shortsighted of me... I thought beach restaurants were too conventional, yet look how lively theirs is.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Akashi：</span><br>
The midsummer heat's driving people crazy, nya! We've gotta jump on the bandwagon, nya!<br>
Welcome, welcome, nya! "Akashi's Summer Vacation" is open for business, nya!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ting An：</span><br>
We serve dishes from the Dragon Empery, Eagle Union, and even Iris Orthodoxy! Even the Commander approves!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Hestia：</span><br>
Wh-what the hell are they doing?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Z13：</span><br>
Well, it's no surprise that others would see our success and want a slice of that pie.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Hestia：</span><br>
Dunno anything about a "pie," but I guess that makes us business rivals, huh?<br>
If so, I'm not gonna stand here and let them outcompete us!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Z13：</span><br>
Um, Hestia... Those two are professionals. You don't stand a chance.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Hestia：</span><br>
Yeah, well, they're cheating by using the Commander's name like that!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Shiranui：</span><br>
Heehee... No entrepreneur would shy away from employing every trick at their disposal.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Hestia：</span><br>
So what if they're entrepreneurs?! I'm a god!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Akashi：</span><br>
Heh! We've got a god of our own, nya!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Shimanto：</span><br>
So... What do you need me to do? I expect an offering before anything else.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Hestia：</span><br>
In that case, what do you say to some piping hot Potato Poppers?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Shimanto：</span><br>
That sounds deli– Ahem! The Dragon God chooses to stand with her fellow god!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Akashi：</span><br>
Nya?!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Fargo：</span><br>
Hooray.<br>
I've finished calculating our revenue. Great work.<br>
<br>
The setting sun hung over the beach. It was silent, save for the gentle sounds of the wind and the waves. It was like all that commotion earlier never happened.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Z13：</span><br>
Way to go, Hestia. Here's your share.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Hestia：</span><br>
My what?<br>
<br>
Z13 gives Hestia a bag filled with "something" making a dull rattling sound.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Z13：</span><br>
You're some top-tier talent, for sure. We were able to achieve to-the-moon levels of profit thanks to you!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Fargo：</span><br>
Everything went well for once.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Hestia：</span><br>
Hahaha... I'm exhausted after all that.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Z13：</span><br>
Well, like they say, all's well that ends well. This is a win-win situation if I've ever seen one.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Hestia：</span><br>
Yeah, I guess. Do you reckon I can bring this cash with me back to Orario?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Z13：</span><br>
It's not like I'd know. Also, considering that you're a god, don't you have your own ways?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Hestia：</span><br>
Yeah, but...<br>
I just hope everything'll work out. Hopefully it will.<br>
<br>
Hestia looked at the beautiful, sparkling waves, and felt like all her worldly problems would be solved just like that.<br>

<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Akashi：</span><br>
Sorry for startling you, nya!<br>
<br>
Akashi appeared out of the blue before Ryu Lion's eyes, to the latter's shock.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ryu Lion：</span><br>
Wh-what is it all of a sudden?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Akashi：</span><br>
I heard you're an extremely skilled adventurer, and I wanted to ask you for a favor, nya.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ryu Lion：</span><br>
In other words... you'd like to employ my services? I didn't think there'd be extermination quests even in this world.<br>
Very well. What do you need me to exterminate?<br>
You want me to be your supervisor in creating a dungeon?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Akashi：</span><br>
More precisely, I want you to be my supervisor for an amusement facility with a dungeon theme, nya!<br>
An element of realism is necessary in the pursuit of fun, nya. And when you want realism, you should ask those with the most experience, nya!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ryu Lion：</span><br>
An amusement facility? I'm afraid I can't–<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Akashi：</span><br>
W-wait, hear me out, nya! It's the only thing I'll ever ask from you, nya! The Commander also really wants your expertise, nya!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ryu Lion：</span><br>
*sigh*...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Akashi：</span><br>
Please consider it, nya! I promise it won't cause you any trouble, nya!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ryu Lion：</span><br>
...Alright. Since the Commander requests it, I will give it a try.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Akashi：</span><br>
Awesome, nya! I really appreciate your help, nya!<br>
<br>
Sometime later...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Guam：</span><br>
Testing, testing... The weather's great, and the Commander's in a good mood.<br>
Okay, it's finally time for the grand opening of the port's latest attraction: The Dungeon of Orario!<br>
This is the world's first-ever dungeon based on the real deal from another world! You won't believe how authentic it is!<br>
This project was done in collaboration with Miss Ryu Lion, a seasoned adventurer who's achieved remarkable feats in an actual otherworldly dungeon!<br>
Under her supervision, this impregnable dungeon that'll put your dungeon crawling skills to the test was born!<br>
There are whispers that whoever conquers this place will seize all the riches and fame in the world...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ryu Lion：</span><br>
I wasn't informed that there'd be any prizes. I'd prefer it if they didn't use my name in that case.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Albion：</span><br>
I believe that's what Akashi would refer to as a "publicity stunt."<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Centaur：</span><br>
The only tangible things you may receive are a crystal medal and a proof of completion.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Evertsen：</span><br>
What does "put your dungeon crawling skills to the test" mean?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ryu Lion：</span><br>
Dungeon crawling skills shouldn't be put to any tests...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Guam：</span><br>
...Looks like Hero quickly broke the vase in the Commander's office and got the item!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Hero：</span><br>
Heh! Go figure that this attraction is a walk in the park!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Guam：</span><br>
Uh-oh! She slipped and fell into a spike pit! That's gotta hurt!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ryu Lion：</span><br>
Oh no! I can't stand by and let others get injured in this facility!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Centaur：</span><br>
It's okay, Elder Ryu. The floor and the spikes are actually made of soft materials.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Guam：</span><br>
Sadly, that's game over for Hero! But don't be discouraged, because you can always try again!<br>
That's one, that's two... Denver is absolutely blitzing past obstacle after obstacle!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Denver：</span><br>
Time is money, and I gotta show you what a Knight of the Sea can do!<br>
Oh no! That poor little puppy! Hang on, I'll save you!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ryu Lion：</span><br>
How did a dog get in here? Is it... a mirage?!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">De Zeven Provinciën：</span><br>
I'm pretty sure you get a game-over if you go into that– Aahh!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Akashi：</span><br>
Nyahaha! You fell for the illusion, nya! My poor puppy bait worked wonders, nya!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Javelin：</span><br>
Javelin the Brave Hero, full speed ahead!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Z23：</span><br>
Considering that Akashi had a hand in this, I think we should tread carefully.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ayanami：</span><br>
Oh. The boss has spawned.<br>
<br>
An enormous dragon covered in crimson scales appeared before the group of heroes.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ryu Lion：</span><br>
Is that a Valgang Dragon?<br>
So they even managed to replicate that... They must've been very serious about this.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Laffey：</span><br>
It got me... Zzz...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Guam：</span><br>
Javelin never even stood a chance! There was nothing she could've done! It's like fighting a cheater!<br>
Hang on, CAN you even beat this thing? Seems a little unfair to the players!<br>
<br>
CLICK...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Guam：</span><br>
Hold on, someone from the host booth just... Wait, could it be? Supervisor Ryu Lion has joined the battle!<br>
Holy cow, look how fast she is! She's clearing all the obstacles! They don't even have the chance to start up!<br>
Heck, she's too fast for my commentary to keep up! She's made it to the final boss in a blink!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ryu Lion：</span><br>
Now in the skies of the distant forest... Luminous Wind!<br>
<br>
KABOOOM!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Akashi：</span><br>
Nyaaa! My attractiooon, nyaaa!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Javelin：</span><br>
Thank you, Ryu! We had so much fun! The boss felt a bit cheaty, but the rest of it was really exciting!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ryu Lion：</span><br>
Please, I didn't do anything to deserve such thanks.<br>
Moreover, this dungeon didn't...<br>
<br>
She held the crystal medal in her hand, and gazed at the girls excitedly taking on the dungeon.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ryu Lion：</span><br>
...Contain any real enemies.<br>
