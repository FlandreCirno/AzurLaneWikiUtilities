In a place unknown, shrouded in darkness...<br>
In a place that makes no sound, wrapped in silence...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Fubuki：</span><br>
Mgh... Mmgh...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Observer ：</span><br>
Oh, you're finally awake. You were out for a long while, sleepyhead.<br>
I was starting to worry you'd given up the ghost. Seems I won't need to arrange a funeral.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Fubuki：</span><br>
Where... am I...?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Observer ：</span><br>
Heheh. You're in my secret room, and I invited you here.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Fubuki：</span><br>
...Who are you?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Observer ：</span><br>
What a boring question. Here I thought you'd ask something more... pertinent.<br>
Like, "Am I dead?!" for a start.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Fubuki：</span><br>
I'm afraid I know my state of being quite well. What I need to know at this moment is where I am, and also...<br>
Just who and what are you?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Observer ：</span><br>
Heheheh. So calm and composed. But you're bluffing, aren't you? I do like a bluff.<br>
But your elevated heart rate isn't doing a good job of selling it.<br>
Anyway, you're asking who I am? Frankly, I'd appreciate it if you wouldn't concern yourself with that.<br>
Explaining everything would be a huge hassle, you see.<br>
You don't like being kept in the dark, I'm sure, but I'd like you to forget about that and assist with my research for a while.<br>
I'll let you go home once I'm happy with the results. That is, assuming you play nice. Otherwise, maybe I won't.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Fubuki：</span><br>
......<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Observer ：</span><br>
You don't trust me? Yes, that's only natural...<br>
However, whether you trust me or not doesn't change your situation one bit.<br>
Let me guess. You think you've pieced the answer together now, no?<br>
Then let me apologize and leave you with this – take your time and enjoy yourself.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Fubuki：</span><br>
......<br>
What in the world is going on?<br>
I wonder where the girls are... I hope they're safe.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Observer ：</span><br>
Heheheh. These values are more interesting than I projected. This will be fun.<br>
<br>
Shinobis – they were shadows who lived long ago during the Warring States era.<br>
They hid among crowds, they snooped, provoked, deceived, and assassinated.<br>
Where there was dirty work, there were shinobis to undertake it.<br>
As time went on, they disappeared from the public consciousness, becoming little more than legends.<br>
But, though the people had forgotten them, the nature of man was still what it was.<br>
Those who lived in the dark underworld were still needed.<br>
Shinobis have continued to exist to this day.<br>
And here, in a faraway land, a battle of theirs was beginning to unfold...<br>

<br>
At sea - Night<br>
Akatsuki - On a regular patrol<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Akatsuki：</span><br>
Ah, what a calm and peaceful day. Nothing out of the ordinary, and nothing to be afraid of...<br>
It's so quiet. TOO quiet... I think I'd prefer it if the Sirens came to attack...<br>
No, no, no! What am I saying? I'd much rather be a little scared than be chased around all day!<br>
Maybe if I pinch myself, the pain will distract me from... Actually, I don't want to hurt. Oh, I know! Some stargazing may lift my spirit!<br>
That reminds me, either Ikazuchi or Inazuma said I should wish upon a falling star not to be scared...<br>
If I do just that, hopefully I won't have to be afraid on my patrols anymore.<br>
Yeah! I'll keep my eyes on the sky and ignore the murky water under my feet!<br>
...That said, I'm not really seeing any falling stars tonight.<br>
Most days, I'll usually notice a few whether I'm paying attention or not.<br>
<br>
Just then, there was a twinkle in the sky.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Akatsuki：</span><br>
Oh! There's one! Okay, now to make my wish... Please let me not be scared, please let me not be scared...<br>
<br>
The thing she thought was a falling star did not vanish. It seemed to be going toward her.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Akatsuki：</span><br>
What the...? Am I imagining it, or is it coming this way? It almost looks like it's getting bigger...<br>
<br>
It drew closer and closer to where Akatsuki was...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Akatsuki：</span><br>
AAAHHHH!<br>
I don't think that was a falling star – it might've been a new Siren superweapon! And it crashed into that islet over there...<br>
Thank goodness it didn't hit me. *sigh*, I suppose now I must investigate before I can report what happened...<br>
I really don't want to, but they'll get mad at me if I don't... I wish Hibiki were here so I could ask her to do it.<br>
<br>
At sea - Morning<br>
Akatsuki - Forcibly scouting the area<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Akatsuki：</span><br>
Hmm... I'm fairly sure this is the impact zone. I can't see anything because of all this fog, though...<br>
What even are these waters? This shouldn't be that far off from my regular patrol route...<br>
And yet, I don't remember seeing any island like this before.<br>
What if this is a Siren trap, and this is a Mirror Sea?!<br>
...Huh? Is that a person? Oh no! They're passed out on the ground! I think they got caught in the impact!<br>
Ma'am? Are you okay?!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Asuka：</span><br>
Uuughh...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Akatsuki：</span><br>
Oh! You're alive! Listen to the ninja's voice! Are you in any kind of pain?<br>
I should probably radio the port and get some repair ships to help... But if this is a Mirror Sea, the lines are down!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Asuka：</span><br>
*gasp*! Urgh... Where am I?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Akatsuki：</span><br>
Phew! Looks like you're okay! As for where you are, uhh...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Asuka：</span><br>
Hey! Homura! Fubuki! Are you two okay? Are you still alive? Noooo! They're dead!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Akatsuki：</span><br>
I... don't think so...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Homura：</span><br>
You need to take a chill pill, Asuka! You really think we'd bite the dust just like that?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Fubuki：</span><br>
My apologies for all this ruckus. We didn't scare you, I hope?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Akatsuki：</span><br>
Oh, no, I'm fine. May I ask who you people are?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Asuka：</span><br>
We're all shino– Sorry, I meant to say, "normal high schoolers."<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Akatsuki：</span><br>
High schoolers? Yes, I suppose you look the part.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Fubuki：</span><br>
Asuka, I do not believe this land shares our laws... An instinctual feeling tells me so.<br>
That being the case, we should come forth with our identities and ask for cooperation.<br>
Besides, this young lady's attire suggests that she plays the same role as us.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Asuka：</span><br>
Huh? You mean she's a shinobi?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Akatsuki：</span><br>
Did someone just say "shinobi"?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Asuka：</span><br>
Oh, yeah, I did! We're shinobis, and we support the world from the shadows, fighting bad guys day and night. Do you do that, too?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Akatsuki：</span><br>
Well, I, uh... Y-yes. I follow the path of the ninja...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Asuka：</span><br>
Wow, you really are a fellow shinobi! I'm glad we're in good company! I thought we'd be all alone in this scary new place.<br>
My name's Asuka, by the way! I'm a second-year student at Hanzō Academy.<br>
The tomboy over here is Homura, and this pretty lady is Fubuki. Now tell us about who you are.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Akatsuki：</span><br>
Ah, right... Greetings. I am Akatsuki, from the Sakura Empire.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Homura：</span><br>
Sakura Empire Academy? Doesn't ring any bells... It's top secret, isn't it? Makes sense. That's how shinobis roll.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Akatsuki：</span><br>
Umm, well... That's not exactly correct...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Asuka：</span><br>
And what ninjutsu do you specialize in? Oh! Wait! Let me guess...<br>
Hmmm. Judging by your gear and the fact we're in the middle of the ocean... I'll bet you sneak around in the water! Do you work with the navy?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Akatsuki：</span><br>
Err, no, I'm in a Destroyer Division, specifically the–<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Asuka：</span><br>
Destruction ninjutsu?! Whoooa! That sounds awesome! And really powerful!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Akatsuki：</span><br>
No, that means I fight primarily using torpedoes...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Homura：</span><br>
Torpedoes? As in, electric rays? So you've studied beastmastery. This sea-fighting academy of yours is impressive. I could use a tip or two...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Akatsuki：</span><br>
Umm, I... It's...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Fubuki：</span><br>
You're barraging her with too many questions to keep up.<br>
While I'm certain we all have many more questions, for now, let us look for a safe place to relax.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Observer：</span><br>
Heheh. Found you.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Akatsuki：</span><br>
What?<br>
<br>
That very moment...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Asuka：</span><br>
I can't see a thing! What's happening?!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Akatsuki：</span><br>
Huh? Where did Fubuki go?<br>
What just happened?<br>

<br>
Mirror Sea - Outset Island<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Asuka：</span><br>
I've told you already! Somebody kidnapped Fubuki!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Homura：</span><br>
Yeah, I know! What I'm asking is who that "somebody" is!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Asuka：</span><br>
"Somebody" means "somebody," okay? You know perfectly well what I'm talking about!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Homura：</span><br>
No, I DON'T know what you're talking about! I'm not some all-knowing god!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Akatsuki：</span><br>
L-let's all calm down and discuss what we know...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Asuka：</span><br>
It's simple. There's either an evil ninja or a yōma who's after us! I'm 100% sure of it!<br>
Which brings us back to what I was saying – we need to go looking for Fubuki right now!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Homura：</span><br>
No! What we need to do is figure out what's going on and gather more information before anything else!<br>
You need to work on this damn habit of yours of rushing in blindly!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Asuka：</span><br>
For all we know, she could be being tortured while you're standing here, finding faults with me! We need to get a move on!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Akatsuki：</span><br>
Ladies! Arguing is to nobody's benefit! Take a deep breath and...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Asuka：</span><br>
We're doing it my way!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Homura：</span><br>
We're doing it MY way!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Akatsuki：</span><br>
They won't listen to me... If only I were a full-fledged shinobi, maybe they would... *sob*...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ikaruga：</span><br>
Enough!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Asuka：</span><br>
Ikaruga?!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ikaruga：</span><br>
Look what you did. You made the little girl cry. We are supposed to be role models for those like her.<br>
Instead, you neglect her to quibble with each other. You should be ashamed.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Homura：</span><br>
Hey, hang on, that's not what we were doing...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Asuka：</span><br>
It's not like we were ignoring her, we were just...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ikaruga：</span><br>
No. I will not hear any excuses. We are responsible adults, and as such...<br>

<br>
Mirror Sea - Outset Island<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ikaruga：</span><br>
So that's what happened... Forgive me. I jumped to conclusions.<br>
And you, I'm sorry for frightening you. To reintroduce myself, I am Ikaruga. Like Asuka, I am a student at Hanzō Academy.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Asuka：</span><br>
Imagine my surprise to see you in this world, too!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ikaruga：</span><br>
Indeed. The next thing I knew, here I was. Now, let us get a hold of the situation and survey our surroundings.<br>
I saw a burst of light from this direction and came over in a hurry. What was that?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Asuka：</span><br>
W-well, you see...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ikaruga：</span><br>
Oh. Someone kidnapped Fubuki...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Asuka：</span><br>
Yeah, and we need to start looking for her now!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ikaruga：</span><br>
The question is, where? We don't even know where WE are at the moment.<br>
Furthermore, we're surrounded by water in all directions. How are we supposed to cross it without a boat or an airplane?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Asuka：</span><br>
Good point... Hey, Akatsuki, can your ninjutsu get us out of this pickle somehow?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Akatsuki：</span><br>
What? My ninjutsu? Well... Getting around is one thing, but fighting or pursuing someone without a rigging is borderline impossible.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ikaruga：</span><br>
"Rigging"? Does that refer to the equipment you're wearing? Because if so...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Akatsuki：</span><br>
Um, yes, those are riggings. There is one each, so they must be for you...<br>
But, to be frank, this seems extremely fishy to me.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Homura：</span><br>
Fishy? You think it's a trap?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Akatsuki：</span><br>
Not exactly. I mean that this has happened before.<br>
The last time people from another world came here, they also obtained riggings at some point and brought them into battle.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Homura：</span><br>
You're saying there won't be any problems with us doing the same thing? Then the answer's pretty clear to me.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Asuka：</span><br>
So, basically, we can use these things to traverse the sea and go rescue Fubuki! Everything works out!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Akatsuki：</span><br>
Indeed. You can sail out by yourselves rather than waiting for rescue.<br>
Speaking of which... As embarrassing as it is, I've been unable to reach the port for a while now.<br>
If they have dispatched a search party, it'll be easier to locate your lost friend with more eyes on the sea.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ikaruga：</span><br>
This situation should be resolved very quickly if we can group up with the search party, then.<br>
Phew. Then now is the time to act. Make hay while the sun shines, as they say.<br>
Akatsuki, would you mind showing us how to equip these riggings?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Akatsuki：</span><br>
Oh, sure!<br>

<br>
Somewhere, on a small island...<br>
A group of girls were under attack by a fleet of stray Sirens.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Yumi：</span><br>
Murasaki! Multiple hostiles near you!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Murasaki：</span><br>
G-go away... Stop it... It hurts...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Yūyaki：</span><br>
Ugh, unrelenting little bastards! One hit is all it takes to knock you out anyway, so stop dodging, god dammit!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Yumi：</span><br>
These foes aren't human... Perhaps they're puppets? No, not quite...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Yūyaki：</span><br>
Humans, puppets, doesn't frickin' matter when it's taking all I've got to hold 'em back. We're gonna get bent at this rate...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Yumi：</span><br>
And with no hope of rescue, I fear...<br>
<br>
KABOOOM!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Reno：</span><br>
New type of Siren fleet sighted! Let's blow them up before they catch on to us!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Bremerton：</span><br>
We're here, baby! Let's roll!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Reno：</span><br>
Alright, I think that's the last of them. You there, are you okay? You don't have riggings, so I'm assuming you're not shipgirls.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Yumi：</span><br>
No. I am Yumi, a student of the Gessen Girls' Academy.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Lützow：</span><br>
Gessen? Never heard of that one. What's that you've got there? Looks like the kinds of weapons ninja use in anime.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Elbing：</span><br>
Those Enforcer Sirens had a similar vibe to them... What happened here? Was this a movie shoot or something?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Yūyaki：</span><br>
You call those evil ninjas "Sirens"? They behaved so much like puppets on strings...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Reno：</span><br>
Puppets, that curious equipment of yours, and the need to specify EVIL ninjas... Hmm...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Yumi：</span><br>
Err, before you ask...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Reno：</span><br>
No, no, I get it! Your existence is top-secret, right? That's so ninja-like! And so mysterious.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Yumi：</span><br>
What I was going to say was... Yes, we are shinobis. However...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Lützow：</span><br>
Whoa. So shinobis ARE real. I thought they only existed in comic books.<br>
So, like, can you do cool ninja stuff? Like transform or create clones of yourselves?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Yūyaki：</span><br>
Are you talking about embodying avatars and illusions of encirclement?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Reno：</span><br>
You must have dog companions who follow your orders, right?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Yūyaki：</span><br>
Some of us do keep doggies as pets, yes...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Lützow：</span><br>
What about haiku? Do you make those? Like, those death poems, and stuff?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Yumi：</span><br>
We practice no such custom. There are those who compose tanka as a hobby, but that is a different subject.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Reno：</span><br>
Oh yeah! Now that's a real-life shinobi! Next-level Far East stuff!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Elbing：</span><br>
Is this really the time for culture exchange?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Murasaki：</span><br>
It feels like... we've become friends just like that...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Reno：</span><br>
What matters is, I've officially met a super-ninja, and that's awesome! Now our victory's basically guaranteed!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Bremerton：</span><br>
Okay, we've heard enough! Stop nerdgasming already! Sorry 'bout this goofball confusing you girls.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Yumi：</span><br>
Don't be. We would be confused no matter the conversation's contents in this case.<br>
Moreover, we're already confused after being brought to this place without any prior warning...<br>
You came to our aid when we needed it, and for that, thank you so much.<br>

<br>
Mirror Sea - Somewhere else<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Asuka：</span><br>
...And there you have it. We study ninjutsu at school while fighting day and night to protect the peace!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Akatsuki：</span><br>
Amazing! A shinobi needs to go through much training to carry out her duty, after all!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Asuka：</span><br>
All that work makes it all the more satisfying when you complete a tough mission, though.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Akatsuki：</span><br>
An attitude befitting a cool shinobi such as you! Speaking of which, what missions have you accomplished before?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Asuka：</span><br>
Good question. For a start, there's the time when I met Homura...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ikaruga：</span><br>
Seems those two have already become best friends. They've all but formed a sisterly bond.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Homura：</span><br>
I mean, what's wrong with that? Someone's gotta look after that big baby.<br>
On another topic, we've been on the move for a long-ass while now and haven't seen any land, never mind any friendlies.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ikaruga：</span><br>
No, but this is the direction the light that took Fubuki came from. All we can do is keep moving forward.<br>
The rescue party Akatsuki spoke of is surely heading there, too.<br>
Finally, other students – assuming there are more – should be heading to where the light came from if they saw it as well.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Homura：</span><br>
I was talking to 'em right before we got sent here. There's a high chance Yumi's somewhere around here.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ikaruga：</span><br>
Ah. Then we'd better find her soon...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Akatsuki：</span><br>
Do you know any simple ninjutsu you could demonstrate to me? Pretty please!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Asuka：</span><br>
Sure, if basic capture ninjutsu will do. Give me your hand for a sec. Okay, now, let's take this rope aaand...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Akatsuki：</span><br>
Whoa! I can't move one inch, let alone untie myself!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Asuka：</span><br>
And now if I do this...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Akatsuki：</span><br>
Ow! Oww! Owwwww!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Kashino：</span><br>
I hope Akatsuki is okay. She has been unreachable for some time now since she went on her patrol...<br>
Wait... Isn't that her over there? And she's been tied up...<br>
Someone has to save her... But if it comes to a fight, I doubt I can fend the attackers off by myself...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Akatsuki：</span><br>
Ow! Oww! Owwwww!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Kashino：</span><br>
Oh no! They're hurting her! ...Y-you there! Let go of Akatsuki right now!<br>

KABOOOM!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ikaruga：</span><br>
We're under attack! Spread out, quickly!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Akatsuki：</span><br>
Blast it! The Sirens are out here, too! We're caught in a pincer attack!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Asuka：</span><br>
Akatsuki, take command! The rest of us don't know how to deal with Sirens! You know how we shinobis fight, don't you?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Akatsuki：</span><br>
What? Uh, I mean... Okay, I'll try...<br>
...Hang on! That's Kashino! Friendly, friendly! The lady is on our side! Hail, Kashino!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Kashino：</span><br>
Huh? She's coming this way and waving at me... I fear they're using her as a human shield.<br>
And just on the horizon... Oh, dear! They have reinforcements coming!<br>
<br>
KABOOOM!<br>

Kashinooo! Friendly fire! These girls are friendlies! Please stop shooting them! Dang it... She can't hear me!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Homura：</span><br>
No kidding – you can't hear a damn thing over all this cannon fire!<br>
She's not even the biggest pest – these monsters are! Do something, Akatsuki! Use your shinobi arts to get us out of this!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Akatsuki：</span><br>
But I can't just... *sob*... Somebody, save us...<br>
<br>
KABOOOM!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ikaruga：</span><br>
An attack... from above?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Implacable：</span><br>
Fighter squadrons, bomber squadrons, repel the Sirens!<br>
<br>
KABOOOM!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Implacable：</span><br>
So you saw a falling star during your compulsory patrol, and went to check it out... Akatsuki, please. Acting on your own accord goes against protocol.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Akatsuki：</span><br>
I am indebted to you, Implacable...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Implacable：</span><br>
And Kashino, you must not jump to conclusions. I hope you understand now why rash decisions only complicate things.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Kashino：</span><br>
Yes. I'm sorry...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Implacable：</span><br>
Good. Now, as for you ladies... Judging by your appearances, I presume you're from somewhere else.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Asuka：</span><br>
And that's the long and short of it.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Implacable：</span><br>
Interesting... This is exactly like cases perpetrated by Sirens in the past.<br>
I would call for Akashi, but it seems we're in a newly formed Mirror Sea, so that's not an option.<br>
I've contacted the port, but they won't be able to do much until we've dealt with the Sirens behind this.<br>
So, let me ask you this, visitors from foreign lands...<br>
Our goal is the same – to solve this problem at its core – so why don't we work on it together?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ikaruga：</span><br>
What do you mean by, "core"?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Implacable：</span><br>
The Sirens must have some motive for kidnapping your friend, no?<br>
That being the case, rescuing her is the most surefire way to nip whatever scheme they have in the bud.<br>
We can worry about what comes next after that.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Asuka：</span><br>
Sooo... Basically, saving Fubuki is our number one priority? If so, there's no doubt in my mind!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Implacable：</span><br>
Then we have a plan. Let's move out at once. Time is short.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ikaruga：</span><br>
...Why, exactly, are you so willing to cooperate?<br>
Things will go more smoothly on our end once we get in touch with Fubuki, sure...<br>
But you know this world and how it runs. You could easily be trying to deceive us.<br>
And we, completely in the dark about your world, are a burden, if anything... Frankly, I think we'll only be a hindrance to you.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Implacable：</span><br>
To answer your question – it's because it's a nun's duty to extend her hand to people in need♪<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Homura：</span><br>
You dress like that and call yourself a nun? You gotta be kidding me...<br>

<br>
Mirror Sea - Desolate island<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Reno：</span><br>
...That's how a Mirror Sea is artificially created! And sometimes, people from other worlds appear in them.<br>
Oftentimes, they have unique powers or abilities, and that's why the Sirens are so interested in them.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Bremerton：</span><br>
Yeah. I've seen riggings do amazing stuff, like combine with others or transform. Don't get many of those outside Iron Blood.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Murasaki：</span><br>
...Combine and transform?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Reno：</span><br>
Hahah, yeah... Anyway, just think of this world as a place where magical stuff happens.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Yumi：</span><br>
"Magical" really is the word. We're speaking to ladies who dart across the sea, donning machinery the likes of which I've never seen before.<br>
I could doubt you until the cows come home, but that's meaningless. Instead, I will trust you.<br>
Moreover, we know nothing about this world, and you are our only hope of resolving this situation and getting us back home.<br>
I humbly beseech you – please, help us and our friend who we've yet to find.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Bremerton：</span><br>
Wait, there's more of you?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Yumi：</span><br>
Yes. Someone else was transported to this world alongside us. I can sense her...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Yūyaki：</span><br>
Her? Oh boy, let me guess...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Yumi：</span><br>
Indeed – it's Fubuki. If she is here, then Asuka and others must surely have come as well.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Murasaki：</span><br>
I think you're right... I can't imagine Asuka wouldn't be here... Not when this has happened.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Reno：</span><br>
So you have, like, a person sensor? A sixth sense? Or do you have superhuman powers?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Bremerton：</span><br>
Whatever it is, I think we can assume there are others here.<br>
Believe it or not, we lost contact with someone in this place, too... It's why we're here. To look for her.<br>
So, you'll be searching for your missing friends and a way to get home, while we'll be searching for our lost comrade.<br>
Sounds like killing three birds with one stone to me!<br>
Although, we're not the only ones searchin', so someone else might find 'em and bring 'em to us.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Yumi：</span><br>
Whatever the case... we are in your hands.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Lützow：</span><br>
Hey, girls! Come here for a sec!<br>
Can't say I'm surprised. This is how they do it in most cases.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Elbing：</span><br>
Business as usual with the Sirens, I suppose...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Yūyaki：</span><br>
What am I looking at here?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Lützow：</span><br>
Riggings. I'm about 90% sure they're for you. Whenever peeps get transported here, it's not long before they get outfitted with riggings.<br>
How do I put it? I guess you could say the Sirens are generous. Either that, or this is another ploy of theirs.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Murasaki：</span><br>
Will be able to... traverse the sea with these? This feels a bit like... getting special gear in a video game...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Lützow：</span><br>
For the record, regular people can't equip riggings. You're special 'cause you're from another world or whatever, and the Sirens made these just for you.<br>
You'll be able to move on water, of course, but you'll be able to join us in battles, too. Riggings pack hefty firepower and sturdy defenses.<br>
Granted, you'll need to familiarize yourselves with 'em. Should be a cakewalk for ninjas like you girls, though.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Yumi：</span><br>
I-I'll give my best shot.<br>

<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Lützow：</span><br>
Wow, shinobis learn fast! You've already figured out the basics of your riggings, and now it's time to set off. So, Reno, where are we going?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Reno：</span><br>
Kashino's team should be in the area by now, so if we're gonna regroup with anyone, it should be them.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Yūyaki：</span><br>
Yumi, can you sense where Fubuki is?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Yumi：</span><br>
I felt her presence in that direction earlier. Now, it's... well...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Murasaki：</span><br>
Umm... Can we talk about the elephant in the room? You do see that very suspicious place over there, don't you?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Yumi：</span><br>
I do. It's where Fubuki's presence is coming from.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Bremerton：</span><br>
I think we're all subconsciously looking the other way, 'cause that place is so suspicious it hurts. Or something like that.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Lützow：</span><br>
I just hope there's a bed with a cushy pillow. *yaaawn*... Reno, lead the way, will you?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Reno：</span><br>
What, are you gonna catch some Z's en route? You're one impressive napaholic... Girls, follow me!<br>

<br>
Mirror Sea - Somewhere else<br>
There, in a place no one knows, the captive princess stood all by herself.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Fubuki：</span><br>
......<br>
...How long has it been since then?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Observer ：</span><br>
Would you like to know?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Fubuki：</span><br>
*gasp*! How long have you been here?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Observer ：</span><br>
Three seconds or so. I'm giving you the cold shoulder here, mind you.<br>
I only thought you, our esteemed guest, may have wanted some quiet time to yourself.<br>
I've been consciously leaving you alone as a courtesy. Although, you probably don't believe me when I say that.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Fubuki：</span><br>
Do you... WANT me to believe you?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Observer ：</span><br>
Hmm... If I'm to be frank, I don't care either way if you believe me or not.<br>
What I DO care about is seeing how your attitude changes depending on whether you do or don't. It's interesting.<br>
If you'd like, shall we have a tea party? It'll be an opportunity for you to speak with me at length.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Fubuki：</span><br>
I'll pass, thank you. The idea of letting you get even a crumb of information out of me makes my skin crawl.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Observer ：</span><br>
How harsh. At the same time, you're trying to get a reaction out of me to gauge information from it.<br>
If I had to describe your attempt with one word, it would be "adorable."<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Fubuki：</span><br>
......<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Observer ：</span><br>
Heheh. Don't scowl like that... I have so much to tell you. Don't you want to know how your friends are doing?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Fubuki：</span><br>
Ugh...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Observer ：</span><br>
Heheheheh! I adore it when your weakness peeks through the cracks like this.<br>
So desperately trying to keep your emotions in the bottle. That's also adorable.<br>
Unfortunately, all I have to share is that your friends are doing all they can to get the situation under control.<br>
Oh, but they did make some trusty allies, so there's that.<br>
I'm sure they'll overcome all the challenges and come and rescue you.<br>
It's a shame the ultimate challenge they have to face is me. How cruel the world can be.<br>
In my case, I'll be happy as long as they kick and scream nicely...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Fubuki：</span><br>
That's what makes you happy?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Observer ：</span><br>
Oops, I might have let something slip there. Be nice and forget you heard that.<br>
What matters is this – everyone is safe and sound. You have nothing to worry about for now.<br>
Also, I'm lucky someone from your world held the key to the gateway. It saved me a lot of time and effort.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Fubuki：</span><br>
What? Key? Gateway? Oh... You exploited my powers to cross world boundaries. That's what you're saying, isn't it?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Observer ：</span><br>
Ah, you're sharper than you let on. I need to watch my mouth in the future. Heheh...<br>
Look at that. It seems things have changed whilst you and I have been chatting.<br>
It's looking like your friends will end up right where I want them, even without any advice on your part.<br>
So, stay here and take it easy for a while.<br>
If you need anything, don't be afraid to let me know. I'll get it for you as soon as possible.<br>
I do expect you to lend an ear to my chitchat in return, however.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Fubuki：</span><br>
......<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Observer ：</span><br>
Alright, see you later.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Fubuki：</span><br>
......<br>
My gut feeling was right. My powers were the catalyst behind this incident...<br>
I need to escape this place immediately and link up with the girls. My conscience won't let me rest until I apologize.<br>
The problem is, all my ninjutsu seems to have no effect here. I need to think of another way...<br>
No, it's not that it's ineffective, per se – it feels more like my energy is being sapped. Brute-forcing it isn't going to work.<br>
If my powers warrant being actively suppressed, that must mean they are the trump card to put a stop to all this.<br>
If that's the case, I need to wait for the right time. The time to strike. That's when I'll act swiftly...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Observer ：</span><br>
Heheh. She's taken the bait.<br>
With people like her, you just need to drip-feed a little information and they'll fill in the gaps in your plan. Easily exploitable, in that way.<br>
Oh, I look forward to seeing what experiments can be done using her powers.<br>

Mirror Sea - Outside the castle gates<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Implacable：</span><br>
I'm detecting wakes at two o'clock. Looks like Iron Blood, Eagle Union... and some girls with riggings who the database doesn't recognise.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Kashino：</span><br>
Maybe it's Reno's team?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Implacable：</span><br>
Too many to be them. I'll grant you, it's possible they've grouped up with some of Asuka's friends.<br>
Occam's razor argues that it's a Siren fleet containing Pawns, however.<br>
Regardless, let's advance cautiously. Whatever happens, we can respond accordingly.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ikaruga：</span><br>
"Pawns"? What are those?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Kashino：</span><br>
Simply put, they're clones of us shipgirls that the Sirens made.<br>
The Sirens have already caught sight of you and your friends, so I wouldn't be shocked to see Pawns of them as well.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Asuka：</span><br>
What?! I, for one, would be VERY shocked!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Homura：</span><br>
God's sake, Asuka. Do you always get shocked by transformation ninjutsu, too? Actually, you probably do.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Elbing：</span><br>
Contact with target fleet imminent. Be careful.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Bremerton：</span><br>
Remember what we just told you, aight? Doesn't matter if they look exactly like your friends – you can't be sure if they're the real deal or not!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Asuka：</span><br>
Oh! Hey, Yumi!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Yumi：</span><br>
Asuka! I mean... That IS you, right?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Asuka：</span><br>
Well, yeah. Asuka, second-year student at Hanzō Academy. Something the matter?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Yumi：</span><br>
No, never mind. You got transported here just as I did, I assume?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Asuka：</span><br>
To this world? Yup, I did. Ikaruga and Homura, too! And Fubuki, but she's... well...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Yumi：</span><br>
Yes... I sensed as much. She was there with you for at least a while, wasn't she?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Asuka：</span><br>
She was, but then there was this blinding light, and all of a sudden she was gone.<br>
A ball of light appeared in her place, and it took off like a rocket.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Yumi：</span><br>
So that's what happened... The ball of light then traveled towards the castle over there, yes?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Asuka：</span><br>
Yup! I'm impressed but not surprised you've figured it out already!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Yumi：</span><br>
Only because I can sense her presence.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Elbing：</span><br>
Doesn't sound like Asuka is the least bit wary.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Murasaki：</span><br>
That's very on-brand for her...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Reno：</span><br>
At least we're all in one place now! I'm glad we found not just Akatsuki, but all the rest of you as well.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Akatsuki：</span><br>
You shouldn't have needed to find me at all... I am ashamed.<br>
{{折叠面板|内容结束}}

{{折叠面板|标题=The Heart of the Story|选项=12|主框=1|样式=primary|展开=是}}
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Akatsuki：</span><br>
...So, in short, I went to inspect the meteor's impact site, and that's when I found those three lying on the ground.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Bremerton：</span><br>
Well, we didn't hear any report 'bout a falling star... You musta already entered the Mirror Sea when that happened.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Elbing：</span><br>
You were stargazing and forgot about your regular report, didn't you?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Akatsuki：</span><br>
Err... It pains me to admit, but yes.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Implacable：</span><br>
On the bright side, we sprung into action quicker as a result. All's well that ends well.<br>
Sounds like the Sirens created this Mirror Sea expressly to transport you here. The question is – why YOU, specifically?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Asuka：</span><br>
I don't have the faintest idea. It's not like we have magic powers or anything like that...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Yumi：</span><br>
Not us, no, but perhaps someone we know. Remember how it went with the yōma?<br>
Looking at it that way, magic proficiency may have something to do with Fubuki's kidnapping. They must have had a reason to take her.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Bremerton：</span><br>
Fubuki? Whozzat?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Yumi：</span><br>
Let me explain...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Implacable：</span><br>
The power to create doors between worlds... Yes, that would be a very attractive ability to the Sirens.<br>
The Sirens would without a doubt want to get their hands on her if she really does have that power.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Lützow：</span><br>
So, basically, if we rescue this Fubuki girl, this whole thing'll more or less be done and dusted, yeah?<br>
The Sirens are basically shouting, "Our plan revolves around her!"<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Asuka：</span><br>
Then we know what to do! Before anything else, we've gotta rescue Fubuki! And to do that...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Yumi：</span><br>
We'll surmount this wall and get inside the castle!<br>
I just... know it. I can sense that she's inside the castle.<br>

<br>
Mirror Sea - Stormy Akashi Castle Outer Area<br>
RUMBLE... RUMBLE...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Homura：</span><br>
That was simple... Thought it'd be a pain in the ass to get the gates open.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ikaruga：</span><br>
Not just simple, they opened on their own! What kind of castle is THIS easily breached?<br>
When I think of a castle's gates, I picture a sturdy barrier able to hold back an army...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Bremerton：</span><br>
You can't think like that. The Sirens don't operate on common sense.<br>
They're probably going for form over function here or somethin' to that tune.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Reno：</span><br>
I say we should just be happy we didn't need to waste any energy getting inside.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Asuka：</span><br>
Well, onwards and upwards! Follow me!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Yumi：</span><br>
Hold your horses, Asuka! Let's exercise at least a little caution...<br>
<br>
FWOOSH!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Yumi：</span><br>
Oh! This feeling again... Fubuki?!<br>
<br>
KABOOOM!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Akatsuki：</span><br>
Huh? Was that an explosion?! Where did it come from? ...Hey! There's smoke rising from the keep!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Reno：</span><br>
Somebody's already attacking? And it's not any of us? That can't be right...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Yumi：</span><br>
Either something happened to Fubuki, or she took matters into her own hands.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Asuka：</span><br>
One thing I know about her is that she's no pushover! She's resisting the Sirens! We've got to hurry and help her!<br>
Hang in there, Fubuki! We're coming for you!<br>
<br>
BZZT! BZZT!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Kashino：</span><br>
What's this? It looks like there are three doors. There is also a sign of some kind.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Akatsuki：</span><br>
Let's see here...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Sign：</span><br>
"Past these doors, complete all trials three. Succeed and the path will open for thee."<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Murasaki：</span><br>
Looks like... we have a quest on our hands.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Reno：</span><br>
Uh, yeah. Odd time for it, but I assume we don't have a choice...<br>

<br>
Mirror Sea - The Trial Doors<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Lützow：</span><br>
The sign says "trials," so I bet there'll be tons of trap doors and pressure plates and stuff past this point.<br>
What do you all think? Should we just pick a door and bullrush it?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ikaruga：</span><br>
It said to, "Complete all trials three." Don't we need to reach the end or destroy what's past each door?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Homura：</span><br>
Guess all of us charging in isn't gonna work... Dammit, why's it always gotta be so complicated?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Reno：</span><br>
Coming up with busy work is the Sirens' favorite pastime. I wish they'd stop wasting all our time.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Bremerton：</span><br>
There's no rhyme or reason to what they do... 'Least, I can't find any.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Akatsuki：</span><br>
No matter! We need not understand to be victorious, only achieve the end goal!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Yumi：</span><br>
Considering the circumstances, we don't have the time to go through each door as one big group.<br>
Though it's not ideal, I believe we should split up and strive to complete all three trials simultaneously.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Implacable：</span><br>
Agreed. This may be a race against the clock for all we know, meaning we have precious little time to waste.<br>
Splitting into three groups and doing all the challenges at once seems to be the only choice.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ikaruga：</span><br>
Before we go, there's one thing I'd like to mention...<br>
Judging by the castle's design, I expect what we'll find beyond these doors are traps and the so-called Pawns made in our image.<br>
If that is all, we shinobis can deal with those. The Sirens themselves are a different subject, however.<br>
We know next to nothing about their habits, techniques, and tactics, whilst you are much more familiar with them.<br>
So, wouldn't it be best to have you accompany each of our teams? By splitting the team members evenly, I mean.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Bremerton：</span><br>
Hey, yeah! Good idea!<br>

<br>
Mirror Sea - The First Door<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ikaruga：</span><br>
We have decided that the team for this door will consist of me, Homura, Akatsuki, and Reno.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Everyone：</span><br>
CLAP CLAP CLAP!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ikaruga：</span><br>
That being said, there is no foretelling how practical our shinobi skills will be if it comes to a battle with the Sirens.<br>
Moreover, our rigging proficiency is lacking as we've only grasped the basics of handling them.<br>
Which is to say, we will likely be wholly reliant on Akatsuki and Reno in the event of combat.<br>
Kindly bear with us. I will try my best to not weigh you down.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Akatsuki：</span><br>
Please, there is no need to be so humble!<br>
You stand shoulder to shoulder with us, as shown by the various ninjutsu, advanced skills, and combat proficiency you've demonstrated thus far.<br>
If battles are ahead, let us both take advantage of our respective strengths!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ikaruga：</span><br>
Thank you for your kind words. I will give it my all in battle.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Homura：</span><br>
I got you! You've got first-row seats for the showcase of the skills we in the Homura's Crimson Squad pride ourselves on!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Akatsuki：</span><br>
(I hope they'll demonstrate as many of their skills as possible so I may copy them.)<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ikaruga：</span><br>
Huh? What did you say?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Akatsuki：</span><br>
Oh! Nothing! I didn't say anything!<br>
<br>
Sometime later...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Reno：</span><br>
...Are you saying you take advantage of natural elements like fire and water in those cases?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Homura：</span><br>
Yeah. Each of us has our own specialization which our ninjutsu's focused on. I use fire, Yumi uses ice, and so on.<br>
It's pretty adaptable to the situation. You can do stuff like wrap it around your weapon, or launch it with a snap of your finger.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Reno：</span><br>
Damn. We shipgirls can also change our method of attack by swapping ammo types, but that's entirely different.<br>
I'm kinda jealous! I wish I had that level of flexibility with my attacks!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Homura：</span><br>
Power-wise, your guns pack the bigger punch, though.<br>
Then there's the rest of the rigging... I'd kill for a shinobi gadget that let me move like the wind over the sea.<br>
All the shinobi applications it could have... Bad time to daydream, I know, but it's exciting to think about.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Reno：</span><br>
You should teach me your shinobi techniques! Please!<br>
I wanna learn how to vanish into a cloud of smoke and avoid an attack, or teleport behind an enemy like fwoosh... Think of the possibilities!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Akatsuki：</span><br>
Hey! That's not fair! I want... I want to be her disciple as well!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ikaruga：</span><br>
It could be fun to start a ninjutsu class. After this is all done, that is.<br>
For now, we should focus on rescuing Fubuki!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Akatsuki：</span><br>
Yes, of course! I shall see that it's done!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Homura：</span><br>
Attagirl! Let's see who of us can knock out the most foes!<br>

<br>
Mirror Sea - The Second Door<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Bremerton：</span><br>
Murasaki, Yūyaki, Elbing, Lützow, and I make up the team for this door. Everyone cool with that?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Elbing：</span><br>
Cool as a cucumber... Am I free to complain, though?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Bremerton：</span><br>
You are, but it's not gonna change anything. Only response you'll really get is, "Just put up with it for a while."<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Murasaki：</span><br>
*whimper*... I wanna go home... I mean, no objections here.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Yūyaki：</span><br>
Won't hear me complain as long as I get to grind some foes to dust.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Bremerton：</span><br>
Uh... Yeah, you can bet on it. There'll be so much dust-grinding that you'll get sick of it.<br>
......<br>
Man, I'm still not used to her switching personalities at the tip of a hat.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Murasaki：</span><br>
Think of it as... two people sharing the same body.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Lützow：</span><br>
It shocked me the first time I saw it for myself, but now that I know why she's like that, I get it.<br>
You can think of it like being around a pair of twins with opposite personalities.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Elbing：</span><br>
(It's not really anything like that, but... Perhaps Emden would understand...?)<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Yūyaki：</span><br>
Enough yackety-yak, we've got skulls to crack! I wanna finish this before she changes her damn mind!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Bremerton：</span><br>
Oh, okay. Let's get in there, girls!<br>
<br>
Sometime later...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Elbing：</span><br>
In truth, I'd rather not be in this place... Nothing good ever happens when I go anywhere.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Murasaki：</span><br>
Same. I'd rather be alone in my room all I can... Forcing myself to move around is inefficient.<br>
That is why I should be allowed to always study and train in the comfort of the indoors...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Elbing：</span><br>
Plus, there's a good chance we'd lose if I fought in the battle anyway... Can I go home and wait for the rest of you?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Yūyaki：</span><br>
Hey, losers! Stop daydreaming during combat! At least face reality this one goddamn time!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Elbing：</span><br>
...Do you know any ninjutsu that conceals you?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Murasaki：</span><br>
You mean... camouflage? Like the technique known as leaf hiding, or another called quail hiding?<br>
Subterfuge is the mission of a shinobi, so we have countless ways of hiding ourselves.<br>
Water-related concealment options are... blending in among aquatic foliage and a technique called fox hiding, among others... It's when you hide underwater with only your head poking out.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Elbing：</span><br>
Under the water? That reminds me, submarine shipgirls say you should stay still to avoid making any noise.<br>
For us surface shipgirls, though... diving underwater isn't exactly in our toolkit.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Murasaki：</span><br>
That's unfortunate...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Bremerton：</span><br>
It's astonishing how brazenly you girls talk about getting out of doing any work...<br>

<br>
Mirror Sea - The Third Door<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Asuka：</span><br>
So there's me, Yumi, Implacable, and Kashino... Alright, I'll try my hardest not to drag you down!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Implacable：</span><br>
Oh, don't say that. If there's any "dragging" you do, it's dragging the team forwards. You have a knack for that.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Yumi：</span><br>
Indeed she does. She has a certain power that drives people onwards.<br>
A power that compels her to always keep fighting. That is why we all put our trust in her.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Kashino：</span><br>
Wow... It sounds like we have nothing to worry about! Lead us forward, Asuka!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Asuka：</span><br>
Whoa, hang on! What's this about "driving people onwards"?<br>
I'm no leader! Now that you've hyped me up... I'm gonna have to give it my best shot.<br>
Hey... Will you shipgirls put your trust in me?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Implacable：</span><br>
Of course. Making people trust you is one of your talents. It's proof of your ability and excellence.<br>
Learning to accept people's positive feelings and turning them into your strength is important, Asuka.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Yumi：</span><br>
Yes. We all know that you're an exceedingly strong person.<br>
Not just physically, but spiritually as well.<br>
I once faced you as a foe. As did Homura, and even Fubuki.<br>
All of us know and respect your strength. Please, for all our sakes, have confidence in yourself!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Asuka：</span><br>
Gosh, you sound like you really mean it... O-okay, I'll try, for real!<br>
With me, everyone! Forwards! We'll save Fubuki no matter what it takes!<br>
<br>
Sometime later...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Asuka：</span><br>
It's weird. We're sailing on the sea, and there's water all around...<br>
So why do I feel like taking a shower? I wouldn't even care if it was a cold shower.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Kashino：</span><br>
Ah, I know exactly how that feels!<br>
I love relaxing in the bath or in hot springs, and whenever I'm out at sea on a mission, my urge to bathe gets even stronger for some reason.<br>
When I'm carrying heavy cargo, I just think to myself, "Gosh, I'd kill to take a mineral bath."<br>
Or I'll have thoughts like, "I heard citrus-scented bath salts are lovely. I should try one next time."<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Asuka：</span><br>
Mood. My favorite thing is getting a can of coffee milk and chugging the whole thing after getting out of the tub!<br>
I wonder – why DOES milk taste so good right after a bath?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Kashino：</span><br>
Right? It's delicious whether it's coffee-flavored or fruit-flavored. Cold, regular milk is great, too!<br>
In fact, I know a very good brand of milk! I'll treat you to some when we get back, so let's go for a dip together!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Asuka：</span><br>
You will? Sweet! I can't wait!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Yumi：</span><br>
(I can understand wanting to share things, but this isn't a proper topic for a battlefield.)<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Implacable：</span><br>
Okay, that's enough chitchat. You can talk about bathing when you're not in the middle of a fight. At least take the situation a little seriously.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Asuka：</span><br>
Oh, right! Sorry!<br>

<br>
Sometime later, within the third door...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Asuka：</span><br>
......<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Implacable：</span><br>
Is something the matter, Asuka?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Asuka：</span><br>
No... It's just that I feel like I'm being watched, even if I can't put my finger on why.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Implacable：</span><br>
My radar isn't picking up anything of note, for what it's worth. What about you, Yumi?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Yumi：</span><br>
I feel it, too, albeit vaguely. Something isn't right. It's like there are eyes on me, or like I'm being watched.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Implacable：</span><br>
That so? And yet, nothing is showing on the radar...<br>
Perhaps it's some extraordinary sense you ninjas have. Or a superpower.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Asuka：</span><br>
While it's nothing on that level, I've learned how to sense the presence of people over the course of my training.<br>
Staying out of sight is a shinobi's main job, so that also plays a role in our heightened awareness.<br>
But compared to our fuzzy instincts, your radar clearly indicating where the enemies are is way more impressive!<br>
The difference between having it and not in a fight is worlds apart!<br>
Although, who knows if it'd work when you're fighting a fellow shinobi...<br>
Once they know you have it, they'll develop countermeasures to hide from it sooner or later.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Implacable：</span><br>
It's the same deal for us. It's an endless back-and-forth of devising new ways to hide from and find each other.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Asuka：</span><br>
Oh, makes sense! Guess it's the same in all worlds – you're always refining your technique every day.<br>
...Following that train of thought, I have an idea why someone would be watching us.<br>
Maybe they want to incorporate our shinobi senses into a new kind of radar?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Implacable：</span><br>
That's certainly a possibility. The Sirens went the extra mile when they summoned you here, after all.<br>
The idea of an organic radar with extrasensory perception sounds frightening, honestly...<br>

<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Asuka：</span><br>
First! ...Or not?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Homura：</span><br>
Finally, after a million years. The hell took you so long? Were you a turtle in a previous life or what?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Asuka：</span><br>
You're here, Homura? Dang it, then I lost! That's so annoying! ...Hey, if I was a turtle, I'd have won! Slow and steady, remember?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ikaruga：</span><br>
I'm glad to see you've made it. Now to wait for Murasaki's team.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Murasaki：</span><br>
Umm... We've been here for a while now...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ikaruga：</span><br>
Oh, forgive me for not noticing you sooner... Yumi, any updates on Fubuki?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Yumi：</span><br>
I can still sense her presence just past this point. Having said that...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Asuka：</span><br>
Yeah... Looking at the rising smoke, anyone can tell something happened in the keep.<br>
Doesn't look like there's any time to waste here! Let's rush inside as soon as everyone's ready!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Akatsuki：</span><br>
Our team is fully prepared! Let us realize the finale!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Asuka：</span><br>
Alright! Here we go!<br>

Hail! ...Egads, it's pitch black in here. This has to be the final room.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Asuka：</span><br>
Wait, Akatsuki! There's someone there!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Tester：</span><br>
Hm? Ah, keen as ever, shinobi. I'm surprised you can see me without night vision goggles. Here, let me give you a treat...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Fubuki：</span><br>
......<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Yumi：</span><br>
Fubuki!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Tester：</span><br>
Stop. Don't wake her. I've finally managed to calm her down.<br>
It was ridiculous. I can't believe Observer's report made no mention of her attacking with all she has if you look at her the wrong way...<br>
Knowing her, I'll bet she intentionally left that out. Still, this is no way to treat the one who has to deal with the fallout.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Homura：</span><br>
Hey, asshole! Hold still so I can cut you in half!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Tester：</span><br>
Seems we have a specimen prone to extreme emotions here.<br>
Settle down. The experiment has only just begun. Also, I have delightful plans for you. I hope you'll like them.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Yumi：</span><br>
What do you mean, "delightful plans"?!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Tester：</span><br>
Ah, you're the girl who linked with this... thing. Heheh. Your biorhythms line up so neatly.<br>
I knew your group would inevitably arrive here if they had you.<br>
Now it's time to show you the fruits of our research. You will not be disappointed by what we've created.<br>

KABOOOM!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Asuka：</span><br>
Oww! That was such a cheap attack!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Homura：</span><br>
Stop whining and fight back! It's not gonna go easy on you just 'cause you called it cheap!<br>
Yūyaki! Can you keep that thing in check?!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Yūyaki：</span><br>
For now, but I can't keep this up forever! Think of something to take it out, dammit!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Bremerton：</span><br>
The hell is this? Its attack pattern's the same, but different stuff happens every time! What're we supposed to do?!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Elbing：</span><br>
It's purposely throwing us off our rhythm so we can't predict its moves. It's... a bit like how a ninja attacks.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Bremerton：</span><br>
She called it "battle ninja armor," yeah? It's got the schmoves of a ninja and the strength of Tester herself!<br>
We've gotta think of something, quick, or we are so boned!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Akatsuki：</span><br>
If it fights like a ninja, I shall hit tit for tat with the new techniques I've learned! High-explosive clone shell, strike my foe!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Reno：</span><br>
Then I'll whip out the new gear I made with the shinobis' help – the infinite caltrop gun! Fire!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Homura：</span><br>
Wow. I taught her the clone shuriken technique, and she's using it in a whole new way... Reno might just be a natural genius.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Asuka：</span><br>
That caltrop launcher could be extremely useful! If you scaled it down a little, maybe we could use them as well!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Bremerton：</span><br>

Well, seems this is it. It held up well, for being so hastily constructed. Moreover, the results of this experiment were fascinating.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Homura：</span><br>
You're all that's left, bastard! Say your last prayers!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Tester：</span><br>
You still have the energy to fight? I'm surprised. I'm afraid this is starting to drag on, though.<br>
While I wouldn't mind playing with you, I've run out of time.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Homura：</span><br>
Hey! Wait! Get your ass back here!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Tester：</span><br>
Now, now, this was fun. We will meet again another time.<br>
<br>
Sometime later, deep in the keep...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Yumi：</span><br>
Fubuki! Are you alright?!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Fubuki：</span><br>
Mmgh...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Implacable：</span><br>
Let me have a look at her. Pupil dilation is fine. Pulse, fine. Breathing, fine.<br>
...Yeah, she's okay, save for a couple of scratches. Just needs a little rest back at the port and she'll be back to normal in no time.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Yumi：</span><br>
Oh, thank goodness...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Bremerton：</span><br>
Let's all get out of here before anything bad happens!<br>
I wouldn't put it past the Sirens to be like, "I'm taking you with me!" and blowing the castle up at the last second!<br>
<br>
RUSTLE...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Murasaki：</span><br>
Huh? Look! Fubuki – she's moving.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Yumi：</span><br>
You're awake, Fubuki. Thank go– Aaahhh!<br>
<br>
KABOOOM!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Yumi：</span><br>
What's happening? Why is she attacking us?!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Implacable：</span><br>
I think she's still in her slumber. Nothing suggests she's being puppeteered, though... She's either acting on instinct, or it's something automatic.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Bremerton：</span><br>
I knew it! The Sirens left us a parting gift!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Reno：</span><br>
They skipped past blowing up the castle and went straight to turning one of our own on us! They've hit a new low!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Yumi：</span><br>

<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Fubuki：</span><br>
Sorry for... all the trouble.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Yūyaki：</span><br>
Do you have any memory of when you fought us?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Fubuki：</span><br>
Yes, albeit faintly... Like I was an outsider, peering in... It felt like I was someone else entirely.<br>
But... now I'm fine. I know for a fact the words I'm speaking are my own.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Yumi：</span><br>
Thank god... That's such a relief.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Observer ：</span><br>
It's over now. This was very enlightening. Thanks for your "assistance." Heheh.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Fubuki：</span><br>
*gasp*!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Yumi：</span><br>
Hmm? Is something wrong, Fubuki?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Fubuki：</span><br>

Phew! We're finally free... Huh? Has the Mirror Sea been dispelled?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Lützow：</span><br>
Guess they made it something like, the Mirror Sea would disappear when we freed Fubuki, or something?<br>
Because otherwise, they'd probably have made us fight more before we could escape.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Kashino：</span><br>
We've regained connection to the port. I'll ask Akashi to bring an investigation team while we escort the wounded home to safety.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Implacable：</span><br>
You do that. I desperately need to rest back at the port.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Lützow：</span><br>
What was the point of all this, anyway? I hate the Sirens and their stupid, confusing schemes!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Implacable：</span><br>
After all of that, I think I know. The unique beings known as shinobis and their feats caught the Sirens' interest.<br>
In the same way they caught Akatsuki's and Reno's interest.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Akatsuki：</span><br>
What?! I am no Siren! You should not compare me to them!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Implacable：</span><br>
Of course not. While their way of thinking may seem complicated, in truth, there's no point trying to understand them.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Fubuki：</span><br>
...Ladies, I'm sorry for all the trouble you had to go through today. Allow me to apologize to you once more, when we're in a safer place.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Bremerton：</span><br>
C'mon, it's nothing for you to apologize over! We're practically used to this!<br>
<br>
RUMBLE!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Bremerton：</span><br>
Can't see a thing... Huh? Is that a door?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Reno：</span><br>
I... guess this is your literal doorway back home, girls. If nothing else, the Sirens do tie everything up in a nice bow at the end...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Asuka：</span><br>
Wait, we can go back if we go through the door?<br>

It does resemble a world gateway... Yet something's different about it. It feels a little nostalgic.<br>

If our past experiences are any indication, it's probably broken. One of our interdimensional doorway experts should be on the way.<br>
It'll take a while to fix it, but at least we'll figure out its functions as we examine it.<br>
Until it's running again, you're welcome to stay at our port and rest! Fubuki'll need a check-up anyway!<br>

Indeed. You've yet to formally introduce yourself as well, Fubuki. We'll have plenty of time to talk after you've healed.<br>
Please, do allow me to invite you to a tea party after that. I'm not bad at brewing tea, as a matter of fact. You're going to love it!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Reno：</span><br>
I wouldn't if I were you...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Implacable：</span><br>
Wouldn't what, hmm?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Reno：</span><br>
Uhh... Never mind...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Fubuki：</span><br>
Kindly forgive me for not giving you my due introduction. I'm pleased to be staying with you for a while.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Akatsuki：</span><br>
It looks like we'll all be here for some time! Hooray! Asuka, you must teach me more ninjutsu!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Asuka：</span><br>
You got it! I'll whip you up into a great shinobi!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Akatsuki：</span><br>
Err, instruct me by all means, but please no whipping...<br>
