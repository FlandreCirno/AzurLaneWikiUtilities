Christmas Party!<br>
<br>
How to Craft a Cookie<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Seattle：</span><br>
Ingredients... check! Oven... check! Everything's perfect! The gingerbread cookie is gonna turn out awesome this time!<br>
... or maybe it won't. Something's still missing...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">San Diego：</span><br>
Lalala~♫<br>
Hey Seattle, why the long face? Why don't we go for an exciting snowball fight to cheer you up~<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Seattle：</span><br>
Oh, San Diego. I'm prepping for tonight's Christmas party, but...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">San Diego：</span><br>
*sniff sniff* Hmm... are you baking some gingerbread? It smells great!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Seattle：</span><br>
Bingo! I'm making gingerbread cookies! Hey, while you're here, you mind being my taste tester?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">San Diego：</span><br>
Can I really? In that case, I'll help myself!<br>
... Shoo goood! One more!<br>
<br>
San Diego wolfed down the gingerbread cookie.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">San Diego：</span><br>
Phew... thanks for the treat!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Seattle：</span><br>
What'd you think?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">San Diego：</span><br>
I'm stuffed!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Seattle：</span><br>
Awesome! ... Hang on! You've gotta tell me how it tasted!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">San Diego：</span><br>
Hmm... It was just "good," I guess?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Seattle：</span><br>
Welp, I figured as much. It's missing that little extra something...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">San Diego：</span><br>
Love?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Seattle：</span><br>
Come again?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">San Diego：</span><br>
You know, "love makes the best seasoning," or something like that?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Seattle：</span><br>
Love... Love, huh... What's the deal with love...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">San Diego：</span><br>
I have no idea!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Seattle：</span><br>
Still, you might be onto something there! I'll start by asking around, but first I need to send out invitations to the other factions.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">San Diego：</span><br>
I didn't catch any of that, but it sounds good!<br>

Christmas Party！<br>
<br>
Queen's Profile<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Neptune：</span><br>
The right hand is looking good! Lady Warspite, your part is next!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Warspite：</span><br>
Calm down... Calm down, Warspite... Great! That should do it for Her Majesty's eyebrows!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Neptune：</span><br>
Impressive as always, Warspite! A beautiful depiction of Her Majesty's face, if I must say so myself!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Warspite：</span><br>
Phew... we managed to finish in time.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Seattle：</span><br>
Yo, what's up with that giant gingerbread cookie?!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Neptune：</span><br>
Why, if it isn't Seattle. Thank you very much for arranging the Christmas party.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Seattle：</span><br>
I'm just doing this 'cause it's fun~♪<br>
But having that said, I ran into some issues while making my own gingerbread cookie...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Neptune：</span><br>
What kind of issues?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Seattle：</span><br>
Well, y'know, I was thinking that my cookie was lacking some "love"...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Warspite：</span><br>
"Love," huh... I was also worried about that.<br>
So this is what we decided on this year! A special gingerbread statue, fashioned in Her Majesty's image! We call it the "Queen's Profile!"<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Seattle：</span><br>
Dang... That's pretty awesome...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Neptune：</span><br>
Hehe... did you think it was just a regular gingerbread cookie?<br>
We've prepared countless ingredients as well as an industrial-size oven for this project! And after many rounds of trial and error...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Seattle：</span><br>
Neptune, I don't know how to say this, but... isn't this a bit too big?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Wakaba：</span><br>
Yeah, it's way too big... How many times did you make me taste test? It was really tasty, but...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Neptune：</span><br>
Oh my, did you not volunteer to be our taste tester yourself, Miss Wakaba?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Wakaba：</span><br>
Because I was allured by the smell of gingerbread while handing out presents~!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Neptune：</span><br>
That indeed is the Royal spirit. Your dedication shall not go to waste.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Warspite：</span><br>
Just wait, Your Majesty! This year, you'll be pleased for sure!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Neptune：</span><br>
That's right! The Royal Maids will be stunned speechless by our magnificent Christmas present!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Seattle：</span><br>
A-anyway, really appreciate the tips! Please swing by the Christmas party later and have some fun!<br>
Now if you'll excuse me, I've gotta go. The gift exchange should be starting soon.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Wakaba：</span><br>
Wait, Seattle! Let me help you with that!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Neptune：</span><br>
Hmm? Never mind, we're about done over here anyway. I will accompany Her Majesty to the party later, so do continue the good work, Seattle.<br>

Christmas Party!<br>
<br>
The Hearth's Warmth<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Isuzu：</span><br>
So waaarm~<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Wakaba：</span><br>
Ahh, waaarm~ I want to slack off in front of the fireplace too~<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Isuzu：</span><br>
Yeah, tell me about... Hey, I'm not slacking off! I was just wrapping the Christmas presents!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Wakaba：</span><br>
Ahaha, I was joking just now! I ate a whole lot, so I have to burn off those calories!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Isuzu：</span><br>
You ate a whole lot... right before the party...?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Seattle：</span><br>
I kinda feel bad for you, Wakaba...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Isuzu：</span><br>
Seattle, did you already finish up with the presents for the Eagle Union girls?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Seattle：</span><br>
Yup, all done! Agano, Kiyonami, you did a great job! Huh? Kiyonami, that outfit...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Kiyonami：</span><br>
Yuugure and I picked out this outfit together. She said it "looked very Christmassy," but it doesn't look weird, right?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Agano：</span><br>
Nope, it doesn't look weird at all. Hehe, that outfit makes you look like a delectable Little Red Riding Hood that any wolf would love to gobble up!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Kiyonami：</span><br>
Uuuugh...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Agano：</span><br>
Sorry, just messing with you. You're just too cute, so I can't help it. Hehe~<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Wakaba：</span><br>
Mhm, I totally get what you mean.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Seattle：</span><br>
By the by, I wanted to ask you one thing about gingerbread cookies...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Isuzu：</span><br>
Gingerbread cookies? What about them...?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Seattle：</span><br>
Yeah, I was worried about how to make sweets for the party, so...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Kiyonami：</span><br>
I think... m-making a cookie that looks like Hoppy... would be cute...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Wakaba：</span><br>
I don't want to hear about gingerbread ever again...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Agano：</span><br>
"Love" is fine and all, but what you really need is something to give it a little bit of "kick."<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Seattle：</span><br>
Ah, I get what you mean. Basically, I have to mix up the flavor a bit?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Isuzu：</span><br>
Right. And isn't there just the girl who would know all about that?<br>

Christmas Party!<br>
<br>
Speaking of Sweets<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Concord：</span><br>
The best way to keep yourself warm during a cold day is... with a whole bunch of calories~♪ Dewey, how about another cookie?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Dewey：</span><br>
I'll pass, thanks. Speaking of which, shouldn't we take the cake over to the party?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Concord：</span><br>
What a good kid you are, Dewey~ But it's all right, we can head out after I finish this~♪<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Seattle：</span><br>
Hey, I'm back~<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Dewey：</span><br>
Oh, Seattle. Sorry, we were just getting ready to take the cake over.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Seattle：</span><br>
Ah, don't worry! There's still plenty of time! I didn't come to rush you anyway~<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Concord：</span><br>
Since you're here then, why not have some sweets? Would you like a sundae, or a slice of cake?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Seattle：</span><br>
Uh, I really appreciate it, but I was hoping to ask you something...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Concord：</span><br>
So that's what's going on... You want to make your gingerbread cookie extra tasty?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Seattle：</span><br>
Exactly! And I figured you know more about sweets than anyone else!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Concord：</span><br>
That's an easy one! Double the sugar, double the sweetness. Double the sweetness, and double the deliciousness, right?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Dewey：</span><br>
You really do love your sugar, don'tcha~<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Concord：</span><br>
Sweets are a crucial part of Christmas, after all! That's why I think it'd be nice to have more sweets at the party!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Seattle：</span><br>
Tapping into the essence of sweetness... All right, I think it's all coming together now!<br>
Ah, let me help you carry the Christmas cake. Afterward, would you two mind helping me taste test my gingerbread cookies?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Concord：</span><br>
Of course~ As long as it's sweet, I'm totally down~♪<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Seattle：</span><br>
All right, I'm gonna make the best cookie, and put on the best Christmas party ever!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Dewey：</span><br>
Um, I'll help as well...<br>

Christmas Party!<br>
<br>
Christmas Party!<br>
At the Christmas party...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Seattle：</span><br>
Phew... I finished the cookies on time, and the party was a huge hit. Thanks, guys! I couldn't have done it without your help!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Dewey：</span><br>
Seattle, your gingerbread cookies were good.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Kiyonami：</span><br>
The ones shaped like Hoppy... so cute...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Concord：</span><br>
Gingerbread cookies supercharged with pure sugar... Pure bliss~<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Seattle：</span><br>
But man, the Royal Navy's gingergiant really dwarfs everything in its presence...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Agano：</span><br>
I heard about it from Wakaba, but seeing it in person is a whole other deal... Ahaha...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Queen Elizabeth：</span><br>
Wh-what is this...?!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Neptune：</span><br>
This is a gingerbread statue that was sculpted in Your Majesty's likeness.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Warspite：</span><br>
We've christened it the "Queen's Profile," Your Majesty.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Queen Elizabeth：</span><br>
Spectacular! You've outdone yourself, Warspite! Now, I shall boast to that girl who calls herself the "spiritual leader" of the Iron Blood.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Belfast：</span><br>
Well done, Lady Warspite, Lady Neptune.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Neptune：</span><br>
Heheh~ I figured even you would be shocked by something of this scale, Miss Head Maid.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Wakaba：</span><br>
I've had enough gingerbread for a lifetime... I'm going to go search for some nuts.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Isuzu：</span><br>
Ah, umm, the presents for the gift exchange are under the tree~<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Agano：</span><br>
I'm looking forward to finding out who's the lucky recipient of my present~~<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Neptune：</span><br>
Good grief, things always get so noisy whenever someone talks about presents...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Seattle：</span><br>
Hey, it's only Christmas once a year. Besides, it'll come again next year, so might as well get used to it.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Concord：</span><br>
That's right! That's what the Christmas spirit is all about~♪<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Seattle：</span><br>
Hehe, well said! There's no need to worry at all! All right, everyone, cheers!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Everyone：</span><br>
Cheers! Merry Christmas!!<br>
