A Disastrous Investment<br>
<br>
Crisis Looms<br>
Library<br>
This afternoon, the library was so quiet that one could practically hear dust settling.<br>
Just as I was about to put down my heavy planning materials and take a break, I noticed an unexpected figure by a bookshelf.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ting An：</span><br>
Hmm...<br>
<br>
Ting An furrowed her brow at a particularly thick book. Beside her was a stack of books almost half her height.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Beyond the Fissure: Why the Commercial Behemoth Sunk...?<br>
I'm surprised that you're interested in that.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ting An：</span><br>
C-Commander?! Why are you here?<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
I ran into some problems planning the port's new commercial development zone, so I came to learn more.<br>
And yourself? You look awfully tense.<br>
<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项1：Have you found yourself facing a business rival?</span>'''''<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项2：Something troubling you?</span>'''''<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项1）</span>'''''Have you found yourself facing a business rival?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ting An：</span><br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项1）</span>'''''No, no, I'm just confronting some personal difficulties.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项2）</span>'''''Something troubling you? Or maybe you're just a little tired?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ting An：</span><br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项2）</span>'''''I'm not tired... I just have a personal problem.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ting An：</span><br>
I hope this doesn't sound arrogant...<br>
But as you know, I've been very successful in the fields of commerce and investing. That only worries me more.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Worries you how?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ting An：</span><br>
Well, they often say that comfort breeds complacency.<br>
I've always been secure in my finances. That in itself may be the greatest risk of all.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
I get it. You're here to study how others have failed.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ting An：</span><br>
Precisely! In this moment of weakness, I believe that knowing how to avoid failure is more valuable than pursuing further success.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
What have you learned?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ting An：</span><br>
Quite a bit! For example, a film studio had discovered a disruptive digital technology. Instead of utilizing it, they shelved it in order to protect their outdated film business.<br>
<br>
With her eyes focused, she traces her fingertips over a chart in her book.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ting An：</span><br>
Some people call this phenomenon the innovator's dilemma. Past successes can become the greatest hindrance to embracing the future.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Like empiricists in military fields.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ting An：</span><br>
Yes, those are included among the case studies I've read. But... The more I read, the stranger it seems.<br>
Whether it's about business giants or rising tech startups, they all read to me as mere accident reports of others.<br>
Perhaps book knowledge isn't enough. I need more tangible experience.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Such as?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ting An：</span><br>
Such as... directly observing struggling or failed businesspeople? That would hardly be polite, though.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
I happen to have business in the commercial district tomorrow. Wanna come with me? New shops constantly come and go, so I think it's the perfect real-world study for you.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ting An：</span><br>
Huh? With you, Commander? Are you sure I won't interfere with your work?<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Don't worry about it. Understanding the world of business will help me plan the new zone, too.<br>
Besides... I'd have you as my research partner. Sounds like a winning investment to me.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ting An：</span><br>
Heehee. If you insist, then I'll get right to work preparing for tomorrow's research.<br>

<br>
A Disastrous Investment<br>
<br>
Who to Investigate?<br>
Commercial District - Afternoon<br>
Ting An and I spent the whole morning on her field research.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ting An：</span><br>
Hmm... Commander, what were your impressions of the shops we visited this morning?<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
I guess the word would be "dynamic." They left a much bigger impression than the ones in your book.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ting An：</span><br>
So you found it strange, too. I must've made a mistake in my selection process.<br>
I had no idea the all-you-can-eat barbecue restaurant would be emptied of its stock so quickly.<br>
They advertised their willingness to satisfy even the hungriest of girls, but they couldn't even last through one morning.<br>
And the sweets shop that claims to be sugar-free and good for you... It was sugarless, yes, but flavorless to match.<br>
They couldn't sell a thing. Quite the stark contrast with the barbecue restaurant next door.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
I guess they rushed into opening a store without finding a target demographic.<br>
<br>
Ting An opens her notebook. It's full of observations, but her brow only furrows further.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ting An：</span><br>
Commander, I've discovered a problem. I understand the reason for each of their failures, but...<br>
I fail to understand why they made incorrect decisions in the first place.<br>
What were they thinking? What subtle omens did they overlook?<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Hmm. I think analyzing as an observer is a completely different thing from real lived experience.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ting An：</span><br>
Very true! To go from knowing something to understanding it, you require the bridge known as experience. I think... that I, too, must experience failure.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Now that sounds risky.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ting An：</span><br>
What if I didn't experience it alone, though? Commander, this may sound like an odd suggestion to you...<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Go on.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ting An：</span><br>
If I funded it, would you... open a shop that was guaranteed to fail alongside me?<br>
Then, I'll experience the entire process from planning to failure!<br>
It would be so much more direct than studying other people's cases!<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
What should I do, then? Just help you run it?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ting An：</span><br>
No, you can leave the management to me as well. Just stay by my side, and I won't worry even if I'm losing money.<br>
Together, we will record our findings, analyze the process, and maximize the value of this learning experience!<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Using controllable costs to buy practical experience, huh? That sounds like your investment style.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ting An：</span><br>
C-Commander, do you think I'm being reckless?<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
A little bit. But I think it's an interesting idea.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ting An：</span><br>
Commander!<br>
<br>
She excitedly takes my hand. I feel warmth and softness through her palm.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ting An：</span><br>
I'm touched that you would accompany me on such a... such a wasteful investment!<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Shall we spend the rest of the day discussing our investment plan?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ting An：</span><br>
Gladly! Let's go to that café right over there. We can discuss the best way to lose money together!<br>

<br>
A Disastrous Investment<br>
<br>
Guaranteed Loss!<br>
Port - Restaurant<br>
After several days of preparation, the big day approaches. It's almost time to open the guaranteed-failure shop that Ting An has dreamed of.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ting An：</span><br>
Thank you for coming, Commander! I just finished getting everything ready.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Wow... It looks like a serious restaurant in here.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ting An：</span><br>
Of course! Fresh ingredients, professional equipment, and a clean environment are the fundamental signs of respect one should show to a business.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Respect, eh? I see. You haven't told me how you plan to turn a loss, though.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ting An：</span><br>
Don't worry. My concept is clear: the once-in-a-lifetime noodle life cycle restaurant.<br>
Our selling point is allowing customers to witness and even take part in the journey from wheat to noodle bowl.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
W-wheat? Er, shouldn't we have started with a farm, or...?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ting An：</span><br>
Oh, my! How did you know I was planning to rent a farm later?<br>
Customers will plant the seeds themselves and make a bowl of noodles that is entirely their own!<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
That sounds... time-consuming.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ting An：</span><br>
That's part of the experience! Now, Commander, I'd like you to be my first customer. Come take a seat by the window.<br>
We will begin the journey of the noodle life cycle now. First, put on this authentic farmer's hat to connect with the land.<br>
This is no ordinary meal – it's a once-in-a-lifetime journey that involves your own effort!<br>
<br>
When I put on the hat, she brings me a small plate of unprocessed wheat.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ting An：</span><br>
I bought this ordinary wheat for our use. Use tweezers and a magnifying glass to pick out the bad grains.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
You mean... I do it?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ting An：</span><br>
Of course. I'll help, naturally, but your effort will have a direct effect on the quality of the final product.<br>
<br>
I follow her instructions and begin the work. Once I'm done, she pours the final grains onto a small millstone.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ting An：</span><br>
We'll grind the wheat at a speed of fifteen revolutions per minute.<br>
If you'd like, you can put your hand on mine and experience the whole process of grinding wheat into flour.<br>
This is a special service just for our very first customer!<br>
<br>
Thirty minutes later, I can't help but smile at the sloppily-ground flour before me.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ting An：</span><br>
Now that we have flour, we'll knead the dough first, and then let it rest...<br>
<br>
My hands mechanically follow Ting An's instructions while my thoughts drift away amidst the restaurant's music.<br>
When I come back to my senses, two hours have passed, and I'm greeted by a bowl of noodles that is surprisingly normal in color and fragrance.<br>
There's no beef or even green onion in it.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ting An：</span><br>
Thank you for waiting. This is the bowl of noodles that we've put our hearts and souls into making.<br>
The once-in-a-lifetime limited-edition noodles!<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
So those last two hours...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ting An：</span><br>
Yes, Commander. We've finally completed this ritual of culinary art.<br>
The result is a bowl of noodles that is low in cost and mediocre in flavor, but... very audacious in both experience and pricing.<br>
<br>
Somehow, this extremely average bowl of noodles in front of us took a full two hours of work and stress to create.<br>
When the warm broth first runs down my throat, my weary heart feels strangely soothed.<br>
Before I knew it, I'd eaten the whole bowl. Meanwhile, Ting An rests her chin in her hand and fantasizes over the thought of how much money she'll lose.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ting An：</span><br>
This is it! Theoretically, almost nobody should be willing to pay for such a long and bizarre experience! At this rate...<br>
We're sure to go bankrupt!<br>

A Disastrous Investment<br>
<br>
The Secret to Profit<br>
Port - Restaurant<br>
Work has had me tied up, so I haven't been able to visit the restaurant in days.<br>
When it comes into view, though, I don't see the quiet I expected. Far from it, there's a long line winding out of the small building. Through the front window, I can see that the inside is packed.<br>
Ting An busily rushes between tables, serving wheat to the customers.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Umm... Congratulations on the successful opening?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ting An：</span><br>
Commander, you're here! Do you see it? It's beyond my wildest dreams...<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Yeah, this is one hell of a success. How did you do it?<br>
<br>
Her eyes dart about. Nervously, she takes out a mobile phone and holds it in front of me.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ting An：</span><br>
This is the cause... A certain someone filmed our entire process, and... everyone thinks this restaurant is an immersive noodle-making experience now!<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Someone? Isn't that your hand in the video, though?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ting An：</span><br>
I-I just happened to film it, and for some reason, it went viral...<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
So what you're telling me is... this place is making money.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ting An：</span><br>
Umm... From a raw numbers perspective, yes. It's a considerable profit, at that.<br>
R-right, Commander! Would you like a bowl? I happen to have broth and noodles at the ready, so I can make it right away!<br>
<br>
Ting An awkwardly changes the subject. Feeling a little bad for her, I accept her offer. I was just in the mood to taste those noodles again.<br>
She ties her apron and heads back into the kitchen. In less than ten minutes, I'm presented with a steaming-hot bowl of noodles.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ting An：</span><br>
Please enjoy!<br>
<br>
When I take a sip and slurp up some noodles... I don't find that same refreshing feeling. It's just a normal bowl of noodles now.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Very ordinary.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ting An：</span><br>
Right? Our core product isn't particularly competitive, after all.<br>
<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项1：Yet business is booming.</span>'''''<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项2：You don't seem happy.</span>'''''<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项1）</span>'''''Yet business is booming, despite our expectations.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ting An：</span><br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项1）</span>'''''That's right. Revenue is exceeding projections.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项2）</span>'''''Business is booming, but you don't seem happy about it.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ting An：</span><br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项2）</span>'''''Not quite. As a businesswoman, I'm more than satisfied.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ting An：</span><br>
Remind me, Commander. Why did you and I start this business?<br>
<br>
She gazes at me. Her usually sparkling eyes are clouded by confusion.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Because you wanted a guaranteed loss, so that you could experience failure firsthand.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ting An：</span><br>
*sigh*...<br>
<br>
It's a short sigh. She rests her forehead on the open ledger for a moment.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ting An：</span><br>
Yes. I wanted to lose money. But here I am, turning a massive profit out of nowhere...<br>
I've utterly failed at losing money, Commander.<br>

<br>
A Disastrous Investment<br>
<br>
The Big Loss Plan 2.0<br>
Port - Alleyway<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
It sure is quiet here... Are there really shops this way?<br>
<br>
Ting An walks to the side and pushes open an old, wooden door.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ting An：</span><br>
But of course. Welcome to our new shop – a secondhand shop that's REALLY guaranteed to lose money!<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
A secondhand shop? Well, it does sound like a losing investment...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ting An：</span><br>
That's not all. This time, I'm going for an even more direct route to failure: buy high, sell low!<br>
I'll use profits from the noodle shop to buy niche, overpriced, and slow-moving goods. Then, in the name of "inventory management," I'll clear them out at dirt-cheap prices!<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Talk about direct. If you wanted to be any more straightforward about losing money, you'd just start giving money away.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ting An：</span><br>
As partners, let us launch the grand opening of our secondhand shop!<br>
But first, I want you to close your eyes. This will help you experience the unique atmosphere and products we provide.<br>
<br>
Without waiting for my response, she covers my eyes with her hand. Deprived of my sight, the mixture of her scent and that of the old, wooden building becomes even clearer.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ting An：</span><br>
Now, Commander, have faith in me.<br>
I'll guide you to each item in our collection and place your hand on it. Tell me how much you think it's worth, based purely on what you feel.<br>
<br>
Taking my hand, she leads me forward. The first thing I touch is some kind of cold, metal object with intricate carvings.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ting An：</span><br>
Take special note of its texture for me. What do you think it is?<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Well, it is complex... A pocket watch, maybe? Or some kind of decorative case?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ting An：</span><br>
This is a Rococo-style silver case, and it was very expensive. What do you think it should be priced at?<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Ten percent of its value?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ting An：</span><br>
Oh? You'd put it that low?<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Aren't we trying to lose money?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ting An：</span><br>
*sigh*... If you say so, then I'll put this at a 90%-off clearance price.<br>
<br>
With that, Ting An guides me to another item. This one is warm, smooth, and has elegant curves.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ting An：</span><br>
What of this one? Its surface is very smooth, right? Touch it.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Is it porcelain? It feels nice, but also dangerously fragile.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ting An：</span><br>
That's right. It's a blue and white porcelain decoration. While its quality is excellent, it's hard to store due to its fragility.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Should we set another insanely low price?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ting An：</span><br>
Urk... I will leave that up to you. Our goal is to lose money, after all.<br>
<br>
The darkness sharpens my senses. Her hand hesitates for a moment, and she seems to close the distance between us just a little.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ting An：</span><br>
The next item... may require more careful evaluation.<br>
<br>
Instead of putting my hand directly on the object, she gently lifts and opens my hand.<br>
Then, she places her hand in mine. Her fingers are slightly chilly, but her palm is warm.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ting An：</span><br>
What do you think? Would you like to... hold onto it forever?<br>
<br>
Her question is direct – perhaps even challenging in its seriousness. As if she's waiting for a real appraisal.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Of course... This is a one-of-a-kind treasure.<br>
<br>
I give her a firm answer. She pauses for a moment, then gently removes the hand covering my eyes.<br>
When I open them, she's standing in front of me with flushed cheeks.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ting An：</span><br>
Ahem... There are other items that need your appraisal. We'd best get back to work.<br>
This time, I just know we'll succeed at failing!<br>
<br>
She picks up her ledger and puts pen to paper. Never once does she let go of my hand after that.<br>

A Disastrous Investment<br>
<br>
What Did We Sell?<br>
Port - Secondhand Shop<br>
After happily seeing off our last customer, Ting An puts up a "Sold Out" sign on the door.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ting An：</span><br>
Well, we sold everything.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
And on the first day of business...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ting An：</span><br>
That's right. Thanks to you, all of the goods I carefully prepared for this day are gone.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Surely we lost a ton of money this time... right?<br>
<br>
She opens the ledger and does some quick math.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ting An：</span><br>
Yes, it's a wonderful success. At this rate, we'll deplete our entire monthly budget in just three days.<br>
This has gone beyond even my most optimistic expectations.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Finally, we can fail as planned.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ting An：</span><br>
But Commander... Don't you think this failure could be even more perfect?<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Like how?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ting An：</span><br>
Well, don't you think it's strange that this shop on the verge of bankruptcy has such a hard-working and attentive owner?<br>
I think that's wrong. A failed owner should be far less competent than this.<br>
<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项1：Are you planning to slack off?</span>'''''<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项2：You mean you wanna have a bad attitude?</span>'''''<br>

'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项1）</span>'''''Are you planning to slack off?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ting An：</span><br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项1）</span>'''''Exactly! That should make the image of losing money more realistic and believable.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项2）</span>'''''You mean you wanna have a bad attitude and ignore your customers?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ting An：</span><br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项2）</span>'''''Exactly! We should do nothing but man the registers – or better yet, we could force the customers to do it themselves!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ting An：</span><br>
Meanwhile, you and I can nap the day away.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Surely that's going too...<br>
<br>
Before I can finish speaking, she pulls me into the chair beside her... and guides my head onto her soft lap.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ting An：</span><br>
Relax, Commander. This is all part of the experience... Close your eyes, please.<br>
<br>
I do as instructed. The scent of ink tickles my nostrils, and I'm touched by her warmth as her fingers stroke my hair.<br>
In this unexpected moment of peace and quiet, a wave of fatigue washes over me and entices me to sleep.<br>
A few hours later...<br>
When I wake from a dreamless sleep, evening sunlight dyes the shop in gold. Ting An has left me, but I'm covered by a coat that bears her scent.<br>
I sit up and look around. She sits behind the counter alone, staring at some documents.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Ting An? What's the matter?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ting An：</span><br>
Commander... I think we may have made a minor mistake.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
How? We sold out. Surely you've lost plenty by now...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ting An：</span><br>
Yes, we did sell out of our inventory... but I forgot to factor in the storefront itself.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Is this... a notice for demolition compensation? From my office, at that.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ting An：</span><br>
As it turns out, the port's new commercial development zone... includes this very address.<br>
The compensation is more than enough to cover the cost of all the goods.<br>
It was personally stamped by you just a few days ago.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
I totally forgot.<br>
<br>
Twilight engulfs the shop. The two of us are at a loss for words; we can only stare blankly at the notice.<br>

<br>
A Disastrous Investment<br>
<br>
True Profit<br>
Port - Office<br>
Two things lay on my desk: the demolition notice for the planned commercial development zone, and a generous compensation check.<br>
The notice bore two signatures: one mine, and the other... also mine, as it turns out.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
I might have done something ridiculous without even realizing it.<br>
<br>
A knock on the door interrupts my train of thought.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ting An：</span><br>
Commander, I see you've received the settlement statement.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Great timing, Ting An. Half of this check rightfully belongs to you.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ting An：</span><br>
Thank you, Commander. This money is the final and most important part of my plan.<br>
My business of losing money isn't over yet.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Wait, you're still on that?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ting An：</span><br>
First, I'd like to formally apologize to you.<br>
My single-minded focus on failure has forced you into a series of, frankly, ridiculous antics at my behest.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Don't be like that. I know your business acumen – even if you tried to lose money, I knew you'd find a way to make a profit.<br>
That's part of why I agreed to your proposal.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ting An：</span><br>
Thank you... However, I was the one to propose this business, so I must be the one to bring it to a close.<br>
This check is exactly how I'll accomplish that.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Go on...?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ting An：</span><br>
I'd like to share this unexpected windfall as a dividend with you, my partner. Rather, I want to exchange it for something...<br>
Specifically, time alone with you. No interruptions, nobody else.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
For all this money?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ting An：</span><br>
That's right! My initial goal was to lose money, remember? I think this purchase aligns perfectly with my needs.<br>
Have you heard?<br>
Plenty of people would pay incredible sums just to eat lunch with legendary figures.<br>
And to me, that is exactly who you are.<br>
Being in a warm room with you, having your undivided attention...<br>
That's the best return on investment I can imagine.<br>
<br>
Ting An circles behind me and wraps her arms around me. Her weight and warmth are palpable through my back.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Aha... So this was your real goal all along.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ting An：</span><br>
That's right! My plan has failed once again, because no matter how you calculate it, I'm about to win big.<br>
Now, as you've accepted my dividend payout...<br>
It's time for you to fulfill your end and indulge me... by "wasting" this special moment with me.<br>
<br>
The weight on my shoulders rises and falls in tune with her gentle breathing.<br>
In the sunlight, our shadows mingle into one. Time seems to slow down.<br>
I abandon all thought and surrender myself to the tenderness that Ting An so thoughtfully prepared.<br>
