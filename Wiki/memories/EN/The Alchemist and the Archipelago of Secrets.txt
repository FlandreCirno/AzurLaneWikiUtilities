Kala was drifting off to sleep on a dark night like any other.<br>
However, this night would soon turn out to be anything but normal.<br>
FWIIISH!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Kala Ideas：</span><br>
Urgh... What is all that racket? I'm trying to...<br>
Wait... What in the...?<br>
<br>
Kala opened her eyes. In front of her was not the usually familiar scenery she expected, but rather a small island filled with strange buildings, surrounded by a vast, endless ocean.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Kala Ideas：</span><br>
Have I been... transported to another world?<br>
Hmm... I do hope this is a figment of me still being half-asleep. Because if not, it would mean I now find myself in quite a conundrum...<br>
These buildings are made of a material I do not recognize. Similarly, their architecture is foreign to me as well...<br>
Did I perhaps... get spirited away by some alchemist?<br>
No, that's preposterous. I doubt any alchemist has the skill to transport me across worlds without me noticing.<br>
Hmm... Perhaps the place I chose to rest just so happened to be a door between realms?<br>
<br>
KABOOOM!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Kala Ideas：</span><br>
That was an explosion. Not far from here, either... It must've come from that island over yonder!<br>
<br>
Across the water, a battle was unfolding between two forces. On the surface, odd-looking ships of war – in the air, massive, mechanical birds.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">???：</span><br>
That's right, newcomer! You've come to the wrong place for a vacation, because there's nothin' but fire-and-brimstone around these parts!<br>
Only reason you're not getting blown to bits right now is 'cause I predicted where you'd warp in and set up defenses ahead of time! Pretty smart, ain't I?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Kala Ideas：</span><br>
You, who fell from a mechanical beast in the sky... Who are you? Some kind of Elemental?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Purity：</span><br>
What? No! I'm Purity, the hero who traverses the galaxies, leading the resistance to upend the Sirens' plans!<br>
...So, are you going to show me your appreciation for saving you? C'mon now, tell me how great I am!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Kala Ideas：</span><br>
Oho. Save me? I think you mean "dragged me into a battle I have no part of."<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Purity：</span><br>
Oof... This girl's a sharp one...<br>
Okay, it's not like I had NOTHING to do with you ending up here... but 99% of it is Tester's darn fault!<br>
All I did was fiddle around with your arrival schedule a little bit! And the point of that was to ruin Tester's plan!<br>
I was just trying to wrap this fight up before y'all showed up, but you arrived ahead of the rest for whatever reason. So, that last 1% is on me.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Kala Ideas：</span><br>
Hrm. Judging from the state of this battlefield, you don't seem to be lying. I will trust you for now.<br>
As far as I can tell, however, both sides of this fight seem to bear striking similarities. Is this "Tester" you mentioned one of your kind?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Purity：</span><br>
Uhh, technically, we're both Sirens, but we're not exactly chums... Look, it's complicated, so I'll fill you in later.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Kala Ideas：</span><br>
Very well. A different question, then. You mentioned "the rest" a moment ago. Do I take that to mean there are others you've involved in this situation besides myself?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Purity：</span><br>
Hey, didn't I just say it's only 1% my fault? But yeah, there are five others on the way. According to the database, their names are, uh... Ryza, Klaudia, Patricia, Lila, and Serri.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Kala Ideas：</span><br>
What are the odds...! Good grief. Even in my dreams, I would've never imagined I'd get caught up in an adventure – or rather, a dilemma – with all of them.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Purity：</span><br>
Why do you sound more annoyed than scared? Most people dropped in the middle of a war zone would be having a panic attack by now.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Kala Ideas：</span><br>
You are speaking to Kala Ideas, chief of the Wave Tuner clan for countless generations. I have seen more than my fair share of battles.<br>
Now... You said my arrival here was not intended. That being the case, may I simply return whence I came?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Purity：</span><br>
Sure... but that's easier said than done. First, you aren't going anywhere until we clear out Tester's forces. Second, the other folks will be in a whole lot more trouble without you.<br>
But listen, you can expedite the whole going-home process if you join my resistance and fight with me. You did say you've seen your fair share of battles, right?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Kala Ideas：</span><br>
Urgh... Seems like I do not have much of a choice then. I suppose I can treat this as an unplanned adventure and lend you my strength.<br>
However, I will not be joining your resistance. I have my own duties and obligations to see to once this matter is settled.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Purity：</span><br>
Fair enough. I respect that.<br>
Okay, first things first – hop on my rigging. I'm gonna take you to my base and get you kitted out. You don't stand a ghost's chance against the Sirens without some gear.<br>
<br>
O travelers from far-off lands, heed these words I impart to thee<br>
Thou art in the Land of Beginnings, thy luminous guidepost it shall be<br>
Westwards lay the Underworld Grove, an illusion born from memories<br>
Eastwards lay the Castle of Strife, where the brutal truth lay buried<br>
Southwards lay the Desolate Capital, abound in treasure among loam<br>
Northwards lay the Central Foundation, thy way of returning home<br>
Gather the hidden recipes, and great power shall thee find<br>
Then, breach the towering barrier with four keys combined<br>
Leverage thy wits, and upon thee shall be conferred a prize<br>
Disregard my words, and all that awaits is thy demise<br>
…………<br>

{{折叠面板|标题=A New Adventure|选项=2|主框=1|样式=primary|展开=是}}
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">ReisalinStout：</span><br>
My name is Reisalin Stout, but everyone calls me Ryza. I'm the ordinary daughter of an ordinary farmer.<br>
I come from the ordinary village of Rasenboden, on an ordinary island called Kurken Island.<br>
And I once had an extraordinary adventure.<br>
An adventure no one has experienced before, and nobody else knew about. An adventure that was just for us.<br>
Three years passed since then. I'd returned to my ordinary days, and another summer was just about to begin...<br>
That was when I ended up going on another adventure in a huge, bustling metropolis.<br>
After many new encounters, and many sad goodbyes...<br>
I decided to return to my former ordinary days once again.<br>
Then, one day, I got caught up in another extraordinary occurrence.<br>
Just as always, I took a boat out to our secret hideout.<br>
But no matter how long I sailed, I never seemed to get any closer...<br>
...When I regained my senses, I found myself here, washed up on a shore I've never seen before.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Alfredo Oriani：</span><br>
Woah... You've really experienced a lifetime of adventure!<br>
This smells like a huge scoop... But before I go off the rails – what do you make of this, Investigator Bristol?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Bristol：</span><br>
Sticking to a familiar course, yet somehow ending up in a distant, foreign land... This sounds like a classic spirited away case at sea!<br>
And, while I can't make conclusions prior to a full investigation, I know who's most likely responsible here...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">ReisalinStout：</span><br>
Oh yeah? Who?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Alfredo Oriani&Bristol：</span><br>
- It has to be the Sirens! - It has to be Cthulhu!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Bristol：</span><br>
Come on, Alfredo! The Sirens-did-it thing has been done to death. We need a new, more interesting culprit.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Alfredo Oriani：</span><br>
Uh, what? I'm a journalist – my job is to report the truth, not to suspect squid monsters from space.<br>
Also, don't make this any worse! It's scary enough waiting for the sun to set while sitting inside a roofless old shack in the middle of an uncharted sea!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">ReisalinStout：</span><br>
...Um, you said something about "Sirens?' Are they the people responsible for all the weird stuff that has been happening?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Alfredo Oriani：</span><br>
Let me, uh, explain things one at a time. First of all, the Sirens aren't people. Just think of them as living machines.<br>
Secondly, we don't know for SURE that they did it yet. But going off my experiences, I'm like, 80 or 90 percent sure that they're behind this!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">ReisalinStout：</span><br>
Living machines? Are they like dolls made using alchemy?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Alfredo Oriani：</span><br>
Alche-what now? This isn't a fantasy novel. The Sirens are not dolls or anything cute like that. They're like deep-sea horrors with big frickin' guns and torpedoes.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">ReisalinStout：</span><br>
Oh, I see... Also, alchemy is no fantasy! As a matter of fact, I'm a real, honest-to-goodness alchemist!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Bristol：</span><br>
Whoa, are you serious?! So does that mean you can, like, create the philosopher's stone or turn stone into gold?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">ReisalinStout：</span><br>
Uhh... That's a tricky question...<br>
I CAN turn one metal into another, that much I can tell you.<br>
As for philosopher's stones, I can probably make those too, assuming we're talking about the same thing here.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Bristol：</span><br>
Holy cow... Did you hear that, Alfredo? We're in the presence of a real-life alchemist!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Alfredo Oriani：</span><br>
Well, assuming she's telling the truth, then we're once again dealing with someone from another world. The stone monument did say something about "travelers from far-off lands," so...<br>
If that's true, we can safely assume that the Sirens are behind this. It would explain why we suddenly steered off course and lost contact with the port.<br>
All that is to say... getting out of here is gonna be a whole lot harder than I first thought.<br>
<br>
While the girls were speculating inside the abandoned shack, a voice suddenly called out to them.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">???：</span><br>
Ryza! Is that really you?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">ReisalinStout：</span><br>
Klaudia! How'd you get here?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Klaudia Valentz：</span><br>
I don't know. I was writing out a cargo list in my room when I suddenly got really sleepy... Next thing I know, I woke up on the coast.<br>
How did YOU end up here? And do you have any idea where we are?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">ReisalinStout：</span><br>
I got here pretty much the same way you did. I don't know how it happened, or where in the world we are either...<br>
But luckily, these girls who work for something called the "Azur Lane" think they might have a clue.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Klaudia Valentz：</span><br>
Azur Lane? Shimakaze said something about that just earlier. Are they her friends?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Shimakaze：</span><br>
Indeed they are! That over there is Bristol from the Eagle Union, and beside her is Alfredo Oriani from Sardegna.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Klaudia Valentz：</span><br>
Oh. It's nice to meet you. My name is Klaudia Valentz. Thank you all for helping me find Ryza amid all this confusion!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Alfredo Oriani：</span><br>
You're welcome. We're all trapped here 'cause of the Sirens, so we'll need to stick together and work as a team!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Formidable：</span><br>
Oh, it seems we're not alone. Greetings, everyone. The young lady behind me seems to be lost, so I led her here.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Patricia Abelheim：</span><br>
Hello, I'm Patricia Abelheim. I'm the daughter of a noble residing in the royal cap– Wait... Miss Ryza and Miss Klaudia?! You two are here as well?!<br>
F-forgive me, I lost my composure... Ahem. Allow me to thank you all for rescuing me.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Formidable：</span><br>
Please, I only did what anyone would do.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">ReisalinStout：</span><br>
Can't believe even Patricia's ended up in the same boat as us.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Klaudia Valentz：</span><br>
Are you okay, Miss Patricia? Were you hurt on the way here?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Patricia Abelheim：</span><br>
No, I'm fine, thanks to Miss Formidable. I suddenly found myself on this beach after losing consciousness in my room, and she came to my aid right away.<br>
If I may ask, how did you two arrive here?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">ReisalinStout：</span><br>
More or less the same way you did... Heck, I said that to Klaudia just a minute ago.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Klaudia Valentz：</span><br>
It wasn't that long ago when we parted ways in the capital, and now, here we all are again... under bizarre circumstances.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Patricia Abelheim：</span><br>
Yes. It's as wonderful as it is confusing... Incidentally, does anyone know what is going on here?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">ReisalinStout：</span><br>
These girls think we were all transported to another world because of a group called the "Sirens," who are apparently living machines.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Patricia Abelheim：</span><br>
Transported? Sirens? Living machines? Wait, slow down, please. This is too much information to take in at once...<br>
<br>
KABOOOM!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Patricia Abelheim：</span><br>
*gasp*! Was that... an explosion?! Did someone detonate a bomb not far from here?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">ReisalinStout：</span><br>
Either that, or they're fighting using explosives! If so, we might not be the only ones who were sent here!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Shimakaze：</span><br>
Actually, that was the sound of Suruga's cannons! I'd recognize that sound anywhere! What's more, it definitely came from the direction she went to investigate!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Formidable：</span><br>
I would speculate she has encountered a Siren ambush. Bristol, stay behind and protect these young ladies. Alfredo and Shimakaze, let's provide backup for Suruga!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Bristol：</span><br>
Roger that! Follow me, girls! I'll lead you someplace safe!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">ReisalinStout：</span><br>
Hang on a sec! Is there anything we can do to help?<br>
More of our friends might still be out there! Besides, I think we should all put our heads together to figure out how to get out of this mess.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Formidable：</span><br>
I appreciate the sentiment, but... are you even capable of fighting?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">ReisalinStout：</span><br>
I think we can handle ourselves. We've been on a handful of adventures together and even defeated a crazy powerful monster called the Ravaging Queen.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Klaudia Valentz：</span><br>
Yeah. I've grown a lot over my adventures with Ryza and our friends. I promise I can be useful in battle!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Patricia Abelheim：</span><br>
Likewise. You helped me, so it's only natural for me to return the favor.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Formidable：</span><br>
Well... If you're quite certain, then we would be much obliged. Bristol, lead the young ladies atop the mass-produced ships. The rest of you, come with me!<br>

Mirror Sea - In the past<br>
Inside Purity's temporary command post...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Purity：</span><br>
Heh heh! So whaddya think? This baby oughta raise your combat capabilities by at least 300%!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Kala Ideas：</span><br>
So this is a "rigging," as you called it... Yes, I do feel stronger.<br>
Hrm... How does one attack with it? Do I simply aim straight ahead of me and fire?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Purity：</span><br>
Yeah, that's the– Whoa, you trying to kill me?! Point that thing AWAY from me!<br>
If you want some target practice, shoot at Tester's mass-produced mooks outside instead.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Kala Ideas：</span><br>
Refine my skills through live combat, you say? A wise suggestion. And you? What will you be doing in the meanwhile?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Purity：</span><br>
Me? I just pinpointed the location of the Mirror Sea's control center. That's where I'm gonna find Tester.<br>
Take my fleet and attack head-on. While she's distracted, I'll sneak in behind the lines and end her sorry existence with one blow!<br>
...But if we fail, it's gonna come down to a war of attrition, and we ain't winning one of those.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Kala Ideas：</span><br>
Oho. And you're sure that you'll be able to defeat her in a one-on-one?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Purity：</span><br>
Hell yeah I will! One-on-one fights are my specialty!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Kala Ideas：</span><br>
I see. You Sirens do remind me of the Philuscha somewhat, your kind having both clearly defined roles and unique abilities.<br>
Knowing that, I leave Tester to your capable hands. In the meantime, I shall lead your fleet.<br>
Heheh... It will be interesting to see what destruction I can cause with this rigging in tandem with my natural powers.<br>
<br>
Mirror Sea Ruins - Land of Beginnings<br>
KABOOOM!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Suruga：</span><br>
That ought to be the last one! Are you two okay?!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Serri Glaus：</span><br>
We're fine... Thank you.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Lila Decyrus：</span><br>
No problems here. Suruga, you're one tough fighter. I've felled my fair share of behemoths, but it's as if the sea is your playground...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Shimakaze：</span><br>
Suruga, I've come to your aid—h-hey, is it just me, or is the fight already over?!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Formidable：</span><br>
That is our Suruga for you, ever at home on the battlefield. I presume your acquaintances here are more of Ryza's friends?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">ReisalinStout：</span><br>
Lila, Serri! You ended up here, too?!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Klaudia Valentz：</span><br>
It has been so long, Miss Lila and Miss Serri.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Patricia Abelheim：</span><br>
Have you two been well?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Lila Decyrus：</span><br>
Ryza, Claudia, even Patricia... What a place to run into you girls.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Serri Glaus：</span><br>
Hey, Ryza... It's been a while. Are we in another world, or something?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">ReisalinStout：</span><br>
Seems like it. So you've already figured things out, Serri?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Serri Glaus：</span><br>
No... I just sensed that the flow of the air here is nothing like what I'm used to.<br>
Guess that means I'm right.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">ReisalinStout：</span><br>
We just learned about it a little while ago, but basically...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Lila Decyrus：</span><br>
Azur Lane, shipgirls, the Mirror Sea, Sirens... I've never heard of any of this.<br>
But thanks. I'm starting to understand the mess we've gotten into now.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Serri Glaus：</span><br>
If this really is another land... then Formidable, you'd better be careful. Those enemies had the aura of Philuscha on them...<br>
The Philuscha may have been brought here alongside us.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Formidable：</span><br>
These so-called "Philuscha," I presume, are lifelong enemies you've fought in your own world?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Serri Glaus：</span><br>
I don't know about lifelong... but sure, kind of.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Formidable：</span><br>
Then the Philuscha you know are not machines, but living beings?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Lila Decyrus：</span><br>
Yeah. They hate water by nature, and... Huh. Come to think of it, those enemies were off.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Formidable：</span><br>
Interesting that you should mention that. While everyone was talking, I took the liberty of searching the enemies' remains.<br>
Based on my investigation, I believe that those were mass-produced models made from Sirens' knowledge of the Philuscha you know.<br>
I base this off of the fact that our enemies' remains were all mechanical. It seems that the Philuscha of your world were not truly brought here.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Serri Glaus：</span><br>
Guess not... Well, at least that's some good news.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Alfredo Oriani：</span><br>
Welp, we've finally got a moment of peace. Say, everyone! It's all dark out, and I don't wanna stay in such a messy place...<br>
Most of all, you've all gotta be tired. How about we eat and rest at my mass-produced ship?<br>
Trading scoops is a lot more efficient when you've got a full belly and a rested body!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Shimakaze：</span><br>
I concur with Alfredo! Honestly, I'm famished...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">ReisalinStout：</span><br>
Oh boy, otherworldly delicious foods?! I'm so in! C'mon, let's go! I'm hungry for both food and knowledge!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Bristol：</span><br>
Hehehe! I've been taking notes this whole time. Let's solve some mysteries over a big meal!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Formidable：</span><br>
There you have it. Please lead the way, Alfredo.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Alfredo Oriani：</span><br>
Roger that! Come, everyone: to the mass-produced model of Sardegna's own Oriani-class destroyer!<br>
Our Sardegnian cuisine is so good, it'll make you forget you're smack-dab in the middle of a battlefield! Now get those butts into gear and follow my lead!<br>

Mirror Sea - In the past<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Purity：</span><br>
Hum-dee-dum~♫<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Kala Ideas：</span><br>
You're in awfully high spirits.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Purity：</span><br>
Duh, I'm in an awesome mood! 'Cause I just smoked Tester, and now this place's resources are all mine!<br>
I just gotta make the salvage program handle the rest... There! Now, we can kick back until the recycling process is all done.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Kala Ideas：</span><br>
Then is my job here done? I expect you to make up for your "1% of the blame" and send me back from whence I came.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Purity：</span><br>
Yeah, yeah, cool it. I'm gonna have to work my magic on this sea so it'll be safer for your five buddies.<br>
Might as well take a look at Tester's database. Let's see here… What did she prepare for this experiment?<br>
Ruins, Philuscha, another world, alchemy... Huh?<br>
Heheh... I've got a heck of an idea. Since we have to recycle this whole place regardless, why not just turn everything into a bunch of ruins?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Kala Ideas：</span><br>
...I have to wonder what train of thought led to that.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Purity：</span><br>
I mean, your buddies were gonna run into Tester's stupid traps. But we broke 'em all, right?<br>
So if we leave without doing anything, they're just gonna arrive at an empty patch of water with a portal sitting in the middle.<br>
That's too boring! They're going to another world, for goodness' sake!<br>
So I'm thinking, how about we make some safe ruins for them to explore before sending them off?<br>
Fortunately, we just happen to have kicked a whole lot of butt around here. There's plenty of destruction and remains to go around. Pretty sick idea, right?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Kala Ideas：</span><br>
...I've watched the finest of buildings succumb to ruin with the passage of time, but never have I witnessed someone attempting to create ruins themselves.<br>
Incidentally, what would you do if I were to refuse?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Purity：</span><br>
That would just mean you're too lame to recognize the genius of the great Purity's plans!<br>
Besides, making these ruins isn't just for fun. It'll be proof that we fought side by side and had an awesome adventure together!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Kala Ideas：</span><br>
Proof of our adventure, hm? That makes sense. I suppose I have no reason to stop you.<br>
<br>
Mirror Sea Ruins - Land of Beginnings<br>
Now fed and rested, the girls set out to gather information about the place they found themselves in.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Formidable：</span><br>
My aerial survey is finished. It would appear we are on an archipelago made up of four large islands.<br>
Unfortunately, I couldn't get a closer look on the northern island as it's home to strong Siren defences. I have more details on the remaining three, however. This island we're on is littered with the ruins of stone buildings...<br>
The island to the west is shrouded in purple woodlands, and the last island to the east seems to be dotted with metallic city ruins. Miss Ryza, have you managed to decipher that stone monument?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">ReisalinStout：</span><br>
I've figured out the gist of it. It looks pretty ancient, but the text is just barely legible.<br>
Basically, there are five islands in this archipelago, and the island we're on lies in the center. There's also a few hints that tell us what we have to do.<br>
First, we have to find hidden recipes, presumably alchemy recipes, spread out across the islands. Apparently we'll get new powers if we do that.<br>
There are also four keys we have to gather. It says they'll be needed to break through a barrier somewhere.<br>
Finally, there's one island to the north called the "Central Foundation," which apparently is our way back home.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Alfredo Oriani：</span><br>
That's good to– Hey, there's a key right under the monument! We get a freebie!<br>
<br>
Item obtained: Land of Beginnings Key<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Alfredo Oriani：</span><br>
Also, Formidable, are you SURE you surveyed everything? You said there are four islands, while the monument says there are five, according to Ryza.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Formidable：</span><br>
That is strange, yes, but I can assure you I was thorough. If I had to hazard a guess, the fifth island is likely concealed by some Siren technology.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Bristol：</span><br>
Hmm... Based on your description, I think that's where the "Desolate Capital" is. There's treasure there, so why else would they hide it?<br>
I say we head there and try to find it. I'm dying to investigate some ruins!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Alfredo Oriani：</span><br>
Hold your horses! I wanna check out the Castle of Strife first. Doesn't that "where the brutal truth lay buried" part sound interesting?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Bristol：</span><br>
Are you kidding me? Treasure sounds way more interesting!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Alfredo Oriani：</span><br>
The truth matters more than riches!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Patricia Abelheim：</span><br>
We have a conflict of opinions, I see...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Shimakaze：</span><br>
Bristol, Alfredo, let's all calm down here! After all, isn't the prospect of seeing real-life alchemy the most exciting thing of all?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Alfredo Oriani：</span><br>
Hey, that reminds me... Ryza mentioned something about alchemy when we met her, and she used some weird bombs in that last battle.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">ReisalinStout：</span><br>
I made those myself using alchemy. It's what I do, 'cause I'm a real, honest-to-goodness alchemist!<br>
...Right, I said that earlier. I guess it does sound ridiculous if you haven't seen it with your own eyes...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Klaudia Valentz：</span><br>
Then why don't you give them a demonstration with the cauldron we found?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">ReisalinStout：</span><br>
Well, I'd totally love to, but I don't have any materials on me.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Alfredo Oriani：</span><br>
In that case, just tell us what you need and we'll help you find them!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">ReisalinStout：</span><br>
You will? Awesome! Having that said, this place is completely foreign to me, so I also have no idea what kind of alchemy materials we can find here. Could you all take a look around first?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Formidable：</span><br>
Of course, anything to help a friend. I, too, would like to see this alchemy in action.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">ReisalinStout：</span><br>
Thanks! Okay, let's see what there is to find in this "Land of Beginnings!"<br>

<br>
Mirror Sea Ruins - Land of Beginnings<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Formidable：</span><br>
What is it, Miss Ryza? Have you found something noteworthy?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">ReisalinStout：</span><br>
This plant caught my eye. What do you think about it?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Formidable：</span><br>
I mean... it looks like a bunch of weeds. What about it?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">ReisalinStout：</span><br>
Hmm... That sounds just like what I need. Let's take it with us!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Klaudia Valentz：</span><br>
Ryza! There are some odd pillars over here!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">ReisalinStout：</span><br>
Whoa, looks like the ruins of a building. I'll see if I can break 'em with my staff.<br>
Hey, Bristol! Mind gathering that rubble next to you? I could probably use that stuff as material.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Bristol：</span><br>
But it's just a pile of rocks... Wait, let me guess – they're infused with magic? Wait, no, they probably contain some extremely rare ore!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">ReisalinStout：</span><br>
Uhh... Actually, they're just normal rocks.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Alfredo Oriani：</span><br>
Heheheh... I've totally figured out how it works! Voila! I caught this spider. You can use it as an ingredient, right?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Patricia Abelheim：</span><br>
Eek, a bug! P-please don't bring it near me!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">ReisalinStout：</span><br>
Ahah... Yup, Patty's still scared of bugs.<br>
You're probably right about it being a usable material though. Spiderwebs can be pretty useful as well, so try to grab a handful of those too.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Lila Decyrus：</span><br>
Seems like this island is sitting in freshwater. You can directly drink the water.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Shimakaze：</span><br>
Woah, you're right! I assumed we were in the middle of the ocean, so I never even bothered to try!<br>
I suppose that means we're not in a Mirror Sea... but rather, a Mirror Lake.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Suruga：</span><br>
(Wow, I'm really jumping to conclusions here! Obviously, the Sirens just turned salt water into fresh water. I don't know WHY they'd do that, but...)<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">ReisalinStout：</span><br>
That means getting drinking water won't be a problem! Plus, I can even use to synthesize stuff.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Formidable：</span><br>
Even something as plain as water is useful in alchemy?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Patricia Abelheim：</span><br>
So it seems. It has quite a number of uses, too.<br>
Normally, there's no need to collect water by hand when you can buy it from a vendor.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">ReisalinStout：</span><br>
Buying things IS more convenient, but nothing beats exploring new places and searching for your own materials. Oh, also, we'll be able to catch fish if I can make myself a fishing rod! Then we'll have something to eat, as well as another material to use for alchemy!<br>
<br>
Later, once the girls had gathered plenty of ingredients, they went back to the stone monument. They sat and caught their breaths while Ryza started adding materials to her cauldron.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">ReisalinStout：</span><br>
There we go! Now we mix it all together~♪<br>
Hehe, I can just tell how high-quality the ingredients we gathered are, so what comes out at the end is sure to be ridiculously useful!<br>
...Okay, this is coming together nicely. Let me stir one more time...<br>
Voila! I've made a high-quality neutralizer!<br>
<br>
Item obtained: Red Neutralizer<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Formidable：</span><br>
This is how alchemy works? How did you manage to create that from an assortment of completely different things?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Bristol：</span><br>
Whoooa! Now THIS is something I've never seen before! A magic craft from another dimension!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Alfredo Oriani：</span><br>
That weird-looking liquid even came out of the cauldron pre-bottled... That's just wack!<br>
And a photo op! I've got to immortalize this miraculous moment of actual alchemy being performed! Teach and Torricelli are gonna want to see this later!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">ReisalinStout：</span><br>
So, uh, I was thinking about this "rigging" recipe Klaudia found while exploring...<br>
I'm pretty sure this is one of those power-granting recipes the monument talked about. The item it synthesizes should make us able to fight alongside the rest of you.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Klaudia Valentz：</span><br>
Really?! I'm glad I was able to help.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Shimakaze：</span><br>
Oh boy! I'm extremely curious to see what kind of rigging you'll synthesize.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Alfredo Oriani：</span><br>
Moreover, it'll be a groundbreaking discovery if you're able to create a rigging using alchemy!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Suruga：</span><br>
Ahem. I hate to rain on your parade, but doesn't this entire thing seem a bit TOO convenient to anyone else?<br>
There so happens to be a cauldron fit for alchemy, a stone monument telling us what to do to get back home, and that's only the start of it...<br>
Then all the necessary materials are just lying around, same with the keys we need, and to top it all off, a recipe to make a rigging from scratch.<br>
That recipe is ESPECIALLY suspicious! We found it and the list of required ingredients, written in all capital letters, inside a box!<br>
Granted, I don't understand how alchemy works, but I seriously doubt it can simply poof a rigging into existence. Even if it can, can we really trust this cauldron to work as Ryza expects?<br>
In short, my point is this – the Sirens obviously left all this stuff for us!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Shimakaze：</span><br>
Oh goodness... The Sirens did it? ...I did not realize how charitable they were this whole time!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Suruga：</span><br>
That's NOT the conclusion you're supposed to draw. However you cut it, this is clearly a trap!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">ReisalinStout：</span><br>
Is it? Well, uh... Don't be mad, Suruga, but I just synthesized whatever this "rigging" thing is!<br>
<br>
Right as Ryza finished speaking, the cauldron erupted with a blinding light. The next thing everyone knew, an alchemized rigging had appeared around Ryza.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">ReisalinStout：</span><br>
Whoa! So THIS is what a rigging is like! I feel a strange power coursing through me!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Suruga：</span><br>
...Well, what's done is done. I suppose we could conduct a performance test. Just please, try to be careful.<br>

Mirror Sea - In the past<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Kala Ideas：</span><br>
I take it you're working on what you call the "Land of Beginnings," yes?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Purity：</span><br>
Yup! This island's gonna be packed with machines, ruins based on some stuff in the database, and a little bit of my original flavor.<br>
Whaddya think about the hints on the monument, by the way? Pretty good, right?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Kala Ideas：</span><br>
...These are meant to be hints? They read as no more than a lunatic's ravings to me.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Purity：</span><br>
Ravings? I worked real hard on that exercise in wordsmithery!<br>
A real tough customer, aren't you... Well, in any case, what are we gonna do with this next area?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Kala Ideas：</span><br>
Hmm... Up to you.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Purity：</span><br>
C'mon, don't be like that. I could make it look like the place you're from. Whaddya say to that?<br>
I read the database. I saw what happened to your home – how it was ruined and desecrated.<br>
I could restore it back to its lush, green state for you. How's about a trip down memory lane, huh?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Kala Ideas：</span><br>
I do appreciate the sentiment, but all things created in this place are fakes, are they not?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Purity：</span><br>
They're not fakes! They're highly faithful replicas!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Kala Ideas：</span><br>
Regardless, it would be no more than a fleeting illusion to me. I was cast into this realm amid a slumber, and I have no desire to enter a dream within a dream.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Purity：</span><br>
You sure you don't wanna see it? It'd be a piece of cake for me.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Kala Ideas：</span><br>
I do not care. If you absolutely must create a forest, then keep what you have now. This has more atmosphere.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Purity：</span><br>
Sounds good to me! Now the question is, what kind of monsters do I plop down? You need at least a LITTLE challenge for it to be a real adventure.<br>
Wait, I know... How 'bout I base them on the Philuscha?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Kala Ideas：</span><br>
In case you didn't know, the Philuscha are repelled by water.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Purity：</span><br>
For crying out loud... Screw it! I'm going for something brand new – mass-produced ships INSPIRED by the Philuscha.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Kala Ideas：</span><br>
Philuscha turning into vessels and overcoming their weakness of water... The thought of such an adversary terrifies me.<br>
<br>
Mirror Sea Ruins - Land of Beginnings<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">ReisalinStout：</span><br>
Rigging test, check! Synthesized a whole bunch of ammo, check! Now, it's time for the real show!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Patricia Abelheim：</span><br>
Let's get back to the matter at hand. Which island should we check out next?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Shimakaze：</span><br>
Well, why don't we just split up and check all of them?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Suruga：</span><br>
Not just yet. There are too many unknowns, and it would be risky to scatter our forces.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Lila Decyrus：</span><br>
Suruga is right. When you're investigating unknown ruins, the wisest course of action is to move as one.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Formidable：</span><br>
However, we do not yet know where this "Desolate Capital" lies. I presume the "Central Foundation" should wait until we've collected the keys, as well...<br>
That leaves us with two options: the "Underworld Grove" and "Castle of Strife."<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">ReisalinStout：</span><br>
How about we go for the grove first? If that's the Underworld we know, then it ought to be familiar.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Alfredo Oriani：</span><br>
Familiar? Whoa, are you saying you and your friends have been to the underworld?!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">ReisalinStout：</span><br>
Yep! It's a long story, but that was kind of like traveling to another dimension as well.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Alfredo Oriani：</span><br>
Let's walk and talk! I'm dying to hear all about your adventures!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">ReisalinStout：</span><br>
Sure, I'd love to share some stories!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Klaudia Valentz：</span><br>
Off we go on another adventure, Ryza. I'm just amazed that this is how it starts.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">ReisalinStout：</span><br>
Right?! We've got new friends along for the ride, too. But it's more like searching for a way home instead of exploring uncharted lands.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Bristol：</span><br>
Heheh, ruins are always teeming with secrets. Getting you back home is important, but don't forget the pleasure of adventure!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">ReisalinStout：</span><br>
Ooh, yeah! You're so right!<br>
Everyone, let's set sail for the western island's Underworld Grove! It's the start of an all-new adventure!<br>

<br>
Mirror Sea Ruins - Underworld Grove<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Shimakaze：</span><br>
Whoooa, no, this forest is too scary for me. I can practically smell the danger and desolation...<br>
Miss Serri and Miss Lila, did you seriously live in a place like this?<br>
You said it yourselves, and I still can't imagine it.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Lila Decyrus：</span><br>
This place does remind me of home.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">ReisalinStout：</span><br>
Basically, Lila and Serri are Oren people. Their home is the Underworld. It used to be such a beautiful place overflowing with greenery.<br>
But long ago, some bad alchemists found out how to go to the Underworld and started stealing away all of its precious resources.<br>
After they stole everything, these monsters called Philuscha started attacking the Underworld. They sucked up all of the land's power and turned it into a wasteland.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Bristol：</span><br>
They ruined people's homes... That's downright evil!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Alfredo Oriani：</span><br>
If alchemists destroyed their homeland... The Oren people must really hate alchemists because of that. D-do they hate you, too, Ryza?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Lila Decyrus：</span><br>
It's no surprise that you would think so. But just as there are good people and bad, one cannot call all alchemists evil. In the end, technology is but a tool; what matters is the wielder.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Serri Glaus：</span><br>
...Ryza isn't like them. She helped us in our time of need. She uses alchemy the way it was meant to be.<br>
That is why Ryza has my full trust.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Bristol：</span><br>
Wow, Ryza, you're too cool! You sound like the main character of a grand adventure story!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">ReisalinStout：</span><br>
Hehe... All I'm doing is using alchemy where it feels right, y'know?<br>
<br>
KABOOOM!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Klaudia Valentz：</span><br>
Ack! What was that?!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Suruga：</span><br>
Watch yourselves! Enemies are approaching fast!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Patricia Abelheim：</span><br>
Enemies? Do you mean the Philuscha-like mass-produced ships from before?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Suruga：</span><br>
Yes! There are new ones among them, too. Everyone, prepare for battle!<br>

<br>
KABOOOM!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Shimakaze：</span><br>
Aha! The killing blow is mine!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Patricia Abelheim：</span><br>
Incredible... Your stature is similar to mine, but your swordsmanship is on a whole different level... Clearly I still have a long way to go.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Shimakaze：</span><br>
If you want to hone your skills, Miss Patricia, I'd be glad to spar with you whenever you want!<br>
Although, you would need a rigging to move on the water. Don't worry, I'm sure we'll find another recipe that lets you equip a rigging just like mine!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Patricia Abelheim：</span><br>
You mean I'll get to use something like what Miss Ryza received? I'm... definitely looking forward to that!<br>
By the way, Shimakaze, you can simply call me Patty.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Shimakaze：</span><br>
Really? As you say, Miss Patty!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Patricia Abelheim：</span><br>
Um... I meant that you can omit the "Miss" as well...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Shimakaze：</span><br>
Huh? Oh! Right, sorry!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Suruga：</span><br>
......<br>
Hey, Shimakaze, did you notice anything about those enemies?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Shimakaze：</span><br>
Hmm... They were just a bit stronger than Mark III's. I'd speculate that they're upgraded variants.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Suruga：</span><br>
Agreed. I think the Sirens applied the same method they use to make upgraded Enforcers – they added improvements based on external data. In this case, the Philuscha.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">ReisalinStout：</span><br>
Mark III's? Enforcers? Is that what you call the Sirens we just engaged?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Suruga：</span><br>
It's a long explanation, but basically what you need to know is...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Lila Decyrus：</span><br>
...I see. So Sirens are categorized by the purpose they serve. In that regard, they're somewhat similar to the Philuscha.<br>
Eliminate their commander, and their army weakens. Eliminate their queen, and their army falls apart...<br>
I wonder if the Sirens discovered this shared trait from analyzing the Philuscha and decided to attempt a fusion with them.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Bristol：</span><br>
That's an interesting theory. It's possible we have a huge Siren plot on our hands! I'll write that down and investigate later.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Suruga：</span><br>
Uh, let's focus on more immediate things first. The plot can wait.<br>
First of all, there's the second key and rigging recipe. If the monument is correct, it should be somewhere in this forest.<br>

<br>
Mirror Sea - Underworld Grove<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Alfredo Oriani：</span><br>
Serri, what are you doing in the grass?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Serri Glaus：</span><br>
I'm examining the flora present in this forest.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Alfredo Oriani：</span><br>
Huh? Are you a botanist or something?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">ReisalinStout：</span><br>
Serri's part of the Green Plume clan of the Oren. They can figure out plants' traits just by looking at them.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Alfredo Oriani：</span><br>
Whoa, that's amazing! All she needs is a glance to identify the species and the genus?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">ReisalinStout：</span><br>
I don't think her ability extends quite THAT far, but it's close.<br>
Also, she's been on a long search for a plant with special purifying properties. How's that going, Serri? Found anything good?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Serri Glaus：</span><br>
...No. A closer look confirmed my suspicions.<br>
These plants are only replicas. I don't feel anything from them. No life, no growth. It's hard to even call them plants.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Alfredo Oriani：</span><br>
Wait, really? I guess the Sirens fabricated 'em somehow. They ARE masters of making fakes.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">ReisalinStout：</span><br>
Hey, let me have a look.<br>
Hang on a sec... Yeah, I can use this as an ingredient!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Alfredo Oriani：</span><br>
You serious?! Even fake plants have their uses in the cauldron?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Serri Glaus：</span><br>
Heheh...<br>
I suppose our local alchemist always finds a way to use the resources at her disposal, even if they're fake.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">ReisalinStout：</span><br>
It takes some improvisation, but yeah. Let's go ahead and gather some more stuff we can use later.<br>
<br>
Some time later...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Shimakaze：</span><br>
Suruga, Formidable, Ryza! I see a shiny treasure chest under that tree over there!<br>
Wait here, I'll go and see what's–<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Suruga：</span><br>
No, don't go rushing in! It could be booby-trapped!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Shimakaze：</span><br>
Second key acquired! See, Suruga? It was just an ordinary treasure chest! You worry too much.<br>
<br>
Item obtained: Underworld Grove Key<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Suruga：</span><br>
(Have I been wrong all along about how dangerous these ruins actually are...?)<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Shimakaze：</span><br>
There was a recipe inside the chest as well! Do you think you can use this to synthesize something, Ryza?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">ReisalinStout：</span><br>
Yeah, this looks like an alchemy recipe to me. Seems similar to the last rigging recipe we found, too. Based on the dimensions, I think this'll result in riggings for Serri and Lila.<br>
I have to say, it's really convenient that they wrote down all the items we need again.<br>
We're missing a few ingredients, but we can just grab those on our way back to the Land of Beginnings. Luckily, I memorized all the gathering points.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Formidable：</span><br>
What you're saying is, we need only gather everything on that list to make riggings for Miss Serri and Miss Lila, yes?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">ReisalinStout：</span><br>
Probably, yeah! Let's just get the stuff we need while we retrace our steps. Once we get back, it's alchemy time!<br>

Up next, the Castle of Strife! Whaddya say we turn the ruins Tester left behind into a fortified city?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Kala Ideas：</span><br>
Why not leave the ruins as exactly that – ruins? There is no need to alter them.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Purity：</span><br>
Don't fix it if it ain't broke, huh... Guess that works. It's like they say, "don't tamper with natural beauty."<br>
Alright, that was easy. Let's head to the next island while the Enforcers do their thing.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Kala Ideas：</span><br>
Wait. What are these humanoid creatures doing? I thought you said you'd leave this site alone?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Purity：</span><br>
They're just tidying up the place. Can't exactly leave it COMPLETELY untouched, can I?<br>
There are weapons, energy systems, contaminants, and bombs littering the whole place. That's a lot to clean up.<br>
If I don't, the next people who come through here are gonna meet one gruesome fate or another.<br>

Oho. How considerate of you. What of the boxes scattered about the site, then? Are they part of the cleanup as well?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Purity：</span><br>
Nah, those are treasure chests. 'Cause what are ruins without hidden treasure to find?<br>
Nothing, that's what. That's a sin that I, as the designer of this place, will not tolerate.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Kala Ideas：</span><br>
I suppose you're right about that.<br>
<br>
Mirror Sea Ruins - Land of Beginnings<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">ReisalinStout：</span><br>
Well, the synthesis was a success... at least as far as I can tell. Serri, Lila, what do you think?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Serri Glaus：</span><br>
This will be good to have in a fight. Thanks, Ryza. I'll treasure this gift.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Lila Decyrus：</span><br>
It feels like a set of armor and a weapon in one, yet it doesn't weigh me down whatsoever, almost as though it's an extension of my body.<br>
Having said that, I will need practice to master its use.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Shimakaze：</span><br>
This is starting to feel like a real adventure! We're equipping gear we just found and instantly becoming stronger.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">ReisalinStout：</span><br>
Yeah, you're right! We're even exploring ruins and finding treasure. This is why I love going on adventures!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Klaudia Valentz：</span><br>
If only I had a rigging, maybe I could fight with you...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">ReisalinStout：</span><br>
Hm? Did you say something, Klaudia?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Klaudia Valentz：</span><br>
Oh, no, nothing! Anyway, I guess we're going looking for the third key next?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">ReisalinStout：</span><br>
Yup. There's still that castle to the east to check out, and I wager that's where we'll find it.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Alfredo Oriani：</span><br>
We're heading to the Castle of Strife, where "the brutal truth lay buried?" Heck yeah!<br>
Finding out the truth is what I do! And I have a feeling it's gonna make a helluva scoop!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Bristol：</span><br>
Hey! Finding out the truth is an investigator's job! If anything, it's MY time to shine now!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Alfredo Oriani：</span><br>
Oh yeah? You wanna throw down the gauntlet and see who is better at it?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Bristol：</span><br>
Bring it on! First to learn the truth is the winner!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Shimakaze：</span><br>
If you're making it a competition, may I be part of it as well?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Alfredo Oriani：</span><br>
Why? You're neither a journalist nor an investigator. Do you have some secret skill I don't know about?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Shimakaze：</span><br>
Yes – my speed! The faster you are, the faster you can finish an investigation!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Alfredo Oriani：</span><br>
Ah, like a sleuth who's in and out of the field in a flash. You're on! Let's see what you can do, detective Shimakaze!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Shimakaze：</span><br>
Thank you! I won't go easy on you!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">ReisalinStout：</span><br>
You should know I'm no slouch either when it comes to scouring old ruins and uncovering buried truths!<br>
Which is to say, can I join your competition too, please?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Bristol：</span><br>
Heheh. Now the seasoned alchemist throws her hat into the ring as well... This will be interesting!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Alfredo Oriani：</span><br>
You're in! Let's keep the first round simple: whoever reaches the Castle of Strife first wins!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Shimakaze：</span><br>
Roger! Full speed ahead!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">ReisalinStout：</span><br>
Let's goooooo!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Suruga：</span><br>
Wait a sec! There could be traps along the... Ugh, why do I even bother...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Formidable：</span><br>
Heehee. Shall we head after them?<br>

<br>
Mirror Sea Ruins - Castle of Strife<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">ReisalinStout：</span><br>
Hey, is it just me, or does the sky look... off?<br>
It was blue just a minute ago, and now it's ash-gray all of a sudden!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Bristol：</span><br>
Woah, you're right... Wait, even the water is turning gray!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Alfredo Oriani：</span><br>
It's almost like someone put a black-and-white filter over the world... Let me go back a bit and see what happens.<br>
...Holy moly! All the colors came back!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Klaudia Valentz：</span><br>
Really? I want to see for myself.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Patricia Abelheim：</span><br>
Me too...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Klaudia Valentz：</span><br>
Whoa, you weren't lying. It looks like crossing this bridge is what changes the colors.<br>
How does that work? Is there a magic barrier of some sort?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Suruga：</span><br>
My guess is that the Sirens set up a device that changes the air's composition, or something like that.<br>
Why they'd do that, I can't imagine. Whatever their reasons, the fact remains that Siren ruins are rife with danger.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Shimakaze：</span><br>
Excellent point, Suruga! Since we're in a dangerous place, we should be swift and complete our investigation posthaste! Right?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Suruga：</span><br>
(No! I've been saying we should proceed more carefully this whole time!)<br>
Err, well... I suppose? Find whatever you're supposed to find quickly so we can wrap up this silly competition and get away from here.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Serri Glaus：</span><br>
This place is unlike any forest I've seen before.<br>
The ruins and wrecks here are quite old, too. They may even be as old as the entire region itself.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Lila Decyrus：</span><br>
Yeah... These buildings and shipwrecks look unfamiliar. They're cut from a different cloth than the rest we've seen thus far.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Alfredo Oriani：</span><br>
Familiar or not, they're still mass-produced Siren wrecks, just without the Philuscha elements. The buildings are definitely Siren make, too.<br>
What's interesting is just how much damage they've sustained. Someone REALLY wanted to raze this place.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Lila Decyrus：</span><br>
What a ghastly sight. Battles in your world must be brutal.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Formidable：</span><br>
That they are. Engagements with the Sirens always end in devastation.<br>
Having said that, it's always us who dish out the devastation, rather than receive it.<br>
Tangents aside, something's odd about this. We've never been here before, so who caused all this destruction?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Bristol：</span><br>
Oh! That's part of the puzzle! This is where the brutal truth lay buried!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Alfredo Oriani：</span><br>
Now we know what we're looking for... Well, time for round two! Everyone, split up and investigate! First to establish a theory wins!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Shimakaze & Bristol & Ryza：</span><br>
Okay!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Formidable：</span><br>
Ugh... Just please remember to look for the key and recipe as well.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Alfredo Oriani：</span><br>
Yeah, we know! Ready... set... Go!<br>

Mirror Sea Ruins - Castle of Strife<br>
KABOOOM!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Shimakaze：</span><br>
Whuah?! *cough cough*!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Suruga：</span><br>
Hey, you okay?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Shimakaze：</span><br>
I'm fine, just got a little smoke in my lungs!<br>
Ugh! What is with the treasure chests in this castle?! Each and every one of them has been rigged with a trap!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Bristol：</span><br>
Traps are just as much a part of exploring ruins as treasure is.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">ReisalinStout：</span><br>
I would say we should explore at a slow and steady pace, but given the sheer number of treasure chests... yeah.<br>
This is a real headache even for me, and I've been on a lot of wild adventures.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Shimakaze：</span><br>
It doesn't help that this whole place is booby-trapped!<br>
<br>
KABOOOM!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Suruga：</span><br>
Shimakaze!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Shimakaze：</span><br>
*cough cough*... I'm okay! It's just another smoke trap!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Suruga：</span><br>
...Try to be more careful. You didn't get hurt this time, but there's no guarantee you'll be as lucky next time.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Shimakaze：</span><br>
But we must find the key, and it's bound to be in one of these chests. We have to go through them all one by one...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Alfredo Oriani：</span><br>
Yeah, that's a problem. This would be easier if we just had more time...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Bristol：</span><br>
Heheheh... Looks like the journalist, the detective, and even the alchemist are all on their last legs!<br>
I suggest you give up and let the professional investigator handle this!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Alfredo Oriani：</span><br>
So... what? Do you have an easy solution to this?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Bristol：</span><br>
Funny you should ask! Introducing: Data 857, my robot assistant!<br>
Data here only has to scan a chest to decisively determine if it contains treasure or a trap.<br>
Created by Ingraham, this capable little bot has accompanied me on hundreds of missions. You can count on him to get the job done.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Suruga：</span><br>
Well, that's convenient. I'm in favor of letting Bristol deal with the treasure chests while the rest take a break. What do you all think?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Alfredo Oriani：</span><br>
Heck no! Nobody's fully uncovered the truth yet, and I'm not about to throw in the towel!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">ReisalinStout：</span><br>
What she said! I'm gonna go look around the surrounding area for clues!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Klaudia Valentz：</span><br>
Oh, I'll come with you then.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">ReisalinStout：</span><br>
Thanks for offering to help, but it's too dangerous for you to come along without a rigging. A wreck could blow up for all we know. You should stay behind with Patty.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Klaudia Valentz：</span><br>
...Oh, I forgot. You're right.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Lila Decyrus：</span><br>
Serri and I will stand guard so the rest of you can rest with peace of mind.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Patricia Abelheim：</span><br>
Thank you, and please be careful, both of you. While it's true you've become stronger, I have reason to suspect our enemies have as well.<br>

<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Bristol：</span><br>
锵锵锵~我的DATA-857已经成功完成任务了，第三把钥匙找到了哦！<br>
<br>
获得道具：「遗迹之钥·争斗之城」<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Alfredo Oriani：</span><br>
哇哦……不愧是英格拉罕，不容小觑啊！<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Bristol：</span><br>
喂！这时候应该夸奖的是我布里斯托尔吧！<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Serri Glaus：</span><br>
我们这里也有收获哦。给，莱莎。<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">ReisalinStout：</span><br>
这个是新的舰装的炼金配方？看上去……好像是帕蒂的诶！<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Patricia Abelheim：</span><br>
欸？居然真的连我的也有么……会做成什么款式，稍微有些令人期待呢。<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Bristol：</span><br>
咦，莉拉小姐和赛莉小姐是从哪里找到这份配方的？我的DATA-857在扫描的时候居然没有发现！<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Lila Decyrus：</span><br>
其实，在来到这里之后总感觉有些同胞的气息。刚才顺着这股气息搜寻的时候就找到了这个配方。<br>
那是一个还基本保留着原形的庭院一样的地方，配方就直接放在那里，而不是在某个宝箱里面。<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">ReisalinStout：</span><br>
……难道这个遗迹跟欧兰族也有关系么？如果是这样的话，岂不是说欧兰族在很早以前就与塞壬接触过了？<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Lila Decyrus：</span><br>
这也是我感觉到费解的地方。我并不记得以前有来过此地，或者有听过其他族人到过这里。<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Formidable：</span><br>
也许是塞壬在复制这里的时候，不小心从数据库里把类似的东西混进去了吧？<br>
就和之前模仿你们家乡的森林和融合了菲尔弗萨的量产型一样。<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Alfredo Oriani：</span><br>
感觉谜团又多了一分呢……<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">ReisalinStout：</span><br>
啊哈哈……遗迹中的故事，也不是每次都一定能得到答案的呢。<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Bristol：</span><br>
不，这就是最后一片拼图！结合现有的信息，伟大的调查员布里斯托尔已经得出结论了！<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Klaudia Valentz：</span><br>
……欸？好厉害，靠这些零散的信息就能得出结论么？！<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Shimakaze：</span><br>
你究竟发现了什么，布里斯托尔阁下！<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Bristol：</span><br>
哼哼哼，这件事就要从很久很久之前说起了~<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Patricia Abelheim：</span><br>
嗯嗯……<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Bristol：</span><br>
在很久很久以前，塞壬占据了这片海域，并在其基础上建造了自己的镜面海域与基地。<br>
它们一直在这里进行着自己阴暗的计划，直到有一天，从天上落下了一颗陨石！<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Alfredo Oriani：</span><br>
……陨石？<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Bristol：</span><br>
没错！一颗巨大的陨石从天而降，只用了一瞬间就摧毁了塞壬精心布置的基地！<br>
塞壬就这样，在没有防备的时候一下子全部被摧毁了，也就是我们只见到了大量塞壬残骸的原因！<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Alfredo Oriani：</span><br>
但如果真的是陨石所致的话，附近应该会有陨石坑才对，陨石坑又在哪里呢？<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Bristol：</span><br>
碑文上提到南方为失落之都！也就是说南方原本也是有一座小岛的，但是为什么我们什么都没看到？<br>
因为那座小岛已经因为受到陨石的直接撞击而沉入大海了！<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Alfredo Oriani：</span><br>
……虽然听起来有些不可思议，但是逻辑上居然能够自洽。<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">ReisalinStout：</span><br>
欧兰族和这件事又有什么关系呢？<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Bristol：</span><br>
这里是我觉得最有趣的部分~<br>
巨大陨石的撞击干扰了塞壬正在进行的实验，庞大的能量从被破坏的装置中泄露出来，生成了一道连通不同世界的门。<br>
而欧兰族的人就是这么被卷进来的！<br>
原本正在做自己事情的她们对于突然被卷入不同世界的事感到很生气，于是消灭了剩下的塞壬。<br>
因为欧兰族不喜欢炼金术士，所以把炼金配方扔得到处都是，然后留下了碑文，又通过门回去了！<br>
这就是过去发生的真相！<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Lila Decyrus：</span><br>
这部分好像有点勉强……就算是欧兰族，应该也没那么容易能够轻易战胜武装到牙齿的塞壬舰队。<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Patricia Abelheim：</span><br>
碑文和炼金配方的事好像也不太合理。如果说欧兰族扔下了炼金配方，那炼金配方原本是谁准备的呢？<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Bristol：</span><br>
唔……看来这个假说还有不少需要完善的地方，等我再仔细思考一下哦~毕竟假说就是要等人去完善的嘛！<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Suruga：</span><br>
我有一个建议，在这片不知道什么时候就会发生爆炸的战场废墟上停留实在是太危险了……我们还是先回起始之地怎么样？<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Bristol：</span><br>
嗯，说得对，先回去好好休息，吃饱了肚子才有精力继续想~<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">ReisalinStout：</span><br>
那就准备晚饭吧。之前作为炼金素材钓上来的鱼还有很多呢，要煮还是要烤随你们哦！<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Bristol：</span><br>
好诶！烤鱼，烤鱼————<br>

Mirror Sea - In the past<br>
Under Purity's command, countless small flying units circled around a forest of skyscrapers.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Purity：</span><br>
Throw a few laser turrets here, add in a shield generator or two... Ooh, and I'll have to grab a good number of kinetic weapons.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Kala Ideas：</span><br>
You confuse me. What is the point of "cleaning things up" for them if you're planning to add real weapons?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Purity：</span><br>
Heheh! These aren't for the adventurers. They're to protect the central hub.<br>
We don't want something going WAY wrong and destroying the transporter before the others get here. That'd be catastrophic.<br>
Plus, it's a good bluff. Having a bunch of defensive weapons around helps keep them from wandering in before they get the keycard.<br>
Make it look scary as hell, and there isn't an idiot in the world who would make this their first destination.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Kala Ideas：</span><br>
Hrmmm... I doubt it will have the intended effect.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Purity：</span><br>
Say what?! You're not saying this stuff wouldn't scare them, are you? Then... Fine! I'm doubling the firepower!<br>
I was kind enough to leave instructions for them. If they wanna break the rules and try to break into the final destination...<br>
Then let's see if they can make it through Purity's super-strong, no-holds-barred fortifications! Aaahahahah!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Kala Ideas：</span><br>
You're starting to sound like a villain now.<br>
<br>
Mirror Sea Ruins - Land of Beginnings<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Shimakaze：</span><br>
Okay, so we found our third key. But, uh... We still don't know where the "Desolate Capital" is, do we? How will we find the last one?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Alfredo Oriani：</span><br>
I've been meaning to ask about that. Do we actually need to follow the monument word for word?<br>
If "breaching the towering barrier" means opening some kind of door, then that means we can open three out of four doors now, yeah? That just leaves one.<br>
And if the Mirror Sea belongs to the Sirens, why do we have to be nice and use a key for every single door? I bet we could blow that last one away with cannon fire.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Bristol：</span><br>
Ooh, good idea! We've got added firepower in the form of Ryza, Patricia, Serri, and Lila's riggings, after all!<br>
With these forces, we could give those Sirens a real walloping!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">ReisalinStout：</span><br>
True... Our search has hit a dead end. Why not try brute force once in a while, right?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Klaudia Valentz：</span><br>
Are you sure about this, Ryza?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">ReisalinStout：</span><br>
Don't you worry, Klaudia. Even if we run into strong enemies, I know we can win if we just work together!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Patricia Abelheim：</span><br>
She's right. I happen to be in just the mood to use my newly-obtained power, so I would appreciate a strong foe right about now.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Formidable：</span><br>
You have my approval as well. It irks me to be toyed with by Sirens. I say it's high time we mount our own offensive.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Suruga：</span><br>
(Do we have the numbers to attack the Sirens' central hub head-on? I have my doubts.)<br>
(But it's not like the battles so far have been really hard... Maybe we shouldn't assume this Mirror Sea follows the rules of common sense.)<br>
(Forget that. Everyone's ready and raring to go! Let's ride this momentum and give it a shot!)<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Shimakaze：</span><br>
What's wrong, Suruga? Something on your mind?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Suruga：</span><br>
You could say that... But we don't have any other leads. I will take the vanguard; let us investigate the Siren island to the north!<br>

Mirror Sea Ruins - Near the Central Foundation<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Formidable：</span><br>
Everyone, be careful. My recon plane was immediately shot down after it flew through the barrier up ahead.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Suruga：</span><br>
It sounds safe to assume they have automated defenses that intercept anything or anyone that comes close enough.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">ReisalinStout：</span><br>
Hmm...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Shimakaze：</span><br>
Is there something the matter, Ryza?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">ReisalinStout：</span><br>
I'm thinking about the, well, "door" over there. It doesn't look like any old door you just open with a key, more like a big obstacle.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Shimakaze：</span><br>
We've come this far – I see no reason to worry about any barrier! All we need to do is circle around it.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Formidable：</span><br>
Miss Ryza, we will soon be in range of the Sirens' defences. Please keep your guard up.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">ReisalinStout：</span><br>
...Alright, I guess this is the only way! Let's get in there!<br>

<br>
KABOOOM!<br>
The girls launched an assault on the island, but hardly made any headway the in face of the Siren defenses.<br>
Even though their goal was within sight, they came under increasingly withering fire with each step they advanced.<br>
A sense of dread filled the air as they realized that they were up against a formation more dangerous than anything they had encountered before.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Bristol：</span><br>
What the heck IS this?! I haven't seen an encampment THIS heavily fortified since... ever!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Patricia Abelheim：</span><br>
Miss Formidable, Miss Ryza, let's retreat! It would be suicide to keep moving forward.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Alfredo Oriani：</span><br>
She's right. There's no way we'll make it through under fire THIS heavy.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">ReisalinStout：</span><br>
Yeah, I agree. Knowing when to back off is crucial to surviving an adventure!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Suruga：</span><br>
Formidable and I will cover the rear. Everyone else, keep shooting while you retreat, and don't let them see your back!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">ReisalinStout：</span><br>
Got it!<br>
<br>
Having successfully retreated, the girls returned to the Land of Beginnings.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Shimakaze：</span><br>
Phew... That was a pretty thrilling attack, wasn't it? Right, Suruga?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Suruga：</span><br>
Guess so. But don't be so reckless last time!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Shimakaze：</span><br>
Agreed! I shall make that my motto. By the way, are you alright? You look pretty pale...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Suruga：</span><br>
Don't worry about me, I'm just tired. If anyone deserves a look at, it's Ryza and her friends.<br>
Let's not forget they're still learning to use their riggings, and they don't have the tools to repair them. If they sustain damage, they're in trouble.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Shimakaze：</span><br>
Will do!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Suruga：</span><br>
*sigh*... I'll have to find a remote place where I can patch myself up...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Lila Decyrus：</span><br>
So you WERE injured after all. Sent her away so you could lick your wounds in private, huh?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Suruga：</span><br>
Alright, you caught me. Yes, I got a little scratched up, but please keep it a secret from the others.<br>
It's nothing serious, and I don't want to make the others worried.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Lila Decyrus：</span><br>
My lips are sealed. But, don't forget that we're all in this together. There's nothing wrong with occasionally asking for help from your allies.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Suruga：</span><br>
Of course I know that. I've always tried to keep my head down as much as I can.<br>
It's just that... as the person with the greatest firepower here, I have to keep morale up. You understand how that feels, don't you?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Lila Decyrus：</span><br>
Hmm, I suspected you'd say as much. You have a true warrior's spirit. By the way, show me where you got hurt.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Suruga：</span><br>
Look, I'll be fine. Your rigging getting scratched up isn't the same as breaking an arm. I can patch myself up.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Lila Decyrus：</span><br>
Show me anyway. If I'm to survive our upcoming battles, knowing how to repair riggings is a skill I'm going to need.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Suruga：</span><br>
Well, if you insist... You can have my tools and try your hand at it.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Lila Decyrus：</span><br>
Thanks. Now, let's take a look.<br>

Under the Mirror Sea - In the past<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Purity：</span><br>
Ooh, I just got an idea!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Kala Ideas：</span><br>
Oho? What would that be?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Purity：</span><br>
So, the rational thing would be to put the core device in the Central Foundation control room, right?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Kala Ideas：</span><br>
I suppose so, yes.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Purity：</span><br>
Well, why allow yourself to be tied down by conventions when you can do something new, right? I'm considering leaving the device in this hole I just made. How's that sound?<br>
I could keep it on the southernmost part of these waters and this baby would still run just fine!<br>
Think about it. The place looks like a bunch of ruins from afar. Nobody would EVER guess that the core device was hidden here.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Kala Ideas：</span><br>
Going to the trouble of making a massive control center, only to subvert expectations by placing its beating heart elsewhere... Interesting.<br>
On the other hand, these undersea ruins are meant to be explored, no? They may stumble across the core by luck and destroy it before they know its significance.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Purity：</span><br>
Hrmm... You've got a point. The portal's as good as done if they destroy the core before making it to the Central Foundation.<br>
I could hide it better, but... Wait, I know! Building a dungeon here would solve everything!<br>
The thing about dungeons is, people always leave after scooping up all the loot. They'll never think to delve deeper than that.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Kala Ideas：</span><br>
Clever. Even you have your moments of brilliance.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Purity：</span><br>
Whaddya mean "moments?" I'm brilliant round the clock, thank you very much! Well, whatever... I'll build a dungeon, leave a map, and resurface our submarine so they can use it. And that's a wrap.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Kala Ideas：</span><br>
And how are we supposed to get back to the surface without the submarine?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Purity：</span><br>
Don't you worry, my rigging blows that submarine outta the water. You wanna do a bit of undersea surfing while we're at it?<br>
<br>
Land of Beginnings - Provisional Atelier<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Bristol：</span><br>
Hello? Do you read me? This is Investigator Bristol, reporting in from the south sector, over!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">ReisalinStout：</span><br>
This is HQ. I hear you loud and clear. Over!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Bristol：</span><br>
I've found an unmanned submarine in seemingly good condition. Approaching it now.<br>
I have reason to believe it could be a key item needed to explore this sector.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">ReisalinStout：</span><br>
Roger that! Proceed with caution. We're heading to you right now!<br>
<br>
South Sector - Inside the submarine<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Formidable：</span><br>
After a quick inspection, I can say that the submarine is fit for service. All the systems are in working order as well.<br>
Also, I found a map of the ocean floor's topography. It seems to suggest that there are ruins of a large structure straight down from here.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Bristol：</span><br>
My investigator's intuition was right all along! There IS a sunken city to the south!<br>
There should be a crater somewhere, too. Do you see one?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Formidable：</span><br>
I do not, I'm afraid. In fact, the topography suggests that the ruins were built right on the ocean floor.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Bristol：</span><br>
Hmm. That's another mystery for me to solve...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Formidable：</span><br>
Bristol, I really think it's high time you put your initial hypothesis to rest.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">ReisalinStout：</span><br>
So... we're gonna go inside this boat that goes underwater and explore some ruins. Did I get that right?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Formidable：</span><br>
Indeed. This submarine is our only option for exploration, as we have no submarine shipgirl among us, and our riggings aren't suited for diving.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">ReisalinStout：</span><br>
Oh, I see! Good that we have another option, since none of us brought any Air Drops.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Formidable：</span><br>
What are "Air Drops"?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">ReisalinStout：</span><br>
They're candies that let you breathe underwater.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Formidable：</span><br>
My word. Alchemy really is like magic.<br>

<br>
Mirror Sea Ruins - Desolate Capital<br>
The girls took the submarine deeper and deeper beneath the surface. Soon, a large cluster of ruins appeared in front of them.<br>
The submarine slowly cruised towards a place to anchor, seemingly following a predetermined route on autopilot.<br>
Upon reaching its destination, the submarine came to a stop and opened its hatch, revealing a passageway leading into the ruins.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Klaudia Valentz：</span><br>
It's astounding how well these ruins have resisted the seawater's corrosion.<br>
They look terribly weathered from the outside, but the interior is still in pristine condition. The Sirens ought to give up villainy and go into the construction business.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Patricia Abelheim：</span><br>
They certainly wouldn't have trouble finding clients when they can create marvels like this.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Klaudia Valentz：</span><br>
For sure. I'd love to have builders like them in my caravan.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Shimakaze：</span><br>
Suruga! I've found a map of the ruins!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Suruga：</span><br>
Oh, nice job! I have no idea how we'd even begin to explore this dungeon without one.<br>
This will make the search a lot quicker. Everyone, let's find all there is to find then get out of here.<br>
I'll make copies of the map and send them to you. Split up and look for the key!<br>

<br>
A while later...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Alfredo Oriani：</span><br>
Ugh, dammit! This map is completely worthless.<br>
Sure, it's detailed, but detail doesn't help when you can't tell what's what.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Bristol：</span><br>
Yeah... A two-dimensional map won't do you any good in a three-dimensional dungeon.<br>
Even when you know there's a connecting path, that knowledge is useless without knowing what floor it's on or how to get there in the first place!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Shimakaze：</span><br>
*pant* *pant*... Ugh... I can't feel my feet anymore...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">ReisalinStout：</span><br>
Ahahah... I had a feeling this would happen when I compared the map with the actual layout earlier. I hoped I was wrong...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Alfredo Oriani：</span><br>
Oh, I know! Formidable, can I catch a ride on one of your aircraft?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">ReisalinStout：</span><br>
Wait, what? Shipgirls can ride aircraft?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Formidable：</span><br>
Please tell me you're joking, Alfredo. We cannot mount aircraft. Surely you already knew that?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Alfredo Oriani：</span><br>
Obviously I know that, but I'm talking about using something to suspend myself from the plane. It could carry me, no problem, right?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Formidable：</span><br>
Give me some planes made from unobtainium and I'm sure they'd be durable enough to hold your weight.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Alfredo Oriani：</span><br>
In other words, you'll do it if I can find that whatever-that-is?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Formidable：</span><br>
That's... not what I meant. What I'm saying is, you really should consider more practical alternatives.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Alfredo Oriani：</span><br>
Hey, Ryza! Think you could synthesize a really, really tough rope?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">ReisalinStout：</span><br>
Hmm... With the right materials, probably!<br>
{{折叠面板|内容结束}}

{{折叠面板|标题=Aerial Operation|选项=20|主框=1|样式=primary|展开=是}}
<br>
Another while later...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">ReisalinStout：</span><br>
Voila! This rope should be tough enough to keep you suspended under a plane.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Alfredo Oriani：</span><br>
Sweet! Everything's ready for me to take off!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Bristol：</span><br>
I wanna fly too!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Shimakaze：</span><br>
As do I! Please let me come along!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Suruga：</span><br>
Not so fast, Shimakaze! Ryza, this is more than a little crazy. Are you sure this will work?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">ReisalinStout：</span><br>
I'm pretty sure, at least. There's only one way to find out, though.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Patricia Abelheim：</span><br>
...I think I'll stay on the ground, personally.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Lila Decyrus：</span><br>
Likewise. The daredevils can try if they want.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Klaudia Valentz：</span><br>
Could I try it too, Ryza?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">ReisalinStout：</span><br>
Oh, you interested?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Formidable：</span><br>
I'm afraid you can't, Miss Klaudia. You won't be able to withstand the strong air pressure without a rigging.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Klaudia Valentz：</span><br>
I see... That's unfortunate. What about you, Ryza?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">ReisalinStout：</span><br>
I, uh... Ahahah, I think I'll leave the flying to the risk-takers.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Alfredo Oriani：</span><br>
Okay then! Hit it, Formidable!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Bristol：</span><br>
Let's take this investigation to the skies!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Formidable：</span><br>
*sigh*... Alright, I'll do a slow takeoff. Please don't do anything reckless, like firing your cannons from the air.<br>

<br>
傍晚时分，结束了水下迷宫探索的一行人带着满载而归的战利品返回了起始之地。<br>
获得道具：「遗迹之钥·失落之都」<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Alfredo Oriani：</span><br>
第四把钥匙，科洛蒂娅的舰装配方，还有大量各种各样的素材，真是大丰收~<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Bristol：</span><br>
有种决战前突然获得了大量补给品的感觉呢。<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Shimakaze：</span><br>
获得这么慷慨的收获，总感觉之后会有一场硬仗啊……<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Alfredo Oriani：</span><br>
是啊……现在钥匙都收集好了，剩下的就是去核心区了。<br>
希望明天去的时候，核心区的火力能稍微弱一点……<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">ReisalinStout：</span><br>
或许……收集完四把钥匙并不是谜题的全部……<br>
当时在进攻的路上我仔细观察了门，上面并没有能插入四把钥匙的地方。<br>
我觉得，也许应该是需要用四把钥匙再做出一个可以打开门的东西出来……<br>
我需要在工房里再思考一下，然后把科洛蒂娅的舰装也做出来。<br>
大家可以先去休息不用在这里陪我哦，今天也辛苦了~！<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Alfredo Oriani：</span><br>
好哦~那我们就先去休息一下，顺便准备晚餐！<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Shimakaze：</span><br>
呼呼呼，今晚就吃{namecode:175}阁下的储备好了，大家一起来一顿重樱风的料理！<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Patricia Abelheim：</span><br>
莱莎小姐也辛苦了，不知道科洛蒂娅小姐的舰装在完成后会是什么样子，真令人期待呢。<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">ReisalinStout：</span><br>
嗯~我马上就去做哦~<br>
<br>
一段时间后的海滩边——<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">ReisalinStout：</span><br>
科洛蒂娅，我做的舰装怎么样？有没有什么在意的地方？<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Klaudia Valentz：</span><br>
完全没问题！谢谢你能做的这么漂亮，就像精美的艺术品一样！<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">ReisalinStout：</span><br>
嘿嘿…多亏了大家一起找到配方和素材嘛。<br>
能写出配方的人也很厉害呢，居然能设计出这样兼顾美观与战斗力的装备。<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Klaudia Valentz：</span><br>
是啊……<br>
<br>
轰隆隆（飞机引擎声）——<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">ReisalinStout：</span><br>
这下，终于连科洛蒂娅也有舰装了。怎么样，我拜托可畏小姐把舰载机飞过来了哦，要不要试试？<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Klaudia Valentz：</span><br>
莱莎……！<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">ReisalinStout：</span><br>
反正之前看布里斯托尔和阿尔弗雷多玩得那么开心，我也按耐不住想试一试的冲动了。<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Klaudia Valentz：</span><br>
我也……我也想试一试！<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">ReisalinStout：</span><br>
了解~那就拜托你了哦，可畏小姐。<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Formidable：</span><br>
本次航班即将出航，请各位乘客系好安全带，在夕阳之中，尽情享受本次空中之旅吧——<br>

过去的片段————<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">净化亲：</span><br>
这个就是返回装置，通过这个装置后就能回到你来的地方了。<br>
回去之后，这里发生的事对于你来说就会像做了一场梦一样。<br>
在那边醒来之后，应该过不了一会就会像真正的梦一样彻底从记忆中消失吧。<br>
当然了，这个世界的物品你也是一个都带不回去的哦，也包括舰装。除非——<br>
你选择加入我！加入我，你就能保留新获得的力量——<br>
怎么样，收下这个象征反抗军成员的徽章，加入我净化亲的反抗组织，为破坏测试者的奇怪实验出一份力吧！<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Kala Ideas：</span><br>
虽然看似一场梦，也能像对待梦一样任其在记忆中消散——<br>
但这一切的原理，其实并不是梦吧？<br>
你们用某种方式劫持了妾身的意识，或者说……灵魂？也正因此，物质造物才无法由妾身被劫持的意识带回去是么？<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">净化亲：</span><br>
这个要解释起来就复杂了，而且这可是我们的核心技术，不能随随便便就向你透露~<br>
不过你要是加入我的话，特别破例告诉你也不是不可以哦？<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Kala Ideas：</span><br>
呼呼，虽然汝这个人还不错，不过妾身还有属于自己的使命，是时候让这场梦结束了。<br>
不过汝的那个徽章，妾身倒是挺有兴趣的。<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">净化亲：</span><br>
嗯？……感觉你话里有话啊。就算是净化亲也没办法通过这扇门让你把徽章带回去哦？<br>
不过只是有兴趣留下些许旅途的痕迹的话……我倒是有一个办法能让你不会忘得那么彻底。<br>
也许在某日的梦境中能再次完整回想起来也说不定？这个方案你觉得怎么样~<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Kala Ideas：</span><br>
留存在回忆中的宝物么……那就如此办吧。<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">净化亲：</span><br>
了解~<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Kala Ideas：</span><br>
还有一件事，汝之前提到的关于两个世界时间不同步的事，是真的么？<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">净化亲：</span><br>
是哦。虽然你在这边呆了好几天了，不过等你回去之后，时间大概会和你来之前没什么变化哦？<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Kala Ideas：</span><br>
真是奇妙……<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">净化亲：</span><br>
那我还有别的事要做，你也急着回去，我们就在此分别吧。你先请？<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Kala Ideas：</span><br>
不用，倘若汝有事在身，先走就是。妾身在回去之前还想四处逛一下。<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">净化亲：</span><br>
行行~反正门已经启动了，操作指令我也刻在底座上了，你走的时候对着看就行，很简单的哦。<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Kala Ideas：</span><br>
嗯，那就在这里告别吧。希望汝能够一路顺风，今后继续按照汝之目标，坚定地走下去。<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">净化亲：</span><br>
……我不太擅长正式的告别啊。那就……你也一样！也许后会有期也许后会无期，拜拜——<br>
<br>
遗迹群岛·起始之地 翌日<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Formidable：</span><br>
莱莎小姐，钥匙的制作怎么样了？<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">ReisalinStout：</span><br>
哼哼，我已经制作完成了哦。你们看~<br>
<br>
获得道具：「遗迹之钥·核心之所」<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Formidable：</span><br>
这个是…………一张门卡？<br>
居然是用之前的那四把钥匙制作出来的么……？<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">ReisalinStout：</span><br>
嗯！我那天的观察肯定没错，用这个的话绝对能打开核心区的那扇大门！<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Formidable：</span><br>
虽然这几天看了不少莱莎的炼金术，但不论看多少次都还是感觉不可思议啊……<br>
既然关键道具已经制作完毕，那我一会就通知大家出发。<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">ReisalinStout：</span><br>
可畏小姐，等攻略了核心之所后，我们就要离开这里了吧。<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Formidable：</span><br>
至少碑文上是这么写的，虽然不知道会不会这么顺利就是了。<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">ReisalinStout：</span><br>
所以这就是在这座临时炼金工房里的最后一次调合了吗……稍微有点感伤。<br>
这口奇怪的黑色炼金锅其实还蛮好用的，以后就再也用不了啊……<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Formidable：</span><br>
如果舍不得的话，你直接带走不就好了？<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">ReisalinStout：</span><br>
这口锅实在是太重了……就算现在能依靠舰装把它抬起来，也不能带着它去战斗嘛……<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Formidable：</span><br>
咳……看来莱莎还没有太熟悉舰装的便利之处啊。<br>
虽然经过检查，你利用炼金术配方制作的舰装与我们所使用的在内部结构上有些区别，少了很多非战斗用功能。<br>
不过货仓似乎还是存在的。只是一个大锅而已，利用货仓就可以很轻松的把它一起带走哦？<br>
比如像这样——<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">ReisalinStout：</span><br>
舰、舰装居然还能这么使用么……？……好……好神奇，就像次元口袋一样。<br>
说起来……之前大家开茶会时吃的东西，还有量产舰什么的，是不是也是之前存在这个里面的？<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Formidable：</span><br>
没错，舰装可不光只有作为武器的功能哦。<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">ReisalinStout：</span><br>
太厉害了……有了这么神奇的存储空间，以后出门冒险想携带多少素材都没问题了！<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Formidable：</span><br>
那就首先收好炼金锅，然后不带留恋地向前方进发吧。<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">ReisalinStout：</span><br>
嗯，就这样！让我们向着最后的未知之地进发吧！<br>

<br>
The girls inserted the keycard into a device on the barrier's door, causing all Siren defenses in the area to halt operation. On the other side, a long path across the surface of the water revealed itself.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Shimakaze：</span><br>
Phew... I'm glad that worked. This should be a cakewalk from here on♪<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Suruga：</span><br>
Don't take that for granted. Even if their mind-blowingly strong defenses shut down, I guarantee you there's a Siren hiding in ambush somewhere.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Bristol：</span><br>
They'll know we breached the barrier any second now, so we should seize this opportunity while we can!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Suruga：</span><br>
Agreed. Let's hurry and find the control device and dispel this Mirror Sea.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Bristol：</span><br>
No! I was talking about finding all the hidden treasure chests before the Sirens catch on to us!<br>
Think about it. This is the most important place we've been yet, 'cause it's the heart of their base.<br>
So there's GOT to be treasure somewhere around here! The clock is ticking, so let's focus on finding some hidden branching paths!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Alfredo Oriani：</span><br>
Hoho! Our brilliant investigator here's got the right idea.<br>
There's only one way forward, but I can see a bunch of big buildings in the distance. There's bound to be stuff to find there, so I second what Bristol said!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">ReisalinStout：</span><br>
We've made it this far, and we may never come back to this place again, so...<br>
Yeah, let's keep exploring to the very end! Treat every adventure like it's your last!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Suruga：</span><br>
I mean... I suppose there aren't many Mirror Seas as fun as this one.<br>
We're all in this together, and if you want to go exploring, then I guess we could take a brief detour.<br>
(Even though we're fricking guaranteed to run into an ambush precisely by going on a detour! Ugh!)<br>

<br>
KABOOOM!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Shimakaze：</span><br>
Alfredo, I've discovered a branching path! Unfortunately... there's nothing here either, except for enemies!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Alfredo Oriani：</span><br>
Dammit! Did they actually store all their treasure everywhere BUT here?<br>
Navigating a confusing maze isn't rewarding in the slightest when all you get are enemy encounters!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Bristol：</span><br>
The final dungeon being nothing but a monster mash is such a letdown...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Suruga：</span><br>
(Maybe this place used to be a factory where they made weapons and mass-produced ships, ergo it wasn't meant as a dungeon...)<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">ReisalinStout：</span><br>
Hmm... Considering what we've found so far, I'm pretty sure all paths just lead to enemies. I'd say it's time to turn back.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Formidable：</span><br>
My word! Look out, everyone! Something big is descending from the sky!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Alfredo Oriani：</span><br>
Oh boy, more enemies? I've had enough already.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Serri Glaus：</span><br>
...This one looks a lot stronger than the rest.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Klaudia Valentz：</span><br>
Wings and white armor... Wait, is that the Legendary Monarch of the Philuscha?!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Patricia Abelheim：</span><br>
It even has a Siren supercannon and massive claws... It has become even more fearsome than the first time we fought it.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Formidable：</span><br>
In other words, it's a Siren creation based on data they read on the leader of all Philuscha.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Alfredo Oriani：</span><br>
So that's the guardian of this place. I think it's safe to say THIS is our final boss!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Lila Decyrus：</span><br>
Don't mess around with that thing. Its aura is unlike anything we've fought so far.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">ReisalinStout：</span><br>
Oh shoot, it's coming straight for us! Ready, everyone?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Alfredo Oriani：</span><br>
Already?! I don't even get to say anything cool before the fight!<br>

<br>
SHREEEE!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Bristol：</span><br>
It's down! We beat it!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Patricia Abelheim：</span><br>
Whew... That was a tough fight. The transformation partway through really gave me a shock.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Lila Decyrus：</span><br>
That was by far the strongest opponent we've fought here.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Formidable：</span><br>
We've become quite the coordinated team, haven't we, Miss Ryza?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">ReisalinStout：</span><br>
Heheh, you betcha! That's what happens when you adventure together!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Shimakaze：</span><br>
Oh! There's a teleporter up ahead! I think that's how we'll send you home!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Suruga：</span><br>
Probably, yes, if our past experiences are anything to go on.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">ReisalinStout：</span><br>
One final hurdle, then we can go home...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Shimakaze：</span><br>
Conveniently, someone wrote down instructions for how to operate it! I will boot it up right away!<br>
...What? That didn't work?<br>
Let me try again, just to make sure...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Patricia Abelheim：</span><br>
I had a feeling it wouldn't be so easy. Do you think it's broken?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Shimakaze：</span><br>
Whaaaaat?! Broken? Does that mean all our hard work was all for nothing?!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Klaudia Valentz：</span><br>
We were just one step away...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">ReisalinStout：</span><br>
When you're only one step away from the finish line, take that step! I've handled plenty of ancient relics before, so let me take a look at that!<br>
I see... I think I can fix this, but I'll need a lot more information about the Sirens and their tech.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Formidable：</span><br>
If that's all you need, you could come back with us to our port. You'll find all the information on the Sirens you could ever want in our archives.<br>
Now that the Mirror Sea's guardian has been defeated, our communications with the port have been restored. We'll at least be able to leave this place.<br>
You shouldn't have to worry about the gateway disappearing either. Even after the Mirror Sea is lifted, the physical facilities should still remain since we never destroyed the control device.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">ReisalinStout：</span><br>
Really? You're inviting me back to your port? I've been wanting to check it out ever since Alfredo mentioned it!<br>
Are you sure it's okay for us to just drop in unannounced though?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Formidable：</span><br>
I'm more than sure. In fact, I can promise you that our friends will welcome you with open arms.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Alfredo Oriani：</span><br>
I'm sure our local technical geniuses like Ingraham, Akashi, and da Vinci will be happy to help, too! The teleporter will be good as new in no time.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">ReisalinStout：</span><br>
Wow. Sounds like you've got some great friends back at port.<br>
...Girls, what do you think?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Lila Decyrus：</span><br>
Everything happens for a reason. A stay at a friendly port could be nice.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Patricia Abelheim：</span><br>
It's also the only way we'll get back home, so I support the idea.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Serri Glaus：</span><br>
I may learn something important by seeing what plants grow there, so...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Klaudia Valentz：</span><br>
Heehee. I'm fine with postponing our goodbyes for a while.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">ReisalinStout：</span><br>
So it's unanimous. Alright, we're going on yet another adventure, this time to Azur Lane's home port!<br>
<br>
<br>
"And so, the story of the archipelago of secrets draws to an end."<br>
<br>
"But, our adventure across this new land has only just begun."<br>
<br>
"What things will we experience, and who will we meet at the port?"<br>
<br>
"There's only one way to find out... and I can't wait!"<br>

Mirror Sea - In the past<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Purity：</span><br>
Hum-dee-dum~♫ Dum-du-duuum~♫ Mm-hmmm~♫<br>
A good final area needs traps, crazy gimmicks, and of course, a super-strong guardian!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Kala Ideas：</span><br>
For all the noise you made about making this place safe, these ruins are anything but.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Purity：</span><br>
You hafta raise the difficulty at some point, or else winning won't feel good at all!<br>
It's fiiiine, just trust me. I'll leave riggings behind for them, just like the kind I made for you.<br>
They can use their new power to the fullest and enjoy an action-packed ruin-scavenging adventure to their hearts' content!<br>
As for how to get the stuff into their hands... Oh, I know! I'll just reference the so-called "Alchemy" thingy I saw in the database!<br>
How 'bout we split the riggings into several parts, turn the blueprint into an alchemy recipe, and hide everything throughout the ruins?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Kala Ideas：</span><br>
Hrmmm... But these riggings don't seem like something that can be made through alchemy, do they?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Purity：</span><br>
I thought you believed that nothing is impossible with alchemy!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Kala Ideas：</span><br>
Hm? Are you that well-versed in alchemy already?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Purity：</span><br>
Heehee! Creating a rigging takes more than a Wisdom Cube – you need special supplementary items, too, so they're quite similar in a sense.<br>
I'll just make it look like a cauldron so nobody can tell the difference... Mweheheh...<br>
Once I'm done, I'll need you to divide the recipe and materials for five people's worth of riggings, then find places to hide them.<br>
After all... What's an adventure without treasure?<br>
