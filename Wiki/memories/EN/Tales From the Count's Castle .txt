Tales From the Count's Castle<br>
<br>
1 The Castle's Beckoning<br>
Port - Office<br>
It was a slow day. There was strangely little work on my plate and I had more free time than I knew what to do with.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Prinz Eugen：</span><br>
Can I come in, Commander?<br>
<br>
The door handle turned, and into my office stepped Prinz Eugen.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Prinz Eugen：</span><br>
What's with that look? You think I'm here to ask for some laborious favor?<br>
<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项1："I'm bracing for exactly that."</span>'''''<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项2："You're not going to?"</span>'''''<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Prinz Eugen：</span><br>
You're only half-right. It's sort of a favor, but it's nothing laborious.<br>
<br>
"I've got work today. Maybe not much, but I can't just put it on the backburner."<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Prinz Eugen：</span><br>
But, compared to your average workday, you've got plenty of free time. Your secretary told me.<br>
<br>
"Guess you've got me there."<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Prinz Eugen：</span><br>
First of all, relax. I won't bite. I'm only here to invite you to test out the escape room Akashi's been working on. Free of charge.<br>
<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项1："You mean, 'invite me to be a guinea pig'?"</span>'''''<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项2："Akashi? Free? There's got to be a catch."</span>'''''<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Prinz Eugen：</span><br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项1）</span>'''''Think of it this way: you could spend the day alone in your office, doing paperwork... OR, you could get out and do something fun.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Prinz Eugen：</span><br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项2）</span>'''''I had to do a double-take as well. The only catch is that you give her your feedback afterwards.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Prinz Eugen：</span><br>
So, what do you say? An opportunity to have fun like this only comes once in a blue moon.<br>
<br>
Port - Undisclosed location<br>
Seydlitz came over, put a blindfold over my eyes, and led me to the escape room.<br>
The set hasn't been completed just yet, and the blindfold was to prevent being spoiled on some solutions. Allegedly.<br>
Based on the time it took to get here, I sensed this escape room was a lot, lot bigger than I anticipated.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Seydlitz：</span><br>
We have arrived, Commandant. I'll remove your blindfold now.<br>
<br>
The set was designed after a lavish medieval castle.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Seydlitz：</span><br>
What is it, Commandant? Is there something in this room that makes you feel uncomfortable?<br>
The lighting here is quite dim for the sake of atmosphere, and I can see why it might induce anxiety in some people. Are you all right? Good...<br>
Now then, allow me to give you an introduction to this escape room.<br>
<br>
Seydlitz explained that this was a castle filled with vampires, and I was a lone human who'd wandered inside.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Seydlitz：</span><br>
Ordinarily, this location would start with a vampire chase segment. Since this is a demo, however, we changed it into a tutorial to ease you into your role.<br>
Here, please take this. It's a communicator Eugen provided me with.<br>
If you happen to get stuck, or run into... danger... please use it to call for help.<br>
<br>
"Danger? What kind of danger?"<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Seydlitz：</span><br>
I'm afraid I don't know, I'm only relaying Eugen's message. She also asked me to tell you, "Keep going until the end. Don't give up."<br>
That should be all. If you'll excuse me, I must go and get into my costume.<br>
All the shipgirls you'll encounter here, me included, will be playing a role. Please keep that in mind and try to play along.<br>
Best of luck to you, Commandant! I hope you'll have an enjoyable time!<br>
<br>
Armed with information and a communicator, I began my foray into the castle...<br>

Tales From the Count's Castle<br>
<br>
2 The First Trial<br>
I entered a big hall, after which the doors shut behind me with a creak.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">???：</span><br>
Heeheehee...<br>
<br>
A girly giggle echoed forth from the darkness.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Yorck：</span><br>
That smell about you... You're not one of us.<br>
<br>
Rows of candles along the walls lit up one after another, illuminating the staircase up to the second floor, where pallid girls sat upon grand thrones.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Emden：</span><br>
Welcome to our abode, my lost, darling human.<br>
"Most would reel in fear at the sight of Emden, but not you. Eager to become my next meal, hmm?"<br>
<br>
They had a menacing aura about them, like that of a video game final boss. I'd walked into the wrong neighborhood...<br>
Sensing I'd messed up, I dialed a number on my communicator. No response.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Yorck：</span><br>
What an interesting plaything you have. Whatever its intended purpose, it will not help you in here.<br>
<br>
It seemed they were as committed to their roles as I was committed to seeing the escape room to its conclusion.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Emden：</span><br>
"Emden isn't terribly hungry, but you'll do as a means to relieve boredom."<br>
You're in luck, poor little human. Emden would like to play a little game. What say you?<br>
<br>
I walked up to Emden's throne, expecting something like a chessboard... It was a stone tablet set up for a game of tic-tac-toe.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Emden：</span><br>
This is all we've had, and will have, to kill time for an eternity.<br>
Emden has never won a single game, nor ever lost a single game.<br>
Breaking this curse and resolving Emden's eternal grievance may grant you the key to escaping this place.<br>
<br>
"You're saying you'll let me go if I manage to beat you? All right."<br>
I knew, however, that normal tic-tac-toe always ends in a draw. There had to be some trick I was allowed to use.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Yorck：</span><br>
Are you ready to begin, human?<br>
<br>
If this was the only way out, so be it. I sat down and began the match.<br>

<br>
3 Neverending Stalemate<br>
To nobody's surprise, the game ended in a draw.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Yorck：</span><br>
Nothing has changed, it would seem.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Emden：</span><br>
Alas, so not even you can break the eternal curse within this tablet.<br>
Drinking every drop of blood you have to offer may quench our thirst, but it does naught to dispel our grievance.<br>
"I've changed my mind, human. Submit to Emden and become our pet. You will be granted eternal life and experience boundless pleasure as our pet."<br>
You may instead try one more time if you wish, my darling human. But, if you fail, I'm afraid your last moments shall be spent atop a dinner plate.<br>
"The choice is obvious. Now make it."<br>
<br>
To give up, or press on. The pressure was mounting on me. I answered...<br>
<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项1：Submit to Emden</span>'''''<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项2：Challenge Emden to a second match</span>'''''<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Yorck：</span><br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项1）</span>'''''So you chose submission. Humans really are deplorably weak.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Emden：</span><br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项1）</span>'''''Be that as it may, it's what Emden was hoping for. Come hither, our darling pet♡<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项1）</span>'''''"Your induction into the family comes later. For now, just rest your head on Emden's chest and be whisked away to sleep♥"<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项1）</span>'''''"Be not afraid." Have no worries. It will feel like no more than a brief nap.<br>
<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项1）</span>'''''Emden's soft whispers were like anesthesia. I felt my mind slip away... into... a slumber...<br>
<br>
Bad Ending – Emden's Eternal Vassal<br>
<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项1）</span>'''''When I woke up, both Emden and Yorck were nowhere to be seen. The stone tablet was gone, replaced by a ruby necklace.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Prinz Eugen：</span><br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项1）</span>'''''You jumped straight into that bad ending... Oh well, since this is a demo, we'll let you keep playing.<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项1）</span>'''''That item – the Cursed Blood Necklace – is your prize for... "beating" this trial. Take it with you.<br>
<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项1）</span>'''''Eugen's voice echoed through the hall. It wasn't coming from the communicator, but rather somewhere in here.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Prinz Eugen：</span><br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项1）</span>'''''The path to the next trial's open. Good luck, little human~<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Emden：</span><br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项2）</span>'''''"You have some damn nerve, filthy human."<br>
<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项2）</span>'''''Emden's tone took a drastic turn after I asked for a second match.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Emden：</span><br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项2）</span>'''''Are you certain, my dear human? This is your last chance to break the curse.<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项2）</span>'''''Should you not present a satisfying solution, Emden shall – with no exaggeration – devour you.<br>
<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项2）</span>'''''Emden only said I have to change the outcome of the match, not that I have to win.<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项2）</span>'''''I reasoned that was the key to lifting the curse...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Yorck：</span><br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项2）</span>'''''The match is over... Emden is the victor.<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项2）</span>'''''Fascinating. You knew you could not win, so you conceded victory.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Emden：</span><br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项2）</span>'''''Congratulations, my darling human. You've dispelled the curse of perpetual draws.<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项2）</span>'''''As Emden promised, you shall be granted passage through this place.<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项2）</span>'''''"Yorck, hand the human its prize."<br>
<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项2）</span>'''''Yorck stepped up and handed me a necklace adorned with a ruby.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Yorck：</span><br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项2）</span>'''''This relic is the Cursed Blood Necklace. Remember its name, for it will surely be of use.<br>
<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项2）</span>'''''The doors to my front gave way to a corridor. It seemed I'd passed the first trial.<br>

<br>
4 The Second Trial<br>
After solving a series of small puzzles, the path opened to a second big hall.<br>
Door after door after door lined the walls. At the hall's center was... Elbing and U-47, lying on the floor.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Elbing：</span><br>
Commander? Is that really you? Goodness, I can't believe you've made it this far.<br>
Though, I shouldn't be. I expected you'd get stuck on the puzzles and succumb to Emden's temptation, so of course the opposite happened...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">U-47：</span><br>
(Psst. You're out of character.)<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Elbing：</span><br>
(Oops, sorry...)<br>
Human, you stand before the successor of a dark bloodline. This... is my servant.<br>
My clan owns this castle, but Emden and her crones have us trapped here. They put a curse upon me, depriving me of all my strength...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">U-47：</span><br>
These doors you see are an illusion of their making. Choose the wrong one, and you are doomed to wander through darkness for all eternity.<br>
My master could easily dispel their trickery, had she her strength. Help her regain it, and you too shall be able to move forward.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Elbing：</span><br>
There you have it. Will you aid me?<br>
Eek...! Wh-why the sudden princess carry?!<br>
<br>
"It must be cold, lying on the floor. Let's at least get you seated on this couch."<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Elbing：</span><br>
Ahem... You have my gratitude, human.<br>
Umm... Resting to regain my strength is an option, but 'tis a terribly slow process. Emden is bound to catch on to us...<br>
For a hasty recovery, I require... a meal.<br>
(Y-you're bound to think I'm talking about blood... Surely you'll be frightened by me and t-try to flee instead...)<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">U-47：</span><br>
...Human blood will not suffice. My master requires sustenance that overrides the effects of the strength-sapping curse.<br>
<br>
Food that can neutralize a curse... I decided to look around the hall for something that might fit that description.<br>

<br>
5 The Crossroads of Faith<br>
After searching every nook and cranny, all I managed to find was a water cooler disguised as a statue and some paper cups.<br>
That was it. No food a vampire might eat, not even a red-colored beverage.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Elbing：</span><br>
(The Commander's never going to guess it's that cursed thing...)<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">U-47：</span><br>
(Shh! Also, it's time to say the line.)<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Elbing：</span><br>
(Oops! Right, sorry.)<br>
Time is nearly out, human. Emden and her underlings draw near. I can sense it...<br>
<br>
Nobody had told me there was a time limit. I had to make a choice, and quick...<br>
<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项1：Go through one of the doors</span>'''''<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项2：Think about what Elbing said</span>'''''<br>
<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项1）</span>'''''"I've wasted enough time on this riddle. It's time for the all or nothing option!"<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项1）</span>'''''The door led into a long, dark, cramped corridor. Following it brought me to a big crossroads, but all the paths only led back to the same dark corridor.<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项1）</span>'''''It wasn't long before I lost sight of which way I even came from.<br>
<br>
Bad Ending – The Door to Darkness<br>
<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项1）</span>'''''I'd gotten myself hopelessly lost. I shouldn't have left it up to chance...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">???：</span><br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项1）</span>'''''Psst, over here.<br>
<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项1）</span>'''''A familiar voice rang out amid the darkness.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Prinz Eugen：</span><br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项1）</span>'''''Behind you, Commander.<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项1）</span>'''''Seems you panicked and made a poor decision.<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项1）</span>'''''This corridor is rigged, you see. All the doors in the hall lead to a bad ending if you don't solve the riddle first.<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项1）</span>'''''Follow the sound of my voice. Oh, and take this small cross.<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项1）</span>'''''It's your prize for getting through this trial. It'll be useful later.<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项1）</span>'''''You're cleared to go to the last trial. Enjoy~<br>
<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项2）</span>'''''"A strength-sapping curse... Sustenance that overrides it... So a curse is again the crux of the problem here."<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项2）</span>'''''"Something to do with curses, then... I suppose there's the Cursed Blood Necklace I got."<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项2）</span>'''''"That's not food, though... Wait a minute. Cursed blood... Maybe the ruby is the answer?"<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项2）</span>'''''"I mean, this can't be a real ruby to begin with. Let's see here..."<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项2）</span>'''''I extracted the ruby from the necklace to inspect it more closely. It had a label on the underside that reads "strawberry soda."<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Elbing：</span><br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项2）</span>'''''(Thank goodness... The Commander figured it out just as I voiced my doubts!)<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项2）</span>'''''Now take that and dissolve it in water. Yeah, like that.<br>
<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项2）</span>'''''I put the "ruby" in a cup of water, waited a minute, and gave the finished strawberry soda to Elbing.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Elbing：</span><br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项2）</span>'''''You've helped me regain my strength, human. O, moon shrouded in darkness, heed my call and show the way forward!<br>
<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项2）</span>'''''Elbing stiffly recited a chant, and one by one, the doors in the hall closed until only one remained open.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Elbing：</span><br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项2）</span>'''''This is the correct path.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">U-47：</span><br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项2）</span>'''''Human, take this. The crones used it to inhibit my master's powers, though now it is beyond useless. You may have it.<br>
<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项2）</span>'''''U-47 walked up and gave me a small metal cross.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Elbing：</span><br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项2）</span>'''''(Whew... I hope everything from this point on will go smooth– Wait, I mean, terribly and end in failure for the Commander! Yeah, that should do it!)<br>

<br>
6 You Never Expect Them<br>
A short walk later, I arrived in the third hall.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Lützow：</span><br>
Ah, the human's here. Your little escapade has well and truly messed this whole castle up.<br>
Then again, I don't really care one way or the other because I want to get outta this place too.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Thüringen：</span><br>
The princess is obsessed with the outside world, but she's forbidden to leave, you see. The bedlam you've caused today serves as her getaway opportunity.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Lützow：</span><br>
So let's set our differences aside. What matters is that we share the same goal.<br>
You don't know the way out, do you? Well, I do, heehee. Follow me.<br>
<br>
I followed Lützow and Thüringen through the great hall.<br>
It was quiet. Too quiet...<br>
FWOMP!<br>
Without any warning, Lützow wrapped her arms around me.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Lützow：</span><br>
Ugghhh... I'm already beat just trying to keep pace with you. You've gotta give me some of your juice, or we'll never make it out.<br>
All I need is a little. C'mon, let me have a taste, human~<br>
<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项1：Stop struggling</span>'''''<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项2：Brandish the cross at her</span>'''''<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Lützow：</span><br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项1）</span>'''''Aha! There we go! Don't mind if I have a bite♪<br>
<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项1）</span>'''''Lützow sank her teeth into my neck. She drew gulp after gulp of blood, until eventually, I collapsed...<br>
<br>
Bad Ending – Sucked Dry<br>
<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项1）</span>'''''...Is what it felt like. While she didn't pierce my skin, she did leave a small mark.<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项1）</span>'''''Frankly, I wasn't expecting her to bite me at all.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Lützow：</span><br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项1）</span>'''''Oooh... You taste interesting, Commander... I'll remember that.<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项1）</span>'''''Why the shocked look? I was just following the script. See? "The vampire princess struck while the human was stunned."<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Thüringen：</span><br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项1）</span>'''''Under normal circumstances, this would spell game over for you. Luckily, you get to continue.<br>
<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项2）</span>'''''Right as I sensed Lützow was going to bite me, I took out my cross and pointed it at her.<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项2）</span>'''''Instantly, the two vampires froze in place as though they'd turned to stone. It seemed my quick thinking had saved my skin.<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项2）</span>'''''...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Lützow：</span><br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项2）</span>'''''Mrrghhh...<br>
<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项2）</span>'''''Key word: seemed. Lützow then leaned on me with all her weight, effectively locking me in place...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Thüringen：</span><br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项2）</span>'''''Lützow! You're going off-script. Release the Commander and act like the cross is repelling you.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Lützow：</span><br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项2）</span>'''''But why? I've caught the Commander. No point letting our prisoner go. Right, Commander?<br>
<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项2）</span>'''''Apparently the problem was with the staff, not the script.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Thüringen：</span><br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项2）</span>'''''Very well. I won't terminate the game immediately, but I will report this to Eugen. She'll decide whether or not you'll be replaced.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Lützow：</span><br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项2）</span>'''''Hrmph. Fiiine... Nooo, not the croooss, what will I dooo.<br>
<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项2）</span>'''''Lützow cried out in a very monotone voice and backed off from me.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Lützow：</span><br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项2）</span>'''''You're clever, human... So be it. I'll have to bear with my thirst and keep guiding you.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Lützow：</span><br>
Here we are. Just keep going down this long-ass corridor and you'll be out of the woods.<br>
(Little does the Commander know there's another puzzle coming in hot right abooout... now!)<br>
<br>
FWOOOOSH!<br>
Someone threw a smoke grenade at us from the other end of the corridor.<br>
Through the veil of the smoke, I could just barely make out two people – Seydlitz and Sheffield.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Seydlitz：</span><br>
Halt! You're going nowhere!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Thüringen：</span><br>
Vampire hunters?! They must've snuck in amid the chaos. Dammit... This is about to get ugly.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Seydlitz：</span><br>
You vampires and your filthy vassal shall face divine judgment! Choose a god and pray!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Sheffield：</span><br>
I'm afraid this is the end for you.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Thüringen：</span><br>
Vassal? So you think the human is our vassal because we brought it with us?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Lützow：</span><br>
Whatever, we can just skedaddle outta here. Try to catch us if you can.<br>
Exit's right over there. Come on, human... or should I say, my vassal! Better start running!<br>

7 Escaping the Castle<br>
We ran for our lives through the smoke from their grenades, and despite our best efforts, we were unable to reach the exit.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Sheffield：</span><br>
Would you vampires and this vermin of a vassal please stop struggling and let me tie you up?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Lützow：</span><br>
Hahahah! Gotta say, that was pretty fun!<br>
<br>
As we were being tied up, a number of swinging axes suddenly descended from the ceiling and chopped the corridor up into pieces.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Lützow：</span><br>
Excuse me, what? The script didn't mention this!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Thüringen：</span><br>
Eugen and Akashi just installed these, so it's no wonder you don't know about them.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Lützow：</span><br>
Hrmph! How come nobody told me about–<br>
Eeeeeeek.<br>
<br>
Lützow dropped down a pitfall that abruptly opened right beneath her. She let out an astonishingly flat scream.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Thüringen：</span><br>
Rest assured, she's fine. There are plenty of cushions to soften her impact down there.<br>
Now, the script dictates that it's my time to go. Beware of the traps on the floor... Ooooh nooooo.<br>
<br>
Thüringen, also, dropped down a pitfall.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Seydlitz：</span><br>
There's only the vassal left! Prepare to meet your maker!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Sheffield：</span><br>
You are vermin and will be dealt with as such. You may try to flee, but how fast can you run?<br>
<br>
Escaping these two would be extremely hard. I could only really think of two options...<br>
<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项1：Run to the hills, run for your life</span>'''''<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项2：Count prime numbers and calm down</span>'''''<br>
<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项1）</span>'''''These two have style, grace, and fervor... but the one thing they lack is speed.<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项1）</span>'''''The exit is right up ahead. If I just run, I can make it...!<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项1）</span>'''''...Where'd the floor go?<br>
<br>
Bad Ending – You Activated My Trap<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Seydlitz：</span><br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项1）</span>'''''Commandant! Look out!<br>
<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项1）</span>'''''Seydlitz closed the distance at breakneck speed, grabbed hold of me, and fell down the pitfall with me.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Seydlitz：</span><br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项1）</span>'''''...Commandant, are you all right?!<br>
<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项1）</span>'''''"Thanks for saving me by making sure I landed on the cushions. Although you couldn't save me from losing the game right before the finish line..."<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Seydlitz：</span><br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项1）</span>'''''I'm afraid I couldn't, no. My condolences.<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项1）</span>'''''Well, there's little else to do now but take the stairs back to the corridor. I will escort you to the exit from there, as per Eugen's instructions.<br>
<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项2）</span>'''''Acting without thinking is never the way to go. It will only make things worse.<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项2）</span>'''''Staring at the pitfalls, I noticed they opened and shut at regular intervals. I could make it safely out if I just timed my steps.<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项2）</span>'''''So I did. I made careful progress, paying close attention to the floor below me.<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项2）</span>'''''Seydlit and Sheffield were gaining on me, but it didn't matter – the exit was just steps away!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Sheffield：</span><br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项2）</span>'''''A little more...!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Seydlitz：</span><br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项2）</span>'''''Incredible, Commandant! You remain calm even in the most tense of situations!<br>
<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项2）</span>'''''I threw open the door at the end of the corridor. On the other side of it was the port I knew and loved.<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项2）</span>'''''I'd finally made it out. My success was immediately celebrated with party poppers.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Akashi：</span><br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项2）</span>'''''You escaped the room, nya! Congratulations, nya!<br>
<br>
A few days later...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Akashi：</span><br>
Thanks for your input, nya. Now I know what's good and what could be improved, nya.<br>
Soon the finalized escape room will be open for the whole port to enjoy, nya.<br>
Wish I could ask about what – if any – bad endings you encountered, but oh well, nya...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Prinz Eugen：</span><br>
Hey now, that's a secret, remember?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Akashi：</span><br>
I know, I know, nya. Anyway, be sure to visit again after I've implemented everyone's feedback, nya.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Prinz Eugen：</span><br>
Seconded. We'd love to see you again. Be sure to bring your friends, 'kay?<br>
<br>
...All in all, it was an interesting escape room scenario filled with surprises.<br>
I already knew I'd come back another day with a number of friends in tow.<br>
