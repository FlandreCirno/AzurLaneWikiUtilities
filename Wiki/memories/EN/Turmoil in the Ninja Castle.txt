<br>
In a fantastic wonderland, there stood a grand and fantastical castle.<br>
This castle, ruled by one fantastical Lord Commander, guarded a fantastical treasure.<br>
It attracted all the world's avarice and greed, like a lighthouse for vessels in the dead of night, vied for by every man.<br>
However, a fantastical spell guarded this treasure, allowing none but the Lord Commander to approach it.<br>
Therefore, all the evil powers that covet this treasure decided to join forces.<br>
They performed a wicked ceremony that caused a fantastical earthquake, reducing the once prosperous land into a ruin.<br>
The grand castle and the protective spell alike, too, crumbled into pieces.<br>
With the treasure unguarded, those seeking to claim it for themselves descend upon the castle like an avalanche.<br>
Soon, this treasured land shall devolve into a battlefield.<br>
Luckily, there is still time before this happens.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Hanazuki：</span><br>
Lord Commander, please forgive my discourtesy, but there is an emergency!<br>
The barrier guarding your treasure collapsed in that tremendous earthquake, and fell ninjas seeking to thieve it have infiltrated the castle!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Harutsuki：</span><br>
W-worse yet, the youkai hitherto suppressed by the barrier have all broken out...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Suzutsuki ：</span><br>
The four areas of the castle – the buffer zone, the outer citadel, the eastern enclosure, and the inner citadel – have all sustained major damage! The buildings and defenses need immediate repair!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Shimakaze：</span><br>
Our communications with the outside have been severed! We are isolated, Milord!<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Hmm. I roughly understand the situation.<br>
But why are we being attacked BY ninjas? Isn't this story titled, "Ninja Castle"? As in, the castle OF the ninjas?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Hanazuki：</span><br>
Ahem! Please pay no mind to such trivial matters!<br>
W-we request your orders, Milord! What shall we do?<br>
<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项1：Tighten the defenses around the treasure.</span>'''''<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项2：Start by repairing the castle.</span>'''''<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项3：Change the story's name before we continue.</span>'''''<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Hanazuki：</span><br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项1）</span>'''''Yes, Milord! We shall repair the castle and guard the treasure!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Hanazuki：</span><br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项2）</span>'''''Yes, Milord! We shall repair the castle and guard the treasure!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Hanazuki：</span><br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项3）</span>'''''Yes, Mi– Wait, no! We need to repair the castle and guard the treasure!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Hanazuki：</span><br>
I suggest that we begin repairs with the buffer zone!<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Why can't we start with the inner citadel?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Harutsuki：</span><br>
Because... the story progression will fall apart then.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Oh, okay. In that case – you're in charge of the repair work.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Hanazuki：</span><br>
Understood, Milord!<br>
Suzutsuki, see to the repairs of all our stations and defensive structures. We must restore the castle to operation and prevent further infiltrations.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Suzutsuki ：</span><br>
Roger! Pooky and I will do the best we can!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Hanazuki：</span><br>
Harutsuki, please reconstruct the barrier. We must get the youkai back under the seal.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Harutsuki：</span><br>
U-understood!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Hanazuki：</span><br>
Lastly, Shimakaze, when the time is ripe, send a request for assistance to our allies.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Shimakaze：</span><br>
Yes! Ready am I to move ahead at full speed!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Hanazuki：</span><br>
I've now issued all the orders, Milord. I shall continue gathering intelligence, and I will provide you with regular updates on the repairs!<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Alright. Let's get this show on the road.<br>

{{折叠面板|标题=Buffer Zone Repairs Complete|选项=2|主框=1|样式=primary|展开=是}}
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Hanazuki：</span><br>
Lord Commander, the buffer zone has been repaired. I shall now report on our current status.<br>
Under Suzutsuki's supervision, repairs were completed on the longhouses, the rice granary, and the reservoir.<br>
The food and water situation has eased up a lot, and everyone can finally get a good night's sleep.<br>
Harutsuki, meanwhile, discovered a way to reconstruct the barrier. I believe she'll soon make progress with it.<br>
Her magic circle has also managed to suppress the youkai in the buffer zone, putting the castle residents' hearts at peace.<br>
Furthermore, the ronin who answered your summons, Warspite, has been of service...<br>
She has set up guardhouses around the castle, and is working hard to restore peace and order.<br>
I think we're ready to refocus our manpower on the next stage of repairs.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
The outer citadel?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Hanazuki：</span><br>
Yes! Due to it being close to the epicenter, it has taken quite extensive damage.<br>
All manner of official documents are stored in the premises, and it's very likely they've already caught the eye of enemy ninjas.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Okay. Let's start on those repairs ASAP.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Hanazuki：</span><br>
Understood! I shall relay your orders!<br>
{{折叠面板|内容结束}}

{{折叠面板|标题=Outer Citadel Repairs Complete|选项=3|主框=1|样式=primary|展开=是}}
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Hanazuki：</span><br>
Following the buffer zone, the outer citadel's repairs are now complete. Inexperienced though I may be, I hope I've been of service to you, Milord.<br>
Allow me to brief you on the particulars!<br>
Firstly, about the protective barrier – Harutsuki has settled on a plan for reconstruction. It can commence as soon as the materials are in order.<br>
Unfortunately, we cannot do it while dealing with the youkai at the same time. A reliable helper is required.<br>
Also, I have some good news!<br>
That renowned instrumentalist – Brennus – has answered your invitation.<br>
Her music has greatly improved morale around the castle, and her first concert was already fully packed.<br>
Next, regarding the repairs Suzutsuki is in charge of – the ancillary tower, the training ground, and the inner citadel bridge have been restored.<br>
In addition, we've gathered much data from the ninjas you arrested.<br>
The infamous syndicate that they served – the Ninja Five – will likely interfere in various ways in our upcoming repair work.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
What should we do?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Hanazuki：</span><br>
The probability of unforeseen circumstances increases the longer we take. I propose that we first restore the barracks in the eastern enclosure, and strengthen our standing force within the castle.<br>
This will let us take action should the need arise, and seize the initiative.<br>
What do you think of this?<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
We'll focus on the eastern enclosure next. Do everything we can.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Hanazuki：</span><br>
Your will is my command, Milord!<br>
{{折叠面板|内容结束}}

{{折叠面板|标题=Eastern Enclosure Repairs Complete|选项=4|主框=1|样式=primary|展开=是}}
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Hanazuki：</span><br>
Milord, I come with a report on the eastern enclosure.<br>
Though it occupies less real estate, repairing it is by no means easier than it was for the last two zones.<br>
The damaged weapons in the barracks and armory alone were enough to give Suzutsuki a headache.<br>
But rest assured! The weapons have been tempered and polished to perfection. They've been restored to their former glory.<br>
There are developments in Harutsuki's reconstruction, as well. We have assembled the necessary materials for the barrier and can now focus on the actual repairs.<br>
I was initially worried that we were too short-handed to drive back the youkai threat, but fortunately, the situation has improved.<br>
Lady Laffey and her Legion of Bunnies have done a spectacular job of making up for our manpower shortage.<br>
Likewise, Gascogne's generous donations of repair supplies have alleviated our once-oppressive logistical burdens.<br>
Milord, I await further orders!<br>
<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项1：Repair the final zone!</span>'''''<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项2：What do YOU think we should do?</span>'''''<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项1）</span>'''''The time has come. Now's our chance to repair the inner citadel in one fell swoop.<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项1）</span>'''''Enemy ninjas will be desperate to turn the tide. Stay vigilant.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Hanazuki：</span><br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项1）</span>'''''Worry not. I'll handle every last detail!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Hanazuki：</span><br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项2）</span>'''''Under your capable command, we are fully prepared and united.<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项2）</span>'''''As a result, I believe we're able to focus our efforts on repairing the inner citadel.<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项2）</span>'''''Even should the enemy ninjas attempt a last stand, they're no match for us now.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项2）</span>'''''Perfect. Get to it right away.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Hanazuki：</span><br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项2）</span>'''''Yes, Milord!<br>

{{折叠面板|标题=Happily Ever After|选项=5|主框=1|样式=primary|展开=是}}
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Hanazuki：</span><br>
Lord Commander, the restoration of the inner citadel is complete!<br>
According to Suzutsuki, she has led a comprehensive effort to upgrade all facilities as they were being repaired in order to prevent any such mishaps in the future.<br>
Measures have also been taken to shelter us from the heat of summer and the chill of winter.<br>
No effort has been spared in making this castle a comfortable place for all seasons!<br>
Not to mention the extensive reinforcements we've made to the castle tower and other defensive facilities.<br>
Should another attack occur, we will be able to handle it with ease.<br>
There were, of course, some unexpected occurrences amidst the repairs...<br>
I mean the dastardly Ninja Five! They've been hiding in the shadows and trying to swipe our treasure.<br>
But you predicted this attack and foiled their plans in spectacular fashion. Most importantly, you kept everyone safe.<br>
The situation in the castle is stable now. Even the enemy intruders have sworn fealty to you, and the troublesome youkai have all surrendered.<br>
And I have more good news from Harutsuki. The barrier has been successfully reconstructed.<br>
However, it only obeys orders from the owner of the treasure – you, of course – so we must ask that you do the honors yourself.<br>
Please ascend the castle tower and let your glory shine upon the castle anew!<br>
<br>
Thus, the Lord Commander did ascend the tower.<br>
A pillar of light rose high into the sky and spread out as a translucent dome over the castle.<br>
The fantastical protective spell was restored, and the fantastical castle stood tall and proud once more.<br>
All conspiracies and evil schemes ended in failure, and a new era of peace began in this fantastical wonderland.<br>
Turmoil in the Ninja Castle - The End<br>

{{折叠面板|标题=Blooming Upon a Bewitching Night|选项=6|主框=1|样式=primary|展开=是}}
<br>
Sometime after repairs on the castle's longhouses were complete, rumors began spreading that an oni had appeared there.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
"A long-horned oni who feigns kindness to lost travelers at night, luring them in then dragging them into the shadows."<br>
I've got to test and see how much of it is true or not.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Asama：</span><br>
So it is for that reason that you've come, Milord.<br>
Donned in a black gown, Asama leans against the low table next to her.<br>
She gently plays with the wick of the flame beside her using her long nails. In the wavering light, her expression is lost to the shadows.<br>
You say you wish to grasp the truth behind the rumors...<br>
Your actions betray your carelessness, however – entering a dangerous place in the dead of night by one's lonesome can hardly be called rational.<br>
She speaks in a hushed tone, hiding her smile with her hand as she subtly leans closer. A sense of temptation undertones her voice.<br>
How ghastly it would be if the long-horned oni were no further than right behind you.<br>
As fortune would have it, you speak now not with any oni, but with the kindhearted lady of the longhouses. Heehee.<br>
So then, why is it that you appear unsettled?<br>
Ah... You must forgive my discourtesy. I've forgotten to serve you tea.<br>
Please partake of this tea, Milord, and let it warm and nourish you.<br>
To ease the hearts of lost travelers is, after all, the duty of the lady of the longhouses.<br>
The tea has a nice fragrance with a strange hint of sweetness.<br>
A wave of sleepiness overwhelms me, beguiled as I am by her graceful service and the tea she served.<br>
Heehee. Do you wish to set off to the land of dreams so soon, Milord?<br>
I know that you are always a busy person, so allow yourself a moment of peace, and just fall asleep by my side.<br>
May this night most deep be your eternal resting place.<br>
She removes her black garment like a breeze lifting the fog covering the truth, revealing the bare skin beneath that glows with an unhumanly white luster.<br>
Her shadow from the lamplight stretches and bends, and a pair of frightening horns begins to grow.<br>
Then, the next moment, it disperses.<br>
...Why didn't it work? Has my power... left me?<br>
Lord Commander of the fantastical castle... It seems that you came prepared.<br>
Never before have I been so completely and utterly suppressed...<br>
She leans down, and gently rubs the back of my hand with her cool cheek.<br>
In that case...<br>
I shall submit to you in earnest, and humbly serve you as my lord.<br>
My power shall be yours to wield and command.<br>
As your most faithful shadow, I will bring an end to your foes...<br>
Then, when you open your heart to me, unknowingly revealing your weakness...<br>
When that moment comes... Heheheh...<br>
Her voice, although as light as a whisper, conceals an unbearable hunger.<br>
That is when I shall help myself to your taste... and I shall savor it...<br>

{{折叠面板|标题=Onigiri Encounter|选项=7|主框=1|样式=primary|展开=是}}
<br>
After some emergency repairs, the last hole in the rice granary was finally patched up, bringing the castle's food situation back on track.<br>
Just as I'm about to shut the door to the granary, I hear a rustling sound.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Taekaze：</span><br>
Ugh... I'm sooo hungry...<br>
I disguised myself just to get in here, but I've not had a bite to eat...<br>
But now, that hunger's going bye-bye! Soon, all the food here will be mine, mine, mine!<br>
A young ninja girl pokes her face out from a tree, and she carefully scans her surroundings.<br>
Hey, what's that on the ground? Are those onigiri?<br>
Should've expected as much of the place that stocks the whole castle's food – there's even tasty treats just lying on the ground! Well, don't mind if I do!<br>
Huh? Why is there a rope around the– Whuaaahhh!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">{playername}：</span><br>
Caught myself a sneaky ninja. This onigiri trap is really effective.<br>
You'd be wise to confess what you came here for.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Taekaze：</span><br>
Dang! It was a trap!<br>
Ugh... Give up! I'm a seasoned kunoichi, and I'll never cave in under violence!<br>
Unless... *glances at the onigiri*<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">{playername}：</span><br>
You can have as many as you want if you tell the truth.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Taekaze：</span><br>
Okay, Lord Commander, I'll tell you everything!<br>
I'm just some small fry who got sent on the most exhausting and dangerous scouting mission ever. I'm not a bad guy, I promise!<br>
The Ninja Five set off before me, and they should've deeply infiltrated the castle by this point!<br>
If I were you, I'd watch my back, Lord Commander!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">{playername}：</span><br>
Come again? "The Ninja Five"?<br>
That means at least five infiltrators – or maybe even six or seven – are in our midst.<br>
I'll need to speed up the castle's repairs.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Taekaze：</span><br>
Now I've told you everything I know!<br>
If you won't let me eat these onigiri, I think... I think I might pass out from hunger!<br>
Huh? I can have them all? Om, nom!<br>
Shooo good! I hereby pledge my loyalty to you, wise and generous Lord Commander!<br>
And don't get the wrong idea – I'm no freeloader!<br>
The more I get to eat, the harder I'll work!<br>
So, whenever you need this ever-elusive kunoichi and master of disguise who comes and goes without a trace, I'll be there to answer your call!<br>

{{折叠面板|标题=Lakeside Lure|选项=8|主框=1|样式=primary|展开=是}}
<br>
After being dry for days, our reservoir was filled with clear water again, alleviating our concerns about the castle's water supply for the time being.<br>
However, I've heard rumors that the reservoir's supply is extremely irregular at certain times of day, so I've come to investigate.<br>
Just as I arrive, I hear a faint cry for help coming from the lakeside.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Oumi：</span><br>
Heeelp! Somebody heeelp!<br>
There is a girl stuck in a strange face-down pose with her hands tied. She seems to be on the brink of collapsing and falling into the water.<br>
I heard humans fall for this trick easily... It's a bit unorthodox, but it's worth a shot.<br>
...Oh, someone's actually showed up.<br>
*cough cough*! Somebody! Anybody!<br>
I've been ensnared by an evil youkai from the reservoir! Help meee!<br>
......<br>
Aahh, I can't swim! I'm so scared...<br>
......<br>
Hey, you – why are you just standing there and staring at me?<br>
Surely a heart as kind as yours wouldn't ignore a girl crying for help, would it?<br>
Or do you get your kicks from watching me flounder around helplessly?<br>
Alright, then in exchange for saving me...<br>
She slightly lifts her head. Wet tufts of long hair stick to her soft lips, making her look extra fragile and endearing.<br>
Won't you come closer? Or else I really will be in danger.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">{playername}：</span><br>
Honestly, your acting's pretty good.<br>
The knot gives it away, though. You tied it yourself, didn't you?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Oumi：</span><br>
What?! How... How can you tell?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">{playername}：</span><br>
I'm the lord of the castle. I know how a knot was tied from looking at it.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Oumi：</span><br>
Realizing that I've seen through her lie, the girl's arms slowly stop squirming, and she cracks a poorly-concealed, cunning smile.<br>
Heehee. So you won't be fooled...<br>
I was going to catch you off guard and strike when you got close.<br>
Such a shame you're forcing me to use direct, brutal means♪<br>
Crawling on her stomach, she approaches me, and then suddenly undoes the knot around her wrists.<br>
Although she leaps at me without a moment's hesitation, she halts right the next moment, as though stopped by some invisible force.<br>
Why?! I can't move... What did you do to me?!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">{playername}：</span><br>
Would you believe me if I said "nothing"?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Oumi：</span><br>
No, I get it now. You're known as the fantastical Lord Commander for a reason. Your fantastical power has completely suppressed me...<br>
*sigh*... You've literally immobilized me here...<br>
I guess this is what they mean by "you reap what you sow."<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">{playername}：</span><br>
You're the one who's responsible for the reservoir's irregularity, aren't you?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Oumi：</span><br>
Hey, now that's just slander. I'm merely an insignificant youkai who lives here.<br>
Even youkai have to drink water, you know. I don't wanna freak out passersby, so I only come out at certain times of the day.<br>
I'll stop attacking humans, okay? Just let me go.<br>
Hello? Cat got your tongue, Milord? Should I take your silence as a "yes"?<br>
Heehee, then I need to repay this kindness you've shown me...<br>
I still can't move, though, so...<br>
How about you come a little closer, hm? Don't be alarmed, just accept my gratitude♪<br>

{{折叠面板|标题=The Watermelon Ronin|选项=9|主框=1|样式=primary|展开=是}}
<br>
Shimakaze galloped in with a message from afar. It said that an outstanding ronin had responded to my invitation.<br>
There was a location stated in the message – an isolated bamboo grove – which I made my way to.<br>
Now, the further I head into the grove, the more cut bamboo I see around me. I can easily infer that someone has been honing their skills here.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Warspite：</span><br>
Whew. Good. That's half of my daily training done in– Who goes there?!<br>
Oh. Apologies. You must be the one I shall serve.<br>
I've been waiting for you here this whole time.<br>
The girl holding a bamboo sword has just finished a round of practice swings. Sweat drips from her forehead.<br>
Upon noticing me, she nods in affirmation and gives me a signal.<br>
I read your letter. You seek soldiers to protect your castle.<br>
I am Warspite, a ronin. I've heeded your call.<br>
Hm? What's with that look? You seem unsure of what to say.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">{playername}：</span><br>
Were you the one who cut down all these bamboo stalks?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Warspite：</span><br>
Naturally. A ronin must practice daily.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">{playername}：</span><br>
And you did it with that wooden sword?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Warspite：</span><br>
A task that requires no effort on my part.<br>
Any ronin who desires a lord must be this adept to even be worth consideration.<br>
Allow me to demonstrate. This is the way in which I will slay evildoers!<br>
As soon as she finishes speaking, a watermelon appears in the air before being magnificently split in two right before my eyes.<br>
Eat it. It's very sweet.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">{playername}：</span><br>
Huh. It IS sweet. This is some good watermelon.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Warspite：</span><br>
How do you evaluate my demonstration, hmm? Are you pleased?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">{playername}：</span><br>
Yeah. You're something else. I'd love to hire you.<br>
You'll be provided with three meals a day, your own residence, and weapons and armor. You may also use the castle's training grounds as much as you want.<br>
In exchange, I want you to help maintain order within the castle.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Warspite：</span><br>
Splendid. I will not disappoint you, Lord Commander!<br>

{{折叠面板|标题=The Shape of a Room|选项=10|主框=1|样式=primary|展开=是}}
<br>
A faint scent of tung oil still lingers in the ancillary tower, its interior graced by the beauty of fresh peach blossoms.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Unzen：</span><br>
Moving the half-open sliding door aside, I turn my gaze to the lacquered cabinet in the inner room that stores secret documents – and to the visitor I had anticipated.<br>
Oh dear... This is a chance encounter of the worst kind.<br>
I simply wished to take advantage of the darkness of the night to borrow some of your "books" for my amusement...<br>
You have my sincerest apologies for having disturbed your sweet dreams, Lord.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">{playername}：</span><br>
Not only that, you trespassed on the place where we store our important documents. Do you have any idea what the penalty is for that?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Unzen：</span><br>
I've just arrived from afar, so please forgive my ignorance. Henceforth, I shall do better.<br>
Unzen idly toys with the kunai at her waist, putting on a casual air to hide her inner vigilance.<br>
It seems that despite my intention of merely borrowing some books...<br>
I can scarcely hope to leave this small room unscathed.<br>
Using her slender fingers, she softly pushes a scroll filled with confidential information into the drawer. There's not a hint of hostility in her movements; she's as nonchalant as if she were brushing off a bit of dust.<br>
At the same time, she casts a glance behind me.<br>
There is but one way out of this small room, and I am completely blocking it.<br>
There is no need for us to make a scene in here.<br>
Look at this room – it is too narrow for acrobatics.<br>
I am not some rogue who would resort to a meaningless battle in such a constricting space.<br>
Please, let us calm down and speak like civilized people.<br>
Or would you rather claim your reward from this encounter in advance, my keen Lord?<br>
She presents her dainty wrist, her supple skin appearing as fair as moonlight.<br>
Then, before I can respond, her feet leap off the floor, and she closes the distance between us whilst revealing a rope she had hidden in her sleeve.<br>
I shall capture yo– Eek!<br>
Owch... It seems I carelessly hit the wall...<br>
I much underestimated how narrow this room is...<br>
Ahem. The victor has been decided, it appears. Well played.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">{playername}：</span><br>
...Did I even do anything?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Unzen：</span><br>
I, Unzen, of the Ninja Five, submit to you as your captive.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">{playername}：</span><br>
Oh... the Ninja Five again. Where are the rest?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Unzen：</span><br>
That, I do not know. It is unsophisticated to excessively concern oneself with others' actions.<br>
Why don't we remain here and do something a little more tasteful, Lord? It is a magnificent night, after all.<br>
She all of a sudden becomes completely relaxed. Her scattered silver hair mingles with the peach blossom petals strewn about.<br>
The rope she almost used on me has found its way around its owner's wrists, tying them up not too tightly.<br>
Mmh... The room seemed so narrow until a moment ago, but now, it seems to be just the right size.<br>
Then again, this rope... No matter whose body it ends up on, it's always sure to make for some fun.<br>
Heehee. You needn't be so vigilant, Lord. Come and sit beside me.<br>
It would be my pleasure to keep you company... for the rest of the night.<br>

<br>
Warm afternoon sunlight floods the training ground as cherry blossom petals float through the air.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Minase：</span><br>
Amidst this, I spot an unanticipated figure on a rooftop in the distance.<br>
*sniff sniff*... A scent I don't recognize. Must be a visitor.<br>
The figure on the roof is a girl lying on her back, swinging her furry tail around without a care in the world.<br>
Even ignoring the will-o'-the-wisps floating around her, her appearance makes it easy to guess what she really is.<br>
*yaaawn*... What a perfect place for a little afternoon nap.<br>
Oops, I almost forgot something important! Are you also here to train?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">{playername}：</span><br>
"Also" here to train?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Minase：</span><br>
Yeah! Basking in the sun in a place brimming with spiritual energy is the most effective way to train.<br>
She gives a contented stretch. There's no mistaking it – that's the look of someone enjoying an afternoon break.<br>
Just so you know, this place is mine. It took a lot of work finding a training ground as comfy as this!<br>
That said, I'm not an unreasonable youkai who refuses to hear people out.<br>
It's not completely out of the question if you really, reeeally want to train here.<br>
It so happens this little place is vacant.<br>
With a lazy sweep of her tail, she brushes aside the fallen petals on the rooftop, clearing a small spot for me next to her.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">{playername}：</span><br>
Training by basking in the sun, huh? Sounds novel.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Minase：</span><br>
Doesn't it sound enticing? Come here and try it out with me!<br>
I lie down next to the fox youkai, and we enjoy the sun together.<br>
Now, relax and start to meditate. Take deep breaths...<br>
Can you feel the spiritual energy along with the warmth?<br>
More obvious than any spiritual energy is the feeling of her fluffy tail grazing my body.<br>
Heehee... Can you feel your fatigue fading away as the spiritual energy fills you?<br>
This is my very own secret method to assist in training.<br>
Okay, now it's your turn to help me.<br>
The soft tip of her tail tickles my hand. She blinks at me mischievously.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">{playername}：</span><br>
Alright. Then we'll be even.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Minase：</span><br>
I gently run my fingers through her big, fluffy tail, going with the grain of the fur.<br>
Mmh... Hahh... Aahh!<br>
Ahh... Hahh... This is good...<br>
It feels like my body's filling with spiritual energy...<br>
This is the best training I've done yet...<br>
The comforting feeling makes the girl squint and curl up into a ball, and her tail unconsciously wraps around me.<br>
*yawn*... I'm getting sleepy...<br>
Resting is also a type of training, so why don't we sleep together?<br>
And so, the fox youkai and I spend a relaxing afternoon together.<br>

<br>
The castle's bridge has been repaired, restoring the connection between the inner citadel and the outside world, and bringing back some of the place's former life.<br>
As I stand atop the bridge and survey the water, I see the repairs being undertaken all across the castle.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
From Suzutsuki hauling materials for repairs around, to Shimakaze running to and fro while relaying messages, to the ninja running across the river...<br>
Wait, ninja running across the river?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Morrison：</span><br>
Just need to break this pillar to make the bridge collapse again...<br>
Come on, Morrison, you can do it...<br>
Earth hiding ninj– I mean water hiding ni– Ugh! I mean whirlwind of water!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">{playername}：</span><br>
Not so fast!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Morrison：</span><br>
Eek! I-I've been found!<br>
L-let me just make this clear up front: I didn't come here to destroy the bridge!<br>
It's to, um... make sure that the repairs went well.<br>
That's right, I'm checking for mistakes made during the repairs!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">{playername}：</span><br>
Checking for mistakes? Care to tell me who you are?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Morrison：</span><br>
Why, I'm... none other than the lord of the castle! Why else would I be here?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">{playername}：</span><br>
Then who am I?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Morrison：</span><br>
H-how would I know?<br>
I've got things I need to do, so if you'll excuse me...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">{playername}：</span><br>
Why are you running if you have no idea who I am?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Morrison：</span><br>
Because I... Ugh, you leave me with no choice. Now that it's come to this, I have to use my ultimate skill!<br>
Tr-transformation jutsu!<br>
A plume of smoke rises – but nothing else happens.<br>
What the... Wh-where's the illusion I set up?<br>
Where's this phantom Taekaze was talking about? The one that's meant to draw everyone's attention away from me instantly?<br>
Of all the times for my ninjutsu to fail...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">{playername}：</span><br>
If I were you, I'd surrender now.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Morrison：</span><br>
I'm... Morrison, one of the Ninja Five.<br>
I've failed in my mission... I surrender.<br>
I'm sorry, but this is about all the ninjutsu I can manage! Please don't throw me to the wayside...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">{playername}：</span><br>
Let's... not get ahead of ourselves. I never said I'd take you in.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Morrison：</span><br>
B-but I... I need a job...<br>
Please, Lord Commander! Please!<br>
I'll do anything as long as you let me work in your castle!<br>

<br>
The curtain of night falls, and a concert is about to wrap up.<br>
According to Shimakaze, our new ally has already entered the castle premises, and it's the performer up on the stage.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Brennus：</span><br>
......<br>
Under the moonlight shall we meet, and I shall follow fate's guidance...<br>
Bathed in the pure light of the solitary moon, Brennus wears a light purple Sakuran outfit. Her hair that flows down to her waist is adorned with an elaborate hairpin.<br>
Upon noticing me, she halts her hands in the midst of putting away her instrument, then looks at me directly, and extends an invitation with her gaze.<br>
Then, it's just me and her standing on the stage where her performance concluded.<br>
Milord, I hope my performance was to your liking.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">{playername}：</span><br>
It was amazing.<br>
Although... Somehow, I feel like you're not demonstrating your full ability.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Brennus：</span><br>
If you were left wanting more, then kindly allow me to perform one more song.<br>
For this song I crafted specifically with you in mind.<br>
Her slender fingers gently pluck the strings, leisurely producing a romantic melody.<br>
I feel drawn to the sound, as though I'm falling into a hazy illusory world woven by her song.<br>
The lights and shadows of the stage dissolve, and by the time I realize it, she and I are standing in the middle of a boundless lake.<br>
I've come here so that I may serve you, Milord.<br>
Can you feel the yearning I have for you in this song?<br>
Even if for just a moment, I wish to be with you...<br>
As she leans closer to me, I pick up on a faint, familiar fragrance.<br>
Her music still rings in my ears, expressing her hard-to-pin feelings. The shadows we cast under the moonlight overlap, eventually merging completely into one...<br>
Don't stop, Milord...<br>
From the moment our gazes first met, every instant in time we've shared has been etched into my heart...<br>
The way the moon's light dimly illuminates your profile, your each and every little movement...<br>
This meeting of ours here brings such fullness to my heart...<br>
Should you be willing to accept it, I would offer you all the tenderness of my earthly life.<br>
The final note ceases, and the silver moon and the lake both gently fade away.<br>
The only thing that remains is the air between us – so dense that we can sense each other's heartbeats through it.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">{playername}：</span><br>
What was that illusion?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Brennus：</span><br>
A secret to remain between us, Milord.<br>
Be not unassured. My powers are for you alone.<br>
Although a song must eventually end, feelings must not.<br>
If you'd grant my wish, please take my hand.<br>
Ah... How wondrously warm yours is.<br>
The joy invoked in my heart in this moment feels like a dream, so beautiful I can hardly tell what is real and what is not...<br>
Regardless, one who believes in fate ought to firmly seize this moment and respond.<br>
I've waited so, so long for this wish, for this fluttering.<br>
Please, join me in savoring this definite happiness in the present moment.<br>

<br>
Upon hearing the barracks had been repaired, I grabbed several jugs of fine alcohol and set out under the moonlight to join the celebration.<br>
On my way there, however, the moonlit path suddenly became shrouded in an unusually thick mist.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Alsace：</span><br>
This one is Alsace – the Sacramental Blade, the Unreachable Dream, the Arbitrator, and the Swordbearing Oni Protector of the Backwoods.<br>
One has awaited you here.<br>
A girl wearing a mask with oni horns balances herself on top of a rope.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">{playername}：</span><br>
That's a lot of titles... but there's only one of you.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Alsace：</span><br>
Of course. THIS one. Don't you think this one looks cool?<br>
Hmph. The woods have been under one's protection long, long before your kind set foot here.<br>
On the day that your castle was enveloped by that barrier, and its holy light obscured one's vision and sealed one's ears... one fell into a long slumber.<br>
However, now that the barrier has fallen, and one has awoken, all that remains is to fulfill one's duty.<br>
One's duty being: Testing the ruler of this land to determine if they have the resolve to protect it.<br>
Now, then, lord awaiting judgment, are you ready?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">{playername}：</span><br>
I dunno, are YOU ready to judge me?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Alsace：</span><br>
...Ready?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">{playername}：</span><br>
I mean, what form does your trial take? Do you have criteria in place? And once you make your judgment, how will you enforce it?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Alsace：</span><br>
Uh... The particulars are something one has yet to...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">{playername}：</span><br>
Oh, but you're Alsace – the Sacramental Blade, the Unreachable Dream, the Arbitrator, and the Swordbearing Oni Protector of the Backwoods. Surely you've figured out ALL the particulars?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Alsace：</span><br>
O-one is beginning to overheat...<br>
No, wait! One has it!<br>
Naturally, the trial will gauge your magnanimity and decisiveness, as well as determine how far you'll go to protect this land in– Hm?<br>
Those jugs... Are they filled with alcohol?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">{playername}：</span><br>
These things? I just brought them with me on a whim.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Alsace：</span><br>
What a fragrant aroma... *gulp*... Is that not the same wine I cellared hundreds of years ago?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">{playername}：</span><br>
Come on, that's hard to believe.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Alsace：</span><br>
Indeed... Hard to believe how delectable it is.<br>
*gulp*... *gulp*...<br>
Without even waiting for my permission, she takes the wine in hand and starts drinking.<br>
Bwuh... M-must carry out my duty before I get too drunk... Need to... deliver a verdict...<br>
You have managed this castle... stupendously...<br>
You did lose your barrier on account of a degree of carelessness, but even so...<br>
At heart... you're a good person...<br>
You... pass! I... This one deems you worthy!<br>
O-okay, I'm... My body temperature is rapidly increasing...<br>
Ugh... I can't bear it any longer...<br>
Milord, come and help me release this heat...♡<br>

<br>
After the repairs on the armory were complete, we set up numerous traps in important places as a measure against enemy attacks.<br>
To make sure I don't accidentally trigger them, I went to confirm their placements after they'd been set.<br>
Then, just as I was about to leave, I suddenly heard the swish sound of a string being swiftly pulled in a certain room, followed by a startled yelp.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">I-404：</span><br>
You there! You! Yes, the Good Samaritan!<br>
Could you come here real quick and let me down?<br>
The young ninja caught in the string trap dangles left and right, like a suspended pendulum.<br>
Haha, come on, don't be so wary!<br>
I'm not up to no good, promise! Would a baddie choose to make such a sublime entrance as I did?<br>
Despite being hung upside down, the girl maintains an upbeat attitude.<br>
Seriously, though, the traps in this place are out of this world.<br>
Finding a sublime stage like this is precisely what I worked so hard to become a kunoichi for.<br>
Ahaha – although I didn't get to display all the talents I've got...<br>
If I just got another chance, I'd avoid these traps like they were nothing!<br>
Hello? Why are you just staring without saying a word?<br>
They say meetings like this are fate, you know. All you have to do is let me down, then we can do something much bigger and sublimer!<br>
Wait, I think I recognize you... Didn't my mission directives have a picture of you...?<br>
A-aren't you... the lord of the castle?!<br>
Umm... Okay, forget everything I just said! Please? Pretty please forget it!<br>
I'm just a dancer who's a little lost right now. I heard there was a magnificent castle in the area and I've come to show you my art!<br>
I've not been up to anything bad, nope, not at all!<br>
I haven't destroyed any barriers... or conducted any sabotage... Nothing like that...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">{playername}：</span><br>
Are you one of the Ninja Five?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">I-404：</span><br>
Whuah?! You figured it out THAT fast?<br>
Okay, okay, I fess up to it! I'm I-404, the sublimest kunoichi in the world, and I surrender. There, I said it!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">{playername}：</span><br>
Before I decide whether to accept your surrender or not, I've got a question. What "something much bigger and sublimer" were you talking about a minute ago?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">I-404：</span><br>
I-I mean, that's a bit broad, isn't it?!<br>
I guess, for example... setting off the most dazzling fireworks display ever? Or sneaking in under the guards' noses and snatching their precious lord away...<br>
Wait, I've basically half-succeeded at the latter.<br>
Her lips curve into a sly smile, and she starts rocking her body in a light rhythm different from just a moment ago.<br>
That's right! It's just you and me right now!<br>
So, since the stage is set, why don't we dance, hm?<br>
I guarantee you'll have all the fun you want!<br>

<br>
While I'm busy dealing with our little youkai infestation, I receive good news from Shimakaze.<br>
The lady of the neighboring Castle of the Bunnies has answered our call and asked to meet me in the forest between our castles. This could be a huge boon.<br>
I arrive at the meeting point early. The scent of pine drifts through the forest.<br>
After a while, I encounter her in a very surprising way.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Laffey II：</span><br>
Zzzz... Zzzz...<br>
When I notice this forest path is unusually rabbit-filled, the herd suddenly stops in front of me.<br>
Upon the back of the lead bunny sleeps a small girl.<br>
*yawn*... Are we there already?<br>
The honorable Lady Laffey of the Castle of the Bunnies has heard your plea for aid...<br>
Don't worry... Laffey will help you take care of those pesky youkai...<br>
But... Hmm...<br>
Lord Commander, you look tired.<br>
You're gonna need a nap first...<br>
The Castle of the Bunnies has lots of pillows... All kinds of bedding, really...<br>
Wanna come back with Laffey first?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">{playername}：</span><br>
And just let youkai and random ninjas wreak havoc in my own?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Laffey II：</span><br>
Mmm... Yeah, that would suck. Okay, we'll come to your castle.<br>
But we still need that nap...<br>
Lord Commander, hop on the bunny.<br>
She raises her arms to stretch. Then, she helps me climb onto this comically oversized rabbit.<br>
Mm... That's better. Bunny guard, maaarch!<br>
Laffey's going to sleep... Lord Commander, nap with me.<br>
Nap, and forget all your worries...<br>
Her soft breaths tickle my cheek, accompanied by a sweet scent.<br>
Zzzz...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">{playername}：</span><br>
Zzzz...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Laffey II：</span><br>
The cloud-like softness of the bunny's back sends us both to the land of dreams together.<br>

<br>
Shimakaze's call for aid did not fall on deaf ears.<br>
Gascogne, heiress to a noble family renowned for their efficiency, led a massive supply convoy to our castle.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Gascogne：</span><br>
She invited me on a stroll to hand over and discuss the supply list, but I can't help but think she has something else in mind.<br>
Shipment confirmed to include emergency repair materials, goods for sustaining life, and assorted building materials.<br>
Transport route optimization... Complete. This will ensure greater efficiency in future supply efforts.<br>
Master, I've finished tallying the supplies. Please confirm.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">{playername}：</span><br>
I see the list here says 3,000 iron arrowheads, but we received 7,000?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Gascogne：</span><br>
The excess was my treat.<br>
Further support is on the way, as well.<br>
As long as I'm here, you don't need to worry.<br>
After finishing the inventory, it's clear that things are looking up within the castle.<br>
The courtyard looks even more beautiful with such a weight lifted off my shoulders.<br>
A cool breeze blows, and maple leaves flutter down to the pond. Each one sends little ripples throughout the water.<br>
But Master, the purpose of my trip was not only to personally deliver these supplies.<br>
As she pauses, her calm gaze seems to pierce through my eyes and into my soul.<br>
Based on analysis of past events, you require not just supplies and a morale boost...<br>
...But also emotional support and companionship.<br>
<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项1：What makes you think that?</span>'''''<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项2：As in?</span>'''''<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Gascogne：</span><br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项1）</span>'''''Information about you exists in many places.<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项1）</span>'''''I just have a special interest in your feelings and desires.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Gascogne：</span><br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项2）</span>'''''I've been monitoring you closely for some time now.<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项2）</span>'''''If you have any requests, don't hesitate to ask. I'll personally see them fulfilled.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Gascogne：</span><br>
Physical supplies are merely a visible and portable medium.<br>
They're consumed, and they're replaced.<br>
However, the emotional intent and resulting desires behind their delivery and consumption are constant.<br>
I've pondered the exact nature of these desires for countless hours.<br>
In the end, my conclusion was simple.<br>
The answer is companionship. Not something temporary, but something to be maintained over the long term.<br>
Gascogne's words are simple and blunt.<br>
She slowly approaches and stops next to me.<br>
I will be at your side at all times, Master, wherever you may need me.<br>
Whether you order me to or not, I'll protect you and support you forever.<br>
Wherever you go, I ask that you take me with you.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">{playername}：</span><br>
Thank you. Your support means the world to me.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Gascogne：</span><br>
Feedback confirmed.<br>
Is this emotion that I'm experiencing... joy?<br>
It's very unique, but...<br>
I've confirmed that I'm in excellent condition.<br>
I want to know more about this feeling.<br>
Requesting input of your own joy, Master.<br>

<br>
After the restoration of the castle's main tower, my office is finally open again.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Sovetsky Soyuz：</span><br>
As I prepare for my own intense battle with a mountain of paperwork, a shadow stalks through my periphery.<br>
I follow the silhouette with my eyes and espy a woman in a tight black outfit. Her silver hair gleams in the moonlight.<br>
She seems to be drawing a map of the castle.<br>
Hmm. Some of these building positions and styles need to be revised.<br>
But I'm out of time.<br>
Your timing couldn't have been worse.<br>
She tucks her map away and leaps gracefully into the night sky.<br>
Instantly after, the chilly night wind cuts into me. Her icy eyes pierce through me like knives.<br>
But I'm glad to see that my intel was correct. You're usually so well-guarded, yet now you're all by yourself.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">{playername}：</span><br>
I don't want the other girls to be stuck working overtime with me.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Sovetsky Soyuz：</span><br>
How convenient for me.<br>
We have all the time in the world. Why don't you try guessing my plans?<br>
Will I flee with an unfinished map in hand? Or will I take a greater prize with me?<br>
Heehee, I think I'm leaning toward the latter.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">{playername}：</span><br>
Not a bad plan, sure, but you know what they say about the best-laid plans.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Sovetsky Soyuz：</span><br>
...You set up an ambush?<br>
Despite her surprised tone, the skilled ninja promptly leaps back out of reach.<br>
She surveys the empty balcony behind me, and then the quiet courtyard below.<br>
Then, her eyes turn back to me, as if she's trying to ascertain the truth of my claim.<br>
In that case, I'd best not keep you for too long.<br>
I will take my leave now.<br>
She dances over the vermilion railing and darts toward a nearby rooftop.<br>
I feign pursuit, using the opportunity to adjust my positioning.<br>
As expected, the fake chase doesn't last long. She quickly stops, and I can see her expression change in the distance.<br>
Well. So much for that.<br>
There isn't a rooftop archer or soldier waiting in ambush to be seen anywhere.<br>
You're the only person here.<br>
You were bluffing! What a bold lord you are... Heehee.<br>
Soyuz strokes the kunai tied to her thigh.<br>
She isn't the cautious prey anymore – she has become the hunter, eyes set on her target.<br>
What say we change the rules of this little game?<br>
I'll give you a few minutes to start running. How does that sound?<br>
Actually... No. This has already been more than enough fun.<br>
It's my turn to chase you now.<br>
<br>
Her curves stand out more in the moonlight, and her long silver hair ripples in the breeze.<br>
As I'm cornered in my dark room, the pursuit finally comes to an end.<br>
But just before I can be caught, I press an inconspicuous button on the wall.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Sovetsky Soyuz：</span><br>
After a soft click, a web of thread shoots forth, spreading out to ensnare her.<br>
Shock runs through her eyes, and she reflexively moves to evade.<br>
However, her attempt at evasion only takes her into the path of danger.<br>
Ngh... That thread of yours tore my clothes.<br>
So this trap only tears clothing, hindering your prey's movement without injuring them.<br>
Is that your twisted brand of mercy? Or did you contrive all of these events just to see this sight?<br>
Either way, I'm forced to admit defeat.<br>
Soyuz is stuck in a position where her legs are both bent and her head is nearly touching the floor. Her ninja outfit is ripped in several places.<br>
Her silver hair is splayed across the floor, twitching with every labored breath.<br>
However, even in this desperate predicament, she is unshaken.<br>
You brought my guard down with that bluff...<br>
...All as a means of drawing me into your trap.<br>
Even if it wasn't planned out from the start, your ability to adapt and outsmart your enemies has impressed me.<br>
So...<br>
Have you decided what you're going to do with me?<br>
If your mind isn't made up yet, then allow me to make a proposal.<br>
For example... I, one of the Ninja Five, may serve you in secret.<br>
You and I could manage this fantastical castle in its fantastical wonderland together – you in the limelight, and I in the shadows.<br>
No objections, I see... Heehee, I thought that was an attractive proposal.<br>
I trust that you'll make good use of my abilities.<br>
But before we leave...<br>
Can you help me find a... proper set of clothes? Preferably intact.<br>

Castle reconstruction efforts finally reach the castle court – what used to be my residence.<br>
I'm exhausted to the bone from consecutive days of overwork. Finally, I can sleep.<br>
After taking a bath, I lean over to blow out the candle. But then, I hear a loud crack from the direction of the window.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Guam：</span><br>
Aaahhhh! Owch...<br>
I stepped on a trap... Guess I should've expected that, in hindsight.<br>
Why'd someone set up a trap here of all places, though? They never think of just gazing out the window and enjoying the view?<br>
The dim moonlight illuminates the source of all the noise.<br>
A girl in a ninja outfit is stuck in the broken window frame. The trap set there makes it impossible for her to right herself.<br>
She's using her hands to maintain balance, but her long hair droops messily to the floor.<br>
"Infiltrating is one thing. Making it look like a dance... that comes naturally to me☆"<br>
See? I had a cool line ready and everything!<br>
But who the heck sets a trip wire in their window, of all places?!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">{playername}：</span><br>
I planned for everything. Window, door, roof, you name it.<br>
Frankly, you ninjas are kind of predictable.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Guam：</span><br>
Hah! Don't get so full of yourself just yet!<br>
To a member of the Ninja Five, a trap like this is... e-easy... easy stuff!<br>
She visibly exerts herself, trying to prop herself up with her arms to slip out of this predicament.<br>
But no matter how she wriggles and writhes, she remains stuck in the window. Losing balance only makes her slide down more, getting her more stuck in the process.<br>
*pant*... *pant*... I can't do it.<br>
My clothes got caught, too... My poor custom-made outfit is ruined! Gaaah!<br>
What are you looking at... Huh? My chest...? Ack! N-no looking!<br>
I'm no pro ninja or anything, but I can't tolerate such a blunder! Let's try this again, just one more...<br>
Nope. Not happening. Hehe, time to give up!<br>
I guess I can't get out alone. In this case...<br>
Oh, Milord, won't you PLEASE help me out of this little pickle?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">{playername}：</span><br>
Um. Do you surrender, then, or what?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Guam：</span><br>
That's right! My feet are getting kinda numb here...<br>
The beautiful Guam officially surrenders! Okay, now help me, please!<br>
I walk over to the window and stoop down to undo the trap. Suddenly, she grabs my wrist... and then leans over and clings to me.<br>
You underestimate me!<br>
I gotta make up for that embarrassing entrance somehow!<br>
Hehehe, what do you think I'm gonna do?<br>
Relax. I said I surrender, remember?<br>
Oh... You smell like you just got out of the bath. So that's why you're barely dressed!<br>
My sudden intrusion must have interrupted your alone time, huh...<br>
As an apology... let me help you get dressed properly!<br>
Don't you worry your pretty little head! No matter how demanding the mission, Kunoichi Guam always gets it done...<br>
Now, get ready to accept my SUPER sincere surrender!<br>

<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Hakuhou：</span><br>
My lord, your tea is cold. Allow me to get you a new one.<br>
You busy yourself with so much paperwork every day that you could use a nice aroma to refresh your mind. Keep me by your side, and I'll gladly serve you...<br>
My lord? My lord... My lord! You won't get rid of me that easily this time!<br>
As for where this clingy ninja came from, well, it all started after the restoration of the tea house.<br>
<br>
In this scenario, I had a secret tea house built in the castle tower to store my treasures safely.<br>
However, after the repairs, I was ambushed by Hakuhou when I went to check on said treasures.<br>
I managed to subdue her, leading to... this.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Hakuhou：</span><br>
I must tell you, my lord...<br>
Before I met you, what I sought were your exquisite silks and beautiful gems...<br>
But now, they pale in comparison to your pure radiance.<br>
I don't want these cold, lifeless objects anymore. No, I want to be your newest treasure.<br>
Hold me, my lord, with your gentle yet firm hands.<br>
...My lord? Are you listening?<br>
Why do you refuse to let me be yours? Is it because I was one of the Ninja Five?<br>
Her eyes redden slightly, as if she's about to cry.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">{playername}：</span><br>
...If I'm not mistaken, I already signed the order for your release.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Hakuhou：</span><br>
You MUST be mistaken.<br>
I'm an awful, awful woman who committed an awful crime. I took advantage of the youkai problem to sneak into your castle and attack you...<br>
I've been destined to be your prisoner ever since the moment I pointed my blade at you.<br>
It's my fate to serve you wholeheartedly forevermore.<br>
Also... that order you mentioned? Hmm... Oh! I remember it now.<br>
She cocks her head in thought for a moment and then flashes a sweet smile.<br>
When I burned that piece of paper, I meant to call for you to show you. But I forgot.<br>
Really, I couldn't believe that my lord would issue such a cruel order.<br>
If you really want to send me away that badly, then I will obey. But...<br>
As Hakuhou casts her eyes downward, a cold gleam is reflected in them. It's the gleam of the unsheathed sword by her side.<br>
Her slender fingertips trace the blade's tip, which quickly becomes dyed red.<br>
Upon seeing this, her lips stretch into a satisfied grin.<br>
Goodness, that hurts...<br>
Look, my lord. I seem to have hurt myself – how careless of me. Won't you please help make it better?<br>
<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项1：(Treat her wound.)</span>'''''<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项2：(Make her put the sword away first.)</span>'''''<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Hakuhou：</span><br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项1）</span>'''''Why, I've gotten dizzy... I'm not sure I can sit up straight.<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项1）</span>'''''Don't push me away, my lord... Just let me lean on you for a while.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Hakuhou：</span><br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项2）</span>'''''You don't want to see me get hurt again?<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项2）</span>'''''If that's how you feel, then you must be my rock, my dear lord.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Hakuhou：</span><br>
Please, keep me with you. Closer to you than anyone else...<br>
I'll be your most precious treasure of all.<br>
More beautiful and radiant than any gem, and all yours... Your own Hakuhou.<br>
