"Odd-Colored Seas - BLACK"<br>
<span style="color:#ff0000;">？？？：</span><br>
Oh my... what kind of signal is this?<br>
I'm detecting interference from beyond this dimension... Could this be an anomaly??<br>
<span style="color:#ff0000;">Tester α：</span><br>
I never thought there would be visitors from a different dimension other than us.<br>
Ehehe... unexpected things keep occurring one after another. How interesting.<br>
Is this also a demonstration of the myriad possibilities that the future holds? As an observer, this development piques my curiosity. Perhaps this shall serve as the next test specimen.<br>
However, I would prefer not to show my face just yet.<br>
<span style="color:#ff0000;">？？？：</span><br>
... ... ...<br>
... ... ...<br>
<span style="color:#ff0000;">Tester α：</span><br>
Ehehe... If I utilize the Mirror Seas, perhaps I can conduct a most interesting experiment.<br>
Now, what kind of fruit shall this experiment bear? I shall wait and see.<br>

<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Laffey：</span><br>
Finally home... can't take it anymore... going to sleep...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Javelin：</span><br>
Wait, Laffey, don't fall asleep just yet! The reconnaissance mission doesn't end until we're back in port!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Z23：</span><br>
Our original mission was just to scout the Mirror Sea. I didn't think we'd be found and have to fight. It's understandable to be tired.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Neptune：</span><br>
Ahhh... I can't do it! I had no idea fighting those full-powered CPU clones would be so tiring...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Laffey：</span><br>
The one that looked like Noire was so strong...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Javelin：</span><br>
Why would the enemy have someone who looks exactly like Noire in her CPU form?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Noire：</span><br>
... My apologies. Even though that wasn't me, it seems that whatever took on my form has caused trouble for everyone.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Javelin：</span><br>
Mhm... it's not Noire's fault. Surely it's the doing of the Mirror Sea...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Noire：</span><br>
Those attacks from the fake Black Heart are only possible when a CPU has full share power... I wonder if our data was somehow taken...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Neptune：</span><br>
It'll be fine! We managed to chase them off and all, so everything will be okay!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Noire：</span><br>
That's true... Even though those fakes indeed had our powers, they were like puppets that fought without knowledge or experience. They should be straightforward to defeat.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Neptune：</span><br>
Yup yup! As long as we work together, we can wrap this up!<br>
Well... without enough share power, we won't be of much help.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Blanc：</span><br>
... That's right... Perhaps this fatigue is also due to a lack of shares...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Vert：</span><br>
Because of that, we certainly had it rough as well.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Neptune：</span><br>
Nep?! Blanc and Vert? You guys are here too?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Blanc：</span><br>
Just the two of you don't instill a whole lot of confidence, so I decided to check in.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Vert：</span><br>
Histoire is currently investigating a way of getting home. There shouldn't be anything to worry about.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">{namecode:6}：</span><br>
We encountered them during another reconnaissance mission... so we brought them over.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Noire：</span><br>
Thank you, Ayanami. Did you also run into your own clones?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Blanc：</span><br>
Yes... With everyone's aid... we somehow managed to fight them back...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Vert：</span><br>
Frankly speaking, there's no way of utilizing our full power without shares.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">{namecode:6}：</span><br>
Come to think of it, Akashi was looking for Nep-Nep and the others.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">{namecode:98}：</span><br>
I've been listening, nya. It seems like the CPUs aren't able to wield their powers here, nya.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Z23：</span><br>
Akashi, did you find a solution?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">{namecode:98}：</span><br>
It's quite simple, nya. When in Rome, do as the Romans do. All we need to do is to equip you CPUs with your own ship rigging!<br>
This way, everyone can sortie together!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Neptune：</span><br>
Wooah! Shiny new equipment! Gimme Gimme!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Noire：</span><br>
To think that something like this could be done... Akashi, can we equip these right now?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">{namecode:98}：</span><br>
Hmm... I don't think I can make it tonight. Why don't you all get some rest, nya?<br>
Akashi will have it done by the morning. Look forward to it, nya!<br>

<br>
"Odd-Colored Seas - GREEN"<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">{namecode:98}：</span><br>
Here you have it... the fruits of Akashi's hard work last night, nya!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">{namecode:37}：</span><br>
pouts... Don't act like I didn't hear that. I helped with the technical stuff...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Neptune：</span><br>
Whew! Brand spankin' new equipment! And what's more - it's super epic and exclusive to us!<br>
Akashi, Yuubari, thank you very much. I'll be sure to treasure it!<br>
Wooahh! Badass! Is this a cannon? Ah this thing shoots torpedoes too! I can't wait to unload all these explosives into someone's face!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">{namecode:98}：</span><br>
Nya nya nya! Don't point those at other people!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Neptune：</span><br>
Sorry, sorry! I'll be more careful!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">{namecode:37}：</span><br>
Your ship rigging can be controlled freely with just your thoughts. As long as you don't space out, there shouldn't be any risk of misfiring... Woah, don't point those guns over here!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Noire：</span><br>
Mine seems to be different from Neptune's, with these main turrets. This one focuses on heavy firepower, doesn't it? The color also matches, not bad!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Blanc：</span><br>
This rigging fits my image nicely... it has a nice white theme. Looks like it focuses on launching torpedoes...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Vert：</span><br>
Are these carrier aircraft? And this rigging lets you launch them? What's more, these planes are adorable. It's a perfect fit for me!<br>
... Say, is it possible to make these planes into cute girls?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">{namecode:98}：</span><br>
There would be an additional charge, nya.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Noire：</span><br>
Vert, you're the same as ever, even over here.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Neptune：</span><br>
Then, then, can I turn my torpedoes into cute dolphins?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">{namecode:98}：</span><br>
You can purchase these exclusive equipment skin boxes. The pricing goes something like this...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Noire：</span><br>
Save that discussion for later! Our first priority should be to take care of those clones.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Neptune：</span><br>
In short, we can all fight together now! Onwards to the Mirror Sea!<br>
<span style="color:#ff0000;">Tester α：</span><br>
We don't quite understand the circumstances, but they have not been able to draw out their full power. There still appear to be possibilities that remain hidden from our understanding.<br>
Next, we must adapt to this dimension, and attain new power as well.<br>
Hehehe... Things have gotten more interesting than I originally imagined.<br>
I want to further witness the possibilities these girls contain... Let us observe them a bit longer...<br>

<br>
... Beep beep! Beep beep! Beep beep!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Z23：</span><br>
We've received communication signals on an unregistered frequency. This is...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Histoire：</span><br>
Ah... testing, testing. Everyone, can you hear me?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Neptune：</span><br>
Hmm... I can hear you, but can't see you. What are you, the air or something?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Histoire：</span><br>
Who are you calling air? It's me, Histoire!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Noire：</span><br>
Histoire, is that you? Does that mean you've managed to establish communication?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Histoire：</span><br>
Yes, I somehow managed to get through. I should be able to establish a way back to Gamindustri soon.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Blanc：</span><br>
...Then, we can go home soon?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Histoire：</span><br>
It's too difficult to do right now... I'm going to need quite a bit of time. Everyone, please wait a while longer.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Vert：</span><br>
Of course things wouldn't go that smoothly... and we still have to deal with the clones in this dimension. Looks like we will have our hands full for a while.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Histoire：</span><br>
Ah... so those things appeared after all? They may be related to this...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Noire：</span><br>
Histoire, do you know something about those fakes?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Histoire：</span><br>
Actually, your data was probably collected when you all passed through that wormhole.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Blanc：</span><br>
... and then someone used our data to make those clones?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Noire：</span><br>
It would appear that is the case.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Histoire：</span><br>
In any case, I will do my best to re-open the wormhole. Everyone, make sure to be careful.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Z23：</span><br>
We also heard the communication over here. It seems that we're getting closer to unveiling whoever is behind this incident.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">{namecode:6}：</span><br>
Surely... it's the work of the Sirens...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Javelin：</span><br>
So those fakes were made using the data of Nep Nep and her friends?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Noire：</span><br>
Sirens? I don't really get it, but they sure sound like an insidious bunch. But to think they could create a full-power CPU...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Laffey：</span><br>
Sirens... always cheat...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Neptune：</span><br>
Don't sweat it! There's no way we can lose. We'll definitely win!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">{namecode:6}：</span><br>
Ohh, what amazing, baseless confidence!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Blanc：</span><br>
... Don't take her too seriously. There's no proof.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Neptune：</span><br>
Aww, don't be a party pooper, Blanc. Has the real thing ever lost to the fake before? Since we're the real deal, there's no way we'd lose! Checkmate!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Noire：</span><br>
Neptune really is quite the optimistic genius.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Neptune：</span><br>
Eheh! Praise me more! Neppy here is a girl who grows with more praise!<br>

"Odd-Colored Seas - WHITE"<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Neptune：</span><br>
Stage 2 cleared, easy breezy! Looks like we'll have this situation under control in no time!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Histoire：</span><br>
On the contrary. As if things would be that simple.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Neptune：</span><br>
Nep?! It's Histy's voice!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Noire：</span><br>
It's too early to celebrate. Don't you still have something to do?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Z23：</span><br>
But didn't we already eliminate those clones from the Mirror Sea?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">{namecode:6}：</span><br>
That may be the case but... what if, that alone isn't enough?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Histoire：</span><br>
Mm, correct. We still need a lot more data.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Blanc：</span><br>
... Do we not have enough data on this part of the Mirror Sea?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Histoire：</span><br>
That's also a problem, but... in order to re-open the wormholes, we need to collect data from the CPU clones.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Vert：</span><br>
Perhaps that has something to do with Blanc and me coming here.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Histoire：</span><br>
That's correct. For the time being, please continue to investigate the Mirror Seas and suppress any CPU clones you encounter. Well then, until later.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Laffey：</span><br>
... She just says whatever she wants to say, and then cuts off the line...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Neptune：</span><br>
It's fine, it's fine! Histy's always like that.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Noire：</span><br>
She just drops the important details and then is all like "I'll leave the rest with you," before bouncing.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">{namecode:6}：</span><br>
... She's a bit like our commander.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Javelin：</span><br>
Mmhmm. After the fleet formation is set up, we just get a "do your best, everyone," or something like that.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Vert：</span><br>
Somehow, I feel like I'm also being roasted...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Blanc：</span><br>
... In any case, we've all got to do our best.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Noire：</span><br>
That's right. We have no other choice. Let's all get through this together.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Neptune：</span><br>
Yup! Before busting our butts though, gotta take a break!<br>
<span style="color:#ff0000;">Tester α：</span><br>
... It appears that someone from that other dimension is interfering as well.<br>
To think that they would be able to not only destroy the Firewall, but also investigate the existence of the Mirror Seas...<br>
... They are a force to be reckoned with, perhaps on the same level as us... No, maybe even greater?<br>
Hehe... Well then, let us determine just who the superior one is...<br>

<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Blanc：</span><br>
Hell yeah! This should be the last of these idiots!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Vert：</span><br>
Blanc sure is energetic... pummeling away at those clones even though they look just like her.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Blanc：</span><br>
Hmph... isn't that obvious? These frickin' clones are creepy as hell.<br>
We have to mop them up as fast as we can... Come to think of it, Vert, you didn't hold back against your clone either in the previous zone.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Vert：</span><br>
How do I put it... it's like hatred towards your relatives? My power kept welling up.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">{namecode:6}：</span><br>
Somehow... that makes a lot of sense.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Javelin：</span><br>
We've also been fighting off clones of ourselves here... Somehow, I'm not even sure if this is being caused by someone else...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Z23：</span><br>
There's too much we don't know about the Mirror Seas...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Blanc：</span><br>
It seems like this situation won't be resolved so easily...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Histoire：</span><br>
Good work, everyone. I've managed to gather some new data.<br>
However, it's not quite enough. Please collect a bit more data from the Mirror Seas.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Blanc：</span><br>
Huuh? You've gotta be kidding me. We've been at it for ages!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Histoire：</span><br>
Almost, I just need a little bit more! To put it concretely, around one stage's worth? I should be able to finish with that.<br>
There you have it. Thank you for your consideration, everyone.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Blanc：</span><br>
Ah! What the hell? Don't you dare disconnect just yet!<br>
You said to investigate the Mirror Space, but we've already 100%'d this zone! The hell are we supposed to do? Hey! Histoire! Damn it, respond!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Vert：</span><br>
Oh my, looks like we have no choice. We'll simply have to wait here elegantly until the next Mirror Space opens up.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Blanc：</span><br>
Good grief... You sure are calm though, Vert, for not being able to go home still.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Vert：</span><br>
Indeed... I'm not in any particular rush to get back home. (Squeeze!)<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Laffey：</span><br>
Eh...? Why is Vert hugging Laffey?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Z23：</span><br>
U-um... Vert, what kind of hug is this...?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Vert：</span><br>
There are so many cute girls here... Aaahh, I wouldn't mind being stuck here forever!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Blanc：</span><br>
... There it is again. You could call it Vert's mental illness... I don't even want to say anything.<br>

"Odd-Colored Seas - PURPLE"<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Neptune：</span><br>
... In the last episode, Histy threw Blanc and the others for a loop yesterday.<br>
And now in today's exciting installment - a new Mirror Sea has spawned!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Z23：</span><br>
For them to appear back-to-back like this... how unusual.<br>
This would probably be the first time this has happened, right?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Neptune：</span><br>
This is also an effect of my Protagonist Aura! Let's go mop up some quests and farm some rare ships!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Noire：</span><br>
Just what are you rambling about? Neptune, our priority is to investigate the Mirror Sea. The only things we should be mopping up are our clones, got it?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Neptune：</span><br>
Loosen up, Noire, I know~♪ After all, the commander here is sure to burn all their fuel farming this Mirror Sea. Right, Laffey?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Laffey：</span><br>
... Uh... huh...?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Z23：</span><br>
Wait, shouldn't you be taking the commander's side?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Javelin：</span><br>
Ah... our commander isn't like that... Though there are some who not only burn all their fuel, but also run everyone's morale into red...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">{namecode:6}：</span><br>
I can see a bleak future of overwork ahead of us... I'm asking to be paid for overtime...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Noire：</span><br>
Jeez, I'm surrounded by black-hearted people.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Neptune：</span><br>
Even though Noire has the most black heart here~<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Noire：</span><br>
The color just suits me well! I'm not black-hearted at all!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Vert：</span><br>
Now now, everyone, let's not be so serious. It'll ruin your cute faces. Let's lighten up, shall we?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Blanc：</span><br>
... Go home, Vert, you're drunk.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Vert：</span><br>
Don't wanna~ Being surrounded by all these cute girls... this is the heaven I wanted... ehehe... (Squeeze!)<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Javelin：</span><br>
Awawa?! Vert, what are you doing all of a sudden?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">{namecode:6}：</span><br>
Urk... so this is the strength... of a carrier's embrace...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Noire：</span><br>
Vert, you're just like Neptune. Whether in war or peace, you two never change.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Neptune：</span><br>
Come on, everyone. Let's all strengthen our teamwork and head out to the new Mirror Sea!<br>

<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Neptune：</span><br>
Stage 4 cleared flawlessly! The Neptune Crew is invincible wherever we go!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Noire：</span><br>
Just who are you calling the Neptune Crew? Don't just lump us in with your weird fantasies!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Blanc：</span><br>
... Is it finally over now?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Vert：</span><br>
If what Histoire said is correct, then this should be the last zone...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Histoire：</span><br>
Yes. Well done, everyone.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Neptune：</span><br>
Histy?!  Well then... is this really the last stage?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Histoire：</span><br>
Indeed, that is the case. The data from the Mirror Seas, and the data from your clones... I've managed to collect it all.<br>
With this, I will be able to re-open a wormhole connecting Gamindustri to this world. You will be able to return at any time.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Neptune：</span><br>
Woo hoo! Game cleared! Congratulations!!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Noire：</span><br>
That was quite troublesome, but at least it's over now.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Blanc：</span><br>
Phew... we can finally go home.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Vert：</span><br>
This was certainly quite the novel experience... But, it looks like it's time for us to go...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Laffey：</span><br>
Nep-Nep, do you all really have to go?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">{namecode:6}：</span><br>
You don't need to be in such a hurry... it's fine to stay at the academy a bit longer...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Noire：</span><br>
Sorry, everyone. As CPUs, we can't be away from Gamindustri for too long.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Neptune：</span><br>
Waaaah! Don't wanna, don't wanna, don't wanna! I'm not ready to leave yet! I want to stay here and play with everyone a bit longer! Let's change the departure date. Maybe three months out.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Blanc：</span><br>
Like hell we could stay for that long. I said we're going so we're going!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Z23：</span><br>
If you all are leaving, we'll also be a bit lonely...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Javelin：</span><br>
That's right! Shouldn't we at least rest for a day or three?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Vert：</span><br>
Indeed... I wouldn't mind staying with everyone a bit longer...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Noire：</span><br>
Vert, you're saying stuff like that too?! Histoire, tell them that we gotta get going!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Histoire：</span><br>
Yes, please come back as soon as possible.<br>
However, that being said, you are able to travel back to this dimension whenever you want, you know?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Neptune & Noire：</span><br>
......... Eh?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Blanc & Vert：</span><br>
......... Huh?<br>
<br>
──EHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH?!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Histoire：</span><br>
Because of the remarkable affinity between Gamindustri and this world, I am able to open the wormhole at any time.<br>
Therefore, it's "see you later," not "goodbye." If you wanted to come back tomorrow, you would be able to. As such, do not worry too much about not being able to see each other.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Neptune：</span><br>
Y-yaaay! We'll be able to be together forever!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Laffey：</span><br>
... Mm... Nep-Nep, come play with us every day, okay...?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Neptune：</span><br>
Mmhmm! I'll make sure to come every day!<br>

Hey! Don't be too shameless! You'll be a nuisance to the people in this world!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Z23：</span><br>
No, no, don't hesitate to come at any time. We'll always welcome you.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Vert：</span><br>
If that's the case, your big sister is going to come see you cuties every day!<br>

... Vert's really going end up stuck here, so it's best to not be too courteous to her.<br>

... Mm, I'll be waiting for everyone to come.<br>

... Then, let us continue...observing them...<br>
Patiently... ...<br>
