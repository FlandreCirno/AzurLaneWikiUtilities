Me and the Boise<br>
<br>
1.Mermaid?<br>
One evening, I found myself strolling along the beach to alleviate the stress from a long day's work.<br>
The stars of the night sky are perfectly reflected upon the water's surface, the scenery of peace and quiet gradually soothing my heart.<br>
Suddenly, I noticed a figure approaching me from just beneath the surface.<br>
Boise：<br>
A beautiful girl emerged from the water, droplets cascading under the moonlight as her emerald hair fluttered in the sea breeze.<br>
<br>
...I could only stand there spellbound, as if having just met a mermaid.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Boise：</span><br>
Huff... Puff...... I think I spent too long underwater... I need to be more careful next time...<br>
C-Commander...? What are you doing here...?<br>
<br>
The "mermaid" was actually Boise, a light cruiser who had recently joined the fleet, now looking at me with a dumbfounded expression.<br>
I let out a sigh of relief... At least it wasn't some enemy infiltrator.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Boise：</span><br>
H-had I known you were here, I would've been more careful when I surfaced...<br>
<br>
Everything had happened so suddenly that I missed my opportunity to greet her.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Boise：</span><br>
Um, Commander... I'm getting nervous from how much you're staring at me...<br>
<br>
I quickly shifted my eyes to the side.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Boise：</span><br>
Um, if you don't need anything...<br>
I'll be off then...!<br>
<br>
Before I could utter a single word, Boise had already disappeared from the pier in what seemed like the blink of an eye.<br>
Even after returning to my office, I couldn't stop thinking about our new companion. I started to sift through the stacks of documents sitting on my desk.<br>
Boise, Brooklyn-class light cruiser... Actually, isn't her turn for secretary coming up soon?<br>

2.The Rookie Secretary<br>
Port - Office<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Boise：</span><br>
G-good morning, Commander... I, I hope we can have a productive relationship...<br>
(Deep breaths, deep breaths...)<br>
<br>
And thus, the first day of Boise's secretary duties arrived.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Boise：</span><br>
So these are my responsibilities as a secretary ship...? I understand.<br>
<br>
Unlike the first impressions I got of her, Boise was surprisingly straightforward and quite easy to work with.<br>
...But I couldn't stave off my curiosity about her uncomfortable-looking mask...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Boise：</span><br>
I've finished sorting through the commission-related paperwork.<br>
<br>
Despite this being her first time as secretary, Boise was already well-adjusted to the job's pacing. She remained focused on her work, occasionally asking me questions.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Boise：</span><br>
Commander, shouldn't we take our lunch break soon...? Can I get you something to drink...?<br>
An energy drink...? Um, Commander, I believe something lighter would be better...<br>
<br>
After accepting her suggestion, I started to chat her up while waiting for her to finish preparing my beverage.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Boise：</span><br>
I, I like diving...<br>
But, I'm not a submarine, so I can only dive for a little bit...<br>
<br>
I never could've guessed that would be her hobby from the way she appeared and conducted herself.<br>
<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项1："What is it that you like about diving?"</span>'''''<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Boise：</span><br>
Um, how do I put this...<br>
Sometimes, I like the feeling of being able to drown everything out and just be by myself... Do you ever get that way, Commander?<br>
<br>
I'm sure everyone has times where they just want to leave everything behind for a while.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Boise：</span><br>
Being surrounded by the ocean... makes me feel like time is standing still.<br>
Not to mention, it's also very colorful and beautiful. Coral reefs of all shapes and sizes, sea turtles and other wildlife...<br>
You can swim with schools of fish, or you can just immerse yourself in the beautiful scenery there... It's a really profound feeling...<br>
<br>
Her heartfelt description made me visualize the beautiful sceneries of the underwater world without me even being there.<br>
And when I thought about her being in the middle of that serene, enchanting world...<br>
...I felt like I got a glimpse into the mind of the girl in front of me.<br>

Me and the Boise<br>
<br>
3.Shopping<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Boise：</span><br>
The files from the archive room, the price list of the purchase orders... Mm, that's everything that Commander requested...<br>
<br>
My secretary ship, Boise, was in the process of carrying out errands.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">St. Louis：</span><br>
Hey there, Boise~ What are you up to?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Boise：</span><br>
Oh, St. Louis... Um, Commander wanted me to help gather some documents...<br>
By the way, the diving equipment you got for me the other day was very easy to use... You're always picking out really nice things for me.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">St. Louis：</span><br>
Oh, I'm glad you like it. I know how tough being secretary can be, so I thought about getting something for you to help you relax.<br>
So, how's your new job going? Commander's pretty easy to get along with, right?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Boise：</span><br>
Mm... I thought things would be pretty stressful, but it's not too bad.<br>
Commander doesn't seem to mind me wearing my mask either...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">St. Louis：</span><br>
Well, I'm sure you'd be able to make more friends without that thing on~<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Boise：</span><br>
Th-there's no way I could do that...<br>
But that's not important... St. Louis, since you're so good at picking out presents for people... Um, do you think you could help me pick out something nice for Commander...?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">St. Louis：</span><br>
Oh my, since when did the two of you have that kind of relationship~♪<br>
(I was afraid that the commander was just being polite, but... is the mask really not an issue?)<br>
Of course I can give you a crash course on what Commander likes, but on one condition~<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Boise：</span><br>
What would that be...?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">St. Louis：</span><br>
Hehe, nothing that difficult. You just have to beat me in a little game.<br>
If Commander manages to not say "I want to see Boise's real face" for an entire week, it's your win.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Boise：</span><br>
And if Commander does...?<br>
Wait, is this your game...?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">St. Louis：</span><br>
Yup, that's the way I like doing things~ If Commander does say that, then...<br>
<br>
St. Louis whispered something into Boise's ear.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Boise：</span><br>
Wh-what are you saying? There's no way I could...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">St. Louis：</span><br>
Commander's tastes are a critically important piece of intel, you know? If you aren't prepared to put at least that much on the line, then I'm not sure I can help you.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Boise：</span><br>
Um, if it's just one week... It'll probably be okay...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">St. Louis：</span><br>
Wanna drink to that deal?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Boise：</span><br>
Mm... It's not like I actually lose anything even if I don't win...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">St. Louis：</span><br>
That's a promise then. If you lose, you'd better listen closely to what I tell you~<br>
(I wonder what you'll do, Commander~ Hehe, don't let me down~)<br>

<br>
4.Defeat?<br>
Port - Office<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Boise：</span><br>
Today's workload seems rather manageable... Shall we finish everything at once?<br>
<br>
Boise appeared to be in high spirits today.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Boise：</span><br>
The results from the latest exercise? I'll get that for you right away...!<br>
(Commander still doesn't seem concerned about my mask... Rather, I don't think it's ever been an issue...)<br>
(Maybe I'll actually win at St. Louis's game...)<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Cooper：</span><br>
Commander! I've brought you your documents!<br>
...Wait, wh-who's that?! Oh, it's just Boise...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Boise：</span><br>
Sorry... D-did I scare you...?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Cooper：</span><br>
Not at all! The pursuit of justice never ends though, so I'll be off now!<br>
<br>
After placing the documents on my desk, Cooper quietly slipped out of the office.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Boise：</span><br>
I, I knew it, my mask is scaring people off... Commander, if it's getting in the way of your work, then...<br>
<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项1："Don't worry, you're doing just fine."</span>'''''<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Boise：</span><br>
Th-thank you, Commander... I'll try to stay focused on finishing the work...!<br>
<br>
After a quick break, Boise seemed to have recovered and continued to work as hard as ever.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Libeccio：</span><br>
Commander! I've brought you something from the intel room!<br>
...Woah, what's that?!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Boise：</span><br>
S-sorry! Did I scare you...?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Libeccio：</span><br>
N-no, I just wasn't expecting to see that! Anyway, please sign right here, Commander...<br>
Well then, see you later, Commander! Come play with us sometime!<br>
<br>
Libeccio darted from the office, almost as quickly as she had swept in.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Boise：</span><br>
...I knew it, this is a problem...<br>
<br>
After Libeccio left the office, Boise clearly was letting something affect the speed of her work.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Boise：</span><br>
I keep scaring people with my mask on, but if I was to take it off... I'm not sure I'd be able to function...<br>
<br>
The situation seemed to be getting a little out of hand, and I had to do something.<br>
<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项1："Want to go shopping with me tomorrow?"</span>'''''<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Boise：</span><br>
Um, thank you, but... you don't have to go out of your way to change your shopping schedule because of me...<br>
Wait, you just want to help me relax? I see...<br>
(Phew... Commander still hasn't said anything about the mask...)<br>
<br>
I could tell that the way Cooper and Libeccio acted had a negative effect on her.<br>
While it was none of my business why she always wears her mask... I was very curious about the face underneath it.<br>

5.An Invisible Smile<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Honolulu：</span><br>
Which one do you think looks better? I honestly can't tell a difference between them...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Boise：</span><br>
Honolulu, are you shopping for pajamas?<br>
<br>
While shopping with Boise, we ran into the off-duty Honolulu at a clothing store.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Honolulu：</span><br>
St. Louis said something about pajamas needing to be fashionable as well... Boise, want to come take a look with me if you're not busy?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Boise：</span><br>
Sure. Um, Commander, you can come too if you want...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Honolulu：</span><br>
C-Commander...?! Y-you'd better not peek, I'm warning you...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Boise：</span><br>
Oh, I think this cute one would suit you well... I think it looks better on you than the really "daring" stuff...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Honolulu：</span><br>
You know, I'm glad you're here right now, Boise... St. Louis is always putting weird ideas in my head...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Boise：</span><br>
But, don't you think she has a better understanding of what's fashionable than me?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Honolulu：</span><br>
That may be true, but y'know... I somehow feel way less pressured about my decision with you here...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Boise：</span><br>
I, I guess that's good...? Want to try this one on as well...?<br>
<br>
With Boise's advice, Honolulu was able to purchase a pair of pajamas that suited her well.<br>
After leaving the store and taking a short break, I decided to take her to a recently-opened bakery.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Boise：</span><br>
Oh, I heard this place has a pretty good reputation for its desserts. I'd like to bring some back for everyone to try.<br>
<br>
Indeed, the array of sweets before me would not disappoint even the most dedicated of sugar aficionados back at port.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Helena：</span><br>
But, sickeningly sweet stuff is no good either... What should I get...<br>
<br>
Apparently, Helena was also browsing the store, caught in a similar conundrum.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Helena：</span><br>
Oh, hi Boise. I'm trying to pick out some dessert for my friends, but I don't think I want to go with something overly sweet...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Boise：</span><br>
Mm... maybe just go for things that everyone can enjoy?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Helena：</span><br>
Okay, I think everyone's a fan of caramel pudding...<br>
<br>
Seeing Boise be able to talk naturally with her friends made me feel a bit of relief.<br>
I originally offered to take her shopping to get her mind off whatever was bothering her, but it seems like she's doing just fine.<br>
After we had finished picking out our desserts, the sky had already become dark.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Boise：</span><br>
I'm so sorry... It's gotten so late because I stopped to talk to everyone...<br>
<br>
Though her mask tends to catch people off-guard, I could easily tell that she is a kind and thoughtful person.<br>
Anyone who spent a little bit of time with her would be able to see her friendly personality.<br>
Having that said though, it's undeniable that the mask gives her a sense of unapproachability...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Boise：</span><br>
Commander...?<br>
<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项1：I want to see what you're like underneath that mask.</span>'''''<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Boise：</span><br>
...I, I knew it... It's been bothering you all along...<br>
But if that's how you feel... Umm, p-please let me think it over a bit...?<br>
(I guess I lost the bet with St. Louis... But if Commander wants to see...)<br>

6.As Promised<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Brooklyn：</span><br>
Now then, I'll be the moderator to make sure Boise keeps her promise.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Boise：</span><br>
We almost made it all the way to the end too... I guess you're really taking this seriously, St. Louis.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">St. Louis：</span><br>
The outcome would've been the same even if you had won. Hehe~<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Boise：</span><br>
The same...? Does that mean you're going to tell me what Commander likes...?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Phoenix：</span><br>
Boise, I just thought up another challenge for you! You down?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Boise：</span><br>
Brooklyn, not you too...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Honolulu：</span><br>
Isn't this getup way too embarrassing...?!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">St. Louis：</span><br>
Oh my, Honolulu, did you also want to try it on that badly?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Honolulu：</span><br>
N-not a chance in hell...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Boise：</span><br>
Do I have to take my mask off right now...? It's not time to meet with Commander yet...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Brooklyn：</span><br>
Uh, there wasn't any agreement on that, but what do you think, St. Louis?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Helena：</span><br>
Don't bully Boise...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">St. Louis：</span><br>
You can't even take it off in front of your own sisters?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Boise：</span><br>
Th-there are other people around too...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">St. Louis：</span><br>
I get it, I get it. You just want Commander to be the only person who sees your face~♪<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Boise：</span><br>
Uuu...<br>
<br>
And thus, Boise set out to make good on her promise with St. Louis–<br>

7.The Sweetness of Tiramisu<br>
Boise asked to have dinner with me, and I met her at a little bar by the Eagle Union dorms.<br>
I felt like she wasn't the kind of person who'd do something as proactive as asking me out for dinner though...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">{namecode:197}：</span><br>
C-Commander...<br>
<br>
My eyes followed the sound of her voice back to its source–<br>
Boise stood there dressed in an alluring bunnygirl outfit, hiding her mouth with her hair.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Boise：</span><br>
Haah... Haah...<br>
I took off the mask... just like you asked me to...<br>
Um, umm... would you like something to drink...<br>
<br>
For whatever reason, the two of us were the only people at the bar tonight.<br>
My mind was racing to come up with reasons as to why she was dressed like this...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Boise：</span><br>
I made a promise with St. Louis... If you asked to see my face, I'd change into this outfit and then... ask you out on a date...<br>
And if I did that, she'd help me pick out a gift that you like...<br>
<br>
Is that why she put herself through all this...?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Boise：</span><br>
C-Commander, um... Now that you see me, what do you think...?<br>
<br>
Seeing her without her mask, and in this outfit... made her seem like a completely different person.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Boise：</span><br>
D-deep breaths... Haah... Haah... Okay, I feel a lot better...<br>
Commander... Umm, thanks for always treating me so well...<br>
I know I've caused you a lot of trouble, but I'm glad you've always been so patient and understanding with me...<br>
If you like what you see, then, um... I'll do everything I can to support you, so, um...<br>
<br>
Despite the fact that her face was beet-red from embarrassment, she mustered the courage to put her feelings forward.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Boise：</span><br>
Oh, um, I think the food is here...<br>
Um, tonight was my way of saying... I've become stronger, and I want to continue being with you... is that okay?<br>
