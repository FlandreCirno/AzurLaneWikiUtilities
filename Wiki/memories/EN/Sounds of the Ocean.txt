<br>
1 The Island Market<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Pearl：</span><br>
Commander, I'm over here!<br>
<br>
Open-air stalls with canvas awnings line the beach, gleaming in the sun.<br>
Pearl stands among them and waves at me with a smile on her face.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Pearl：</span><br>
Thank you for coming to the market with me today!<br>
If you hadn't told me about it, I never would've found such a neat place on this tiny little island.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
I was lucky to find it, myself. Who knew we'd find such a fun activity on our vacation?<br>
And there's so much more variety than I expected.<br>
(Shells, coral, seafood... They've even got treasure chest-styled blind boxes with stuff from the sea floor.)<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Pearl：</span><br>
I'm sure we'll find lots of fun things. Heehee, maybe even some real-life treasure?<br>
<br>
Pearl and I browsed the market for a while.<br>
She found a few things that piqued her interest, but whenever I tried to buy one, she'd already moved on to the next stall.<br>
Even halfway through, we had yet to purchase anything.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Pearl：</span><br>
Hmm... Commander, do you find it odd that I haven't bought anything?<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
A little. You seemed really into a few of those stalls.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Pearl：</span><br>
I was just trying to see if the corals were real. Unfortunately, they were all fakes.<br>
The one selling jars of marine plant specimens did have some rare flora, yes...<br>
Their crude handling makes me doubt that any of the specimens will last long, however.<br>
So yes, there were many interesting things, but nothing that I would be satisfied to call a treasure just yet.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Might be hard to find real treasure at a place like this... Wanna try cracking open a few chests?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Pearl：</span><br>
Commander? You seriously believe in those?<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
What if, though? Let's open ten to start.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Pearl：</span><br>
They're selling them in the hundreds. Of course there isn't any real treasure in there!<br>
Don't you dare buy a single one!<br>
Goodness... Anyway, let's get back to it.<br>
Besides, I wasn't just looking around. I heard a fun little rumor along the way!<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
A rumor? I must've missed that. What was it?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Pearl：</span><br>
I won't be telling you yet.<br>
If we find it, well... You just look forward to that!<br>

<br>
2 The Happy Camper<br>
The evening sky is a beautiful orange.<br>
After scrutinizing the final stall, Pearl shakes her head in disappointment.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Pearl：</span><br>
Alas, still nothing...<br>
If there were such mysterious and rare treasure...<br>
It would have already drawn the attention of all the venue.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
There are a few more down on the other side of the island. Wanna check there?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Pearl：</span><br>
It's so much quieter than the market here. Doubtful we'll find anything...<br>
Don't worry, Commander. The treasure isn't what matters – it's that I got to spend time with you today.<br>
And we saw such a beautiful evening sky, too.<br>
<br>
She suddenly freezes up. Surprise dyes her smile.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Pearl：</span><br>
Oh, no...<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
What's the matter?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Pearl：</span><br>
Commander, the ferry is leaving!<br>
Aah... We missed the boat...<br>
<br>
Pearl watches in abject horror as the last ferry home slowly floats away, becoming a tiny dot on the horizon.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Pearl：</span><br>
I knew we shouldn't have left the ship in a major harbor... Well, this is a problem.<br>
<br>
She stares intently at me for a moment. Then, she opens her arms wide, as if waiting for a hug.<br>
Embarrassment finds its way onto her face.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Pearl：</span><br>
Hmm... No, no, it won't work. I mustn't pursue the ferry with you in my arms...<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
I guess we'll get to see the moonlight tonight, eh?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Pearl：</span><br>
Huh?<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Let's stay overnight.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Pearl：</span><br>
But this island doesn't have any hotels...<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
No problem. There's plenty of open space.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Pearl：</span><br>
Huh?! I don't have a cargo hold, you know...<br>
Sleeping in the open air doesn't seem like the best idea, either. We might end up crab feed...<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Look over there, Pearl.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Pearl：</span><br>
Where?<br>
<br>
In the dusk, lights in the market turn on one after another. It's as if the starry sky has come down to terra firma.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Pearl：</span><br>
It's beautiful.<br>
Should I take this to mean that... though we missed the boat, we've been treated to a beautiful sight in return?<br>
Life doesn't always go the way we want, but that in itself can be a unique experience... Is that what you're saying?<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Umm, no. Not what I'm saying.<br>
I mean, that was beautiful and all, but still. I mean THAT.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Pearl：</span><br>
Huh? What is that over there?<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
It's a sign, see? It says The Happy Camper.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Pearl：</span><br>
Ooh... Let's camp there tonight!<br>

<br>
3 The Ocean in a Shell<br>
Tents, sleeping bags, stoves, and ropes line the shelves illuminated by warm lanterns.<br>
Pearl examines them curiously, occasionally running her fingers over them.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Pearl：</span><br>
Commander, what do you think of this tent?<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
These bulky, claustrophobic tents are the kind you use in the cold, mountainous terrain. Might be a little too heavy for us.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Pearl：</span><br>
I see. Then... this one?<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Good size and construction, but it doesn't have ventilation. Without windows, it'll get stuffy by the ocean.<br>
<br>
She nods along, only half understanding.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Pearl：</span><br>
You know so much. I can only tell them apart by size, really.<br>
Hmm... How's this one?<br>
It has a window for ventilation, and it looks just right for two...<br>
<br>
She crouches down and examines the two-person tent. Once satisfied, she looks up at me expectantly.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Hmm... I like the size and wind resistance, but we'll have to find a sleeping pad that fits it.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Pearl：</span><br>
Speaking of... May I choose the color and design of the mat?<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Fine by me.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Pearl：</span><br>
Incidentally, I've been eyeing that mat in the corner over there. The pattern is so cute!<br>
The deep-blue base and white pearl pattern...<br>
I think let's choose that one!<br>
<br>
From there, we pick out sleeping bags, lanterns, cooking utensils, and a host of other tools for camping.<br>
Suddenly, Pearl seems to notice something and points at an out-of-place device in the corner.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Pearl：</span><br>
Is that... a clamshell? Hmm, the texture is slightly off...<br>
Is it a decoration made to look like one? Or is this some kind of camping implement, too?<br>
Oh, there's a sign next to it! So it's an audio player with a hidden recording device...<br>
What an odd design. All of the ones I've seen are those little cylindrical cases with speakers.<br>
...I knew it! This is no ordinary recording device. The sign says that this model is often used for professional observation in nature.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
So it's made to blend in with nature?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Pearl：</span><br>
I think so!<br>
Then this one is made to be placed by the sea, I assume?<br>
It would record the sounds of the ocean at their most authentic...<br>
<br>
She raises her slender fingers and flicks the pearl in the center of it.<br>
The device turns on and plays comforting ambient sounds.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Pearl：</span><br>
Oh, my... It sounds beautiful, like waves crashing at shore.<br>
I could use this to freeze the sounds of the ocean in time forever...<br>
<br>
Her eyes open wide as she stares unblinkingly at the slowly rotating pearl.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Did this little thing strike your fancy?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Pearl：</span><br>
No... I was thinking of something else.<br>
Do you remember that rumor I mentioned earlier?<br>
It was about an incredible treasure that appeared on this island – a magical item that can record the sounds of the ocean.<br>
...Was it about this very item?<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
If so, it's kind of a disappointing tale.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Pearl：</span><br>
Yeah...<br>
Heehee. But the sea is vast, maybe there is such a treasure out there.<br>
<br>
In the darkening night, Pearl approaches me and helps me carry some of the camping gear.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Pearl：</span><br>
Are we finished here?<br>
Let's find a place to pitch our tent. If we don't hurry, it'll be too dark to see!<br>

4 By the Beach at Night<br>
Before long, we started to set up camp on an elevated patch of land with a nice view of the beach.<br>
It's pretty far from shore, but close enough that we can hear the sound of waves.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Pearl：</span><br>
Next, according to the instructions...<br>
Commander, can you hand me that pole? Yes, the silver one.<br>
Commander, hold the tent down here for me, please... Just like that!<br>
Commander...<br>
<br>
After a brief period of work, she puts down her tools and stretches out happily.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Pearl：</span><br>
And finally, we have a tent! Thanks to you, it went nice and fast.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
I'm lucky you happened to be so skilled. You figured out all the complex steps in no time.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Pearl：</span><br>
Setting up a tent isn't that different from crafts.<br>
If we could get the opportunity to make accessories together...<br>
I bet our teamwork would be perfect!<br>
You're always so reliable, Commander.<br>
There! Now that the tent itself is up, let's get to decorating it.<br>
Have you heard of bioluminescent jellyfish, Commander?<br>
They live deep underwater. At this time of year, they emit a warm glow.<br>
When they gather, the sea floor lights up like a galaxy in the night sky.<br>
I'd love to catch one and put it in the tent...<br>
Oh! Commander, do you know about coral reef fish?<br>
They're masters of disguise, because they resemble coral in shape and color.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Are you saying you want to decorate the tent with them, too?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Pearl：</span><br>
That's right!<br>
And...<br>
<br>
She rattles off idea after idea.<br>
Unfortunately, though, she's forced to confront the fact that the tent is not underwater and thus cannot support marine life.<br>
Before we know it, we've finished furnishing and decorating the tent.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Pearl：</span><br>
By the way, I remembered something else about that rumor I mentioned earlier.<br>
What if the treasure they're talking about is actually some kind of special conch shell?<br>
A conch that evokes the storied memory of the sea...<br>
<br>
Pearl gazes thoughtfully at the ocean.<br>
The sandy beach looks pale under the moonlight. It resembles a trove dotted with rare treasures.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Pearl：</span><br>
We still have time, Commander. Why don't we go search?<br>

<br>
5 Echoes of the Ocean<br>
Silvery moonlight bathes the sand in a cool, gentle glow.<br>
The daytime bustle makes it seem all the more serene now, as the only sound left is the peaceful rhythm of waves breaking.<br>
Pearl and I stroll on the white sand together, leaving a long trail of footprints behind us.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Pearl：</span><br>
The waves crashing, the scent of the sea... It's such a blissful place.<br>
It's truly relaxing to take a long walk on the beach again after so long.<br>
The ocean is magical. What other place can make you feel such peace and tranquility?<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Your interpretation is valid, but that's not the only thing that the ocean means to people.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Pearl：</span><br>
Oh?<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
I think that, to most people, it evokes more of a sense of... always changing.<br>
It's deep and dark, and countless lives and sights lay hidden underwater.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Pearl：</span><br>
Hmm... I can't disagree with that perception, either.<br>
The ocean can be violent and merciless, too...<br>
But if people are willing to delve deep into the heart of the sea, then I think their opinions will change.<br>
With a motherly touch, even the shallows can bring life to a small island such as this one.<br>
Many of the worlds' civilizations first flourished in the cradle of the sea, after all.<br>
So I...<br>
...Oh?<br>
Commander, did you hear that?<br>
<br>
Pearl suddenly stops, holds her breath, and stares fixedly at the water.<br>
The eternal song of the waves, the rustling of the wind through the brush, and the murmuring of countless night insects...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Pearl：</span><br>
No... There's something else.<br>
Something very special...<br>
<br>
She casts her gaze to the deep, dark sea reflecting the silver light of the moon.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Pearl：</span><br>
A unique call, ever so faint, but as clear as a bell.<br>
<br>
Her eyes suddenly light up with joy and surprise.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Pearl：</span><br>
Commander, wait here a moment.<br>
I'll be right back! Just stay right there... Don't move a muscle!<br>
<br>
As soon as the words leave her lips, she dives into the water.<br>
Her figure vanishes beneath the waves in the blink of an eye, leaving just ripples as she plunges into its depths.<br>

6 My Gift to You<br>
The cold moon shines eternal, and the waves roll in ceaselessly.<br>
I'm left alone on the beach where Pearl and I walked side-by-side before.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
It's so quiet now... Kinda unsettling.<br>
She probably won't be back for a while. What to do...<br>
<br>
As if in response to my thoughts, the clouds suddenly disperse, allowing the moon to illuminate the entire beach.<br>
Scattered shells in the sand shine like stars.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Now would be a good opportunity to hunt for treasure.<br>
Something that can record the sounds of the sea...<br>
If it isn't a device, then it must be some kind of special conch shell after all...<br>
<br>
I kneel down and start looking for shells.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Hmm... Well, of course it wouldn't be that easy.<br>
<br>
Time flies amidst the quiet until I manage to find one that I suppose will have to do.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
It doesn't quite match the legends, but it's better than meeting her empty-handed... I hope she likes it.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Pearl：</span><br>
Of course I do, Commander.<br>
<br>
Right on cue, I hear Pearl's voice.<br>
With a giggle, she emerges from the nearby shoal.<br>
Water drips from her hair and clothes, sparkling in the moonlight.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Pearl：</span><br>
I love any gift from you, silly.<br>
And look! I have a gift for you, too.<br>
Oh, but fiiirst... Can you show me what you got for me?<br>
<br>
The wet girl sidles closer until I can feel her breath and smell the sea on her.<br>
She sets her sights on the shell in my hand.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Pearl：</span><br>
Is that the treasure? The one that records the sounds of the sea?!<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Maybe... the discount version?<br>
Guess I should've opened ten of those treasure chests at the market after all. It might've given me something better than this.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Pearl：</span><br>
Pfft... Still set on those blind boxes, are you?<br>
<br>
She gently takes the conch and presses it to her ear.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Pearl：</span><br>
Nothing in those chests could hold a candle to this... because you picked it out just for me, Commander.<br>

7 Mutually Treasured<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Pearl：</span><br>
Well... I guess it's time to show you my treasure.<br>
<br>
Pearl holds out her right hand and reveals her palm.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Pearl：</span><br>
Here, Commander.<br>
This treasure is for you.<br>
<br>
She shows me a beautiful conch shell with a rare shape.<br>
It has a soft, iridescent shine like mother-of-pearl.<br>
The tranquility and profundity of its shine seem to contain all the light that has ever touched the sea.<br>
Pearl gingerly places it in my hand.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Pearl：</span><br>
It's all yours, Commander.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Wait... Is this real, honest-to-goodness treasure?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Pearl：</span><br>
I wouldn't know.<br>
I heard a voice calling for me, and when I followed it, I found this.<br>
Listen... Its song tells the story of all the ocean.<br>
Its beautiful scenery, its ancient and unknowable history, and everything happening in this moment...<br>
And most important of all...<br>
<br>
There's a flash of some emotion in her eyes.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Pearl：</span><br>
I left my voice and all the things I want to say to you in this shell.<br>
Through the mysterious ways of the ocean.<br>
<br>
I gaze at the tiny shell that holds the essence of the sea. Subconsciously, I hold it up to my ear.<br>
Holding my breath, I listen for the voice sealed within.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Pearl：</span><br>
You need to be in a special environment to hear the conch.<br>
It needs to resonate with the ocean, or... with a peaceful heart...<br>
Don't worry. I'd be happy to interpret it for you.<br>
Any time you want, I'll tell you... everything about me.<br>
