<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Hiryuu：</span><br>
Are we ready yet?! The enemy's counterattack is incoming!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Akagi：</span><br>
...1st and 2nd Carrier Divisions, load your planes with torpedoes. Prepare for anti-ship combat!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Kaga：</span><br>
What?! Change equipment right now?!<br>
Nee-sama, I can't do that! What if the enemy attacks while we're unprepared?!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Souryuu：</span><br>
Multiple enemy aircraft approaching at an altitude of 2000!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Akagi：</span><br>
They're coming from behind?!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Kaga：</span><br>
Dammit! Call back the fighters! We need anti-air now!<br>
Graaaaghhh!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">{namecode:91}：</span><br>
{namecode:92}，{namecode:92}！！<br>
<br>
............<br>
......<br>
To let my guard down... at such a critical time...<br>
… <br>
...I'm sorry. Looks like I couldn't live up to your expectations...<br>
......<br>
Amagi... san...<br>
                                                              ——Crimson Echoes<br>
-- I remember... the events from way back...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">{namecode:161}：</span><br>
*Giggle*... checkmate.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">{namecode:92}：</span><br>
Argh!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">{namecode:91}：</span><br>
That makes this your tenth consecutive victory!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">{namecode:92}：</span><br>
You dirty little...! You baited out my Gold General! You're not playing fair!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">{namecode:161}：</span><br>
You focus too much on offense. Your fate was already sealed when you left your King in the middle of the board.<br>
Let's just say that going on the offensive while appearing to be on the defensive to lure out your opponent can sometimes be an effective strategy.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">{namecode:92}：</span><br>
Look at you being all smug and wagging your tails... You were just lucky to catch me off guard! I'll show you...<br>
Come on, we're having another match!<br>
<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项1：Have one more match</span>'''''<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项2：Call it quits</span>'''''<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">{namecode:92}：</span><br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项1）</span>'''''Aaahh! God dammit!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">{namecode:91}：</span><br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项1）</span>'''''That makes this your eleventh consecutive victory!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">{namecode:161}：</span><br>
I'm afraid it's gotten quite late... Akagi, we should head home soon. I wouldn't want to get in the way of Kaga's training.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">{namecode:91}：</span><br>
Ah, certainly!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">{namecode:92}：</span><br>
What, are you leaving because you're scared of actually losing to me?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">{namecode:161}：</span><br>
Not at all. The fact is that in two days, the Sakura Empire will be having its annual naval exercise. You haven't forgotten about it, have you?<br>
Speaking of which, don't you agree we would be more evenly matched in a wargame than in a board game?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">{namecode:92}：</span><br>
...That's true. Then we shall have a real battle to see who is the most powerful modern ship!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Mutsu：</span><br>
Sis, I checked out the participants for this year... and they all seem really motivated! I'm so excited!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Nagato：</span><br>
Haven't I told you to refrain from calling me "Sis" when others are present?!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Mutsu：</span><br>
Aww! But you're my big sister, so why can't I call you "Sis"?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Nagato：</span><br>
*Groan*... Call me whatever you wish...<br>
*Sigh*... That aside, we have our exercise tomorrow... I hope that will go well...<br>

<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Nagato：</span><br>
I am Nagato, the flagship of the Combined Fleet! I will be the referee for this year's Naval Exercises!<br>
...In these turbulent times, we face threats on all sides, not only from the chaos the Sirens are causing, but also from other forces around the world. And so...<br>
... now more than ever, we must all come together as one!<br>
And we must show our enemies that the Sakura Empire Fleet is stronger than it has ever been before!<br>
The flagship of the Combined Fleet and shrine maiden of the Sakura Empire, Nagato, gazed at all the ships in attendance for the wargames.<br>
The flagship of the winning side of this year's wargames shall be appointed as the Combined Fleet's next flagship!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Audience：</span><br>
!!!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Kaga(BB)：</span><br>
Nagato-sama's... next flagship?!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Mutsu：</span><br>
Be quiet!<br>
I will now announce the team compositions for this year's wargames!<br>
Red Team: Battlecruiser Amagi...<br>
Blue Team: Battleship Kaga...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Kaga(BB)：</span><br>
Oh what a delight! Amagi, are you ready for that rematch?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Nagato：</span><br>
This year's wargames will decide the future course of events for our Combined Fleet.<br>
I want everyone to bear this fact in mind. I want you to demonstrate what you are capable of and fight without remorse!<br>
...Now, let the Combined Fleet's wargames begin!<br>

<span style="color:#ff0000;">Hatakaze：</span><br>
Why, I didn't expect Team Red's flagship herself to appear right before me.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Amagi：</span><br>
An exercise is no place for lollygagging. Kaga may start acting haphazardly if I don't show myself.<br>
<span style="color:#ff0000;">Hatakaze：</span><br>
Still, you must be quite confident to appear on the front in person. This is no mere game to you, is it?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Amagi：</span><br>
Perhaps so. It is true I like devising new strategies, but never once have I said I am an incapable soldier.<br>
<span style="color:#ff0000;">Hatakaze：</span><br>
Indeed... I fully believe that it's a fortunate thing I am not your enemy.<br>
But still, here I stand, blocking your way, like the enemy would.<br>
If you wish to pass, you must first defeat me!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Amagi：</span><br>
Then let us have a fight in good spirit. *Giggle*...<br>
{{折叠面板|内容结束}}

{{折叠面板|标题=Reminescence III|选项=4|主框=1|样式=primary|展开=否}}
<span style="color:#ff0000;">Hatakaze：</span><br>
It's over. There's nothing one can do when facing superior firepower.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Amagi：</span><br>
You still carried out your duty well.<br>
<span style="color:#ff0000;">Hatakaze：</span><br>
...Amagi, are you actually going for it?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Amagi：</span><br>
What do you mean by that?<br>
<span style="color:#ff0000;">Hatakaze：</span><br>
Do you seriously want to be the Combined Fleet's next flagship?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Amagi：</span><br>
... ... <br>
<span style="color:#ff0000;">Hatakaze：</span><br>
You still behave like the person I know, but I could sense you were different when we fought.<br>
You're fighting with determination the likes of which I've never seen from you before.<br>
I can think of no other reason why you would come to the front when you could get the same results by commanding your team from the back.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Amagi：</span><br>
Who is to say that... Perhaps it's just time for a change of pace. It might turn out to be necessary. <br>
Times are changing; if we just keep practicing the same things each year, we'll quickly be left behind on the actual battlefield. <br>
As Nagato-sama said, the world around us is in chaos. We can't afford to wallow in our isolationism.<br>
Precisely because this is a wargame, I'd like to test some new strategies. <br>
If we can gather some new insight, or even learn what not do in the future, that would make this exercise a success. <br>
<span style="color:#ff0000;">Hatakaze：</span><br>
Spoken like a true commander...<br>
I understand now.<br>
No matter who wins, I will always support the flagship of the Combined Fleet.<br>
<br>
With these words, Hatakaze left the exercises premises.<br>
......<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Mutsu：</span><br>
"We will now review the results of the first day of the Naval Exercise!"<br>
<br>
And with that, the first day of the Combined Fleet's Naval Exercise had come to an end.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Amagi：</span><br>
*Cough, cough*... At last, it's over... She came too close to figuring out my plan...<br>
This is what happens when I don't exercise for so long... *Cough, cough*... I feel like I could faint... <br>
I need to hold on... just a little longer... <br>

<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Amagi：</span><br>
Ahahah... So you're leading the attack unit, Naka?<br>
<span style="color:#ff0000;">Naka：</span><br>
That's right, Amagi-san!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Amagi：</span><br>
I'm glad to see you're doing well. Is this your first time leading during an exercise?<br>
<span style="color:#ff0000;">Naka：</span><br>
It is! It's an honor to fight alongside my superiors and to be seen as a candidate for the next flagship of the Combined Fleet!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Amagi：</span><br>
Ahah, it's good that you're so eager, but I hope you haven't forgotten that this is a battlefield.<br>
<span style="color:#ff0000;">Naka：</span><br>
Of course not! Just because you're my superior doesn't mean I'll step to the side and nicely ask you to pass through!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Amagi：</span><br>
Then let us see what you're capable of.<br>
{{折叠面板|内容结束}}

{{折叠面板|标题=Reminescence V|选项=6|主框=1|样式=primary|展开=否}}
<span style="color:#ff0000;">Naka：</span><br>
You win after all, Amagi-san! You've defeated me!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Amagi：</span><br>
Don't feel down, you fought well. You've learned very much from your sisters.<br>
<span style="color:#ff0000;">Naka：</span><br>
Do you get along well with your sister too?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Amagi：</span><br>
I can't say. But I can say your sisters were quite outstanding in the previous exercises.<br>
Jintsuu is wise, Sendai is strong... And the qualities you possess may rival or even surpass theirs.<br>
<span style="color:#ff0000;">Naka：</span><br>
Eheheh, thank you! I'll keep working as hard as I can!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Amagi：</span><br>
...I wish Akagi would be more like you.<br>
<span style="color:#ff0000;">Naka：</span><br>
Akagi...? Do you mean your sister?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Amagi：</span><br>
Yes. She's... well, I might have been a little too lenient with her...<br>
<span style="color:#ff0000;">Naka：</span><br>
Too lenient...? I think she's incredibly strong.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Amagi：</span><br>
She may be strong, but if she can't control her strength... I suppose it's fine if everything goes well, but if it does not...<br>
<span style="color:#ff0000;">Naka：</span><br>
She'll be fine. She has you if she needs guidance!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Amagi：</span><br>
That won't always be... *Cough*! *Cough cough*!<br>
Amagi suddenly began coughing heavily.<br>
<span style="color:#ff0000;">Naka：</span><br>
Amagi-san?! Are you okay?!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Amagi：</span><br>
I'm fine... *Cough cough*... It's just that preparing for the wargames has had a small impact on my health.<br>
I apologize for being such a pitiful sight.<br>
Shouldn't you hurry back to the harbor? You've been "sunk", after all.<br>
<span style="color:#ff0000;">Naka：</span><br>
I... I will! Take care of yourself, Amagi-san!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Amagi：</span><br>
*Phew*...<br>
"She has me", you say? ...I suppose she does...<br>
But who knows for how long I will actually be here to watch over you, Akagi...<br>

<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Amagi：</span><br>
Everybody seems to be in quite a rush... Did something happen earlier this morning?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Hatakaze：</span><br>
Oh, you're finally here. There's something not so great going on. Just follow me.<br>
<br>
The two hurried off to the place where everyone was gathering.<br>
That place being in front of the exercise's information board.！<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">{namecode:92}：</span><br>
Are you stupid?<br>
"If I can participate then Amagi won't need to come to the exercise"? Then what? Are you going to fight with unfinished equipment and sheer naive motivation?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">{namecode:91}：</span><br>
You're one to talk! You ran away from the battle with your tails between your legs!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">{namecode:92}：</span><br>
Listen, you absolute idiot. That sly, conniving she-fox is an expert at tricking people with her dirty little schemes.<br>
Just because she's appearing in person at the frontlines doesn't mean I'll lower my guard and get lured out by her, no matter what an idiot like you says.<br>
And furthermore, I'm a battleship. I'm completely different from battlecruisers like you two.<br>
Just look at how thin your armor is. Do you think I, a battleship, have any reason to be scared of fighting you?？<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">{namecode:91}：</span><br>
How dare you! Unlike you, nee-sama and I have always focused on speed! How would a snail like you catch up to us cruising at 30 knots?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">{namecode:92}：</span><br>
Hah, you're not telling me you're PROUD of how fast you can run away, are you?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">{namecode:91}：</span><br>
...Your hair color says it all, the inside of your head is as white as a blank canvas, you idiot!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">{namecode:92}：</span><br>
No you, you bootlicker! Your only redeeming feature is that big rack of yours...!<br>
<br>
-- CLANG!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">{namecode:92}：</span><br>
Owww?!<br>
<br>
The two sisters who seemed on the brink of starting a fight fell silent in the blink of an eye from the intense rage they could sense.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">{namecode:161}：</span><br>
Who is this "sly, conniving she-fox" you speak of~?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">{namecode:91}：</span><br>
Nee-sama!<br>
<br>
-- CLANG!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">{namecode:161}：</span><br>
Didn't I tell you to be nice to everyone~? Why are you picking a fight with Kaga~?<br>
There, now let's be nice and shake hands~<br>
<br>
Amagi smiled and forced Akagi and Kaga to hold hands.<br>
...They both had bumps forming on their heads.<br>
-- That woman seriously freaks me out.<br>
Hidden beneath Amagi's loving smile was a rage that would frighten even the most vile of beasts. All the bystanders knew this for a fact.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">{namecode:161}：</span><br>
There, now you've reconciled and will live happily ever after.<br>
<br>
Akagi and Kaga couldn't stop their tears.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">{namecode:161}：</span><br>
The future of the Sakura Empire lies in our hands, and if we're not all nice to each other then we won't be able to defeat our enemies~<br>
Now, today's exercise will be starting soon, so could everyone return to their posts?<br>
<br>
Both sisters started tightening their own grip on the other's hand, seemingly because they hadn't quite reached a mutual understanding yet.<br>
Nevertheless, overwhelmed by Amagi's silent rage, they both reluctantly let go of the other's hand and began walking in opposite directions.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">{namecode:92}：</span><br>
You got away this time, bootlicker. Next time I see you on the battlefield I'll make you understand the class difference between us.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">{namecode:91}：</span><br>
Hmph! Before the day is over I will make YOU understand that Amagi is the strongest of her class, so don't think you can run away again.<br>
<br>
The crowd of onlookers who had gathered around began to disperse as well. And then...<br>
The only person left was Amagi who stood there in silence, lost in her own thoughts.<br>

<span style="color:#ff0000;">Kaga(BB)：</span><br>
At last we meet on the battlefield, Amagi!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Amagi：</span><br>
The King's defense consists of 3 Gold and Silver pieces... and you have learned how to attack them.<br>
<span style="color:#ff0000;">Kaga(BB)：</span><br>
I have you to thank for that. Let's be honest, you know a lot more about shrewdness and tactics than me...<br>
But in combat, someone like you doesn't stand a chance against me!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Amagi：</span><br>
Then let's make a deal: if you win, I shall become your servant who will eliminate all those that stand in your way.。<br>
But if I win, you will become the most powerful weapon in my arsenal, and you will cooperate with me on my plans.<br>
<span style="color:#ff0000;">Kaga(BB)：</span><br>
...But of course.<br>
The title of next flagship belongs to me. Now brace yourself!<br>
{{折叠面板|内容结束}}

{{折叠面板|标题=Reminscence VIII|选项=9|主框=1|样式=primary|展开=否}}
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Amagi：</span><br>
The King draws closer as if engulfing you... You cannot escape.<br>
<span style="color:#ff0000;">Kaga(BB)：</span><br>
And suddenly, I'm surrounded... So you've been hiding your talent for combat all along.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Amagi：</span><br>
"All warfare is based on deception." I planned this before the wargames had even begun.<br>
<span style="color:#ff0000;">Kaga(BB)：</span><br>
Guh...! How is that humanly possible...<br>
Even in the midst of gunfire and explosions you manage to stay calm and adjust your strategy and issue commands...<br>
I admit total defeat. Deal with me however you want.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Amagi：</span><br>
Ahaha... Then could I ask you to start calling me "Amagi-san" from now on?<br>
<span style="color:#ff0000;">Kaga(BB)：</span><br>
You witch...! Stop being so full of yourself...!<br>
<br>
Their lighthearted conversation continued for a short while.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Amagi：</span><br>
One thing has been on my mind. Your strategies involve throwing caution to the wind somewhat.<br>
Then what if today had not been a wargame, but a real battle...? Could you have actually...<br>

<br>
......<br>
The Sakura Empire Combined Fleet's Naval Exercises were about to conclude with Nagato's congratulatory speech.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Nagato：</span><br>
Ladies and gentlemen, I am proud of all the people that participated in our Naval Exercise!<br>
Both teams of Red and Blue, lead by Amagi and Kaga, respectively, fought very well throughout the entire event!<br>
As there were no significant differences in their technique, size, or equipment, the only thing that determined the victor was their tactics...<br>
The Combined Fleet will treasure the experience it was able to get from this year's wargames, such as the mastery of their guns and torpedoes and experience working with team formations different from what they are used to.<br>
I want you to leverage these skills and to be ready for war with the Sirens or any other foreign power.<br>
Now, in regards to the candidate for the next Combined Fleet flagship...<br>
When the appropriate time comes, I will delegate my powers to the Amagi-class battlecruiser, Amagi!<br>
Amagi, you should be prepared for an important duty, a duty rivaling that of a Sakura Empire shrine maiden, a duty passed down from Mikasa-sama's days!<br>
{namecode:91}：<br>
Nee-sama... will be the Combined Fleet's next flagship...!<br>
<br>
Akagi was so overjoyed that she burst into tears.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Nagato：</span><br>
Lastly, there is one more thing I have to tell you.<br>
I have received some news that are rather sudden even for me, so I have not had much time to absorb it...<br>
In an instant, Nagato's tone of voice became heavy.<br>
As we all know, our battle against the Sirens many decades ago was won by investing an outrageous amount of resources into our military.<br>
But we were not the only ones who did so. In order to create a ubiquitous lifeline of blue across the ocean, all major powers had to pay an equal price for this shared victory...<br>
And so, now that the Sirens have been temporarily repelled and we have recovered our strength, the admiralty of all factions have held a discussion and settled on a Treaty.<br>
The Eagle Union, Royal Navy, Sakura Empire, Iris, and Sardegnia have already signed it... In fact, most of the admiralty of all major powers that were in the great war have.<br>
The factions are preventing one another from achieving total supremacy while simultaneously striving for a balance of power and saving energy on the upkeep of their fleets.<br>
They say that everyone "must downscale their navy by an agreed-upon amount."<br>
...I was just as astonished as you all are.<br>
In essence, this means that from now on the construction of new capital ships is not permitted, and construction of them that is already underway must be halted. A lucky few may be converted to a different type of ship, but the rest won't ever be completed.<br>
And any ship that did not meet the Treaty's terms must be...<br>
<br>
...scrapped.<br>

<br>
Now, I understand.<br>
One must evolve in order to survive.<br>
For the weak to become extinct is a fact of nature. <br>
Those who perished were simply too weak. Nothing more.<br>
If this is to be my fate, then at least let me meet my end on the battlefield.<br>
I now entrust the future of the Combined Fleet- no, of the Sakura Empire to you...<br>
My... sworn... rival...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">{namecode:144}：</span><br>
Amagi, there's trouble! Kaga just left this letter before charging straight towards the Siren-controlled Mirror Sea by herself!<br>
A destroyer division has already been deployed to chase after her, but they lack the firepower to handle recon on the Mirror Sea...<br>
<br>
Amagi, standing there emotionlessly, receives Kaga's letter from Ashigara.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">{namecode:161}：</span><br>
(It's just like you to write something like this, Kaga... Could you be...)<br>
I understand the situation. Please continue the search. I shall handle the rest.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">{namecode:144}：</span><br>
Understood!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">{namecode:161}：</span><br>
Since the singing of that "Treaty," everything has changed...<br>
We're not the only ones who were affected. Even those girls in the Eagle Union...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">{namecode:91}：</span><br>
Amagi, will our equipment also be dismantled and replaced with those strange things...?<br>
I haven't even had a chance to experience the recoil of my 41cm cannons yet...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">{namecode:161}：</span><br>
... ... ...<br>
Our time is short, and there is something I still must finish. But before that, I have to bring Kaga back first.<br>
(However, sending a hastily cobbled-together fleet into Siren territory is extremely ill-advised... What should I do...?)<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">{namecode:91}：</span><br>
Say, Amagi, are these little mosquitoes really able to replace the splendor of our main batteries?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">{namecode:161}：</span><br>
From the very beginning, the world has never judged who is weak or strong. You are just using that as an excuse to escape from reality.<br>
... Mosquitoes?<br>
... That's right! There is a way!<br>
<br>
To Akagi's surprise, the normally collected Amagi let out a yell and bolted out of the room.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Amagi：</span><br>
*Gasp* *Gasp* ... Houshou, do you have... some spare time?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">{namecode:89}：</span><br>
Amagi! What brought you here in such a hurry?<br>
<br>
Whether it was because she hadn't exercised without her rigging for so long or because she'd ran there in a hurry, Amagi seemed out of breath.<br>
After taking several deep breaths, Amagi clasped Houshou's shoulders.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Amagi：</span><br>
Houshou, as the first aircraft carrier of the Sakura Empire, I have a favor to ask of you...<br>
Are you able to send your planes to search for Kaga in the Mirror Sea?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">{namecode:89}：</span><br>
Eh? Kaga? B-but I only learned how to use these planes recently... I don't have any real combat experience...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Amagi：</span><br>
Please, I'm begging you, you only have to find Kaga. I'll handle the rest.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">{namecode:89}：</span><br>
I don't quite understand the situation, but for you to be this desperate... I'll see what I can do.<br>
<br>
As if embraced by the sea breeze, Houshou extended her hand towards the horizon like she was parting the clouds-<br>
As her words vanished into the wind, over a dozen aircraft began to materialize from Houshou's flight deck, encircling the sky above her.<br>
Amagi, Akagi, and the newly-arrived escort fleet could only watch in silence, mouths agape, as they witnessed the spectacle in front of them for the first time.<br>
...For a brief moment, they thought they could see the first rays of an era about to dawn.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">{namecode:89}：</span><br>
Please help search for Kaga in the dark clouds of the Mirror Seas~<br>
And most importantly, everyone, please come back safely!<br>
<br>
With Houshou's instructions, the aircraft fanned out in seven different directions, soon disappearing into the distance.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Amagi：</span><br>
Thank you so much for your assistance, Houshou. I'll definitely bring Kaga back. Also...<br>
<br>
Amagi drew close to Houshou, her lips brushing against her ear, whispering something before pulling away. With that, she took a deep bow of gratitude before leading the escort fleet away.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">{namecode:89}：</span><br>
I understand. May the Gods of Fortune be with you.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">{namecode:91}：</span><br>
Sister, you're now going to search the Mirror Seas by staying in contact with those planes, right? I also-<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Amagi：</span><br>
See that, Akagi? Aren't those planes far more capable than you had first expected?<br>
As for you, your new armaments are still not complete. There's no way we'd be able to risk you on the front lines. Be a good girl and wait back in port for your new equipment, all right?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">{namecode:91}：</span><br>
B-but... I can't help but have a bad feeling about this still...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Amagi：</span><br>
Listen to your big sister. I swear to bring Kaga back safely.<br>
<br>
Amagi smiled warmly in an attempt to console her little sister before turning towards the ocean and departing...<br>
But she could not hide the unease and anxiety seeping out from her smile, not even from herself.<br>

<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Amagi：</span><br>
So this is what has become of the areas occupied by the Sirens... I passed through here scarcely half a month ago, and now...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Hatakaze：</span><br>
The Sirens' movements are unpredictable. Who could have foreseen them attacking the same place where we just held our wargames?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ashigara：</span><br>
Reporting in! Houshou's reconnaissance squad has detected combat activity to 2 o'clock, 10 nautical miles ahead!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Amagi：</span><br>
Great news. Though I'm not sold on their combat ability, at least these little flying critters are great at reconnaissance. Hehe...<br>
All ships, switch to high alert. Utilize your own best judgment in dealing with incoming Sirens.<br>

<br>
BOOOOOOM!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Amagi：</span><br>
... Agh!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">{namecode:144}&{namecode:40}：</span><br>
Amagi!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Amagi：</span><br>
Don't worry about me, it's just a scratch. I just... did not expect these things to self-destruct. How negligent of me...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ashigara：</span><br>
Please don't overexert yourself, Amagi. You should leave the front lines to us.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Amagi：</span><br>
No, that simply won't do.<br>
Chess tactics are to be left on the chessboard. In live combat, how could a commander hide in the rear while her subordinates sacrifice themselves because of her decisions?<br>
People like this are cowards, not tacticians.。<br>
<br>
Even during the exercise, Amagi conducted herself in the same way, throwing herself into the thick of combat on the front line.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Amagi：</span><br>
See? By moving forward like this, we have already been rewarded for our efforts. Wait, everyone, stop for a second.<br>
<br>
Amagi bent down to pick up a piece of tattered cloth from the water's surface. Without a doubt, it was a piece of Kaga's outfit.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Amagi：</span><br>
To make it this deep into enemy territory by herself... she is stronger than I gave her credit for.<br>
... What a fool...<br>

<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ashigara：</span><br>
Something's wrong... we've lost contact with the aircraft conducting recon at 9 o'clock.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Amagi：</span><br>
I wanted to make sure Houshou got all her planes back safely, but it looks like that's not an option anymore...<br>
The recon plane was most likely shot down by the Sirens. Since none of the other planes have been able to locate Kaga so far, heading towards 9 o'clock is our best bet.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Naka：</span><br>
Amagi, b-b-big t-trouble!!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Amagi：</span><br>
Naka, what happened?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Naka：</span><br>
B-b-black shadows in the sky... so many of them are flying towards us!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Amagi：</span><br>
This is...!<br>
We're under attack from a carrier-class Siren! All ships, prepare for anti-air measures!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Naka：</span><br>
Eh? A-anti-air measures?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Amagi：</span><br>
Yes, proceed forward in an S-formation with your secondary weapons raised to maximum elevation angle. Shoot those things out of the sky!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Naka：</span><br>
Y-yes ma'am! I will do my best!<br>

<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Amagi：</span><br>
Kaga!!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Kaga(BB)：</span><br>
Amagi...?! What are you doing here?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Amagi：</span><br>
I could ask you the same thing. Why are you doing this?<br>
For the future of the Combined Fleet? The Sakura Empire? Are you trying to sound cool, acting like death will solve all your problems?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Kaga(BB)：</span><br>
I already told you! If I'm going to be converted into something as weak and pathetic as a carrier, I'd rather...<br>
<br>
Slap-!<br>
Before Kaga could finish her sentence, Amagi's palm whipped across her face sharply.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Amagi：</span><br>
Every day, you prattle on about the "strong" and the "weak" as if you were the tragic hero of some opera. But while you wallow in fantasies of your own making, your comrades now bleed because of your selfishness!<br>
From the very beginning, the world has never judged who is weak or strong. You are just using that as an excuse to escape from reality.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Kaga(BB)：</span><br>
... ... ....<br>
Then tell me... now that I am shackled by the Treaty, how am I supposed to fight?!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Amagi：</span><br>
I've already taken care of that. I consulted Nagato-sama before coming here.<br>
As long as you can make it back to port and display your power at the next wargame, you can prevent being decommissioned.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Kaga(BB)：</span><br>
... Really?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Amagi：</span><br>
What reason would I have to lie to you?<br>
<br>
Kaga could only stare at Amagi in surprise, as if not allowing herself to believe that a path still was in front of her. <br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Amagi：</span><br>
But before we get ahead of ourselves... we have to find some way to get everyone out of here safely.<br>
<br>
Amagi turned once more to face the sky darkened by enemy aircraft. Drawing a deep breath, she steeled her resolve and focused her energy towards commanding the fleet.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Amagi：</span><br>
Do not lose hope! Our recon planes have already located the Siren carrier's location. If we hold out here, we will be able to break through!<br>
Everyone, prepare for anti-air combat! We have but one target - the Siren carrier!<br>
{{折叠面板|内容结束}}

{{折叠面板|标题=Echoes VI|选项=16|主框=1|样式=primary|展开=否}}
<br>
With the defeat of the Siren carrier, the enemy planes soon fell into disarray without their mastermind and became fodder for the heavy anti-air fire.<br>
However, the surviving planes began to ascend out of reach of the anti-air guns, as if waiting for an opportunity to counterattack.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ashigara：</span><br>
Amagi, we're running out of ammo! Please give the order to retreat!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Amagi：</span><br>
What a terrifying strategy... sending consecutive airstrikes while we are unable to contest the airspace...<br>
If we make it back to port, we have to think of some countermeasures... and develop new equipment to combat this threat... *cough* *cough*<br>
<br>
Amagi suddenly began to cough laboriously.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Kaga(BB)：</span><br>
Amagi, you-<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Amagi：</span><br>
Time is running out. We have got to get you out of...<br>
<br>
Before she could finish her words, Amagi suddenly collapsed like a puppet with its strings cut.<br>
Kaga sprung forth and caught her before she could fall.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Kaga(BB)：</span><br>
Hey! Amagi! Pull yourself together!<br>
Amagi!!<br>
<br>
Sensing an opportunity, a Siren aircraft swooped down towards the disabled Amagi, screeching as a bomb emerged from its underside.<br>
There was a flash, and then a terrible explosion-<br>
Kaga clung tightly to Amagi, shielding her from the blast with her body. In an instant, her armor was split apart from the force of the explosion, her clothing in tatters.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Amagi：</span><br>
*cough* ... You fool... why didn't you dodge...?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Kaga(BB)：</span><br>
Heh. Don't underestimate the armor of a real battleship. You just behave yourself and let us tow you back to port-<br>
<br>
BOOOOOM!!<br>
Another bomb detonated above them. Though off its mark, the explosion caused a massive pillar of water to erupt near them.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Kaga(BB)：</span><br>
...Gah! Persistent bastards!<br>
<br>
Kaga turned to survey the fleet - battered, bruised, and running out of ammunition. As their anti-air fire dwindled, more and more bullets began to rain down around Kaga and Amagi.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Kaga(BB)：</span><br>
At this rate, we're all going to be wiped out! What should I do?!<br>
Amagi, surely you don't plan to lose here!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Amagi：</span><br>
Just... a little more...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Kaga(BB)：</span><br>
What? A little more what? Amagi!<br>
<br>
The Sakura fleet, which had long prided its resplendent main batteries that towered towards the heavens, had no experience dealing with a carrier's relentless attacks.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Kaga(BB)：</span><br>
You should never have come here... I alone should bear the consequences for my mistakes...<br>
<br>
"When your resolve is weak, you risk not only your life but also the lives of your comrades."<br>
Just when Kaga began to come to terms with what would be her humiliating end-<br>
In a plume of smoke, a number of enemy aircraft began to careen out of control and fall from the sky.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Amagi：</span><br>
*cough* *cough* Looks like... they made it in time...<br>
<br>
A number of biplanes, emblazoned with the bright insignia of the Sakura Empire, rushed forth, splitting the dark skies.<br>
Caught off guard, the Siren aircraft were mowed down until not a single one remained.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Kaga(BB)：</span><br>
What... are these?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Amagi：</span><br>
These are Houshou's... and the Sakura Empire's... first carrier-based aircraft.<br>
As expected of Houshou, being able to master her aircraft at such a critical time...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Kaga(BB)：</span><br>
But... how did they manage to find us?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Amagi：</span><br>
Well, before this even began, I told Houshou... if a recon plane was lost, to immediately scramble her fighters in that direction...<br>
We have to use every resource at our disposal... after all, we aren't the only ones with carriers... the Sirens too...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Kaga(BB)：</span><br>
That's just like you, Amagi. You're not called the "Phantom of the Sakura Empire" for nothing.<br>
I'll do as you said. I'll return to port and become the strongest sword of the Sakura Empire, able to cut down any foe.<br>
So, just hold on a bit longer! Everyone, we're going home!<br>

<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Kaga(BB)：</span><br>
How's the situation looking?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Hatakaze：</span><br>
She finally regained consciousness just earlier, but I don't have much more good news for you. She's going to need more rest, and won't be taking any visitors today.<br>
Hatakaze shook her head as she explained the situation to Kaga, her voice on the verge of cracking.<br>
During her examination, we found out that Amagi's wisdom cube had been severely damaged. Nobody knows exactly what caused it though...<br>
As a matter of fact, she most likely has been dealing with this for some time now.<br>
The problem must have flared up when she overexerted herself earlier on the Mirror Sea...<br>
However, I'm worried that...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Kaga(BB)：</span><br>
That what?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Hatakaze：</span><br>
... that in this state, she won't even be able to have a normal civilian life, let alone receive her carrier remodel.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Kaga(BB)：</span><br>
... ...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Hatakaze：</span><br>
Just consider this the worst case scenario. I haven't spoken a word of this to anyone else....<br>
... even to the one who is currently undergoing her remodel.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Kaga(BB)：</span><br>
... ...<br>
<br>
Kaga staggered off in a stupor, as if unable to accept what she just heard.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Amagi：</span><br>
Hatakaze...?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Hatakaze：</span><br>
I'm right here, Amagi.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Amagi：</span><br>
There's... just one more thing left to do... please...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Hatakaze：</span><br>
Of course. I will make sure it is done.<br>
<br>
And with that, the day of destiny arrived.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Nagato：</span><br>
I am Nagato, flagship of the Combined Fleet. Subjects of the Sakura Empire, lend me your ear!<br>
As you may have heard, Sirens encroached upon our waters when we were ill prepared.<br>
They captured and converted one of our training grounds into a Mirror Sea. We must take heed and learn from the consequences of our strategic oversight.<br>
As a result, the Combined Fleet shall strengthen its perimeter defenses, patrolling and establishing garrisons on remote islands. We are also forming a plan to reclaim what was taken from us.<br>
Therefore, in order to strengthen our torpedo squadrons and our main fleets to defend against potential large-scale Siren invasions, we shall hold another Naval Exercise!<br>
Like last time, Red Team will be on the offensive, and Blue Team will be on the defensive!<br>
Those of you who wish to leave a strong impression, do your best to display your formidable power and your graceful technique!<br>
By my decree, the island defense wargame shall now commence!<br>
(Amagi... is this what you wanted...?)<br>

<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Kaga(BB)：</span><br>
Amagi, what's the meaning of this? Why are you at this exercise?<br>
<span style="color:#ff0000;">Amagi：</span><br>
I take it that Hatakaze has already told you... about the condition of my body.<br>
The world has already begun to change. The era of large capital ships and cannons will soon come to an end.<br>
From here on out... is the era of the aircraft carrier.<br>
Perhaps you'll find this laughable... but I want to feel the pulse of my cannons firing while I am still a battlecruiser... one last time.<br>
That is why I chose to come here.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Kaga(BB)：</span><br>
... ...<br>
<span style="color:#ff0000;">Amagi：</span><br>
Come, Kaga, if you still consider me your rival. You have yet to best me even a single time, right?<br>
If you dare go easy on me, I won't forgive you for the rest of my life.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Kaga(BB)：</span><br>
...Understood. I truly am blessed... aren't I?<br>
To have an opponent like you who can be true to herself until the very end, Amagi... I truly am blessed.<br>
...I am the Tosa-class battleship Kaga!<br>
<span style="color:#ff0000;">Amagi：</span><br>

<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Amagi：</span><br>
You've become stronger. I won't be able to use the same old tricks on you... *chuckles*<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Kaga(BB)：</span><br>
I learned from the best, after all...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Amagi：</span><br>
With that, I have nothing else to teach you. Mmhmm, your big sister is proud of you~<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Kaga(BB)：</span><br>
W-wait, "big sister?"<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Amagi：</span><br>
... Kaga, listen to me!<br>
Amagi's expression quickly changed from jovial to serious as she looked Kaga in the eye.<br>
I have said before that the world does not judge who is strong and who is weak.<br>
I, Amagi, was born into this world flawed- what you would call weak.<br>
However, because I wanted to protect Akagi, and everyone else in the fleet, even this weakling tried to become "strong."<br>
That is why I desperately threw myself at my studies and training, so that people would assume that I was naturally "strong."<br>
Perhaps you have realized it as well. In the end, I was not able to attain true strength.<br>
Though many have not yet realized it, the seas will soon be ruled by aircraft carriers.<br>
And when that time comes, you and Akagi will form the foundation for the Sakura Fleet's future.<br>
You will encounter opponents just like you from all across the world - nay, even stronger than you.<br>
But remember to never underestimate your enemies, and always strive to become stronger.<br>
Unlike me, who was born a weakling, you were born strong. And you are destined to become even stronger.<br>
For you and Akagi, your strength is both your birthright and your obligation.。<br>
Therefore, remember me not as Amagi "the weak," but rather as Amagi "the strong." Pick up my mantle and become that strength that I could only represent.<br>
Please, protect the Sakura Empire in my stead...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">{namecode:161}：</span><br>
... ... And please take care of my sister, Akagi...<br>

<span style="color:#ff0000;">Kaga：</span><br>
Big sister... Akagi...? What... happened to me?<br>
<span style="color:#ff0000;">Akagi：</span><br>
Nothing in particular. Although, you sure took a beating during that last battle and slept all the way until now.<br>
And while you were asleep, you kept calling out a rather nostalgic name... *giggles*<br>
<span style="color:#ff0000;">Kaga：</span><br>
Right... I remember an explosion... Have I already been repaired?<br>
<span style="color:#ff0000;">Akagi：</span><br>
Who knows~? I just woke up not too long ago myself. More importantly, have you seen the brooch I always wear?<br>
Just where could I have dropped it...? Don't tell me that someone was after it...! If that's the case, I'll have to prepare some "punishment" for them...<br>
<span style="color:#ff0000;">Kaga：</span><br>

(Even though she looks the same, her personality couldn't be more different...)<br>

Are you still sleeptalking? Let's hurry up and get back to our "Sanctuary." I have much "planning" to do~<br>
Of course, my "plans" are proceeding smoothly. Just a little more...<br>
Soon, we will be able to meet "her." Ahaha...<br>

<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Amagi：</span><br>
Nagato, I hope you've been well.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Nagato：</span><br>
Amagi. What would you request of me?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Amagi：</span><br>
If you pardon my rudeness, I would like to make a request on behalf of Kaga.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Nagato：</span><br>
Very well. Speak.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Amagi：</span><br>
As you know, the treaty allows any two large capitol ships to be converted to aircraft carriers. I seek to rescind the decommissioning of Battleship Kaga based upon the Treaty's demands.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Nagato：</span><br>
Hmm... Amagi, nobody wishes for this outcome, but the Treaty is binding once signed. Your request would be three ships... Unless...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Amagi：</span><br>
Unless someone takes her place, correct?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Nagato：</span><br>
From the very beginning, the world has never judged who is weak or strong. You are just using that as an excuse to escape from reality.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Amagi：</span><br>
Nagato, you should already know that I am not fit to serve as the flagship of the Combined Fleet. Sooner or later, the role must be entrusted to someone else.<br>
While she may not be up to the task just yet, if you were to pass on the role to Kaga, I would be able to rest easy knowing that I was able to serve the Sakura Empire, even with this flawed body.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Nagato：</span><br>
Is this truly what you desire?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Amagi：</span><br>
Without a doubt. Right now, Kaga is alone in the Mirror Sea due to her despair, but I will personally bring her back.<br>
Should we be able to return safely, I humbly request that you consider my decision, and hold another wargame to see that Kaga can become an aircraft carrier.<br>
Thank you for entertaining my selfish requests, but this is my... *cough* *cough*...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Nagato：</span><br>
It can't be...<br>
Understood, speak no more. Your request shall be granted.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Amagi：</span><br>
Thank you for your graciousness, Nagato...<br>
I have already asked Houshou to train the two of them in aviation techniques.<br>
Those two have the strength and talent to become the core of the Combined Fleet. Please rest assured, Nagato.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Nagato：</span><br>
I shall pray for your safe return. <br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Amagi：</span><br>
Thank you very much. I am sorry for troubling you.<br>

Kaga, this jade brooch is for you. Wear it, and it shall keep you safe.<br>
Actually, I also have another one for Akagi. The one I'm giving you is pair- I mean, a spare.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Kaga(BB)：</span><br>
(Amagi, why are you giving me something like this all of a sudden... ? Don't tell me...)<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Amagi：</span><br>
What's with that conflicted expression? I just picked it up while passing by a flea market. Don't think too hard about it~<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Kaga(BB)：</span><br>
(Having that said, isn't this the first time Amagi has given me something?) I-I'll be sure to treasure it.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Amagi：</span><br>
