I wake up to the first rays of dawn, my body still weary from work.<br>
The moment I open my eyes, I notice that my room has been tidied up. The documents I left strewn across my nightstand are now neatly sorted.<br>
And on a sticky note left on the fridge by the girl who accomplished this monumental task was a polite invitation:<br>
"Commander, I would love for you to come visit my new teahouse. Let's spend a moment of peace and quiet together, and enjoy a cup of tea~"<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Chang Feng：</span><br>
So, I take up the invitation and arrive at the teahouse.<br>
A warm fragrance of tea fills the air, sweeping away what remains of my sleepiness. I see Chang Feng sitting before a tea table, sipping freshly-brewed tea. She smiles gently at me.<br>
Oh, Commander. I'm glad you decided to come~<br>
You were sleeping so soundly this morning that I took the liberty of tidying up your room first.<br>
Isn't it always better to start the day in a fresh and cozy environment?<br>
But more importantly, why don't you come sit next to me?<br>
To share this wonderful new experience together, Commander, I've even changed into a new outfit to suit the occasion. I hope it's to your liking.<br>
Chang Feng invitingly pats the seat next to her. I sit down and am immediately captivated by the elegant decor of the teahouse.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">{playername}：</span><br>
You look really good, and so fitting for such an elegant place.<br>
Was this place decorated with a special occasion in mind as well?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Chang Feng：</span><br>
Heehee. Nothing escapes you, Commander~<br>
Indeed, today is a very important day – which is why I said, I want to "share this wonderful new experience" with you.<br>
As she speaks, Chang Feng carefully offers a teacup, holding it gently in her palms, and places it before me.<br>
I recently obtained this Ru-ware tea set. The ceramics are sky-blue in color, with a smoothness reminiscent of jade. They are masterpieces among the works of the renowned Ru kilns in the Empery.<br>
This room was decorated specifically to enhance one's appreciation of this tea set.<br>
Only such clear and pristine sunlight can fully bring out the luster of Ru ware.<br>
What do you think of it, Commander?<br>
<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项1：It certainly is beautiful.</span>'''''<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项2：I don't think I've seen any material like this before.</span>'''''<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Chang Feng：</span><br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项1）</span>'''''Just as we say that good wine fears not being hidden, the value of exceptional ware is self-evident.<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项1）</span>'''''But, these pieces are not only beautiful. There's also a wonderful meaning behind them.<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项1）</span>'''''Did you know that this sky-blue color is the rarest kind of all?<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项1）</span>'''''Our ancestors described it as such: "After the rain's passing comes blue skies, after the cloud's parting comes new hues." That has a rather romantic sound to it, don't you think?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Chang Feng：</span><br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项2）</span>'''''It resembles jade, yet isn't jade – and even surpasses it. They say a noble person is like jade; this Ru ware, too, feels warm to the touch, like such a person's presence...<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项2）</span>'''''Oh my... I got a bit carried away and ended up holding your hand on accident...<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项2）</span>'''''Ehehe... But, in any case, the process required to create this texture is quite sophisticated, from the mixing to the glazing to the firing.<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项2）</span>'''''Look carefully. Do you see these delicate patterns? They are crackles that naturally form in the glaze.<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项2）</span>'''''They can take the patterns of fish scales, crab claws, or fish eggs... Actually, just talking about it is making me hungry.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Chang Feng：</span><br>
Now then, Commander, please help yourself to some snacks. I'll have fresh tea for you ready soon.<br>
With deft motions, Chang Feng pours hot water into the Ru teaware and starts to brew the tea.<br>
The wait gives me a chance to notice the beautiful Ru vase nearby, holding a lovely bouquet of flowers.<br>
Suddenly, a beam of warm sunshine enters the room, illuminating the sky-blue vase with the glow of dawn.<br>
Exquisite, isn't it? The marvel of this sky-blue glaze, it's said, is the way it plays with the light, showing different depths and hues.<br>
Commander, thanks to you, we are able to witness this spectacle unfolding right before our eyes.<br>
Okay. The tea is now ready~<br>
Commander, please see for yourself if my skill has improved~<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">{playername}：</span><br>
Hmm... You're right. Today's tea is indeed mellower and smoother than before.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Chang Feng：</span><br>
Heehee. That beautiful sky-blue teacup right next to your lips... Ahh, I really wish I could capture this moment~<br>
Oh my, I'm sorry for letting my imagination run wild...<br>
Ahem... In any case, you can see now how the tea and the ware truly complement each other. It probably also helps that I'm using the freshest spring water.<br>
If you pay close attention, you can hear the burbling of the water outside.<br>
The clear sound of water flowing through the bamboo tube drifts in, bringing with it cool, fresh air.<br>
I once heard a rather lovely misconception – that Ru kilns had to be opened just as a downpour stopped, believing that precise timing, seemingly ordained by the heavens, was key to achieving this unique glaze...<br>
Romanticized as this idea may be, don't you think it captures the mood of this moment perfectly?<br>
There's no need to be polite, Commander. How about another cup of tea?<br>
The sky-blue cup feels warm and smooth in my palm; its gentle heat, combined with the fragrance of the tea, seems to soothe my very soul.<br>
In this moment of leisure and elegance, all the stress that had been building up within me wafts away, leaving a deep sense of tranquility.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">{playername}：</span><br>
Yes please, if you don't mind.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Chang Feng：</span><br>
Of course I don't mind. Being able to treat you like this is my utmost pleasure~♪<br>
Please spend the rest of your free time enjoying the Ru ware's company – and mine, too~<br>
