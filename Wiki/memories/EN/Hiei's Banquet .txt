Hiei's Banquet<br>
<br>
Chapter 1: The Spirited Secretary<br>
Port - Office<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Hiei：</span><br>
Hum~ hm hmm~♪<br>
<br>
When I arrived at the office, my secretary, Hiei, had already started working.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Hiei：</span><br>
Oh my, Commander? I'm terribly sorry for not waking you up sooner.<br>
But when I reflected upon how hard you work every day, I thought you deserved to sleep 10 more minutes.<br>
<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项1："Thanks for always being so thoughtful."</span>'''''<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Hiei：</span><br>
Not at all, it's only natural to look out after you as your secretary ship.<br>
However... I'd appreciate it if you could keep this a secret from the others.<br>
Especially from Haruna and Kongou... If they heard about this, I'd get an earful for "pampering the Commander too much."<br>
Anyway, the tea is now ready. Please do enjoy it.<br>
<br>
As expected of someone who studied abroad with the Royal Navy. Hiei's skill at making tea was easily on par with that of the Royal girls.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Hiei：</span><br>
... Since you're done, I'll now go over today's itinerary.<br>
First, here is the inventory for our commission rewards, as well as a roster for today's training exercises...<br>
And here are the material and equipment orders from the research lab.<br>
<br>
Hiei's itinerary and reports were flawless as usual. However, there was something I was concerned about...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Hiei：</span><br>
Hm? What's the matter, Commander? Oh my, is there something stuck on my cheek?<br>
<br>
For whatever reason, Hiei seemed to be in an especially good mood.<br>

Hiei's Banquet<br>
<br>
Chapter 2: A Formal Invitation<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Hiei：</span><br>
I'm in... an especially good mood? And you're curious as to why?<br>
"Did something good happen," huh...? It's as you say, but... I suppose you forgot, Commander. Actually...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Kongou：</span><br>
I finally found it, Hiei. I almost forgot that you were the secretary today... Ahem! I've managed to get everything that you asked for.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Hiei：</span><br>
Oh my. Thank you for all your help~<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Kongou：</span><br>
I'm also looking forward to it. I've never been disappointed by an event you've hosted.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Hiei：</span><br>
I'm glad to hear that.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Kongou：</span><br>
And Commander, this is for you. Since you're already in the room, I might as well give it to you directly...<br>
<br>
Kongou handed me a white envelope with golden lace. It seemed like an invitation of some sort.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Hiei：</span><br>
Sorry for the formalities, but there's a certain way we have to do these things~♪<br>
<br>
When I opened the envelope, I found a small card inside.<br>
Upon the card were several lines of carefully handwritten words.<br>
Commander, we cordially invite you<br>
to attend the upcoming banquet to be held at 7 PM this Saturday.<br>
We hope that you will be able to take time out of your busy schedule to attend.<br>
I do hope to see you there.<br>
Sincerely, Hiei<br>

Hiei's Banquet<br>
<br>
Chapter 3: Reasons<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Hiei：</span><br>
Do you remember now? The thing we were talking about before...<br>
<br>
That's right, you mentioned something about a banquet...<br>
A few days prior, near the Port<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Kirishima：</span><br>
That's the end of the sea patrol... All right, nothing out of the ordinary.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Haruna：</span><br>
I'm not exactly a fan of fighting, but it gets boring when all our regular patrols are this uneventful...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Hiei：</span><br>
We should cherish the peace we have today. Nobody knows when it will be shattered by war.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Kirishima：</span><br>
Haruna, if you're that bored, why don't we go spar a bit?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Haruna：</span><br>
Hmph! Come at me! I'll take you on any time!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Hiei：</span><br>
I'm glad you two are in good spirits... but we're still on a mission. Would you mind putting it off until after we return to port?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">{namecode:73}&{namecode:72}：</span><br>
Yes, ma'am...<br>
<br>
Though Hiei's words were gentle, she had an unexpectedly intimidating aura.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Hiei：</span><br>
Phew... I suppose that settles it. Let's start heading back to port.<br>
Good work, everyone~<br>
<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项1："You all did a great job."</span>'''''<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Hiei：</span><br>
Hehe~ Commander, the same goes for you. Speaking of which...<br>
What better way to reward everyone's hard work than with a banquet!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">{namecode:73}&{namecode:72}：</span><br>
Hooray! It's banquet time!!<br>
<br>
Now that I think about it, something like that did happen...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Hiei：</span><br>
How forgetful you are, Commander~<br>
And I was looking forward to you helping me this time...<br>
<br>
Sorry about that...<br>

Hiei's Banquet<br>
<br>
Chapter 4: Preparations<br>
In the end, I decided to help with Hiei's banquet preparations.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Hiei：</span><br>
Kongou and the others are busy with their errands, so next up is...<br>
Finalizing our menu and sending out the rest of the invitations.<br>
<br>
Port - Shop<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Akashi：</span><br>
Can I help you, nya~?<br>
Hm... nya?! Commander... and Hiei as well, nya?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Hiei：</span><br>
Akashi, did you manage to get what I asked you for?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Akashi：</span><br>
Of course, nya! I've got all the food ingredients and drinks taken care of, nya!<br>
Thanks for your patronyage, nya~!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Hiei：</span><br>
The pleasure is mine. Thank you for handling all my orders so diligently every time.<br>
Hehe~ Here you go.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Akashi：</span><br>
Nya? This is... an invitation, nya! Akashi is also invited?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Hiei：</span><br>
Of course. The more, the merrier. Oh, would you also mind asking Shiranui if she wants to come?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Kongou：</span><br>
Look, you don't need to keep calling us... I know, just take it easy, we'll be there on time.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Kirishima：</span><br>
Waiting for one of Hiei's banquets to start always makes me excited~!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Haruna：</span><br>
*sigh*... As long as you don't make a mess of things~<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Kirishima：</span><br>
Huh? I don't remember doing anything...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Hiei：</span><br>
Hehe, it's not your fault, Kirishima. There's bound to be craziness when we have an open bar.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Kirishima：</span><br>
Well, um... my bad, I guess. It's hard to say no when so many people are goading me on. I'll make sure to watch myself this time though.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Hiei：</span><br>
I wonder if everything is in order now... Thanks for helping with the preparations, Commander~♪<br>

Hiei's Banquet<br>
<br>
Chapter 5: Different Strokes for Different Folks<br>
Port - Canteen<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Hiei：</span><br>
Have all our guests arrived?<br>
Thank you so much for coming here tonight, valiant friends of the Sakura Empire.<br>
Please take this opportunity tonight to wash away your fatigue and deepen your friendships. Do enjoy this banquet hosted by yours truly, Hiei.<br>
<br>
As the Manjuu band began to play, Hiei's banquet officially began.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Yuudachi：</span><br>
Meeaaaaat!! Ehehe, I loooove Hiei's banquets~!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Shigure：</span><br>
Ewww! Yuudachi, at least make an effort to observe some table manners! Kongou and the others are staring at us!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Yuudachi：</span><br>
Omnom! Even if that's true, I'm not puttin' this meat down. If you want some, you're gonna have to get your own!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Shigure：</span><br>
You little...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Kirishima：</span><br>
You'd like to dance with me? Hehe, sure. Anything for a beautiful lady like you~☆<br>
You brought this cake just for me? Why, thank you very much~☆<br>
You'd like me to keep you company for one more song? Certainly. I don't mind at all~☆<br>
Hahaha! Everyone, cheeers!!<br>
<br>
From a distance, the banquet organizer was watching everyone, all by herself.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Hiei：</span><br>
Hehe. Everyone has their way of enjoying the banquet.<br>
<br>
Hiei smiled gently as she surveyed the scene.<br>
However, she was the only person who wasn't participating...<br>

Hiei's Banquet<br>
<br>
Chapter 6: A Table for Two<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Hiei：</span><br>
Oh my, Kirishima is quite the popular one.<br>
Being able to handle that kind of attention... takes some natural talent and charm.<br>
<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项1："Hiei, you're pretty charming yourself."</span>'''''<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Hiei：</span><br>
My my, aren't you the sweet talker, Commander. How many girls have you used that line on? Hehe~♪<br>
<br>
For a moment, it seemed like Hiei's face was a lovely blush of red... but maybe it was just an illusion.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Akashi：</span><br>
I found Hiei with the Commander, nya!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Shiranui：</span><br>
Good evening, Commander. Good evening, Hiei. Thank you for the invitation.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Hiei：</span><br>
I'm glad you two could make it. Have you been enjoying the banquet so far?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Shiranui：</span><br>
As expected from an Imperial Ship. The food garners nothing but praise.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Akashi：</span><br>
Akashi supplied the ingredients, nya!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Shiranui：</span><br>
Even though Hiei obviously was the one who planned the menu... Ah, forget it. This tea is splendid.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Kongou：</span><br>
This is black tea that was ordered straight from the Royal Islands. Of course the flavor is peerless!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Akashi：</span><br>
Nyaaa?! Y-you scared me... It's just Kongou, nya...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Hiei：</span><br>
Thank you very much, Kongou.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Kongou：</span><br>
Say nothing of it! Speaking of which, it'd be a pity if you spent all your time standing out here. After all the work you put in, you might as well join in...<br>
Ah, or perhaps... I get it now. Akashi, Shiranui, let's continue talking over there instead.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Akashi：</span><br>
Why should I... unyaaa!? Don't pick me up like that! I can walk on my own, nya!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Shiranui：</span><br>
Ah, um... Commander, Hiei, see you two later.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Kongou：</span><br>
How joyous youth is. Let's leave them alone for a while, hehe~<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Hiei：</span><br>
Oh my, Kongou certainly has her way of doing things...<br>
<br>
For whatever reason, it felt like I had the most reliable wingwomen in the world...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Hiei：</span><br>
Well, since we don't get to spend time together like this very often...<br>
Commander, would you do me the honor of accompanying me for this dance?<br>

Hiei's Banquet<br>
<br>
Chapter 7: Moonlit Appassionata<br>
The banquet was drawing to a close.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Akashi：</span><br>
Thanks for everything~ Bye bye, nya~<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Kongou：</span><br>
That was a splendid banquet. I'll be looking forward to the next one<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Haruna：</span><br>
Hiei throws the best banquets after all. Of course everyone was having a great time~<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Kirishima：</span><br>
It helps that she has such a good reputation too~<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Hiei：</span><br>
Hehe. Please be careful on your way back~<br>
Phew... I guess it's over now...<br>
The more joyous the occasion, the more bittersweet it is when it comes to an end...<br>
Wouldn't you agree, Commander?<br>
Hehe~♪ That's not the important thing though. Ultimately, I just want to see everyone get excited and have a great time.<br>
<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项1："Why do you like banquets so much?"</span>'''''<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Hiei：</span><br>
Hmm, how should I put this... The preparations are grueling, you get no compensation for doing it, and when it's over, you feel lonely...<br>
However, during the banquet, you can see how happy everyone is.<br>
We all build up so much stress during our everyday missions... If there's anything I can do to help alleviate some of that...<br>
If you think of these banquets as a form of healing, doesn't that make them seem much more marvelous?<br>
Of course, setting up a banquet is no easy feat...<br>
But being able to see everyone's happiness makes me forget all about the hard work.<br>
<br>
The silver moonlight falls gently across the harbor. The moon is beautiful tonight...<br>
I recalled the dance I shared with Hiei earlier at the banquet.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Hiei：</span><br>
Another dance... right now? The banquet's already over though, and the music...<br>
<br>
Don't worry. Banquet or not, our appassionata is always playing.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Hiei：</span><br>
Hehe. You're right, the night is still young...<br>
Very well then. Let's begin our moonlit cruise... just the two of us~<br>
