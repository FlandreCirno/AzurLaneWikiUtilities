<br>
1 A Forgotten Promise<br>
After struggling through a hellish amount of work, I finally found myself bathed in the light at the end of the tunnel – a day off, with no forms to fill out and no messages to respond to.<br>
...or so I thought.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Why am I sitting in front of my desk at the office again... Has work found its way into the very core of my existence?<br>
<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项1："Well, since I'm already here..."</span>'''''<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项2：Ponder life a bit more.</span>'''''<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项1）</span>'''''...I might as well get some work done.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项2）</span>'''''Should I try to get a head start on next week's work, or enjoy what little time I have off... What to do...<br>
<br>
Just as I'm about to come to a decision, I suddenly hear someone knocking at the door.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Huh? Joffre?<br>
<br>
The girl standing at the entrance gives a slight nod before marching right up to me.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Joffre：</span><br>
...Mm. Looks like you managed to wake up early, just as promised.<br>
It would appear that I've underestimated your resolve. Please accept my apologies.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
(...Promise? Did I have something planned with Joffre?)<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Joffre：</span><br>
Judging from your expression... Alas, you must've completely forgotten about the promise you made to me.<br>
To think that you'd forget about the promise we made last night come the dawning of the new day...<br>
Such sinfulness must be met with swift punishment–<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
W-wait a sec!<br>
<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项1："I... I remember now!"</span>'''''<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项2："Let me redeem myself!"</span>'''''<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项1）</span>'''''That's right! It's all coming back to me now!<br>
<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项1）</span>'''''Last night, while I was struggling through my paperwork in a stupor, I think I had some semblance of a conversation with Joffre...<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项1）</span>'''''But no matter how hard I rack my brain, I can't recall what came up during that conversation...<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项1）</span>'''''Sorry, that was a lie... I actually can't remember anything at all...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Joffre：</span><br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项1）</span>'''''I appreciate your honesty. However, as I said before, I cannot simply overlook your sins.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项2）</span>'''''*cough* *cough*... Yes, that's right, could you give me an opportunity to set things straight?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Joffre：</span><br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项2）</span>'''''Hmm, that does seem like a just course of action.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Joffre：</span><br>
In that case, I shall give you a chance to atone for your sins through your actions.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Understood! By the way, what kind of promise did we make again? It seems awfully important...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Joffre：</span><br>
......<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
(Is it just me, or did Joffre just avert her eyes for a second...?)<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Joffre：</span><br>
That's not something I can tell you right now.<br>
First, let us do our morning prayers while there is still time.<br>

<br>
2 A Prayer of Atonement<br>
And so, I accompanied Joffre to the chapel.<br>
Though we were supposed to be praying together, I actually ended up sitting there on the bench, watching her pray the entire time.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Joffre：</span><br>
...The Holy Iris' blessings upon you.<br>
<br>
She was kneeling on the ground, her two hands clasped together in front of her chest in prayer. The sunlight pouring through the high window cast a brilliant light across her serene features.<br>
That enchanting sight made it seem as if she was radiating piety itself, making me hold my breath out of fear of disturbing the "angel" with eyes closed in front of me.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Joffre：</span><br>
Mm... That should do it. It's your turn next, Commander.<br>
<br>
She opens her eyes and turns her gaze towards me.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Joffre：</span><br>
Considering that you're not very familiar with the act of prayer, allow me to guide you through the process.<br>
<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项1："Actually, it just occurred to me..."</span>'''''<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项2：Nod along.</span>'''''<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项1）</span>'''''Maybe we shouldn't after all... Y'know, it might be disrespectful and all to just go through the motions...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Joffre：</span><br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项1）</span>'''''Hmm, that is true. Since it's not a part of your customs, I shouldn't force it upon you.<br>
<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项2）</span>'''''As soon as I signal my approval, Joffre grabs my hand.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Joffre：</span><br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项2）</span>'''''Try putting your hands together like this.<br>
<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项2）</span>'''''The angel's hands cover mine and press into them gently.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Joffre：</span><br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项2）</span>'''''Mm. Now, whenever you put your hands together, remember the amount of pressure I just demonstrated.<br>
<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项2）</span>'''''Due to her calm demeanor, it's always hard to tell what Joffre is thinking.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Joffre：</span><br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项2）</span>'''''The next step is...<br>
<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项2）</span>'''''She walks behind me, strokes my cheeks with her slender fingers, then covers my eyes with her palms.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Joffre：</span><br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项2）</span>'''''Close your eyes, and repeat after me.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项2）</span>'''''...Okay.<br>
<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项2）</span>'''''We're so close that if I lean back slightly, I would be able to indulge in the warmth and softness of her touch.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Joffre：</span><br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项2）</span>'''''In the name of the Holy Iris...<br>
<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项2）</span>'''''For whatever reason, Joffre seems to be leaning into me.<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项2）</span>'''''As she presses into me, I can feel her warmth deepening against my back, sending electric currents through my body. I completely lose the ability to process her words.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Joffre：</span><br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项2）</span>'''''It seems you're having trouble concentrating...<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项2）</span>'''''......<br>
<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项2）</span>'''''Before I know it, the palms obscuring my vision are lifted, and when I turn around to look at Joffre, she seems to be deep in thought.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Joffre：</span><br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项2）</span>'''''As expected, it's difficult to do things you're not accustomed to.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项2）</span>'''''The whole morning prayers thing?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Joffre：</span><br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项2）</span>'''''Mm, you can think of it that way.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Joffre：</span><br>
Now then, a change of venues is in order. Please come with me.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Oh, umm... Okay.<br>
(Joffre is acting a bit strange today after all...)<br>

<br>
3 The Trial of the Crane Game<br>
The two of us leave the chapel and head towards the port city's shopping mall.<br>
For whatever reason, a row of crane games with cat paw prints are lining the side of the street.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
(What is Akashi up to this time...)<br>
<br>
Joffre comes to a stop when she walks up to one of the crane game machines, her eyes fixed on the plushies inside.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Joffre：</span><br>
What are these...?<br>
<br>
It would appear that the battle-hardened Angel of the Iris has never seen a crane game before.<br>
<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项1：(Do they not have these in the Iris Orthodoxy?)</span>'''''<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项2："Wanna give it a spin together?"</span>'''''<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项1）</span>'''''(––I almost blurted these words out, but caught myself in time.)<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项1）</span>'''''(What's important is that I show her how to have a good time.)<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Since this opportunity doesn't come around too often, I don't mind showing you the ropes.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Joffre：</span><br>
...Show me.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
So, first, you need to insert a coin here. Then, use this joystick to control the claw.<br>
If you think you've found a good spot, press this button to send the claw down. It's harder than it looks, though, and you'll have to find the right center of gravity to pick up the plushie.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Joffre：</span><br>
First here... then press here... Understood.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
(Wait, why do those plushies... look awfully like me...?)<br>
(What on earth is that green cat up to now...)<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Joffre：</span><br>
I think I get the hang of it. Shall we give it a try, Commander?<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Sure, give me a moment to grab some tokens.<br>
<br>
I went to convert my money into tokens at an extremely unreasonable exchange rate, and so began my first "trial" of the day with Joffre.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Joffre：</span><br>
Adjust the position... and find the right timing...<br>
<br>
The crane slowly descends, the claw seeming like it would be able to lift the plushie at first, but ultimately barely making it move.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Joffre：</span><br>
...You're right, it certainly is harder than it looks.<br>
Mind if I try again, Commander?<br>
<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项1："Go for it."</span>'''''<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项2：(Show Joffre the bucket full of tokens you just exchanged.)</span>'''''<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项1）</span>'''''All the tokens in this bucket are all yours. Keep going as long as you'd like to.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Joffre：</span><br>
With this many chances, I can't settle for any outcome short of complete victory.<br>
...<br>
Undoubtedly, this is a trial meant to shake my resolve... But, I won't give up so easily.<br>
...<br>
...One more time!<br>
<br>
The number of tokens in the bucket continues to dwindle, but Joffre seems no closer to being able to pass her trial.<br>

<br>
4 The Truth of the "Promise"<br>
After using up the remainder of the tokens, Joffre shuffled over and sat down next to me on the bench.<br>
As if unable to accept her inability to pass her 'trial,' she hides her face behind the me-shaped plushie in her arms.<br>
<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项1："It takes a while to get the hang of it."</span>'''''<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项2：Pat Joffre on the head.</span>'''''<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项1）</span>'''''Nobody wins their first time.<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项1）</span>'''''(And plus, given that Akashi is the one behind these machines, I'd be more surprised if it wasn't rigged...)<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Joffre：</span><br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项1）</span>'''''In other words, you never had high expectations for me in the first place?<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项1）</span>'''''No, silly. The whole thing's ultimately a game of luck.<br>
<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项2）</span>'''''I stretch my hand out to ruffle the girl's hair.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Joffre：</span><br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项2）</span>'''''Hmm...?<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项2）</span>'''''At the end of the day, it's still largely a game of luck, so don't feel bad about it.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Joffre：</span><br>
A game... of luck?<br>
If you hadn't stepped in to help me at the end, I would've left empty-handed.<br>
*sigh*... Plus, there's no need to try to console me by saying that it's luck. I'm sure that this is heaven's way of reprimanding me...<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Reprimanding you?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Joffre：</span><br>
Yes, for lying to you.<br>
In actuality, you never made any sort of promise to me last night.<br>
The reason I went to your office this morning was just to check if you were there, so I could ask directly if I could spend some time with you...<br>
But when I saw you groggy and half-asleep, I couldn't help but want to play a prank on you.<br>
To be honest, the look on your face at the time was quite endearing. Heehee.<br>
<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项1："I figured as much."</span>'''''<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项2："I did consider that possibility."</span>'''''<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项1）</span>'''''I already had my suspicions when you said you wouldn't tell me what the promise was about.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项2）</span>'''''I thought that might be the case. I just didn't expect you to come clean so soon.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Joffre：</span><br>
My apologies. I had to come clean sooner or later.<br>
Though I am supposed to be a judge of sins, I ended up being a sinner myself.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
(She looked pretty devastated from not being able to grab the plushie...)<br>
Well, let's put that aside and go back to the beginning. Your "redemption" will be seeing things through properly.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Joffre：</span><br>
But, I originally wanted to go on a date with you... What kind of redemption would continuing that be?<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
It's fine. At least, you came clean with what you did wrong. I forgive you.<br>
All you have to do is do things over again and show your true intentions to the Holy Iris. Surely, it won't take you long to atone for such a minor transgression.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Joffre：</span><br>
...There does seem to be some merit in what you said.<br>
Very well then. I shall atone for my sins by doing my utmost for our date.<br>
<br>
The angel rises to her feet and walks towards me with her hand outstretched.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Wanna hold hands?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Joffre：</span><br>
Of course. Since this is a date of redemption... It is only natural that we start by holding hands.<br>
<br>
I take Joffre's hands. Immediately, her footsteps seem lighter than before as we head out from the shopping mall.<br>

5 The Angel and the Seagull<br>
We continue to walk hand-in-hand, and before long, we arrive on the pier.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Joffre：</span><br>
Let's head down and feel the sea breeze.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Sure.<br>
<br>
A flock of seagulls takes flight from the surface, splashing water in all directions.<br>
Upon seeing this, Joffre immediately spreads the wings on her back to shield me from the incoming seaspray.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
What an angel...<br>
<br>
I couldn't help but gasp in admiration upon seeing the girl's wings spread beneath the bright sunshine.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Joffre：</span><br>
Indeed, that is my title.<br>
By the way, Commander, what do you think a canonical angel looks like anyway?<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Umm... Someone with wings, dressed in a white gown of some sort, with an angel on their head?<br>
Well, the way I see things, I don't think there's much difference between you and a "real" angel.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Joffre：</span><br>
Hmm? May I ask how you came to that conclusion?<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
I guess, uh, the "Angel of the Iris" is an embodiment of purity and justice, one who offers holy words to those in distress.<br>
Isn't that exactly what you are?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Joffre：</span><br>
But, I...<br>
<br>
I press my finger against Joffre's lips, trying to get her to let me finish.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
I know what you're about to say, but...<br>
You judge sin for the sake of all that is righteous and good in this world.<br>
You fight hard for the sake of a better tomorrow.<br>
That, in my eyes, is what truly makes you an angel.<br>
And that's the part of you that I respect and love.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Joffre：</span><br>
...<br>
Commander, what you just said... sounded a bit like a confession of love.<br>
But... I'm still glad I got to hear you say those words. Heehee.<br>
<br>
With a gentle smile on her face, the angel approached me and pressed her head against my shoulder.<br>
The flock of seagulls that flew away upon our arrival has now returned, nestling up against each other in pairs.<br>
...a bit like me and Joffre in this moment.<br>

<br>
6 Moonlit Angel<br>
After leaving the pier, Joffre and I began our real date.<br>
We went to the aquarium, saw a movie, and then went to ride the Ferris wheel at an amusement park.<br>
We enjoyed as many attractions as we could until the fireworks came on, signaling the closing of the park.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
So, how was it? Did you have a good time?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Joffre：</span><br>
Very much so. I never expected to have this much fun today... It's everything I could've asked for already.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Now then, do you think you've atoned for your "sin"?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Joffre：</span><br>
Yes. Thank you for letting me redeem myself. However...<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
However?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Joffre：</span><br>
Even if I was able to atone for my prior sin, I no longer have the ability to be a fair and impartial judge of your sins.<br>
<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项1："Why's that?"</span>'''''<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项2："What do you mean...?"</span>'''''<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项1）</span>'''''I'm curious why you think that.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Joffre：</span><br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项1）</span>'''''It's because...<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项2）</span>'''''I'm not sure I follow what you're trying to say...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Joffre：</span><br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项2）</span>'''''Allow me to explain.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Joffre：</span><br>
Those in the position of judging sin must be able to maintain absolute fairness, without letting their personal feelings interfere.<br>
However, the events that occurred today have only made me more selfish, as a result of both the original sin I committed as well as the actions I took in "atoning" for them.<br>
I can no longer maintain my impartiality in front of you, and as such, I am no longer qualified to be a judge.<br>
Because... the scales of my heart already tip infinitely in your favor.<br>
<br>
As those words leave her lips, the girl's black wings spread again, and this time, she folds me tightly within them.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Joffre：</span><br>
I am no longer qualified to judge you, but... I still am qualified to love you.<br>
I will take this new role upon myself to its fullest extent, and see to it that you understand my emotions.<br>
<br>
Joffre's silver hair seems to shimmer in the moonlight.<br>
Even though I am surrounded by countless lights of every color imaginable, the light in my eyes comes from her alone.<br>

7 After Our Moment<br>
When all was said and done, it was quite late by the time Joffre and I parted ways.<br>
I went back to my room, got a good night's sleep, and was now getting ready to tackle the challenges of a new workday.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Joffre：</span><br>
Good morning. You're earlier than usual today.<br>
I am Joffre, lead ship of the Joffre-class aircraft carriers. From now on, I shall be serving as your secretary.<br>
Were you able to get enough rest yesterday? How is your energy level right now?<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Slept like a baby, thanks to you.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Joffre：</span><br>
I'm glad to hear that. Here's today's itinerary – please look it over whenever convenient.<br>
<br>
As usual, the morning disappeared in a flurry of paperwork.<br>
I finally plant my stamp on the last document and lean back to stretch–<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Joffre：</span><br>
Here are the documents I organized earlier.<br>
<br>
Another pile of documents instantly materialize on the desk that I had worked so hard to tidy up.<br>

There's still a lot of stuff to get through. Now's no time to be getting absent-minded, correct?<br>
Of course, if you intend to commit the cardinal sin of sloth...<br>
I will show you no mercy.<br>
<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项1："Wait, I thought you said last night–"</span>'''''<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项2："What happened to 'no longer having the right to judge me?!'"</span>'''''<br>

Yes, and I can still call my colleagues over to exact judgment upon you... Just kidding.<br>
This is nothing more than my warning to you as your secretary ship. Or rather, just a word of advice.<br>
On a personal level, if we have to spend long stretches of time together, I would prefer it to be on a date rather than here at work.<br>
Which is why, for both our sakes, you should strive to complete your sacred duties as quickly as possible.<br>
After all, it would be difficult for me to carry out my sacred duty of loving you while on the job.<br>
You do understand, Commander, don't you?<br>
