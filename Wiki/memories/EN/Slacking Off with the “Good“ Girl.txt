Slacking Off with the "Good" Girl<br>
<br>
1.Busy Days<br>
Port - Commander's Office<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Jade：</span><br>
Coming iiin. Your secretary ship is here right on time, Commander. Lucky you!<br>
My... You don't look too hot, Commander. Are you okay?<br>
...Good. Then I will help out as usual... with the easy stuff, of course.<br>
Phew... It got dark in no time, didn't it?<br>
Still, despite how much I've been helping you, your work backlog hasn't shrunk at all. Why is that?<br>
Well, I suppose all I can really do is find typos and the like... The actual decision-making falls to you, in the end. Okay! Good work today, Commander.<br>
<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项1："Thanks for your help, Jade."</span>'''''<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Jade：</span><br>
Aww, you appreciate all my hard work? In that case...<br>
Commander, do you ever find yourself wanting to be a little lazy?<br>
Of course, I don't mean just abandoning your work wholesale. After all, a girl as good as me would never neglect her duties.<br>
What I'm suggesting is... resting, in moderation.<br>
I've noticed that you've been making a lot more typographical errors lately. It seems to me like you're losing concentration due to a lack of rest.<br>
<br>
"I-I can't refute that..."<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Jade：</span><br>
Ergo, I propose laziness in order to raise your work efficiency!<br>
Though, really, all I'm suggesting is that you totally turn off for two hours on a specific day. As long as there aren't any emergencies, you're forbidden from working.<br>
As for what you'll do while you're off work, this good girl will gladly find something for you.<br>
This isn't a naughty excuse; it's a way for good Commanders to raise their efficiency. Persuasive enough, right?<br>
<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项1："Yeah, that's fair."</span>'''''<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Jade：</span><br>
Hahaha! I knew you'd understand.<br>
Why don't we give it a try tomorrow morning?<br>
You don't need to do anything; leave it aaall to me.<br>
So it's settled! I'd best take my leave now.<br>
Oh, I forgot to add one thing. Staying up late is for naughty Commanders, so get to bed early tonight, okay?<br>
<br>
I watched Jade leave as I cleaned up the rest of my documents.<br>
"I guess I'll have to go to sleep early tonight..."<br>

Slacking Off with the "Good" Girl<br>
<br>
2.Time to Get Lazy!<br>
The next day, Jade carried out her plan to make me slack off.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Jade：</span><br>
Thanks for waiting!<br>
<br>
When Jade called out to me, I turned around to find her bringing a big collection of snacks over.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Jade：</span><br>
Our first round of slacking is quite simple, as you can see.<br>
I call it... The Max Guilt Snacks Party!<br>
Indeed, I have brought you all of your favorite snacks, Commander.<br>
Oh, but if you ate so much that it made you too full to work, that would make me a bad girl for ruining your productivity.<br>
As such, you'll have to choose just one to start with.<br>
<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项1："I'll take the chips that look like cones."</span>'''''<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项2："I'd like dark chocolate."</span>'''''<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项3："Gummy sharks, please."</span>'''''<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Jade：</span><br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项1）</span>'''''Oh, do you like these, Commander? Spee recommended I try them a while back.<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项1）</span>'''''I don't think she likes them because of the taste, though. It's more likely because they're fun to put on your fingers.<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项1）</span>'''''Like this... Rawr!<br>
<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项1）</span>'''''Jade put the chips on her fingers and showed them off like an animal stretching its claws out.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Jade：</span><br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项2）</span>'''''Z24 told me that dark chocolate is like a symbol of maturity.<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项2）</span>'''''And then, she threw the whole piece into her mouth and went, "Eww..." It was just hilarious!<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项2）</span>'''''But of course, I'm sure this is nothing to you, Commander.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Jade：</span><br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项3）</span>'''''Ahaha! You know exactly who loves these, don't you?<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项3）</span>'''''That's right: U-110! The two of us cracked a cipher together, and we were given these as a reward.<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项3）</span>'''''These cute gummy sharks might not suit someone as mature as you... Is this what they call "gap"?<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项3）</span>'''''Hahaha, I think they'll be a little too sweet for you, but give them a try!<br>
<br>
I tried eating the one I picked out.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Jade：</span><br>
Oh, hold on a sec.<br>
Didn't I tell you to leave it aaall to me? That includes this...<br>
Open up, Commander.<br>
<br>
I was taken aback by the sudden turn of events.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Jade：</span><br>
Go on. Open up like a good Commander...<br>
<br>
(I'll have to just obey orders for now.)<br>
(Mm. That's not bad.)<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Jade：</span><br>
That look on your face says you like it. Would you like another?<br>
Say "ahh."<br>
Heehee, it feels like I'm feeding a little animal.<br>
By the way, are you thirsty? I brought canned fruit juice and soda with me. Which would you like?<br>
<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项1："Fruit juice."</span>'''''<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项2："Soda."</span>'''''<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Jade：</span><br>
Okay. Then I'll take the other.<br>
By the way, can you open the cans for me?<br>
<br>
"No problem."<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Jade：</span><br>
Thank you. You're such a good Commander.<br>
Aaah... Doesn't it feel like junk food and drinks aren't quite enough?<br>
Do you have any fun stories? For example, hidden treasure in your office, or anything?<br>
Haha, that's just an example. I'm a good girl, so I won't invade your privacy. That's a promise.<br>
Hmm... Okay. Until we think of any fun topics of conversation, let's continue what we were doing before.<br>
Open up, Commander!<br>
We've only just begun, so let's take it slow, okay?♪<br>

Slacking Off with the "Good" Girl<br>
<br>
3.Loafing Around with Friends!<br>
Port - Commander's Office<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Jade：</span><br>
Hello, hello! It's your scheduled slack-off time!<br>
I brought Elbe with me this time. When she heard she'd get to hang out with you, she came running.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Elbe：</span><br>
Naturally! This isn't just a chance to hang out; it's an opportunity to waste the Commander's time and make work even harder. I wouldn't miss this for the world!<br>
Let's waste your valuable time together like the naughty people we are!<br>
Or... So I say, but are you sure it's okay for me to take up the Commander's time, Jade?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Jade：</span><br>
It's okay. You aren't taking up time; you're using it together to be lazy. The Commander understands and consents.<br>
As you can see, our slacking will be a little livelier than usual today. In other words...<br>
Today, we're playing Old Maid with a punishment game on top!<br>
The rules are simple. The first winner gets to choose a punishment for the loser to undergo.<br>
But keep it clean, okay? Nothing cruel or unusual!<br>
Now, let's get it started!<br>
<br>
Before long, our first round had reached the final battle.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Jade：</span><br>
There are two routes at this point. If the Commander pulls something other than the Joker, then Elbe loses.<br>
But if the Commander pulls a Joker, then it'll be Elbe's turn... Of course, that could be fun in its own right.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Elbe：</span><br>
Bring it on, I say! I'll make sure you take the Joker!<br>
<br>
I tried reaching out for the card on the right to see what would happen.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Elbe：</span><br>
!!!<br>
<br>
Elbe was clearly anxious. It'd be harder to not know which one was the Joker at this point.<br>
<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项1：(Go for the left card anyway.)</span>'''''<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项2：(Pick the right card.)</span>'''''<br>
<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项1）</span>'''''As expected, I pulled the Joker.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Elbe：</span><br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项1）</span>'''''Woohoo! Now it's my turn!<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项1）</span>'''''Please no Joker, please no Joker... Anything but a Joker... Here goes!<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项1）</span>'''''Yaaaay! Phew... Now I don't have to take the punishment...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Jade：</span><br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项1）</span>'''''Hahaha. You're too soft on Elbe, Commander.<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项1）</span>'''''In accordance with the rules, you will now have to take a punishment of my choosing, since I was the first to win.<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项1）</span>'''''I know... How about you bark like a cute puppy three times? Easy, no?<br>
<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项1）</span>'''''(This is what I get for letting Elbe win. Well, rules are rules.)<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项1）</span>'''''"Woof, woof! Woof!"<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Jade：</span><br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项1）</span>'''''Aww, good doggy~ Here's a little scritch on the head.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Elbe：</span><br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项1）</span>'''''Th-that's all? If I won, I'd have picked something that would really embarrass the Commander...<br>
<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项2）</span>'''''As expected, Elbe lost.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Elbe：</span><br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项2）</span>'''''Wh-what?! How did you know?!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Jade：</span><br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项2）</span>'''''Heheheh~ Elbe, just admit defeat.<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项2）</span>'''''Don't worry. As a good girl, I won't make things TOO bad for you.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Elbe：</span><br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项2）</span>'''''Urk...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Jade：</span><br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项2）</span>'''''Now, for your punishment...<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项2）</span>'''''How about you kiss the Commander on the cheek? Easy, no?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Elbe：</span><br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项2）</span>'''''Wh-wh-wh-why that?!<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项2）</span>'''''I-I-I could never do that! That's too embarrassing!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Jade：</span><br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项2）</span>'''''Hahaha! I was just teasing you, but I didn't expect you to get so flustered... Out of deference to the Commander, I'll choose something else.<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项2）</span>'''''Hmm... Meow like a cat. That's an easy one.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Elbe：</span><br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项2）</span>'''''Y-you bully... It's embarrassing, but that's at least better... I-I'll do it!<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项2）</span>'''''A-ahem. Meow, meow...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Jade：</span><br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项2）</span>'''''There you go! Well done.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Jade：</span><br>
Now, it's about time we get to round two.<br>

Port - Commander's Office<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Jade：</span><br>
It's that time again, Commander.<br>
Today's theme will be surfing the web!<br>
Come and sit on the couch with me, Commander. I brought snacks again.<br>
<br>
Jade took out her phone and tapped away at it with experienced hands.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Jade：</span><br>
First, we'll search "Commander"...<br>
Sort by new, and... "Spotted the Commander checking supplies in the warehouse! Are you ever not busy?"<br>
Hmm... Well. As far as I can see, everyone's posting about how busy you are these days.<br>
They have no idea that you're slacking off with me... Heehee!<br>
How about we search for something else... Hm? A new message?<br>
<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项1：(Look away.)</span>'''''<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Jade：</span><br>
It's nothing private. I'll reply now, so wait just a moment.<br>
Our supply of snacks is running thin faster than usual? Hmm, what could that possibly have to do with me?<br>
Really, Elbe can't do anything without me, can she?<br>
...<br>
Done! Thank you for waiting, Commander.<br>
Heheh, this time, I'll search the words Jade and Commander together.<br>
<br>
"Zero search results?"<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Jade：</span><br>
Nothing at all... I suppose you've been so occupied with work that nobody knows we're spending time together.<br>
I'm glad our little secret is still safe♪<br>
Besides, being so absorbed in work must mean that you haven't been able to keep an eye on the situation around port.<br>
If you have any questions, I'm always willing to search for you.<br>
For example, if there's anyone you have your mind on... Or if anything just piques your interest.<br>
Hahaha, we still have plenty of time today. Let's really dig into you and the things that are on your mind!<br>

5.An Eventful Day<br>
Port - Commander's Office<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Jade：</span><br>
Phew... This is a good stopping point for the morning's work.<br>
Just in time for us to begin our usual slacking session!<br>
<br>
*knock knock*<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Prinz Eugen：</span><br>
Pardon me. Commander, there's an urgent matter.<br>
The research department's run into a bit of a problem. Yuubari and da Vinci alone can't handle it, so we'd really appreciate your help.<br>
Are you available right now?<br>
<br>
"Sorry, Jade, but I should really go..."<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Jade：</span><br>
If it's urgent, don't worry about me. It can always wait until you get back.<br>
...Better yet, allow me to come with you.<br>
If it's related to the communication modules, I might be able to help.<br>
<br>
"Well, that's finally done and dusted..."<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Baltimore：</span><br>
Excuse me, Commander? There's a problem...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Shimakaze：</span><br>
Ack! Commander, there you are! It's an emergency! P-please, help me out here!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">King George V：</span><br>
Sorry, Commander. I happen to need your help with something...<br>
<br>
After being pulled back and forth by emergency after emergency, I dragged my tired body back to the office.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Jade：</span><br>
When it rains, it pours, hm? That's our Commander for you; despite all of the problems presented to you, you dealt with them with aplomb.<br>
It seems like our recent slacking sessions haven't dulled your skills at all.<br>
...Of course, I think my presence contributed, too♪<br>
Oh, but it's already so late... I think our plans for today have been ruined.<br>
It's not your fault, Commander. If you feel bad about it, then that defeats the point of me trying to help you.<br>
By the way, it's almost your day off, isn't it?<br>
Heehee, what if I were to borrow your day off to make up for today?<br>
Just like our slacking sessions, you can just leave everything to me.<br>
Sounds like a plan. See you then!<br>

6.Idleness: Back with a Vengeance!<br>
Port - Outdoor Pool<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Jade：</span><br>
My, you're early. So you're the punctual type? What a good Commander.<br>
It's too hot out, so I went ahead and changed into my swimsuit!<br>
Would you like some of my popsicle, Commander?<br>
*lick* ♥<br>
<br>
Jade first licked her popsicle before holding it out to me.<br>
<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项1："Sure."</span>'''''<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项2："No, thanks..."</span>'''''<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Jade：</span><br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项1）</span>'''''Hahaha, too bad. It's about to fall apart from the heat, so maybe another time!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Jade：</span><br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项2）</span>'''''Aww. You can be a little naughty sometimes, y'know.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Jade：</span><br>
There are more popsicles in the cooler next to the pool, so take as many as you want.<br>
By the way, I heard this rumor...<br>
People say you're so good at swimming that you can keep up with the submarines.<br>
I'd love to see your swimming, if you don't mind.<br>
It doesn't have to be top speed. All I want is for you to push me and my swim ring around the pool.<br>
<br>
(That rumor seems just a little bit embellished...)<br>
"If that's all you want, I don't mind."<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Jade：</span><br>
That's it. Keep it up!<br>
Your reward will be watermelon. It's seedless. Now open up!<br>
Hahaha, this is fun. It feels like I'm refueling my engine!<br>
While we're here, why don't I take a picture? Look over here, Commander.<br>
Three, two, one... Cheese!<br>
Maybe I should post this on Juustagram... No, I won't. I'll just save it in my "Slacking with the Commander" album, as usual.<br>
Hm? Commander? You're slowing down. Are you already tired?<br>
Would you like to get out and take a break? I brought plenty of snacks along with the popsicles.<br>
I've reserved this whole day with you, so we can take things nice and slow.<br>

7.I Am a Good Girl, You Know<br>
Port - Commander's Office<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Jade：</span><br>
I had a wonderful time on our date.<br>
The pool, the amusement park, the arcade, and a café... That was enough fun to last!<br>
And you even carried the stuff I bought! Here's your reward... *lick* You can have my popsicle!<br>
Your complexion looks much better these days. I think our lazy time together has been quite effective.<br>
Hm? You'd like to keep slacking off with me?<br>
Oh, if I must. As a good girl, I can't sit idly by while you're struggling.<br>
And you wouldn't refuse my busybodying, now, would you?<br>
Besides, you've had plenty of chances to refuse until now.<br>
You could've always justified refusing me by saying, "No, I'm busy." Yet you didn't. And that means...<br>
We're both good for caring so much about each other!<br>
Haha! Let's make more fun memories together from now on, okay?<br>
Say, Commander, could you close your eyes for a moment?<br>
Don't open them until I say so, please.<br>
*sigh*... You're obedient to a fault.<br>
You're so sweet that I don't know whether I really look like a good girl or a bad girl to you.<br>
But I'm not the kind of person to worry about that, so let me give you my own answer... I'm the kind of girl who wants your attention.<br>
So if I said... that I loved you, would that make your heart skip a beat? Or would you be more startled?<br>
*mwah*<br>
I don't plan to let anyone take my time with you.<br>
There. That's all from me!<br>
It's dark out, so I'd better get going.<br>
Oh, and... You can open your eyes now♪<br>
<br>
Port - Commander's Office The next day...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Weser：</span><br>
...That summarizes my report of the commission.<br>
You're in an unusually good mood today, Commander.<br>
I don't know what you're so happy about, but congratulations on whatever it may be.<br>
Anyway, thank you. I'll take my leave now.<br>
<br>
(That's all for the morning's work. Now it's time to kick back and—)<br>
*knock knock*<br>
A familiar voice called from beyond the door before coming in with snacks.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Jade：</span><br>
Oh, my. I just came along because I'd hit a good stopping point in my work, but it looks like I'm right on time.<br>
I don't suppose I have to explain what we're going to do now.<br>
Shall we get to slacking off together?<br>
