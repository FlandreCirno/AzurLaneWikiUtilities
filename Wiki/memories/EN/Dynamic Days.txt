1 Shopping Around<br>
Port - Akashi's Store<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Rikka Takarada：</span><br>
Geesh. This place is a lot bigger than you'd expect from the exterior...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Akashi：</span><br>
Welcome, nya! How can I help you, nya?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Akane Shinjo：</span><br>
Yeah, hi. I'm working on a kaiju figurine and need some sculpting clay. Do you have any?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Akashi：</span><br>
A what now, nya? I don't sell any– Actually, let me have a look, nya...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Rikka Takarada：</span><br>
You sure about this place, Akane? The shopkeeper seems a bit sus.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Akane Shinjo：</span><br>
Kinda, but it's said they sell EVERYTHING here, soooo...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Akashi：</span><br>
It just took me a second to remember I have it, nya. Let me get it for you, nya.<br>
We have a few figurine enthusiasts here at port, so it pays to keep sculpting supplies stocked, nya.<br>
Oh, speaking of figurine enthusiasts... nya.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Long Island：</span><br>
Heya, I'm looking to buy a new figurine~ Got anything new in stock, Akashi~?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Akashi：</span><br>
Do you have to ask every week, nya? Sigh... Lucky for you, it so happens I got a shipment of new ones today, nya. Look around, see if you find anything you like, nya!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Akane Shinjo：</span><br>
Uhh, shopkeep? The sculpting clay?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Akashi：</span><br>
Sorry, nya. Check the aisle over there for figurine stuff, nya.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Long Island：</span><br>
You looking for figurine stuff too~? What a coincidence~! If it's clay you need, I can help you find that no problem~<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Akane Shinjo：</span><br>
Cool. Chop-chop, then.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Akashi：</span><br>
Heheh... Thanks for the free labor, nya...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Long Island：</span><br>
Here's the place~ I'm no clay expert or anything, but I hope you find what you need~<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Akane Shinjo：</span><br>
Damn, there's so many to choose from! Which is a good thing.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Akashi：</span><br>
You didn't need to memorize my entire store layout, nya. Don't you ever wanna get lost and find an unexpected bargain, nya?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Long Island：</span><br>
And spend ages searching? No thanks... Why do you spread your goods out so far, anyway?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Akashi：</span><br>
It's designed to make customers walk further, stay longer, and spend more money, nya! It's the same principle YKEA is built on, nya!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Rikka Takarada：</span><br>
She should try putting herself in the customer's shoes and see how she'd like it...<br>
Or her employees' shoes. Stocking these shelves and keeping inventory must be a nightmare...<br>
<br>
While chatting among themselves, the girls came across an aisle packed with second-hand computers and televisions.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Rikka Takarada：</span><br>
If you can name it, they sell it here, huh?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Long Island：</span><br>
Apparently~! Why do you keep these around, Akashi? I bet they don't even work anymore!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Akashi：</span><br>
That's where you're wrong, nya. These may be old, but there's life in them yet, nya!<br>
<br>
Akashi flipped a switch on the wall, bringing all the electronics to buzzing life. Screens of all shapes and sizes turned on, lighting a path that stretched on quite some distance.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Rikka Takarada：</span><br>
Wow... They do still work.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Akashi：</span><br>
Heheh! With some spare parts and elbow grease, you can make any old tech work again!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Akane Shinjo：</span><br>
Except this TV, apparently. It's not turning on.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Akashi：</span><br>
Huh?! But... it's plugged in and everything, nya! Why isn't it working, nya?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Rikka Takarada：</span><br>
Hmm... Do you mind if I try something? I've fixed something similar before.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Akashi：</span><br>
You have, nya? Then by all means, go ahead, nya!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Rikka Takarada：</span><br>
All right, just give me a second. Stand back.<br>
<br>
Rikka held her fist high in the air then gave the TV a great thump.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Long Island & Akashi：</span><br>
......<br>
<br>
Unbelievably, the TV screen came on with a quiet whirr.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Long Island：</span><br>
Holy poggers, it worked~! You're the MVP, Rikka!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Akashi：</span><br>
Phew... I thought you'd broken it for a minute there, nya!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Rikka Takarada：</span><br>
I'm telling you, this usually works with the stuff I'm used to. A small whack won't break anything.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Akane Shinjo：</span><br>
At least not with Rikka's surgical precision.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Akashi：</span><br>
Well, tell you what: I'll give you 20% off for your help, nya! One time only, nya.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Rikka Takarada：</span><br>
You... You're serious? Oh wow, that's really generous of you!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Long Island：</span><br>
Do I get a discount too?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Akashi：</span><br>
For doing what, nya? Writing off my valuable products as junk, nya? You wish, nya.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Long Island：</span><br>
RIP me...<br>
<br>
And so, after encountering some pleasant people and surprises, Rikka and Akane left the store with wares in hand.<br>

2 On-Location Shoot<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Namiko：</span><br>
What's going on, guys! I'm Namiko, and this is Hass. Hass, would you tell 'em where we are today?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Hass：</span><br>
Hey. So, we're at a naval port, and we're gonna talk to some people.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Namiko：</span><br>
Uh-huh! We'll be interviewing some of the brave shipgirls who fight for humanity and learn what their talents are.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Hass：</span><br>
Awesome. These are the shipgirls joining us today. Say hello to...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">San Diego：</span><br>
Hiiiii! It's me, San Diego! Everyone's number one favorite idol!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Suruga：</span><br>
My name is Suruga, and... I just happened to be in the area.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Admiral Graf Spee：</span><br>
Hello. Call me Spee.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Laffey：</span><br>
I'm sleepy...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Hass：</span><br>
Nice, what a colorful cast. We're glad to have you here.<br>
So without further ado, tell us about your strengths and talents.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">San Diego：</span><br>
Oh, I've got a buttload of talents! But if I have to choose just one, it's easily singing!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Namiko：</span><br>
A sweet, happy-go-lucky idol with a knack for singing! I'm sure tons of people would subscribe to that.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Admiral Graf Spee：</span><br>
I don't have any real strengths...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Hass：</span><br>
Sure you do, Spee. You've got a cute fashion sense. You dress to match your personality, too.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Admiral Graf Spee：</span><br>
I'm just wearing what my friends suggested... They deserve the credit.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Laffey：</span><br>
In my case... I...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Namiko：</span><br>
Oh, Laffey knows how to build suspense. Go on, tell us! What's your greatest talent?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Laffey：</span><br>
The ability to... fall asleep anywhere, anytime...<br>
Goodnight... Zzzzz...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Namiko：</span><br>
Wow, what a unique talent. Complete with a demonstration, too!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Hass：</span><br>
Oh, man. I'd kill to say goodbye to sleepless nights forever.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Suruga：</span><br>
(Why are they commentating like show hosts? What is this? Low-budget reality TV?)<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Namiko：</span><br>
Thanks for the performance, Laffey. Now last, but not least... Suruga! Would you tell us your greatest strength?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Suruga：</span><br>
St-strength...? Uhh...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Shimakaze：</span><br>
Suruga has a photographic memory! All she needs is one glance to perfectly memorize anything!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Suruga：</span><br>
Don't answer on my behalf! Where'd you come from, anyway?!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Namiko：</span><br>
Wow, we have a surprise guest! I wonder what she has to say about her friend Suruga?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Hass：</span><br>
A photographic memory is a bit TOO great, don't you think? Got anything more ordinary?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Shimakaze：</span><br>
Well, she can cut her nails really quickly! I saw it for myself the other day when she–<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Namiko：</span><br>
Oh dear, she must've really set off Suruga. She's trying to grapple Shimakaze like she's– Oops! Shimakaze ran away!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Admiral Graf Spee：</span><br>
Look at her run... Does she have rocket boosters or something...?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Hass：</span><br>
That's going in the blooper reel... Psst, Namiko, we've gotta wrap things up.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Namiko：</span><br>
Err, right... Thanks for watching, guys! That's almost it for today, but before we go, let's hear a song from San Diego. Sandy, take it from here!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">San Diego：</span><br>
You got it! A-one and a-two and a-I am number one!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Hass：</span><br>
And that's everything we recorded. What did you want edited out, Suruga?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Suruga：</span><br>
All the footage I'm in, thank you very much! Every second of it!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Hass：</span><br>
Welp. That's a bummer, but if you say so...<br>
<br>
This deleted footage ended up nearly being leaked to the public. How that happened, though, is a story for another time...<br>

<br>
3 A Joy Cruise<br>
Clear blue skies, vivid azure seas. Two black and red figures darted along the surface, like sharks on the hunt.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">U-37：</span><br>
I'mma crank up the speed! Hang on tight, Yume!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Yume Minami：</span><br>
Geesh, this is fast...<br>
<br>
Sprays of water gushed after U-37 as she accelerated.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">U-73：</span><br>
Hey, U-37! Don't forget we still have to do the thing!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">U-37：</span><br>
Yeah, yeah, I remember!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Yume Minami：</span><br>
Wait, what thing? I thought we were just going for a cruise?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">U-73：</span><br>
Don't worry, it won't take long! U-37 was just hoping you'd play a little game with us. Right?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">U-37：</span><br>
Uhh, yeah, that's all!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Yume Minami：</span><br>
If it's just a little game, then sure... Playing out on the open sea might be fun.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">U-37：</span><br>
Hell yeah it is! All right, y'know the rules of Red Light, Green Light, right?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Yume Minami：</span><br>
Who doesn't? But I've never done it in water before. Is the game some kind of regional variant of it, or...?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">U-73：</span><br>
Not really, it's the same thing as every kid's played before! Also, you won't exactly be "in water." Look up ahead and you'll see what I mean!<br>
<br>
The girls arrived at a small island poking above the water with a lighthouse on top. Yume set foot on the island while the other two swam some distance away.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">U-37：</span><br>
Yumeeee! If ya can hear me, just say it when you're ready!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Yume Minami：</span><br>
Man, I can barely see them over there...<br>
Guess I'll have to shout... READYYYY! FIIIIVE! FOOOOUR!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">U-73：</span><br>
Perfect! Time to get a move on!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">U-37：</span><br>
Heheh, yeah!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Yume Minami：</span><br>
ONE! ...Huh? Guys?<br>
<br>
Yume turned around to find the two submarines were completely gone. All there was left of them were their ripples.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Yume Minami：</span><br>
Okay then... I guess we're playing hide-and-seek instead.<br>
Either that, or they left me stranded... That would be a bit rude, kind of.<br>
Oh wait, I've still got my rigging. Just need to go back the same way we... came...<br>
Right... Too bad I have no idea where we came from.<br>
<br>
The only things around her were the featureless skies and seas. She was all alone, without any landmarks to guide her.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Yume Minami：</span><br>
Dying out here would kind of suck... Wish I had the Dyna Wing right now.<br>
<br>
While Yume stood, pondering her options, U-37 and U-73 suddenly resurfaced. They presented to her a box in a vivid array of colors.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">U-37：</span><br>
Check it out! Sweet box, right? We stuffed a buncha colorful fish into this thing.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">U-73：</span><br>
Plus some pretty clams, shells, and coral!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Yume Minami：</span><br>
Wow... They're really nice.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">U-73：</span><br>
We saw you kept a ton of sea-themed plushes in your room, which gave us the idea to gift this to you.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Yume Minami：</span><br>
That explains a few things... I was spooked when you vanished on me like that, though.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">U-37：</span><br>
Heh, sorry 'bout that! Anyway, ya like the gift?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Yume Minami：</span><br>
That goes without saying. Thanks a ton. Say, could we go for another cruise? A normal one.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">U-73：</span><br>
Hahah, sure! If by "normal" you mean "high-speed"! I know you love going fast.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">U-37：</span><br>
Don't we all! Hop on and we'll go for a ride!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Yume Minami：</span><br>
Nice! Let's see what stuff is out there.<br>
<br>
Amid the gently washing waves and calm winds, one could hear their laughter for seemingly miles.<br>

4 Band Together<br>
It was a tranquil afternoon. Chise was out on a casual stroll.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Chise Asukagawa：</span><br>
Oh man, Dunkerque sure makes some amazing pastries! Eating 'em really fills you with joy.<br>
<br>
Just down the street, Urakaze and Isokaze were standing next to some instruments, handing out flyers. Chise laid eyes on them.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Chise Asukagawa：</span><br>
You got a band thing going on or somethin'? Not too weird for this port though, I guess.<br>
Dang, that's some high-end equipment... Cool stuff you got!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Urakaze：</span><br>
Thanks. We are the Sengokus. We strive to unify the port under one band... Ours, of course.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Isokaze：</span><br>
Mhm! We're looking for new members. Interested, Chise?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Chise Asukagawa：</span><br>
Eh... I dunno if I'm good enough.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Urakaze：</span><br>
Even at a glance, I can tell you have potential. Come on, we could use someone of your caliber.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Chise Asukagawa：</span><br>
Aww, shucks, you flatter me...<br>
Oh, all right! If you're fine with havin' me, then I'll give it my best shot!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Urakaze：</span><br>
Splendid! See, Isokaze? I told you we'd eventually get a new member, given enough perseverance!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Isokaze：</span><br>
Wahoo! Now help yourself to any instrument you want, Chise!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Urakaze：</span><br>
By the way, there's a voucher for a fancy patisserie on the back of your flyer.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Chise Asukagawa：</span><br>
Whoa, I didn't notice! What a "sweet" sign-up bonus.<br>
<br>
Urakaze and Isokaze kept on handing out flyers while Chise familiarized herself with her instrument. The two Sengokus had now become three.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Mujina：</span><br>
You're forming a band? How charming.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Isokaze：</span><br>
Yep, and we're looking for more members. Would you like to join, Mujina?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Mujina：</span><br>
I do appreciate the offer, but I'm afraid I can't play an instrument.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Urakaze：</span><br>
It's never too late to start learning. Who knows? There may be untapped talent within you.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Mujina：</span><br>
Thanks, but no. I'll come and watch, but...<br>
<br>
Mujina meant to decline, but experienced a sudden change of heart when Urakaze and Isokaze surrounded her with instruments.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Mujina：</span><br>
Well... On second thought...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Chise Asukagawa：</span><br>
Hella persuasive, aren't they? It can't hurt to give it a shot at least. C'mon, let's hear it!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">{namecode:142}&{namecode:143}：</span><br>
*looks of anticipation*<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Mujina：</span><br>
Fine... I'll see how this one plays...<br>
<br>
Mujina picked up a drumstick and gave the drums a soft hit.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Mujina：</span><br>
Hmm... Not bad.<br>
<br>
She hit it a second time, this time with a bit more force.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Mujina：</span><br>
Such devastatingly powerful sound... I could get into this, actually.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Chise Asukagawa：</span><br>
Oh snap! I don't think she's being sarcastic with us.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Urakaze：</span><br>
You're free to try all the instruments if you want, Mujina.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Isokaze：</span><br>
You're free to join the band too! Just so you know!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Urakaze：</span><br>
She knows, Isokaze. Don't pester her.<br>
<br>
Chise kept on familiarizing herself, and Mujina tested other instruments while Urakaze and Isokaze watched. They became engrossed in the world of music and forgot all about the flyers.<br>
The four members of the Sengokus performed for hours and hours, the sun even setting before they were done.<br>
