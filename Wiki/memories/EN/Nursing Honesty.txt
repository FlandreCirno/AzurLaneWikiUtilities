1 The Cold Secretary<br>
Port - Office<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Jervis：</span><br>
Hello, Commander. I am J-class destroyer Jervis. I will be serving as your secretary starting today.<br>
I'm pleased to see you're on time. Keeping one's secretary waiting is a faux pas, after all.<br>
<br>
I arrived at my office and saw Jervis, my new secretary, was already there.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Jervis：</span><br>
Now then, Commander, I propose we start on today's work right away.<br>
First on the programme: filing paperwork.<br>
Please start with this stack here. It's high-priority.<br>
<br>
I accepted the documents and began reading through the first sheet.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Jervis：</span><br>
...You're too close to the paper.<br>
That's bad for your eyesight. Please correct your posture.<br>
Good habits correlate with increased productivity. Try to remember that.<br>
<br>
A troubling paragraph caught my eye. I read through it carefully.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Jervis：</span><br>
...Commander. Posture. While I know it's tiring to maintain it, you must try if you want to see some change. May I?<br>
<br>
She ran a gentle hand along my back. It seemed I had subconsciously hunched forward again.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Jervis：</span><br>
There we are. Much better.<br>
On another note, your desk is quite messy. I must ask you to refrain from haphazardly leaving things about.<br>
A cluttered workspace harms productivity, making you fall behind on your tasks.<br>
To use an analogy, it's like letting an illness go untreated. By the time it gets unmanageable, it's too late.<br>
<br>
She kindly lectured me while promptly organizing my paperwork.<br>
Although at first glance you'd think she's laid-back, she was actually diligent and very responsible.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Jervis：</span><br>
Are you taking my advice to heart, Commander?<br>
Because if not, you're sorely mistaken if you think I'll do everything for you regardless.<br>
<br>
I felt drawn to her and wanted to get to know her better.<br>

2 The Meticulous Secretary<br>
It had been a few days since Jervis became my secretary and I'd become fairly familiar with her.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Jervis：</span><br>
*sigh*... Didn't I ask you to keep the window open for the sake of better circulation? You need to be more considerate of your health.<br>
<br>
She opened the window and a gust of cool, fresh air breezed inside.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Jervis：</span><br>
Refreshing, isn't it? If you start feeling cold, please put this on.<br>
You mustn't fall ill, or the whole port will grind to a halt and I will need to painstakingly nurse you back to health.<br>
We don't want that to happen, so have this warming cup of tea.<br>
No need to thank me. This is all part of a secretary's responsibilities.<br>
<br>
While she sounded a bit grumpy, her strong sense of duty shone through her words.<br>
Not only had she beautifully completed the work I assigned her, but she'd also tidied up the whole office.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Jervis：</span><br>
Incidentally, I've replaced your inkwell. The one on your desk was running low, so I fetched a new one from the depot.<br>
Please take care not to spill any ink. It's a royal pain to clean up.<br>
<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项1："Thanks."</span>'''''<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Jervis：</span><br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项1）</span>'''''Don't mention it. I'm only doing what's expected of me.<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项1）</span>'''''Speaking of the depot, I made a list of our inventory while I was there. Here you are.<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项1）</span>'''''I've also shredded all the old documents due for disposal.<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项1）</span>'''''In addition...<br>
<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项1）</span>'''''My productivity had shot through the roof thanks to Jervis' impeccable assistance.<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项1）</span>'''''"Let's keep this momentum going and steamroll through today's work."<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Jervis：</span><br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项1）</span>'''''You have the right attitude, but taking breaks is important too. Making sure you do so is also part of my job.<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项1）</span>'''''On that note, now would be a good time for a break, wouldn't you say?<br>

<br>
3 A Papercut<br>
Jervis was insistent on maintaining a healthy work-life balance and forcibly added a couple of breaktimes to my daily schedule.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Jervis：</span><br>
That's enough for now. It's time for an intermission.<br>
<br>
I protested and tried to keep working, but she wouldn't budge on her stance. Her iron will made my every attempt end in failure.<br>
Eventually I gave in and put my documents in order.<br>
Then, just as I was getting out of my chair, I felt a sting on my finger.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Jervis：</span><br>
...Don't move. Give me your hand and I'll tend to it right away.<br>
First, antiseptic... then a plaster... and we're done. We're lucky I brought my first-aid kit.<br>
Give it a few days and it should have healed.<br>
You need to be more careful, Commander. A responsible adult doesn't get papercuts.<br>
A sheet of paper may be soft, but its edges are sharp.<br>
Antiseptic hurts, doesn't it? Please take care moving forward so I won't need to use it.<br>
<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项1："I will. Thanks for the help."</span>'''''<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Jervis：</span><br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项1）</span>'''''As I've said before, no need to thank me. This is what a secretary should do.<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项1）</span>'''''While a cut is no big deal, it would be a headache for me if you get hurt while on a sortie or the like.<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项1）</span>'''''If you become bedridden for months, I will need to change vocation from secretary to dial-in nurse.<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项1）</span>'''''Do you understand what I'm saying, Commander?<br>
<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项1）</span>'''''"You have a unique way of showing concern for others, but I understand."<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Jervis：</span><br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项1）</span>'''''*sigh*... For the record, I mean it. If you get that badly hurt, I WILL need to nurse you back to health.<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项1）</span>'''''Frankly, I cannot imagine a bigger burden...<br>
<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项1）</span>'''''I sensed a hint of enthusiasm in her voice as she said that. Maybe she secretly wanted to be in that position?<br>

4 Jervis and Janus<br>
Port - Office<br>
*knock knock*<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Janus：</span><br>
I-I'm coming in!<br>
<br>
A visitor came to my office. It was Janus, one of Jervis' sister ships.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Jervis：</span><br>
Janus? Are you here to talk to the Commander?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Janus：</span><br>
Um, uh, y-yes!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Jervis：</span><br>
Calm down. Take a deep breath.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Janus：</span><br>
Huff...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Jervis：</span><br>
Better?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Janus：</span><br>
Mhm. That helped!<br>
Umm, I'm here to turn in my naval exercise application!<br>
I have the document right here. Please pass it on to the Commander...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Jervis：</span><br>
Very well. I will let you know when and where it's taking place if the Commander accepts your entry.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Janus：</span><br>
Thank you. I-I'll be taking my leave now! I've got to practice for the exercise! <br>
Good luck with your work, you two!<br>
<br>
After Janus had left, I felt Jervis seemed uncharacteristically tense.<br>
I surmised it had something to do with her sister's plan to participate in the exercise.<br>
<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项1："Something wrong? Is it about Janus?"</span>'''''<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Jervis：</span><br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项1）</span>'''''Oh. Is it that obvious?<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项1）</span>'''''Yes. I'm concerned about her.<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项1）</span>'''''She's a kind and polite girl, but she's very withdrawn around strangers.<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项1）</span>'''''Communication is vital in everyday life. In an exercise, all the more so...<br>
<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项1）</span>'''''An idea popped into my head...<br>
<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项2："Then let's be there and watch over her."</span>'''''<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Jervis：</span><br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项2）</span>'''''P-pardon?<br>

5 To the Exercise<br>
Port - Exercise Area<br>
The day of the exercise had come. Jervis and I were headed for the scene.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Jervis：</span><br>
I just hope she'll be okay...<br>
......<br>
<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项1："Are you that worried about her?"</span>'''''<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Jervis：</span><br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项1）</span>'''''Well... Yes.<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项1）</span>'''''But this is her choice, and I support it.<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项1）</span>'''''All I can do now is pray that she'll finish without getting hurt...<br>
<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项1）</span>'''''Jervis showed a side of herself I don't see much – the candidly considerate side.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Jervis：</span><br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项1）</span>'''''Phew... It's finally over.<br>
<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项1）</span>'''''Seeing the exercise concluded without incident, Jervis breathed a sigh of relief.<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项1）</span>'''''She had been dead quiet up to that moment, spectating the fighting on the edge of her seat.<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项1）</span>'''''Though she won't admit it, I knew she was ready to run right in with her first-aid kit and care for Janus if she had an accident.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Jervis：</span><br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项1）</span>'''''Well, seeing as the exercise is over, let's head back and wrap up our work for the day.<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项1）</span>'''''Your coming here has thrown the programme completely off. First order of business is...<br>

When Jervis and I were about to leave, Janus ran over to us after just having finished the exercise.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Janus：</span><br>
Did... Did you come to see the results?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Jervis：</span><br>
Um, yes. Exactly.<br>
<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项1："You did well."</span>'''''<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Janus：</span><br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项1）</span>'''''Huh? Th-thank you...<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项1）</span>'''''B-but I can do better.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Jervis：</span><br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项1）</span>'''''I'm just glad you didn't get hurt. Try to play it safe in all future exercises as well, okay?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Janus：</span><br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项1）</span>'''''I know, I will. Thanks for looking out for me.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Jervis：</span><br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项1）</span>'''''Also, don't forget to submit an after-action report.<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项1）</span>'''''The Commander spectated the whole thing, yes, but you still need to make one.<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项1）</span>'''''I wish the Commander HADN'T come here... Now we need to restructure today's programme from the ground up...<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项1）</span>'''''Finishing on time today will be tight, I bet...<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项1）</span>'''''Commander, please don't make a habit of suddenly changing plans. It complicates my job.<br>
<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项1）</span>'''''While, yes, I'd get more work as a consequence of this, it was worth it to see the relieved look on Jervis' face.<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项1）</span>'''''I'd just be a little busy for a bit. That was no big deal.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Janus：</span><br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项1）</span>'''''Umm, Commander...<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项1）</span>'''''Jervis isn't, uh, having a go at you. She's just expressing concern for your well-being.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Jervis：</span><br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项1）</span>'''''Janus! Don't say that!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Janus：</span><br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项1）</span>'''''I know she cares a lot about you! It's why she said that just now – she doesn't want you to become overburdened with work!<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项1）</span>'''''M-my point is: please don't take what she said in a bad way!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Jervis：</span><br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项1）</span>'''''That's enough, Janus!<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项1）</span>'''''Commander, wait here for just a moment. I'll be right back.<br>
<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项1）</span>'''''Jervis took Janus and led her away.<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项1）</span>'''''It seemed like Janus was looking after Jervis in her own special way.<br>

<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Jervis：</span><br>
......<br>
<br>
Jervis entered my office and sat down where she always does without saying a word.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Jervis：</span><br>
......<br>
Please don't overthink what Janus said. She simply wanted to clarify what I meant, in case you misunderstood...<br>
She can be kind to a fault, which sometimes causes me a bit of inconvenience, I suppose you could say...<br>
Just please, don't think badly of her for it.<br>
<br>

'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项1）</span>'''''I see. That's good to hear.<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项1）</span>'''''A-also, I'd like to make a couple of things clear between us.<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项1）</span>'''''Ahem... There have been a few times I've felt things that baffle even me.<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项1）</span>'''''For instance, I've felt excitement when thinking about the idea of nursing you if you were to become really ill...<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项1）</span>'''''Even more strangely, these nonsensical feelings only seem to grow stronger the more time I spend with you.<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项1）</span>'''''It's made me realise what a greedy person I really am at heart.<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项1）</span>'''''...Having said all that, do you understand what I'm talking about?<br>
<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项1）</span>'''''I had an idea of what she meant. She'd become considerably more open since I first met her.<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项1）</span>'''''But I still wasn't entirely sure I was right...<br>
<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项2："Tell me exactly what you mean."</span>'''''<br>

'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项3）</span>'''''Say nothing<br>
