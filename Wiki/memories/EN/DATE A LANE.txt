Port - Commander's Office<br>
*knock knock*<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Memphis：</span><br>
Commander, we've received an urgent message from a Virtual Tower monitoring site.<br>
They said active signals were detected again from the Tower about 30 minutes ago, and the surrounding 150 nautical miles all became enveloped in a space-time anomaly.<br>
We'd adjusted the position of our monitoring station in advance based on what happened last time. Unfortunately, the area affected this time is pretty massive...<br>
As a result, many monitoring sites and patrol fleets were caught inside the anomaly.<br>
Furthermore, we believe that visitors from another world will appear again, based on our previous experiences.<br>
Owing to the unprecedented scale of this occurrence, TB's assessment is that there is extreme danger involved, with a risk of significant damage to third parties.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
So the Virtual Tower's acting up again, and it's bigger than ever this time...<br>
Those monitoring sites constitute a part of our periphery defenses, so we need to treat this incident as an attack on the port.<br>
I'll issue a grade III– Actually, a grade II alert.<br>
Get the strategy department to come up with a response immediately, and commence reconnaissance over sector one. Tell all our fleets to be ready for combat within an hour.<br>
Also, tell Enterprise to come see me. I'll personally command this battle.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Memphis：</span><br>
Roger!<br>

<br>
KABOOOM!<br>
Another Siren fleet is reduced to wreckage following an intense explosion.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Enterprise：</span><br>
Commander, this is now the third Type IV Siren fleet that's engaged us in a mere 30 minutes.<br>
That's making me think the situation might be far worse than our recon suggested at first.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Indeed. Owing to the space-time anomaly's effects, this area isn't actually 100 nautical miles in size either.<br>
We're not only up against their strongest Type IVs, but they're also densely packed together.<br>
Whoever the visitors are this time, they're no ordinary bunch.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Essex：</span><br>
Commander, I just spotted something strange in the sky.<br>
Judging by the footage... I think it's an airship.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
An... airship?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Helena：</span><br>
Positional data verified. I've locked on to the target's signal.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Shangri-La：</span><br>
Please hold off on the attack order, Commander. I have a feeling that the target isn't hostile.<br>
I'm basing this off of the fact that they've already engaged quite a lot of Siren fleets.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Then it seems our new allies this time are aboard that airship, and moreover, it confirms my hunch that they're no ordinary bunch.<br>
TB, try to get in touch with them.<br>
And Enterprise, give them some backup at once.<br>
<br>
Meanwhile...<br>
KABOOOM!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">???：</span><br>
Tsk... There's no end to these dang things!<br>
I thought this Fraxinus dead ringer of a ship was all form over function, but these defenses and power systems are better than I expected.<br>
Its firepower is nothing to scoff at, either.<br>
But, having said that...<br>
<br>
KABOOOM!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">???：</span><br>
Why do I still have to fight with my own weapons?<br>
*sigh*... These enemies remind me of the AST quite a bit, but they don't seem human. They're more like some sort of intelligent life-form.<br>
Can only hope everyone else is okay...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Onboard Communicator：</span><br>
BEEP BEEP!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">???：</span><br>
Huh? Someone's calling me?<br>
{{折叠面板|内容结束}}

{{折叠面板|标题="Efreet"|选项=3|主框=1|样式=primary|展开=是}}
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Enterprise：</span><br>
It's... over!<br>
<br>
KABOOOM!<br>
The surrounding Siren fleets could do nothing but disintegrate in the face of the overwhelming firepower of the Eagle Union's fleet. After that, we finally got to speak with the airship's owner.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">???：</span><br>
You're packing a pretty solid punch yourselves.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Kotori Itsuka：</span><br>
I'm Kotori Itsuka, a commander of Ratatoskr. Thanks again for backing me up.<br>
You must be the commander of this fleet. What do you want me to call you?<br>
<br>
Since otherworldly visitors are frequent visitors to the port, we've created a manual for first-time encounters with them.<br>
This, combined with the fact that she is a commander, allowed us to swiftly exchange information.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
It's believed that the rigging you have equipped is something that the Virtual Tower created specifically for you when it "summoned" you.<br>
This is probably some kind of auto-transfiguration. The gear itself is harmless, so don't be afraid to use it.<br>
As for your airship, I suspect the reason it differs from the original is that it's a replica the Virtual Tower made.<br>
Given its complicated structure, we should probably take it back to the port and give it a closer look.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Kotori Itsuka：</span><br>
I figured it was a replica. I suppose I'll call it Pseudo-Fraxinus, then.<br>
Speaking of ships, surely this isn't your entire fleet. You did say you were going to sweep through this whole area.<br>
And as it so happens, Commander, I've gotten separated from five of my friends. If it's not too much to ask, can you help me look for them?<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
You've gotten separated? Alright, we'll help.<br>
Memphis, inform all the fleets about our search.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Memphis：</span><br>
Understood.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Miss Kotori, you can breathe easy. Your friends aren't the only ones stranded here – many of ours are, too.<br>
Several of our main fleets already have the area on full lockdown. They'll commence an attack as soon as they get news from their scouts.<br>
Until then, your airship would be a huge asset to have if you can get it running properly.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Kotori Itsuka：</span><br>
"Several main fleets"... Sounds like you have more power than I imagined.<br>
So then, what makes you so interested in my Pseudo-Fraxinus?<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Honestly, it's because I've only seen airships like that in science fiction movies.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Kotori Itsuka：</span><br>
I see... And what do you know about Spirits?<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Can't say I know what that means.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Kotori Itsuka：</span><br>
Interesting... Heh. Then you're in for a sight you'll never forget.<br>
Because when you saw me fight earlier, I wasn't using my full power.<br>
Well, glad we're on the same side, Commander!<br>

<br>
A while passed. The Eagle Union's fleet fully cleared out sector one, securing the beachhead.<br>
With the information Kotori provided us, we divided the remaining space into four sectors.<br>
Apparently, a Spirit is trapped in each of these sections. This follows the Virtual Tower's usual way of doing things.<br>
The Iris Orthodoxy's and Dragon Empery's fleet got assigned sector two, where a Spirit by the name of Tohka Yatogami is believed to be.<br>
The Sardegna Empire's and Iron Blood's fleet was given sector three, which should be where the Spirit Origami Tobiichi is.<br>
Sector four went to the Royal Navy's and Northern Parliament's fleet, which will be looking for the Spirit named Yoshino.<br>
Lastly, the Sakura Empire's and Kingdom of Tulipa's fleet was tasked with finding a duo of Spirits in sector five – Kaguya Yamai and Yuzuru Yamai.<br>
I couldn't help but wonder why there were two of them in sector five, a unique situation.<br>
Kotori explained that I should "think of them as one and the same Spirit." That's most likely the reason why.<br>
Once the attack begins on the remaining four sectors, Kotori and I will lead the Eagle Union's fleet and Pseudo-Fraxinus into...<br>
Ah, right, she rechristened it as Fraxinus AL... We'll take the fleet and Fraxinus AL, and we'll provide support to whichever sector needs it the most.<br>
Thanks to a team of the port's experts – including Yuubari – the airship was repaired and ready. They not only restored much of its functionality, but also installed new and experimental weaponry.<br>
Most impressive of all was the person recovery system that the airship had. It opened my eyes to new possibilities.<br>
All these impressive technologies are sure to aid us in battles to come.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Memphis：</span><br>
Commander, Miss Kotori, all fleets are standing by.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Kotori Itsuka：</span><br>
Fraxinus AL's systems are all green and ready to go.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Memphis, give the order to commence the attack.<br>
Let's take it slow and steady. Leave no enemy in the area unscathed!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Memphis：</span><br>
Roger!<br>

<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Harbin：</span><br>
We've got the superior force in this battle. I think we oughta apply pressure from the front while flanking 'em with our fleets from the sides.<br>
It should let us seize control of this area quicker. The extra time we'll get can be spent on looking for those trapped girls.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Richelieu：</span><br>
I concur. Incidentally, I've heard that a Dragon Empery patrol fleet has also become trapped here.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Yat Sen：</span><br>
Yes. Fu Shun, Fei Yuen, and Fu Po. They're a clever trio, so I believe they'll be fine.<br>
I'm more concerned about our guests. We need to find them as quickly as possible.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Jean Bart：</span><br>
She's got hair as dark as night, purple clothes, and carries a huge sword. Nickname's "Princess," also known as Tohka Yatogami.<br>
Saw the intel about her. Reckon we'll recognize her immediately.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Clemenceau：</span><br>
I'm quite curious to see what this guest looks like.<br>
Seeing as all the fleets have set off now, shall we do the same?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Chen Hai：</span><br>
Let us hope we can resolve this incident quickly and bring everyone home safely.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">An Shan：</span><br>
Set sail!<br>
{{折叠面板|内容结束}}

{{折叠面板|标题="Princess"|选项=6|主框=1|样式=primary|展开=是}}
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Fu Po：</span><br>
Still no word back from the port, as I feared...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Fei Yuen：</span><br>
So what you're saying is...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Fu Po & Fu Shun：</span><br>
- We're in a load of trouble!  - And nobody's gonna try to stop us!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Fu Po：</span><br>
Huh?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Fu Shun：</span><br>
You weren't around for the last adventure, Fei Yuen, but now the gang's all here! That, to me, sounds like destiny's doing!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Fei Yuen：</span><br>
But how will we go on an adventure? There's nobody here but enemies.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Fu Shun：</span><br>
Heheh... There's not JUST enemies here.<br>
The Virtual Tower acted up, so you know what that means? That we've got visitors from another world again!<br>
<br>
GRRSSHH... KABOOOM!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Fu Shun：</span><br>
Right on cue. Sounds to me like someone's fighting!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Fu Po：</span><br>
That didn't sound like cannon fire, though, did it?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Fu Shun：</span><br>
Which means our visitors aren't any average Janes! Come on, let's be quick!<br>
Our adventure's officially begun!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Fei Yuen：</span><br>
Our adventure's officially begun!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Fu Po：</span><br>
But– Hey! Wait up!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">???：</span><br>
Hiyaaahhh!<br>
<br>
A girl standing atop some ruins brandished her sword against the approaching Sirens.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">???：</span><br>
Hngh!<br>
<br>
A moment later, a fierce shockwave blew across the surroundings, dispatching all her witless foes in one fell swoop.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">???：</span><br>
Hmph. Any more who–<br>
<br>
She prepared to swing her sword again, but she stopped herself once had a good look at who they were.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Fu Shun：</span><br>
Holy smokes! I can't believe you just took out all those Sirens by yourself!<br>
You must be from another world, right? What's your name?<br>
Oh, sorry, I should go first! I'm Fu Shun! I'm the captain of our adventure squad!<br>
This is Fei Yuen, and that's Fu Po – my skilled assistant and tactician!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Tohka Yatogami：</span><br>
Well met. My name is Tohka Yatogami.<br>
You look quite different to those I just fought. Who exactly are you?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Fu Shun：</span><br>
Hah! I knew we'd need a proper introduction! Telling Fu Po to get one ready was the right call!<br>
Here you go. It's an overview of information concerning the Azur Lane!<br>
<br>
Tohka received a book from Fu Shun, and began reading it carefully.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Tohka Yatogami：</span><br>
I understand. This place is a whole other world. That explains this strange equipment of mine.<br>
Yes. I've got the broad picture now.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Fu Po：</span><br>
You sure adapted fast...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Tohka Yatogami：</span><br>
Oh please. This happens all the time.<br>
Are we now in the place you call "the port"?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Fei Yuen：</span><br>
Nah, not here. There are loads of enemies here.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Tohka Yatogami：</span><br>
Where are we, then?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Fu Shun：</span><br>
Your guess is as good as ours!<br>
We were just patrolling and suddenly wound up here. We were just about to start gathering intel!<br>
It'll be an adventure! Wanna come with us, Tohka?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Tohka Yatogami：</span><br>
An adventure, you say? While that does sound amusing, what exactly does it entail?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Fu Shun：</span><br>
Come along and you'll see for yourself!<br>
<br>
And so went the encounter between Tohka Yatogami and the energetic adventure squad.<br>
{{折叠面板|内容结束}}

{{折叠面板|标题=Ready For Combat - Sector Two|选项=7|主框=1|样式=primary|展开=是}}
<br>
Tohka Yatogami and the three adventurers spent a while searching through the imitation of Tengu City.<br>
They mapped out its entire structure, finding not just spots to rest and a location Fu Shun dubbed "the Demon Castle," but also even learned of the wonder of something called kinako bread in the process.<br>
Then, just as they were about to clear out the Demon Castle, a spaceship entered everyone's view.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Fu Po：</span><br>
Look! What is that? Some kind of new Siren superweapon?!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Tohka Yatogami：</span><br>
Isn't that... Fraxinus?<br>
That's Kotori's airship!<br>
<br>
Possibly thanks to Fraxinus AL's relaying, the adventure squad's long-unresponsive communicators finally came back online.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Kotori Itsuka：</span><br>
Tohka and that patrol fleet look ready for a fight. Seems they've found the enemy's stronghold!<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
There's no time to waste. We must press on!<br>
{{折叠面板|内容结束}}

{{折叠面板|标题=Complete Control - Sector Two|选项=8|主框=1|样式=primary|展开=是}}
<br>
After a joint attack from Fraxinus AL, the Eagle Union, the Orthodoxy, and the Empery, all the enemies in sector two were wiped out.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Tohka Yatogami：</span><br>
Hm? This doesn't feel quite like the Fraxinus I'm used to.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Kotori Itsuka：</span><br>
Let's just say some things happened. Do call it "Fraxinus AL." Oh, and welcome back, Tohka.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Tohka Yatogami：</span><br>
It's good to be back, Kotori.<br>
You – I presume you're {playername}, the port's Commander.<br>
My name is Tohka Yatogami. It's quite an important name, so do try to remember it.<br>
I will need your assistance for the foreseeable future. On that topic... I'm hungry. Do you have anything to eat?<br>

<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Vittorio Veneto：</span><br>
My compatriots, the anomaly in this area is a threat to the port's safety. We must resolve this situation with haste.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Bismarck Zwei：</span><br>
Yeah. If we're lucky, this may even serve as an opportunity to destroy the Virtual Tower.<br>
Things get worse every time it does something. It poses too large a risk to be left alone.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Littorio：</span><br>
That may be wishing for too much. We searched that place's interior a while back, and... Well, it was like a natural Singularity in there.<br>
By which I mean, it stands there as a force of nature, in essence. It won't be destroyed so easily.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Bismarck Zwei：</span><br>
That's why I said "if we're lucky." No need to overthink it. Our priority remains to clear this area of enemies.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Marco Polo：</span><br>
With our firepower, that should be a walk in the park. What's with the excessive caution?<br>
Let me head in, and I'll show these insects just far below me they are!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Fritz Rumey：</span><br>
There is never a good reason to let your guard down. We are dealing with Type IV Sirens here, and nobody knows what awaits us at the center of the area of operations.<br>
In addition, we are tasked with rescuing an otherworldly visitor.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Littorio：</span><br>
Yes – a white-haired, borderline expressionless girl nicknamed "Angel."<br>
I'm quite eager to see this Origami Tobiichi for myself.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Prinz Eugen：</span><br>
Z2 and Z13 should be fine out there, but if any of you come across them, do bring them with you.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Vittorio Veneto：</span><br>
Naturally.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Friedrich der Große：</span><br>
Now, then, it is time that we compose a new symphony.<br>

<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Z13：</span><br>
Ugh... My communicator isn't broken, but it's just not working.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Z2：</span><br>
What a surprise. No one could have seen this coming.<br>
More pertinently, someone has been following us for a while now. Did you notice that?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Z13：</span><br>
Huh? You serious? Come on, now's not the time for ghost stories!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">???：</span><br>
That is correct.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Z13：</span><br>
Eeeeek! Someone's there!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">???：</span><br>
You referred to those machine life-forms you encountered as "Sirens."<br>
As for you, you are "shipgirls." The equipment you wear is called a "rigging."<br>
You caught on to me quite early, yet you still fed me information.<br>
Why is that?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Z2：</span><br>
Because it would take too long if I explained it to you directly.<br>
So, Miss Otherworldly Visitor, what should we call you?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Origami Tobiichi：</span><br>
I am Origami Tobiichi, former AST Master Sergeant.<br>
Are you with the military? What is your rank and division?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Z2：</span><br>
We serve the port of the Azur Lane. Our rank, well... That would be difficult to explain indeed.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Origami Tobiichi：</span><br>
I see. Okay.<br>
You just referred to me as an "otherworldly visitor." Should I take that to mean I'm in a world that's not my own?<br>
I'd like to organize and share information with you.<br>
Although this area isn't especially dangerous, we should preferably move to a shelter in a safer place.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Z13：</span><br>
Then we've got a common goal, Origami!<br>
Whaddya say we work together, huh? I'm Z13, and this is Z2.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Origami Tobiichi：</span><br>
Z2 and Z13... Interesting names. They sound almost like codenames.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Z2：</span><br>
We're... Well, it's a long story.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Origami Tobiichi：</span><br>
I understand. I won't pry further.<br>
I know close to nothing about this world, so your guidance would be appreciated. By all means, let us work together.<br>
I know a nearby place that's safe. Come with me.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Z13：</span><br>
Hang on a sec. You say you know "close to nothing," but you SOUND like you know quite a hecking lot!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Origami Tobiichi：</span><br>
This place may be a warped imitation, but it's strangely familiar to me.<br>
Take this building, for instance. It's where I lived before my world was rewritten.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Z13：</span><br>
Before it was REWRITTEN? Sounds like a huge deal, and you said it like it's nothing.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Z2：</span><br>
This visitor is certainly not just anyone, it seems. Show us the way, Miss Origami.<br>
{{折叠面板|内容结束}}

<br>
Origami, Z2, and Z13 went together around the fake Tengu City for a while.<br>
They stopped at a shelter and made preparations, exchanged intel, and rehearsed rigging usage. As they were practicing, they eventually came across what appeared to be an enemy stronghold.<br>
The moment they decided to investigate further, an airship came into their view.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Z13：</span><br>
What the– An airship?!<br>
Well, I should've expected as much from a world you said got "rewritten."<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Origami Tobiichi：</span><br>
Fraxinus...<br>
It seems Kotori has already joined forces with your port.<br>
<br>
Possibly thanks to Fraxinus AL's relaying, the adventure squad's long-unresponsive communicators finally came back online.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Kotori Itsuka：</span><br>
Seems like Origami went with a patrol fleet of yours and not only obtained tons of intel, but even figured out where the enemy's stronghold is.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Then it's obvious what we need to do next: Focus our forces and destroy the stronghold!<br>

{{折叠面板|标题=Complete Control - Sector Three|选项=12|主框=1|样式=primary|展开=是}}
<br>
After a joint attack from Fraxinus AL, the Eagle Union, Iron Blood, and Sardegna, all the enemies in sector three were wiped out.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Origami Tobiichi：</span><br>
Kotori, when did you renovate Fraxinus?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Kotori Itsuka：</span><br>
It's not really a renovation... More like another thing entirely.<br>
Call it "Fraxinus AL," if you would. Welcome, Origami. Glad to see you again safely.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Origami Tobiichi：</span><br>
Thanks, Kotori. You came just when we needed it<br>
And thank you, Commander of the port.<br>
My name is Origami Tobiichi. Former AST Master Sergeant, presently a high schooler – and also what they call a Spirit.<br>
My skills should have some use here. I'd be happy to cooperate with you.<br>
I look forward to fighting by your side.<br>

<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Belfast：</span><br>
Your Majesty, all our forces have led their fleets into combat positions.<br>
The Royal Maids' main force has also set off with its respective fleets.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Queen Elizabeth：</span><br>
Excellent. George, since my servant places high importance on this battle, I shall head to the front and command directly. I entrust you with our base and reserve forces.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">King George V：</span><br>
As you wish.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Queen Elizabeth：</span><br>
Lion, while you won't be fighting on the front lines this time, your task of search and rescue is equally important.<br>
You'll be looking for Jervis, Janus, and a blue-haired girl who controls a puppet. If my memory serves me right, her name is Yoshino, and her nickname is "Hermit."<br>
She sounds like a powerful one. Quite unlike what I heard about her – that she loathes fighting because she doesn't want to cause harm.<br>
Well, perhaps this is but a preconception.<br>
At any rate, they are in your hands. Bring them back in one piece.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Lion：</span><br>
Understood. I promise that I will find them.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Queen Elizabeth：</span><br>
Now, ladies of the Northern Parliament, I believe it'd be most efficient if we split up and worked separately.<br>
The Royal Navy shall concentrate on sweeping the whole area. You, meanwhile, can focus on capturing strongholds. How does that sound?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Sovetsky Soyuz：</span><br>
I have no objections.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Sovetskaya Rossiya：</span><br>
This entire incident was clearly instigated by the Sirens.<br>
I thought they'd finally learned after our years of beating them down, but it seems they're still scheming in the shadows.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Sovetskaya Belorussiya：</span><br>
Whatever it is they're planning, they won't get away with it!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Queen Elizabeth：</span><br>
That's the spirit! Bel, Vanguard, time to get going.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Sovetsky Soyuz：</span><br>
Let us reconvene once victory is ours.<br>

<br>
KABOOOM!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">???：</span><br>
"Ugghh! These guys are more annoying than the AST! We've beaten sooo many, but they just keep coming!"<br>
I need... to hide somewhere...<br>
"Whoa! There's a shopping mall right over there that'd be perfect! Let's go there and hide, Yoshino!"<br>
...Okay.<br>
<br>
Under the cover of several shells going off, the girl and her puppet snuck into the mall.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">???：</span><br>
"Geesh! These guys just attack you for no reason whatsoever! Yoshino, you hurt?"<br>
<br>
The girl faced the trembling hand puppet and shook her head, but then frowned slightly.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Janus：</span><br>
Excuse me... Are you injured?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Yoshino：</span><br>
Whuah?!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">???：</span><br>
"Oh nooo! This place was packed after all, huh?"<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Janus：</span><br>
Th-that's not strictly... Um, well...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Jervis：</span><br>
*sigh*... Janus, let me do the talking.<br>
I'm Jervis, and this is Janus. I'm guessing you ended up here through some happenstance, just as we did.<br>
Janus noticed you were hurt, so she came up to treat you.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Yoshinon：</span><br>
"Well, well! Seems silly Yoshinon mistook you two cuties for enemies! Sorry!"<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Yoshino：</span><br>
I'm... sorry.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Yoshinon：</span><br>
"Yoshinon is Yoshinon, and this is Yoshino."<br>
"Alright, little Janus, think you could tend to Yoshino?"<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Janus：</span><br>
Um, of course! I can do that! Yoshino, let me see your wounds.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Yoshino：</span><br>
O-okay... Please be gentle.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Yoshinon：</span><br>
"Okaaay, where to begin... Ah, right! Jervis, do you know where we are?"<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Jervis：</span><br>
I can't say for certain, but considering everything that's happened so far, we're probably in a Mirror Sea – one of the Sirens' test sites.<br>
Oh, and to be brief, "Sirens" essentially refers to those things outside who attack anyone they see.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Janus：</span><br>
That reminds me... Based on what I've heard from people before, what's happening here sounds a bit like another case of visitors from another world.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Yoshinon：</span><br>
"Ahh! So basically, we're those visitors that little Janus just mentioned!"<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Yoshino：</span><br>
So... we're in another world...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Yoshinon：</span><br>
"This place does look a lot like Tengu City, but when you look really closely, some things are a little different."<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Yoshino：</span><br>
It's like someone made the city from an assortment of buildings...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Jervis：</span><br>
Supposing you are from another world, then there's a high probability that this city is a recreation of Tengu City that the Sirens made with data from your world.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Janus：</span><br>
Okay, I've disinfected your wounds and put bandages on them.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Yoshinon：</span><br>
"Whoooa! Thanks a bunch, little Janus! Yoshino, what's the magic word?"<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Yoshino：</span><br>
Th-thank you...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Yoshinon：</span><br>
"That's a good girl! Okay, so what are you two cuties going to do now?"<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Jervis：</span><br>
Um, Yoshinon, if this place does resemble Tengu City, do you happen to know your way around?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Yoshinon：</span><br>
"Hmm... It just feels familiar. I might know the general way around."<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Jervis：</span><br>
That's more than enough. At least we won't waste time getting lost.<br>
Based on our previous experiences, the Sirens always have a central unit in command. We should try to find it before the reinforcements from the port get here.<br>
That way, we'll be able to neutralise the Sirens at the same time as they arrive, and we'll be able to leave the Mirror Sea.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Yoshinon：</span><br>
"Hooray! Alrighty, then I'll show ya around as best as I can! You better, too, Yoshino!"<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Yoshino：</span><br>
I-I'll... try!<br>

<br>
Yoshino, Jervis, and Janus went and waited in a safe area in the fake Tengu City for a while.<br>
To be precise, Yoshinon discovered the enemy's stronghold while the group was on the way to the safe area.<br>
Having accomplished their most important mission, they then waited in safety for reinforcements to arrive.<br>
Eventually, an airship came into view outside the window.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Yoshinon：</span><br>
"Well, I'll be! Ain't that Kotori's airship?"<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Yoshino：</span><br>
...Fraxinus!<br>
<br>
Possibly thanks to Fraxinus AL's relaying, the patrol squad's long-unresponsive communicators finally came back online.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Kotori Itsuka：</span><br>
At any rate, learning that Yoshino and the two patrollers are safe and sound is the best we could ask for.<br>
You can even say luck is on our side, seeing as they managed to find the enemy's key base in this area.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Yeah. Their safety is the most important of all.<br>
As for the Sirens' base, we'll take our time dealing with it next.<br>

After a joint attack from Fraxinus AL, the Eagle Union, the Royal Navy, and the Northern Parliament, all the enemies in sector four were wiped out.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Yoshinon：</span><br>
"I'm baaack! Aaand...?"<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Yoshino：</span><br>
Oh... Um...<br>
I... I'm... also back...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Kotori Itsuka：</span><br>
Alright, Yoshinon, that's enough teasing her. Welcome back, both of you.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Yoshinon：</span><br>
"I'm sooo glad to see you in one piece, Kotori!"<br>
"And who might this be, hmm? The Commander? You've got a heckin' unique vibe, that's for sure!"<br>
"Pleasure to meet ya!"<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Yoshino：</span><br>
I'm, um... M-my name is Yoshino... And this is Yoshinon.<br>
I-it's... a pleasure to meet you.<br>

<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Amagi(CV)：</span><br>
Ladies, the Commander has finally issued the order for an all-out attack. Are all your respective tasks proceeding as planned?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Mikasa：</span><br>
But of course. My fleet will shoulder the eastern flank.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Unzen：</span><br>
Hakuhou and I shall handle the matter in the east-southeast.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Musashi：</span><br>
The southeast is mine. Shinano, can I entrust you with the south?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Shinano ：</span><br>
Verily.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Akagi：</span><br>
Then that leaves the south-southeast. May Kaga and I take that?<br>
Amagi dearest, you ought to stay with Lady Nagato in the back. You need only sit and wait for good news from us.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Nagato：</span><br>
We know scarcely anything about our foes. You mustn't let your guard down.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Akagi：</span><br>
You needn't worry, Lady Nagato. I've sent out recon planes to scout ahead.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Musashi：</span><br>
Speaking of which, have you caught wind of Ikazuchi and Inazuma?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Akagi：</span><br>
Not yet. I'm still looking for them and the last two Spirits.<br>
Our intel says that they fight by commanding the wind. I thought this would've made it a cinch to find them...<br>
Sadly, as there is abnormal weather affecting this area, I've failed to do so.<br>
That's no cause for concern, though, is it? Ikazuchi and Inazuma are clever. They know how to stay out of trouble.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Musashi：</span><br>
Indeed. I believe it is implausible that they'd put themselves in danger.<br>
I worry not about them, but something else.<br>
In any event, we must rescue them from this anomalous space-time environ as soon as possible.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Amagi(CV)：</span><br>
Of course. Everyone, please make it your top priority to look for the missing persons during the mission.<br>
Should you find them, report it at once. I shall personally handle things.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Akagi：</span><br>
As you say, dear sister.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Amagi(CV)：</span><br>
Miss Gouden Leeuw, I'd be delighted to have your fleet's cooperation when the time comes.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Gouden Leeuw：</span><br>
You shall have it. Given our limited forces, it only makes sense that you Sakurans take the spotlight in this case.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Nagato：</span><br>
Be aware that communications are unreliable within the area. I implore you all to act reasonably and put safety above all else.<br>
That should be all. Sakurans, set forth!<br>

"Bind."<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Kaguya Yamai：</span><br>
Penetrate!<br>
<br>
WHOOOSH!<br>
The ferocious winds whipped up intense waves that swallowed several mass-produced Sirens unable to get out of the way.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Kaguya Yamai：</span><br>
Good heavens, they just keep coming! There's no end to them!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Yuzuru Yamai：</span><br>
"Confirmation. The enemy seems to be growing in numbers. It must be because you're being too flashy."<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Kaguya Yamai：</span><br>
So it's MY fault? You're enjoying yourself too, you know!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Yuzuru Yamai：</span><br>
"Affirmative. It was you who proposed a challenge to see who could defeat the most enemies, Kaguya."<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Kaguya Yamai：</span><br>
Err... Okay, but seriously – there are too damn many of them!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ikazuchi：</span><br>
So that's "Berserk"... They really fight like they're telepathic.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Inazuma：</span><br>
Even so, they won't get anywhere if they keep fighting aimlessly like this.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ikazuchi：</span><br>
True. Cut one enemy down, two take its place.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Inazuma：</span><br>
We should back them up.<br>
<br>
KABOOOM!<br>
The two mysterious girls suddenly burst onto the fierce battlefield.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ikazuchi：</span><br>
Hey, Yamai twins, over here!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Inazuma：</span><br>
The situation is dire. You should retreat.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Kaguya Yamai：</span><br>
Huh?! You know who we are?!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Yuzuru Yamai：</span><br>
"Question. I do not recognize you. Are you acquaintances of Kaguya's?"<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Kaguya Yamai：</span><br>
Uh, pretty sure I don't know 'em...<br>
Strangers, are you Ratatoskr's reinforcements? Or do you serve the AST?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ikazuchi：</span><br>
I went and got dressed and even covered up my gear, and they still think I'm somebody else...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Inazuma：</span><br>
That's to be expected. They can't have imagined they'd encounter someone from another world.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Kaguya Yamai：</span><br>
...Another world? So... You, unfamiliar ones, come from a world beyond our own?!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Yuzuru Yamai：</span><br>
"Shock. I can't believe my ears."<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ikazuchi：</span><br>
No, it's the other way around... You're visitors from beyond OUR world.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Inazuma：</span><br>
Here, in our world, we call those such as you "otherworldly visitors."<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ikazuchi：</span><br>
Anyway, I'm Ikazuchi, type III Akatsuki-class destroyer number three. This is my sister, Inazuma, fourth in our class.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Inazuma：</span><br>
Welcome, Spirits Kaguya Yamai and Yuzuru Yamai, to the world of Azur Lane.<br>
<br>
KABOOOM!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ikazuchi：</span><br>
Oh crap! The Type IV Sirens' chain-hunting system has been triggered! They're closing in on us!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Inazuma：</span><br>
There's no time to stand around and chat. Just trust us.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ikazuchi：</span><br>
We'll show you to someplace safe!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Kaguya Yamai：</span><br>
...You think we should trust them, Yuzuru?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Yuzuru Yamai：</span><br>
"Considering. I conclude that we should prioritize escaping from this encirclement."<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Kaguya Yamai：</span><br>
Yeah, figures! Could be a trap, but we'll think about that after we've broken out of here!<br>

<br>
The Yamai sisters, Ikazuchi, and Inazuma went together around the fake Tengu City for a while.<br>
They found a safe zone and came up with a plan to secretly disrupt the enemy, and then raided a number of Siren supply points.<br>
With Ikazuchi's and Inazuma's help, the Yamai sisters were able to upgrade their riggings using the supplies they captured.<br>
With this newfound strength, they were keen to destroy the Sirens' central base, which held even more supplies.<br>
It was at that moment that an airship came into their view.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Kaguya Yamai：</span><br>
Behold! A giant ship that sails amongst the heavens! Its name, why, it's Fraxinus!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ikazuchi：</span><br>
Get ready!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Inazuma：</span><br>
We're going to get extracted.<br>
<br>
Possibly thanks to Fraxinus AL's relaying, the adventure squad's long-unresponsive communicators finally came back online.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Kotori Itsuka：</span><br>
Commander, Kaguya and Yuzuru provided some intel on multiple crucial enemy areas. We can take them out in order.<br>
Also, those other girls – Ikazuchi and Inazuma, right? They sure are... quirky.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Yeah. They have a habit of saying things that make no sense.<br>
More pertinently, we're nursing a theory that this may be a space-time anomaly, or maybe a large-scale dimensional anomaly. Have you seen anything like it in your world?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Kotori Itsuka：</span><br>
I'm no expert on the subject, so I can't say I have. Kurumi, on the other hand, might have a unique take on it.<br>
However, it doesn't seem like she got dragged into this, so we can't ask her. Next time I get the chance, I'll speak to her about it.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Thank you. I'll leave it to you.<br>

After a joint attack from Fraxinus AL, the Eagle Union, the Sakura Empire, and the Kingdom of Tulipa, all the enemies in sector five were wiped out.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Kaguya Yamai：</span><br>
It is an honor that we should meet, O one by the name of "Commander."<br>
Mwahaha! We are the Children of Typhoon who raze everything! Kaguya Yamai, and...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Yuzuru Yamai：</span><br>
"Concur. Yuzuru Yamai."<br>

<br>
The port's many fleets displayed an eye-opening performance in this battle, as of course did the Spirits.<br>
This was despite their inability to flex their full power, possibly due to some negative effects of having crossed worlds.<br>
Even so, perhaps partly owing to the power of their riggings, there was not a foe who could stop them. They had free rein over the battlefield.<br>
And so, by their powers combined, they were able to clear out all the enemies in this stretch of the sea.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Kotori Itsuka：</span><br>
Whew... Our search and destroy was successful, and we managed to link back up with everyone. Glad everything worked out.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Origami Tobiichi：</span><br>
Now all that's left is finding a way to get home.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Kaguya Yamai：</span><br>
Hmm... Well, yeah, but I also wanna stick around and talk to some of the new friends I've made.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Yuzuru Yamai：</span><br>
"Concur. Our shipgirl friends are very pleasant."<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Yoshinon：</span><br>
"Hey, it's aaall good. If we can return to our original world, it prooobably means we can return here, too! Right, Yoshino?"<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Yoshino：</span><br>
...Yeah. That's true.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Kotori Itsuka：</span><br>
Well, I suppose that's– Hm? Tohka? Commander? What's the matter? You've got expressions like you're at a funeral.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Tohka Yatogami：</span><br>
Hrmh... I am getting a bad premonition.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Same here. Something just doesn't sit right with me.<br>
Up to this point, any abnormal phenomena would start vanishing after we'd destroyed all the crucial Siren infrastructure.<br>
This time, though, the readings on our measuring devices aren't going down one bit. In fact, they're unnaturally stable.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Tohka Yatogami：</span><br>
Exactly. It's as though it's building up to something dangerous.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">TB ：</span><br>
Warning: High energy readings detected at the center of the area. Prepare for impact.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Kotori Itsuka：</span><br>
Wait, what?! Quick, everyone grab on to something!<br>
<br>
BOOOM!<br>
From the previously empty center of the area, a muddy-green shockwave suddenly burst out.<br>
While Fraxinus AL's shields barely managed to withstand it, a chilling impact sound echoed throughout it.<br>
Immediately after, the shockwave spread further and further, dyeing everything in its path a dark green.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Kotori Itsuka：</span><br>
What the hell... is that?<br>
<br>
A new area appeared amidst all the ominous green.<br>
Everything about this area seemed to defy the laws of physics and nature itself.<br>
It was where the Virtual Tower was supposed to be – except now it had taken on a nightmarish appearance.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
......<br>
Memphis, I'm going to call this new place "sector six." Tell all fleets to start scouting it immediately.<br>
Also, tell them not to go into it until further orders are given.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Memphis：</span><br>
Roger!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Kotori Itsuka：</span><br>
Commander, since Fraxinus AL was able to defend against that shockwave, I think it may be able to enter the area.<br>
I suggest we gather intel around the periphery before you send in your main fleets.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Good idea. We need to go see for ourselves what's out there.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Kotori Itsuka：</span><br>
Then we have a plan! Fraxinus AL, go forth!<br>
{{折叠面板|内容结束}}

{{折叠面板|标题=Labyrinth|选项=22|主框=1|样式=primary|展开=是}}
<br>
At the edge of the labyrinth was a spatial distortion visible to the naked eye. A clear warning to not approach recklessly.<br>
Kotori slowed her airship down to the absolute minimum limit, carefully proceeding while testing the shield's limits, scanning the outer peripheries of the labyrinth.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Origami Tobiichi：</span><br>
Hold on–– Kotori, zoom in on the top-left monitor.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Tohka Yatogami：</span><br>
Huh? Is that... Kurumi? Doesn't look like she's moving, either. Is she... dead?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Kotori Itsuka：</span><br>
Since she wasn't with us since the beginning, I thought for sure that she wouldn't get pulled into this...<br>
I can't believe it... In a place like this...<br>
<br>
The monitor undeniably showed the corpse of a young lady dressed in Gothic attire.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Memphis：</span><br>
Is she... one of your friends?!<br>
Damn it... We were too late... But still, we need to hurry up and take her back to the hospital at port!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Kotori Itsuka：</span><br>
Oh... I should've explained this earlier.<br>
Memphis, and of course Commander. Don't worry, this is simply the corpse of one of Kurumi Tokisaki's clones. But of course, that doesn't mean not to worry at all.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
The corpse... of a clone? I'll need you to fill me in on the specifics later, but for now, I'll assume it's just one of her abilities.<br>
––But, the takeaway from this is that another one of your companions is caught up in this mess, and there's a high likelihood she's somewhere in sector six.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Origami Tobiichi：</span><br>
Mhm. Judging from the state of that body, she likely ran into something nasty.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Yoshinon：</span><br>
"Hrmmm... I can't name many people who can push Kurumi to this extent."<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Yoshino：</span><br>
I wonder... if she's okay...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Helena：</span><br>
Commander, we've received the strategy department's conclusion.<br>
According to the recon report, the interior space is a maze even larger and more complex than it appears. However, all the recon planes and mass-produced ships sent inside were able to withdraw safely.<br>
Therefore, we've been cleared to head inside for combat operations.<br>
It should also be noted, however, that all the equipment placed within was subjected to some unknown interference.<br>
According to the report, this interference only grows stronger the deeper inside you go.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Kotori Itsuka：</span><br>
Looks like our best bet is to split up again and make our way in?<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
I agree. Let's decide how to split up our forces and allocate roles before commencing.<br>
On paper, we have the advantage when it comes to raw firepower. We'll have the main fleet sweep the enemy from the outer perimeter working inward, while the airship heads in with a small number of elite troops to rescue our allies.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Kotori Itsuka：</span><br>
Sounds good. Let's go with that.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Memphis, assemble a carrier fleet each from the Royal and Union forces, and a main fleet each from the Sakuran and Iron Blood forces.<br>
Meanwhile, have the other fleets on standby and await the order to launch a full-scale offensive.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Memphis：</span><br>

<br>
While the main fleet launched its simultaneous offensive, the Fraxinus AL was struggling to navigate through the labyrinth.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Kaguya Yamai：</span><br>
Ugh... Didn't we already pass through here?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Yuzuru Yamai：</span><br>
"Concur. This place looks familiar."<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Kotori Itsuka：</span><br>
Hmm... I suppose blowing a hole through the wall and forcing our way through won't work either.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Essex：</span><br>
Commander, we're trying to map out the area, but after our recon planes fly out a certain distance in one direction, they simply return from the opposite direction.<br>
Also... the terrain here seems to constantly be shifting... I'm still trying to assess how long our maps are good for.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Is the space-time anomaly getting worse?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Origami Tobiichi：</span><br>
Space-time anomaly... a distortion of time and space...<br>
Could Kurumi be at the heart of this strange phenomenon...?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Kotori Itsuka：</span><br>
That's an interesting hypothesis. What makes you think that?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Origami Tobiichi：</span><br>
It is not a good idea to venture blindly into an unknown space.<br>
In our case, we first discovered the body of Kurumi Tokisaki's clone before entering the labyrinth.<br>
A corpse showing up in a random area we happened to scan over, immediately after the labyrinth appeared? It's way too convenient to be a coincidence.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Kotori Itsuka：</span><br>
Now that you mention it... So, you're saying she was trying to tell us something?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Origami Tobiichi：</span><br>
It's a possibility. The answer might become clearer if we can find more of her clones.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Yoshinon：</span><br>
"Wooowee! You're such a quick thinker, Origami! Even during a toootally chaotic time like this!"<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Yoshino：</span><br>
In that case... let's go look for Kurumi's other clones...<br>
{{折叠面板|内容结束}}

{{折叠面板|标题=Possibilities|选项=24|主框=1|样式=primary|展开=是}}
<br>
Once we decided on what exactly we were looking for, sure enough, Kurumi's clones started showing up with each turn of the labyrinth.<br>
Each of her clones had been slain in battle, but their old-fashioned flintlocks were always pointed in the same direction – at where the next clone would be waiting.<br>
While the gruesome path they showed us seemed to be the correct one, the space-time anomalies only grew more turbulent as we pushed deeper into the labyrinth.<br>
The space before me split, splitting into multiple paths like the branches of a tree, making it difficult to see which way we were even going.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Origami Tobiichi：</span><br>
The labyrinth... is getting more and more convoluted.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Tohka Yatogami：</span><br>
Everyone, look over there! There seems to be some sort of video playing at each branch of the road!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Kotori Itsuka：</span><br>
Could those be...<br>
<br>
The videos that played at each intersection seemed to represent different possibilities.<br>
In one branch, everyone who came from the other world, Kurumi included, gathered in a large area without splitting up––<br>
Only to be attacked by an entity that had been lying in wait the whole time.<br>
Their powers depleted by the effects of crossing worlds and their riggings unusable, they were no match for the enemy, and were almost completely wiped out.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Is that... the DOS named Ordainer El?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Kotori Itsuka：</span><br>
Do you know the identity of that enemy?<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Yeah. She's a special type of Siren, an extremely powerful one at that... I suspect she's the mastermind behind this incident.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Kotori Itsuka：</span><br>
Don't tell me... she's also gathering energy from nature to create Spirit-like powers...<br>
And trying to grow even stronger by defeating us?!<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
We don't know what her intentions or motivations are. In the long history of our fight against the Sirens, she and her DOS units are a new threat that has only emerged recently.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Kotori Itsuka：</span><br>
...If she has that kind of power, it's no wonder that even Kurumi would be struggling.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Kaguya Yamai：</span><br>
We must rush to her aid immediately!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Yuzuru Yamai：</span><br>
"Question. Which path do we take to do that?"<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Origami Tobiichi：</span><br>
First of all, we should start by checking the videos at each branch.<br>
<br>
At the second branch, Kotori did not attempt to break through, missing her opportunity to rendezvous with our port.<br>
Afterwards, she rescues the Spirits that were stranded at sea herself, leading them into the labyrinth––<br>
Only to never return again.<br>
At the third branch, Kotori and I met up, but the situation was so turbulent that we could not decide on what to do, so we carefully investigated to see how the situation would develop.<br>
However, as soon as we finished our investigation and decided to set out, the space-time anomaly erupted, vanishing in a violent explosion that took everything and everyone within it – including our patrol fleet.<br>
At the fourth branch, we were able to reach the labyrinth just as we currently have, but weren't able to find the clues left behind by Kurumi.<br>
We would continue to wander the labyrinth, ever more agitated, until we were engulfed in an explosion that seemed to collapse the very spatial fabric.<br>
At the fifth branch, we were able to find Kurumi's clues, quickly moving forward by following their lead.<br>
And then...<br>
The video ends abruptly. The last thing I see is Kurumi's face on the screen, smiling as if she had seen the Fraxinus AL––<br>
Her right hand curled into the gesture of holding a gun.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Kotori Itsuka：</span><br>
This is the way. We've got to hurry and back her up!<br>
{{折叠面板|内容结束}}

{{折叠面板|标题=Kurumi Tokisaki|选项=25|主框=1|样式=primary|展开=是}}
<br>
The Fraxinus AL breaks through the labyrinth and leaps forth into a vast space.<br>
Unlike the complex, confined labyrinth that had surrounded us earlier, this place looked more like the theater of a large-scale conventional battle.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Kurumi Tokisaki：</span><br>
Heehee~ How nice of you to finally join me.<br>
<br>
The girl clad in crimson and black runs freely through the Siren forces, creating one explosion after another, her hand waving gently through the air... as if greeting us.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Kotori Itsuka：</span><br>
Phew.... Looks like we made it in time.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Kotori, let's deploy our forces and prepare for surface combat.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Tohka Yatogami：</span><br>
We'll join in as well!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Kaguya Yamai：</span><br>
Let's show those Sirens what we're made of!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Yuzuru Yamai：</span><br>
"Concur. Let's go wild."<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Yoshinon：</span><br>
"CHAAAAARGE! Let's wipe 'em all out!"<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Yoshino：</span><br>
Y-yes...! Let's go!<br>

<br>
Our furious offensive was starting to cause the massive Siren fleet to crumble.<br>
After crossing through the smoke and haze, I finally came face-to-face with the final visitor from another world.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Kurumi Tokisaki：</span><br>
Now then, I suppose I should introduce myself. A pleasure to meet you – my name is Kurumi Tokisaki. And who might you be, brave Commander?<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Nice meeting you, Kurumi. I'm {playername}, the leader of Azur Lane's port.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Kotori Itsuka：</span><br>
Kurumi, we made our way here following the clues you left us.<br>
Mind explaining the situation to us? Seems like you still have ample breathing room to be your usual self.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Kurumi Tokisaki：</span><br>
Heehee... Is that how it looks to you? I'm actually in quite the rough spot here, you know?<br>
Dear friends, what you see in front of you is only a small sliver of this endless battlefield.<br>
Now, please allow me to reveal to you the true nature of this space––<br>
<br>
*snap*<br>
As soon as Kurumi snaps her fingers, the entire scenery around us changes.<br>
We now find ourselves in the middle of a battlefield where two armies are clashing violently.<br>
On one side is a countless number of Kurumi clones. On the other, an endless stream of Siren machines.<br>
Severed limbs and shattered wreckages floated in a sea of flame, an imposing shadow looming on the distant horizon.<br>
<span style="color:#ff9b93;">Ordainer El：</span><br>
......<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Kurumi Tokisaki：</span><br>
Now, you see this space for what it truly is.<br>
Here... I have already been fighting for a long, long time. Had you arrived even a little later, we would have lost our chance to stop this terrifying monstrosity.<br>
Heehee... But now that everyone's here at last, we can finally take down this accursed thing.<br>
As you can see, it's been there this whole time... but for some reason, I am unable to touch it.<br>
But, as you whittle down the enemy's forces, it seems to become more and more corporeal.<br>
A pretty straightforward rule, wouldn't you say? Heehee.<br>
Well, that's everything on my end. Now, if you'd please, I have an endless battle to attend to.<br>
Now then, everyone, please make due haste.<br>

At last, the time has come to tip the scales of this endless war of attrition.<br>
With most of the Siren forces decimated, the illusory DOS Ordainer gradually became more corporeal.<br>
<span style="color:#ff9b93;">Ordainer El：</span><br>
......<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Kotori Itsuka：</span><br>

<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Kurumi Tokisaki：</span><br>
It's over... It's finally over.<br>
Well then, as much as I enjoyed my time here... I hope we never meet again.<br>
*BANG*<br>
<br>
Under the withering onslaught of the Spirits as well as the shipgirls, the gigantic figure slowly fizzles into the aether and disappears.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">TB ：</span><br>
Commander, the spatial anomaly index is decreasing.<br>
Conjecture: This space is about to collapse. Recommendation: Escape immediately.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Helena：</span><br>
Commander, did we do it? Did we win?<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Yeah... But, I have a feeling this isn't the end.<br>
From beginning to end, Ordainer El did nothing to intervene...<br>
An enemy that solely relies on mass-produced ships, with no combat capabilities herself... I can't believe there would be a high-ranking Siren like this...<br>
<span style="color:#ff9b93;">Ordainer El：</span><br>
No... This time, it's truly over.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
...So you weren't defeated after all.<br>
Where exactly am I? And what are you planning?<br>
<span style="color:#ff9b93;">Ordainer El：</span><br>
Some things are simply preordained to happen.<br>
We have no say in the matter; neither you, nor I.<br>
All we can do is seek the most advantageous solution.<br>
Your response this time was simply superior, and I look forward to the next time.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
...What do you mean by "next time"?<br>
<span style="color:#ff9b93;">Ordainer El：</span><br>
Of course–– {playername}, do you know what it means to "ordain"?<br>
<br>
As the space-time anomaly fades, the blue sea and sky regain their former appearance.<br>
After confirming that the Virtual Tower was calm once more, I heightened its surveillance, then began to withdraw the fleets one by one.<br>
The Spirits aboard the Fraxinus AL also stopped by the port, waiting for Akashi to find a way to send them back home.<br>
The battle left much to think about, but that seems to always be the case when it comes to confrontations with high-level Sirens.<br>
But at the end of the day, if she ever shows up again, I'll just beat her back to wherever she came from.<br>
At least, this battle... is finally over.<br>
––DATE A LANE: THE END<br>
