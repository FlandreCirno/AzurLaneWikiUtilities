1 Libeccio Has A Dream!<br>
One day at the office...<br>
<span style="color:#A9F548FF;">Littorio：</span><br>
This is the last batch of documents needing your approval. Go ahead and sign off on them after you've had a look.<br>
<br>
"Crazy. Looks like I'm actually going to get off work at a normal time today."<br>
<span style="color:#A9F548FF;">Littorio：</span><br>
Heh. With Littorio at your side, it's only natural that your work efficiency would go through the roof.<br>
In any case, I shall take my leave. I do hope you enjoy this rare afternoon of leisure and get to rest early.<br>
<br>
*knock* *knock*<br>
<span style="color:#A9F548FF;">Libeccio：</span><br>
Ciao, Commander!<br>
Ah, Littorio's here as well! Hooray!<br>
<span style="color:#A9F548FF;">Littorio：</span><br>
Hello there, Libeccio. What are you hooraying about?<br>
<span style="color:#A9F548FF;">Libeccio：</span><br>
Commander, Littorio! I, Libeccio, have a dream – to be a secretary ship as well!<br>
<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项1："That's a great dream!"</span>'''''<br>

<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项2）</span>'''''Since I finished work ahead of time today, I suppose I could spare some time to play with Libeccio.<br>
<span style="color:#A9F548FF;">Libeccio：</span><br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项2）</span>'''''Ehh? I was being serious, Commander! I've already done my preparations for becoming the secretary ship!<br>

'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项2）</span>'''''What do you mean by "preparations?"<br>
<span style="color:#A9F548FF;">Libeccio：</span><br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项2）</span>'''''Heh heh, allow me to show you! Look, it's the "Secretary Ship Strategy Guide" that Maestrale wrote for me!<br>
<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项2）</span>'''''Libeccio takes out a piece of paper with notes scribbled all over it.<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项2）</span>'''''As expected, Maestrale's attentiveness to detail is nothing to sneeze at.<br>

'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项2）</span>'''''She does seem to be taking this seriously. Commander, why not give her a trial period?<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项2）</span>'''''You can't judge a book by its cover, and you'll never know what she's capable of until you let her try.<br>
<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项2）</span>'''''"That's true, but..."<br>
<span style="color:#A9F548FF;">Libeccio：</span><br>

2 A Series of Secretarial Slip-Ups?<br>
Office – The next day<br>
<span style="color:#A9F548FF;">Libeccio：</span><br>
Ciao~ Err, I mean... Good morning, Commander.<br>
<br>
Libeccio greeted me in the same energetic way she always did, except suddenly she seemed to realize something. Modifying her behavior halfway, she curtsies politely, perhaps having something to do with the content of her "strategy guide."<br>
<span style="color:#A9F548FF;">Libeccio：</span><br>
(Um, if I remember right, I put my hands on the hem of my skirt like this and...)<br>
Destroyer Libeccio of Sardegna, reporting for duty. I am here to send my warm regards this wonderful morning––!<br>
<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项1："Buongiorno."</span>'''''<br>
<span style="color:#A9F548FF;">Libeccio：</span><br>
Let us not waste any time! First, I'll prepare the tea for you! Um, if I remember right, Maestrale said the tea bags were...<br>
Oh, over here! Now to find the tea set...<br>
Commander, the tea is ready. Next up is getting all the documents organized, right?<br>
Hehe, piece of cake! All the stamped documents go over here, and the ones that still need to be checked go in this other pile––<br>
<br>
Huh, she seems to be... pretty good at this? Maybe I was psyching myself out over nothing.<br>
I bring the cup of tea that was just served to me to my lips... Cold. The tea bag had been steeped in cold water.<br>
<span style="color:#A9F548FF;">Libeccio：</span><br>
Wha? Huh? Did I forget to boil the water? I really... just poured tap water over the tea bag?<br>
I'm so sorry, Commander! I'll get you a new cup right away!<br>
Eep––!<br>
<br>
Just as Libeccio starts to run, she slips on something and reaches out towards the desk to break her fall.<br>
<span style="color:#A9F548FF;">Libeccio：</span><br>
Owwie, that was a close one... Gah! The documents!<br>
<br>
Due to the force of the collision, all the papers on the desk are knocked over, strewn all over the place and even more disorderly than before.<br>
Well, at least she didn't drop the teacup...<br>
<span style="color:#A9F548FF;">Libeccio：</span><br>
Ugh... I'm so sorry, Commander, I'll clean everything up...<br>
<br>
*knock* *knock*<br>
<span style="color:#A9F548FF;">Maestrale：</span><br>
Ah, um, excuse me... I got a little worried so I'm here to check on how Libeccio is doing...<br>
<span style="color:#A9F548FF;">Libeccio：</span><br>
Maestraleeeee! Help meeeee!<br>
<span style="color:#A9F548FF;">Maestrale：</span><br>
Wh-what's the matter, Libeccio?<br>
<br>
Thanks to Maestrale, we were able to get everything back on track.<br>

3 A Secretary Ship's Growth<br>
<span style="color:#A9F548FF;">Libeccio：</span><br>
Commander, here's the tea I made today!<br>
I made sure to keep an eye on the time and temperature, so I'm sure it came out fine today!<br>
<br>
I bring the cup of tea to my lips again. It certainly has the right warmth and fragrance.<br>
<span style="color:#A9F548FF;">Libeccio：</span><br>
So what'd you think, Commander?<br>
<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项1："It's an improvement!"</span>'''''<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项2："Your choice of tea was pretty good too."</span>'''''<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项3："Better than expected."</span>'''''<br>
<span style="color:#A9F548FF;">Libeccio：</span><br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项1）</span>'''''Phew... Thank goodness!<br>
<span style="color:#A9F548FF;">Libeccio：</span><br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项2）</span>'''''Would you prefer if I used loose leaves instead of a tea bag next time?<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项2）</span>'''''Oh, but Maestrale said that I wasn't allowed to use the tea leaves until all the tea bags have been finished!<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项2）</span>'''''Hmph... That just means I need to train harder until I've mastered the art of tea!<br>
<span style="color:#A9F548FF;">Libeccio：</span><br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项3）</span>'''''Ehehe, that means you recognize that I'm getting better! Right, Commander?<br>
<span style="color:#A9F548FF;">Libeccio：</span><br>
Also, I've finished sorting out the documents! Here, you can take a look!<br>
<br>
From a glance, it certainly seems like she grouped the documents correctly. Infinitely better than yesterday's pile of documents scattered all over the ground.<br>
<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项4："Good work, Libeccio."</span>'''''<br>
<span style="color:#A9F548FF;">Libeccio：</span><br>
Ehehe, thank you, thank you~<br>
But, I can't let this get to my head!<br>
<br>
While reading over the documents, I notice from the corner of my eye that Libeccio's teacup is totally empty.<br>
<span style="color:#A9F548FF;">Libeccio：</span><br>
Well, um... Promise me you won't laugh!<br>
To be honest... After what happened the other day, Maestrale made me take a whole bunch of lessons on how to be a secretary ship...<br>
And she had me drink so much tea that I can't even stand the thought of having another sip...<br>

*knock* *knock*<br>
<span style="color:#A9F548FF;">Z23：</span><br>
Excuse me, Commander. I'm here to report the results of the wargame.<br>
<span style="color:#A9F548FF;">Libeccio：</span><br>
Got it! Good job, Z23!<br>
<span style="color:#A9F548FF;">Z23：</span><br>
You too, Libeccio. If there's anything you need help with, feel free to ask me.<br>
<span style="color:#A9F548FF;">Libeccio：</span><br>
Mhm, I appreciate it! I'll take you up on that later!<br>
<span style="color:#A9F548FF;">Z23：</span><br>
Ahem... In any case, Commander, I shall now take my leave.<br>
<span style="color:#A9F548FF;">Libeccio：</span><br>
She's quite the hard worker, isn't she?<br>
<br>
*knock* *knock*<br>
<span style="color:#A9F548FF;">Laffey：</span><br>
Oh, good afternoon, you two...<br>
Here, documents... Laffey, isn't sleepy at all...<br>
<span style="color:#A9F548FF;">Libeccio：</span><br>
Are you tired, Laffey? Did you want something to hold on to?<br>
I got an extra blanket for you, so you can take a nap on the sofa if you'd like! After I'm done with work, we can go outside and play!<br>
<span style="color:#A9F548FF;">Laffey：</span><br>
Mm... Okay... Zzzzzz...<br>
<span style="color:#A9F548FF;">Libeccio：</span><br>
Woah, she fell asleep in the blink of an eye! Commander, I'm going to fetch the blanket for her~<br>
<br>
*knock* *knock*<br>
<span style="color:#A9F548FF;">Ayanami：</span><br>
...Commander, I've brought the commission list, yes.<br>
Oh, Libeccio... I also brought the game you asked me to lend you last time.<br>
<span style="color:#A9F548FF;">Libeccio：</span><br>
Woah! Thanks a lot! Just give me a moment to check the commissions.<br>
<span style="color:#A9F548FF;">Ayanami：</span><br>
I'll be returning to my room then. If you get stuck anywhere in the game, you know how to reach me.<br>
Ayanami out.<br>
<span style="color:#A9F548FF;">Libeccio：</span><br>
Bye bye~<br>
<br>
*knock* *knock*<br>
<span style="color:#A9F548FF;">Javelin：</span><br>
Commander! And Libe too! You two must be tired, so I brought some snacks! Want to take a break?<br>
<span style="color:#A9F548FF;">Libeccio：</span><br>
Yaaay! You always make the best snacks, Javelin!<br>
<span style="color:#A9F548FF;">Javelin：</span><br>
Ehehe~ That's because I learned from the very best, the Royal Maids!<br>
<span style="color:#A9F548FF;">Libeccio：</span><br>
What do you think, Commander? Pretty good, huh?<br>
<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项1："They're delicious!"</span>'''''<br>
<span style="color:#A9F548FF;">Javelin：</span><br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项1）</span>'''''Hehe! Seeing as how you're both huge fans, I'll make more next time!<br>

5 The Great Friendship Operation<br>
I always knew that Libeccio was friendly and outgoing, but I had no idea she already managed to make so many friends.<br>
<span style="color:#A9F548FF;">Libeccio：</span><br>
That's the power of the secretary ship! I get to meet all sorts of shipgirls, so of course we'd get to know each other!<br>
I want everyone to be friends with Maestrale too...<br>
<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项1："She is a lot more reserved than you after all––"</span>'''''<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项2："How do you plan to do that?"</span>'''''<br>
<span style="color:#A9F548FF;">Libeccio：</span><br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项1）</span>'''''Mm... She does tend to think about all sorts of complicated things...<br>
<span style="color:#A9F548FF;">Libeccio：</span><br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项2）</span>'''''Well, every time she tries to make friends, she always seems to get cold feet...<br>
<span style="color:#A9F548FF;">Libeccio：</span><br>
Everyone here is so nice though... I'm sure if they got to know her better, they'd get along just fine!<br>
And that's where I come in!<br>
I want to introduce all my friends to Maestrale! What do you think of that, Commander?<br>
<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项1："I think that's a good idea."</span>'''''<br>
<span style="color:#A9F548FF;">Libeccio：</span><br>
Ehehe, first of all is Z23! She might be the serious type, but she's also caring and reliable! I've learned all sorts of things from her!<br>
<br>
"Given their serious personalities, I'm sure Z23 and Maestrale would be able to find common ground."<br>
<span style="color:#A9F548FF;">Libeccio：</span><br>
Laffey is... always so warm and fuzzy! When I'm with her, she always makes me feel warm and fuzzy as well!<br>
Plus, she knows where the best napping spots are!<br>
<br>
"That's a good point. I'm sure Laffey would be able to help Maestrale unwind."<br>
<span style="color:#A9F548FF;">Libeccio：</span><br>
Ayanami loves to play games, and she's super good at them too! The two of us play all sorts of games together!<br>
Playing games together is always a great way to meet lots of people!<br>
<br>
"I suppose it's true that you meet all sorts of people on the internet."<br>
<span style="color:#A9F548FF;">Libeccio：</span><br>
Javelin is super nice and outgoing, and she's just so easy to get along with!<br>
<br>
"Her bubbly personality is pretty infectious, and everyone who's met her can attest to that."<br>
<span style="color:#A9F548FF;">Libeccio：</span><br>
That's right! You really understand everyone too, Commander!<br>
As for my other friends... Hmm, there are so many nice girls here, I don't know who to introduce to Maestrale next!<br>
Do you have any suggestions, Commander?<br>
<br>
"It doesn't have to be one person. Why not introduce everyone?"<br>
<span style="color:#A9F548FF;">Libeccio：</span><br>
Everyone? I see, that's a great idea!<br>
Thanks for the advice, Commander! I should go see what a good time is for everyone...<br>
<br>
Seeing Libeccio's bright expression, I couldn't help but cheer for her operation to be a huge success.<br>

6 Libeccio's Plan<br>
Office - A few days later<br>
<span style="color:#A9F548FF;">Libeccio：</span><br>
Commander, I've finished sorting out all your documents. Just sign here after you've looked over everything!<br>
The documents that can be shredded are in this stack over here.<br>
<br>
I originally was afraid Libeccio only wanted the secretary position because she thought it'd be fun, but turns out, she has been taking her work very seriously.<br>
She deserved some recognition for being so dedicated to her job.<br>
<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项1："You've been a great help, Libeccio."</span>'''''<br>
<span style="color:#A9F548FF;">Libeccio：</span><br>
Ehehe... To be honest, at first, I didn't know if I would be able to do this job well.<br>
Plus, there are other reasons I wanted to be the secretary ship. Thankfully, you didn't even bother asking me why.<br>
<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项1："...Other reasons?"</span>'''''<br>
<span style="color:#A9F548FF;">Libeccio：</span><br>
Heehee! You know what's special about being the secretary? They get to spend the most time with you, Commander~!<br>
You're always so busy every day. Even though Maestrale's written out your schedule and told me when you have free time, sometimes you have other things to take care of even when you're not working!<br>
That's why I decided to be the secretary! That way, I'd get to spend every day with you!<br>
And I get to meet so many new friends around the port. I can even help Maestrale make friends too!<br>
Ehehe, two birds with one stone, right?<br>
But... my rotation as secretary is about to end, isn't it... After that, I won't get to see you as much...<br>
<br>
Libeccio's voice falters a bit, and she lowers her head.<br>
Setting aside the secretary ship's duties, all of those things were true...<br>
But being the secretary is a difficult job. And Libeccio persevered through her duties very admirably.<br>
<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项1：Pat Libeccio's head.</span>'''''<br>
<span style="color:#A9F548FF;">Libeccio：</span><br>
Commander?<br>
<br>
"Even if you're not the secretary anymore, I'll find time to play with you."<br>
<span style="color:#A9F548FF;">Libeccio：</span><br>
You'll make time for me? Really?<br>
<br>
Of course. We can also keep helping Maestrale make more friends.<br>
<span style="color:#A9F548FF;">Libeccio：</span><br>
That'd be great! It's a pinky promise then?<br>
<br>
With a radiant smile on her face, Libeccio extends her pinky to me.<br>
<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项1："It's a pinky promise."</span>'''''<br>
<span style="color:#A9F548FF;">Libeccio：</span><br>
You'd better not break that promise then! Not in a hundred years!<br>
<br>
And soon, the last day of Libeccio's secretary duties arrives.<br>

7 You Can Do It, Libeccio!<br>
Port - Main Plaza<br>
Today is Libeccio's last day as secretary, and I was making my way back to the office from the piers, when suddenly––<br>
<span style="color:#A9F548FF;">Libeccio：</span><br>
I guess I made it, huh... It'll be nice to sleep in tomorrow~<br>
Ehehe~ Commander, getting to spend so much time with you was an absolute blast, but being the secretary is really tough after all.<br>
Working so much all the time makes you want to take it easy from time to time, doesn't it? Have you ever wanted to just stay home, Commander?<br>
<br>
Well, uh...<br>
<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项1："Of course."</span>'''''<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项2："Of course not."</span>'''''<br>
<span style="color:#A9F548FF;">Libeccio：</span><br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项1）</span>'''''Riiiight? In that case, come play with me!<br>
<span style="color:#A9F548FF;">Libeccio：</span><br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项2）</span>'''''Woahhh... That's super crazy!<br>
<span style="color:#A9F548FF;">Libeccio：</span><br>
Oh, look, isn't that Maestrale over there...?<br>
<br>
My eyes follow in the direction Libeccio is pointing, and there I see Maestrale, walking alongside Laffey, Ayanami, and Z23.<br>
<span style="color:#A9F548FF;">Libeccio：</span><br>
Good afternoon, everyone~!<br>
<span style="color:#A9F548FF;">Maestrale：</span><br>
Oh, it's Libeccio and the Commander! G-good afternoon!<br>
<span style="color:#A9F548FF;">Ayanami：</span><br>
Good afternoon, yes.<br>
<span style="color:#A9F548FF;">Z23：</span><br>
Hello, you two.<br>
<span style="color:#A9F548FF;">Laffey：</span><br>
'ello... Would you like to join our tea party as well?<br>
<span style="color:#A9F548FF;">Z23：</span><br>
Stop that, Laffey! The Commander is still working!<br>
<span style="color:#A9F548FF;">Laffey：</span><br>
Mm... Maybe next time then...<br>
<span style="color:#A9F548FF;">Libeccio：</span><br>
Were you going to throw a tea party?<br>
<span style="color:#A9F548FF;">Z23：</span><br>
Not quite. Javelin invited us to attend the Royal Navy's tea party.<br>
<span style="color:#A9F548FF;">Libeccio：</span><br>
I see, I see! That sounds fun! Have a good time over there, Maestrale!<br>
<span style="color:#A9F548FF;">Maestrale：</span><br>
Th-thank you...<br>
<br>
Office - Soon afterwards<br>
<span style="color:#A9F548FF;">Libeccio：</span><br>
Heh heh, Libeccio's secretary operation was a huge success!<br>
I did a good job with my work, and I even got to help Maestrale make friends! Libeccio is super awesome!<br>
<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项1："You sure are, Libeccio~"</span>'''''<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项2："Brava, Libeccio!"</span>'''''<br>
<span style="color:#A9F548FF;">Libeccio：</span><br>
Ehehe... I'll go make some tea for you, Commander~<br>
Here you go, your very last cup of Secretary Libeccio's tea!<br>
<br>
Seeing Libeccio's time as secretary come to an end was a little bittersweet, but I was proud of how much she had grown during this short time.<br>
I bring the cup of tea that was just served to me to my lips...<br>
<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项1：Cold. The tea bag had been steeped in cold water...</span>'''''<br>
<span style="color:#A9F548FF;">Libeccio：</span><br>
Ehh? Did I mess up?! I'm so sorry!<br>
Wh-wh-what should I do? We're out of tea bags... I'm sorry–!<br>
<br>
Having that said, she still has a lot more growing to do––<br>
