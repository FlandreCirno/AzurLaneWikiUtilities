<br>
Chapter 1 - Charge, Kent! <br>
...... *Knock knock*.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Kent：</span><br>
Excuse me! Commander, thanks for―<br>
<br>
Kent throws open the door like the bundle of energy she is, while still somehow managing to deliver the proper polite pleasantries.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Kent：</span><br>
...What’s that? I should relax and be myself? Ahahaha... I guess I am a bit nervous...<br>
I’m so glad you chose me to be your secretary, Commander! I’ll worker harder than you ever thought possible!<br>
<br>
As soon as Kent finishes speaking, she dives straight into her work.<br>
I was a little worried at first, unsure if she could handle both maid and secretarial work, but...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Kent：</span><br>
Hey! Commander, don’t just stand there gawking, you’ve got work to do too! Come on!<br>
<br>
Sure enough... I hurry to my seat and start planning the next day’s exercises—<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Kent：</span><br>
Any trouble with your work, Commander?<br>
<br>
While taking the tea she brewed for me, I realize that I have indeed been working very focused for some time now...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Kent：</span><br>
You’ve really been going at it for while. You’ve earned a rest!<br>
<br>
Kent flashes a dazzling smile. A quick look behind her reveals that my office turned sparkly clean at some point.<br>
Even the paperwork on the table is well organized. I guess you’d expect as much from one of the maids...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Kent：</span><br>
Heh heh~ I am a proper maid, you know! And I’m not even a little bit tired. Just tell me what to do next!<br>
<br>
It seems like she’s having no trouble at all handling both her secretary and maid duties. But just as I’m pondering leaving everything in her capable hands...<br>
...I hear a rustling!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Kent：</span><br>
Ah! Look out! Commander, there’s a bug!<br>
<br>
By the time the words have left her mouth, Kent is already dashing after the bug crawling across the floor. And in that moment...<br>
CRASH!!!!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Kent：</span><br>
Aww...! I just swept the floor...<br>
<br>
Kent looks wistfully at the bucket of water she just knocked over while chasing the bug.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Kent：</span><br>
What can I say, Commander...? Ahaha.<br>
R-right! I thought I’d have to mop the floor again, so I put the bucket there, and, well...<br>
<br>
She starts looking for the missing bug as she speaks.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Kent：</span><br>
Alright! Just let me take care of this first and I’ll get right back to the floor. It’ll only take a moment! Now where is the little devil?!<br>
<br>
...How do I put this? I guess I finally see the Kent I’m used to?<br>
She’s reckless, and a bit brash, but that’s just the rough around her edges. It’s that positive attitude she brings to every situation that’s truly inspiring.<br>

Chapter 2 - Kent the Unbeatable! <br>
The first day may have seen a couple reckless accidents, but since then Kent has been handling her secretarial duties just fine.<br>
And honestly, with all the work to be done around here, she does make things easier.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Kent：</span><br>
Done with my maid work! Time for secretary business!<br>
<br>
Kent strides into the office with the same bright smile she always has. If only I could seize a share of that boundless energy...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Kent：</span><br>
Wait! Commander!<br>
<br>
Just as I’m putting my papers back on the shelf, a loud shout from Kent stops me.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Kent：</span><br>
Let me see your sleeve?<br>
<br>
I extend my arm, as requested... and Kent takes a moment to observe my sleeve—<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Kent：</span><br>
Hmmm... So this button is misaligned.<br>
Righto, Commander. Have a seat.<br>
<br>
Kent takes out a sewing kit from her apron, sits strikingly close to me, and starts in with her needle.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Kent：</span><br>
I started carrying the sewing kit to fix all the buttons Suffolk loses while she works. Lucky, that~<br>
Almost done. Don’t move...<br>
<br>
Kent pulls my arm right up against her chest, and I keep my eyes locked firmly on her practiced technique...<br>
Gulp...<br>
I, erm... suddenly feel like my eyes are wandering.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Kent：</span><br>
You think I’m wearing too little? Oh... But if my clothes are too heavy, it’s a pain to get around...<br>
We’ll come back to that one, Commander, I can’t sew with you that far from me! Get over here! C’mon! Right up against me!<br>
<br>
With my resistance faltering and me very nearly smushing into her, Kent finally finishes sewing the button.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Kent：</span><br>
Stay still~ done! Lovely, that!<br>
And Bob’s your uncle! Mmhmm. What a fine job I did!<br>
<br>
Without even checking her work, she hurries to her feet.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Kent：</span><br>
Oh? What’s the matter, Commander? You seemed a tad off just now?<br>
Oh, never mind! We’ve got way too much to do today! Call me if you need my help!<br>
<br>
Kent flashes a carefree smile.<br>
Seeing that smile makes me banish the thought of calling out her carelessness.<br>
But I still file it away to bring up with her someday, gently...<br>

Chapter 3 - Feelings of Gratitude!<br>
Kent is later than usual today. Maybe she had a lot of maid business to take care of...?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Kent：</span><br>
―Sorry, Commander! I had a lot of maid business to take care of, that’s why I’m late!<br>
I’ll have your tea in a moment― Oh, where’s the kettle? I thought I left it in the cupboard―<br>
<br>
Seeing Kent scurrying around all flustered, I get up and shake my head.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Kent：</span><br>
You don’t want tea...? Hm? I’ll make mistakes when I’m too anxious...?<br>
C-come on! Commander, I... Well, you’re not wrong...<br>
Inhaaale... Exhaaale...<br>
...Okay! Hehe, I’m nice and calm now.<br>
<br>
After finishing her thought, Kent pats at her chest and sits down.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Kent：</span><br>
Anyway,Anyway, you really know me well, eh, Commander? I feel like you can see right through me!<br>
<br>
I’d say there are still a lot of things I’d like to ask Kent—<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Kent：</span><br>
Why do I talk like this? And why do I call myself Contestant Kent...? Ahaha, that’s what you’re wondering about?<br>
<br>
Kent flashes a wonderful smile, balls her hands into fists, and raises them to the ceiling.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Kent：</span><br>
For absolutely no particular reason whatsoever!<br>
I just think that if you put a lot of energy into your words, you’ll get other people excited along with you!<br>
<br>
She’s downplaying a bit, sure, but her explanation still shows how she cares for the people around her.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Kent：</span><br>
Oh! How about this! Let’s have you give it a try, Commander! Come out and say something just like I would! Anything!<br>
<br>
She rattles me with her sudden challenge, but——<br>
<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项1：Thank you, you really mean a lot to me.</span>'''''<br>
<br>
...I express my heartfelt gratitude to Kent.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Kent：</span><br>
......?!<br>
L-let’s call it a day here! Commander... You, you can’t be so direct with these things... Oh my! I’m thirsty! I’ll make some tea!<br>
<br>
After watching Kent rocket to her feet and hurry off to hide her embarrassment, I stand up to go after her.<br>
She’s sure to be careless in her heightened emotional state, and all my teaware is in danger—<br>

Chapter 4 - Just Happened To! <br>
With my work done, for the time being, I stretch and peer out the window to find a beautiful, sunny day.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Kent：</span><br>
Lovely... Commander. Heading out for a walk on such a nice day would hit the spot, eh?<br>
And after being cooped up in the office so much lately...<br>
<br>
She’s right. I’ve been so busy with work, I haven’t seen much of the sun.<br>
A walk every now and then is fine. I’ll head out with Kent.<br>
Port - Outside the Office<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Kent：</span><br>
That’s about enough! Back to the office th— Hm? Is that... Bismarck... and Prince of Wales?<br>
<br>
Following Kent’s pointer finger, I see two figures standing under a large tree.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Bismarck：</span><br>
If it isn’t the Commander and... Kent, is it...?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Prince of Wales：</span><br>
"An unusual pairing"v...? No, we just bump into each other here from time to time.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Kent：</span><br>
You just happen to, eh? So what do you do here?<br>
<br>
Suddenly, I hear a faint mewling sound overhead.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Kent：</span><br>
Is that... a cat?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Bismarck：</span><br>
Oh, there you are.<br>
<br>
Bismarck lifts the brim of her hat and gestures with her eyes toward the top of the tree.<br>
Following her gaze, I see a kitten clinging tightly to a high branch.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Prince of Wales：</span><br>
It seems its curiosity spurred it upwards, and now it can no longer get down.<br>
<br>
Wales looks at the kitten, her tone revealing her concern. Bismarck seems to share that, but...<br>
Getting the cat down will be no easy feat. We could get a ladder or something from Akashi...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Kent：</span><br>
Hey! You can leave this to Contestant Kent!<br>
<br>
Kent makes her bold declaration without hesitation.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Kent：</span><br>
I have more than just physical strength! My competitive spirit is unrivaled among the Royal Maids!<br>
Climbing a tree is a piece of cake for this Kent! Watch me get that kitty right down!<br>

Chapter 5 - Kent's Secret! (?)<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Kent：</span><br>
Up the tree I go! One~ Two~ Oof!<br>
<br>
Kent grabs a thick branch with both hands and flips herself up the tree.<br>
Before I can be moved by her feat, she’s already climbed even higher.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Kent：</span><br>
Stay right there, kitty~ Kent’s gonna save you. Just a little longer...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Prince of Wales：</span><br>
She’s so nimble... But couldn’t she stand to be a bit more ladylike?<br>
<br>
True... with her climbing that tree in her dress, I’m back to my wandering eye problem... and such idle thoughts occupy my mind—<br>
Creaaak...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Bismarck：</span><br>
Oh no! The kitten’s branch is about to break...<br>
<br>
The sound draws our attention and we look to see the slowly bending branch giving way under the weight of the kitten.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Kent：</span><br>
Don’t worry! I’ve almost got you! I’ll be there in a second, don’t be scared―<br>
<br>
The same instant Kent stretches out her hand, the branch buckles and snaps off.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Kent：</span><br>
Aaahh!<br>
<br>
I throw out my arms to the falling kitten...<br>
Just in the nick of time. It plops right into my hands.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Kent：</span><br>
Nice! Great job, Commander!<br>
<br>
Kent’s happy voice calls down from overhead, and the kitten in my arms meows softly, with apparent relief.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Bismarck：</span><br>
Phew... I wasn’t sure what would happen there.<br>
<br>
Bismarck and Prince of Wales share similar expressions of relief, and quickly turn around as if to leave.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Bismarck：</span><br>
As the little on is unharmed, I’ll be on my way, Commander.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Prince of Wales：</span><br>
Be sure to take the kitten somewhere safe, Commander. I’m off too—<br>
<br>
The two who were once so concerned for a tiny kitten now beat a hasty retreat.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Kent：</span><br>
Oh, those two really can’t be honest with themselves. They obviously love cats.<br>
<br>
The threads of fate tied the both of them together with cats... didn’t they?<br>
Kent smiles and strokes the kitten. Could the same fate have cats for her too?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Kent：</span><br>
What? Did the threads of fate tie me up with cats just like those two?<br>
Truth be told, I do have a thing for felines, but I’m more of a tiger girl than a housecat one!<br>
<br>
Tigers... I guess I shouldn’t be surprised she’d go for the big cats.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Kent：</span><br>
Speaking of, I should probably head home. It’s been a long time since I slept with that one. He’s probably getting pretty lonely.<br>
Yep, we’ll talk about tigers later!<br>
<br>
Huh...? Don’t tell me Kent’s keeping a tiger as a pet.<br>

Chapter 6 - A Light in the Darkness! <br>
Here in the dead of night, just before the clock ticks over to the new day, I come to the very last of my reports.<br>
As I’m about to clear it, I suddenly realize I’m missing a page... I think I know what happened...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Kent：</span><br>
Then I’ll be off, if you insist! You’ve also been working very hard today, Commander!<br>
Oh! I already filed all the papers just the way you asked me to! Good night!<br>
<br>
...The missing page must be in with those documents she filed earlier.<br>
A quick rummage through the filing cabinets didn’t turn up what I was looking for.<br>
But I need this done today... I guess I have to go ask her.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Kent：</span><br>
―We’ll talk about tigers later!<br>
<br>
Kent’s words after the kitten rescue suddenly flash through my head.<br>
There’s no way she’s actually got a pet tiger... right? With some apprehension, I drag myself to Kent’s door.<br>
I knock lightly.<br>
...No answer. I try turning the handle, not expecting it to so easily swing open.<br>
She needs to be more careful... I try calling out to her from the entryway...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Kent：</span><br>
―Huh...? Commander?<br>
<br>
Her sleepy voice calls back from the inside room. Relieved, I walk in and try to find her.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Kent：</span><br>
...What is it? I didn’t expect you so late... Yawn...<br>
<br>
I grope around for the light switch while explaining the situation, to no avail.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Kent：</span><br>
Oh, the only light in the room is my bedside lamp over here. Just a second...<br>
<br>
The small lamp flickering on punctuates her sentence―<br>
Woah...?!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Kent：</span><br>
Wow! C-Commander, why the scream? !<br>
<br>
The glow of the lamp reveals course fur, huge fangs, and a pair of deadly sharp pupils.<br>
No matter which way you look at it, that’s a tiger!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Kent：</span><br>
Wait! Stay calm! Kent’s here!<br>
Huh? A wild animal...? Oh! You don’t mean this guy? !<br>
<br>
Kent finally puts it together and peeks out from behind her terrifying “tiger” to explain.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Kent：</span><br>
...It’s a stuffed animal I used to sleep with.<br>
I guess it’s pretty realistic. With the lights out and all, I could see how he’d give you a fright... Haha...<br>
<br>
The room’s gloomy environs only make the “tiger” that much more lifelike...<br>
My work’s still not done, and I’m already exhausted...<br>

Chapter 7 - Together Forever!<br>
Kent has been my secretary ship for quite some time now.<br>
We have a much deeper understanding of each other than we did on that first day.<br>
So I know when I tell her this, she’ll definitely say—<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Kent：</span><br>
—Wonderful! I can hardly contain myself! Oh... sorry, Commander! I have to go see!<br>
<br>
She’s still reckless as she ever was. She’s already rushing off “somewhere”.<br>
Well, I might as well go with.<br>
Kent catches sight of me, having been there a while already. She waves her arms excitedly with a big smile on her face.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Kent：</span><br>
HEY! Commander! Is this the new office?<br>
<br>
It is. We’re moving my office to a new building.<br>
The general layout hasn’t changed, but the new office has a dedicated seat for Kent, as well as a kitchen and sewing equipment.<br>
Also... her little tiger friend.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Kent：</span><br>
Now this is a place I could spend all day! What do you think, Commander?<br>
Will you want to stay with me?<br>
<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项1：I want to stay by your infinitely energetic side.</span>'''''<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项2：I'd love to.</span>'''''<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Kent：</span><br>
Heh heh... When you come out and say it like that, how could I refuse?<br>
<br>
I share a good laugh with Kent... I think it’s going to be another busy, joyous day.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Kent：</span><br>
You’re with Kent forever now, Commander!<br>
