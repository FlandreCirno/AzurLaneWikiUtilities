The Guide to Sardegnian Glory<br>
<br>
1 Project Glorify the Office<br>
Port - Office<br>
The afternoon sunlight pours through the window, coloring the stack of files on my desk a soft gold.<br>
As I blankly stare at the pile of papers, there's a modest knock on the door.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Come in.<br>
<br>
The door opens, and inside steps Vittorio Veneto with her usual graceful demeanor, carrying a tea set.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Vittorio Veneto：</span><br>
Good afternoon, Commander. I hope I'm not disturbing you with this sudden visit.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Ah, Veneto. What brings you here?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Vittorio Veneto：</span><br>
Nothing in particular. I simply thought it would be a shame to not spend this tranquil afternoon with a like-minded individual.<br>
<br>
She places a fragrant cup of tea in front of me.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Vittorio Veneto：</span><br>
I've brought Sardegnian herbal tea and some of my finest treats. Hopefully they are to your taste.<br>
<br>
Not one to turn down her gracious offer, I put down my pen and decide to savor some afternoon tea with her.<br>
The flavors of mellow tea and gently sweet desserts fill my mouth, almost instantly soothing my nerves. They strangely clear my head, too.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Vittorio Veneto：</span><br>
Heehee. Your expression tells me that you appreciate the importance of taking a break.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
It might have something to do with the unique aura you have. It's like you make everything around you more graceful, more relaxing.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Vittorio Veneto：</span><br>
You're too kind. That said, what you feel is likely a reflection of Sardegna's philosophy, rather than any special trait of mine.<br>
In other words, our Empire's glory lies not only in the wake of its battleships, but also in its leisurely approach to everyday life.<br>
There are more ways to exemplify our glory than just cannon fire. It can be shown through the pursuit and enjoyment of art, life, and beauty as well.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
When you put it like that, it makes me want to experience what "Sardegnian glory" is like firsthand.<br>
<br>
A twinkle gleams in her eyes, like some sort of switch inside her flipped.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Vittorio Veneto：</span><br>
Is that so? Do you truly mean that?<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Uh... Well, yeah.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Vittorio Veneto：</span><br>
That being the case, allow me to show it to you.<br>
<br>
It's the next day – a day off – and Veneto comes to me with a beautifully bound book.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
What's with the book?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Vittorio Veneto：</span><br>
It's an itinerary I made for you. An itinerary for experiencing Sardegnian glory.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
An itinerary, huh? Let's see... Morning, a tour around the Sardegnian garden, with a break to enjoy handmade desserts. Noon, a stroll along the beach promenade. Afternoon...<br>
Veneto, don't you reckon this schedule's just a little packed?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Vittorio Veneto：</span><br>
You needn't worry about that. This is the most basic itinerary I assembled after several adjustments and revisions.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
This is "basic" in your eyes?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Vittorio Veneto：</span><br>
Why, yes. It would be quite meaningless to only experience Sardegnian glory at a superficial level, after all!<br>
If you're ready, shall we start at once?<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Like... Right now?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Vittorio Veneto：</span><br>
Strike while the iron is hot, as they say. The desserts are waiting for you, Commander.<br>

<br>
2 A Lovely Time in the Garden<br>
Port - Garden<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Nice place you've got... It has a very different vibe to the rest of the port's gardens.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Vittorio Veneto：</span><br>
I'm honored to hear that. This garden isn't just a slice of wild nature, but rather a product of intent and aesthetics.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Interesting. Are you saying Sardegnian glory comes from order and control?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Vittorio Veneto：</span><br>
That is true in part, but not entirely. This way, if you would.<br>
<br>
Veneto guides me to a patch of flowers whose colors create a beautiful gradient.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Vittorio Veneto：</span><br>
It'd be dull if everything were strictly controlled. This gradient, from subdued to vibrant, is akin to how we naturally express ourselves – it presents a layer of passion.<br>
True glory lies in the balance between reason and emotion, you see.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Huh. Now I feel like I'm looking at more than just a garden...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Vittorio Veneto：</span><br>
Heehee. Enjoying your surroundings while contemplating philosophy – doesn't it feel classy? If you would, lean in close and relish the fragrance of Sardegnian glory.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
This one has a lot of depth... It doesn't smell sweet like any regular rose.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Vittorio Veneto：</span><br>
Indeed. It carries not just Sardegna's beauty, but also the weight and cost of its glory.<br>
<br>
As she says that, she leads me to the marble gazebo at the heart of the garden.<br>
Plates of sweets are lined up inside. The backdrop of the garden only makes them look even more delectable.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Vittorio Veneto：</span><br>
Now, let's indulge our taste buds. Would you mind sharing your initial impressions?<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Hmm... Fragrant, with notes of wheat. It smells really tasty.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Vittorio Veneto：</span><br>
I knew you'd pick up on those. Having the discernment to detect subtle flavors is seen as a valuable talent in the Empire.<br>
Next, let's enjoy this biscotti along with some tea and–<br>
Ah! Please wait! It seems I've made a mistake!<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Hm?<br>
<br>
The next moment, the intense smell of wasabi assaults my nostrils.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
*cough*! *cough*!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Vittorio Veneto：</span><br>
Commander! My apologies!<br>
<br>
I look at her face as she hastily extends a cup of water to me. Her cheeks are flushed red with embarrassment.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Vittorio Veneto：</span><br>
How careless of me not to have checked... I've never been so embarrassed before.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
I'm... fine...<br>
Guess when Sardegnian glory has an accident, things really go south...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Vittorio Veneto：</span><br>
You must forgive me. Please, have some cannoli and zabaione to cleanse your palate. They will smooth over the intense taste.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Hmm... The shell is crunchy, and the cream inside is refreshing and not too sweet.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Vittorio Veneto：</span><br>
It's delightful to hear you like it. I like to say that a bit of sweetness is essential for keeping morale up.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Sounds like you're saying that to have Sardegnian glory, you've got to have desserts.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Vittorio Veneto：</span><br>
That's exactly it. Well, shall we continue with the itinerary? The salty breeze of the sea is calling for us.<br>
Besides, a good walk helps settle the stomach, allowing us to savor the aftertaste of the desserts even longer.<br>

<br>
3 The Resonance of Art<br>
Port - Art Museum<br>
We stand before a large oil painting depicting an ancient naval battle. Veneto's eyes glitter quietly.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Vittorio Veneto：</span><br>
Commander, if I may take your eyes off of the grand sea for a minute, please have a look at the ship.<br>
Battered though it may be, isn't it like a silent yet epic poem?<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
An epic poem?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Vittorio Veneto：</span><br>
Yes. It speaks of storms, ropes, the flow of time, and loyalty.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
True. I get a sense of unwavering strength coming from it.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Vittorio Veneto：</span><br>
Heehee. You're getting quite into the mood of things.<br>
Please have a look at this painting next. Can you tell what the painter wanted to express?<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Quiet... and peace. It's calming to look at.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Vittorio Veneto：</span><br>
Yes! This is what "silent glory" is all about.<br>
Sardegnian art is not just about quiet duty and roaring strength. We also pride ourselves on the profound grace that breathes through tranquility.<br>
<br>
Veneto goes on to explain everything from techniques of light and shadow, to color psychology, to the historical background and even the life of the painter.<br>
Despite my best efforts, it's all too much to take in. My gaze drifts from the intricate brushstrokes on the paintings to Veneto's face, and especially her eyes, brimming with passion.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Vittorio Veneto：</span><br>
...In other words, this seemingly unsophisticated "gold color" actually utilizes a quite old technique...<br>
<br>
Her words come to a sudden stop. The next thing I know, she's looking at me quietly.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Vittorio Veneto：</span><br>
Commander, was my explanation... a little long-winded?<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
It's not that, I just... couldn't keep up with how enthusiastic you were.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Vittorio Veneto：</span><br>
My apologies. I got a bit carried away. I'd forgotten how spontaneous this trip was, and that you'd been working until yesterday.<br>
<br>
She vaguely frowns and looks at my face.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Vittorio Veneto：</span><br>
You must be exhausted. Admiring all these paintings must've been a tiring affair for you.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Yeah, maybe. I think I've hit my learning cap for today. First the garden, now the museum... My brain's been firing on all cylinders this whole time.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Vittorio Veneto：</span><br>
I understand. It appears I tried to cram too much knowledge about glory into your head.<br>
That being the case, what your overworked brain needs now is rest.<br>
I propose that we head somewhere where you can relax.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
But then your itinerary will go to waste.<br>
<br>
With a smile, she shakes her head.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Vittorio Veneto：</span><br>
You needn't concern yourself with that. One way to express Sardegnian glory is to adapt to the wishes of your guests.<br>
We have a certain way of relieving fatigue in Sardegna that you may find surprising.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
You mentioned a place we can relax... What is it?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Vittorio Veneto：</span><br>
Follow me and you will see. It will soothe both your body and spirit♪<br>

<br>
4 Bathing Prep<br>
Port - Thermae<br>
The moment the door opens, I'm hit by a burst of steam carrying aromatic fragrances and the faint scent of minerals.<br>
Vapor rises from pools of all sizes, drifting and fluttering as though to tempt me to soak.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Is this what you meant by a Sardegnian place to relax? It's like something lifted straight out of a Sardegnian bathhouse.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Vittorio Veneto：</span><br>
Heehee. Your praise is much appreciated. It shows that our hard work has paid off.<br>
As I was going to say... The act of bathing is a way to clean ourselves, but that's not all it is.<br>
<br>
Veneto takes a few steps forward, and brushes aside some of the humid air with her arm.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Vittorio Veneto：</span><br>
It is a ritual, and a philosophy that allows both body and spirit to be purified, relaxed, and reborn, all at the same time.<br>
Now, before we go in...<br>
I'd like to assist you in getting changed.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Hold on! I can do that myself perfectly fine.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Vittorio Veneto：</span><br>
Heehee. There's no need to be shy. This is an essential element of the experience.<br>
Might I add, having a staff member assist with your pre-bath preparations is a vital part of our hospitality. It serves to honor your noble status and ensures you have the most enjoyable bath.<br>
You are a distinguished guest who I invited, so therefore...<br>
<br>
She takes another step toward me. A gentle yet unwavering will flickers in her eyes, and she gives me a smile that won't take no for an answer.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Vittorio Veneto：</span><br>
May I ask you to momentarily treat me not as the flagship of the Sardegnian fleet, but rather as your personal guide to our glory?<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Well... Alright.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Vittorio Veneto：</span><br>
Thank you.<br>
<br>
She undoes the button on my collar. Her cool fingers graze the back of my neck, tickling me ever so slightly.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Vittorio Veneto：</span><br>
That's it – just relax. You'll get used to it and grow to like this process soon enough.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Okay...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Vittorio Veneto：</span><br>
Allow me to handle everything for you. Trust is the basis for all types of enjoyment.<br>
<br>
After taking off my coat and carefully hanging it on a nearby rack, she places her hand on my shirt.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Vittorio Veneto：</span><br>
Commander, you're tensing up. You won't be able to fully relax in the bath if you stay this stiff.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
I'm trying to relax. I really am.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Vittorio Veneto：</span><br>
Heehee. My, your back is more muscular than it looks.<br>
It's clear that you've not neglected your exercise. That's excellent.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Yeah, well, my job makes me run all over the place.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Vittorio Veneto：</span><br>
That's wonderful. Your willingness to spare no effort and get out there yourself is proof of your capability as a leader.<br>
<br>
As our exchange continues, she strips me of one garment after the next.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Vittorio Veneto：</span><br>
There. Just one more to go and–<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Ahem! Thanks, but I'll do that myself.<br>

<br>
5 Permeating Warmth<br>
Thermae - Pool<br>
I return to the public bath from the dressing room. Veneto, soaking in the pool, notices me, and extends a hand to me.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Vittorio Veneto：</span><br>
Please join me, Commander.<br>
<br>
She gives me a gracious smile. The steam obscures the solemn demeanor that she as the Sardegnian flagship usually exhibits.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Vittorio Veneto：</span><br>
The water is warm. It'll clean your body and relieve your fatigue.<br>
<br>
Taking her extended hand, I slowly descend the steps into the water.<br>
In just moments, its warmth envelops my entire body.<br>
My stiff muscles relax, and all the pent-up fatigue escapes through my pores and vanishes into the hot currents.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Ooohhh...<br>
<br>
Veneto sees the look on my face, and her lips form a contented smile.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Vittorio Veneto：</span><br>
It seems the water was just the right temperature for you. If you would, please lean on the pool's rim.<br>
That's it. Submerge yourself deeply. Let the water embrace you, and feel the comfort it brings to your heart.<br>
<br>
The rim is smooth, warm, and comfortable. Both of us lean against it, soaking in the water up to our chests.<br>
Calm ripples spread across the water's surface while the current beneath gently caresses my body. It dawns on me that it's completely silent, save for the sound of the water and our breathing.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
I'm guessing you're pretty fond of this place.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Vittorio Veneto：</span><br>
That I am. It's one of the most private, relaxing locations around the port.<br>
It lets you forget your troubles, leave your duties behind, and become one with the warm water.<br>
Ahh... There's no better thing for soothing the soul, is there?<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Yeah, sure feels like it.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Vittorio Veneto：</span><br>
Incidentally, Commander, would you like to experience the ultimate enjoyment of Sardegnian thermae?<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
There's something even better than this?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Vittorio Veneto：</span><br>
Of course. Have a look.<br>
<br>
She points toward a small bathtub and a small booth with wooden walls.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Vittorio Veneto：</span><br>
That is a cold bath. I adore using it after a long soak in a hot pool. The water is nice and cool, and it's sure to rouse you.<br>
And that next to it is a sauna. We Sardegnians often use it for its skincare benefits.<br>
Also, have you noticed the aroma in the air around here?<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Oh yeah, now that you mention it, it smells like fruit and flowers.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Vittorio Veneto：</span><br>
Well, on the other side of that wall, there's a private room where you can get a wonderful aromatherapeutic massage. It's actually what I think is the most relaxing place here.<br>
Should you follow our ancient bathing rituals, you might be able to–<br>
<br>
Her words stop for just a moment as she looks at me. A hint of remorse seeps into her voice.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Vittorio Veneto：</span><br>
You must forgive me, Commander. Here I am, getting ahead of myself and placing unnecessary burdens on you...<br>
Allow me to compensate you by making a course adjustment to today's itinerary.<br>
<br>
Her cheeks begin to take on a soft red hue, possibly due to the steam.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Vittorio Veneto：</span><br>
Let's forget about this "experience Sardegnian glory" business. Instead, we'll do as your body and spirit dictate.<br>
I'll employ a more direct, more soothing method to let you feel authentic Sardegnian relaxation.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
We're doing something different?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Vittorio Veneto：</span><br>
Yes. There'll be no more itinerary or plan, and no need to work your brain. This other method is focused just on physical touch.<br>
I hope that you'll enjoy it, Commander♪<br>

<br>
6 Fingertip Rhythm<br>
Thermae - Massage Room<br>
After a long, warm soak in the pool, Veneto brings me to a private massage room.<br>
The ambiance is dim and soft. Only an aroma lamp off to the side and some warmly colored lights serve to illuminate the room.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Vittorio Veneto：</span><br>
Please lie face down on this rock bed, Commander. It has a temperature control system underneath that'll keep it at a relaxing warmth.<br>
<br>
Doing as she asks, I lie down on the thick, white towel that covers the bed. The fluffy towel envelops my face, and just the right amount of warmth seeps through the rock bed.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Vittorio Veneto：</span><br>
Now, allow me to demonstrate what a traditional aroma massage from Sardegna is like.<br>
This massage will help relax your muscles, while the aroma and the rhythmical movement of my hands will relieve your spirit.<br>
<br>
I adjust my posture, after which she takes off my bathrobe and goes to fetch a few glass bottles.<br>
The bottles each contain differently colored liquids that shine with a pretty luster under the light.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Vittorio Veneto：</span><br>
You may pick whichever fragrance you like.<br>
This is calming lavender, which improves your sleep quality, and this is citrus, which lightens your mood and helps you relax. They're both perfect for clearing your mind and restoring your energy.<br>
<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项1：Citrus.</span>'''''<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项2：Lavender.</span>'''''<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Vittorio Veneto：</span><br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项1）</span>'''''Ah, so you choose the energizing citrus blend.<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项1）</span>'''''You must have more vigor left in you than I thought. Or perhaps you're asking me to accompany you a little longer?<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项1）</span>'''''Heehee – well, as you wish. I hope this refreshing scent of citrus will rid you of your last traces of gloom, like Sardegna's sunlight.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Vittorio Veneto：</span><br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项2）</span>'''''A wise choice. It's perfect for someone who truly wants to rest.<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项2）</span>'''''Its mild, floral aroma will embrace you like a mother's lullaby at night.<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项2）</span>'''''Close your eyes, please. Let the sleepiness gently come over you.<br>
<br>
After I've chosen a fragrance, she doesn't immediately start the aromatherapy. Rather, she leans over and brings her face next to my ear.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Vittorio Veneto：</span><br>
This is the most crucial step. Sardegnian massagists have a custom of removing any clothes that might interfere with their meticulous work...<br>
Therefore, I must ask you to not turn around for any reason during this. Do you understand?<br>
<br>
She speaks with a tone that allows no objections.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
O-okay.<br>
<br>
There's the sound of her bathrobe coming off, along with the faint trickle of running water. I close my eyes.<br>
Slowly, the aroma fills the room's air, and I instinctively draw a deep breath.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Vittorio Veneto：</span><br>
Please relax. Allow me to handle your body, breathing, and everything else.<br>
If you start to feel ill, or if you'd like me to go harder or softer, then don't be afraid to let me know.<br>
<br>
Her warm hands coated with aromatic oil touch my back, which sends a shudder up through my spine.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Vittorio Veneto：</span><br>
Please, take it easy, Commander. Try to match your breathing to my rhythm.<br>
Let the tension in your body go...<br>
<br>
With slow but firm motions, she starts massaging my back, her fingers gliding over my skin and working the oil in.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Vittorio Veneto：</span><br>
So stiff... It's proof of just how long you've sat at your desk.<br>
You really should take better care of yourself, Commander. For your own sake and mine.<br>
<br>
Pushing, kneading, pressing, and spreading, her strength penetrates deeply into my body as her skillful massage continues.<br>
After a dash of dull pain, a refreshing sensation like nothing I've felt before fills me all at once.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
This is amazing...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Vittorio Veneto：</span><br>
Heehee. What you're about to feel will be even better.<br>
<br>
She slowly runs her fingertips down both sides of my spine.<br>

Don't be alarmed. It will start feeling good before you know it.<br>
To tell you the truth, Commander... I'm overjoyed that I get to touch and take care of you like this.<br>
Please remember it, because this is a service I wouldn't offer to anyone else...<br>
<br>
The sheer comfort makes my mind turn hazy and renders my body unable to move.<br>
All I can do is feel the rhythm of her fingers, moving back and forth like waves onto the shores of my body, washing away all my fatigue, stress, and tension.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Vittorio Veneto：</span><br>
So, please, enjoy it to its fullest...<br>

Thermae - Large Pool<br>
That massage completely reinvigorated me. Afterward, Veneto and I went back for another soak in the warm pool.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Ahh... Feels like a huge weight has come off my shoulders.<br>
<br>
The unrivaled sense of relaxation makes me unconsciously close my eyes and melt into the steaming water.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Vittorio Veneto：</span><br>
Commander...<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Yeah?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Vittorio Veneto：</span><br>
Heehee – you look like you're having the time of your life.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Sure am. It's been ages since I experienced something this soothing.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Vittorio Veneto：</span><br>
Seeing you this relaxed brings me a lot of joy.<br>
I've given it some thought... and I realized that I was too focused on showing you things today. I planned all those activities, yet I neglected to think about your enjoyment.<br>
Looking at you now, it's finally dawned on me that when it comes to glory, making you happy is far more important than just showing you things.<br>

She lowers her head slightly, and waterdrops silently fall from her hair. Then she sinks until the water reaches her shoulders, letting only her faintly red face poke above the surface.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
I think I get it too, now. Maybe all this time, Sardegnian glory wasn't something you show to people...<br>
Maybe instead it's confidence, and the desire to give those you care about a place of solace.<br>
Take this thermae that washed away all my weariness as an example. Its warmth and the comfort it brings are Sardegnian glory in its most beautiful form.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Vittorio Veneto：</span><br>
Do you mean to say that... the thermae itself is what Sardegnian glory is?<br>
<br>
She looks stunned for a moment, but then, her lips form a warm, genuine smile.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Vittorio Veneto：</span><br>
Heehee. Although things didn't go exactly according to plan, and there was a little mistake along the way...<br>
With the benefit of hindsight, perhaps this is the most ideal conclusion I could've asked for.<br>
<br>
As she says that, she comes over to me.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Vittorio Veneto：</span><br>
Well, now that you've gotten a small taste of Sardegnian glory in everyday life, its "strength and spirit," so to speak...<br>
Perhaps you'd be interested in the more advanced course I've prepared for you?<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
More advanced?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Vittorio Veneto：</span><br>
Yes. I assure you that it'll be a wonderful and unforgettable experience.<br>
<br>
She gives me a smile that hints at some mischievous intentions as she makes a promise between just us.<br>
