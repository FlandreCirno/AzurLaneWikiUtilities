Consultation Corner's Day Off<br>
<br>
1 Constructing the Consultation Office<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Bremerton：</span><br>
In summary!<br>
For the sake of everyone's mental health, and to help solve their problems...<br>
I'd like to use your office to open a new consultation corner... no, consultation OFFICE!<br>
That is all!<br>
<br>
After rushing into my office, Bremerton rattled off her proposal without letting me get a word in edgewise. Then, she hands me a document.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Bremerton：</span><br>
I WAS just going to hand in my application.<br>
But I couldn't help myself. I just had to tell you all about it!<br>
All the details are in the application, though, so give it a good read!<br>
Whoops. Let me reply to a post real quick...<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Sure. Go for it.<br>
<br>
I accept the consultation office request and read over it.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
I don't have any problems with the plan, but... it says I need to give my opinion after the consultation?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Bremerton：</span><br>
Yep! This is my first consultation off of Juustagram, so I might overlook some things.<br>
What better way to improve it than to have your opinion?<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Is this mainly a process review question, then?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Bremerton：</span><br>
Yep yep! But I also want your supervision and feedback on whether I can improve my problem-solving process.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Are you sure? That would mean breaking the confidentiality between you and your clients.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Bremerton：</span><br>
No worries there!<br>
I'll narrow down the consultations that I want your attention on. Plus, I'll get my clients' permission.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Okay...<br>
<br>
With my issues addressed, I approve her application.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Bremerton：</span><br>
Hooray! I'll prepare the consultation office right away!<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
One more thing... Are you sure you can handle it alone?<br>
If there's anything I can do to help, let me know.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Bremerton：</span><br>
Okay! Thanks, Commander! I'll come running as soon as I need anything!<br>
<br>
The following few days went by quickly.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Bremerton：</span><br>
Sorry, Commander! Can I get some help with the door?<br>
<br>
After the day's office work is over, I hear Bremerton's voice outside of my office.<br>
When I open the door for her, she rushes in, carrying a bunch of bags big and small.<br>
Judging from all the stuff she's carrying, it must be related to her consultation setup.<br>
After some time and effort, we've put all of her things where they need to go.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Bremerton：</span><br>
Thanks, Commander! I wanted to bring all the stuff for my consultation office and set it up...<br>
Oh! Got another message. Let's see...<br>
<br>
Bremerton whips out her phone and types up a reply.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Bremerton：</span><br>
Send... And, done!<br>
Anyway, it's time to set up my office! You go home and get some rest, okay, Commander?<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
It's still early. Let me help you.<br>
Two sets of hands work faster than one.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Bremerton：</span><br>
You mean it? I think I'll take you up on that~ Thanks, Commander!<br>
Now, where do we begin...<br>
Can you get the sign from the bag in that corner and put it here for me?<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Like this?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Bremerton：</span><br>
Yeah! Good stuff! Next, let's hang this ribbon here...<br>
<br>
Two days of preparation later, and the consultation office is ready for business. Opening day is tomorrow.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Bremerton：</span><br>
Hmm. Something's missing...<br>
<br>
Bremerton seems bothered as she stands in front of her new office.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
What about putting out snacks?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Bremerton：</span><br>
That's it! They'll serve as a good decoration AND help people relax a little!<br>
Thanks, Commander! I'll go buy some right now!<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
I happen to be free right now. Why don't I go with you?<br>
<br>
After some shopping out in the port...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Bremerton：</span><br>
Umm... That's probably enough snacks and drinks for now.<br>
I was thinking, what if we stop by a bookstore next?<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Why a bookstore?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Bremerton：</span><br>
I mean, they're open, and it'd be nice to work on my psychology and consulting knowledge before I open shop.<br>
It's my first time, after all. Even I get a little nervous!<br>
<br>
She stops and smiles a little bashfully.<br>
Her usual energy comes back in no time, but...<br>
In that short moment, I saw the subtle bags under her eyes – proof of how much work she's put into her consultation effort.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Bremerton：</span><br>
I've made my decision! To the bookstore we go!<br>
<br>
Thus, I follow her for a while...<br>
Until her eyes are drawn to a certain storefront along the way.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
(Is that... a home goods store? A bedding set and fluffy pajama sale, huh...)<br>
Ahem. You've been working hard on this consultation business, right?<br>
Once it's over, I'm sure you'll need a good night's sleep...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Bremerton：</span><br>
Ahahaha~ I appreciate your concern, really, but I'm always full of energy. I'm not tired in the slightest!<br>
Anyway, let's hurry to that bookstore! We gotta get back soon so we can decorate more!<br>

<br>
Consultation Corner's Day Off<br>
<br>
2 Open for Business!<br>
It's finally opening day for the consultation office.<br>
I head out, surrendering my office to Bremerton and her clients.<br>
In the evening, she calls me and lets me know that I can come back.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Bremerton：</span><br>
Welcome back, Commander! The consultation office was a huge success!<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
That's great!<br>
<br>
I look around. Every part of her setup is gone, as if it was never there.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Bremerton：</span><br>
I cleaned everything up before I called. Heheh.<br>
Good timing, though! I was just narrowing down the list of resolutions I wanted your opinions on.<br>
<br>
She shows off a bundle of papers and waves it at me.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Good work. In that case, should we do the review together as well?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Bremerton：</span><br>
Uh, about that... I was kind of thinking I should do it on my own first and put together my own thoughts.<br>
I'll have you help me after I do that.<br>
Now, first things first... How do you think I can improve my problem-solving process? All opinions welcome!<br>
<br>
She hands over the documents, and I open them.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Hmm...<br>
<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项1：(Pick one from the top at random.)</span>'''''<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项2：(Grab one from the middle.)</span>'''''<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项3：(Pull one off the bottom.)</span>'''''<br>
<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项1）</span>'''''I take a random sheet from the top of the bundle. Client: Bristol.<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项1）</span>'''''Consultation: She's been exhausted lately. She considers herself too busy, so she's looking for help finding a solution to that.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项1）</span>'''''(Too busy? What, too busy investigating mysteries?)<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Bremerton：</span><br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项1）</span>'''''I suggested she clean her room and replace her couch and bed with softer ones.<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项1）</span>'''''Then, she should read novels from various genres and broaden her horizons as an investigator.<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项1）</span>'''''Basically, I told her to stay in her room and rest.<br>
<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项2）</span>'''''I choose one from the middle this time. Client: Louisville.<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项2）</span>'''''Consultation: She wants help being less forgetful.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Bremerton：</span><br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项2）</span>'''''I recommended she take notes and force herself to memorize the things she cares the most about.<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项2）</span>'''''For example, things related to you.<br>
<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项3）</span>'''''I pull from the bottom of the pile. Client: Chi An.<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项3）</span>'''''Consultation: She needs a way to get really good at cooking as fast as possible.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Bremerton：</span><br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项3）</span>'''''She needs a skilled friend to teach her, of course. For example, Lung Wu or Vestal...<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项3）</span>'''''Of course, I did warn her not to feed you her practice dishes, Commander!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Bremerton：</span><br>
That should do. Next...<br>
<br>
I've checked Bremerton's consultations to her satisfaction.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
This is all good advice. I honestly don't see anywhere I can contribute.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Bremerton：</span><br>
Really?!<br>
<br>
Her previously worried eyes open wide with joy.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Bremerton：</span><br>
So my consultation office can help people, after all!<br>
Ahaha~ But it only went so well thanks to your help, Commander!<br>
Here, I'll put everything back where it was. Your office will be all yours again!<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
I'll help!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Bremerton：</span><br>
Hehe, thanks, Commander! You're too sweet♪<br>
<br>
The two of us hauled all the documents and decorations to Bremerton's room.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Bremerton：</span><br>
You can put it right there! Thanks, Commander! Want a drink before you go?<br>
...Oh! Sorry, got another message... Let's see.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
(She sure keeps an eye on those messages. I doubt she'll sleep well like that.)<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Bremerton：</span><br>
Aaand, sent! Okay, all done!<br>
So, where was I...? Oh! Do you want a drink, Commander?<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
I'm fine, thanks. You've had a long day today – you should really take a break.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Bremerton：</span><br>
Hm? Are you that worried about me? I'm fine! See, I'm still full of energy!<br>
But if you say so...<br>
Heheh, go on a date with me next time you're off!<br>
You wanted me to take a break, riiight? Then it's a deal. See you then!<br>

Consultation Corner's Day Off<br>
<br>
3 The Big Day Off<br>
The next day...<br>
As soon as I enter my office, Bremerton gives a hearty welcome.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Bremerton：</span><br>
Heheh. Bremerton here, ready to be your new secretary ship!<br>
Leave any and every job to me, Commander!<br>
<br>
With her full support, today's work comes to a quick and smooth end.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Bremerton：</span><br>
Hey, do you want a nice cup of milk tea to finish off the work day? No ice, and half syrup♪<br>
<br>
I accept the tea and savor a sip.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
(Hmm... Bremerton's acting a little weird today.)<br>
Hm? Come to think of it, where's your phone?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Bremerton：</span><br>
Oh, yeah. I forgot I left it in "do not disturb" mode! Thanks, Commander!<br>
Heheheh♪ Let's see what help everyone needs today!<br>
<br>
When I leave the office, I run into Baltimore in the hall.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Baltimore：</span><br>
Oh, Commander! Sorry to bother you outside of work hours... I wanted to discuss the athletic field remodel with you. Do you have a minute?<br>
<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项1：Sure, I don't mind.</span>'''''<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项2：That's fine! I LOVE work!</span>'''''<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项3：Oh, fine. Let's go take a look.</span>'''''<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Baltimore：</span><br>
...Tomorrow, I'll examine the equipment that needs maintenance and updating, and collect them in a list.<br>
The most urgent upgrade is the tennis court's pitching machine. Yesterday, it misfired and did a number on poor Bremerton's head...<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Did a number on her?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Baltimore：</span><br>
Yeah. To be fair, she was hardly mentally there to begin with.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
(Leaving her phone on "do not disturb," spacing out on the tennis court...)<br>
(She must still be fatigued from her consultation office.)<br>
<br>
I decide to tell her about Bremerton's recent efforts and her odd state.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Baltimore：</span><br>
Really... We should find a way to make sure she rests properly.<br>
Not that she would listen if we just told her to, of course.<br>
If it's really necessary... Commander, you could sock her good enough to knock her out.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
I would really rather not.<br>
(She did like those new pajamas back at that one shop.)<br>
Hmm...<br>
<br>
After I tell Baltimore my thoughts, the two of us begin devising a strategy.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Baltimore：</span><br>
Okay! Leave it to me, Commander!<br>

<br>
Consultation Corner's Day Off<br>
<br>
4 A Special Session<br>
Soon, the day of the operation comes.<br>
*knock* *knock*<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Bremerton：</span><br>
Come iiin!<br>
Huh?<br>
Commander and Baltimore? Welcome... Uh, why'd the two of you bring so much stuff?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Baltimore：</span><br>
Did you forget my promise to spend the day with you in your room today?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Bremerton：</span><br>
Oh, yeah! Ahahaha, here I thought it was just going to be a regular pajama party!<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Don't worry. That's still what it is.<br>
But I discussed things with Baltimore, and we thought redecoration might help liven up the mood a bit more.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Bremerton：</span><br>
Huh, really? Okay, where should we start?<br>
<br>
Just then, Bremerton's phone plays an alert tone.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
You just got a consulting request, right? Leave the decorating to me and Baltimore.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Baltimore：</span><br>
Yeah. Take care of your consultations, okay? Then, you can come back and focus on enjoying the party.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Bremerton：</span><br>
Hehe~ Okay! I'm counting on the two of you!<br>
<br>
After we finish redecorating her room...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Bremerton：</span><br>
Whoa! You two work fast. I barely even finished replying!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Baltimore：</span><br>
Then that's perfect. Let's get this pajama party started!<br>
<br>
Just then, Baltimore's phone gets a call this time.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Baltimore：</span><br>
Hello? Hmm... Really? Right now? But I'm...<br>
Does it really need me there? ...Okay. I'm on my way!<br>
Hey, guys? It sounds like they really need me to go right now.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Bremerton：</span><br>
Huh? Does someone need help? It seems awfully sudden.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Oh! I just remembered I have work left over, too!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Baltimore：</span><br>
The Commander is busy, too? That's a shame.<br>
Well, there's no point in trying to continue the pajama party.<br>
Yeah. Sorry, Bremerton. You should just get some rest on your own!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Bremerton：</span><br>
Huh? You're really going? Even after you redecorated, and everything?<br>
You must be hiding something! I'm really perceptive when it comes to this stuff, so out with it!<br>
<br>
Bremerton interrogates us. We're forced to spill the beans on our plan.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Bremerton：</span><br>
Heheh... Ahahaha!<br>
You did all that just so I'd rest and go back to normal?<br>
Okay! Okay, I get it! Geez, you're so indirect~ I'll rest up good, so stop worrying so much!<br>
Now that the secret's out, can we go back to our pajama party, though?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Baltimore：</span><br>
Ahem... Um, I actually did make plans, since we expected to leave you alone by now...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Bremerton：</span><br>
Awww! Commander, what about you?<br>
<br>
Her expectant eyes turn to me.<br>
<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项1：(Agree.)</span>'''''<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项2：(Hesitate.)</span>'''''<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项1）</span>'''''Sure. I don't have any work to do, so I'll stay.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项2）</span>'''''(I mean, this is Bremerton's bedroom, right? I should really say no...)<br>
<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项2）</span>'''''Sensing what I'm thinking, Bremerton clasps her hands together as if begging.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Bremerton：</span><br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项2）</span>'''''Please, Commander? You remember that date promise, don't you?<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项2）</span>'''''Let's have a stay-at-home date~<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项2）</span>'''''A stay-at-home date... But, umm...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Bremerton：</span><br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项2）</span>'''''Don't sweat the small stuff! Come on, Commander, stay with me!<br>

Consultation Corner's Day Off<br>
<br>
5 Tell Me Your Troubles!<br>
After Baltimore left, Bremerton excused herself for a moment to change into the new pajamas I gave her.<br>
While I wait for her, I happen to notice the consulting office sign on the floor.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Hmm... Sure, why not?<br>
<br>
I pick up the sign.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Bremerton：</span><br>
Tadaaa! Sorry for the wait! But doesn't it look good on me?<br>
Wait, Commander? Why'd you put up that sign?<br>
<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项1：Bremerton, let's do a consultation right now!</span>'''''<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项2：The consultation office is open for business for a limited time!</span>'''''<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Now, tell me your troubles... I mean, it doesn't even have to be troubles.<br>
Anything you want to ask, or anything you want to talk about, let me hear it.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Bremerton：</span><br>
Ooh! You really sound like a counselor, Commander!<br>
Okay, I'll play along~<br>
Umm... Where do I begin?<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Let's start with your consultation office. Setting it up took a lot of hard work, right?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Bremerton：</span><br>
Not really? It was easy stuff for me!<br>
But if I had to say, I guess it was pretty stressful...<br>
Like... Would I be able to solve people's problems? Would my advice really help them?<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
You did a good job there. Your consultation office was a success, wasn't it?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Bremerton：</span><br>
Yeah! I think everything turned out great!<br>
But... Now that I've relaxed after all that stress, it's gotten a little hard to focus...<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
And now you're forgetting to take your phone off of DnD, and you're letting tennis balls hit you in the head.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Bremerton：</span><br>
Hm? How did you know about the tennis ball thing?<br>
Oh! I know! That's why you schemed to make me rest!<br>
<br>
I confirm her suspicions, and she flashes a bright smile.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Bremerton：</span><br>
Roger that! To live up to you and Baltimore's wishes, I'm gonna rest and relax like never before~<br>
But fiiirst... Let's play a game, Commander!<br>

<br>
6 Off-Day Leisure<br>
I have one card in my hand, and Bremerton has two, one of which is the old maid.<br>
<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项1：(Pick the left card.)</span>'''''<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项2：(Pick the right card.)</span>'''''<br>
<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项1）</span>'''''A normal card. This wins me the game, and Bremerton falls back into her cushion while holding a single Joker.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Bremerton：</span><br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项1）</span>'''''Aww, I lost~ How did you get so good at this, Commander?<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项1）</span>'''''Okay, no more Old Maid! I'm done with that!<br>
<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项2）</span>'''''...I pull the Joker. When I lose, Bremerton gives me a big hug.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Bremerton：</span><br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项2）</span>'''''Yay! I win! I'm celebrating today's first victory with a biiiig hug!<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项2）</span>'''''It's rare for me to win against you. I wanna keep my undefeated record for the day!<br>

Let's change games now!<br>
<br>
After that, we play board games for a while... until she stretches and yawns.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Bremerton：</span><br>
Phew... Playing games can be exhausting~ How about we find something more relaxing to do?<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Such as?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Bremerton：</span><br>
Such as... watching movies, or something!<br>
<br>
In this movie, the characters talk about their troubles, overcome the pain in their hearts, and ultimately accept each other in the end.<br>
Bremerton clings to my arm and rests her head on my shoulder.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Bremerton：</span><br>
Heheh. It all comes down to being open with each other.<br>
When it comes to solving problems or relieving stress, you need to tell people how you feel...<br>
I've been listening to other people's problems all this time, and I'm just now realizing... I guess I've been pretty dense, for once.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
A little. If you have any problems, tell me any time, okay?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Bremerton：</span><br>
Yeah! Okay, it's decided! And... I'm gonna tell you things that aren't problems, either!<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Of course.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Bremerton：</span><br>
Also... Thanks a lot for today, Commander...<br>
You set aside a day off for me, stayed with me the whole time...<br>
Zzzzz...<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Bremerton?<br>
<br>
On this warm night, backed by the gentle sound of movie music, she falls asleep on my shoulder.<br>
That faint smile on her face makes her look very satisfied and relaxed, indeed.<br>

<br>
Consultation Corner's Day Off<br>
<br>
7 Brem's Big Rest<br>
The credits roll onscreen.<br>
But Bremerton still sleeps.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
(I think I'll carry her off to bed and head home.)<br>
<br>
When I gently pick her up, she sleepily opens her eyes.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Bremerton：</span><br>
Yaaawn... Hmm? Commander, did I fall asleep?<br>
Aww, why didn't you wake me up? We finally got some alone time! Ugh, I slept away all our time together...<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
You looked so peaceful. I didn't want to stop that.<br>
Anyway, if you're awake, I'll put you down–<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Bremerton：</span><br>
W-wait, wait!<br>
<br>
She takes her phone out of her pocket, wraps one arm back around my neck, and raises her phone with the other.<br>
Then, she leans toward me. Following her warm breath, her lips touch my cheek.<br>
*snap!* She takes a photo of the kiss.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Bremerton：</span><br>
Heheh♪ Commemorative photo shoot complete, aaand... saved!<br>
<br>
I put her down and take a peek at her phone's screen.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Come to think of it, you didn't look at your phone much today, did you?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Bremerton：</span><br>
Well, of course!<br>
<br>
The screen displays the most recent Juustagram posts. The newest one reads...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Bremerton：</span><br>
The consultation office is closed for today!<br>
I wouldn't want to ruin the mood you so carefully established. You're the most important thing to me in the world, anyway!<br>
<br>
With that, she opens her phone settings.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Bremerton：</span><br>
Yeah, I love how close we are in this pic! I'm putting that as my lock screen!<br>
<br>
The movie ends, the TV enters power-saving mode, and the room gets darker.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
I'll get the lights...<br>
<br>
When I try to stand up, though, she pulls me into a soft, yet tight embrace.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Bremerton：</span><br>
Hehe. Now we're even closer than before♡<br>
You understand me better than anyone... So listen to my heart a little more, okay?♡<br>
