<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Shinano ：</span><br>
Mmh... Ah... How is this?<br>
Is this posture... suitable?<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
While it works perfectly fine, you could change it a little and see if it's even better.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Shinano ：</span><br>
Very well... This one shall do as you ask...<br>
Shinano, donning a pit babe outfit, is leaning atop a race car. She's trying hard to find just the right pose.<br>
Meanwhile, I'm standing just off to the side, camera in hand.<br>
How did I end up in this position? Well...<br>
Aoba wanted pictures for her newspaper and asked Shinano to pose for some photos. She agreed, but Aoba had to tend to some urgent matter, and so I was the only one left who could do the photography.<br>
Perhaps... this pose? What are your thoughts...?<br>
It looks like she's settled on one.<br>
It does differ somewhat from the reference pictures...<br>
That is true...<br>
<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项1：But it looks perfect!</span>'''''<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Shinano ：</span><br>
Whew... Very well, if you're certain...<br>
Admittedly... this is a tad embarrassing...<br>
Nonetheless... I will do anything in my power to show support for the racers...<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Alright. Let's take a few photos and see how they look.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Shinano ：</span><br>
Of course... Take as many as needed...<br>
Shinano is bashful but determined. I offer her a few words of encouragement and psych myself up before starting the shoot.<br>
Thanks to that, I manage to capture some good photos.<br>

2 Finish Line Flagbearer<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Baltimore：</span><br>
...And those are all our contestants!<br>
It'll be exciting to see how this race is going to unfold!<br>
Now... Start!<br>
Baltimore delivers the starting cry and waves her big flag with force. The stands burst into life, with the spectators all waving flags of various colors.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Great job out there. I brought some water. And a towel.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Baltimore：</span><br>
Whew... Thanks a bunch, Commander. My throat was feeling pretty dry.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Well, you did deliver a pretty long opening speech.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Baltimore：</span><br>
Hahahah! It wasn't that big a deal. How'd you like it, by the way?<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
It was wonderful. You did a solid job, hyping up the audience.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Baltimore：</span><br>
Thanks. Just between you and me, I actually rehearsed it for a long time.<br>
Good thing I did, too, 'cause it paid off.<br>
Baltimore leans back a bit as she sits down on a tire to rest.<br>
With style, she then wipes her brow dry with the towel, turns to me, and gives me a smile.<br>
I offered to help, so I wanted to really give it my all and finish with no regrets.<br>
...It feels like you've been afraid to look me in the eyes for a bit now...<br>
Is something weird stuck on my face, or...?<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Oh. Uh...<br>
Err... I mean... No, not really?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Baltimore：</span><br>
So it's not my face. Is it my outfit, then?<br>
I actually had it modified a bit to make it easier to move in.<br>
They were pretty tight, originally. Not the kind of thing you wanna be waving a flag in.<br>
Granted, yeah, it turned out pretty skimpy as a result.<br>
But hey...<br>
Bathed in sunshine, she does a small spin on her heel. Her flag flutters in the wind, and she flashes a vivid smile.<br>
It was the right call. 'Cause this way, I can root and cheer to my heart's content. Couldn't do that if the fit held me back.<br>
<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项1：I'd say it fits you better now than it did before.</span>'''''<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Baltimore：</span><br>
Y-you think so? Heheh...<br>
She looks like a bulb lit inside her head, and she comes closer, shooting me a meaningful gaze.<br>
It did its job of exciting the audience, but the question is... does it excite YOU, Commander?<br>
Maybe once this race is over... we could go and find out? If you wanna...<br>

3 Final Lap<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Prinz Eugen：</span><br>
While the stadium is ablaze with excitement, I come across a girl content to sit quietly in a corner.<br>
...With a champagne bottle behind her back, about to be popped.<br>
Heehee~ Saw right through me, huh?<br>
She is apparently practicing her routine for when Iron Blood wins the race.<br>
Machines are our field of expertise, after all.<br>
We steer them better than anyone. Why wouldn't I have full confidence in my team?<br>
By the way, Commander, care to join me for a drink?<br>
As much as I'd like to accept her offer, I know all too well what Eugen's drinking habits are like...<br>
Oh? Is that hesitation in your eyes, hmm?<br>
Don't be afraid. I've finished my job of cheering my team on.<br>
If I so wanted, I could drink all the way into the morning with you. Heehee♪<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
You know who needs to carry you back to the dorm when you get blackout-drunk? It tends to be me.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Prinz Eugen：</span><br>
Mhm. Because I trust you to be there when I need you.<br>
What's the alternative? Are you going to leave me all by myself to pass out and spend the night in an empty stadium?<br>
I'm joking, of course~ Heehee♪<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
In all seriousness, the race hasn't even finished yet.<br>
I think it's a little too soon to celebrate your victory with a drink.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Prinz Eugen：</span><br>
Technically, yes, but practically, what's the difference? We all know who's going to win.<br>
Unless you're saying you're rooting for another team but ours?<br>
That's, let's say... not good.<br>
Just admit you bet on the wrong team and change your mind.<br>
A teasing glimmer reflects off her bared grin. She grabs my clothes and pulls me closer to her.<br>
Oh, I'd nearly forgotten. I was going to ask what you think about my outfit.<br>
No looking away now~<br>
What's your honest opinion?<br>
<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项1：It looks great on you.</span>'''''<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项2：It looks stunning on you.</span>'''''<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项3：It looks utterly breathtaking on you.</span>'''''<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Prinz Eugen：</span><br>
Heehee. Good♪ I've been cheering for Iron Blood in it all day now.<br>
And when we win, I'll be at our victory party, still wearing it.<br>
You'll be there too, won't you? Because you're rooting for Iron Blood, hmm?<br>
She slowly moves herself closer, and then speaks to me in a half-whisper...<br>
I'll need someone to look after me if I get a little too drunk at the party.<br>
You'll do it, won't you, Commander?<br>

4 Wind Catcher<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Enterprise：</span><br>
There is a lull between races, so I go for a stroll. During it, I come across Enterprise, showing support for the Eagle Union.<br>
Hey, Commander. You here to watch the race?<br>
One just ended, and it was incredible. It really taught me the appeal of watching cars speeding down the race track.<br>
What do you think about hosting another race same time, next year?<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Based on the glowing reception to it, I think we probably will.<br>
(Her outfit... it has unzipped to a dangerous degree.)<br>
<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项1：Let's go somewhere else for a minute.</span>'''''<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Enterprise：</span><br>
Into the shade, you mean?<br>
I appreciate the idea, but I can't. I'm not here as a mere spectator.<br>
See, I'm the Eagle Union's promo model. My job is to cheer them on, as evidenced by this outfit.<br>
If you're worried about me getting a heatstroke, don't be. This umbrella keeps me cool.<br>
Frankly, if I could, I'd get into a vehicle myself and race with the rest.<br>
I think it'd be a different kind of excitement to dashing across the sea.<br>
But, for now, all I can do is complete the task I accepted.<br>
Wanting to race, but being bound by her duty. That's a very Enterprise dilemma.<br>
She turns her attention to the race track and strikes a series of poses in support for her team.<br>
Meanwhile, the zipper seems to move further down, nearly exposing her chest.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
(This is bad...)<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Enterprise：</span><br>
Commander? Something the matter?<br>
Is it about me wanting to race? Obviously, I wouldn't just jump into a car and hit it. I'd learn all the intricacies of driving on a race track first.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
That's not it. It's your outfit. It's, well...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Enterprise：</span><br>
Oh, this?<br>
Yeah, I'll be the first to admit it shows a bit too much skin.<br>
But, it's what my friends asked me to wear. Besides, everyone seems to love it, so there's no problem on that front... Do you think it doesn't suit me?<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
No, it looks fantastic on you. What I'm trying to say is...<br>
<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项1：Zipper! The zipper!</span>'''''<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Enterprise：</span><br>
Suddenly, the audience bursts into excited cheering. The next race has just started.<br>
Enterprise has already turned around and gotten into her cheering and rooting mode.<br>
And the zipper, of course, shows no sign of stopping...<br>
The zipper? What about it?<br>
She acknowledges me calling attention to it, yet continues to wave her flag around.<br>
The larger and flashier the moves she makes, the deeper her outfit sinks into dangerous territory.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
(I need to do something!)<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Enterprise：</span><br>
With a deep breath, I come closer and reach for her chest...<br>
Huh?! C-Commander?!<br>
I take hold of the zipper, which has already gone past the danger zone...<br>
What?! O-out here?! B-but I...<br>
The circumstances being what they are, I had to spring into action despite the looks I'd inevitably get. For a moment, the scene turns chaotic.<br>
Fortunately, my actions made Enterprise see that her zipper was dangerously low, and she clears my name.<br>
Later, when I look back on this race, I fail to remember who won. The rush and tension of that moment made me forget...<br>

Ignition Matrician<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ulrich von Hutten：</span><br>
...Now then, I hope you all get the placing you're hoping for in the race.<br>
As Ulrich finished her speech, the drivers turned towards the race track with ambition in their hearts.<br>
Ulrich's flag flutters in the wind, dyed in Iron Blood red and black hues, much like the outfit she's wearing. She is stately, almost like a goddess of victory.<br>
<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项1：That was a rousing speech.</span>'''''<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ulrich von Hutten：</span><br>
Thanks. It's an honor.<br>
...Oh, it's you, Commander. I thought you had your hands full. What weird turn of events brought you here?<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Nothing in particular. I just happened to be passing by when I heard you deliver that motivational speech.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ulrich von Hutten：</span><br>
What can I say? It inspires the racers and ups the odds of my team winning.<br>
Same with this outfit. It's for their sake.<br>
Even the people who aren't participating directly get a kick out of a good speech and an outfit they like.<br>
Looks like its magic worked on you, too.<br>
I know I hit the bullseye. There's no point in looking away now. If you wanna stare, be my guest.<br>
If I didn't want you looking at me, I wouldn't have worn this in public in the first place.<br>
Everyone else who's dressed up for the occasion thinks the same.<br>
Nobody'll judge you for looking. Give 'em a complement or two and you'll be fine.<br>
There. That's how you do it.<br>
But remember – you can give compliments to everyone, but only one team can win.<br>
Speaking of, who do you think's gonna win?<br>
Every team is gunning for the gold. It's hard to say who's likely to win right now, so I answer her with a shrug.<br>
You dunno? So you think there's even a small chance Iron Blood will lose?<br>
I raise an eyebrow at Ulrich's supreme confidence in her team.<br>
Me, I'm 100% sure about it. We're going to win.<br>
Let me tell you what victory is. It's the natural result of precise calculations after eliminating all factors that worsen your odds.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Still, it's a non-zero-possibility, no matter how unlikely it is. Besides, isn't not knowing the result with perfect accuracy part of the thrill of a race?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ulrich von Hutten：</span><br>
Most people say that, sure.<br>
If you personally knew Iron Blood's might, if you've seen its potential, you'd think differently.<br>
Hell, I might as well ask... Do you have two hours to spare?<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Two whole hours? Why do you ask?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ulrich von Hutten：</span><br>
That's at least how much time I'm gonna need to convince you.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
The race is just about to start, though.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ulrich von Hutten：</span><br>
True... You'd miss all the action if you sat down to listen to me for two hours instead.<br>
Never mind, that was a bad idea. Forget it.<br>
I've got another, though...<br>
If you've got time AFTER the race, then I can enlighten you. Sound good?<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Enlighten me on how Iron Blood's victory is inevitable, you mean?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ulrich von Hutten：</span><br>
More than just that. I'll give you a tour of our simulated race track as well.<br>
Like they say – show, don't tell.<br>
There's also our garage, and the equipment we use to keep our vehicles in top shape.<br>
Because you've gotta be wondering just how we became such good racers.<br>
Actually... Two hours won't be nearly enough to cover everything.<br>
All things considered... Think you could spare the whole night?<br>
