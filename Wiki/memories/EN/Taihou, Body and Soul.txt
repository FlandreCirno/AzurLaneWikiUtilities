<br>
Chapter 1: A Secretary Ship's Duty (?) - Part 1<br>
Port - Office<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Taihou：</span><br>
Was it this document my Commander needed? I know it was, naturally.<br>
<br>
I hadn't yet said a word when Taihou was already handing me the paper I was about to ask for.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Taihou：</span><br>
Tea for my Commander♡<br>
<br>
... Just as I was starting to feel thirsty, Taihou brought me a cup of tea.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Taihou：</span><br>
Is my Commander feeling tense? Come, let Taihou rub your shoulders~<br>
<br>
... It's like she was able to sense the soreness in my shoulders.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Taihou：</span><br>
Hmm♪ hmm hmm♪<br>
<br>
I could feel Taihou's penetrating gaze...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Taihou：</span><br>
Don't mind me, my Commander. Just focus on your work~<br>
<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项1：Ask why she's staring at me.</span>'''''<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Taihou：</span><br>
Why, because you're so magnanimously stunning, my Commander~<br>
And how else am I supposed to learn more about you?<br>
Only by keeping my eyes on you 24/7 can I understand your needs well enough to service them at any time.<br>
That's part of a secretary ship's duty, after all.<br>
<br>
Somehow, it seemed like a reasonable explanation at the time.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Taihou：</span><br>
If there's anything you'd ever like to do, my Commander, you're free to do it. Leave the busywork to Taihou~<br>
(Whispering) Hehehe... Of course, Taihou is the only one my Commander will ever need...<br>
<br>
... I heard something I was probably not supposed to hear.<br>

<br>
Chapter 2: A Secretary Ship's Duty (?) - Part 2<br>
... A thick, pungent, and powerfully sweet smell hung heavy in the air.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">？？？：</span><br>
Hehehe... You're so cute when you sleep.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Taihou：</span><br>
... Delightful...<br>
Good morning, my Commander~ I was just panicking about how to properly wake you.<br>
Quickly taking in my surroundings, I was sure I was in my own quarters.<br>
Hehe, I've already prepared a delicious breakfast for you. Now let's get you cleaned up first~<br>
<br>
I wasn't sure how Taihou had gotten into my room, but I decided to deal with it after brushing my teeth.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Taihou：</span><br>
You're having a Sakura-style breakfast this morning, my Commander. I hope you enjoy it~<br>
Taihou looked at me with anticipation. She really wanted me to taste her cooking.<br>
<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项1：Thank the Ten Million Gods.</span>'''''<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Taihou：</span><br>
My Commander is so worldly! You know our Sakura Empire customs so well~<br>
By the way, I went ahead and cleaned up for you while you were sleeping, my Commander.<br>
(Whispering) Too bad I didn't find anything good...<br>
I thought I heard Taihou say something.<br>
<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项1：Ask Taihou how she got in.</span>'''''<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Taihou：</span><br>
It's obvious, isn't it? You always lock your door, so I copied the key.<br>
It's like I said, you're free to do anything you want. Just leave the busywork to Taihou~<br>
Anytime, anyplace, all day, every day, rain or shine, I will do anything and everything for you, my Commander~<br>
That is what a secretary ship's should do, after all.<br>
<br>
I got the feeling I was going to have to get used to this lifestyle.<br>

<br>
Chapter 3: Taihou's Nemesis(?)<br>
Port - Office<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Taihou：</span><br>
I'm here to serve as your eternally devoted secretary once again, my Commander. You need only focus on–<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Albacore：</span><br>
Surpriiiiiiise!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Taihou：</span><br>
Aaaaaieeeeeee! A-A-A-Albacore?!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Albacore：</span><br>
Ahahahahahaa! I got'cha good, didn't I?<br>
<br>
I was a lot more afraid of Taihou's reaction than I was of Albacore's surprise.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Taihou：</span><br>
What are you doing here?!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Albacore：</span><br>
Ahaha! I just came by to see you, Taihou. How you doing?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Taihou：</span><br>
Thanks to you, I'm a little on edge right now.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Albacore：</span><br>
Yeah, right, so anyway, I came across this new game. If you've got time today, how about we try it out?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Taihou：</span><br>
I have very important secretary ship duties today, duties that involve staying forever by my Commander's side. I don't have time to play with you–<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Albacore：</span><br>
Uhh... Duh~ Just bring the Commander along with us! C'mon, c'mon!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Taihou：</span><br>
(This little urchin acts all sweet and innocent to manipulate my Commander...!) <br>
Fine! I'll think about it.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Albacore：</span><br>
Hehee. Yay! Then I'll come back to get you later. Bye bye, Taihou, Commander!<br>
<br>
... They were getting along better than I expected.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Taihou：</span><br>
Getting along? With that child? I hope not.<br>
Every time she comes around I get dragged off to something...<br>
And this time she's roped you into it... I can't imagine what she's planning!<br>
<br>
It was unusual to see Taihou so ruffled. Could it be that Albacore was her "nemesis?"<br>

<br>
Chapter 4: A New Alliance(?)<br>
While out for a stroll on my day off, I came across Taihou having a chat.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">？？？：</span><br>
Hehe, you're a difficult lady to find, Taihou.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Taihou：</span><br>
I rather like staying alone in my room, except of course when I can be with my Commander~<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Shoukaku：</span><br>
Somehow I knew you'd say that.<br>
<br>
It was Shoukaku she was with.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Shoukaku：</span><br>
But you know, sitting here with you, I actually find you pretty easy to talk to.<br>
Unlike certain aircraft carriers giving off that "get the hell away from me" vibe. Hehehe♪<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Taihou：</span><br>
You're... You're talking about Akagi, aren't– Huh? This scent... my Commander?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Shoukaku：</span><br>
Scent...? Oh, Commander!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Taihou：</span><br>
Oooh, my Commander! Hehehe... did you come here just to see me? I'm. Touched~<br>
<br>
Before long, the three of us were having tea together.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Shoukaku：</span><br>
So you can recognize the Commander by scent alone? You're really something, Taihou...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Taihou：</span><br>
Ahaha! There's no one alive who can match Taihou's love of my Commander. Not even Akagi.<br>
Now fighting strength is a different story. Akagi has a lot more battlefield experience than I do. Hrrm...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Shoukaku：</span><br>
Hehe. Now what do you say to... an alliance?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Taihou：</span><br>
Alliance?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Shoukaku：</span><br>
If we joined forces, we'd definitely be more than a match for Akagi, don't you think?<br>
Am I right, Commander?<br>
<br>
While I was a little worried about Shoukaku's ulterior motives, I figured it was best to let them handle this for themselves.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Taihou：</span><br>
Well, if even my Commander agrees, then I guess–<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Shoukaku：</span><br>
Excellent. This marks the birth of the "Anti-Akagi Alliance". And that makes us official allies.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Taihou：</span><br>
(Whispering) Hehehe, let's see Akagi try to steal my Commander now!<br>
<br>
I saw a side of Taihou I hadn't seen in my secretary ship. It was sneakier, craftier, maybe happier?<br>
I couldn't for the life of me tell why she was in such a good mood.<br>

<br>
Chapter 5: A Mighty(?) Clash<br>
I was out patrolling the base with my secretary ship Taihou.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Taihou：</span><br>
Oh, hello, Akagi, Kaga.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Kaga：</span><br>
Hm. Taihou. Making the rounds with the Commander? How diligent.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Akagi：</span><br>
Commaaaanderrr~ And Taihou? Tch.<br>
Aha! Ahahaha! Ahahahahahaaa! I look away for how long, and the Commander's already covered in pesky little vermin?<br>
Looks like it's time for yet another round of "pest control."<br>
<br>
Crimson flames started to lick upward from Akagi's body... Until,<br>
(Smush)... I felt an incredible softness enveloping my arm. It was Taihou?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Taihou：</span><br>
Isn't it a shame, Akagi, that it's me, Taihou, at my Commander's side? Hmm?<br>
Oh but don't you worry. I'm doing a fine job in your place, Akagi. I've checked every inch of my Commander's body for "vermin." I've licked clean every~ nook~ and~ cranny~<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Akagi：</span><br>
Why you little... You're the one who copied the Commander's key! It's you who's been sneaking into that room every night to do heaven knows what...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Taihou：</span><br>
Hehehe. Wasn't it you who threatened Akashi into letting you replace all my Commander's lunches with your own "special ingredients"?<br>
<br>
The tension between the two of them was palpable, and Taihou's grip on my arm was getting tighter and tighter. I had completely lost my forearm to the softness.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Kaga：</span><br>
Ummm, Commander...?<br>
<br>
At least Kaga was looking out for me.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Taihou：</span><br>
Ahahahaa! To get to walk like this arm in arm with my Commander...<br>
I am truly the happiest girl alive!<br>
<br>
She certainly seemed jovial.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Taihou：</span><br>
To serve as your secretary, to give you the freedom to do whatever you want,<br>
I'm sure this is the way to earn our just rewards, for you and I both, my Commander.<br>
And that's how we ensure something like what happened back then, that will never happen again...<br>
<br>
It turned out this secretary ship job had a very special meaning for Taihou.<br>

<br>
Chapter 6: Taihou's Disappearance(?) - Part 1<br>
Port - Office<br>
Little by little, I'd been getting used to Taihou.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Taihou：</span><br>
I've prepared all your documents for the day right here, my Commander~<br>
These are the urgent ones, the lower priority ones are down here, and the ones unworthy of my Commander's attention are in the trash.<br>
Please let me know if there's anything else I can do for you.<br>
My Commander's been working so hard. Please have some tea.<br>
I went ahead and added that spice you were talking about with Yukikaze to your dinner.<br>
I also drew a bath for you. And if your shoulders are sore I hope you'll let me rub them for you♪<br>
... What's wrong, my Commander? Could it be you...<br>
... want to taste me? Want to bathe with me? Or maaaaybee~ You want to do some filthy, depraved things with me~?<br>
<br>
I'd even gotten used to her saying stuff like that.<br>
She would cross the line from time to time, but even so Taihou was an objectively dedicated secretary who took her job seriously. Still...<br>
I worried she was neglecting her own health for my sake...<br>
I decided it would probably be a good idea for Taihou to take a day off.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Taihou：</span><br>
... My Commander...<br>
<br>
I saw a new emotion welling up inside Taihou, overpowering her. It was loneliness.<br>
The next day, Taihou disappeared.<br>

<br>
Chapter 7: Taihou's Disappearance(?) - Part 2<br>
There was no breakfast waiting for me when I woke up the next morning.<br>
... Taihou?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Shoukaku：</span><br>
Commander, you don't look so good. What happened?<br>
Taihou? ... I haven't seen her. Isn't she always with you?<br>
<br>
I went to the office, but there was still no sign of her...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Albacore：</span><br>
Commander! Thank goodness you're here! You gotta come quick! It's Taihou! She–<br>
I'm sorry. It's all my fault. I was just joking around with her. I said she was being too clingy and she was just gonna end up pushing you away.<br>
I really didn't think anything of it. I never thought she'd lock herself away in her room like this...<br>
You're the only one she'll listen to, Commander... So, it's gotta be you. Please get Taihou to come out of her room!<br>
<br>
Taihou's door was closed tight.<br>
<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项1：Knock on the door and announce yourself.</span>'''''<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Taihou：</span><br>
Is that my Commander...?<br>
Taihou sounded weaker than I'd ever heard her before.<br>
I always thought everything I was doing was for your sake, my Commander. But I never for a second thought about how you felt.<br>
When Albacore said that to me yesterday, I suddenly realized how clingy I'd been. How awful I'd been.<br>
But I'm in love with my Commander. All I ever think about is my Commander. When I close my eyes, all I see is my Commander. You're my whole world...<br>
<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项1：Tell her it's okay.</span>'''''<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Taihou：</span><br>
... You don't think I interfere with your life too much?<br>
You don't think I'm greedy for wanting to know everything about you at all times? You won't feel annoyed?<br>
You won't pretend to like me to my face, only to turn around and hate me behind my back?<br>
<br>
Taihou sobbed out her questions.<br>
<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项1：Tell her you need her.</span>'''''<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Taihou：</span><br>
...... is that......<br>
... true?<br>
You really don't hate me? You're really not just tolerating me? You really love me?<br>
<br>
…————<br>
I didn't even have time to answer before she threw open the door.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Taihou：</span><br>
My Commanderrrrrrr!!!<br>
<br>
Taihou pulled me close and buried me in her chest. It seems she already knew.<br>
She knew the only answer I could give her... was "yes."<br>
