<br>
1.Easily Distracted<br>
Port - Office<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Allen M. Sumner：</span><br>
Oh, man! I so need to get these! Wonder if Akashi sells 'em at her store?<br>
Ooh, they made a sequel to that novel Cooper liked! I'll give it a read then tell her about it!<br>
Although... I don't wanna end up spoiling it for her. Hmm... I guess I'll save it for later...<br>
<br>
…………<br>
I tasked Allen M. Sumner, my secretary, with organizing commission paperwork. It seemed she hadn't made much progress.<br>
<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项1："Hey, Allen?"</span>'''''<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Allen M. Sumner：</span><br>
Right here!<br>
What's up, Commander?<br>
...The work you just assigned me? Oh, right, uhh...<br>
<br>
My query caught her off guard. She quickly hid the magazine in her hand behind a pillow on the couch.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Allen M. Sumner：</span><br>
Sorry about that! I found that little mag among the docs you gave me, and kinda got sidetracked...<br>
<br>
I couldn't blame her for getting distracted now and then, but this was the third time just today.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Allen M. Sumner：</span><br>
Enough being lazy, time to sort through the stuff right now! Just gimme a sec!<br>
Whew... Here you go. How'd I do?<br>
<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项1："Let's have a look."</span>'''''<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Allen M. Sumner：</span><br>
(Fingers crossed!)<br>
<br>
We only barely finished the work on time, but her concentrated effort was what made it possible.<br>
There was no problem with her performance in and of itself, but having to keep tabs on her like this felt cumbersome.<br>
She may need an incentive to stay focused. I decided to brainstorm some ideas...<br>

2.Sticker Star<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Allen M. Sumner：</span><br>
You serious?! You'll reward me if I do a good job?<br>
Wowzie! You're the best boss ever, Commander! Now I see why everyone likes you!<br>
Wonder what the reward's gonna be! Might just go the extra mile so I can find out~<br>
<br>
Whether or not this would help her concentrate remained to be seen, but she definitely sounded more motivated than before.<br>
I decided to take it one step further and give her a concrete goal to work towards.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Allen M. Sumner：</span><br>
Say what? You'll even let me choose the reward? You sure about that?<br>
Like, what if I pick something that'll make people start weird rumors about you? Wouldn't want that, would you?<br>
Unless... that IS what you want? Everyone gets their kicks one way or another.<br>
<br>
She made a... strangely good point. If she asked for something too bizarre, I would just tell her to pick something else.<br>
Port - Shop<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Allen M. Sumner：</span><br>
I've decided, Commander! I want this!<br>
<br>
Allen picked up a brochure from the counter, showed it to me, and pointed to a piece of furniture on it.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Allen M. Sumner：</span><br>
That's right! A three-star luxury massage chair!<br>
<br>
It wasn't something I'd expect Allen to want, but if it would help her concentrate on her work, then it was all good.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Allen M. Sumner：</span><br>
There's this campaign where if you buy one of these, you get a limited-edition sticker set as a bonus!<br>
I've always wanted this set, but I never had the money for it. Thanks a bunch for finally uniting me with these little beauts!<br>
<br>
Now her choice made sense. She has always had a thing for stickers.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Allen M. Sumner：</span><br>
On that note, there's actually one more thing I want...<br>
<br>
One more thing? That wasn't part of the deal, but I felt curious...<br>
<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项1："What would that be?"</span>'''''<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Allen M. Sumner：</span><br>
Before you ask, don't worry, it won't cost you anything! It's not something you can just walk into a store and buy!<br>
As for what it is, you'll see soon enough~<br>
All righty, we're done here! Let's head on back and get to work!<br>

3.Work Hard, Play Hard<br>
Port - Office<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Allen M. Sumner：</span><br>
Wonder what Cooper's doing ri– Wait, I'm supposed to be working. Save it for later, Allen...<br>
Oh, was that a Juustagram notification? Wonder what's trending today. Maybe the commander sent me a mes–<br>
No, Allen! Resist the urge and focus on work! The whole afternoon's gonna pass by in a flash if you check Juustagram!<br>
Two hours to go until the commander's done for the day! Just gotta hang in there!<br>
<br>
Allen was engaged in a tug of war with her own impulses.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Allen M. Sumner：</span><br>
Ugghh! Been two weeks since my last day off work... I wanna go shoppiiiing... Heck, I'd settle for just an evening of window shopping...<br>
I want more star stickers! I wanna put another on my jacket, my rigging, and on Heinrich...<br>
<br>
I had to step in, or else she may have given in to her whims.<br>
<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项1："Keep it up. We're almost done."</span>'''''<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Allen M. Sumner：</span><br>
Oops, right! I'm supposed to be working!<br>
Just gimme a bit, I'll have that report written in no time!<br>
<br>
She resumed work after I reminded her about it.<br>
The incentive of a reward did increase her concentration, but it seemed a good idea to pursue another approach.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Allen M. Sumner：</span><br>
...You'll go shopping with me tomorrow? Really?<br>
I mean, I'd work better after a day of taking it easy, but are you sure it's smart for you to tag along?<br>
Y'know. People might get weird ideas and start rumors if they see us together... Actually, I've got an idea!<br>
Mind if some of my friends come with us? Great! This is gonna be awesome!<br>
<br>
And so, we decided to meet tomorrow to go shopping with her friends.<br>

4.Shopping in the Daylight<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Bremerton：</span><br>
A'ight, we'll head down the street and look for the stuff the R&D girls wanted. Leaving the office supplies to you all~<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Stephen Potter：</span><br>
Works for me. Here's the shopping list, folks.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Allen M. Sumner：</span><br>
Sweet! Let's meet up here after we're done!<br>
<br>
After buying mostly everything on the shopping list, we returned to the meeting spot. Strangely, though...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Allen M. Sumner：</span><br>
They're still not back...<br>
<br>
Allen and I were the only ones there.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Allen M. Sumner：</span><br>
This is awkward... The whole reason I invited 'em was so people wouldn't mistake us for a couple or something. Why'd they bail on us like that?<br>
<br>
We gave Bremerton a call. She said the things they bought were really heavy, so she and Stephen Potter went back to port early.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Allen M. Sumner：</span><br>
Welp. What do we do now, Commander? Go home?<br>
<br>
Allen sounded let down by this turn of events.<br>
I arranged this outing expressly for Allen's sake. It would be a shame to conclude her day of leisure prematurely.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Allen M. Sumner：</span><br>
...We can have a look around the stores I wanna check out? Really?!<br>
Oh my gosh, thank you, Commander!<br>
Don't get me wrong, I'm so happy you'd do that with me, but you don't HAVE to go that far just for me, you know...<br>
<br>
I didn't have any obligations to tend to on that day, so I decided to spend it together with her.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Allen M. Sumner：</span><br>
Well, if you say it's fine, then I'm not gonna argue with that. Let's go!<br>
<br>
And with that, our shopping trip continued.<br>

5.Dinner in the Sunset<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Allen M. Sumner：</span><br>
Om nom! Mmm! Thif if deeewifious!<br>
...Oops, did I just talk with my mouth full? Excuse my bad table manners!<br>
As I was saying: this food is *mwah*! Thanks for introducing me to this amazing restaurant, Commander!<br>
<br>
After we'd visited all the stores she wanted to check out, I treated Allen to dinner at a restaurant I frequent.<br>
Before we knew it, the day had grown late. The restaurant's fancy interior was basked in the beautiful glow of sunset.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Allen M. Sumner：</span><br>
All righty, lemme take a quick look at the shopping list while we wait for our next dish.<br>
Check... Check... Oh right, this one was outta stock, so we'll have to ask Akashi if she can order it for us.<br>
<br>
Allen wolfed down the appetizers and decided to spend the time checking off items on the shopping list.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Allen M. Sumner：</span><br>
………………<br>
Hey, Commander? There's something I've been meaning to ask you.<br>
Aren't you kinda spoiling me for no real reason? I barely do any work around the office and I don't exactly make your job any easier.<br>
Sure, the promise of a reward made me try a little harder, but I'm not giving you nearly as much as you're giving me...<br>
<br>
She hid her face behind the shopping list. It must have been embarrassing for her to say this.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Allen M. Sumner：</span><br>
...What I'm trying to say is, it's literally my job as your secretary to help out around the office. Isn't it weird to reward me for just, you know, doing my job?<br>
<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项1："I don't think it's weird at all."</span>'''''<br>
<br>
"A commander's job and a shipgirl's job are very different, but I treasure my relationship with all of you."<br>
"You always do your best, Allen. I know you do. It would be weird NOT to reward you for it."<br>
"Although, I suppose it is weird to call it a 'reward,' now that you mention it. Think of it as my way of saying thank you."<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Allen M. Sumner：</span><br>
Well, I suppose we are good friends, that's definitely true...<br>
That explains it! If that's how it is, then it's about time I started giving it one-hundo percent!<br>
Or at the very least, work as hard as you do, hehe~<br>

6.A Surprise Gift<br>
Allen's work ethic underwent a drastic change ever since she said she'd "give it one-hundo percent" at the end of our shopping trip. And indeed, she did.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Allen M. Sumner：</span><br>
The documents you handed me? Already done! C'mon, Commander, keep it together.<br>
Look! Left 'em right here~<br>
Remember to do your own work too instead of focusing on making sure I do mine. Just saying.<br>
<br>
She didn't need any supervision at all. In fact, the tables had turned. Now I was the one receiving reminders.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Allen M. Sumner：</span><br>
On another note, isn't my thank-you present supposed to arrive today?<br>
Boy oh boy, I can't wait to finally have my hands on that sticker set!<br>
<br>
Oh yes. She had her eyes on a three-star luxury massage chair. Although...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Allen M. Sumner：</span><br>
There's this campaign where if you buy one of these, you get a limited-edition sticker set as a bonus!<br>
I've always wanted this set, but I never had the money for it. Thanks a bunch for finally uniting me with these little beauts!<br>
<br>
What she really wanted was the sticker set that came with it as a bonus.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Akashi：</span><br>
Thank you for your patronyage~ The Manjuus will have your comfy new chair set up in the office shortly, nya.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Allen M. Sumner：</span><br>
Thanks, Akashi! And you too, Commander!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Akashi：</span><br>
Also, who's going to be using this chair, nya? I'm asking for future reference with regards to warranty service, nya.<br>
<br>
It was a gift for Allen, so naturally that's what I was going to say. But Allen was quicker to answer.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Allen M. Sumner：</span><br>
The commander, duh! You've gotta work your butt off to be worthy of sitting in a massage chair!<br>
Right, Commander? Hehe~<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Akashi：</span><br>
I thought so, nya! So it's a gift to reward the commander's hard work, nya? How touching, nya.<br>
It's a bit weird that the commander's the one paying for it, but I'm a merchant, not an interrogator, nya. Best to mind my own business, nya.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Allen M. Sumner：</span><br>
I was gonna say! Mind your own business!<br>
<br>
It seemed, for better or worse, I had played into Allen's hand all along.<br>

7.What Allen Wanted<br>
Port - Office<br>
We went back to the office. Manjuus came waddling out the door, having finished installing the chair just as we arrived.<br>
As per Allen's recommendation, I immediately gave the chair a try.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Allen M. Sumner：</span><br>
So, whaddya think? Pretty comfy, right?<br>
Pretty much the best reward I could've chosen, if I do say so myself~ Once you're done, I wanna take it for a spin too.<br>
<br>
Allen stood behind the chair and spoke to me.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Allen M. Sumner：</span><br>
Although, this chair's less of a reward and more like me returning your kindness.<br>
It's funny when you think about it. Your reward idea motivated me to take my job more seriously, and because I did, you rewarded me.<br>
I got pretty much all I could want. The stickers, access to this chair, and that thing I talked about before.<br>
<br>
That reminded me – she still hadn't told me what that "other thing" she wanted was.<br>
<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项1："What exactly is that last thing you want?"</span>'''''<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Allen M. Sumner：</span><br>
What? Just told you, I've already got it. Didn't cost you anything, like I said.<br>
Wait, don't tell me...<br>
<br>
She flashed a teasing grin, then came around and sat down in my lap.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Allen M. Sumner：</span><br>
...You don't get what I mean, do you? You're one dense commander, huh~<br>
Then let me spell it out. You know how your constant reminders helped me stay focused so I could do actual work?<br>
I've kiiinda become dependent on them. I love the attention you give me, because you make me feel wanted and cared about.<br>
<br>
That's when I realized what she wanted from me. A few words. I opened my mouth to speak...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Allen M. Sumner：</span><br>
Ahaha! Don't say it, Commander, I already know~<br>
<br>
She put a small sticker on my mouth using her index finger.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Allen M. Sumner：</span><br>
You wanted to thank me because you treasure our relationship, remember? I feel the same!<br>
So you don't have to say or do anything special. Just keep doing what you have all this time~<br>
<br>
…………<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Allen M. Sumner：</span><br>
This is just my own way of saying thanks, Commander.<br>
For everything you do, and for who you are.<br>
Consider that kiss a little bonus for you, just like these stickers were to me~<br>
