Chapter 1 - A Wormhole To Another Dimension<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Neptune：</span><br>
Look, I found something! Come here, Noire, there's some kind of hole over here!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Noire：</span><br>
It's just as Histoire said in her message. It appears to be a wormhole that's bending space itself... But why has it popped into existence here of all places?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Neptune：</span><br>
Hey, do you think this could be, like, connected some other dimension or something?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Noire：</span><br>
Don't be ridiculous. You've just got manga and light novels on the brain.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Neptune：</span><br>
You just don't get it, do you? Nothing fun's ever gonna happen if all we do is say that and move on! There's gotta be a wonderful new world waiting for us on the other end of this hole! Or, that's what it looks like.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Noire：</span><br>
There you go with your insane rambling again. Let's just check it out really quick and report back to Hist...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Neptune：</span><br>
A CPU must be brave and bold! I'm going straight into that thing!Check out my super cool double cannonball!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Noire：</span><br>
What are you doing?! Stop!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Neptune：</span><br>
Nep nep?!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Noire：</span><br>
Noiiiiiiiiire?!<br>
<br>
SPLASSSSSHHHHH!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Neptune：</span><br>
Blub blub blub... Gasp! W-Where the heck are we? Is this the ocean?! I mean, it doesn't look like a swimming pool!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Noire：</span><br>
Where the heck indeed. There's water in every direction. Don't tell me we actually ended up in another dimension...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Neptune：</span><br>
*Gasp* Blub... I can't swim! I'm gonna drown! Help me, Noire!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Noire：</span><br>
Stop, let go of me! It's hard enough just to keep myself afloat! Wait... I've got an idea.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Black Heart：</span><br>
We can just turn into CPUs and fly to safety.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Neptune：</span><br>
Whoa! You're so smart, Noire! Alright, I guess I'd better... transform!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Purple Heart：</span><br>
Phew... This will have to do, for now.<br>
Okay, back to the matter at hand. What is this place? I believe when we began examining that wormhole, it sucked us in here...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Black Heart：</span><br>
Incorrect. You said that it would be fun to jump into the wormhole. I tried to stop you but you just dragged me into it. We were hardly sucked into it.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Purple Heart：</span><br>
Black Heart, I do believe it's time we leave the past behind us. I've already forgotten what happened.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Black Heart：</span><br>
Typical Purple Heart. Always getting amnesia when it's most convenient for you.<br>
But seriously... where are we? This place reminds me of Gamindustri, but I know we've gone somewhere else entirely. Hm... I can barely feel the power of shares here...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Purple Heart：</span><br>
Additionally, I can see wrecked ships littering the ocean. Are they... battleships?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Black Heart：</span><br>
There are collapsed buildings on the ocean floor and some strange debris floating around. Could this place have been a battlefield? One thing fought another, and then they...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Purple Heart：</span><br>
Black Heart, look out!<br>
<br>
KA-BAAAANG!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Black Heart：</span><br>
Phew, we really dodged a bullet there. Thank you, Purple Heart.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Purple Heart：</span><br>
It's too early to thank me. Look over there.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Black Heart：</span><br>
What the?!<br>
<span style="color:#ff0000;">？？？：</span><br>
......<br>
......<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Black Heart：</span><br>
Is that... Are they... Us?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Purple Heart：</span><br>
No, we're over here. They're obviously just doppelgangers.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Black Heart：</span><br>
First they impersonate us, then they attack us? Hah, I suppose imitation is the sincerest form of flattery... Let's give them a taste of their own medicine!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Purple Heart：</span><br>
Hold up, Noire. I think it's best we retreat for the time being.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Black Heart：</span><br>
What the hell are you saying?! I'm not joking around here! They came straight out of nowhere and challenged us to a fight!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Purple Heart：</span><br>
Calm down. We can't beat them, not like we are now.<br>
That attack we dodged... It was as powerful as the combined power of both of us if we mustered every single bit of strength we have.<br>
What's more... Remember what you said earlier? That you can barely feel any share influence in this world? ...As it is now, we don't stand a single chance against those two.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Black Heart：</span><br>
Our lack of shares is the problem...?! I hate to admit it, but I suppose you're right!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Purple Heart：</span><br>
Now that you understand, we should retreat to fight another day.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Black Heart：</span><br>
I suppose we have no choice... Listen here, you fakes! Next time we meet, I won't be as nice to you!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Neptune：</span><br>
...And that's the gist of it. We were in some serious trouble!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Laffey：</span><br>
I see... Serious trouble, huh...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Neptune：</span><br>
We couldn't muster any strength even after transforming into CPUs, then we went some random direction, then we wandered across the ocean, then we headed this direction... And finally, we made it here, somehow!<br>
Then we spotted villager number one! The first person we found was you, Laffey!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Laffey：</span><br>
Umm... Are you sure you don't mean that you were caught by me...?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Noire：</span><br>
I know how it feels to want to correct Neptune all the time.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Neptune：</span><br>
Man, we were soooo exhausted going around the whole night! It was an all night wander-athon! Oh yeah, Laffey, where are we? What's this world like? Also, is this a school? Is it some kind of school where people with superpowers gather or something? Or is it an academy for pretty girls?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Laffey：</span><br>
Uhh, well... This is an academy, we come here often...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Neptune：</span><br>
Aha! I knew it was an academy! So like, you got a cafeteria with good food? Or an infirmary that doubles as a kitchen? Or a place that's like, "BAM, this is what we're known for!", you know? Like a drive-in movie theater where guys can take their gals out on a clichéd date...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Laffey：</span><br>
Uhh... Um, I'm sorry...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Neptune：</span><br>
Nep?! Sorry for what, Laffey?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Noire：</span><br>
Get a clue, Neptune... When you ask question after question at machine gun RPM, nobody's going to be able to answer you.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Laffey：</span><br>
Yeah... I can only process data so fast, and I can't keep up.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Neptune：</span><br>
Oh. Oops. Sorry... 'Kay, I'll speak more slowly then. What should I ask first...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Laffey：</span><br>
Okay. But... I'm not very talkative... I don't know if I could help...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Noire：</span><br>
I see. Then is there anyone else around here who could answer our questions?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Laffey：</span><br>
One of my friends could...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Javelin：</span><br>
What's up, Laffey? ...Hm? Who are these people?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Z23：</span><br>
There seems to be a lot of commotion going on over here... Were you two just assigned here?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Laffey：</span><br>
Yawn... You can take over from here...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Javelin：</span><br>
Take over? What do you want me to take over?!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Z23：</span><br>
It's likely that she's referring to those people she was just talking to. Who are you two, and where did you come from...?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Neptune：</span><br>
Oh right, we haven't introduced ourselves yet! The name's Neptune, and this lass here's my buddy...<br>
<br>
WEEEEEH! WEEEEEH! WEEEEEH! <br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Neptune：</span><br>
Nep?! Is that a siren I hear?! What's it for?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Z23：</span><br>
The emergency attack siren? There's... an enemy raid incoming?!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">{{AF|Ayanami}}：</span><br>
So this is where you all were... I was looking for you.<br>
I have an emergency telegram from HQ. A Mirror Sea has appeared in the vicinity of the academy's shore... A fleet must be dispatched to scout the area immediately. They're counting on us, Z23.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Z23：</span><br>
Understood! I will attack at once!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Javelin：</span><br>
Hold on a sec, Z23! I'll go with you!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Laffey：</span><br>
If you're all going... Then I guess I'll go too...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Neptune：</span><br>
...Welp, they all went to fight whatever, I guess.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Noire：</span><br>
A Mirror Sea... Those words caught my attention.<br>
That might serve as a clue for figuring out what kind of world we've come to... We should hurry and catch up to those girls.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Neptune：</span><br>
Sure. I'd be bored out of my mind just standing here and waiting for them anyway... Wait for us, guys!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">？？？：</span><br>
...Just when I thought we'd caught up to them, they disappear... Sigh, can't I just catch a break for once?<br>
I am fairly certain that as long as those two are involved, there will be breaks to catch for nobody.<br>

<br>
Chapter 2 - What You Need Is A CPU!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Z23：</span><br>
...I see. So in short, you came here from another dimension, correct?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Neptune：</span><br>
Yup, that's right! I'm Neptune, nice to meet you! Some people call me Nep-Nep, others call me Neppy, but you can call me whatever you want!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Javelin：</span><br>
Okay then, let's go with Nep-Nep. It sounds cute.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Neptune：</span><br>
Oooh, I see you're a woman of culture! Also, we came from this place called Gamindustri, and I'm the CPU of a country we call Planeptune!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">{{AF|Ayanami}}：</span><br>
A CPU...? You don't look like a machine to me, though... Do you have any proof of that?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Neptune：</span><br>
You want proof? Fiiiiine, guess I'll just have to prove it. Just stay on the line while I... TRANSFOOOORM!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Purple Heart：</span><br>
...Phew. Having no shares makes it really difficult to remain in this form.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">{{AF|Ayanami}}：</span><br>
Whoa! She actually transformed...!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Z23：</span><br>
Hold on, aren't you one of the enemies from the Mirror Sea we just fought?!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Laffey：</span><br>
So we just fought... Nep-Nep?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Purple Heart：</span><br>
No, let me explain. What you fought were imposters pretending to be us.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Neptune：</span><br>
...No need to stay in CPU form now that I've proven myself! Anyway, we also fought those imposters earlier, but we don't have enough shares, so we couldn't use our powers like normal and we had to do the ole run for our lives act. Think you could help us out?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Z23：</span><br>
You're asking me like I'd even know how to help...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Noire：</span><br>
She's right. We won't get anywhere asking about something they know nothing about. We'll just confuse them... Oh, pardon, my name is Noire. I'm the CPU of Lastation. You'll have to excuse my pink-haired friend here.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Z23：</span><br>
We should introduce ourselves as well... I'm Z23. You don't need to be so formal with me.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Javelin：</span><br>
I'm Javelin! Nice to meet you!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">{{AF|Ayanami}}：</span><br>
I'm Ayanami... It's a pleasure.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Noire：</span><br>
We're sorry for being such a nuisance... We only just arrived in this world and we don't even know which way's left or right...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Z23：</span><br>
No, no, not at all. I'm certain that you have been equally inconvenienced.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">{{AF|Ayanami}}：</span><br>
So you came from another dimension, huh... I see that all the time in anime, so I think I understand.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Z23：</span><br>
Ayanami, you do know anime is just fiction, right...?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Noire：</span><br>
Sounds like something you'd hear Neptune say...<br>
Anyway... Could you tell me more about this world? We know that while there aren't many shares in this world, they do exist, so I think there has to be some kind of connection between this world and Gamindustri.<br>
Those imposters of us that appeared, and the many mysteries surrounding Mirror Seas... Do you think they might have something to do with why we were sent to this world?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">{{AF|Ayanami}}：</span><br>
...If possible, we'd like to find that out as well.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Z23：</span><br>
For now, I sent a request to the commander regarding your housing and stay at the academy. I received his approval just a while ago so you should have nothing to worry about.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Neptune：</span><br>
Wowzers! Does it include room service and 3 meals a day?! Tonight, we dine in heaven, Noire! Thanks a ton, Z23!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Noire：</span><br>
We're not gonna need any room service, you know... That aside, thank you, Z23. We both owe you for this.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Z23：</span><br>
Not at all, it was my pleasure. Incidentally, would you two happen to be hungry?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">{{AF|Ayanami}}：</span><br>
You can't fight on an empty stomach, as they say. We have some food if you'd like to eat.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Noire：</span><br>
Ah, thank you. I haven't had anything to eat ever since we came to this world. I could eat a horse, downloadable armor and all.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Neptune：</span><br>
I thought you'd never ask! What's on the menu?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">？？？：</span><br>
Oh my, aren't we all enjoying ourselves? Would you mind if I joined in on the fun?<br>
Finally, there you are... If only you'd looked for us as much as we looked for you...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Neptune：</span><br>
Nep-Nep?! Is that who I think it is...?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Noire：</span><br>
Vert? And Blanc? How in this world did you end up here?!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Vert：</span><br>
Are you both in good health?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Neptune：</span><br>
I knew it, Vert and Blanc are here too! Let me guess: you guys had no idea where the academy was and you were floating around in the ocean up until now?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Blanc：</span><br>
Our names don't start with "N" and end with "eptune" so no, that's not the case.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Vert：</span><br>
We were worried about you so we came out to meet you here.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Neptune：</span><br>
Wow! A friend in need is a friend indeed! What you need is a CPU!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Blanc：</span><br>
We're not here to rescue you guys or anything like that... Hey! Let go of me! I'm not a tissue for you to cry and blow your nose into!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Noire：</span><br>
So, is it just you two? What about Histoire?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Vert：</span><br>
Gamindustri is currently experiencing a CPU shortage, so she decided to stay behind.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Blanc：</span><br>
Apparently she wanted us to go investigate this world then report back...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Vert：</span><br>
She told us to come here and thoroughly investigate the wormhole as well as what, if any, connection this world has to Gamindustri.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Javelin：</span><br>
It looks like Noire and Neptune's got some company!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">{{AF|Ayanami}}：</span><br>
Now there are 4 of them, and 4 of us...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Z23：</span><br>
Ahahaha... I think things are going to get busy around here.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Laffey：</span><br>
Yawn... You guys take over from here... I'm gonna rest... Zzzzz...<br>

<br>
Chapter 3 - Cross-Cultural Contact<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Neptune：</span><br>
Everyone together now, let's make some noise! I'll nep up your face~♪<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Laffey & Javelin：</span><br>
I'll nep up your face~♪<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">{{AF|Inazuma}}&{{AF|Ikazuchi}}：</span><br>
I'll nep up your face~♪<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Saratoga & San Diego：</span><br>
I'll nep up your face~♪<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Neptune：</span><br>
No, no! You gotta hold the torpedoes like glow sticks then swing them like you're hitting an invisible anvil above you while you show me your dance moves! Yeah, that's it! That's the way!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Noire：</span><br>
Hold on, Neptune! What in the world are you teaching these poor little kids?! It's really worrying to see them do stuff like this!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Neptune：</span><br>
Relax, they're just replicas! I'm working on the lyrics and choreography for this new song I've named "Nep-Nep Style"! All we need is small breakout performance and these destroyers are gonna smash everything else on the charts!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Noire：</span><br>
That's not what I was talking about... Ah, screw it.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">{{AF|Ayanami}}：</span><br>
Is she ignoring the fact there are carriers and light cruisers here too...?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Z23：</span><br>
It has the kind of rhythm that seems like it'll be popular even among battleships and heavy cruisers before long.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Noire：</span><br>
Dear god... You don't have a clue what this world is like, yet you go around acting all nonchalant like you already know everything, Neptune.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Neptune：</span><br>
Hmm... I guess it's true I've got no clue about this place, but come on, it's fine! It's not like anyone's getting hurt! Besides, you know what they say: a rising tide lifts all boats.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Noire：</span><br>
That optimism of yours is truly enviable. But I suppose Histoire did tell us to investigate this world, so we should hurry up and find out more.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Neptune：</span><br>
Uggghh, you're always so serious, Noire. We can leave that to our future selves to handle. Let's just have fun with everyone instead! Okay, guys, what should we do next? Since everyone's here, how about kick the can or tag?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Javelin：</span><br>
Let's go with kick the can. We can use this in place of a can!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Noire：</span><br>
You can't kick a torpedo around! Don't you understand that's dangerous?!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Laffey：</span><br>
It's fine, we've removed the fuse from it...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Noire：</span><br>
I-I don't think that's the problem here...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Neptune：</span><br>
Fiiiine, let's do tag then! I'll be it for the first round!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">{{AF|Ikazuchi}}：</span><br>
I see! You're so considerate, Nep-Nep! Okay everyone, let's ctrl+esc out of here, before she tags us!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">{{AF|Inazuma}}：</span><br>
...I will follow you. "Of the thirty-six stratagems, fleeing is best," as they say...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">San Diego：</span><br>
Yeehaw! I'm gonna hide somewhere exciting!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Saratoga：</span><br>
Commence Operation Retreat! Run away and hide!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Noire：</span><br>
Sigh... They've already turned into mini-Neptunes. Some other girls are getting into it as well... I don't think I can keep up with these guys anymore.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">{{AF|Ayanami}}：</span><br>
That said... Everyone's enjoying themselves and having fun.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Z23：</span><br>
I don't believe that there's anything wrong with this either.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Noire：</span><br>
...Well, I guess. To be honest, I don't hate it either.<br>
Oh yeah, Vert and Blanc... Uh, those 2 that arrived here after we did, where are they? They should've received temporary housing and permission to stay here as well...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Z23：</span><br>
Ah, Vert and Blanc? If you're wondering what they're up to, then...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Vert：</span><br>
Oh dear... Have I died and gone to CPU heaven?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">{{AF|Mutsuki}}：</span><br>
Veeeeert, could I have more candy?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">{{AF|Kisaragi}}：</span><br>
It's unfair if she gets all of it... I want some too, please...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">{{AF|Uzuki}}：</span><br>
Me, me! Me too! I want even more candy than they do!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Vert：</span><br>
Don't worry, there's enough to go around for everyone~! I've got candy, marshmallows, chocolate... I don't have any lollipops, but I have everything else you could imagine, and lots of it~!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">{{AF|Mutsuki}}：</span><br>
Yaaaay! You have so much candy I've never tasted before!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">{{AF|Kisaragi}}：</span><br>
I like this chocolate...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">{{AF|Uzuki}}：</span><br>
Mmmm, these marshmallows are so fluffy!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Vert：</span><br>
Hahah... I never would've thought this box of candy I happened to bring with me would come in handy... You never know what's going to happen. Okay, children, come sit on Vert's lap~!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ark Royal：</span><br>
Grrrrr... How DARE you lure these cute little kids in with candy... I've never been so angry yet so jealous at the same time!<br>
...Next time, I'll just copy your strategy!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">{{AF|Ayanami}}：</span><br>
...Something like that. I saw her playing games with some of the children.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Noire：</span><br>
Didn't you mention someone that should set off stranger danger alarms for anyone?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Z23：</span><br>
If you're talking about Ark Royal then that's just her modus operandi...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Noire：</span><br>
Huh, I see... So what about Blanc?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Z23：</span><br>
Blanc expressed an interest in this world's books, so I told her where our library is located. I'll go take a look at how she's doing later.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Noire：</span><br>
Everyone's enjoying their time in this world in their own way, I guess... Perhaps I should let myself have a look around the academy as well.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">{{AF|Ayanami}}：</span><br>
If so, I could be your guide, if you'd like.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Noire：</span><br>
Yes please, Ayanami. Well then, after you.<br>

<br>
Chapter 4 - A Room, Two Gamers, And I<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Vert：</span><br>
This should be the place... Ah, you've got such a wonderful gaming PC!<br>
This room is just the right size, it's just messy enough, the only source of light is the PC monitor, and there's always snacks and drinks just within arm's reach...<br>
It's pretty much perfect... This is what I'd call a room fit for a gamer.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Long Island：</span><br>
Come on iiiin. Welcome to the Gamer Girl Grotto.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">{{AF|Yuubari}}：</span><br>
This is a place of relaxation for those who have been freed of their duties, a place where they can spend some time as social rejects and indulge in their love of games and degeneracy... You are welcome here!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Vert：</span><br>
Indeed it is. A place such as this is absolutely indispensable for us gamers... I totally know that feel...<br>
When we play games, we don't want to be interrupted by anyone, we want to be free and, how should I say it... We need a place to soothe our minds. An isolated, quiet, peaceful place...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">{{AF|Yuubari}}：</span><br>
Hum hum, that is the deepest thing I've heard all month... You are a pro, aren't you?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Long Island：</span><br>
Ayanami told me about you, but I never thought we'd be so in sync with each other... You're a TRUE gamer, aren't you, Miss?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Vert：</span><br>
Ohoho, I am honored by your words of praise... However, I have only just gotten started.<br>
I will now give you a lecture on what it really means to be a TRUE gamer!<br>
<br>
...CLACK CLACK CLACK CLACK CLACK... KA-CLICK!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Long Island：</span><br>
Oh my god... She only goes for headshots! And she never misses!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">{{AF|Yuubari}}：</span><br>
And she plays hunting games solo and without any gear... Then completes it without even taking any damage! How?!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Long Island：</span><br>
Nobody can beat her at simulators either! She always walks away at the top of the scoreboard!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">{{AF|Yuubari}}：</span><br>
She tried land, sea, and air combat... She played every military sim there is, and she conquered them all!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Long Island：</span><br>
Her gaming skills are elder god tier...! And whenever she has the chance, she sips some cola...!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">{{AF|Yuubari}}：</span><br>
Then she immediately reaches for a bag of chips... I've never seen such a fearsome playstyle before!<br>
<br>
...CLACK CLACK CLACK CLACK CLACK... KA-CLICK!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Vert：</span><br>
...Phew, that wasn't too bad.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Long Island：</span><br>
Miss... You're a god among peasants! A gaming god! All I can say is: wow...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">{{AF|Yuubari}}：</span><br>
I, too, admire you! You are the very god of gaming itself... You have descended from the heavens to grace us with your presence...!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Vert：</span><br>
Ohoho, don't be silly, now... I am a god, and a gamer, and a gaming god... But we are known as CPUs!<br>
I am number one! And nobody can beat me!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Long Island：</span><br>
Our god is a great god...! Let me bow before you!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Vert：</span><br>
Well, that's enough fooling around for now... Games are to be treasured, so now let's pick something we can play with several people. I'll give you some useful protips!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Long Island：</span><br>
You're the boss, boss! I'll pick out something we can play with several people at once.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">{{AF|Yuubari}}：</span><br>
Hum hum, if that's the plan, then it would be nice if we had a few more players...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Queen Elizabeth：</span><br>
So this is the Gamer Girl Grotto where commoners gather to play video games, I see!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Warspite：</span><br>
You'll have to excuse us. Her Majesty wished to see what this place is about...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">{{AF|Yuubari}}：</span><br>
...Oh, I guess we just got a few more players.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Queen Elizabeth：</span><br>
The Queen herself is here in person, so you'd better entertain me with a game worth my time! Preferably something highly enjoyable that I can win every round of!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Warspite：</span><br>
...I'm sorry, but can I ask you to go easy on Her Majesty for just the first few rounds?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Long Island：</span><br>
Sure, come on in~! We don't get visitors every day, so we'll have tons of fun. Let's all be social rejects together~!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Queen Elizabeth：</span><br>
That's what I was hoping to hear! I will make it known to the whole world that The Queen always wins! Now pick any game you want and I shall beat you at it!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">{{AF|Yuubari}}：</span><br>
I think there's a fallacy in there somewhere, but... Are you sure?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Vert：</span><br>
Oh my, oh my... It seems two adorable little girls have come my way... Maybe I should go all out, just for you~?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Queen Elizabeth：</span><br>
Who are you calling "little"?!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Warspite：</span><br>
I will not forgive you for calling me "little"...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">{{AF|Yuubari}}：</span><br>
Hey... That sounds exactly like something Ark Royal would say!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Long Island：</span><br>
Let's just move on to the games now~! I'm looking forward to having some multiplayer fun with you all~!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Vert：</span><br>
Indeed... As you said, you don't get a chance like this every day, so we should enjoy it to the fullest.<br>

<br>
Chapter 5 - Keep Quiet In The Library<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Blanc：</span><br>
...This must be the academy's library... It's huge. This many books is something worth getting excited about.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Z23：</span><br>
What do you think of the library, Blanc? Do you find it to be to your liking?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Blanc：</span><br>
Oh, hi, Z23... Yeah, I like this place. I think I'll be able to make good progress on my investigation.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Z23：</span><br>
That's all that matters. I take it you're interested in Mirror Seas and such?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Blanc：</span><br>
...That too, but after reading about this world's history and the way it came into existence... I think I've started to understand the connection this world has with Gamindustri...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Z23：</span><br>
I see... You must be a very enlightened individual, Blanc.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Blanc：</span><br>
...Don't compare Neptune or Vert to me. They have the intellectual capacity of a rock.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Z23：</span><br>
Ahaha... Well then, would you mind if I assisted you? If there happens to be any documents you skimmed past then you can tell me and I will go look for them.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Blanc：</span><br>
Sure, I'd love some help. Thanks, Z23...!<br>
W-wait, what is this...?!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Z23：</span><br>
Is something the matter, Blanc? ...Ah, that would appear to be the manga and novellas that Long Island and Ayanami bought on the internet.<br>
Although I do believe they refer to the novellas as "light novels"...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Blanc：</span><br>
...You'd never find genres, titles, plots, or art like this back in Gamindustri...!<br>
...I-I want to read them! All of them! From start to finish! I want them as references for my next book...! I don't care if I'll have to pull an all-nighter...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Z23：</span><br>
...Um, excuse me, but... Are you feeling okay, Blanc?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ranger：</span><br>
Oh, hello, Z23. What are you doing here?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Z23：</span><br>
Good day, Miss Ranger. I should be the one asking you! What are you doing here?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ranger：</span><br>
Hmm? Ah, you know, I was wondering if there might be any books I could use to teach the commander about leadership, so I went here to search for some... Ah, oh no!<br>
<br>
BA-THUMP, THUMP, THUMP!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Blanc：</span><br>
...Hey, you dropped your books. Let's see... "Sixty Shades of Grey"?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Z23：</span><br>
And these are... "An Echo on the Phone"? "Seduced by a Commander"?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ranger：</span><br>
I-it's not what it looks like! I was just... sorting some books and I happened to have these on me!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Blanc：</span><br>
...These are all romance stories...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Z23：</span><br>
...Miss Ranger?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ranger：</span><br>
D-don't look at me like that! ...I'm a teacher! I would never read a romance story! The thought of being together with the commander and doing stuff like this... h-has never even cross my mind!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Hermann Künne (Z19)：</span><br>
Good day, Miss Ranger. Is there a problem?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ranger：</span><br>
K-Künne?!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Hermann Künne (Z19)：</span><br>
You seem to be in possession of quite the number of books... If you don't mind, would you like me to help you carry them?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ranger：</span><br>
I-it's fine... I can carry them on my own... You should go look for the ones you came for...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Hermann Künne (Z19)：</span><br>
Not at all, I would like to help! I can't simply stand aside and watch you struggle with this many books!<br>
I'll carry these for you, will that be okay? By the way, what kind of subject are these textbooks intended for?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ranger：</span><br>
Umm, you see, they're not for any subject in…<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Hermann Künne (Z19)：</span><br>
The Devil Wears Nada and "Sax and the City"...? Your reference materials have some quite interesting titles!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ranger：</span><br>
Ahhh... Blanc, Z23, could you stop grinning at me and back me up here?!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Blanc：</span><br>
...Sorry. I couldn't help but find this situation funny.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Z23：</span><br>
Somehow I feel like I've seen a side of you very different from your usual self.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">{{AF|Souryuu}}：</span><br>
Why, for being a library, it's awfully lively in here... What did I miss?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Blanc：</span><br>
...We were just having fun teasing Ranger a little.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ranger：</span><br>
Blanc, please, have some mercy...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Z23：</span><br>
Are you here to borrow some books as well, Souryuu?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">{{AF|Souryuu}}：</span><br>
I am. I was thinking that I probably have to study a bit.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Hermann Künne (Z19)：</span><br>
A Teacher's Tips For Making Your Students Understand Better... "10 Tricks To Improve Your Students' Grades"... "How To Make Even Idiots Pay Attention In Class"... These reference materials are all intended for teachers...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ranger：</span><br>
So... does that make you Miss Souryuu?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">{{AF|Souryuu}}：</span><br>
What are you saying now, Ranger? ...Sigh, at this rate I'm actually going to become established as a teacher character...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Blanc：</span><br>
...Sure are a lot of teachers at this academy, huh?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Z23：</span><br>
You may be right... On that note, I too was once a teacher.<br>

<br>
Chapter 6 - Game Night With The Girls!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Neptune：</span><br>
And now I'd like to announce the first Annual Gaming Party as having officially begun!<br>
<br>
HOORAAAAAAAY! DA-DA-DADA<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Neptune：</span><br>
We bring you a hyperdimensional fusion of materials provided by Akashi, technical know-how provided by Yuubari, and game discs Noire brought with her from Gamindustri!<br>
We bring you... A hyperdimensional event! For the whole day, the academy will be one giant arcade! Now come, everyone! Play and enjoy yourselves to your heart's content!<br>
<br>
HOORAAAAAAAY! DA-DA-DADA<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">{{AF|Akashi}}：</span><br>
I didn't provide anything for free, nya. I will get my share of the profits you earn from this event down to the last cent. Capiche?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">{{AF|Yuubari}}：</span><br>
Hum hum, I'd never come across gaming technology from another dimension before... But now that I have, I can say it was an invigorating experience! Could I use these as reference for designing some new equipment?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Noire：</span><br>
W-well, it's only natural a CPU from Gamindustri would have some spare games on her... Ahahahaha... (Now I can't go and tell them I just happened to bring them with me...)<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Vert：</span><br>
It's all thanks to Noire that we'll be able to have so much fun today!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Neptune：</span><br>
You heard it, folks! This lady here who brought tons of the latest and greatest games is our MVP! A round of applause for the wonderful Noire! Clap clap clap!<br>
<br>
HOORAAAAAAAY! DA-DA-DADA!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Noire：</span><br>
Um, well, you know... Hahaha, this is just, um, how I roll as a CPU! Go on, enjoy yourselves today! It's all on me!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">{{AF|Ikazuchi}}：</span><br>
It's amazing they're able to hold an event as big as this... I see! Noire really knows her stuff! This must be why they call it "item management"!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">{{AF|Inazuma}}：</span><br>
I am amazed as well... After all, planning something is easy, but to realize it is not.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Noire：</span><br>
Well, Neptune was the one who proposed it, but halfway in she got bored and left everything to me. Who knows how poorly things could have gone if I wasn't here to take over...<br>
But still, I'm glad I get to make everyone happy.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Blanc：</span><br>
...I haven't seen you smile in a long time, Noire.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Noire：</span><br>
Did you say something, Blanc?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Blanc：</span><br>
...No, nothing... Now, Ranger and Künne, come along and I'll teach you the true joy of visual novels...<br>
...The literary nature of visual novels, how to read and analyze a story, how to make the right choices... I'll teach you everything there is to know...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ranger：</span><br>
We will follow your lead, Miss Blanc!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Hermann Künne (Z19)：</span><br>
We are as always thankful for your guidance, Miss Blanc!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Noire：</span><br>
Miss Blanc...? What have you been teaching them...?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Blanc：</span><br>
...Just some stuff from the library.<br>
<br>
BANG! BANG BANG! POW! BA-BOOOOM!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Long Island：</span><br>
Firefight, firepower, firefight, firepower... Ahh, I don't have enough ammo!<br>
Ayanami! You've gotta bring me some ammo, otherwise we're gonna lose!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">{{AF|Ayanami}}：</span><br>
You'll have to do something about that on your own... Things are only getting worse for me over here as well!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Vert：</span><br>
Ohoho... I see you have much to learn. You're both newbies, aren't you? Did you really think you could beat me in a tactical shooter?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">{{AF|Ayanami}}：</span><br>
...I guess you're really good at this after all, Vert...!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Long Island：</span><br>
It's a 2v1, we're supposed to have the advantage, so how come we're losing~?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Laffey：</span><br>
...Truth is, I've been on Vert's side all along.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Javelin：</span><br>
As have I!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Long Island：</span><br>
What?! No wonder your team's got better stats than we do! But that makes this a 3v2!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">{{AF|Ayanami}}：</span><br>
That's not fair! You play dirty, Vert...!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Vert：</span><br>
Hohoho... There are no rules in war. Also, deceiving the enemy could be thought of as a tactic. Perhaps you've learned something today.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">{{AF|Ayanami}}：</span><br>
I see... Then we will call for some reinforcements as well!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Z23：</span><br>
Indeed! Only a coward with no morals would stand by and watch! I will assist Ayanami and Long Island!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Long Island：</span><br>
What's more, now's the time to use the ace up our sleeves!<br>
<br>
KABOOOOOOOM!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Javelin：</span><br>
Eeeeek?! They've turned the tables on us, Vert!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Laffey：</span><br>
Now they have the same stas as us, and they made it a 3v3...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Vert：</span><br>
Oh dear, and in the blink of an eye we're not winning anymore. We're most likely going to lose.<br>
But... Some people play games precisely because they want a challenge, you know?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">{{AF|Ikazuchi}}：</span><br>
I see! So at this corner you do a four-wheel drift!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">{{AF|Inazuma}}：</span><br>
That was good, Ikazuchi. It seems you picked a model with good steering.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Neptune：</span><br>
What the heck! I picked the fastest car there is, so why can't I win?!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Noire：</span><br>
I think it's because you can't handle all that speed.<br>
In racing games, how well you can control your vehicle, how many shortcuts you can take, and going as fast as possible without going off course are more important than just going the fastest...<br>
And all you were doing was putting the pedal to the metal and crashing into things.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Neptune：</span><br>
Then I'll turn at the curve properly this... Nep?! I totaled my car again!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">{{AF|Ikazuchi}}：</span><br>
And while Nep-Nep's busy with that, I'm gonna slamdunk that finish line! It's victory lap time!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">{{AF|Inazuma}}：</span><br>
Bravo, Ikazuchi... I'm just behind you... It seems we will never lose first and second place. I think it's time for some victory champagne...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Neptune：</span><br>
You got me... But let's play one more round! Just one more! Come on, man<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Noire：</span><br>
You can try again all you want but you're just gonna lose every time.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Neptune：</span><br>
Nuh-uh, no way! I will win eventually as long as I keep trying!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Noire：</span><br>
If you're gonna be that way then fine. I guess I'll give you as much advice as I can, too.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Queen Elizabeth：</span><br>
You seem to be having quite the time! I permit you to accept me as a team member! Now let us play a game that will appease me!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Neptune：</span><br>
Sure thing, Lizzy! Whaddya wanna play?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Queen Elizabeth：</span><br>
A game brimming with elegance fit for a queen as myself, of course! And you will prepare the very best that will satisfy me! Understood?!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Warspite：</span><br>
Her Majesty seems to have become interested in games as of late... If you don't mind, may I ask you to let us play with you?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Noire：</span><br>
No probs, you guys are welcome any time. Whaddya wanna play, O Spite of War?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Warspite：</span><br>
Spite of War...? Well, whatever... Hmm, let's see... I'd like to try a war game. As in, a game teeming with violence in a battle to the death... Do you have anything like that?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Noire：</span><br>
Then maybe what you want is a fighting game or action game? They're pretty realistic.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Warspite：</span><br>
You do? In that case... I would love to try one of those!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Queen Elizabeth：</span><br>
Hahaha... This is my chance to show you the tricks I've learned at the Gamer Club! Warspite, fetch me a bottle of soda and a bag of crisps at once!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Warspite：</span><br>
Your Majesty, those are not required in order to play video games...<br>

<br>
Chapter 7 - Well Then, Buh-Bye!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Histoire：</span><br>
...Now then, while I totally didn't expect you all to just sit around and play games all day, it seems you did investigate as I told you to. You have done well.<br>
Thanks to your investigation I was able to understand the gist of what the connection is between Gamindustri and this other world. From now on you should be able to access this world whenever you want.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Neptune：</span><br>
Woo-hoo! I knew you could do it, Histy! So then... can we just stay here forever?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Blanc：</span><br>
...What are you on about? We obviously can't do that.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Vert：</span><br>
She's right. Gamindustri won't last very long without us CPUs to watch over it.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Histoire：</span><br>
Vert is correct. You can all return here whenever you want, so please, all of you come back to Gamindustri at once. And that includes you, Neptune.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Neptune：</span><br>
Sigh Being a big-shot CPU loved by everyone sure is tough... Fiiiine, I'll come back home.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Noire：</span><br>
For a while I had no idea how we'd manage in this world... But we did, somehow. We couldn't have done it alone though. Thank you for helping us out so much, everyone.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Neptune：</span><br>
Yeah! Thank you, Laffey, Javelin, Ayanami, Z23... And everyone else here at the academy! We owe you, big time!<br>
Also... It was tons of fun hanging out with you guys!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Laffey：</span><br>
Yeah... It was really fun.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Javelin：</span><br>
I had a great time too. I'd love to have another exciting discussion about games with you, Nep-Nep.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Neptune：</span><br>
Oh, you wanna do that? Stay up all night talking about games, again?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Blanc：</span><br>
...We don't have time for that. We gotta get going.<br>

Leaving Gamindustri without CPUs for too long isn't very good.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Z23：</span><br>
Though it pains us all... I suppose you must leave now...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">{{AF|Ayanami}}：</span><br>
Just after we'd all become such close friends... It's a shame.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Noire：</span><br>
Yeah, I don't want to leave either... But I've got Lastation to take care of, and I promise we'll meet again.<br>
Thank you, Z23 and Ayanami. I'm glad I got the chance to meet you.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Neptune：</span><br>
Come on, guys... Let's just stay one more night while we're still here! I've gotten hooked on Oxy-Cola and Torpedo Tempura... And I need my daily dose!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Javelin：</span><br>
Oh, right! I packed some lunch for you, Nep-Nep. I filled it with Torpedo Tempura just for you. I hope you'll like it!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Neptune：</span><br>
Wowzers! Thanks, Javelin! Holy moley, there's like a dozen Oxy-colas in here! We could all have 3 each!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Noire：</span><br>
Uh, yeah... You can have mine, Neptune.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Z23：</span><br>
You can't quite drink them, I see... They're intended for consumption by shipgirls only, not even our commander can handle drinking them.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">{{AF|Ayanami}}：</span><br>
...But I remember Nep-Nep downing a whole bottle. Maybe she has the same taste as we do?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Histoire：</span><br>
Now then, CPUs, please line up in front of the wormhole and prepare to jump into it.<br>
I can't simply leave an inter-dimensional wormhole open here, so once you're done saying goodbye, I will close it for the time being.<br>
When you have business in this world, I can open it again, so you don't need to worry about that.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Noire：</span><br>
Yeah, I guess you're right... Z23, Ayanami, thank you once again. We all had our ups and downs, but I enjoyed myself too.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Z23：</span><br>
I couldn't agree more. There are no words to express my gratitude. Thank you for everything, Noire.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">{{AF|Ayanami}}：</span><br>
I had fun too. Sayonara, Noire.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Vert：</span><br>
Mutsuki, Kisaragi, Uzuki... I'll be back before you know it! And I'll bring you girls more candy than you could ever dream of!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">{{AF|Mutsuki}}：</span><br>
Okay, Vert! I'm gonna dream of tons of candy while you're gone!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">{{AF|Kisaragi}}：</span><br>
We'll be waiting... Bye bye, Vert!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">{{AF|Uzuki}}：</span><br>
Bye byyyyeee!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Vert：</span><br>
Ahhh... You're all so lovely! I wish I didn't have to return home!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Blanc：</span><br>
Sigh... I don't either, I've barely even started on reading the books from this world... I could never get bored of talking with Künne either... <br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ranger：</span><br>
We'll wait for you as long as it takes, Miss Blanc...!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Hermann Künne (Z19)：</span><br>
I will patiently wait for your glorious return, Miss Blanc!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Z23：</span><br>
It seems we all got to know each other and now nobody wants you to leave....<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Noire：</span><br>
Haha, yeah, it seems so... For better or worse, you've helped us increase our shares as well, so we should be able to remain active in this world unhindered.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Neptune：</span><br>
You deserve my thanks too, Laffey and Javelin! I promise we'll be back, in one way or another! Let's meet again sometime!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Noire：</span><br>
Hey, don't say anything that'll make them expect too much.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Vert：</span><br>
This journey of ours was quite an extraordinary experience...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Blanc：</span><br>
...Hearing that raises a bunch of warning flags in my head.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Laffey：</span><br>
Yeah... I'll be waiting for your return, Nep-Nep.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Javelin：</span><br>
As will I! I hope you'll still have fun back home in Gamindustri...!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Neptune：</span><br>
I will. Thanks! I'm always finding ways to have fun no matter where I am, so don't worry! And I promise I'll be back to have even more fun with you guys... So just wait for me until then!<br>
Well then, buh-bye!<br>
