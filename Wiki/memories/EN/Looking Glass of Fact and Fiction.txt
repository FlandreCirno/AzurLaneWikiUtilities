<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ookami Mio：</span><br>
All around me are those familiar walls, that familiar ceiling<br>
Not long ago it was bustling in here, but now I am the only one here<br>
My mind knows I must search for my missing friends and get a hold of the situation<br>
But my body trembles with fear, my instincts warning me that this place is dangerous<br>
I need to compose myself...<br>
Calm down! Calm! Yourself! Down!<br>
<br>
BOOOOOM!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ookami Mio：</span><br>
I can't! I can't do it! How's anyone supposed to calm down with this going on around them?!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Shirakami Fubuki：</span><br>
Mio? Is that you there?!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ookami Mio：</span><br>
Fubuki?! Thank the algorithm you're okay!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Shirakami Fubuki：</span><br>
We need to get out of here. Mass-produced Siren ships are coming our way!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ookami Mio：</span><br>
Si... rens?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Shirakami Fubuki：</span><br>
Hold on... They sound like destroyers, based on those explosions. It's probably just a vanguard fleet. The main fleet must be behind them.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ookami Mio：</span><br>
You're... keeping your cool surprisingly well... Wait, what did you say? A fleet? Whaddya mean "fleet"?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Shirakami Fubuki：</span><br>
Calm down, Mio. There are Siren fleets around us as far as the eye can see...<br>
I'm surmising that, for whatever reason, we and the rest of the Hololive Server got transported to the world of Azur Lane. Smack-dab in the middle of a battle, too...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ookami Mio：</span><br>
So by Sirens, you mean... Those time-travelers that invaded the world of Azur Lane?!<br>
Never mind that, we've been sent to another world! How the heck do we get back?!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Shirakami Fubuki：</span><br>
Dammit... If I only had my own fleet with me, this would be a piece of cake!<br>
If only Kawakaze and Zuikaku were here...<br>

<br>
The search for truth<br>
The longing for the future<br>
The reflection that is there, but always out of reach<br>
Our battles with destiny most oft end in much the same way <br>
Its outcome, as expected<br>
What is real? What is false?<br>
All that remains is a small mystery<br>
So let the tale be told<br>
Will you, perhaps, solve the mystery?<br>
Noon - Within the Route Escort Fleet<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Zuikaku：</span><br>
Another commission completed without a hitch!<br>
Nice breeze, calm waves, nice weather all around. I can't wait to get home and take a nap in the sun!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Kawakaze：</span><br>
……<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Zuikaku：</span><br>
Something wrong, Kawakaze? You're being awfully quiet.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Kawakaze：</span><br>
Oh, it's nothing... I was just thinking about my sword. It'll surely start rusting if they continue giving us nothing but escort missions.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Zuikaku：</span><br>
I don't mind getting a break from the action. Plus, it's an important job, and someone's gotta do it.<br>
Speaking of breaks, you need to start letting up that poker face if you hope to make friends. Come on, let's see a smile!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Kawakaze：</span><br>
Uh, Zuikaku, look ahead...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Zuikaku：</span><br>
... What the heck is that...?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Kawakaze：</span><br>
It appears to be fog... but there's more to it than that.<br>
My gauges indicate the humidity levels and water temperature in the area are changing rapidly. There also seems to be an island coming into view in the distance.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Zuikaku：</span><br>
All signs point toward this being a Mirror Sea. Come on, Sirens! Can't you at least once let us return home in peace?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Kawakaze：</span><br>
Detecting numerous mass-produced Siren vessels heading in our direction.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Zuikaku：</span><br>
Kawakaze, you watch the front. I'll scramble my planes in the meanwhile so we can take out the Sirens!<br>
{{折叠面板|内容结束}}

{{折叠面板|标题=The Dense Fog|选项=3|主框=1|样式=primary|展开=否}}
<br>
After a few quick skirmishes, the Sirens' reinforcements ceased coming, and the sea turned still once more.<br>
As the two searched for a way to exit the Mirror Sea, the fog before their eyes cleared up almost as quickly as when it formed.<br>
It's almost like the fog itself is a part of the abnormal weather within the Mirror Sea.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Zuikaku：</span><br>
What in the world...?!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Kawakaze：</span><br>
Looks like we aren't out of the Mirror Sea yet...<br>
<br>
Countless islands appeared before them, and massive artificial structures rose high up above in the far distance.<br>
Upon closer inspection, the islands' flora and the structures appear to be made out of innumerable blocks.<br>
It all looks like a poor replica of the real world in their eyes.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Zuikaku：</span><br>
The Sirens' technology never ceases to amaze...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Kawakaze：</span><br>
Zuikaku, the weather around us just changed again. It's looking like we'll need to explore the area to find a way out.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Zuikaku：</span><br>
I mean, that was pretty obvious to me from the moment we wandered in here.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Kawakaze：</span><br>
... You're not afraid of what might happen?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Zuikaku：</span><br>
It's fine, we'll get outta here sooner or later. We don't achieve anything by worrying about what we don't know.<br>
And while we're here, might as well investigate to see what the Sirens are planning!<br>

<span style="color:#4eb24e;">？？？：</span><br>
AAAAAHHH!<br>
HELP! SOMEBODY HEEEEELP!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Zuikaku：</span><br>
I hear... someone screaming for help!<br>
Kawakaze, we're not the only ones trapped in here!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Kawakaze：</span><br>
Understood! I'm counting on your aerial support while I go investigate!<br>

<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ookami Mio：</span><br>
*Pant*... *Pant*... Fubuki, just leave me... I can't take another step…<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Shirakami Fubuki：</span><br>
No, Mio! Don't stop there, you'll–<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ookami Mio：</span><br>
AAAAAHHH!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Shirakami Fubuki：</span><br>
... get shot by the Sirens...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ookami Mio：</span><br>
You've gotta come up with something and help! I don't wanna die here!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Shirakami Fubuki：</span><br>
We're outnumbered and outgunned... This is looking bleak.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ookami Mio：</span><br>
Focus, Fubuki! We can't just give up!<br>
<br>
The Sirens' aircraft release their payloads over the fleeing girls.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Shirakami Fubuki：</span><br>
Mio, I'm glad I at least get to spend my final moments with–<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Kawakaze：</span><br>
Nobody's dying on my watch! I'll take care of them, so just stay out of danger!<br>

{{折叠面板|标题=Visitors from Another World|选项=6|主框=1|样式=primary|展开=否}}
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Kawakaze：</span><br>
Were either of you hurt?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Shirakami Fubuki：</span><br>
Oh... Oh my God! It's you! It's really you, Kawakaze!<br>
Look, Mio! It's the real Kawakaze!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ookami Mio：</span><br>
... What? I don't even get what just happened... But I guess we're saved now?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Shirakami Fubuki：</span><br>
Squeeee! Look! Those cool eyes, that slender body, that fluffy tail! It's Kawakaze, in the flesh!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ookami Mio：</span><br>
Calm down, Fubuki. You're making her uncomfortable.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Zuikaku：</span><br>
So here you were. Glad to see you're both all right.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Shirakami Fubuki：</span><br>
You're here too, Zuikaku?!<br>
Sorry, where are my manners... Ahem, thank you for saving us when we were in danger.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Zuikaku：</span><br>
You don't have any rigging from what I can see... But you've got cat ears and know our names... Are you from the Sakura Empire, by any chance?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Shirakami Fubuki：</span><br>
Cat ears?! Excuse me, can't you see my tail? I'm a fox!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Zuikaku：</span><br>
Oh, a fox? S-sorry!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Shirakami Fubuki：</span><br>
It's no biggie. Anyway... I'm Shirakami Fubuki, the white-haired, animal-eared high-schooler working with Hololive. Many people mistake me for a cat, but I'm 100% a fox!<br>
As for the reason why I know your names, well, that's a long story...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ookami Mio：</span><br>
And I'm Ookami Mio, I also work with Hololive. I'm one of the Hologamers, if you want to be specific. Just call me Mio.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Zuikaku：</span><br>
"Hololive"? Sounds like an organization, I guess...<br>
I'm Zuikaku, Shoukaku-class aircraft carrier. And this is Kawakaze, Shiratsuyu-class destroyer.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Shirakami Fubuki：</span><br>
Mhm, I know all about you. I made oaths with both of you, so how could I forget~<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Kawakaze：</span><br>
... I don't understand what you're talking about.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Zuikaku：</span><br>
Seeing as you're unarmed, I assume you're civilians? Did you get caught in the bad weather?<br>
This area's turned into a Mirror Sea and become infested with Sirens. It's really dangerous here, so you should stay close to us.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Shirakami Fubuki：</span><br>
I honestly don't know how or why we ended up here... But I can say this place looks familiar.<br>
As far as I can tell, this is the Hololive Server, or at least it was made to closely resemble it.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Kawakaze：</span><br>
Hololive... server...?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Shirakami Fubuki：</span><br>
Basically, it's like a secret base of ours. We often bring our friends here to build stuff or hang out.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Zuikaku：</span><br>
A secret base? But there was never anything in this area prior to this...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Shirakami Fubuki：</span><br>
We were just building stuff like usual, then this blinding light appeared outta nowhere... Next thing we know, a Siren fleet is attacking us, and our friends are nowhere to be seen...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Kawakaze：</span><br>
... That sounds familiar.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Zuikaku：</span><br>
I don't watch much TV, but isn't this like that "isekai anime" trope Ikazuchi mentioned before?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ookami Mio：</span><br>
You know about that?!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Zuikaku：</span><br>
Meh, wouldn't be the first time it's happened, so I get the gist of it.<br>
Since you know our names, I can only assume we knew each other in the world you came from.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Shirakami Fubuki：</span><br>
Hah-hah! I know a lot about Azur Lane, in fact!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Kawakaze：</span><br>
This is giving me deja vu.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Zuikaku：</span><br>
So from what I gather, the Sirens took us all to this place, which for some reason resembles your hideout before they took you here. Right?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Shirakami Fubuki：</span><br>
Yeah, I guess so.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ookami Mio：</span><br>
Fubuki, this'll take ages to explain, so how about we head to the safe house for now?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Zuikaku：</span><br>
Safe house? What?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Shirakami Fubuki：</span><br>
The place where we hid before we got taken here. Follow us and we'll take you there!<br>

<span style="color:#4eb24e;">{{AF|Zuikaku}}&{{AF|Kawakaze}}：</span><br>
The what? The "Hololive Resistance Base"?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Shirakami Fubuki：</span><br>
You heard right! It's a place we made before we got transported here, and it somehow carried over. We've got plenty of items stocked, and might be able to resupply you with ammo and stuff!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Zuikaku：</span><br>
In other words, there's a high chance this place is a recreation of the world you came from?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Shirakami Fubuki：</span><br>
Yup, yup. You can see everything from here, including the Hololive headquarters and most other Hololive Server facilities.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Zuikaku：</span><br>
Company headquarters, resistance bases... It's starting to sound like you come from a pretty brutal world.<br>
"In a world where a tyrannical company rules over everyone... One group of Hololivers risk everything in their fight against evil... They are... the Resistance!" ... Something like that?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Kawakaze：</span><br>
Wherever they're from, it sounds like they're fighting a war.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Shirakami Fubuki：</span><br>
Uh... not really? I mean, you're not completely wrong, but...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ookami Mio：</span><br>
Let's just give them a straight answer, Fubuki.<br>
Basically, one of our friends made this place to get back at our managers. Hololive is just a fun group of people, we're not at war with anyone!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Zuikaku：</span><br>
Okay, so if I got it right: you're from a world called Hololive, and live in a place called the Hololive Server, and you like to screw with your kind-of-evil managers?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ookami Mio：</span><br>
More or less.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Shirakami Fubuki：</span><br>
Now that I look closer... This entire sector of the ocean has become part of the Hololive Server, but the original area has been spread out across all these islands.<br>
Luckily, most of the buildings are intact, so we'll surely find the Resistance base if we follow them.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Zuikaku：</span><br>
All right, Hololive Guide, lead the way. We can start hatching a plan once we've made it to your base.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Shirakami Fubuki：</span><br>
(Guide...? Excuse me?)<br>

<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Kawakaze：</span><br>
I see traces of a battle took that place in this area.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Zuikaku：</span><br>
Siren wrecks littering the place... I guess we're not the only ones fighting them.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Kawakaze：</span><br>
There are signs that both torpedoes and cannons were used. Zuikaku, what do you suggest we do?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Zuikaku：</span><br>
Our goal is to get these Hololive girls to a safe place, though that would be easier if we can group up with some allies... I think the answer's obvious.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Kawakaze：</span><br>
Okay. We'll follow the tracks and investigate.<br>

<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Natsuiro Matsuri：</span><br>
Hey, Javelin, let's go on a date once all the fighting is over!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Javelin：</span><br>
Matsuri, you silly~ I'm not falling for a pickup line like that!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Natsuiro Matsuri：</span><br>
Turned down without a moment's delay... But that's what's so attractive about you!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Javelin：</span><br>
Oh gosh~! Your flexible preferences in girls is starting to scare me~!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Kawakaze：</span><br>
I see Javelin over there. Someone's with her...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Shirakami Fubuki：</span><br>
Let me guess, it's Lady Thirstsalot...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Kawakaze：</span><br>
Do you know her?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Shirakami Fubuki：</span><br>
I wish I could say I don't. She's, uhh... unusual.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ookami Mio：</span><br>
Man, I don't get what goes through Fubuki's mind. Whatever, let's go help them out!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Zuikaku：</span><br>
You got it! Come on, Kawakaze!<br>
{{折叠面板|内容结束}}

{{折叠面板|标题=Vestiges of Battle|选项=10|主框=1|样式=primary|展开=否}}
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Kawakaze：</span><br>
How did you get here, Javelin?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Javelin：</span><br>
We were on our way back from a commission when suddenly this fog appeared out of nowhere, and suddenly we found ourselves inside a Mirror Sea...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Zuikaku：</span><br>
Were there any others in your fleet?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Javelin：</span><br>
Yeah, there were. Ayanami, Laffey, and Z23 were with me.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Zuikaku：</span><br>
We'd better go looking for them then...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Natsuiro Matsuri：</span><br>
Fubuki! Mio! I'm so relieved to see you're okay!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Shirakami Fubuki：</span><br>
Likewiiiise. I don't know what I would've pooooossibly done if you'd gotten huuuurt. God forbiiiid.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Natsuiro Matsuri：</span><br>
Let me introduce you to my new friend: Javelin!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Kawakaze：</span><br>
Are you a Hololive character too?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Natsuiro Matsuri：</span><br>
Yup. I'm Hololive's pure and innocent highschool girl – Natsuiro Matsuri!<br>
And you're Kawakaze, aren't you? I've heard about you before! Listen, I've got a bucket list to check off, so would you mind if I stroked your tail? And could I get a hug? Can we go on a date after?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Kawakaze：</span><br>
... If you're from the same place as this Shirakami Fubuki, where did you get your rigging from?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Natsuiro Matsuri：</span><br>
Oh, you mean my shooty bang bang stuff? I got it from Purity!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Zuikaku：</span><br>
Purity? Who's that?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Natsuiro Matsuri：</span><br>
She's this nice girl in spats who rescued me and Aqua when we were in trouble. She even made us some gear to defend ourselves with!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Zuikaku：</span><br>
Purity... A girl in spats... Wait, it can't be...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Natsuiro Matsuri：</span><br>
You know what "can't be"? How pretty she is! You should see her!<br>
She and Aqua stayed behind at the Resistance base to strengthen its defenses while Javelin and I went out to look for people.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Javelin：</span><br>
Matsuri's mostly right, but there's a bit more to it... We should probably go back to the base for now.<br>
{{折叠面板|内容结束}}

{{折叠面板|标题=The Resistance Base|选项=11|主框=1|样式=primary|展开=否}}
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Natsuiro Matsuri：</span><br>
See that building over there made of sparkling obsidian? That's our base.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Zuikaku：</span><br>
How'd you get artillery up there?! This is way beyond the definition of "base," it's a straight-up fort...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Natsuiro Matsuri：</span><br>
Actually, everything above ground is just a decoy, the real base is hidden underwater. You can only enter through a secret entrance, so follow me.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Kawakaze：</span><br>
The structure above ground draws attention away from the true fortification below ground... Now I see why you call it a secret base.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Shirakami Fubuki：</span><br>
I'm honestly amazed that Aqua's and Matsuri's base would come in handy one day. As that one guy said, life's like a box of chocolates.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Natsuiro Matsuri：</span><br>
Alright everyone, take a deep breath and follow me~<br>
{{折叠面板|内容结束}}

{{折叠面板|标题=Purity?!|选项=12|主框=1|样式=primary|展开=否}}
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Natsuiro Matsuri：</span><br>
Captain, we're home~ How're things going?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Minato Aqua：</span><br>
Hey, Matsuri! You were gone for so long I was starting to worry. Nice to see Fubuki and Mio made it in one piece!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Purity：</span><br>
Look at that, Matsuri's back! Good timing, we just finished testing Aqua's rigging. Oh, guessing you brought some friends with you?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Natsuiro Matsuri：</span><br>
Sure did! This here's Shirakami Fubuki, and this is Ookami Mio.<br>
And then the girls who got them out of a tight situation: Kawakaze and Zuikaku. The Resistance grows stronger!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Purity：</span><br>
Welcome aboard, folks! We've got fun and games!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Zuikaku：</span><br>
You... I remember you, Purifier!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Kawakaze：</span><br>
I can take your head in the blink of an eye at this range!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Javelin：</span><br>
Wait, wait, WAIT! Calm down, you two!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Kawakaze：</span><br>
What, Javelin?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Zuikaku：</span><br>
Purifier's... lost her memories?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Javelin：</span><br>
Yeah. I was pretty shocked too when she came in and blew up all the mass-produced Sirens attacking us...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Purity：</span><br>
Then I went and saved Aqua and Matsuri and brought them here.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Zuikaku：</span><br>
... You're not pretending to be on our side, are you?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Kawakaze：</span><br>
She's a Siren. After all the Sirens have done, I'm not going to simply take her word for it.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Natsuiro Matsuri：</span><br>
You have to believe us! Purity would never hurt anyone! You must be confusing her for someone else who looks like her!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Javelin：</span><br>
I couldn't believe it at first either, but Purifi– I mean, Purity really did save us, and she's on our side...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Purity：</span><br>
Uhh, have I horribly wronged some of you in the past? I mean, if you want us to prove our allegiance, I can go out back and commit double suicide with Tessy. We can always get new bodies.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Zuikaku：</span><br>
Who's "Tessy"? Wait... Tester's here too?!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Javelin：</span><br>
Yup... Anyway, we need to come up with a plan for what to do next.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Kawakaze：</span><br>
I'll stay with Purifi– Purity, and keep an eye on her.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Javelin：</span><br>
Thank you, Kawakaze!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Kawakaze：</span><br>
These are abnormal circumstances, and I'm willing to accept abnormal things within reason. But don't get careless, Javelin.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ookami Mio：</span><br>
Phew, you had me spooked for a second there, Kawakaze... So, all friends here, yeah?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Kawakaze：</span><br>
No, this is merely a ceasefire. I'm– Hey, stop that! Why are you measuring them, Purifier?!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Purity：</span><br>
Uh, so I can make them some rigging too? Surely getting more people equipped to search for their friends is more important than keeping their 3 measurements a secret?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Kawakaze：</span><br>
Search for their friends? There are more than just Fubuki, Mio, Aqua, and Matsuri?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Shirakami Fubuki：</span><br>
We still haven't found Ayame, Shion, or Miss Sora yet. Wherever they are, I hope they're okay.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Natsuiro Matsuri：</span><br>
Ayame has her demon powers and Shion can use magic, so they're probably fine. Miss Sora, on the other hand... Well, it's Miss Sora, I'm sure she can manage!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Zuikaku：</span><br>
Maybe they can, but we're not gonna just leave them to fend for themselves out there.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Purity：</span><br>
Sounds like a plan! You girls with riggings go out and look for the last three while yours truly stays behind. Somebody's gotta kit out Fubuki and Mio, after all.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ookami Mio：</span><br>
This could end up becoming a drawn-out battle, so we should probably try to collect resources when we can...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Minato Aqua：</span><br>
Gathering resources is my middle name! Leave it to Lady Aqua~<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Javelin：</span><br>
You girls should take a break, and I'll prepare you some hefty lunches in the meanwhile.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Natsuiro Matsuri：</span><br>
Aww, you're so sweet, Javelin. You'll make a lovely wife one day...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Shirakami Fubuki：</span><br>
(Once we're back home, I'd better get the rest of the gang to play AL. For now though, time to rest...)<br>

<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Natsuiro Matsuri：</span><br>
Wow, this rigging is amazing! I never expected weapons this powerful to be so easy to control!<br>
With OP gear like this, even a pure and delicate girl like me can become a ganking queen at the drop of a hat!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Kawakaze：</span><br>
(The rigging Purity made doesn't function the same way as ours...)<br>
(Even then, you can't simply equip a ship's rigging and master its use immediately. The Mirror Sea must be affecting her somehow.)<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Natsuiro Matsuri：</span><br>
Anyway, now I have the power to protect my friends! Hooray!<br>
Oh yeah, why can't we just get riggings for everyone then face the Sirens head-on?<br>
They might have numbers, but we're way stronger. We'd beat them in the blink of an eye.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Kawakaze：</span><br>
There is some truth to that, but reality isn't so simple.<br>
Besides... a world where any random person can pick up arms and go to war is destined to fall to ruin.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Natsuiro Matsuri：</span><br>
Wowie! Kawakaze: cute on the outside, cool on the inside! There's an audience for characters like that, you know!<br>
I can't pull that off, though. I don't know much about your world, and I'm not much of a fighter either, so sorry if I say anything that sounds weird!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Kawakaze：</span><br>
You don't know how to fight? I thought you're part of the Resistance?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Natsuiro Matsuri：</span><br>
I've fought a few times before! Just not, you know, like this. Ahahaha~<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Kawakaze：</span><br>
What a strange place you come from...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Natsuiro Matsuri：</span><br>
Aww, don't be like that! Experience is still experience!<br>

{{折叠面板|标题=TNT?!|选项=14|主框=1|样式=primary|展开=否}}
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Natsuiro Matsuri：</span><br>
That white building is the Holomart. We store all our tools and stuff in there, so it's the best place to start if we wanna get resources.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Kawakaze：</span><br>
Actually, I have a question about these supplies...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Minato Aqua：</span><br>
Whoopsie, I never formally introduced myself!<br>
It's nice to meet you (again.) I'm Minato Aqua, Hololive's local virtual maid!<br>
But just because I'm maid doesn't mean I'm good at housekeeping, that's a stereotype! Video games, however, you bet I am!!!!!<br>
Not much makes sense in this world I've been thrust into, but I can tell you what I DO know!<br>
We kept water, food, and medicine stockpiled in our hideout back in the Hololive Server, which have all carried over, but for some reason we've also got ammunition that conveniently works with our riggings just lying around!<br>
That, and blocks of TNT. They work slightly differently compared to back on the Hololive Server, but they still explode just as well!<br>
Back then I figured I'd need them at some point, so I hid stores of them all over the place, although I'm not sure if they're still there...<br>
Anyhoo, this place you call a "Mirror Sea" seems to be similar to the Hololive Server in a lot of ways!<br>
And since blocks of TNT are the most powerful item available on the Hololive Server, I suggest you collect as much of it as you can!!!!!!!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Kawakaze：</span><br>
From what I understand based on Fubuki's explanation, Hololive is a talent agency that recruits and oversees "Vtubers," as she called them.<br>
So, if you are performers of some sort, why do you have massive amounts of TNT lying around?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Natsuiro Matsuri：</span><br>
"Talent agency"... I mean...<br>
Don't worry about the TNT too much, just think of it as an everyday item! We need it to construct buildings, you see.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Kawakaze：</span><br>
You build houses out of dynamite...? What a peaceful world you come from if explosives make the foundations of your buildings...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Natsuiro Matsuri：</span><br>
Uhh... sure! Let's not worry about the details and just focus on the big picture!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Kawakaze：</span><br>
But, if we're to collect this TNT as we supposedly should, we'll need to clear out the Sirens in the area first.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Natsuiro Matsuri：</span><br>
That's easy peasy~ Let's rev up our engines and do it!<br>

Hold, Matsuri. I'm receiving a message from Zuikaku.<br>
Siren aircraft are bombing "a giant wooden castle." Target is believed to be one of the Hololivers. Heading there to provide support.<br>
... End of transmission. Seems we've located one of your friends.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Natsuiro Matsuri：</span><br>
Giant wooden castle...? Wait, that sounds like... Nakiri Castle! Ayame should be there! We'd better go help her!<br>
{{折叠面板|内容结束}}

{{折叠面板|标题=Nakiri Castle|选项=16|主框=1|样式=primary|展开=否}}
<br>
On the horizon – across the many islands scattered about the Mirror Sea – sits an isolated castle. Its structure wooden, its surroundings silent.<br>
Its purpose, unclear. Perhaps to defend a strategic position, or symbolize its owner's control over the area.<br>
Regardless, the Sirens have their destructive eyes fixated upon it.<br>
And soon, it might fall to ruin by their hand.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Murasaki Shion：</span><br>
I thought we'd be safe in your castle, but it seems I've been proven wrong...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Nakiri Ayame：</span><br>
Ay only come to this server to build things! Why must such wanton destruction befall my creations?!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Laffey：</span><br>
The Sirens are behind this...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Murasaki Shion：</span><br>
Sirens...? You mean the ones from that game Fubuki plays?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Nakiri Ayame：</span><br>
Are you saying that this is a video game world?!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Murasaki Shion：</span><br>
We need to get out of here! Ayame, why would you make a castle this big without constructing a secret escape route?!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Nakiri Ayame：</span><br>
Twas designed with everyday activities in mind! 'Tis for raising animals, growing crops, and lounging around!<br>
Ay never suspected a siege to happen, much less there be a need for a hidden passage!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Murasaki Shion：</span><br>
Welp... We're screwed, then.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ayanami：</span><br>
It's okay. I can take care of the Sirens.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Murasaki Shion：</span><br>
Excuse me?! You two against an army?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Nakiri Ayame：</span><br>
Well said! Ay shall join them! These "Sirens" shall learn the sharpness of my blades!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ayanami：</span><br>
It's too dangerous for you. You don't have any rigging.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Laffey：</span><br>
Shion, Ayame, you're not trained to fight. Ayanami and I can do it.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Murasaki Shion：</span><br>
B-but...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ayanami：</span><br>
You don't need to worry. We're experienced with fighting them.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Laffey：</span><br>
Dunno why, but they have a lot of carriers... That works in our favor.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ayanami：</span><br>
Yes. If we can launch a surprise attack on them, it will be easy!<br>

<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Kawakaze：</span><br>
In essence.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Natsuiro Matsuri：</span><br>
Then you've got awesome friends! Look at them fighting carriers many times their size without any hesitation!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Kawakaze：</span><br>
I've never seen a Siren fleet composed only of carriers and no backup. This Mirror Sea is making them behave differently...<br>
No matter, we must take care of them. Matsuri, I'll need your support.<br>

Aww, don't cry, Shion. Everything's fine now. You were really brave, weren't you...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Nakiri Ayame：</span><br>
We wouldn't have made it here were it not for your help, Ayanami and Laffey. You have my gratitude.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ayanami：</span><br>
Don't thank us. We couldn't stand by and do nothing.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Laffey：</span><br>
The Sirens are our enemy...<br>

Now that we've found you two, only one left to find is Miss Sora.<br>

Don't be sad, Ayame! Once the fighting's over, we can build a new one, with blackjack and booze! We have the technology!<br>

We shall! And this time, Ay will make sure to build a hidden passage!<br>

Hold on a second, Aqua, I think you may have things backwards!<br>
I'm pretty sure Fubuki once told me those Sirens behind you are the enemy in Azur Lane, not this girl.<br>

You're mistaken, Miss Sora. I will explain everything after I've dealt with this one.<br>

... It sounds like Kawakaze has managed to group up with Nakiri and Shion.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Minato Aqua：</span><br>
Great to hear! Though we still don't know where Miss Sora is...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Zuikaku：</span><br>
I'm just wondering: is she particularly famous? You don't seem to address anyone else in your group with "Miss," so...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Minato Aqua：</span><br>
That's because she was one of the first members of Hololive! And since we joined later and she always looks after us, we give her that bit of extra respect.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Zuikaku：</span><br>
Like how I respect my sister Shoukaku... Although she can be kind of mean from time to time.<br>
Hm? My recon planes have found a familiar face! Let's see...<br>
Z23, and... Huh? Aqua?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Minato Aqua：</span><br>
It's found me?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Zuikaku：</span><br>
Apparently. At least someone who looks like you. There's someone else there with brown hair!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Minato Aqua：</span><br>
That has to be Sora! But why am I there? That's impossible!!!<br>

Hmm, isn't this Shirakami Shrine, a.k.a. Fubuki's place? Ah, there she is! I see her!<br>
Sora, over here!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Tokino Sora：</span><br>
Huh? Aqua? But you're over here, and over there... why are there multiple Aquas?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Z23：</span><br>
Sora, look out! That maid is an imposter created by the Sirens!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Minato Aqua：</span><br>
Nuh-uh, she's the imposter! Look, Sora, I'm the real one!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Tokino Sora：</span><br>
Wh-whaaat?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Javelin：</span><br>
The Sirens have already made a copy of Aqua?!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Minato Aqua：</span><br>
A... copy?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Zuikaku：</span><br>
The Sirens can make clones out of anyone that enters waters they control, like a mirror reflection of them. That's why they're called Mirror Seas.<br>
But the clones only LOOK like someone else, and still follow the Sirens' orders. Just knock 'em down like bowling pins!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Z23：</span><br>
Zuikaku, there's more to it! That Aqua clone is different!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Zuikaku：</span><br>
What...?<br>
<span style="color:#ec5d53;">Yamada Hermione：</span><br>
Hahahah... My name is Yamada Hermione. I have awaited your arrival, as per orders of my master, the ruler of time and space.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Zuikaku：</span><br>
"Ruler of time and space"? What the heck?!<br>
Who's that? Is it the Siren that messed this place up?!<br>
<span style="color:#ec5d53;">Yamada Hermione：</span><br>
Perhaps, perhaps not... Ahahah, you need not know who it is.<br>
Now remain still as I do as my master instructed and end your lives.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Tokino Sora：</span><br>
Stop it, Aqua!<br>
<span style="color:#ec5d53;">Yamada Hermione：</span><br>
Please do not interfere, Miss Sora. It is my duty to kill these people.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Tokino Sora：</span><br>
Aqua would never say something crazy like that!<br>
<span style="color:#ec5d53;">Yamada Hermione：</span><br>
Would she not...? You're mistaken, because...<br>
I'm Aqua, too!!!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Zuikaku：</span><br>
... This is why the Sirens' pawns are such a pain. Aqua, if you can't fight someone who looks just like you, I can take care of her.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Minato Aqua：</span><br>
"Yamada Hermione"?! You cheeky Siren bastard! I'm a battle-hardened combat maid who's played through more hardcore games than you can even imagine! Don't you dare make fun of me!<br>

After eliminating the imposter spawned by the Mirror Sea, all the members of Hololive and Azur Lane safely managed to regroup.<br>
They brought with them the supplies they had gathered to the Resistance hideout, and spent the rest of their day there.<br>
Inside the Hololive Resistance Base<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ookami Mio：</span><br>
So when you defeated the Aqua clone, she instantly turned to light and vanished?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Shirakami Fubuki：</span><br>
Hang on... Doesn't that sound like she used the teleport command we have on the server?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Purity：</span><br>
Oh, you're kidding... You mean Tessy's assumed direct control of the server?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ayanami：</span><br>
Tessy? Ah, that girl who looked like Tester...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Javelin：</span><br>
Yeah. She's behaving really weird, just like Purifier. But unlike her, Tester is still evil...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Zuikaku：</span><br>
That means there's a high chance that Tester is that alleged "ruler of time and space"... Oh, right, how are you Hololivers doing? Everything all right?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Natsuiro Matsuri：</span><br>
We're A-OK! Ayame and Shion didn't seem keen on fighting at first, but they're pretty eager now that they've gotten the hang of it!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Nakiri Ayame：</span><br>
Th-they're the enemy, Matsuri! Of course Ay will fight them with all Ay have!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Murasaki Shion：</span><br>
Y-you said it! Aqua's enjoying herself too, so what's the big deal?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Natsuiro Matsuri：</span><br>
Ah, classic Gammadion Gang. Like three peas in a pod.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Tokino Sora：</span><br>
About the Sirens... Do you fight them all the time in this world?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Kawakaze：</span><br>
Correct. They are our enemies and threaten the safety of our sea lanes.<br>
We were created for the purpose of fighting the Sirens and driving them back.<br>
Although I have another duty: to protect Nagato, the shrine maiden of the Sakura Empire.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Tokino Sora：</span><br>
……<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Kawakaze：</span><br>
Sorry. I didn't intend to make the conversation so serious.<br>
Anyway, I suspect the Sirens will extract the data from your riggings to create more of their pawns. Your riggings were made here, after all.<br>
You should expect to have to fight more enemies that look like one of your own.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Zuikaku：</span><br>
Ahahahah, all we need to do is smack 'em down and put an end to whatever scheme the Sirens are trying to pull!<br>
Then we'll find Tester– sorry, Tessy, and solve the mystery behind the Hololive Server. Then we'll get you Hololivers home!<br>
But that's for tomorrow! Right now, we need to all get some sleep.<br>

Even knowing they're just copycats, fighting enemies that look like your allies takes its toll on you. I would know.<br>
But for them, it's even worse. This place their home, and this base looks just like one they put so much effort into making.<br>
Which is why I feel guilty about making them go to battle amidst all this.<br>
I don't like doing it, but we're all in this together. Our mutual trust will help us get through it. Right, Kawakaze?<br>
If you're concerned about them, just ask how they're faring.<br>

I guess we've got no choice but to fight her...<br>
But... can I actually do it? Can I fight someone who looks like her, even knowing she's the enemy? What if they make clones out of everyone...<br>

Now, let's continue from the last strategy discussion we held.<br>

Go ahead, teacher!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Shirakami Fubuki：</span><br>
Go ahead, teacher!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Z23：</span><br>
I'm not a teacher, just a facilitator! *Sigh*... Let's start with Purifi– excuse me, Purity, who has something to say.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Purity：</span><br>
So yeah, everyone's been talking about "solving the mystery of the Mirror Sea" and stuff. If you wanna do that, just get to the foundation of it.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Zuikaku：</span><br>
Its "foundation"?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Purity：</span><br>
You heard me. I don't mean foundation as in the bottom of this ocean sector or whatever, but the foundation behind the very concept of the Mirror Sea. Don't ask why, I just know.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Z23：</span><br>
Meaning, we'll find a way to turn the Mirror Sea back to normal when we get to the foundation of the Hololive Server?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Tokino Sora：</span><br>
Hmm... The foundation of the Hololive Server... Maybe she means the Hololive Headquarters? Would make sense, as we're all part of Hololive.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Z23：</span><br>
Actually... Zuikaku sent her recon planes to scout the area, and didn't find any building that appears to be a headquarters.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Murasaki Shion：</span><br>
We did find a massive maze that wasn't there yesterday, though.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ookami Mio：</span><br>
Massive maze? You mean the labyrinth I made?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Natsuiro Matsuri：</span><br>
Sounds to me like we might find something there!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Javelin：</span><br>
Let's do it! We might find some sort of clue in there!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Z23：</span><br>
Or walk haphazardly into a hazard... but it's better than having no leads to follow. Zuikaku, I suggest we explore the maze.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Zuikaku：</span><br>
Seems to be our only choice... Hololivers, I'd like you to handle communications and base defense, and we'll explore the–<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Shirakami Fubuki：</span><br>
I appreciate the courtesy, but I want to go into battle too.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Z23：</span><br>
Yes, but...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ookami Mio：</span><br>
And I wanna go with Fubuki! Besides, I made the labyrinth in the first place and know where all the traps are. I'll be your guide!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Zuikaku：</span><br>
True, your familiarity with it would be good to have.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Minato Aqua：</span><br>
Okay, then I'm going–<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Z23：</span><br>
We can't ALL sortie. Someone must remain here and keep an eye on the base and keep it functional.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Minato Aqua：</span><br>
Aww, I was just going to swear on my name that I'd find the headquarters building before anyone else.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Tokino Sora：</span><br>
Now, now, it's equally important to keep everything running, Aqua.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Laffey：</span><br>
Ayanami, Javelin, stay here and watch the base.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ayanami：</span><br>
Okay, we will.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Purity：</span><br>
Can I go? Please! Pretty please!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Z23：</span><br>
You're staying behind, Purity. Owing to your memory loss, we can't fully trust you.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Purity：</span><br>
Bawww...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Z23：</span><br>
All right, let's get to our respective tasks! We'll break free of this Mirror Sea together!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Everyone：</span><br>
Yeeeeah!<br>

<br>
Three hours later<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ookami Mio：</span><br>
... Sorry, everyone, I was wrong.<br>
I thought the labyrinth had only gotten bigger, but somebody's added new traps and ambush areas. What was originally the safe way through has become littered with traps...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Shirakami Fubuki：</span><br>
And it's all made from the ocean... If only we could simply swim beneath it. Go down where it's wetter, down where it's better.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Nakiri Ayame：</span><br>
Whoever remodeled the labyrinth must be familiar with how it was originally like...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Kawakaze：</span><br>
That leaves few candidates as to who it might be.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Shirakami Fubuki：</span><br>
A clone of Mio, I suppose... Would make sense if she was the keeper of this place.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Tokino Sora：</span><br>
But if someone went through all the trouble of changing the labyrinth, that might mean we're on the right track.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Kawakaze：</span><br>
If the key to solving the mystery of the Mirror Sea really does lie in here, then the enemy must be ready to protect it fiercely. Stay on your guards.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ookami Mio：</span><br>
You got it. I'm pumped up and ready to take on this chump of a pawn!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Shirakami Fubuki：</span><br>
Don't tempt fate with one-liners like that, Mio...<br>

<br>
Two hours later<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ookami Mio：</span><br>
Heh, okay, we've gotta go right at the next junction.<br>
Wait here. The path marked with a platter is the right one.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Laffey：</span><br>
I'm surprised we're making so much progress...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ookami Mio：</span><br>
That's thanks to Z23's idea! "If you were to remodel the labyrinth, how would you do it?"<br>
Everything falls into place when I view it from the perspective of what my clone would do.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Tokino Sora：</span><br>
We'll get to the end of this maze in no time at this rate!<br>
{{折叠面板|内容结束}}

<span style="color:#ec5d53;">???：</span><br>
It's just as the cards said... They'll get here no matter what I do to try to stop them.<br>
<span style="color:#ec5d53;">Miokawa Iiyo：</span><br>
I bid you welcome. I am the fortuneteller Miokawa Iiyo, otherwise known as Intelligence Mionnu.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Shirakami Fubuki：</span><br>
Hang on, I recognize her... That's Mio's character from when we were playing tabletop RPGs!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Nakiri Ayame：</span><br>
Ay had a feeling things would turn out this way when Ay saw that platter symbol...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ookami Mio：</span><br>
Surrender while you still can! You have no chance of winning when there are this many of us.<br>
<span style="color:#ec5d53;">Miokawa Iiyo：</span><br>
I would certainly like to, but...<br>
I have my orders from the ruler of time and space, and I cannot simply surrender...<br>
Listen, I'm really sorry, but I just have to defeat you.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Kawakaze：</span><br>
Then try it...!<br>
<br>
Before the Mio clone could even move a muscle, Kawakaze came lunging at her.<br>
The glint of her sword forms a beautiful arch, and just as her blade was about to bisect the imposter...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Kawakaze：</span><br>
(You're mine...!)<br>
<br>
SMASH!<br>
<span style="color:#ec5d53;">Miokawa Iiyo：</span><br>
I'm afraid that won't work...…<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Tokino Sora：</span><br>
She stopped Kawakaze's attack by breaking a platter?!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ookami Mio：</span><br>
She's a fortuneteller, so she can do things like that.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Kawakaze：</span><br>
Hrmh! If that's how you want it!<br>
<br>
Realizing her first attack failed, Kawakaze pulls back and launches her torpedoes. However...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Tokino Sora：</span><br>
Oh come on! She can stop torpedoes with them too?!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ookami Mio：</span><br>
Considering she has 75 points invested in her Throwing stat, yeah...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Kawakaze：</span><br>
......<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Shirakami Fubuki：</span><br>
Mio, why'd you even allocate her stats in such a weird way?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ookami Mio：</span><br>
She only appeared in like, one game! I didn't expect her to show up again in the future!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Laffey：</span><br>
Kawakaze, look out!<br>
<br>
BOOOOOM!<br>
Kawakaze is entirely focused on Iiyo, and doesn't notice the attack coming at her from the shadows.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Tokino Sora：</span><br>
Not on my watch!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Shirakami Fubuki：</span><br>
Miss Sora!<br>
<br>
Sora knocks Kawakaze out of the way and the blocks the shell with her rigging.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Tokino Sora：</span><br>
It's... it's fine! The rigging Purity made is sturdier than you'd think... Looks like that came in handy!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Kawakaze：</span><br>
I owe you my thanks...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Tokino Sora：</span><br>
Listen, clones! I'm in charge of protecting these people, and I'm not letting you lay a finger on them!<br>
<span style="color:#ec5d53;">???：</span><br>
Hmph. So you blocked it.<br>
<span style="color:#ec5d53;">Miokawa Iiyo：</span><br>
Thanks for showing up, Nakiri.<br>
<span style="color:#ec5d53;">Kakitsubata Nakiri：</span><br>
Ohohohoh! Well met, my otherworldly adversaries! My name is Kakitsubata Nakiri. As you can see, Ay am but a simple highschool girl with a noble upbringing.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Shirakami Fubuki：</span><br>
Don't let her appearance fool you! She might look dainty, but she's built like a muscle mountain and has 70 points in her Punching stat!<br>
<span style="color:#ec5d53;">Kakitsubata Nakiri：</span><br>
Ay haven't the faintest idea what it is you're talking about, dear.<br>
Tallyho, Iiyo. It is time to show them what we are made of.<br>

<span style="color:#ec5d53;">Miokawa Iiyo：</span><br>
Guess we never stood a chance...<br>
<span style="color:#ec5d53;">Kakitsubata Nakiri：</span><br>
Oh, blast it...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Tokino Sora：</span><br>
They did it again! They used the teleport command!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Z23：</span><br>
And they did so at the last possible moment... Is this some sort of automatic safety feature the server has?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ookami Mio：</span><br>
Hrm... I know they're just clones the Sirens made, but it's still hard to get myself to fight them.<br>
That said, I might be able to go all out if always get teleported away right before their HP hits 0. I'm not about to let an imposter beat me.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Shirakami Fubuki：</span><br>
Hmh, as someone once said: a faker will never be anything more than a faker...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Z23：</span><br>
But it's annoying that we can't reduce their numbers. They'll wear us down over time if they simply retreat, heal, and come back to fight us again.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Kawakaze：</span><br>
We need only take out their stronghold before it comes to that.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Zuikaku：</span><br>
(Sora seems a lot more resolute than she was yesterday... That's reassuring.)<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Tokino Sora：</span><br>
I'm done being hesitant. From now on, my mind is set: we'll put a stop to the Sirens' schemes and end this whole ordeal.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Laffey：</span><br>
I'm getting fed up with fighting all these clones...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Z23：</span><br>
I understand. Fighting clones of yourself is one thing, but it's rather distressing to fight those of your close friends.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Zuikaku：</span><br>
The Sirens have always played dirty like that. Once we get back, Purity's getting an earful from me!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Laffey：</span><br>
From me too...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Purity：</span><br>
I can hear you, ya know!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Zuikaku：</span><br>
Whuah?! Why are you contacting us all of a sudden, Purity?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ayanami：</span><br>
Zed, how is it going on your end?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Z23：</span><br>
We walked into an ambush, but we dealt with the Sirens and were just going to resume our search. What about the base, everything fine there?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ayanami：</span><br>
The base is functioning as normal.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Javelin：</span><br>
While the base is fine, there's this black veil that suddenly appeared out of nowhere! I think it's expanding, and coming from the labyrinth, actually...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Kawakaze：</span><br>
What?!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Nakiri Ayame：</span><br>
Look up, everyone!<br>
<br>
Just as Javelin said, there's a veil floating in the air above the labyrinth.<br>
Or rather, it's in the sky. It spans across the ocean, enveloping everything in its path.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Murasaki Shion：</span><br>
That's not a veil, it's a barrier! And unbelievably strong one, at that! I hit it with everything I have, yet it didn't as much as cut a hole into it!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Shirakami Fubuki：</span><br>
This is obviously an impassable wall the GM made that we can't pass through without permission...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Laffey：</span><br>
We can't go forward like this...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Kawakaze：</span><br>
It seems we have no choice but to fall back for the time being...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Natsuiro Matsuri：</span><br>
Say, if we can't go by air or by sea...<br>
Then I might have a good solution to the problem...<br>

"... Molds." "... Emotions." "... Intimations."<br>
And...<br>
   ……<br>
"... Falsehood." "... Greatness." "... Gates." <br>
And finally...<br>
<span style="color:#ec5d53;">Tester?：</span><br>
And with this, the Resistance will have their hands tied behind their backs. Well done, Fubu– I mean, my "Advisor."<br>
<span style="color:#ec5d53;">Advisor?：</span><br>
Don't worry. Those fools have no way to break the barriers created by your energy generator.<br>
<span style="color:#ec5d53;">Tester?：</span><br>
However, this Mirror Sea's control unit has a tendency to disobey me.<br>
<span style="color:#ec5d53;">Advisor?：</span><br>
Is that because... full authorization has not been granted yet?<br>
<span style="color:#ec5d53;">Tester?：</span><br>
Look there. This device has not fully acknowledged me. Me, Tester, the manipulator of space and time! The one who rules these seas!<br>
<span style="color:#ec5d53;">Advisor?：</span><br>
This must be the result of a prior faulty experiment. If you activate more of its functions, surely authorization will be restored.<br>
<span style="color:#ec5d53;">Tester?：</span><br>
Most likely. In that case, I will leave the defense of the perimeters to you, "Advisor."<br>
<br>
After teaming up to defeat the fake Ookami Mio, Azur Lane and the Hololive members found themselves hindered again by some sort of barrier.<br>
At that time, Hololive's Natsuiro Matsuri proposed a completely unprecedented strategy.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Natsuiro Matsuri：</span><br>
We'll just go underneath it!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Zuikaku：</span><br>
Huh? That's impossible! Aqua won't be able to go through the route that the other Mio told us about because of her submarine equipment!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Minato Aqua：</span><br>
There's no way we'll be able to get through the water! The barrier also extends underneath the surface, so it's a dead end!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Javelin：</span><br>
I wonder if this extends all the way to the bottom of the sea...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Natsuiro Matsuri：</span><br>
That's why we're not going underwater. We're going to be going underground.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Z23：</span><br>
Underground? Do you plan to dig a tunnel?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Minato Aqua：</span><br>
Wait, what... No way... You're kidding, right?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ayanami：</span><br>
Aqua, Shion, what will you two do?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Murasaki Shion：</span><br>
If you dig over there, you'll probably just end up in "the cemetery"...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Laffey：</span><br>
The cemetery...?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Natsuiro Matsuri：</span><br>
Ahem! ... That's just how Shion describes it! Its actual name is "Dark Hololive." It's a secret base filled with all sorts of traps.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Minato Aqua：</span><br>
But it's a haunted mansion!!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Natsuiro Matsuri：</span><br>
(Ignore)<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Z23：</span><br>
... In any case, according to the new intel we've collected, the Mirror Sea built from "Holoserver" is much larger than the original.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Natsuiro Matsuri：</span><br>
That's right. The earth and the sky... This place is a lot bigger than the Holoserver we know.<br>
In other words, if we use the secret passageway that was originally located underneath the seabed, we should be able to pass through the barrier!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Purity：</span><br>
Hmm, if it's the Tessy that I know... No, she wouldn't extend the barrier all the way into the lava.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Zuikaku：</span><br>
I suppose this is the best bet we have right now. It's worth a try.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Natsuiro Matsuri：</span><br>
That settles it! Our objective is to get to Dark Hololive! Let's begin the operation!<br>

<br>
With everyone's hard work, the huge diamond cross marking the base's entrance was quickly located.<br>
After much deliberation, Aqua and Shion remained inside the base while the others split up into a forward group and support group.<br>
Mirror Sea - Underground Pass<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Purity：</span><br>
... Why'd you bring me along...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Laffey：</span><br>
Purifier, don't ditch.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Purity：</span><br>
I wasn't going to ditch~ There's other stuff I could be doing, like expanding the base's defences or reinforcing the walls, right?<br>
You guys like keeping me behind the scenes, right?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Z23：</span><br>
... Thanks to you, the Resistance base's defenses are so strong that nobody can even touch it anymore...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Purity：</span><br>
Motion-sensing attack automata, a labyrinth of traps, and the TNT block cannon generated by those green villagers... Ahh, it's all so exciting!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Z23：</span><br>
We made the right decision to bring her with us...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Natsuiro Matsuri：</span><br>
Even if you're not able to help out here, don't think you're dead weight.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Laffey：</span><br>
Anyways, let's start by exploring. Purifier, help out as well.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Purity：</span><br>
But, I'm a Siren, you know? Who knows what I might do if things get a little chaotic here~<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Shirakami Fubuki：</span><br>
We want you to help precisely because you're a Siren! Experience withstanding, it's always more efficient to use boss characters whenever you get the chance!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Nakiri Ayame：</span><br>
If you wish to get under Tessy's skin as well then you may certainly join us, Purity.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Kawakaze：</span><br>
That decides it. We'll have you help, even if you don't want to.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Purity：</span><br>
Well, I was getting tired of sitting around crafting stuff anyway. If you're going to say that much, it wouldn't kill me to help out.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Natsuiro Matsuri：</span><br>
(This girl's such a simpleton...)<br>

"Are you sure about this?" "I don't think you're going to make it." "Hell lies just ahead, all right?"<br>
What's up with these signs...?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Natsuiro Matsuri：</span><br>
It's a totally different atmosphere with everyone together~~<br>
Wait a sec... the signs I made should have said "You still can make it!" and "There's always next time!"...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Shirakami Fubuki：</span><br>
Does that mean...<br>
<span style="color:#ec5d53;">???：</span><br>
Natsuiro Matsuri, answer me! Among the Hololive girls, who do you love the most?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Kawakaze：</span><br>
Who is it?!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Natsuiro Matsuri：</span><br>
Is that... a Matsuri imposter?!<br>
<span style="color:#ec5d53;">Ma Tsu Ri：</span><br>
Imposter? If you're the real deal, then you should be able to answer this question. Now, answer me! Among the Hololive girls, who do you love the most?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Natsuiro Matsuri：</span><br>
Um...<br>
<span style="color:#ec5d53;">Ma Tsu Ri：</span><br>
You can't answer, can you? Matsuri, you know what that means...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Natsuiro Matsuri：</span><br>
Well, if you suddenly ask me something like that... my answer is this!<br>
<span style="color:#ec5d53;">Ma Tsu Ri：</span><br>
Gyahh?!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Z23：</span><br>
Woah, she pulled out her rigging and started firing?!<br>
<span style="color:#ec5d53;">Ma Tsu Ri：</span><br>
I was... deceived...? Impossible!!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Natsuiro Matsuri：</span><br>
I could have said "I love them all," or "I can't decide," but... actions speak louder than words!<br>
I'll solve the mystery of the Mirror Sea, defeat you and the other imposters, and take everyone home to Hololive!<br>
If you plan to get in my way, then Natsuiro Matsuri will dance with you - with everything she has!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Z23：</span><br>
Woah, I don't know what just happened, but she started pulling out inspirational one-liners?!<br>
Everyone, prepare for battle!<br>

Oooohhhhhh!!<br>

Oh no... the fake Matsuri is powering up even more...<br>

Fubuki! Fubuki! Fubuki! Fubuki!! Aaahhhnnn!!<br>

Wait! W-w-wait a sec! Time out!<br>
Siren! Even if you're going to make me look bad... there's a time and place for it, as well as a target!<br>
There are plenty of people on stream spamming stuff like "Big Sister Matsuri~" or "I love your character, Matsuri," so why are you going to such lengths?!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Laffey：</span><br>
Fubuki, do you like Matsuri?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Shirakami Fubuki：</span><br>
Ehh?! Laffey, why are you asking me that all of a sudden... Oh, I see! That's the key to this battle!<br>
Matsuri, I love you~♡<br>
<span style="color:#ec5d53;">Ma Tsu Ri：</span><br>
AHH!!!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Laffey：</span><br>
She turned into a statue.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Z23：</span><br>
She let her guard down!<br>
<br>
With a single decisive blow, Kawakaze struck down the fake Matsuri.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Z23：</span><br>
She turned into light and disappeared...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Nakiri Ayame：</span><br>
Ay am not detecting any other enemies. Is this what it's like to have a radar...?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Shirakami Fubuki：</span><br>
Let's continue onward, everyone~ Lead the way, Matsuri. Matsuri?<br>

Advisor, it seems that the Resistance has traversed the barrier using a different route.<br>
Oh, and you don't need to bother teleporting these pawns back all the time. I'm the ruler of time and space; as long as I have direct control over the Mirror Sea, I don't need an army...<br>
<span style="color:#ec5d53;">Advisor?：</span><br>
My apologies. I shall ready the next line of defense.<br>
Even with the ability to teleport, I fear that we are only feeding them experience, allowing them to become even more powerful.<br>
Moreover, with the current level of authorization, it is difficult to create something significantly stronger than they are.<br>
<span style="color:#ec5d53;">Tester?：</span><br>
This whole authorization thing is such a pain...<br>
<br>
Returning to the barrier...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Shirakami Fubuki：</span><br>
All right! We've gotten through the barrier!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Natsuiro Matsuri：</span><br>
Heheh~ See that sign over there? The room right by it is full of amazing stuff!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Shirakami Fubuki：</span><br>
... Huh? By the way, Javelin and Aqua are headed straight for that room.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Natsuiro Matsuri：</span><br>
Uh-<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Javelin：</span><br>
Wh-wh-wh-whaaaaat is thaaaaaaat?!?!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Tokino Sora：</span><br>
My name's written on this sign. And inside the room, there's... my head?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Murasaki Shion：</span><br>
Nooooo...! Shion doesn't want to be trapped inside anymore...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Minato Aqua：</span><br>
AAAAAAAAAAAAAAHHHHH!!!!!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Zuikaku：</span><br>
If Atago was here, she'd take this thing down in one hit...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Natsuiro Matsuri：</span><br>
I'm so sorry! I never expected that the Hololive horror room would be reproduced to this degreeeeee!<br>
And uh... especially, the door traps... Um, watch your heads...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ayanami：</span><br>
Matsuri, you have what it takes to be a horror game maker.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ookami Mio：</span><br>
It's too much for me to take... My stomach... Blaaarghh...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Murasaki Shion：</span><br>
Ughh... You're a jerk, Matsuri...!!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Minato Aqua：</span><br>
I feel like the past Aquas are looking down on me from the skies, watching me waving my arms...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Z23：</span><br>
I agree that might have been overdoing it... Guh...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Natsuiro Matsuri：</span><br>
I'm sorry! Deeply sorry!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Zuikaku：</span><br>
We won't be able to move forward until everyone recovers... Ahahaha...<br>

<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Tokino Sora：</span><br>
The barrier above us seems to have disappeared.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Z23：</span><br>
Since we passed through the barrier, there would be no point for Tester to waste the energy to keep it going.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Javelin：</span><br>
Th-thank goodness... I never want to go through that room ever again.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Zuikaku：</span><br>
This place is also pretty spacious. Where's the Headquarters building?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Tokino Sora：</span><br>
Let's send out our recon planes as usual... Um, huh? How come I can't call them out?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Zuikaku：</span><br>
It seems that our aircraft can only fly near the surface of the ocean. We're in trouble now... how are we going to find our way?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Nakiri Ayame：</span><br>
Everyone, look at the ocean! Is that... obsidian... and lava?!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Z23：</span><br>
By lava, do you mean magma? Is a hotspot suddenly forming above the ocean?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Shirakami Fubuki：</span><br>
That's simply impossible in our world! There's no way for magma to just show up on the ocean!<br>
No matter how powerful the Sirens are, they've never been able to casually violate the laws of nature!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Murasaki Shion：</span><br>
Ah, is that tower-like building the observation deck that Matsuri created?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Z23：</span><br>
If we get onto that observation deck, we'll be able to survey the sea and its surroundings.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Natsuiro Matsuri：</span><br>
Well, I don't know how much farther we're going to be able to see...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Kawakaze：</span><br>
But doing something is better than doing nothing.<br>
{{折叠面板|内容结束}}

<span style="color:#ec5d53;">Miss Sora?：</span><br>
Welcome to the observation deck.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Javelin：</span><br>
There's another Sora over there...?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Tokino Sora：</span><br>
Eh? But I'm right here...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Kawakaze：</span><br>
This time, it's Sora imposter.<br>
<br>
In the blink of an eye, Kawakaze drew forth her guns and aimed them at the enemy.<br>
<span style="color:#ec5d53;">Miss Sora?：</span><br>
Your movements are skilled, but you still have much to learn~<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Kawakaze：</span><br>
She managed to deflect my attack, huh?<br>
<span style="color:#ec5d53;">Miss Sora?：</span><br>
This shield even has a little red bean pastry design on it. Isn't it cute~?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Z23：</span><br>
She's relaxed... she is probably a formidable enemy...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Tokino Sora：</span><br>
Are you... a "mirror image" made by the Sirens?<br>
<span style="color:#ec5d53;">Miss Sora?：</span><br>
There's nothing to be surprised about. That part of your personality will only hold you back when we fight, other "me."<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Tokino Sora：</span><br>
I'll make sure to keep improving myself!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Shirakami Fubuki：</span><br>
Is that... Miss Sora over there? The enemy is giving off a completely different vibe...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Z23：</span><br>
Don't let your guard down. These pawns are completely under the Sirens' command.<br>
<span style="color:#ec5d53;">Miss Sora?：</span><br>
Correct. That is why it falls upon me to stop you.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Minato Aqua：</span><br>
"You're not our ally? So you're the enemy, then?" Ahahaha! I always wanted to try saying that!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Natsuiro Matsuri：</span><br>
Leader!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Tokino Sora：</span><br>
It's really going to come down to this, huh? Fine then. Everyone, get ready for battle! Don't hesitate!<br>
<span style="color:#ec5d53;">Miss Sora?：</span><br>
Come at me with everything you have. I will not lose here!<br>

<span style="color:#ec5d53;">Miss Sora?：</span><br>
Ayame, your main guns are far to inaccurate. When attacking, consider the overall balance of your equipment.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Nakiri Ayame：</span><br>
Y-yes!<br>
<span style="color:#ec5d53;">Miss Sora?：</span><br>
Shion, controlling your aircraft is certainly important, but you must remember to observe your surroundings.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Murasaki Shion：</span><br>
I see! Thank you, Sora!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Z23：</span><br>
Explosions are going off all around her, so why is she talking like she's pulling the strings here?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Shirakami Fubuki：</span><br>
We're completely at her mercy...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Tokino Sora：</span><br>
Wh-what's with that incredible gravitas...<br>
<span style="color:#ec5d53;">Miss Sora?：</span><br>
My being was made with you as a template. If you strive to improve yourself, you will be able to surpass me one day. However, you'll have to defeat me here first.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Tokino Sora：</span><br>
Eh? Um, I'll do my best!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Natsuiro Matsuri：</span><br>
Even the real Miss Sora is getting caught up by her?!<br>
<span style="color:#ec5d53;">Miss Sora?：</span><br>
Thanks to the help of everyone in Azur Lane, you've all learned how to control your riggings.<br>
Oh, and Aqua? Did you just poke fun of me with one of my own lines?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Minato Aqua：</span><br>
E-eh?<br>
<span style="color:#ec5d53;">Miss Sora?：</span><br>
"SO YOU'RE THE ENEMY, THEN?"<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Minato Aqua：</span><br>
Eep?!<br>
I'm sorry, Miss Sora, I'm so very sorry! I'm so sorry, so please don't bomb me. I'm sorry! I'm very, very sorry!<br>
<span style="color:#ec5d53;">Miss Sora?：</span><br>
Nope, not good enough~♪<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Minato Aqua：</span><br>
AAAAAAAAAAAAAHHHH!!!!!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Zuikaku：</span><br>
Sh-she subdued everyone, all by herself...?!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Laffey：</span><br>
A strong enemy...!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Kawakaze：</span><br>
She's nothing like the other clones we've faced!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Purity：</span><br>
Heeh~ Purity doesn't really know what's going on, but for an enemy to be this strong, surely there's some external factor involved? For example, an energy supply or something~<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Z23：</span><br>
But... I'm not seeing anything of the sort!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ayanami：</span><br>
I saw something flashing red on her riggings early.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Javelin：</span><br>
You're right! Look, it's getting faster!<br>
<span style="color:#ec5d53;">Miss Sora?：</span><br>
Time's up... Regrettably, it's your win this time.<br>
Umm, I have a message from the ruler of space and time herself. "Everyone, keep going and don't stop for anything!"<br>
<br>
In a flash of light, the clone of Tokino Sora disappeared.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Zuikaku：</span><br>
A narrow victory, I suppose...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Kawakaze：</span><br>
It appears that we were handed this one...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Javelin：</span><br>
But, that means we at least can move on, right...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Minato Aqua：</span><br>
I'm sorry! I'm very sorry! I got ahead of myself! I'm so very sorry...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Tokino Sora：</span><br>
It's okay, Aqua. Here, here. *pats*<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Purity：</span><br>
As expected, there was an amplification device. Moreover, this was a custom device attuned for this specific part of the Mirror Sea.<br>
(... Well done, Tessy! I didn't think you'd be able to activate all these functions so quickly!)<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Kawakaze：</span><br>
If large numbers of enemies are equipped with these things, we won't stand a chance.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Natsuiro Matsuri：</span><br>
Hmm... we won't have time to slowly look around then...<br>
{{折叠面板|内容结束}}

<span style="color:#ec5d53;">Tester?：</span><br>
It looks like the experimental device was a success.<br>
<span style="color:#ec5d53;">Advisor?：</span><br>
The short time limit is its main disadvantage, but it is, without a doubt, very effective at enhancing combat power.<br>
<span style="color:#ec5d53;">Tester?：</span><br>
With a little more fine tuning, I'll be able to equip my mass-produced "Pieces" with these devices, Holoserver will also fall into my dominion over time and space!<br>
<span style="color:#ec5d53;">Advisor?：</span><br>
Indeed. This device is proof that you're gradually gaining control of the server. Once you've cleared all the authorizations, the Resistance will no longer pose any threat to you.<br>
<span style="color:#ec5d53;">Tester?：</span><br>
That would be wonderful. I'll continue working then. I'll entrust you with the countermeasures.<br>
<br>
Meanwhile...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Minato Aqua：</span><br>
Ahahahaha! HAHahah! Finally... we've finally found it! The Hololive headquarters! Let's go, Hololive Resistance!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Zuikaku：</span><br>
Aqua's finally back to her old self.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ayanami：</span><br>
It's fine to scout things out from the observation deck, but we still have to make our way over to the HQ building.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Z23：</span><br>
The lava flow area is expanding... *gasp*! Is this the Sirens' defense system?!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Zuikaku：</span><br>
Are the Sirens planning to drown this entire area with magma?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Shirakami Fubuki：</span><br>
That is a possibility... We won't be able to reach the HQ building without crossing the sea first...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Natsuiro Matsuri：</span><br>
It's like we were playing on creative mode before, but now we're on survival mode!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Javelin：</span><br>
Everyone! We found lots of TNT blocks on the observatory island!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Minato Aqua：</span><br>
20 boxes of TNT! Add this to what we already have, and we'd be able to blow away half of the original Holoserver!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Murasaki Shion：</span><br>
Huh? Did something like that happen before...?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Javelin：</span><br>
What's the matter, Zed? You look deep in thought.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Z23：</span><br>
Mm. I'm glad we have a supply of TNT blocks, but how are we going to get them over to the HQ building?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Zuikaku：</span><br>
With all this lava being blown around, we won't be able to use our planes, as they won't be able to maintain altitude.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ookami Mio：</span><br>
Hmm? In that case, let's use this roller coaster that Shion and I made. We called it, the "MioShio Coaster!"<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Nakiri Ayame：</span><br>
A few other friends helped with to build it. When the weather is clear, the view from the top is unbelievable.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Javelin：</span><br>
Ooh, a roller coaster! I've always wanted to ride one with the Commander!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Z23：</span><br>
Javelin, take this more seriously! ... The MioShio, huh? Where do I get on this roller coaster?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Murasaki Shion：</span><br>
There should be an entrance near the observation deck! I'll go look for it!<br>
{{折叠面板|内容结束}}

{{折叠面板|标题=The Broken Entrance|选项=38|主框=1|样式=primary|展开=否}}
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Javelin：</span><br>
This is the third entrance...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Laffey：</span><br>
... And they've all been destroyed by the Sirens...<br>
<br>
They searched for the entrance to the roller coaster, but all three had been completely destroyed by the Sirens.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Shirakami Fubuki：</span><br>
It feels like they're always a step ahead of us... the Sirens must have some really brilliant tactician on their side...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ayanami：</span><br>
Kawakaze, what's the matter?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Kawakaze：</span><br>
This destruction was wrought not with gunfire or explosives...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Murasaki Shion：</span><br>
Are you saying it would look like this if I blasted it with my magic?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Nakiri Ayame：</span><br>
Shion... are you behind this?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Murasaki Shion：</span><br>
No, I'm not!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Z23：</span><br>
If it's not our Shion, then that should be our next hint.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Tokino Sora：</span><br>
A Shion clone, then...<br>

Eeehhhhh? Stop! Stop that this instant!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Natsuiro Matsuri：</span><br>
Oh? It's Shion this time. How cute!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Zuikaku：</span><br>
Does Shion sometimes act like this too?!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Z23：</span><br>
I think Tester's device broke...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Murasaki Shion：</span><br>
Those were truly dark times! Forget you ever saw this!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ayanami：</span><br>
This is a recycled plot. The Sirens must be punished.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Murasaki Shion：</span><br>
Neeeeee! Stop staring and help me stop this thing!<br>
<span style="color:#ec5d53;">Sh I On：</span><br>
You haven't had enough yet? But it's not a problem! I still... have another trump card!<br>

Eh? You're going to get even cringier?!<br>
<span style="color:#ec5d53;">Sh I On：</span><br>
I have something to prove after all! Matsuri, you're so cute! I love you! I love you so much...<br>

Who're you calling a grade schooler?! You STUPID MORONIC IDIOT!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Natsuiro Matsuri：</span><br>
Farewell, Honest Shion...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Murasaki Shion：</span><br>
The hell are you bidding farewell to my clone for?! I'll destroy you!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Zuikaku：</span><br>
Huh? That's it? I thought she'd stick around for longer.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Z23：</span><br>
This was the weakest enemy we've ever met.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Javelin：</span><br>
It might have been weaker than the fake Aqua we met at the beginning.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Murasaki Shion：</span><br>
Huh?! We're talking about the enemy! Shouldn't you be happy that the enemy's weak?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Nakiri Ayame：</span><br>
For some reason, it seems that the fake versions of all of us, Miss Sora excluded, have just been the victims of public executions...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ookami Mio：</span><br>
Ahh, that's because all of these are facets that we've broadcasted of ourselves.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Shirakami Fubuki：</span><br>
We still haven't encountered a fake version of me... Exactly what kind of character could it be... I'm become scared to find out...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Z23：</span><br>
It's a bit hard to come out and say this, but don't you guys feel that this is really a bit like reaping what you guys have sowed...?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Purity：</span><br>
Heeeh~ That's totally strange~ I wonder which aspect of Purifier I'm supposed to reflect~<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Zuikaku：</span><br>
... Haven't you just lost your memories. It's not like it makes any difference regardless of what kind of character you're supposed to be.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Kawakaze：</span><br>
If it wasn't for this situation at hand, there's absolutely no way we'd be cooperating with you, who are a Purifier.<br>
I will have you know that the moment you make the smallest movement with the intention of harming my comrades, my blade will have cleaved your very soul from your body.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Purity：</span><br>
Yeah, yeah. But seriously, I'm totally intrigued by this~ Y'know, stuff like passionate, INTEEEEEEENSE friendship, or a burning, intense development, or somethin'?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Kawakaze：</span><br>
Save the sleeptalking for when you're asleep.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Z23：</span><br>
Anyway, thinking about Fake Shion's combat power, I think they should be/are likely to be avoiding direct combat with us.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Zuikaku：</span><br>
So basically, what you're saying is that our encounters here were all by chance, and that there are probably other entrances out there.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Shirakami Fubuki：</span><br>
I think I can sense some hope now!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ookami Mio：</span><br>
Yep yep, it's still waaay too early to be giving up. There are still other entrances, so let's search other places for them!<br>

It seems that Resistance brats have discovered an entrance that hasn't been destroyed yet. That's a huge failure, right, Advisor?<br>
As far as I know, the damaged "pieces" that have taken damage during this time have yet to finish being repaired. What do you plan to do?<br>
<span style="color:#ec5d53;">Military Advisor?：</span><br>
Please rest assured. Everything is still going just as planned.<br>
We have already swapped out the rails for the rollercoaster. The destination of the Resistance will not be the headquarters, but instead, in a pit of magma.<br>
<span style="color:#ec5d53;">Tester?：</span><br>
Hmm, making the first move was a very good move.<br>
<span style="color:#ec5d53;">Military Advisor?：</span><br>
It is because I have studied "Zhuge Liang's Strategems" very thoroughly. This time, I have prepared an ambush for the Resistance. Please continue to focus wholly on taking back power.<br>

<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Natsuiro Matsuri：</span><br>
Huh? This isn't the destination that's marked on the map...? Matsuri, you told me you were completely sure about the specificatio... Wahhhhhh!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Shirakami Fubuki：</span><br>
Was it a trap laid out by the Sirens?! Wait, how are we supposed to escape from this high speed rotating... awawawa!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Kawakaze：</span><br>
Zuikaku!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Zuikaku：</span><br>
With all this rotation, even if I launch carrier-based planes, we won't be able to grab hold of them!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Purity：</span><br>
Ey everyone, don't panic, and grab hooold of my rigging~<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Everyone：</span><br>
Aaaahhhhh!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ookami Mio：</span><br>
Purity's rigging!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Purity：</span><br>
Even though I have memory loss, I still remember how to take this bad boy out~ Weeell, I never expected to be useful in a pinch, though~<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Laffey：</span><br>
Purifier, amazing.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Purity：</span><br>
Ahahaha! It's fine to keep singing my praises!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Z23：</span><br>
T-To be saved by a Siren...! How am I supposed to report on this to the Commander...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Kawakaze：</span><br>
Sora, everyone, are you okay?!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Tokino Sora：</span><br>
Everyone's safe! But you know, that train, it's completely submerged in the magma...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Zuikaku：</span><br>
First, we should get off Purity's rigging and land... eh? Is that... a wall? And a huge mural...?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Minato Aqua：</span><br>
That mural... isn't it a bit different from the ones from before?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Nakiri Ayame：</span><br>
The Sora inside the mural is equipped with her rigging!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Natsuiro Matsuri：</span><br>
The Matsuri on the wall, is well-developed in certain places...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Z23：</span><br>
Like I thought, this is different from the "pieces" we've encountered so far.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Murasaki Shion：</span><br>
I feel like it's strange to just treat them as "enemies."<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Zuikaku：</span><br>
While it is our duty as warships to defeat Sirens, I have no desire to force you all to cooperate in doing so.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Nakiri Ayame：</span><br>
Nay, these were merely past fragments of ourselves, so there is no reason to be so considerate of us.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ookami Mio：</span><br>
Well, thinking on the bright side, if we defeat the Boss of the Sirens, everything will return back to normal, so if we try hard, we should be able to avoid battles.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Kawakaze：</span><br>
... Sorry for making you help out.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Tokino Sora：</span><br>
I lost my way for a little bit, but... no longer. If I have no choice but to defeat them in order to take everyone back safely... I'll do it!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Minato Aqua：</span><br>
Heehee, a strategy like this? Too easy~. When you think that it will be impossible, just leave it to the Amazing Aqua!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Shirakami Fubuki：</span><br>
I... eh, Matsuri?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Natsuiro Matsuri：</span><br>
Yeup, I think I might have an idea!<br>

<span style="color:#ec5d53;">???：</span><br>
I'm terribly sorry for bothering you guys when you're all so pumped up, but...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Kawakaze：</span><br>
Who's there?! Show yourself!<br>
<span style="color:#ec5d53;">Master Detective Fubuki?：</span><br>
Hehehe. The one known as the Advisor, the Great Detective Fubuki, has arrived to stop you all in your tracks.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Shirakami Fubuki：</span><br>
THE ONE THE SIRENS COPIED ACTUALLY ENDED UP BEING THIS TROUBLESOME ONE AFTER ALL!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Zuikaku：</span><br>
Master Detective Fubuki... So you're the one who was hindering us all along!<br>
<span style="color:#ec5d53;">Master Detective Fubuki?：</span><br>
Well well, that's basically correct~<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Z23：</span><br>
The fake sign on the barrier and the lava trap, was it all your doing?!<br>
<span style="color:#ec5d53;">Master Detective Fubuki?：</span><br>
I simply gave them some advice. Others executed for me.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Kawakaze：</span><br>
It takes some guts for an advisor like you to appear at the front lines, alone. You're not here to surrender, are you?<br>
<span style="color:#ec5d53;">Master Detective Fubuki?：</span><br>
No way~ Oh, Kawakaze, you're such a joker~ This game is in its last stages anyway, so I felt that it'd be good to make my appearance around now.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Shirakami Fubuki：</span><br>
Game?<br>
<span style="color:#ec5d53;">Master Detective Fubuki?：</span><br>
Everything that's happened until now. Hey, don't zone out on me now.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Shirakami Fubuki：</span><br>
Eh?! This is...<br>
<span style="color:#ec5d53;">Master Detective Fubuki?：</span><br>
This is the shadow game the magnificent me developed after researching the games that the ship girls were playing!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Natsuiro Matsuri：</span><br>
Shadow game...??<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Zuikaku：</span><br>
Th-This is...! Everyone's being swallowed into a mysterious spatial blister?<br>
<span style="color:#ec5d53;">Master Detective Fubuki?：</span><br>
This is a battle of wits befitting an advisor! Now, choose your deck, Hololive Resistance!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Shirakami Fubuki：</span><br>
This is our only option... I'll accept your challenge, Master Detective!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Both：</span><br>
It's time to duel!<br>
{{折叠面板|内容结束}}

<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ayanami：</span><br>
I send Shion to the Resistance base, place a taunt counter on Purity, and end my turn.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Purity：</span><br>
Eh?! Me?! Wait a sec! Why am I being forced to be the tank?!<br>
<span style="color:#ec5d53;">Master Detective Fubuki?：</span><br>
As expected from someone who usually plays games, you've already picked up on the rules.<br>
But how's this? The field spell, "Sea of Lava," taps Purity with its effect! I also use Mirror Sea's National Power 4 to activate "Siren Technology: Mass Production!"<br>
On top of that, I use "Coin" to discard two 1 mana cost "Mass Production Model"s, and fulfilling the cost for Star and Moon, I increase my Link rating to 3.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Javelin：</span><br>
I don't really get it, but you've been the only one playing since we started!<br>
<span style="color:#ec5d53;">Master Detective Fubuki?：</span><br>
Solitaire is a developer's privilege! Return to me, Yamada Hermione, Kakitsubata Nakiri, and Miokawa Iiyo!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Minato Aqua：</span><br>
I see... with this, I completely understand the combo! Arise, my vanguard, "Archangel Aqua!" Ignition Overdrive!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Shirakami Fubuki：</span><br>
Aqua! Watch out! Fauxbuki still has one evolution left!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ayanami：</span><br>
Is this possibly Hololive's trump card...!<br>
<span style="color:#ec5d53;">Master Detective Fubuki?：</span><br>
You're too late! Due to the damage, burst activates, "The Great Detective Fubuki's Riddle!"<br>
I sacrifice all of my "pieces" and banish them from the game! With this, I summon my strongest servant!<br>
Come out, the ultimate form of Shirakami Fubuki, ruler of time and space, Shadow Eye Blizzard Fox!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Natsuiro Matsuri：</span><br>
That isn't a monster... That's Fubuki!<br>
<span style="color:#ec5d53;">Master Detective Fubuki?：</span><br>
I just have to defeat your Fubuki in order to win! Now, you would do well to bow before the most noble power in the entire Hololive Headquarters!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Shirakami Fubuki：</span><br>
... I wouldn't be so sure about that.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Javelin：</span><br>
Fubuki, you're still standing...? But how...?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Shirakami Fubuki：</span><br>
Quick-Play Spell Activated! I fuse the furniture "Secret Magic Booster" with myself!<br>
This effect can only be activated in another world! It nullifies one direct attack from the opponent, and reflects it back at them!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Purity：</span><br>
You're saying that it's an effect that's not written on the card, but... a hidden effect?!<br>
<span style="color:#ec5d53;">Master Detective Fubuki?：</span><br>
Th-That... There's no way...! Gahh!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Javelin：</span><br>
Did the enemy just faint from Kawakaze's silently striking her with the back of her sword?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Z23：</span><br>
The mysterious space has dissipated... W-We've won... right?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Zuikaku：</span><br>
For some reason, I'm tired out... Let's hurry to the Hololive headquarters...<br>
{{折叠面板|内容结束}}

<span style="color:#ec5d53;">Tester?：</span><br>
Hmm, to think that even you would lose... It seems like there really is a limit to using "pieces."<br>
<span style="color:#ec5d53;">Master Detective Fubuki?：</span><br>
*cough* *cough*... My sincerest apologies...<br>
<span style="color:#ec5d53;">Tester?：</span><br>
It doesn't matter. From the beginning, the only purpose you've all served was to buy more time for me while I increased my authorization over the Mirror Sea. In other words, "pieces."<br>
Look around you. The Mirror Seas around us slowly bend to my will, and the pseudo-Singularity that shall serve as a "Gate" between worlds shall open soon!<br>
With this power, repairing "pieces" is a simple task... So what say you? Do you wish to reward the Resistance with one final battle?<br>
<span style="color:#ec5d53;">Master Detective Fubuki?：</span><br>
Thank you for your consideration... I see now... the authorization is almost complete... Everything has been going according to plan.<br>
<span style="color:#ec5d53;">Tester?：</span><br>
Sure. You've bought me the time I needed to clear the authorization, so... Go forth, quickly...<br>
............<br>
<br>
The sound of a surge of electricity was followed by wisps of smoke rising from Tester's body. The Siren collapsed as she lost consciousness.<br>
<span style="color:#ec5d53;">Master Detective Fubuki?：</span><br>
Everything has been going according to plan... Now, it's time for me to prepare my next move.<br>
<br>
Waters surrounding the Hololive HQ<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Zuikaku：</span><br>
Y'know, I've been through quite a lot, so I thought nothing could surprise me...<br>
But this performance stage...<br>
<br>
A performance stage, cobbled together with blocks of various colors, loomed before Zuikaku.<br>
The words "HOLOLIVE" were assembled with large blocks towards the stage's rear.<br>
Though the appearance was quite normal, there was something indescribably threatening about it.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Laffey：</span><br>
Zed, I want to watch a concerton this stage.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Z23：</span><br>
I know nothing about that!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Tokino Sora：</span><br>
Eh? Do you girls also go to concerts?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Z23：</span><br>
W-well, not all of them, but some of them...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Javelin：</span><br>
"Hololive Stage," huh... Is this where everyone gathers for performances in your world?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Natsuiro Matsuri：</span><br>
This is the new Holo Island Stage that Fubuki made! In any case, it might be a bit unfamiliar to you guys.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Shirakami Fubuki：</span><br>
Awawawa! This was just... supposed to be a parody! *hides*<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Z23：</span><br>
(I have a feeling she just barely stopped herself from saying something really controversial...)<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Tokino Sora：</span><br>
Before I came here, I actually wanted to dance on stage with the others. This stage is so cute with all its different colors~<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Murasaki Shion：</span><br>
(Miss Sora doesn't get it at all, does she...)<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Shirakami Fubuki：</span><br>
(It's okay, just leave it as it is...)<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Zuikaku：</span><br>
I got it! In other words, this stage was distorted by the Sirens!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ookami Mio：</span><br>
(Zuikaku doesn't get it either...)<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Shirakami Fubuki：</span><br>
(That's fine too!)<br>

<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Z23：</span><br>
Come to think of it, that "Advisor" person said something about being "the ruler of time and space."<br>
I thought that was Tester's deal, so why did she...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Shirakami Fubuki：</span><br>
Shadow Eye Blizzard Fox... why does it feel like I've heard that before?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Z23：</span><br>
Hmm... It doesn't ring any bells, but I feel like I should know something about that "ruler of time and space."<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Murasaki Shion：</span><br>
Surely you don't mean... No, there's no way...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Minato Aqua：</span><br>
I-I'm sure it's just the name of a card that the Master Detective person made up!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ayanami：</span><br>
Ayanami thinks so too.<br>
<br>
RUMBLE RUMBLE RUMBLE! MENACING NOISES!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Laffey：</span><br>
An earthquake...?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Zuikaku：</span><br>
Everyone, over there!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Shirakami Fubuki：</span><br>
That's the Shadow Eye Blizzard Fox! ... It's the final boss!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Purity：</span><br>
Is that thing Tester's trap card?!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Tokino Sora：</span><br>
Don't panic! We don't know if that thing's an enemy yet. And even if it is, we can't let it stop us!<br>
Because I have to face myself, because it's my reflection in the mirror - I have to accept reality and move forward without running away from it!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Kawakaze：</span><br>
...!!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Tokino Sora：</span><br>
That's why... Kawakaze, don't worry about me! I'll be okay!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Kawakaze：</span><br>
That's right...! Right now... you should be true to yourself!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Tokino Sora：</span><br>
Mhm! No matter how hard the battle gets, if you think about all your friends - not just the ones here, and gather their power...<br>
As long as the bond between all of us remains unbroken, we'll definitely find a way to win!<br>

<span style="color:#ec5d53;">DARK FOX BIZZARD：</span><br>
Hahahah... You're here at last, Resistance. I've been waiting for you. My name is Shadow Eye Blizzard Fox.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Javelin：</span><br>
Whew... it's a giant Fubuki?!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Zuikaku：</span><br>
So you're the last ace up Tester's sleeve!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Kawakaze：</span><br>
No, Zuikaku, look! Her riggings include Tester's!<br>
<span style="color:#ec5d53;">DARK FOX BIZZARD：</span><br>
How perceptive, Kawakaze. That's right. Tester, in her incomplete state, was merely a pawn in my plans to use this Mirror Sea. I simply eliminated her because she got in the way.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Z23：</span><br>
What?! Making a Siren... into her pawn?!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Purity：</span><br>
Ahahahaha! Serves you right, creep! Anyway, if we defeat you, then this entire sea area is going to fall apart?!<br>
<span style="color:#ec5d53;">DARK FOX BIZZARD：</span><br>
Now now, calm down a little bit. That "Tessy" does seem to like interacting with you bunch, am I right?<br>
My plan will allow you all to survive! After all, my designs are much grander in scale!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Laffey：</span><br>
... I don't get it.<br>
<span style="color:#ec5d53;">DARK FOX BIZZARD：</span><br>
Apparently, the gateway that formed between worlds as a result of this Mirror Sea caused many unexpected things to happen to the Sirens, and that in turn gave birth to me.<br>
Take a closer look at your surroundings. The Hololive Headquarters still stands, and look at the manifestation of Siren technology! With this power, you can create as many "pieces" as you desire!<br>
"Pieces" are excellent. They can do just about anything for you. There's no limit to how many you can produce, and the more there are, the greater the variance of the projects you can carry out!<br>
At the same time, iterating upon different attributes to satisfy the tastes of fans around the world will generate a near infinite stream of revenue, thus removing worries about monetization! The power of science is truly intoxicating!!<br>
Am I not a genius for coming up with this? Ahahaha!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Z23：</span><br>
You intend to... keep the Mirror Sea for yourself?!<br>
<span style="color:#ec5d53;">DARK FOX BIZZARD：</span><br>
Oh, but that's not all. In addition to manufacturing "pieces," I can control the weather, monitor other dimensions, or even predict the future with simulations. If I can expand my influence around the world, then I can become the true ruler of humanity!<br>
When that time comes, Hololive Headquarters will manage every form of human entertainment in this world! I will reign over all VTubers!<br>
Oh, that's right, KAN-SEN and VTubers who are not "pieces" never have to worry about not having work.<br>
The endless battle between your kind and the Sirens shall become a permanent classic with daily updates! Ahahahaha!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Zuikaku：</span><br>
She's completely out of her mind...! As expected, Siren technology is far too dangerous!<br>
We'll never let anyone try to enslave humanity using the Mirror Seas ever again!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Shirakami Fubuki：</span><br>
But, you can't win all by yourself. No matter how many "pieces" you summon, nobody wants to fight the same enemies over and over again...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Natsuiro Matsuri：</span><br>
Hold up, Fubuki! Step back, everyone, and just leave it to Matsuri!<br>
Ahem! Shadow Eye Blizzard Fox! I understand your sentiments!<br>
However, there is just one flaw in your plan! And that is - what if you made a "piece" that has the same ego as you?<br>
Yamada Hermione, Miokawa Iiyo, Kakitsubata Nakiri, Ma Tsu Ri, and Shi O N, and the super-charismatic version of Miss Sora...<br>
If they're anything like you, they'll never be satisfied with being your subordinate!<br>
<span style="color:#ec5d53;">DARK FOX BIZZARD：</span><br>
...! You, you're right! I forgot about what I did!<br>
How perceptive of you to detect the flaw in my plans! Gather here, my "pieces!"<br>
Um, if I remember properly, you mess with the database here, initiate the "piece" data... like that!<br>
<span style="color:#ec5d53;">"Piece"：</span><br>
... ...<br>
<span style="color:#ec5d53;">Ma Tsu Ri：</span><br>
... ...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ayanami：</span><br>
I thought we already defeated Matsuri's clone...?<br>
<span style="color:#ec5d53;">DARK FOX BIZZARD：</span><br>
Ahhh! Their personality data has disappeared!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Shirakami Fubuki：</span><br>
It's true! They're not moving at all!<br>
Ahem! Do you see now, Shadow Eye Blizzard Fox?<br>
If your ambitions do not value the feelings of others, you can't make the world a happier place, no matter how many "pieces" you make!<br>
<span style="color:#ec5d53;">DARK FOX BIZZARD：</span><br>
Gah... Even if that's the case, I still have the power of the Hololive Headquarters...!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Shirakami Fubuki：</span><br>
No! Hololive is not yours alone!<br>
The parents that created us, the staff, and the support of the fans... Everyone comes together to make Hololive what it is!<br>
<span style="color:#ec5d53;">DARK FOX BIZZARD：</span><br>
Nooooo...!! Curse you, Hololive Resistance...!!<br>

A-Are you saying that I was mistaken...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Zuikaku：</span><br>
Giant Fubuki turned into light and disappeared to the Hololive headquarters building...!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ayanami：</span><br>
We have no enemy signatures around us. That was the last one.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Laffey：</span><br>
Hold on, I'm tired...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Nakiri Ayame：</span><br>
We've defeated the last enemy, and all that's left is do something about the Hololive headquarters building in order to make the Mirror Sea disappear right?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ookami Mio：</span><br>
But what should we do about the headquarters building? If what Fauxbuki said wasn't wrong, it should be quite reinforced with Siren technology, you know?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Minato Aqua：</span><br>
The solution is... There's only one thing left to do.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Natsuiro Matsuri：</span><br>
Hehehe, everyone, for what reason do you think we've collected all the TNT blocks so far~?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Kawakaze：</span><br>
What are you planning on doing?<br>
... Wait, is she perhaps!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Murasaki Shion：</span><br>
Hehehe, it seems like the time to show off this great Shion's magic has come.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Tokino Sora：</span><br>
Umm, take care to make sure that you don't cause too much destruction, okay? It wouldn't be good to hurt our Azur Lane friends, right?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Shirakami Fubuki：</span><br>
...... Thinking about it, I was a little taken aback.<br>
That Fauxbuki. Starting halfway through the fight, I wonder why she didn't make her "pieces" fight even until the end...<br>
I wonder if I'm really just thinking too deep into it...<br>
Well, I guess it's all fine! I'll help carry the TNT over too!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Z23：</span><br>
Fubuki, are you okay with this? That building might contain some hints about ways to return back to your world, you know?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Shirakami Fubuki：</span><br>
Mm~ That might be true, but leaving it as is is a huge annoyance for this world, isn't it?<br>
Besides, everyone else gets it too. That nothing will change even if we're impatient about it!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Z23：</span><br>
I-Is that so...?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Zuikaku：</span><br>
Everyone, thank you...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Z23：</span><br>
Zuikaku, let's help them set up the TNT too!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Tokino Sora：</span><br>
Oka~y, now set the TNT around the building, because Aqua is going to press the explosion switch~<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Purity：</span><br>
Hmm~ you guys are going to blow it up after all. Is that really okay? Doesn't the Sakura Empire want Siren technology for themselves?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Zuikaku：</span><br>
Siren technology is dangerous. You should know that the best.<br>
Our path is something that we'll carve out with our own hands!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Purity：</span><br>
Hm~ Well that's fine. Aight, I'll help out a bit as well!<br>

Finally, the last moments have arrived.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Minato Aqua：</span><br>
Well then, please listen to my response!<br>
On this day, at this time, feeling the advent of spring<br>
I, Minato Aqua, was able to head toward graduation without issue.<br>
Those who were always by me since arriving in the world of Azur Lane: Fubuki, Matsuri, Mio, Ayame, Shion, Sora<br>
Those who always fought together with us: Kawakaze, Zuikaku, Laffey, Ayanami, Javelin, Z23, Purity<br>
Along with Yamada Hermione, Miokawa Iiyo, Kakitsubata Nakiri, Ma Tsu Ri, Shi O N, Super Sadist Sora, Great Detective Fubuki, Dark Fox Blizzard<br>
And, the one who didn't make a single appearance from start to finish, Tester<br>
Friend or Foe, I truly thank you for everything.<br>
If I think about it, just a little bit ago, my chest was full of unease and fear as I entered through the gate of the Mirror Sea.<br>
Since that day, I was able to make countless memories with everyone.<br>
In a group together with everyone, I was able to increase my skills in battle. From a battle between maids, to planning and clearing a huge labyrinth, to a Shadow Duel...<br>
The fear of being thrust into crisis after crisis, the joy of collecting items<br>
I was able to learn many things spending everyday life as a ship girl.<br>
Even if I graduate, I will never forget the lessons I have learned here.<br>
Everyone, I thank you for taking care of me up to now!<br>
While this ends with that, as a member of Hololive, I would like to offer everyone a prayer for their lives after this event.<br>
Graduating Student Representative, Minato Aqua<br>
...<br>
Well then, Hololive Resistance, we're good to go! Let's start this show!<br>
Five, four, three, two, one...<br>
Explosion!!!<br>

......<br>
The headquarters building has been completely blown up, it seems. Was that laugh Aqua's voice?<br>
I guess I'll congratulate you, in a way. How utterly ridiculous.<br>
Have some consideration for this body's sound reception part, gosh. Ugh, and her voice is so loud.<br>
... My conscience is slowly fading.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Observer：</span><br>
"Purifier. Welcome back♪"<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Purity：</span><br>
Ugh, this annoying voice, it's them. The amount of data that's flowing it, there's no way I'm mistaken.<br>
I wonder if my personality program malfunctioned due to being connected to that strange Mirror Sea?<br>
Tester as well. Tessy? The ruler of time and space? Lame. It wasn't that Purifier, and it wasn't a poem.<br>
... Okay, cleanup starting up, personality program reinstalling, checking all files, and synchronizing data.<br>
......<br>
"*Sigh*, well, since the termination of that abnormal Mirror Sea, the Siren network has been restored, so I should start returning to the repository."<br>
"It was fun fighting alongside you."<br>
"I won't say something like that. There. The next time we meet, we'll definitely be enemies, so go back to home base and go write reports to your death or something."<br>
"With that said, peace."<br>
... Well, I guess that's it. I guess I'll start to be overwritten by my previous personality program.<br>
..... So in the end, am I a "machine body," or am I a "piece"...<br>
It's a pain to think about... Sigh... I'm... tired...<br>

<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ayanami：</span><br>
Purifier went and disappeared at some point.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Tokino Sora：</span><br>
I wonder if it's really all over this time...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Z23：</span><br>
Even if it was a Siren with abnormal circumstances, it really was a good chance to get to know the enemy... It would have been nice if I could have gamed some more at the Resistance base.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Zuikaku：</span><br>
Mm, jeez. It's unusual for me, but I've gotta agree with you... Well, you're right in that if all Sirens were like that, we wouldn't have to fight them.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Murasaki Shion：</span><br>
Because they were a comrade who fought alongside us. Even if it's another Siren, if they're a good guy, they you should be friends with them.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Shirakami Fubuki：</span><br>
…………<br>
Once we leave this area, we'll need to find a way back.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Z23：</span><br>
If it's that, the Commander and Akashi back at home base might know of some way of helping you guys out.<br>
<br>
Beep Beep Beep!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Javelin：</span><br>
I'm getting a reaction from the transmission machine! Communications have been restored!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Shoukaku：</span><br>
Zuikaku? Zuikaku, are you alright?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Zuikaku：</span><br>
It's Shoukaku!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Shoukaku：</span><br>
That's good! Your communications must have finally been restored! Is everyone in the fleet alright?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Zuikaku：</span><br>
Gosh, being stuck in this Mirror Sea for several made me feel super lonely!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Shoukaku：</span><br>
For several days? What do you mean?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Z23：</span><br>
Umm, while we were on convoy duty while returning from a commission mission, we got sucked up into the Mirror Sea that suddenly popped up.<br>
After searching around the Mirror Sea for several days, we were just now able to destroy the equipment responsible for the area and finally recovered our communications.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Shoukaku：</span><br>
Is that so...? Has it really been that long since we've lost contact with you...?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Javelin：</span><br>
E-Eh?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Shirakami Fubuki：</span><br>
Is it possible that this phenomenon resulted in a different flow of time inside the Mirror Sea compared to outside of it?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Akashi：</span><br>
That's impossible, nya. The laws of space would be broken, nya.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Z23：</span><br>
Either way, it seems like it really happened... It seems that I really do need to study this Mirror Sea incident.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Shoukaku：</span><br>
Come to think of it, the people around you are...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Zuikaku：</span><br>
Ah, these girls are members of an organization called Hololive... Anyway, these girls are comrades who came from the other world that got entangled with ours and arrived here.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Akashi：</span><br>
Comrades who arrived from another world - isn't this a common trope, nya?<br>
Well, if you mumble about the Siren equipment that was left in the area the Mirror Sea appeared in, it'll work out somehow!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Shoukaku：</span><br>
Guys, hurry up and come back~ Everyone's worried about you, you know?<br>
Ah, and one more thing...<br>
You guys did a great job. And, welcome to our world~<br>
