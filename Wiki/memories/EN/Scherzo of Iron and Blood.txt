First Movement<br>
<br>
Sunrise<br>
<span style="color:#ffde38;">Bismarck：</span><br>
Attention, all Iron Blood personnel!<br>
We have conserved every bit of our energy and every ounce of our undying will for this day.<br>
We have let many fine opportunities slip by us, and we have been subjugated to bitter experience after bitter experience.<br>
But now our rigorous trials have ended, and it is time to show the world the strength of our resolve!<br>
The unyielding soldier shall never know true failure!<br>
And the truth lies only within the range of our cannons!<br>
From this point onwards, we will pay no heed to deception, debate, and other such cheap parlor tricks!<br>
We shall expand our lands with the might of our black iron and the courage of our crimson blood!<br>
We shall fight for our fatherland! We shall march onward, and we shall be victorious!<br>
This is the principle on which the Iron Blood fleet and the Crimson Axis will survive!<br>
Victory to us! Long live Iron Blood!<br>
<span style="color:#ffde38;">The Fleet：</span><br>
VICTORY TO US!<br>
LONG LIVE IRON BLOOD!<br>

<br>
Second Movement<br>
<br>
Backworldsmen<br>
Mission area, location undisclosed - Early dawn<br>
<span style="color:#ffde38;">Prinz Eugen：</span><br>
So, in summary, Hood is out of commission and Wales fled southeast. And now it's gotten very quiet.<br>
Bismarck, could we slow down a little? It's pretty unpleasant to cruise at full speed on these harsh waves.<br>
The situation with Hood has put the Royal Navy in disarray, so even if somebody comes after us, they'll probably be lagging behind.<br>
<span style="color:#ffde38;">Bismarck：</span><br>
Don't underestimate them. I doubt the Royal Navy would stand on the sidelines and wait around after what happened.<br>
<span style="color:#ffde38;">Prinz Eugen：</span><br>
……………<br>
How are your injuries? I know you used your power, but even so...<br>
<span style="color:#ffde38;">Bismarck：</span><br>
I'm fine. They're little more than a passing thought in my mind in comparison to the imminent threat of the Royal Navy.<br>
<span style="color:#ffde38;">Prinz Eugen：</span><br>
If you say so. But spare me the tough girl act, please.<br>
<span style="color:#ffde38;">Bismarck：</span><br>
Eugen, stay in formation.<br>
<span style="color:#ffde38;">Prinz Eugen：</span><br>
Sorry, no can do. I'm running on fumes. You should take a moment to catch your own breath, too.<br>
<span style="color:#ffde38;">Bismarck：</span><br>
Eugen, you...!<br>
<span style="color:#ffde38;">Prinz Eugen：</span><br>
Is it not my duty to stop my leader from making reckless decisions?<br>
<span style="color:#ffde38;">Bismarck：</span><br>
... I must say, nobody interjects better than you at times like this, Eugen.<br>
<span style="color:#ffde38;">Prinz Eugen：</span><br>
Thanks, I suppose.<br>

<span style="color:#ffde38;">Prinz Eugen：</span><br>
Oh, what's this? Were you rats looking for cheese, but found us instead?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Norfolk：</span><br>
G-good heavens, they've detected us!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Suffolk：</span><br>
Oh, shoot! Quick, we must send a telegram immediately!<br>
<span style="color:#ffde38;">Prinz Eugen：</span><br>
Bismarck, mind if I have a bit of fun with our pursuers?<br>
<span style="color:#ffde38;">Bismarck：</span><br>
Permission granted. Send them scampering.<br>
... But don't overextend yourself. They know where we are.<br>
We must avoid spreading our forces too thin.<br>
<span style="color:#ffde38;">Prinz Eugen：</span><br>
Heheheh, got it~<br>

{{折叠面板|标题=A Race Against Time|选项=4|主框=1|样式=primary|展开=是}}
<span style="color:#ffde38;">Prinz Eugen：</span><br>
I drove 'em off. They're not showing up on my radar, so they must've run off home to mama.<br>
So, now what? Shouldn't we be coming across a Royal Navy main fleet any second now?<br>
<span style="color:#ffde38;">Bismarck：</span><br>
Eugen...<br>
<span style="color:#ffde38;">Prinz Eugen：</span><br>
Yeah?<br>
<span style="color:#ffde38;">Bismarck：</span><br>
My injuries are worse than I thought. I can't continue this operation until I've had repairs. We're heading back to base.<br>
<span style="color:#ffde38;">Prinz Eugen：</span><br>
Are you... sure about that? Even if we head straight for it, it's a long way to go.<br>
<span style="color:#ffde38;">Bismarck：</span><br>
I'll head straight back to port. You continue the mission.<br>
<span style="color:#ffde38;">Prinz Eugen：</span><br>
You mean, on your own? I'd be lying if I said that sounds like a good idea.<br>
<span style="color:#ffde38;">Bismarck：</span><br>
My route is through friendly waters. It would be difficult even for the Royal Navy to attempt any kind of attack there.<br>
<span style="color:#ffde38;">Prinz Eugen：</span><br>
Ah, Vichia's waters... I guess you thought this through after all.<br>
<span style="color:#ffde38;">Bismarck：</span><br>
... I've given you orders, and you will follow them. I will not tolerate any more narcissistic behavior on your part.<br>
<span style="color:#ffde38;">Prinz Eugen：</span><br>
………<br>
All right, I'll do as you say. The circumstances are extraordinary, after all.<br>
<span style="color:#ffde38;">Bismarck：</span><br>
We have no time to waste. Depart at once.<br>
And maintain top speed. Don't stop for anything until you've reached safe waters.<br>
Lastly, I will remind you once more: this is a direct order from the leader of the Iron Blood fleet.<br>
<span style="color:#ffde38;">Prinz Eugen：</span><br>
Understood. I wish you good luck.<br>
<span style="color:#ffde38;">Bismarck：</span><br>
Same to you. May the God of war be with you.<br>
... Victory to us.<br>
<span style="color:#ffde38;">Prinz Eugen：</span><br>
... And long live Iron Blood.<br>

<br>
Third Movement<br>
<br>
Great Longing<br>
<span style="color:#ffde38;">Bismarck：</span><br>
... I have no reason to listen to a single word from you Sirens.<br>
<span style="color:#ec5d53;">Observer：</span><br>
Ahahaha~ Be silent and listen carefully, you insignificant being.<br>
<span style="color:#ffde38;">Bismarck：</span><br>
How dare you...!<br>
<span style="color:#ec5d53;">Observer：</span><br>
If this continues, Iron Blood will cease to exist in this world, too.<br>
Your enemies will hurt those you wish to protect, steal your riches, and make your oceans their own.<br>
I suppose one would call it a humiliating defeat, no?<br>
None of your comrades will be spared of the bitter taste of this defeat. Especially not your dear sister Tirpitz... Ahaha...<br>
You don't want to suffer another Article 231, do you?<br>
<span style="color:#ffde38;">Bismarck：</span><br>
Silence!<br>
The Iron Blood is not so brittle that it would crumble from a few isolated defeats!<br>
We will seize victory and eradicate you once more, you despicable enemies of humankind!<br>
<span style="color:#ec5d53;">Observer：</span><br>
Ahaha... Let me tell you something I once heard from a human...<br>
"Humankind, much like a tree, wishes to grow to reach the clouds; the light; the Heavens. As its branches grow, its roots do, too. Deeper and deeper into the ground; into darkness; towards Hell."<br>
And is it not the light that you desire?<br>
<span style="color:#ffde38;">Bismarck：</span><br>
I have no more to say to you... Main guns, feuer!<br>
<span style="color:#ec5d53;">Observer：</span><br>
With this little power, your wish hasn't the slightest chance of being granted.<br>
Think about it. Just what do YOU have that WE want?<br>
Your inferior technology? Your nonexistent resources? Your waters, which we've already claimed for ourselves?<br>
You have nothing, not a single thing worthy of our interest.<br>
<span style="color:#ffde38;">Bismarck：</span><br>
…………<br>
<span style="color:#ec5d53;">Observer：</span><br>
Just the Royal Navy alone is many times powerful than you. If they so wanted, they could keep your trade routes blockaded in perpetuity...<br>
If you'd realize that it's they, not us, who are threatening your existence, then you'd be able to understand the situation.<br>
You may not believe it, but unlike those hypocrites who only pay lip service to the idea of liberty and justice, we will actually hold you in high regards.<br>
Which is why I gave you the key to your future. But how you use it is up to you...<br>
Whether this forbidden power leads to a bright new future for you and your comrades or a tragic repeat of the sorrowful demise you've known before, all depends on you.<br>
... I assure you, we will meet again. Ahahaha...<br>
<span style="color:#ffde38;">Bismarck：</span><br>
... Throughout the whole ordeal, I was trembling.<br>
Such power, vast beyond measure. There was never any room for discussion, let alone debate... I had no choice but to accept the power.<br>
Chancellor... if you were in my place, what would you do...?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Victorious：</span><br>
Ahah, I've discovered Bismarck! May I scramble my planes?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">King George V：</span><br>
Certainly. Permission granted. Show her the might of our aircraft carriers.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Victorious：</span><br>
Understood! This is Victorious, commencing plane launch! God save the Queen!<br>

<span style="color:#ffde38;">Bismarck：</span><br>
Are these... aircraft?<br>
If only Graf Zeppelin were here to... No, this is no time to grumble.<br>
Such a puny airstrike could never sink an Iron Blood battleship!<br>
Anti-air guns, focus fire on the enemy aircraft squadrons!<br>
FEUER!<br>

<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Victorious：</span><br>
Direct hit on Bismarck confirmed! ... Hold on, it didn't have any effect on her speed!<br>
Once I've recovered my aircraft, I'll prepare a second strike! Just you wait, Bismarck!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">King George V：</span><br>
Hahahah! Well done, Victorious!<br>
(... If she can maintain her speed in spite of her injuries, she must be a terribly powerful battleship.)<br>
(And if she manages to seek refuge in Vichian waters, the going will get tough for us.)<br>
(We must slow her down through any means necessary...!)<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Victorious：</span><br>
I received a message that Force H should be arriving soon! They'll make contact with Bismarck in 30 minutes!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">King George V：</span><br>
So, all of the Royal Navy's most capable ships are in pursuit.<br>
The Royal Family's honour hinges upon us. We shall sink Bismarck!<br>

<br>
Fourth Movement<br>
<br>
Passion, Joy, and Suffering<br>
<span style="color:#ffde38;">U-556：</span><br>
Captain Bismarck! Captain Bismarck, please wait!<br>
<span style="color:#ffde38;">Bismarck：</span><br>
Ah, the little submarine. Good morning to you.<br>
<span style="color:#ffde38;">U-556：</span><br>
Hey, um! Your performance yesterday was absolutely fantastic, and I will never ever in my whole life forget it!<br>
<span style="color:#ffde38;">Bismarck：</span><br>
…………<br>
<span style="color:#ffde38;">U-556：</span><br>
A-also! Captain Bismarck, I was hoping I could ask you for a small little favor!<br>
<span style="color:#ffde38;">Bismarck：</span><br>
What would that be?<br>
<span style="color:#ffde38;">U-556：</span><br>
T-thank you for hearing me out! You see, I just entered service today! I was hoping you could, uh...<br>
Like in one of my fairy tales! "Starting today, U-556 shall gallop across the seas, much like the honorable knight Sir Parzival did!" ... H-how does that sound?<br>
<span style="color:#ffde38;">Bismarck：</span><br>
Congratulations. Do your utmost in servitude to Iron Blood.<br>
<span style="color:#ffde38;">U-556：</span><br>
No, no, I meant, like... Um, I know this is reeeeaaally improper of me to ask, and I'm sorry for even considering being so rude as to do it anyway, but...<br>
I was hoping you could give me your blessings! If so, I'd be able to push myself to my absolute limits in my missions on the front!<br>
<span style="color:#ffde38;">Bismarck：</span><br>
……………<br>
<span style="color:#ffde38;">U-556：</span><br>
I-I know! I'll show you my special trick!<br>
Look! It's a water handstand!<br>
<br>
U-556 did a backflip and plunged deep below the water.<br>
<span style="color:#ffde38;">Bismarck：</span><br>
... Pffft...<br>
<br>
The strange yet humorous trick was able to bring a smile even to Bismarck's lips.<br>
<span style="color:#ffde38;">U-556：</span><br>
Captain... Bismarck?<br>
<span style="color:#ffde38;">Bismarck：</span><br>
Pardon, I'm just a little awestruck by how different you are to everyone else I've met.<br>
<span style="color:#ffde38;">U-556：</span><br>
I've heard from some people that you're really reserved and hard to approach, Captain Bismarck...<br>
But that's not the case at all... You don't have trouble talking even to a submarine like me! In fact, you're actually really friendly!<br>
<span style="color:#ffde38;">Bismarck：</span><br>
(... Is that... how people view me? That's... rather disheartening.)<br>
<br>
The thought of it made Bismarck's smile disappear. She turned to U-556, whose head was poking out of the water, to say her goodbyes.<br>
<span style="color:#ffde38;">Bismarck：</span><br>
I've heard your wish. Now then, if you'll excuse me.<br>
<br>
Bismarck departed, leaving U-556 all to herself.<br>
Then, on the following day...<br>
<span style="color:#ffde38;">U-557：</span><br>
556, what's the matter? ... You don't look very happy.<br>
<span style="color:#ffde38;">U-556：</span><br>
Well...<br>
Captain Bismarck promised she'd come back to give her blessings, but she's still not back yet...<br>
<span style="color:#ffde38;">U-557：</span><br>
Captain Bismarck is probably very busy... I doubt she'd remember a promise like that...<br>
<span style="color:#ffde38;">U-556：</span><br>
Yeah... you're right. I'll have to prove myself in battle, that way Captain Bismarck will one day bestow me with the Knight's Cross with Oak Leaves...<br>
That's it! The Knight's Cross with Oak Leaves! That's only fitting for me, Parzival of The Seas!<br>
I've formed a plan, and I'm gonna execute it! Submarine U-556, setting sa...<br>
<br>
U-556 noticed there were Manjuu gathering just within her sight. Then, a familiar face approached her...<br>
<span style="color:#ffde38;">Bismarck：</span><br>
One of our newest Iron Blood comrades will soon head into her first battle.<br>
Though she may be small, her talents and reliability are second to none.<br>
Now I, Bismarck, as the representative of the Iron Blood fleet, shall offer her my blessings!<br>
Submarine U-556! Your success shall echo to the ends of the earth, and your reputation shall invoke fear within our enemies! May the God of war be with you!<br>
Fanfare band, begin!<br>
<br>
The band made up of Manjuu began playing a song which wishes success to a soldier departing to the front.<br>
The largest battleship in all of the world was offering her blessings to a small submarine.<br>
<span style="color:#ffde38;">U-556：</span><br>
Captain Bismarck...!<br>
<br>
Standing before Bismarck, the woman she adored, U-556 was determined to say one thing.<br>
<span style="color:#ffde38;">U-556：</span><br>
Captain Bismarck, i-if you'll please forgive me, I have one more favor to ask...<br>
<span style="color:#ffde38;">Bismarck：</span><br>
My, you're a greedy child. What favor do you ask of me?<br>
<span style="color:#ffde38;">U-556：</span><br>
Please... allow me to call you "Lord"!<br>
<span style="color:#ffde38;">Bismarck：</span><br>
... Huh?<br>
<br>
Not even Bismarck could help being confused by this unexpected request.<br>
<span style="color:#ffde38;">U-556：</span><br>
It's to express my gratitude and respect for you! ... Um, may I please call you "Lord Bismarck"?<br>
<span style="color:#ffde38;">Bismarck：</span><br>
Well... I suppose why not.<br>
<span style="color:#ffde38;">U-556：</span><br>
L-Lord Bismarck! I'm incredibly grateful!<br>
<span style="color:#ffde38;">Bismarck：</span><br>
(... Dear me...) <br>
<br>
(Nobody has ever called me something that flattering before... a-am I blushing?)<br>
<span style="color:#ffde38;">U-556：</span><br>
Ah, also, I was hoping I could give you this before I depart, Lord Bismarck!<br>
<br>
U-556 took out a slip of paper and handed it to Bismarck.<br>
<span style="color:#ffde38;">Bismarck：</span><br>
What's this...?<br>
<span style="color:#ffde38;">U-556：</span><br>
It's a certificate of sponsorship which I wrote yesterday!<br>
I hereby pledge always to protect Lord Bismarck, no matter when and no matter where!<br>
<br>
Bismarck's lips gently parted, after which she turned to U-556 and nodded.<br>
<span style="color:#ffde38;">U-556：</span><br>
Ah, sorry, I forgot! I have to sortie now! ... Lord Bismarck, I must take my leave!<br>
We'll have to talk more next time! ... U-556, weighing anchor!<br>
<br>
U-556 got on her rigging and joined U-557 as they disembarked from the port.<br>
<span style="color:#ffde38;">Bismarck：</span><br>
So she has a little sister... Isn't that nice...<br>
…………<br>
I wonder if Tirpitz is okay...<br>
<br>
I, U-556, hereby declare before Neptune, Lord over oceans, seas, lakes, rivers, brooks, ponds, and rivulets,<br>
that I will provide any desired assistance to my ally and Lord, battleship Bismarck,<br>
at any place on the water, under water, on land, or in the air.<br>
Signed: U-556, Parzival of The Seas<br>
At the bottom, U-556 had made a drawing of herself towing her Lord Bismarck back to port.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Renown：</span><br>
I am Renown, battlecruiser of the Royal Navy's Force H! I am here because of your ambush on our ships! Cease your meaningless resistance at once!<br>
<span style="color:#ffde38;">Bismarck：</span><br>
Gah...! These new recruits of theirs...!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Renown：</span><br>
The Royal Family's most capable ships are heading this way en masse! I will not let you flee!<br>
<span style="color:#ffde38;">Bismarck：</span><br>
... It seems there's one thing you've forgotten.<br>
A confrontation may slow me down, but I have the advantage in this situation!<br>
I'm afraid I'll have to deal with you! Engines, full speed ahead!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ark Royal：</span><br>
She's resisting, just as I figured she would!<br>
Let's do precisely what King George V said and slow her down!<br>
Swordfishes, launch! Capture Bismarck!<br>

<span style="color:#ffde38;">Bismarck：</span><br>
It's time to put an end to this!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ark Royal：</span><br>
You're not going anywhere! 818 Squadron, take aim!<br>
<span style="color:#ffde38;">Bismarck：</span><br>
Torpedoes... from my blind spot...?!<br>
I won't... be able to avoid them in time...!<br>
They damaged my propeller...? No... they hit my rigging?<br>
Ah, I underestimated your biplanes, and so this happened... I have failed...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ark Royal：</span><br>
Report to all nearby Royal Navy ships: Bismarck is losing manoeuvrability! Repeat: Bismarck is losing manoeuvrability!<br>
Relaying coordinates now! Send reinforcements ASAP!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Renown：</span><br>
It's as Ark Royal said, Bismarck. Your manoeuvrability has taken a critical hit! Cease your meaningless resistance at once!<br>
<span style="color:#ffde38;">Bismarck：</span><br>
…………<br>
... No.<br>
This will not be where I meet my end...!<br>
Even though I've failed in my mission, even though I've lost my maneuverability...<br>
I still have comrades I must protect, and a dream I must make true...!<br>
I still have my power...!<br>
And as long as I have my resolve and ammunition to fire...<br>
I will fight to the last shell!<br>
Long live Iron Blood!<br>

<span style="color:#ffde38;">Bismarck：</span><br>
So, is this how the Royal Navy does things, O "Sailor King?"<br>
Even in the face of our bloody retribution, you still insist on suppressing your fighting instict to resort to cheap rhetoric.<br>
Tell me... You may be cutting edge warships, but do your hearts even know the thrill of battle?<br>

Hahaha! It's been a long time since someone has called me that...<br>

Sixth Movement<br>
<br>
Of Science and Learning<br>
<span style="color:#ec5d53;">Tester：</span><br>
Miss Bismarck... You almost lost your life, and yet you still refuse to use "that?"<br>
<span style="color:#ffde38;">Bismarck：</span><br>
I don't need help from the likes of you...<br>
<span style="color:#ec5d53;">Tester：</span><br>
Still acting tough even in this condition? You could have sent your enemies to the bottom of the sea so easily. All you needed was a little bit of... determination.<br>
<span style="color:#ffde38;">Bismarck：</span><br>
After dueling with Hood, I had a realization.<br>
Winning with such an unfair advantage would not bring us glory at all...<br>
I knew nothing then, except that I had allowed the abyss to gaze back into me.<br>
Even now, that heart of darkness eats away at my Wisdom Cube...<br>
It plays an endless scherzo, constantly jeering at me from within my own mind.<br>
It beckons me to give in to its violence.<br>
<span style="color:#ec5d53;">Tester：</span><br>
... ...<br>
<span style="color:#ffde38;">Bismarck：</span><br>
I had Eugen leave because there is no telling what will become of me.<br>
But I now know that it is time to end this farce.<br>
<span style="color:#ec5d53;">Tester：</span><br>
Uploading Report: Results of Experiment No. 151 - Negative. Status: Statistically Insignificant. Requesting further directives.<br>
<span style="color:#ec5d53;">？？？：</span><br>
Received. Recommendation: Execute Reconversion Agreement.<br>
<br>
Kaboom!<br>
(Bismarck turned her last remaining battery and aimed at Tester, who was still transmitting her message.)<br>
<span style="color:#ffde38;">Bismarck：</span><br>
My loyalties are not to some weapon, but to the people of the Iron Blood.<br>
For the glory of the Iron Blood!!<br>
<span style="color:#ec5d53;">Tester：</span><br>
...<br>
Issuing Errata to Experiment No. 151 - Test subject has opened fire upon Self.<br>
<span style="color:#ec5d53;">？？？：</span><br>
Finally, some excitement! I was starting to get bored here! Next, Execute Awakening Protocol.<br>
<span style="color:#ec5d53;">Tester：</span><br>
Understood. Regarding the Agreement–<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">King George V：</span><br>
Rodney, give me a damage report!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Rodney：</span><br>
I've begun damage control. Battery A has been destroyed, but I'm still operational.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">King George V：</span><br>
Excellent. We won't let our enemies get away from us, Siren or Iron Blood.<br>

<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Renown：</span><br>
Members of the Royal Fleet, Battlecruiser Renown has come to assist you! Fire!!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ark Royal：</span><br>
Ark Royal, reporting in! Let's finish this battle before my excort fleets' curfew!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Victorious：</span><br>
Everyone, Victorious is here! Now our victory is assured!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ark Royal & Victorious：</span><br>
Swordfish, launch!!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">King George V：</span><br>
I'm counting on you two to get us air superiority! Rodney and I will look for ways to break through their defenses. Don't let any enemies slip through our guard!<br>
<br>
————<br>
<span style="color:#ec5d53;">Tester：</span><br>
Ahaha, look at you Royal slobs just barge in one after another! Where's that vaunted "decorum" of yours now?<br>
Disgusting! Utterly tactless...!<br>
<br>
————<br>
<span style="color:#ec5d53;">Tester：</span><br>
......<br>
(The situation is slightly abnormal. The heat signatures of all units exceed the normal range.)<br>
(Could this be a result of the Awakening Protocol?)<br>
Host, are you currently seeing this situation?<br>
<br>
————<br>
<span style="color:#ec5d53;">Tester：</span><br>
Requesting permission to commence full testing of the Awakening Protocol.<br>
<span style="color:#ec5d53;">？？？：</span><br>
Beep... beep... beep... (the signal continues to flicker)<br>
<span style="color:#ec5d53;">Tester：</span><br>
The signal... was lost?<br>
... ...<br>
No matter... I can't let this opportunity pass by. I'll carve you all up and analyze your Wisdom Cubes!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">King George V：</span><br>
The Siren's movements have slowed. Now is our chance – chaaaaaarge!!<br>
<br>
————<br>
<span style="color:#ec5d53;">Tester：</span><br>
Yes, yes! The readings are growing even more... Come, let me see your hatred! Let it all out!<br>
<br>
Booomm————<br>
(The sky trembled with a chorus of cannonfire, pillars of water erupting one after another as if conducting the Royal Fleet's salvo of shells and torpedoes)<br>
The sea water that fell like rain around the Siren sizzled and turned into mist, repelled by an enormous energy flow.<br>
Soon, a thick mist began to spread across the battlefield.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ark Royal：</span><br>
There's suddenly been a change in the weather! We can't see anything, nor can the recon planes... No, we've lost sight of Bismarck!<br>
<span style="color:#ec5d53;">Tester：</span><br>
... ...<br>
The history of human evolution... is the chronicle of technology and learning.<br>
For the sake of learning, no sacrifice is too great to make...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">King George V：</span><br>
What is this ominous presence... No way...<br>
Everyone, emergency manoeuvres!!!<br>
(------)<br>
<br>
A massive beam of light penetrated through the mist, a massive funnel of wind following in its wake.<br>
In the blink of an eye, it melted through King George V's armor, leaving a gaping hole.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">King George V：</span><br>
Bismarck, what have you done...<br>
Stay alert, everyone!<br>

Seventh Movement<br>
<br>
The Convalescent<br>
<span style="color:#ffde38;">Bismarck：</span><br>
Ahahahahaha~!!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">King George V：</span><br>
Ugh! My armour...<br>
Watch out! This is no ordinary cannon that we're up against!<br>
(Unbelievable... it melted through battleship armor just like that...)<br>
<span style="color:#ec5d53;">Bismarck：</span><br>
... ...<br>
<br>
As the mist began to settle, Bismarck gradually came back into view, but she was different from before.<br>
Surrounding her was a ghastly black and red aura, pulsing ominously as if oozing blood.<br>
Tester was nowhere to be found.<br>
<span style="color:#ec5d53;">Bismarck：</span><br>
A great man once said...<br>
There is no God in this world. Even if there was, I would have slain him with my own hands!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">King George V：</span><br>
You've finally shown your true colors, Iron Blood battleship!<br>
For a moment there, I almost thought you had some honour as a warrior.<br>
Turns out, my concerns were wasted on the likes of you.<br>
We of the Royal Navy will never sacrifice our dignity out of fear of death or failure, but you threw away yours so easily.<br>
Whether you deem yourself to believe in God or the sun matters not to me.<br>
All you need to know is that we will put an end to you and your plot.<br>

<span style="color:#4eb24e;">King George V：</span><br>
I've finally managed to get in range.<br>
So this is how you managed to defeat Hood from such a long range.<br>
Isn't that right, Bismarck?<br>
<span style="color:#ec5d53;">Bismarck：</span><br>
... ...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">King George V：</span><br>
Draw your sword. We'll settle it mano a mano, you honourless madwoman.<br>
<span style="color:#ec5d53;">Bismarck：</span><br>
Honor... huh?<br>
......<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">King George V：</span><br>
Royal fleet, cover me! Don't let anything get in my way!<br>
<br>

<span style="color:#ec5d53;">Bismarck：</span><br>
Aha... Haha... Ahahahahaha!!!<br>
<br>
————<br>
Bismarck cackled as a massive ring of light began to contract around her, dragging countless Siren ships into her core and crushing them into dust.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">King George V：</span><br>
She's... absorbing the entire Siren fleet?!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Rodney：</span><br>
Is she going berserk? There's no way she can handle all this power!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ark Royal：</span><br>
Watch out! She's aiming towards the center of our formation!!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">King George V：</span><br>
We won't be able to dodge in time! Brace for impact, everyone!!<br>
<br>
Boom——<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">King George V：</span><br>
……<br>
…<br>
What...? I'm still alive...?<br>
<br>
(Instead of unleashing all the energy she had stored, Bismarck dissipated it in a huge explosion.)<br>
(When the smoke cleared, half of her rigging had been blown away.)<br>
<span style="color:#ffde38;">Bismarck：</span><br>
*cough* *cough* ...What...<br>
Is this the limit of your so-called power...<br>
<span style="color:#ec5d53;">Tester：</span><br>
To think that you'd attempt to self-destruct... Ahh, turns out we weren't able to synchronize with your Wisdom Cube after all...<br>
<span style="color:#ffde38;">Bismarck：</span><br>
Heh... even though I thought I had the resolve to wield this power...<br>
All it took was a moment...<br>
For it to completely consume me.<br>
<span style="color:#ec5d53;">Tester：</span><br>
……<br>
Uploading Report: Results of Experiment No. 151 - Test subject managed to forcefully eject from the Awakening Protocol. While statistically significant, overall performance failed to reach target benchmarks.<br>
<span style="color:#ffde38;">Bismarck：</span><br>
I don't know what you're plotting, Siren...<br>
But whatever it is, I won't allow you to defile my honor and glory any longer!<br>
……<br>
Proud warriors of the Royal Navy... Though our grudge goes back many moons, I regret to inform you...<br>
I have no intention of falling into your hands today.<br>
The Iron Blood shall seize our own destiny!<br>
LONG LIVE IRON BLOOD!<br>
<br>
Bismarck fired her very last shot in the direction of the Royal fleet.<br>
Since her fire control had been completely destroyed, the shell crashed harmlessly into the water well before it reached the fleet.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Victorious：</span><br>
She has no ability to fight us anymore. I'm not sure I want to finish her off...<br>
But why is she so persistent...?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">King George V：</span><br>
I take back what I said about you before. If that is the decision you've made...<br>
We shall send you off with our warmest regards.<br>
All members of the Royal Navy<br>
Focus all of your firepower upon Bismarck!<br>
<br>
Boom——<br>
<span style="color:#ffde38;">Bismarck：</span><br>
（…………）<br>
(... In the end, I was still unable... to achieve our aspirations...)<br>
(Ah... I can finally become one with the ocean again...)<br>
(My beloved Iron Blood...)<br>
No... not yet...!<br>
<span style="color:#ec5d53;">Observer：</span><br>
Don't tell me you're having second thoughts now, Bismarck?<br>
<span style="color:#ffde38;">Bismarck：</span><br>
Tell me, Siren, of all those infinite possibilities that you saw, were there any that...<br>
<span style="color:#ec5d53;">Observer：</span><br>
Of course not. Not a single one.<br>
<span style="color:#ffde38;">Bismarck：</span><br>
……<br>
<span style="color:#ec5d53;">Observer：</span><br>
We have been observing humanity for thousands of years. Your existence is but a drop of water in the ocean of data. <br>
You are so small, so insignificant. Even if I was to tell you, you do not even have the power to choose your own destiny.<br>
Your only purpose in life was to wage war meaninglessly and sink meaninglessly.<br>
No matter how many times we re-simulate this battle, the course of history will not change even if you survive.<br>
<span style="color:#ffde38;">Bismarck：</span><br>
You're sorely mistaken<br>
What happens to me is of no significance. Tell me what happens to the Iron Blood...<br>
Tell me what happens to our people... to my compatriots... and to my sister.<br>
Tell me if their future can be saved.<br>
<span style="color:#ec5d53;">Observer：</span><br>
……<br>
What a pitiful specimen you are. Of all the things you could have asked about, you chose the ones with the lowest priority.<br>
Hypothetically, if there was a way to save your people, would you be able to shoulder that burden, O Great Fleet Leader?<br>
<span style="color:#ffde38;">Bismarck：</span><br>
I would die trying.<br>
My idea of "self" died the day I was given the name of Bismarck. I live only to protect the Iron Blood, and would gladly give my life for my people.<br>
Not once have I feared facing my fate.<br>
<span style="color:#ec5d53;">Observer：</span><br>
Hahaha...! I've changed my mind. Let us see you dance once more as you try to turn the cogs of fate by yourself. <br>
Use our power. Show us how you are able to reshape this world.<br>
If you are able to transcend your limitations as "Bismarck" and become one with your "alter ego," perhaps then you may find your answer...<br>
Until then... we shall be awaiting your little dance.<br>
<span style="color:#ffde38;">Bismarck：</span><br>
Discipline is our Iron, and glory is our Blood.<br>
At long last... we of the Iron Blood are free to choose our own fate...<br>
<br>
KABOOM---!<br>
<span style="color:#ffde38;">Bismarck：</span><br>
You once said that,<br>
Music can evoke two very different desires within people. One is the desire for the rapture of war, and the other is the desire for an idyllic tranquility.<br>
I'm finally able to experience that tranquility...<br>
Ahh... am I getting... sleepy?<br>
<br>
(My sister... I'm sorry that... I won't ever be able to meet you...)<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Rodney：</span><br>
It's finally over...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Victorious：</span><br>
……<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">King George V：</span><br>
Yes, the Sirens have disappeared without a trace. The victory is ours today.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Renown：</span><br>
But... it was a costly one.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">King George V：</span><br>
……<br>
Members of the Royal Navy, together, we have finally put an end to a powerful foe who has long threatened our waters.<br>
During this battle, our enemies fought tenacity and an indomitable spirit.<br>
My hope is that one day, should any of you find yourselves outnumbered against a superior enemy, you will fight with the same tenacity that you witnessed today.<br>
Carry forth the fighting spirit of the Royal Navy!<br>
God save the Queen!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Crowd：</span><br>
God save the Queen!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">King George V：</span><br>
Well, everyone, let's go home! Make sure to inspect any damage thoroughly and get repairs as necessary.<br>

Gods preserve us! Lord Bismarck is in trouble!<br>
Let's ride! All ahead full!<br>
Chaaaaaarge!<br>
Please hold on, Lord Bismarck!<br>
Hold on, I'm coming to save you! ...Lord Bismarck?<br>
<br>
I, U-556, hereby declare before Neptune, Lord over oceans, seas, lakes, rivers, brooks, ponds, and rivulets,<br>

that I will provide any desired assistance to my ally and Lord, battleship Bismarck,<br>

Heh heh. I am the great Parzival of the Seas! Winner of the Knight's Cross with Oak Leaves, U-556 herself!<br>
I bid you good morning, Lady Tirpitz~<br>
<span style="color:#ec5d53;">Tirpitz：</span><br>
L-Lady...? And just what is that title supposed to mean?!<br>
If I catch you misbehaving again, you'll answer to the military police!<br>
<span style="color:#ec5d53;">U-556：</span><br>
Heh heh heh... It'll be a cold day in hell when those pigs can catch The Lucky 556!<br>
Here, Lady Tirpitz, you give it a shot. See if you can chase me~<br>
<span style="color:#ec5d53;">Tirpitz：</span><br>
What?<br>
<br>
U-556 did a graceful, if a bit silly, backflip into the harbor.）<br>
<span style="color:#ec5d53;">Tirpitz：</span><br>
Get back here, you!!<br>
<br>
Tirpitz seethed with anger at the submerged U-556, popping blood vessels on her forehead.）<br>
<span style="color:#ec5d53;">U-556：</span><br>
Hehehe, chalk up another win for 556!<br>
Your little sister is so like you in so many ways, Lord Bismarck.）<br>

They have once again failed to break the Awakening Protocol.~<br>
<span style="color:#ec5d53;">Tester：</span><br>
That is a disappointment, but think of all the sweet, juicy data we've collected.<br>
But why did you choose Bismarck as your guinea pig? There are so many other, much more suitable "catalysts".<br>
<span style="color:#ec5d53;">Observer：</span><br>
The defeat of the Iron Blood was a foregone conclusion.<br>
But no matter how obvious I made it, no matter how many hints I dropped, she refused to be swayed from her course.<br>
And this is precisely the kind of mind I wanted to study - one which defied all our statistical models. She could have been the key to a successful "Awakening," the "Vector" that would usher forth a new future.<br>
There was one who could hear the Song of Ragnarok, and began her lonely dance.<br>
To those who could not hear the music, the dancer seemed a madman.<br>
She was that dancer. The one who dances in the face of her fate, doomed to never become The Sun.<br>
<span style="color:#ec5d53;">Tester：</span><br>
... You're talking more and more like the humans of this era.<br>
<span style="color:#ec5d53;">Observer：</span><br>
I've had a lot of free time to decode the documents of this ancient civilization. I suppose you could say I've been inspired.<br>
Besides, collecting the artistic heritage of each period is also one of our core functions.<br>
<span style="color:#ec5d53;">Tester：</span><br>
…<br>
Anyway, I've just received a new message.<br>
Work is nearly complete in Sector C3 of the Mirror Seas, we just need to prioritize distribution of the testing materials.<br>
<span style="color:#ec5d53;">Observer：</span><br>
Testing materals...? How fortunate we've just acquired a fine "specimen" from Bismarck over there.<br>
Now what say we enjoy a good old game of chess...?<br>
