<br>
The fanfare of ceremonial cannons could be heard throughout the waters of Europa.<br>
Extravagant colors and sounds swirled together, parading through the newly-constructed pavilion in the likeness of the Colosseum.<br>
At the center of the stage stands a girl clad in vibrant crimson.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Roma：</span><br>
Thank you to all of our friends who've come here from afar, and welcome to Sardegna!<br>
We are blessed today by clear skies and fair winds, making this a perfect day to mark the beginning of our celebration.<br>
This gathering of the world's peoples, once a sign of our unity, was disrupted years ago by the war and destruction brought on by the Sirens.<br>
But now, we hold this event once more to reconnect our separated seas and to reforge our broken bonds.<br>
Let us welcome this opportunity for the people of the world to share the joy of coming together once again.<br>
Never have we abandoned our vision of a peaceful tomorrow.<br>
And the fact that we've gathered here is proof of our determination, courage, and hope for the future!<br>
Now, my friends, raise your voices and hands in applause!<br>
Enjoy this celebration of peace from the bottom of your hearts!<br>
I, battleship Roma of Sardegna, hereby proclaim...<br>
Let the World Expo commence!<br>
<br>
Another fanfare rang out, followed by thunderous applause that did not seem to abate.<br>
A sudden realization struck Roma – this is the splendor of Sardegna. Was this not the glory that the legends of ancient Sardegna had once been blessed with?<br>
She soaked in the excitement of the crowd a bit longer before retreating into the Colosseum.<br>
While there was much to be satisfied about, there was also much that needed to be done.<br>
Sardegna Pavilion "Colosseum" - Exhibit Hall<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Roma：</span><br>
Now that the opening ceremony is over, people are starting to fill the pavilion as well.<br>
I do wonder if this is the last bit of peace and quiet we'll get to enjoy before things get hectic.<br>
But judging from the excitement in the air, I'd say that our hard work has paid off.<br>
As it should be. All for the sake of spreading the splendor of Sardegna across the world...<br>
<br>
As Roma walked through the empty exhibition hall, she could not shake the sense of uneasiness that crept into her.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Roma：</span><br>
Who's there? Show yourself!<br>
<br>
Her voice echoed through the hall. There was no response.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Roma：</span><br>
Maybe the right question isn't who, but what...<br>
<br>
Roma realized the source of her uneasiness was the items around her—she should've been in the exhibition area of the Imperial Senatus.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Roma：</span><br>
All the items here are replicas... But I checked everything in advance. What's going on here...?<br>
The things here seem completely different from those I inspected the other day...<br>
Wait, could there be something going on within the underground warehouse?<br>
That should be the most heavily-protected place in the entire venue... Did something happen there...? I must go check on it!<br>
<br>
Roma, unable to shake the sense of foreboding that swirled around in her head, immediately rushed towards the warehouse beneath the pavilion.<br>
The operation led by the Eagle Union in the NA Ocean has restored stability to the region.<br>
Behind closed doors, the Iron Blood's mutinous disturbance has been established.<br>
The Royal Navy's excursion into the Singularity has paid great dividends.<br>
And the Sakura Empire has completed their courtesy visit to Europa.<br>
When the various factions seem to have been lulled into a state of stability,<br>
Sardegna made a proposition to hold an event –<br>
The long-halted "World Expo."<br>
A celebration of peace where the shipgirls of the world would gather.<br>
But even within the shining splendor of Sardegna, conspiracies sway in the shadows.<br>

Colosseum - Upper-Deck Suite<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Alfredo Oriani：</span><br>
Photo op!<br>
Look who captured the most memorable moment of the opening ceremony!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Emanuele Pessagno：</span><br>
Y-yeah, good job... Now, how about we get back to our patrol mission?<br>
The Sardegnian fleet is in charge of the security around the World Expo, so this is the one time we definitely can't afford to slack off.<br>
Though, the Sirens would seriously be crazy to try to launch an attack considering the sheer number of shipgirls gathered here.<br>
I just hope nothing bad happens inside the venue...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Alfredo Oriani：</span><br>
You don't need to push me around~ I of all people would never forget my duties!<br>
Wherever there's a scoop to be found, you know Alfredo Oriani will be at the scene—in other words, nothing escapes my eye!<br>
Plus, the opening ceremony just ended. What's the point of going on patrol now?<br>
Oh wow, I rarely get the chance for a shot like this! Photo op time!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Emanuele Pessagno：</span><br>
What's the point...?<br>
What's more important to you? Preventing an incident, or being there to get the scoop?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Alfredo Oriani：</span><br>
Well, some things are out of our control, right? Just know that as a journalist, it's in my blood to get the scoop!<br>
How else am I going to get my hands on some incredible breaking news? Ehehe...<br>
Actually, can you lend me your telescope? It'll make it easier to look around!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Emanuele Pessagno：</span><br>
...No way.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Alfredo Oriani：</span><br>
Wow, rejected just like that!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Emanuele Pessagno：</span><br>
We're on patrol, and we have to take our job seriously.<br>
Besides, seeing something through the telescope isn't the same as seeing things up-close, in person.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Alfredo Oriani：</span><br>
Jeez, you're such a hardass~ Maybe da Vinci can invent something to do the patrolling for us!<br>
Da Vinci! ...Huh? Where'd she go?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Leonardo da Vinci：</span><br>
Hahaha~ Were you looking for me?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Alfredo Oriani：</span><br>
Sure was! Hold up, why are you calling me? Weren't we going to patrol the venue pretty soon?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Leonardo da Vinci：</span><br>
Why don't you try looking straight up~ That's right, I'm right above you!<br>
<br>
Alfredo Oriani looked up just as she was told to over the communicator, and found da Vinci patrolling the skies above the venue on a drone.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Alfredo Oriani：</span><br>
Wh-when'd you get up there? More importantly, HOW did you get up there?!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Leonardo da Vinci：</span><br>
Hehe, I don't mind telling, but why not take a guess first?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Alfredo Oriani：</span><br>
My intuition as a journalist is telling me... that you took advantage of your position as the venue's designer to do something funny with those drones!<br>
But more importantly, tell me how to get up there too! Just imagine all the great photo ops I'd be able to get!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Leonardo da Vinci：</span><br>
Sure, sure, coming right down. But patrolling the venue comes first.<br>
Anyway, take a look at the map here. Sardegna's pavilion is right here in the middle, and the other exhibition halls are located on the surrounding islands.<br>
On the right-hand side to the east of the Colosseum, we've got the Eagle Union, Iris Libre, Royal Navy, and Northern Parliament.<br>
And to the west, we have the Dragon Empery, Iron Blood, Vichya Dominion, and Sakura Empire.<br>
Which place do you want to check out first?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Alfredo Oriani：</span><br>
Let's split up into two teams! If anyone runs into any trouble, we'll contact the other team right away. How's that? We'll get things done faster this way!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Emanuele Pessagno：</span><br>
You're just trying to get back to whatever you were doing before... Well, whatever...<br>
I'm fine with that. Even if we tried to go as a group, Alfredo would just run off somewhere anyway, so we might as well split up from the start.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Leonardo da Vinci：</span><br>
That settles it then! I've already seen the designs of all the pavilions, so it doesn't matter which one we start with.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Alfredo Oriani：</span><br>
Come with us, Teach! Let's go check out the Dragon Empery area first!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Emanuele Pessagno：</span><br>
Sure. My group will head to the Northern Parliament pavilion then... By the way, why'd you choose the Dragon Empery first?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Alfredo Oriani：</span><br>
We rarely get to see those girls in Europa, right?<br>
I'd never pass up the opportunity to get such a rare and exclusive interview!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Emanuele Pessagno：</span><br>
Your conduct reflects upon all of Sardegna, so try to behave like an adult...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Alfredo Oriani：</span><br>
Don't worry! You know what my three principles are – don't tell lies, don't ask leading questions, and keep the gossip to a healthy level!<br>
In any case, da Vinci, let's get going!<br>
If we don't hurry it up, we might miss that terrible thing Alfredo is so concerned about!<br>

<br>
Plaza outside the Colosseum<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Alfredo Oriani：</span><br>
Woooah, the Colosseum looks even more incredible from the outside...<br>
Gotta take another photo from this angle–!<br>
<br>
Alfredo brought out her camera to take another photo of the Colosseum...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Alfredo Oriani：</span><br>
Huh, someone's in the way... Um, excuse me, would you mind moving to the side for a second–<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">???：</span><br>
Oh, um, I'm very sorry!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Leonardo da Vinci：</span><br>
What have you done, Alfredo? You scared the poor girl!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Alfredo Oriani：</span><br>
Huh? My bad, my bad! I didn't mean to suddenly call out to you~<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">???：</span><br>
Um, don't worry! You didn't scare me at all...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Alfredo Oriani：</span><br>
Huh? A girl from the Royal Navy? Did you get lost?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Janus：</span><br>
Yes... Um, my name is Janus, a J-class destroyer from the Royal Navy...<br>
I couldn't take my eyes off this emerald eagle, and before I knew it, I had gotten separated from Illustrious and the others...<br>
So, umm, could you point me to where the Royal Navy pavilion is?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Leonardo da Vinci：</span><br>
That's an easy one! See where that oak tree is? That's the front of our Colosseum.<br>
From there, turn clockwise and head east, and you'll be in the Royal Navy area.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Janus：</span><br>
I see, thank you very much!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Alfredo Oriani：</span><br>
Before you go though, tell me more about this emerald eagle!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Janus：</span><br>
Um, I thought I saw something flying over the Colosseum not too long ago. It looked like a green-colored eagle of some sort?<br>
Was it a part of the opening ceremony?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Alfredo Oriani：</span><br>
Y-yeah, I think you're right about that! Ahaha...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Janus：</span><br>
Anyway, thank you very much for the assistance! I'll be off now...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Alfredo Oriani：</span><br>
An emerald eagle, huh... What might she be talking about, da Vinci?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Leonardo da Vinci：</span><br>
Don't look at me. I was on patrol the entire time and didn't see anything strange.<br>
And I don't think that was part of the processions.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Alfredo Oriani：</span><br>
So if you weren't responsible for it, then... Oho, this has the makings of a delicious scoop!<br>
Or so I'd like to say, but I have no idea where to even begin my investigation...<br>
In any case, let's just treat it as hearsay until we get some more concrete information.<br>
Now, onwards to the Dragon Empery pavilion!<br>

<br>
A pink-haired girl sat in a corner of the Northern Parliament's exhibition hall, looking intently through her large telescope.<br>
She kept careful tabs on everything going on in the venue, occasionally jotting things down onto the notepad in her hand.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Emanuele Pessagno：</span><br>
Visibility is fine. Observation range is good. Nothing out of the ordinary spotted...<br>
The Northern Parliament's pavilion looks like it's primarily made out of white marble... Very sturdy looking. Might even be able to withstand a meteorite strike.<br>
<br>
Emanuele drew a cute-looking square next to the pavilion's spot on the map, perhaps to represent how sturdy it is.<br>
As soon as she put her eyes to the lens again, she noticed a couple of her friends waving at her.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Vincenzo Gioberti：</span><br>
Ema~! Are you here by yourself?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Stremitelny：</span><br>
Good morning, Miss Pessagno!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Emanuele Pessagno：</span><br>
Oh, it's GB and Stremitelny. Good morning, you two.<br>
Are the two of you also looking around the venue?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Vincenzo Gioberti：</span><br>
Nope. I'm just taking Snezhok around while keeping watch around the expo.<br>
After all, Snezhok here is going straight back to the Northern Parliament after the expo is over.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Emanuele Pessagno：</span><br>
Huh... You can't stay a bit longer?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Stremitelny：</span><br>
I've been away for a while already, and I'm needed back home. So, I have to head back soon!<br>
But today's just the first day of the expo, so we'll have plenty of time to play together!<br>
Do you want to take a look around our exhibition hall as well?<br>
I heard Avrora and the others brought a whole bunch of neat things!<br>
Oh, it's Pamiat'! Hold on for a moment, let me call her over here!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Emanuele Pessagno：</span><br>
That girl is always so full of energy, just like da Recco...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Vincenzo Gioberti：</span><br>
That's just how she is. Are you still on patrol? Sorry to bother you if you are.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Emanuele Pessagno：</span><br>
Don't worry about it, I can afford to slack off a bit. Besides, who knows when the next time I'll be able to see Snezhok is?<br>
I also can't deny that there are quite a few interesting things here... For example, the Polar observation technology, the response system to poor weather...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Pamiat' Merkuria：</span><br>
Hey, hey! So you two are the girls I've been hearing so much about! Welcome to the Northern Parliament's exhibition hall!<br>
I hope our little snowball here hasn't been giving you any trouble! Heehee~<br>
Oh, I haven't introduced myself yet, have I? I'm Pamiat' Merkuria from the Northern Parliament, but you can just call me Pamiat'!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Stremitelny ：</span><br>
Pamiat' will show you the way! Quick, come with us!<br>

<br>
World Expo Venue<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Hai Chi：</span><br>
Woah, so many people! So many decorations! It's just like celebrating our Spring Festival back home!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Hai Tien：</span><br>
Indeed. I can't believe how many different cultures there are here.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Hai Chi：</span><br>
Sis, what are those flying things over there?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Hai Tien：</span><br>
Let's see... The large one is a dirigible, the smaller one is a sightseeing hot-air balloon, and the smallest one is...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Hai Chi：</span><br>
A flying boat?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Hai Tien：</span><br>
Yes, the vessel can float because the gas pumped into it is lighter than air. It's the same principle as the balloon you bought earlier.<br>
As once was said in a poem, "When you wish to return home, take to the skies with a balloon lighter than air."<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Hai Chi：</span><br>
Hmm, that makes sense. What about that building over there?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Hai Tien：</span><br>
That's the main pavilion built by Sardegna. I heard they named it "The Colosseum."<br>
It's based on a building of the same name constructed by an ancient civilization predating Sardegna.<br>
"To the West lies a great sea, a thousand li beyond the clouds. A kingdom to which a dozen others bend their knee, four hundred cities united and proud."<br>
...I wonder what it was like to live in such a place.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Hai Chi：</span><br>
You really know your stuff, sis!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Hai Tien：</span><br>
It's not that big of a deal. It's just that I've been reading a lot of books in preparation for this trip.<br>
After all, we were tasked with learning as much as we can from the others, so I need to be knowledgeable enough to recognize what I'm looking at. Hehe~<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Hai Chi：</span><br>
What about that strange thing the girl over there is pointing at us? Is that how they make cameras over here?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Hai Tien：</span><br>
Oh my, that seems to be a camera with a special high-performance lens... Is she trying to take a picture of us?<br>
I hope she's not some kind of... voyeur. Hai Chi, let's go somewhere else.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Hai Chi：</span><br>
Alright... Wait, is she running after us?!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Hai Tien：</span><br>
Hurry, let's shake her off!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Hai Chi：</span><br>
Right behind you, sis!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Hai Tien：</span><br>
*pant* *pant*... I can't feel my legs anymore...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Alfredo Oriani：</span><br>
Me neither... *pant*... Why did you start running anyway?!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Hai Tien：</span><br>
Isn't that the natural thing to do when some suspicious person is chasing after you with a camera?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Alfredo Oriani：</span><br>
A suspicious person? Where? Tell me where they are!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Hai Tien：</span><br>
Um... Right here. In front of my eyes.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Alfredo Oriani：</span><br>
I don't see any... Wait a second, who are you calling suspicious?!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Hai Tien：</span><br>
So, why are you trying to take a picture of us without asking?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Leonardo da Vinci：</span><br>
Just stop talking, Alfredo! You've caused another huge misunderstanding!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Alfredo Oriani：</span><br>
S-sorry... I'm Alfredo Oriani, from the Sardegnian fleet. And this is my friend, Leonardo da Vinci.<br>
We're patrolling the venue right now, but I've never seen clothes like yours before and just couldn't pass up the photo op! I just wanted to say hello!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Hai Tien：</span><br>
You're one of the organizer's ships then, huh...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Alfredo Oriani：</span><br>
I just wanted to approach the two of you to introduce myself, but then you broke out into a sprint!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Hai Tien：</span><br>
I apologize as well then. I suppose I jumped to conclusions too quickly.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Leonardo da Vinci：</span><br>
Well, all's well that ends well. Besides, this only happened because SOMEONE can't keep her camera to herself.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Alfredo Oriani：</span><br>
Ehehe, my bad, my bad~ In any case, are the two of you from the Dragon Empery?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Hai Tien：</span><br>
Yes, my name is Hai Tien, and this is my sister, Hai Chi.<br>
We are here as representatives of the Dragon Empery.<br>
Actually, we wanted to know how to get to the Colosseum...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Alfredo Oriani：</span><br>
Really? I'll show you the quickest way to get there. Sorry again for what happened earlier!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Hai Tien：</span><br>
Oh, there's no need for you to trouble yourself with that. We have a map, and don't mind taking a more scenic route to see the sights and sounds. After all, "when in Rome, do as the Romans do."<br>
If you don't mind the inconvenience, there is one thing I'd like to ask you though...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Alfredo Oriani：</span><br>
Sure, fire away! I'll answer to the best of my ability!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Hai Tien：</span><br>
What are those things floating in the sky with the little white propellers?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Alfredo Oriani：</span><br>
Those are probably our security drones.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Hai Tien：</span><br>
Drones? At first glance, those things look so flimsy that it's a miracle they're staying in the air... How exactly is that possible?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Alfredo Oriani：</span><br>
I can't answer technical questions like that...<br>
But I can refer you to the person who designed them – Leonardo da Vinci here!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Leonardo da Vinci：</span><br>
Heh heh, what you're looking at is my original flying device – the Pneumatic Spinner-Arounder Helidrone!<br>
Though these things may look like flimsy pieces of wood and paper, don't be fooled! They've been fitted with the latest, cutting-edge technology by yours truly!<br>
They're lightweight, versatile, maneuverable, and best of all... this latest model can even carry people!<br>
Hehe, want to give it a try?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Hai Tien：</span><br>
I... I appreciate the offer, but I think I'll pass.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Hai Chi：</span><br>
You bet I do!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Hai Tien：</span><br>
...Hai Chi?!<br>
<br>
Da Vinci pulled a controller out from nowhere and slapped at it a few times before waving at the sky, and a drone descended right after.<br>
Without even waiting for the drone's altitude to stabilize, Hai Chi jumped up acrobatically and plopped down on the disc-shaped "seat."<br>
The drone soon carried her higher and higher, the anxiety on Hai Tien's face following suit.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Hai Chi：</span><br>
Woooo, the wind suddenly picked up! It feels great up here–!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Hai Tien：</span><br>
So, um, your... Pneumatic Spinner-Arounder Helidrone... is it going to be okay...?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Leonardo da Vinci：</span><br>
Of course! All of my inventions are a-hundred-percent safe and secure! As long as you don't suddenly deploy your rigging, there's no chance of falling!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Hai Chi：</span><br>
Look over there, sis! Those two girls seem to be rushing over here!<br>
They're from Sardegna's fleet, right? Their uniforms are so cool... I wonder what they're up to?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Leonardo da Vinci：</span><br>
Hrmm... You're right! It's Bolzano and Garibaldi...?<br>
I thought those two were in charge of security around the Colosseum... Now what are they doing over here?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Alfredo Oriani：</span><br>
They seem to be secretively whispering something into a communicator too... *gasp*!<br>
Come with us, Teach! Let's go check out the Dragon Empery area first!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Hai Tien：</span><br>
What's wrong? You two look awfully serious all of a sudden...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Alfredo Oriani：</span><br>
There's nothing to worry about! It may not seem like it, but I'm keeping a careful eye on the venue! If there's a scoop to be had... Err, I mean, if any trouble breaks out, I'll be the first to sound the alarm!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Hai Tien：</span><br>
Oh, um, I see... In any case, we'll be fine over here, so don't let us keep you from your investigation.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Hai Chi：</span><br>
Hup! Give me a holler when you swing by our pavilion! I'll show you around!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Alfredo Oriani：</span><br>
I'll take you up on that then!<br>
Da Vinci, let's go see what Bolzano and Garibaldi are up to!<br>

<br>
Colosseum - Underground Warehouse<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Roma：</span><br>
This is where all the exhibits that aren't on display today are being stored...<br>
Now, let's see... The source of the unusual scent in the air...<br>
Is right here!<br>
<br>
Roma lifted up the dustproof sheet covering a glass exhibit box, revealing the contents underneath.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Roma：</span><br>
This is... a stone tile from the Great Library?<br>
If I remember properly, this was excavated not too long ago under the direction of the Senate, and later recovered from that Siren "labyrinth"...<br>
Why is there already a replica of something that was freshly excavated? What exactly is going on here...?<br>
I suppose there's no point overthinking things though... *sigh*<br>
<br>
Roma opened up the storage case, weighing the tile in her hands while inspecting it carefully.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Roma：</span><br>
I knew it, there's something amiss...<br>
At a surface level, the replica was made impeccably, to the point where it could hardly be distinguished from the real article. However, the material it was made of was certainly not stone.<br>
<br>
While handling the uncanny imitation in her hands, Roma had a premonition that what she was holding was not a relic with over a thousand years of history, but rather technology beyond this time and world.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Roma：</span><br>
I know I checked this exhibit before, and this is not the same tile that I handled.<br>
Maybe someone replaced it with a replica while it was stored in this warehouse...?<br>
But that doesn't make any sense. The "original" piece submitted for inspection was already a replica, so what's the point of swapping one replica for another?<br>
<br>
Lost in thought, Roma closed her eyes and subconsciously reached for the tile, running her fingers across its surface. Suddenly, a burst of images flowed through her mind as if they were her own flashbacks.<br>
She seemed to see light pouring from the ancient lighthouse, sheets of papyrus fluttering through the library, clouds of dust kicked up by horses, and watery mist stirring from aqueducts.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Roma：</span><br>
Where... am I...?<br>
<br>
When she opened her eyes again, she was no longer in the underground warehouse. Instead, a vast wilderness stretched out before her eyes.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Roma：</span><br>
What... just happened to me?!<br>

<br>
Somewhere in the Expo Venue...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Emanuele Pessagno：</span><br>
What's wrong, Alfredo? Why the sudden call?<br>
And why are you hiding behind the other side of the wall? Where's da Vinci?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Alfredo Oriani：</span><br>
Hush! Teach is currently monitoring things from the air, so we have to stay on the down-low and focus on staying hidden!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Leonardo da Vinci：</span><br>
Is Ema here? Good, I'll reconfirm the targets' location then–<br>
Mark B and Mark G are currently heading towards the Colosseum.<br>
They seem to be checking something while moving, and they've been busy on the communicators this whole time.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Alfredo Oriani：</span><br>
Understood! Something big is happening, Teach, just like I said!<br>
Continue offering air support. Ema and I are moving out now!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Leonardo da Vinci：</span><br>
You got it!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Emanuele Pessagno：</span><br>
...I thought you were patrolling the venue. Why in the world are you tailing Bolzano now?!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Alfredo Oriani：</span><br>
Excuse me, I'm not TAILING her, I'm conducting an undercover investigation!<br>
Don't you think something's fishy, Ema? We're in charge of patrolling the venues, so why would the two people in charge of keeping an eye on the Colosseum suddenly leave their posts?<br>
Plus, they've continuously been in touch with someone this whole time while moving about!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Emanuele Pessagno：</span><br>
Or... They got someone else to watch the underground warehouse and went on patrol themselves because some people here, and I won't name names, are so unreliable.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Alfredo Oriani：</span><br>
Wow, mean!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Leonardo da Vinci：</span><br>
Yeah, what she said! That was mean!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Emanuele Pessagno：</span><br>
...In any case, I want you, Alfredo, to call off your "undercover" investigation, and I want you, da Vinci, to get down from there already. At this rate, WE'RE going to start looking like the suspicious ones sneaking around...<br>
If you're worried about Bolzano being out here, you should probably just ask her upfront. I guarantee you, she'll happily fill you in on whatever she's doing.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Alfredo Oriani：</span><br>
Heh heh... And that's why you're an amateur! You'll never be able to land a huge scoop with such naive methods!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Emanuele Pessagno：</span><br>
...Sure then.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Leonardo da Vinci：</span><br>
This is da Vinci! The situation has changed! Bolzano and Garibaldi are no longer heading to the Colosseum!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Alfredo Oriani：</span><br>
Way ahead of you! I saw them walk into a small room that says "Do Not Enter" near the Colosseum! What kind of place do you think it is, da Vinci?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Leonardo da Vinci：</span><br>
It's the control room for the venue's security system.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Alfredo Oriani：</span><br>
Oh...? In other words, there must be something wrong for them to need to check the security system?<br>
Hrmmmmmmmmm... Yes – this is, without a doubt, a huge scoop in the making!<br>
Is there any way to find out what exactly they're looking for?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Leonardo da Vinci：</span><br>
Hah~♪ Who the hell do you think I am? I practically designed the base framework for the security system here!<br>
Naturally, I left a little backdoor specifically for times like this!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Alfredo Oriani：</span><br>
Woah, I knew I could count on you! The excitement's making my hairs stand on end!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Leonardo da Vinci：</span><br>
Well, the process is actually quite complicated, so we'll need some peace and quiet as well as a bit of time.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Emanuele Pessagno：</span><br>
Hmm... Then how about the forest next to the Sakura Empire pavilion?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Alfredo Oriani：</span><br>
That's a great idea! I'm so glad you're on board, Ema~! The investigation team gets another member!<br>
Let's get ready to go, Teach!<br>
{{折叠面板|内容结束}}

{{折叠面板|标题=Dreams of Turmoil|选项=8|主框=1|样式=primary|展开=是}}
<br>
Deep in the woods next to the Sakura Empire pavilion, da Vinci was fiddling around with a controller with extreme concentration.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Leonardo da Vinci：</span><br>
Hrmm, mmhmm... I see, I see.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Alfredo Oriani：</span><br>
How's the progress, Teach? Think we'll be able to get the scoop?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Leonardo da Vinci：</span><br>
I've managed to connect a drone to the room's communication equipment. So far, it looks like Bolzano's checking the status records of today's patrols.<br>
That's certainly a bit unusual. They must be trying to dig something up.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Emanuele Pessagno：</span><br>
...What might that "something" be?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Leonardo da Vinci：</span><br>
Who knows? We're all playing it by ear now. Speaking of which... This isn't good. I can't hear what they're talking about inside that room.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Alfredo Oriani：</span><br>
Huh? Why not?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Leonardo da Vinci：</span><br>
I dunno, why don't you figure out a way then? I have access to the security system, but it's not like I have the room itself wiretapped.<br>
But... Maybe I can knock the power out in the control room to force them to come outside where my drone can listen in...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Emanuele Pessagno：</span><br>
Da Vinci! Someone's coming this way...!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Alfredo Oriani：</span><br>
Crap, has our cover been blown?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Leonardo da Vinci：</span><br>
How is that possible? I'm the one who installed the backdoor... Apart from Torricelli, who isn't here, nobody else should know about its existence...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Emanuele Pessagno：</span><br>
Find somewhere to hide, everyone! Quick!<br>
<br>
Da Vinci and company quickly took cover. The footsteps of several shipgirls became louder and louder as they approached.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Alfredo Oriani：</span><br>
Is that... Veneto?<br>
Didn't she have to go somewhere as soon as the opening ceremony ended? Why would she suddenly show up over here?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Emanuele Pessagno：</span><br>
I'll say this again... All of this smells way too fishy. There's definitely something major about to happen...<br>
Look, the people next to Veneto are from the Sakura Empire...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Leonardo da Vinci：</span><br>
You're right... But keep your head down more or we'll get found out!<br>
And put the stupid camera away, Alfredo! If we get caught, an apology won't cut it this time!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Shinano ：</span><br>
Thank you for coming to our humble exhibition hall. This one... extends you her gratitude.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Vittorio Veneto：</span><br>
Your gardens were simply wonderful, and the juxtaposition of spring, summer, fall, and winter on a single island was truly a sight to behold. Is that the inspiration behind your pavilion's name, "Shiki no Hana?"<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Shinano ：</span><br>
Indeed... We are now in the Spring Garden. It is said that a year's plans begin in the spring... and that is reflected in our pavilion as well.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Noshiro：</span><br>
Lady Veneto, I've brought you some traditional Sakura-style tea, if you don't mind.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Vittorio Veneto：</span><br>
Mm... I see, the aroma is quite distinct from the Royal Navy's black tea.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Shinano ：</span><br>
It is the same variety of tea, but the taste differs greatly depending on where it is grown... Is it to your liking?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Vittorio Veneto：</span><br>
Very much so, thank you. What a gentle and refined flavor.<br>
But, let's get down to business. Lady Shinano, what is this "incident" you mentioned to me earlier?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Shinano ：</span><br>
Umm... Do excuse this one for bringing up such matters on the first day of the expo, but... have you noticed any abnormalities around the venue?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Vittorio Veneto：</span><br>
Abnormalities? Let's see... Nothing in particular comes to mind.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Shinano ：</span><br>
I see... That is fine then. Since last night, this one has felt an unusual aura coming from this venue...<br>
This one was afraid that the venue had been touched by a malicious presence, but... if there is nothing amiss here, that is for the better.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Vittorio Veneto：</span><br>
Can you elaborate a bit on what you think is causing this "unusual aura?"<br>
While nothing has gone wrong just yet, the security here at the World Expo is of paramount importance to us, and we cannot allow any potential dangers to go unchecked.<br>
As the representative of Sardegna, I ask for your cooperation, Miss Shinano.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Shinano ：</span><br>
What this one fears is that... No, I shall tell you everything I know, Miss Veneto...<br>
But, it may be inadvisable to discuss such contents out here... We can continue inside the pavilion if you'd like.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Vittorio Veneto：</span><br>
Very well. Let's do just that.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Noshiro：</span><br>
Right this way then, Lady Veneto.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Leonardo da Vinci：</span><br>
Phew... They've finally left...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Emanuele Pessagno：</span><br>
At the very end there, it seemed like Shinano was looking straight at you...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Leonardo da Vinci：</span><br>
Th-th-there's no way she knew we were here! I was practically holding my breath the whole time!<br>
Yeah, there's no way! If our cover was blown, they definitely would've chewed us out for eavesdropping on them!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Emanuele Pessagno：</span><br>
I-I guess so... I'm starting to feel like we're in over our heads here...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Alfredo Oriani：</span><br>
Hehehe... "A malicious presence grips the World Expo"...<br>
I'm sure Bolzano and Garibaldi understand the situation! That's why they're investigating around as well to see if anything's wrong!<br>
We can't afford to let them get the legs up over us, the patrol team! Let's keep searching for clues and evidence!<br>
Teach, you're able to control all the drones around the venue, right?<br>
Since this is an emergency situation, let's have all the drones start scanning around to see if we can find this "abnormality" Shinano was talking about!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Leonardo da Vinci：</span><br>
Wait a sec! That's way too much commotion! It'd totally expose the fact that I bugged the security system!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Alfredo Oriani：</span><br>
Let's look at things from another perspective - if you manage to crack the case and resolve a dangerous situation, not only will you not get blamed for anything, you'll even get an increase in your invention research budget!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Leonardo da Vinci：</span><br>
Yes, I see... That IS something only I can do. Hehehe... Alright, I've made up my mind! Just leave it to me!<br>

<br>
Over in the security control room, Veneto was staring at the footage from the surveillance cameras and pondering the situation.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Bolzano：</span><br>
I'm afraid I have bad news, Lady Veneto.<br>
We reviewed the drone and camera footage from all around the venue, but were unable to locate Lady Roma.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Vittorio Veneto：</span><br>
But nobody has seen her leave the Colosseum, correct? That means she must still be somewhere inside.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Giuseppe Garibaldi：</span><br>
Inside the Colosseum? Well, that was the first place we looked...<br>
She didn't show up on any of our cameras. That can only mean one of two things – either Roma isn't in the Colosseum, or the cameras aren't working properly.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Vittorio Veneto：</span><br>
Not working properly... Perhaps that is what Shinano meant by "touched by a malicious presence."<br>
Supposing they've been broken—or worse yet, hacked into—we're not going to find Roma just by looking through security footage.<br>
That leaves us only one option: to temporarily put the Colosseum on lockdown.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Giuseppe Garibaldi：</span><br>
Lockdown?! And put the World Expo on hold?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Vittorio Veneto：</span><br>
No, only the Colosseum. It will act as a preventative measure until we've completed our investigation.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Bolzano：</span><br>
Understood. Then I shall evacuate the spectators within the Colosseum... under the pretense of a mechanical failure.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Vittorio Veneto：</span><br>
...Wait, let me think things through.<br>
(Marco Polo proposed this expo as the best chance we'll get to spread Sardegna's splendor to the world...)<br>
(The other factions will take to wild speculation if we put our pavilion under lockdown, and our public image will plummet as a result...)<br>
(On the other hand, we cannot resolve the situation without closing the Colosseum to investigate. At the same time, abandoning one of our own to save face is an unforgivably disgraceful notion.)<br>
(Furthermore, there's no guarantee that Roma is still inside the Colosseum. What if we close the pavilion and still come up empty-handed? Then...)<br>
(Argh! Why do you hesitate, Veneto?! Things will only get worse if you keep waiting around instead of taking action now!)<br>
(That's right, we can't assume that only the Colosseum has been compromised. More guests may go missing from their pavilions while our focus is solely on the Colosseum...)<br>
(Littorio... If you were here, what would you do?)<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Giuseppe Garibaldi：</span><br>
Veneto hasn't said a thing for a while now. Any ideas why?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Bolzano：</span><br>
I can't say for sure... But the decision to close the Colosseum is not an easy one.<br>
The revival of the World Expo was entirely at Sardegna's suggestion. In other words, our reputation is on the line for the entire world to see.<br>
Should an incident break out on the first day, the other factions would surely call question to our competence, regardless of the circumstances...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Giuseppe Garibaldi：</span><br>
So what do we do then? Bury our heads in the sand and pretend everything's fine?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Bolzano：</span><br>
Well, um... I believe ensuring the safety of our guests is our top priority.<br>
That said, I think we should only close the Colosseum if it's our last resort.<br>
There must be other options. Like if there's a chance the security system has been tampered with, we could ask its designer or a security expert to have a look.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Vittorio Veneto：</span><br>
Yes! That's it, Bolzano!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Bolzano：</span><br>
P-pardon? Did I disrupt your train of thought...?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Vittorio Veneto：</span><br>
Quite the opposite – what you just said is a great idea. If anyone can tell us if the security system has been compromised, it's someone with intimate knowledge of it.<br>
I should've thought of it sooner, myself... Say, why don't we bring this up with Torricelli?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Torricelli：</span><br>
Oh, I see... That's not good at all... Hehehehehe...<br>
There's only two things that could override the cameras – a full-on hack, or the properties of a Mirror Sea... But I only do maintenance on the system, so take that with a grain of salt...<br>
I doubt it's a Mirror Sea... It'd need to be tiny to only affect the Colosseum... In the case of a hack, I can't tell you much from where we are now...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Vittorio Veneto：</span><br>
Is there no way we can confirm one thing or the other?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Torricelli：</span><br>
I mean, there IS, but it's probably too complicated for you all...<br>
I could head over there and do it if you want, though... Hehe, hehehehe...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Trieste：</span><br>
May I have a word? Lady Veneto, the drones suddenly were issued a new patrol route. Did you do something in the control room?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Vittorio Veneto：</span><br>
A new patrol route? No, we haven't done anything.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Giuseppe Garibaldi：</span><br>
Hey, look! The drones are moving en-masse! Their cameras are all over the place!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Bolzano：</span><br>
Someone must have seized control of them! How could this have happened?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Vittorio Veneto：</span><br>
Is it possible to shut down the system at a moment's notice?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Torricelli：</span><br>
Hehe, hehehe... You'd have to ask da Vinci...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Vittorio Veneto：</span><br>
I see... She built the foundation of the security system, didn't she?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Torricelli：</span><br>
Sure did. Even designed the control system for the drones... If anyone could shut it down, it's her...<br>
Hehehehe... By the way, she also slipped a backdoor into the security system, which she might be using right now to take the investigation into her own hands...<br>
And if this is the Sirens' doing instead, asking her for advice is the quickest way to a solution... Hehehe...<br>
Anyway, we should probably find her as soon as possible... She'd have a way better idea of what to do than me...<br>
Oh, and don't let her know I told you about the backdoor, alright? Hehe, hehehe...<br>

<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Leonardo da Vinci：</span><br>
Heheh! I've updated all the drones' patrol routes and scan parameters! This is what I call Hyper-Focused Super-Searcher Mode!<br>
Now we just wait for them to find the abnormality and send in a status report!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Alfredo Oriani：</span><br>
Photo op! Here we see Leonardo da Vinci, the to-be savior of Sardegna, the guiding star of the patrol team, taking matters into her own hands!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Emanuele Pessagno：</span><br>
You don't think they'll use that photo as proof that she hacked the security system?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Alfredo Oriani：</span><br>
It'll be fine! They'll hail her as a hero when they learn she did it to resolve this whole ordeal!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Leonardo da Vinci：</span><br>
Aw, dangit! Hide, everyone! Trieste is coming towards us, and fast!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Alfredo Oriani：</span><br>
Whaaat?! She's on to us already?!<br>
Let's head into the woods! She'll brand us as some band of conspirators if she catches us now!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Emanuele Pessagno：</span><br>
*sigh*... You should honestly rip that photo apart now while you have the chance.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Alfredo Oriani：</span><br>
Maybe later! But right now, we've gotta split!<br>
*pant pant*... Did we lose her?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Leonardo da Vinci：</span><br>
No idea. The drone cameras can't see through these thick woods.<br>
But realistically, there's no way she'd chase us THIS far.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">???：</span><br>
Wrong. I'd pursue you to the ends of the earth after what you've done.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Alfredo Oriani：</span><br>
Is that... It's her! H-h-how the heck did you manage to find us?!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Trieste：</span><br>
Using the drone that went in the same direction as me. You were using it to keep an eye on me, weren't you?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Leonardo da Vinci：</span><br>
Oops... I was so focused on running that I forgot to change that thing's flight route...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Emanuele Pessagno：</span><br>
We're sorry, Trieste... But believe me, we weren't trying to cause any trouble.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Trieste：</span><br>
I know you weren't. I came looking for you by orders from Veneto.<br>
You're going to help us resolve this situation.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Alfredo Oriani：</span><br>
Wait, Veneto knows we took over the system?! Then she should've just asked us for help directly!<br>
Because like, we spent all this time running and hiding, and for what?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Trieste：</span><br>
For what? You of all people should know, Alfredo.<br>
Oh, and we also know you trailed Bolzano and Garibaldi. You set yourselves up to be caught sooner or later.<br>
Now that we're on the same page, would you return command of the drones to the control room already? The other factions will start getting suspicious soon.<br>
Be quick, then follow me to the Colosseum. Veneto is waiting for you there.<br>

<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Alfredo Oriani：</span><br>
This hall's clear too. Nothing seems to be off...<br>
Come on, everything's the same as we left it! I can't even smell the traces of a scoop in here!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Emanuele Pessagno：</span><br>
We have to keep looking. Veneto said there's a good chance this is where Roma went missing, remember?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Alfredo Oriani：</span><br>
What if... "Deep within this ordinary-looking exhibition hall lies a web of conspiracy, luring innocent tourists inside to spirit them away"...<br>
Oh yes! Now THIS smells like a scoop!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Emanuele Pessagno：</span><br>
One second it doesn't, and now it does?<br>
...Try not to make too much of a ruckus, okay? There are still guests around, and Veneto doesn't want others finding out about this.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Alfredo Oriani：</span><br>
I know, I know! We'll solve this case and our guests will be none the wiser!<br>
Oh? What's up, Teach? Your stare tells me you're onto something.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Leonardo da Vinci：</span><br>
Not really. These display items caught my eye, that's all.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Emanuele Pessagno：</span><br>
Each and every one of these is an antique or work of art from another faction, right?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Leonardo da Vinci：</span><br>
Yeah. Almost all of them are replicas, though.<br>
Most people might be fooled, but I can tell they're fakes even at a glance!<br>

Nope, pretty much everything that's been brought here is a replica, and that's true for all the factions here.<br>
Taking national treasures abroad is inherently risky. They're prone to getting damaged, particularly with the threat of a Siren attack.<br>
Heck, even our own display pieces are mostly replicas, and we're on home turf!<br>
That way, we don't have to worry on the odd chance that someone steals or smuggles something out.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Alfredo Oriani：</span><br>
I see, that does make sense...<br>
You keep saying things like "pretty much" and "mostly," so SOME of these have to be real, right?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Leonardo da Vinci：</span><br>
Some, yeah. Like, the stuff brought over from the Dragon Empery. Some of their pieces look so intricate that I can't imagine them being fakes.<br>
Even if they were fake, they were so well-made that they were even able to deceive this inventor's eyes, and that in itself is worth something!<br>
Alright! After we wrap this case up, I'll come back to take another look around.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Emanuele Pessagno：</span><br>
Psst! Someone's coming! Alfredo, da Vinci, put away your investigation tools!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Alfredo Oriani：</span><br>
Oh, it's Hai Tien and her sister! Good to see they made it to the Colosseum~<br>
Though it's a bummer we have to stop searching. We haven't searched every hall yet!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Emanuele Pessagno：</span><br>
We just have to be patient. Short of outright closing the Colosseum, the most we can do is put up a visitor limit.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Alfredo Oriani：</span><br>
Let's make it up to them by letting them have another ride on da Vinci's Spinner-Arounder!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Emanuele Pessagno：</span><br>
What?! That sounds pretty dangerous...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Leonardo da Vinci：</span><br>
It's fiiine. Don't forget the inventor behind it! It won't break so easily.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Alfredo Oriani：</span><br>
See? Now come on, we have to search the rest of the halls! We'll chat with those girls later!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Emanuele Pessagno：</span><br>
Alright. We'll do that and move on to the next hall since the cameras here are offline.<br>
I really hope we'll find Roma soon...<br>

<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Alfredo Oriani：</span><br>
What'cha writing in your notepad, Ema? Mind if I have a look?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Emanuele Pessagno：</span><br>
Well, um... Fine, it's not like you'll take no for an answer anyway...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Alfredo Oriani：</span><br>
Hehe, appreciate it! ...Umm, what's all this?<br>
Oh, I see now! These cute little symbols form a map!<br>
The speech bubbles mark the spot where we had a chat with those girls...<br>
Crosses denote places we've investigated... And exclamation marks denote points of interest. Am I on the money?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Emanuele Pessagno：</span><br>
Yeah. Which means this next hall is the only place left to look, save for the underground warehouse.<br>
So far we haven't found anything unusual...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Leonardo da Vinci：</span><br>
That's a good sign. It means that there aren't any abnormalities on the ground level of the Colosseum.<br>
That, in turn, means it can stay open for business while we investigate the underground areas with peace of mind.<br>
We'll want to be thorough, because we do know Roma went down there to do a check of the exhibition items stored there.<br>
It would make sense if she went there right after the opening ceremony, which is when she went missing.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Alfredo Oriani：</span><br>
You're right it would, Teach! But that raises the question... How do we get there in the first place?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Leonardo da Vinci：</span><br>
Good question. It's the hardest place to get inside in the whole Colosseum, since it's where the items not on display are stored.<br>
The entrance is behind a hidden door, and finding it is not going to be... Wait, what?!<br>
<br>
At the end of a corridor between two halls, the party found the passage to the underground warehouse. The door had been left open for anyone to see.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Alfredo Oriani：</span><br>
Oh, silly Roma~ She forgot to close the door behind her!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Leonardo da Vinci：</span><br>
She would NOT forget! And even if she did, the door would sound an alarm when left open for too long!<br>
The fact there's no alarm means the security system is probably offline down there. I have a bad feeling about this...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Bristol：</span><br>
Hey, fellow detectives! Are you hunting the green ghost too?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Alfredo Oriani：</span><br>
What green ghost? And who are you?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Bristol：</span><br>
I'm Bristol, Allen M. Sumner-class destroyer from the Eagle Union! I'm investigating rumors about a ghost that's appeared at the World Expo!<br>
Strange that it's nowhere to be seen... Data 857 said it came from here...<br>
Oh well, I'll go on ahead! Good luck to you all, and take care not to lose your sanity!<br>
Just you wait, green ghost! I'm coming for you!<br>
<br>
Holding a lantern in one hand and a strange robot in the other, the self-proclaimed Eagle Union detective departed for the exit, going where the Sardegnian team had already investigated before.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Alfredo Oriani：</span><br>
She didn't see the entrance to the warehouse, did she? Also, why the heck is someone besides us snooping around here?!<br>
Carrying a lantern in broad daylight, at that! Is that super suspicious or what?!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Leonardo da Vinci：</span><br>
Ditto for that little robot of hers! Very, very suspicious!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Alfredo Oriani：</span><br>
Let's not kid ourselves. We both know you just want to take it apart to study!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Leonardo da Vinci：</span><br>
Oof... Anyway! She's probably a random lost guest. Seeing as she headed for the exit, let's just leave her be.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Emanuele Pessagno：</span><br>
What was that green ghost she mentioned, though?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Alfredo Oriani：</span><br>
Oh yeah, that's another one for the suspicious list!<br>
A green ghost... Hang on, doesn't that kind of sound like the emerald eagle...?<br>
That makes two oddities spotted around the Colosseum, huh...<br>
Hey, that's it! Two eyewitnesses, two sightings of green things, both around the Colosseum! It's all connected!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Emanuele Pessagno：</span><br>
You're right. It's not like two separate eyewitnesses would lie about that.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Leonardo da Vinci：</span><br>
That Bristol girl said it "came from here" too...<br>
<br>
Just then, da Vinci and Alfredo looked at each other. Their eyes lit up as they were both hit by similar realizations.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Alfredo Oriani & Leonardo da Vinci：</span><br>
- Hot scoop, here I coooome! - Increased budget, here I coooome!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Emanuele Pessagno：</span><br>
W-wait, come back here...<br>
<br>
The person on the other end of the communicator in Emanuele's hand let out a massive sigh.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Emanuele Pessagno：</span><br>
F-forgive me, Veneto... I'll t-try to catch up to them...<br>

<br>
Alfredo, da Vinci, and Emanuele continued down the staircase to the underground warehouse.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Alfredo Oriani：</span><br>
Nice one, Teach! Bringing a lantern was great foresight on your part!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Leonardo da Vinci：</span><br>
Heheh! It's far from the only thing I brought! Check out my Dark Place Lighter-Upper – perfect for times like these!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Emanuele Pessagno：</span><br>
It's handy to have, considering you nearly tripped over yourselves in the darkness right after we closed the door...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Alfredo Oriani：</span><br>
You still taking notes there, Ema?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Emanuele Pessagno：</span><br>
Mhm. I'm logging every leg of our journey. Da Recco's going to want to read it when I get back.<br>
Plus this is an easy way to track our progress and review the map.<br>
...Oh. We can't go past this point.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Alfredo Oriani：</span><br>
Huh? What do you mean we can't?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Emanuele Pessagno：</span><br>
Uh, because the Colosseum's boundary lies just up ahead? There shouldn't be anywhere for us TO go.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Alfredo Oriani：</span><br>
Huh? Well, if my eyes don't deceive me, this corridor doesn't seem to end any time soon...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Emanuele Pessagno：</span><br>
How? That doesn't make sense...<br>
We've been moving in a straight line for so long we should be in the wall, based on the blueprints. And yet there's no end in sight, never mind any sign of the storage...<br>
<br>
BZZZT... BZZZZZT...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Alfredo Oriani：</span><br>
The light's fading... Teach, I think your lamp's broken!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Leonardo da Vinci：</span><br>
Nonsense! My inventions do not break! It CAN'T break, not now when–<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Emanuele Pessagno：</span><br>
Eek! It went out completely!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Leonardo da Vinci：</span><br>
AAAAAAAHHHHHH!<br>
No, calm down, me... Darn you, stupid lamp! I'll fix you good!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Alfredo Oriani：</span><br>
Something's not right here... I think this scoop has gone paranormal...<br>
We're in way over our heads! Let's turn back!<br>
<br>
Alfredo looked back at the way the party came, but there was only endless darkness as far as the eye could see.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Alfredo Oriani：</span><br>
Eep! H-hey, I think we should call Veneto right now...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Leonardo da Vinci：</span><br>
Already tried that. No response. Something's obviously blocking our signal.<br>
My guess is that this is the exact point Roma went missing after she went underground.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Alfredo Oriani：</span><br>
Teach... It's almost scary how quickly you regained your composure.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Leonardo da Vinci：</span><br>
You need to calm down yourself. Panicking won't help us.<br>
Think about this logically. We suddenly lost signal while walking forward, and the way we came from just disappeared.<br>
I'll be honest, I don't believe in ghost stories. What we're dealing with here is probably a micro-sized Mirror Sea, like Torricelli speculated.<br>
And we know how to deal with those. Locate the central control unit and destroy it, or look for another way out. There's our plan! Let's pull ourselves together and go get 'em, girls!<br>
{{折叠面板|内容结束}}

{{折叠面板|标题=Phantom Sea|选项=19|主框=1|样式=primary|展开=是}}
<br>
Many minutes, or possibly hours later...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Alfredo Oriani：</span><br>
I can't keep going... I'm dead tired... Please let me rest...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Leonardo da Vinci：</span><br>
Hang in there just a little longer. My wind gauge says there's air blowing in from up ahead. That has to mean we're near the exit!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Alfredo Oriani：</span><br>
Really? Your gadgets save us once again... Alright, I'll keep going just a while longer!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Emanuele Pessagno：</span><br>
I see a light in the distance...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Alfredo Oriani：</span><br>
Me too! That's the sign we're almost out of here!<br>
Better put on my shades just to be safe. Don't wanna get flashbanged by going from pitch black to broad daylight, you know!<br>
Teach, Ema, take care you don't get blinded yourselves!<br>
<br>
As they got closer to the exit, the party felt like the darkness around them lifted up somewhat.<br>
Eventually, they passed a threshold. However, they didn't emerge into broad daylight like Alfredo expected.<br>
No, they found themselves in a barren sea beneath a starless night sky.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Leonardo da Vinci：</span><br>
What?! There's an ocean under the Colosseum?!<br>
...No, what am I saying?! This is obviously the Mirror Sea!<br>
Usually, that would be a bad thing... But in this case, it's strangely reassuring.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Alfredo Oriani：</span><br>
Yeah! Now we just need to find and destroy the central control unit to get out of here!<br>
Phew... I'm just glad the Sirens are behind all this, not spooky ghosts!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Emanuele Pessagno：</span><br>
Even so, the scenery changed so suddenly that it makes me feel uneasy...<br>
I mean, we've never entered a Mirror Sea on foot before, have we?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Alfredo Oriani：</span><br>
Hey! We're underground, yet there's sky above us! And... is that an aurora?<br>
This is a photo op you can't afford to miss! I'm gonna photograph every nook and cranny of this special Mirror Sea!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Emanuele Pessagno：</span><br>
Um... Is this really the time for taking pictures?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Alfredo Oriani：</span><br>
Why not? There's not a threat in sight. I bet the Sirens abandoned this place!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Leonardo da Vinci：</span><br>
Regardless of what you think about it, we know this is a Mirror Sea, and we still don't know where Roma is.<br>
Stay on your toes, girls. If it really WAS that easy to just walk your way out, we wouldn't be here searching for Roma.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Alfredo Oriani：</span><br>
Will do, Teach! Let's proceed cautiously and see what we can find in here!<br>
{{折叠面板|内容结束}}

{{折叠面板|标题=Emerald Shadow|选项=20|主框=1|样式=primary|展开=是}}
<br>
*click click*!<br>
Alfredo took the lead. The flash of her camera not only took photographs, but also illuminated their surroundings.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Alfredo Oriani：</span><br>
So, I've figured something out about this place!<br>
That aurora we saw isn't an aurora at all. It's a flock of eagles emitting a weird green light!<br>
I'd wager these birdies are the phenomenon Janus and Bristol saw!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Leonardo da Vinci：</span><br>
Geesh, that has to be one massive flock for us to confuse them for an aurora.<br>
What are they, though? How'd they leave and get spotted beyond the boundary of the Mirror Sea?<br>
Wait, what if they're not mere apparitions, but full-blown mass-produced Sirens?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Alfredo Oriani：</span><br>
Heheheh... That's enough long-distance shots for now.<br>
Wish I could get some close-ups, too. Forget selling it to the highest bidder – I could win an award for something so spectacular.<br>
Oh, look! That eagle's flying alone! That deserves a pic!<br>
<br>
Alfredo aimed her lens at the lone eagle and snapped several photos of it in flight.<br>
The flash seemingly caught the bird's attention. It changed course and made a rapid descent towards the party.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Emanuele Pessagno：</span><br>
Watch out, Alfredo! I think this eagle is a Siren!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Alfredo Oriani：</span><br>
Huh?<br>
<br>
KABOOOM!<br>
Emanuele promptly trained her anti-air guns on the attacking bird of prey and shot it down.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Alfredo Oriani：</span><br>
THAT was close. What the heck?! I was just taking pictures!<br>
Ugh... That confirms it! This is definitely a Mirror Sea, and those things ARE Sirens!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Emanuele Pessagno：</span><br>
Get ready! The rest of the flock has noticed us!<br>
Wait... What's that?!<br>
<br>
While the three fought off the eagles with anti-air fire, they caught sight of something strange down at sea level.<br>
A fleet of ghostly mass-produced ships, see-through and glowing green just like the eagles, appeared on the horizon.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Alfredo Oriani：</span><br>
Now there are ghost ships too?!<br>
THAT'S a rare sight! Gotta snap some photos!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Leonardo da Vinci：</span><br>
They may look like ghosts, but they're clearly mass-produced ships. Interesting... I'm a hundred percent sure they're a product of this Mirror Sea.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Emanuele Pessagno：</span><br>
Uh, girls? Focus. We need to fight them...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Alfredo Oriani：</span><br>
Oh, right! We need to fight! Be careful, you two!<br>
{{折叠面板|内容结束}}

{{折叠面板|标题=The Mirror Sea's Structure|选项=21|主框=1|样式=primary|展开=是}}
<br>
KABOOOM!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Alfredo Oriani：</span><br>
Ugh! They just keep coming!<br>
Those eagles especially! We'll run out of ammo if we keep trying to shoot them all down!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Leonardo da Vinci：</span><br>
Crap... We can't win this war of attrition, so we have to fall back for now!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Emanuele Pessagno：</span><br>
Then we should try the island to the west. It's covered in forest, plus I can see a Siren-looking facility on it.<br>
The Sirens might leave us alone if we can make it there... Maybe.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Alfredo Oriani：</span><br>
It's worth a shot! How are we supposed to shake 'em off, though?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Leonardo da Vinci：</span><br>
By vanishing from sight! Alfredo, lay down a smokescreen!<br>
Okay! Here we go! Work your magic, Equipment Level-Upper!<br>
<br>
Da Vinci resurfaced and threw a gadget in Alfredo's direction.<br>
The gadget swiftly took effect on Alfredo's smoke bomb, kicking it into overdrive.<br>
Then, in the blink of an eye, the smoke grew thicker and blanketed a vast swath of the sea.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Leonardo da Vinci：</span><br>
Now's our chance! Run like your lives depend on it!<br>
<br>
The party successfully fled from the Sirens. Arriving at the island, they went into hiding.<br>
Having lost sight of their targets, the eagles returned to the skies and the ghost ships disappeared.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Alfredo Oriani：</span><br>
That was close... At least we're safe for now.<br>
Hey, Teach, whatcha working on there?<br>
Looking for treasure? You reckon we'll find a chest in this place? If you do, let me snap a pic before you open it!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Emanuele Pessagno：</span><br>
You're not taking this seriously at all, are you? ...That said, I'm also curious about what she's up to.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Leonardo da Vinci：</span><br>
What? I'm looking for a way to operate this facility. Seems to be an old production center of some sort.<br>
Let's see... If I'm remembering the Iron Blood's and the Commander's intel about Mirror Seas right...<br>
<br>
Da Vinci produced a gadget from her satchel and started tampering with the facility's control panel.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Leonardo da Vinci：</span><br>
Bingo! If my guess is correct, this is the place where those eagles and ghost ships were manufactured.<br>
Heheh... I'm going to put this bad boy to good use♪<br>

<br>
Somewhere in the Expo Venue...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Shimakaze：</span><br>
They've finally let us in, Suruga!<br>
Phew~ It's so nice to get to stretch my legs a bit!<br>
Since Shinano said we're free to enjoy ourselves, I'm heading straight for the exhibit to have a look ar– Ouch!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Suruga：</span><br>
We're here to gather intel, not mess around.<br>
Shinano can't stay long at the expo, remember? That's why she tasked us with keeping tabs on all the other factions.<br>
With good reason, too. The Sardegnians have been on edge for a while now. Shinano was right in saying something strange is going on.<br>
So let's start with a tour around the pavilions. Keep your eyes and ears open, got it?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Shimakaze：</span><br>
Got it! Forgive me for getting overexcited for a moment. I'll head that-a-way and have a look, if that's okay!<br>
Onwards to the next exhibit area! Full speed ahe– Owow! Hey! Was it really necessary to bonk me twice?!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Suruga：</span><br>
Don't run off yet, scatterbrain! We need a plan first!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Shimakaze：</span><br>
Oh! Off-topic, but look! That guest seems rather anxious!<br>
Almost like she's lost, wouldn't you say? We should help her!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Suruga：</span><br>
(Who? That Iron Blood girl?)<br>
(Yikes, she looks like a bomb waiting to go off... Better steer clear of her, lest she vents her anger on us.)<br>
(Intel-gathering is supposed to be done on the low. Talking to her and getting roped into something is the LAST thing I need!)<br>
Ahem! Yes, she looks like she could use some directions, but how are we supposed to help?<br>
We don't know our way around here either. There's not much we can do for her.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Shimakaze：</span><br>
No, I suppose not...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Suruga：</span><br>
So unfortunate! Now let's find a quiet place and form a plan.<br>
<br>
Suruga grabbed Shimakaze's hand and started scurrying off elsewhere. However...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">???：</span><br>
Hold it, you two! Don't ignore me!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Suruga：</span><br>
(Dammit, dammit, dammit! Okay, need to come up with an excuse to get her off our case! Think, Suruga, think!)<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Shimakaze：</span><br>
S-Suruga? What's the matter?<br>
<br>
Suruga froze in place as she racked her brain.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">???：</span><br>
You're Sardegnian, aren't you?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Suruga：</span><br>
(...Sardegnian?)<br>
<br>
Suruga looked over her shoulder and spotted two Sardegnian shipgirls who had appeared seemingly from nowhere.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Bolzano：</span><br>
Yes. I'm Bolzano, and this is Giuseppe Garibaldi. Would you kindly tell us your name?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Prinz Rupprecht：</span><br>
Prinz Rupprecht. You'd be wise to remember it.<br>
Listen here. There are weird things going on around here.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Bolzano：</span><br>
Weird things? I'm afraid I don't know what you mean. Everything is in order to the best of my knowledge.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Prinz Rupprecht：</span><br>
So I hope. But then explain why you're off to the Colosseum in such a rush.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Bolzano：</span><br>
Well, um... We're members of staff, see? We just finished our patrols and are heading back to the employee area.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Giuseppe Garibaldi：</span><br>
Aww, are you lost, little girl? We can show you back to the Iron Blood pavilion if you want.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Prinz Rupprecht：</span><br>
I'm perfectly fine right here, thank you very much! And who are you calling a little girl?!<br>
Besides, aren't you in a hurry? You've got better things to do than play babysitter.<br>
Since you won't tell me what's going on, I'll just find out myself! Hmph!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Giuseppe Garibaldi：</span><br>
...You hear that? What a piece of work.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Bolzano：</span><br>
She's right, however. We have to focus on our own task over helping others.<br>
People have realized something is wrong. First the Sakura Empire, now the Iron Blood as well.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Giuseppe Garibaldi：</span><br>
Seems so... Come on, we'd better hurry.<br>
This incident is too important to leave up to a group of kids like da Vinci's team.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Shimakaze：</span><br>
Are you alright, Suruga?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Suruga：</span><br>
Phew... Thank god she wasn't talking about us.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Shimakaze：</span><br>
Yup. I think she thought it'd be better to ask the Sardegnian staff instead.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Suruga：</span><br>
Have they left?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Shimakaze：</span><br>
I believe so. They must be headed for the Colosseum.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Suruga：</span><br>
(The place Shinano outright said is dangerous...)<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Shimakaze：</span><br>
Well then, Suruga, where do we go? You said something about forming a plan, right?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Suruga：</span><br>
(Considering where we are now and where those two went...)<br>
To the Eagle Union's area, for a start.<br>
(Everything will be fine as long as we stay far away from Sardegna's area! Shimakaze won't get the chance to rope us into someone else's business!)<br>

Bolzano and Garibaldi made it to the Colosseum where they found the door to the underground warehouse.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Bolzano：</span><br>
Here it is. The place where we last recorded the signal from da Vinci's team.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Giuseppe Garibaldi：</span><br>
Mhm. No sign of Emanuele or any of the rest ever since then.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Bolzano：</span><br>
It's like they vanished off the face of the earth, just like Roma. I can only pray no harm has come to them...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Giuseppe Garibaldi：</span><br>
Chill out, Bolzano. If we make a huge fuss, it'll reflect poorly upon the expo. You already know that, right?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Bolzano：</span><br>
...You're right. With any luck, we'll succeed in resolving this incident.<br>
If we don't, we'll have no choice but to mobilize Veneto's rearguard, and then the cat will really be out of the bag.<br>
<br>
Colosseum - Underground Warehouse<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Bolzano：</span><br>
Do you read me, da Vinci? Come in, da Vinci.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Giuseppe Garibaldi：</span><br>
Still nothing, huh?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Bolzano：</span><br>
No. No response from her, Alfredo, or Emanuele.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Giuseppe Garibaldi：</span><br>
Yet we can still contact Veneto. Wonder what's the deal with that.<br>
What if there's an underground Mirror Sea near here? Wouldn't be the most far-fetched thing in the world.<br>
Well, I guess it'd be more like a Mirror Space in that case...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Bolzano：</span><br>
Hold up, Garibaldi! Isn't this the storage area?<br>
I'm not familiar with these artifacts. Could you have a look?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Giuseppe Garibaldi：</span><br>
Give me a sec.<br>
Looks like... the Royal Navy's exhibition items, as well as some of the stuff our own higher-ups brought in.<br>
And look, there are signs that someone was moving stuff around in here not too long ago...<br>
Hang on a minute! Where's the...?<br>
A storage case is missing! Where the hell has it gone?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Bolzano：</span><br>
Based on what we know, I'd speculate that someone stole it after disabling the surveillance cameras.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Giuseppe Garibaldi：</span><br>
Well, presumably, but how? The Colosseum's main and service entrances are maximum security.<br>
I'm starting to think this incident is way bigger than we first imagined...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Bolzano：</span><br>
Check if any other cases are missing. I'll radio Veneto in the meanwhile.<br>
Veneto, this is Bolzano. We're inside the... Veneto?<br>
...My communicator isn't working!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Communicator：</span><br>
BZZZZZZT...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Giuseppe Garibaldi：</span><br>
Crap, now even we've lost radio contact!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Bolzano：</span><br>
I'm afraid so... Looks like we're in the same pickle as everyone else now...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Giuseppe Garibaldi：</span><br>
Fine, I'm up for a challenge. Though I can't say for sure if whoever is behind all this knows that we're here.<br>
We can't get to the bottom of this without getting our hands dirty anyway.<br>
We have a lot to investigate, like that "emerald eagle" Emanuele mentioned.<br>
Finally, we need to figure out who's trying to wreck our celebration of peace, and what they want with Roma...<br>
In any case, we can't afford to stand around! Let's go, Bolzano!<br>

<br>
Garibaldi and Bolzano emerged from the long, dark corridor beneath the Colosseum and found themselves in a vast seascape.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Giuseppe Garibaldi：</span><br>
Crazy how they built all this beneath the Colosseum. Jokes aside, what is this place?<br>
There's no way in hell this could've gone unnoticed during construction. It must've appeared very recently. What do you think, Bolzano?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Bolzano：</span><br>
It's quite clearly a Mirror Sea. That explains why our communicators stopped working.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Giuseppe Garibaldi：</span><br>
Well, yeah. I mean the place itself though. What do you make of it?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Bolzano：</span><br>
Let's see... This place looks pretty run-down, as if it's been abandoned for quite some time. There's something disconcerting about the architecture though...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Giuseppe Garibaldi：</span><br>
Yeah, it almost looks like... someone decided to build an identical copy of OUR Colosseum.<br>
The way everything's all fallen apart almost gives it a sense of foreboding...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Bolzano：</span><br>
Do you believe the Sirens designed it based on our World Expo?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Giuseppe Garibaldi：</span><br>
Who knows? But based on the other factions' experiences with the Sirens, I'd say pretty much anything is possible.<br>
So, now that we're here, what should we do next?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Bolzano：</span><br>
Locate and regroup with da Vinci's team, I'd say. We'll need all the backup we can get if we're to last long enough to find Roma.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Giuseppe Garibaldi：</span><br>
Sounds like a plan to me... Whoa, would you look at that aurora.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Bolzano：</span><br>
Quite the sight, isn't it? But something about it feels wrong to me...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Giuseppe Garibaldi：</span><br>
You're right... It's actually a massive flock of emerald eagles! I thought there was just one!<br>
Seems they're interested in us. How about we catch one and keep it as a pet?<br>
<br>
Garibaldi waved at the swarm of eagles soaring above, and that's when the "aurora" took on a new behavior.<br>
The green-glowing Siren creatures formed a coordinated swarm and began descending.<br>
The passive birds had become hunters, and the two shipgirls, their prey.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Bolzano：</span><br>
Garibaldi! Look out!<br>
Prepare all anti-air guns! Shoot them down before they can reach us!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Giuseppe Garibaldi：</span><br>
Huh? Okay! On it!<br>

<br>
KABOOOM!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Bolzano：</span><br>
Garibaldi! Are you alright?!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Giuseppe Garibaldi：</span><br>
I'm doing fine! Worry about yourself!<br>
These eagles aren't much of a threat on their own, but it's a whole 'nother story when you're talking about the entire flock!<br>
The ghost ships are a big problem too! This Mirror Sea is unlike anything I've ever seen before!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Bolzano：</span><br>
We would be in a better situation if I'd only paid better attention to our surroundings. I'm sorry...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Giuseppe Garibaldi：</span><br>
Don't say that. You're a lot more cautious than I am.<br>
Well... Seeing as we have no chance of winning, our best move is to retreat.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Bolzano：</span><br>
I agree, but unfortunately we can't. The entrance we arrived through seems to have disappeared.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Giuseppe Garibaldi：</span><br>
What?! Fine, then we'll just take cover somewhere over there instead!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Bolzano：</span><br>
Good idea. Then I shall distract them while you go look around for a–<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Giuseppe Garibaldi：</span><br>
Don't be ridiculous! Nobody is sacrificing themselves today. What you're gonna do is pick a direction and run!<br>
<br>
KABOOOM!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Giuseppe Garibaldi：</span><br>
Did... Did that come from the sky?<br>
<br>
The two looked up at the clouds, where they saw a fleet of sorts cruising through the air.<br>
There were dozens and dozens of blimps, all bearing the same ghastly appearance as the eagles and the ghost ships, advancing on the Sirens.<br>
Sights trained on the emerald eagles, they unleashed a storm of fire and lead on the flock.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Bolzano：</span><br>
Now there's airships coming for us?!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Giuseppe Garibaldi：</span><br>
No, not for us! They're targeting the Sirens!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Bolzano：</span><br>
I've never heard of them deploying such weapons before... Do you think this is a case of accidental friendly fire?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Giuseppe Garibaldi：</span><br>
Don't know, don't care! Just focus on breaking the enemy line to get us out of immediate danger!<br>

<br>
Mirror Sea - Sky Strata<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Alfredo Oriani：</span><br>
Da Vinci's our mechanic and Ema's our lookout, which leaves the role of captain... Guess the responsibility falls on me!<br>
Heheh, so this is what it's like to lead a fleet... Now I get how the Commander feels!<br>
This view and this sense of empowerment are to die for! Man, I wish I could do this all the time♪<br>
I have no idea how you constructed a ton of blimps from that tiny little island, but my hat's off to you for pulling it off, Teach!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Leonardo da Vinci：</span><br>
Me? I didn't construct anything. The facility was designed to produce these things. All I did was kind of take control of them.<br>
And they're our key to taking on those eagles and ghost ships. If they think they can outnumber us, we'll fight fire with fire!<br>
Aaand... There! Now we can issue commands from the flagship to the rest of the blimps!<br>
Simple ones, anyway. Stuff like, "Bring all guns to bear! Fire at all enemies in range!"<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Emanuele Pessagno：</span><br>
Engaging Sirens with plain old airships? I'm not so sure that's a good idea...<br>
Worse yet, we can't use our weapons from up here. I think we should get back down to sea...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Leonardo da Vinci：</span><br>
Trust me on this! While they don't look like much, these things are built with Siren tech through and through. Our strength easily rivals theirs!<br>
Sure, a fight against an equal number of mass-produced ships will be tough, but it's nothing we can't handle.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Emanuele Pessagno：</span><br>
If it'll be tough, maybe we shouldn't risk it in the first place?<br>
What if the flagship takes heavy damage? Then we're in serious trouble.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Leonardo da Vinci：</span><br>
Don't you worry, Ema! I've got it all worked out.<br>
If the flagship takes a direct hit, it'll automatically descend to sea level and we'll all be safe!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Emanuele Pessagno：</span><br>
Well, if you say so...<br>
<br>
Da Vinci's hastily created "Improvised Floaty Fleet" plotted a course for the Colosseum – the very center of the Mirror Sea – and set off at a moderate speed.<br>
Emanuele, in a way reminiscent of her time aboard da Recco's vessel, used her telescope to survey the Mirror Sea from afar. Da Vinci, meanwhile, concentrated on steering the flying fleet.<br>
The self-appointed captain – Alfredo – quickly forgot about her own role and became engrossed in taking photographs instead.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Alfredo Oriani：</span><br>
Brilliant! Also brilliant! What a glorious air armada I have!<br>
Heheh... I'll win like, every award ever if I'm allowed to publish these photos~<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Emanuele Pessagno：</span><br>
Move, Alfredo. You're blocking my telescope.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Alfredo Oriani：</span><br>
Move?! I'm the captain of this airship! I do whatever I please!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Emanuele Pessagno：</span><br>
Whatever you say... Uh, Captain Alfredo, I have something to report.<br>
<br>
Emanuele blocked Alfredo's camera with her hand and pointed down at the sea.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Emanuele Pessagno：</span><br>
There's someone fighting over there in the distance.<br>
I can't tell who exactly, but I'd assume they're either Roma or backup sent in by Veneto.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Alfredo Oriani：</span><br>
Oh no! We've got to help! Teach, change course to where that fight's taking place!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Leonardo da Vinci：</span><br>
Aye-aye, Cap'n!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Alfredo Oriani：</span><br>
Hehehe! Okay – full speed ahead!<br>
{{折叠面板|内容结束}}

{{折叠面板|标题=Air-Sea Joint Battle|选项=29|主框=1|样式=primary|展开=是}}
<br>
KABOOOM!<br>
Garibaldi and Bolzano succeeded in repelling the ghost ships and emerald eagles with the aid of Alfredo's air armada.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Bolzano：</span><br>
*pant*... *pant*... Did we win?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Alfredo Oriani：</span><br>
Hey! Are you girls okay?!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Giuseppe Garibaldi：</span><br>
We're fine. You got us out of a real tight one.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Bolzano：</span><br>
Seems our communicators function at short range. Alfredo, just what are those airships?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Alfredo Oriani：</span><br>
Ah, please direct technical questions to da Vinci. I barely know a thing about 'em!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Leonardo da Vinci：</span><br>
Well, I'm glad you asked! Let me give you a rundown...<br>
...And the Commander's intel was right! So I cut the facility's connection to the central control unit, gave myself administrator clearance, and rewrote the base instructions. That, in a nutshell, is how the Improvised Floaty Fleet came to be!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Giuseppe Garibaldi：</span><br>
Uh-huh. That went way over my head.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Bolzano：</span><br>
Likewise, but I've grasped the gist of our situation.<br>
Assuming your and da Vinci's hypothesis is correct, we will find the central control unit in the central Colosseum of this Mirror Sea.<br>
We need only to locate and destroy it, then a way out should present itself.<br>
While we still don't know where Roma is, she may have had the same idea as us and headed for the Colosseum.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Giuseppe Garibaldi：</span><br>
Yeah. Maybe we'll even run into her on the way there if we're lucky.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Bolzano：</span><br>
Precisely. Knowing her, she's bound to have engaged Sirens en route. It's likely we'll find traces of her battles, although there's no guarantee...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Alfredo Oriani：</span><br>
Either way, we won't make it out of here by standing around! Let's make a beeline for the Colosseum!<br>
Hop on and we'll give you a ride! These things go fast as heck!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Giuseppe Garibaldi：</span><br>
Never been on an airship before. Could be cool.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Bolzano：</span><br>
I'm inclined to agree. However, it's unwise for all of us to board because that will leave us without observers at sea level.<br>
We might overlook something important from that high in the sky. Furthermore, I don't feel comfortable with relying solely on the airships if we get into another battle.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Giuseppe Garibaldi：</span><br>
Good point. Can't use our guns while aboard, and we're screwed if they surround us.<br>
On second thought, no thanks. Bolzano and I will travel by sea. Try to maintain a low speed and provide support for us.<br>
If you can take care of the eagles and secure air supremacy, that'd be even better.<br>
We'll make it to the Colosseum in no time if all goes well – and have a good time along the way. Heheh.<br>
{{折叠面板|内容结束}}

{{折叠面板|标题=The Colosseum|选项=30|主框=1|样式=primary|展开=是}}
<br>
With the backing of the air armada, the Sardegnian girls finally made it to the Colosseum's vicinity.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Bolzano：</span><br>
Strange... There are hardly any Sirens around, despite how close we are to the Colosseum.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Giuseppe Garibaldi：</span><br>
Yeah, it's weird. There are eagles overhead but they're not attacking like they did when they first spotted us.<br>
You'd think the control unit would be their number one defense priority...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Bolzano：</span><br>
It's all very suspicious. Makes me think this could be a trap.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Giuseppe Garibaldi：</span><br>
Maybe. Walking into it is our only real choice, though.<br>
<br>
Mirror Sea - Colosseum<br>
<span style="color:#ff9900;">Roma：</span><br>
......<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Giuseppe Garibaldi：</span><br>
Roma! Thank god you're not hurt! We've come to bring you home!<br>
<span style="color:#ff9900;">Roma：</span><br>
......<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Giuseppe Garibaldi：</span><br>
Hello? Roma...?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Bolzano：</span><br>
Get back, Garibaldi! That's not the real Roma!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Giuseppe Garibaldi：</span><br>
Crap, you're right! I hastily assumed it was her based on looks alone!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Emanuele Pessagno：</span><br>
I think that's a Pawn, but she doesn't look quite like one...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Alfredo Oriani：</span><br>
Yeah! She's all see-through! You reckon she's a Siren creation, like the ghost ships?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Leonardo da Vinci：</span><br>
That doesn't sound right...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Alfredo Oriani：</span><br>
Huh? Why not?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Leonardo da Vinci：</span><br>
I don't know. I just get the feeling this Roma lookalike isn't any old regular Pawn.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Emanuele Pessagno：</span><br>
How so? What's so different about her aside from her appearance?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Leonardo da Vinci：</span><br>
I said I don't know! Let's just watch and see what she does.<br>
<span style="color:#ff9900;">Roma：</span><br>
......<br>
<br>
The "Pawn" turned on her heel and started walking away, as though she'd gotten bored of staring down the girls.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Giuseppe Garibaldi：</span><br>
Hey! Stop right there!<br>
<br>
Garibaldi moved forward with the intent of seizing the Pawn. Just as she did so, the eagles circling above the Colosseum cried out.<br>
All at once, they swooped down in a coordinated attack on Garibaldi.<br>
At the same time, the fleet of ghost ships took form once more on the horizon.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Alfredo Oriani：</span><br>
Air armada, fire at will!<br>
<span style="color:#ff9900;">Roma：</span><br>
......<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Bolzano：</span><br>
That's not Roma, Garibaldi! That's a Pawn!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Giuseppe Garibaldi：</span><br>
I know that! But we can't let her escape!<br>
Alfredo and company, keep the eagles and ghost ships busy! Bolzano and I will try to capture the Pawn!<br>
Here's me praying she's only as strong as a regular one!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Bolzano：</span><br>
Hopefully, otherwise this will be a hard fight. Let's go!<br>
{{折叠面板|内容结束}}

{{折叠面板|标题=The Mirror Sea's Secret|选项=31|主框=1|样式=primary|展开=是}}
<br>
Two fierce battles were taking place simultaneously at the Colosseum – one in the sky, and one at sea.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Alfredo Oriani：</span><br>
What the hell is going on at our port side? We need more firepower!<br>
They'll surround us sooner or later if we don't do something!<br>
Teach! Can't you get us more airships?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Leonardo da Vinci：</span><br>
Afraid not. This is everything the production center could muster, and I can't exactly upgrade Siren tech on the spot.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Alfredo Oriani：</span><br>
Welp! Then we have to play defensively and wait for good news from Bolzano and Garibaldi!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Emanuele Pessagno：</span><br>
I doubt we're gonna get good news anytime soon...<br>
<br>
Emanuele pointed down at the sea. The air was filled with smoke and fumes from the two Sardegnian girls' ongoing battle with the Pawn.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Alfredo Oriani：</span><br>
How is she still going?! Are they pulling their punches 'cause the Pawn looks so much like Roma?!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Emanuele Pessagno：</span><br>
That's probably not the problem. This Pawn is just way, way stronger than any others before it!<br>
I've seen how Roma fights from watching exercises, and I can tell you that Pawn's firepower is more or less on par with hers!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Leonardo da Vinci：</span><br>
What's worse, we can't just turn that Pawn to dust since she's our only clue to finding Roma. Although, defeating her is looking increasingly impossible.<br>
I'd estimate they'll only last another thirty minutes at most...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Alfredo Oriani：</span><br>
How'd you estimate that?! More importantly, what are we supposed to do?!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Leonardo da Vinci：</span><br>
Calm down! I'll think of something, just give me some time!<br>
<br>
A short while later...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Alfredo Oriani：</span><br>
The eagles are coming for our flagship! They're trying to take us down!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Leonardo da Vinci：</span><br>
Don't lose hope! I just need a bit more time...!<br>
<br>
Da Vinci frantically racked her brain for an answer to the crisis. Amidst her thinking, she noticed huge vines that had grown along the Colosseum's outer wall.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Emanuele Pessagno：</span><br>
Um, why don't we get off the ship for now...?<br>
I know we have an emergency escape plan, but we shouldn't use it unless we have to...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Leonardo da Vinci：</span><br>
Wait... I've got it!<br>
See those vines all over the Colosseum?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Emanuele Pessagno：</span><br>
Vines? What about them? Am I missing something?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Leonardo da Vinci：</span><br>
They're not plain vines, that much is obvious!<br>
Natural vines sprout from cracks in brick and stone. Given enough time, they can even make walls collapse!<br>
But these vines are different. They're not spreading from the cracks, but rather filling the holes left by cannon fire and reinforcing the load-bearing columns!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Alfredo Oriani：</span><br>
Seriously? So if anything they're maintaining the Colosseum's integrity, rather than compromising it?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Leonardo da Vinci：</span><br>
Correct! What's more, they're growing from right out of the sea! That's how I spotted 'em!<br>
You know what that means? The Colosseum will crumble if we can destroy whatever's producing them!<br>
And that's our ticket out of here! No need to take out all the Sirens or anything!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Alfredo Oriani：</span><br>
You're a genius, Teach! Okay, let's put the eagles aside and focus our assault on the vines!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Leonardo da Vinci：</span><br>
One more thing. I may just have a theory as to where the real Roma is.<br>
There's only one way to find out if I'm right or not, and I have to do it myself! Captain Alfredo, I'm getting off the ship!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Alfredo Oriani：</span><br>
You're what?! You know we're like, way up in the air, right?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Leonardo da Vinci：</span><br>
Not a problem! That's why I've got this handy Portable Hang Glider!<br>
<br>
Da Vinci produced a hang glider out of the blue, got into the pilot position, and began her graceful descent from the airship to the Colosseum.<br>

<br>
Mirror Sea - Beneath the Colosseum<br>
Da Vinci dove beneath the waves.<br>
As she went deeper and deeper, the booming sounds of the battle being fought at the surface gave way to near silence.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Leonardo da Vinci：</span><br>
Boy, I'm having to go deeper than I expected...<br>
The Sirens no doubt predicted that anyone with common sense would head for the Colosseum.<br>
I'll bet they assumed we wouldn't check underneath the surface. At most we'd notice the vines and destroy the Colosseum's top half.<br>
And that assumption was where they went wrong. They might've fooled everyone else, but not me!<br>
<br>
Going deeper into the dark depths, da Vinci eventually came face to face with a massive machine.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Leonardo da Vinci：</span><br>
Bingo. They really did hide their magic box where they thought no one would look.<br>
Let's see here... This is what's producing the vines, this thing manufactures the ghost ships, and this...<br>
A... containment chamber? That's got to be where Roma is!<br>
They must've hooked her up to some machine that reads her neural data in real time. That'd explain why that Pawn is so exceptionally strong.<br>
Judging by the shape of this thing, Roma should be just a bit farther down...<br>
<br>
Moving along a network of tubes, da Vinci descended deeper. Then, she found it – a square chamber encased in glass, anchored in place.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Leonardo da Vinci：</span><br>
Look at these energy readings...! I've found you, Roma!<br>
Alright, if I can sever the anchoring and power cables, the chamber should rise to the surface on its own.<br>
My torpedoes are just enough for the job. A few well-placed hits should do it!<br>
Just hang in there, Roma! I'm coming to save you!<br>
That's everything set up for her rescue. Now the question is, what to do about this huge machine...<br>
Between it and the Colosseum, I don't know which is the Mirror Sea's beating heart. Although, I guess it doesn't matter. If this thing breaks, the Colosseum goes down with it.<br>
Let's see, how does one efficiently destroy a–<br>
<br>
All of a sudden, the sea shook.<br>
In the midst of her pondering, da Vinci was swept up by a strong current coming from below, dragging her closer to the surface.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Leonardo da Vinci：</span><br>
What the–?! What's going on?!<br>
Where's this current coming from?! Below me?!<br>
No way! Don't tell me they had another machine deeper down!<br>
<br>
All of a sudden, the sea shook.<br>
From the surface. From the Colosseum.<br>
It had begun collapsing into the sea. The others had succeeded in eliminating the vines, and without the support they provided, the Colosseum could not stay standing.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Leonardo da Vinci：</span><br>
Crap, crap! These currents are pushing me all over the place!<br>
Okay, change of plans! Ensuring Roma's safety comes first!<br>
<br>
Da Vinci rushed to the chamber containing Roma and steadied it, making sure it wouldn't be swept away. When she looked over her shoulder, she saw the underwater torrents tearing the massive Siren machine apart.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Leonardo da Vinci：</span><br>
Well, that saves me the trouble of destroying it myself... Hang on tight, Roma! I'm gonna get you back to the surface now!<br>
<br>
With the Mirror Sea's central control unit destroyed, all its defenders—the emerald eagles, the ghost ships, and the Pawn—vanished into thin air in the twinkle of an eye.<br>
Da Vinci and Roma resurfaced, and the first thing that greeted them was the welcome sight of their allies.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Bolzano：</span><br>
It won't be long before the Mirror Sea disappears altogether. That aside...<br>
Lady Roma, are you okay? Please, answer us!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Roma：</span><br>
*cough cough*... Ugh... Where am I...?<br>
It feels as though I've awoken from a long dream...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Giuseppe Garibaldi：</span><br>
Looks like she's alright... Huh? What do you have there, Roma?<br>
<br>
Roma raised the tile in her hand. She had held onto it ever since blacking out inside the warehouse.<br>
The tile was covered in cracks, as if it had been hit with a hammer. As if that wasn't strange enough, more cracks formed as the Mirror Sea continued dissipating all around them.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Roma：</span><br>
It's a replica of a tile from the Great Library... It was being stored in the warehouse...<br>
I knew something was amiss from the moment I laid eyes on it.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Alfredo Oriani：</span><br>
This is your captain speaking – we have landed! ...There you are, Roma! Thank god we found you!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Roma：</span><br>
What are those... airships?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Alfredo Oriani：</span><br>
Hahaha! You won't believe it, but da Vinci created these! All it took was commandeering a Siren facility – and a bit of her genius!<br>
And I'll tell you, these things served us well in here! Sucks they'll disappear along with the Mirror Sea, but oh well.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Roma：</span><br>
It sounds like you have a great story to tell later. It's a shame I didn't get the pleasure of fighting with you.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Alfredo Oriani：</span><br>
Teach? Oh god, are you okay?! Don't tell me she–<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Leonardo da Vinci：</span><br>
I'm fiiine, just resting in the water... I'm dead tired.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Alfredo Oriani：</span><br>
Phew... Well, hate to crush your dreams, but now's not the time to rest! C'mon, get up!<br>
<br>
Alfredo pulled out a tripod from nowhere and placed her camera on it. She then ran up behind da Vinci and forced her into a picture-worthy pose.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Alfredo Oriani：</span><br>
We can't NOT take a victory photo after a job well done!<br>
Three seconds! Ema, pose for the camera!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Emanuele Pessagno：</span><br>
Huh?! Just like that?!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Leonardo da Vinci：</span><br>
Frickin'... Fine... If you insist!<br>
<br>
Emanuele turned her head in confusion while da Vinci wrapped one arm behind Alfredo's neck and made a peace sign to the camera with the other.<br>
The shutter clicked as the moment was immortalized.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Alfredo Oriani：</span><br>
*cough cough*! Well, mission accomplished! Time to go home!<br>

Ahhh~ I don't think I'll ever get tired of the view from up here!<br>
Yup yup, this occasion calls for a photo op! *click*...<br>
<br>
Just as the shutter clicked, a shipgirl in white came into view through the camera's lens.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Janus：</span><br>
I-I'm sorry! Did I get in your way...?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Leonardo da Vinci：</span><br>
Hm? Aren't you... Janus from the Royal Navy?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Janus：</span><br>
Y-yes!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Leonardo da Vinci：</span><br>
What's up? Lost your way again?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Janus：</span><br>
N-not at all! I saw you from a distance and, um... I came to give you my thanks!<br>
You were kind enough to show me the directions yesterday... and I didn't even thank you properly because I was in too much of a rush...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Alfredo Oriani：</span><br>
No problemo~ My job was to patrol the venue anyway, and helping lost kiddos like you is part of the job!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Janus：</span><br>
I-I'm truly grateful for your help! I'll be off then...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Alfredo Oriani：</span><br>
See you around! Enjoy the expo~!<br>

Colosseum - Waiting Room<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Alfredo Oriani：</span><br>
Roma, I've come to visit!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Emanuele Pessagno：</span><br>
Shhh! Roma is still resting after her inspection...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Alfredo Oriani：</span><br>
Oops, sorry about that!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Roma：</span><br>
There's no need to fret. I feel a bit tired, but that's about all.<br>
Once again, allow me to thank you for saving me yesterday.<br>
Da Vinci, I heard you rescued me from the Siren device yourself.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Leonardo da Vinci：</span><br>
Well... Who wouldn't rescue a friend in need? It's no big deal.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Roma：</span><br>
You're just as humble as Veneto. You should bask proudly in Roma's praise.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Leonardo da Vinci：</span><br>
Haha! Thanks for the words of encouragement then! I am Sardegna's pride and joy genius inventor after all!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Roma：</span><br>
...Now you swung too far in the other direction, but I suppose that's fine.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Alfredo Oriani：</span><br>
We're all just glad you're back safe and sound, Roma!<br>
You still have a few inspections left though, right? We'll be able to take care of everything around the expo venue, so you just rest easy! See you around then––<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Leonardo da Vinci：</span><br>
Wait, Alfredo, there was one more thing we needed to do.<br>
Roma, would you mind answering a few questions before we go? It's fine if you don't want to.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Roma：</span><br>
Ask away. You saved my life after all, so it's the least I can do to repay you.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Leonardo da Vinci：</span><br>
First off, do you really remember nothing about what happened yesterday?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Roma：</span><br>
Hmm, let me think... It felt like I was in a long, long dream. Something may have happened inside the dream, but I can't exactly remember anymore.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Leonardo da Vinci：</span><br>
I see, I see. So, if I say "emerald eagle" or "ghost ships," neither of those ring a bell? Did your dreams have anything to do with those things?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Roma：</span><br>
There... might be some connection, but I can't say for sure...<br>
I don't remember exactly what happened inside the dream, but when you said those words, I did feel something stirring inside my mind...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Leonardo da Vinci：</span><br>
Alright, onto the next question... During the expo's opening ceremony, did anything feel off to you about the Colosseum?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Roma：</span><br>
What do you mean by that? Was there something wrong with the Colosseum?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Leonardo da Vinci：</span><br>
Umm, not quite... well... how should I put this...<br>
Something about the venue's vibes, or the scenery... or how it's very Sardegna-like...?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Alfredo Oriani：</span><br>
Sardegna-like? What do you mean by that? I mean, we are the sponsors, but it's still an international expo.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Roma：</span><br>
I think I somewhat understand what da Vinci is trying to convey.<br>
Even though I'm generally not sensitive to these kinds of things, there was something that left a deep impression within me.<br>
I felt the overwhelming elation of basking in Sardegna's splendor. But then, that splendor began to gradually fade away.<br>
But I wonder if this incident has compromised Veneto's plans... Perhaps we should hold a military exercise after all to demonstrate our might––<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Leonardo da Vinci：</span><br>
Actually, how about we don't? On second thought, there was probably just something funny in the air yesterday!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Alfredo Oriani：</span><br>
Something in the air? What even are you talking about now?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Leonardo da Vinci：</span><br>
Don't worry about it, it's just a figure of speech~♪<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Emanuele Pessagno：</span><br>
I hate to agree with Alfredo, but I don't feel anything off either...?<br>
Maybe that's what happens to people who work too hard all the time: you start seeing things.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Roma：</span><br>
Working too hard, huh...<br>
I do hope that's actually the case...<br>

Speaking of which, did you get to the root of the green ghost incident?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Bristol：</span><br>
The green ghost, huh... Well, uh, the investigation is still underway!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Shangri-La：</span><br>
...And how exactly are you conducting this investigation?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Bristol：</span><br>
By, uhh... Just know I'm looking into it!<br>
I have a hunch that phenomenon is the veil that shrouds a huge revelation!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ingraham：</span><br>
It's already been three days. Isn't it about time to give up?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Bristol：</span><br>
It's ONLY been three days! Detective Bristol and Data 857 won't give up that easily!<br>
Come on, help a friend out and join my investigation, Ingraham!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ingraham：</span><br>
Heck no. I still find walking through these pavilions far more entertaining.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Bristol：</span><br>
I see... Then I'll head off on my own! The investigation won't conduct itself!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Essex：</span><br>
Be careful out there!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Bristol：</span><br>
I will!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Shangri-La：</span><br>
Essex, are you sure we should be letting that girl run around as she pleases?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Essex：</span><br>
Honestly, I wouldn't be surprised if it's just her overactive imagination at work again.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Shangri-La：</span><br>
Are you sure you're doing this to make her feel like she had a big role to play, or are you actually curious yourself?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Essex：</span><br>
I... I'm not going to admit to either one of those...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Jeanne d'Arc：</span><br>
Lady Essex? May I come in?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Essex：</span><br>
Jeanne d'Arc from Iris Libre! Thank you for coming all the way over here.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Jeanne d'Arc：</span><br>
I'm most grateful that you graciously accepted my sudden request. I've heard a lot of good things about you.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Essex：</span><br>
Same here. Your efforts at the Basilica are known far and wide.<br>
......<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Jeanne d'Arc：</span><br>
Ahem... Um, in any case, does the Eagle Union's delegation have any upcoming plans?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Essex：</span><br>
Not at the moment. Do you have any suggestions for exhibits I should see?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Jeanne d'Arc：</span><br>
Why yes, actually! If you don't mind, I'd be glad to show you around our Arc de Triomphe.<br>
You're more than welcome to have dinner with us as well.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Essex：</span><br>
Sounds great! Part of our mission is to deepen our bonds with Iris Libre anyway.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Jeanne d'Arc：</span><br>
Excellent! Please let me know once you're all ready to go then!<br>

Hmm~♪ Hmhm~♪<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Z2：</span><br>
I'm glad to see you in high spirits, but umm, allow me to offer you a few words of caution.<br>
Don't you think you should be keeping Rupprecht and Odin on a tighter leash?<br>
Are you not worried that they'll get into trouble?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Prinz Eugen：</span><br>
What trouble? The World Expo is a celebration of peace. There's no way they'd get into a fight.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Z2：</span><br>
That's not what I'm talking about. You know, blueprint ships, out in the open...?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Prinz Eugen：</span><br>
Is there a problem with that? Hehe, if you ask me, it's totally fine. People want to take a closer look at our blueprint ships, so why not let them?<br>
If they want to know about our girls so badly, they can just ask~<br>
Besides, even if I tried to take a more... domineering approach, Odin's a grouchy loner and Rupprecht doesn't like taking orders. So what's the point?<br>
That's why it's better to let the chips fall where they may. We're all happier that way~<br>
But look at you, worrying about other people again. You really are a sweetheart, Thiele.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Z2：</span><br>
I'm not worried about you in the slightest. I just get the feeling that I'm being dragged into another annoying mess again.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Prinz Eugen：</span><br>
Oh my, look who just came out from the Dragon Empery's pavilion... The one and only Kronshtadt.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Z2：</span><br>
Yeah, what about her? ...What are you trying to do?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Prinz Eugen：</span><br>
We made a promise to go out for drinks the next time we met. And now is that time~<br>
Heehee. I wonder what kinds of stories she'll tell me this time.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Z2：</span><br>

Joffre opened up a memo on top of the table in the break room that detailed each faction's movements since the expo's start.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Foch：</span><br>
Iron Blood, the Sakura Empire, the Eagle Union, and Iris Libre...<br>
Sardegna and the Northern Parliament are in close touch with each other, and the Dragon Empery is rising...<br>
As for me, I just hope more people will stop by our pavilion.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Joffre：</span><br>
There are benefits to having fewer guests. Such as having to do less work.<br>
Our mission is to look after this pavilion and take care of the guests. Your musings are superfluous, Foch.<br>
Even if we know exactly what each faction is doing... It won't do us any good.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Foch：</span><br>
That may be the case. But unlike Dunkerque and Algérie, I'm not one to sit around on my hands.<br>

Avrora, huh? Joffre, what's the plan?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Joffre：</span><br>
Nothing in particular. Let's extend a warm greeting – to our fellow shipgirl.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Foch：</span><br>
You're right. As representatives of the Vichya Dominion, we should show hospitality to our guests. L'Indomptable, could you tell Avrora to wait a minute? I'll be there shortly.<br>

Marco Polo? Are you in here?<br>
The expo YOU proposed is going on right above you, and you're not going to go take a look?<br>

<br>
The anxious Conte di Cavour opened the door to Marco Polo's room.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Conte di Cavour：</span><br>
I should've known she wouldn't be here. Does that mean she already succeeded?<br>
I really don't get her. If she did succeed, shouldn't she be here lounging in a wine bath with a goofy grin on her face?<br>
<br>
She searched around the room some more, but Marco Polo was indeed nowhere to be found.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Conte di Cavour：</span><br>
Maybe she already went up to check out the expo? She never was one to sit still, just like Cesare.<br>
Well, that's none of my concern.<br>
Guess I'll drop my report off on her desk and be on my merry way...<br>

She placed the carefully-bound bundle of papers on Marco Polo's desk before turning to leave.<br>
That is when she realized she wasn't alone. Another shipgirl stood in the corner of the room.<br>
