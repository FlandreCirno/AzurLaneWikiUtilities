Operation Divergent Chessboard<br>
——If two opposing bishops are on different-colored squares, they would be fated to never meet.<br>
<span style="color:#ff0000;">???：</span><br>
……<br>
Wake up. The battle is about to begin.<br>
………<br>
<span style="color:#ff0000;">Tirpitz：</span><br>
...I had a really long dream.<br>
I dreamed of a world of ice... A lonely, desolate world on the border between the transient and reality...<br>
<span style="color:#ff0000;">Graf Zeppelin：</span><br>
A dream...? Nonsense. A mere Pawn like you does not dream. Even if you did, it would merely be a fragment of your own thoughts, like a hallucination.<br>
<span style="color:#ff0000;">Deutschland：</span><br>
Bah, who cares whether you were dreaming or hallucinating. It doesn't matter either way.<br>
The only thing that matters now is that the White Pieces have entered the Mirror Sea.<br>
If you don't want to get sacrificed then you'd better get ready to fight.<br>
<span style="color:#ff0000;">Tirpitz：</span><br>
Sacrificed, huh...<br>
<span style="color:#ff0000;">Deutschland：</span><br>
Ahhah~! I, Deutschland, will spearhead the attack! Interceptions are my forte, after all! I bet it'll just be another round of shooting fish in a barrel anyway.<br>
They will learn the true horror of facing the best Panzerschiff in the world!<br>

<span style="color:#ff0000;">Deutschland：</span><br>
Gaaagghhh! How dare you lowly animal slaves... do this to me?! <br>
I'd rather sink than surrender to lowly animals like you!<br>
<span style="color:#ff0000;">???：</span><br>
The Gambit... It's failed 255 times now. Is this really all the evolution the Natural Calculation System is capable of?<br>
But it's much faster than I originally estimated! Humans... or rather, "natural evolution", takes a long time~<br>
However, this won't satisfy the Judge. We need more Pieces... <br>
Just as long as we don't dispatch the Mirror Images we created...<br>
It's fine. They will operate exactly as they were taught... no, made to do.<br>
My production speed can meet all experiment demands as long as we have the backup of the Original.<br>
If that's the case then I guess I need not worry. However...<br>
I want White to be just an illusion this time...<br>

<span style="color:#ff0000;">U-557：</span><br>
...Arrived at the objective.<br>
No signs of the enemy. Cancelling high alert status. Ascending to periscope depth and entering snorkel navigation mode.<br>
<span style="color:#ff0000;">U-47：</span><br>
Guess it's just like the intel said. The wind doesn't blow out here.<br>
<span style="color:#ff0000;">U-557：</span><br>
Feels like the pressure's way higher than on the outside too... This doesn't feel right...<br>
Let's just finish the mission and head back...<br>
<span style="color:#ff0000;">U-47：</span><br>
Hold up. A target is approaching. Judging by the identification signal, they're... allied?<br>
<span style="color:#ff0000;">U-557：</span><br>
There's no way we'd have allied vessels out here... Maybe your sonar's broken?<br>
...Wait, no. I'm receiving their signal too...<br>
<span style="color:#ff0000;">U-47：</span><br>
Submerge and prepare for trouble. Remember what the commander said about not trusting anything out on the Mirror Sea.<br>
<span style="color:#ff0000;">U-557：</span><br>
True... We should just stay underwater and gather intel...<br>
<span style="color:#ff0000;">U-47：</span><br>
Stealth mission time... Too easy.<br>

<span style="color:#ff0000;">Admiral Hipper：</span><br>
Huh? You're supposed to be the new White? You look weak as hell.<br>
But you somehow beat Deut... I mean, Lützow... Whatever, in short you guys beat that tomboy charging into battle, yelling how she's "the world's greatest armored ship", right? Actually, don't answer, it's written all over your faces!<br>
I don't have any sympathy for that moron, but I can't just let her give you the wrong impression of Iron blood's might either!<br>
I, Admiral Hipper, the world's greatest heavy cruiser, will finish you off in the blink of an eye!<br>

<span style="color:#ff0000;">Gneisenau：</span><br>
*Sigh*... They let White come through. They always do. You can't entrust them with anything.<br>
You have a 31.75% chance of victory according to my simulations. But in a real battle... who knows?<br>
I am Gneisenau, Scharnhorst-class battlecruiser number two. I will assess your combat potential.<br>
{{折叠面板|内容结束}}

{{折叠面板|标题=Initiative 2|选项=6|主框=1|样式=primary|展开=是}}
<span style="color:#ff0000;">Gneisenau：</span><br>
The data in my simulation was wrong... You are a force to be reckoned with, indeed...<br>
But if I can join forces with my sister, our chances of winning will increase to above 80%...<br>
...It is time for me to make a tactical retreat.<br>
<span style="color:#ff0000;">Tirpitz：</span><br>
…<br>
<span style="color:#ff0000;">Graf Zeppelin：</span><br>
What's the matter?<br>
<span style="color:#ff0000;">Tirpitz：</span><br>
Every move White has made so far is different from the last time...<br>
<span style="color:#ff0000;">Graf Zeppelin：</span><br>
I see. Perhaps that's what the Judge is hoping for.<br>
<span style="color:#ff0000;">Tirpitz：</span><br>
I've been thinking about something... What if we're just meant to be...<br>
mere stepping stones for White to "evolve"...<br>
The Sirens gave us our powers... And what if this is all part of their plan...<br>
<span style="color:#ff0000;">Graf Zeppelin：</span><br>
Stop... Your ego will crumble if you keep thinking like that. Don't make her sacrifices for Iron blood all in vain...<br>
<span style="color:#ff0000;">Tirpitz：</span><br>
"Her"...?<br>
<span style="color:#ff0000;">Graf Zeppelin：</span><br>
...Never mind. She was a dreamer, just like you are. Hmph, what a fool she was, losing herself to her idealistic delusions...<br>
<span style="color:#ff0000;">Tirpitz：</span><br>
……<br>
<br>
              And yet, she was the one who paved the way towards a different future for our kind in this world...<br>

<span style="color:#ff0000;">Scharnhorst：</span><br>
If you've come this far, that can only mean one thing... I hate to admit it, but you might be just a little different from those we've fought so far.<br>
But we've never fought anyone that could escape from our mighty guns. You are no exception!<br>
<span style="color:#ff0000;">Gneisenau：</span><br>
I collected a lot of data during our last battle. This time our chances of winning are over 90%.<br>
<span style="color:#ff0000;">Scharnhorst：</span><br>
Listen up, you fools standing before the Shark Sisters! This is where our hunt begins! And don't you dare disappoint me!<br>
<span style="color:#ff0000;">Scharnhorst&Gneisenau：</span><br>
Scharnhorst-class battlecruisers Scharnhorst and Gneisenau, ready for battle! Come and face your doom!<br>

<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Tirpitz：</span><br>
This dream again... The Scandinavian snow, the fierce and raging wind... and the echoing roars from the engines of countless fighter planes...<br>
An explosion, followed by flooding... then the eternal darkness at the bottom of the sea...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">???：</span><br>
Is that you?<br>
You're Tirpitz... You're my sister...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Tirpitz：</span><br>
Who are you...?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">???：</span><br>
...I'm sorry... Please forgive me...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Tirpitz：</span><br>
My sister... Bismarck? No, that's impossible... I don't remember you... You shouldn't exist in my memory...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">???：</span><br>
I'm sorry... I did what I had to for the sake of Iron blood... I just want you to understand that...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Tirpitz：</span><br>
Agh... My head hurts... It's coming back... This overpowering sense of loneliness...<br>
<br>
                       ...Who... am I..?<br>
                       ...Just who am I... really...?<br>

State of emergency. An Awakening Response among the Pieces has been confirmed. The synchronization rate with the Player has gone up by 7%.<br>
An Awakening Response? That means soon we'll have the results the Judge was hoping for.<br>
Once you've fully confirmed the Awakening and recorded the sequence, I'll dispose of the backup of the Original. Don't forget that.<br>
You'll dispose of it? Wait, I just had an interesting idea...<br>
I will activate the quarantine mechanism and throw all the Black Pawns into the mix!<br>
Tester, what are you planning...?!<br>
This time I will personally ascertain the gap in potential of White... no, of the Natural Calculation System and humankind!<br>

<span style="color:#ff0000;">Z46：</span><br>
...Another interesting Piece has joined the fray.<br>
So you broke through all of our defenses? I see. A brilliant opponent, and a brilliant name... You've piqued my interest.<br>
I am the Z-Class destroyer Z46. I lack a real name to introduce myself with, though... Now let us fight, my brilliant opponents. Join me for a game of chess!<br>

<span style="color:#ff0000;">Z46：</span><br>
...The end... My lack of combat experience was my downfall, I see. I should have better demonstrated my planned anti-air superiority.<br>
Nonetheless... I never thought this world could be so different from what I expected! It's fascinating!<br>
The next time we meet... Will you play with me... once more?<br>

<span style="color:#ff0000;">Graf Zeppelin：</span><br>
So this is the beautiful afterglow of a life being thrown away...<br>
...I see. The existence of you pitiable Pieces worthy of annihilation is precisely what, for the first time ever, gives true meaning to my temporal life and to this war...<br>
I am the aircraft carrier Graf Zeppelin. My Iron blood Hellwings shall rain apocalyptic destruction down on you from the heavens!<br>
{{折叠面板|内容结束}}

{{折叠面板|标题=Deflection 2|选项=13|主框=1|样式=primary|展开=是}}
<span style="color:#ff0000;">Graf Zeppelin：</span><br>
So my incomplete form really was no match for you...<br>
Hmph... So it is. Another opportunity to slowly witness my own destruction...<br>
Ultimately, my army was no more than just another Piece... Oh, how ironic... Ahahahahah!<br>
<br>
...It was not meant to be like this...<br>
In order to become strong enough to protect Iron blood, to protect my allies,<br>
I made so many sacrifices, annihilated so many enemies, just following "orders."<br>
I tolerated becoming a Piece for our detestable enemies,「」…<br>
Akagi... Just what are you planning out there?<br>

And yet you still wish to proceed? So be it... I shall see how resolute you really are.<br>

So you were the ones chosen by the Creator. I have no choice but to acknowledge the gap in power between us.<br>
I now finally understand what my dreams mean. That there is a real world that lies beyond this mirrored one...<br>
And in that real world, there is another me who is fighting for Iron blood...<br>
Hahah... "Fight for your hopes and beliefs"... That's what I've always been unable to do in this world...<br>
If you happen to meet me again... could you tell me something? ...That "I want you to fight proudly till the very end"...<br>
<br>
                         Farewell, <br>
the other "me" beyond the mirror that I will never meet...<br>

Multiple Pawns have been Awakened at the same time, which makes the experiment a huge success.<br>
<span style="color:#ff0000;">?????：</span><br>
But what are you gonna do about the situation? If they steal the backup of the Original then it'll disrupt the war on the outside.<br>
<span style="color:#ff0000;">Tester β：</span><br>
As long as the quarantine mechanism is in place, they can't leave the Mirror Sea.<br>
In any case, White's evolutionary rate has drastically surpassed what the Natural Calculation System's simulations estimated.<br>
Now that we know that, we've achieved our goal.<br>
<span style="color:#ff0000;">?????：</span><br>
Which means you're...<br>
<span style="color:#ff0000;">Tester β：</span><br>
As a Tester, a living module within the debugging system, I plan to gather as much data for adjustments as possible.<br>
I will confirm if they're offering their souls as a sacrifice or if they're hoping to checkmate us~<br>

At long last we meet, the Creator's dear little chosen ones~!<br>
My, look at your eyes... In the eyes of that girl who asked us for power we saw only worries over the future, disappointment, and regret...<br>
But you girls are different. It has nothing to do with nations, ideals, or memories, but your bonds with humans...<br>
And that element you have is something indispensable for the evolution that we desire...<br>
However, we must know if that element is the real deal or not... And that's what I, Tester Beta, was created to find out!<br>
Now let the experiment begin!<br>

Did you record all that?<br>
<span style="color:#ff0000;">U-47：</span><br>
Yeah... I don't know how this fleet managed to appear again when it doesn't exist anymore... The situation is even worse than I thought.<br>
<span style="color:#ff0000;">？？？：</span><br>
Why, hello. I thought you 2 were bugs in our system, but you're no bugs, you're just little fish.<br>
<span style="color:#ff0000;">U-557：</span><br>
They found us... She never even showed up on my sonar...<br>
<span style="color:#ff0000;">U-47：</span><br>
We might be in trouble here... Submerge at max speed!<br>
<span style="color:#ff0000;">Observer：</span><br>
I can't just let you leave now that you've come this far.~<br>
So what do you say about becoming my new Pawns? I could turn you into a new species so we can gather more fascinating data.<br>
<span style="color:#ff0000;">U-47：</span><br>
We need to get this intel to the commander...!<br>
<span style="color:#ff0000;">U-557：</span><br>
U-47, go on without me... The enemy shouldn't be able to follow us down to our maximum depth...<br>
You're faster than me anyway. I'll try to buy you some time.<br>
<span style="color:#ff0000;">U-47：</span><br>
557…<br>
...Okay. I wish you good luck.<br>
<span style="color:#ff0000;">Observer：</span><br>
Well, look at that. Our data was right; you sure are good at running away. Hahah~!<br>
Now, how do you plan to get out of this one, little Miss. Left Behind?<br>
<span style="color:#ff0000;">U-557：</span><br>
...I used to be called an unlucky sub... and up until now I thought that was true...<br>
But now... it isn't anymore!<br>
My sisters, give me courage...!<br>

This is amazing! You've gone way beyond the Natural Calculation System's wildest estimates... Humans are amazing creatures!<br>
At this evolutionary speed, if we repeat the Returning War... no, the Planned War, over and over, one day we'll finally have what we need...!<br>
The Judge thinks very highly of your achievements! ...Thanks to you, even a subsystem like me was able to fulfill her duty~!<br>
