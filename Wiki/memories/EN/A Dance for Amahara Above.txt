<br>
After Helena META and I had our talk, I informed the Sakurans that I would accept their invitation to Ama no Tobira.<br>
After an entire day of preparation, Helena and I set off towards that mysterious place on the fifth day since our arrival.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Helena：</span><br>
What is this place we're heading to, Commander? A harbor?<br>
<br>
Our journey was a series of surprises from the very start.<br>
I'd thought we'd go to a mountain concealing some enormous underground facility, but instead we made a beeline for a harbor.<br>
Then, the Sakurans guided us away from the mainland.<br>
Helena and I began making guesses as to our route. That was when we noticed that the scenery outside the window had changed while we weren't looking.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Helena：</span><br>
Did we... just enter a Mirror Sea?<br>
It's so pretty. Like being inside a Sakuran picture scroll.<br>
A palace composed of archaic buildings silently stands on the sea's surface.<br>
<br>
It is divided by two arterial roads running from east to west and north to south, and is arranged into three distinct circular areas from the inside to the outside.<br>
Each area does not form a unified whole, but rather is subdivided into further areas of varying sizes due to the waterways running across it.<br>
Buildings radiating golden light dot the cityscape, following the layout rule of short on the outside and tall on the inside.<br>
Finally, at its centermost point stands an enormous tower that pierces through nature and the clouds.<br>
The files on the Sakura Empire that I read had a name for it – the Dragon Palace.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Tosa：</span><br>
Commander {playername}, Helena, you must go through the palace you see now to reach Ama no Tobira.<br>
However, this is as far as I can take you.<br>
The sluice leading further in has been opened. Once you enter, the ones appointed by the Venerable Three will escort you the rest of the way.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Helena：</span><br>
Huh? You're not coming with us?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Tosa：</span><br>
No. I haven't been permitted to enter the premises.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
This place is the Dragon Palace, isn't it?<br>
Sure sounds tightly managed for being just a waypoint on the way to Ama no Tobira.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Tosa：</span><br>
Right you are. It is the Dragon Palace.<br>
It didn't always take so long to enter it... until the Naraka incident happened, during which the Palace suffered extensive damage.<br>
Due to the importance of the ritual, certain unique environmental modifications were added when Yamato conducted emergency repairs.<br>
These turned the Dragon Palace into a genuine extension of Ama no Tobira, which, needless to say, necessitated stricter management.<br>
I know little more beyond that point. You will have to ask your guides.<br>
Now, go.<br>
<br>
And so, Helena and I boarded a command vessel and passed through the Dragon Palace's open sluice.<br>
The instant the sluice closes, our surroundings once again change dramatically.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Helena：</span><br>
Commander, we're... We're under the sea, somehow!<br>
<br>
Looking up, I see that the blue sky has turned into dim seawater.<br>
Countless fish are drawn to the light emitted by the city. They form schools and swim around the outside of the protective barrier.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
How? The files I read said it takes an hour and a half to reach its maximum depth...<br>
And it just happened in an instant.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Daisen：</span><br>
Heehee. I hope you aren't too frightened by this sudden change.<br>
I am Daisen, and this lady beside me is Shimanto. We shall be your guides.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Shimanto：</span><br>
Good to see you again, Commander {playername}.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
It's a pleasure, Daisen and Shimanto.<br>
I will say, I was anticipating seeing all sorts of unexpected things after entering Ama no Tobira...<br>
I just didn't expect to be already dazzled just while on the way there.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Daisen：</span><br>
Heheh. The Dragon Palace originally was reliant purely on its mechanical structure for diving and resurfacing, which took quite some time.<br>
The files you read were simply a little out of date.<br>
Now, following Yamato's modifications, the Dragon Palace cannot be considered a completely worldly thing anymore.<br>
As such, it's no wonder that it's capable of trivial things like diving and resurfacing in an instant.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Such fascinating technology. Could you tell me a little more?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Daisen：</span><br>
Why, of course. I shall do that after you ask your next question.<br>
You see, the explanation for it should be the same as the next thing you wish to ask.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
My next question? Well, you're right, because I do have another question.<br>
Since we're deep underwater, I assume Ama no Tobira is hidden somewhere down here, right?<br>
Are we gonna board a submarine and travel to it, or can the Dragon Palace go there on its own?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Shimanto：</span><br>
There's no need to bother with either of those things. The Dragon Palace has a doorway that connects directly to Ama no Tobira, so we just need to go through that.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
(A doorway?)<br>
(Does she mean like a portal into a Singularity? I didn't see any large structures from outside the Palace, though. Has the Sakura Empire managed to create miniaturized portals?)<br>
(Wait, no!)<br>
(From the Tower of Midgard and the Gate of Avalon, to the Winter's Crown, and even Naraka, all entrances to a Singularity have one thing in common – they're fixed in place.)<br>
(Have the Sakurans created an artificial Singularity that can be moved around?!)<br>
Shimanto, is this "doorway" the entrance to a Singularity?<br>
How did you manage to make a portal entryway that's both small and can be freely repositioned?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Shimanto：</span><br>
Umm... It's just a regular doorway!<br>
Ama no Tobira doesn't exist in the physical world. Only the doorway does.<br>
If you're wondering why the doorway was set up in this place, you'd have to ask Lady Yamato why she did that, because I don't know.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
(Sounds like she really has no idea.)<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Daisen：</span><br>
The doorway exists both here and elsewhere at the same time.<br>
Much like how the Palace exists both under the sea and on the surface.<br>
By extension, you will enter Ama no Tobira by going through the doorway, just as you went under the sea by passing through the sluice.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Wait, you're saying there are two Dragon palaces, and one exists above the water, and one under it? And they're connected by sluices that function as teleporters?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Daisen：</span><br>
No, there is but one Dragon Palace. Impossible feats such as this are made possible by it no longer being a worldly place.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
(Okay, this doesn't make any sense to me...)<br>
(Best to just drop the topic for now. I'll make a mental note to ask Helena META about it later.)<br>
Alright... I think I get the gist.<br>
What about before the modifications to the Palace? As far as I know, Ama no Tobira is older than it.<br>
How'd you get to Ama no Tobira in the past?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Daisen：</span><br>
In the past... it took much, much longer than it does now.<br>
Now, you can simply enter Ama no Tobira if you have an invitation. Back then, the only way to access it was through the Sacred Sakura's ground network.<br>
Entering it was beyond my abilities at the time.<br>
In fact, only ones like Shimanto who can freely travel through the Sacred Sakura would be able to enter it.<br>
Furthermore, the entrance was originally established here per Lady Yamato's orders to ensure the Rite of Resurrection went smoothly.<br>
Once the Rite was complete, Lady Yamato opted to keep it rather than have it removed.<br>
It's this decision that's allowed us the opportunity to see Ama no Tobira for ourselves.<br>
Ah, apologies. Listen to me, rambling on!<br>
This way, please, Commander and Helena.<br>
<br>
For a long time now, the Sakura Empire has had little contact with other factions, whilst being a place shrouded in mystery.<br>
Among said mysteries, those involving Yamato are all the more baffling.<br>
Beyond her name and the fact that she's a shipgirl, the higher-ups of the Azur Lane currently possess zero valuable knowledge on her.<br>
Even during the Naraka incident, which she played an instrumental role in, nobody actually saw her in person.<br>
"The Rite of Resurrection." A mere four words with an impact that cannot be overstated.<br>
A resurrection is not the same as a shipgirl being incapacitated in battle and brought back for repairs so she can return to the front line.<br>
Many Sakuran shipgirls suffered grave wounds in the Naraka incident. Some even had their bodies completely destroyed.<br>
Ordinarily, it would be impossible to make a recovery in such a case, even if the shipgirl received repairs... and yet, Yamato made the impossible happen.<br>
By literally resurrecting them solely relying on their "souls" – the sum of all the information that should be stored within their hulls, no less.<br>
Regardless of how she awakened them, the mere fact that she managed to preserve every bit of information that should've vanished in a blink is, by itself, immensely thought-provoking.<br>
Especially so after witnessing that brilliant glow the Rose Tower released in its final moments...<br>
Yamato is most likely up to something incredible – and I can't wait to see it.<br>
"Since the inception of my being"<br>
"A thought hath occupied my mind"<br>
"That the armor and the sword, whilst poignant..."<br>
"Cannot impede the plotting of the mind"<br>
"The evils beyond the realm all excel at this"<br>
"Thus, neither can I see nor sense it"<br>
"By the rocks, the realm is drawn"<br>
"By the realm, the source is forged"<br>
"The Sky Realm – it formeth a wall against the world beyond"<br>
"And thus is the domain within it defined – Amahara"<br>
"Even should the earth collapse and the mountains crumble, a great disaster is inevitable"<br>
"The Sky Realm of Amahara"<br>
"Forevermore must it last"<br>

<br>
After passing through the gate, the scenery changes in a flash.<br>
Much to our surprise, Helena and I walk in a sea of golden clouds.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Taekaze：</span><br>
Commander {playername}...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Minase：</span><br>
And Helena!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">I-404：</span><br>
Welcome to Ama no Tobira!<br>
<br>
Bang!<br>
Party poppers hidden within the clouds go off en masse. Confetti pours down like sparks, glittering and then vanishing without a trace.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">I-404：</span><br>
Commander {playername}, I'm I-404, and this is Taekaze and Minase. We'll be escorting you together.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Helena：</span><br>
Um, nice to meet you...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">I-404：</span><br>
Nice to meet you, too.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Taekaze：</span><br>
Let's be friends!<br>
<br>
This journey had left me on edge. The enthusiasm and energy with which they greet us soothes my tense nerves.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
You're the third group to escort us today. Is this some kind of relay race, just with hospitality instead of a baton?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">I-404：</span><br>
A hospitality relay race? Yeah, that sounds about right!<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Why are you doing it like this if Daisen and Shimanto are allowed inside Ama no Tobira as well?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">I-404：</span><br>
There are two reasons – one is that they still have repair work to do at the Dragon Palace.<br>
Another is that Ama no Tobira is preparing for a special ceremony that needs the environment to remain stable.<br>
And for that, the fewer people that come or go, the better.<br>
Also, this ceremony will be held for your sake, so that's something to look forward to.<br>
Oh, right, I'm curious...<br>
Do either of you have any thoughts on seeing this mystical place in person?<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
You bet I do.<br>
Truth be told, I did some reading on it before coming here.<br>
Judging by the mythological sound of its name, I thought this place would be closed off, dark, and a little oppressive.<br>
Or that maybe it'd be a collection of primitive stone buildings.<br>
Now that I'm here, though, it looks like a very spacious, bright place.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">I-404：</span><br>
Ahahaha! Yeah, I thought the same thing.<br>
But when you think about it, Lady Yamato wouldn't live in some dark, suffocating place, would she?<br>
You're right about it being closed off, for sure. As for your impression of it being spacious – well, you'll see later.<br>
What about you, Helena?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Helena：</span><br>
Like the Commander said, it feels bright and open. It's also got a soothing vibe that naturally makes you relax.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">I-404：</span><br>
Exactly! That soothing vibe is without a doubt authentic.<br>
There are numerous magic circles deployed all around inside Ama no Tobira, some of which have the effect of using positive emotions to stabilize the mind.<br>
Just being here soothes your mind, relieves stress, and lifts your mood.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
(Ahh. So this feeling of ease I'm getting is because of those magic circles Yamato put up.)<br>
("Stabilizing the mind with positive emotions." Interesting stuff.)<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">I-404：</span><br>
Man, thank gosh for Ama no Tobira! It makes me never want to go back.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
You mean you haven't always been here?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">I-404：</span><br>
No, silly. Taekaze, Minase, and I only came here after the Dragon Palace's doorway was fixed.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
I see. So it's gradually become more accessible ever since the Naraka incident, then?<br>
Actually, why'd you even come here?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">I-404：</span><br>
Heh. To complete the task given to us by the Venerable Three, duh.<br>
What task, you ask? Just like that special ritual, that's a secret for now.<br>
Anyway, come along, you two! Follow me!<br>
{{折叠面板|内容结束}}

{{折叠面板|标题=Ride the Clouds|选项=3|主框=1|样式=primary|展开=是}}
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">I-404：</span><br>
Anyway, come along, you two! Follow me!<br>
<br>
Atop the vast sea of clouds, I-404 gives us a quick nod and makes an "if you'd please" gesture with her hand.<br>
At the same time, a gust of wind blows, and the cloud at our feet gently begins moving forward like a magic carpet.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Helena：</span><br>
Whoa! Are we flying on a cloud?!<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Yeah. It's incredible.<br>
I've not done anything this fantastical since my trip into the Martyrium.<br>
The clouds formed a sea back then, too, and we sailed and fought on top of it.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Helena：</span><br>
Sailing and fighting on the clouds... You've done so many things on your own that I've never even heard about.<br>
And I wasn't able to help you then...<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
We've all got our own duties. I, Memphis, and even you.<br>
And look on the bright side – at least this time, we're riding the same cloud together.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Helena：</span><br>
You're right. I'll try!<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Yeah, you'll try – to enjoy our vacation.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Helena：</span><br>
Commandeeer!<br>
<br>
Our cloud gradually accelerates until it's going so fast that our surroundings start to blur.<br>
We go past one thing after another – mountains and islets floating in the sky, dense and large greenery, and pagodas of unclear purpose.<br>
After flying for a while, I-404's boredom finally becomes too much. She accelerates and jumps toward an adjacent cloud, which then starts gaining speed along with ours.<br>
Shortly thereafter, Minase and Taekaze join in on the fun, and they nimbly dash through the sky and each board a cloud of their own.<br>
I encourage Helena to do the same.<br>
She is shy at first, but eventually gets into it and has a good time.<br>
30 minutes of flying later, our group arrives with skipping and leaping energy at our destination.<br>
The clouds decelerate imperceptibly, and we go deep into some buildings equally imperceptibly.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Given our speed, we should've crashed right through those buildings. How'd we just slide through them?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">I-404：</span><br>
An astute observation from the Azur Lane's master strategist.<br>
Most people wouldn't notice even after staying here for a long time, while you caught on immediately.<br>
Ama no Tobira might at first look like an endless expanse, but it's actually divided up by barriers. It's a place made up of countless smaller spaces.<br>
If I had to use an analogy, I guess it's like... a 3D puzzle? Or maybe more like a pile of blocks.<br>
And the boundary between spaces is both clearly and vaguely defined.<br>
It's clear that the spaces are definitely distinct from each other. Kind of like small dreams that exist at once but are independent of each other.<br>
And the vagueness – it lies in the blurriness between spaces. It's like leaving and coming into a dream.<br>
That's why you don't notice how you got in, and it's why we won't ram into and smash any buildings.<br>
Same with the clouds. The ones we're riding now and the ones we rode before look identical, but they're actually different.<br>
Oh, look, we're here just on time. I'm such a good pilot!<br>
Commander {playername}, Helena, you'll get to dine soon. Let's head to the hall.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Wait, dine?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">I-404：</span><br>
Oops... Did I forget to mention that?<br>
Ahem, well, Ladies Yamato, Musashi, and Shinano are busy with that ritual, so Unzen will be treating you to some refreshments this evening.<br>
I'm guessing the three arranged it this way since they know you and Lady Unzen are acquainted.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Unzen? Who?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">I-404：</span><br>
The Great Sage!<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Oh!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Unzen：</span><br>
Did you find our cuisine satisfactory?<br>
The way here is rather jumbled. To pass through my barrier, you had to overcome the realm of possibility to arrive here.<br>
Or perhaps I should say... that this is fate?<br>
Are you wondering whether I'm the same as the other girls?<br>
You are, in many ways, a unique being.<br>
Can you feel it, too?<br>
Life is unpredictable. Sometimes, even an instant can last an eternity...<br>
How beautiful the moon is tonight.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
So that was her...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">I-404：</span><br>
Ahaha! Come on, this way, Commander!<br>
{{折叠面板|内容结束}}

{{折叠面板|标题=A Table in the Sea of Clouds|选项=4|主框=1|样式=primary|展开=是}}
<br>
I-404 leads the way and escorts us inside a pagoda.<br>
As she does so, Helena and I part ways. She goes to another banquet, and I head to the top floor of the building.<br>
Although the room across the paper door is dead silent, I can make out a few figures on the other side.<br>
<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项1：(Move the sliding door.)</span>'''''<br>
<br>
A wooden table in a deep color stands in the not-especially-large room.<br>
It soon becomes filled with plates lined with appetizers served cold in acknowledgement of my arrival.<br>
The view through the windows is sunny, with rolling clouds.<br>
A gentle breeze grazes a cherry tree branch, sending several petals scattering in its wake.<br>
Clean air blows in, and the cherry blossoms outside the window and the flower arrangements indoors dance with each other. It's as though a gust of flower petals rolls up into this small space.<br>
Amidst this gust, I take another look at the four people who are at the table with me.<br>
Two of them I'm already acquainted with.<br>
The Great Sage, Unzen, is one. We met just once several years ago. She helped from the background in the Naraka incident as well as the Day the Stars Faded.<br>
She sits opposite me and gives me a small nod.<br>
The other person is someone I met outside the Naraka Singularity and fought with both as an ally and as an enemy. The former string-puller of the Sakura Empire whom I vowed to travel with someday. Akagi.<br>
Having been removed from all her official positions to reflect on her mistakes in Ama no Tobira, it's both surprising yet perfectly expected to see her at the table.<br>
When I slid aside the door, her ears twitched ever so faintly. Although she didn't turn around to greet me, she instantly exuded an intense aura that compelled me to sit next to her.<br>
Besides those two, there's also a woman in black clothing with an elegant smile, and a girl dressed in white with a gaze oozing with curiosity directed at me.<br>
I wonder who they are.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Unzen：</span><br>
How quickly the days and months pass. I did not think we would meet again under these circumstances.<br>
I'm delighted to see you again, Commander {playername}.<br>
<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项1：Yeah, it's been a while, Great Sage.</span>'''''<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Unzen：</span><br>
Great Sage... That brings back memories.<br>
At the time, I had no name beyond "Great Sage," and you were still a student at the Academy.<br>
Now, I am Unzen, and you are a commander who's known around the world.<br>
Did you imagine a future such as this on that day?<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Nope. I wouldn't have predicted it in a million years.<br>
My future plans then were completely different from what they are now. I'm guessing yours were, too.<br>
Still, isn't it pretty good with how things turned out?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Unzen：</span><br>
Yes. I think it is.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Akagi：</span><br>
Ahem. Unzen, some might consider it rude to barrage the Commander with questions without even a social nicety.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Unzen：</span><br>
Oh, allow me to apologize for that. Commander, please make yourself at home.<br>
Allow me to introduce you to these ladies. This is Asama, and this is Hakuhou.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Asama：</span><br>
It's a pleasure to make your acquaintance, Commander of the Azur Lane. My name is Asama. I hope that we may be mutually cordial.<br>
<br>
The woman in black gives me an elegant bow of the head.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Hakuhou：</span><br>
I am Hakuhou. Greetings to you, Commander.<br>
<br>
The girl in white then gives me an introduction.<br>
Curiously, though, her gaze keeps flipping between Unzen and Akagi, suggesting that something's on her mind.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Unzen：</span><br>
Now that we are all introduced, let us eat.<br>
<br>
My amazement with Ama no Tobira grows as our meal begins.<br>
I hear an elegant performance, even though there's no player or instrument nearby.<br>
Food appears when I'm not looking, empty plates vanish tracelessly, and sake pours continuously from my cup no matter how much I drink.<br>
It's like it's all part of a beautiful dream.<br>
Later, during the meal...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Unzen：</span><br>
It was going to be Lady Musashi and Lady Shinano who would've joined you at the table on this occasion, given that Lady Yamato invited you...<br>
Unfortunately, as they are busy with the ritual, I was given a seat instead.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
I heard about the ritual thing from I-404 just earlier. Said it's got something to do with me.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Unzen：</span><br>
Yes, indeed it does.<br>
I take it you're well-acquainted with the idea of dreams on account of your closeness with Lady Shinano, correct?<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Kind of. I know a thing or two.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Unzen：</span><br>
Then, would you say that Ama no Tobira is a dream?<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Well, I thought a lot about it on the way here.<br>
A lot of the things I've seen since coming here have the characteristics of a typical dream.<br>
The only difference is, I'm clearly aware of it all.<br>
Even if this were a dream, I entered it on my own initiative, rather than ending up here during a deep sleep.<br>
So, to answer your question... I can't say definitively just yet.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Unzen：</span><br>
A place that is like a dream, but isn't.<br>
Why does it behave like that, you ask? Because this is not a physical world ruled by matter, but a heavenly world ruled by the mind. The "Sky Realm".<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Hm? The Sky Realm?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Unzen：</span><br>
Yes. What we call Ama no Tobira is no more than another doorway that Lady Yamato constructed.<br>
Once you step through Ama no Tobira, only then will you enter the Sky Realm of Amahara.<br>
Presently, Ladies Yamato, Musashi, and Shinano are all in Amahara. The ritual they are preparing is meant to expand the Sky Realm.<br>
Lady Yamato has poured years of blood and sweat into Amahara, and she hopes that you will participate in the expansion ceremony and experience this thing that she has put so much work into.<br>
She will then discuss future plans with you once that is done.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Sky Realm... Amahara?!<br>
<span style="color:#fef15e;">？？？?：</span><br>
You were drawn to Amahara, weren't you?<br>
Just leave... Don't come closer.<br>
Don't stay here, and don't enter Amahara...<br>
This place is no paradise... It's merely a grave. A grave made of lies and falsehoods!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Unzen：</span><br>
...Commander? Are you alright?<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
I'm fine. I just... Had a moment for a sec there.<br>
<br>
I shook my head and shook off the inexplicable chill I suddenly felt.<br>
Following that, Unzen and I spoke of various things. From the Sakura Empire, to her own story.<br>
Akagi behaved politely the whole way through, but a faint chill emanated from her constantly.<br>
Hakuhou and Asama, meanwhile, hardly added anything to the conversation, preferring to simply observe – observe me, especially.<br>
Whenever I asked Akagi something, her response was simply a silent refusal. It was like she was signaling that now was not the time.<br>
Finally, our meal came to an end.<br>
I reunited with Helena, and we got on a cloud with our hosts, and then set off to the boundary line of Ama no Tobira.<br>

<br>
Our cloud set forth once more.<br>
This time, the Sakurans didn't jump onto any other clouds, and as a result, our momentum wasn't nearly the same as it was before.<br>
Instead, the shipgirls and I rode the little cloud and flew quietly and steadily.<br>
That was, until I was suddenly hit with the sensation that we'd entered an open space.<br>
Despite the surroundings not changing much, I could sense it – we had gone into a space that was new.<br>
Once I became conscious of it, my surroundings took on a whole new look.<br>
The palaces that appear before us are far beyond everything we'd seen before, both in scale and majesty.<br>
They float on top of a veritable sea of clouds, as do the mountains, rivers, greenery, and trees.<br>
If one were to liken Ama no Tobira to a city above the clouds, then it'd be no exaggeration to say this is a fantasy land in the clouds.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Hakuhou：</span><br>
Commander {playername}, Helena, we have now arrived in the Sky Realm of Amahara.<br>
Oh? It seems that you already noticed this before I pointed it out, Commander.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Helena：</span><br>
This is the Sky Realm?<br>
I've not seen anything this wondrous even in my dreams...<br>
Wait, Hakuhou just implied you saw it before I did. Have you, Commander?<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
You need to be aware of it before you can see it. It's a typical trait of higher-dimensional spaces.<br>
Hakuhou pointed it out to make you see it as well.<br>
I simply noticed the transition into a new space before you did.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Helena：</span><br>
Ohh. So this place is different from Ama no Tobira, where we just were.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Yeah. It's a bigger space than Ama no Tobira. It's in a higher dimension, too.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Hakuhou：</span><br>
As expected, your perception is markedly keen.<br>
Ama no Tobira was always made to be the entrance to the Sky Realm. Although it was designed to be as spacious as could be, it's still no more than what its name suggests in our language – a door to heaven.<br>
The grand Sky Realm is different, however. It is a domain that floats above our earthly world.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Unzen：</span><br>
I might add that, although this place was beautiful when I first arrived, it was by no means as vast as what you behold now.<br>
It was developed piece by piece until it finally became worthy of its name.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Hakuhou：</span><br>
She is right. Moreover, the Sky Realm still holds further potential. Its size and splendor increase day after day.<br>
One might say that it quite literally experiences daily growth.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Wasn't always this way, huh... Did that change after the Naraka incident?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Hakuhou：</span><br>
Oh? How did you deduce that?<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
The Dragon Palace was modified after it happened. Ama no Tobira was closed for a long time before that.<br>
Wasn't your group called in to expand this place, I-404?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">I-404：</span><br>
No, we can't do that. We've mostly been going on patrols to minimize risks.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Then who's been expanding it?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Hakuhou：</span><br>
Would you care to guess?<br>
Ah, let's not make it too broad. Hmm... Let us limit it to the people around you.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
People around me, huh...<br>
Well, I can safely exclude myself, Helena, and those three. That leaves you, Unzen, Akagi, and Asama.<br>
(I've excluded everyone else, so it can only be the four people I sat down with.)<br>
(Then there's Akagi, who's been in a sour mood this whole time. Maybe that's because...)<br>
It's Unzen, Asama, and Hakuhou.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Akagi：</span><br>
......<br>
You're forgetting someone.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
No, I really think it's just those three.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Akagi：</span><br>
Commander, are you excluding me on purpose?<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
You've seemed a bit grumpy, so I just thought... You know.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Akagi：</span><br>
Please, I'm not grumpy because of you. Don't overthink things.<br>
<br>
Akagi gazes into the depths of the clouds, then neatly puts the topic to rest.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Hakuhou：</span><br>
Wow, you guessed it on your first try. Heehee. I'm starting to develop some respect for you, Commander.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Akagi：</span><br>
Hmph...<br>
{{折叠面板|内容结束}}

{{折叠面板|标题=Dream Stones|选项=6|主框=1|样式=primary|展开=是}}
<br>
Before I know it, our cloud has landed in a courtyard that smells of wine.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Hakuhou：</span><br>
Commander, kindly wait here for a while.<br>
We need to make just a few small preparations to carry out our daily task of expanding Amahara.<br>
Oumi. Oumi! The Commander has arrived. Is a Dream Stone ready for use?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Oumi：</span><br>
Ugh... That time already? Okay, wait just a moment.<br>
<br>
A while later, a girl wearing an elegant dress yet with a languid expression appears, riding a warship with a peculiar shape.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Is that... a bottle gourd?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Oumi：</span><br>
Indeed. I'm Oumi. It's an honor to meet you, Commander {playername}.<br>
Heehee – are you curious about my wine gourd?<br>
Then can I interest you in this fine Cloudsea Wine?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Hakuhou：</span><br>
Save the wine for later. More importantly, have you tuned a Dream Stone?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Oumi：</span><br>
Yes, yes, it's been successfully tuned. Everyone, if I may have your attention...<br>
<br>
Oumi flaps her sleeves, and an ash-grey stone the size of a billiard ball appears in the air.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Hakuhou：</span><br>
This is a Dream Stone, Commander. As its name suggests, it's the cornerstone that builds up the dreamlike Sky Realm.<br>
Since you could intuit the difference between the Sky Realm and Ama no Tobira, I suggest you closely examine the Stone. I think you'll sense something.<br>
<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项1：(Stare at the Dream Stone.)</span>'''''<br>
<br>
I stare intently at it, and before I know it, the grey ball turns into a transparent bubble.<br>
There are small clouds drifting inside the bubble, with even smaller buildings and mountains inside those clouds. It's like looking at a miniature of the Sky Realm.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Hakuhou：</span><br>
What you just saw is the essence of a Dream Stone.<br>
It is a precious thing – a higher dimension, compressed and purified, and modified into perfection.<br>
Whoever wields it can use their imagination to tap into its potential, and transform the space as though they're building a dream.<br>
This is the process with which we've rapidly expanded the Sky Realm.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Akagi：</span><br>
And what a bizarre new way to build it is.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
("New way to build"?)<br>
<br>
BZZZT...<br>
<span style="color:#ffc960;">Helena META：</span><br>
(It took a while to get us synchronized without anyone noticing, but now we have a stable two-way line.)<br>
(Where are you now, Commander? Is your reception over?)<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
(Yeah, it's done. I've  left Ama no Tobira and I'm now in Amahara.)<br>
(Yamato invited me to see what it's like to build in this place. She wants to discuss something important after that's done.)<br>
<span style="color:#ffc960;">Helena META：</span><br>
(Amahara, I see... I know that place. My world's Yamato worked pretty hard on it in secret.)<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
(Does this Amahara have anything to do with the one I heard mentioned in my nightmare?)<br>
<span style="color:#ffc960;">Helena META：</span><br>
(Still haven't forgotten that nightmare, huh? Well, don't worry. Test site beta's Amahara is, at its core, a cognitive defense system built by Yamato.)<br>
(Although it's deeply linked to the Amahara you dreamed of, it's a completely different kind of technology. For all intents and purposes, they just share a name.)<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
(Know anything about a Dream Stone? Is it related to the Watatsumi?)<br>
<span style="color:#ffc960;">Helena META：</span><br>
(Come again? Dream Stone? What's that?)<br>
<br>
I explain it as best as I can to Helena, based on what Hakuhou just told me.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
(Remember when Elizabeth META used Alsace and the concept of death to anchor space, and create the Martyrium? Doesn't it work the same as that?)<br>
<span style="color:#ffc960;">Helena META：</span><br>
(It does. Not just that, it's also a more advanced version of that.)<br>
(It not only utilizes concepts, but it even creates a set of concepts that belong specifically to Amahara.)<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
(A more advanced version? Is Yamato just that powerful?)<br>
<span style="color:#ffc960;">Helena META：</span><br>
(She's not supposed to be THIS powerful.)<br>
(When I did some research earlier, I found that Yamato didn't use this method to build Amahara.)<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
(Oh yeah, Akagi did just say that this is a NEW way to build.)<br>
(Considering Amahara didn't grow to this size until after the Naraka incident, it follows that the Dream Stones didn't come in use until after the incident as well.)<br>
<span style="color:#ffc960;">Helena META：</span><br>
(I think these "Dream Stones" could very well have something to do with the meteorite sample.)<br>
(I'll ask Jintsuu about it. Talk to you later.)<br>
<br>
Helena hangs up, and I, Hakuhou, and the rest start heading for the next stop on this trip to experience the Sky Realm's growth.<br>

<br>
The sea of clouds rolls, and we arrive in a new area.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Oumi：</span><br>
What do you see, {playername}?<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Nothing. Just clouds, clouds, and more clouds.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Oumi：</span><br>
Heehee. Why don't you take a closer look?<br>
<br>
Oumi presses the Dream Stone against her forehead.<br>
The Stone disappears like a popped bubble, and the scenery all around us changes in an instant.<br>
I'm inside a pagoda, sitting in front of a table. Past the balcony, I see an ocean of water that stretches on endlessly.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Oumi：</span><br>
What do you see now?<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
A castle, and an ocean... Did you use the Stone to make this?<br>
I thought the only sea you could make in this place was a sea of clouds.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Oumi：</span><br>
Heehee. Well, as you can tell, that's not all you can make.<br>
It only looked like a bunch of clouds because we were going somewhere.<br>
When moving from place to place in Amahara, of course you'll see nothing but clouds.<br>
Now, though, we're exploring all of its little nooks and crannies.<br>
And since we're exploring, there needs to be something new to see.<br>
Also, that's not strictly an ocean, but rather a lake.<br>
For various reasons, a single Dream Stone can only create so much space. What you see now is the upper limit.<br>
This place works a lot like a dream, you see. The bigger it gets, the more uncertain it gets, and the effort required to stabilize and explore it grows exponentially.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
So it's fluid similarly to how dreams are. Does it get affected by negative emotions?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Oumi：</span><br>
Don't worry about that. Negative emotions are suppressed thanks to the magic circles placed all around Amahara.<br>
You won't find any nightmarish monsters wreaking havoc in here.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
(That's good. Yamato planned ahead for that.)<br>
(The last thing I want is to see that fear I felt take shape again.)<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Unzen：</span><br>
Now, then, what do you all say to some Cloudsea Wine?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Hakuhou：</span><br>
That sounds superb. Pour some for me.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Oumi：</span><br>
Just a moment! Let me get it ready for you.<br>
<br>
Oumi lightly strikes her gourd, and liquid starts pouring out of it in a helical shape, filling the cups on the table to the brim.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Hakuhou：</span><br>
Lady Yamato created this Cloudsea Wine to help visitors to the Sky Realm better adapt to its environment.<br>
Those who drink it are formally acknowledged as guests here, and they receive the blessing of the Amahara Taijin – the Great Ring of Amahara.<br>
You will also receive an additional boon shortly after drinking the Wine itself.<br>
Whether traveling, working, or using a Dream Stone to create space in Amahara, you'll find that it's much easier than usual.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
(Can it really do that?)<br>
<span style="color:#ffc960;">Helena META：</span><br>
(It's just a registration and tuning process.)<br>
<br>
Once more, I hear Helena META's voice through our secret line of communication.<br>
<span style="color:#ffc960;">Helena META：</span><br>
(It's another classic example of presentation in Sakuran technology.)<br>
(Amahara's administrator made drinking Cloudsea Wine into a registration and authentication process.)<br>
(They need you to register an account first before you can expand Amahara's space – in other words, to edit or add to it.)<br>
(As for the part about better adapting to the environment, that's a form of tuning.)<br>
(It doesn't need to be a particular drink for it to work. What matters is that it's wine, and the aforementioned act of drinking itself. It's strictly symbolic.)<br>
(If I were the admin, I think I'd make it soda instead.)<br>
(The principle behind this part is pretty complicated, so I'll spare you the details. You understand the idea behind this better after I explained it, right?)<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
(Yeah. I understand it now, thanks to your layman's translation. By the way, did you finish looking into the Dream Stones?)<br>
<span style="color:#ffc960;">Helena META：</span><br>
(Not yet. I just came back to check on you since you were on my mind.)<br>
(Based on my preliminary findings, this does seem like an advanced use of the Watatsumi.)<br>
(There's a degree of risk in the technology itself, which rises and falls depending on the creator's skill.)<br>
(When you get a Dream Stone, don't use it immediately. I want to analyze it first.)<br>
(I'm really curious as to how Yamato got her hands on this technology...)<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Hakuhou：</span><br>
Is something the matter, Commander? If you have any questions, don't be afraid to ask. I hope to answer them all.<br>
<span style="color:#ffc960;">Helena META：</span><br>
(Oh, right. Our times are fully synchronized now.)<br>
(To other people, it looks like you've just been staring into space this whole time, so...)<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Ahem... No, it's nothing. I just got lost in the beauty of this view.<br>
Without further ado, let's drink.<br>
<br>
Unhesitatingly, I drink all the wine in my cup.<br>
It has a refreshing sweetness to it, with a distinct floral and fruity aroma.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
It has a refreshing sweetness to it, with a distinct floral and fruity aroma.<br>
(...What?)<br>
<br>
For a moment, I get a strange sense of déjà vu – like this isn't my first time drinking this wine.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
(That's so weird. Didn't Helena say this wine is just a symbolic thing?)<br>
(Then why does this space... suddenly look clearer than it did a moment ago?)<br>
(And why did I suddenly get that feeling like I've done this before?)<br>
{{折叠面板|内容结束}}

{{折叠面板|标题=Weaving Dreams|选项=8|主框=1|样式=primary|展开=是}}
<br>
After we drink the Cloudsea Wine, Oumi and I-404's group say goodbye, and they return to their respective posts.<br>
Helena and I follow Unzen, and we go to another open place in the Cloudsea.<br>
I suppose they have something else they want to show me before I go and create some space with my own hands.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Asama：</span><br>
Now, allow me to present an example.<br>
<br>
Asama presses the Dream Stone against her forehead.<br>
The Stone disappears like a popped bubble, and the scenery all around us changes in an instant.<br>
I find myself in a decayed place. It's dark, and everything is in ruins.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Asama：</span><br>
The Dream Stones create dreams that are a reflection of what's in your mind.<br>
If the dreamer cannot vividly picture the scene they desire, and all they have is a vague idea, the Dream Stone will create a space such as this.<br>
Moreover, if their thoughts are too negative, or if they succumb to panic and fear...<br>
Then the Amahara Taijin's suppressive and filtering effects will intervene, resulting in the Dream Stone fabricating a shapeless, chaotic space much like this.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
(That's smart. Prevents out-of-control emotions from creating something terrifying.)<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Unzen：</span><br>
There are two ways of dealing with orderless spaces of this nature.<br>
The first is to borrow the power of the magic circles deployed around Amahara to thoroughly erase the space.<br>
This method is quite convenient, though it is akin to using a sledgehammer to crack a nut.<br>
For this reason, there exists a second method – disassembling the space to use it as material for another dream.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Akagi：</span><br>
The Commander must be getting bored with all this explaining.<br>
As they say, show, don't tell. Allow me.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Unzen：</span><br>
By all means.<br>
<br>
Akagi turns to face a certain direction in the chaotic space.<br>
She takes one step forward, and the world changes in response.<br>
I'm walking through a field of red spider lilies in full bloom. The sun is setting on the horizon, dyeing the sky an orangish red color.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Is this... the world inside your mind?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Akagi：</span><br>
It's simply what I'm thinking about at the moment.<br>
How do you like it?<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
It's beautiful. Like a painting, with this sea of flowers stretching to the horizon.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Akagi：</span><br>
I'm glad to hear that. I planted a real one, too. Kaga is looking after it.<br>
When we get the chance, perhaps we can admire it together...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Unzen：</span><br>
Commander {playername}, please direct your attention to me.<br>
<br>
Unzen chooses a different direction.<br>
She steadies her breathing, then draws her sword with force.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Unzen：</span><br>
Take my mind's image... and let it manifest!<br>
<br>
Clear rivers, a bright blue sky, vivid greenery, and cherry-pink crystals.<br>
It's a dreamlike view unlike anything in reality or the Cloudsea.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Unzen：</span><br>
This is the landscape the Prime Sakura presides over in its calm state.<br>
I've spent a long, long time in that place...<br>
Although you cannot enter this landscape in reality, the Dream Stones allow me to introduce you to it in this fashion.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Hakuhou：</span><br>
Now comes my turn to create.<br>
<br>
Hakuhou steps into what little remains of the chaotic space.<br>
She kneels down and touches the earth with her fingers.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Hakuhou：</span><br>
O white phoenix, soar across the world in my stead.<br>
<br>
The Cloudsea surges forth, and from it rises a phoenix of white to dance lightly with its long tail.<br>
I can even hear its clear cry resounding in my ears.<br>
The chaos has all disappeared, replaced by three differing landscapes that come together into a single world.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Helena：</span><br>
I can't believe my eyes...<br>
It's beautiful. So beautiful that I don't know how else to describe it.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Yeah. I didn't expect such magical things to be possible here.<br>
It's like watching gods weave a world together.<br>
<span style="color:#ffc960;">Helena META：</span><br>
(Heh. It's fine for her to be moved – but you? Why are you moved?)<br>
(So what if they showed you some slightly pretty landscapes? Don't let it make you biased.)<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
(This is more than just "slightly" pretty.)<br>
<span style="color:#ffc960;">Helena META：</span><br>
(No, it isn't.)<br>
(The Tower can do the same thing, only much better. Why not come see it sometime? It'll be fun.)<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
(Doing something "fun" with the Tower? Can't say I'm not interested.)<br>
<span style="color:#ffc960;">Helena META：</span><br>
(It's a promise, then.)<br>
(Hey, remember to keep your emotions in check. Try to stay calm, okay?)<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
(I'm calm, I'm calm...)<br>
<span style="color:#ffc960;">Helena META：</span><br>
(Nicely done. Now, back to work for me.)<br>
{{折叠面板|内容结束}}

<br>
After leaving behind the trisected world, we arrive in an empty Cloudsea.<br>
Now, it's time for me to try it.<br>
I take a Dream Stone in hand and press it softly against my forehead.<br>
In a blink, the world is transformed.<br>
I'm aboard a ship that's gently rocking in a calm sea. The sun's rays are gentle, and the breeze is pleasant.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
(I saw something for a moment there... What was that?)<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Helena：</span><br>
Ah, you created an ocean!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Hakuhou：</span><br>
As there is a limit on how much space a Dream Stone can create, it would be more apt to call it a slice of an ocean.<br>
At any rate, it suits someone with as deep a connection to the sea, Commander.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Wasn't actually expecting it to be a calm sea... At least it's not a mountain of paperwork.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Akagi：</span><br>
Pardon – paperwork?<br>
It seems the Orthodoxy's meeting venue has left as much of an impression on you as the battlefield has.<br>
What did your mind picture before you touched the Stone? Surely it wasn't just the sea.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
You're right. What I envisioned was "peace."<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Unzen：</span><br>
Peace...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Asama：</span><br>
Peace, you say...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Akagi：</span><br>
......<br>
Even after we achieve peace, will you still spend every day at sea?<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
You know, honestly, even I'm not sure. That's why I was curious to see what the Stone would make of "peace."<br>
As it turns out, peace is a blue sea.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Hakuhou：</span><br>
The Dream Stones are fascinating things. They can create beautiful landscapes even out of abstract concepts.<br>
If only you could diversify your thinking, and formulate something untethered by the laws of physics or the constraints of reality...<br>
Then the Dream Stone could show you something more surprising.<br>
Commander {playername}, would you like to give it another try?<br>

<br>
I'm given another Dream Stone.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
(Diversify my thinking, eh...)<br>
(Let's see if I can mix it up a bit...)<br>
<br>
I gently press the Dream Stone against my forehead.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">？？？?：</span><br>
In a blink, the world is transformed.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
(Huh?!)<br>
(What the hell?! That definitely wasn't my imagination!)<br>
(It was that black figure again!)<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Hakuhou：</span><br>
What's this? An archipelago in the Pacific Ocean?<br>
What kind of space did you envision this time as you touched the Dream Stone?<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
A big, Sakuran place.<br>
What can I say? It's where we're vacationing, and I tried to expand my thinking a bit, like you said.<br>
Did I do something wrong?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Hakuhou：</span><br>
This space seems... too big.<br>
Unzen, can you sense it?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Unzen：</span><br>
I'm... unable to measure its width or depth.<br>
This is not a slice of an ocean. It is veritably a whole ocean.<br>
With dozens of islands poking above the water.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Hakuhou：</span><br>
Wouldn't that make it... many times larger than the combined size of the entire Sky Realm?<br>
That's simply unbelievable... All this, from but one Dream Stone?<br>
A Dream Stone contains a limited amount of information. How did a single one manage to create a space this big?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Unzen：</span><br>
I do not know. However, the boundaries of this space seem to be unstable.<br>
It is constantly changing out of our sight. I can sense it.<br>
What's more, the changes happen increasingly faster the further away they are.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
(What? The world outside our view is changing without my input?)<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Akagi：</span><br>
Then what are we standing around for? We need to get out of here immediately.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Hakuhou：</span><br>
Everyone, please stay where you are. I will get us out of here now.<br>
<br>
The clouds flow away, and our surroundings change entirely. Despite this, we're still in the vast ocean.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Hakuhou：</span><br>
That's odd... We're still in here.<br>
Oumi, we have an emergency. I need you to...<br>
......<br>
Unzen, we have lost contact with the outside!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Unzen：</span><br>
Please, calm down.<br>
Kindly hold on a moment. I will see if I can sense something.<br>
<br>
Unzen closes her eyes, and light shines forth from her body, then scatters in all directions.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
(This is getting a bit dire, let's say that.)<br>
(Helena, do you read me?)<br>
(Hello? Helena?)<br>
<span style="color:#ffc960;">Helena META：</span><br>
(Don't worry. I'm here.)<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
(Thank god. I thought I lost contact with you, too.)<br>
<span style="color:#ffc960;">Helena META：</span><br>
(In truth, you did – for a brief moment.)<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
(So whatever just happened also affected you, then?)<br>
<span style="color:#ffc960;">Helena META：</span><br>
(More precisely, there was a drastic change in the rules of that space.)<br>
(I could at least tell that you were still in the Sky Realm since your coordinate field didn't update.)<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
(Wait, a drastic change of rules?)<br>
<span style="color:#ffc960;">Helena META：</span><br>
(Look at the sun. It's setting. Time has begun ticking.)<br>
<br>
Just as Helena says, the previously blue sky has all of a sudden taken on a golden orange color.<br>
The girls realize this at the same time as I do.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Hakuhou：</span><br>
This is wrong. This is wrong for so many reasons.<br>
The space created by the Dream Stone behaves unnaturally, and most unnatural of all is the one thing that should never change in here – the time.<br>
Commander, did you... change the very essence of your Dream Stone?<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
No, I just put it against my forehead. I didn't do anything unusual.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Hakuhou：</span><br>
Right, of course you didn't... You can't just change the essence of the Dream Stone like that, after all.<br>
If one did that, it would no longer be a Dream Stone. The Amahara Taijin would identify it as a foreign object and suppress it.<br>
But then, what happened?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Unzen：</span><br>
I've deduced the cause.<br>
The space itself has become unstable. That's why we can't escape through regular means or contact the outside.<br>
I've regained contact with the Amahara Taijin. Please stay put and do not move.<br>
There – I've established a stable passage. Follow me, and I will lead you out!<br>

<br>
The shipgirls and I experience faint vibrations for a while, then we return to the golden Cloudsea once more.<br>
This place is so tranquil that it's like the danger we were just in wasn't real to begin with.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Hakuhou：</span><br>
Phew...<br>
Commander, I just employed the Amahara Taijin to erase the space we were just in.<br>
This only happened because the ladies and I were unprepared.<br>
On all our behalves, I deeply apologize for the discomfort caused.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
It was weird, for sure, but it didn't necessarily happen because you were unprepared...<br>
(There was that black figure... I only saw her while using the Dream Stone.)<br>
All's well that ends well. We all made it out unscathed, so don't sweat it.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Asama：</span><br>
Your forgiveness is deeply appreciated.<br>
Hakuhou, I suggest that we suspend the use of Dream Stones for the time being.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Akagi：</span><br>
Not just that, we should not even think of using them until we've figured out what the problem was.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Asama：</span><br>
A wise proposal. Let us do as you say.<br>
Furthermore, Hakuhou, you ought to tell others that all expansion work involving the Stones is suspended.<br>
I shall inform Lady Yamato of this incident at a later time.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Hakuhou：</span><br>
As you say, Asama...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Akagi：</span><br>
One thing's for sure: Our plans for today's visit have fallen apart. Mind if I come up with something new?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Asama：</span><br>
Let's hear it.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Akagi：</span><br>
Well, the landscapes of the Five Provinces and Seven Districts are now 40% complete.<br>
Since the Commander is with us, why don't we go and enjoy some superb views, hmm?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Asama：</span><br>
That sounds like a good idea. Do you have any particular spots in mind?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Akagi：</span><br>
How about Kouzuke Province?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Asama：</span><br>
We have the same idea. Yes, let us go to Kouzuke Province.<br>
<br>
The up-to-now cold and distant Akagi has finally livened up, and jovially begins talking with the other girls about the sightseeing we're about to do.<br>
I, on the other hand, feel restless.<br>
My mind is still preoccupied with the black figure I saw when I touched the Dream Stone, as well as that odd nightmare I had a few days ago.<br>
And that bizarre thing that just happened to us – did we really escape, and that's all there's to it?<br>
The next moment, dark clouds cover the sky.<br>
Just like that, the hereto fantastically beautiful Sky Realm is shrouded in unyielding darkness.<br>

<br>
Meanwhile, in the court of Amahara Castle...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Musashi：</span><br>
Ladies, an emergency has arisen. Formless corruption has invaded the Sky Realm en masse.<br>
I know neither whence they came nor how they slipped past the external walls. However, I know one thing...<br>
That their rampage shan't be allowed to continue.<br>
I have already deployed defensive magic circles across the Sky Realm. Izumo?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Izumo：</span><br>
Yes, ma'am?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Musashi：</span><br>
I will head out and destroy the source of this formless corruption. The defense of the castle, I entrust to you.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Izumo：</span><br>
Understood, ma'am.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Musashi：</span><br>
Azuma, Kitakaze, you are to lead our forces across the Five Provinces and Seven Districts and eliminate the enemy.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Azuma & Kitakaze：</span><br>
- As you wish.  - Roger!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Musashi：</span><br>
Ikazuchi, Inazuma, summon Shimanto and Daisen hither. Inform them that war has come to Amahara.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ikazuchi：</span><br>
Understood, ma'am.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Inazuma：</span><br>
We'll see to it.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Musashi：</span><br>
Ibuki, head to the Amahara Cloudsea and crush the enemy, then accompany the aforementioned two to Ama no Tobira to maintain it.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ibuki：</span><br>
As you've bidden, so shall it be done!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Musashi：</span><br>
Lastly, I-404.<br>
Unzen's group is bringing the Commander to Amahara Castle. In the name of utmost safety, take your forces and rendezvous with them.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">I-404：</span><br>
Copy that! Don't worry, Musashi – I'll bring the Commander back safely if it's the last thing I do!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Musashi：</span><br>
As long as each of you carries out your duty, our victory is assured.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Everyone：</span><br>
Yes, ma'am!<br>

<span style="color:#c3abff;">Jintsuu META：</span><br>
...The importance of cognitive defense was realized in the wake of the Spectral Moon incident.<br>
The Sky Realm of Amahara, as a project, was devised for that very purpose.<br>
I didn't expect it to end like it did...<br>
<br>
A group was having a casual conversation within a garden surrounded by stars.<br>
That was until their chat was disrupted by a flashing, red word appearing in the air – WARNING.<br>
<span style="color:#c3abff;">Jintsuu META：</span><br>
Why are there alarms going off even here? Did something happen?<br>
<span style="color:#ffc960;">Helena META：</span><br>
Yeah.<br>
Helena's gone into battle. Something's gone seriously wrong in the Sky Realm.<br>
<span style="color:#c3abff;">Memphis META：</span><br>
Helena, has the Commander gotten into trouble?! That warning in the sky sure suggests it!<br>
<span style="color:#ffc960;">Helena META：</span><br>
Perfect timing, Memphis. Tell Vestal and Arizona to get ready for dispatch.<br>
<span style="color:#c3abff;">Memphis META：</span><br>
What? I mean, okay!<br>
<span style="color:#c3abff;">Jintsuu META：</span><br>
Are you sure we shouldn't depart immediately?<br>
<span style="color:#ffc960;">Helena META：</span><br>
It's fine. The situation isn't that bad.<br>
Still, I'm preparing for it to get worse. There's too much new stuff today, and I don't like it.<br>
<span style="color:#c3abff;">Jintsuu META：</span><br>
I understand. A lot of first-time things for you today.<br>
While I haven't seen these "Dream Stones" before, this series of events today does invoke a sense of déjà vu in me.<br>
I have no evidence for this, but I feel like Amahara went into a different direction as soon as the stones appeared.<br>
<span style="color:#ffc960;">Helena META：</span><br>
What do you mean by "a different direction"?<br>
<span style="color:#c3abff;">Jintsuu META：</span><br>
Perhaps it's more apt to say that it has gone off-course.<br>
What is clear is that someone unrelated has become involved in Amahara's growth.<br>
Moreover, this person... surely knows about what happened in the past.<br>
<span style="color:#ffc960;">Helena META：</span><br>
I see...<br>
Keep monitoring, Jintsuu. Let me know if you discover anything.<br>
I'm gonna go make some adjustments to Rodney.<br>
I will get to the bottom of who's plotting in the shadows here.<br>

<span style="color:#fef15e;">？？？?：</span><br>
You mustn't go into Amahara...<br>
It's a grave. A grave made of lies and falsehoods...<br>
A prison that is completely sealed...<br>
None can escape it...<br>
<br>
"None can escape it."<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Hakuhou：</span><br>
...Asama! Unzen!<br>
There is an alert from the Amahara Taijin! Invaders have appeared in the Sky Realm!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Asama：</span><br>
Invaders?<br>
How is it possible that they snuck through the Amahara Taijin?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Akagi：</span><br>
We'll have to figure that out another time! This place is dangerous. We need to return to Amahara Castle at once.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Unzen：</span><br>
It's the corruption...<br>
It is already here...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Hakuhou：</span><br>
What?! Here?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Akagi：</span><br>
Tsk... Then we'll intercept! Don't let the enemy come close!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Helena：</span><br>
I'll deploy a mass-produced ship at once. Commander, get on.<br>
...Commander?<br>
<br>
"None can escape it."<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Helena：</span><br>
...Commander! Are you okay?<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
I'm...<br>
I'm fine. Getting on now.<br>
<br>
<br>
KABOOOM!<br>
Fragments of nightmares, formless corruption, corrosion entities... They may look different, but they're the same at their core.<br>
The Cloudsea is as black as the night. It takes all our might to carve out a path through the black waves.<br>
They aren't much of a threat beyond having numbers on their side.<br>
Those numbers are precisely the issue, however.<br>
We dispose of one after another, but however many we destroy, they always regroup in unseen nooks and attack us again.<br>
"Like a fear that grows in the dark."<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Hakuhou：</span><br>
Unzen, is this the corruption you spoke of? This horde is endless, and we cannot hope to defeat all of them ourselves.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Unzen：</span><br>
The ones we've defeated are but shadows. They will assail us endlessly until their source is removed.<br>
Please focus not on slaying them, but on clearing a path instead. We must reach Amahara Castle as soon as possible.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Hakuhou：</span><br>
Understood!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Akagi：</span><br>
Be careful. Something even bigger is coming.<br>
<span style="color:#bdbdbd;">???：</span><br>
▂▃▆▂▃▆▇▂▃▇█▆▆▇▇▆▇<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Asama：</span><br>
Is that... a black dragon?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Unzen：</span><br>
It bodes ill that such a wicked creature comes so soon...<br>
We must fall back! This enemy is not like the rest. I shall cut it down!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">I-404：</span><br>
Unzen! Minase, Taekaze, and I are here!<br>
We'll take it from here! Take Commander {playername} and go to Amahara Castle!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Unzen：</span><br>
Command your seadrake to strangle this vile enemy.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">I-404：</span><br>
Hmph. Got it!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Unzen：</span><br>
Alright, the rest of us need to keep moving.<br>
<br>
<span style="color:#bdbdbd;">???：</span><br>
▂▃▆▂▃▆▇▂▃▇█▆▆▇▇▆▇<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Minase：</span><br>
This dragon isn't like the formless corruption we've seen so far...<br>
How do I describe it? It's like it's more solid, more agile.<br>
It's almost like it has a will of its own.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Taekaze：</span><br>
You can tell it's strong just from looking at it. Can we really handle it by ourselves?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">I-404：</span><br>
Heh! Sure we can! Kotama and I are pretty strong, too!<br>
We've just been stuck doing repair work lately, and haven't had a chance to flaunt our true strength!<br>
You two, put pressure on it from the sides. I'll take care of the rest!<br>
Kotama, it's time to dance! May its body be pierced into a bottomless abyss!<br>

<br>
Thanks to I-404's group covering us, we managed to cover a lot of ground in a short time.<br>
With Unzen constantly looking for shortcuts amidst the chaos, we finally broke through the dark tide and made it to the heart of the Sky Realm – Amahara Castle.<br>
However, the safety we expected to find wasn't there.<br>
The castle has been breached despite the many magic circles around it, with many of its buildings having been stained and turned black.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Hakuhou：</span><br>
They've breached Amahara Castle's perimeter!<br>
How is that possible?! The foes we fought en route weren't especially mighty, so they shouldn't have been able to penetrate the defenses regardless of how numerous they were!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Asama：</span><br>
Amahara has fallen... What a horrific sight...<br>
<br>
KABOOOM!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Izumo：</span><br>
There you are, Unzen. Come this way.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Unzen：</span><br>
Izumo, what in the world is happening?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Izumo：</span><br>
Somehow, the enemy slipped past the barrier and made it inside the castle. They caught us off guard.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Unzen：</span><br>
Pardon? They even slipped past the castle's barrier?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Izumo：</span><br>
Yeah... So we fortified our defenses, and concentrated our forces and magic circles around the third main palace, where the Venerable Three are.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Hakuhou：</span><br>
It's been this long, and the Venerable Three still have yet to resolve the situation?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Izumo：</span><br>
The situation's not so straightforward.<br>
They've already erased the source of the corruption twice, but both times, another source sprang up.<br>
It's suspected the problem lies in the Depths.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Unzen：</span><br>
The Depths... Is there such a place within the Sky Realm?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Akagi：</span><br>
The Dream Stones. They're collected from the Depths, no?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Unzen：</span><br>
The Dream Stones...<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
(Sounds like the Sakurans are in a bit of a stalemate.)<br>
(I knew the formless corruption's appearance was only the beginning. Of course things wouldn't be so simple...)<br>
(Helena, have you figured out the cause yet?)<br>
<span style="color:#ffc960;">Helena META：</span><br>
(Still working on it. There are so many things I can't explain with this attack.)<br>
(They're right about one thing, though – that the source is in the Depths.)<br>
(Don't be alarmed. A rescue team is standing by. If things get completely out of control, we'll jump in and pull at least you and Helena out of there.)<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
(Try to save them, too, if you can.)<br>
<span style="color:#ffc960;">Helena META：</span><br>
(We'll try.)<br>
<br>
Sometime later, Izumo escorts me and the other Sakurans to a part of the castle that was still intact.<br>
Although the black tide bangs on the barrier outside, this is as far as they can get.<br>
So, I relax a bit and decide to restore my strength for the battle of attrition that's sure to come.<br>
I gaze at the cloud that hangs at the castle's peak like the sun.<br>
As my mind wanders, it feels like I'm looking at an even bigger space.<br>
In a black void, a woman in colorful clothing stares at several picture scrolls unfolded before her eyes.<br>
The one end of the scrolls hovers beside her hand, while the other stretches on endlessly into the distance.<br>
<span style="color:#bdbdbd;">Houshou META：</span><br>
I've found it...<br>
That is where the calamity's source lies...<br>
<br>
Her eyes fixate on one of the scrolls – and so do the countless other gazes amidst the nothingness.<br>
<span style="color:#bdbdbd;">Houshou META：</span><br>
Phase shift...<br>
<br>
The scroll then moves as she lifts it not with her hand, but with her eyes.<br>
<span style="color:#bdbdbd;">Houshou META：</span><br>
Now you will be safe...<br>
<br>
With one flick of her gaze, the danger has passed.<br>
Butterflies in three colors flutter between the scrolls while light gradually fills the void.<br>
I stand on a cloud and look up at the sun-like cloud hanging over the castle's peak.<br>
Golden light flows forth, making Amahara Castle look unscathed again.<br>
It's as though that ruthless battle never happened in the first place.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Helena：</span><br>
What? Everything's suddenly... back to normal.<br>
Commander, what's going on?<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Well, I mean–<br>
Yooouuu...<br>
Teeelll...<br>
Meee...?<br>
<br>
My voice becomes slowed and stretched, and my vision becomes fragmented and distorted.<br>
The world instantly dissolves, and an endless void envelops it.<br>

<br>
Bathed in golden light, Amahara Castle appeared unscathed.<br>
However, two people who ought to be there were missing.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Hakuhou：</span><br>
Asama, Unzen... Where are Helena and the Commander?<br>
I blinked for but a moment, and now they've vanished.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Akagi：</span><br>
What is the meaning of this?! Where have they gone?!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Unzen：</span><br>
I cannot sense them, but do not worry. It's possible they've–<br>
<br>
KABOOOM!<br>
A blue torrent tore the golden sky apart, immediately followed by protective magic circles manifesting one after the next.<br>
One moment later, all sorts of floating battleships appeared in the sky above Amahara Castle.<br>
<span style="color:#ffc960;">Helena META：</span><br>
Would someone care to explain what happened to the Commander?<br>
<br>
Another blue torrent appeared and reduced several floating islands to rubble before barely being blocked by several swords made of purple light.<br>

<span style="color:#fef15e;">？？？?：</span><br>
Well? It's not like you imagined, is it?<br>
Amahara isn't just a place of beauty. Darkness and fear lurk under the surface.<br>
Think about it carefully. What does the fear in the depths of your heart look like?<br>
The things you want to avoid, to run from, to forget...<br>
Sooner or later, they will all catch up with you.<br>
The Sky Realm of Amahara is a prison.<br>
Even we, its own creators, are under lock and key inside it.<br>
<br>
It's silent. It's dark.<br>
It's vast. It's endless.<br>
Time and direction seem to have lost all meaning.<br>
My consciousness tears apart, melts, and forms countless, thin branches that scatter through this void that stretches on forever.<br>
At the ends of every little branch, I see it – the end.<br>
Strengthless soldiers, burning tanks, sunken battleships, crumbled towers.<br>
Tsunamis, earthquakes, illusory light, volcanoes, meteors, miasmic mist.<br>
A black storm ravaging the land, a great wall of silver that connects sea and sky...<br>
The branches link with each other, weaving together the entire world.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
The end of the world...<br>
Yes, that's it...<br>
Even if I forget it, I am who I am... and this fear is part of me.<br>
It's always been there, spreading and growing unseen inside of me...<br>
Then, when nobody expected it, it silently came...<br>
<br>
The scenery before me becomes more and more vivid. My consciousness begins to merge with this calamity.<br>
"Welcome to the Sky Realm of Amahara."<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Helena：</span><br>
What is this place?<br>
Commander? Where are you?<br>

"The Sky Realm of Amahara harbors infinite potential."<br>
"What we want to create isn't just a mental protective barrier..."<br>
"And certainly not merely a spiritual utopia."<br>
"We need to go a step beyond that."<br>
"Preservation of one's personality. Awakening of the consciousness. Immortality of the soul."<br>
"Humanity will set forth on a journey."<br>
"And this is our hope for the future."<br>
"Welcome to the Sky Realm of Amahara."<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Helena：</span><br>
...Commander, I finally found you!<br>
It's me, Commander. Can you hear me?<br>
Commander!<br>
<br>
The branches of my consciousness return all at once. My mind gradually becomes clear again.<br>
<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项1：Helena?</span>'''''<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Helena：</span><br>
Yes, it's me! It's Helena!<br>
I called to you several times, and you didn't respond. I thought you'd...<br>
<br>
The tone in her voice suggests that she's almost on the verge of tears.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Don't worry about me, I'm fine. Why are you here as well, though?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Helena：</span><br>
I don't know... Where even are we? What is happening?<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
We're...<br>
<br>
The simulacrum of the end has frozen in time at an unknown moment.<br>
Now, Helena and I are trapped in a battlefield, a veritable sea of flames.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Helena：</span><br>
It happened again! The whole world changed in an instant!<br>
<br>
As explosions and tongues of flame tear through the dark night, I can see my surroundings more clearly.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
I remember this battlefield...<br>
Isn't it... the Long Island Defense Line?<br>
{{折叠面板|内容结束}}

{{折叠面板|标题=The Long Island Defense Line, Again|选项=19|主框=1|样式=primary|展开=是}}
<br>
Location unknown<br>
Long Island Defense Line(?)<br>
Blaring sirens that whip at my eardrums. The acrid stench of rising smoke. Incandescent plumes of fire.<br>
The Long Island Defense Line has fallen, just as I remember it.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Dr. Anzeel：</span><br>
We were crushed terribly in our last-ditch counterattack, so this place will fall soon.<br>
Our defenses are still holding for now, but that cannot last much longer.<br>
They will come again with even greater numbers and raze this place to the ground, just as was planned.<br>
Hey! What are you doing, staring off into space by yourself over there? The battle isn't over yet, so you can't be wandering around outside!<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
The others will come back and save you.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Dr. Anzeel：</span><br>
Hm? Surely not. If they're following the plan, there's no way they'd be able to leave.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
They'll come back... I'm sure of it...<br>
So...<br>
Let's run away, together.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Helena：</span><br>
What?<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Helena, do you think what we're seeing now is reality or an illusion?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Helena：</span><br>
An illusion... probably.<br>
Look at the factions fighting in this place. It's like there's a mist covering them up.<br>
I can't see them clearly, no matter how hard I strain my eyes.<br>
<br>
Just as she says, everything here looks hazy and vague, like they're shrouded in mist.<br>
The sea, the land, our allies, our foes – everything. I can only perceive them as "something."<br>
I know what's happening, but the instant I try to identify anything – who our allies are, what equipment they have, what the enemy is, how many there are – the fog cuts it all off.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Either this place is constructed from insufficient information, or it's beyond my understanding. Whatever the case, this is an illusion.<br>
But – even facsimiles contain a kernel of truth.<br>
The Defense Line hasn't fallen yet, and Anzeel is still here.<br>
Come with me, Helena. We're gonna look for Anzeel!<br>

<br>
Location unknown<br>
Long Island Defense Line(?)<br>
Helena and I push on through the Long Island Defense Line as shots fly all around us.<br>
Although the mist obfuscates all detail, it does indicate when something is there, so I can intuitively see which places are safe and which aren't.<br>
This allows us to advance without a hitch.<br>
Helena and I proceed into an underground passage.<br>
Like before, whenever we run into a fork in the road, I can tell which path leads to the command center and which doesn't, and I can also tell which doors we can open and which we can't.<br>
Our progress is as smooth as can be, owing to this blessing in disguise.<br>
We finally enter the bunker and stop at the entrance to the command center.<br>
<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项1：(Open the door.)</span>'''''<br>
<br>
With a deep breath, I slowly push open the door.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Dr. Anzeel：</span><br>
Huh?<br>
<br>
There's strangely no mist in the spacious hall. Everything is as clear as day.<br>
Dr. Anzeel stands in front of a giant command console. She turns to us with a look of surprise.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Dr. Anzeel：</span><br>
Helena... Why are you back?<br>
And my assistant, too... I don't...<br>
This isn't right. If anyone was going to come, it'd be Enterprise... not you, Helena. And you, assistant, shouldn't be the one leading her here.<br>
This wasn't in my plans, and it makes no sense... That can only mean this isn't real.<br>
Fascinating...<br>
The main ship – Amahara – hasn't even disembarked yet, but somehow, the changes in the astronomical environment that's caused by the guiding bunker's activation have already breached its protective barrier...<br>
Hahah... This is that thing, you know? When you notice one strange thing, there's bound to be 100 more.<br>
And then there's the way I look – I look like a girl in her 20s, for god's sake.<br>
Pretty safe to assume this is some kind of dream, then, right?<br>
Wonder what kind of dream. My last dream in the moments before I die? Or is it your dream, assistant? Or maybe... Did you create it, Helena?<br>
<br>
Anzeel is extremely sharp this time around.<br>
She grasped the situation in just a few seconds, and even got to the question at the heart of this whole thing.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Helena：</span><br>
You must be Dr. Anzeel. Nice to meet you. Um, I didn't create this place. The Commander and I just ended up here for some reason.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Dr. Anzeel：</span><br>
Ohh. You're not THE Helena, but you ARE Helena, that's for sure.<br>
Then the Magister Plan was a success... and a glimmer of hope remains at Dusk.<br>
<br>
Anzeel's expression suddenly brightens.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Dr. Anzeel：</span><br>
This can't be a dream in my dying moments... which leaves but one explanation. Assistant, this is your dream.<br>
You don't look like you know what's going on, though, do you?<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
It's a long story...<br>
<br>
I briefly explain to her what's happened in the Sky Realm of Amahara since we entered it.<br>
I omit many things, but she clearly understands the picture I'm painting for her.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Dr. Anzeel：</span><br>
Hmm. So you theorize that this is a world born from fear. Yeah, that's certainly feasible in Amahara.<br>
If it's the same Amahara I know, maybe the tunneling phenomenon has occurred?<br>
One thing's for sure – this is fascinating. If only Ryouko were here to research it.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
We're in the middle of a crisis, so I don't think we have time to do any research.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Dr. Anzeel：</span><br>
The pursuit of knowledge never ends as long as you live, you know. Besides–<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">System Announcer：</span><br>
Warning! Warning! Outer defense line is under attack. Communication lost with outposts 37, 38, and 39.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Dr. Anzeel：</span><br>
...Well, seems we'll have to end our conversation here.<br>
Assistant, Helena, go somewhere else that's safe.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Aren't you coming with?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Dr. Anzeel：</span><br>
This is YOUR dream, assistant. I'm sure you'll find an exit on your own.<br>
I, on the other hand... I'm staying here.<br>
This place is like an inverse Pandora's box. It traps everything inside, letting only hope out.<br>
And to ensure that hope makes it out, I'm going to stay here and carry out my final mission.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
No.<br>
You said it a minute ago – this is a dream, not reality. There's no need for you to stay and fulfill your mission.<br>
Hope left the box, but some of it also remained.<br>
I will not leave you behind.<br>
To the best of my knowledge, Aoste's evacuation plan only includes Sirens and shipgirls, doesn't it?<br>
Then there must still be people fighting for their lives somewhere.<br>
Even if the apocalypse is inevitable, I don't think people will just sit and wait for it to come.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Dr. Anzeel：</span><br>
You're right. We still have EVA, ARK, and SUIHUO. But...<br>
<br>
Anzeel suddenly falls quiet, blinks, and seems to ponder something.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Dr. Anzeel：</span><br>
Do you really want to save me?<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Of course I do.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Dr. Anzeel：</span><br>
Then we'll go to EVA. That doomsday bunker is in the Rocky Mountains – should be the closest one from here.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
In the Rockies? Okay. Are we going there by car? By plane?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Dr. Anzeel：</span><br>
What do you think? We'll go by the underground canals.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Come again? There are canals all the way from the Defense Line to the Rockies?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Dr. Anzeel：</span><br>
Well, yeah. It's the project you insisted on, remember?<br>
At the time, regional teleporters had just been introduced – to the benefit of the war situation everywhere. And yet, you asserted that we needed an underground canal network.<br>
Hell, we both worked our asses off to make Project Undercurrent come through. I don't think anyone could've imagined we'd use it one day.<br>
Did you... predict this would happen?<br>
You really are a giant mystery, assistant. I was right about you all along.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">System Announcer：</span><br>
Warning! Warning! Enemy has breached the Central Defense Line. Communication lost with outposts 147, 148, and 149.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Dr. Anzeel：</span><br>
We can't stay here much longer. Come with me – I'll take you to the canals.<br>

<br>
Helena and I follow Anzeel and leave the command center behind.<br>
There is not a single trace of mist on the way. Everything I lay eyes on is crystal clear.<br>
As a result, I've lost the ability to automatically open every door I come across.<br>
Luckily, though, Anzeel helps us move forward without any problems.<br>
After passing through several doors, we ride a capsule-shaped elevator down deeper underground.<br>
As soon as the elevator doors open, a vast underground canal network unfolds before me. There are Antiochus transport ships on standby.<br>
We board the vessel, after which the armored door begins to slowly close.<br>
Amid the roar of the engines and the sound of the waves, we can finally breathe easy.<br>
Anzeel engages the autopilot on the transport ship, puts on some coffee, and stares intently at a map of the canal network.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
(This is an excellent chance to gain information. I should talk to her.)<br>
<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项1：(Ask about the three doomsday bunkers.)</span>'''''<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Dr. Anzeel：</span><br>
More precisely, there are six of them all in all.<br>
Each one belongs to a different project as well.<br>
That said, once we decided to commit ourselves to the Magister Plan, all other projects were put on the backburner.<br>
It became our top priority project, and we poured more than 90% of all our resources into it.<br>
However, due to the gradual paralysis of global logistics, every continent was left with resources they couldn't dedicate to the Magister Plan. Some more, some less.<br>
So, due to a multitude of circumstances, the other doomsday bunkers weren't completely thrown to the wayside.<br>
Among the six bunkers, two were converted into guiding strongholds for the Final Magistration, and another one was a fortress for the mind that was launched into synchronous orbit. It was called "Amahara."<br>
That leaves us with three. EVA, the one we're heading to, is in the Rockies, and it's where the remaining forces of the north and south of the New World are concentrated. It's also where Colette is.<br>
Then there's ARK, located in the Alps, which serves as the base of Project Seed. It's run by Eutopia, and Maria might be there, too.<br>
Finally, SUIHUO, situated in the Himalayas. It also serves as Project Flint, the first project to be activated, and it's the biggest in scope.<br>
It's not really a single bunker – it'd be more accurate to call it a bunker complex. Dr. Li has always been in command over there.<br>
That reminds me... Stephen Jr.'s fleet was blocked en route to ARK, and apparently they changed course and went to that one instead. Don't know the deets, sadly.<br>
<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项1：(Ask about Dr. Aoste's Magister Plan.)</span>'''''<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Dr. Anzeel：</span><br>
He's the one who came up with it, but I wouldn't strictly call it just HIS project anymore.<br>
It would become the judgment that we would collectively administrate.<br>
It would judge our future. It would judge the future of Antiochus and the shipgirls. And, it would judge the future of all worlds that would become test sites.<br>
But... it is also the last judgment we could make.<br>
Otherwise, the light of human civilization would be snuffed out, and there would be no "futures" to speak of.<br>
<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项1：(Ask about the Auroral City.)</span>'''''<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Dr. Anzeel：</span><br>
Ah, the Auroral City... I haven't heard that name in a long time.<br>
Well, now, it's been divided into two guiding bunkers – the Gate of Dawn, and the Gate of Judgment.<br>
One is in the South Pole, and the other's in the North Pole. Together, they make up a device that can manipulate the planet's magnetic field.<br>
Solar activity is currently at its peak, so by fine-tuning the two guiding bunkers, we've created the optimal astronomical conditions for the execution of the "Final Magistration".<br>
The Gate of Dawn – in the South Pole – is led and defended by Admiral Mikhail and half of the Council's Task Force and the Northern Parliament's fleet.<br>
As for the Gate of Judgment in the North Pole, that's where the Antiochus System's mainframe, the Natural Calculation System, and Laplace's Demon have all been moved.<br>
Also, since the Final Magistration is beginning soon, Aoste is leading the other half of the Council's Task Force and Antiochus' main fleet to defend that place.<br>
Shipgirls from across the world and Antiochus patrols have been continuously gathering there as well.<br>
<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项1：(Ask about the final evacuation plan.)</span>'''''<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Dr. Anzeel：</span><br>
Final evacuation plan? In regard to the Final Magistration, I assume?<br>
Well... Ostensibly, it's a massive offensive.<br>
The shipgirls will group up with Antiochus' main force, use Laplace's Demon to advance into a higher dimension, and completely annihilate X.<br>
We've been on a losing streak, and this is a Hail Mary of an operation we've been forced into. The risk is immense, but imagine the reward...<br>
At least, that's what people believe it is.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
It's to make sure panic doesn't break out.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Dr. Anzeel：</span><br>
A white lie emphasizing just one part of the truth.<br>
If the Magister Plan does succeed, it'll be one hell of an offensive.<br>
But, even if we do win, the fruits of victory will not be for us to claim.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Does Enterprise know the truth? Do any of the shipgirls?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Dr. Anzeel：</span><br>
Part of it, yeah. Like the fact that, once they leave, they're never coming back.<br>
Though, they don't know that the Final Magistration is about to start, or that Aoste and I are evacuating.<br>
Humanity cannot outwit Laplace's Demon... We should've all taken that to heart a long time ago.<br>
But those girls – they're convinced that we members of the Council are special. Everyone thinks we are.<br>
You know – "They're with the Council! They'll find some way to evacuate us, I just know it!"<br>
So we managed to fool them by spreading the Council's members across the globe.<br>
The truth is, there aren't any special people. Not a single...<br>
...No, maybe there is.<br>
You. You might be truly special.<br>
Because you managed to truly escape!<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Wasn't my escape a part of the plan you all devised?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Dr. Anzeel：</span><br>
I... don't remember that.<br>
Weird... It's not like me to forget something like this.<br>
Right, didn't you say something about "forgetting a lot of things?"<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
"A lot" is putting it lightly. I lost almost all my memories.<br>
I forgot more than I even know. Like the shipgirls that managed to evacuate, and most things about Antiochus.<br>
It feels like I was split into a million pieces, and I'm now merely the biggest piece among them all.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Dr. Anzeel：</span><br>
You don't remember...<br>
Not remembering – that might be the key to this project.<br>
It's just a hunch, but...<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Did you figure something out?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Dr. Anzeel：</span><br>
Sorry, assistant, but I think I should tell you as little as possible about the things you don't know about.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Now even YOU'RE giving me this treatment... Here I thought I'd get this rare opportunity to ask you so many things.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Dr. Anzeel：</span><br>
Even I? Who else has been "giving you this treatment?"<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Helena. The very same one who escaped from here.<br>
She seems like she knows so much, but never tells me more than I need to know, and won't say more than that.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Dr. Anzeel：</span><br>
Helena...<br>
Sounds like she's been pushing herself harder than she should ever since the Lexington Fleet incident...<br>
You saved her once in the past, but now, she's the one guiding you...<br>
I can't help you any more than I already have, assistant. Please, just don't do anything crazy.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">System Announcer：</span><br>
We will shortly arrive at your destination. Please check to make sure you have all your belongings with you before you disembark the ship.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Dr. Anzeel：</span><br>
We're here already? That was way too fast...<br>
Let's go out and have a look.<br>
{{折叠面板|内容结束}}

<br>
When we disembark, we are greeted not by the underground canal, but by the sea.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Dr. Anzeel：</span><br>
...This is NY Harbor.<br>
Even in a dream, I just can't seem to get away from this place.<br>
<br>
She's clearly disheartened for a moment, but she promptly cheers up.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Dr. Anzeel：</span><br>
I'm destined to be here, so of course I can't leave. You're different, though.<br>
I'll stay here – you take a ship to EVA.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
......<br>
Maybe this is nothing more than a dream after all.<br>
I may be trapped in here, but there are people on the outside working to rescue me as we speak.<br>
I happen to have faith in them, which means there's no need for ME to try and find a way out. I just need to buy time.<br>
And if that's all I need to do, then what does it matter where I do it?<br>
I won't be going to EVA.<br>
Let's defend NY Harbor for as long as we can together.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Dr. Anzeel：</span><br>
...Well, alright. NY Harbor it is!<br>
<br>
After our arrival, Anzeel commandeers an unmanned military vehicle and drives us to Urban Defense Headquarters.<br>
Throughout the car's slow advance, the hazy city gradually takes shape.<br>
Some of the buildings still have their lights on, but it feels strikingly empty here. Desolate.<br>
The most common sight here is robots on group patrols. Sometimes, cars pass by.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Dr. Anzeel：</span><br>
They're all soldiers who fell back from the Long Island Defense Line. Some are staying here in NY City, and the rest will leave for EVA.<br>
<br>
This city's streets are otherwise deserted. Only when we pass by skyscrapers do we see signs of civilian life inside.<br>
They seem to be working on something alongside the city police force.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Dr. Anzeel：</span><br>
To be honest with you, NY Harbor and the Long Island Defense Line were both bait. There were never going to be any civilians here.<br>
But some civilians just refuse to evacuate to EVA.<br>
Some of them don't want to move. Some of them just don't want to give up their home to the enemy that easily.<br>
I respect their decisions.<br>
<br>
As the car passes through a park, I spy a familiar building.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Is that... the university?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Dr. Anzeel：</span><br>
We can go wherever and do whatever. We're the masters of our own destinies! For today, anyway.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Hornet II：</span><br>
Aw hell yeah! Way to go, Doc!<br>
Although I think some sort of plan would be good to have. Where are we going, exactly?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Dr. Anzeel：</span><br>
Let me think... Oh, hey, it's almost lunchtime! I know a good café Aoste told me about years ago.<br>
I dunno if they're still around, but if they are, we'll grab something to eat!<br>
After that, we could do some window shopping, then go to the movie theater.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Langley II：</span><br>
So the plan is to wing it as usual? Fantastic... Oh well, it's at least worth it to check out the café.<br>
Could you tell me the name of it? I'll look them up and see if they're still open.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Dr. Anzeel：</span><br>
Sure. It's called "Granate."<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Langley II：</span><br>
Spelled like pomegranate, right? I think I see it.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
I wonder how Granate is doing right now.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Dr. Anzeel：</span><br>
Whoa! You still remember that place?<br>
I guess I'm not surprised. Their food was amazing.<br>
Sadly, they closed up a few years back. We couldn't go if we wanted.<br>
<br>
Beyond that is a commercial district.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Hornet II：</span><br>
Wait, first, let's take a group selfie! Northampton, you do the honor with your drone.<br>
Make sure you get all of us, Bonnie included, in the frame.<br>
Y'know, she'd probably be livid if she learned we went on a date with the Professor without her...<br>
But if her face is in the picture, you can at least say she was there in spirit, right?<br>
How does that sound, Professor? Over here, you can stand in the middle. Hammann, Langley, scoot over a bit. Yorktown, you can stand right beside the Professor.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Northampton II：</span><br>
And I'll be riiight here. Everyone ready? Say "cheese" on three. One, two...<br>
<br>
I walked here with Yorktown once upon a time.<br>
It's just a neon-lit shadow of its former self now.<br>
Finally, after passing through several military checkpoints, we reach Urban Defense HQ.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Dr. Anzeel：</span><br>
This is where we'll be setting up shop.<br>
Let's go take command, you two.<br>
Can't wait to see what scraps are left for us.<br>
{{折叠面板|内容结束}}

<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Dr. Anzeel：</span><br>
There's basically nothing here!<br>
<br>
Anzeel grimaces at the information we find in the command center.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Dr. Anzeel：</span><br>
One Type-I Antiochus fleet, four standard Urban Defense drone fleets...<br>
Half of the Council's combined fleet post Long Island withdrawal, under 2,000 city guards...<br>
That's a drop in a bucket in a place as big as this.<br>
If we focused all of our forces on the Long Island Defense Line, we could protect the city for one more day, tops.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
...We'll just have to use space to buy time.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Dr. Anzeel：</span><br>
Yup. That's our only option with defenses as slim as they are. We'll have to gradually give up more than 90% of the city.<br>
The defense system is still functioning, though, and we have enough ammo to last us.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Are there any nearby fleets that can support us?<br>
Even if this city is considered bait, bait works better the longer it distracts the enemy.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Dr. Anzeel：</span><br>
Unfortunately, they're all gone. Union forces all moved to EVA.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
What about Council forces?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Dr. Anzeel：</span><br>
Nada. The last three fleets in the area have all been moved to Long Island.<br>
In short, we need to make do with what we have on hand.<br>
Fortunately, Helena is here. You can't underestimate shipgirls, even if there's only one.<br>
<span style="color:#c3abff;">Akagi META：</span><br>
I may be able to procure support from the outside.<br>
<br>
Suddenly, a familiar figure appears out of thin air.<br>
<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项1：Akagi?!</span>'''''<br>
<span style="color:#c3abff;">Akagi META：</span><br>
Greetings, familiar stranger.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
What?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Dr. Anzeel：</span><br>
She's from "here," assistant.<br>
Why are you here, Akagi?<br>
<span style="color:#c3abff;">Akagi META：</span><br>
The Sky Realm administrative terminal found an abnormality here, so I came to look.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
(This Akagi isn't a physical being, but a projection?)<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Dr. Anzeel：</span><br>
Wow, so even the Sky Realm of Amahara is trapped in this dream? Fascinating.<br>
What do you all think?<br>
<span style="color:#c3abff;">Akagi META：</span><br>
It is fascinating. Unusual, moreover.<br>
We understand the situation, and what's more, we've come up with a solution.<br>
Familiar stranger, this dream is yours. Who do you think is most likely to be here at this time?<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Hmm... I came here from Amahara, so the others who were there at the time might have tagged along.<br>
Akagi, Unzen, Hakuhou, Asama, and I-404's group.<br>
The META Helena, too. She's noticed that something is wrong and is trying to locate me right now.<br>
I wouldn't be surprised to see her, along with the META Memphis and Vestal.<br>
<span style="color:#c3abff;">Akagi META：</span><br>
Understood. I will return to Amahara and devise a plan with the administrative terminal.<br>
Before I go, there is one thing I must ask...<br>
If everyone in a dream awakens, yet the dream continues independent of them... can you still call it a dream?<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
It continues independent of them...<br>
<span style="color:#c3abff;">Akagi META：</span><br>
Heehee. Take all the time you need to think about it.<br>
If we meet again, you may tell me your answer then.<br>
<br>
Akagi vanishes. Anzeel, Helena, and I all look at each other in astonishment.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Dr. Anzeel：</span><br>
They must have realized something was wrong in this dream and immediately fingered you as the cause.<br>
That's the fortress of the mind for you – formidable even in the dream world.<br>
<br>
KABOOOM!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Dr. Anzeel：</span><br>
Well, it sounds like they broke through the Long Island Defense Line. Gear up for battle!<br>
{{折叠面板|内容结束}}

{{折叠面板|标题=Imprisoned|选项=24|主框=1|样式=primary|展开=是}}
<br>
As more enemies flood in from the Long Island Defense Line, flames of war intensify near NY Harbor.<br>
Artillery, missiles, lasers, electromagnetic weapons... There are even weapons of war that I can't comprehend.<br>
The city's defense system operates at full power, throwing everything at the inscrutable enemy I know to be X. But right now, they appear only as misty, writhing shadows.<br>
I refuse to send Helena into battle. Anzeel pretends not to see, her silence speaking volumes.<br>
I'm sure she thinks I just want her back at HQ to cover my ass.<br>
However, the Helena from my world line is not as powerful as the one Anzeel is familiar with. This battlefield is not one she is ready for.<br>
I simply did not want Anzeel to misjudge our combat capabilities and deploy our forces incorrectly as a result.<br>
Several hours pass. Despite the defense system's firepower, the X continue to encroach on the coast.<br>
All throughout the city, strong winds start to whip up and grow in intensity.<br>
<span style="color:#c3abff;">Akagi META：</span><br>
Pardon my repeated intrusion.<br>
<br>
As the situation continues to worsen, she appears again.<br>
<span style="color:#c3abff;">Akagi META：</span><br>
Tell me, familiar stranger, have you felt anything... special, as of late?<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Special? Uh... Not really.<br>
<span style="color:#c3abff;">Akagi META：</span><br>
The girls pursuing you aren't far now.<br>
There's just some repulsive force at work, keeping them from finding just the right frequency.<br>
The Sky Realm Administrative Terminal tried to correct this problem, but it failed.<br>
This problem must be beyond what forces it can work within a dream.<br>
<br>
For some reason, she keeps looking in Anzeel's direction.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Dr. Anzeel：</span><br>
......<br>
What does Ryouko think of all this?<br>
<span style="color:#c3abff;">Akagi META：</span><br>
She thinks it's a mental prison.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Dr. Anzeel：</span><br>
......<br>
I see.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
What's going on here?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Dr. Anzeel：</span><br>
...Sorry.<br>
Just like before, we couldn't make it to EVA... because of me.<br>
*sigh*...<br>
<br>
She heaves a sigh of apparent... relief?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Dr. Anzeel：</span><br>
Thank you, assistant. For giving me this fleeting dream.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Anzeel... You're not making any sense.<br>
<br>
Only then do I realize that the pistol usually slung around her waist... is firmly within her grasp.<br>
<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项1：...What are you about to do?!</span>'''''<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项2：STOP!!</span>'''''<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Dr. Anzeel：</span><br>
Take care, my friends. I wish you the best.<br>
<br>
BANG!<br>
She collapses into a pool of blood.<br>
What just happened?<br>
What just happened?!<br>
WHAT JUST HAPPENED?!<br>
How can this be?<br>
How can this be?!<br>
HOW CAN THIS BE?!<br>
Prison<br>
Prison<br>
P R I S O N<br>
<span style="color:#bdbdbd;">Akagi META：</span><br>
{playername}！<br>
Stay calm, please.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
*pant*... *pant*...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Helena：</span><br>
Commander?! What's gotten into you?<br>
<br>
In the command room, Helena rushes over to me anxiously.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
(Helena? It's just... Helena?)<br>
<br>
Something is wrong.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
What happened to Akagi and Anzeel?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Helena：</span><br>
Akagi... and Anzeel?<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
They were just here. I mean, Anzeel has been with us the whole time. You don't... remember?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Helena：</span><br>
Hmm? It's just been the two of us in here.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Helena... Did I position the defenses of NY Harbor?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Helena：</span><br>
Yeah. After our retreat from the Long Island Defense Line, you brought me here to NY City.<br>
You said we needed to deploy defenses here to buy time, and that reinforcements would come soon.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
...I get it.<br>
I get it...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Communicator：</span><br>
BEEP BEEP!<br>
<span style="color:#ffc960;">Helena META：</span><br>
(Found you.)<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
(Helena?!)<br>
<span style="color:#ffc960;">Helena META：</span><br>
(Sorry. This took longer than I thought it would.)<br>
(Don't move a muscle. Reinforcements are coming.)<br>

<br>
Less than a minute after Anzeel's disappearance, Memphis META led a fleet into the battlefield.<br>
NY Harbor would be safe, for now.<br>
Shortly after...<br>
<span style="color:#c3abff;">Memphis META：</span><br>
Commander, are you okay?!<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
I'm just fine. You couldn't have come at a better time.<br>
<span style="color:#c3abff;">Vestal META：</span><br>
Thank goodness... We were so worried.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Unzen：</span><br>
I'm so sorry. We never could have dreamed...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Akagi：</span><br>
Hmph. I knew there was something fishy about this sudden technological breakthrough.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
I know your invitation was well-intentioned.<br>
I seem to be the reason that everything went wrong. If anything, I owe you an apology for getting Amahara tangled up in this mess.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Hakuhou：</span><br>
You mustn't blame yourself!<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Then, that goes for all of you as well. None of you have anything to apologize for.<br>
Honestly, I've heard the word "sorry" more than enough times for one day.<br>
......<br>
And besides, we should be focusing on what to do next.<br>
Memphis, has Helena said anything?<br>
When can we go home?<br>
<span style="color:#c3abff;">Memphis META：</span><br>
Helena is working with the Yamato-class girls and Houshou to construct a stable evac route as soon as possible.<br>
What we need to do is hold out.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
...Did you say Houshou?<br>
<span style="color:#c3abff;">Memphis META：</span><br>
Yeah! Trust me, I was just as surprised!<br>
EVERYONE was shocked when she appeared. I mean, she just popped up out of nowhere!<br>
Either way, we got the Dream Stone from her.<br>
Helena was pissed. If she knew Houshou was involved, she wouldn't have let you come until she got to the bottom of everything.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Well, nobody knew, so there's no point in regret.<br>
Nobody is omniscient. Even the best-laid plans can be overturned by the unexpected.<br>
Only by accepting the unexpected can we use it to our advantage.<br>
For example...<br>
I had plans just a while ago, but our shortage of firepower made them impossible to carry out.<br>
But now? That's not so much of a problem.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Asama：</span><br>
Commander {playername}, the Sakuran fleet awaits your orders.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Great. I'd like to deploy defenses in the following areas...<br>
{{折叠面板|内容结束}}

{{折叠面板|标题=Defensive Area A|选项=26|主框=1|样式=primary|展开=是}}
<br>
Location unknown<br>
NY City(?) - Coastal Waters(?)<br>
Defensive Area A(?)<br>
Following a strategy briefing, the Sakuran fleet split into two – one led by Asama, and one led by Unzen – and each headed to a different defensive area.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Hakuhou：</span><br>
Asama, have you noticed the same thing as I?<br>
The bustling cityscape and the defensive installations that just supported us, I mean.<br>
They all seemed exceptionally advanced and outlandish. Why is the Commander dreaming of these things, I wonder?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Asama：</span><br>
As I'm sure you've noticed, much of this dream is rather hazy and vague.<br>
It's as though they're shrouded by mist. It's plausible that {playername}, too, knows not why this dream appears the way it does.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Hakuhou：</span><br>
I see. It's fortunate that this space is in some ways similar to Amahara.<br>
It doesn't impair my combat abilities – in fact, I feel somewhat empowered compared to normal.<br>
This is all to say, I should be able to compensate for others' difficulties later when it comes to a battle with the nightmares.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">I-404：</span><br>
Heh! You're not the only one! Kotama's aching to take down a horde of monsters!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Oumi：</span><br>
How wonderful that you're all so motivated. Why don't we bolster our spirits with a dash of Cloudsea Wine, hm?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Asama：</span><br>
Having wine before a battle sounds ill-advised.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Oumi：</span><br>
Why be so strict with yourself? Have we not been blitzing through the enemy's vanguard since our very arrival here?<br>
Besides, who knows when the next group will show up?<br>
Exchanging cups sounds to me like a much better use of our time than idly standing around.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Hakuhou：</span><br>
If you were to drink Cloudsea Wine, would you also gain its benefits even in this place?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Oumi：</span><br>
Who knows? Whether it grants its benefits or not, it still tastes superb.<br>
Fine wine is just the thing that would enrich this fantastical dream journey.<br>
Although, it's a shame the moon will not show itself... For want of its presence, the atmosphere is lacking.<br>
Well, I'll have the honor of the first drink, then. Cheers!<br>

NY City(?) - Coastal Waters(?)<br>
Defensive Area B(?)<br>
Memphis' unit passed through a desolate district of the city before arriving at their defensive area.<br>
<span style="color:#c3abff;">Vestal META：</span><br>
Has anyone else noticed how the Commander seems to be feeling awful?<br>
<span style="color:#c3abff;">Memphis META：</span><br>
So I'm not the only one who felt that. I've never seen the Commander like this before.<br>
Something bad must've happened before we got here.<br>
<span style="color:#c3abff;">Vestal META：</span><br>
A case of witnessing an event that opened up old scars, perhaps?<br>
<span style="color:#c3abff;">Jintsuu META：</span><br>
Such a thing may get under our skin, but the Commander hardly remembers anything, no?<br>
<span style="color:#c3abff;">Memphis META：</span><br>
There was that time when Helena used the Sea of Stars to run a simulation of NY City. The Commander participated in that.<br>
<span style="color:#c3abff;">Jintsuu META：</span><br>
I was deployed on a mission when that occurred.<br>
I can hardly believe you succeeded in something so dangerous.<br>
In fact, I must ask – how DID you achieve it?<br>
Constructing a simulacrum of test site alpha is no easy task, even for Antiochus.<br>
The enormous quantity of missing data, the highly advanced technology, the absurdly powerful adversaries... It's dangerous and hard to control in the extreme.<br>
Even if you are successful in simulating it, it holds almost no meaning.<br>
One may be able to replicate the places, but not the people. It would be a hollow shell of a city, much like this place.<br>
<span style="color:#c3abff;">Memphis META：</span><br>
Yeah, but... we had the Tower. That's how we did it.<br>
<span style="color:#c3abff;">Vestal META：</span><br>
We created a special world slice based on records, then created the people, then employed a unique method to grant intelligence to the people who were important.<br>
<span style="color:#c3abff;">Jintsuu META：</span><br>
...Absurd. That's what it was.<br>
<span style="color:#c3abff;">Memphis META：</span><br>
You're right. Looking back on it, it was a bit absurd.<br>
But if the chance really presented itself to you, would you not take it?<br>
Would you not want to see it one more time? Those bustling streets, the people we've lost...<br>
Ow... My head...<br>
<span style="color:#c3abff;">Kasumi META：</span><br>
Take it easy, Memphis.<br>
No more thinking. It's bad for your mental stability.<br>
<span style="color:#c3abff;">Memphis META：</span><br>
Ugh... Thanks.<br>
Okay, I won't dwell on it.<br>
Let's stay focused. We've found the Commander, so things are gonna get better from here on!<br>

<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Daisen：</span><br>
Unzen!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Unzen：</span><br>
Hm? Yes? What is it?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Daisen：</span><br>
I said we've arrived.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Unzen：</span><br>
Oh, right. That we have.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Daisen：</span><br>
Well? What now?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Unzen：</span><br>
Now, we...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Daisen：</span><br>
......<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Unzen：</span><br>
......<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Shimanto：</span><br>
Um... Hey, nothing really bad's happened yet.<br>
There's no need for that doom and gloom, okay?<br>
If you need to vent, you can take it out on the enemy.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Unzen：</span><br>
Yes...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Shimanto：</span><br>
......<br>
Daisen, Watarase, hold her for me.<br>
The Dragon God shall give her her finest remedy!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Daisen：</span><br>
What are you going to do?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Shimanto：</span><br>
A little click and a snap! Take a photo, in other words!<br>
I'm going to get a good picture of her looking all distracted!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Unzen：</span><br>
I'd prefer it if you didn't...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Shimanto：</span><br>
And I'd prefer it if you stopped beating yourself up. The Commander isn't completely out of the woods yet.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Unzen：</span><br>
*sigh*... Understood.<br>
Let's fight back first, and save the thinking for later.<br>

<br>
Everyone except for Helena has left the headquarters to head to their designated defensive area.<br>
Meanwhile, I walk around the building's transparent observation deck, surveying the city.<br>
The entire metropolis has become increasingly blurry ever since Anzeel went away.<br>
The citizens, the police, even the autonomous combat units – everything capable of independent movement has vanished without anyone noticing.<br>
All that remains is this well-lit decoy. This shell of a city, empty yet ostensibly bustling.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
This really is just a dream...<br>
The only good thing is that the city's automated defense system is still running...<br>
No, wait – it's also good that it's just a dream. We're not truly fighting X, just the ghastly outlines of it.<br>
Anzeel said that Amahara is floating high above in orbit.<br>
It's an honest-to-god spaceship. I wonder what it looks like...<br>
How would I find it? The night is dark, and even the moon isn't out...<br>
*sigh*...<br>
If only I knew how long we have to hold out for...<br>
Unless... If we go back to the underground canals now, will we be able to reach EVA?<br>
<br>
For some reason, my thoughts are all jumbled, and I can't calm myself down no matter how I try.<br>
Before I catch a glimpse of a dash of crimson, I suddenly hear a voice from behind me.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Akagi：</span><br>
Your mind is in many places, I see.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Akagi?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Akagi：</span><br>
You've lost your composure, and your perception and judgment are both dull.<br>
I can't imagine a better opportunity than this to take you down.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
You don't have any reason to.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Akagi：</span><br>
Heehee...<br>
What if I told you...<br>
I do, because I'm not who you think I am?<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Huh?!<br>
Who are you?! Where's Helena?! What'd you do to her?!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Akagi：</span><br>
Ahahahahaha!<br>
I never imagined I'd see our celebrated Commander jump back in fear!<br>
Just kidding. It's only me.<br>
As for that guard of yours, I distracted her with a false alarm. It'll be a few more minutes before she comes back.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Wait, so why are you...?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Akagi：</span><br>
I was feeling a bit playful, that's all.<br>
Say, you don't look so good. Did something bad happen before I got here?<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
A LOT of things happened... A nightmare. But thankfully, only a nightmare.<br>
May I ask why you're here?<br>
I'm fairly sure the other Sakurans have left for their respective defensive areas.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Akagi：</span><br>
Indeed they have.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
And... you didn't go with them?<br>
Asama gave me the impression that the Sakuran fleet – you included – would follow my orders.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Akagi：</span><br>
Have you forgotten already, Commander? I was let go from all my official positions.<br>
I'm a free woman, and if I wish to stay here, then stay I can.<br>
I don't have to follow your orders. Not that I ever had to.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
...Fine. Do as you please, then.<br>
Wait, there's one thing I've been meaning to ask.<br>
You temporarily underwent METAmorphosis. Did you feel anything out of the ordinary after that happened?<br>
Or did you encounter anything unusual?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Akagi：</span><br>
Actually, I never underwent METAmorphosis due to Wisdom Cube corrosion. It was just a false reflection of myself.<br>
Speaking of unusual occurrences, though... Yes, something does come to mind.<br>
Have you ever experienced something akin to speaking with your inner demons?<br>
That vixen was only a reflection of me, and yet, we got into a heated argument.<br>
She not only knew a lot about me, but also seemed to have a mind of her own.<br>
In the end, I couldn't really tell what she truly was.<br>
I'm not sure if that fits your idea of "something unusual," but regardless.<br>
Why did you ask, anyway? That question came rather out of nowhere.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Well, I was just wondering if maybe she's watching us from a higher dimension.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Akagi：</span><br>
A higher dimension?<br>
<br>
She turns her gaze skyward, and all she sees are the dark clouds growing ever thicker.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Or maybe she's gone. It's a chaotic, confusing dream, so who knows?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Helena：</span><br>
*pant*... *pant*... Akagi, I went and checked!<br>
That system alert was just a false alarm. There was no intruder all this time.<br>
Thanks for watching the Commander while I was gone!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Akagi：</span><br>
Heehee. You're welcome.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Helena...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Helena：</span><br>
Hm?<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Actually, never mind.<br>
The battle's about to begin. We should get back to the underground shelter.<br>
What about you, Akagi?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Akagi：</span><br>
I'm not going there with you.<br>
Naturally, I'm not going to the front lines either.<br>
I think I'll stay right here. The view from the observation deck... is enough to make one's heart flutter.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Very well. Stay safe.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Akagi：</span><br>
Of course. You too, Commander.<br>

{{折叠面板|标题=The Black Wall|选项=30|主框=1|样式=primary|展开=是}}
<br>
The writhing nightmares finally resumed their offensive.<br>
Along with the rumbling of towering waves, a black wall rose in front of everyone's eyes.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Hakuhou：</span><br>
That black wall... Is it what I think it is?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Asama：</span><br>
Yes. The nightmares have coalesced.<br>
We vanquished them once only for them to return en masse like this...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Oumi：</span><br>
This is going to be a little... tricky.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Taekaze：</span><br>
I have an idea! We ought to compromise its structural integrity, like trying to collapse a dam!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Minase：</span><br>
Focus fire on a single point, in other words, then.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">I-404：</span><br>
Psh! That's easy!<br>
Kotama, cut open a path for us! Let's dance!<br>
<span style="color:#c3abff;">Kasumi META：</span><br>
A wall of black...<br>
<span style="color:#c3abff;">Jintsuu META：</span><br>
Thank the heavens this is but a dream. In reality, these nightmares would manifest as something far worse than a wall.<br>
<span style="color:#c3abff;">Vestal META：</span><br>
Is this... what NY City stared down in its final moments?<br>
<span style="color:#c3abff;">Memphis META：</span><br>
This time, we will help the city see another day.<br>
For the Commander! And for the duty we failed to fulfill!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Watarase：</span><br>
Everyone, the enemy force has revealed itself.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Shimanto：</span><br>
I wonder if the seadrake can handle this many of them...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Daisen：</span><br>
It seems I must release some of my anchors.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Unzen：</span><br>
They are but phantoms at the end of the day. We need only cut them all down.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Akagi：</span><br>
Now this is a sight to behold.<br>
Is this what your past is like?<br>
Is this the root of your fear?<br>
It's... out of this world.<br>
Alas, I'm sure that once we return, our memories will all be "blurred".<br>
Hey, other me – I know you can hear me.<br>
Listen. I don't want to forget any of what's happened today.<br>
So lend me a hand.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Helena：</span><br>
Commander, the enemy's main force is approaching the coast, and all allied fleets have begun engaging.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Send this reminder to all fleets: Don't charge in, but don't stand your ground in vain either.<br>
Retreat to the next area immediately when your current one is lost. All three fleets must take turns covering each other's retreats.<br>
Above all, don't forget that our mission is to stall for time.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Helena：</span><br>
Roger!<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Whew...<br>
Alright, black wall. Let's see what you're made of.<br>
{{折叠面板|内容结束}}

{{折叠面板|标题=Not a Moment Too Soon|选项=31|主框=1|样式=primary|展开=是}}
<br>
Great waves rocked the sea's surface even before the black wall approached.<br>
After the waves came tempestuous gales, then torrential rain.<br>
Enemies kept pouring out of the wall, despite the countless blows dealt to it.<br>
The front-line fleet's range of engagement was shrinking at a rate far beyond expectations.<br>
There was no changing the tide of the battle, even with the whole city providing fire support.<br>
In the meanwhile, Hakuhou and I-404 attempted close-range reconnaissance.<br>
However, black and highly viscous seawater and rain stopped them before they could get close. The enemy even nearly surrounded them.<br>
When I heard of this, I again strongly reminded all fleets not to take any risks, and hastened the defensive line's retreat.<br>
And so, within a short three hours, I had withdrawn all our fleets past the coastal defense line before anyone made any contact with the black wall.<br>
As the wall slowly approaches the coastline, the rainstorm over the city becomes even more intense.<br>
Thick, dark clouds swirl into a helix shape, like a gathering drillhead – it's a sign that a black tornado is forming.<br>
To make matters worse, the rain is gradually getting darker, accumulating into pools all over the city from which new enemies begin to creep out.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
No wonder Anzeel considered abandoning ninety percent of the city from the very beginning...<br>
<br>
But then, right at that moment, the ruthless winds stop.<br>
Three dazzling rays of light rip open the sky, and butterflies in three different colors emerge from the cracks.<br>
They flutter off in all directions, and wherever they go, the wind stops, the rain clears, and all traces of the nightmares vanish.<br>
<span style="color:#c3abff;">Vestal META：</span><br>
Are those... butterflies?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Minase：</span><br>
These tricolored butterflies represent the powers of the Venerable Three.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">I-404：</span><br>
They've sent us backup!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Shimanto：</span><br>
Heheh. Looks like they managed to find a stable route.<br>
<span style="color:#c3abff;">Memphis META：</span><br>
Whew... Helena came through for us!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Unzen：</span><br>
We should start preparing to retreat, everyone.<br>
Still, I implore you to remain on your guard.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Akagi：</span><br>
Yes... It's finally over.<br>
<br>
The butterflies flutter unimpeded through space, even filling up the shelter with their presence.<br>
They fly round and round in circles as they start to form loose vortices.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Helena：</span><br>
Commander! The butterflies are enveloping us!<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
I guess that's how they're going to bring us back.<br>
It's finally over...<br>
<br>
I relax my shoulders and let their glistening wings envelop me.<br>
As lights flood my vision, it's as if I'm able to see through the roof of the shelter and into the ruptured clouds above.<br>
There, up in the sky, shimmers a dazzling aurora.<br>
The light around me grows brighter, and I bathe in it.<br>
{{折叠面板|内容结束}}

{{折叠面板|标题=As Blue as the Sea|选项=32|主框=1|样式=primary|展开=是}}
<br>
When the light subsides, I see a city as quiet as death itself.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
What?<br>
...I'm still in NY City?<br>
What's going on here?<br>
Helena?<br>
Memphis?<br>
Akagi?<br>
Unzen?<br>
<br>
There is no response. Our comms channel is just as dead silent as the deserted city around me.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
...I'm all alone.<br>
<br>
THE PRISON IS SEALED<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
...Prison.<br>
Perceiving the prison drives a phantom into madness.<br>
It's this prison that traps Anzeel. That keeps her from escaping.<br>
<br>
A PRISON OF THE MIND<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Does that mean that my perceiving it has trapped me, too?<br>
<br>
THERE IS NO ESCAPE<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Is it because I know too much about the past now?<br>
Have I become intrinsically linked with this world?<br>
<br>
There is no answer to my question.<br>
Because nobody is here to answer it.<br>
After all, I exist alone in this city now.<br>
A black wall suddenly comes into view.<br>
I gaze at it.<br>
It seems to gaze back at me.<br>
The air is silent, but I seemingly can hear the cacophony within.<br>
Within that encroaching wall is a storm of madness trying to break free.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Is this what the real Anzeel saw in her last moments, too?<br>
<br>
ARE YOU READY<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
I...<br>
<br>
Nobody's here to back me up now. This isn't a carefully curated experiment.<br>
No reinforcements. They all left.<br>
YOUR END HAS COME<br>
YOU WILL DIE HERE<br>
JUST LIKE THE REST<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
I...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Dr. Anzeel：</span><br>
Then the Magister Plan was a success... and a glimmer of hope remains at Dusk.<br>
You. You might be truly special.<br>
Because you managed to truly escape!<br>
Assistant, go somewhere else that's safe.<br>
Sorry, assistant.<br>
Thank you, assistant. For giving me this fleeting dream.<br>
<br>
BANG!<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
No... I can't let it end this way.<br>
They'll realize I didn't make it out with them.<br>
I just need to buy time until they come back.<br>
Of course! I can still go to EVA.<br>
I'll go to the underground canal...<br>
Find a transport ship...<br>
No matter what, I have to survive!<br>
<br>
I run desperately through the deserted streets.<br>
When I fall, I get up again, and I repeat the process when I fall once more.<br>
The black wall gradually engulfs the levees. It isn't far behind me.<br>
And then...<br>
"Don't be afraid. I'm here."<br>
Helena META's voice whispers in my ears.<br>
It's as gentle as a breeze.<br>
I look to the source of that breeze...<br>
And there she stands.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
...Helena? Is that you?<br>
<br>
As much as I pride myself on my rich knowledge and experience, even I'm stunned by what I see.<br>
She's enormous. As if the world itself could fit in the palm of her hand.<br>
At the same time a distant projection and a firm figure atop the heavens.<br>
"I'll shatter this cell."<br>
Three rings descend one after another and spin above the city.<br>
A blue light condenses between them.<br>
The black wall exudes a sense of... panic.<br>
Twisted nightmares begin appearing out of thin air and swarming in from all directions.<br>
They've realized that something is amiss.<br>
And so they rush to overwhelm me.<br>
"Nice try."<br>
The rings vibrate, bathing the city in a torrent of blue.<br>
I hear the enraged, resentful shrieks of the once-silent nightmares.<br>
The black wall begins to crumble. It becomes a black wind, then a cloud, and then mist.<br>
But no matter where I go, whether I approach or retreat...<br>
It never enters the city, remaining just beyond the edges of the rings.<br>
"The End."<br>
There's a soft sound akin to a bubble popping.<br>
All the blackness in the world vanishes at once.<br>
The blue giant smiles at me...<br>
...And the world collapses.<br>
I bathe in light as blue as the sea.<br>

<br>
This time, the light doesn't fade immediately.<br>
I feel as if it's cradling me, carrying me down a winding path.<br>
I can't see her, but I can feel her presence by my side.<br>
<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项1：Helena?</span>'''''<br>
<span style="color:#ffc960;">Helena META：</span><br>
Yeah, it's me... You're safe now.<br>
<br>
She sounds exhausted.<br>
<span style="color:#ffc960;">Helena META：</span><br>
After this... you must leave the Sakura Empire as quickly as you can.<br>
Talk with Yamato before you go. She's on the right path, so she mustn't give up.<br>
Don't stay in the Iris Orthodoxy, either. Find an excuse to pay a visit to the Royal Navy.<br>
The META Elizabeth is there. There's no safer place for you than with her.<br>
......<br>
I... have to leave you for a while.<br>
I've made a decision. A very important once.<br>
For us... and for those we've lost.<br>
Don't worry. We'll meet again before long.<br>
Until then, take care of yourself.<br>
......<br>

Goodbye.<br>

<br>
Once the light has faded, I see a complex of luxurious buildings rising above a sea of clouds.<br>
Hakuhou, Akagi, Unzen, Helena, and Memphis META... Everyone from the dream is here.<br>
They all seem like they just got back, too. Everyone looks at me with a smile on their face.<br>
Everything in that dream had happened in mere moments in reality. Nobody even notices that I've fallen a little bit behind.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Is it really over this time?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Helena：</span><br>
Yeah... I think so!<br>
<span style="color:#c3abff;">Vestal META：</span><br>
Hold on, everyone.<br>
We just woke up from a profound nightmare. If anything feels amiss, you need to speak up right away.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Hakuhou：</span><br>
Hmm... Nothing wrong here.<br>
But for some reason, I can't remember what I was doing just now.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Oumi：</span><br>
Same here... It's like I just woke up from a drunken dream.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Shimanto：</span><br>
Does anyone else feel like we were in the middle of a big fight?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">I-404：</span><br>
Yeah! In some coastal city, right?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Taekaze：</span><br>
Huh? It wasn't by a lake?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Minase：</span><br>
I do believe it was a river...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">I-404：</span><br>
Hmm... Was it?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Unzen：</span><br>
...Maybe. It eludes me, too.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Hakuhou：</span><br>
Wow. Even Unzen can't remember it.<br>
Akagi, do you remember anything?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Akagi：</span><br>
...I'm afraid I'm just as clueless as the rest of you.<br>
<span style="color:#c3abff;">Jintsuu META：</span><br>
It was a very different dimension, so it's normal for our memories to come out fuzzy.<br>
Still, it was a nightmare. Better for everyone to forget it.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">I-404：</span><br>
Hmm... Maybe you're right.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Akagi：</span><br>
Heh...<br>
<span style="color:#c3abff;">Memphis META：</span><br>
Looks like everyone is safe, so we're gonna head out soon.<br>
What about you, Commander?<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
...I think I'd like to leave for now.<br>
Until you've ironed out the kinks here, I don't want to stay for too long.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Hakuhou：</span><br>
That's totally understandable.<br>
I'll show you the way to Ama no Tobira right away.<br>

<br>
Ama no Tobira<br>
Central Palace<br>
Sometime later...<br>
After returning to Ama no Tobira from Amahara, Unzen escorts me to where Yamato is.<br>
To my surprise, however, I find only Ikazuchi and Inazuma waiting for me. Yamato herself is nowhere to be seen.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ikazuchi：</span><br>
"We meet again, {playername}."<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Is that... you, Yamato?<br>
You invited me to come, and you still won't show yourself?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Inazuma：</span><br>
"Oh, but I am here."<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ikazuchi：</span><br>
"I am all things that you saw on your way here."<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
What?<br>
Are you saying you've merged with Ama no Tobira?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Inazuma：</span><br>
"It had to be done for Amahara's sake."<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Why?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ikazuchi：</span><br>
"A truth regarding the Wisdom Cubes surely hasn't escaped you – that they aren't required for us to materialize."<br>

"You beheld it with the Rite of Resurrection. We have no need even for physical bodies."<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ikazuchi：</span><br>
"So I ask you: What DO we need? Where does our essence lie?"<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
In a network that... links Wisdom Cubes together?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Inazuma：</span><br>
"Precisely. I forsook a physical body so that I may explore this limitless domain."<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ikazuchi：</span><br>
"Alas, on this one occasion, I was foolhardy."<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Inazuma：</span><br>
"I was much too hasty."<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
It wasn't all your fault. Part of the blame lies with me.<br>
We both underestimated this place.<br>
However, it is true that this place has limitless potential.<br>
As long as you stick to your original plans and aren't tempted by seemingly miraculous technology, I'll keep supporting your endeavor.<br>
Together, we can grow the Sky Realm into a bunker for the mind.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ikazuchi：</span><br>
"By our own hands shall we protect our home."<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Inazuma：</span><br>
"That is my wish."<br>

Ama no Tobira<br>
Elsewhere<br>
Sometime later...<br>
After saying goodbye to Yamato, Akagi told me that she wanted to see me one more time before I leave the Sakura Empire.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Akagi：</span><br>
How did you like your journey into the Sky Realm of Amahara?<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
It turned into something completely different from what I originally expected.<br>
I understand why you were grumpy at the table earlier. It was because of the Dream Stones.<br>
Did you already know what they really were back then?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Akagi：</span><br>
Heh. They don't have the experience of being deceived that I do.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Sounds like you've come to terms with it.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Akagi：</span><br>
What does it matter if I've come to terms with it or not?<br>
Now that I'm here, in the Sky Realm, it's no exaggeration to say my fate is intertwined with its own.<br>
I refuse to die in my sleep one day without knowing what happened.<br>
Oh, on another note – this didn't count as fulfilling our promise.<br>
<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项1：Come again?</span>'''''<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项2：You mean our promise to travel together?</span>'''''<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Akagi：</span><br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项1）</span>'''''Heh. It's nothing.<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项1）</span>'''''Just know that I don't plan on being stuck in Amahara for the rest of my days.<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项1）</span>'''''The next time we meet, I'll be sure to remind you.<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项1）</span>'''''We've said all that needs to be said. I'm sure you don't want to linger here, so let's go.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Akagi：</span><br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项2）</span>'''''Yes, that one.<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项2）</span>'''''Just know that I don't plan on being stuck in Amahara for the rest of my days.<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项2）</span>'''''The next time we meet, in reality, I will host a most wonderful banquet at my estate just for you.<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项2）</span>'''''After that, I'll take you to see everything there is to see.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项2）</span>'''''Sounds nice. I can't wait.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Akagi：</span><br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项2）</span>'''''Good. Now, it's time for you to head back.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Akagi：</span><br>
I hope that the next time we meet, those nightmares won't show up again to spoil the fun.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Wait, "those nightmares"?<br>
You... remember what happened?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Akagi：</span><br>
Heheh. Perhaps.<br>

Location unknown - Compiling Field<br>
In a garden surrounded by stars, an important dialogue was being held.<br>
<span style="color:#c3abff;">Yorktown META：</span><br>
Have you already made up your mind?<br>
<span style="color:#ffc960;">Helena META：</span><br>
I have.<br>
<span style="color:#c3abff;">Yorktown META：</span><br>
Who is it for this time? The Commander, or yourself?<br>
<span style="color:#ffc960;">Helena META：</span><br>
......<br>
It's for everyone. Every last one of us.<br>
<span style="color:#c3abff;">Yorktown META：</span><br>
Don't you think there are too many uncontrollable variables in this plan?<br>
<span style="color:#ffc960;">Helena META：</span><br>
With enough determination, anything is possible.<br>
Sure, there's some risk, but we've been accumulating power for this very moment.<br>
The Commander's life shouldn't be like this. Our world shouldn't be like this, either.<br>
You, me, those people... Not a single person should have to endure this.<br>
As the silver lining of this incident, the last piece has fallen into place.<br>
We don't have to worry about the prison anymore.<br>
Add to that the environment created by the cross-border experiments, and the forces on our side.<br>
We have the right time, place, and people. Now is our best opportunity.<br>
<span style="color:#c3abff;">Yorktown META：</span><br>
I'll give you that the META Elizabeth will support us, but what about the Ashes?<br>
They still have yet to respond.<br>
<span style="color:#ffc960;">Helena META：</span><br>
They're just watching from the side for the moment. They haven't found bait that's sweet enough yet.<br>
But they will find it eventually, and then they'll jump into action. I guarantee it.<br>
Nobody can stop what's going to happen. Not even Friedrich der Große.<br>
Just you wait...<br>

<br>
Commander's Private Plane<br>
On the way home<br>
It was time for me to leave the Sakura Empire.<br>
Helena META wouldn't tell me to do something without a good reason.<br>
I gave Elizabeth a call. She promptly came up with an excuse to request my assistance.<br>
Assuming all goes according to plan, I will officially receive orders to visit the Royal Islands as soon as my plane lands.<br>
Amidst their journey, a sense of drowsiness crept into the air.<br>
Subsequently, one passenger fell into a dream.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Helena：</span><br>
Is this... a battlefield?<br>
<br>
The entire world seems to be ablaze.<br>
The seas. The clouds. Even the bolts of lightning falling from the sky.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Helena：</span><br>
Something's not right. It's just like before...<br>
Did the Commander end up here, too?<br>
I've got to look...<br>
<br>
Helena tried to whip up the water to block off the heat, but she couldn't move a single step from where she stood.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Helena：</span><br>
It's so hot... It burns...<br>
I need to... get out of here, now...<br>
<br>
A nearby wreckage provided temporary shelter from the heat, allowing her to catch her breath if only for a moment.<br>
Then, she saw more of the battlefield.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Helena：</span><br>
Louis... Saratoga... Lexington!<br>
Don't go there! It's dangerous! What are you all doing?<br>
No! Come back!<br>
<br>
A firestorm swept them up in an instant. Their little fleet vanished in the bright light.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Helena：</span><br>
NOOO!<br>
*gasp*!<br>
Just a dream... Calm down, Helena... It was just a dream...<br>
Everything's okay...<br>
<br>
She raised her handheld mirror and saw the sweat-streaked face reflected in it.<br>
<span style="color:#bdbdbd;">???：</span><br>
......<br>
<br>
For a moment, the reflection bore the countenance of someone else. Familiar, but not hers.<br>
But, the very next moment, her reflection returned to normal.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Helena：</span><br>
...Was it just my imagination?<br>
<br>
She looked at it over and over, but whatever she saw did not show itself again.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Helena：</span><br>
It must've been my eyes playing tricks on me after that dream...<br>
It was nothing... Everything is fine...<br>
You told me everything will be fine as long as I stay by the Commander's side...<br>
And I trust that you're right, other me.<br>
I don't know what you're planning to do...<br>
But stay safe, wherever you are.<br>

Eagle Union - Sea of Stars<br>
Command Center<br>
Argo Navis - Section B1C<br>
Saratoga stared at the files placed in front of her with a look of incredulity, rereading them several times.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Saratoga：</span><br>
You're telling me the experiments finally yielded results?!<br>
That after all this time, we finally have something to show for our efforts?!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Langley II：</span><br>
Yes. I reviewed this report twice before submitting it. It is absolutely feasible, in theory.<br>
After a series of advancements built on top of the Type II rigging's technological framework, we've finally found a solution that will work for Lexington!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Saratoga：</span><br>
I gotta report this to the Commander right now!<br>
Wait, no... This is just a plan. A feasible plan, but still. I need something more concrete first!<br>
I'll have to distribute this plan across all our departments, give it top priority, and then...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Langley II：</span><br>
Well, on that topic–<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Saratoga：</span><br>
I'm gonna go talk to Alaska and Missouri.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Langley II：</span><br>
Alright.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Saratoga：</span><br>
Before I go...<br>
Get TB to prepare to activate the Galactic Core. I want to see it for myself!<br>

Somewhere...<br>
KABOOOM!<br>
Enterprise and Essex META appear on the ocean's surface with a boom.<br>
<span style="color:#ffc960;">Essex META：</span><br>
...They're getting close.<br>
<span style="color:#ffc960;">Enterprise META：</span><br>
This chase has gone on long enough. Time to settle this.<br>
<span style="color:#ffc960;">Essex META：</span><br>
Look... They've come.<br>
<br>
A swarm of countless drones blotted out the cloudy sky, and shortly thereafter, a fleet of floating battleships entered their view.<br>
Alerted by the explosion from just moments ago, the fleet had shifted into a combat-ready formation.<br>
<span style="color:#ffc960;">Enterprise META：</span><br>
That formation... It's them. A Council Task Force.<br>
They've finally caught up.<br>
<br>
Neither of the two was fazed even with countless guns aimed at them. They simply stood silently on the sea's surface.<br>
They were waiting for the moment someone from the fleet would show up, and ask them about their objective.<br>
Finally, a figure broke forth from the fleet and approached them head-on.<br>
<span style="color:#ffc960;">Hornet META：</span><br>
This is the Council's Task Force 7, currently on a patrol mission.<br>
Who are you? Why are you blocking our path?<br>
<span style="color:#ffc960;">Enterprise META：</span><br>
...Hornet?<br>
I don't understand...<br>
<span style="color:#ffc960;">Hornet META：</span><br>
You know me?<br>
Wait a second...<br>
Is that you...<br>
...Enty?<br>
