<br>
After Helena META and I had our talk, I informed the Sakurans that I would accept their invitation to Ama no Tobira.<br>
After an entire day of preparation, Helena and I set off towards that mysterious place on the fifth day since our arrival.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Helena：</span><br>
What is this place we're heading to, Commander? A harbor?<br>
<br>
Our journey was a series of surprises from the very start.<br>
I'd thought we'd go to a mountain concealing some enormous underground facility, but instead we made a beeline for a harbor.<br>
Then, the Sakurans guided us away from the mainland.<br>
Helena and I began making guesses as to our route. That was when we noticed that the scenery outside the window had changed while we weren't looking.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Helena：</span><br>
Did we... just enter a Mirror Sea?<br>
It's so pretty. Like being inside a Sakuran picture scroll.<br>
A palace composed of archaic buildings silently stands on the sea's surface.<br>
<br>
It is divided by two arterial roads running from east to west and north to south, and is arranged into three distinct circular areas from the inside to the outside.<br>
Each area does not form a unified whole, but rather is subdivided into further areas of varying sizes due to the waterways running across it.<br>
Buildings radiating golden light dot the cityscape, following the layout rule of short on the outside and tall on the inside.<br>
Finally, at its centermost point stands an enormous tower that pierces through nature and the clouds.<br>
The files on the Sakura Empire that I read had a name for it – the Dragon Palace.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Tosa：</span><br>
Commander {playername}, Helena, you must go through the palace you see now to reach Ama no Tobira.<br>
However, this is as far as I can take you.<br>
The sluice leading further in has been opened. Once you enter, the ones appointed by the Venerable Three will escort you the rest of the way.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Helena：</span><br>
Huh? You're not coming with us?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Tosa：</span><br>
No. I haven't been permitted to enter the premises.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
This place is the Dragon Palace, isn't it?<br>
Sure sounds tightly managed for being just a waypoint on the way to Ama no Tobira.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Tosa：</span><br>
Right you are. It is the Dragon Palace.<br>
It didn't always take so long to enter it... until the Naraka incident happened, during which the Palace suffered extensive damage.<br>
Due to the importance of the ritual, certain unique environmental modifications were added when Yamato conducted emergency repairs.<br>
These turned the Dragon Palace into a genuine extension of Ama no Tobira, which, needless to say, necessitated stricter management.<br>
I know little more beyond that point. You will have to ask your guides.<br>
Now, go.<br>
<br>
And so, Helena and I boarded a command vessel and passed through the Dragon Palace's open sluice.<br>
The instant the sluice closes, our surroundings once again change dramatically.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Helena：</span><br>
Commander, we're... We're under the sea, somehow!<br>
<br>
Looking up, I see that the blue sky has turned into dim seawater.<br>
Countless fish are drawn to the light emitted by the city. They form schools and swim around the outside of the protective barrier.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
How? The files I read said it takes an hour and a half to reach its maximum depth...<br>
And it just happened in an instant.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Daisen：</span><br>
Heehee. I hope you aren't too frightened by this sudden change.<br>
I am Daisen, and this lady beside me is Shimanto. We shall be your guides.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Shimanto：</span><br>
Good to see you again, Commander {playername}.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
It's a pleasure, Daisen and Shimanto.<br>
I will say, I was anticipating seeing all sorts of unexpected things after entering Ama no Tobira...<br>
I just didn't expect to be already dazzled just while on the way there.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Daisen：</span><br>
Heheh. The Dragon Palace originally was reliant purely on its mechanical structure for diving and resurfacing, which took quite some time.<br>
The files you read were simply a little out of date.<br>
Now, following Yamato's modifications, the Dragon Palace cannot be considered a completely worldly thing anymore.<br>
As such, it's no wonder that it's capable of trivial things like diving and resurfacing in an instant.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Such fascinating technology. Could you tell me a little more?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Daisen：</span><br>
Why, of course. I shall do that after you ask your next question.<br>
You see, the explanation for it should be the same as the next thing you wish to ask.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
My next question? Well, you're right, because I do have another question.<br>
Since we're deep underwater, I assume Ama no Tobira is hidden somewhere down here, right?<br>
Are we gonna board a submarine and travel to it, or can the Dragon Palace go there on its own?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Shimanto：</span><br>
There's no need to bother with either of those things. The Dragon Palace has a doorway that connects directly to Ama no Tobira, so we just need to go through that.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
(A doorway?)<br>
(Does she mean like a portal into a Singularity? I didn't see any large structures from outside the Palace, though. Has the Sakura Empire managed to create miniaturized portals?)<br>
(Wait, no!)<br>
(From the Tower of Midgard and the Gate of Avalon, to the Winter's Crown, and even Naraka, all entrances to a Singularity have one thing in common – they're fixed in place.)<br>
(Have the Sakurans created an artificial Singularity that can be moved around?!)<br>
Shimanto, is this "doorway" the entrance to a Singularity?<br>
How did you manage to make a portal entryway that's both small and can be freely repositioned?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Shimanto：</span><br>
Umm... It's just a regular doorway!<br>
Ama no Tobira doesn't exist in the physical world. Only the doorway does.<br>
If you're wondering why the doorway was set up in this place, you'd have to ask Lady Yamato why she did that, because I don't know.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
(Sounds like she really has no idea.)<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Daisen：</span><br>
The doorway exists both here and elsewhere at the same time.<br>
Much like how the Palace exists both under the sea and on the surface.<br>
By extension, you will enter Ama no Tobira by going through the doorway, just as you went under the sea by passing through the sluice.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Wait, you're saying there are two Dragon palaces, and one exists above the water, and one under it? And they're connected by sluices that function as teleporters?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Daisen：</span><br>
No, there is but one Dragon Palace. Impossible feats such as this are made possible by it no longer being a worldly place.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
(Okay, this doesn't make any sense to me...)<br>
(Best to just drop the topic for now. I'll make a mental note to ask Helena META about it later.)<br>
Alright... I think I get the gist.<br>
What about before the modifications to the Palace? As far as I know, Ama no Tobira is older than it.<br>
How'd you get to Ama no Tobira in the past?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Daisen：</span><br>
In the past... it took much, much longer than it does now.<br>
Now, you can simply enter Ama no Tobira if you have an invitation. Back then, the only way to access it was through the Sacred Sakura's ground network.<br>
Entering it was beyond my abilities at the time.<br>
In fact, only ones like Shimanto who can freely travel through the Sacred Sakura would be able to enter it.<br>
Furthermore, the entrance was originally established here per Lady Yamato's orders to ensure the Rite of Resurrection went smoothly.<br>
Once the Rite was complete, Lady Yamato opted to keep it rather than have it removed.<br>
It's this decision that's allowed us the opportunity to see Ama no Tobira for ourselves.<br>
Ah, apologies. Listen to me, rambling on!<br>
This way, please, Commander and Helena.<br>
<br>
For a long time now, the Sakura Empire has had little contact with other factions, whilst being a place shrouded in mystery.<br>
Among said mysteries, those involving Yamato are all the more baffling.<br>
Beyond her name and the fact that she's a shipgirl, the higher-ups of the Azur Lane currently possess zero valuable knowledge on her.<br>
Even during the Naraka incident, which she played an instrumental role in, nobody actually saw her in person.<br>
"The Rite of Resurrection." A mere four words with an impact that cannot be overstated.<br>
A resurrection is not the same as a shipgirl being incapacitated in battle and brought back for repairs so she can return to the front line.<br>
Many Sakuran shipgirls suffered grave wounds in the Naraka incident. Some even had their bodies completely destroyed.<br>
Ordinarily, it would be impossible to make a recovery in such a case, even if the shipgirl received repairs... and yet, Yamato made the impossible happen.<br>
By literally resurrecting them solely relying on their "souls" – the sum of all the information that should be stored within their hulls, no less.<br>
Regardless of how she awakened them, the mere fact that she managed to preserve every bit of information that should've vanished in a blink is, by itself, immensely thought-provoking.<br>
Especially so after witnessing that brilliant glow the Rose Tower released in its final moments...<br>
Yamato is most likely up to something incredible – and I can't wait to see it.<br>
"Since the inception of my being"<br>
"A thought hath occupied my mind"<br>
"That the armor and the sword, whilst poignant..."<br>
"Cannot impede the plotting of the mind"<br>
"The evils beyond the realm all excel at this"<br>
"Thus, neither can I see nor sense it"<br>
"By the rocks, the realm is drawn"<br>
"By the realm, the source is forged"<br>
"The Sky Realm – it formeth a wall against the world beyond"<br>
"And thus is the domain within it defined – Amahara"<br>
"Even should the earth collapse and the mountains crumble, a great disaster is inevitable"<br>
"The Sky Realm of Amahara"<br>
"Forevermore must it last"<br>

<br>
After passing through the gate, the scenery changes in a flash.<br>
Much to our surprise, Helena and I walk in a sea of golden clouds.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Taekaze：</span><br>
Commander {playername}...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Minase：</span><br>
And Helena!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">I-404：</span><br>
Welcome to Ama no Tobira!<br>
<br>
Bang!<br>
Party poppers hidden within the clouds go off en masse. Confetti pours down like sparks, glittering and then vanishing without a trace.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">I-404：</span><br>
Commander {playername}, I'm I-404, and this is Taekaze and Minase. We'll be escorting you together.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Helena：</span><br>
Um, nice to meet you...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">I-404：</span><br>
Nice to meet you, too.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Taekaze：</span><br>
Let's be friends!<br>
<br>
This journey had left me on edge. The enthusiasm and energy with which they greet us soothes my tense nerves.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
You're the third group to escort us today. Is this some kind of relay race, just with hospitality instead of a baton?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">I-404：</span><br>
A hospitality relay race? Yeah, that sounds about right!<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Why are you doing it like this if Daisen and Shimanto are allowed inside Ama no Tobira as well?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">I-404：</span><br>
There are two reasons – one is that they still have repair work to do at the Dragon Palace.<br>
Another is that Ama no Tobira is preparing for a special ceremony that needs the environment to remain stable.<br>
And for that, the fewer people that come or go, the better.<br>
Also, this ceremony will be held for your sake, so that's something to look forward to.<br>
Oh, right, I'm curious...<br>
Do either of you have any thoughts on seeing this mystical place in person?<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
You bet I do.<br>
Truth be told, I did some reading on it before coming here.<br>
Judging by the mythological sound of its name, I thought this place would be closed off, dark, and a little oppressive.<br>
Or that maybe it'd be a collection of primitive stone buildings.<br>
Now that I'm here, though, it looks like a very spacious, bright place.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">I-404：</span><br>
Ahahaha! Yeah, I thought the same thing.<br>
But when you think about it, Lady Yamato wouldn't live in some dark, suffocating place, would she?<br>
You're right about it being closed off, for sure. As for your impression of it being spacious – well, you'll see later.<br>
What about you, Helena?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Helena：</span><br>
Like the Commander said, it feels bright and open. It's also got a soothing vibe that naturally makes you relax.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">I-404：</span><br>
Exactly! That soothing vibe is without a doubt authentic.<br>
There are numerous magic circles deployed all around inside Ama no Tobira, some of which have the effect of using positive emotions to stabilize the mind.<br>
Just being here soothes your mind, relieves stress, and lifts your mood.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
(Ahh. So this feeling of ease I'm getting is because of those magic circles Yamato put up.)<br>
("Stabilizing the mind with positive emotions." Interesting stuff.)<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">I-404：</span><br>
Man, thank gosh for Ama no Tobira! It makes me never want to go back.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
You mean you haven't always been here?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">I-404：</span><br>
No, silly. Taekaze, Minase, and I only came here after the Dragon Palace's doorway was fixed.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
I see. So it's gradually become more accessible ever since the Naraka incident, then?<br>
Actually, why'd you even come here?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">I-404：</span><br>
Heh. To complete the task given to us by the Venerable Three, duh.<br>
What task, you ask? Just like that special ritual, that's a secret for now.<br>
Anyway, come along, you two! Follow me!<br>
{{折叠面板|内容结束}}

{{折叠面板|标题=Ride the Clouds|选项=3|主框=1|样式=primary|展开=是}}
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">I-404：</span><br>
Anyway, come along, you two! Follow me!<br>
<br>
Atop the vast sea of clouds, I-404 gives us a quick nod and makes an "if you'd please" gesture with her hand.<br>
At the same time, a gust of wind blows, and the cloud at our feet gently begins moving forward like a magic carpet.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Helena：</span><br>
Whoa! Are we flying on a cloud?!<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Yeah. It's incredible.<br>
I've not done anything this fantastical since my trip into the Martyrium.<br>
The clouds formed a sea back then, too, and we sailed and fought on top of it.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Helena：</span><br>
Sailing and fighting on the clouds... You've done so many things on your own that I've never even heard about.<br>
And I wasn't able to help you then...<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
We've all got our own duties. I, Memphis, and even you.<br>
And look on the bright side – at least this time, we're riding the same cloud together.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Helena：</span><br>
You're right. I'll try!<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Yeah, you'll try – to enjoy our vacation.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Helena：</span><br>
Commandeeer!<br>
<br>
Our cloud gradually accelerates until it's going so fast that our surroundings start to blur.<br>
We go past one thing after another – mountains and islets floating in the sky, dense and large greenery, and pagodas of unclear purpose.<br>
After flying for a while, I-404's boredom finally becomes too much. She accelerates and jumps toward an adjacent cloud, which then starts gaining speed along with ours.<br>
Shortly thereafter, Minase and Taekaze join in on the fun, and they nimbly dash through the sky and each board a cloud of their own.<br>
I encourage Helena to do the same.<br>
She is shy at first, but eventually gets into it and has a good time.<br>
30 minutes of flying later, our group arrives with skipping and leaping energy at our destination.<br>
The clouds decelerate imperceptibly, and we go deep into some buildings equally imperceptibly.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Given our speed, we should've crashed right through those buildings. How'd we just slide through them?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">I-404：</span><br>
An astute observation from the Azur Lane's master strategist.<br>
Most people wouldn't notice even after staying here for a long time, while you caught on immediately.<br>
Ama no Tobira might at first look like an endless expanse, but it's actually divided up by barriers. It's a place made up of countless smaller spaces.<br>
If I had to use an analogy, I guess it's like... a 3D puzzle? Or maybe more like a pile of blocks.<br>
And the boundary between spaces is both clearly and vaguely defined.<br>
It's clear that the spaces are definitely distinct from each other. Kind of like small dreams that exist at once but are independent of each other.<br>
And the vagueness – it lies in the blurriness between spaces. It's like leaving and coming into a dream.<br>
That's why you don't notice how you got in, and it's why we won't ram into and smash any buildings.<br>
Same with the clouds. The ones we're riding now and the ones we rode before look identical, but they're actually different.<br>
Oh, look, we're here just on time. I'm such a good pilot!<br>
Commander {playername}, Helena, you'll get to dine soon. Let's head to the hall.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Wait, dine?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">I-404：</span><br>
Oops... Did I forget to mention that?<br>
Ahem, well, Ladies Yamato, Musashi, and Shinano are busy with that ritual, so Unzen will be treating you to some refreshments this evening.<br>
I'm guessing the three arranged it this way since they know you and Lady Unzen are acquainted.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Unzen? Who?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">I-404：</span><br>
The Great Sage!<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Oh!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Unzen：</span><br>
Did you find our cuisine satisfactory?<br>
The way here is rather jumbled. To pass through my barrier, you had to overcome the realm of possibility to arrive here.<br>
Or perhaps I should say... that this is fate?<br>
Are you wondering whether I'm the same as the other girls?<br>
You are, in many ways, a unique being.<br>
Can you feel it, too?<br>
Life is unpredictable. Sometimes, even an instant can last an eternity...<br>
How beautiful the moon is tonight.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
So that was her...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">I-404：</span><br>
Ahaha! Come on, this way, Commander!<br>
{{折叠面板|内容结束}}

{{折叠面板|标题=A Table in the Sea of Clouds|选项=4|主框=1|样式=primary|展开=是}}
<br>
I-404 leads the way and escorts us inside a pagoda.<br>
As she does so, Helena and I part ways. She goes to another banquet, and I head to the top floor of the building.<br>
Although the room across the paper door is dead silent, I can make out a few figures on the other side.<br>
<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项1：(Move the sliding door.)</span>'''''<br>
<br>
A wooden table in a deep color stands in the not-especially-large room.<br>
It soon becomes filled with plates lined with appetizers served cold in acknowledgement of my arrival.<br>
The view through the windows is sunny, with rolling clouds.<br>
A gentle breeze grazes a cherry tree branch, sending several petals scattering in its wake.<br>
Clean air blows in, and the cherry blossoms outside the window and the flower arrangements indoors dance with each other. It's as though a gust of flower petals rolls up into this small space.<br>
Amidst this gust, I take another look at the four people who are at the table with me.<br>
Two of them I'm already acquainted with.<br>
The Great Sage, Unzen, is one. We met just once several years ago. She helped from the background in the Naraka incident as well as the Day the Stars Faded.<br>
She sits opposite me and gives me a small nod.<br>
The other person is someone I met outside the Naraka Singularity and fought with both as an ally and as an enemy. The former string-puller of the Sakura Empire whom I vowed to travel with someday. Akagi.<br>
Having been removed from all her official positions to reflect on her mistakes in Ama no Tobira, it's both surprising yet perfectly expected to see her at the table.<br>
When I slid aside the door, her ears twitched ever so faintly. Although she didn't turn around to greet me, she instantly exuded an intense aura that compelled me to sit next to her.<br>
Besides those two, there's also a woman in black clothing with an elegant smile, and a girl dressed in white with a gaze oozing with curiosity directed at me.<br>
I wonder who they are.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Unzen：</span><br>
How quickly the days and months pass. I did not think we would meet again under these circumstances.<br>
I'm delighted to see you again, Commander {playername}.<br>
<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项1：Yeah, it's been a while, Great Sage.</span>'''''<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Unzen：</span><br>
Great Sage... That brings back memories.<br>
At the time, I had no name beyond "Great Sage," and you were still a student at the Academy.<br>
Now, I am Unzen, and you are a commander who's known around the world.<br>
Did you imagine a future such as this on that day?<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Nope. I wouldn't have predicted it in a million years.<br>
My future plans then were completely different from what they are now. I'm guessing yours were, too.<br>
Still, isn't it pretty good with how things turned out?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Unzen：</span><br>
Yes. I think it is.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Akagi：</span><br>
Ahem. Unzen, some might consider it rude to barrage the Commander with questions without even a social nicety.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Unzen：</span><br>
Oh, allow me to apologize for that. Commander, please make yourself at home.<br>
Allow me to introduce you to these ladies. This is Asama, and this is Hakuhou.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Asama：</span><br>
It's a pleasure to make your acquaintance, Commander of the Azur Lane. My name is Asama. I hope that we may be mutually cordial.<br>
<br>
The woman in black gives me an elegant bow of the head.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Hakuhou：</span><br>
I am Hakuhou. Greetings to you, Commander.<br>
<br>
The girl in white then gives me an introduction.<br>
Curiously, though, her gaze keeps flipping between Unzen and Akagi, suggesting that something's on her mind.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Unzen：</span><br>
Now that we are all introduced, let us eat.<br>
<br>
My amazement with Ama no Tobira grows as our meal begins.<br>
I hear an elegant performance, even though there's no player or instrument nearby.<br>
Food appears when I'm not looking, empty plates vanish tracelessly, and sake pours continuously from my cup no matter how much I drink.<br>
It's like it's all part of a beautiful dream.<br>
Later, during the meal...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Unzen：</span><br>
It was going to be Lady Musashi and Lady Shinano who would've joined you at the table on this occasion, given that Lady Yamato invited you...<br>
Unfortunately, as they are busy with the ritual, I was given a seat instead.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
I heard about the ritual thing from I-404 just earlier. Said it's got something to do with me.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Unzen：</span><br>
Yes, indeed it does.<br>
I take it you're well-acquainted with the idea of dreams on account of your closeness with Lady Shinano, correct?<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Kind of. I know a thing or two.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Unzen：</span><br>
Then, would you say that Ama no Tobira is a dream?<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Well, I thought a lot about it on the way here.<br>
A lot of the things I've seen since coming here have the characteristics of a typical dream.<br>
The only difference is, I'm clearly aware of it all.<br>
Even if this were a dream, I entered it on my own initiative, rather than ending up here during a deep sleep.<br>
So, to answer your question... I can't say definitively just yet.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Unzen：</span><br>
A place that is like a dream, but isn't.<br>
Why does it behave like that, you ask? Because this is not a physical world ruled by matter, but a heavenly world ruled by the mind. The "Sky Realm".<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Hm? The Sky Realm?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Unzen：</span><br>
Yes. What we call Ama no Tobira is no more than another doorway that Lady Yamato constructed.<br>
Once you step through Ama no Tobira, only then will you enter the Sky Realm of Amahara.<br>
Presently, Ladies Yamato, Musashi, and Shinano are all in Amahara. The ritual they are preparing is meant to expand the Sky Realm.<br>
Lady Yamato has poured years of blood and sweat into Amahara, and she hopes that you will participate in the expansion ceremony and experience this thing that she has put so much work into.<br>
She will then discuss future plans with you once that is done.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Sky Realm... Amahara?!<br>
<span style="color:#fef15e;">？？？?：</span><br>
You were drawn to Amahara, weren't you?<br>
Just leave... Don't come closer.<br>
Don't stay here, and don't enter Amahara...<br>
This place is no paradise... It's merely a grave. A grave made of lies and falsehoods!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Unzen：</span><br>
...Commander? Are you alright?<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
I'm fine. I just... Had a moment for a sec there.<br>
<br>
I shook my head and shook off the inexplicable chill I suddenly felt.<br>
Following that, Unzen and I spoke of various things. From the Sakura Empire, to her own story.<br>
Akagi behaved politely the whole way through, but a faint chill emanated from her constantly.<br>
Hakuhou and Asama, meanwhile, hardly added anything to the conversation, preferring to simply observe – observe me, especially.<br>
Whenever I asked Akagi something, her response was simply a silent refusal. It was like she was signaling that now was not the time.<br>
Finally, our meal came to an end.<br>
I reunited with Helena, and we got on a cloud with our hosts, and then set off to the boundary line of Ama no Tobira.<br>

<br>
Our cloud set forth once more.<br>
This time, the Sakurans didn't jump onto any other clouds, and as a result, our momentum wasn't nearly the same as it was before.<br>
Instead, the shipgirls and I rode the little cloud and flew quietly and steadily.<br>
That was, until I was suddenly hit with the sensation that we'd entered an open space.<br>
Despite the surroundings not changing much, I could sense it – we had gone into a space that was new.<br>
Once I became conscious of it, my surroundings took on a whole new look.<br>
The palaces that appear before us are far beyond everything we'd seen before, both in scale and majesty.<br>
They float on top of a veritable sea of clouds, as do the mountains, rivers, greenery, and trees.<br>
If one were to liken Ama no Tobira to a city above the clouds, then it'd be no exaggeration to say this is a fantasy land in the clouds.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Hakuhou：</span><br>
Commander {playername}, Helena, we have now arrived in the Sky Realm of Amahara.<br>
Oh? It seems that you already noticed this before I pointed it out, Commander.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Helena：</span><br>
This is the Sky Realm?<br>
I've not seen anything this wondrous even in my dreams...<br>
Wait, Hakuhou just implied you saw it before I did. Have you, Commander?<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
You need to be aware of it before you can see it. It's a typical trait of higher-dimensional spaces.<br>
Hakuhou pointed it out to make you see it as well.<br>
I simply noticed the transition into a new space before you did.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Helena：</span><br>
Ohh. So this place is different from Ama no Tobira, where we just were.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Yeah. It's a bigger space than Ama no Tobira. It's in a higher dimension, too.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Hakuhou：</span><br>
As expected, your perception is markedly keen.<br>
Ama no Tobira was always made to be the entrance to the Sky Realm. Although it was designed to be as spacious as could be, it's still no more than what its name suggests in our language – a door to heaven.<br>
The grand Sky Realm is different, however. It is a domain that floats above our earthly world.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Unzen：</span><br>
I might add that, although this place was beautiful when I first arrived, it was by no means as vast as what you behold now.<br>
It was developed piece by piece until it finally became worthy of its name.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Hakuhou：</span><br>
She is right. Moreover, the Sky Realm still holds further potential. Its size and splendor increase day after day.<br>
One might say that it quite literally experiences daily growth.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Wasn't always this way, huh... Did that change after the Naraka incident?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Hakuhou：</span><br>
Oh? How did you deduce that?<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
The Dragon Palace was modified after it happened. Ama no Tobira was closed for a long time before that.<br>
Wasn't your group called in to expand this place, I-404?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">I-404：</span><br>
No, we can't do that. We've mostly been going on patrols to minimize risks.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Then who's been expanding it?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Hakuhou：</span><br>
Would you care to guess?<br>
Ah, let's not make it too broad. Hmm... Let us limit it to the people around you.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
People around me, huh...<br>
Well, I can safely exclude myself, Helena, and those three. That leaves you, Unzen, Akagi, and Asama.<br>
(I've excluded everyone else, so it can only be the four people I sat down with.)<br>
(Then there's Akagi, who's been in a sour mood this whole time. Maybe that's because...)<br>
It's Unzen, Asama, and Hakuhou.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Akagi：</span><br>
......<br>
You're forgetting someone.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
No, I really think it's just those three.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Akagi：</span><br>
Commander, are you excluding me on purpose?<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
You've seemed a bit grumpy, so I just thought... You know.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Akagi：</span><br>
Please, I'm not grumpy because of you. Don't overthink things.<br>
<br>
Akagi gazes into the depths of the clouds, then neatly puts the topic to rest.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Hakuhou：</span><br>
Wow, you guessed it on your first try. Heehee. I'm starting to develop some respect for you, Commander.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Akagi：</span><br>
Hmph...<br>
{{折叠面板|内容结束}}

{{折叠面板|标题=Dream Stones|选项=6|主框=1|样式=primary|展开=是}}
<br>
Before I know it, our cloud has landed in a courtyard that smells of wine.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Hakuhou：</span><br>
Commander, kindly wait here for a while.<br>
We need to make just a few small preparations to carry out our daily task of expanding Amahara.<br>
Oumi. Oumi! The Commander has arrived. Is a Dream Stone ready for use?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Oumi：</span><br>
Ugh... That time already? Okay, wait just a moment.<br>
<br>
A while later, a girl wearing an elegant dress yet with a languid expression appears, riding a warship with a peculiar shape.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Is that... a bottle gourd?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Oumi：</span><br>
Indeed. I'm Oumi. It's an honor to meet you, Commander {playername}.<br>
Heehee – are you curious about my wine gourd?<br>
Then can I interest you in this fine Cloudsea Wine?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Hakuhou：</span><br>
Save the wine for later. More importantly, have you tuned a Dream Stone?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Oumi：</span><br>
Yes, yes, it's been successfully tuned. Everyone, if I may have your attention...<br>
<br>
Oumi flaps her sleeves, and an ash-grey stone the size of a billiard ball appears in the air.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Hakuhou：</span><br>
This is a Dream Stone, Commander. As its name suggests, it's the cornerstone that builds up the dreamlike Sky Realm.<br>
Since you could intuit the difference between the Sky Realm and Ama no Tobira, I suggest you closely examine the Stone. I think you'll sense something.<br>
<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项1：(Stare at the Dream Stone.)</span>'''''<br>
<br>
I stare intently at it, and before I know it, the grey ball turns into a transparent bubble.<br>
There are small clouds drifting inside the bubble, with even smaller buildings and mountains inside those clouds. It's like looking at a miniature of the Sky Realm.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Hakuhou：</span><br>
What you just saw is the essence of a Dream Stone.<br>
It is a precious thing – a higher dimension, compressed and purified, and modified into perfection.<br>
Whoever wields it can use their imagination to tap into its potential, and transform the space as though they're building a dream.<br>
This is the process with which we've rapidly expanded the Sky Realm.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Akagi：</span><br>
And what a bizarre new way to build it is.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
("New way to build"?)<br>
<br>
BZZZT...<br>
<span style="color:#ffc960;">Helena META：</span><br>
(It took a while to get us synchronized without anyone noticing, but now we have a stable two-way line.)<br>
(Where are you now, Commander? Is your reception over?)<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
(Yeah, it's done. I've  left Ama no Tobira and I'm now in Amahara.)<br>
(Yamato invited me to see what it's like to build in this place. She wants to discuss something important after that's done.)<br>
<span style="color:#ffc960;">Helena META：</span><br>
(Amahara, I see... I know that place. My world's Yamato worked pretty hard on it in secret.)<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
(Does this Amahara have anything to do with the one I heard mentioned in my nightmare?)<br>
<span style="color:#ffc960;">Helena META：</span><br>
(Still haven't forgotten that nightmare, huh? Well, don't worry. Test site beta's Amahara is, at its core, a cognitive defense system built by Yamato.)<br>
(Although it's deeply linked to the Amahara you dreamed of, it's a completely different kind of technology. For all intents and purposes, they just share a name.)<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
(Know anything about a Dream Stone? Is it related to the Watatsumi?)<br>
<span style="color:#ffc960;">Helena META：</span><br>
(Come again? Dream Stone? What's that?)<br>
<br>
I explain it as best as I can to Helena, based on what Hakuhou just told me.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
(Remember when Elizabeth META used Alsace and the concept of death to anchor space, and create the Martyrium? Doesn't it work the same as that?)<br>
<span style="color:#ffc960;">Helena META：</span><br>
(It does. Not just that, it's also a more advanced version of that.)<br>
(It not only utilizes concepts, but it even creates a set of concepts that belong specifically to Amahara.)<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
(A more advanced version? Is Yamato just that powerful?)<br>
<span style="color:#ffc960;">Helena META：</span><br>
(She's not supposed to be THIS powerful.)<br>
(When I did some research earlier, I found that Yamato didn't use this method to build Amahara.)<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
(Oh yeah, Akagi did just say that this is a NEW way to build.)<br>
(Considering Amahara didn't grow to this size until after the Naraka incident, it follows that the Dream Stones didn't come in use until after the incident as well.)<br>
<span style="color:#ffc960;">Helena META：</span><br>
(I think these "Dream Stones" could very well have something to do with the meteorite sample.)<br>
(I'll ask Jintsuu about it. Talk to you later.)<br>
<br>
Helena hangs up, and I, Hakuhou, and the rest start heading for the next stop on this trip to experience the Sky Realm's growth.<br>

<br>
The sea of clouds rolls, and we arrive in a new area.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Oumi：</span><br>
What do you see, {playername}?<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Nothing. Just clouds, clouds, and more clouds.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Oumi：</span><br>
Heehee. Why don't you take a closer look?<br>
<br>
Oumi presses the Dream Stone against her forehead.<br>
The Stone disappears like a popped bubble, and the scenery all around us changes in an instant.<br>
I'm inside a pagoda, sitting in front of a table. Past the balcony, I see an ocean of water that stretches on endlessly.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Oumi：</span><br>
What do you see now?<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
A castle, and an ocean... Did you use the Stone to make this?<br>
I thought the only sea you could make in this place was a sea of clouds.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Oumi：</span><br>
Heehee. Well, as you can tell, that's not all you can make.<br>
It only looked like a bunch of clouds because we were going somewhere.<br>
When moving from place to place in Amahara, of course you'll see nothing but clouds.<br>
Now, though, we're exploring all of its little nooks and crannies.<br>
And since we're exploring, there needs to be something new to see.<br>
Also, that's not strictly an ocean, but rather a lake.<br>
For various reasons, a single Dream Stone can only create so much space. What you see now is the upper limit.<br>
This place works a lot like a dream, you see. The bigger it gets, the more uncertain it gets, and the effort required to stabilize and explore it grows exponentially.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
So it's fluid similarly to how dreams are. Does it get affected by negative emotions?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Oumi：</span><br>
Don't worry about that. Negative emotions are suppressed thanks to the magic circles placed all around Amahara.<br>
You won't find any nightmarish monsters wreaking havoc in here.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
(That's good. Yamato planned ahead for that.)<br>
(The last thing I want is to see that fear I felt take shape again.)<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Unzen：</span><br>
Now, then, what do you all say to some Cloudsea Wine?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Hakuhou：</span><br>
That sounds superb. Pour some for me.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Oumi：</span><br>
Just a moment! Let me get it ready for you.<br>
<br>
Oumi lightly strikes her gourd, and liquid starts pouring out of it in a helical shape, filling the cups on the table to the brim.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Hakuhou：</span><br>
Lady Yamato created this Cloudsea Wine to help visitors to the Sky Realm better adapt to its environment.<br>
Those who drink it are formally acknowledged as guests here, and they receive the blessing of the Amahara Taijin – the Great Ring of Amahara.<br>
You will also receive an additional boon shortly after drinking the Wine itself.<br>
Whether traveling, working, or using a Dream Stone to create space in Amahara, you'll find that it's much easier than usual.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
(Can it really do that?)<br>
<span style="color:#ffc960;">Helena META：</span><br>
(It's just a registration and tuning process.)<br>
<br>
Once more, I hear Helena META's voice through our secret line of communication.<br>
<span style="color:#ffc960;">Helena META：</span><br>
(It's another classic example of presentation in Sakuran technology.)<br>
(Amahara's administrator made drinking Cloudsea Wine into a registration and authentication process.)<br>
(They need you to register an account first before you can expand Amahara's space – in other words, to edit or add to it.)<br>
(As for the part about better adapting to the environment, that's a form of tuning.)<br>
(It doesn't need to be a particular drink for it to work. What matters is that it's wine, and the aforementioned act of drinking itself. It's strictly symbolic.)<br>
(If I were the admin, I think I'd make it soda instead.)<br>
(The principle behind this part is pretty complicated, so I'll spare you the details. You understand the idea behind this better after I explained it, right?)<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
(Yeah. I understand it now, thanks to your layman's translation. By the way, did you finish looking into the Dream Stones?)<br>
<span style="color:#ffc960;">Helena META：</span><br>
(Not yet. I just came back to check on you since you were on my mind.)<br>
(Based on my preliminary findings, this does seem like an advanced use of the Watatsumi.)<br>
(There's a degree of risk in the technology itself, which rises and falls depending on the creator's skill.)<br>
(When you get a Dream Stone, don't use it immediately. I want to analyze it first.)<br>
(I'm really curious as to how Yamato got her hands on this technology...)<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Hakuhou：</span><br>
Is something the matter, Commander? If you have any questions, don't be afraid to ask. I hope to answer them all.<br>
<span style="color:#ffc960;">Helena META：</span><br>
(Oh, right. Our times are fully synchronized now.)<br>
(To other people, it looks like you've just been staring into space this whole time, so...)<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Ahem... No, it's nothing. I just got lost in the beauty of this view.<br>
Without further ado, let's drink.<br>
<br>
Unhesitatingly, I drink all the wine in my cup.<br>
It has a refreshing sweetness to it, with a distinct floral and fruity aroma.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
It has a refreshing sweetness to it, with a distinct floral and fruity aroma.<br>
(...What?)<br>
<br>
For a moment, I get a strange sense of déjà vu – like this isn't my first time drinking this wine.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
(That's so weird. Didn't Helena say this wine is just a symbolic thing?)<br>
(Then why does this space... suddenly look clearer than it did a moment ago?)<br>
(And why did I suddenly get that feeling like I've done this before?)<br>
{{折叠面板|内容结束}}

{{折叠面板|标题=Weaving Dreams|选项=8|主框=1|样式=primary|展开=是}}
<br>
After we drink the Cloudsea Wine, Oumi and I-404's group say goodbye, and they return to their respective posts.<br>
Helena and I follow Unzen, and we go to another open place in the Cloudsea.<br>
I suppose they have something else they want to show me before I go and create some space with my own hands.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Asama：</span><br>
Now, allow me to present an example.<br>
<br>
Asama presses the Dream Stone against her forehead.<br>
The Stone disappears like a popped bubble, and the scenery all around us changes in an instant.<br>
I find myself in a decayed place. It's dark, and everything is in ruins.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Asama：</span><br>
The Dream Stones create dreams that are a reflection of what's in your mind.<br>
If the dreamer cannot vividly picture the scene they desire, and all they have is a vague idea, the Dream Stone will create a space such as this.<br>
Moreover, if their thoughts are too negative, or if they succumb to panic and fear...<br>
Then the Amahara Taijin's suppressive and filtering effects will intervene, resulting in the Dream Stone fabricating a shapeless, chaotic space much like this.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
(That's smart. Prevents out-of-control emotions from creating something terrifying.)<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Unzen：</span><br>
There are two ways of dealing with orderless spaces of this nature.<br>
The first is to borrow the power of the magic circles deployed around Amahara to thoroughly erase the space.<br>
This method is quite convenient, though it is akin to using a sledgehammer to crack a nut.<br>
For this reason, there exists a second method – disassembling the space to use it as material for another dream.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Akagi：</span><br>
The Commander must be getting bored with all this explaining.<br>
As they say, show, don't tell. Allow me.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Unzen：</span><br>
By all means.<br>
<br>
Akagi turns to face a certain direction in the chaotic space.<br>
She takes one step forward, and the world changes in response.<br>
I'm walking through a field of red spider lilies in full bloom. The sun is setting on the horizon, dyeing the sky an orangish red color.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Is this... the world inside your mind?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Akagi：</span><br>
It's simply what I'm thinking about at the moment.<br>
How do you like it?<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
It's beautiful. Like a painting, with this sea of flowers stretching to the horizon.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Akagi：</span><br>
I'm glad to hear that. I planted a real one, too. Kaga is looking after it.<br>
When we get the chance, perhaps we can admire it together...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Unzen：</span><br>
Commander {playername}, please direct your attention to me.<br>
<br>
Unzen chooses a different direction.<br>
She steadies her breathing, then draws her sword with force.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Unzen：</span><br>
Take my mind's image... and let it manifest!<br>
<br>
Clear rivers, a bright blue sky, vivid greenery, and cherry-pink crystals.<br>
It's a dreamlike view unlike anything in reality or the Cloudsea.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Unzen：</span><br>
This is the landscape the Prime Sakura presides over in its calm state.<br>
I've spent a long, long time in that place...<br>
Although you cannot enter this landscape in reality, the Dream Stones allow me to introduce you to it in this fashion.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Hakuhou：</span><br>
Now comes my turn to create.<br>
<br>
Hakuhou steps into what little remains of the chaotic space.<br>
She kneels down and touches the earth with her fingers.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Hakuhou：</span><br>
O white phoenix, soar across the world in my stead.<br>
<br>
The Cloudsea surges forth, and from it rises a phoenix of white to dance lightly with its long tail.<br>
I can even hear its clear cry resounding in my ears.<br>
The chaos has all disappeared, replaced by three differing landscapes that come together into a single world.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Helena：</span><br>
I can't believe my eyes...<br>
It's beautiful. So beautiful that I don't know how else to describe it.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Yeah. I didn't expect such magical things to be possible here.<br>
It's like watching gods weave a world together.<br>
<span style="color:#ffc960;">Helena META：</span><br>
(Heh. It's fine for her to be moved – but you? Why are you moved?)<br>
(So what if they showed you some slightly pretty landscapes? Don't let it make you biased.)<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
(This is more than just "slightly" pretty.)<br>
<span style="color:#ffc960;">Helena META：</span><br>
(No, it isn't.)<br>
(The Tower can do the same thing, only much better. Why not come see it sometime? It'll be fun.)<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
(Doing something "fun" with the Tower? Can't say I'm not interested.)<br>
<span style="color:#ffc960;">Helena META：</span><br>
(It's a promise, then.)<br>
(Hey, remember to keep your emotions in check. Try to stay calm, okay?)<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
(I'm calm, I'm calm...)<br>
<span style="color:#ffc960;">Helena META：</span><br>
(Nicely done. Now, back to work for me.)<br>
{{折叠面板|内容结束}}

<br>
After leaving behind the trisected world, we arrive in an empty Cloudsea.<br>
Now, it's time for me to try it.<br>
I take a Dream Stone in hand and press it softly against my forehead.<br>
In a blink, the world is transformed.<br>
I'm aboard a ship that's gently rocking in a calm sea. The sun's rays are gentle, and the breeze is pleasant.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
(I saw something for a moment there... What was that?)<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Helena：</span><br>
Ah, you created an ocean!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Hakuhou：</span><br>
As there is a limit on how much space a Dream Stone can create, it would be more apt to call it a slice of an ocean.<br>
At any rate, it suits someone with as deep a connection to the sea, Commander.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Wasn't actually expecting it to be a calm sea... At least it's not a mountain of paperwork.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Akagi：</span><br>
Pardon – paperwork?<br>
It seems the Orthodoxy's meeting venue has left as much of an impression on you as the battlefield has.<br>
What did your mind picture before you touched the Stone? Surely it wasn't just the sea.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
You're right. What I envisioned was "peace."<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Unzen：</span><br>
Peace...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Asama：</span><br>
Peace, you say...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Akagi：</span><br>
......<br>
Even after we achieve peace, will you still spend every day at sea?<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
You know, honestly, even I'm not sure. That's why I was curious to see what the Stone would make of "peace."<br>
As it turns out, peace is a blue sea.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Hakuhou：</span><br>
The Dream Stones are fascinating things. They can create beautiful landscapes even out of abstract concepts.<br>
If only you could diversify your thinking, and formulate something untethered by the laws of physics or the constraints of reality...<br>
Then the Dream Stone could show you something more surprising.<br>
Commander {playername}, would you like to give it another try?<br>

<br>
I'm given another Dream Stone.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
(Diversify my thinking, eh...)<br>
(Let's see if I can mix it up a bit...)<br>
<br>
I gently press the Dream Stone against my forehead.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">？？？?：</span><br>
In a blink, the world is transformed.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
(Huh?!)<br>
(What the hell?! That definitely wasn't my imagination!)<br>
(It was that black figure again!)<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Hakuhou：</span><br>
What's this? An archipelago in the Pacific Ocean?<br>
What kind of space did you envision this time as you touched the Dream Stone?<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
A big, Sakuran place.<br>
What can I say? It's where we're vacationing, and I tried to expand my thinking a bit, like you said.<br>
Did I do something wrong?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Hakuhou：</span><br>
This space seems... too big.<br>
Unzen, can you sense it?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Unzen：</span><br>
I'm... unable to measure its width or depth.<br>
This is not a slice of an ocean. It is veritably a whole ocean.<br>
With dozens of islands poking above the water.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Hakuhou：</span><br>
Wouldn't that make it... many times larger than the combined size of the entire Sky Realm?<br>
That's simply unbelievable... All this, from but one Dream Stone?<br>
A Dream Stone contains a limited amount of information. How did a single one manage to create a space this big?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Unzen：</span><br>
I do not know. However, the boundaries of this space seem to be unstable.<br>
It is constantly changing out of our sight. I can sense it.<br>
What's more, the changes happen increasingly faster the further away they are.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
(What? The world outside our view is changing without my input?)<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Akagi：</span><br>
Then what are we standing around for? We need to get out of here immediately.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Hakuhou：</span><br>
Everyone, please stay where you are. I will get us out of here now.<br>
<br>
The clouds flow away, and our surroundings change entirely. Despite this, we're still in the vast ocean.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Hakuhou：</span><br>
That's odd... We're still in here.<br>
Oumi, we have an emergency. I need you to...<br>
......<br>
Unzen, we have lost contact with the outside!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Unzen：</span><br>
Please, calm down.<br>
Kindly hold on a moment. I will see if I can sense something.<br>
<br>
Unzen closes her eyes, and light shines forth from her body, then scatters in all directions.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
(This is getting a bit dire, let's say that.)<br>
(Helena, do you read me?)<br>
(Hello? Helena?)<br>
<span style="color:#ffc960;">Helena META：</span><br>
(Don't worry. I'm here.)<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
(Thank god. I thought I lost contact with you, too.)<br>
<span style="color:#ffc960;">Helena META：</span><br>
(In truth, you did – for a brief moment.)<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
(So whatever just happened also affected you, then?)<br>
<span style="color:#ffc960;">Helena META：</span><br>
(More precisely, there was a drastic change in the rules of that space.)<br>
(I could at least tell that you were still in the Sky Realm since your coordinate field didn't update.)<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
(Wait, a drastic change of rules?)<br>
<span style="color:#ffc960;">Helena META：</span><br>
(Look at the sun. It's setting. Time has begun ticking.)<br>
<br>
Just as Helena says, the previously blue sky has all of a sudden taken on a golden orange color.<br>
The girls realize this at the same time as I do.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Hakuhou：</span><br>
This is wrong. This is wrong for so many reasons.<br>
The space created by the Dream Stone behaves unnaturally, and most unnatural of all is the one thing that should never change in here – the time.<br>
Commander, did you... change the very essence of your Dream Stone?<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
No, I just put it against my forehead. I didn't do anything unusual.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Hakuhou：</span><br>
Right, of course you didn't... You can't just change the essence of the Dream Stone like that, after all.<br>
If one did that, it would no longer be a Dream Stone. The Amahara Taijin would identify it as a foreign object and suppress it.<br>
But then, what happened?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Unzen：</span><br>
I've deduced the cause.<br>
The space itself has become unstable. That's why we can't escape through regular means or contact the outside.<br>
I've regained contact with the Amahara Taijin. Please stay put and do not move.<br>
There – I've established a stable passage. Follow me, and I will lead you out!<br>

<br>
The shipgirls and I experience faint vibrations for a while, then we return to the golden Cloudsea once more.<br>
This place is so tranquil that it's like the danger we were just in wasn't real to begin with.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Hakuhou：</span><br>
Phew...<br>
Commander, I just employed the Amahara Taijin to erase the space we were just in.<br>
This only happened because the ladies and I were unprepared.<br>
On all our behalves, I deeply apologize for the discomfort caused.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
It was weird, for sure, but it didn't necessarily happen because you were unprepared...<br>
(There was that black figure... I only saw her while using the Dream Stone.)<br>
All's well that ends well. We all made it out unscathed, so don't sweat it.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Asama：</span><br>
Your forgiveness is deeply appreciated.<br>
Hakuhou, I suggest that we suspend the use of Dream Stones for the time being.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Akagi：</span><br>
Not just that, we should not even think of using them until we've figured out what the problem was.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Asama：</span><br>
A wise proposal. Let us do as you say.<br>
Furthermore, Hakuhou, you ought to tell others that all expansion work involving the Stones is suspended.<br>
I shall inform Lady Yamato of this incident at a later time.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Hakuhou：</span><br>
As you say, Asama...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Akagi：</span><br>
One thing's for sure: Our plans for today's visit have fallen apart. Mind if I come up with something new?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Asama：</span><br>
Let's hear it.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Akagi：</span><br>
Well, the landscapes of the Five Provinces and Seven Districts are now 40% complete.<br>
Since the Commander is with us, why don't we go and enjoy some superb views, hmm?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Asama：</span><br>
That sounds like a good idea. Do you have any particular spots in mind?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Akagi：</span><br>
How about Kouzuke Province?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Asama：</span><br>
We have the same idea. Yes, let us go to Kouzuke Province.<br>
<br>
The up-to-now cold and distant Akagi has finally livened up, and jovially begins talking with the other girls about the sightseeing we're about to do.<br>
I, on the other hand, feel restless.<br>
My mind is still preoccupied with the black figure I saw when I touched the Dream Stone, as well as that odd nightmare I had a few days ago.<br>
And that bizarre thing that just happened to us – did we really escape, and that's all there's to it?<br>
The next moment, dark clouds cover the sky.<br>
Just like that, the hereto fantastically beautiful Sky Realm is shrouded in unyielding darkness.<br>

<br>
Meanwhile, in the court of Amahara Castle...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Musashi：</span><br>
Ladies, an emergency has arisen. Formless corruption has invaded the Sky Realm en masse.<br>
I know neither whence they came nor how they slipped past the external walls. However, I know one thing...<br>
That their rampage shan't be allowed to continue.<br>
I have already deployed defensive magic circles across the Sky Realm. Izumo?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Izumo：</span><br>
Yes, ma'am?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Musashi：</span><br>
I will head out and destroy the source of this formless corruption. The defense of the castle, I entrust to you.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Izumo：</span><br>
Understood, ma'am.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Musashi：</span><br>
Azuma, Kitakaze, you are to lead our forces across the Five Provinces and Seven Districts and eliminate the enemy.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Azuma & Kitakaze：</span><br>
- As you wish.  - Roger!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Musashi：</span><br>
Ikazuchi, Inazuma, summon Shimanto and Daisen hither. Inform them that war has come to Amahara.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ikazuchi：</span><br>
Understood, ma'am.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Inazuma：</span><br>
We'll see to it.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Musashi：</span><br>
Ibuki, head to the Amahara Cloudsea and crush the enemy, then accompany the aforementioned two to Ama no Tobira to maintain it.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ibuki：</span><br>
As you've bidden, so shall it be done!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Musashi：</span><br>
Lastly, I-404.<br>
Unzen's group is bringing the Commander to Amahara Castle. In the name of utmost safety, take your forces and rendezvous with them.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">I-404：</span><br>
Copy that! Don't worry, Musashi – I'll bring the Commander back safely if it's the last thing I do!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Musashi：</span><br>
As long as each of you carries out your duty, our victory is assured.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Everyone：</span><br>
Yes, ma'am!<br>

<span style="color:#c3abff;">Jintsuu META：</span><br>
...The importance of cognitive defense was realized in the wake of the Spectral Moon incident.<br>
The Sky Realm of Amahara, as a project, was devised for that very purpose.<br>
I didn't expect it to end like it did...<br>
<br>
A group was having a casual conversation within a garden surrounded by stars.<br>
That was until their chat was disrupted by a flashing, red word appearing in the air – WARNING.<br>
<span style="color:#c3abff;">Jintsuu META：</span><br>
Why are there alarms going off even here? Did something happen?<br>
<span style="color:#ffc960;">Helena META：</span><br>
Yeah.<br>
Helena's gone into battle. Something's gone seriously wrong in the Sky Realm.<br>
<span style="color:#c3abff;">Memphis META：</span><br>
Helena, has the Commander gotten into trouble?! That warning in the sky sure suggests it!<br>
<span style="color:#ffc960;">Helena META：</span><br>
Perfect timing, Memphis. Tell Vestal and Arizona to get ready for dispatch.<br>
<span style="color:#c3abff;">Memphis META：</span><br>
What? I mean, okay!<br>
<span style="color:#c3abff;">Jintsuu META：</span><br>
Are you sure we shouldn't depart immediately?<br>
<span style="color:#ffc960;">Helena META：</span><br>
It's fine. The situation isn't that bad.<br>
Still, I'm preparing for it to get worse. There's too much new stuff today, and I don't like it.<br>
<span style="color:#c3abff;">Jintsuu META：</span><br>
I understand. A lot of first-time things for you today.<br>
While I haven't seen these "Dream Stones" before, this series of events today does invoke a sense of déjà vu in me.<br>
I have no evidence for this, but I feel like Amahara went into a different direction as soon as the stones appeared.<br>
<span style="color:#ffc960;">Helena META：</span><br>
What do you mean by "a different direction"?<br>
<span style="color:#c3abff;">Jintsuu META：</span><br>
Perhaps it's more apt to say that it has gone off-course.<br>
What is clear is that someone unrelated has become involved in Amahara's growth.<br>
Moreover, this person... surely knows about what happened in the past.<br>
<span style="color:#ffc960;">Helena META：</span><br>
I see...<br>
Keep monitoring, Jintsuu. Let me know if you discover anything.<br>
I'm gonna go make some adjustments to Rodney.<br>
I will get to the bottom of who's plotting in the shadows here.<br>

<span style="color:#fef15e;">？？？?：</span><br>
You mustn't go into Amahara...<br>
It's a grave. A grave made of lies and falsehoods...<br>
A prison that is completely sealed...<br>
None can escape it...<br>
<br>
"None can escape it."<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Hakuhou：</span><br>
...Asama! Unzen!<br>
There is an alert from the Amahara Taijin! Invaders have appeared in the Sky Realm!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Asama：</span><br>
Invaders?<br>
How is it possible that they snuck through the Amahara Taijin?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Akagi：</span><br>
We'll have to figure that out another time! This place is dangerous. We need to return to Amahara Castle at once.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Unzen：</span><br>
It's the corruption...<br>
It is already here...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Hakuhou：</span><br>
What?! Here?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Akagi：</span><br>
Tsk... Then we'll intercept! Don't let the enemy come close!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Helena：</span><br>
I'll deploy a mass-produced ship at once. Commander, get on.<br>
...Commander?<br>
<br>
"None can escape it."<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Helena：</span><br>
...Commander! Are you okay?<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
I'm...<br>
I'm fine. Getting on now.<br>
<br>
<br>
KABOOOM!<br>
Fragments of nightmares, formless corruption, corrosion entities... They may look different, but they're the same at their core.<br>
The Cloudsea is as black as the night. It takes all our might to carve out a path through the black waves.<br>
They aren't much of a threat beyond having numbers on their side.<br>
Those numbers are precisely the issue, however.<br>
We dispose of one after another, but however many we destroy, they always regroup in unseen nooks and attack us again.<br>
"Like a fear that grows in the dark."<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Hakuhou：</span><br>
Unzen, is this the corruption you spoke of? This horde is endless, and we cannot hope to defeat all of them ourselves.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Unzen：</span><br>
The ones we've defeated are but shadows. They will assail us endlessly until their source is removed.<br>
Please focus not on slaying them, but on clearing a path instead. We must reach Amahara Castle as soon as possible.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Hakuhou：</span><br>
Understood!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Akagi：</span><br>
Be careful. Something even bigger is coming.<br>
<span style="color:#bdbdbd;">???：</span><br>
▂▃▆▂▃▆▇▂▃▇█▆▆▇▇▆▇<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Asama：</span><br>
Is that... a black dragon?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Unzen：</span><br>
It bodes ill that such a wicked creature comes so soon...<br>
We must fall back! This enemy is not like the rest. I shall cut it down!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">I-404：</span><br>
Unzen! Minase, Taekaze, and I are here!<br>
We'll take it from here! Take Commander {playername} and go to Amahara Castle!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Unzen：</span><br>
Command your seadrake to strangle this vile enemy.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">I-404：</span><br>
Hmph. Got it!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Unzen：</span><br>
Alright, the rest of us need to keep moving.<br>
<br>
<span style="color:#bdbdbd;">???：</span><br>
▂▃▆▂▃▆▇▂▃▇█▆▆▇▇▆▇<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Minase：</span><br>
This dragon isn't like the formless corruption we've seen so far...<br>
How do I describe it? It's like it's more solid, more agile.<br>
It's almost like it has a will of its own.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Taekaze：</span><br>
You can tell it's strong just from looking at it. Can we really handle it by ourselves?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">I-404：</span><br>
Heh! Sure we can! Kotama and I are pretty strong, too!<br>
We've just been stuck doing repair work lately, and haven't had a chance to flaunt our true strength!<br>
You two, put pressure on it from the sides. I'll take care of the rest!<br>
Kotama, it's time to dance! May its body be pierced into a bottomless abyss!<br>

<br>
Thanks to I-404's group covering us, we managed to cover a lot of ground in a short time.<br>
With Unzen constantly looking for shortcuts amidst the chaos, we finally broke through the dark tide and made it to the heart of the Sky Realm – Amahara Castle.<br>
However, the safety we expected to find wasn't there.<br>
The castle has been breached despite the many magic circles around it, with many of its buildings having been stained and turned black.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Hakuhou：</span><br>
They've breached Amahara Castle's perimeter!<br>
How is that possible?! The foes we fought en route weren't especially mighty, so they shouldn't have been able to penetrate the defenses regardless of how numerous they were!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Asama：</span><br>
Amahara has fallen... What a horrific sight...<br>
<br>
KABOOOM!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Izumo：</span><br>
There you are, Unzen. Come this way.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Unzen：</span><br>
Izumo, what in the world is happening?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Izumo：</span><br>
Somehow, the enemy slipped past the barrier and made it inside the castle. They caught us off guard.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Unzen：</span><br>
Pardon? They even slipped past the castle's barrier?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Izumo：</span><br>
Yeah... So we fortified our defenses, and concentrated our forces and magic circles around the third main palace, where the Venerable Three are.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Hakuhou：</span><br>
It's been this long, and the Venerable Three still have yet to resolve the situation?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Izumo：</span><br>
The situation's not so straightforward.<br>
They've already erased the source of the corruption twice, but both times, another source sprang up.<br>
It's suspected the problem lies in the Depths.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Unzen：</span><br>
The Depths... Is there such a place within the Sky Realm?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Akagi：</span><br>
The Dream Stones. They're collected from the Depths, no?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Unzen：</span><br>
The Dream Stones...<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
(Sounds like the Sakurans are in a bit of a stalemate.)<br>
(I knew the formless corruption's appearance was only the beginning. Of course things wouldn't be so simple...)<br>
(Helena, have you figured out the cause yet?)<br>
<span style="color:#ffc960;">Helena META：</span><br>
(Still working on it. There are so many things I can't explain with this attack.)<br>
(They're right about one thing, though – that the source is in the Depths.)<br>
(Don't be alarmed. A rescue team is standing by. If things get completely out of control, we'll jump in and pull at least you and Helena out of there.)<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
(Try to save them, too, if you can.)<br>
<span style="color:#ffc960;">Helena META：</span><br>
(We'll try.)<br>
<br>
Sometime later, Izumo escorts me and the other Sakurans to a part of the castle that was still intact.<br>
Although the black tide bangs on the barrier outside, this is as far as they can get.<br>
So, I relax a bit and decide to restore my strength for the battle of attrition that's sure to come.<br>
I gaze at the cloud that hangs at the castle's peak like the sun.<br>
As my mind wanders, it feels like I'm looking at an even bigger space.<br>
In a black void, a woman in colorful clothing stares at several picture scrolls unfolded before her eyes.<br>
The one end of the scrolls hovers beside her hand, while the other stretches on endlessly into the distance.<br>
<span style="color:#bdbdbd;">Houshou META：</span><br>
I've found it...<br>
That is where the calamity's source lies...<br>
<br>
Her eyes fixate on one of the scrolls – and so do the countless other gazes amidst the nothingness.<br>
<span style="color:#bdbdbd;">Houshou META：</span><br>
Phase shift...<br>
<br>
The scroll then moves as she lifts it not with her hand, but with her eyes.<br>
<span style="color:#bdbdbd;">Houshou META：</span><br>
Now you will be safe...<br>
<br>
With one flick of her gaze, the danger has passed.<br>
Butterflies in three colors flutter between the scrolls while light gradually fills the void.<br>
I stand on a cloud and look up at the sun-like cloud hanging over the castle's peak.<br>
Golden light flows forth, making Amahara Castle look unscathed again.<br>
It's as though that ruthless battle never happened in the first place.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Helena：</span><br>
What? Everything's suddenly... back to normal.<br>
Commander, what's going on?<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Well, I mean–<br>
Yooouuu...<br>
Teeelll...<br>
Meee...?<br>
<br>
My voice becomes slowed and stretched, and my vision becomes fragmented and distorted.<br>
The world instantly dissolves, and an endless void envelops it.<br>

<br>
Bathed in golden light, Amahara Castle appeared unscathed.<br>
However, two people who ought to be there were missing.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Hakuhou：</span><br>
Asama, Unzen... Where are Helena and the Commander?<br>
I blinked for but a moment, and now they've vanished.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Akagi：</span><br>
What is the meaning of this?! Where have they gone?!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Unzen：</span><br>
I cannot sense them, but do not worry. It's possible they've–<br>
<br>
KABOOOM!<br>
A blue torrent tore the golden sky apart, immediately followed by protective magic circles manifesting one after the next.<br>
One moment later, all sorts of floating battleships appeared in the sky above Amahara Castle.<br>
<span style="color:#ffc960;">Helena META：</span><br>
Would someone care to explain what happened to the Commander?<br>
<br>
Another blue torrent appeared and reduced several floating islands to rubble before barely being blocked by several swords made of purple light.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Musashi：</span><br>
A guest though you may be, I suggest you mind your manners.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Shinano ：</span><br>
Please, all – let us be calm...<br>
<span style="color:#c3abff;">Memphis META：</span><br>
You want calm? Okay, then tell us where you hid the Commander.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Hakuhou：</span><br>
We only just became aware that the Commander and Helena have disappeared. How could we be responsible?<br>
Furthermore, who are you people? Why have you barged into Amahara? Are you trying to start a war?!<br>
<span style="color:#c3abff;">Memphis META：</span><br>
The only ones trying to start a war here are YOU people!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Hakuhou：</span><br>
How DARE you!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Akagi：</span><br>
Hakuhou, calm yourself. Let's hear what they have to say.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Hakuhou：</span><br>
But Akagi...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Shinano ：</span><br>
Ahh... Helena.<br>
<span style="color:#ffc960;">Helena META：</span><br>
You don't have to explain yourself, Shinano.<br>
I just discovered that this has nothing to do with you.<br>
It has everything to do with... her.<br>
<br>
Helena META points to the golden cloud hovering in the sky.<br>
<span style="color:#ffc960;">Helena META：</span><br>
DPSS FVB ZOVD FVBYZLSM? VY DVBSK FVB YHAOLY AOHA P LEWVZLK FVB? (Will you show yourself? Or would you rather that I exposed you?)<br>
<span style="color:#bdbdbd;">Houshou META：</span><br>

<br>
An array of gorgeous picture scrolls hung in the sky.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Unzen：</span><br>
Who are you?!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Akagi：</span><br>
Heheh... There was more than meets the eye to the Dream Stones after all.<br>
Tell me, who are you? Where have you hidden the Commander?<br>
<span style="color:#ffc960;">Helena META：</span><br>
FVB ZAPSS KVU'A NYHZW AOL ZPABHAPVU, KV FVB? (You still don't grasp the situation, do you?)<br>
<span style="color:#bdbdbd;">Houshou META：</span><br>
HSS P KPK DHZ HKQBZA AOL ZWHJL WOHZL (All I did was adjust the space phase.)<br>
AOHA JVBSK UVA WVZZPISF THRL H WLYZVU CHUPZO PUAV AOPU HPY (That could not possibly make a person vanish into thin air.)<br>
DOPSZA FVB IYVBNOA HU LUAPYL JVBUJPS BUTHUULK JVTIHA ZXBHKYVU (Whilst you brought an entire Council unmanned combat squadron.)<br>
LEWSHPU FVBYZLSM – DOV HYL FVB? (Explain yourself – who are you?)<br>

<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Akagi：</span><br>
What in the world are they blabbering about?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Hakuhou：</span><br>
I'm afraid I don't know.<br>
<span style="color:#ffc960;">Helena META：</span><br>
*sigh*...<br>
I did a thorough scan. The Commander's still in Amahara.<br>
<span style="color:#bdbdbd;">Houshou META：</span><br>
Where may that be? I cannot sense that one.<br>
<span style="color:#ffc960;">Helena META：</span><br>
The Depths.<br>
PU AOL KLWAOZ, DOPJO DLYLU'A VYPNPUHSSF TLHUA AV LEPZA (In the depths, which weren't originally meant to exist.)<br>
Do you really think you have the situation under control?<br>
<br>
Blue rain began to pour over Amahara.<br>
And the darkness reappeared.<br>
<span style="color:#bdbdbd;">Houshou META：</span><br>
What's happening? Why did the source appear anew?<br>
Could it be related to this... "Commander's" disappearance?<br>
<span style="color:#ffc960;">Helena META：</span><br>
...I thought you were a villain, but no, you're just an idiot.<br>
Arizona, withdraw the fleet. We don't need it anymore.<br>
Memphis, Kasumi, Vestal, stay here and help out.<br>
And Houshou, you will focus single-mindedly on maintaining the Sky Realm's stability.<br>
I'll deal with you later. There are more urgent things that take precedence.<br>
<span style="color:#bdbdbd;">Houshou META：</span><br>
And what are you going to do?<br>
<span style="color:#ffc960;">Helena META：</span><br>
The thing that none of you could do. Find the missing person.<br>

<span style="color:#fef15e;">？？？?：</span><br>
Well? It's not like you imagined, is it?<br>
Amahara isn't just a place of beauty. Darkness and fear lurk under the surface.<br>
Think about it carefully. What does the fear in the depths of your heart look like?<br>
The things you want to avoid, to run from, to forget...<br>
Sooner or later, they will all catch up with you.<br>
The Sky Realm of Amahara is a prison.<br>
Even we, its own creators, are under lock and key inside it.<br>
<br>
It's silent. It's dark.<br>
It's vast. It's endless.<br>
Time and direction seem to have lost all meaning.<br>
My consciousness tears apart, melts, and forms countless, thin branches that scatter through this void that stretches on forever.<br>
At the ends of every little branch, I see it – the end.<br>
Strengthless soldiers, burning tanks, sunken battleships, crumbled towers.<br>
Tsunamis, earthquakes, illusory light, volcanoes, meteors, miasmic mist.<br>
A black storm ravaging the land, a great wall of silver that connects sea and sky...<br>
The branches link with each other, weaving together the entire world.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
The end of the world...<br>
Yes, that's it...<br>
Even if I forget it, I am who I am... and this fear is part of me.<br>
It's always been there, spreading and growing unseen inside of me...<br>
Then, when nobody expected it, it silently came...<br>
<br>
The scenery before me becomes more and more vivid. My consciousness begins to merge with this calamity.<br>
"Welcome to the Sky Realm of Amahara."<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Helena：</span><br>
What is this place?<br>
Commander? Where are you?<br>
Commandeeer!<br>
