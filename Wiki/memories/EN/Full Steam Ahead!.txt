1 First on the Scene<br>
Port - Office<br>
Today was the day I would welcome Shimakaze as my secretary.<br>
I'd heard much about her quirky personality through her friend, Suruga. She said something to the tune of...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Suruga：</span><br>
You're making HER your secretary? Don't get me wrong, she isn't a bad person by any means.<br>
How should I put it... She's just as clever as she is dumb. She's proactive and quick to act, yet she's astonishingly slow-witted.<br>
What I'm trying to say is, please temper your expectations. You'll be dealing with someone who's essentially an overgrown child.<br>
<br>
Shimakaze has a good reputation as a shipgirl with outstanding abilities. Despite this, Suruga was quite critical of her.<br>
The word of the many against the word of her closest friend.<br>
As I watched the minutes tick away while waiting for her to arrive, I wondered whether there was some truth to what Suruga said...<br>
<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项1：Stay sharp, ready to greet her</span>'''''<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项2：Hunker down and get comfortable</span>'''''<br>
<br>
...30 minutes had passed since Shimakaze was meant to show up. I feared for the worst—that she had a case of Akatsuki syndrome.<br>
All of a sudden, the raid siren began blaring. It was the signal that enemy mass-produced ships had appeared in the surrounding waters.<br>
<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项1：Get ready to sortie at once</span>'''''<br>
<br>
I felt guilty about leaving Shimakaze hanging, but I had no choice but to deal with this pressing threat.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Abukuma：</span><br>
Great you could come, Commander. We'll need all the help we can to find them in this thick fog.<br>
<br>
Before we could neutralize the enemy, we had to locate them first. What's more, we had to do it quick, before they could cause any significant damage.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Abukuma：</span><br>
Huh? What's this? I'm picking something up...<br>
<br>
Abukuma had her eyes fixated on her radar. The look of focus on her face turned into one of surprise. What had she picked up?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Abukuma：</span><br>
Oh... It's a friendly signal. Looks like there wasn't any need for us to show up after all. Look!<br>
<br>
I turned to look southwest at what she was pointing at. What I saw caught me by surprise.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">???：</span><br>
Stupid, stupid mass-produced ships! Get back here! I have a very important meeting today, and I don't wanna miss it because of you!<br>
Owwie! You... You can't target my ears! That's cheating! Hmph... Fine, if that's how you want it, then I won't pull my punches either!<br>
<br>
A sweet, yet courageous voice rang out amid the thundering roars of battle. Was it really her...?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Shimakaze：</span><br>
An eye for an eye, a torpedo for a shell! Watch out, because here I come!<br>

Port - Office<br>
Shimakaze came into my office the next morning and wholly devoted herself to her secretarial duties.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Shimakaze：</span><br>
Right... I'll take out the trash while going to check on the laundry, and then return this folder to its storage cabinet in the archives!<br>
<br>
"All at once? I've never seen this level of multitasking before. It's incredible."<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Shimakaze：</span><br>
Heheh! Please, this is all child's play to me! I'd know, because I played with a few destroyers on the way here!<br>
<br>
It pleased me to see her working hard and enjoying herself. There was one thing that was bothering me, though...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Shimakaze：</span><br>
Hmm? You look as if you want to ask me something, Commander.<br>
<br>
"In fact, I do. Did you do the task I gave to you first thing in the morning today?"<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Shimakaze：</span><br>
Erp...<br>
<br>
"I was concerned because I had wanted you to prioritize finishing that task."<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Shimakaze：</span><br>
Right, uhh... Err... The formal report, I presume...?<br>
That's the one, right? For the incident with the mass-produced ships yesterday...<br>
<br>
"Not quite. Thanks to your valiant efforts, we successfully defeated the enemies before they could cause any damage..."<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Shimakaze：</span><br>
Then what is there to explain? It was standard proce– Wait... Is this about how I was late to the meeting yesterday?<br>
<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项1："That's part of it, but not all."</span>'''''<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Shimakaze：</span><br>
Figures...<br>
<br>
"You could have reached me by radio or sent me a message. How come I didn't hear a single word from you yesterday before you went straight into battle?"<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Shimakaze：</span><br>
You are absolutely right, Commander... I should've communicated that I'd found the enemies right away! Forgive me...<br>
<br>
"I hear the sincerity in your voice. Rest assured, you're pardoned. But listen, there's one thing I want to stress here..."<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Shimakaze：</span><br>
Huh...? And what... would that be...?<br>
<br>
"Please, try not to get into any more dangerous situations without notifying me ahead of time."<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Shimakaze：</span><br>
Commander...! I'm honored that you're so concerned with my safety! I'll begin writing my report at once!<br>
<br>
And she did just that, picking up a pen and paper without a moment's delay.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Shimakaze：</span><br>
Aahh! Nooo! I pressed too hard and punctured the paper!<br>
<br>
It was starting to seem like Suruga was more or less right on the money with her appraisal...<br>

Port - Daytime<br>
Shimakaze finished her last task for the day, sat down, and yawned.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Shimakaze：</span><br>
Gosh, writing that report was easily the most taxing thing I did today... That said, I really did pour my heart into it!<br>
<br>
After thanking her for her hard work, I decided to give her a break which she could spend however she wanted.<br>
That wasn't to say I was done with her for today. I just wanted to see Shimakaze in her "natural habitat," so to speak.<br>
And so, I went to look around in order to see what she was up to.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Inazuma：</span><br>
Wow. It's finished already...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Shimakaze：</span><br>
Mhm! Making a kite is easy, you know! All you need is a plastic bag and a bit of string!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ikazuchi：</span><br>
I see, I see! The dev notes did mention that your hobby is collecting kites, no wonder you're an expert!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Shimakaze：</span><br>
I didn't think you'd know that! Though, I'm not sure what those "dev notes" are... In any case, it started with me collecting them, but then I got really into making them myself!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Inazuma：</span><br>
Now, before we fly it, I think we should paint something pretty on it.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ikazuchi：</span><br>
Good idea! Lemme go get some brushes and paint!<br>
<br>
Shimakaze was hanging out with Inazuma and Ikazuchi, and the three of them were making a kite together. I observed them from a distance.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ikazuchi：</span><br>
All done! I drew a cute little picture of you and stuck it to the kite.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Shimakaze：</span><br>
That's me? Oh my god! I really do have a face only a mother could love, don't I...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ikazuchi：</span><br>
Don't put yourself down like that. It's a caricature. It's supposed to be exaggerated.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Inazuma：</span><br>
Yeah. At least it looks a lot better than the one I drew on your rigging.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Shimakaze：</span><br>
Hahaha! You know, I'm still quite fond of that one even now!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ikazuchi：</span><br>
Art aside, come on! Let's fly this thing already!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Shimakaze：</span><br>
Of course, in just a bit. This place isn't ideal for flying a kite, though. Hmm... Actually, wait here for a moment, I'll be right back.<br>
<br>
Suddenly, my comms device started ringing. Shimakaze was calling me.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Shimakaze：</span><br>
Commander, I'm, uh, with Inazuma and Ikazuchi, and we want to fly a kite. We're going down to the coast, just letting you know. I promise I'll be back on time, though!<br>
<br>
It made me happy to hear she had taken my words to heart. I acknowledged her report and let her be on her way.<br>

4 Day at the Museum<br>
Port - Office<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Shimakaze：</span><br>
Sorry, Commander. I wound up spending nearly the entire day flying that kite...<br>
<br>
"Don't be sorry. I gave you permission to do so, after all."<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Shimakaze：</span><br>
...Oh, I see now!<br>
<br>
"There isn't much work to do today either, so you're free to spend the day however you'd like again."<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Shimakaze：</span><br>
Are you sure? In that case, there's this place I'd really like to visit...<br>
<br>
Shimakaze and I arrived at a newly built museum just on the outskirts of the city.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Shimakaze：</span><br>
Wooow! This weapons museum is incredible! Look at all the stuff they have!<br>
<br>
She looked around the museum while hopping around like an excited dog. Or rather, an excited rabbit.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Shimakaze：</span><br>
Oh! Commander, come take a look at this!<br>
<br>
A plaque caught her attention. I walked over and took a look.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Shimakaze：</span><br>
Apparently, all the weapons on display here aren't replicas, they're the real deal!<br>
<br>
"That's unusual, but interesting. I just hope none of them are still loaded..."<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Shimakaze：</span><br>
Whoa! Look over there! They've even got quintuple torpedo tubes!<br>
<br>
She was about to make a beeline for the torpedo tubes, but I put a hand on her shoulder and stopped her.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Shimakaze：</span><br>
Huh? Excuse me, but I want to go take a closer look! Why are you–<br>
<br>
I brought the two signs next to the museum piece to her attention.<br>
One said to refrain from touching the weapons. The other asked visitors to be quiet inside the museum.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Shimakaze：</span><br>
Oh, whoops... I'm sorry. My carelessness is showing again...<br>
<br>
She slumped over in an exaggerated show of dejection. It was endearing in a way.<br>
Since she apologized, I let her off the hook and cheered her up. Then we continued our tour of the museum, hand in hand.<br>

City - Amusement Park<br>
After how successful our museum trip was, I decided to take Shimakaze out to see another one of the city's attractions.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Shimakaze：</span><br>
Holy smoke! I see we're visiting an amusement park this time! This is going to be awesome!<br>
<br>
We'd only just arrived, and she was already bubbling with excitement. Things were off to a good start.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Shimakaze：</span><br>
All right then, time to conduct our "inspection tour"! I'll catch up with you later!<br>
<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项1："Wait, you're going alone?"</span>'''''<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Shimakaze：</span><br>
Gotta go fast!<br>
<br>
And just like that, she ran off on her own.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Shimakaze：</span><br>
La-de-dum~♪<br>
Ooh, so this place is a house of mirrors! Everywhere I look there's a funny-looking clone of me!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">???：</span><br>
...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Shimakaze：</span><br>
Whoa! Now this is a truly wacky take on my appearance!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Laffey：</span><br>
Am I... a wacky clone to you...?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Shimakaze：</span><br>
Whuah?! Did... Did the mirror just speak?! I must've entered a haunted house instead...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Laffey：</span><br>
I'm not a mirror. I'm Laffey...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Shimakaze：</span><br>
...Oh! It's you! Laffey from the Eagle Union!<br>
<br>
Finally, with the guidance of a Manjuu park employee, I managed to catch up with Shimakaze.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Laffey：</span><br>
Mhm... The Eagle Union's scariest destroyer... And I'm here to haunt yooouu...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Shimakaze：</span><br>
Aaahhh! Noooo! My heart can't handle hauntings, or scary stuff in generaaaaal!<br>
<br>
And what a strange situation I found her in...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Laffey：</span><br>
Thanks for treating me to lunch. I guess it's lucky I happened to come here today...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Shimakaze：</span><br>
No, thank you for gracing me with your presence! I'm simply honored to meet one of the Eagle Union's most renowned destroyers!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Laffey：</span><br>
Well, sure... Who's paying, by the way...?<br>
<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项1："It's on me."</span>'''''<br>
<br>
In the end, I hardly got to try any of the park's rides. Instead, I had a pleasant lunch with two rabbits.<br>

Port - Exercise Area<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Shimakaze：</span><br>
Everyone who can fight, please get into combat position! Suruga will lead the evacuation!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Suruga：</span><br>
What she said! I'll keep the civilians safe... And Shimakaze, don't do anything stupid, all right?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Shimakaze：</span><br>
I know what I'm doing, don't worry! Right, Commander?<br>
<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项1："She sure does."</span>'''''<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项2：Nod silently</span>'''''<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Suruga：</span><br>
All right, it's up to you then!<br>
<br>
We got word of a fleet of mass-produced ships appearing in a sector close to the exercise area.<br>
I mobilized all of the shipgirls in the area, ordered a reload from training ammo to live ammo, and called for reinforcements to aid with the evacuation.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Shimakaze：</span><br>
I've fulfilled all my friends' expectations of me as the secretary! Now it's time foooor... Full steam ahead!<br>
<br>
Shimakaze relayed my orders and swapped ammunition, then prepared to charge at the mass-produced ships. I yelled for her to halt.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Shimakaze：</span><br>
What? Oh, right! M-my bad!<br>
<br>
Luckily, she got the message right away.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Abukuma：</span><br>
We're here too, remember? Don't go running off without us.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ikazuchi：</span><br>
Having plot armor doesn't make you invincible, you know!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Inazuma：</span><br>
Though I'm not quite sure what "plot armor" is, Ikazuchi is right.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Akatsuki：</span><br>
The same for me! Do not forget I'm ready to fight as well!<br>
<br>
Everyone was counting on Shimakaze and me. It was time for us to show them our teamwork.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Shimakaze：</span><br>
Hmm... Okay! We'll capture this area first and hold it until everyone's been evacuated!<br>
Abukuma! Akatsuki! Smokescreens, please!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Abukuma：</span><br>
On it. They won't know what hit them.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Akatsuki：</span><br>
Acknowledged! Deploying smokescreen!<br>
<br>
Shimakaze issued clear orders to all the shipgirls while they got into combat positions.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Shimakaze：</span><br>
Inazuma! Ikazuchi! Follow me! We're going to hit them where it hurts!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Inazuma：</span><br>
Will do! I'm ready!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ikazuchi：</span><br>
Gotcha! Let's dunk on these scrubs!<br>
<br>
It was a blissful sight, seeing all the girls move toward the objective in such perfect formation.<br>

<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Shimakaze：</span><br>
...And that concludes my mission report!<br>
<br>
Shimakaze gave me a debriefing on yesterday's battle with the mass-produced ships.<br>
"This is quite the detailed report. One should expect no less from a first-rate secretary."<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Shimakaze：</span><br>
Oh, please, it's nothing special! I'm just happy to make myself useful to you!<br>
<br>
She flashed a proud smile. It made me realize how much more mature she seemed now compared to just a few days ago.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Shimakaze：</span><br>
On a scale from 1 to 10, how would you rate my report?<br>
<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项1："9, for sure."</span>'''''<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项2："7.5, I suppose?"</span>'''''<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Shimakaze：</span><br>
Aww, dang it! I'll just have to do better next time, I suppose...<br>
<br>
Frankly, I could have given her a perfect 10, but I just thought it'd be wiser to have her strive to become even better.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Shimakaze：</span><br>
You know, being the secretary is honestly pretty great!<br>
Initially, I agreed to do it just as a means to push my own limits. And while it did have that effect...<br>
It also became an opportunity to inspire others to work hard because I myself am working hard! ...Wait, doesn't that make me sound like a slave-driver?!<br>
<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项1："All in the name of productivity!"</span>'''''<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项2：Chuckle heartily</span>'''''<br>
<br>
Hearing her stumble over what she just said brought a smile to my face.<br>
"I have to say, I feel like I've grown after working with you these days."<br>
<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项1："...Physically, that is."</span>'''''<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项2："Or maybe you've just shrunk?"</span>'''''<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Shimakaze：</span><br>
......<br>
<br>
She fell silent. I worried that my joke didn't land, or worse yet, that she took it at face value...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Shimakaze：</span><br>
This... This is why being the secretary's so great!<br>
<br>
"What? Elaborate."<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Shimakaze：</span><br>
Oh, for goodness' sake! Do I have to say it out loud?! All right, fine!<br>
It's great because I get to work with a strong, kind, smart, wisecracking person like you...<br>
I mean, who wouldn't want to work with the person they love? I've loved you since– Whuah?! Oh no!<br>
<br>
Before she could finish pouring her heart out, a cup of coffee slipped out of her hand and hit the floor.<br>
And that was Shimakaze in a nutshell. Sometimes clumsy, sometimes reckless, but always lovable. And our time together had only just begun.<br>
