Good morning, Your Excellency. Did you sleep well?<br>
<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项1："Mrgh... Good morning..."</span>'''''<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项2："Good morning you too!"</span>'''''<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项3："...Yes, Boss?"</span>'''''<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">London：</span><br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项1）</span>'''''Still not fully awake yet, I suppose...<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项1）</span>'''''That's understandable. You did only get three hours of sleep.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">London：</span><br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项2）</span>'''''Fired up and ready to get to work already? Wonderful.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">London：</span><br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项3）</span>'''''Boss? Are you referring to me?<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项3）</span>'''''I'm afraid you have it backwards. You're in charge here. I'm just your secretary.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">London：</span><br>
I have good news – everyone pulled through and managed to solve that problem that cropped up.<br>
As you instructed last night, I gave today off to all project members and let them go home to rest.<br>
This has been a ton of work for all of us. All that's left is a few minor adjustments, which I'll see to in just a minute.<br>
Also, I made you breakfast and coffee. I wasn't sure when you would wake up, so I wrapped them up in foil to keep them warm.<br>
...What is it? Do you feel guilty about dozing off on the job?<br>
Please, you shouldn't. You were far too exhausted to perform any kind of work.<br>
Had I fallen asleep, you wouldn't have tried to wake me up, would you? It's the same thing.<br>
<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项1："Fair enough. Remember to take breaks, yourself."</span>'''''<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">London：</span><br>
I will take one once I finish this task. Rest assured, I'm no workaholic and I know when to stop.<br>
Oh, I just remembered something important...<br>
<br>
London rises from her chair and walks up to me.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">London：</span><br>
Please hold still, Your Excellency. This will only take a moment.<br>
......<br>
There. I straightened out your necktie and collar.<br>
We can't allow our boss to look sloppy before employees, can we?<br>
<br>
I enjoy my breakfast and coffee while London updates me on our project. It's a relief to hear that we summarily resolved the issue that came up last night.<br>

<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Gorizia：</span><br>
Mmrgh! These stockings are so annoying to wear...<br>
Same with these high heels. My feet hurt more than usual...<br>
This is so dumb. Why won't these stockings just–<br>
<br>
*RIP*<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Gorizia：</span><br>
D-did... the stocking just rip?<br>
No, dammit... I can't wear a torn stocking!<br>
If I'd known this would happen, I would've asked for a larger size...<br>
...But that's no excuse to give up. The whole point of this is to try to get the Commander's attention!<br>
I'll get through this! Whatever it takes to capture the Commander's heart!<br>
...C-Commander?!<br>
When did you get here? You didn't hear me say anything, did you?!<br>
...You just arrived? But why? You're a whole hour early to work!<br>
(*sigh*... There goes the surprise factor of my stockings...)<br>
(This totally ruins the mood! Why would you clock in THIS early, you doofus?!)<br>
(No, wait! If I play my cards right, I can turn this in my favor and ask the Commander to help me put these stockings on...)<br>
(Yes! This is the perfect opportunity for us to become closer with one another!)<br>
(Deep breaths... You can do this, me!)<br>
Say, um, my dear Commander...<br>
Would you mind... helping me put on these stockings?<br>
<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项1："Sure thing."</span>'''''<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Gorizia：</span><br>
Be gentle, please. I don't want them to rip!<br>
(Gosh... Not only am I alone with my to-be sweetheart, I even got help with putting my legwear on.)<br>
(Ahh, this is like a dream romance come true!)<br>
Heehee...♥<br>

<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Essex：</span><br>
Weigh anchooor! Essex, setting sail!<br>
Sharp right rudder and full speed aheeead!<br>
<br>
It's nighttime, and the office is all but empty. A lone shipgirl-turned-pirate slides across the floor atop her five-wheeled "warship."<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Essex：</span><br>
Whoa! Commander spotted to our bow! Hoist sails! It's boardin' time!<br>
C'mere!<br>
<br>
I grab her "warship" and stop her drunken charge by a hair's breadth.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Essex：</span><br>
What?! You've summoned a kraken to try and seize my ship, eh!<br>
Well, that's not happenin' on my watch! Time to crank up the horsepower! *glug, glug, glug*...<br>
Hey! That's my liquid courage! Give it back!<br>
<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项1："What's gotten into you? Seriously."</span>'''''<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Essex：</span><br>
I'm so fed up with work... I wanna be a pirate and do what I want 'cause a pirate is free!<br>
You wouldn't get it! You don't know what it's like!<br>
I'll never be as good as my seniors, and my juniors are outperforming me like you wouldn't believe...<br>
So you know what? Screw it! I'm peacing out of this damn rat race!<br>
Hoist sail again, mateys! Head for the open sea! Ahahahaha!<br>
<br>
I can hardly believe I'm talking to the same woman who, just this afternoon, completed her tasks efficiently without a grumble.<br>
I should say something to try and calm her down.<br>
<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项1："You know, tomorrow's a holiday."</span>'''''<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项2："I wanna be a pirate too!"</span>'''''<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Essex：</span><br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项1）</span>'''''It is? Oh, right! It is!<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项1）</span>'''''But... once the holiday's over, it's right back to work! Screw that! I'm quitting!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Essex：</span><br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项2）</span>'''''You do? Oh hell yeah!<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项2）</span>'''''Then I'll be the captain, and you can be my quartermaster! Together, we'll conquer all the seven seas!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Essex：</span><br>
*hic*...<br>
I'm tired... Sho shleepy... *yawn*...<br>
Actually... I'm retiring for the night...<br>
Zzzzz... Commander... shtay with me...<br>
<br>
Without any warning, she leans forward and buries her head in my chest.<br>
Hopefully, come morning, she'll have forgotten about this whole thing...<br>
