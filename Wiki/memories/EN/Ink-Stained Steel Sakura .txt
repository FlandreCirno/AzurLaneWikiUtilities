Mutsu：<br>
Nagato! I just took a look outside and saw tons of people have gathered! You should see it, it's amazing!<br>
Nagato：<br>
I... see...<br>
Mutsu：<br>
They've all come to see you, the Protector of the Sakura Empire and the mightiest battleship in the world! You're so cool!<br>
Nagato：<br>
Do not ridicule me. More importantly, is this outfit on properly? It looks the same as my rigging, yet it feels rather odd to wear...<br>
Mutsu：<br>
Hmm... hang on, your hairpins are a little off! Let me fix that for you...<br>
Let's see... maybe this will... ah, it'll do... There, done! You look perfect, Nagato!<br>
Nagato：<br>
T-thank you... Now then, it is time...<br>
Mutsu：<br>
Yeah, let's go! Everyone's waiting for us!<br>
Nagato：<br>
*Inhale*... *Exhale*... Remember: speak with dignity...<br>
<br>
The young girl took several deep breaths, slowly and elegantly walked up to the shrine doors, then she turned around.<br>
Nagato：<br>
Mutsu, my little sister... Thank you...<br>
The People：<br>
The shrine maiden is here!<br>
Nagato is here! Our Protector graces us with her presence!<br>
<br>
There lied a shrine at the base of the Sacred Sakura, from which the Sakura Empire got its name. Countless people, both citizens of the Sakura Empire and visitors from abroad, had gathered on this day.<br>
A young girl, clad in red and white, emerged from the shrine, taking graceful steps down the shrine's steps.<br>
She wore a shrine maiden's traditional clothing, many gorgeous ornaments, and most important of all: two golden hairpins.<br>
These golden hairpins were the definitive sign that this girl was the keeper of the Sacred Sakura.<br>
The young girl stopped in the center of a podium resting outside the shrine, then faced her people, bearing a magnificent expression.<br>
Nagato：<br>
I am Nagato. Protector of the Sakura Empire and flagship of her Combined Fleet! Let us offer our humblest prayers to the Gods!<br>
<br>
The young girl, with a dignified voice unbefitting of her small stature, made an appeal to the Sakura Empire's people.<br>
Nagato：<br>
People of the Sakura Empire, pray with me, so that we may ensure our nation prospers for many long years to come.<br>
... O Sacred Sakura, in exchange for thy blessings, I offer a prayer to thee...<br>
The People：<br>
Just and pure of heart I shall be, so that thy flowers may bloometh for eternity...<br>
<br>
It was a miracle. The Sacred Sakura had taken in their prayers, and its petals began to glow with a faint light.<br>
Then, the shrine and everything around it became enveloped in a gentle downpour of sakura petals.<br>
The People：<br>
The shrine maiden has brought us a miracle! The Sacred Sakura graces us with its light!<br>
All hail Nagato! All hail Nagato!<br>
<br>
In response to the voices of the people, the sakura petals turned into tiny globes of light.<br>
They converged at a single point above the Sacred Sakura before splitting apart, flying away and spreading out evenly through all of the Sakura Empire.<br>
Then, after a short while, the young girl turned to the crowd and began to speak.<br>
Nagato：<br>
I am Nagato. Protector of the Sakura Empire and flagship of her Combined Fleet! Hear my words! For as long as you believe in the Gods, the Sakura Empire's prosperity is guaranteed!<br>
The People：<br>
May the Sakura Empire prosper for all eternity!<br>
<br>
Amidst the cheers of her people, Nagato turned around and proceeded to walk back to the shrine's interior.<br>
Nagato：<br>
So, how did I fare...? Am I behaving as I should...?<br>
Yes... As you say, the Protector of the Sacred Sakura must be magnificent... I shall do everything to be magnificent!<br>
<br>

Zuikaku：<br>
We're finally back here, after so long... Look, Shoukaku! This is the place where we used to train!<br>
Shoukaku：<br>
Yes, we made many memories here. And we haven't been here ever since the war began...<br>
<br>
Zuikaku's fleet is advancing through a region of the Sakura Empire that's been silent ever since the Sirens attacked it.<br>
The fleet is composed of 3 segments. In the front, there's Ayanami, the "Demon of Solomon," who's conducting a sweep of the area.<br>
In the middle, there are the sisters of the 5th Carrier Division: Shoukaku and Zuikaku.<br>
And in the rear, there's Mikasa, the Combined Fleet's 1st flagship.<br>
Mikasa：<br>
I don't blame you for being so excited to see such a nostalgic place... but could you at least show a little consideration for the elderly... *Panting*...<br>
Zuikaku：<br>
Sorry, Mikasa! We'll slow down. Also, this is the first time I've heard you complaining...<br>
Mikasa：<br>
Speaking of first times, how about you get a taste of my handmade Royal Gourmet when we get back?<br>
<br>
Zuikaku's expression turned flat in an instant.<br>
Zuikaku：<br>
Ahaha, um... I appreciate the thought... But I don't think my palate is ready to try that yet...<br>
<br>
BOOOM!<br>
As soon as the enemy fleet was detected, they began a long-distance bombardment of the path Zuikaku's fleet was taking.<br>
Zuikaku：<br>
That was close! They scared the bejesus outta me!<br>
Ayanami：<br>
Sirens detected at 3 o' clock, distance 12,000 meters.<br>
Mikasa：<br>
Our intel was right; the Sirens really were out here. All personnel! Prepare to strike back!<br>

Zuikaku：<br>
No wonder nobody's come near this place for ages... It's because the Sirens invaded it...<br>
Shoukaku, I'm just wondering: why are we here, again?<br>
Shoukaku：<br>
For the Sacred Sakura. Measurements taken since the war began show that it has started to wither. We're here to investigate why, and also we must...<br>
Mikasa：<br>
We must rescue someone important. The new Combined Fleet is shaping up better than I thought, but we still are in need of her strength.<br>
Zuikaku：<br>
By "someone important," surely you don't mean...?<br>
Mikasa：<br>
I do. We must rescue Nagato, who has remained by the Sacred Sakura all this time.<br>
She wasn't able to prevent the war, and she has been blaming herself for it...<br>
Zuikaku：<br>
We'd better hurry, then! But first, we'll have to take care of these guys!<br>
Kaga：<br>
They're making their way toward the Sacred Sakura. Shouldn't we stop them? Before long, they'll discover Nagato.<br>
Akagi：<br>
Those vermin just won't die no matter how much pesticide you use on them... How utterly annoying.<br>
That said... That girl is just one single battleship. Even if they discover her, she won't be of any use to them.<br>
Ever since she was unable to stop the war from breaking out, she's been... Well, you know.<br>
Kaga：<br>
......<br>
Akagi：<br>
The people's faith and her sacrifice is all just a part of the plan.<br>
All we can do now is wait... We must wait until the one who can oppose the Sirens and change fate itself has arrived...<br>

{{折叠面板|标题=Chance|选项=4|主框=1|样式=primary|展开=否}}
Nagato：<br>
Are you saying that, no matter what, it's inevitable?<br>
Akagi：<br>
It is all for the future of the Sakura Empire. All you need do is give us the order, and we shall do it.<br>
Nagato：<br>
But... If a war breaks out, many will die... Both on their side, and ours...<br>
Akagi：<br>
The force known as change requires tribute in the form of souls. And it's thanks to change that the world can move forward. I'm sure you know this fact very well.<br>
Please, do not worry. The enemy still has no idea that our troops are coming. I can guarantee the attack will be successful.<br>
Nagato：<br>
I see...<br>
Kaga：<br>
Give us the order, Nagato. The elite of the 1st Carrier Division are always ready to sortie.<br>
<br>
She has seen into the eyes of many. She has seen the anticipation in the eyes of faithful believers, and she has seen the gleam that signifies hope for the future.<br>
However, that is not what she's seeing in these people's eyes. Their eyes are filled not with hope, but the desire to receive her authorization to start a war.<br>
She may hesitate, but ultimately she has no choice. The people in charge have already decided what course the future will take.<br>
She knew that her objections would be futile. She clenched her fist, took a deep breath, and made a declaration in the dignified voice she had now grown accustomed to using.<br>
Nagato：<br>
I am Nagato. Protector of the Sakura Empire and flagship of her Combined Fleet.<br>
I hereby issue the following order to all personnel of the Sakura Empire's Combined Fleet:<br>
Commence the attack... on Azur Lane!<br>
{{折叠面板|内容结束}}

{{折叠面板|标题=Sisters|选项=5|主框=1|样式=primary|展开=否}}
<br>
Thou shalt not touch a human, for they would tarnish thy divinity.<br>
Thou shalt not smile, for thou must maintain thy dignity.<br>
Thou shalt not forget: the Creator is your only God.<br>
......<br>
Nagato：<br>
Mutsu, I need your opinion: will this pose be good for the next ceremony?<br>
Mutsu：<br>
Well, hold still so I can get a look... Hmm, it looks kinda stupid to me. Maybe it'd work if you kept your arms totally straight?<br>
Nagato：<br>
Huh? ... L-like this?<br>
Mutsu：<br>
Hahaha~ You look like a doll now!<br>
Nagato：<br>
......<br>
Mutsu：<br>
Sorry, I didn't mean it like that! C'mon, let me see a smile! Say "cheese"!<br>
<br>
Though the girl tried, her smile came off as incredibly forced.<br>
Nagato：<br>
I'm sorry... I can't do it...<br>
I seem to have forgotten how to smile...<br>

Nagato：<br>
The Sacred Sakura is withering... And the people are losing faith...<br>
Mutsu：<br>
Nagato! Sirens have surrounded this place! I heard they're supposed to protect it, but then that means...<br>
That we're cooperating with them! How did this happen?! What's everyone thinking?!<br>
Nagato：<br>
... Mutsu, I must tell you something...<br>
A few days ago, I relinquished my position as the Combined Fleet's flagship.<br>
Mutsu：<br>
You did WHAT?!<br>
<br>
A blend of shock and anger was welling up in the young girl's sister's eyes.<br>
Nagato：<br>
It is the age of aircraft carriers now. Soon there will likely be no need of us at all...<br>
Mutsu：<br>
Those idiots! They don't even know what we're capable of, yet they go and do this!<br>
We're part of the Big Seven! I have a thing or two to say to those idiots, right now!<br>
<br>
The girl stretched both her arms out and stood in the way of her little sister.<br>
Nagato：<br>
Mutsu, it's over! Battleships have no place in this world anymore! ... It's unfortunate, but think of it this way: now that I'm no longer the flagship, I can focus my energy on trying to solve the problem we're facing.<br>
Every day since the war's outbreak, the Spirits... or, what the Sirens called "quantum data," of our fallen people have been trying to tell me something... I know this is all my fault, but...<br>
Mutsu：<br>
No, it's not your fault! Those people have been trying to use your powers for their own gain this whole time!<br>
Nagato：<br>
I know they have! But it matters not... There is only one thing I can do to atone for my wrongdoings.<br>
Mutsu, I want you to seal me inside the Sacred Sakura. That way, I will be able to see the Spirits, and I may be able to learn something.<br>
It is for the sake of the Sakura Empire.<br>
Mutsu：<br>
Nagato...<br>
Nagato：<br>
I know what you're worried about, but it is fine. Someone I can trust will protect me. She won't let anyone near the Sacred Sakura.<br>
Mutsu：<br>
You mean... that Shiratsuyu-class girl? She and I aren't exactly close friends...<br>
Nagato：<br>
... You will make friends with her while I'm not here. And one last thing...<br>
Mutsu：<br>
What is it?<br>
Nagato：<br>
Thank you for everything you've done, Mutsu.<br>

Kawakaze：<br>
Halt! Who are you?!<br>
Zuikaku：<br>
We're the Sakura Empire's new Combined Fleet, and we're here to have a look at the girl in the Sacred Sakura...<br>
Kawakaze：<br>
... Leave this place. None shall disturb the shrine maiden's slumber.<br>
Mikasa：<br>
It is our goal to bring Nagato and her sister safely out of here!<br>
Kawakaze：<br>
I thank you for your noble consideration, but I made a promise with Nagato. I shall not let anyone wake her from her slumber!<br>
Nobody, not even you, even though we are allies.<br>
Zuikaku：<br>
*Sigh*... I really hate it when people are as stubborn as you... We're trying to save the world! Let us through!<br>
Kawakaze：<br>
If you still wish to have it your way, then show me your resolve through a battle!<br>
Zuikaku：<br>
I knew it! I knew this would happen! It's so clichéd, yet it always does!<br>
Kawakaze：<br>
Relax. I will end this in an instant!<br>
{{折叠面板|内容结束}}

{{折叠面板|标题=Boundary|选项=8|主框=1|样式=primary|展开=否}}
Kawakaze：<br>
You really are as strong as they say. I'm impressed.<br>
Zuikaku：<br>
Come on, we're allies! We didn't have to fight in the first place...<br>
Kawakaze：<br>
Sorry, I was overcome by my soldierly instinct to fight a worthy opponent.<br>
Zuikaku：<br>
Yeah, sure... So will you lead us to her, as you promised?<br>
Kawakaze：<br>
I am true to my word. I know I can entrust Nagato to you people.<br>
<br>
......<br>
At the base of the Sacred Sakura, encircled by countless pillars and holy ropes to ward off evil spirits, sat a large, translucent crystal.<br>
Sealed inside it was Nagato, shrine maiden of the Sakura Empire and flagship of its fleet.<br>
She wore a pained expression, as though she was having a nightmare.<br>
Kawakaze：<br>
For years, she's been watching over the Spirits, or what the Sirens called "quantum data."<br>
She seems to view it as some sort of atonement, but in reality, it's not. She was just deceived by a small group of people.<br>
And all I can do is watch over her and keep her safe from the Sirens.<br>
You are the only ones who can save her.<br>
Mikasa：<br>
That is our goal, too. Kawakaze, you have done well. We shall take care of the rest!<br>

Thou shalt not touch a human, for they would tarnish thy divinity.<br>
Thou shalt not smile, for thou must maintain thy dignity.<br>
Thou shalt not forget: the Creator is your only God.<br>
......<br>
"... I want to help them! It isn't fair for our brethren fighting tooth and nail for our sake while we remain behind...!"<br>
"Mutsu and I are supposed to be the biggest, most powerful battleships! ... Please, you must let us go! I swear we shall not get in anyone's way!"<br>
"Thou shalt stay!"<br>
"How wouldst thou explain thyself to thy people if thou, their Protector, the strongest battleship in the world, were ever injured in battle?!"<br>
"But..."<br>
"Excessive sympathy leadeth to one's own destruction."<br>
"Thine duty to the Sakura Empire is to follow my orders. Is that clear?"<br>
"It is clear. Thus far, following your orders has been for the best."<br>
Nagato：<br>
Mutsu...<br>
Mutsu：<br>
Yeah?<br>
Nagato：<br>
Do you see those dolls on the table? Do you think they, too, possess a heart and a soul?<br>
Mutsu：<br>
Who knows... What's the matter, Nagato?<br>
Nagato：<br>
Since our creation, this world has changed completely.<br>
I'm sure you already know. Across the sea, there are ships just like us, the so-called "Big Seven"...<br>
I pray that one day, we may meet and befriend them...<br>
... But, more importantly, I pray that one day I may get to test their skill in combat. Ahah...<br>
Mutsu：<br>
Hey! You smiled! I knew you could do it!<br>
Nagato：<br>
W-what? I-I... I did not smile! I just had a s-slip of the tongue...<br>
Mutsu：<br>
Still, remember that friendly visit we made a while ago? One day you'll surely have the chance to meet them!<br>
Nagato：<br>
Let us hope so... U-until then, Mutsu... you must promise to keep me company...<br>
Mutsu：<br>
... Of course!<br>

Zuikaku：<br>
... It's our duty and all, but finding a way to wake Nagato is easier said than done...<br>
Ayanami：<br>
I've detected a Siren fleet. They're in the process of surrounding us... 12 minutes until contact.<br>
Zuikaku：<br>
God dammit, not more of them... Even if they all stand still, we won't make any progress... I guess we could knock on the crystal to see if she'll wake up...<br>
<br>
KABOOOM!<br>
A shell splashed the water just in front of Zuikaku.<br>
Kawakaze：<br>
I won't let anyone lay a finger on her.<br>
Zuikaku：<br>
Geez, I was just kidding... Don't get so worked up, I wasn't serious!<br>
？？？：<br>
How stupid do you have to be, trying to persuade her?<br>
Zuikaku：<br>
That voice, could it be...?<br>
Mutsu：<br>
... Why would you be mean to my poor sister? You should know your place, idiots!<br>
Zuikaku：<br>
It's Mutsu, the Big Seven...!<br>
Mutsu：<br>
Huh? You know about me? How?<br>
Zuikaku：<br>
Well, we're trying to wake up Nagato, and save the Sacred Sakura while we're at it, so we came here to...<br>
<br>
BOOOM!<br>
BAAANG!<br>
The Sirens fired 2 shots at them.<br>
One of the shots hit the Sacred Sakura, causing one of its large branches to snap.<br>
Shoukaku：<br>
It's unlikely this conversation can continue until after we've dealt with the Sirens...<br>
Kawakaze：<br>
I will protect the shrine maiden at any cost!<br>
Zuikaku：<br>
Wait, hold on! ... Dammit! She's totally stealing my spot in the limelight!<br>
{{折叠面板|内容结束}}

{{折叠面板|标题=Waking Up|选项=11|主框=1|样式=primary|展开=否}}
<br>
BAAANG!<br>
KABOOOM!<br>
Mutsu：<br>
Oh no! We can't let another shot hit the Sacred Sakura!<br>
Zuikaku：<br>
I've got my hands full with trying to dodge what's coming at me! ... Oh crap, look out!<br>
<br>
BOOOM!<br>
A fierce battle was unfolding around the Sacred Sakura. Shot after shot hit the tree, filling the air with the smell of burning timber.<br>
The girl encased in the crystal seemed to be in pain.<br>
Mutsu：<br>
This is bad... If they keep shooting, Nagato's gonna...<br>
<br>
FWOOOSH!<br>
A flash of light formed an impenetrable barrier around the girl and her rescuers.<br>
？？？：<br>
How dare you fiends disrupt the peace of these Spirits...<br>
<br>
A voice came from within the Sacred Sakura. The barrier of light had actually been created from its countless branches, leaves, and petals.<br>
The clash between the Sirens and Nagato's rescuers came to a total stop.<br>
？？？：<br>
Beasts who dare trespass on these holy grounds! Leave at once!<br>
<br>
The light from the tree coalesced into a furious stream which engulfed the Siren fleet in one fell swoop.<br>
In the blink of an eye, the area had become littered with the wrecks of many Sirens.<br>
Then, the light formed into a sphere and floated over to Nagato's rescuers, with the young but dignified girl hovering at its center.<br>
Mutsu：<br>
N-Nagato...!<br>
Kawakaze：<br>
The shrine maiden lives!<br>
Zuikaku：<br>
W-what's the hell?<br>
Nagato：<br>
I am Nagato. Protector of the Sakura Empire and flagship of her Combined Fleet!<br>
{{折叠面板|内容结束}}

{{折叠面板|标题=Final Battle|选项=12|主框=1|样式=primary|展开=否}}
Zuikaku：<br>
Okay, I'm really, really sorry for trying to rouse you from your slumber...!<br>
<br>
Sensing a fiery fury within the eyes of the girl, Zuikaku panicked and began pleading for forgiveness.<br>
Nagato：<br>
You must be Zuikaku of the 5th Carrier Division. What business have you with me?<br>
Zuikaku：<br>
... Head on the nail! You see, we need you on our side!<br>
Nagato：<br>
I refuse!<br>
Zuikaku：<br>
Could you at least try it before you say no?!<br>
Nagato：<br>
I was tasked with ensuring the Sacred Sakura's safety. I shall remain here till my body turns to dust.<br>
Mutsu：<br>
Nagato, you...<br>
Zuikaku：<br>
Did you make that decision of your own accord? Or was it forced on you?<br>
Nagato：<br>
I... It is for the sake of the Sakura Empire and her people, and to atone for my sins. My say is irrelevant.<br>
Mikasa：<br>
You fool!<br>
Nagato：<br>
W-what?!<br>
Mikasa：<br>
Do you not see how frivolous it is to sit here and rot away when a battleship of your caliber is more desirable than ever in these changing times?!<br>
Nagato：<br>
I-is that...<br>
Is that you, Mikasa?!<br>
Mikasa：<br>
Your 41 centimeter cannons make whole nations quiver, your bridge towers to the heavens, your armor deflects shells like they were stones...<br>
<br>
Trying to hide her envy, Mikasa whispered: "... My envy of you cannot be adequately expressed! You are the finest example of a battleship!"<br>
Nagato was trying to maintain her dignified appearance, but humbled by Mikasa's words, she loosened up.<br>
Nagato：<br>
I-it's not as great as you think... But why are you here, Mikasa?<br>
Zuikaku：<br>
Uh, it's a long story, so why don't you come with us and we'll explain it on the way...<br>
<br>
However, Nagato ignored what Zuikaku was saying.<br>
Nagato：<br>
M-Mikasa, ever since I became the Combined Fleet's flagship, I've been trying to be like you...<br>
I tried to be a magnificent flagship... And yet...<br>
Mikasa：<br>
Say no more. Have a battle with me.<br>
Nagato：<br>
Huh...?<br>
Mikasa：<br>
I needed only one look at your cannons to know it with certainty: you haven't fired them as much as once since your birth.<br>
Nagato：<br>
Ah...!?<br>
<br>
Mikasa's remark caused a single tear to form in the corner of one of Nagato's eyes.<br>
Mikasa：<br>
Battleships should know dearly the smell of the sea and gunpowder, not of trees and their own rusting hulls. I can't stand to see my successor stuck in a place like this.<br>
Sometimes, a battle can offer more insight into a person's character than a thousand of their words.<br>
You there, you must be her little sister. Why not join us for a bout?<br>
Mutsu：<br>
Sure! Hehehe~ I've been waiting so long for this day!<br>
Nagato：<br>
......<br>
<br>
Thou shalt not touch a human, for they would tarnish thy divinity.<br>
Thou shalt not smile, for thou must maintain thy dignity.<br>
Thou shalt not forget: the Creator is your only God.<br>
Nagato：<br>
Because I was made by humans, I desire bonds just like them.	<br>
Dignity alone won't make my people admire me. At times, I must smile, too.<br>
O, Creator, I beg of you: grant me new life as someone whom my people can believe in with all their heart.<br>
Very well! Lacking in experience as I may be, I shall hold nothing back!<br>
I am Nagato, Big Seven of the Sakura Empire! Prepare yourself!<br>

{namecode:74}&{namecode:75}：<br>
Ugh, we lost... Even though we tried so hard...<br>
Mikasa：<br>
I may be old, but I've still got it! Ahahahah!<br>
Nagato：<br>
Mikasa...<br>
Mikasa：<br>
So, did you enjoy yourself?<br>
Nagato：<br>
I did. It was quite a learning experience as well.<br>
But... I still have much to learn. About combat, and about myself. I didn't want to be a disappointment to my people or my friends, so I worked strenuously...<br>
I've lost so much, and I was manipulated into starting a war... Nobody can deny it's all my fault.<br>
However, the Spirits told me something important: that there is a divergence point in this timeline. And I want you to help me look for it.<br>
This time... I will not run away from myself!<br>
Purifier：<br>
Hey, look who figured it all out~ I didn't even need to butt in~<br>
Everyone：<br>
Where did you come from?!<br>
Purifier：<br>
The intel was right~ The "divergence point," or whatever, in this timeline has brought you all in one place!<br>
<br>
Nagato took aim at and fired the Siren, but she dodged it. Purifier didn't respond by preparing for combat, instead she turned to Nagato with a displeased look.<br>
Purifier：<br>
... Hey, could you not take out your anger on me just cause you woke up on the wrong side of the bed? I'm just here to give you a hint, buttercup!<br>
Let's see... "When the Winter's Crown is donned, when the Steel Sakura blooms... the Souls' Transmigration will begin... and start the Final Prelude"?<br>
... Yikes, like straight out of a cringy fanfic. Who came up with this pretentious garbage? I'll need to go wash my eyes with bleach later!<br>
Nagato：<br>
Have you any more to say? If not... prepare to be engulfed by cannon fire!<br>

Purifier：<br>
Aaagghhh! I just wanted to check out a tree, and now I'm being forced to make like one! Purifier's blasting off agaaaaaaaain!<br>
<br>
BOOOM!<br>
Nagato：<br>
*Gasp*... *Gasp*... Has the Siren retreated...?<br>
Mikasa：<br>
For being your first real battle, that was spectacular. How does it feel to be victorious?<br>
Nagato：<br>
*Gasp*... I didn't think a battle would be this tiring, but... to fight and be victorious, as an actual combatant, feels terrific.<br>
Zuikaku：<br>
So, will you team up with us and help fight the baddies?<br>
Nagato：<br>
Yes. By the way, Mikasa, there is something the Siren said that I'm worried about...<br>
She mentioned "soul transmigration." There is a legend that says the Sacred Sakura is a catalyst for God to hear our prayers...<br>
But it's also said that it offers peace and salvation to the souls of the deceased.<br>
If the Spirits I saw in my slumber are the "souls" the Siren spoke of, then they aren't gathering here, but in a far-off, distant place.<br>
Whether the Sirens are behind this, or a being beyond my comprehension, I can't say. But I do know that somewhere in this world, there is a force trying to cause great change.<br>
Mikasa：<br>
I see... Your concern deserves attention, but for now, we need more allies.<br>
Zuikaku has bothered you with the question many times now, but won't you join us?<br>
Nagato：<br>
Yes... I'm interested to see what's in store for me in the unexplored oceans beyond my birthplace...<br>
I, battleship Nagato, shall fight by your side!<br>
Akagi：<br>
Finally... Finally, it is complete...<br>
With this power, we will crush all that stand in our way like insects, even the Grey Ghost and the Sirens... Isn't this marvelous, Kaga?<br>
Kaga：<br>
I never thought we could get our hands on this much power... It is marvelous, my sister.<br>
Akagi：<br>
We must plan for the final battle... Soon, we shall change the Sakura Empire's future, and establish a new world order... Ahahahaha...<br>
Kaga：<br>
If you were in this situation beyond all expectations... what would you do?<br>
