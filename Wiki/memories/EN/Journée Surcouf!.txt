Journé Surcouf!<br>
<br>
Chapter 1 - Surcouf at Sunrise<br>
Port - Private Quarters<br>
It felt like something was rubbing against my nose...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">？？？：</span><br>
Hehehe... tickle, tickle... this ought to wake you up...<br>
<br>
Letting out a powerful sneeze, as loud as a small firecracker, I opened my eyes and looked to my side.<br>
Surcouf was in the room, holding a green foxtail in her hand, which she was rubbing against the underside of my nose.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Surcouf：</span><br>
Bonne journée! Good morning, Commander! I've come to wake you from your slumber, as part of my secretary duties!<br>
Oh yeah, speaking of sleep, I actually had a dream about you yesterday~<br>
I dreamt I was having this huge French dinner! It was totally free, too! And then I heard you yelling at me, saying "don't stuff yourself full, you've got work to do!" and then I woke up...<br>
I wish you'd let me taste that huge lobster... but oh well, c'est la vie.<br>
So, what did you dream about? Did you dream of me?<br>
Hold on, don't answer. I already know you did~<br>
So let me rephrase: what was I up to in your dream?<br>
<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项1：Begin your morning routine</span>'''''<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Surcouf：</span><br>
C'mon, don't ignore me like that! You don't have to shy away from admitting you dreamt about me!<br>
<br>
A few minutes later...<br>
Surcouf：<br>
Zzzzzz...<br>
Zzz... Geesh, so pervy, Commander... Zzz...<br>
<br>
This gal has a lot of gall, falling asleep on someone else's bed and sleeptalking like this...<br>

Chapter 2 - Surcouf in the Morning<br>
Port - Commander's Office<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Surcouf：</span><br>
Mmh... ah... Where... am I...?<br>
The office...?<br>
That's weird, I could've sworn I went off to wake up the Commander... Guess I dreamt it all up... Alright then, back to sleep...<br>
<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项1：Wake her up</span>'''''<br>
<br>
After using nearly every method I could think of, I finally managed to wake up Surcouf.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Surcouf：</span><br>
You're saying you carried me all the way here from your room?<br>
Hehe, wow~ That must've been a lot of fun for you!<br>
Not so much for me, you know? I was fast asleep, so I don't know the feeling of being carried in your arms.<br>
So I'm offering you the opportunity to do it again! Carry me like a princess!<br>
<br>
Surcouf got in position, waiting for me to lift and hold her in my arms.<br>
<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项1：Gently whack her on the head</span>'''''<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Surcouf：</span><br>
Owie! I wasn't expecting you to hit me for that...<br>
Right, I was wondering another thing! Did anyone catch you in the act of bringing me here? Did they look at you like you were some weird pervert?<br>
If I saw something like that, I'd be like: "that poor girl... She's fast asleep, and the Commander's just carrying her around the place like that? How could anyone do something so cruel..."<br>
How is poor little Surcouf going to get married now that this has happened to her?<br>
<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项1：Actually...</span>'''''<br>
Surcouf：<br>
Huh? They looked at you all compassionate and accepting, more than anything else...?<br>
Well, I guess this isn't the first time it's happened...<br>
Wait, does this mean they all think I'm annoying and don't care what happens to me?!<br>
<br>
Surcouf was unable to contain her shocked reaction.<br>
......<br>
It's time to get to work.<br>
Surcouf：<br>
Darn it... Well, no use thinking too hard about it! I'm ready to start working! Let's do this!<br>

Chapter 3 - Surcouf at Work<br>
Port - Commander's Office<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Surcouf：</span><br>
I'm so boooored, Commander...<br>
<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项1：Point towards the clock</span>'''''<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Surcouf：</span><br>
What?! It's only been 30 minutes?! It feels like a century's passed!<br>
Weeell... Hehehe, you busy over there, Commander? I bet not. C'mon, let's talk, if you've got the time~<br>
<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项1：Ignore her</span>'''''<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项2：Nod</span>'''''<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Surcouf：</span><br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项1）</span>'''''Well okay, I'll talk and you just listen, then~!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Surcouf：</span><br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项2）</span>'''''I thought so♪<br>
<br>
... Gotta hand it to her: she did manage to last 30 minutes. That's pretty impressive, for Surcouf.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Surcouf：</span><br>
So, Commander, you appointed me as your secretary because you were so enamored with my gorgeous body, weren't you~?<br>
If both you and everyone else are so crazy about it, that's gotta mean I'm really attractive! Ehehe~<br>
<br>
......<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Surcouf：</span><br>
Have I ever told you that I'm one of the few submarines that can carry a floatplane?<br>
Tell you what, hold on a second and I'll... Huh? Where's my little Passepartout?<br>
Oh, right, I left him behind when I went to wake you up... Never mind. Oh well, I rarely use him anyway.<br>
<br>
......<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Surcouf：</span><br>
Commander, check it out! I bet this swimsuit would look great on me!<br>
It's a new seasonal model, too! When you get your month's salary, you should order it for me! I'll wear it just for you, of course!<br>
<br>
......<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Surcouf：</span><br>
Hey, I've been thinking: what colors should we use for the fleet's flag?<br>
White and blue are tried and true, but I want something new and distinct...<br>
<br>
......<br>
Surcouf：<br>
Okay! I've recharged my batteries and I'm ready to start working!<br>
Huh? Really? It's noon already?<br>
So, time to go grab some lunch then, right? Ehehe~<br>

Chapter 4 - Surcouf in the Noon<br>
Port - Cafeteria<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Surcouf：</span><br>
Commander, I want some of those meatballs, octopus weiners, that thing... those, and that! C'mon, gimme!<br>
<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项1：Move your side dishes away</span>'''''<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Surcouf：</span><br>
Hey! I specifically chose different sides so I could trade with you, you know!<br>
I'm not just gonna take without giving! Here, have this, some of this... this too, and... I don't like giving this one up, but here!<br>
Heheh, isn't it great to have such a generous secretary?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Dunkerque：</span><br>
Ah, enjoying lunch together with the Commander again? Aren't you a lovely couple.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Surcouf：</span><br>
G'day, Dunkerque! Wait, don't you know? I'm the Commander's secretary, so there's nothing strange about us having lunch together!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Dunkerque：</span><br>
Aha, I suppose that's true. By the way, I made a few confections today. Do visit me later if you'd like some.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Surcouf：</span><br>
Really?! Heck yeah~ Hey, Commander, once we're done working, let's drop by Dunkerque's place for some tasty sweets!<br>
<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项1：Nod</span>'''''<br>
Dunkerque：<br>
Now then, I'll be on my way before I become a nuisance.<br>
Surcouf：<br>
Au revoir!<br>
<br>
......<br>
Surcouf：<br>
Man, Dunkerque's such a nice girl, don't you think?<br>
There's this other girl, Jean Bart, from the same faction. But in stark contrast to the sweet and caring Dunkerque, Jean Bart is kind of cold and mean...<br>
Which reminds me of some fun trivia! Commander, did you know that both Jean Bart and I got our names from famous pirates? Though I'm not sure if her namesake was a pirate or technically some other thing...<br>
Anyhow, I guess she's got some appeal. Piratey appeal. I wouldn't say I'm like that, though.<br>
Eat a lot, sleep a lot, fight a lot! And everything else is your responsibility~ That's the life I wanna live~<br>
<br>
I don't blame people for getting the impression that Surcouf is a lazy girl. But there's more to her than that...<br>
When it comes to combat and mission performance, I've heard nothing but good things about her.<br>
Surcouf：<br>
Still, sometimes I think about how cool she can be. I'm sure lots of people do.<br>
She's all like "keep your damn distance!" and stuff. Hey, you try it, Commander! I wanna hear you say it!<br>
<br>
... Let's just focus on our lunch.<br>

<br>
Chapter 5 - Surcouf in the Afternoon Pt. 1<br>
Port - Commander's Office<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Surcouf：</span><br>
*Yaaaaaaawn*...<br>
Now with my belly full of food, I say it's time for a nap.<br>
<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项1：Give in to the urge to yawn</span>'''''<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Surcouf：</span><br>
Was that a yawn just now? You wanna take a nap, too?<br>
You've been working nonstop since morning. You've gotta rest a while, or else you'll have no energy for your work in the afternoon.<br>
So, you get some sleep, and I'll wake you once naptime is over!<br>
<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项1：Nod</span>'''''<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项2：You're just gonna fall asleep too...</span>'''''<br>
<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项2）</span>'''''Worrying about it won't do me any good. I should just take a short nap like she says.<br>
<br>
......<br>
I can hear somebody's voice...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Surcouf：</span><br>
Geez... "Take a nap," I say, and you switch off like a lightbulb.<br>
Can't blame you for being so exhausted though, considering how busy you are with work. You deserve some rest, Commander.<br>
<br>
Surcouf gently patted me on the head.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Surcouf：</span><br>
I've never watched over you like this before, come to think of it. Heheh, I can stare at you as much as I want~<br>
Hmm... I guess you're...<br>
... surprisingly... plain? I'm much cuter, and Jean Bart is way cooler.<br>
Even so... you know how to amuse me, you never do anything to annoy me, and you know just what I like...<br>
You're supervising such a big fleet, but you still care about all the little details...<br>
I doubt my life would be the same without you at this point...<br>
<br>
I'm picking up a rosy smell. What could it be?<br>
Surcouf：<br>
... you very much, Commander.<br>
<br>
It feels like Surcouf just said something important, but I can't ward off my drowsiness any longer...<br>

<br>
Chapter 6 - Surcouf in the Afternoon Pt. 2<br>
Port - Commander's Office<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">？？？：</span><br>
Hey, wake up! ... I said WAKE UP, dammit!<br>
<br>
I woke up to the feeling of something hitting me in the face.<br>
Jean Bart was in the office. She was holding a stack of mission reports in her hand.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Jean Bart：</span><br>
Your break ended 30 minutes ago, but apparently, you deserve longer breaks than everyone else.<br>
<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项1：... Surcouf was supposed to wake me up</span>'''''<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Jean Bart：</span><br>
Surcouf? Ya mean Sleeping Beauty over there?<br>
<br>
Following Jean Bart's gaze, I turned my head over to the sofa. There Surcouf was, sleeping soundly, like a toddler.<br>
... I knew I couldn't trust her to wake me up.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Jean Bart：</span><br>
Appointing this girl as your secretary was a mistake. Least if ya ask me.<br>
<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项1：Do you hate her?</span>'''''<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Jean Bart：</span><br>
Hate's a strong word. We're still part of the same fleet.<br>
In short, she's the polar opposite of me in almost every way, and that's my beef with her.<br>
For someone named after a famed pirate, she's got no ambition. There's a limit to how lazy you're allowed to be.<br>
Besides, you really think she can do her job in this sorry state she's in?<br>
Hey, yeah... This girl's no secretary, she's just a pet who's adapted to living in your office.<br>
<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项1：Point to all the processed documents on your desk</span>'''''<br>
Jean Bart：<br>
Shiver me timbers... Just looking at that mountain of paperwork makes my head spin...<br>
What was that...? You went through 'em all on your own?<br>
Are you saying your work gets done even if she's useless, and you don't even wish that she'd do anything useful?<br>
<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项1：Nod</span>'''''<br>
Jean Bart：<br>
Hmph. Whatever the hell suits you.<br>
Surcouf：<br>
Zzzz... Commander... ehehe...<br>
Jean Bart：<br>
... Like two peas in a pod.<br>
Got one last bit of advice for ya: you oughta wash your face before going out in public.<br>
<br>
Jean Bart promptly left the office after finishing her sentence.<br>
... Wash my face?<br>
<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项1：Look in the mirror</span>'''''<br>
<br>
... Surcouf had left a kiss mark on my cheek.<br>

Chapter 7 - Surcouf in My Arms<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Surcouf：</span><br>
Mmh... good morning, Commander...<br>
<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项1：Smile and tell her the time</span>'''''<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项2：Tell her the time normally</span>'''''<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Surcouf：</span><br>
Oh geez, it's that late already?!<br>
I'm so sorry, Commander! I tried to wake you up when breaktime was over, but you were sleeping so soundly, and I just...<br>
I didn't MEAN to fall asleep and leave you hanging! P-please, don't be angry... okay?<br>
<br>
Surcouf was visibly flustered. You rarely see her like this.<br>
<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项1：Point to your desk</span>'''''<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Surcouf：</span><br>
Is that all... your work for today?<br>
Wow, it's all done! You're the most amazing person ever, Commander!<br>
But I wasn't of any help... You did it all on your own... I'm a failure of a secretary...<br>
<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项1：I couldn't have done it without you</span>'''''<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Surcouf：</span><br>
Y-you mean it...? But all I did was sleep and chat with you...<br>
Is it possible I'm... helping you just by sleeping in your office...?<br>
... Ah well, better not think too hard♪ If you say I was useful, then I was!<br>
Whew, that sure was a day of hard secretary work! Good job, me!<br>
I'll put in just as much effort tomorrow!<br>
<br>
Just a moment ago, Surcouf seemed depressed, but now she appeared pleased with herself.<br>
Surcouf：<br>
Oh, right! Remember how we talked about going to Dunkerque's place for some tasty sweets?<br>
I say first we get some dinner, then we head straight to Dunkerque's place for dessert~!<br>
... Y'know, I enjoy every day spent with you, Commander♪<br>
<br>
And I enjoy every day spent with you, Surcouf.<br>
