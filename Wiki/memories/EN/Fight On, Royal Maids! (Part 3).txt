Fight On, Royal Maids! (Part 3)<br>
<br>
1 The Third Exercise<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Queen Elizabeth：</span><br>
Do you understand, Illustrious? This exercise is a sublime opportunity to gauge the strength of our latest carriers!<br>
Both sides are to consist of three carriers each, plus a small escort fleet.<br>
The Royal Maids did an exemplary job demonstrating the Royal Navy's excellence in the previous two exercises. You lot have a high standard to live up to, but I expect you'll do just fine!<br>
One last thing: As this is an aviation exercise, neither I nor the Commander will be in charge.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Illustrious：</span><br>
...Those were Her Majesty's instructions.<br>
The Royal Navy's exercise fleet will be centred around Centaur, Perseus, and Albion.<br>
As for the opposing fleet, I'm told it's up to you to determine its composition, Commander.<br>
<br>
"I see. It'll be hard to narrow down my picks when there are so many qualified candidates."<br>
"Is there anyone you'd recommend, Essex?"<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Essex：</span><br>
I do. The Essex class has plenty of combat experience, and I believe we'd make a worthy opponent for the Royal Navy.<br>
If you're looking for specific names, how about Intrepid, Shangri-La, and Bunker Hill?<br>
<br>
*knock knock*<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Littorio：</span><br>
Sorry for showing up uninvited, but I heard you're planning a carrier-on-carrier exercise?<br>
How do you feel about giving Sardegna an opportunity to participate? We seldom get opportunities like this.<br>
<br>
"I don't see why not. Though, Sardegna currently only has two carriers stationed here – Aquila and Impero. That leaves one slot to fill..."<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Littorio：</span><br>
I have no issues working with someone from the Eagle Union. Essex, what do you think about an Eagle Union-Sardegna Empire joint task force?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Essex：</span><br>
Well, it's certainly an ambitious idea and will pose an interesting challenge for everyone involved.<br>
Commander, if you don't have any issues then I'm in favor of it.<br>
<br>
"No objections here. That still leaves the question about the final carrier, though."<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Essex：</span><br>
Intrepid might be the best fit, in my opinion.<br>
<br>
"Then Intrepid it is. Also, I'm appointing you as the task force leader, Essex."<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Essex：</span><br>
M-me? As you say! I promise I will not disappoint you!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Littorio：</span><br>
Great. I'll inform Aquila and Impero at once.<br>
Oh, and I trust you to assemble the escort fleet, Essex. Now, if you'll excuse me...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Essex：</span><br>
Okay then... Illustrious, has the Royal Navy already worked out its escort fleet composition?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Illustrious：</span><br>
Yes. We've chosen Manchester of the Royal Maids and Janus, a trainee maid.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Essex：</span><br>
Alright. In that case, I'm going with Reno as our light cruiser. We'll also need a destroyer...<br>
<br>
"There's a candidate right here. We need at least one maid per side, don't we?"<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Jervis：</span><br>
...Me? Is this some kind of joke, Commander?<br>
I may have taken some maid training courses, but that doesn't make me a full-fledged member of the Royal Maids, does it?<br>
<br>
"Maybe not, but I'd say you know more than enough about the Royal Navy's tactics to fill in that role."<br>
"Essex, Illustrious, are you two on board?"<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Essex：</span><br>
I always trust your judgment, Commander!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Illustrious：</span><br>
Likewise. I believe she's just as qualified as any of the Royal Maids.<br>
<br>
"Then that settles it. Jervis, you're on the escort fleet."<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Jervis：</span><br>
Uhh, I see... If you insist, I'll do as you say.<br>

<br>
Fight On, Royal Maids! (Part 3)<br>
<br>
2 Wings Above the Field<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Albion：</span><br>
This is the Royal Navy carrier task force. Connection established. Awaiting instructions from Elder Illustrious.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Illustrious：</span><br>
Has the fleet arrived at the coordinates?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Albion：</span><br>
Yes, they just reached the objective. Fortunately no signs of hostiles yet. Unfortunately, the weather looks quite poor...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Illustrious：</span><br>
Poor weather affects both sides equally. We just have to locate their fleet first and seize the advantage.<br>
Has your fleet launched reconnaissance planes?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Albion：</span><br>
We have! Elder Perseus is currently surveying the area. We should find something shortly.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Illustrious：</span><br>
Please send over the data and I'll help with analysing it. In the meanwhile, contact me if anything happens.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Centaur：</span><br>
I'm impressed, Albion. You gave off the impression of a skilled frontline commander during that call.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Albion：</span><br>
Thank you, but I still have much to learn, Elder Centaur.<br>
My modest capabilities will be put to the test today. The joint Eagle Union-Sardegna task force will pose a considerable challenge.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Manchester：</span><br>
Yeah, but it'll be a brilliant show of the Royal Navy's strength if we DO beat 'em, wunnit?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Albion：</span><br>
That is true. To that end, we'll all need to give it our all.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Manchester：</span><br>
Course, heheh! I've got your flanks covered!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Janus：</span><br>
Albion, I just received some coordinates from Perseus. I believe she may have spotted the enemy.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Albion：</span><br>
"May have" spotted them?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Janus：</span><br>
Mhm. She said they are like, quote, "a flock of sparrows laying waste to a wheat field"...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Albion：</span><br>
I see. It must be some sort of code. Elder Perseus is wise to encrypt her messages.<br>
If she has spotted them then it is only a matter of time before they spot her.<br>
In other words, we must hurry. Onwards to the coordinates she sent!<br>

Fight On, Royal Maids! (Part 3)<br>
<br>
3 Manchester's Peculiar Tastes<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Albion：</span><br>
Elder Perseus! We've come to aid you!<br>
<br>
Albion and Centaur draw their bows and launch their aircraft skywards, joining the battle with the enemy's own aircraft.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Perseus ：</span><br>
Wow, they're like a swarm of locusts fighting over territory.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Albion：</span><br>
Didn't you liken them to a flock of sparrows earlier?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Perseus ：</span><br>
Same idea. Fun fact about locusts: they're actually regular grasshoppers who undergo physical change and turn into locusts when the conditions are right.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Albion：</span><br>
Really?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Manchester：</span><br>
Yeah! I've heard about that.<br>
They make a decent snack, too. But they taste nasty when they swarm, so remember to go for the solitary ones.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Janus：</span><br>
People... eat locusts?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Manchester：</span><br>
Well, yeah? You never had one?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Centaur：</span><br>
If I may, I've never considered the idea either.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Albion：</span><br>
Neither have I...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Manchester：</span><br>
So I'm the only one? That's a bummer, innit.<br>
I was gonna offer to make some for ya after the exercise, but Belfast has banned me from doing that...<br>
See, I made a plate for her once. She had one bite and told me to never cook again.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Perseus ：</span><br>
The most objectively correct decision I've ever heard, hones–<br>
Owch! Hey! They just scored a hit on me!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Centaur：</span><br>
It would seem they've broken through. Our carrier Elders are truly living up to their reputation!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Albion：</span><br>
We must not let them hit us again. Elders, enter a circular formation and neutralise the remaining fighter planes!<br>
Remember, their task force members aren't used to each other's doctrines. We are better coordinated than them.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Manchester：</span><br>
So teamwork is our key to victory, yeah? Tell ya what, I've got a plan...<br>

<br>
Fight On, Royal Maids! (Part 3)<br>
<br>
4 The Ruse Cruise<br>
Somewhere in the Exercise Area...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Reno：</span><br>
Enemy ships spotted! They're heading straight for us.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Jervis：</span><br>
I'd suspect they'll try to disrupt our formation while we're unable to respond immediately.<br>
It's a reckless plan. Only Manchester could've come up with that.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Manchester：</span><br>
It's not reckless! At least call it "brave"!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Jervis：</span><br>
Well, I suppose charging right at us with only Janus for backup is nothing if not brave to a fault.<br>
Regardless, I'm afraid it's not going to work. Reno?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Reno：</span><br>
I agree. We've got planes on the way, so surrendering would be your best choice here.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Manchester：</span><br>
Planes on the way? Heheh...<br>
Our sides both have the same aviation strength to make it a fair fight. You can't have planes on the way if they're already all locked in a dogfight.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Reno：</span><br>
Huh? But Impero said she'd send some. Hang on, I'll have to check with Intrepid...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Manchester：</span><br>
Now's our chance, Janus! Full speed ahead!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Janus：</span><br>
R-right! Sorry, Jervis, but I'm coming through!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Reno：</span><br>
Wait, wha–? Jervis, stop them!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Jervis：</span><br>
...Dang it! It's too late to catch up to her now.<br>
I can't believe you fooled us with that bald-faced lie...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Manchester：</span><br>
When the enemy shows you their weakness, you've gotta exploit it!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Impero：</span><br>
Uh, Reno, Jervis? There's a destroyer coming towards me.<br>
Without you to watch my flanks, I'm kind of a sitting duck here, sooo... send help.<br>
<br>
Impero radioed for help in a lazy tone. Jervis turned off her communicator without a word.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Reno：</span><br>
...Jervis? Aren't you gonna help Impero?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Jervis：</span><br>
There's little I can do for her. By the time I catch up to Janus, it'll already be too late.<br>
What we should do is keep Manchester preoccupied so at least she can't come any closer to our carriers.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Manchester：</span><br>
Smart move, but that means we'll be staring each other down until the exercise ends, dunnit.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Reno：</span><br>
Welp. I think we've pretty much lost already...<br>

<br>
5 The Victor is Determined<br>
Later, after the exercise's conclusion...<br>
"The exercise was a great success. The Royal Navy, Eagle Union, and Sardegna Empire all fought brilliantly and learned much from each other, both as combatants and as allies."<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Queen Elizabeth：</span><br>
Yes, yes, but who won? You can't just leave that out!<br>
<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项1："The team with a Royal Maid trainee."</span>'''''<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项2："The team with a Royal Navy destroyer."</span>'''''<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Queen Elizabeth：</span><br>
Ah, that clears up the ambiguity... NOT!<br>
Both teams had one of those, you dolt!<br>
<br>
"Does it really matter that much who won? It's not like your reputation is at stake since you didn't participate."<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Queen Elizabeth：</span><br>
Well, yes, that is true... but it DOES affect my reputation as a leader whether or not the Royal Maids brought home the victory.<br>
<br>
"It's not about victory or defeat, it's about the journey."<br>
*knock knock*<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Albion：</span><br>
Commander, may I come in? ...Oh, excuse me for interrupting your conversation.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Queen Elizabeth：</span><br>
You're excused. My servant and I are done talking. Go on, tell us why you're here.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Albion：</span><br>
Thank you, Your Majesty. I've brought the exercise after-action report. Please give it a look.<br>
<br>
Albion hands me the report. I start flipping through the pages.<br>
There's quite a lot to read. Her reports are always much, much more lengthy and detailed than everyone else's.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Albion：</span><br>
Now if you'll excuse me, I'll be taking my leave. I hope you can both attend our celebratory banquet later in the evening.<br>
<br>
"Wait, celebratory banquet?"<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Queen Elizabeth：</span><br>
You can bet on it. I'll personally ensure my servant here doesn't get caught up in work and lose track of time.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Albion：</span><br>
Wonderful, Your Majesty. I'll be waiting for you at the venue! There will also be a lavish feast, courtesy of Elder Manchester.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Queen Elizabeth：</span><br>
...On second thought, I'll go right now! As the banquet organiser, I must be on location to ensure everything goes swimmingly.<br>
Albion, you'll stay here and see to it that my servant makes it to the banquet on time.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Albion：</span><br>
Very well, Your Majesty... Are you certain the Commander won't mind?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Queen Elizabeth：</span><br>
Quite certain! My servant wouldn't object!<br>
