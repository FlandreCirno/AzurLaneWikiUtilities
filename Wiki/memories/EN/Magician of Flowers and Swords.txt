1 Dancing Fingers<br>
Port - Commander's Office<br>
My office is usually a solemn place dedicated to handling port affairs, but in this moment, there's a cheerful and excited air.<br>
I watch Fleuret's hands sweep over the cards, backed by her lively laughter.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Fleuret：</span><br>
You ready, Commander?<br>
This time, I'm really gonna astonish and amaze you!<br>
If I do, then you have to do a special favor for me, okay?<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
How about you just tell me what you want? I'm willing to give it some thought, assuming it isn't something weird.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Fleuret：</span><br>
Hmmmm... No deal! It's way more fun if it's all magical and mysterious, you know?<br>
Now let's get this show on the road!<br>
First, pick a card and commit it to memory. Try not to take too long.<br>
<br>
After making the decision on her own, she puts five cards down on my desk.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
(Which one will it be?)<br>
<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项1：(Pick one card at random.)</span>'''''<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项2：(Memorize all of them.)</span>'''''<br>

'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项1）</span>'''''Okay, I'm ready.<br>
<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项1）</span>'''''She quickly collects the cards, shuffles them in an overly flashy manner, and stacks them in her hand.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Fleuret：</span><br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项1）</span>'''''Behold! The cards of fate have been arranged!<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项1）</span>'''''Focus your mind, Commander, and envision the card that you chose.<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项1）</span>'''''I will then read your very mind and reveal its secrets!<br>
<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项1）</span>'''''The magician closes her eyes and theatrically holds the stack of cards to her forehead. I can almost believe that she is reading my mind.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Fleuret：</span><br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项1）</span>'''''I've got it! Your card is...<br>
<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项1）</span>'''''She draws a single card and throws the others face down onto the table.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Fleuret：</span><br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项1）</span>'''''Heheh! I've got it! I could sense the whole of your mind focused on this one card!<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项1）</span>'''''Now, Commander, would you like to tell me your card?<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项1）</span>'''''The five of hearts.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Fleuret：</span><br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项1）</span>'''''Heh... Tadaaa! It's neither of these! Incredible, right?<br>
<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项1）</span>'''''She flips over the cards on my desk one after another, revealing a four of diamonds, five of clubs, seven of spades, and eight of hearts.<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项1）</span>'''''Indeed, the five of hearts is gone.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项1）</span>'''''Wow.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Fleuret：</span><br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项1）</span>'''''D-did it really work?! That look on your face was... It was genuine astonishment, wasn't it?! AND amazement!<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项1）</span>'''''...Yeah. You really impressed me.<br>

<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Fleuret：</span><br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项2）</span>'''''Huh? Swap the what? What are you talking about?<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项2）</span>'''''Hmm... None of the cards you showed me before are here. Not the five of hearts, and certainly none of the other four.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Fleuret：</span><br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项2）</span>'''''Urk... Y-you got me...<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项2）</span>'''''BUT! You were still astonished and amazed by my sleight of hand, weren't you?<br>

That means you have to do a special favor for me! Okay, get ready...<br>
I want you to go on stage and do a magic show with me!<br>

<br>
2 Secret Sanctuary<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Okay, so... How exactly are we supposed to find props for the show?<br>
<br>
As I follow Fleuret's light, rhythmical steps, I ask a question that's been on my mind.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Fleuret：</span><br>
Heheh, they're all in my secret sanctuary, of course!<br>
And it's exactly where I wanted to take you today, Commander!<br>
<br>
When she opens the door, I'm overwhelmed by the combined scent of old wood, cloth, and paper.<br>
Though the room is dimly lit, the items lined up inside are dazzling.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Is this like a warehouse?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Fleuret：</span><br>
Ding-ding! It's a storage room for my magic props!<br>
Look! This is a box you use for the Sub Trunk illusion! And that prop is for putting coins through glass!<br>
Every single prop here has its own unique function.<br>
<br>
While she explains it all, curiosity drives me over to a very plain-looking wooden cane.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
What about this cane? It looks pretty normal to me.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Fleuret：</span><br>
Heheh! That one has a secret compartment with a bouquet of flowers inside!<br>
<br>
She rushes over, takes my hand, and has me grasp the handle.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Fleuret：</span><br>
Take this, twist a little, and...<br>
<br>
Poof! Out comes a bouquet of bright-red roses. At the same time, a smile blooms on Fleuret's face.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Fleuret：</span><br>
Hmm? Something wrong, Commander? What's with the suspicious look?<br>
VERY suspicious... Wait a minute, I know what this is.<br>
You must have a crush on this glorious magician!<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
I was just struck by how happy you are.<br>
All of these props of yours seem so... professional. By the way, which ones are we using for the show?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Fleuret：</span><br>
Umm...<br>
<br>
Her expression turns serious as she approaches a large, old-fashioned box. It's black and heavy-looking.<br>
The surface is wrapped in worn leather with inlaid brass latches and hinges. Several small holes are also poked in the sides, likely for air flow.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Is that it? No wonder you came to me for help. That thing even LOOKS heavy.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Fleuret：</span><br>
It was used for escape magic, so it's made to be super sturdy. There are some mechanisms on the inside that make it so you can open it from within.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
So the plan is to use this to show off your escape magic?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Fleuret：</span><br>
No... Not quite. The essence of magic isn't all found in elaborate contrivances.<br>
It's like the card trick from earlier. What matters isn't the cards themselves, but the surprise and mystery they evoke.<br>
Props are only there as a bridge to help the magician convey those feelings.<br>
That's not to say they're meaningless. Higher-quality props help make the magic more exciting and communicate the magician's intentions better.<br>
Back on topic, though... It's thick enough, the construction is simple, and most of all...<br>
Look how spacious it is! This bad boy could fit TWO Commanders in it!<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
True... Wait, don't tell me.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Fleuret：</span><br>
Heheheh! Have you pieced together the incredible trick we're going to perform?<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
I have a feeling...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Fleuret：</span><br>
Oh really? Maybe you do have what it takes to be a master magician!<br>
You've already read my mind, after all.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Alright, spill the beans. What's it going to be?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Fleuret：</span><br>
Heheh... Tell me, are you ready to get stabbed in the heart?<br>

<br>
3 A Floral Stage<br>
With the magic tricks for the show planned out, we took the box to a secluded garden.<br>
The afternoon sun cast dappled shadows through the branches and leaves, and the wind carried the scent of flowers.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Fleuret：</span><br>
Look, Commander! This is the stage I chose!<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
You're going to do it here in the garden?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Fleuret：</span><br>
Yep. The sunlight, breeze, and flowers make for a more relaxing stage than even the most elegant auditoriums.<br>
I think the sheer wonder of magic will stand out better here than anywhere else.<br>
Besides, don't you think the lighting is perfect for a sort of mysterious mood?<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Is the mood that important for this kind of trick?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Fleuret：</span><br>
Of course! Mood-making is one of the most important parts of magic.<br>
Even thrilling tricks like my Commander Heart-Stabberoo are no exception.<br>
<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项1：Scary name...</span>'''''<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项2：Wasn't it called the Sword Box illusion?</span>'''''<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项1）</span>'''''Scary name... Any chance we can change it?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Fleuret：</span><br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项1）</span>'''''Heheh, nope! That's how magic tricks are supposed to be named.<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项1）</span>'''''Like "sawing a woman in half" or "water torture escape." Simple, easy to remember, AND attention-grabbing!<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项2）</span>'''''Wasn't it called the Sword Box illusion? Why are we going and changing the established name now?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Fleuret：</span><br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项2）</span>'''''It's a little different! Because I specifically wanna pierce your heart!<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项2）</span>'''''Heheh. Just wait and see!<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Am I in danger?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Fleuret：</span><br>
Don't worry! I carefully calculated the holes' positions before making them, so you'll definitely be safe!<br>
All you have to do is stand exactly where I marked.<br>
Then, I'll use these sharp-looking prop swords to stab stickers that I've put over the holes...<br>
Stab! Stab! Stab! By the time I'm done, the box will look like a hedgehog from the outside, and people will think I've run you through!<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
But in reality, the swords will be inserted diagonally to create a safe space inside... right?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Fleuret：</span><br>
You got it! I'll take the swords out, open the box, and bam! The Commander's alive and well!<br>
Everyone in the crowd will be astonished!<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Fleuret：</span><br>
Quit worrying so much! This might be my first time doing this trick, but magic tricks are basically all the same when you get right down to it!<br>
I'm REALLY looking forward to getting to put on a show with you, okay?<br>
But we can't show everyone else yet. Not until it's perfect.<br>
So Commander... Today, you're gonna be my personal assistant and guinea pig!<br>
We're gonna practice, practice, practice here in this secret location until we've had it down pat.<br>
Until I can guarantee that you can come out without a scratch, AND have fun doing it!<br>
Because that's the most important part of a magic show – even more important than the audience's applause!<br>

<br>
4 Precise Positioning<br>
After a full afternoon of preparation, we managed to set up a simple but convincing stage and curtain in the garden.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Fleuret：</span><br>
Phew... Stage, check! Curtain, check! Lighting... Hmm, natural will do!<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
It sure feels like a magic show now. I'm glad our efforts were worthwhile.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Fleuret：</span><br>
Heheh. A stage is a bridge between the magician and their audience.<br>
From the curtains and lights to every word they say, all of it carries the intention of conveying wonder to the viewer.<br>
It's really touching... to see this empty space gradually turned into one that carries the potential of magic.<br>
Commander, thank you so much for helping me create this wonderful stage! Hehe... What kind of reward would you like?<br>
<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项1：If you're happy, I'm happy.</span>'''''<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项2：I'll have to think about that.</span>'''''<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项1）</span>'''''If you're happy, I'm happy. That said, it still looks far from complete...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Fleuret：</span><br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项1）</span>'''''Don't worry about it! You've already done enough for me.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项2）</span>'''''A reward, huh? I'll have to think about that.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Fleuret：</span><br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项2）</span>'''''Hehe! Take your time. When you have an idea, you know where to find me.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Fleuret：</span><br>
Now, we still need to do the most important part: setting up this magic box in the right position!<br>
Tricks hit best if they're positioned just right.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
I'm ready! Let's carry it up to the stage together.<br>
<br>
The box is heavier than I expected, but with her help, we slowly but surely begin carrying it to the middle of the stage.<br>
She carefully walks backward with it, all the while thinking of our coming rehearsals.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Fleuret：</span><br>
When we rehearse later, I'll call out, "Assistant!" That's when you come out from behind the curtain and get into the box. Make it a little theatrical, okay?<br>
I'll stand right here and strike a cool pose with my sword...<br>
<br>
Perhaps too focused on her plans, Fleuret trips over a board protruding slightly from the stage floor!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Fleuret：</span><br>
Ack!<br>
<br>
She screams, loses her balance, and nearly falls...<br>
Though she tries to hold the box tight to right herself, that only ends up dragging it along with her to the ground.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Fleuret?! Oh, man!<br>
<br>
It all happened so fast. I tried to catch her by the hand, but before I knew it, her momentum pulled us both straight into the open box.<br>
Due to the impact of the fall, the lid slams shut with a shudder-inducing click.<br>
Then it all ends, and the box is filled with nothing but stifling darkness and silence.<br>
I'm half on top of Fleuret. In this cramped space, we can only hear each other's ragged breathing.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Fleuret：</span><br>
C-Commander? Are you okay?!<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Yeah... I'm fine.<br>
Don't panic! Let's assess the situation.<br>
<br>
I manage to calm her down, straighten up, and push on the lid of the box. However, it doesn't budge no matter how much force I put into it.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Are we... locked in here?<br>

Magician of Flowers and Swords<br>
<br>
5 Alone in a Black Box<br>
In the small, dark box, the air gradually becomes thick and hot.<br>
Fleuret's basically in my arms at this point. Though the initial panic has subsided a little, we can't help but blush at the situation.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Fleuret：</span><br>
*sniffle*... I promised I'd show you the coolest magic trick ever, but now... it's all ruined.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Don't worry about it – I know it was an accident. Besides, this is plenty astonishing.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Fleuret：</span><br>
Are you making fun of me right now?<br>
You're not wrong, though... Who knew I'd end up locked in the box I made? And with you, at that... Uuugh...<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Like I said, it's fine. Everybody makes mistakes.<br>
Are you scared of the dark, by chance?<br>
<br>
Why do I ask? Well, she grabbed my hand the moment we got locked inside, and she hasn't let go since.<br>
After a while, I'd decided to return the favor to reassure her.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
It's normal to feel apprehensive when you're stuck in a dark place and can't get out.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Fleuret：</span><br>
That's not it... I was scared before, yeah, but not because it was dark.<br>
What I'm really afraid of... is for something we both worked so hard on to be wasted all because of my stupid mistake.<br>
<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项1：That won't happen.</span>'''''<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项2：Don't worry.</span>'''''<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项1）</span>'''''That won't happen. All we have to do is find a way out of this.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项2）</span>'''''Don't worry. We'll get out of here.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Fleuret：</span><br>
Okay... I think I see why the best magicians need serious mental fortitude.<br>
When the curtain rises, the spotlights turn on, and all eyes gather on you... The sheer pressure of having to meet their expectations and fear of the unknown... That's what really makes you feel locked up.<br>
But holding your hand now, I know I'm not alone. It helps me feel at ease.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Maybe that's why the best magicians need assistants.<br>
Not just to draw the audience's attention, but to share the heavy loneliness that comes from being on stage and not knowing what might go wrong.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Fleuret：</span><br>
To share the loneliness? That's one way to put it... A really devious way...<br>
<br>
In the darkness, I fail to see the bashful, yet happy smile on her face.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Fleuret... Are you sure we can't open this from the inside?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Fleuret：</span><br>
Well... It's made for escape tricks.<br>
So it's impossible to force open the main lock from the inside! That's like the whole gimmick!<br>
<br>
Her voice regains its usual vitality, but it still has a faint, embarrassed tremble to it.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Fleuret：</span><br>
But a TRUE escape artist would always leave a loophole! Remember that little mechanism I mentioned?<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
What mechanism?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Fleuret：</span><br>
One to open a secret door, of course. Right below me... There's a small board you can move. It needs a special key, though.<br>
A-and, well... The key is in a secret pocket in the lining of my jacket...<br>
<br>
After much hesitation, she reluctantly produces a noticeably warm key.<br>

Commander... The keyhole should be... behind you.<br>
<br>
In the darkness, she leans forward. As she fumbles the key into the hole, her bewitchingly warm breath tickles my ears.<br>

Magician of Flowers and Swords<br>
<br>
6 Pierced Through the Heart<br>
With a gentle click, the secret door on the bottom of the box opens.<br>
A flowery scent and cool night air flow into the cramped space, relieving us of the stifling air from before.<br>
Fleuret scrambles out of the box, sucks in a deep breath of fresh air, looks up at the sky – and screams.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Fleuret：</span><br>
Wha?! I-it's already dark out!<br>
Oh, no! We haven't even rehearsed yet! Commander, we're running out of time! We're gonna have to go do it off the cuff!<br>
<br>
As soon as I crawl out, she seizes my arm and drags me behind the curtains.<br>
In the dark of early night, her cheeks are still flushed – but her eyes gleam with the confidence and excitement of a master magician.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Fleuret：</span><br>
Have faith in me! Just like you did in the box!<br>
All you have to do now is follow my orders.<br>
Let's make tonight a miracle together!<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Alright!<br>
<br>
After that, she rushes onto the stage like a gust of wind.<br>
With an elegant twirl, she puts on a show for an audience of none – or rather, an audience of the flowers and stars.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Fleuret：</span><br>
Ladies and gentlemen, and our dearest Commander!<br>
Welcome to Fleuret's Night of Miracles! Prepare to witness the thrilling sight of countless swords piercing one heart!<br>
Assistant, please step into this box! Yes, right now!<br>
Well done! Now, if you'd please lean to the left a little... Lower your head... Good! Yes, that angle is perfect! Just trust me.<br>
Let the first sword pierce illusions!<br>
Let the second pierce fear!<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Two right off the bat?! This isn't what I was led to expect!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Fleuret：</span><br>
Worry not! These two are only meant to frame the following ones! As long as you don't touch them, none of the others will hit you.<br>
<br>
Before she even finishes speaking, wooden swords pierce through the holes in the box one after another.<br>
From the outside, it must really look like a hedgehog!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Fleuret：</span><br>
Now, Commander, lean left a little. Remember to steady your center of gravity!<br>
<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项1：Left, huh...</span>'''''<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项2：Which way is left, again?</span>'''''<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项1）</span>'''''Left, huh... Like this?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Fleuret：</span><br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项1）</span>'''''Perfect!<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项1）</span>'''''See? We're totally in tune with each other!<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项2）</span>'''''Which way is left, again?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Fleuret：</span><br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项2）</span>'''''If you're nervous, then just trust your intuition!<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项2）</span>'''''Yeah, just like that... You're doing great, Commander!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Fleuret：</span><br>
Let the seventh sword bear witness to indomitable courage!<br>
And finally... Close your eyes, and listen to your heart...<br>
<br>
She takes a sweeping look across the garden, inhales deeply, and stabs the last sword. Her voice is a mix of excitement and just the slightest tinge of nervousness.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Fleuret：</span><br>
Let the final sword pierce the dark and usher in a miracle!<br>
Now, let us welcome the hero's safe return!<br>
Commander, take my hand! Together, we'll meet their applause! Well, except for the fact that there's nobody around except the moon and flowers.<br>
<br>
I take her hand without hesitation, and she guides me out of the box.<br>
Even when I'm on my feet again, she doesn't let go – in fact, she holds on tighter. Meanwhile, she raises her other hand high to point at our surroundings.<br>
Then, like a magician finally unveiling her secrets, she speaks up with tenderness and pride.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Fleuret：</span><br>
Commander, look! That's the real magic I prepared just for you – the Commander Heart-Stabberoo!<br>
<br>
When I cast my eyes over the garden again, the sight takes my breath away.<br>

<br>
Magician of Flowers and Swords<br>
<br>
7 Swords, Flowers, and You<br>
Buds and vines that had been closed and drooping earlier today begin standing upright and blooming beneath the moonlight, right before my very eyes.<br>
Beautiful white flowers bloom in unison, exuding a soft luster and comforting scent.<br>
In the space of a few minutes, the entire garden is covered in countless moonflowers, like a river of moonlight spreading across the land.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Fleuret：</span><br>
So, Commander. Have the floral swords around us finally managed to pierce your heart?<br>
<br>
The moonlight washes over the sea of flowers and flows quietly around the two of us.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Fleuret：</span><br>
Heheh, do you like it? This is my real magic trick – making a whole garden of moonflowers bloom all at once.<br>
It's way more astonishing than that dumb old box, isn't it?<br>
I prepared this big trick just for you, just for tonight.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Was this your plan all along? You know, I had a feeling you were hiding something from me.<br>
<br>
When she sees my genuine surprise, Fleuret raises her index finger and wags it playfully.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Fleuret：</span><br>
Heheh! Do you get it now? A true magician can't be confined to simple props like boxes or swords!<br>
The moon, the earth, the dormant flowers... All of nature is my stage and my props!<br>
<br>
She takes a step forward and looks up to the sky. Moonlight flows into her eyes.<br>
The magician holds her arms out, as if picking up the entire garden, and gently brings it over to me.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Fleuret：</span><br>
This sea of moonflowers is my real present to you, Commander! It's unique, it's just for you, and it could've happened only tonight!<br>
What do you say? Isn't this magic a million times more moving than cold props and tricks?<br>
Tell me, is your heart pounding like a drum?<br>
<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项1：It was astonishing.</span>'''''<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项2：It was beautiful.</span>'''''<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项1）</span>'''''Yeah. It was astonishing... Thank you, Fleuret.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项2）</span>'''''Yeah. It was beautiful... Thank you, Fleuret.<br>
<br>
My words make her eyes sparkle even more.<br>
She sidles closer with exposed shyness and expectation.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Fleuret：</span><br>
Did you know, Commander? Every flower has its own unique meaning.<br>
Like a magician's hand gestures, they all have special little messages that only some people know...<br>
Try guessing... what the moonflowers here all mean to me...<br>
<br>
The wind stops, and the moonlight dims just a little. Our breathing and the gentle wavering of flowers were the only signs of motion in the garden.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
...I don't know. Why don't you tell me, magician of flowers and swords?<br>
<br>
She quietly releases my hand. While I watch her in surprise, she takes a half-step back.<br>
Then, she bows elegantly – not to an imaginary audience, but to me alone.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Fleuret：</span><br>
Moonflowers... symbolize a bond that will never falter.<br>
<br>
Fleuret straightens up again, places a hand on the hilt of her sword, and strokes a nearby flower with the other.<br>
Her posture is simultaneously reminiscent of that of a knight attending to her liege, and of a magician ready to reveal her final trick.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Fleuret：</span><br>
What I mean to say is...<br>
My sword, the flowers that have bloomed tonight, and my heart...<br>
All of them...<br>
I offer to you, Commander.<br>
That's the miracle I wanted you to witness♡<br>
