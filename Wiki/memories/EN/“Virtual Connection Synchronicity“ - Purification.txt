"Virtual Connection Synchronicity" - Purification<br>
<br>
Chapter 1 - Random Word Generator<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Kizuna AI：</span><br>
……<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ayanami：</span><br>
What are you doing, AI?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Kizuna AI：</span><br>
Ah! Ayanami. I was just trying to get rid of these viruses in my random word generator.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Javelin：</span><br>
AI, you know how to do stuff like that!?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Laffey：</span><br>
She's an Intelligent Super A.I.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Kizuna AI：</span><br>
Ahem! Yes... but it's kind of hard to do on my own. Can you guys help out?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Z23：</span><br>
Hmm. Virus removal is kind of hard, isn't it?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ayanami：</span><br>
I just treat it like a fun game.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Javelin：</span><br>
So I go like this or?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Kizuna AI：</span><br>
Right! You put this here annnd... bam!<br>
Thanks! That's one virus down. We'll wipe 'em out like this!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Inazuma：</span><br>
What's this...? Some kind of random word generator?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Kizuna AI：</span><br>
Oooh! We got some Kizuna Points! I'm sure you're familiar with the concept by now: you use these to get event limited items! ♪<br>
<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项1：Yeah! Let's go get those rewards!</span>'''''<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项2：How is it you know about points?</span>'''''<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Kizuna AI：</span><br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项1）</span>'''''Let's see... what should I get? How about a little "Pyoko-Pyoko" something something...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Inazuma：</span><br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项1）</span>'''''I like the look of those "Mental Units."<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ikazuchi：</span><br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项1）</span>'''''I want some gold equipment boxes, and not the repainted ones!!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Kizuna AI：</span><br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项1）</span>'''''Nice! Let's keep knocking out those viruses and earn those Kizuna Points! ♪<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Kizuna AI：</span><br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项2）</span>'''''Simple! I was a commander myself back where I'm from! A survivor of countless hard-fought battles!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ikazuchi：</span><br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项2）</span>'''''Wow! So you were just like our Commander!?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Inazuma：</span><br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项2）</span>'''''Miss AI's true form is that of the Commander... I never would have guessed.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Kizuna AI：</span><br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项2）</span>'''''Anyway, now that we know how important these Kizuna Points are, let's make sure we collect tons of 'em! ♪<br>
<br>
*shutter click*<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Kizuna AI：</span><br>
Who's taking pictures!?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Gridley：</span><br>
Hi there! You're that Genius Super A.I. from the virtual world, right? Kizuna AI? I'm Gridley!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Kizuna AI：</span><br>
Genius!? Y- yeah! That's me!!<br>
I'm that Intelligent Super A.I. everybody's talking about. Me. Kizuna AI. Nice to meet you.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Z23：</span><br>
I see you're out taking photos, Miss Gridley, were you not given a mission today?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Gridley：</span><br>
Actually, Laffey asked for my help recording and preserving our time with Kizuna AI. I'm hunting for the perfect shot!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Kizuna AI：</span><br>
Oh? Laffey-chan asked you!?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Laffey：</span><br>
Gridley... is the worst spy...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Gridley：</span><br>
Sorry! My bad! I tried to keep it a secret, but she is a Super A.I., you know!?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Kizuna AI：</span><br>
Hah hah hah! It's true. No one can hide from my sight.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Gridley：</span><br>
Hehehe! And I always aim for the perfect shot, so it's no big deal.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Kizuna AI：</span><br>
Well, just make sure I look cute and we won't have a problem.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Gridley：</span><br>
You got it!<br>

"Virtual Connection Synchronicity" - Purification<br>
<br>
Chapter 2 - The Fine Line Between Moron and Genius<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Kizuna AI：</span><br>
Yo, Commander! It's a new day and let's keep at the virus cleaning. Yeah! Woo! Alright!<br>
<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项1：Yeah! Woo! Alright!</span>'''''<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项2：Uhh... I have a lot to do today actually...</span>'''''<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Kizuna AI：</span><br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项1）</span>'''''You're getting into it! I like that. Let's get started!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Kizuna AI：</span><br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项2）</span>'''''Huhhh? But I thought you almost finished your work for the day~? *glares*<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项2）</span>'''''Am I a joke to you? I know your whole schedule, Commander!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Kizuna AI：</span><br>
Just chill. Today's viruses ain't nothin', a walk in the damned park, easiest viruses of your life, hands down. Just knock 'em out and then we'll kick back!<br>
<br>
One Hour Later<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Kizuna AI：</span><br>
*Pant*... *pant...* but... how... why.... this was just level 2... how were they... so... tough... *collapse*<br>
<br>
Perhaps as a consequence of her drive and intensity, Kizuna AI fell into despair.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Kizuna AI：</span><br>
Ughhh! I'm so ti~red~! It doesn't make any sense! I'm trying so hard!<br>
<br>
This virus cleaning mission, it looked so easy at first, but proved impossibly hard. Could this really be a level 2 difficulty job...?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">San Diego：</span><br>
Heyooo! Is that Boss Lady Kizuna AI!? What are you doing? You can't take a nap here, you'll catch a cold. Don't you know anything?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Kizuna AI：</span><br>
Oh, San Diego. I'm not napping. I was trying to clean viruses, but I totally failed...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">San Diego：</span><br>
O~kay? Cleaning buy-rests...? Sounds hella fun~!<br>
<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项1：You wanna try, San Diego?</span>'''''<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项2：Aye-aye... take it away...</span>'''''<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">San Diego：</span><br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项1）</span>'''''Huh? Hell yeah! I'm gonna try really hard!!!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">San Diego：</span><br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项2）</span>'''''Commander! What's wrong!?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Kizuna AI：</span><br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项2）</span>'''''The Commander.... did a really good job...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">San Diego：</span><br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项2）</span>'''''All right, you just rest there for a bit~ I've got this one in the bag~!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Kizuna AI：</span><br>
But are you gonna be okay? This one is crazy hard!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">San Diego：</span><br>
Uh huh! No clue if I can do it or not, but I'm gonna try!<br>
<br>
Is it really okay to rely on San Diego like this...?<br>
35 Seconds Later<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">San Diego：</span><br>
Uhhh... so like I do this? And then that one I just... Oh. Now this one's gone too?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Kizuna AI：</span><br>
San Diego!? Is thi- did you actually clear the viruses!!??<br>
<br>
But... how... did she.......?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">San Diego：</span><br>
Wha? It's all over? But I'm not done playing~!!<br>
<br>
And so, by pointing randomly at things she did not understand, San Diego completely eliminated the viruses.<br>
Don't ask me. Even I don't understand how it works....<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Kizuna AI：</span><br>
Thank you so much, San Diego!! You're incredible! You're a genius, San Diego!<br>
You knocked it out so fast! Can we have San Diego handle all the virus removal from now on!?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">San Diego：</span><br>
Sure! Just leave it all to San Diego~!<br>
<br>
Can San Diego really handle all of that by herself....?<br>

"Virtual Connection Synchronicity" - Purification<br>
<br>
Chapter 3 -  Red Alert!?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Kizuna AI：</span><br>
Virus removal complete! You've really gotten the hang of this, Commander!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ikazuchi：</span><br>
Hey, what's that coming out of the random word generator?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Kizuna AI：</span><br>
Oooh? Th- this is...! A "random word!!!"<br>
<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项1：And what exactly is it for?</span>'''''<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Kizuna AI：</span><br>
Excellent question! As the name suggests, this is a handy little box for generating random words!<br>
That's what it's supposed to be anyway, but it's somehow built connections and converted matter into data, crystallizing into a super technology!<br>
Incidentally, I made this.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ikazuchi：</span><br>
Like... why would you want to generate random words though?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Kizuna AI：</span><br>
Er... yeah... like... for example...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Inazuma：</span><br>
Terrible. Even though it's our day off, we've been ordered to clean up flotsam and jetsam around the port.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Kizuna AI：</span><br>
Wow! That sounds really urgent...<br>
Hey! Why don't I show you what the random word generator can do by using it to solve this little predicament!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ikazuchi：</span><br>
Oh I know! This is what they call "pulling it out of your ass," right?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Kizuna AI：</span><br>
We can use the words generated by the random word generator to plan and name a crisis management sys-<br>
"AI-CHAN, RED ALERT!"<br>
All right, let's see what we've got. Heeere it comes.....! "Ramune"! You're a hungry fella today, huh?<br>
Seems pretty useless actually. Okay, Ikazuchi-chan, let's see what you pull!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ikazuchi：</span><br>
'kay! Drum roll, please...... "Oxy-Cola?" Is it only food in there? Inazuma, you're up!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Inazuma：</span><br>
Right. What is it... hmm.... "Manjuu" is it? At least it's a little more helpful than the food words?<br>
Okay but what's the point of Manjuu and "Ramune" and Oxy-Cola together, how do they help?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ikazuchi：</span><br>
Oh I know! This is what they call "the dark souls of video games!" There's no way I can figure this out!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Kizuna AI：</span><br>
"Ramune," "Oxy-Cola," "Manjuu".... Eureka!<br>
First, let's put the "Ramune" into the Oxy-Cola and cover it. Then have one of those boats bring us a Manjuu.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ikazuchi：</span><br>
Oh I know! I've heard that if you put "Ramune" in "Oxy-Cola" and seal it up, it'll explode!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Kizuna AI：</span><br>
Then, if we take all that Ramune-filled "Oxy-Cola" and load it into a boat piloted by a Manjuu...<br>
KABOOM!<br>
Disaster averted~!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Inazuma：</span><br>
...just a moment. While this "Cola Bomb" does indeed sound spectacular, does it truly have the power to annihilate the flotsam and jetsam...?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ikazuchi：</span><br>
That's right... and we shouldn't bully the Manjuu! NO BULLYING!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Kizuna AI：</span><br>
Urk. You're not wrong.... all right then!<br>
Okay, let's give the ramune and the Oxy-Cola to the Manjuu and gather up all the girls we can!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Inazuma：</span><br>
I suppose there was no other way this could have ended...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Kizuna AI：</span><br>
Thanks for your help, everybody! Let's all work together to get this done! LET'S GOOOOO!<br>

Chapter 4 -  Until We Meet Again<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Kizuna AI：</span><br>
Aaannnnd... done! There we go! We eliminated all the viruses!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Akashi：</span><br>
Nya! I looked into it and I found an internal connyection between Kizuna AI and the random word genyerator nya!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Yuubari：</span><br>
Seems only Kizuna AI can pass through it? Hrmmm... I'm so curious about that other world!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Inazuma：</span><br>
I suppose this means AI can finally go home now. The time really flew right by, but it was fun.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Javelin：</span><br>
Please have a safe trip home, AI. And I swear I'll never forget you as long as I live!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ayanami：</span><br>
I'm expecting you to frag out in those games of yours.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ikazuchi：</span><br>
Good luck with your "tubing" and "streaming!"<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Inazuma：</span><br>
Do make sure to visit us in your world from time to time.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Kizuna AI：</span><br>
Yeah! I'll never forget you guys!<br>
Oh, right! I'd be so glad if you thought of me while redecorating the dormitory!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Z23：</span><br>
This is an... easel? Thank you very much. I will ask the commander to redecorate appropriately.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Laffey：</span><br>
Thanks.... I could never forget... AI.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Prinz Eugen：</span><br>
Brief though our time together was, I certainly had fun. Your... Kizuna Fleet, was it? We appreciate what you did.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">San Diego：</span><br>
Boss Lady Kizuna AI, I'll put all the things you taught me to good use. Look out for VTuber San Diego because I'm comin' at ya! You keep at it too, boss!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Fortune：</span><br>
I know we- we're fated to meet again!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Shoukaku：</span><br>
Don't worry about a thing. We'll take care of it. Hehehe ♪<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Takao：</span><br>
While I regret that I cannot see you back to your own world, Lady AI, I look forward to the day we meet again.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Kizuna AI：</span><br>
Yeah! I'll treasure the memories I made here forever. Take care, everyone! I'll watch over you through the game when I get back to my world!<br>
<br>
..........<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Kizuna AI：</span><br>
I'm definitely going to see you all again so I won't say goodbye. I LOVE YOU ALL!!!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Javelin：</span><br>
"I won't say goodbye..." Yes! You're right! I can't wait to see you again!<br>
<br>
--And so, the Intelligent Super AI left a deep impression in the minds of all the denizens of the port.<br>
Carrying on with their hearts bound by the ties left by Kizuna AI, they looked forward to the day they would meet again--<br>
