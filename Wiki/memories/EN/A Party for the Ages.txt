A Party for the Ages<br>
<br>
1.A Morning Unlike Any Other<br>
Office - A morning like any other<br>
...Except it's actually not.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Seattle：</span><br>
Mornin', Commander!<br>
You had breakfast yet? If not, you want some of this?<br>
<br>
For whatever reason, Seattle forces a jianbing – a savory, crepe-like food from the Dragon Empery – into my hands.<br>
Since she became my secretary, every day has had its unique flavor – including breakfast as well.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Seattle：</span><br>
You know what they say, breakfast is the most important meal of the day!<br>
And you're gonna need the energy for Operation Extravaganza! By the by, how's the food?<br>
<br>
I wonder to myself what this "Operation Extravaganza" is as I sink my teeth into layers of fluffy egg, crispy youtiao, and savory black bean sauce.<br>
<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项1："Wow, that was delicious!"</span>'''''<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项2："Where'd you get this from?"</span>'''''<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Seattle：</span><br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项1）</span>'''''Mhm! Had a feeling you'd dig it!<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项1）</span>'''''I bought it from that Empery street food stall Ning Hai and friends started. Been hearing good stuff about 'em.<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项1）</span>'''''Apparently Sardegna's expanding their menu too, so we're gonna have like, a bajillion breakfast items to choose from!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Seattle：</span><br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项2）</span>'''''The jianbing? Picked it up from Ning Hai and Ping Hai's recently-opened Dragon Empery street food stall. It's been all the rage recently!<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项2）</span>'''''Apparently, the Sardegna girls are trying to expand their offerings to compete with them, so we're gonna have like, a bajillion breakfast items to choose from soon!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Seattle：</span><br>
That settles it! Tomorrow, let's grab some Sardegnian colazione!<br>
<br>
"Now that you mention it, it does feel like there's been a flood of new breakfast options lately."<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Seattle：</span><br>
You betcha. Oh, that reminds me!<br>
I was gonna tell you about Operation Extravaganza!<br>
<br>
Right. I almost forgot about that.<br>
<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项1："I'm listening."</span>'''''<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Seattle：</span><br>
So, I've been planning this bangin' event for the next time a holiday rolls around!<br>
The elevator pitch is this – let's give the port a makeover, with all the entertainment you can imagine!<br>
You want the deets? I've got you.<br>
<br>
BAM! She drops a thick, leather-bound project folder onto my desk.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Seattle：</span><br>
It's gonna be SO lit! You on board, Commander?<br>
...You mean it? Aw yeah, then let's get this show on the road!<br>
<br>
I give her a nod, and the very next moment, she drags me out of the office.<br>

2.Operation Extravaganza<br>
Several days pass. I'm walking down the road when I notice something odd.<br>
Neon lights, strung up in the trees on both sides of me.<br>
<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项1："What in the world is going on here...?"</span>'''''<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项2："Are these party decorations?"</span>'''''<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Seattle：</span><br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项1）</span>'''''The lights? Can't you tell, they're totally party decorations.<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项1）</span>'''''You know, like in the project folder? The one you greenlit, remember?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Seattle：</span><br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项2）</span>'''''Yup, they sure are!<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项2）</span>'''''Ain't that kinda obvious? You're the one who approved 'em!<br>
<br>
"Did I?"<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Seattle：</span><br>
Well, yeah! It's all part of Operation Extravaganza! Don't tell me you forgot already~<br>
<br>
I rack my brain for a moment and vaguely remember her saying something about it the other day.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Seattle：</span><br>
These decorations are just like, phase one of the whole plan.<br>
And phase two, that's about... Ah, you probably don't remember.<br>
Actually, I wanna test your memory. Try to guess what it is.<br>
Whaddya call an event where people get together and have a hell of a time?<br>
<br>
Knowing her, I think I know the answer.<br>
<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项1："Is it... a party?"</span>'''''<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项2："A party, of course."</span>'''''<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项3："The best party the port's ever seen!"</span>'''''<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Seattle：</span><br>
Ding, ding, ding!<br>
And still I had to jog your memory... I know you're busy, but so busy you forgot what you even approved? You're overworking yourself.<br>
Good thing we have a holiday coming up so someone can force you to take a load off!<br>
That's what this party will be all about: giving everyone, including you, a venue to relax, drink, eat, or whatever floats your boat!<br>
The theme is like a world cruise, featuring all factions – from the Dragon Empery to Sardegna – and everyone's invited!<br>
Didn't plan it all myself, of course. Georgia helped me iron out some of the deets.<br>
<br>
"Such a big event needs a lot of food... Is that why you've had me try all those breakfast options?"<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Seattle：</span><br>
Bingo. You connected the dots! Hahaha!<br>

A Party for the Ages<br>
<br>
3.Setting the Mood<br>
I arrive at the party venue with Seattle to oversee the preparations being made.<br>
"So, what do we have to do today?"<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Seattle：</span><br>
First thing's first – setting the mood!<br>
Mood is the thing that makes or breaks a party, especially when it's a major, hyped-up event.<br>
Believe me, the mood is affected by all sorts of things. Everything from where you put tables, chairs, and decorations, to what chow is on the menu!<br>
And let's not forget the lighting and how it dims, brightens, or changes colors!<br>
<br>
She's very particular about the details, much like Hiei.<br>
"I love your enthusiasm, but we don't have all the manpower and resources in the world."<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Seattle：</span><br>
True... Even the Royal Maids' help won't be enough for what I'm thinking.<br>
This party needs something to take it to the next level. Something wacky and unexpected!<br>
Tell you what, I'll know it when I see it! Let's take a look around, Commander!<br>
<br>
Seattle and I finish inspecting the venue and go wandering around the port.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Vittorio Veneto：</span><br>
Oh dear... They've started fighting.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Leonardo da Vinci：</span><br>
So? Isn't that normal? Everyone knows cats and dogs are natural enemies.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Vittorio Veneto：</span><br>
Yes, but these creatures aren't exactly natural. Didn't you invent these Doggo Cattrons and Kitty Dogbots?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Littorio：</span><br>
Their cries are endearing, yet forceful. You might say Sardegna's glory has left a mark on them.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Seattle：</span><br>
That's it! I've figured out what the party needs! C'mere, Commander!<br>
Hello, my Sardegnian friends! Whatcha up to?<br>
Whoa! What's with the robot cats and dogs? Are they barking instead of meowing and vice versa?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Leonardo da Vinci：</span><br>
They sure are! Feast your eyes on my latest masterpiece!<br>
My Doggo Cattrons and Kitty Dogbots are a work of genius. Whether you're a cat or a dog person, you'll love these adorable robo-critters!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Seattle：</span><br>
I see... Pretty neat idea. On another note, I was gonna ask if you gals could help me out with something.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Leonardo da Vinci：</span><br>
Ah, you must need an exciting new invention for a party. Wait, are you throwing ANOTHER party?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Seattle：</span><br>
You bet! It's for our next port-wide holiday. Think you could help me out?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Vittorio Veneto：</span><br>
I'm sure we can assist somehow. But, what exactly is it that you need?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Seattle：</span><br>
It's simple. We've got a venue with tons of space, and I'd like you to decorate it in whatever fashion you want!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Leonardo da Vinci：</span><br>
In other words, I can bring as many of my inventions as I want? I'm game!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Littorio：</span><br>
We'd be fools to pass up a golden opportunity to spread Sardegna's glory. Veneto, I presume you approve?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Vittorio Veneto：</span><br>
Correct. We'd be more than glad to assist you, Seattle.<br>
In fact, would you mind if I asked the others if they'd like to help as well? We could spread our glory further with more manpower.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Seattle：</span><br>
Yeah, by all means! The more, the merrier, and all that!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Vittorio Veneto：</span><br>
Thank you. I promise you won't be disappointed.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Seattle：</span><br>
Sweet. I'll give you a rundown of the venue later. The sky's the limit, so get creative!<br>
Let's make this party one for the history books!<br>
<br>
The girls all throw their hands in the air and let out cheers.<br>
It looks like this party is starting to come together.<br>

4.Setting the Table<br>
Next item on the party preparations list: the food. Seattle and I arrive at the Sakura Empire dorm to hammer out our plans.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Hiei：</span><br>
Oh, good day, Commander and Miss Seattle.<br>
Welcome to our dormitory. Please have a seat and I'll bring tea out to you shortly.<br>
Here we are. Enjoy.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Seattle：</span><br>
Appreciate it!<br>
Yat Sen, random question, but what brings you here?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Yat Sen：</span><br>
Oh, no reason in particular.<br>
I just wanted to have a small chat with Hiei.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Seattle：</span><br>
A chat, eh? Let's see, things you have in common... Is it about food?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Hiei：</span><br>
Yes, in fact. We were discussing the canteen's menu for this upcoming week.<br>
Would you remind me where we left off, Yat Sen?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Yat Sen：</span><br>
Of course. I brought up how some have complained that the vegetables were seasoned too strongly. Perhaps we could work out a menu with milder seasoning.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Hiei：</span><br>
But then, those who prefer a stronger taste may complain that it needs more seasoning. Accounting for everyone's tastes is a tall order, I'm afraid...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Yat Sen & Hiei：</span><br>
......<br>
<br>
It sounds like they're at an impasse.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Seattle：</span><br>
Hey, could I chime in for a sec?<br>
It COULD be that people just aren't used to the seasoning itself, rather than how strong it is. Different strokes, and all that.<br>
You can always experiment and see what people like. And I've got the perfect occasion for you to do it!<br>
See, I'm throwing a party with a multinational theme on our next holiday, and I'd like you two to do the catering!<br>
You'll have people from all different factions trying your food, and you can use their feedback to find that seasoning sweet spot. Whaddya say?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Yat Sen：</span><br>
Interesting... That would let us figure out everyone's tastes to a more exact degree.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Hiei：</span><br>
It's the perfect solution. We'd be happy to assist.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Seattle：</span><br>
Aw yeah! I'm glad you're both on board!<br>
That's that solved. Let's see if we can recruit some more peeps, Commander!<br>

A Party for the Ages<br>
<br>
5.Setting the Scene<br>
We arrive at the Eagle Union dorm to look for a set piece for the party.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Seattle：</span><br>
Whew... We've been all over the place today. Hope this'll be our final stop.<br>
I know that look. You're wondering why we're checking this place out last, am I right?<br>
<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项1："Because you're from the Eagle Union yourself?"</span>'''''<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Seattle：</span><br>
I guess that's part of it, but it's mainly 'cause the party's gotta have a surprise.<br>
To keep the surprise, y'know, a surprise, it's gotta stay a secret from the other factions.<br>
The Eagle Union's our best option in this case, since we're the ones hosting the event.<br>
A party without a surprise is like a cake without icing, see. Still good, but could be better.<br>
And when it comes to surprises, nobody does them better than the Eagle Union!<br>
<br>
"Let me guess – we're going to recruit the master of surprises herself?"<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Seattle：</span><br>
Exactamundo.<br>
They say if you look in the mirror and say her name three times, she'll–<br>
<br>
"––Whuuaah?!"<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Albacore：</span><br>
Surpriiiiiiise!<br>
<br>
As soon as we step into the dorm's common lounge, a firecracker goes off above our heads.<br>
And in a shower of ribbons and confetti, the queen of pranks herself appears.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Albacore：</span><br>
Here I am! I knew you two were coming, so I stayed hidden, lying in wait~♪<br>
Gotcha good, huh? The ol' firecracker freakout is simple, but effective.<br>
<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项1："For god's sake, Albacore!"</span>'''''<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项2："Must we go with her?"</span>'''''<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Seattle：</span><br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项1）</span>'''''Haha, not every day I get to see you make a face like that, Commander... Attagirl, Albacore!<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项1）</span>'''''If you wanna create a REAL surprise, you need someone with both the creativity and the drive.<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项1）</span>'''''Nobody's better suited for this job than her.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Seattle：</span><br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项2）</span>'''''I mean, she's the best girl for the job.<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项2）</span>'''''If you wanna create a REAL surprise, you need someone with both the creativity and the drive.<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项2）</span>'''''After all, she's the master of surprises, the queen of pranks! Who else could be better for the job than her?<br>
<br>
"That's true. You won't find anyone else as skilled at her craft."<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Albacore：</span><br>
Whatcha whispering about? Me?<br>
Come on, speak up! I wanna hear it~♪<br>
A set piece for your party? Sounds right up my alley!<br>
All our alleys, even! What do you girls think?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Dace：</span><br>
As long as I get to fire torpedoes, heck yeah!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Bluegill：</span><br>
I'm in if the rest of you are!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Cavalla：</span><br>
A party with colorful balloons, flowers, and food? Sign me up!<br>
<br>
The empty lounge suddenly erupts with cheering as submarines burst out of hiding from cardboard boxes, from the ceiling, and even from under the couch.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Seattle：</span><br>
Whoa! All this time you had another surprise up your sleeve!<br>
Anyone who wants to help is totally welcome to. Can't wait to see what you girls come up with!<br>

6.It's Party Time!<br>
Finally, the day of the party arrives...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Seattle：</span><br>
Yo! Is everyone here?<br>
I just wanted to say, thank you all for coming today!<br>
Whether you like partying, chilling, or anything in between, I hope you have a great time!<br>
Without further ado, let's get this world cruise party started!<br>
<br>
Seattle delivers a brief speech, and the party begins.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Seattle：</span><br>
Commander, come here! Let's have a look around!<br>
<br>
First up, the entertainment...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Seattle：</span><br>
Check these out! Da Vinci invented these. Called 'em "Warpy-Worpy VR Lenses," I think? Wonder what they do...<br>
Whoa! We're in a virtual Sardegnian city. It's so realistic it's like I'm really there!<br>
Next time I'm throwing a party, I'm so doing it in the place this is based on!<br>
You could put this in your office, too. Would be sweet to play around with.<br>
<br>
Next, the food...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Seattle：</span><br>
You've gotta have a taste of this, Commander!<br>
These are the hors d'oeuvres Hiei and Yat Sen made. They're based on the cuisine of several different factions.<br>
They're far from the only thing on the menu! Hell, I'd get full before I could even try everything.<br>
C'mon, pick something and have a bite!<br>
<br>
Then, the surprise...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Seattle：</span><br>
Hey, they're serving jam cake! Here, have some.<br>
Huh. I don't see any jam in the cake. Maybe– Whoa!<br>
They put a chocolate cutout of Albacore inside the cake? That's... interesting.<br>
Oh! There's jam when you bite into the chocolate! Man, there's layers to this surprise!<br>
Ooh, that one looks cool!<br>
We've gotta check it out, Commander!<br>
<br>
Everywhere she looks, Seattle finds something new to marvel at, despite having already inspected it all as the party's organizer.<br>
Her sheer enthusiasm rubs off on me. I follow her all around the party, having a great time by her side.<br>

7.A Morning Like Any Other<br>
Office - A morning unlike any other<br>
...Except it's actually not.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Seattle：</span><br>
Mornin', Commander!<br>
You had breakfast yet? If not, you want some of this?<br>
<br>
Seattle places a tray lined with Sardegnian dishes onto my desk.<br>
As has become a morning routine, she's pushing a new, tasty breakfast meal onto me.<br>
<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项1："Sardegnian this time, eh?"</span>'''''<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Seattle：</span><br>
Yup-yup! Got these from the food stand Veneto and da Vinci opened in response to the Empery's li'l joint!<br>
Apparently, she also came up with a new invention – the Pizza Ovenator. Group activities like parties inspire people in surprising ways!<br>
Speaking of, how'd you like the party on the whole?<br>
<br>
"It was awesome. Hopefully we can do something like it again."<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Seattle：</span><br>
Yeah! Glad to hear you liked it, 'cause I really wanted to make it something memorable!<br>
Can you tell me something specific you liked?<br>
<br>
"I'd have to say..."<br>
<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项1："You."</span>'''''<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项2：(Stare silently at her.)</span>'''''<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Seattle：</span><br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项1）</span>'''''Me? Come again?<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项1）</span>'''''You mean like, you liked my expertise as a party organizer, or...?<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项1）</span>'''''No? So wait, you mean that as in...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Seattle：</span><br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项2）</span>'''''Yeah? I'm listening.<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项2）</span>'''''...Wait, you mean you liked ME?!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Seattle：</span><br>
Hang on, don't say anything! I need a second to sort my thoughts out! I'll just, uhh...<br>
I'll be right back!<br>
<br>
Several minutes later...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Seattle：</span><br>
Back! Whew... Okay, I'm as ready as I'll ever be!<br>
Commander, I like you too. I had way more fun walking around at the party with you than I normally do!<br>
Well, guess I've got something else to plan today, besides my next party.<br>
That being, our da–<br>
<br>
I interrupt her before she can throw a wrench into my schedule.<br>
"I'm up for a date, but only after I've finished work."<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Seattle：</span><br>
...<br>
Come on! Whyyyy?!<br>
