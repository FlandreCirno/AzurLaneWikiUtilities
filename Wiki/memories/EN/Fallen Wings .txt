“...I thought... by defeating all of my enemies... I’d finally get some peace.”<br>
“But it appears... the future has betrayed us.”<br>
“No matter the effort, there will always be battles ahead.”<br>
“One by one they stand defiant in front of me... and one by one their faces disappear behind me... I can’t remember them anymore.” <br>
“——It is time, sisters.”<br>
 <br>
“The stars are mesmerizing tonight”<br>

Is this the area indicated by that mysterious signal... It appears that we were still too late.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">North Carolina：</span><br>
This is too much, everything has completely turned into ruin.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Helena：</span><br>
Exactly who are these people... to be able to destroy the test field setup by the Sirens...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Washington：</span><br>
Could it be the Sakura Empire?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">North Carolina：</span><br>
From the traces of weapons damage—— This doesn’t look like it was from the Sakura Empire or the Royal Navy... could this be... could this be from our weapons?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Washington：</span><br>
Argh!!! Such a thick fog of war!!!<br>
No matter, whoever did this, they certainly saved us a lot of trouble. I really have to thank this “Mystery Man”.<br>
Let’s explore the surroundings, see if we can collect any useful intel——<br>

<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Helena：</span><br>
There’s no match in our database for Sirens... could this be a new model?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Washington：</span><br>
Interesting, it appears everything’s been destroyed and turned into ruin... and a new Siren has appeared, the plot thickens...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">North Carolina：</span><br>
In any case, we should take charge. Find out what is this Siren’s motives are and what she’s trying to do.<br>

Attention! Unknown enemy unit ahead and fast approaching, all ships alert battlestations!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Washington：</span><br>
Wow, she’s actually taking the initiative.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">North Carolina：</span><br>
New type of Siren ship... it appears they’re constantly imitating our battle formation.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Washington：</span><br>
Hmph! Perfect, then let's show them the real fighting style of the Eagle Union!<br>

<span style="color:#ff0000;">？？？：</span><br>
There are no special observations from “Key Point G”... and… Eagle Union’s special task force is intercepting the target.<br>
It appears that “Key Point G” is secretly sending a signal which has attracted these wasps.<br>
Executor-class ships have been deployed to the target area. Even though they’re older models, they should be able to handle the situation.<br>
What do you mean “should be”? That wishy-washy wording is not in our vocabulary...<br>
Don’t underestimate them, let’s prioritize the search and rescue first...<br>
As for those Eagle Union cowgirls... they can be used for our new combat test… two birds with one stone.<br>
Understood, starting to accordingly divert our resources immediately.<br>
So… “Key Point G”… How can I seduce you again this time around? Hehehe...<br>

<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Washington：</span><br>
Hey, this group of playthings is so fragile, please tell me you have more powerful ships waiting for us?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">North Carolina：</span><br>
Washington... are you mocking our opponent again? Don’t forget why we’re out here in the first place.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Helena：</span><br>
I’ve been trying to track our enemies on radar along the nearby sea area... but aside from the signal I’m getting from the Sirens, nothing else is out there...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Washington：</span><br>
Hey! “Mystery Man”!! Can you hear me then show yourself at once? There is a limit to my patience when playing hide and seek.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Helena：</span><br>
Radar indicates that... more enemy ships are fast approaching our location...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Washington：</span><br>
Sigh, will we never get rid of these annoying pests?<br>
Bring it on, let me use my 16-inch cannon to smash you into iron slags!!!<br>

<span style="color:#D6341DFF;">Observer α：</span><br>
After all, this was “Key Point G” we’re dealing with. They “saved the world”, again~ Hehehe.<br>
<span style="color:#D6341DFF;">Enterprise：</span><br>
...Are you being ironic with me?<br>
<span style="color:#D6341DFF;">Observer α：</span><br>
We would not dare, after all, you are the “key” to our Creator.<br>

So, as per our agreement, will you allow us to conduct another round of “game”, what is your choice?<br>
<span style="color:#D6341DFF;">Enterprise：</span><br>
Continue...<br>
No matter how many times... My choice will always be the same...<br>

"Could they be just like us? Do they eat food, play, and chit chat like us?"<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">???：</span><br>
"Yes, we are not alone in this universe after all."<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Enterprise：</span><br>
"So, will we meet them? I have so many questions that I want to ask them..."<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">???：</span><br>
"Yes, one day... we’ll meet them for sure."<br>
"You have to believe that humans are inherently enterprising. That is exactly why we gave you this name."<br>
"Actually... do you like this name?"<br>
"I do!"<br>

<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Helena：</span><br>
I just received a strange encrypted message... source unknown... trying to decrypt now...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">North Carolina：</span><br>
You can receive a signal from our allies at this place? Could it be a trap...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Helena：</span><br>
The encrypted message is full of incomprehensible words... the only confirmed word is “Falling”... Fallen?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">North Carolina：</span><br>
I can’t make heads or tails of what this means...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Washington：</span><br>
First the hide and seek, now comes all these puzzles? This “Mystery Man” sure loves to toy with us.<br>
Why don’t we just sniff him out with our firepower and give him a good shelling? After that, he will answer all our questions out of the kindness of his “good heart”, hehehe.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">North Carolina：</span><br>
...In any case, let’s report our current findings back to HQ. It’s such a headache dealing with these new models.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Helena：</span><br>
I’ve already reported back to headquarters immediately after our findings.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">North Carolina：</span><br>
Miss Helena, you’re as reliable as ever~<br>
Now, let’s continue moving forward towards the source of that signal.<br>

……————<br>
Warning. Warning—— The 5th defense line has been broken—— Warning. Warning<br>
Warning. Warning—— Fleet destruction rate exceeds 82%—— Warning. Warning<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">???：</span><br>
I tried to be gentle to this world, but didn't expect that hurt this world the most...<br>
...Now, even if we borrow the power of the ocean, we still have no chance of defeating them...<br>
This so-called “evolutionary” process is actually a process of natural selection. The harsher the environment gets, the stronger the survivors become. Until the strongest becomes "Flawless".<br>
Survival of the fittest, natural selection.<br>
Did you see it? This is the tragic ending from your weakness——<br>
<br>
……————<br>
Warning. Warning—— Second data center has encountered an accident—— Warning. Warning.<br>
Warning. Warning—— Observation system front end has been damaged—— Warning. Warning<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">???：</span><br>
At least... in the end, we still have a chance to correct the error made in history...<br>
...Lyn<br>

I’m here.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">???：</span><br>

<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Helena：</span><br>
The situation is not good... although we sink two new models... but there are still a lot of signals coming towards us.<br>
...We seem to be completely surrounded.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">North Carolina：</span><br>
When did the Sirens become so subtle in their tactics? To be able to perfectly predict our trajectory and surround us on our operations...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Washington：</span><br>
Darn...if only South Dakota was here as well, then we could...<br>
No matter what, let’s shoot our way out and carve out a blood-soaked path forward!<br>
Prepare all cannons, aim together with me at our opponent's flagship—— open fire!<br>
<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Helena：</span><br>
The SG radar has spotted numerous incoming signals. Enemy units increasing!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">North Carolina：</span><br>
Didn't expect there to be so many Sirens...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Helena：</span><br>
It seems they are trying to overwhelm us with sheer numbers.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Washington：</span><br>
Hmm, it seems we'll have a tough fight ahead of us in order to breakthrough these Sirens.<br>
The hell with it, let's sink these Sirens before we run out of ammo. Ready your guns and maintain formation!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Helena：</span><br>
Wait, the number of enemies is... suddenly dropping!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">North Carolina：</span><br>
A large number of air units were spotted on our airborne radar... but I can’t identify the model type!<br>
<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Helena：</span><br>
!!???<br>
What happened...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Washington：</span><br>
What’s happening... I obviously hit the biggest ship...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">North Carolina：</span><br>
All Sirens on sight have been destroyed. Helena, did you find anything?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Helena：</span><br>
Enemy signals on the SG radar were completely gone.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Washington：</span><br>
No, there's someone still watching us.<br>
Hey, you there! No more hiding, show yourself! My main guns has locked you location! Come and join me in a proper battle!<br>
No one can escape my MK3 radar. All guns, prepare to open fire ——<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">North Carolina：</span><br>
Wait!<br>
<span style="color:#D6341DFF;">？？？？？：</span><br>
……<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Helena：</span><br>
The signal sent by this unit is consistent with the previous encrypted messages, but...<br>
(The SG radar is completely unable to locate the unit… could it be malfunctioning?)<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Washington：</span><br>
What the heck, so it turns out that you are the “Mystery Man”, such a sneaky appearance. You could’ve easily been injured by friendly fire.<br>
So, we are Eagle Union’s 16th Task Force, we received the mysterious signal from you and came to investigate—— Please identify yourself.<br>
<span style="color:#D6341DFF;">Enterprise：</span><br>
……<br>
I just want to confirm something with you.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Washington：</span><br>
You dare to ignore my question?<br>
<span style="color:#D6341DFF;">Enterprise：</span><br>
Tell me... the name of your Commander...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">North Carolina：</span><br>
Before confirming your identity, we have no obligation to answering your question. And what you asked is the highest of secrets.<br>
<span style="color:#D6341DFF;">Enterprise：</span><br>
……<br>
...is that so (turns around)... then I will confirm it myself.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">North Carolina：</span><br>
This Siren base was destroyed by you alone? …Who are you...<br>
<span style="color:#D6341DFF;">Enterprise：</span><br>
……<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">North Carolina：</span><br>
(Wait... this cloak?... How's that possible?)<br>
E-Enterprise!<br>
<span style="color:#D6341DFF;">Enterprise：</span><br>
……<br>
No... you’re mistaken.<br>
<br>
 <br>
“Mankind, actually live a humble existence”<br>
“But, our small bodies are filled with infinite expectations and ideals.”<br>
“We often put our own expectations and ideals and shape them to our desires, hoping they are eternal and powerful.”<br>
“Once strong enough, they will replace our  ephemeral physical existence, and become an infinite spiritual sustenance.” <br>
“This is also the meaning to your name”<br>
“But... one day, if mankind abandons our highest ideals, and embarks on a completely contrary path.”<br>
“Are you willing… <br>
... To help us correct the wrongdoings of the future?”<br>

“Key Point G” has left the mirror sea area, tracking signal lost.<br>
<span style="color:#ff0000;">Observer β：</span><br>
This is really a troublesome BUG, I completely can’t understand her behavior pattern...<br>
And she specifically targeted this time singularity.<br>
<span style="color:#D6341DFF;">Observer α：</span><br>
Perhaps this is the so-called "Flawless" at work. No matter what, she will still choose our side in the end... just like before.<br>

The SG radar is picking up something, it located the unknown Siren ship model.<br>
This is… a courier?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Washington：</span><br>
Oh? Do Sirens also have couriers? Hahahaha, this can also be considered a big catch. <br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Helena：</span><br>
Our opponent is trying to flee the battlefield, full speed ahead!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Washington：</span><br>
Hey, now that you’ve been found, there’s no chance you’ll escape! All ships maneuver to battle positions and start intercepting the enemy ships! Hehe, it’s about time we get to have a good workout.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">North Carolina：</span><br>
Hmm... talk about Siren technology... to be able to sail at such speed. It's not enough to rely on our artillery attacks alone...<br>
Well, luckily for us. Right before we set sail, I received a new batch of “toys” from Akashi. Hehe, it looks to be quite useful~<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Washington：</span><br>
A new toy? These are… mines?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">North Carolina：</span><br>
Correct. We can use these mines to block our opponent’s escape route. This way, we can ensure that nothing will slip through our fingers~<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Washington：</span><br>
Hehe, this is getting more and more interesting! Ok, let’s have ourselves a happy little chase!<br>
