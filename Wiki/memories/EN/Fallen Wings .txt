“...I thought... by defeating all of my enemies... I’d finally get some peace.”<br>
“But... this world's future has betrayed us.”<br>
“Even if my wings break, my guns melt, and the steel of my body creaks, this war will not end<br>
“The faces of the friends who stood beside me disappear one by one... until I can no longer remember them.” <br>
“...Let us sally forth once more”<br>
 <br>
“...The stars are mesmerizing tonight.”<br>

This is the area indicated by that mysterious signal... Seems like we were too late.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">North Carolina：</span><br>
How terrible. Everything's been reduced to rubble.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Helena：</span><br>
Who exactly... has the capacity to wipe out a Mirror Sea, the Sirens' testing grounds?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Washington：</span><br>
You reckon the Sakura Empire's "Reborn Combined Fleet" is behind this?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">North Carolina：</span><br>
Doubt it. The traces left behind point to the Eagle Union's own weapons rather than anything from the Sakura Empire or Royal Navy.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Washington：</span><br>
Damn it! What the hell's the meaning of this?!<br>
...Well, whoever it is, they spared us the trouble of having to mop up the enemy ourselves. I'll make sure to buy 'em a drink if we ever get a chance to meet.<br>
In any case, let's take a look around and see if we can gather any useful intel.<br>

<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Helena：</span><br>
Is this... the new Siren prototype we encountered the other day?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Washington：</span><br>
Interesting stuff, huh? An experimental site with a brand new Siren prototype gets completely destroyed. Almost sounds like a conspiracy if you ask me.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">North Carolina：</span><br>
Whatever's going on, we have to seize the initiative and reveal the Sirens' objectives – ASAP.<br>

A humanoid Siren is approaching us rapidly! Everyone, prepare for battle!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Washington：</span><br>
Hah, trying to get the jump on us, huh? That ain't gonna work!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">North Carolina：</span><br>
The new Sirens seem to be mimicking our combat strategies.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Washington：</span><br>
Perfect! We'll show them just how big the difference is between true Eagle Union technique and their flimsy imitation!<br>

<span style="color:#ff0000;">？？？：</span><br>
The special observation target, "Code G," hasn't been captured yet... And now, an Eagle Union task force has come to crash the party.<br>
It seems that the signal secretly sent out by Code G has attracted some unintended guests...<br>
In that case, I'll move my Executors as well. They're rather outdated and don't have much going for them in the personality department, but they should be more than a match for them.<br>
"Should be?" A concept as amorphous as that should not exist within our program.<br>
Don't underestimate them. For now, locating Code G is our top priority.<br>
As for those Eagle Union cowgirls... they can be used for our new combat test... two birds with one stone, as they like to say.<br>
Understood. Diverting system resources accordingly.<br>
Code G... How should I lure you out this time? Heehee...<br>

What, did I break your little toys already? Tell me you brought some tougher opponents for me to smash!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">North Carolina：</span><br>
Washington, now's not the time for that. Remember, we haven't finished our mission yet.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Helena：</span><br>
I've been running my wide-range scan as far as it'll go, but it's not registering anything other than Sirens!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Washington：</span><br>
Heeeey! Whoever you are that defeated the Sirens! Come out already if you can hear me!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Helena：</span><br>
Wait, hold on... More Sirens are rapidly closing in on us.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Washington：</span><br>
Again? There's just no end to these gadflies, is there?<br>
Bring it on!! My 16-inch cannons are gonna reduce you to steel slag!<br>

Congratulations~ You've defeated all the enemies, which makes you the winner of this round~<br>
<span style="color:#d6341d;">Enterprise：</span><br>
……<br>
<span style="color:#d6341d;">Observer α：</span><br>
As expected of you, Code G. Once again, you've saved the world with hardly a hitch. Heehe.<br>
<span style="color:#d6341d;">Enterprise：</span><br>
...Are you mocking me?<br>
<span style="color:#d6341d;">Observer α：</span><br>
We wouldn't dare. After all, you are the connection node to the "wedge" of history ordained by the Creator–<br>
After all, we are all more or less molded from your "factor." To treat our prototype with disrespect would be unbecoming.<br>
<span style="color:#d6341d;">Enterprise：</span><br>
……<br>
<span style="color:#d6341d;">Observer α：</span><br>
Now, as per our agreement, we shall reset the board and allow you to play another round of this "game." What will your decision be?<br>
<span style="color:#d6341d;">Enterprise：</span><br>
Continue...<br>
I will keep going... Now matter how many times it takes...<br>
Until I find that person––<br>

<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Enterprise：</span><br>
I wonder... if all the stars in the night sky are the lights of different civilizations, just as you said...<br>
Could they be just like us... Laughing and crying together the same way humans do?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">???：</span><br>
That's right. We're not so alone in the universe after all.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Enterprise：</span><br>
...I see. Then, do you think I'll ever get a chance to meet them? There are so many things I'd like to ask.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">???：</span><br>
One day, you will. I'm sure of it.<br>
Just like the name given to you suggests, we humans will always keep forging ahead, no matter how tough the going gets. That's what it means to be enterprising.<br>
Speaking of which, I don't think I've ever asked you, but... Enterprise, do you like your name?<br>
Yes, of course.<br>
Then...<br>
How about we make a promise?<br>

<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Helena：</span><br>
I've just received a strange encrypted communication via friendly channels! I can't determine who it originated from, but... I can decypher it!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">North Carolina：</span><br>
A message from our allies, here of all places? Are you sure it's not a trap?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Helena：</span><br>
I see something about... Falling? Fallen?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">North Carolina：</span><br>
What does that even mean...?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Washington：</span><br>
First, hide and seek, and now, riddles? Looks like our mystery person over here likes to play games.<br>
My 16-inchers know exactly how to deal with someone who can't give us a straight answer. Isn't that right?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">North Carolina：</span><br>
...Let's not worry about that for now. Why don't we report back on what we've found so far? I'm not too keen on fighting any more of these new enemies...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Helena：</span><br>
Don't worry. I've already contacted HQ.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">North Carolina：</span><br>
Heehee. As reliable as ever, Helena~<br>
Now then, let's find the source of the signal. You don't have a problem with that, do you, Washington?<br>

Warning. Warning—— The 5th defensive line has been breached—— Warning. Warning.<br>
Warning. Warning—— Destruction of combat-operational units in excess of 82%—— Warning. Warning.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">???：</span><br>
I wanted this world to be kinder, but in the end, that was my greatest folly... Even this power was no match for Them...<br>
In that case... For the sake of survival, I must make this world cruel. Cruel enough so that we can adapt, mutate, and survive.<br>
Under constant selective pressure, we will continue to evolve until finally, a specimen with the power to defeat Them is created.<br>
Countless lives will be lost in the process, but...<br>
Do you see it now? That is the price that must be paid because of human weakness.<br>
<br>

<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Helena：</span><br>
Shoot... We're rapidly being surrounded by Siren forces! At this rate...<br>
Wait, we're already completely boxed in!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">North Carolina：</span><br>
When did the Sirens get so good at reading our moves? I've never seen them coordinating so flawlessly before...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Washington：</span><br>
Goddamnit... If only South Dakota were here...<br>
Urgh, that doesn't matter right now. We're gonna smash our way out – I sure as hell don't plan on becomin' cannon fodder here!<br>
Everyone, take aim at the large Siren battleship straight ahead of us! All guns, open fire!<br>
<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Helena：</span><br>
I'm seeing more enemy readings on my SG radar! Their ranks seem to only be growing!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">North Carolina：</span><br>
How in the world did so many Sirens make their way here...?!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Helena：</span><br>
Looks like they're trying to overwhelm us with sheer numbers.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Washington：</span><br>
They're not gonna give us an easy opportunity to break through their defensive line either...<br>
To hell with it! Let's send as many of these Sirens as we can to the bottom of the sea before we run out of ammo!!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Helena：</span><br>
Hold on! The enemy readings are rapidly decreasing one after another!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">North Carolina：</span><br>
I see it too! I'm getting a large number of readings from my anti-air radar! ...But, whose planes are those?!<br>
<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Helena：</span><br>
Wh-what?!<br>
...What just happened?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Washington：</span><br>
What's going on?! I only just started firing at the enemy in front of me...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">North Carolina：</span><br>
...All the Sirens in the area have completely been annihilated. Helena, do you know what's going on?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Helena：</span><br>
No clue. I'm not seeing any signatures remaining on my SG radar either.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Washington：</span><br>
Wait, there's still someone watching us.<br>
Hey, whoever you are! I know you've been sneaking around this whole time! Come out here and fight us fair and square! I already have you in my sights!<br>
Don't think I'll let you get away! Main battery––!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">North Carolina：</span><br>
Stop! Washington!<br>
<span style="color:#d6341d;">？？？？？：</span><br>
……<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Helena：</span><br>
The reading I'm getting from this unit matches the previous encrypted messages, but...<br>
(My SG radar isn't picking up anything at all! Is this a malfunction of some sort...?)<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Washington：</span><br>
...Heh, so you're the one who made mincemeat out of the Sirens? You've certainly got style – I dig that.<br>
We're the Eagle Union’s 16th Task Force, and we came here to investigate after picking up your encrypted communication. Now, state your affiliation and intent.<br>
<span style="color:#d6341d;">Enterprise：</span><br>
……<br>
I just want to confirm something with you.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Washington：</span><br>
You're just gonna ignore my question like that?!<br>
<span style="color:#d6341d;">Enterprise：</span><br>
Tell me... the name of your Commander.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">North Carolina：</span><br>
Sorry, that's classified information. We're under no obligation to share that information with you until you identify yourself.<br>
<span style="color:#d6341d;">Enterprise：</span><br>
……<br>
...So be it. I'll confirm it myself then.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">North Carolina：</span><br>
Were you the one who destroyed the Siren base, alone? Just who are you...?<br>
<span style="color:#d6341d;">Enterprise：</span><br>
……<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">North Carolina：</span><br>
(Wait, that cloak, where have I seen it before... Could it be...?)<br>
Enterprise?!<br>
<span style="color:#d6341d;">Enterprise：</span><br>
……<br>
...You've got the wrong person.<br>
<br>
 <br>
“We humans are so small, so fragile.”<br>
“But even these small bodies can harbor vast, boundless dreams.”<br>
“We work hard, study hard, and keep moving forward so that one day, we can become our ideal selves.”<br>
“And if we cannot become our ideal selves, we entrust our dreams to those who are molded after us, and through them, our pride carries on.” <br>
“That, is how humanity remains on the correct path. That, is the meaning of your name.”<br>
“But, if one day, humanity casts aside its pride and chooses a path that is the exact opposite of our noble ideals...”<br>
“Would you be willing....<br>
To help us correct the wrongdoings of the future?”<br>

Code G has escaped from the Mirror Sea area. Her signal has been lost.<br>
<span style="color:#ff0000;">Observer β：</span><br>
What a troublesome glitch in the system. Her behavioral patterns defy all principles.<br>
What‘s more, she keeps targeting this specific timespace, just like us.<br>
<span style="color:#d6341d;">Observer α：</span><br>
But perhaps this is due to us being created from the same "factor." In the end, she will come to choose us once again.<br>
It is as the humans like to say–<br>
"The strongest people have the loneliest souls."<br>
Code G... Revel in your strength, now and forevermore. Heehee, hahaha!<br>

My SG radar is picking up on something! Adding unidentified Siren hull type to the database!<br>
Is this... a transport vessel?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Washington：</span><br>
Hmm? Do Sirens also have transports? Ahahaha! How convenient for us then!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Helena：</span><br>
The transport is trying to flee from this area at high speeds!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Washington：</span><br>
Now that we've found it, we can't afford to let this opportunity slip away from us! Helena, have all our forces surround and capture that transport vessel!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">North Carolina：</span><br>
As expected... That thing's got some crazy speed. We're not going to be able to corral it in with warning shots...<br>
Luckily, we just happened to get some new toys from Akashi... Take a look at these influence mines.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Washington：</span><br>
Influence mines...?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">North Carolina：</span><br>
That's right. By laying these, we can block off the enemy's escape route and force it into our waiting arms.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Washington：</span><br>
Now that sounds more like it! What's a hunt without some excitement?<br>

“To them, the Great One spake: 'I saw Lucifer fall, like a bolt of lightning descending from the sky.”<br>
“Those who followed in rebellion were warped and twisted, but it is said that their fallen wings were not torn off.”<br>
“That is because the Great One could not bear to see His most beloved work sullied, and thus allowed them to glow even from the depths of the Underworld.”<br>
Humans really do write the quaintest stories.<br>
But, Tester and Purifier... Indeed, these lower-level terminals do not have the ability to hold her back.<br>
In that case... I must ask you to descend into the "Underworld" to call forth those children.<br>
