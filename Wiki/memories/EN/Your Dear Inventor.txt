Your Dear Inventor<br>
<br>
1 Wellspring of Inspiration<br>
At noon on a clear and sunny day...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Leonardo da Vinci：</span><br>
Commander, you've got to test out my latest invention!<br>
<br>
Leonardo da Vinci, the inventor with seemingly endless vitality, comes through my office doors carrying some strange contraption.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Leonardo da Vinci：</span><br>
Check it out! I call it the Stiffy Shoulder Massaginator! It'll make your shoulder stiffness go away faster than you can say "ow, that's smart!"<br>
I figure you'll benefit from it a lot since you're strapped to your desk all the time. Come on, try it!<br>
<br>
It's true – I've had to file a lot of paperwork lately, and that has taken its toll on me. It can't hurt to try.<br>
"Well..."<br>
"On one hand, it does its job exactly as advertised. On the other..."<br>
"It's really loud. Can't you make it quieter somehow?"<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Leonardo da Vinci：</span><br>
WHAT? DID YOU SAY SOMETHING? I CAN'T HEAR YOU!<br>
<br>
"I said it's too loud!"<br>
*click*<br>
It's impossible to have a conversation over the noise from her invention, so I decide to switch it off.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Leonardo da Vinci：</span><br>
I see. So the noise is a problem.<br>
To be fair, I only designed it to give you a great shoulder massage, not to be quiet or anything!<br>
So if it makes a little noise, that's fine!<br>
<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项1："It's much more than 'a little' noise."</span>'''''<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项2："It negatively affects the user experience."</span>'''''<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Leonardo da Vinci：</span><br>
It's a minor detail, don't worry about it! It works, that's what matters. By the way, do you have any more problems other than stiff shoulders?<br>
Big or small, I wanna know! Heck, the more the better!<br>
<br>
"Let me guess – you came to my office expressly to find inspiration again, didn't you?"<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Leonardo da Vinci：</span><br>
Uh... Ahahah... Guilty as charged.<br>
Yeah, my idea well has been pretty dry for a while now.<br>
So I thought, "hey, you have a vast range of knowledge, so you must have a good idea or two I can work with."<br>
<br>
"I'm happy to give you that. After I finish my work."<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Leonardo da Vinci：</span><br>
Awesome! Thanks, Commander!<br>
In fact, let me help you with the work! It'll be quicker that way, plus I want to make up for dropping in unannounced!<br>
<br>
Since da Vinci wants this work done and over as quickly as possible, I thought she'd prioritize efficiency above all else.<br>
However, that presumption proved wrong – she reads through the request forms, sent in by shipgirls, meticulously and slowly.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Leonardo da Vinci：</span><br>
Geesh... All these needs I never knew about...<br>
This gives me loads of ideas for new inventions, actually...<br>
<br>
She smacks the table with both her hands and stands up, as if she just figured something out.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Leonardo da Vinci：</span><br>
I've got it!<br>
Commander, I'm going to be your secretary starting tomorrow!<br>
These request forms provide excellent inspo! And working as your secretary, I'll get to read them all day!<br>
<br>
"If you want to, be my guest. Just don't forget to perform the actual duties of a secretary."<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Leonardo da Vinci：</span><br>
Well, of course! I'll chew through those papers while savoring the sweet taste of inspiration.<br>
Heck, I can get the job done in a flash if I really want to!<br>
Let me do this and I promise you won't be disappointed♪<br>
<br>
And so, I welcomed da Vinci aboard as my secretary.<br>

<br>
Your Dear Inventor<br>
<br>
2 Inventing an Invention to Invent Inventions<br>
Since then, da Vinci has been working hard every day as my secretary, just as she said she would.<br>
After she finishes the day's work, she sits down and looks through her paperwork with a fine comb, searching for inspiration.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Leonardo da Vinci：</span><br>
...Huh. Le Malin wants to establish a lounge which provides snacks and oxy-cola for all.<br>
Sounds like more hassle than it's worth, though. You'd still have to walk there yourself.<br>
I've got a better idea – building custom drones that can airdrop snacks directly to people.<br>
You could make it so you just wave your hand at a drone in the air and it'll fetch the goods for you in a minute or two!<br>
<br>
"The snacks would be fine, but cola is a volatile substance and doesn't react well to being shaken."<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Leonardo da Vinci：</span><br>
Dang, you're right... There needs to be a balance between stability and convenience...<br>
<br>
I can almost hear the gears in her head turning at max RPM.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Leonardo da Vinci：</span><br>
Wait, I've got it! Need a pen and paper! I've got to sketch this out right now!<br>
<br>
At the end of a day's work, da Vinci will typically have drawn three to four blueprints and sketched out five or more concepts.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Leonardo da Vinci：</span><br>
M'kay... This'll do as a rough outline.<br>
Commander, could you come here and have a look?<br>
<br>
As always, she's curious to hear what I have to say about her latest ideas.<br>
I examine the blueprint for a while, trying to understand what it is. The only way I could describe it is, 'an electric fan standing on bird legs.'<br>
So, if I had to guess, it's...<br>
<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项1："Some sort of... bipedal fan?"</span>'''''<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项2："A new breed of... robot?"</span>'''''<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Leonardo da Vinci：</span><br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项1）</span>'''''Uhh... No. That's not a fan on top, it's a propeller!<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项1）</span>'''''And that on the bottom is the landing gear. It's inspired by how birds' feet move when they land.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Leonardo da Vinci：</span><br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项2）</span>'''''Kind of – it's an aircraft. Or, well, a bird-like drone, I guess you could say.<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项2）</span>'''''That on top is the propeller, and that on the bottom is the landing gear. It's inspired by how birds' feet move when they land.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Leonardo da Vinci：</span><br>
The real highlight, however, is this part right here!<br>
<br>
With twinkling eyes, she points to a compartment at the machine's center, painted black.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Leonardo da Vinci：</span><br>
My specially-engineered storage space!<br>
See this? That's where you store the cola, and this is where the snacks go!<br>
By adding a buckle, you can ensure the cola doesn't roll around during transport without any complicated systems.<br>
Pretty smart, if I say so myself! What do you think?<br>
<br>
"Even with the explanation, I can't make heads or tails of anything in your sketch."<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Leonardo da Vinci：</span><br>
Oh... Well, I drew it in a hurry, so it's probably hard to grasp.<br>
What can I say? My pen can't move as fast as the flashes of my inspiration.<br>
Which is a problem when I try to introduce my ideas to others...<br>
<br>
"Maybe you could invent something that solves that problem?"<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Leonardo da Vinci：</span><br>
You mean... make an invention that makes it easier to make inventions?<br>
Wait, that's ingenious!<br>
Thanks for the idea! Expect good news soon!<br>
<br>
The next day...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Leonardo da Vinci：</span><br>
Commander! I managed to build it overnight!<br>
I've dubbed it... the Fully Automatic Blueprint Drafter!<br>
Quite simply, this little baby helps me sketch out a design quickly, accurately, and in an easily-readable format.<br>
Now you won't have to scratch your head trying to understand my blueprints anymore.<br>
<br>
"That sounds extremely promising. Could I get a demonstration?"<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Leonardo da Vinci：</span><br>
Sure thing!<br>
Alright, let's start by drawing a tire here...<br>
Actually, no. Gotta start with the frame.<br>
...What the heck is this? That takes up way too much space! The cockpit will get pressurized if you draw it like that!<br>
Hang on, maybe I can fix it if I move the cockpit to the other side...<br>
...No! You can't put the engine there!<br>
<br>
Initially, the machine is able to keep up with her instructions, making an accurate blueprint at stunning speed. However...<br>
Her instructions quickly become too much for it to follow. Pushed past its limits, the machine lets out a screech and overheats.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Leonardo da Vinci：</span><br>
Bah! I'll just do it on my own!<br>
<br>
She gives up on her new invention and goes back to drawing her designs by hand, like she normally does.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Leonardo da Vinci：</span><br>
I should've known better... Words just can't compete with the speed of electric signals in your brain.<br>
This just confirmed my hunch – drawing blueprints myself is the quickest!<br>
<br>
Da Vinci has no real use for this machine. She's faster than it.<br>
But, it may one day see use in someone else's hands.<br>
Perhaps not for the purpose of drawing blueprints, as she envisioned, but for filling out paperwork, it could be quite the powerhouse.<br>

Your Dear Inventor<br>
<br>
3 Look Around You<br>
Outside, on a sunny holiday...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Leonardo da Vinci：</span><br>
Huh. There are some things in this world you'll only notice if you have a close look...<br>
<br>
As I'm walking around the stadium, I catch sight of da Vinci. She's standing by the hurdles, muttering to herself.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Leonardo da Vinci：</span><br>
Oh, Commander! Morning.<br>
<br>
"What are you up to?"<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Leonardo da Vinci：</span><br>
I'm coming up with inventions that could improve the equipment around here.<br>
After all, technology should get better with the passage of time!<br>
Take these hurdles, for instance. Whenever you want to use them, you have to carry and put them in place, right?<br>
Now imagine a machine that could do it for us.<br>
<br>
"I see where you're coming from. That would be convenient."<br>
"Did somebody ask you to do this, by any chance?"<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Leonardo da Vinci：</span><br>
Nope. I'm doing it because I want to.<br>
By the way, I'm gonna go around looking for inspo in a bit. You wanna come with me?<br>
<br>
"Sure, why not? I was just on a walk anyway."<br>
Port - Café<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Leonardo da Vinci：</span><br>
Poor staff. It always gets super busy here during holidays.<br>
Maybe I could invent a robot that makes coffee exactly the way you tell it to. That'd lighten the baristas' workload!<br>
<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项1："I pray it won't be deafeningly loud."</span>'''''<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项2："You should ask for the staff's opinion first."</span>'''''<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Leonardo da Vinci：</span><br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项1）</span>'''''It won't be! A café has got to have a chill atmosphere, and I can account for that in my designs!<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项1）</span>'''''Why'd you even bring that up? Don't tell me it's something to do with my Massaginator...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Leonardo da Vinci：</span><br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项2）</span>'''''Obviously. I'm not just going to push an invention on them without hearing them out.<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项2）</span>'''''But, on the contrary... with some people, it's best if you don't ask.<br>
<br>
Port - Swimming Pool<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Leonardo da Vinci：</span><br>
You know what sucks about getting out of the pool?<br>
You're soaking wet. And if it's windy while you're wet, it's chilly as heck and you'll probably catch a cold.<br>
But, imagine if you had swimwear that automatically warmed you up! Then you could get up without fear of freezing your butt off.<br>
<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项1："Brilliant idea."</span>'''''<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项2："What if there's an electric leakage?"</span>'''''<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Leonardo da Vinci：</span><br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项1）</span>'''''I know, right?<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项1）</span>'''''I shall name it... the Swimmy Warmy Swimwear. Once it's finished, we should both wear one and go for a swim!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Leonardo da Vinci：</span><br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项2）</span>'''''Oh, right! You'd get shocked! Well, everyone would...<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项2）</span>'''''Hmm... Yeah, I'd better use a chemical heating agent instead.<br>
<br>
Port - Classroom<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Leonardo da Vinci：</span><br>
Every now and then, you've got to clean the blackboard. Not only is that a chore, but you're also at risk of inhaling unhealthy chalk powder.<br>
That's the problem the Automatic Anti-Specky Blackboard Eraser aims to solve!<br>
Just press a button and the powered air intakes will clear all traces of chalk as well as suck up any powder residue on the blackboard's rim!<br>
<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项1："It's so easy that anyone could use it."</span>'''''<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项2："But what if you press it by mistake?"</span>'''''<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Leonardo da Vinci：</span><br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项1）</span>'''''Heh! Exactly! And if you want, I could give you one for the blackboard in your office!<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项1）</span>'''''Then again... That blackboard hasn't seen any use since you had the new monitor installed...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Leonardo da Vinci：</span><br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项2）</span>'''''Then it'll erase everything on the blackboard whether you want it or not.<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项2）</span>'''''...Without a two-step confirmation mechanism, anyway. I'll be sure to add that.<br>
<br>
Together, we toured many more places across the port. It was a joy to see her get so fired up when she found inspiration.<br>
Now, we're back in my office.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Leonardo da Vinci：</span><br>
Heehee♪ I definitely didn't expect to find this much inspiration all around me.<br>
If I had to point at what was so different, it's that you were with me the whole day.<br>
When you're with me, I get good ideas left and right. Plus you point out things I would've never noticed myself!<br>
So, I have to ask you a favor – will you tag along from now on whenever I need some inspo?<br>
<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项1："I'd love to."</span>'''''<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项2："Do I have a choice?"</span>'''''<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Leonardo da Vinci：</span><br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项1）</span>'''''Thanks! I really appreciate it.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Leonardo da Vinci：</span><br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项2）</span>'''''You sure as heck don't♪<br>

<br>
Your Dear Inventor<br>
<br>
4 One Man's Trash...<br>
In the office, after a long day...<br>
I'm searching around for da Vinci's contraption, and it's nowhere to be found.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Leonardo da Vinci：</span><br>
Whatcha looking for? The Stiffy Shoulder Massaginator?<br>
You won't find it here. I threw it in the depot.<br>
<br>
"Why? Did you give up on it altogether?"<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Leonardo da Vinci：</span><br>
You said it was too loud, so I assumed you didn't like it.<br>
<br>
"The massage itself was excellent, though. If you can make it quieter, it'll be perfect."<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Leonardo da Vinci：</span><br>
But with the current design, the two are linked. You can't make it quieter without making the massage worse.<br>
<br>
"Really? That's a shame. It was a promising concept."<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Leonardo da Vinci：</span><br>
You think so?<br>
I think it was kinda counterproductive. How could you enjoy its raison d'être with all that noise?<br>
You basically said it yourself. A massage is supposed to be relaxing, and you can't relax when it's THAT loud.<br>
<br>
"So just fix the noise problem."<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Leonardo da Vinci：</span><br>
I told you! Doing that will only make the massage worse!<br>
Even if the gain outweighs the loss, it completely deviates from my original vision!<br>
And that's something I refuse to compromise on. What use is an invention that fails at what it was meant to do?<br>
There is none. I know it feels like a waste, but it's best just to forget about it!<br>
<br>
So she deems any invention that doesn't live up to her original vision as a failure.<br>
This brilliant mind has standards too high for her own good, I suppose.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Leonardo da Vinci：</span><br>
Hey... If you really want to see it again, I can show you where I left it in the depot.<br>
Don't worry, it's still in one piece. Just because it's a failure doesn't mean I scrapped it or anything.<br>
<br>
Da Vinci leads me to the depot, where her failed invention lies.<br>
Her discarded creations extend as far as I can see from the entrance, big and small, stowed away in every corner.<br>
This may be a pile of garbage to her, but to an average person like me, it's a treasure trove.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Leonardo da Vinci：</span><br>
Look, Commander! It's the Self-Propelled Swooshy Piano I made ages ago! You can play it while making your way downtown!<br>
Its problem was that it didn't sound so great when played in the open...<br>
That, and playing a piano on the move isn't exactly safe, so here is where it rests now.<br>
<br>
"You could just travel short distances with it, like indoors. You could do that with it right now, without changing anything."<br>
"As for the safety issue, you could lay down a track. That way you can drive safely while still putting on a theatric performance."<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Leonardo da Vinci：</span><br>
Sure, you could do that...<br>
But my original vision was a piano you could take outdoors and play anywhere, anytime!<br>
Anything that deviates from that is a failure by definition!<br>
<br>
Her definition of "failure" really leaves no room for compromise.<br>
Shrugging and scanning my surroundings, I find the Stiffy Shoulder Massaginator resting on a shelf.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Leonardo da Vinci：</span><br>
I'm telling you, it's a failure. Why do you want to keep it?<br>
<br>
"One man's trash is another man's treasure."<br>
Picking up the contraption, I turn on my heel and head back to my office.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Leonardo da Vinci：</span><br>
(Why is the Commander so attached to it? It's obviously a failure...)<br>
(One man's trash is another man's treasure, huh...)<br>
(So the Commander thinks of it as treasure...)<br>
(...Why am I thinking about this?)<br>
(Am I that concerned about how the Commander views my inventions?)<br>
(Weird... Just weird...)<br>

<br>
Your Dear Inventor<br>
<br>
5 Testing a Hypothesis<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Leonardo da Vinci：</span><br>
The moment I give birth to an invention, it's out of my hands.<br>
It's up to the user how they give it meaning.<br>
That's simple. I've known that all along.<br>
So I've never paid any mind to what others think of my inventions.<br>
I'm always just inventing to turn every flash of inspiration into a real, tangible thing.<br>
Even when I'm inventing something to solve others' problems, I'm still the one conceptualizing and designing it.<br>
I'd always thought that, the instant an invention deviated from my concept, it became a failure.<br>
That's how I've always rolled. The thought that I might be wrong never even occurred to me.<br>
So why...<br>
When the Commander treated my failures like they were treasures...<br>
Why did my heart flutter?<br>
I don't know... I can't make heads or tails of it.<br>
That just means... it's time for an experiment!<br>
<br>
Port - Office<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Leonardo da Vinci：</span><br>
Commander, I finished my secretary work for the day!<br>
Just need you to look over these request forms for me.<br>
Oh, but I've already checked them out, and they're good. All you really need to do is stamp and sign them.<br>
<br>
(That's usually how this works. Why is she so emphatic about it this time? ...Something's up.)<br>
I decide to read them more thoroughly this time.<br>
Sure enough, one of the request forms mixed in is da Vinci's.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Leonardo da Vinci：</span><br>
Ahaha... I should've guessed you'd figure me out, Commander.<br>
Not that I was going to keep it from you forever. I was totally going to tell you all about it.<br>
<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项1："After I approved it, you mean."</span>'''''<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项2："As in, when you couldn't hide it any longer?"</span>'''''<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Leonardo da Vinci：</span><br>
I-I didn't mean it like that!<br>
Ahem. There's no use hiding it anymore! You read the request form, didn't you?<br>
What do you think? Personally, I think it stands up to scrutiny...<br>
<br>
"'Da Vinci's Duds and Doodads Exhibition'? What is it?"<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Leonardo da Vinci：</span><br>
It's what it says on the tin! I want to show everyone all the failures I left in the depot!<br>
Remember when you said that one inventor's failure might be one user's treasure?<br>
Call this an experiment to test your hypothesis.<br>
If you're right, then that means... I've been working under a serious misunderstanding.<br>
Don't approve it for me; approve it for the sake of the Stiffy Shoulder Massaginator!<br>
<br>
"How can I say no to that?"<br>
(Not that I was planning to say no to begin with.)<br>
(This exhibition could bring new life to the useful inventions that da Vinci judged as failures.)<br>
(And maybe, if all goes well, it might change her perspective toward her failures.)<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Leonardo da Vinci：</span><br>
Thanks, Commander!<br>
You'd better come and check it out!<br>

<br>
6 The Duds and Doodads Exhibition<br>
After taking some time to prepare, the Da Vinci's Duds and Doodads Exhibition successfully begins.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Alfredo Oriani：</span><br>
Da Vinci's Duds and Doodads Exhibition... Just hearing the name lights a fire in my journalist soul!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ark Royal：</span><br>
Scenery-Spiffifying Telescope... Sure, it sounds okay for looking at the stars.<br>
But what if I could use this during regular patrols...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Bristol：</span><br>
What is this... One-Shot Anesthesia-Launching Wristwatch?!<br>
It might not help in battle, but during exploration? Imagine the potential...!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Le Malin：</span><br>
A Fizzy-Cola Fountain Pen that uses cola instead of ink... Ooh! Maybe with this...<br>
I could have cans of cola all over my desk, and nobody would complain!<br>
<br>
Word spreads like wildfire, bringing droves of visitors to the exhibition.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Leonardo da Vinci：</span><br>
(I'm glad I switched to a bigger venue like the Commander suggested...)<br>
(To think, so many people came for my failures...)<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Torricelli：</span><br>
Whoa... This place is packed...<br>
(Sneaky... Stealthy...)<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Leonardo da Vinci：</span><br>
Hey, Torricelli! Thanks for coming!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Torricelli：</span><br>
O-oh, no problem...<br>
(That sure didn't work out...)<br>
Don't mind me... I'm just looking around. Actually, just forget I exist...<br>
I'll leave as soon as I'm done...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Leonardo da Vinci：</span><br>
Sure, sure. Send any comments, opinions, and questions later for me!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Torricelli：</span><br>
O-okay...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Leonardo da Vinci：</span><br>
Even Torricelli came... If that doesn't show how successful this exhibition is, I don't know what would.<br>
No, the number of visitors isn't what matters. I need to perform my experiment!<br>
Time to go and ask for everyone's thoughts!<br>
Like over there, near that crowd. I think that was where I'd put my Infinite Tissue Works invention.<br>
The concept was just to output infinite tissues, but you have to refill it eventually. That defeats the point of it being "infinite," so I called it a failure and scrapped it.<br>
But Suffolk didn't mind that limitation and said it was convenient. Everyone else agreed with her.<br>
Why is that? Hmmm...<br>
Let's keep looking around.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Shimakaze：</span><br>
Da Vinci, this automatic pet feeder is magnificent!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Leonardo da Vinci：</span><br>
...Automatic pet feeder?<br>
Oh, you mean my failed Potato Chip Delivery Bot?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Shimakaze：</span><br>
Whoa, is that what it's called?! My mistake!<br>
Okay, so it's a machine that spits out potato chips automatically? That's cool, but I think you'd be able to use its features better as an automatic pet feeder!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Leonardo da Vinci：</span><br>
Really...? Okay, then you should take it!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Shimakaze：</span><br>
Can I really?! Much obliged, da Vinci!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Leonardo da Vinci：</span><br>
No problem! ...Alright, back to scoping things out.<br>
<br>
After some time...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Leonardo da Vinci：</span><br>
Weird. I've gotten so many opinions from everyone, but...<br>
None of them really shook my heart like before.<br>
Maybe I really don't care that much about what other people think of my inventions.<br>
If that's true, was I just imagining how I felt when the Commander said that?<br>
Hmmngh... Oh, speak of the devil! Finally free from work, Commander?<br>
Come over here!<br>
Commander, I was waiting ages for you!<br>
<br>
The moment I enter the venue, da Vinci appears out of nowhere and stops me.<br>
<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项1："Is the exhibition going well?"</span>'''''<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项2："How did you know I was here?"</span>'''''<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Leonardo da Vinci：</span><br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项1）</span>'''''Sure is! I'm getting heaps of new and unique inspo!<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项1）</span>'''''Some people liked my failures, so I just donated them to whoever wanted them.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Leonardo da Vinci：</span><br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项2）</span>'''''Heheh, how else? One of my inventions!<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项2）</span>'''''Whenever you enter a 500-meter radius, it reacts and even lets me track where you are!<br>
<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项2）</span>'''''"...You can do that?!"<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Leonardo da Vinci：</span><br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项2）</span>'''''Ahahaha! Did you really believe that?<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项2）</span>'''''I was just checking the security cameras, so I saw when you came in.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Leonardo da Vinci：</span><br>
You're a little late, but it's less packed now that people are leaving, so maybe it's for the best.<br>
I'll be your personal tour guide through what remains of the exhibition!<br>
<br>
Da Vinci shows me around, introducing all of her strange and unusual failed inventions.<br>
My eyes are drawn to a grey umbrella.<br>
<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项1："What's that?"</span>'''''<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Leonardo da Vinci：</span><br>
It's my Portable Rain's-Bane Fortress.<br>
It can withstand rain AND winds up to fifty knots!<br>
Say goodbye to getting wet on rainy days!<br>
<br>
"It works that well? Doesn't sound like a failure to me..."<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Leonardo da Vinci：</span><br>
Weeell... I focused so much on the wind-resistant part that I ended up making it way too heavy to hold.<br>
It can't fold shut, either, and the special coating on the canopy can't be printed on. It's stuck being a boring grey, on top of being unwieldy...<br>
It's a failed invention, through and through.<br>
<br>
"You may think so."<br>
"But forget portability. Set it up on a park bench, or something, and it'll make a great shelter."<br>
"The plain color also means it can blend in without disturbing the natural scenery of the park."<br>
"Do you disagree?"<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Leonardo da Vinci：</span><br>
*gasp*<br>
(There it is! That's the feeling of my heart fluttering again!)<br>
Y-you might be right!<br>
It's all yours, Commander. Try putting your hypothesis into practice!<br>
(It's only the Commander's opinions that make me feel this way...)<br>
(I still think that inventions that deviate from their concept are failures, but...)<br>
(I can't neglect the new inspiration that transcends the original concept!)<br>
(That inspiration... is my love for the Commander!)<br>

Your Dear Inventor<br>
<br>
7 Inspired by You<br>
Many days after the expedition...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Leonardo da Vinci：</span><br>
*stare*...<br>
<br>
(I can't help but notice da Vinci sneaking glances at me.)<br>
<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项1："Is there something on my face?"</span>'''''<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项2："Anything wrong?"</span>'''''<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Leonardo da Vinci：</span><br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项1）</span>'''''No. That's not it.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Leonardo da Vinci：</span><br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项2）</span>'''''Nah. I'm fine.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Leonardo da Vinci：</span><br>
Why do you ask?<br>
<br>
"Because you're staring."<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Leonardo da Vinci：</span><br>
I've been thinking up this really awesome invention for a while now.<br>
Well, it's less of an invention, and more of an existing idea.<br>
It's better called an improvement... Hmm, or a customization?<br>
But no matter how much I rack my brain, I can't visualize its final form. It's getting on my nerves.<br>
<br>
"I think I get the situation... though that doesn't explain why you were staring at me."<br>
"Besides, if you want someone to help you implement an idea, I'd think Torricelli would be better."<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Leonardo da Vinci：</span><br>
It's you, not Torricelli!<br>
<br>
"Come again?"<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Leonardo da Vinci：</span><br>
We'll call it... the Da Vinci Inspirifier!<br>
Look at you, making the perfect invention when I wasn't even looking... You're a foxy one, Commander.<br>
<br>
"I get it... Except, I don't actually get it at all."<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Leonardo da Vinci：</span><br>
It's okay! You don't have to understand!<br>
Anyway, I'll be needing that Massaginator!<br>
<br>
Without explaining a thing, da Vinci leaves with the massage device.<br>
The next day...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Leonardo da Vinci：</span><br>
Tadaaa! I fixed it up!<br>
I call it the Stiffy Shoulder Massaginator Junior!<br>
So, we did lose some of the massage functionality, buuut...<br>
<br>
Da Vinci flips the switch. It turns on, but I don't hear the loud noise from before.<br>
After the starting beep, there's so little noise that I can't even hear it unless I listen carefully for it.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Leonardo da Vinci：</span><br>
Cool, right? I improved it based on your feedback.<br>
Are you satisfied with this iteration?<br>
<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项1："It's basically flawless."</span>'''''<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项2："That's awesome!"</span>'''''<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Leonardo da Vinci：</span><br>
Heheh! Glad to hear it!<br>
Yeah... Really glad.<br>
<br>
"I'm surprised you bothered to try again after you called the first Massaginator a failure."<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Leonardo da Vinci：</span><br>
The thing is... my way of thinking has undergone some changes.<br>
<br>
"Because of everyone's feedback during the exhibition?"<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Leonardo da Vinci：</span><br>
Well, that helped, but...<br>
Eureka! You had your own reasons for letting me hold the exhibition, didn't you?<br>
You were hoping I'd see people complimenting my failures, and change my attitude toward them, right?<br>
<br>
"You got me."<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Leonardo da Vinci：</span><br>
Heh. Your mistake for thinking you could hide anything from ol' da Vinci!<br>
The moment I give birth to an invention, it's out of my hands.<br>
It's up to the user how they give it meaning.<br>
I can't change what other people think, and really, I don't think I care.<br>
<br>
"In that case..."<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Leonardo da Vinci：</span><br>
Why did I revise this invention instead of moving on to a new one?<br>
Isn't it obvious? I did it for you♪<br>
Also, there's a reason that I decided to change my concept for once.<br>
Do you know what I'm trying to say, Commander?<br>
<br>
Da Vinci's eyes bear a glint of determination.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Leonardo da Vinci：</span><br>
I did it all to make you happy, Commander!<br>
In other words, your wishes were incorporated into the concept itself!<br>
And I'm going to keep on doing that until I satisfy all of your needs!<br>
<br>
...............<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Leonardo da Vinci：</span><br>
Heheh. That look on your face tells me you already understand.<br>
The existing idea I had my mind on...<br>
The customized invention I made... Are the pieces coming together?<br>
<br>
"They are. I think I get it now..."<br>
The great Da Vinci Inspirifier, a device that inspires inventions for the sake of people you care about.<br>
Its blueprint lies square in her heart.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Leonardo da Vinci：</span><br>
Now, Commander, tell me all of your needs.<br>
I'll invent whatever it takes to make you happy!<br>
