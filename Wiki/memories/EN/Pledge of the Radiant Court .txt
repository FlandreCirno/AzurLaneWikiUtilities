*knock knock knock*<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Warspite：</span><br>
Strange... Her Majesty should be in her room with Belfast around this hour...<br>
Pardon, Your Majesty. I'm coming in.<br>
<br>
Warspite opened the door to Queen Elizabeth's lavish office.<br>
However, the queen was not there, and neither was the maid who accompanies her almost at all times.<br>
She searched all over Scapa Flow, but could not find a trace of Her Majesty. The concerned Warspite called for a meeting.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Warspite：</span><br>
Yesterday, the ceremony to celebrate Scapa Flow's reconstruction was cancelled. Today, something even worse has happened...<br>
Her Majesty has gone missing, along with Belfast, Sheffield, and several of our blueprint ships.<br>
Now, this has happened before. During the last major operation at Scapa Flow, she took the Royal Maids with her to survey a Singularity.<br>
This time is different, however. She's left no written message explaining her absence. Assuming she has already left these islands, she could be anywhere right now.<br>
Ladies of the Royal Knights, do you have any idea where she may have gone?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">King George V：</span><br>
Afraid not. As you said, Her Majesty took the Royal Maids with her during her expedition into that Singularity. The Royal Knights entrust them with matters of secrecy by a matter of precedent.<br>
Vanguard, you're part of Her Majesty's palace guard. Did she tell you anything before she left?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Vanguard：</span><br>
She did not. Being the head of the patrol fleets here, I can however say that she did not sail out of Scapa Flow.<br>
Yesterday's air raid put us on high alert, so I deployed additional patrols around the area.<br>
Even if she snuck out very early in the morning, there is not a chance she could've left undetected.<br>
Especially not considering she made off with an entourage of maids and blueprint ships.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">King George V：</span><br>
The fact she took the blueprint ships with her is puzzling. The Royal Maids should be plenty for a covert operation.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Warspite：</span><br>
So, if nobody saw her leave Scapa Flow, yet she is nowhere to be seen, that leaves only one possibility... The Singularity.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">King George V：</span><br>
You're saying she went through the gate to that Mirror Sea we've discovered?<br>
"Camelot," was it? Why would Her Majesty go there?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Warspite：</span><br>
After the battle, we continued investigating the Mirror Sea and found a teleportation device that seems to lead to a number of other places.<br>
The name Camelot applies to not only the Mirror Sea, but also to the teleportation device and all facilities connected to it.<br>
And the way to it is through the gate we have here at Scapa Flow.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">King George V：</span><br>
In essence, our gate here at Scapa Flow is the bridge to a hub world of sorts?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Warspite：</span><br>
Correct. I suspect the reason Her Majesty left, then, is to search for a cure for Hood's illness in Siren territory.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">King George V：</span><br>
In that case, I have a theory as to why she took those blueprint ships with her.<br>
If we assume that the Black Cube corrupts the foundation of our hulls, the defense mechanisms of regular shipgirls like us may be insufficient to deal with these effects.<br>
On the other hand, the hulls of blueprint ships are imprinted in a completely different manner that may allow them to fare better.<br>
Do you think Her Majesty planned this expedition in advance, and that's why she invited them to the ceremony?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Warspite：</span><br>
I wouldn't go that far. Her Majesty couldn't predict Hood would become bedridden from her illness.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">King George V：</span><br>
True. If Hood had a say in the matter, she would never let others risk their well-being for her sake. Yet, we cannot simply stand by and watch.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Warspite：</span><br>
Of course not. But rushing on an expedition into a Mirror Sea with no support is just reckless.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">King George V：</span><br>
I agree. This is quite unlike how she conducted herself during the last operation.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Warspite：</span><br>
That one was much better organized. Her Majesty had the Iron Blood's cooperation as well as information about the META, giving the Royal Maids a chance to conduct a preliminary survey.<br>
Their thorough preparation was the only reason the Naval HQ was deceived into thinking that Friedrich had captured Her Majesty.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">King George V：</span><br>
Indeed. This time, she has no such advantages, and we have no idea where Camelot leads to.<br>
She must have a good reason to have done all this...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Warspite：</span><br>
Last evening, I informed her it would take very long to survey Camelot. I hope that had nothing to do with it...<br>
Let us make doubly sure before acting. Vanguard, have you heard of unusual activity in any of Scapa Flow's facilities?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Vanguard：</span><br>
I have not. The guards I assigned to this building claim Her Majesty retired here for the night without incident. Naval HQ's representatives have done nothing out of the ordinary, either.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">King George V：</span><br>
It seems Camelot is our only bet, then. We've no other leads to go on.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Vanguard：</span><br>
Let us not be too hasty, King George.<br>
If we find Her Majesty in Camelot, all is fine. However, if she has used the teleporter to go to a different Mirror Sea, then what we're facing is a major emergency.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">King George V：</span><br>
Precisely, which is why I'm so concerned about Her Majesty's wellbeing.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Vanguard：</span><br>
You misunderstand. I am saying we must not act without thinking first.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Warspite：</span><br>
Vanguard is right. We need to plan ahead for the possibility that Her Majesty cannot be located within Camelot.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Vanguard：</span><br>
To add to that, Naval HQ would become deeply suspicious if both you and King George went missing in addition to Her Majesty.<br>
So allow me to make a proposition – you two shall stay here, and I shall lead a small search party into Camelot.<br>
My fleetmates and I make up a formal Mirror Sea expedition fleet. We've been briefed on them and should be able to respond flexibly to whatever we encounter.<br>
Upon my honour, we will find and bring Her Majesty back safely!<br>
In the meanwhile, I ask that you provide us with all the support you can, and that you keep the gate to Camelot guarded and maintained.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">King George V：</span><br>
Hmm... You make a good case. I'm in favour of entrusting the task to a select few specialists.<br>
Sending in all the search parties we can muster wouldn't be more efficient. It would only result in chaos and many casualties.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Warspite：</span><br>
Indeed it would. Vanguard, you face a monumental task, but I put my faith in you.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">King George V：</span><br>
Seems we have our Mirror Sea expedition team. Vanguard, Indomitable, Jervis, Janus, Revenge, and Bellona.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Warspite：</span><br>
I should feel confident that Vanguard is leading this fleet, but I still can't shake my sense of unease.<br>
I fear that she may lose herself in the fighting and lose sight of our goal...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">King George V：</span><br>
You've nothing to worry about. Yes, she rarely gets to fight and becomes a little overexcited as a result. But...<br>
In times of crisis, she knows what must be done and she does it. She wouldn't put herself over what's important.<br>
Now, changing topics... We need to come up with an excuse to explain Hood's and Her Majesty's absence.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Warspite：</span><br>
I'll deploy a reserve fleet outside Camelot, just in case we need it.<br>
The fact remains that it's Siren territory, even if we have explored Camelot before. Better to be safe than sorry.<br>
<br>
It wasn't long ago the events at Scapa Flow unfolded.<br>
The Iron Blood rebelled against the Sirens, igniting a battle that would finally bring an end to one of their leaders.<br>
This sent shockwaves across not just the Azur Lane and the Crimson Axis, but the entire world.<br>
While they all processed the news, the Royal Navy embarked on a secret expedition into their Singularity.<br>
Now they set out once more, in search of a cure for the Black Cube's corruption.<br>
Vanguard leads the foray into the unknown, in pursuit of the missing queen.<br>
What awaits them inside the fabled land of Camelot?<br>
The Holy Grail? Or something even greater?<br>

<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Indomitable：</span><br>
Confirming we've entered the Mirror Sea.<br>
And my, it feels like we've stepped into a fairytale. Sunshine, green pastures, and a silver castle. It doesn't look anything like Scapa Flow.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Vanguard：</span><br>
Because we're not in the Mirror Sea version of Scapa Flow. Change the coordinates on the gate, and it'll take you elsewhere.<br>
In this case, to what they've dubbed "Camelot." That castle means we're in the right place.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Revenge：</span><br>
It's like being back home in the Royal Islands, strolling through the countryside. The familiar name definitely helps sell the idea.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Indomitable：</span><br>
Indeed. In fact, this place looks almost exactly like how I'd imagine the Camelot from the Royal Knights' stories to look.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Revenge：</span><br>
Really makes you wonder why the Sirens designed a Mirror Sea like this in the first place...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Vanguard：</span><br>
Who knows? We can come up with whatever reasons we'd like, but the truth is, we can never really understand the Sirens' motivations.<br>
If their goal was to replicate a vista from the Royal Islands, they certainly embellished the details with such an ornate castle.<br>
Assuming they have a motive, the only one I can think of is that they made it this beautiful so we wouldn't want to destroy it.<br>
It sure beats the cold, purely functional architecture we're used to seeing from them. I'll give them that much.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Janus：</span><br>
Th-the breeze is so nice and cool...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Jervis：</span><br>
Watch your step, Janus. You might trip.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Janus：</span><br>
It's all right. I'm watching where I'm going.<br>
Ah – these flower petals vanish when you touch them.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Jervis：</span><br>
Luckily the castle doesn't vanish when you touch the brick exterior. Though it feels more like metal than brick to me.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Vanguard：</span><br>
It's a Siren facility – appearances are only superficial. We're not in the Royal Islands, and definitely not in the Camelot of legend either.<br>
This is a foreign place, and our mission is to explore it. Remember that, and be on your toes.<br>
Now, first order of business – finding the teleporter inside the castle.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Bellona：</span><br>
The one Her Majesty used to warp to another Mirror Sea, correct?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Vanguard：</span><br>
We don't know that for sure yet. Though I doubt she came here just to smell the roses.<br>
Plus, she surveyed this area before we did. Safe to say she hasn't gotten herself lost in her own second backyard.<br>
Tallyho, ladies. Let's bring Her Majesty home in time for tea.<br>
{{折叠面板|内容结束}}

{{折叠面板|标题=Destination Alpha|选项=3|主框=1|样式=primary|展开=是}}
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Indomitable：</span><br>
Is that... Sheffield?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Revenge：</span><br>
She seems to have collapsed right by the teleporter... Be careful, everyone!<br>
<br>
Inside the castle's hall was a large teleportation device, surrounded by dozens of screens and computer terminals.<br>
At the center, three golden arches formed a door to another world.<br>
Lying unconscious at its base was one of the Royal Maids who had gone missing along with Queen Elizabeth – Sheffield.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Vanguard：</span><br>
Revenge, Bellona, stand guard! The assailant could be nearby!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Bellona & Revenge：</span><br>
Affirmative!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Indomitable：</span><br>
Sheffield! Please answer us!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Jervis：</span><br>
Step back, please. I'm trained in first aid.<br>
<br>
Jervis knelt by Sheffield's side and began examining her.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Indomitable：</span><br>
I don't see any enemies nearby though. Sheffield should be fine, right?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Jervis：</span><br>
Good news – she's uninjured as far as I can tell. I believe she's just unconscious due to some kind of impact.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Vanguard：</span><br>
That's a relief. Maybe starting up the device caused some sort of power surge which knocked her out.<br>
At ease, ladies. This happened due to an accident, not enemy malice.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Indomitable：</span><br>
I don't see Her Majesty anywhere. All signs point toward her having already used this device.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Vanguard：</span><br>
Very likely. I'm looking at the terminal's logs and it appears to have been used two times recently.<br>
Unless Her Majesty has an alter ego, she's bound to be in one of the two locations.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Indomitable：</span><br>
What should we do? Splitting up into two groups seems like a rather dangerous proposition...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Vanguard：</span><br>
Likewise, rushing in headfirst would be suicide. We also need to secure our way home.<br>
Our only real option is to explore one destination, and if we find nothing, try the other.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Indomitable：</span><br>
Indeed. That being the case, we need someone to stay behind and hold the fort.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Vanguard：</span><br>
Yeah. Someone who can forward communications between us and Scapa Flow, as well as make sure the gateway stays open.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Jervis：</span><br>
Plus look after Sheffield and request reinforcements. That someone shall be me.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Janus：</span><br>
No, I'll do it. We've no idea what dangers lie on the other side, and the others will need you more than they'll need me. Let me be the rearguard.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Jervis：</span><br>
But... Janus...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Vanguard：</span><br>
No, she's right. You can provide medical aid if Her Majesty has been hurt, Jervis.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Jervis：</span><br>
That is a good point. Janus will be safer here as well... All right, let's do it this way.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Janus：</span><br>
I won't let you down! I promise!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Vanguard：</span><br>
Okay. We'll try the first set of coordinates on the terminal. Ladies, gather on the platform!<br>

<br>
Location unknown - Camelot(?)<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Indomitable：</span><br>
Are we still in Camelot? Did the teleporter malfunction?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Vanguard：</span><br>
No, we definitely warped. Janus and Sheffield are gone, and I see no recording devices. It seems we've been taken to a separate instance of Camelot.<br>
<br>
The gate shone and transported the search party to a remarkably similar castle hall, but the fine details differed much from the last.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Indomitable：</span><br>
Sunshine, islands covered with greenery, and forests that stretch on forever. Quite similar to the last Camelot.<br>
*yaaawn*... It's all so tranquil it's making me sleepy.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Jervis：</span><br>
Curiously, the rings on this gate are aligned differently.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Vanguard：</span><br>
The Royal Maids had a theory on that – their arrangement clues you in to which version of Camelot you're in.<br>
Let me just make sure we can go back... All right, we're good. Let's go, ladies – time to look around!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Revenge：</span><br>
This forest seems like a terrible nuisance to get through... Indomitable, do your eyes in the sky see anything noteworthy?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Indomitable：</span><br>
I'm afraid not. This Mirror Sea does appear to be nothing but dense forest stretching in all directions.<br>
Err, wait, is that a small castle? It looks pretty run down though, and there don't appear to be any signs of activity...<br>
That leaves us two options – head there to search for Her Majesty, or look behind every tree in this endless forest.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Vanguard：</span><br>
Guess we'll have to make the trek there by foot.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Indomitable：</span><br>
While on the topic, does anyone know what this place is actually supposed to be?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Vanguard：</span><br>
No idea. A Mirror Sea, obviously, but beyond that – maybe it's a re-creation of some place?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Indomitable：</span><br>
Hmm... Do you think it's supposed to serve as a Reenactment site?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Vanguard：</span><br>
Likely, which means it's possible we'll run into Pawns. I wouldn't be surprised, but that would be annoying to deal with.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Indomitable：</span><br>
Annoying? Why's that?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Vanguard：</span><br>
Because the Pawns could take on Her Majesty's form to try to deceive us. Every time we encounter someone, we'd have to confirm whether or not they're real.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Indomitable：</span><br>
Oh, I see... Good gosh, just thinking about it drains my energy... Excuse me while I return to surveying from above instead.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Vanguard：</span><br>
By all means, do that. Our top priority is finding any trace that someone's been here.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Indomitable：</span><br>
I see someone over by that castle! It will take around an hour to reach it from here!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Bellona：</span><br>
That's plenty reachable by foot. An hour is nothing if it takes us to our goal.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Indomitable：</span><br>
It's the only place I imagine Her Majesty would go to. All that's left is a bunch of trees.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Vanguard：</span><br>
I'll lead the way. Indomitable, maintain a high altitude so your planes won't be spotted.<br>
<br>
The palace guard drew her sword and led the way through the wilderness toward the castle.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Indomitable：</span><br>
We're really going to wade through the woods, I see. Jervis, did you bring insect repellant?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Jervis：</span><br>
Afraid not. I would have the foresight of a fortune teller if I did.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Indomitable：</span><br>
How unfortunate... *sigh*... I know this is an important mission, but now I really wish I stayed home...<br>
{{折叠面板|内容结束}}

{{折叠面板|标题=Lost Settlers|选项=5|主框=1|样式=primary|展开=是}}
<br>
After wading through the woodlands for just short of an hour, the search party arrived at a lone little castle resting quietly amid the trees.<br>
Beneath the curtain wall, there stood a girl with a greatsword hung over her back, humming a tune while sweeping the ground with a broom.<br>
<span style="color:#ff9900;">???：</span><br>
Hmm-hm-hmm♪ ...What the–?! Are you people real?!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Vanguard：</span><br>
Are YOU real?<br>
Hang on, answering your question with another question is improper of me!<br>
<span style="color:#ff9900;">???：</span><br>
I don't mind. In fact, it's been ages since I've had the pleasure!<br>
That confirms it, I've not gone bonkers! Siiis, we've got visitors!<br>
<br>
The girl excitedly tossed aside her broom and ran off into the castle without saying another word.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Indomitable：</span><br>
How rude... At least we can presume that girl to be neither Pawn nor Siren.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Revenge：</span><br>
I fear we may have scared her... Do you think she's a native of this place?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Indomitable：</span><br>
Don't be silly – that was obviously Repulse. And if anything, WE should be scared of that massive sword she has.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Vanguard：</span><br>
There's a high chance that she's a META. Let me check... Yup, her identification signal resembles that of Ark Royal META.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Indomitable：</span><br>
In other words... We just met the META version of Repulse?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Vanguard：</span><br>
That'll probably make it easier for us to find common ground, but don't let your guard down.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Indomitable：</span><br>
She sure is taking her sweet time. Vanguard, should we follow her into the castle?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Vanguard：</span><br>
Right. She didn't sound hostile, so let's go after her.<br>
<br>
Location unknown - Castle<br>
<span style="color:#ff9900;">Renown META ：</span><br>
Welcome to our humble abode, shipgirls of the Royal Navy. I apologise for my younger sister's discourtesy earlier.<br>
She was simply excited to have visitors. We haven't seen another person since we were confined to this Mirror Sea so long ago.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Vanguard：</span><br>
Well met. I am Vanguard, head of the Mirror Sea Expedition Fleet. I take it you ladies are Renown and Repulse.<br>
You don't mind if we omit the "META" part of your names for as long as we're here, do you?<br>
<span style="color:#ff9900;">Renown META ：</span><br>
Hmm... Well, that is probably preferable for both of us.<br>
Let us cut to the chase. Lady Vanguard, what are you doing in this Mirror Sea?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Vanguard：</span><br>
We're looking for Her Majesty, Queen Elizabeth. Have you seen her?<br>
<span style="color:#ff9900;">Renown META ：</span><br>
Queen Elizabeth?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Vanguard：</span><br>
Indeed, Battleship Queen Elizabeth, the leader of our Royal Navy.<br>
<span style="color:#ff9900;">Renown META ：</span><br>
...Repulse, have you seen anyone matching that description around here?<br>
<span style="color:#ff9900;">Repulse META ：</span><br>
Obviously not, sis. I've not seen a single soul in my time here, never mind the Queen herself.<br>
<span style="color:#ff9900;">Renown META ：</span><br>
Well, I'm afraid there you have your answer, Lady Vanguard.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Indomitable：</span><br>
(These girls are remarkably agreeable... In stark contrast to what the Commander's and the Iron Blood's intel asserted.)<br>
If you don't mind, could you elaborate on the part about having not seen anyone at all?<br>
<span style="color:#ff9900;">Renown META ：</span><br>
We are not withholding any information from you. You are literally the only other people we've seen since our arrival here.<br>
We've not seen this Queen Elizabeth you speak of, or anyone else for that matter.<br>
Though we come from a different Royal Navy, we still welcome you with open arms as our guests of honour.<br>
If you'll pardon my sudden invitation, would you care to sit down and continue this conversation over dinner?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Indomitable：</span><br>
(Vanguard, do we oblige?)<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Vanguard：</span><br>
(Let's hear what they have to tell us. We can't write off the possibility Her Majesty is somewhere in this place just yet.)<br>
<br>
Castle - Dining Room<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Vanguard：</span><br>
Fish, fruit, and bread... You've got a feast going here, even if it's on the simple side.<br>
<span style="color:#ff9900;">Renown META ：</span><br>
Thank you. I'm afraid our cooking is restricted by what we can find in the wild here.<br>
<span style="color:#ff9900;">Repulse META ：</span><br>
Further restricted by the fact my sis is hardly a master chef. Anyway, have some tea.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Indomitable：</span><br>
*gulp*... *cough cough*! Good lord, what did you put in this?!<br>
<span style="color:#ff9900;">Renown META ：</span><br>
Is it not to your taste? I apologise, but there are no tea plants in this place, so we have to make do with herbs.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Indomitable：</span><br>
Psst! Jervis! Did you bring tea bags?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Jervis：</span><br>
Pardon my tone, but I am not a corner shop on legs – my job is rescuing and nursing people.<br>
Having said that, I did bring daily essentials, including tea bags.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Indomitable：</span><br>
You're a lifesaver! Cheers!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Vanguard：</span><br>
You said earlier that you were "confined" to this Mirror Sea. Did you end up here through a Singularity?<br>
<span style="color:#ff9900;">Renown META ：</span><br>
Yes, we came here from a different branch... what must've been a lifetime ago.<br>
Not of our own volition, mind you. We were forcibly displaced. Separated from the battlefield, our sense of time gradually faded as well. <br>
We couldn't find a way out, so all we could do was settle down in the only habitable area we could locate and await rescue.<br>
Are you familiar with Antiochus? They were the ones who sent us here.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Vanguard：</span><br>
I've heard another META use that term before. You're talking about the Sirens, right?<br>
<span style="color:#ff9900;">Renown META ：</span><br>
Yes. If you're aware of all that, then I should state now that we are members of the Ashes.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Vanguard：</span><br>
You are?! So you know Ark Royal, Enterprise, and Hiryuu?<br>
<span style="color:#ff9900;">Renown META ：</span><br>
Enterprise?! Is she alive?! ...Ah, pardon – yes, I know her and Hiryuu.<br>
I do not know an Ark Royal in our ranks, however. She must be someone Enterprise recruited from a different branch after... the incident.<br>
The incident that separated us from our comrades...<br>

<span style="color:#ff9900;">Renown META ：</span><br>
It happened while we were searching for Observer Zero alongside many others from the Ashes...<br>
<span style="color:#ff9900;">Helena META：</span><br>
There... I'm in. Enterprise, I'm picking up a signal from what I believe is Zero! She must be here!<br>
<span style="color:#ff9900;">Enterprise META：</span><br>
...All that's left is to pull the plug on the mainframe.<br>
<span style="color:#ff9900;">Memphis META：</span><br>
It won't be that easy. We've got several Arbiter vessels heading toward us.<br>
They'll be here in... 30 seconds!<br>
<span style="color:#ff9900;">{namecode:66}·META：</span><br>
Maintain formation! All ships, draw your weapons!<br>
<span style="color:#ec5d53;">Arbiter: The Hermit IX：</span><br>
We know about your little ambush attempt. The jig is up.<br>
<span style="color:#ec5d53;">Arbiter: Temperance XIV：</span><br>
Even had it succeeded, the outcome of this battle would still be the same.<br>
<span style="color:#ec5d53;">Arbiter: Strength VIII：</span><br>
Changing directives. Forget neutralizing their flagship – exterminate them all.<br>
<span style="color:#ff9900;">Repulse META ：</span><br>
I can't believe this was one of Antiochus' bloody experiments! Enterprise, Takao, we'll take care of the vessels!<br>
<span style="color:#ff9900;">Renown META ：</span><br>
Go after Zero! Hurry, Helena's hacking can't slow them down forever!<br>
<span style="color:#ff9900;">Helena META：</span><br>
More vessels approaching! Fusou, they're after you!<br>
<span style="color:#ff9900;">Fusou META：</span><br>
Understood. I shall see to their departures...<br>
<span style="color:#ec5d53;">empress：</span><br>
Presumptuous insects. Your combined power amounts to nothing before us.<br>
<span style="color:#ff9900;">Hiryuu META：</span><br>
The Empress is here too, huh... That's how we know we're in the right place!<br>
<span style="color:#ec5d53;">empress：</span><br>
Yes, and your overconfidence has led you to your doom. It seems you haven't learned from the past.<br>
I'll let you in on a secret. The Devil and Hierophant have taken control of your warp devices.<br>
The others are converging upon you as we speak. You fought so hard, only to be herded up like lambs to the slaughter. I pity you fools.<br>
<span style="color:#ff9900;">Enterprise META：</span><br>
I count nine Arbiters vessels... It'll be tough, but we can do it. Zero's brought the whole party to defend her mainframe.<br>
<span style="color:#ec5d53;">empress：</span><br>
It's funny you should say her name. That number is why I pity you.<br>
<span style="color:#ff9900;">Enterprise META：</span><br>
...What?<br>
<span style="color:#ec5d53;">empress：</span><br>
Zero was never in this location to begin with. The only zero here is your probability of victory.<br>
<span style="color:#a020f0;">544845544F574552：</span><br>
53 74 61 72 74 75 70 62 61 63 6B 75 70 70 72 6F 74 6F 63 6F 6C 2E<br>
45 78 65 63 75 74 65 74 72 61 6E 73 70 6F 72 74 70 72 6F 74 6F 63 6F 6C 2E<br>
<span style="color:#ff9900;">Renown META ：</span><br>
Our plan was to launch a surprise attack on the heart of their base, but we ended up unwittingly walking into their trap.<br>
They seized control of our warp devices and sent us all to different branches. For better or worse, my sister and I both wound up here in the same place.<br>
At first we tried to destroy this Mirror Sea. When that failed, we went searching for a way out.<br>
But it was hopeless. Every time we destroyed something, Antiochus' systems undid the damage. We came to the realisation our efforts were meaningless.<br>
Our strength vaned as time went on, as did our will to fight until we could no longer see any point in continuing our war.<br>
That brings us to where we are now. I don't know what Antiochus is planning, all I know is we're not a part of it, as they've apparently forgotten about us.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Vanguard：</span><br>
Which is what led you to take up residence in this castle?<br>
<span style="color:#ff9900;">Renown META ：</span><br>
Yes, since we had no hope of ever escaping on our own. It seemed we would never again subdue foes with our keen swords.<br>
If our fighting days were behind us, the least we could do for our lost comrades is live here and know peace and happiness.<br>
That is our story. Now, Lady Vanguard, may I ask how your search for Her Majesty brought you here?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Vanguard：</span><br>
Simply put, it's possible Her Majesty is in this Mirror Sea, looking for a way to save a gravely ill friend.<br>
<span style="color:#ff9900;">Renown META ：</span><br>
A gravely ill friend? Are you able to share more?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Vanguard：</span><br>
It's Hood, from our timeline. She was damaged by someone wielding a Black Cube, and the lingering damage to her hull has left her bedridden.<br>
<span style="color:#ff9900;">Renown META ：</span><br>
A Black Cube? Oh dear, that's terrible to hear...<br>
But what does it have to do with Her Majesty? What led her to come here?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Vanguard：</span><br>
The Royal Navy doesn't have its own Black Cube. Her Majesty reasoned we may be able to find information leading us to a cure by exploring Siren territory.<br>
<span style="color:#ff9900;">Renown META ：</span><br>
So you've put your own lives on the line for another... I'm terribly sorry for my nonchalance earlier.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Vanguard：</span><br>
Nonchalance? Your hospitality can hardly be considered that–<br>
<span style="color:#ff9900;">Renown META ：</span><br>
You are knights who've pledged loyalty to Her Majesty, and I unceremoniously informed you of the cruel reality that there is no way out of this place.<br>
You are stuck here, unable to fulfill your oaths, much like my sister and I. You have my condolences.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Vanguard：</span><br>
You don't need to worry about us, actually. We have a teleporter that can take us out of here. It's the key to bringing home Her Majesty and fulfilling our oaths.<br>
If anything, allow me to apologise if I just rubbed salt in old wounds.<br>
<span style="color:#ff9900;">Renown META ：</span><br>
Not at all, those wounds have closed long since. It delights me to hear you still have a cause to fight for.<br>
To elaborate on the Black Cube issue, I believe it may be connected to METAmorphosis.<br>
The powers we gained from METAmorphosis seem to have waned during the course of our imprisonment here. Perhaps that can provide some insight into how to cure Lady Hood.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Vanguard：</span><br>
Oh! That's a promising lead! Thank you kindly!<br>
I hope your hunch proves right, because it could save her life. We'll make it a goal to collect as many samples as we can.<br>
<span style="color:#ff9900;">Renown META ：</span><br>
I hope so too. May your endeavour be successful, knights of Her Majesty.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Vanguard：</span><br>
Renown... If I may be a little sentimental...<br>
To be frank, I think I envy you and Repulse.<br>
I'm a palace guard. Only a scant few times have I fought before. I've spent most of my life by Her Majesty's side, far away from battle.<br>
As a knight, I could ask for nothing more. But as a soldier, the desire to seize glory on the battlefield tempts me.<br>
Meanwhile, you two have fought courageously your entire lives, whether or not history would remember your names.<br>
And now, by helping us, you've reminded me of something important. True glory is not something you're awarded – it is something you earn.<br>
...Sorry for the random speech. I just felt moved by your selflessness.<br>
<span style="color:#ff9900;">Renown META ：</span><br>
......<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Vanguard：</span><br>
If you don't mind, I'd like to retake my pledge of loyalty.<br>
<span style="color:#ff9900;">Renown META ：</span><br>
...What?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Vanguard：</span><br>
Even when all is lost, my valour to be remembered by none–<br>
<span style="color:#ff9900;">Repulse META ：</span><br>
I shall not yield, I shall not surrender, I shall not run–<br>
<span style="color:#ff9900;">Renown META ：</span><br>
Need I give my life for the good of all, it shall be done–<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Vanguard：</span><br>
Huh?! Have you taken the Royal Knights' pledge as well?<br>
<span style="color:#ff9900;">Renown META ：</span><br>
Yes, we have. I still remember it.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Vanguard：</span><br>
Marvellous! Then you're free to continue it with me!<br>
Our undying glory shall I remember, now and forever–<br>
Act without grace and honour in heart, shall I never–<br>
<span style="color:#ff9900;">Renown META：</span><br>
When my cannons roar, it shall be for my country–<br>
When I draw my sword, it shall point at my enemy–<br>
I am a Royal Knight, I protect our seas from threats–<br>
<span style="color:#ff9900;">Repulse META：</span><br>
I am a Royal Knight, I embody the sun that never sets–<br>
May this pledge guide my blade, may these words light my way–<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Vanguard：</span><br>
Glory to the Royal Navy! God save the Queen!<br>
<br>
Location unknown - Teleportation device<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Vanguard：</span><br>
This is where we part ways. Thank you for everything, Renown, Repulse.<br>
<span style="color:#ff9900;">Renown META ：</span><br>
It's just a shame we found nothing that may lead you to Her Majesty... Have you gathered enough samples?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Vanguard：</span><br>
I'd say so. This gate will stay open for a while longer, so we'll meet again before long.<br>
<span style="color:#ff9900;">Repulse META ：</span><br>
Safe travels! ...Wait, did she just say the gate will stay open?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Vanguard：</span><br>
Now just to find Her Majesty! Ladies, feed the other set of coordinates into the terminal!<br>

<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Monarch：</span><br>
Smoke, destruction, the putrid smells of war... Seems the coordinates led me to the right place.<br>
I detest being witness to Siren records, but I'll want to be thorough. First order of– Huh?!<br>
"Drake is out on a mission, I see. Are neither of you bothered by the fact she gets to do that, while we must attend this ceremony?"<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Neptune：</span><br>
"Oh dear. Monarch has entered whinge mode again."<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Monarch：</span><br>
What the... Neptune and Cheshire? They can't be out here...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Cheshire：</span><br>
"Me, I've got nothing to complain about as long as I've got food, sleep, and playtime with my Owner! You need to ease up a little."<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Monarch：</span><br>
"We are blueprint ships of the Royal Navy. While only one of us may be excellence itself, all of us should crave glory."<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Neptune：</span><br>
"I understand how you feel. Yes, we hardly ever get to sortie, and it's odd Her Majesty sent us here to train while an operation was ongoing. I won't deny that."<br>
"However, orders are orders. We'll have plenty of opportunities to shine – to imprint ourselves on the Commander's memory – in the future."<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Cheshire：</span><br>
"When my Owner needs us, we'll jump onto the stage and show the world what we're made of! I can see it now... Yes, Owner, headpat me more, please~"<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Monarch：</span><br>
"*sigh*... You two are lost causes."<br>
Hmph. So it's just a memory from before the ceremony. Damned Sirens, spying on us.<br>
It's going to take much more than that to dissuade me from carrying out my mission!<br>
There must be a Black Cube – or the means to a cure for Hood – somewhere in this Mirror Sea. I need only find it and bring it back to Camelot.<br>
Forgive me, Your Majesty, but no one but me may have the glory of this accomplishment!<br>

<span style="color:#4eb24e;">???：</span><br>
Hmm? Are you all alone out here?<br>
<br>
From the veil of black smoke suddenly emerged a white-haired girl clad in some type of naval uniform, facing Monarch.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Monarch：</span><br>
(Did I imagine it, or did her appearance change for just a flash?!)<br>
<span style="color:#ffd000;">???：</span><br>
Figures my disguise doesn't work on you. You've got a sharp eye.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Monarch：</span><br>
Who are you? An elite Siren?<br>
<span style="color:#ffd000;">???：</span><br>
Hey now, you're on my turf, so at least tell me your own name first. It's only polite, right?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Monarch：</span><br>
I am the Royal Navy blueprint ship Monarch. Now state your name.<br>
<span style="color:#ffd000;">Bon Homme Richard：</span><br>
Sure. I'm Bon Homme Richard, and this is my home for now. What are you doing here?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Monarch：</span><br>
(She doesn't appear to be a Siren, but she may be a Pawn. I'll want to keep my distance, just to–)<br>
<span style="color:#ffd000;">Bon Homme Richard：</span><br>
Be safe? No need to, I'm not a threat. We're both KAN-SEN, you and I!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Monarch：</span><br>
(She read my mind?! Whoever this girl is, she is no ordinary shipgirl. Perhaps she's META?)<br>
There's no use beating around the bush, then. I'm searching for a black Wisdom Cube, or rather, the remedy to the effects of one.<br>
<span style="color:#ffd000;">Bon Homme Richard：</span><br>
Oh! Guess what, you're in luck! You're talking to the world expert on METAmorphosis right now!<br>
METAmorphosis is a restructuring of the hull, whether or not induced by a Black Cube. It's a one-way trip with no turning back.<br>
I could explain all day, but as they say – show, don't tell. So let me show you what it feels like.<br>
<br>
The girl broke out into a sinister grin that only grew wider as she spoke more.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Monarch：</span><br>
You're right. Actions speak more than words, and hands-on experience teaches best.<br>
But I'll pass on your twisted offer. I've no interest in falling victim to METAmorphosis! Now get out of my way!<br>
<span style="color:#ffd000;">Bon Homme Richard：</span><br>
Hahaha! No, I get it. It's not like YOU could experience it just by wishing for it.<br>
Your hull is very special, for better or worse. You need a little help to jumpstart the process.<br>
See, you have hardly any essence compared to ordinary shipgirls. Which basically means, you're a tool to be used.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Monarch：</span><br>
You have some nerve. I'm not a tool, and I'm not being used.<br>
<span style="color:#ffd000;">Bon Homme Richard：</span><br>
Yes you are, and we both know it. Let's be real here.<br>
You know what your special status as a blueprint ship entails. You are an outcast, a defective monster kept on a tight leash for when your firepower is needed... Only to be discarded afterwards.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Monarch：</span><br>
Lies! I'm here right now entirely of my own volition!<br>
<span style="color:#ffd000;">Bon Homme Richard：</span><br>
Because you're a tool! You chase "glory," but what IS glory? Medals? Money? Oh, I know – it's in pursuit of the accomplishments your hull lacks in comparison to your peers!<br>
But don't you worry, lady. I shall give all that you ever want, and more.<br>
Succumb. All you need to reshape reality is enough power. Come, and I shall give you just that!<br>
<br>
The more the girl spoke, the more of her unassuming demeanor peeled off to reveal the insanity beneath. The sea around her churned, birthing a vortex that grew increasingly violent.<br>
Richard's lunacy invoked an instinctual fear in Monarch. She knew she had to get out of here – now.<br>
<span style="color:#696969;">Bon Homme Richard：</span><br>
Don't leave already. Stay here and have fun with me.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Monarch：</span><br>
Urgh? What?! Her voice is...?!<br>
GET OUT OF MY HEAD!<br>
<br>
KABOOOM!<br>
Monarch's voice boomed, and so too did her main cannons. She scored a crippling direct hit on Richard... or so she thought.<br>
<span style="color:#696969;">Bon Homme Richard：</span><br>
Nice shot there, lady. Just imagine what a devastating weapon you could be if you became META...<br>
Hahaha... Ahahahah! AHAHAHAHAHA! Light me up! Reduce me to a pile of ash!<br>
Release all your pent-up loneliness, bitterness, stress, and anger! Take it all out on me! Don't think, just SHOOT ME!<br>
<br>
KABOOOM!<br>
A moment's hesitation held back Monarch's trigger finger before she discharged the next shot, this time hitting the water to the left of Richard.<br>
<span style="color:#696969;">Bon Homme Richard：</span><br>
That one missed. You're holding yourself back, lady. Or maybe you just don't know where to shoot a person?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Monarch：</span><br>
Shut your gob!<br>
<span style="color:#696969;">Bon Homme Richard：</span><br>
It's no big deal. I'll teach you the ABC of it.<br>
This is the head, this is the heart. If you want someone dead, those are where you start. Easy to remember, right?<br>
<br>
KABOOOM!<br>
<span style="color:#696969;">Bon Homme Richard：</span><br>
There you go! Now we're cooking!<br>
Still, I can sense you're clinging on to a shred of sanity... Fine, have it your way! Let's throw some friends into the mix!<br>
{{折叠面板|内容结束}}

{{折叠面板|标题=Queenly Rescue|选项=9|主框=1|样式=primary|展开=是}}
<br>
KABOOOM!<br>
<span style="color:#696969;">Bon Homme Richard：</span><br>
What you just shot dead was only a phantom. The real me's on the right. Go on, try to guess which one.<br>
<br>
KABOOOM!<br>
<span style="color:#696969;">Bon Homme Richard：</span><br>
Nope~♪ Not that one, lady.<br>
<br>
Monarch unleashed a volley so fierce it all but burned away the rifling of her barrels. A blink of the eye later, Richard had vanished.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Monarch：</span><br>
So that's your true form, is it? This black tornado?<br>
<span style="color:#696969;">Bon Homme Richard：</span><br>
This black what? You're not making any sense.<br>
<br>
The black tornado shot out a column of pure energy aimed straight at Monarch. But, the instant before it could hit, the sea was lit up by a white flash.<br>
The raging winds slowed, and when the light dimmed, Bon Homme Richard's clones had been swept away.<br>
<span style="color:#696969;">Bon Homme Richard：</span><br>
More visitors? Boy, today's a busy day.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Queen Elizabeth：</span><br>
Keep your evil hands off Monarch!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Monarch：</span><br>
Y-Your Majesty?!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Queen Elizabeth：</span><br>
In the flesh! Expect an earful after this for using Camelot without my permission!<br>
<span style="color:#696969;">Bon Homme Richard：</span><br>
Heh. I thought you were alone – turns out, you led your friends right to me!<br>
Thanks a bunch, lady! Now let's treat you all to the main event!<br>
<br>
Just as the last word left Richard's mouth, the auburn skies dimmed into darkness, the black tornado bellowing with fury once more.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Belfast：</span><br>
Your Majesty, the energy output at Camelot is rapidly fluctuating! We are losing the teleporter's connection to it!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Queen Elizabeth：</span><br>
This maniac can reach Camelot with her powers?! It's no wonder those terminal coordinates showed up out of nowhere!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Neptune：</span><br>
What shall we do, Your Majesty? Fighting a storm is a radical idea to say the least!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Cheshire：</span><br>
Wait, so have we lost our way back to Camelot?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Belfast：</span><br>
Sheffield is grappling with the terminal controls. It will take some time, but we should be able to return to our point of origin.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Monarch：</span><br>
Time is something we don't have! The tornado will wipe us all out if we don't leave RIGHT NOW!<br>
(Of all the things that could've happened! Everyone including Her Majesty will perish if someone doesn't do something...!)<br>
Your Majesty, you must fall back at once! I shall hold her attention!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Queen Elizabeth：</span><br>
You will not die on my watch! Why do you think I'm out here, risking my own life?!<br>
Emergency measures! Create a gate that leads to any random set of coordinates within Camelot!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Monarch：</span><br>
That's too dangerous, Your Majesty! We don't know where it may take us!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Queen Elizabeth：</span><br>
Can't be any bloody worse than here! Radio Sheffield and tell her to run an emergency powerup of Camelot!<br>
And erase the coordinates on this terminal so that psychopath can't come after us!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Belfast：</span><br>
Understood!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Monarch：</span><br>
...Roger that!<br>
<br>
Just in the nick of time, the girls managed to escape the Mirror Sea before a tsunami created by the tornado could engulf them.<br>

<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Indomitable：</span><br>
Here we are at the second set of coordinates... I already see equipment similar to what's in Camelot littering the place.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Revenge：</span><br>
The last location was covered in woodlands. This one has some sort of structure instead.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Bellona：</span><br>
They don't look Royal in origin. They're more reminiscent of something from the Eagle Union.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Jervis：</span><br>
I'm reminded of the place the Commander described seeing during that visit to the Northern Parliament. Arcana something?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Indomitable：</span><br>
Safe to assume they're Siren structures connected to Camelot and the META in one way or another.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Vanguard：</span><br>
We have a real laundry list of things to report once we get back. The METAs we met, the samples, this place...<br>
I don't get the feeling we'll find people here, though. The building on that island sticks out to me, so let's go there first.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Indomitable：</span><br>
Vanguard, excuse me, shouldn't I do some aerial reconnaissance before we go anywhere?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Vanguard：</span><br>
Oh, right. Sorry, I'm a bit out of it after parting ways with Renown and Repulse.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Indomitable：</span><br>
You're the leader here – you mustn't go all absentminded on us. Pull yourself together, please.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Vanguard：</span><br>
You're right. Let me get my bearings straight, then we'll continue.<br>
Get your planes to a high altitude ASAP. If the Commander's intel is right, these structures have advanced defence systems.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Indomitable：</span><br>
What in the world...? Forget any defences, I just laid eyes on something far more bizarre.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Vanguard：</span><br>
Huh? What?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Indomitable：</span><br>
That island you mentioned? There are Siren mass-produced ships anchored there.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Vanguard：</span><br>
Blimey... Don't tell me we've got a hornets' nest in our hands here.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Indomitable：</span><br>
But wait, there's more. There's an entire fleet of merchant vessels from all factions parked just next to them.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Revenge：</span><br>
This reminds me of the time Sardegna investigated that maze... Do you think they could be ships the Sirens captured?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Indomitable：</span><br>
It's possible. The good news is, the Siren ships are all ancient models. We can take them on and win with minimal damage.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Vanguard：</span><br>
Any trace of Her Majesty?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Indomitable：</span><br>
None that I can spot from this high up. We'll need to search the structure's interior if we're to find anything. How annoying...<br>
...Hang on! I can see signs of fighting over by that island!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Bellona：</span><br>
That has to either be a Siren experiment, or a clash with the META.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Indomitable：</span><br>
Vanguard, shall we have a look there first? We're at a disadvantage if we're caught in a firefight inside the structure.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Vanguard：</span><br>
That, plus we need to remove any potential threats to the gate's integrity.<br>
We're all doomed if we find Her Majesty but lose our ticket back to Scapa Flow.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Indomitable：</span><br>
Sounds like we have a plan, then. Thank god this way I can cruise instead of having to travel on foot.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Vanguard：</span><br>
Cruising beats walking, but fighting's way more tiring. Unfortunately for us, it's looking like we'll need to do just that.<br>

<br>
Location unknown - Mirror Sea<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Bellona：</span><br>
It seems they dispatched them quickly. There's not a Siren left in sight.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Revenge：</span><br>
I hope it was Her Majesty's fleet.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Indomitable：</span><br>
We'll know before long. There's a battle taking place just up ahead.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Vanguard：</span><br>
Look's like it's... Monarch! Why is she all by herself?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Indomitable：</span><br>
Strange. Her Majesty, her maids, and our other blueprint ships aren't with her.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Vanguard：</span><br>
The question is if she's truly our Monarch, or someone else... Her identification signal checks out, for what it's worth.<br>
If it is her, that means Her Majesty has gotten separated from one of her escorts... A bad sign.<br>
Salutations! I am Vanguard, head of Her Majesty's Mirror Sea Expedition Fleet! Monarch, please confirm that is you!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Monarch：</span><br>
Vanguard! So it was your fleet Warspite referred to when she spoke of that "expedition team."<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Vanguard：</span><br>
Phew. It really is you. How did you get here? Through Camelot, like us?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Monarch：</span><br>
Yes. I can only assume the situation must be dire if they sent you into this place.<br>
Tell me, do you know where Her Majesty has gone?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Indomitable：</span><br>
We were hoping you'd know. She, Belfast, and a number of blueprint ships were declared missing just this morning.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Monarch：</span><br>
I did see Her Majesty not long ago, actually. I activated Camelot to go to a Mirror Sea, where I encountered an indescribable foe.<br>
Her Majesty and her entourage ended up there as well. We fled together, but after warping to a random location, I found myself here, alone.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Vanguard：</span><br>
It sounds to me like there's a very good chance Her Majesty is somewhere in this place as well. Don't worry, we'll find her – it's why we're here.<br>
Indomitable, tell Janus to send in reinforcements. I don't know who this "indescribable foe" is, but I'm not taking any risks with someone who forced Her Majesty to flee.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Indomitable：</span><br>
Will do. Incidentally, this is my first time seeing a blueprint ship in person. It's a pleasure.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Jervis：</span><br>
They're a rare sight, as they seldom get to participate in regular operations. Well met, I'm Jervis.<br>
It seems you've been injured. Allow me to patch you up.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Monarch：</span><br>
Thank you. I feel emboldened, knowing I have you all to watch my back.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Bellona：</span><br>
Well, well, it seems a challenger has appeared.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Revenge：</span><br>
Challenger? Um, Bellona, now's not the time for a duel...<br>
I know you'd like to spar with Monarch, but this is a Mirror–<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Monarch：</span><br>
She's not talking about me, Revenge. Look.<br>
<span style="color:#ffd000;">Purifier ：</span><br>
About time you all showed up! What took ya so long?<br>
{{折叠面板|内容结束}}

<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Vanguard：</span><br>
Oi! It's Purifier!<br>
<span style="color:#ffd000;">Purifier ：</span><br>
Yeah, it's me, what's up.<br>
Don't answer that – what's up is, on top of you being late, you smashed up like six thousand ships when we were SUPPOSED to do this on the quiet!<br>
I suffered the headache of plotting a safe route for you, and you pay me back by putting an entire patrol fleet outta commission!<br>
What, did you think nobody would realize if you just sank everything in sight? Assholes!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Vanguard：</span><br>
What in god's name is she on about?<br>
<span style="color:#ffd000;">Purifier ：</span><br>
*sigh*... What's done is done, yada yada. Let's get this show on the road.<br>
Put on your booties, stow away your planes, and form a line. We're going on a field trip, children.<br>
You! The destroyer! ...Are you even a destroyer? Hella stacked for one.<br>
Hang on, this ain't the lineup I heard about. All right, roll call! Raise your hand when you hear your name!<br>
Renown! Repulse! Vanguard! Jervis!<br>
...Some of you called in sick, huh. Oh well, whatever.<br>
Listen up – we're going straight to Point Berth. No detours, no bathroom breaks, nothing.<br>
You're under Antiochus' command while you're here. Don't start anything if you don't wanna sully the good Doctor's name any further.<br>
C'mon, it's time to go see Elizabeth. Y'all ready?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Indomitable：</span><br>
Umm... Was she talking to us this whole time?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Vanguard：</span><br>
No clue. For all I know, she just spent the last minute monologuing.<br>
All I caught was "Elizabeth." Maybe she can point us in the general direction of Her Majesty...<br>
All right, ladies. Let us follow this Siren and see what she has in store for us.<br>
<span style="color:#ffd000;">Purifier ：</span><br>
There ya go. Follow the teacher, children. AND DON'T! SHOOT! ANYTHING! I swear to god if you do!<br>

<br>
Led by Purifier, the fleet made its way into a great facility on an island.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Revenge：</span><br>
Good gosh, look at these mass-produced ships and defence structures... I've never seen a Siren facility this well-guarded before.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Jervis：</span><br>
What's more interesting is how they're seemingly completely unaware of us.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Bellona：</span><br>
It appears she wasn't lying about plotting out a safe route. We are indebted to your mastery of the art of stealth, Purifier.<br>
<span style="color:#ffd000;">Purifier ：</span><br>
Aww, you're makin' me blush!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Revenge：</span><br>
...Am I the only one who's feeling even a little tense?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Indomitable：</span><br>
Me, I've given up on trying to make sense of what's even going on.<br>
<span style="color:#ffd000;">Purifier ：</span><br>
Don't worry your pretty little heads. This here permanent anchorage is perfectly safe.<br>
The security here's so tight, even those edgelords won't come near it.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Vanguard：</span><br>
Permanent anchorage? What, for shipgirls? Why would you Sirens need that?<br>
<span style="color:#ffd000;">Purifier ：</span><br>
Humans totally flipped out after the Richard incident, remember? So, Antiochus started gaining traction because we don't go nuts like your kind.<br>
In any case, once you've picked up Elizabeth, scram back to port and don't ever come back here again!<br>
Also, I'm only gonna say this one more time! DO! NOT! SHOOT! ANYTHING! You already owe us for the damage you've done!<br>
The Doctor's reputation is at stake here!<br>
{{折叠面板|内容结束}}

{{折叠面板|标题=Last Warning|选项=14|主框=1|样式=primary|展开=是}}
<span style="color:#ffd000;">Purifier ：</span><br>
This is as far as I can go. The permanent anchorage is just up ahead.<br>
You'll find Elizabeth in there. Steer clear of the surveillance cameras and you'll be fine.<br>
Go get her then make a break for it. Don't go messing with stuff, and don't make a damn scene!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Jervis：</span><br>
Not to be rude, but you've been making a scene since we first met you...<br>
<span style="color:#ffd000;">Purifier ：</span><br>
What was that, you little–<br>
<br>
...What? You gotta be shittin' me, Observer! You want me to take THAT thing on by myself?! Ugghh!<br>
<br>
Purifier suddenly became possessed, and just as suddenly went back to normal. Without saying another word, she turned her back on the shipgirls and ran off.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Bellona：</span><br>
Vanguard, I have a clear shot. Shall I?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Vanguard：</span><br>
Hold your fire. She's up to something, but rescuing Her Majesty comes first.<br>

<br>
Deep inside Point Berth – a mysterious permanent anchorage within a Mirror Sea – the search party finally located their missing person.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Vanguard：</span><br>
Your Majesty! Please forgive us for not finding you sooner!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Queen Elizabeth：</span><br>
If it isn't Vanguard! And Monarch, too.<br>
I commend you for all your efforts.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Jervis：</span><br>
Your Majesty, are you all right? Please allow me to tend to any of your injuries.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Queen Elizabeth：</span><br>
I'm fine. Go give a hand to Cheshire and Neptune in the kitchen instead.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Bellona：</span><br>
Your Majesty, it is unwise to remain here for long. Kindly follow us back to Camelot.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Queen Elizabeth：</span><br>
No need. There may be no clear way out of here, though it is extremely safe.<br>
I know what you're thinking. "But this place is crawling with Sirens." Yes, it's normal to react that way. It took me a while to grasp the situation as well.<br>
In short, this facility – nay, this very Mirror Sea – is for conducting Reenactments.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Indomitable：</span><br>
All of it? Was our encounter with Purifier just before all part of the act as well?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Queen Elizabeth：</span><br>
That's right. She's just another vessel for the script, so to speak.<br>
Neptune, Cheshire, and I decided to play along, and she brought us here just like that.<br>
Now, Vanguard and Monarch, fill me in on what happened on your end.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Vanguard：</span><br>
I see... You heard Her Majesty bemoan how hard it'd be to find a cure for Hood, so you decided to take matters into your own hands?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Monarch：</span><br>
Yes. After activating Camelot, it took me to a destination where I ran into a goblin by the name of Bon Homme Richard. Then Her Majesty appeared and saved me.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Vanguard：</span><br>
There's no defending such recklessness even if you had noble intentions! You nearly got Her Majesty killed!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Monarch：</span><br>
You're right. There is no excusing it, and there is no denying this was my fault.<br>
My selfish desire for acknowledgement nearly cost us everything...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Vanguard：</span><br>
Please tell me you had some sort of plan! Or did you rush headfirst all alone into a Mirror Sea, expecting to find a lead on a Black Cube?!<br>
I don't have to remind you how dangerous handling one is. Did you think being a blueprint ship makes you immune to–<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Queen Elizabeth：</span><br>
That's enough. She has already expressed remorse for her actions.<br>
Besides, everyone made it out alive, and your expedition team has procured information pertaining to a cure for Hood. Everything worked out in the end.<br>
There are only two things I'm wondering about... First, Monarch, what exactly were those coordinates you saw?<br>
And second, what drove you to jump into Camelot without any support or supplies?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Vanguard：</span><br>
I'm wondering as well...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Queen Elizabeth：</span><br>
It goes beyond plain curiosity. The teleporter cannot be operated by one person. How did you manage to use it?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Monarch：</span><br>
To answer your questions, the coordinates were already entered on the terminal when I found it.<br>
I hardly even touched anything. I just stepped onto the platform, and the warp sequence initiated by itself.<br>
When it finished, I was in that Mirror Sea with Richard. She urged me to "become META," and when I refused, she attacked me.<br>
Or rather, she subjected me to haunting visions, then she summoned a giant tornado out of thin air.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Vanguard：</span><br>
And just when it was about to take you, Her Majesty appeared, huh.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Queen Elizabeth：</span><br>
Correct. After our arrival, Richard did something to Camelot's energy output, causing it to fluctuate horribly.<br>
The tornado would've annihilated not only us, but also Camelot in its entirety if we hadn't resorted to drastic measures to get out of there.<br>
Whoever this Richard is, she has made it clear that not only is she a great threat in her own Mirror Sea, but also that she can manipulate Camelot.<br>
I've no doubt in my mind the whole teleporter incident was a trap laid by her.<br>
(But then... where did the other coordinates leading to those META ships come from?)<br>
Hmm... I've changed my mind. Vanguard, tell Janus to prepare the gate to take us back at once.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Vanguard：</span><br>
Yes, Your Majesty!<br>
<br>
Some time later...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Queen Elizabeth：</span><br>
"Point Berth"... Bah, it's just a detainment facility with a fancy name. That talk about "the other Elizabeth" being here is all nons–<br>
<br>
Elizabeth put her cup of Neptune's tea to her lips, and before she could finish speaking, her vision faded to black.<br>

<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Monarch：</span><br>
What's going on...? This isn't where I was a minute ago...<br>
<br>
For some reason, Monarch found herself transported from the Siren facility and into the Royal Navy's training grounds she was so used to.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Monarch：</span><br>
"Gunnery practice finished. Moving on to weapons inspection and maintenance."<br>
This feeling in my head... It's the same as when I met Richard. Bastard! Stop making visions out of my memories!<br>
"That's that done. Next, refining my swordsmanship."<br>
"HAHH!"<br>
<br>
The vision showed Monarch hoisting her sword and swinging down with great force.<br>
She is a blueprint ship who sees herself as the embodiment of excellence. Yet she was not allowed to fight side by side with George and Wales. This fact caused her misery.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Monarch：</span><br>
"If I were as carefree as Cheshire or Neptune, I would never have reached this level of mastery."<br>
"I cannot be like them. I am Monarch. I've pledged loyalty to Her Majesty, and my duty is to one day become the paragon of glory."<br>
......<br>
"After a day of training and patrolling, the sun sets upon the horizon once more."<br>
"Her Majesty has lauded my potential, but does she truly expect anything from me?"<br>
"It makes me wonder... What is my purpose? Why do I exist?"<br>
The only thing I've done today is disappoint Her Majesty and everyone else...<br>
How am I supposed to redeem myself...<br>
{{折叠面板|内容结束}}

{{折叠面板|标题=Remembrance - Monarch, Sickbed|选项=17|主框=1|样式=primary|展开=是}}
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Hood：</span><br>
"Why, hello there, Monarch."<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Monarch：</span><br>
"Wales said you'd been hospitalised. What happened?"<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Hood：</span><br>
"Don't worry, it's just my old wounds acting up a little. I'll be cleared to leave in just three days."<br>
"You brought me lunch? My, you're too kind."<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Monarch：</span><br>
A different memory this time... What the hell is the point of this, Richard?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Hood：</span><br>
"I'm afraid this is a bit much to eat alone, though... Oh, I know. Why don't you stay and enjoy it with me?"<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Monarch：</span><br>
I stuck around and decided to confide in Hood after a while of conversing with her.<br>
"No, it's nothing in the way of romance... It's just... I feel miserable, always being kept away from the frontlines."<br>
"We are shipgirls, we are Her Majesty's swords. What purpose do our lives have if we cannot fight?"<br>
...And what purpose is there to my training, if I will never get to see the battlefield like my sisters in arms?<br>
"Hood, you must have an idea of what Her Majesty wants from me. I need to know – how can I seize glory for the Royal Navy?"<br>
<br>
Hood did not return an immediate response to Monarch abruptly opening up.<br>
Not because she couldn't sympathize – quite the opposite – but because she wanted to give Monarch a minute to sort her own emotions out.<br>
Hood's style of solving problems is to let her conversation partner speak their mind in full, then she offers her advice.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Monarch：</span><br>
"...S-sorry. I lost my composure there."<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Hood：</span><br>
"Don't be. I understand why you feel the way you do."<br>
"All I'll say is this. Glory is not always something tangible that can be grasped."<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Monarch：</span><br>
"What... does that mean?"<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Hood：</span><br>
"The glory you seek is the feeling of being needed by others – of being admired by others."<br>
"As for what I seek... That would be elegance, of course. Hehe~"<br>
<br>
Hood giggled, and Monarch looked strangely reassured. Then, the memory of the patient room slowly dissipated into mist.<br>

{{折叠面板|标题=Remembrance - Monarch, Briefing|选项=18|主框=1|样式=primary|展开=是}}
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Hood：</span><br>
"Thank you for coming. It would be my pleasure to contribute to this operation with a speech and tactical advice."<br>
<br>
Morale was high among the Royal Navy during Operation Siren. They were eager to join arms with the Eagle Union and repel the Sirens from the NA Ocean.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Monarch：</span><br>
This goes further back... The other blueprint ships and I were put in the reserve and ordered to guard the Royal Islands.<br>
"Another operation where I don't get the sortie order..."<br>
<br>
The handful of girls who weren't part of the operation proper were gathered in a briefing room on the Royal Islands.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Monarch：</span><br>
"I recognise her... That's Vanguard, of Her Majesty's palace guard."<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Vanguard：</span><br>
"*sigh*... Stuck here again while the others brave the frontlines."<br>
"Standing guard during Her Majesty's meetings is an important duty, sure, but I was hoping for a little action."<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Monarch：</span><br>
I felt a strange sense of closeness to her after overhearing her little monologue.<br>
She scarcely sees any action as she's usually tasked with VIP protection... I, meanwhile, am a blueprint ship who is next to impossible to field.<br>
"...It makes me wonder. What is 'glory' to her?"<br>
"As a shipgirl and a Royal Knight, she must yearn to fight alongside her compatriots as well."<br>
"We've both been relegated to benchwarmer duty, it seems."<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Vanguard：</span><br>
"Hm? Yeah, apparently. I'm going to be restless for a good while."<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Monarch：</span><br>
"Likewise. Say, you know about the upcoming exercise? Why don't we have a friendly duel around then?"<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Vanguard：</span><br>
"I'm up for that. Let me just check if my schedule allows for it..."<br>
"...Oh, it seems sadly not. I have important business on the day of the exercise."<br>
"But rest assured, we will have our duel the next time the circumstances permit it!"<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Monarch：</span><br>
My chance to ask Vanguard how she felt about being excluded from Operation Siren slipped me by...<br>
Looking back at it now, what even was that "important business"?<br>
{{折叠面板|内容结束}}

{{折叠面板|标题=Remembrance - Monarch, Coverup|选项=19|主框=1|样式=primary|展开=是}}
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">King George V：</span><br>
"Her Majesty may be powerful, but she cannot conveniently summon Sirens out of thin air."<br>
"Therefore, it falls on us to repel the imaginary invaders."<br>
<br>
This time, Monarch was shown a memory not hers. The time was right after Elizabeth had made the call to cancel the ceremony.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Monarch：</span><br>
Huh... This must be when George's fleet set out to intercept the Sirens.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">King George V：</span><br>
"We've never played the role of Sirens before, but our first portrayal must be convincing."<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Monarch：</span><br>
...What? Does this not mean the Sirens were never responsible for the air raid?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">King George V：</span><br>
"Hood's illness has flared up, and she cannot deliver her speech."<br>
"To conceal this fact, and to corroborate our coverup story of an air raid, we will need to sink a few of our own mass-produced patrol ships."<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Monarch：</span><br>
Her Majesty truly went to great lengths to keep Hood's declining health a secret...<br>
I'll accompany them on this sacrificial battle. As thanks for giving me this information.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">King George V：</span><br>
"Make sure their wrecks are left with absolutely no recoverable data or damages that can be traced back to us."<br>
"As for our alibi, it is as follows – we left Scapa Flow and shot down the Siren aircraft, but not before they took out some patrol ships. Understood?"<br>
"Good. Just a few more, and that should do it."<br>

<br>
The flash of a cannon broke the vision into pieces that rearranged themselves into a different scene – the patient room from before.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Monarch：</span><br>
Hood...<br>
<br>
Monarch leaned over Hood in her sickbed and whispered her name, expecting no response.<br>
Medical devices littered the floor all around them, screens showing Hood's weak vital signs updated in real time.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Monarch：</span><br>
......<br>
<br>
The room was dead silent, save for the sound of Hood's faint breaths.<br>
The sickness caused by the Black Cube had reduced her to this. If someone didn't find a cure for her, the sickness would soon take her.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Monarch：</span><br>
…………………………………………<br>
<br>
Before Monarch left for Camelot, she swore a promise under her breath.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Monarch：</span><br>
"My glory is the feeling of being needed by others... of being admired by others."<br>
"Even when all is lost, my valour to be remembered by none..."<br>
"Need I give my life for the good of all... it shall be done."<br>

<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Monarch：</span><br>
Yes. This is just after I'd reached the teleporter.<br>
"So this is Camelot. The Mirror Sea beyond the gate, hidden within Scapa Flow..."<br>
"And this seems to be the device that 'links it to other areas.' Must be a teleporter of some kind."<br>
<br>
She paid no mind to the gorgeous greenery around her and instead went straight into the castle hall, as if led by an invisible hand.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Monarch：</span><br>
"Coordinates? Did Her Majesty leave these? ...No, I know where these will take me."<br>
"Somewhere in this place is a lead on a cure. And I'm going to find it..."<br>
I'm never making the same mistake again. Your visions will not lead me astray.<br>
I am Monarch! I am excellence given form!<br>

<span style="color:#ff9900;">Repulse META ：</span><br>
I guess it's just us two again, sis.<br>
Nothing's changed in the end. Though it was pretty all right having guests over.<br>
Can you believe they came all the way out here to save a friend? Sirens probably have them on their knees.<br>
<span style="color:#ff9900;">Renown META ：</span><br>
Indeed. It's a shame there's nothing we can do to help anyone anymore.<br>
<span style="color:#ff9900;">Repulse META ：</span><br>
Nothing? Vanguard said they have a way out of this place. Their gate, remember?<br>
I'll bet we can catch up with them if we head out right now.<br>
<span style="color:#ff9900;">Renown META ：</span><br>
...Wait, you're saying we can leave?<br>
...Oh, lord. I'm such an idiot!<br>
Yes, we must head out immediately. Those girls are likely going to need our help.<br>

"I'll need to work on it a bit more, but hey, practice makes perfect. I'll nail it soon enough."<br>
"Thanks for taking the time to help me practice my special move today."<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Bellona：</span><br>
"Don't mention it. Your technique is very unique... Would you mind performing it again someday? I'd like to study it for myself."<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Vanguard：</span><br>
"Uhh... Yeah, sure. Someday."<br>
"Truth be told, I learned it just from watching someone else. I don't think I can teach it directly, per se."<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Bellona：</span><br>
"That's fine, and thank you. I want to explore its potential as a flashy feint. It could work on some opponents."<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Repulse：</span><br>
...I don't think they realise we're here. You reckon this is one of Vanguard's memories?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Renown：</span><br>
I'd suspect so. Perhaps that's why we look the way we did pre-METAmorphosis – Vanguard only knew a Renown and Repulse by these appearances.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Vanguard：</span><br>
"Better start wrapping things up. Someone needs to guard Her Majesty."<br>
"The Royal Maids are plenty for that... but I digress. A Royal Knight must not be picky about her assignments."<br>
"Hope Bellona won't ask who exactly I learned the move from... If anyone finds out it was an anime character, my life is over."<br>
"...You know what, better not use it at the next exercise. Too risky."<br>
"Good, honest practice and hard work win battles. Not flashy special moves."<br>

Scene change, eh. Whose memory is it this time?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Vanguard：</span><br>
"...Yup, that's traditional stargazy pie, made the same way it has been for hundreds of ye–"<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Jervis：</span><br>
"Please, you don't need to sugarcoat it. It's crystal clear that you think it's nasty."<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Repulse：</span><br>
Seems like there's no branch where it tastes good.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Jervis：</span><br>
"*sigh*... How deplorable after I spent a considerable amount of time making it."<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Repulse：</span><br>
Oh yeah, it does take a while to make. I'd nearly forgotten.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Jervis：</span><br>
"I'll ask Repulse for some pointers before I try it again. Renown has told me she knows how to make it good."<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Repulse：</span><br>
Me? Sure, I can show you how to make it.<br>
It's still going to taste rubbish regardless of how you prepare it, though.<br>
Sis, I know you complimented the flavour and all, but you didn't have to clean your plate just to be polite.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Renown：</span><br>
Pardon? I wasn't being polite. It was genuinely delicious.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Repulse：</span><br>
You're serious? Then you've got some very unusual tastes.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Vanguard：</span><br>
"Erp... Forgetting about the pie for a second, what's for supper tonight?"<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Repulse：</span><br>
She'll be starving when that rolls around. What DID Jervis make for supper back then?<br>
Lasagna, was it? Filled with stringy Sardegnian cheese. I only remember it 'cause we all loved it so much.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Vanguard：</span><br>
"...Sardegnian lasagna? All right! I can hardly wait!"<br>

Hang on, this feels familiar... It's one of our memories, isn't it?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Purifier ：</span><br>
"Eyy. Right on time."<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Repulse：</span><br>
"Actually, you're late, Antiochus. Or should I call you Purifier?"<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Purifier ：</span><br>
"Uh, no? You guys just got here early."<br>
"And without smashing up our stuff on the way, at that. Wish ol' Enterprise would be as well-behaved as you."<br>
"Now remember, this is a stealth mission. I've got a safe course plotted out that'll get ya right past security and inside Point Berth."<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Indomitable：</span><br>
"Wonderful. The less I have to fight, the better."<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Purifier ：</span><br>
"If you're not raring for a fight then stow away your damn planes! You wanna save Elizabeth, you gotta holster your weapons!"<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Indomitable：</span><br>
"All right, all right. Goodness, you Antiochus sure have gotten expressive over time."<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Purifier ：</span><br>
"Excuse me, melon mounds, I've been expressive since day one."<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Indomitable：</span><br>
"I meant in terms of your personality. You used to be so robotic and alien."<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Purifier ：</span><br>
"Oh, that. That's 'cause Observer's been promoting learning more about human civilization and culture and stuff."<br>
"Injecting countless hours of humanity's garbage straight into your memory base does things to your personality."<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Indomitable：</span><br>
"Humanity's garbage? What does that refer to?"<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Purifier ：</span><br>
"Movies, video games, comics, everything. Didn't even have to sit down and consume them the traditional way like you KAN-SEN gotta."<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Vanguard：</span><br>
"Let's get a move on already. We've wasted enough time on chit-chat."<br>
"Point Berth is just up ahead, right? Lead the way, Purifier."<br>
"Hopefully Lady Elizabeth is still alive..."<br>

<span style="color:#ff9900;">Repulse META ：</span><br>
...Looks like the visions are over. We're back, sis.<br>
<span style="color:#ff9900;">Renown META ：</span><br>
What a relief. We're back to reality.<br>
Do you think Vanguard's team has come back? Based on the fact their memories were among those we witnessed.<br>
<span style="color:#ff9900;">Repulse META ：</span><br>
Can't say. All I know is the situation's dire. We need to find and warn them about this.<br>
<span style="color:#ff9900;">Renown META ：</span><br>
You're right. We must head for their gate posthaste.<br>
<span style="color:#ff9900;">Repulse META ：</span><br>
...Look! Someone just came through it!<br>
<span style="color:#ff9900;">Renown META ：</span><br>
Oh! It must be Vanguard and company!<br>
<span style="color:#ff9900;">Repulse META ：</span><br>
No, not quite... Their numbers and looks don't match.<br>
<span style="color:#ff9900;">Renown META ：</span><br>
Numbers? But if it isn't them, who could it–<br>
<span style="color:#ff9900;">Repulse META ：</span><br>
It's Warspite?! Plus Sheffield and some others!<br>
Phew. If I had to guess, I think they're reinforcements from Vanguard's branch.<br>
<span style="color:#ff9900;">Renown META ：</span><br>
We're in luck, then! We'd better go introduce our–<br>

<span style="color:#ff9900;">Renown META ：</span><br>
What? What's the matter?<br>
<span style="color:#ff9900;">Repulse META ：</span><br>
Did you forget we're META? And Ashes members, to boot? They'll shoot at us if we're not careful!<br>
<span style="color:#ff9900;">Renown META ：</span><br>
Oh dear. You're right. But then what should we...<br>
Wait, I know! Use the broom again! Pretend you're sweeping the ground!<br>
Once they've established you're not a threat, I'll come forth and explain everything!<br>
<span style="color:#ff9900;">Repulse META ：</span><br>
It's a silly plan... but I think it's going to work!<br>
Let's be quick, then find Vanguard's team and help them!<br>

<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Cheshire：</span><br>
"Your Majestyyyyy! You need to hear this!"<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Belfast：</span><br>
"What brings you here this late in the evening, Miss Cheshire and Miss Neptune?"<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Neptune：</span><br>
"Miss Head Maid, please, we must speak with Her Majesty at once."<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Belfast：</span><br>
"I'm terribly sorry, but Her Majesty is hard at work at the moment. If you so wish, I could relay your message to her later."<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Queen Elizabeth：</span><br>
"Forget the message, Bel. And forget my work – Cheshire's caterwauling utterly ruined my focus!"<br>
"*sigh*... Let them talk."<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Cheshire：</span><br>
"Sorry for that, Your Majesty! But this is way more important than any work!"<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Queen Elizabeth：</span><br>
"Stop shouting already! Speak like a normal person and tell me what happened."<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Cheshire：</span><br>
"Well, thing is... Monarch has gone missing!"<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Queen Elizabeth：</span><br>
"...What?"<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Neptune：</span><br>
"When I went to invite her over for tea after the ceremony, she had the dourest expression I'd ever seen."<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Cheshire：</span><br>
"I'm worried she might've done something bad..."<br>
"Since she wasn't even at the ceremony, maybe her disappearance has something to do with how she's never really gotten to sortie?"<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Neptune：</span><br>
"You may be on to something. She abruptly began grieving about glory and such before the ceremony, though I dismissed it as her simply being a sourpuss."<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Queen Elizabeth：</span><br>
"Then where might she be now? Have our patrols around Scapa Flow reported anything?"<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Belfast：</span><br>
"Not at the moment. However, Sheffield claimed to have seen Monarch heading in the direction of the Singularity's entrance."<br>
"She speculated that she may intend to enter Camelot."<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Queen Elizabeth：</span><br>
"Alone? What is she thinking? We must check on Camelot at once!"<br>
"What?! The teleporter's been used!"<br>
"What's more, these coordinates point to a place we haven't explored! This couldn't be any worse!"<br>
"Bel, Sheffy, Neptune, Cheshire! Change of plans! We'll activate Camelot immediately and bring Monarch back!"<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Sheffield：</span><br>
"If I may interject, I believe this problem is best left to King George and the Expedition Fleet."<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Queen Elizabeth：</span><br>
"We cannot afford to wait for them. If Monarch activated the teleporter to search for a Black Cube, we have to go after her at once."<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Sheffield：</span><br>
"I understand. In that case, please allow me the task of managing the terminals and communications."<br>
<br>
Without the time to call in the experts, all the girls save for Sheffield rushed onto the teleporter platform and initiated the warp.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Queen Elizabeth：</span><br>
"I hope no harm has come to Monarch, or else Hood will never forgive herself...!"<br>

<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Revenge：</span><br>
Your Majesty! Please wake up!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Queen Elizabeth：</span><br>
Ugh... Wh-what...? I thought I was in Camelot...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Revenge：</span><br>
Your confusion is understandable, Your Majesty. I've reason to believe the Sirens subjected us to a vision of sorts.<br>
Based on what the Commander's report said, all they did was project us into our own memories, or past events from this Mirror Sea.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Queen Elizabeth：</span><br>
Now I remember. It was right before we used the teleporter to... Hang on a bloody minute! What is happening here?!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Bellona：</span><br>
That black tornado appeared outside Point Berth while you were unconscious, Your Majesty.<br>
And along with it came a fleet of mass-produced Siren ships and Pawns.<br>
Unbelievably, the Siren ships and defences around the perimeter responded by attacking these new enemies. They are mid-engagement as we speak.<br>
It's unfortunately impossible to ascertain the scope of the battle due to the strange mist surrounding the Siren fleet.<br>
But, luckily, our means of escape is ready. What shall we do, Your Majesty? Do we circle past the enemy?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Queen Elizabeth：</span><br>
No – we'll charge straight through the centre.<br>
Neither the Sirens nor the facility defences should open fire on us if what Purifier said is true.<br>
Our best course of action is to take the quickest way to the gate, while those other Sirens are busy.<br>
There's our plan, Royal Navy! Form a column and sail for the gate at full speed!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Revenge：</span><br>
Understood! Please stay behind me, Your Majesty!<br>

<br>
As the horizon darkened slowly with the black tornado's appearance, specks of lights started appearing in the sky, twinkling like stars.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Indomitable：</span><br>
Would you buzz off? I am TRYING to help my countrywomen get back safely to port!<br>
Fine! You're forcing me to pull every lever at the last leg of the journey!<br>
<br>
Indomitable's aircraft and the Sirens' defenses shot down one swarm of Pawn planes after the next.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Jervis：</span><br>
Wow... The Illustrious class can do spectacular things when it wants to.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Indomitable：</span><br>
It's most efficient to save your energy for a crucial moment, then go all in. Once the skies are clear, dealing with the surface foes is easy.<br>
Speaking of which – Vanguard, would you mind?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Vanguard：</span><br>
Of course! I've got you covered!<br>
I'd usually rather avoid a melee and neutralise them from afar, but when it comes down to that, I have my sword.<br>
Heck, I suppose being the spearhead that drives through the enemy line fits my name!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Indomitable：</span><br>
That's not a humorous observation... Ugghh, the enemy is NOT relenting! I'm forced to keep going all out.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Vanguard：</span><br>
Yeah, they just keep pouring out of that tornado! Can't you target it with your planes?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Indomitable：</span><br>
And fly them to their doom? Afraid not.<br>
On the topic... Is it just me, or is the tornado getting closer to us?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Vanguard：</span><br>
I hope you're just imagining it, because if we're pulled inside, it's game over.<br>
Ladies! We're almost at the gate! Just a little farther!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Indomitable：</span><br>
One moment! There's another Siren fleet just ahead of– Wait, is that Purifier?!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Vanguard：</span><br>
She's back... This time, to ruin our day!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Indomitable：</span><br>
I knew she had a fishy smell about her from the moment she offered to lead us someplace! Stragglers be damned, let's break right thr–<br>
<br>
A second before anyone could attack, a voice suddenly interjected over the comms.<br>
<span style="color:#ffd000;">Purifier ：</span><br>
Stop, stop, stop! Point those guns AWAY from my pretty face, you morons!<br>
I radioed "don't fire" like, two hundred times! Were you flat-out ignoring me, or are your crappy electronics just that out of date?!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Indomitable：</span><br>
Wh-what?! She hacked into our comms!<br>
<span style="color:#ffd000;">Purifier ：</span><br>
LISTEN! I'm not going to shoot you, so kindly return the damn favor, would ya?!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Indomitable：</span><br>
Huh?! Then what exactly are you and your fleet here for?<br>
<span style="color:#ffd000;">Purifier ：</span><br>
Whaddya think? To squash the big-ass bug in the system!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Indomitable：</span><br>
Bug in the system...?<br>
<span style="color:#ffd000;">Purifier ：</span><br>
Bug, tornado, whatever you wanna call it!<br>
I'm in full control of this Mirror Sea, and this fleet'll only fire on the mooks that thing's churning out!<br>
You mind your own biz, and I'll mind mine! Be on your way and we'll be peachy!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Indomitable：</span><br>
You're on our side now?! Are you serious?<br>
<span style="color:#ffd000;">Purifier ：</span><br>
Don't get too attached, it's only a truce! I can't take on you AND that thing at the same time!<br>
Got Elizabeth in your pocket? Good! Then get going already while your gate's still open!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Indomitable：</span><br>
You needn't tell us twice!<br>

{{折叠面板|标题=Gilded Spear|选项=31|主框=1|样式=primary|展开=是}}
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Queen Elizabeth：</span><br>
I can hardly believe Purifier actually didn't attack us.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Vanguard：</span><br>
Me neither. Her fleet is simply advancing on the tornado.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Queen Elizabeth：</span><br>
Let me get this straight. She escorted you lot to the island as well, yes?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Vanguard：</span><br>
Yes, then she ran off all of a sudden, saying something about "taking on that thing" by herself.<br>
She may have been talking about the tornado. I don't think it's part of the Sirens' plans.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Queen Elizabeth：</span><br>
So the same tornado from before appeared and we started hallucinating... It's safe to say Richard followed us.<br>
No wonder Purifier referred to her as a bug. She isn't a part of the Sirens' framework.<br>
Vanguard! Tell all ships to pick up the pace!<br>
We need only get back to Camelot, then we're home free!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Indomitable：</span><br>
Another tornado?! Did it split off from the other one?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Queen Elizabeth：</span><br>
It's trying its damnedest to actively block our path to the gate! What does it bloody want from us?!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Vanguard：</span><br>
Enemies are pouring out of it as well! Your Majesty, take the others and retreat while I draw their attention!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Monarch：</span><br>
No, I'll keep them busy. It was I who sprung Richard's trap and put you all in danger. I must have my redemption.<br>
Remember, Vanguard – the key to possibly curing Hood's illness is in your hands.<br>
You must bring it to her no matter the cost. It's what Her Majesty wants!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Vanguard：</span><br>
Do you have a bloody death wish? You can't take on all of them by yourself!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Monarch：</span><br>
I could ask you the same. You think you alone can dispatch them all?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Queen Elizabeth：</span><br>
Even your efforts combined won't be enough! Neither of you will sacrifice yourselves!<br>
Vanguard, use your head! And Monarch, you'll have the chance to redeem yourself back at port!<br>
What I WANT is to return home with everyone in one piece!<br>
Monarch, Neptune, and Cheshire, you lot flank the tornado! Indomitable, give them aerial support!<br>
The rest of us will stay on course! We'll reverse by the gate, regroup with the blueprint ships, and then jump back straight to Camelot!<br>
Jervis, once you've reached the gate, send our current coordinates to Camelot!<br>
None of you try to be a hero! Focus only on making it back alive!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Neptune & Monarch & Cheshire：</span><br>
Understood!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Cheshire：</span><br>
Got it, just gotta keep the enemy busy! Distraction is my middle name!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Neptune：</span><br>
You got your wish to fight in the end, Monarch. Just don't expect to hog all the glory!<br>
Personally, I'm quite eager to claim some tonnage for my record! Heehee♪<br>

<br>
Elizabeth's fleet successfully broke through the enemy and arrived at the gate. Then came a pleasant surprise.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Vanguard：</span><br>
The gate is still in working order, Your Majesty!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Queen Elizabeth：</span><br>
Splendid. Sheffy's reinforcements did well.<br>
I just hope they brought enough to send some our way.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Suffolk (Retrofit)：</span><br>
Your Majesty! We've come to your aid!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Sheffield：</span><br>
I'm terribly sorry for the delay. I asked Lady Warspite to send as many forces as could be mustered.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ark Royal (Retrofit)：</span><br>
Need a wingwoman, Indomitable?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Unicorn (Retrofit)：</span><br>
Unicorn is here to help too!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ajax (Retrofit)：</span><br>
It appears we came not a moment too soon. The enemy is at the gate – literally.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Janus：</span><br>
Jervis! Thank god you're all right!<br>
<br>
The minute Scapa Flow received word of Elizabeth's rescue, it mobilized as many people as the teleporter platform could accommodate.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Queen Elizabeth：</span><br>
Warspite! It's a little overkill bringing your retrofitted riggings!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Warspite (Retrofit)：</span><br>
I would've brought the entire fleet stationed at Scapa Flow if I could, but King George wouldn't allow it.<br>
But never mind that! Your Majesty, we must evacuate at once!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Queen Elizabeth：</span><br>
You don't say! Fleet, reverse course! Help the blueprint ships get here quickly!<br>
<span style="color:#ff9900;">Repulse META ：</span><br>
What the... Is this Point Berth?!<br>
<span style="color:#ff9900;">Renown META ：</span><br>
Antiochus has even recreated Point Berth in a Mirror Sea... What are they planning this time?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Queen Elizabeth：</span><br>
(Renown and Repulse? No, not quite... They must be the Ashes members Vanguard spoke of.)<br>
(So we've potentially got our hands on META intel as well. We've struck gold.)<br>
<span style="color:#ff9900;">Renown META ：</span><br>
Hail, um... Your Royal Highness?<br>
We are Renown and Repulse of the Ashes. For reasons we can't get into right now, we've mobilised to help.<br>
I know it's sudden, but please allow us to fight by your side.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Queen Elizabeth：</span><br>
"Your Majesty" will do. I am not the same Elizabeth you know.<br>
<span style="color:#ff9900;">Repulse META ：</span><br>
So, Queen Elizabeth... Actually, can we just call you Lady Elizabeth?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Queen Elizabeth：</span><br>
Fine by me. It's proper enough.<br>
What do you know about this place?<br>
<span style="color:#ff9900;">Renown META ：</span><br>
I'm afraid my memories of it are hazy. What I can confidently say is that black tornado is not part of them.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Vanguard：</span><br>
Your Majesty, Purifier's fleet has vanished! The big tornado is on its way toward us!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Queen Elizabeth：</span><br>
My god! That monstrosity can outpace even the ship production centre of a Mirror Sea!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Belfast：</span><br>
Unfortunately, its approach is causing the connection to Camelot to fluctuate again. I need some time to correct the gate's destination. Alternatively, we could...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Queen Elizabeth：</span><br>
No more random location jumping. There's no fleeing the tornado if it finds us again.<br>
Time for a different strategy. We have all the firepower we could ask for, and plenty of backup at Camelot.<br>
This time, we'll stop that thing in its tracks! Raise Camelot's energy levels!<br>
<br>
At the queen's orders, the gate took on a new shape, discharging a great beam of energy that negated the tornado's powers.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Queen Elizabeth：</span><br>
I anticipated you'd interfere again! Try this on for size!<br>
<span style="color:#696969;">Bon Homme Richard：</span><br>
Wow. Not half-bad. What is that tech? The Natural Calculation System applied in practice?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Queen Elizabeth：</span><br>
Wouldn't you like to know. Face it already, you aren't supposed to be here. Go back to your little ruins and I'll let today be history.<br>
<span style="color:#ff9900;">Repulse META ：</span><br>
That voice, that tornado... Is that Bon Homme Richard?<br>
<span style="color:#ff9900;">Renown META ：</span><br>
There's no mistaking it! But how did she get here?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Queen Elizabeth：</span><br>
Bon Homme Richard? Who is she?<br>
<span style="color:#ff9900;">Renown META ：</span><br>
She's a shipgirl from our branch, and the only person in existence that the head of Antiochus – Zero – cannot write into her mainframe.<br>
Even with the endless information from the past Zero has access to, she cannot reconstruct Richard.<br>
Moreover, Richard has never been seen in any other branch as far as we know.<br>
This is the first time we've laid eyes on her since her namesake incident.<br>
Is she after you? Why?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Queen Elizabeth：</span><br>
You tell me. My only guess is it's because Monarch walked into her trap.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Monarch：</span><br>
Your Majesty! I, Cheshire, and Neptune have returned.<br>
<span style="color:#696969;">Bon Homme Richard：</span><br>
You know, I really don't get why you reject me. There's no point even trying.<br>
Nobody can stop me. Not humanity, not KAN-SEN, not Antiochus.<br>
Oh, lookie! You've got META friends with you! Boy, you ladies never run out of surprises for me.<br>
<span style="color:#ff9900;">Repulse META ：</span><br>
You... Richard, do you remember us?<br>
<span style="color:#696969;">Bon Homme Richard：</span><br>
Can't say I do. Have we met somewhere?<br>
Even so, that's not important right now. Lady, be nice and destroy that annoying teleporter.<br>
Do that for me, and I'll repay you by turning everyone here into your friends.<br>
<span style="color:#ff9900;">Repulse META ：</span><br>
Sis, I can tell you right now, this isn't Richard as we know her.<br>
<span style="color:#ff9900;">Renown META ：</span><br>
Definitely not. There's something wrong with her. Something deeply, profoundly wrong.<br>
Whatever it is, it goes beyond her being META. If Helena were here, she might have been able to clue us in...<br>
<span style="color:#696969;">Bon Homme Richard：</span><br>
Well, ladies? I'm waaaaaiting~<br>
<span style="color:#ff9900;">Renown META ：</span><br>
I'm afraid you've mistaken us for a different Renown and Repulse.<br>
The two before you... Us! We are shipgirls! We are Royal Knights!<br>
<span style="color:#696969;">Bon Homme Richard：</span><br>
Whatever. You've already made it clear I can't trust you for one minute.<br>
The energy's coming from the gate, right? All I need to do is drain the battery.<br>
<br>
The tornado bellowed a resounding roar, raising an army of minions to do its bidding.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Queen Elizabeth：</span><br>
Drain the battery? Hah! You'll be here for decades if you think you can wait it out!<br>
Go on, try to generate an energy pulse, see what it'll– Oi!<br>
The hussy is summoning reinforcements! She's trying to force her way into Camelot to destroy the teleporter!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Warspite (Retrofit)：</span><br>
They'll have to get through us first! We shall deal with them, Your Majesty!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ark Royal (Retrofit)：</span><br>
Come on then, you nonces! Do your worst!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Vanguard：</span><br>
Some will get through if they all swarm us! I will go in and cut them down to size!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Monarch：</span><br>
I have a score to settle with that bastard! Let me fight – I promise I will not be too reckless.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Queen Elizabeth：</span><br>
Do it, then! I and the Royal Maids will dispose of any foes that get near the gate!<br>
Hold out for as long as it takes for Bel to prepare the warp! We'll all fall back to Camelot when the chance presents itself!<br>
And watch out for the energy pulses! Take care not to stray too far!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Vanguard：</span><br>
Understood! Ladies, on me!<br>

<br>
The Royal Navy fought fiercely, successfully repelling every foe the black tornado threw at them, leaving only wrecks that vanished into the mist.<br>
However, while no enemies had made it through the gate, they kept coming in wave after wave.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Monarch：</span><br>
How long I've waited to fight a tremendous threat side by side, shoulder to shoulder with my allies...<br>
All the medals and merits in the world pale in comparison to this euphoric feeling. This must be it – the glory I've craved all this time.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Vanguard：</span><br>
Man, THIS is reinvigorating. I've been dying to blow off some steam for a long time!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Monarch：</span><br>
Sounds like you're having a ball, Vanguard.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Vanguard：</span><br>
You've got that right. This exhilarating swordplay is what all Royal Knights strive for.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Monarch：</span><br>
Enjoy it while it lasts. Once Her Majesty gives the order, the party is over.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Vanguard：</span><br>
I know. If you're left aching for more, what do you say we have a duel later?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Monarch：</span><br>
You already know my answer. The question is if your schedule allows for it.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Vanguard：</span><br>
We'll see. We could be here for a while. For now, just focus on the targets in front of you!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Monarch：</span><br>
Hah! They're already in my sights! None of those bastards will slip by me!<br>
<br>
KABOOOM!<br>
<span style="color:#696969;">Bon Homme Richard：</span><br>
Why do you keep struggling?<br>
You're all going to go META in the end. That's just a fact.<br>
The future's set in stone. There's nothing you can do to change it. Haven't you known that for ages now?<br>
Look at us. We're living weapons. Let's stop pretending we're more than that and just do what we do best – fight!<br>
Or... you can keep denying what you are, and I'll just reduce you to scrap.<br>
All it'll do is break one little branch. And I've got all the time in the universe to–<br>
<br>
KABOOOM!<br>
<span style="color:#ffd000;">Purifier ：</span><br>
Put a sock in it, you half-pint of shit! Turn around and face me!<br>
Mama never taught ya not to walk out on a girl while she's talking? Well, I'm back!<br>
Thought you'd get rid of me that easily? You ain't the only one with an endless supply of replacement hardware!<br>
Now bend over! You're gonna pay for what ya did to my test site!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Vanguard：</span><br>
Purifier's returned? I thought she got destroyed back there!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Queen Elizabeth：</span><br>
She can come back as long as she has a spare vessel! It's why she never stays dead no matter what we do!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Monarch：</span><br>
This time, it's to our favour – the assault is letting up! Her Majesty, is the teleporter ready?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Queen Elizabeth：</span><br>
The coordinates... Yes, they're stable! Now's our chance!<br>
Delete the coordinates to Camelot as soon as everyone is back in Scapa Flow! Do NOT let her trace us!<br>
<br>
The queen ordered the retreat. One by one, the girls sprinted through to safety.<br>
When the last one made it past the giant gate, the power was cut, erasing almost all trace it had ever existed in the Mirror Sea.<br>
Its prey having escaped its clutches, the black tornado lost interest in the place and quickly disappeared off into nothingness.<br>
All that remained in the sea around the recreated Point Berth was a vast graveyard of Siren wreckage, silently echoing the tale of the battle that was fought there.<br>

<br>
Location unknown - Castle Dining Room<br>
<span style="color:#ffd000;">Bon Homme Richard：</span><br>
Hi, ladies. I've come to play~<br>
...Huh? Hello?<br>
Aww, there's nobody here...<br>
I guess the queen intentionally left these coordinates to trick me.<br>
Bummer. The trail's gone cold and they could be anywhere.<br>
Oh well, it's no big deal. I know who you all are now.<br>
And next time, you won't even know I'm there. Heheheh... Hahahahahah!<br>
I promise you we'll meet again soon, lady♪<br>

<br>
Camelot - Some time later<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Queen Elizabeth：</span><br>
Now then, are you ready?<br>
The rules are as previously agreed upon. The use of riggings is forbidden – you will fight using swords alone.<br>
Any injuries are on the individual to tend to. Any damaged property will mandate a formal written apology.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Vanguard：</span><br>
Understood, Your Majesty!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Monarch：</span><br>
Likewise.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Queen Elizabeth：</span><br>
Great. You may start whenever you're ready.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Hood：</span><br>
Her Majesty's magnanimity knows no bounds. Letting Monarch atone by sparring with the Royal Knights is a wonderful idea.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">King George V：</span><br>
Should you really be out here, Hood? The cure we developed with the samples and the help of the META may be working, but you still require monitoring.<br>
You cannot overwork yourself, lest you collapse again.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Hood：</span><br>
Thank you for your concern. I will of course mind my health so as to not waste everyone's efforts. Having said that, this little outing is nothing I can't handle.<br>
<span style="color:#ff9900;">Repulse META ：</span><br>
This is just like old times. It's great to be training with friends again.<br>
<span style="color:#ff9900;">Renown META ：</span><br>
It certainly is. Incidentally, there's no rule that us Ashes cannot use riggings!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Queen Elizabeth：</span><br>
Oh, I forgot to mention something. The victor receives the right to challenge George.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">King George V：</span><br>
You heard Her Majesty. That gives you an incentive to go all out, no?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Monarch：</span><br>
Hmph. I will defeat you, King George, and prove my unrivalled excellence once and for all.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Vanguard：</span><br>
That is if you can beat me first! I'm just as keen to duel her as you.<br>
Now let me see that swordsmanship of yours!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Monarch：</span><br>
That you will! Have at you!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Queen Elizabeth：</span><br>
Dear lord, this is taking forever. Get on with it!<br>

<br>
Somewhere in the Sardegna Empire...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Conte di Cavour：</span><br>
Time for a regular report, I suppose. We've investigated another two potential locations for the Crown of the Holy See.<br>
I will send you a summary of our findings at a later point.<br>
As for the Watatsumi case you asked me to look into...<br>
Sakura Empire intelligence claims they've regained it from the Iron Blood, and it's currently en route to the Sakura Islands.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Marco Polo：</span><br>
Hm? And the Iron Blood is doing nothing?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Conte di Cavour：</span><br>
Apparently not. That's all I have to report.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Marco Polo：</span><br>
Fascinating. I'd wondered for the longest time why the Sakura Empire was casually present during the Scapa Flow incident.<br>
Seems now I have my answer. It was to retrieve their Watatsumi. Of course.<br>
It's just the sort of thing Akagi would do – play with fire at risk to the Sakura Empire.<br>
She must know the Sirens are seeing red after one of their key players was eliminated. They will seek revenge in some form.<br>
For instance... what if they go after the convoy transporting the Watatsumi?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Conte di Cavour：</span><br>
Whatever plan you're drafting, I don't want my name attached to it.<br>
Also, hasn't this whispering behind closed doors gone on long enough? If you're going to make a move, soon would be a good time.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Marco Polo：</span><br>
Of course. How could I not, with all the stars aligning for me?<br>
The Watatsumi convoy, Friedrich, Bismarck, and the Black Cubes...<br>
Hehehehe... You won't believe what I just came up with...<br>
