Chapter 1 - Treasure in the Old Warehouse<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Fu Shun：</span><br>
Hi! Welcome to...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Chang Chun：</span><br>
The An Shan-class'...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Tai Yuan：</span><br>
C-coloring room!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">An Shan：</span><br>
What are we even doing...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Fu Shun：</span><br>
Well, let's say we'll "paint you a picture."<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Chang Chun：</span><br>
Tai Yuan found this while digging around in the warehouse.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Tai Yuan：</span><br>
H-heheheh...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">An Shan：</span><br>
What warehouse...?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Fu Shun：</span><br>
Umm, n-never mind that! Just take a look at this drawing book!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Chang Chun：</span><br>
It's not really a drawing book, it's more like a half-finished coloring book...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Fu Shun：</span><br>
Ta-dah! Anyway, we should fill it in together!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">An Shan：</span><br>
You're up to something again, Fu Shun...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Tai Yuan：</span><br>
I-I want to fill it in too...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">An Shan：</span><br>
Oh well, I guess it's better than you guys causing trouble outdoors...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Chang Chun：</span><br>
I'm up for some coloring, but we don't have any paint...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Fu Shun：</span><br>
Alright, then we'll go find some!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">An Shan：</span><br>
Just don't go causing trouble for people!<br>

Chapter 2 - One of the Base's 7 Wonders<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">An Shan：</span><br>
Let's fill this in here...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Tai Yuan：</span><br>
Then this color here...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Fu Shun：</span><br>
And then we use this color here!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Chang Chun：</span><br>
Ahh! Fu Shun, you used the wrong color again!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Fu Shun：</span><br>
Whatever, it's good enough~ No big deal, right?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">An Shan：</span><br>
I can't even tell what this is supposed to be anymore...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Prototype Bulin MKII：</span><br>
Buli! Dadadadadadah! I'm running in circles~ Just another normal day at the base!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Universal Bulin：</span><br>
Buli! You look hyped, buli! But I'm gonna be even more hyped, buli!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Chang Chun：</span><br>
W-who are they...?!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Fu Shun：</span><br>
Aren't they one of those "Seven Wonders of The Base," the Bulins?!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Tai Yuan：</span><br>
It's rumored that seeing a Bulin brings you luck for the rest of the day!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">An Shan：</span><br>
Where did that urban legend come from...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Chang Chun：</span><br>
I think we're out of paint again...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Fu Shun：</span><br>
Okay! I'll go look for some more!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">An Shan：</span><br>
I bet you just want to chase after the Bulins...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Fu Shun：</span><br>
Nuh-uh, no way! I just happen to feel like running around a bit! I'll go find the Buli... I mean, some paint!<br>

Chapter 3 - Time For a (Lunch) Break<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Fu Shun：</span><br>
I'm back, guys! I couldn't get a hold of the Bulins... but I brought some other people with me!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Tai Yuan：</span><br>
Oh! Why, if it isn't Ning Hai and Ping Hai!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ning Hai：</span><br>
Fu Shun said you guys are up to something fun.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ping Hai：</span><br>
I want to have some fun too~<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">An Shan：</span><br>
Fu Shun! Didn't I tell you not to cause trouble for people?!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ning Hai：</span><br>
Ahahahah... You're as dead-serious as usual, An Shan.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ping Hai：</span><br>
I brought some meat buns Yat Sen made. Wanna eat some with us?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Tai Yuan & Chang Chun & An Shan：</span><br>
Of course!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Tai Yuan：</span><br>
Yat Sen's meat buns are the best...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Chang Chun：</span><br>
Mmm~ Sho goooowd~<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">An Shan：</span><br>
Yat Sen never disappoints with her amazing cooking... Mmm, it's delicious~!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ping Hai：</span><br>
Heheheh, thanks~<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ning Hai：</span><br>
She wasn't complimenting YOU, Ping.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">An Shan：</span><br>
Hey... I feel like we're forgetting something...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ping Hai：</span><br>
Fu Shun said you guys are up to something fun, is that what...?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">An Shan：</span><br>
Oh, right! We were filling in this coloring book!<br>

Chapter 4 - Drawing Together<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">An Shan：</span><br>
With all of us together like this... I think we're causing a lot of noise.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Fu Shun：</span><br>
It's fine, no big deal! They say the more, the merrier, right?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ping Hai：</span><br>
I'll color this part~<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ning Hai：</span><br>
Ping and Fu Shun play together like they're on the same wavelength...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">An Shan：</span><br>
Ning... Let me say I'm sorry for Fu Shun causing you so much trouble...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Fu Shun：</span><br>
An Shan, if you worry so much all the time, you'll develop wrinkles on your face.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">An Shan：</span><br>
Sigh... And who do you think is making me worry so much in the first place...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ning Hai：</span><br>
Ahahah, you must have it really tough, An Shan.<br>
But still, we should let everyone enjoy themselves and not fuss over the details, okay?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">An Shan：</span><br>
Ahahaha... You're totally right, Ning.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ning Hai：</span><br>
Alright, I'll join in! Let me handle this part!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">An Shan：</span><br>
O-okay... I'll join in, too!<br>

Chapter 5 - An Shan's Drawing Book<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">An Shan：</span><br>
Let's see... Let's color this part with...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Fu Shun & Chang Chun & Tai Yuan：</span><br>
The last drawing is finished!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ning Hai & Ping Hai：</span><br>
Hooray!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">An Shan：</span><br>
It took some time... but it's finally done!<br>
And we couldn't have done it without everyone's help! Ahh...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Chang Chun：</span><br>
...I think An Shan got more into it than anyone else in the end...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Fu Shun：</span><br>
Ahahahah! That's what I like so much about her!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Tai Yuan：</span><br>
She's... cute... when she does that...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">An Shan：</span><br>
A-ahem! I was only wrapping things up, like a big sister should!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ning Hai：</span><br>
Ahahah. It's always such fun to hang out with you all.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ping Hai：</span><br>
Yeah. Playing together with you was a lot of fun...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Yat Sen：</span><br>
Ah, so this is where you've all been.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ning Hai：</span><br>
Yat Sen?! Why are you here?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">An Shan：</span><br>
Oh, hello, Yat Sen!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Fu Shun：</span><br>
Look at this drawing book! We just finished with it!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Chang Chun：</span><br>
All we really did was color it, though...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Yat Sen：</span><br>
Ah, did you? May I have a look? ...My, what wonderful drawings.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Tai Yuan：</span><br>
Eheheh...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Yat Sen：</span><br>
Hm, what's this? There's an empty page on the back...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">An Shan：</span><br>
Huh?!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Yat Sen：</span><br>
It's completely blank... But since this is a drawing book, I suppose that's how it is supposed to look like...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Fu Shun：</span><br>
So basically... we can draw whatever we want on it?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Chang Chun：</span><br>
In that case, we should give it to An Shan!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">An Shan：</span><br>
What? T-to me?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Tai Yuan：</span><br>
We know you have it in you to draw a wonderful picture.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">An Shan：</span><br>
Well, if you think I can, then...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Fu Shun：</span><br>
Heh, you look really happy, An Shan!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Yat Sen：</span><br>
Well, there's no need to rush it. First, why don't we enjoy some food I brought with me?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Everyone：</span><br>
Heck yeah!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">An Shan：</span><br>
Okay, then after that, I'll take my time and draw something... Hehehe...<br>
