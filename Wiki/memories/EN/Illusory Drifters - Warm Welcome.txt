Port - Training Grounds<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Akashi：</span><br>
Heeey! I'm beggin' ya, nya!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">BLACK★ROCK SHOOTER：</span><br>
...<br>
<br>
On one sunny afternoon, in a plaza on the outer edge of the port, Akashi could be seen pestering a certain guest from another world.<br>
Quite persistently, at that.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Akashi：</span><br>
J-just for a little bit, nya! I just want a little peek is all, nya!<br>
I swear I won't ask you to let me disassemble it and inspect every part, nya, I mean it!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Amazon：</span><br>
What's going on here?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Shiranui：</span><br>
Akashi's back to her old tricks. Apparently she's fascinated with our guest's weapon, or something...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Amazon：</span><br>
Oh... No wonder. I'm not surprised that cat's champing at the bit to see it.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Shiranui：</span><br>
She was quite a force to be reckoned with in the recent operation, I hear... Maybe that's part of why Akashi's so curious about how her weapon is made...?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Amazon：</span><br>
If it's that incredible, then I wanna get a look at it, too!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Akashi：</span><br>
Just a peek, nya! I'll make do with one very long, loving stare, nya!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">BLACK★ROCK SHOOTER：</span><br>
...I refuse.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Amazon：</span><br>
Whoa! She rejected her just like that!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Shiranui：</span><br>
She acts like she's talking to pure garbage. Heeheehee...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Akashi：</span><br>
D-d-don't be hasty, nya. Give it some thought, nya!<br>
I know! In return, I'll show you my special collection, nya! How's that sound for a trade?<br>
They're all super valuable, so you should be crying from joy, nya!<br>
First, look at this special pistol used by the Eagle Union's police force, nya! Behold the length of its barrel, nya!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">BLACK★ROCK SHOOTER：</span><br>
...I'm not interested in antiques. That toy couldn't even damage your rigging.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Akashi：</span><br>
Nnngh... Then what about this computer released ten years ago, nya?! It cost a pretty penny, nya!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">BLACK★ROCK SHOOTER：</span><br>
...Sounds useless.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Akashi：</span><br>
Hnnnngh! Then what about THIS, nya?! An 88mm anti-aircraft gun – a classic, super popular in all sorts of films, nya! And it's still in perfect working order, nya!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Amazon：</span><br>
She brought that giant thing into the port? She's in for it the moment the Commander finds out.<br>
<br>
Even faced with the huge anti-aircraft gun, BLACK★ROCK SHOOTER was unmoved.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Akashi：</span><br>
Whaddya say, nya? Think long and hard about it, nya!<br>
If I get to study that weapon, I'll learn new tech from it, nya! And then I can make everyone in the port stronger, nya!<br>
It'd be the kindest thing you can do, the most helpful thing of all, nya... Don't you see, nya?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Shiranui：</span><br>
There's something you should know. Her method for "making everyone stronger" is all about developing and selling new gear.<br>
In other words, this is just a get-rich-quick scheme.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">BLACK★ROCK SHOOTER：</span><br>
...Really?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Akashi：</span><br>
Stay outta this, nyaaa!<br>
<br>
Akashi's pained screams echoed through the port as she ran away, utterly defeated.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Akashi：</span><br>
Don't think you'll get rid of me that easily, nya...<br>
I'm gonna get my paws on that weapon...<br>
Special drone unit, deploy, nyaaa!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">BLACK★ROCK SHOOTER：</span><br>
Hm? I sense something... in the sky?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Perseus ：</span><br>
Yuubari, didn't I tell you to cut it out with the RC drones?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Yuubari：</span><br>
Don't look at me. It could be Fargo's drones?<br>
<br>
Even stealth drones are sure to be discovered by the keen senses of the many shipgirls within the port.<br>
However, while everyone is distracted by the drones...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Akashi：</span><br>
Heheheheh... The drones are just bait, nya! My surprise aerial assault is the real danger, nya!<br>
Now show me that weapon, nya!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">BLACK★ROCK SHOOTER：</span><br>
...Watch out.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Akashi：</span><br>
Bwuh...<br>
<br>
After her assault is easily evaded, Akashi's momentum sends her crashing straight into the ground.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">BLACK★ROCK SHOOTER：</span><br>
...Are you okay?<br>
<br>
Some time later...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Neptune：</span><br>
Wait, that wasn't a bunker buster? Akashi was the one that fell out of the sky?<br>
Good grief. She's always such a handful... What was she after, anyway?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">BLACK★ROCK SHOOTER：</span><br>
I don't know.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Neptune：</span><br>
Well, I'm sure it was for the sake of her business, somehow... But if she's so insistent on it, are you sure you can't let her have her way?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">BLACK★ROCK SHOOTER：</span><br>
...I don't care, but her desperation makes me worry about how far she'll go.<br>
If she's just trying to find out about it... then that's fine.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Neptune：</span><br>
Then would you be willing to let her see your weapon under the Commander's supervision? Just for a little while is enough.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">BLACK★ROCK SHOOTER：</span><br>
...Okay.<br>

<br>
Port - Royal Garden<br>
Under a clear blue sky, the port is holding a special tea party to welcome their new guests from another world.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Belfast：</span><br>
Thank you all for attending today's royal tea party.<br>
We, the Royal Maids, will provide you with the utmost hospitality befitting the port's fine reputation.<br>
<br>
A matching tea set with exquisite design is neatly arranged on the table, all waiting for the tea party to begin.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">DEAD MASTER：</span><br>
Excuse me, Miss Maid? Don't you worry that being so formal might make your guests feel uneasy?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Belfast：</span><br>
Umm...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Kent：</span><br>
How about this one? "Welcome to our humble tea party, everyone! Eat up, drink up, and have a grand time!"<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Edinburgh：</span><br>
Ahem. Kent, do not embarrass us in front of the guests, please.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">DEAD MASTER：</span><br>
Heehee, it's okay. I happen to prefer the casual greeting.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Kent：</span><br>
See? Our guest likes it. Isn't that what matters?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Belfast：</span><br>
*sigh*... As you wish, milady.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Cleopatra：</span><br>
We've prepared the finest black tea made from carefully selected second flush leaves. I hope it suits your palate.<br>
If you'd prefer a different type of tea, or have a specific water temperature in mind, please just let me know! I'll happily take your requests.<br>
Naturally, we have snacks and desserts as well. Do you like sweet foods, milady?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">DEAD MASTER：</span><br>
I don't go out of my way to eat sweets, but I don't mind them.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Belfast：</span><br>
Suffolk kindly made today's snacks for us. We hope that you enjoy them.<br>
<br>
Cakes, scones, sandwiches, and other such treats from the tiered serving stand are brought over and laid on the table.<br>
Suffolk personally divides them and serves them to each guest one by one.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">DEAD MASTER：</span><br>
Thanks. Mmm... Very refreshing, and the presentation is exquisite. I may not eat sweets often, but I really love these.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Suffolk：</span><br>
Oh? I'm happy you do!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">DEAD MASTER：</span><br>
Phew... I don't usually get the opportunity to relax like this, but it's actually not bad at all. Moreover...<br>
The tension of battle fills this place, yet somehow it still manages to calm the nerves... It's perfect.<br>
Is that why I feel such a sense of... tolerance? That even I can be accepted here?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Belfast：</span><br>
That may be because everyone here is born for battle, just like you.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">DEAD MASTER：</span><br>
Heehee, maybe. We're all birds of a feather, aren't we?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">King George V：</span><br>
Enough talk of violence. This is hardly an appropriate topic among elegant young ladies at a tea party.<br>
<br>
Other Royal Navy shipgirls nearby cut into the conversation.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Vanguard：</span><br>
Mind if I join in?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">DEAD MASTER：</span><br>
Be my guest. I've looked forward to chatting with Royal Knights.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Monarch：</span><br>
Don't get your hopes up too much...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">King George V：</span><br>
Don't be so cold, Monarch. Somehow, you and DEAD MASTER seem like kindred spirits to me.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">DEAD MASTER：</span><br>
Hmm... Should I be honored, I wonder?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Monarch：</span><br>
.........<br>
<br>
Monarch's expression is as cold as usual, but she still sits at DEAD MASTER's table along with the others.<br>
Her tea set is already prepared, and as soon as she takes her seat, the maids pour her favorite tea.<br>
While the girls enjoy their tea in the cool sea breeze, smoke rises in the distance – the result of BLACK★ROCK SHOOTER's training.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Sheffield：</span><br>
Miss BLACK★ROCK SHOOTER never goes a day without training, does she?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Glasgow：</span><br>
What a hard worker.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">DEAD MASTER：</span><br>
Mmm... I don't know about that. It's more like that's all she has.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Monarch：</span><br>
You're not going to join in? I thought you liked that stuff.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">DEAD MASTER：</span><br>
...Do I look like I do? I'm far from as barbaric as her.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Monarch：</span><br>
Really?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Vanguard：</span><br>
Yikes, I'm sorry. Monarch can be a little too direct...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">DEAD MASTER：</span><br>
Is that so?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Monarch：</span><br>
Hmph. I just don't like beating around the bush.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">DEAD MASTER：</span><br>
Oh, really? Then how about you and I spar a little?<br>
I've been interested in how the Royal Knights fight.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Vanguard：</span><br>
Why did the conversation suddenly shift in that direction?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Monarch：</span><br>
After the tea party. Now isn't the time to talk about violence.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">DEAD MASTER：</span><br>
Quiet tea parties, a peaceful life... I agree. Now isn't the time or place.<br>
Miss Maid, may I have another cup?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Kent：</span><br>
Sure~ I'll bring it right away!<br>
<br>
Thus, the tea party carries on, though perhaps more precariously than before.<br>
