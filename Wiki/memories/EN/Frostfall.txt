<br>
On the ice of the snow-covered northern sea, a mass-produced supply fleet led by an icebreaker pushed forth as a line.<br>
Though the war in the Polar North raged on, such a large-scale fleet was a truly rare sight.<br>
The communicator buzzed with static, heralding a certain woman's voice—she who would give the final orders before battle.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Sovetsky Soyuz：</span><br>
This is Sovetsky Soyuz, to all ships participating in this operation.<br>
The purpose of this operation is to expand our sphere of influence in the Polar North, taking advantage of Compiler's destruction and Omitter's loss of foreign support.<br>
Furthermore, we are to thwart the Sirens' growth and establish a bridgehead to retake the Arctic.<br>
As for concrete objectives, we mean to assault Omitter's defensive stronghold within this region.<br>
We will remove the electromagnetic jamming and meteorological anomalies present here.<br>
Afterward, we will destroy the mass-production facilities and weapons development facilities as we proceed to the research station.<br>
Upon our arrival, we will infiltrate the fortress at the Polar North, where we expect to find Omitter's mainframe.<br>
For us to achieve these objectives, it is of vital importance that every single vessel here does her very best to fight and cooperate with her sisters.<br>
Before we begin this operation, I will announce the plans for each combat unit.<br>
First unit, code-name Lancet. You will begin your charge from the archipelago to the west.<br>
Kuybyshev, as flagship, your job is to seize the fortress closest to the Union in order to remove the electromagnetic jamming in this area.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Kuybyshev：</span><br>
Da-s. The Lancet unit stands ready.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Sovetsky Soyuz：</span><br>
Second unit, Fist. Begin your assault from the archipelago to the north.<br>
You will perform a reconnaissance operation on the Siren stronghold at the Polar North, where you will scout out their forces and confirm their deployment status.<br>
The flagship of this unit will be Sovetskaya Rossiya, should you accept this task.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Sovetskaya Rossiya：</span><br>
Understood. The Fist unit will see it done!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Sovetsky Soyuz：</span><br>
Third unit, Lightning. You will join the operation from the continent to the south.<br>
Retake the research station to the north and suppress the Siren forces in your vicinity.<br>
Tallinn, you will lead this unit.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Tallinn：</span><br>
The Lightning unit will do all in our power to see your orders satisfied.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Sovetsky Soyuz：</span><br>
Fourth unit, Weasel. Advance through the eastern path.<br>
Your objective is to conquer Omitter's stronghold, where we believe the core device causing the anomalous weather is contained.<br>
Kirov. I entrust you with the leadership of this unit.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Kirov：</span><br>
Right. Leave it to us Weasels.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Sovetsky Soyuz：</span><br>
Fifth unit, Hammer. Travel northward along the polar route to the designated destination.<br>
While the other units still fight, you will launch an attack on the Crown in order to contain Siren forces there.<br>
And, if possible... Try to draw Omitter's attention.<br>
Sovetskaya Belorussiya, you will command them.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Sovetskaya Belorussiya：</span><br>
You can rest easy with the Hammer unit in my hands.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Sovetsky Soyuz：</span><br>
This operation must succeed, for the sake of achieving the Northern Parliament's great goals and for the sake of a better future.<br>
For those who could not join in this battle, allow me to offer my sincerest gratitude to every ship who has gathered here today.<br>
Operation Frostfall will begin at 0100 hours.<br>
Move to your positions swiftly and stand by for battle.<br>
That is all, comrades. Good luck.<br>

<br>
Far from the Frostfall operational area...<br>
The pre-battle operation briefing ended, but another monitor lit up before Soyuz's eyes.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Avrora：</span><br>
We've been building up our strength for so long. Now, it's finally time...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Sovetsky Soyuz：</span><br>
Yes.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Avrora：</span><br>
Have you decided not to involve the Commander after all?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Sovetsky Soyuz：</span><br>
This is an extremely difficult operation. We can't begin to fathom what Omitter might do when cornered.<br>
We alone must bear the risks involved in this operation.<br>
Besides, the Commander has been busy conducting research with the Eagle Union for some time now. Why not give our good Commander a moment to unwind at the World Expo?<br>
By the way, how is the situation over there?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Avrora：</span><br>
All is well. The venue is the very picture of peace. Honestly, I almost find myself bored by how little has happened.<br>
Though, news that the Commander would come has caused more than a little bit of commotion~<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Sovetsky Soyuz：</span><br>
Hahaha! I can imagine.<br>
And what of the Dragon Empery? I'd heard that they planned to leave, but I imagine the news must have changed their plans.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Avrora：</span><br>
Well... Actually, they already left before the news broke.<br>
It's too late to turn back the clock, though it really is a shame.<br>
But for now, Soyuz, please focus on the impending battle.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Sovetsky Soyuz：</span><br>
Right. I suppose that's enough small talk.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Avrora：</span><br>
I'll be praying for your victory from here in Sardegna, Comrade Soyuz.<br>
<br>
The screen flickered and turned off, bringing silence to the room once more.<br>
After a moment of quiet thought, Soyuz checked the time and connected to the mission command network.<br>
Outside the building, the polar snowstorm raged yet harder.<br>

<br>
Lancet Unit<br>
Flagship: Kuybyshev<br>
Objective: Destroy the electromagnetic jamming device<br>
Under the light of dawn, a fleet sailed slowly through the gaps between ice floes.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Gremyashchy：</span><br>
So sleepy... Urgh, I messed up...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Kuybyshev：</span><br>
Did you stay up all night again? Here... Warm yourself up with a cup of hot chocolate.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Gremyashchy：</span><br>
Mm. I'll take you up on that.<br>
I meant to just skim through those files, but before I knew it, it was morning...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Kuybyshev：</span><br>
Some for you, too, Tashkent.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Tashkent：</span><br>
Oh, thanks. *gulp, gulp*...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Kuybyshev：</span><br>
Do you feel nice and warm now?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Gremyashchy：</span><br>
Mm, that's right. Nice and warm... Thanks.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Tashkent：</span><br>
I'm in peak condition now!<br>
Oops. I almost forgot to spot-check the mass-produced fleet!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Kuybyshev：</span><br>
Don't worry about it. I just checked them, and everything looks normal.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Gremyashchy：</span><br>
Not a single problem, in this harsh environment?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Tashkent：</span><br>
Heh! The mass-produced models were specially improved just for this operation.<br>
On top of being able to resist Siren interference, they also come with tons of "special mods."<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Gremyashchy：</span><br>
Was that in those files, too? I didn't get to finish them last night...<br>
Did you already read through them all, Tashkent?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Tashkent：</span><br>
Nope. I was just flipping through, and that happened to catch my eye.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Gremyashchy：</span><br>
It just happened to, huh? You know, I saw you trying to hide a yawn a minute ago.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Tashkent：</span><br>
Liar! I am ALWAYS in peak condition, got it?!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Gremyashchy：</span><br>
Hmm... Okay. Mm, then that's all.<br>
But what makes those "special mods" so special?<br>
They didn't look too different to me...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Tashkent：</span><br>
I dunno. Maybe they added some weird parts.<br>
If that so-called mechanical mastermind Soobrazitelny was here, she'd tell you all about it.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Gremyashchy：</span><br>
Mechanical mastermind...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Tashkent：</span><br>
Not convinced, Gremyashchy?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Gremyashchy：</span><br>
That's not it. It's just that, when it comes to the Sirens, our stuff always breaks at a pivotal moment. So forgive me if I don't expect much.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Tashkent：</span><br>
...Can't argue with that.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Kuybyshev：</span><br>
When that time comes, focus on keeping yourself safe. Don't you dare do anything stupid.<br>
I'll find a way to see the mission through.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Tashkent：</span><br>
That just means you're gonna try to carry the mission on your shoulders and get hurt in the process, right?<br>
I don't want that.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Kuybyshev：</span><br>
............<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Gremyashchy：</span><br>
All we can do is pray that things work out. Mm, that's all.<br>
<br>
There was a moment of silence. The gap in the ice floes widened, gradually improving visibility.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Kuybyshev：</span><br>
That's it... The Eagle Union supply fleet.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Tashkent：</span><br>
Right on time. I was worried they wouldn't come...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Kuybyshev：</span><br>
The Eagle Union always makes good on their promises.<br>
But it doesn't look like they brought the firepower to support us in battle. This one's up to the Northern Parliament.<br>
We shouldn't dawdle here. Once we've resupplied, let's hurry to our objective, okay?<br>

<br>
Lancet Unit<br>
Flagship: Kuybyshev<br>
Objective: Destroy the electromagnetic jamming device<br>
The Lancet unit sailed forth, circling around the sea region currently under Siren control.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Tashkent：</span><br>
Strange... We haven't run into any real enemy forces yet.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Kuybyshev：</span><br>
That may be because the other units have drawn their attention.<br>
Even the Sirens don't have inexhaustible forces. The Commander's fighting has proven that much.<br>
There is some danger involved in dividing our units as we have, but it's perfect for finding Omitter's weaknesses.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Gremyashchy：</span><br>
The aurora got brighter...<br>
According to the files, the brighter the aurora is, the stronger the Sirens' jamming is.<br>
Are the mass-produced ships okay?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Tashkent：</span><br>
For now, they're fine. They really put a lot of effort into those upgrades.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Kuybyshev：</span><br>
We should get them into position. The Siren fortress is up ahead, so let's prepare for battle before we arrive.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Tashkent：</span><br>
Gotcha. I'll mobilize the mass-produced ships into firing position.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Kuybyshev：</span><br>
Good! Let's join the battle!<br>
<br>
Kuybyshev's acceleration froze the water below her, blowing about crystals of ice that melted into a drizzle when subjected to the heat of her engine, before finally being blown away by cannonfire.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Tashkent：</span><br>
Mass-produced fleet, begin firing!<br>
<br>
BOOOOOOOOOOOM!<br>
Their concentrated bombardment flew toward the target zone like black hailstones raining down upon the Sirens' heads.<br>
As if awakened all at once, the fortress spewed countless mass-produced Sirens who moved to attack Kuybyshev's Lancet unit.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Tashkent：</span><br>
Is that so? If it's a fight you want... then behold our power!<br>
Ura!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Gremyashchy：</span><br>
Something's coming out!<br>
<span style="color:#ec5d53;">Omitter α：</span><br>
............<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Tashkent：</span><br>
Is that Omitter...? I thought she was supposed to be in the Crown!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Kuybyshev：</span><br>
She seems different. Like Compiler, this must be one of her vessels.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Gremyashchy：</span><br>
10... 11... 12...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Tashkent：</span><br>
Gremyashchy?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Gremyashchy：</span><br>
...It's been fifteen seconds, and she still hasn't hacked into our comms.<br>
That's definitely one of Omitter's vessels. Yep, that's all.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Kuybyshev：</span><br>
Hmm, that is an interesting method of telling them apart. I'll remember that.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Tashkent：</span><br>
A vessel, huh? Boring... Watch me tear it apart!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Gremyashchy：</span><br>
Destroying her vessel won't do anything; it can just come back as long as Omitter is alive. We gotta focus on destroying the electromagnetic jamming device here.<br>
I'll have the mass-produced ships buy us time. Let's hurry on.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Tashkent：</span><br>
Mass-produced ships can't win against a vessel. If we don't beat Omitter now, she might catch up and attack us from behind.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Kuybyshev：</span><br>
Then allow me to draw her attention. Tashkent and Gremyashchy, you destroy the jamming device.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Tashkent&Gremyashchy：</span><br>
No!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Gremyashchy：</span><br>
Before the battle, Soyuz told us to work together!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Tashkent：</span><br>
Yeah. We won't let you fight alone.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Kuybyshev：</span><br>
...Then we have no choice. Let's defeat Omitter's vessel, and then we'll search for the device.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Gremyashchy：</span><br>
That's how our Pathfinder should be. Yep, that's all!<br>
<br>
Throughout their battle with Omitter's vessel and the Siren fleet, the unit gradually approached the fortress facility.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Tashkent：</span><br>
Let's destroy it and Omitter in one fell swoop! Ura!<br>
<br>
The walls of the fortress and surrounding icebergs were already full of holes from the Northern Parliament's ferocious assault.<br>
Tashkent and the mass-produced ships trained their sights on Omitter. They fired, ready to deal the final blow.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Gremyashchy：</span><br>
Kuybyshev, Omitter has entered the firing point! Hurry and get out of the way!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Kuybyshev：</span><br>
Understood!<br>
<br>
Skillfully handling her enormous rigging, Kuybyshev whipped around and got away from Omitter.<br>
The moment she turned her back to the enemy, countless shells closed in on Omitter and landed all at once, engulfing the area in smoke.<br>
When the smoke finally cleared, Omitter was gone.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Tashkent：</span><br>
Destroyed her without so much as a trace. Heheh, this is what happens when you try to stop the Northern Parliament's fleet!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Gremyashchy：</span><br>
The jamming has weakened, too... Yep. That's all!<br>
Could it be that the tower destroyed alongside Omitter contained the jamming device?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Tashkent：</span><br>
Really? We're pretty lucky!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Kuybyshev：</span><br>
Heehee. Sometimes, luck can turn the tides of battle.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Gremyashchy：</span><br>
With their command unit defeated, the Sirens are scattering. Does that mean we completed our mission?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Kuybyshev：</span><br>
That's right. Now, I'll contact reinforcements, call the occupying force, and have the facility seized.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Communicator：</span><br>
*drip*...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Kuybyshev：</span><br>
This is the first unit, Lancet. We've successfully conquered the Sirens' fortress. Once we've met with the occupying force, we will move to the next phase of the operation.<br>
<br>
These radio waves would surely overcome the fierce polar winds and bring welcome news to their comrades.<br>
However, the operation in the polar region had only just begun.<br>

Fist Unit<br>
Flagship: Sovetskaya Rossiya<br>
Objective: Scout the Polar North Stronghold<br>
Shells fired by mass-produced Siren ships struck the ice ahead, sending forth a shower of shattered ice that obstructed the unit's view.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Volga：</span><br>
Ah! Another Siren patrol... Should we avoid this one, too?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Sovetskaya Rossiya：</span><br>
Affirmative. Our course of action remains as it was: until we arrive at the enemy stronghold in the Polar North, we avoid every confrontation we possibly can.<br>
<br>
Supply Point - Polar North Outpost<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Volga：</span><br>
It's not following us. Does that mean those don't leave their patrol area, or something?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Sovetskaya Rossiya：</span><br>
It must be a patrolling force from the Crown.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Chapayev：</span><br>
Or maybe from the research base? Our route takes us through a zone controlled by both of them.<br>
Can you tell which one it is, Volga?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Volga：</span><br>
Given its direction of travel, perhaps it is from the research base...<br>
B-but Kronshtadt and I only went there once. I hope the unit tasked with the research base is doing okay...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Minsk：</span><br>
Do you think it didn't chase us because they're already fighting out there?<br>
I just didn't think we'd encounter Sirens that close to the supply point...<br>
Can the supply fleet survive in these conditions?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Sovetskaya Rossiya：</span><br>
That doesn't merit concern at this moment, Minsk.<br>
Due to the difficulty of supplying our unit's efforts, autonomous submarines will provide us with supplies.<br>
They're deep under the surface right now and will only show themselves when I've sent an encrypted signal at the designated point.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Minsk：</span><br>
S-special submarines are supplying us this time?! This is way too luxurious a use for them!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Sovetskaya Rossiya：</span><br>
That should inform you of how vital and difficult the coming operation will be.<br>
The Polar North stronghold is under Omitter's strict security. Worse, we have little intelligence on it.<br>
On top of the Siren mainframe, it is probable that other secrets are hidden there. That is why we need to perform careful reconnaissance before the assault proper.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Chapayev：</span><br>
Compared to that, passing through overlapping Siren defenses and coming home safe sound like easy pickings.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Sovetskaya Rossiya：</span><br>
Soyuz entrusted this side of the operation to us because she recognizes our abilities.<br>
...However, nothing would be gained by our charging in alone. Our mission objective would be impossible without the cooperation of our fellow units.<br>
What is the status of the mass-produced ships' damages and ammunition reserves?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Minsk：</span><br>
We've lost about thirty percent of our mass-produced fleet. But we have plenty of ammunition left over!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Sovetskaya Rossiya：</span><br>
...The damages are greater than I expected.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Minsk：</span><br>
When you advance this far into Siren territory, their jamming can make normal mass-produced ships into little more than a liability. And our special models are limited in number...<br>
I just hope Kuybyshev's unit completes their objective soon...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Sovetskaya Rossiya：</span><br>
That would be ideal, but in war, things rarely go according to plan.<br>
We should press on while the other units distract Siren defenses.<br>
If we delay too much, the enemy will regroup and surround us.<br>
This is our only chance. We mustn't let it go to waste.<br>
We must be prepared for the worst case: that we must complete the mission even in an environment with full electromagnetic interference.<br>
To that end, it's necessary that we minimize losses and preserve our forces for when we need them.<br>
Hmm... We're almost at the supply point. I'll send the order for the submarines to surface.<br>
All ships, be alert and resupply as quickly as possible!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">All：</span><br>

<br>
Fist Unit<br>
Flagship: Sovetskaya Rossiya<br>
Objective: Scout the Polar North Stronghold<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Minsk：</span><br>
The weather is getting really bad...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Chapayev：</span><br>
It only gets worse as we approach the Polar North.<br>
This shouldn't be a Mirror Sea, but that meteorological anomaly weapon is just as troublesome. How does it even work...?<br>
<span style="color:#ec5d53;">Omitter μ：</span><br>
………………<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Volga：</span><br>
S-someone that looks like Omitter has been spotted to the northeast!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Minsk：</span><br>
Did she use the snow and jamming to hide her approach?!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Sovetskaya Rossiya：</span><br>
We're almost at the Polar North stronghold. There's no point in forcing ourselves to remain unseen anymore.<br>
Concentrate your firepower and smash her to bits!<br>
<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Minsk：</span><br>
Confirmed the destruction of high-ranking Siren, Omitter! Ura!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Chapayev：</span><br>
She didn't fight like a high-ranking Siren. Was that one of those vessels I've heard about?<br>
And the mass-produced Sirens here are a type I've never seen before. Rossiya, do you know them?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Sovetskaya Rossiya：</span><br>
No... But I do know that these are much stronger than any other mass-produced ships we've fought.<br>
Despite our defeating the elite humanoid enemy, their fleet has yet to fall into chaos. That must mean that the Command unit—<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Volga：</span><br>
Another Omitter came out! This one doesn't seem like the real one, either!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Chapayev：</span><br>
Rossiya, our mass-produced ships have taken more losses than planned. Should we regroup first?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Sovetskaya Rossiya：</span><br>
Not yet. We need to get a little closer to the stronghold! Ideally, we'd even draw the real Omitter to this battlefield!<br>
If we're going to retreat, then it should wait until we have a better idea of their mass-produced ships' features! Hold on a little longer!<br>
<br>
<br>
While distancing themselves from the enemy, the Fist unit attacked Omitter's vessel and gathered information on the hostile mass-produced ships.<br>
Suddenly, there was a strong gust of wind that seemed to darken the sky all at once.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Volga：</span><br>
Is it just me, or is it darker now?<br>
<br>
There was a biting chill as the blizzard intensified. In its midst appeared a figure darker than the sky itself.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Volga：</span><br>
A Sakura Empire carrier...?<br>
<br>
For just an instant, Volga felt as though she'd been spirited away.<br>
Her senses left the battlefield, returning to the Suliko that slept in the depths of the Arctic.<br>
Shards of meteorite, the sample analysis device shining with an odd glow...<br>
When her senses returned to the present, both the figure and the device had disappeared.<br>
The communicator set up for this mission only buzzed, its signal blocked out by the interference of the raging blizzard.<br>
Volga stumbled. Just as she was about to fall, somebody caught her and helped her back up.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Minsk：</span><br>
Volga, are you okay?!<br>
Did a Siren attack hit you?!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Volga：</span><br>
I-I'm fine! I was just a little distracted... Did you see that person just now?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Minsk：</span><br>
A person? What do you mean?<br>
All I know is that the sudden intensification of the snowstorm separated us from the rest of our unit and mass-produced ships.<br>
Anyway, we shouldn't do anything crazy. I've set what few mass-produced ships we still have to patrol mode.<br>
Who knows if they'll help, though? I just hope they can buy us some time...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Volga：</span><br>
The fleet is all separated... Oh, what do we do?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Minsk：</span><br>
Watch out!<br>
<br>
<br>
BOOOOOOOOOOOM!<br>
A shell fired from behind landed dangerously close to the pair.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Volga：</span><br>
It came from behind us. Are we surrounded...?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Minsk：</span><br>
D-did our mass-produced ships mistake us for the enemy?!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Volga：</span><br>
Umm... We're in danger, right?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Minsk：</span><br>
Can't blame them... The Siren jamming is so strong, and this weather definitely isn't helping.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Communicator：</span><br>
Rendezvous point... Contact... Coordinates...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Minsk：</span><br>
That was Rossiya's voice! Thank goodness the communicator is working...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Volga：</span><br>
Phew... Oh! It's cool that the communicator is fixed, but look. The snow is thinning out, too.<br>
Maybe the Weasel unit cleared their objective! Ugh, thank the stars for that...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Minsk：</span><br>
This is Minsk. Volga and I have joined up again, and our communication line seems to be recovering! Please give us the coordinates of the rendezvous point!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Sovetskaya Rossiya：</span><br>
This is Sovetskaya Rossiya. I've sent the coordinates.<br>
Perhaps due to the weakening interference, Omitter's vessel has retreated for the time being.<br>
We will continue the mission. Once we've all regathered, we resume our march toward the Polar North stronghold.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Minsk：</span><br>
Roger that!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Volga：</span><br>
Everyone's okay!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Minsk：</span><br>
Yeah! Let's go meet them right away!<br>

Lightning Unit<br>
Flagship: Tallinn<br>
Objective: Recapture the research base<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Soobrazitelny：</span><br>
Ah, ah... Achoooo!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Murmansk：</span><br>
You're running out of tissues, right? Here you go~<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Soobrazitelny：</span><br>
Thanks, Murmansk! But don't worry too much about me.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Tallinn：</span><br>
Soobrazitelny, when was the last time you took a break?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Soobrazitelny：</span><br>
The day before... I mean, uh, last night!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Murmansk：</span><br>
Hmm... It sounded to me like you were about to say "the day before yesterday."<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Tallinn：</span><br>
I ordered you to get proper sleep before the mission. Did you stay up all night?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Soobrazitelny：</span><br>
This mechanical mastermind doesn't need breaks!<br>
...Yeah, you don't believe that. But still, this mission is important. I had to make sure my modified mass-produced ships were in tip-top shape!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Murmansk：</span><br>
Ooh. I knew I hadn't seen you around! So you were modifying all of those ships~<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Soobrazitelny：</span><br>
I was doing other stuff, too! I just can't tell you much yet, but...<br>
Hah hah haaah! You'll be amazed when you see them! They're all incredible creations based on the files the Commander found!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Tallinn：</span><br>
Yeah, yeah. Thanks for your work on the mass-produced ships.<br>
Now, great mechanical mastermind, I'd like to ask about something I noticed during my pre-departure spot checks.<br>
While I'm hardly a professional, I do happen to know some things from my time with the Iron Blood.<br>
So let's just say my intuition is a little more reliable than your average shipgirl's.<br>
All this to say, well... Tell me, do your "special modifications" follow proper safety protocol?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Soobrazitelny：</span><br>
You know what they say! Protocol is made to be broken.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Tallinn：</span><br>
............<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Murmansk：</span><br>
A-as long as they don't explode, I'm sure everything will be fine~<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Soobrazitelny：</span><br>
............<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Murmansk：</span><br>
Surely they won't explode... Right?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Soobrazitelny：</span><br>
Th-they won't! I solved that problem by the third round of prototypes! They're as safe as can be!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Murmansk：</span><br>
In other words, the first and second prototypes did explode...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Tallinn：</span><br>
As I understand it, we would be better off positioning our mass-produced ships further away for this operation.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Soobrazitelny：</span><br>
Hey, you might not trust me, but at least trust Chkalov's engineering abilities!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Tallinn：</span><br>
I only let them be this close to us because I trust her!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Soobrazitelny：</span><br>
C'moooooon!<br>

Lightning Unit<br>
Flagship: Tallinn<br>
Objective: Recapture the research base<br>
On the horizon appeared a spire – the remains of the abandoned Northern Parliament research base.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Soobrazitelny：</span><br>
Oh, research base! Your mechanical mastermind, Soobrazitelny, has returned to you! Mommy's home!<br>
...It hasn't really changed much though, has it?<br>
I'm not about to talk about Sirens' aesthetic choices, but do they normally leave conquered buildings intact?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Tallinn：</span><br>
While the exterior may be different, it's likely that they've completely overhauled the interior.<br>
More importantly, our real objective here is Omitter's mass-production base that was discovered nearby.<br>
If we can conquer that, the other units will have fewer enemies in their way, and future fights in this area will be easier.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Soobrazitelny：</span><br>
We don't even have to kill them all, either. Our attack will draw plenty of Siren attention.<br>
That'll make things quicker for the units destroying the jamming device and weather control device.<br>
We've been fighting a defensive war for so long. It's out time the Northern Parliament shows Omitter its stuff!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Tallinn：</span><br>
That's right. I fully agree.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Murmansk：</span><br>
Ah! Everyone, the Siren's fortress defense fleet has appeared.<br>
One, two, three... Yep, they're approaching from three directions~<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Soobrazitelny：</span><br>
Hah hah haaah! In that case...!<br>
<br>
While the Lightning unit carefully adjusted their formation, Soobrazitelny suddenly sent a command to the mass-produced ship fleet.<br>
When she did, the usually-slow larger ships rushed forward out of nowhere and formed up before the Sirens could reach their attacking positions.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Tallinn：</span><br>
What in the... Mechanic, what have you done?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Soobrazitelny：</span><br>
I've set their engines to overdrive! It won't last long, but it packs a punch while it lasts!<br>
While they're active, we'll break through the Sirens' defensive line, destroy the production facility, and stop them from sending any reinforcements!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Tallinn：</span><br>
Wait. What happens when overdrive wears off?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Soobrazitelny：</span><br>
They'll charge into the Siren line, and BOOM! You get free damage as a side bonus!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Tallinn：</span><br>
...Do the other units know about this overdrive feature?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Soobrazitelny：</span><br>
Nope. I only installed it on our unit's ships, after all!<br>
It's still in the combat testing stage, but if it works well, I'll report it to the higher-ups and push to get it installed on every mass-produced sheep in our fleet!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Tallinn：</span><br>
Impressive that you thought of such a feature... Perhaps I should inform Soyuz of your genius?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Soobrazitelny：</span><br>
...I think she knows already.<br>
It's, um... It's written in the extra notes at the bottom of page 1,873 of our report!<br>
Anyway, let's focus on the battle! Focus!<br>
We gotta take back the research base and accomplish our duty!<br>

<br>
Weasel Unit<br>
Flagship: Kirov<br>
Objective: Destroy the weather control device<br>
Shortly after departing from the mission starting position, the calm weather abruptly changed into a violent blizzard.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Gromky：</span><br>
Ever since Rossiya's unit took down that Siren fortress, the weather in this area has been so unstable...<br>
Maybe Omitter had some kind of crazy back-up plan!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Kirov：</span><br>
If so, that would reveal that we've attacked at a time when her defenses are incomplete. There will be no better time than now.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Grozny：</span><br>
*hic*... So she back hired?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Kirov：</span><br>
Haha! Her plan backfired, you mean.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Grozny：</span><br>
Okay. So we fight the bad guys, destroy the device, and that'll fix the weather.<br>
That will actually fix the weather, right...?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Kirov：</span><br>
We can't be certain. But given the scale and our intelligence, we have good reason to believe that the main device is in the fortress we are targeting now.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Gromky：</span><br>
Then let's hurry—Aaaah! The wind...!<br>
<br>
Gromky held her hat down and tried her hardest to fight the wind, but the wild blizzard seemed unwilling to allow the fleet's advance.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Grozny：</span><br>
We can't stop the snow unless we reach the fortress, but we can't get there in this blizzard...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Kirov：</span><br>
Don't worry. I have a way to deal with this.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Grozny：</span><br>
Huh? Like a secret weapon?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Kirov：</span><br>
That's right. Though only for a short time, this device will allow us to resist the Sirens' extreme weather.<br>
The Portable Weather Stabilizer... When activated, it should reduce the impact of this extreme weather on us somewhat.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Grozny：</span><br>
Portable... Whuh?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Kirov：</span><br>
I don't know its inner workings myself, but according to Voroshilov, it seems to be made to "modify the climate of a permafrost environment to make it livable"...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Grozny：</span><br>
Modify the... Bwuh?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Kirov：</span><br>
Kronshtadt simplified it as such: "an easy-to-use weapon for the Northern Parliament to level the playing field a little bit."<br>
That said, due to their size, they can only be installed on mass-produced ships. Their energy usage means that we can't use them for long, as well.<br>
I will decide when to activate them. When I do, we charge through all at once.<br>
Unfortunately, we will have to weather the storm for the rest of the way.<br>
Consider it a trial that tests our will to pursue victory. Let them know that the Northern Parliament's charge cannot be stopped, with or without this device!<br>
On this day, we will show the Sirens our true strength!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Grozny：</span><br>
Yeeeah! I'll do my best to hold out!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Gromky：</span><br>
Ura! Me, too!<br>

Weasel Unit<br>
Flagship: Kirov<br>
Objective: Destroy the weather control device<br>
In the midst of the artificial snowstorm, the Weasel unit fought off the Siren fleet and pushed toward the fortress where the weather control device lay.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Grozny：</span><br>
I'm... at my limit...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Gromky：</span><br>
The Siren fleet isn't too strong, but... The snow is just too much!<br>
Comrade Kirov, do something about this!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Kirov：</span><br>
It seems now is the time to activate the device.<br>
Now! Portable Weather Stabilizers, activate! Mass-produced ships, deploy energy amplifiers!<br>
<br>
When Kirov issued the order, several mass-produced ships deployed odd-looking devices that resembled masts.<br>
The snowstorm from moments ago became a light breeze, and perhaps thanks to the devices' heat generation, the place felt just a touch warm.<br>
The device had literally snuffed out the abnormal weather, as if it had taken them to another world.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Grozny：</span><br>
The snow stopped...? And the ice is melting, too?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Gromky：</span><br>
Ura! Now we can actually make progress!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Kirov：</span><br>
Damn right! The Siren defensive line has fallen back, too; it seems even they know they're outmatched.<br>
Heh. Soyuz's expectations were right on the money.<br>
Without the effects of that weather, their defenses are weak, making it easy to fell these Sirens! Soon, we'll be able to destroy that device!<br>
All comrades, full speed ahead! We'll ride this momentum and obliterate the Sirens' defensive line!<br>
To arms, comrades!<br>

<br>
Hammer Unit<br>
Flagship: Sovetskaya Belorussiya<br>
Objective: Contain the Sirens' main force at the Crown<br>
Not long after the start of the mission, aurora spread out in the sky above the shipgirls.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Kiev：</span><br>
It's daytime... There shouldn't be an aurora at this time of day, right?<br>
The Sirens' weather control device really is extraordinary...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Chkalov：</span><br>
Making an aurora would be connected to the weather control, jamming device, and magnetic fields...<br>
In that case...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Sovetskaya Belorussiya：</span><br>
Chkalov? Do you have any ideas?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Chkalov：</span><br>
Tell me, do you know the phrase "geomagnetic reversal?"<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Sovetskaya Belorussiya：</span><br>
I only have cursory knowledge of it...<br>
That would be when the northern and southern poles of a planet weaken in magnetism and ultimately reverse polarity, correct?<br>
Is that related to the Sirens... and to this aurora?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Chkalov：</span><br>
That's more or less right. This planet's magnetic extremity actually isn't at the Polar North. Observation has revealed that it is actually slowly moving towards it by the day.<br>
As such, you can calculate where it is moving to an extent, allowing you to predict some things about the protons and electrons... That is, er, the aurora. Namely, you can predict where and when it will appear, along with its strength.<br>
The problem is that it's outright impossible for an aurora to appear in this location, unless it is an illusion created by the Sirens.<br>
Moreover, if there is a Siren base at the Polar North... Well, that's an issue.<br>
Because if this aurora is real, it's likely that the Sirens are controlling the entire planet's magnetic field. That's what I'm getting at.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Sovetskaya Belorussiya：</span><br>
If you'll allow me to be frank, it all sounds absurd.<br>
Just checking... You didn't join the operation just to investigate this, did you?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Chkalov：</span><br>
Hah! Of course not.<br>
I don't like taking on problems until I've witnessed them with my own two eyes. It's just that seeing it for myself helped me make a hypothesis.<br>
Sorry to trouble you, Comrade Belorussiya.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Sovetskaya Belorussiya：</span><br>
Not a problem. So? What are your thoughts now that you've entered your first official battle?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Chkalov：</span><br>
Nothing has changed. It's just another battlefield where I work to earn my keep. I'd say they're all the same.<br>
Anyway, rest assured. I'm very prepared.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Gangut：</span><br>
Comrades, the Crown is in sight!<br>
<br>
In the distance stood the icy, crown-like singularity.<br>
The countless hunks of ice floating at its tips cast shadows from beyond the clouds, making for an uncanny sight.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Chkalov：</span><br>
The Crown... A singularity opened by Code G of the Ashes...<br>
Hearing that the Sirens had conquered it was one thing, but now that I can get such a close-up look at it...<br>
I'm so curious to find out what's happened to the inside.<br>
Would it be like the NA Ocean the Commander described, or would it connect to a different Mirror Sea like the Tower of Midgard?<br>
If I ever get the chance, I'd die to check it out...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Sovetskaya Belorussiya：</span><br>
Unfortunately, the dying will have to wait, Chkalov.<br>
While investigating the Crown is a long-term priority, our current objective is to attract Omitter's attention.<br>
That will mean taking the brunt of their enormous forces. We don't have the luxury of fantasizing about anything else. Comrades! Do you still believe that you can rise above this challenge?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Kiev：</span><br>
No problems here. No matter how strong the enemy is, I will fight. And I will win.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Gangut：</span><br>
Hahahahaha! That's the spirit!<br>
I fought here once before the Crown opened! Of course I can win!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Chkalov：</span><br>
It's my first time out on the front lines, but it seems like I'm on the winning side. I'll help out where I can.<br>
By the way, I am a blueprint ship, so I bet I could even throw Omitter for a loop.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Sovetskaya Belorussiya：</span><br>
Good. Let us charge for the Crown and drag Omitter out of hiding!<br>

Objective: Contain the Sirens' main force at the Crown<br>
BOOOOOOOOOOOM!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Gangut：</span><br>
What's the matter, Sirens?! Is that all you've got?!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Kiev：</span><br>
Enemy reinforcements spotted ahead! They're approaching!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Gangut：</span><br>
I don't care! Send all the reinforcements you want, it won't matter!<br>
I feel my blood boiling! Finally, I'm in battle again!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Chkalov：</span><br>
Sorry, but you're not the only one in this battle, Gangut~<br>
<br>
Before Gangut could fire her main cannon once more, Chkalov's carrier-borne craft mowed down the Siren reinforcements with explosions.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Gangut：</span><br>
Very well! Watch my back, Comrade Chkalov!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Chkalov：</span><br>
Don't expect too much from me, but that wave was little more than a warm-up.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Sovetskaya Belorussiya：</span><br>
This is a hell of a violent reception here...<br>
But if we cause enough havoc, she won't be able to sit idly by and let the Crown be taken from her—<br>
<span style="color:#ec5d53;">Communicator：</span><br>
—Don't push your luck, fools!<br>
Is every one of you both blind and deaf?<br>
Do you believe your power is so great that you can outwit Omitter?!<br>
Or did you think your idiotic all-out attack would overcome my genius?!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Sovetskaya Belorussiya：</span><br>
...Seems like we've found the main body.<br>
<span style="color:#ec5d53;">Omitter：</span><br>
That I am! I've seen through your whole goddamned strategy!<br>
I'm almost impressed by how you go through the same pointless struggle time and time again!<br>
It's time for you to learn once and for all that your efforts are in vain!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Sovetskaya Belorussiya：</span><br>
Hold it! I don't know if I believe you.<br>
If you know the entirety of our strategy, then enlighten us. We'd all love to hear your opinion.<br>
<span style="color:#ec5d53;">Omitter：</span><br>
You're trying to buy time now?!<br>
The whole point of your struggle here is to detain my forces and allow your stupid friends to move as they like through my domain!<br>
Well, here I am! Just like you asked! But now it's my turn!<br>
I'll slaughter you all in seconds, and then, I'll do the same to the other units!<br>
<br>
BOOOOOOOOOOOM!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Gangut：</span><br>
Hahahahaha! That's big talk, for someone who's about to get hers!<br>
We're not here to detain you—we're here to DEFEAT you, Omitter!<br>
<span style="color:#ec5d53;">Omitter：</span><br>
Take this! Spacetime-Devouring Big Bang Destruction Cannon!<br>
<br>
Dazzling light emitted from the optical weapon swept across the water's surface, vaporizing mass-produced ships and the ice itself instantly.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Kiev：</span><br>
Hot, hot!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Gangut：</span><br>
She's gone straight for a powerful attack! ...Don't run away! You need to get in close to her!<br>
Show me all of your new tricks, Omitteeer!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Chkalov：</span><br>
Wait, the wind is weakening... Jamming and abnormal weather indicators are rapidly falling!<br>
Fantastic work, Lancet and Lightning units!<br>
<span style="color:#ec5d53;">Omitter：</span><br>
Tch... If Compiler were here, I could overcome you trash with mass-produced ships alone...<br>
This is the first time... I've been made such a fool of...<br>
You'll pay for this! I'll torture every last one of you to the bitter end!<br>
Consider this an honor! You will be the first to witness the true strength of my fleet!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Chkalov：</span><br>
The mass-produced ships are recovering? Ah, so you're the new command unit...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Gangut：</span><br>
Hah! A fight's no fun without a trick or ten up your sleeve!<br>
<span style="color:#ec5d53;">Omitter：</span><br>
Enough talk! I'll personally send you to the ocean floor!<br>
<br>
BOOOOOOOOOOOM!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Gangut：</span><br>
You're the only one who's going down there, Omitter!<br>
I've had enough talk, too. Comrades! Continue your offensive!<br>
<br>
At the base of the Crown, the heroic Northern Parliament warriors challenged the evil master of the Polar North.<br>
The cacophony of booms, flashes of light, and steel wings unfurling in the sky continued on and on...<br>

<br>
Wolf Unit<br>
Flagship: Kursk<br>
Objective: Scout the region<br>
Some time had passed since the beginning of the operation. All five shipgirl units had charged into the snowy region of ocean.<br>
In a sea route separated from the main battlefield, an unannounced sixth unit stole undetected along the waters.<br>
Code name Wolf was led by a single woman, one who truly was a fitting choice for a lone wolf.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Sevastopol：</span><br>
Hahahahah! So all of the other units are feints, and we're the real stars!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Kursk：</span><br>
Right.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Sevastopol：</span><br>
Rejoice, Kursk! You have been designated as she who will lead our revolution!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Kursk：</span><br>
Right.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Sevastopol：</span><br>
...Cold. Are you no good at talking or something, Comrade Kursk?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Kursk：</span><br>
Right.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Sevastopol：</span><br>
............<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Kursk：</span><br>
...Yes. As you said, I'm not much of a communicator. I'm used to working alone, after all.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Sevastopol：</span><br>
I see, I see! Well... No worries! You'll open up in no time, I'm sure!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Kursk：</span><br>
Mm.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Sevastopol：</span><br>
Aahahahah... By the way! I brought something fun!<br>
We're not in the Sirens' sphere of influence yet, so we might as well partake just a little...<br>
Let's see, where are you...<br>
...Hm? Where did my special supplies go?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Voroshilov：</span><br>
No drinking on the job. I left it back at our point of departure.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Sevastopol：</span><br>
Noooo!<br>
It's not like I'm Gangut! I drink wine, not vodka! Wine is made for celebrating victories!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Voroshilov：</span><br>
We celebrate victories after the battle is over. There's no reason for you to have it with you during the battle, now, is there?<br>
...Sevastopol, you can drink to your heart's content after the battle.<br>
Sound good to you, Kursk?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Kursk：</span><br>
Right.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Voroshilov：</span><br>
Two versus one. Seems like this argument is settled.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Sevastopol：</span><br>
Hey, nobody said we were keeping score! This is for the sake of a revolution, so what's wrong with a few sips?!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Kursk：</span><br>
Right.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Sevastopol：</span><br>
SEE?! Now you're in the minority this time, Voroshilov!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Voroshilov：</span><br>
Then why don't you go back and get it? Time is ticking, and the mission has already started.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Sevastopol：</span><br>
...Fiiine. I give up.<br>
<br>
It was then that a white owl emerged from the curtain of snow and approached the group.<br>
The bird, seemingly unaffected by the Sirens' severe weather , shook the snow off of its wings and quietly landed on Kursk's shoulder.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Kursk：</span><br>
We're almost in Siren territory. My recon drone tells me that there is nothing abnormal on our route.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Sevastopol：</span><br>
Recon drone? You mean that little owl...?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Kursk：</span><br>
No, this is just an owl. My recon drone is beyond our current field of vision.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Sevastopol：</span><br>
Okay, but that's an easy mistake to make, right? Like, c'mon.<br>
<br>
Sevastopol shot a glance at the owl. It turned its head around 180 degrees to face her, and apparently sensing her confusion...<br>
It closed its eyes in silence.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Sevastopol：</span><br>
...Heheh. It's a lot like you, Kursk.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Kursk：</span><br>
Disagreed. Regardless, the snow is getting stronger. Don't stray away.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Sevastopol：</span><br>
Heh. Don't you worry about me!<br>

Wolf Unit<br>
Flagship: Kursk<br>
Objective: Scout the region<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Kursk：</span><br>
The region up ahead is extremely dangerous. Stop for a moment.<br>
<br>
Layers and layers of dark clouds covered the sky, blotting out the sun and heralding the arrival of a great snowstorm.<br>
On the horizon, just as far as the eyes could see, was a structure that looked to be a Siren facility.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Voroshilov：</span><br>
The Sirens' floating fortress, one of the pillars of Omitter's Polar North defenses.<br>
Intelligence has confirmed that the weather control device, the cause of the frequent abnormal weather in this polar sea, is there.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Kursk：</span><br>
Kirov is handling that one?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Voroshilov：</span><br>
Yep. According to the plan, Kirov's Weasel unit should be attacking that fortress.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Kursk：</span><br>
So the battle has yet to begin.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Sevastopol：</span><br>
They must be fighting some Siren patrols they ran into along the way.<br>
Unlike us, they have tons of mass-produced ships. They're not exactly going to be stealthy.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Kursk：</span><br>
I was hoping to slip through in the confusion of battle. Shame.<br>
Voroshilov, activate the Light of Dawn. We'll adjust our route.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Voroshilov：</span><br>
Got it. Activating now!<br>
Wait... Our objective's coordinates changed?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Kursk：</span><br>
They changed?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Sevastopol：</span><br>
Are we sure this device is working?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Voroshilov：</span><br>
It was made based on the documents Comrade Commander recovered, so it should be more reliable than most of the toys we get from the higher-ups.<br>
Either our objective has changed coordinates, its relative position to us has changed, or another abnormal wavelength has been detected nearby.<br>
The device only detects the flow of energy, so it's kind of natural that it's not the most reliable thing.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Kursk：</span><br>
So our only course forward is to thoroughly check every anomalous coordinate?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Voroshilov：</span><br>
Yeah. That just goes to show how hard it is to proactively investigate Siren secrets.<br>
Honestly, I'm happy just to have a device that leads us to any possible clues.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Kursk：</span><br>
Understood.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Sevastopol：</span><br>
So? It seems like the closest coordinates aren't those of the floating fortress. Should we start there?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Voroshilov：</span><br>
Yep. As planned, we'll investigate any unusual wavelengths that the device finds.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Kursk：</span><br>
Changing course. Let's go.<br>

Wolf Unit<br>
Flagship: Kursk<br>
Objective: Scout the region<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Sevastopol：</span><br>
Remember what Soyuz said? "Focus your investigation on places where you can observe the aurora."<br>
The aurora is really clear here, so we must be close to our goal, right?!<br>
Now, I wonder what we're gonna find...<br>
Finding Omitter's main body would be kind of boring... At least let us find a new Siren weapon, or something.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Kursk：</span><br>
...Not here, either.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Sevastopol：</span><br>
What? How do you know?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Kursk：</span><br>
The aurora is weakening.<br>
I don't like this... Voroshilov, what are the coordinates of our objective now?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Voroshilov：</span><br>
I'll check right away.<br>
Device is functioning normally. But the wavelength detection... seems to be a problem.<br>
It's displaying the faraway one we first detected when we entered this area.<br>
The abnormal wavelength closer to the aurora has disappeared.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Sevastopol：</span><br>
It disappeared?!<br>
Did the Sirens hide it somehow?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Kursk：</span><br>
Possible, but there are two pieces of evidence that contradict that.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Sevastopol：</span><br>
Two? So you think they're not setting a trap for us?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Voroshilov：</span><br>
If they wanted to lure us in, they wouldn't need to use the aurora. Also...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Kursk：</span><br>
Intuition. That abnormal wavelength didn't have the stench of Sirens on it.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Voroshilov：</span><br>
A hunter's intuition, huh?<br>
That makes sense. We haven't even run into any Siren patrols here, let alone gotten into any battles.<br>
But we are still able to trace abnormal wavelengths, so it doesn't seem like the device is malfunctioning...<br>
What if the thing we're pursuing is actually moving?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Kursk：</span><br>
There's only one way to find out. Let's give chase.<br>

<br>
Wolf Unit<br>
Flagship: Kursk<br>
Objective: Scout the region<br>
The operation as a whole was going well, but only thanks to the progress of the other units. The Wolf unit was not finding much success.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Sevastopol：</span><br>
Kuybyshev's Lancet unit destroyed the jamming device, so we've been receiving constant reports from the other units.<br>
Kirov's Weasel unit stopped the weather control device, so the snow has calmed down here.<br>
But the Wolf unit...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Voroshilov：</span><br>
It would be a lie to say things are going well.<br>
The wavelengths we follow are constantly moving and disappearing.<br>
I'm observing changes in coordinates every ten minutes, but I can't find any regularity in those movements. There's no way for me to figure out what's going on.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Sevastopol：</span><br>
At this rate, we're gonna run straight into the Crown or the Polar North stronghold.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Kursk：</span><br>
They're on to us.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Sevastopol：</span><br>
On to us? You mean the Sirens are?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Kursk：</span><br>
I don't know.<br>
Either Siren scouts happened to see us, or someone else is in this region.<br>
Either way, there's intent in those changes in coordinates.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Voroshilov：</span><br>
If it's the Sirens, then they'd send forces to attack or distract us, right?<br>
Omitter's main force and the Polar North stronghold defenses may be focused on dealing with other units, but it's outright odd that we haven't run into anything at all.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Kursk：</span><br>
Right. Which is what leads me to believe that someone else is present.<br>
It seems we aren't the only hunters here.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Voroshilov：</span><br>
So you mean... Someone other than us is searching for Siren secrets?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Kursk：</span><br>
That would be ideal. We would still have an opportunity to outfox them.<br>
We'll have to lead them astray while we hasten our own search.<br>
You said the coordinates move every ten minutes?<br>
What are the new coordinates?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Voroshilov：</span><br>
The most recent wavelength appeared near the Polar North stronghold.<br>
Just in case, I'll change the scanning frequency to every five minutes.<br>
It'll mean pushing the device to its limits, but we'll need as up-to-date information as we can get.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Kursk：</span><br>
...Hopefully, we can settle this before the wavelength disappears this time.<br>

<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Kursk：</span><br>
Stop. Something's happening up ahead.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Sevastopol：</span><br>
Huh?! What, and where?!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Kursk：</span><br>
I see wreckage up ahead. An enormous amount of it.<br>
...Mass-produced Sirens. The whole mob of them was destroyed.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Sevastopol：</span><br>
Hmm. More of your hunter's intuition?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Kursk：</span><br>
No. My recon drones found it.<br>
<br>
The unit cautiously pressed on, entering the area full of Siren wreckage.<br>
It seemed a fierce battle had taken place here before their arrival.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Sevastopol：</span><br>
They're all mass-produced Sirens... Rossiya's unit really kicked butt, huh?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Voroshilov：</span><br>
Not necessarily. Most of them don't seem to have been destroyed by our weapons.<br>
And if the smell of smoke is anything to go by, this fight was awfully recent...<br>
If Rossiya's unit had come through here, then they would have said something over comms. The fact that they haven't means...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Sevastopol：</span><br>
This must be... one of those META shipgirls.<br>
Mmgh. If only Comrade Commander had given us a META detector.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Kursk：</span><br>
The best-laid plans of mice and men often go awry.<br>
Besides... There's an easier way to tell.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Sevastopol：</span><br>
Uh-huh? What is it?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Kursk：</span><br>
You'll know when you see it.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Sevastopol：</span><br>
...?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Kursk：</span><br>
Voroshilov, has the abnormal wavelength moved?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Voroshilov：</span><br>
Not yet. But it's right about time...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Kursk：</span><br>
We'll make it in time. I made sure of that.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Sevastopol：</span><br>
Kursk, what will we do if it really is a META?<br>
Do we fight? Try to reason with them? Or do we try to gather the other units now?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Kursk：</span><br>
...Wait and watch. First, we need to see what move they make.<br>
There's no need to pursue prey beyond your capabilities. Escape is always an option.<br>
They may try to attack us. Brace yourselves for anything.<br>

Halt.<br>
I smell a beast... No, that's the stench of raw malice.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Sevastopol：</span><br>
Yeah...! That aura's almost as strong as Gangut's vodka!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Kursk：</span><br>
Up above! Dodge!<br>
<br>
BOOOOOOOOOOOM!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Sevastopol：</span><br>
Did someone just launch carrier-borne craft at me?! Geez, that scared me!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Kursk：</span><br>
A carrier?! But that wave of attacks was too uncoordinated...<br>
I see. Different forces ahead and behind us.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Voroshilov：</span><br>
We're surrounded?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Kursk：</span><br>
Two enemies total. One in front. One behind.<br>
Hiryuu of the Sakura Empire... But she's only a Pawn.<br>
The other feels... odd. That must be a META.<br>
Recon drones would only be shot down. I'll use Flea this time.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Sevastopol：</span><br>
F-Flea...?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Kursk：</span><br>
A small submarine used for scouting. Perfect for intelligence operations.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Sevastopol：</span><br>
You sure have a lot of crazy tricks up your sleeve...<br>
But ol' battleship Sevastopol is still the real firepower of this operation!♪<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Kursk：</span><br>
...Sorry for not explaining ahead of time.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Voroshilov：</span><br>
Forget all that. Why is a META working with a Pawn?<br>
And Pawns shouldn't be able to slip through our radar undetected, right?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Kursk：</span><br>
I'm afraid I don't know...<br>
A second wave is coming! Watch out!<br>
<br>
<br>
BOOOOOOOOOOOM!<br>
<span style="color:#ec5d53;">Souryuu META：</span><br>
............<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Voroshilov：</span><br>
She's strong... My attacks aren't even working.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Sevastopol：</span><br>
At least the Pawn is like any other Pawn we know.<br>
She might be a little durable, but she's a weakling otherwise!<br>
Kursk, can we deal with this Pawn first?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Kursk：</span><br>
I wouldn't. It smells like a trap.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Voroshilov：</span><br>
More intuition, I'm guessing...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Kursk：</span><br>
Right. Unlike you two, I have an especially keen intuition.<br>
That would probably be why Soyuz allowed me to lead this unit. If that is a problem, I'm sor—<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Voroshilov：</span><br>
Don't apologize. You're our flagship, right?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Sevastopol：</span><br>
Yeah! We'll do whatever it takes to help a friend of the revolution! Now, do we have any way to defeat them?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Kursk：</span><br>
Absolutely not. We retreat.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Sevastopol：</span><br>
Roger that! Wait... Retreat? Even though we finally caught them?!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Kursk：</span><br>
I'll explain later. You said you'd help, right?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Sevastopol：</span><br>

Flagship: Kursk<br>
Objective: Scout the region<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Kursk：</span><br>
We should be safe here.<br>
Now, we should hide and trail them from a far enough distance that they don't detect us.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Sevastopol：</span><br>
I think I see how you're thinking now!<br>
Whatever this anomalous wavelength we're looking for is, it must be something important to the Sirens.<br>
And if that META keeps on wreaking havoc after what she did to those Siren ships, they're sure to come and try to stop her.<br>
Which means if we back off, we can let the META weaken the Sirens first!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Kursk：</span><br>
You are correct. We pit the META and Sirens against each other.<br>
The other units are doing well. We have time.<br>
Has the anomalous wavelength moved?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Voroshilov：</span><br>
It hasn't moved yet. Maybe she's already fighting Sirens?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Kursk：</span><br>
Good. We don't know how much of a fight the Sirens will put up against her...<br>
But let's wait and watch for now. I'll have Flea continue to monitor them.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Communicator：</span><br>
*bzzzzzt*...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Voroshilov：</span><br>
...Hm? I can't make out what's being said.<br>
The jamming device should be destroyed by now... Is the communicator broken?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Sevastopol：</span><br>
Here. Let me try this really smart method Soobrazitelny taught me.<br>
<br>
*pow!* *bang!* *crash!*<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Communicator：</span><br>
Soyuz... Read me...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Sevastopol：</span><br>
Mm... Still not fixed, huh? At least we can kinda hear people now...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Kursk：</span><br>
I can't believe it...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Communicator：</span><br>
Current situation... We are... Fully...<br>
Must terminate... Mission at once...<br>
Whole fleet... Assemble at... I repeat...<br>
*bzzzzzt*...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Sevastopol：</span><br>
Wh-what's going on?<br>
I couldn't hear that well, but she said we're terminating the mission, right?!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Voroshilov：</span><br>
I'll contact Soyuz. We need to figure out what's happening.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Kursk：</span><br>
...No answer.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Voroshilov：</span><br>
What about the port and dock?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Kursk：</span><br>
Likewise. No Western Europa base is picking up.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Voroshilov：</span><br>
There's no choice. We need to contact Comrade Commander!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Kursk：</span><br>
I tried that, too... Still no luck.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Sovetskaya Rossiya：</span><br>
Wolf unit, can you hear me?! Answer at once!<br>
This is the Fist unit. The operation has been terminated! Break radio silence and respond immediately!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Voroshilov：</span><br>
This is Voroshilov of the Wolf unit! We can hear you!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Sovetskaya Rossiya：</span><br>
Oh...! Thank goodness you're safe!<br>
Did you hear Soyuz's broadcast message?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Voroshilov：</span><br>
Yes, though intermittently, due to interference. What in the world is going on?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Sovetskaya Rossiya：</span><br>
We don't have a full grasp of the situation, either.<br>
However, we've confirmed that we have lost all contact with Western Europa.<br>
However, it seems we can communicate with other units and patrols in the region without issue.<br>
For the time being, we are to gather at the operation's advance base in the archipelago.<br>
If there are any Siren pursuers, do not panic; fight them off with cool heads.<br>
Once everyone has evacuated from the danger zone and gathered at the rendezvous point, we will gather information and consider our next moves.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Voroshilov：</span><br>
Understood... I suppose this is our only choice for now.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Sovetskaya Rossiya：</span><br>
Unfortunately, that seems to be the case. Anyway, I'll see you at the base.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Voroshilov：</span><br>
Right. See you there.<br>
<br>
It seemed as though the storm raging over the Polar North had ceased for the moment.<br>
However, they were oblivious to the greater threat that approached––<br>
