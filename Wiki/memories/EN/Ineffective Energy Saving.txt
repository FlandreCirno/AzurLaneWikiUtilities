1 Indomitable's Plan<br>
Port - Office<br>
Indomitable is sprawled on my office desk, lazily sliding her fingers across a tablet and occasionally humming cheerfully to herself.<br>
As soon as she hears me put my pen down, she casually lifts her head and lets out a big yawn.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Indomitable：</span><br>
*yawn*... I presume you've finally finished your work.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Yup, this is a good stopping point for today.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Indomitable：</span><br>
I'm more or less finished with mine. I've come up with a date plan for tomorrow.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
What about your actual work? Did you get it done?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Indomitable：</span><br>
I for one think that working out a date plan IS actual work.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Whatever you say...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Indomitable：</span><br>
Well? Care to take a look?<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Sure. Work needs to be evaluated, after all.<br>
<br>
I pick up the tablet in front of her and take a look at the plan she's put together.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Ride a tandem bike, have a picnic on a boat, visit the market in the park, eat a lavish dinner...<br>
Well, it's certainly an achievable plan, I just don't think you, in particular, can make it happen.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Indomitable：</span><br>
Heehee. A fair assessment. I am indeed a lady who prefers more leisurely activities.<br>
However, let's not forget I had to sell my body to you for this opportunity.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
...All you did was sort paperwork. That's not what I'd call "selling your body to me!"<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Indomitable：</span><br>
We all sell our bodies when we do labour, do we not? Never mind that – what matters is that I have ample energy to spend on a hard-earned date.<br>
At least, I'm fairly sure I do...<br>
Furthermore, this plan IS more on the laid-back side of things. Did you not notice the subtle brilliance of it?<br>
<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项1：I'm afraid not.</span>'''''<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项2：I did, actually.</span>'''''<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项1）</span>'''''Your date plan is just so succinct that I fail to see this "brilliance."<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Indomitable：</span><br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项1）</span>'''''Simplicity is my style, don't you know?<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项2）</span>'''''It's brilliant because thinking drains you out, and you just chose some random activities instead – am I right?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Indomitable：</span><br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项2）</span>'''''How did you know that– I mean, no!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Indomitable：</span><br>
I considered each of these activities carefully!<br>
So carefully, in fact, that I overworked my brain to the point of dizziness, as you can see...<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Okay, so could you tell me your reasoning?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Indomitable：</span><br>
Take the boat picnic, for instance. I can simply order all the food in advance.<br>
The only thing we have to do is enjoy the meal.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Fair enough. What about the rest?<br>
Like riding the tandem bike. Don't get me wrong, I'm glad you picked something involving physical activity of your own accord...<br>
It's just that I'm worried you'll get fed up with it.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Indomitable：</span><br>
You know me well, Commander.<br>
You don't quite know EVERYTHING about me, however.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
What do you mean?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Indomitable：</span><br>
Hmm... I can't be bothered to explain.<br>
You'll understand what I mean when we get to it.<br>
Let it be a surprise until then.<br>
All in all, I think this date is an opportunity for us to get to know one another better.<br>
What do you say? Will you go on a date with me?<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Alright, I'm in. Sounds fun.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Indomitable：</span><br>
Wonderful! Look forward to it, Commander!<br>
<br>
After exclaiming that with enthusiasm, she immediately sprawls out on the desk again.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Indomitable：</span><br>
Goodness me, that was a lot of talking.<br>
I hope you don't mind if I rest for a while. Just a short while, I promise...<br>

<br>
2 The Great Cycling<br>
Port Park - Artificial Lake<br>
It's the morning of the next day, and Indomitable and I have come to the park while the sun isn't that harsh yet.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Indomitable：</span><br>
Mmhh. This truly is perfect weather. It's just right for leisurely activities.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Are we really going to bike around this lake? It's pretty big, you know.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Indomitable：</span><br>
Umm... Don't worry about that.<br>
I chose the quickest and most scenic route, I assure you.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
I can always count on you taking every measure to save energy.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Indomitable：</span><br>
Precisely. Now then, let's get on. This will take a bit of effort... Ahh...<br>
Okay, now please get on the front seat and provide the propulsion.<br>
I will sit in the back. I'll have you know, looking at the map and providing directions isn't effortless.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Can't you just use a map app? Or a GPS?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Indomitable：</span><br>
You can only take the standard route if you rely on satnav. There are many forks in the road in these parts.<br>
It's best if I check the map manually and guide you along. Please have faith in me, Commander.<br>
While it is a bother to use my brain, there's no other choice now that we're here.<br>
Oh well. I'll take on this burden for you.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
So if I got that right, you want me to pedal the bike while you just sit on it?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Indomitable：</span><br>
More specifically, I'll use my brain while you use your brawn.<br>
It's exhausting, I know. For both of us.<br>
<br>
In the end, I accept this arrangement and get on the tandem bicycle with her.<br>
We slowly go down the bikeway along the lakeside. Sunlight shimmers on the water, its sparkling waves spreading outward.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Indomitable：</span><br>
Just continue straight down this road.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
And after that?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Indomitable：</span><br>
After that? The path splits, so I'll think about it when we get there.<br>
Now, I need to rest my eyes for a minute.<br>
While this breeze is no doubt pleasant, it's drying out my eyes.<br>
<br>
A while later, Indomitable has gone completely quiet.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Indomitable? You didn't doze off, did you?<br>
Where do we go now?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Indomitable：</span><br>
Umm...<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Were you spacing out on me again?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Indomitable：</span><br>
Uh, no, I was just recharging my batteries.<br>
Pardon, what did you say?<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
I asked which of these paths to take.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Indomitable：</span><br>
Ahh, well...<br>
The right one. Let's cross that bridge.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Didn't you say this would be a balance between hard work and relaxation? You've been doing nothing but the latter this whole time.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Indomitable：</span><br>
Heehee. That's precisely the sort of date I desired. It's a wonderful time.<br>
Say, are you tired? Hmm... Above average body temperature. Excuse me while I just...<br>
<br>
I feel a warmth coming from behind. She must be leaning against me, pressing her ear to my back.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Indomitable：</span><br>
Hmm. No, I don't hear a particularly intense heartbeat.<br>
I suppose this level of exercise is a walk – or should I say, pedal – in the park for you.<br>
<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项1：What are you scheming this time?</span>'''''<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项2：That's thanks to the route you chose.</span>'''''<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项1）</span>'''''What? You can't be complimenting me like that for nothing.<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项1）</span>'''''I'll say this upfront – no amount of praise will make me go faster.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Indomitable：</span><br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项1）</span>'''''Heehee. Don't worry, this speed is more than adequate.<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项1）</span>'''''I will say, this Commander-brand propulsion system is very reliable.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项2）</span>'''''The route you chose is the shortest one, so it's not very physically demanding.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Indomitable：</span><br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项2）</span>'''''R-really?<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项2）</span>'''''Then it was worth expending all that brainpower.<br>
<br>
She giggles almost as though all the problems in the world have nothing to do with her.<br>
I feel like I understand her carefree attitude towards life just a little more.<br>

3 Mid-Trip Mistake<br>
Port Park - Artificial Lake<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Indomitable：</span><br>
Ahh, this is so nice. I wish we could keep riding like this forever...<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Wait a sec. This isn't right.<br>
<br>
Spotting a flight of stairs ahead, I immediately pull on the brakes.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Indomitable：</span><br>
Owch... My nose...<br>
<br>
In her careless relaxation, her face slams into my back due to our sudden stop.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
My bad. You okay?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Indomitable：</span><br>
I'm alright... Why did you stop?<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Because I think we're on the wrong path.<br>
This one leads to a set of stairs. You didn't expect me to carry the tandem bike, did you?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Indomitable：</span><br>
What? Of course not...<br>
Well, I propose that we go back the way we came.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Before anything else, let's see the map.<br>
<br>
We hop off the bicycle and stand by the shoulder of the road, heads together as we check the map.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Indomitable：</span><br>
So many branching paths. How annoying...<br>
It's clear we went the wrong way somewhere – but where?<br>
Here? Or maybe here? It could even be...<br>
<br>
She furrows her brow at the maze of winding routes depicted on the map.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
At any rate, we're heading in the complete opposite direction to our destination.<br>
We can either retrace our steps, or take a detour to get back on track. I think both are valid.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Indomitable：</span><br>
Yes, but that leaves the question of what route to take.<br>
We need to pick the shortest, most effort-saving route out of all these...<br>
Goodness, making decisions is so hard...<br>
<br>
She looks at my face, and then suddenly takes my hand.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Indomitable：</span><br>
Commander, may I ask you to take care of the navigation?<br>
<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项1：Sure thing.</span>'''''<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项2：You're asking a lot of me here.</span>'''''<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项1）</span>'''''I'll handle it no problem.<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项1）</span>'''''That is, if you're willing to cover for me as the... "propulsion system."<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项2）</span>'''''Navigating isn't hard by itself, but doing that and cycling at the same time is pretty tricky.<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项2）</span>'''''Do you think you could cover for me as the "propulsion system"?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Indomitable：</span><br>
Uhh, well...<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
I'm just pulling your leg.<br>
We'll do it together.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Indomitable：</span><br>
I almost thought you were serious... You can be quite the joker sometimes.<br>
Our next destination is the boat docks. Please make sure you take the closest route there.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Got it. I'll go with the shortest one so you won't wear yourself out.<br>
<br>
And so, we both get back on the bicycle and go down the new route.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Indomitable：</span><br>
*pant*... *pant*... I'm really trying my best this time, Commander.<br>
Gosh, I'm exhausted... Could we stop and take a break?<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
We haven't even gone a hundred meters yet.<br>
Come on, keep going.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Indomitable：</span><br>
Very well... This was my mistake, after all...<br>
This was supposed to be relaxing... Why do I have to strain myself?<br>
<br>
Hearing her grumble under her breath, I can't help but crack a smile.<br>
While this isn't the easygoing bike ride I initially imagined, it's a surprisingly good alternative.<br>

4 Lunch on the Lake<br>
Port Park - Artificial Lake<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Indomitable：</span><br>
Phew... We're finally here.<br>
I feel like my legs aren't a part of me anymore...<br>
<br>
After a strenuous bicycle ride, we've finally arrived at the boat docks.<br>
A small sightseeing boat is already moored here, with soft cushions that create a cozy atmosphere.<br>
There is also a table with juice, sandwiches, a salad, and fruits. It's the whole picnic shebang.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Indomitable：</span><br>
It's good I booked the boat and the lunch in advance.<br>
The engine is electric as well. It won't require any input on our part.<br>
I hope everything from this point on goes without a hitch, because I'd really like to rest now.<br>
Well then, let's get on board.<br>
<br>
We get on the boat and turn on the engine. The boat starts slowly heading for the center of the lake.<br>
Our surroundings get quieter bit by bit. The water's surface is as still as a mirror, reflecting the swaying trees in the distance.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Indomitable：</span><br>
I much prefer my leisure time to be, well, leisurely like this.<br>
Sitting in a comfortable boat, slowly savouring some lunch – this is life.<br>
Now let's dig in, shall we?<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Sure.<br>
<br>
She sticks her fork into a strawberry, and then presents it to me.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Indomitable：</span><br>
Would you care for a bite?<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Mmm... That's really sweet.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Indomitable：</span><br>
Yes! Mission complete: Feed the Commander. Now, could I ask you to do the same for me?<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
What, is it too much work to do it yourself?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Indomitable：</span><br>
Not quite... I simply wish to bond with you a little more. Yes, that is all.<br>
<br>
With a shrug, I pick up a sandwich and bring it to her mouth. She takes a satisfied bite out of it.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Indomitable：</span><br>
You really are everything I could ask for.<br>
Oh, hang on. I want to take another bite, so please keep holding it.<br>
<br>
All of a sudden, the boat rocks, sending her straight towards me.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Indomitable：</span><br>
Eek...<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
You alright?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Indomitable：</span><br>
Heehee... I didn't expect it to feel so pleasant to be in your arms.<br>
If you don't mind, please hold this pose. It'll make it easier to eat this way.<br>
<br>
She mumbles as she pulls my hand towards her and takes another bite of the sandwich.<br>
She doesn't want to leave my embrace.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Indomitable：</span><br>
Aren't you going to eat?<br>
<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项1：Only after you've had your fill.</span>'''''<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项2：I'm waiting for you to feed me.</span>'''''<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项1）</span>'''''You can have first dibs on anything you like.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Indomitable：</span><br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项1）</span>'''''Alright, if you're sure.<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项1）</span>'''''I'm not one to let such a luxurious occasion to go waste, so I'll help myself, if you don't mind.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项2）</span>'''''You haven't returned the favor for those sandwich bites yet.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Indomitable：</span><br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项2）</span>'''''What? You are?<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项2）</span>'''''In that case, please open wide... I'll need a good rest after this – eating takes quite a bit of energy, after all.<br>

5 In the Same Boat<br>
Port Park - Artificial Lake<br>
After lunch, we're just drifting on the lake. The warm sun's rays tempt me to take a nap.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Indomitable：</span><br>
Whew... This is the ideal way to rest.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Sure is. It's nice to get away from everything and just relax sometimes.<br>
<br>
After gazing vacantly at the lake's scenery for a while, I suddenly realize that Indomitable has fallen asleep.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Indomitable?<br>
<br>
As she rests on my shoulder, her breathing is soft and steady. She has completely tuned out her surroundings.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
That morning cycling we did must've really tired her out.<br>
No harm in letting her sleep for a bit, I suppose.<br>
<br>
My eyelids similarly start feeling heavy. It's not long before I doze off, leaning against her just as she does against me.<br>
I'm not sure how long I was asleep for, but when I wake up, the electric motor lets out one last sigh before the boat loses all propulsion.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Indomitable：</span><br>
*yawn*... That was a lovely nap.<br>
Commander? Did you fall asleep, too?<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Mgh... Looks like it.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Indomitable：</span><br>
Uh-oh... We have a problem. The engine has stopped!<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Let me see...<br>
Bad news. The battery is dead.<br>
There's good news too, though. This boat can also be powered by pedalling.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Indomitable：</span><br>
P-pedalling?<br>
Err... My feet feel a bit sore, so...<br>
<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项1：Can you handle navigation, then?</span>'''''<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项2：Come on. Let's do this.</span>'''''<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项1）</span>'''''You tell me where to go, and I'll be the "propulsion system" again.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Indomitable：</span><br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项1）</span>'''''I don't think you need directions on a lake.<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项1）</span>'''''You're assuming I'm going to slack off again, aren't you?<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项2）</span>'''''If we work together, just like on the bike, we'll reach the shore in no time.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Indomitable：</span><br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项2）</span>'''''Well, if you insist...<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项2）</span>'''''*sigh*... Very well. I'll do my best to help.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
It has to be done. We're in the same boat here. Literally.<br>
<br>
The pedals under our feet cry out with a creak as she and I work together to move towards the shore.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Indomitable：</span><br>
What a bother... Next time, I'll double-check the battery before we set out...<br>
No, forget that – there will be no next time!<br>
Going outside isn't my style. I'd much rather stay indoors, sip some tea, and admire the flowers...<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
It's hard to deny this wasn't a flawless plan, but I've had and still am having fun doing this with you.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Indomitable：</span><br>
Why, that's... You really know what to say, Commander.<br>
Are you trying to make me forget my fatigue with some sweet talk?<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
If it's working, sure.<br>
<br>
After pedalling for a while, as we fall into a steady rhythm together, it dawns on me that we've made quite a bit of progress.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Indomitable：</span><br>
I'm knackered... Are we there yet, Commander?<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Take a look. The shore is right over there.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Indomitable：</span><br>
Is it? It still looks so far away to me...<br>
That said, suddenly I feel like I wouldn't mind simply floating on this lake with you forever...<br>

6 Surprising Decision<br>
Port Park - Artificial Lake<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Indomitable：</span><br>
At last, we've reached the shore...<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
We're going to the park market next, right?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Indomitable：</span><br>
Huh? We don't need to stick to the plan that strictly.<br>
I think we should, umm, squeeze in a break right here...<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Then let's head to the market and find a place to relax. Better than standing in the wind out here.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Indomitable：</span><br>
Alright. May I ask you to lead the way, then?<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Sure – but why are you walking so slowly?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Indomitable：</span><br>
Because even convincing myself to move takes quite a lot of effort... Please don't tease me.<br>
<br>
Her tone spells it out clear as day: "I don't want to move another inch." This is in spite of the fact that this whole outing was her idea.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
I'll go on ahead. Just follow me at a comfortable pace.<br>
The map says the market should be pretty close.<br>
...And by that I mean we're already here.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Indomitable：</span><br>
Come again? This is the market?<br>
It's quite a lot smaller than I had imagined.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Yep. There are two or three stalls and that's it.<br>
<br>
A handful of simple stalls line the sides of the road, and there's not an iota of liveliness in the air.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Indomitable：</span><br>
Oh well – I wasn't expecting much in the first place.<br>
This isn't all that bad, really. We can tour the entire market in just a few steps.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Is it just me, or do you sound relieved?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Indomitable：</span><br>
Ah, look, there's a bench over there. Let's have a seat, Commander!<br>
Ahh... Finally, a place to rest my feet...<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Can I ask what's next on the itinerary?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Indomitable：</span><br>
Well, the plan was to have a lavish dinner after we'd toured all the stalls.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
It's a little bit early for dinner, methinks.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Indomitable：</span><br>
True. I'm not even hungry, for that matter.<br>
Furthermore, a lavish dinner means sitting for a long time... Just thinking about it makes me feel knackered.<br>
<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项1：How about a walk around the park?</span>'''''<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项2：Wanna go back to the port?</span>'''''<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项1）</span>'''''How about a walk around the park? That should get your blood pumping.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Indomitable：</span><br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项1）</span>'''''A bloody walk?!<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项1）</span>'''''Ahem... I can't move one more step...<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项2）</span>'''''We can always head back to the port for a bit if you want.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Indomitable：</span><br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项2）</span>'''''Ah, yes... I'll admit I'm pining for the comfort of my own bed.<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项2）</span>'''''The issue with that, however, is that we'd need to go outside come dinnertime, wouldn't we?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Indomitable：</span><br>
What to do, what to do...<br>
All the cells in my body have gone on strike – I can't even think properly anymore...<br>
<br>
She leans in and rests her head on my shoulder.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Indomitable：</span><br>
I'll think about it after a quick rest.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
There IS the option of returning to the port and just not going out again.<br>
We can order takeout to the room. Doesn't that sound much better?<br>
<br>
Her expression relaxes in the blink of an eye. My idea must sound like a godsend to her.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Indomitable：</span><br>
Yes, let's do that!<br>
I can always count on you to make a swift decision.<br>
<br>
Despite the enthusiasm in her voice, she's still leaning against me and doesn't seem inclined in the least to get up.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Indomitable：</span><br>
I really can't walk another step... Ugh...<br>
Please, Commander, carry me back home...<br>

7 Indomitable to the End<br>
One long and eventful journey later, Indomitable and I are finally back in my office. She flops down on the couch, looking somewhat bummed out.<br>
She rubs her forehead with both hands, trying to relieve the fatigue from today's outing.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Indomitable：</span><br>
*sigh*... This plan was a bit of a failure, it seems.<br>
I thought it would be relaxing and low-effort, only to end up drained of all energy.<br>
My head, my arms, my feet – they all hurt... Ow...<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Want me to give you a massage?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Indomitable：</span><br>
I... see no reason to refuse. Yes, please.<br>
<br>
She puts her legs in my lap. I start massaging her calves, applying a modest amount of pressure.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Indomitable：</span><br>
Ohh yes... This is divine.<br>
Forgive me for making you take care of me like this, Commander...<br>
<br>
She slowly withdraws her legs, changes her position, then casually takes my hand and places it on her shoulder.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Indomitable：</span><br>
Could you massage these as well?<br>
Ahh... Yes, that's it...<br>
That feels so good...<br>
<br>
After massaging her for a while, she finally regains enough energy to talk.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Indomitable：</span><br>
It goes without stating that I love spending time with you.<br>
It's just... ideally, spending time with you would involve no physical activity.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
A lot of things didn't go as expected, but in the end, it was a ton of fun.<br>
<br>
She responds with a small nod and closes her eyes, relishing the pleasure of the massage.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Geesh, you really are exhausted.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Indomitable：</span><br>
Yes, and that's why this was a failure...<br>
Come to think of it, aren't you an expert at making plans?<br>
Bugger... I should've let you handle it all along.<br>
While it's too late now, you can still plan for the next time.<br>
<br>
Coming closer, she all but embraces me. It's obvious she's trying to coax me, and yet, it's almost impossible to refuse.<br>
<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项1：Alright. I'll come up with a relaxing plan.</span>'''''<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项2：Alright. I'll come up with a hellish plan.</span>'''''<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项1）</span>'''''Sure, you won't have to exert yourself in the slightest next time.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Indomitable：</span><br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项1）</span>'''''That's what I like to hear. You know me well, Commander.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项2）</span>'''''Alright. I'll make a training regimen we can both keep up with so you can work on your stamina.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Indomitable：</span><br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项2）</span>'''''You should be able to handle such a regimen by yourself, no? I shall be your coach, offering you advice from the comfort of a sofa.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
At any rate, that's for another time. More immediately – what do you want to eat?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Indomitable：</span><br>
Must I exert my brain again? Ugh...<br>
<br>
With a languid motion, she moves her body and mutters a response.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Indomitable：</span><br>
Seeing as you'll be devising the plans for next time, why not get into the planning mindset with this?<br>
Which is to say... I leave the dinner menu up to you.<br>
Don't worry, I don't have any requirements. Please just choose whatever you like.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
You're kind of pushing all the work onto me.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Indomitable：</span><br>
I'm simply saying that the more capable one between us should take on more responsibilities.<br>
As thanks for your hard work, I'll return this gesture and give you a massage now.<br>
<br>
She calls it a "massage," but really, she's just lackadaisically kneading my body with her fingers.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Indomitable：</span><br>
Does it feel good?<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Umm...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Indomitable：</span><br>
You know, you're always so reliable, and that puts everyone around you at ease.<br>
So I entrust you to... take care of all the rest... Zzz...<br>
<br>
She dozes off right in the middle of the conversation, leaning softly against me with her hand still resting on my chest.<br>
In the warmth of this moment, all the physical stress of the day turns into a gentle tranquility.<br>
