<span style="color:#ec5d53;">Z2：</span><br>
What a pain. Those Royal Navy reinforcements may be a bit of a handful.<br>
<span style="color:#ec5d53;">Z18：</span><br>
Um... Z2, I think we're way past a handful here.<br>
A battleship and an aircraft carrier are too much for little ol' me.。<br>
When you add in their destroyer escorts...<br>
<span style="color:#ec5d53;">Z2：</span><br>
Even Z18 can't smile at a time like this.<br>
<span style="color:#ec5d53;">Z18：</span><br>
What the?! Am I just a smiley idiot to you...?<br>
Z11, Z21, and Z22 got knocked out of the fight two days ago.<br>
And now that Z13's ambush failed... there's nothing for me to smile about.<br>
<span style="color:#ec5d53;">Z2：</span><br>
Right.<br>
......<br>
<span style="color:#ec5d53;">Z18：</span><br>
Um, Z2, why are you patting my head?<br>
<span style="color:#ec5d53;">Z2：</span><br>
Just let me do this.<br>
If only Z1 were here, she'd give everyone a morale boost. Too bad I don't have her sunny disposition. This is the best I can do.<br>
<span style="color:#ec5d53;">Z18：</span><br>
Thanks. It's okay. You didn't do anything wrong. Actually, I think you're doing great, Z2~<br>
<span style="color:#ec5d53;">Z2：</span><br>
Oh, okay...<br>
<span style="color:#ec5d53;">Z18：</span><br>
Yeah~ You're so nice and warm, I think I can smile again!<br>
<span style="color:#ec5d53;">Z2：</span><br>
I underestimated you...<br>
<span style="color:#ec5d53;">Z18：</span><br>
Hehe. You can't be scared with a big smile on your face. C'mon, Z2, give us a smile!<br>
<span style="color:#ec5d53;">Z2：</span><br>
Okay, I'll psych myself up too.<br>
Everyone, prepare to retreat.<br>

<span style="color:#ec5d53;">Z18：</span><br>
Um... Z9 and Z11 have been following behind us. Z17 is here, and Z12 is over there... but Z19 is still missing.<br>
<span style="color:#ec5d53;">Z2：</span><br>
I gave the order to retreat a half an hour ago. Where is Z19...?<br>
<span style="color:#ec5d53;">Z18：</span><br>
She was still with us when we fought Warspite. Do you think her comms got knocked out?<br>
<span style="color:#ec5d53;">Z2：</span><br>
If that's the case, then she has no idea we're retreating.<br>
And we're almost out of ammunition. What a bother...<br>

<span style="color:#ec5d53;">Hermann Künne (Z19)：</span><br>
Everyone's going the wrong way.<br>
And I never expected the Royal Navy would send such a strong fleet at us.<br>
I better get back in contact with Z2.<br>
<span style="color:#ec5d53;">Communicator：</span><br>
............<br>
<span style="color:#ec5d53;">Hermann Künne (Z19)：</span><br>
Oh no... my comms are broken!<br>
Hrm... I think the original plan was to leave the fjord...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Eskimo ：</span><br>
I finally got you, Iron Blood destroyer!<br>
<span style="color:#ec5d53;">Hermann Künne (Z19)：</span><br>
So fast?!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Eskimo ：</span><br>
I'm not letting you get away~ Tribal-class destroyer Eskimo, attack!<br>
{{折叠面板|内容结束}}

{{折叠面板|标题=Escape|选项=4|主框=1|样式=primary|展开=否}}
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Eskimo ：</span><br>
They got away in the end...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Foxhound：</span><br>
Hey now, don't just go running at the enemy. Are you alright, Eskimo?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Eskimo ：</span><br>
I'm fine~ Looks like they're low on ammo. They're just focused on escaping.<br>
What's next? Did you come to chase them with me, Foxhound?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Foxhound：</span><br>
Isn't our mission to occupy Narvik?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Eskimo ：</span><br>
Ummmm... well... yeah...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Foxhound：</span><br>
Pfft, well, I knew it would turn out like this. I have to go back to Warspite to screen, but she already approved your chase.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Eskimo ：</span><br>
She did?! Really?!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Foxhound：</span><br>
She told me to tell you: "Don't overdo it. Signal if in danger."<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Eskimo ：</span><br>
Alright! Let her know Eskimo said "aye aye!"<br>

{{折叠面板|标题=Starry Fjord|选项=5|主框=1|样式=primary|展开=否}}
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Foxhound：</span><br>
I'm back, Warspite.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Warspite：</span><br>
Any trouble with Eskimo?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Foxhound：</span><br>
Not a scratch on her. She's pursuing the Iron Blood destroyer full steam ahead.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Warspite：</span><br>
Right. Leave the stranded destroyer to Eskimo while we proceed with the mission.<br>
In the name of the Queen, and for Hardy and Hunter, let no one escape!<br>

<span style="color:#ec5d53;">Z18：</span><br>
Z19! There you are! What happened to you?<br>
<span style="color:#ec5d53;">Hermann Künne (Z19)：</span><br>
Is that Z18...? While I was trying to get away from Eskimo, I took some hits from Icarus.<br>
Be careful, they're still after me... is everyone else okay?<br>
<span style="color:#ec5d53;">Z18：</span><br>
Mostly. Z2 is still trying to find us a way out. But the Royal Navy is everywhere, and we're almost out of ammo.<br>
<span style="color:#ec5d53;">Hermann Künne (Z19)：</span><br>
Then I've decided. I'll hold them off. You get back to Z2 and retreat with the others.<br>
<span style="color:#ec5d53;">Z18：</span><br>
What are you talking about?! I've been looking for you for so long!<br>
You're coming with me, Z19!<br>
<span style="color:#ec5d53;">Hermann Künne (Z19)：</span><br>
My drive system is crippled. I can't outrun the Royals.<br>
<span style="color:#ec5d53;">Z18：</span><br>
Then I'll stay and fight with you. I'm not leaving you here!<br>
<span style="color:#ec5d53;">Hermann Künne (Z19)：</span><br>
...Idiot.<br>

<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Eskimo ：</span><br>
Now I've got y- huh? There's so many of them!<br>
<br>
BOOM!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Eskimo ：</span><br>
Woah! Not even a warning!<br>
F-fine! Lemme at 'em!<br>
{{折叠面板|内容结束}}

{{折叠面板|标题=Reinforcements|选项=8|主框=1|样式=primary|展开=否}}
<br>
BOOM!<br>
<span style="color:#ec5d53;">Hermann Künne (Z19)：</span><br>
It's the Royals! Their reinforcements!<br>
<span style="color:#ec5d53;">Z18：</span><br>
No, I think it's our reinforcements! It's Z2!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Eskimo ：</span><br>
H- huh?!<br>
<span style="color:#ec5d53;">Z2：</span><br>
"Leave no man behind." I've always wanted to say that.<br>
But the truth is: we have no way out of this fjord.<br>
<span style="color:#ec5d53;">Hermann Künne (Z19)：</span><br>
So this is how it ends...?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Eskimo ：</span><br>
One, two, three... how's Eskimo gonna get out of this one...?<br>
I have to get word to Warspite!<br>
<span style="color:#ec5d53;">Z2：</span><br>
Are you done? I am Z2. Identify yourself, Royal Navy destroyer.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Eskimo ：</span><br>
Royal Navy Tribal-class Destroyer Eskimo!<br>
<span style="color:#ec5d53;">Z2：</span><br>
What a vigorous response. Are you not afraid?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Eskimo ：</span><br>
Of a f- few Iron Blood destroyers? Not even a little bit!<br>
(I have to stall them until Warspite gets here...!)<br>
<span style="color:#ec5d53;">Z2：</span><br>
Well then, you're going to stay a while with me, until your reinforcements show up.<br>

{{折叠面板|标题=Onwards|选项=9|主框=1|样式=primary|展开=否}}
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Warspite：</span><br>
Z9, Z11... there should be six more Iron Blood destroyers.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Foxhound：</span><br>
I just got the news: all of Iron Blood's shore defenses have been disabled.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Warspite：</span><br>
Grand.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Foxhound：</span><br>
Message from Icarus: we have defeated enemy destroyer Z13 with carrier support!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Warspite：</span><br>
Z13... That means five left.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Foxhound：</span><br>
You seem troubled?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Warspite：</span><br>
Watching the Z-class fight, I can't help but think of Hardy and Hunter.<br>
Any news from Eskimo?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Foxhound：</span><br>
No contact since the report that she was engaging Z19 with Icarus.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Warspite：</span><br>
But Icarus just reported in about Z13? I'm concerned.<br>
Call Eskimo yourself. Get a status report.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Foxhound：</span><br>
Aye aye!<br>

{{折叠面板|标题=Strategy|选项=10|主框=1|样式=primary|展开=否}}
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Foxhound：</span><br>
We've made contact! Eskimo has encountered the main force of Iron Blood destroyers. She has engaged them and requests immediate support!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Warspite：</span><br>
Their main force? Engaging Eskimo on her own...?<br>
What is her position?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Foxhound：</span><br>
In Rombaksfjord.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Warspite：</span><br>
Adjust course, full speed ahead!<br>

<br>
BOOM!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Warspite：</span><br>
Warspite of the Royal Navy, ho!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Eskimo ：</span><br>
Waah! Warspite... you're finally here! (splash)<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Foxhound：</span><br>
Eskimo, are you alright?!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Warspite：</span><br>
What happened to her?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Foxhound：</span><br>
She passed out. Her rigging has taken heavy damage, but we can get it under control.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Warspite：</span><br>
Glad to hear it.<br>
Hear me, Iron Blood! In the name of the Queen, I hereby give you one chance to surrender.<br>
<span style="color:#ec5d53;">Z2：</span><br>
Here they are... Well played, Eskimo.<br>
Warspite, I'm afraid we have no intention of surrendering.<br>
I suppose you came here for Hardy and Hunter.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Warspite：</span><br>
Then you choose to fight?<br>
<span style="color:#ec5d53;">Z2：</span><br>
Yes. The Iron Blood will fight to the last.<br>
Let's give you that proper villainous feeling.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Warspite：</span><br>
I underestimated you.<br>
It is an honour to meet such proud warriors in battle.<br>
Royal Navy, to arms!<br>
{{折叠面板|内容结束}}

{{折叠面板|标题=Reinforcements|选项=12|主框=1|样式=primary|展开=否}}
<span style="color:#ec5d53;">Z2：</span><br>
Of course a destroyer can't challenge a battleship.<br>
<span style="color:#ec5d53;">Z18：</span><br>
Z2, I'm totally out of ammo.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Warspite：</span><br>
It's over, Iron Blood destroyers. You've fought bravely.<br>
<br>
BOOM!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Warspite：</span><br>
Huh? Where did that shot come from?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Foxhound：</span><br>
Iron Blood destroyers Z12 and Z17 engaging from the rear.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Warspite：</span><br>
Hm.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Foxhound：</span><br>
Z2 and Z18 are advancing deeper into the fjord. Should we pursue?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Warspite：</span><br>
This fjord is a dead end, isn't it?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Foxhound：</span><br>
Yes...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Warspite：</span><br>
Then we will deal with Z12 and Z17 first. Do not let them escape.<br>
As for Z2 and Z18, we can give them some time.<br>
Call it a tribute to their bravery.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Foxhound：</span><br>
Roger. Adjusting course to pursue Iron Blood destroyers Z12 and Z17!<br>

<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Eskimo ：</span><br>
Hm... huh?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Warspite：</span><br>
Welcome back to the land of the living, Eskimo!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Eskimo ：</span><br>
What? Warspite? Is the battle over?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Warspite：</span><br>
Not quite. But it will be soon.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Eskimo ：</span><br>
Oh... So Z2 and Z18...?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Warspite：</span><br>
Don't worry about them. You rest up.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Eskimo ：</span><br>
I really tried my hardest this time.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Warspite：</span><br>
Yes, I saw. You fought bravely. Her Majesty the Queen will be most pleased.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Eskimo ：</span><br>
Really? The Queen herself will honour me...? Hehehehe...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Warspite：</span><br>
Every battle we fight is another small step toward ending this war.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Eskimo ：</span><br>
The heavy stuff is beyond me... But I'll do what's right, and I'll do it as hard as I can.<br>
*Yawn*, I'm kinda sleepy though.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Warspite：</span><br>
Rest well. Once you wake up, we'll be on the road back home.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Foxhound：</span><br>
Warspite, Z17 is bearing down on you!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Warspite：</span><br>
Roger. All ahead full. Let's finish this fight!<br>
