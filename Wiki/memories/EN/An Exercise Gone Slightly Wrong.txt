An Exercise Gone Slightly Wrong<br>
<br>
1. A Miscommunication<br>
One day, at the port...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ingraham：</span><br>
Hm? What's up, Commander?<br>
<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项1："I have something for you."</span>'''''<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ingraham：</span><br>
What's this? A mission briefing?<br>
I'm still on vacation, though. You'll have to find someone else.<br>
<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项1："The thing is..."</span>'''''<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ingraham：</span><br>
...The mission's not for me?<br>
So what's this about then? I hope you're not here just to mess with me.<br>
<br>
Ingraham unrolled the sheet of paper and began reading it with a doubtful look.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ingraham：</span><br>
"...Members of the fleet will participate in a combat scenario designed to test their improvisation skills..."<br>
"...There will be no radio contact between participants. The addressee, Bristol of the Allen M. Sumner class, is to link up with the attackers near the abandoned naval facility..."<br>
Ah, I get it now.<br>
<br>
Once Ingraham finished reading the mission briefing, she cocked her head slightly as she looked at me.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ingraham：</span><br>
Bristol hasn't come back yet, and you've got an important meeting to attend soon...<br>
Basically, you want me to send her this on your behalf, am I right?<br>
<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项1："Yes. Sorry for disrupting your vacation..."</span>'''''<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ingraham：</span><br>
Don't sweat it. A few minutes of my time is no big deal.<br>
I'll relay the message right away. You go on and head to your meeting, Commander.<br>
<br>
Ingraham made off for the communications room with a thorough grasp of the mission's outline.<br>
Bristol has a tendency to jump to conclusions. I decided it was best to let her sister, Ingraham, explain the mission to her than try and potentially fail myself.<br>
At any rate, the job was done. I hurried back to my office to prepare for my meeting.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ingraham：</span><br>
Testing, testing. 1, 2, 3... This is Ingraham. Do you hear me, Bristol?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Bristol：</span><br>
Ingraham? Fancy hearing from you outside our regularly scheduled contact times. What's up?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ingraham：</span><br>
Just relaying orders for you. The Commander was in a big rush, so I'm doing it instead.<br>
Ahem... Change of plans. You are to head to the naval base ruins at once and link up with the attackers. I'll send you the coordinates.<br>
There. Did you copy that, Bristol? ...Bristol?<br>
<br>
The only thing Ingraham heard back over the radio was the sound of faint static.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ingraham：</span><br>
Crap. The line must've cut right as she answered. Oh well, I've done my job. Back to enjoying my time off.<br>
<br>
Meanwhile, on the other end of the line...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Bristol：</span><br>
What did you say, Ingraham?<br>
...Hello? Are you still there? Helloooo?<br>
The comms channel closed?! You've got to be kidding me!<br>
Did... Did something happen back at base? Is that why the comms went down?!<br>
I think she said the Commander was in a rush, there's been a change of plans, and that I had to go somewhere at once?<br>
That could only mean... Oh no... The port is under attack and the Commander needs someone to organize the evacuation!<br>
And that someone must be me, because I'm closest to the port! So I need to run back there immediately!<br>
Oh goodness, I'm starting to hyperventilate... Need to calm down!<br>
Breathe in... Breathe out... Breathe in...<br>
Gah, it's not working! I'm getting stressed because I'm wasting time!<br>
My heart's telling me to hurry, but my brain's telling me to radio back and get confirmation before I...<br>
No, what am I saying?! That's a terrible idea!<br>
If the port is under attack, the enemy is without a doubt monitoring our radio channels!<br>
That would explain why there was so much noise over what Ingraham said, too!<br>
Oh geesh... Take it easy, Bristol... Remember your training...!<br>
Okay, so... There's no way she'd send unciphered orders over the radio if she knew someone was listening in...<br>
Which can only mean one thing... That message was some sort of code! Oh my god!<br>
<br>
Bristol unfastened the lantern from her rigging and held it high, lighting up her surroundings... in broad daylight.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Bristol：</span><br>
Whew... The glow of my lantern's helping me calm down.<br>
I should probably hurry to the coordinates she sent me. Let's see here...<br>
...Is this really right? Isn't this the location of that abandoned naval base?<br>
Wait, I get it now! The idea is to gather everyone there, then launch an organized counterattack on the enemy!<br>
Yes, of course! It all makes perfect sense!<br>
All right, time to swooce!<br>

<br>
An Exercise Gone Slightly Wrong<br>
<br>
2. The Investigator Arrives<br>
KABOOOM!<br>
Bristol came under heavy fire from afar the moment she arrived in the area with the ruined naval base.<br>
Her attackers were the opposing exercise team. It's only natural they would target her.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Bristol：</span><br>
S-someone's shooting at me?!<br>
Aw crap! I can't believe this place has fallen too!<br>
What's my damage... Huh? No damage?! Seems they aren't a real threat in that case.<br>
<br>
She was hit numerous times, but suffered not as much as a scratch.<br>
Which is no surprise, given the fleet was firing blanks as part of the exercise. Bristol, however, had no way of knowing this at the time.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Bristol：</span><br>
I've got to stay calm! First thing's first, I have to find something to hide behind!<br>
<br>
She took a quick look around and spotted an abandoned base. She sailed towards it while firing back at the opponents.<br>
The base was barren and lonesome. Despite the daytime sun's glow, it inspired a melancholic mood.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Bristol：</span><br>
Lights... on!<br>
Whew... Helps calm my nerves.<br>
If the enemy's advanced all the way out here, our hopes of turning the tables look pretty bleak...<br>
But if things are this bad, why did Ingraham radio me just earlier...?<br>
I can't even investigate what's going on here when I don't have any leads...<br>
<br>
Bristol began thinking. Just then, a cold wind blew against her body, sending a shiver through it. She listened close, and seemed to hear a voice carried by the wind.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">？？？：</span><br>
...stol...<br>
Bris...tol... I've been looking for you...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Bristol：</span><br>
EEK!<br>
...Wh-whoever you are, I'm not scared of you! But I know better than to talk to strangers, so go away!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">？？？：</span><br>
Bristol... c'mon...<br>
<br>
The voice got closer and clearer until eventually, its source came into view.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Bristol：</span><br>
Wh-who's there?!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Allen M. Sumner：</span><br>
It's me, dummy! Allen! What's the matter? Didya get hit on the head with a blank or something?<br>
Also, didn't you get the memo? The attackers have moved to a new location, so we should reposition too.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Bristol：</span><br>
Oh yeah? Out of all the stickers on your rigging, which one represents the Commander?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Allen M. Sumner：</span><br>
...What?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Bristol：</span><br>
I knew it! You're not Allen, you're just an impostor!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Allen M. Sumner：</span><br>
What are you talking about?! I don't under–<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Bristol：</span><br>
Begone, doppelganger! You don't belong in this world! Leave me and my friends alone!<br>
<br>
Bristol chanted a series of incoherent spells at the top of her lungs, then ran inside the base, shrouded in darkness.<br>
Some time later, Ingraham received a status update from the fleet participating in the exercise.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ingraham：</span><br>
...An unidentified ship came into the area and fired warning shots at you?<br>
There's no way an enemy could appear out of the blue this close to port... Unless... Yeah, that's got to be Bristol.<br>
She just got back from an excursion and needs some time to adjust, I reckon.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Allen M. Sumner：</span><br>
Thing is, I met her at the old ruins earlier. I tried to talk to her, but she yelled weird stuff back at me then ran off.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ingraham：</span><br>
What did she say, exactly?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Allen M. Sumner：</span><br>
Uhh... The gist of it was, "leave me alone."<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ingraham：</span><br>
Geesh... She must be really bummed out. Maybe she wants us to suspend the exercise for her sake.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Allen M. Sumner：</span><br>
She could've just said it if so... I'll go ask the Commander about that.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ingraham：</span><br>
...<br>
(What the heck's up with Bristol? I told her to link up with the attackers, but instead she's acting independently.)<br>
......<br>
(Wait... What if she didn't get those orders because of the radio static?)<br>
.........<br>
(Then I've gotta find her and make doubly sure she gets them this time!)<br>

An Exercise Gone Slightly Wrong<br>
<br>
3. Code Speak<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Bristol：</span><br>
Is it just me, or are there more enemies here now?!<br>
That's a bad sign... I hope everyone back at port is okay...<br>
<br>
KABOOOM!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Bristol：</span><br>
I can't hide here forever... My only hope is to call others who were out of port before the attack and ask for backup.<br>
But... I can't do that since our comms have been compromised! It's too risky!<br>
I guess I just... have to improvise some sort of code and hope they'll be able to figure out the message...<br>
Ahem... This is Investigator. Agency, come in.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Communicator：</span><br>
......<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Bristol：</span><br>
Why won't it connect?!<br>
They must be jamming us... Oh man, I really hope everyone's okay...<br>
Hang on... Ingraham's channel worked earlier! Let's see if I can contact her!<br>
This is Investigator! Come in, Ingraham!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ingraham：</span><br>
Bristol? Where are you now?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Bristol：</span><br>
Err, just listen closely to what I'm about to say! Weather was all clear until I got here, when it suddenly started pouring down!<br>
I'm in need of some umbrellas. Could you send some my way?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ingraham：</span><br>
What're you talking about? It's not raining over there.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Bristol：</span><br>
(She doesn't get it! Dang it... How do I make it clear what I'm trying to say? Maybe she'll understand if I put stress on it?)<br>
Look, what I'm trying to say is...<br>
I need UMBRELLAS right now! The rainfall is overwhelming!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ingraham：</span><br>
Why do you need umbrellas when it's sunny? Look, if a squall comes in or something like that, just find shelter in the ruins and wait for it to pass.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Bristol：</span><br>
Wait for it to pass...?<br>
(Oh, I get it! She's saying reinforcements are coming and I just need to hold out a little longer!)<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ingraham：</span><br>
Mhm. Now listen, I just wanna make sure you got–<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Bristol：</span><br>
Copy that loud and clear! Investigator, out!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ingraham：</span><br>
What? Wait–<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Bristol：</span><br>
The line sounded really choppy... Things must be really bad back at port. I doubt backup will be here any time soon if I do hold out here...<br>
But maybe, just maybe, things will be okay if I stop the enemy from taking these ruins...?<br>
<br>
Bristol took out her little notebook and began to write.<br>
"Investigator's Log - Clear skies (but it's raining in my heart). The port is under attack and the future is uncertain."<br>
"I've been told to make my last stand at the old ruins... I pray my friends are okay."<br>

An Exercise Gone Slightly Wrong<br>
<br>
4. Bristol with the Master Plan<br>
Allen relayed orders for the exercise fleet to cease fire. Bristol saw this quiet time as an opportunity to execute a plan she hatched.<br>
A plan inspired by a movie she watched once. Using parts scavenged from inside the abandoned base, she built and laid traps all around the area.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Bristol：</span><br>
Tripwires and booby traps are all set. Perfect! I'd like to see them get through this!<br>
All I have to do now is lie and wait...<br>
<br>
Exercise area - Abandoned naval base<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Allen M. Sumner：</span><br>
Ingraham? Why're you here? Weren't you taking some time off?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ingraham：</span><br>
Just... scoping out the situation. How's the exercise going?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Allen M. Sumner：</span><br>
It's on hold for now, per the Commander's orders, until we get to the bottom of the weird occurrences that've been happening.<br>
And believe it or not, things have only gotten weirder since they first began...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ingraham：</span><br>
Let me guess: Bristol asked you to bring umbrellas 'cause it started raining?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Allen M. Sumner：</span><br>
...No? There's not been a drop of rain the whole day. Why would she need umbrellas?<br>
Y'know what, never mind. As I was gonna say: the others told me they've had weird things happen while passing by this abandoned base.<br>
Things like paint buckets being hurled at 'em, floor tiles that spray water at you when stepped on, and weirdest of all... eerie wailing.<br>
Almost makes me think this place is haunted. Maybe that's got something to do with why Bristol was acting strange when I saw her.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ingraham：</span><br>
Haunted? Please. Nothing unusual's happened the thousand other times we've been here.<br>
Anyway, is the Commander around?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Allen M. Sumner：</span><br>
Nope. Had to go straight into another meeting, apparently.<br>
The Commander's radio channel is open though. Want me to patch you through?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ingraham：</span><br>
Nah, no need.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Allen M. Sumner：</span><br>
All righty then. Now if you'll excuse me, I've gotta run an errand! Have a good rest-of-the-day off!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ingraham：</span><br>
To think they actually put the exercise on hold... I wonder what's causing these "weird occurrences."<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Cooper：</span><br>
Occurrences? What'd I miss?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ingraham：</span><br>
Cooper? When'd you get here?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Cooper：</span><br>
I've been here all along! I'm part of the exercise fleet, y'know.<br>
Been meaning to ask: was it you who told Bristol to head here?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ingraham：</span><br>
Yup. Not sure she got the message though. There were some technical difficulties with our comms.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Cooper：</span><br>
Hah, so I was right on the money.<br>
Seems that little miscommunication led Bristol to hole up here and cause us all a big headache.<br>
I'm gonna go in and catch the troublemaker. Meanwhile, you should probably start thinking about the formal explanation you'll be writing soon.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ingraham：</span><br>
*sigh*... There goes the rest of my day off...<br>
<br>
It was this exact moment when Ingraham's brief period of R&R came to an end.<br>

An Exercise Gone Slightly Wrong<br>
<br>
5. Clearing the Confusion<br>
Exercise area - Inside the abandoned base<br>
Cooper and Ingraham entered the dark base and headed for their target.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Cooper：</span><br>
Lights... on!<br>
Geesh... Look at this place. It's chock full of traps.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ingraham：</span><br>
Feels vaguely like the set of a horror movie. All that's missing is a puppet on a tricycle...<br>
Anyway, move slowly and keep an eye out so you don't trip any of them.<br>
Seen any signs of Bristol yet?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Cooper：</span><br>
Hang on, I'm looking... Oh! There she is!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Bristol：</span><br>
*gulp*!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Cooper：</span><br>
Wait! Don't run!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Bristol：</span><br>
Go away, fakes! The person you're looking for isn't here!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Cooper：</span><br>
Calm down, Bristol! Tell me what happened!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Bristol：</span><br>
You're... You're the real Cooper?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Cooper：</span><br>
Yeah, it's me!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Bristol：</span><br>
Oh, thank goodness... I was so sure I was the only one left!<br>
Have you returned to port? What's the situation there?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Cooper：</span><br>
No, not yet. Why do you ask? And what do you mean you thought you were "the only one left?"<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Bristol：</span><br>
It's awful... The port came under attack! It came so suddenly nobody had time to evacuate!<br>
I think something happened to the Commander... I tried to radio the port, but the enemy's jamming our channels...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Cooper：</span><br>
I see... That sounds pretty bad.<br>
(So all this really did happen 'cause of radiowave jank... Ingraham really should've just called her again.)<br>
Then uh, why are you here now, exactly?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Bristol：</span><br>
I got orders to regroup with the others here so we reclaim the port, and then the enemy launched an assault on this place!<br>
Now they're surrounding us! My traps have been going off nonstop!<br>
Not to toot my own horn, but the only reason this place is still standing is because of my quick thinking!<br>
Anyway, I have to defend this place to the end, no matter what... Those are the final orders I got.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Cooper：</span><br>
I... see...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Bristol：</span><br>
Everything will be all right if I just do that. I mean, you showing up is proof that it's working!<br>
And more people are bound to show up! Then once we have a sizable force, we'll strike back at the enemy and reclaim the port!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ingraham：</span><br>
What? You've made it your mission to defend this old place?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Bristol：</span><br>
Ingraham! Thank gosh our radios are working again! How's it going back at port? Are you all okay?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ingraham：</span><br>
Uhh... Yeah, I'm fine and everything's all good. Could you explain why you decided to hunker down in there?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Bristol：</span><br>
I mean, isn't that obvious? You're the one who told me to find shelter in the ruins and wait for the rain to pass!<br>
When I said "it started pouring down," that was code for "the enemy's attacking." And when I asked for umbrellas, what I really meant was reinforcements!<br>
And since you couldn't send those, I took what you said to mean "hold the line and wait until we come for you"! That's what you meant, right?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ingraham：</span><br>
You've got to be kidding...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Bristol：</span><br>
Of course not! It's because you used code from the moment you contacted me that I managed to figure out the gravity of the situation so quickly and work out a plan!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Cooper：</span><br>
Wow... Talk about jumping to some ridiculous conclusions.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ingraham：</span><br>
*sigh*... Another thing to add to my explanation. I'm gonna hang up now.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Bristol：</span><br>
Huh? What do you mean I jumped to conclusions?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Cooper：</span><br>
Well... Let me explain.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Bristol：</span><br>
Ugh, it feels like my world just got turned upside-down...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Cooper：</span><br>
Makes sense, since you had it so wrong all this time.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Bristol：</span><br>
So when I met Allen earlier... That was really her?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Cooper：</span><br>
Ding-ding.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Bristol：</span><br>
And the people who set off my traps...?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Cooper：</span><br>
Shipgirls passing through the area after the exercise got halted, I think.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Bristol：</span><br>
Oh no! So I've just caused a ton of trouble for a lot of people!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Cooper：</span><br>
Hey, it's all right. Nobody's mad at you.<br>
If anyone's to blame, it's Ingraham. And her punishment is the formal explanation she's busy writing right now, heh.<br>
Now come on, let's go home. Later we'll compose a report to log all the info pertaining to this case.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Bristol：</span><br>
Did you say... case? Count me in!<br>
<br>
The next day, a report titled "Case Report on Yesterday's Exercise" found its way to the Commander's desk.<br>
"...What shipgirls fear, more than anything else, is the notion of facing the unknown..."<br>
"...An adversary lies deep in slumber inside that abandoned base, waiting for a visit it has long dreamed of..."<br>
"...One day, the stars will align and the port shall finally learn the truth..."<br>
"For more info, read the supplemental report written by Ingraham (Editor: Allen M. Sumner)."<br>
<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项1："I'd probably take psychic damage if I read that..."</span>'''''<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项2："Ignorance is bliss. Let's not read that..."</span>'''''<br>
<br>
Whether because of – or in spite of – the minor incident during the exercise, the results proved... interesting.<br>
