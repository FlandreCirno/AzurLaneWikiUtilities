Giving Up Command<br>
Zoo - Entrance<br>
After a period of overwork, I'm freed from documents and meetings for a rare day of free time.<br>
I'd planned to do nothing and relax, but Chapayev invited me to the zoo, and I couldn't turn her down.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
(Some of those documents still need final touches. When I get back later...)<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Chapayev：</span><br>
Commander~ You're not thinking of work right now, are you?<br>
<br>
I shake off those dark thoughts and realize that her blue eyes are focused on me rather than the animals.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
No...?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Chapayev：</span><br>
Oh? You looked awfully lost in thought. Heehee, let me guess.<br>
Are you thinking about time? About the idea of using your one and only day off to make your work even more efficient?<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
I'm sorry. It's hard not to...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Chapayev：</span><br>
Is it? Well, Commander, you have to resist it. Your time is mine today, and I'd like you focused on me.<br>
<br>
With that, she snatches the map out of my hand, gazes at it for a moment, and closes it with a smile.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Chapayev：</span><br>
Allow me to chart our course.<br>
If you'd like... I could even take the lead all day?<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Be my guest.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Chapayev：</span><br>
Oh? You'd give up authority to me so easily? It's almost unbelievable.<br>
Heehee, beg enough, and I might give it back.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Ahem... No, it's fine. I trust you, Chapayev.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Chapayev：</span><br>
Really? I'm almost disappointed. Here I thought I'd finally get to hear you beg...<br>
Let me be clear: I want you to enjoy our date today as best you can.<br>
If you find your mind wandering toward work again, I'll drag it back. Even if it means using force.<br>
<br>
Chapayev tugs on my collar, not too hard yet not gently either, with her slender fingers. It's not aggressive – more suggestive, perhaps.<br>
<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项1：(Express your excitement.)</span>'''''<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项2：(Question that last part.)</span>'''''<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项1）</span>'''''Yeah. I'm excited to let go of work and have fun with you.<br>
<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项1）</span>'''''She leans against me and looks up with happy eyes. I can tell she expected those exact words.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Chapayev：</span><br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项1）</span>'''''Heehee. Much better.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项2）</span>'''''(Question that last part.)<br>
<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项2）</span>'''''Her smile deepens, and her grasp on my collar tightens just a little.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Chapayev：</span><br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项2）</span>'''''For example... I could make it so that you can't leave my side? And I do mean physically... Heehee.<br>
<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项2）</span>'''''She says it gently and sweetly, but part of me thinks she's being serious.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Did you have this all planned out?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Chapayev：</span><br>
Heehee. It's my day with you, Commander. I'm sure you've braced yourself for what you know will come.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Well... I have given you authority over the date. So, where are we going next?<br>
<br>
She looks down at the map intently. The light shining through the trees illuminates her profile, and her bangs blow slightly in the wind. The whole sight makes her look softer than ever.<br>
After a while, she points at the Polar Habitat. Its title on the map has a cute drawing of a penguin next to it.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Chapayev：</span><br>
How about the Polar Habitat? We Northern Parliament girls tend to feel an affinity for animals that live in the cold.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
So you like penguins, huh?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Chapayev：</span><br>
"Appreciate" might be a more apt word.<br>
Penguins are such loyal creatures. Once they find a life partner, they never leave. I think that's admirable.<br>
What about you, Commander? Are you loyal?<br>
<br>
Her eyes linger on me for a moment before she looks away and giggles.<br>
Before I can formulate an answer, she takes my hand and leads me forth.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Chapayev：</span><br>
There's no need to rush. Our date's just begun♪<br>

<br>
Loyalty and Possessiveness<br>
Zoo - Polar Habitat<br>
When we get to the exhibit, chilly air touches my cheeks, taking all of the heat and tension out of me.<br>
Through the glass I see a flock of penguins. They sway, cuddle, and waddle leisurely about, leaving little footprints in the snow.<br>
The breeding area is particularly lively. In small, fenced-off areas, penguin couples warm their eggs. There are also some fuzzy little chicks snuggling in for warmth and chirping for attention.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Chapayev：</span><br>
Doesn't it sound like fun? Always in pairs, inseparable for even a moment...<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
It's like they're possessive of each other. Is that what you like about them, Chapayev?<br>
<br>
I tease her while we watch the penguins in love.<br>
She slowly turns to me. Her blue eyes are emphasized in the cold air, and her grin seems to deepen.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Chapayev：</span><br>
Maybe. Don't we all want things just for ourselves? Particularly... our lovers?<br>
<br>
That last word comes out like a sigh. It seems probing, though it's hard to see what she's after.<br>
<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项1：(Ask what she's getting at.)</span>'''''<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项2：(Point out her use of "lovers.")</span>'''''<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项1）</span>'''''(Ask what she's getting at.)<br>
<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项1）</span>'''''Her lips curl up into a meaningful smile.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Chapayev：</span><br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项1）</span>'''''Hmm, is there? Since you asked so directly, maybe I should say it outright.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项2）</span>'''''(Point out her use of "lovers.")<br>
<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项2）</span>'''''She giggles, leans on me again, and returns her attention to the penguins.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Chapayev：</span><br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项2）</span>'''''I just said what came to mind. Have you never felt the same way?<br>
<br>
There's a short moment of silence. Chapayev gazes at a loving penguin couple before turning and snuggling into me.<br>
Her movements are so gentle and natural that, before I know it, I'm hugging her back.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Chapayev：</span><br>
Commander, wouldn't you say... that we're a lot like those penguins?<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Are you imitating them?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Chapayev：</span><br>
Yep♪ Snuggling close to you is relaxing.<br>
It's like animal instinct. Nobody tells them to do it, but they naturally find out how to reassure themselves and each other.<br>
And I think your arms... are the most reassuring place for me to be♪<br>
<br>
Her voice is filled with immense satisfaction.<br>
I subconsciously relax alongside her and enjoy the intimacy of the moment.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Chapayev：</span><br>
Penguins can't communicate as well as we can, but they understand each other.<br>
Forever inseparable... Heehee, is that too clingy for you, Commander?<br>
<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项1：That's how I like it.</span>'''''<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项2：People and penguins aren't the same.</span>'''''<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项1）</span>'''''Love is fostered by togetherness, so I prefer it that way.<br>
<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项1）</span>'''''She raises an eyebrow and grins at me.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Chapayev：</span><br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项1）</span>'''''Heehee... I'll remember that.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项2）</span>'''''People and penguins aren't the same.<br>
<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项2）</span>'''''When she hears my answer, she seems oddly fascinated.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Chapayev：</span><br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项2）</span>'''''Oh, really? If only we could be as simple as them.<br>
<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项2）</span>'''''Without another word, she turns to look for something.<br>
<br>
After a quick glance at me, her eyes finally stop on a nearby sign.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Chapayev：</span><br>
Okay, that's enough of a break. Back to our date~<br>
<br>
She suddenly leaves my arms and takes a step away. Then, she turns and offers me her hand.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Chapayev：</span><br>
The interactive area will be even more fun. Don't you want to see these adorable animals up close and personal, Commander?<br>
<br>
The penguins watch on curiously as I take her hand and walk along with her.<br>

<br>
Gift of the Penguins<br>
Zoo - Polar Habitat<br>
The interactive area of the Polar Habitat has no glass barriers, allowing us to get close to the penguins.<br>
A few of them waddle closer, looking up at their new visitors with abundant curiosity.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Chapayev：</span><br>
They're interested in you, Commander.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
I bet they're looking forward to me feeding them.<br>
<br>
We put on gloves and pick up a bucket of small fish to feed the penguins.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Chapayev：</span><br>
Watch this. I'm an old hand at taming naughty animals♪<br>
<br>
Right on cue, the penguins gather around her at once. But she doesn't feed them – instead, she raises the bucket out of reach and smirks.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Chapayev：</span><br>
If you want snacks, you have to learn to beg.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
I don't think the penguins will understand that...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Chapayev：</span><br>
But you did, didn't you? Heehee, show us all what a capable master you are.<br>
<br>
Chapayev offers me the bucket and watches expectantly.<br>
I experimentally remove a fish, and the penguins rush me with mouths open wide. For now, I just put it into one of their mouths.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Chapayev：</span><br>
You're spoiling them. You have to make it clear which one of you is in charge.<br>
<br>
She takes another fish out of the bucket and throws it far away, causing the penguins to waddle-stampede over at it.<br>
One manages to catch the fish, stretching out its neck to swallow it before bobbing its head in satisfaction.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Chapayev：</span><br>
Very good♪<br>
<br>
While the fight for the fish continues, one male penguin ignores the food and stares fixedly at a female.<br>
Then, he picks up a smooth stone and places it in front of her.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Hmm...?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Chapayev：</span><br>
Heehee, we've been blessed with a rare sight.<br>
That's a courtship signal.<br>
Penguins give carefully selected stones as gifts to prospective partners.<br>
Isn't that just romantic?<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Sure is. I hope he wins the girl.<br>
<br>
After that, the female picks up the stone and takes it back to her nest.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
So... She accepted it?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Chapayev：</span><br>
That's right. She judged him a reliable mate.<br>
It's just an interaction between penguins, and yet...<br>
Part of me envies them.<br>
When will I get my own stone, I wonder?<br>
Well, Commander?<br>
<br>
She makes it sound like banter, but her blue eyes sparkle expectantly as she waits for my reply.<br>
<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项1：Is a stone all you want?</span>'''''<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项2：You want me to give you a rock...?</span>'''''<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项1）</span>'''''Surely you want more than a silly rock...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Chapayev：</span><br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项1）</span>'''''Not at all! Love can be found in the little things.<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项1）</span>'''''If you gave me a stone, I would cherish it.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项2）</span>'''''You want me to give you a rock...?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Chapayev：</span><br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项2）</span>'''''My, Commander, do you think I'm joking?<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项2）</span>'''''Of course I want a present from my special someone.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Chapayev：</span><br>
If you're too embarrassed to do it, I'll gladly take the initiative.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
The initiative? What, you'll give ME a rock?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Chapayev：</span><br>
Heehee. A rock, hm...?<br>
<br>
She giggles and traces her index finger over my lips, down my neck, and to my chest.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Chapayev：</span><br>
I won't stop there.<br>
I want to give you... something that you'll never forget.<br>
It'd be more fun if it was a surprise, don't you think?<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
I guess, but don't go too far, okay?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Chapayev：</span><br>
Heehee. Desire and expectation really do add spice to the excitement.<br>
Expectation is a great emotion, especially when it's directed toward your desire.<br>
What do you desire, Commander? I'm sure it won't be hard for me to guess♪<br>

Held Hostage<br>
Zoo - Polar Habitat<br>
After we'd finished feeding, the penguins lost all interest in us and just milled about. It was getting time for us to leave.<br>
Just as I turned to do so, though, something pulled at my pants suddenly. A penguin had grabbed on with its beak, with a surprisingly steadfast look in its eye.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Hm?<br>
Uh... Does it want something from me?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Chapayev：</span><br>
I think it wants you to stay.<br>
Heehee, even penguins can't resist your charms!<br>
<br>
I try to walk again, but the bird stands firm and even begins beating my leg with a wing, as if trying to warn me against making any sudden moves.<br>
The other penguins notice the hostage situation. Some watch curiously, and some approach to help this one out.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Well. I guess I'm a hostage now.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Chapayev：</span><br>
Hostage? Don't be silly. Maybe they just want you to be their friend.<br>
<br>
Instead of helping me, Chapayev crosses her arms and watches in fascination.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Not gonna help?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Chapayev：</span><br>
Heehee. Isn't this the perfect time to show your diplomacy skills?<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
You monster...<br>
<br>
I sigh, squat down, and try negotiating with the stubborn bird.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
I can't walk like this, buddy. I really need to go.<br>
<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项1：(Try to save yourself with food.)</span>'''''<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项2：(Threaten to use force.)</span>'''''<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项1）</span>'''''(Try to save yourself with food.)<br>
<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项1）</span>'''''The penguin cocks its head, as if considering the trade.<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项1）</span>'''''However, it flaps its wings again in refusal. I doubt it'll be that easy to win a compromise.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Chapayev：</span><br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项1）</span>'''''Your bribery is coming off as insincere, methinks. Heehee!<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项2）</span>'''''(Threaten to use force.)<br>
<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项2）</span>'''''Despite my threats, the penguin tightens its grip. It seems determined to keep me here.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Chapayev：</span><br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项2）</span>'''''I won't say that's not an option, Commander, but try not to ruin your pants.<br>
<br>
The stalemate continues on until Chapayev bends down and gently pets the bird.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Chapayev：</span><br>
There, there~ Don't bully the Commander, now.<br>
<br>
She coos gently, soothing my captor.<br>
It's then that the penguin finally lets go, looks up at her, and chirps softly before backing off.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
So it listens to you, huh?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Chapayev：</span><br>
Maybe because I fed it a moment ago.<br>
<br>
I stand up, relieved to be free again, but I'm interrupted by an unexpected attack.<br>
The penguin leaps into a nearby pool, splashing water everywhere... and soaking me.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Ugh...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Chapayev：</span><br>
I think it still wanted revenge on you♪<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
What a... friendly little guy.<br>
I need a change of clothes now.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Chapayev：</span><br>
Hmm... The map says there's a gift shop the next room over.<br>
I bet they sell nice souvenir clothes!<br>
Goodness, now I get to dress you up... What an exciting opportunity to see you in new clothes.<br>
I owe that penguin my thanks!<br>
<br>
She giggles, apparently looking forward to playing "dress-up."<br>
I sigh and make my way to the gift shop. Chapayev's practically giddy from this turn of events.<br>

<br>
A Fashion Crisis<br>
Animal-related products line the shelves of the gift shop.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Chapayev：</span><br>
A polar bear onesie, or a hoodie with a shark fin... Which one do you like more, Commander?<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Do they have anything less... cute?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Chapayev：</span><br>
It's a zoo, Commander. Do you expect them to have tactical gear, or something?<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
No, but something more low-key would be appreciated.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Chapayev：</span><br>
You don't like being cute? I think they're perfect for a comfy day off. And best of all, they'll turn heads!<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
I can't walk around in those...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Chapayev：</span><br>
Okay. So you prefer serious and low-key, I see.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Not necessarily. I just don't want to deviate from my usual image too much.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Chapayev：</span><br>
Usual image, hmm? But from whose perspective? Everyone else's? Or one specific person's?♪<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Doesn't matter. Normal clothes, please.<br>
<br>
I look around and eventually choose a black and white outfit. It does have a penguin pattern, yes, but it's not TOO ridiculously conspicuous.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Chapayev：</span><br>
You really did choose the plainest one.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
This is fine for now. It's more like me.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Chapayev：</span><br>
Really? I wonder if you don't know your style as well as you think you do.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
What does that mean?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Chapayev：</span><br>
Heehee, don't worry. I'll prove it before long.<br>
<br>
I pay, take the outfit to the dressing room, and put it on in favor of my soaking-wet top.<br>
When I exit, Chapayev is already waiting by the gift shop entrance. I notice her pocket is bulging.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Did you buy something?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Chapayev：</span><br>
It's a secret.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
That just makes me more curious...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Chapayev：</span><br>
Heehee. If you must know, then wait until we get back, okay?<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Do you enjoy keeping me in suspense?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Chapayev：</span><br>
Not at all.<br>
A surprise is more fun when it comes at the right time, don't you think?<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Okay, then. I'll just assume you bought it for me, then.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Chapayev：</span><br>
Ah. Commander, your collar–<br>
<br>
She reaches up to my collar. A cold chill runs through my skin when her fingertips brush against my neck.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Very smooth change of subject there.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Chapayev：</span><br>
Do you want to know that badly?<br>
If you do... Heehee, all you have to do is search me.<br>
I'm happy to let you do it any time.<br>
<br>
She takes my hand and presses it against her chest. The softness and her rhythmical heartbeat make me hesitate, but I manage to pull my hand away.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Maybe when we get back.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Chapayev：</span><br>
I'll consider that a promise♪<br>

Late-Night Farewells<br>
Port - Pier<br>
After our fun at the zoo, we return to the port as the moon rises overhead.<br>
The sea breeze is cool and humid. Chapayev walks slowly, seemingly trying to buy time.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Can't help but notice you're a little clingy today...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Chapayev：</span><br>
Aww. Do you not like that?<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
That's not it. I just feel like you're acting different from the usual, is all.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Chapayev：</span><br>
Maybe you don't recognize what's "usual" for me? Given how deeply you immerse yourself in work all the time.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
I doubt that...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Chapayev：</span><br>
Well, I don't. I recognize that furrowed brow of yours.<br>
You look like that when you're thinking of what work you'll be doing when you get back. I don't like it.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Sorry. I just realized I have leftover work...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Chapayev：</span><br>
That's exactly what I mean. Your work has tamed you.<br>
I have to escort you home myself, or else I know you'll be consumed by work again.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Hahaha... Here is fine. You go back to your place, okay?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Chapayev：</span><br>
Oh? I'm right, aren't I? You don't want me to know that you're going straight back to work.<br>
Or maybe... are you worried something "unexpected" might happen if I go all the way with you?<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
The thought never entered my mind.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Chapayev：</span><br>
Despite you saying that you might search me later?<br>
You're not going to let me off that easily, are you?<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Oh. So you remember that...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Chapayev：</span><br>
I'd never forget such an offer.<br>
Anyway, let me take you to your office. I'm going to hold you to it♪<br>
<br>
She bulls her way through, so I sigh, shake my head, and go to my office.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Chapayev：</span><br>
Heheh, you folded so easily... I think you were looking forward to this.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
No, I wasn't...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Chapayev：</span><br>
You don't look very conflicted about it to me.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Chapayev：</span><br>
It's not like you to get embarrassed this easily.<br>
<br>
Chapayev turns to me, apparently enjoying the sight of me, as she walks by my side.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Chapayev：</span><br>
Was today fun for you?<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Yeah. Much more fun than paperwork, for sure.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Chapayev：</span><br>
So it was half a success, then.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Half?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Chapayev：</span><br>
Having you get used to me so that you'll spend more time with me, I mean.<br>
<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项1：Getting used to you...</span>'''''<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项2：You're unusually straightforward.</span>'''''<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项1）</span>'''''Getting used to you...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Chapayev：</span><br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项1）</span>'''''Good. Then you wouldn't be able to escape me even if you wanted to.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项2）</span>'''''You're unusually straightforward.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Chapayev：</span><br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项2）</span>'''''Heehee. I just wanted to see how much I could make you blush♪<br>
<br>
Port - Office<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Here we are.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Chapayev：</span><br>
So I've escorted you. Now...<br>
<br>
She stops in front of the door, gazes at the knob for a moment, and then looks back at me.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Now...?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Chapayev：</span><br>
You remember the present I got for you, don't you?<br>

Proof that You're Mine<br>
Port - Office<br>
I close the door and turn to Chapayev. She's leaning against my desk and smiling expectantly at me.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Now can you tell me about this present of yours?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Chapayev：</span><br>
Wow, how forward you are behind closed doors.<br>
Or are you at the limit of your restraint?<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
So you want the pat-down after all, huh?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Chapayev：</span><br>
Heehee. That was the promise.<br>
How do you plan to do it? Where will you begin?<br>
<br>
Her tone is provocative. Without hesitation, I reach my hand into her pocket and find the gift – a fluffy collar.<br>
The metal clasp on it sparkles faintly in the light.<br>
<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项1：Do I wear this?</span>'''''<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项2：This is surprising...</span>'''''<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项1）</span>'''''Do I wear this?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Chapayev：</span><br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项1）</span>'''''Heehee. Figured it out already?<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项2）</span>'''''This is surprising...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Chapayev：</span><br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项2）</span>'''''Oh? What did you expect, then?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Chapayev：</span><br>
Something tells me you're not very bothered by it~<br>
<br>
She takes the collar, slowly lifts it up, and gazes at my neck.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Chapayev：</span><br>
So? Want me to put it on you, Commander?<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
You make it sound like a big deal...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Chapayev：</span><br>
If I do, it's because it is a big deal. Come on, don't be shy~<br>
<br>
Her fingertips brush against my neck, and with a cool touch, the metal clasp is fastened.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Chapayev：</span><br>
There... Mhm. It suits you even better than I'd imagined.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Suits me... How, exactly?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Chapayev：</span><br>
I mean that it's exactly what I expected.<br>
<br>
She smiles meaningfully as her gaze travels down to my chest.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Guess you win this round.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Chapayev：</span><br>
You say that as if you've lost♪<br>
<br>
When Chapayev leans forward, her breath brushes against my ear, leaving a soft whisper to linger within.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Chapayev：</span><br>
Now that you've accepted being mine... How about I come closer?<br>
<br>
Her fingers trace from shoulder to collar clasp, before tightening it slightly.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Chapayev...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Chapayev：</span><br>
Yes?<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Keep this up, and I will fight back.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Chapayev：</span><br>
Oh? How, I wonder... I can't wait to find out♡<br>
