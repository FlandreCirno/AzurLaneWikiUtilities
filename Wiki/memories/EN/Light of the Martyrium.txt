"You know, assistant... I mean, Commander."<br>
"I'm pretty scared of death."<br>
"So much so I don't even wanna think about it."<br>
"The thing that scares me the most is suddenly dropping dead."<br>
"Just everything coming to an abrupt end while your mind is still full of thoughts from yesterday and hopes for tomorrow."<br>
"So if I had to die, I'd want to do it on my own terms. I'd want to decide when, where, and how."<br>
"...Obviously, I'm nowhere near as brave as you are."<br>
"You don't come to terms with your own death just like that. It takes time."<br>
"But when death takes me, don't mourn for me."<br>
"Because when death comes, I'll be ready and waiting."<br>
"When my soul passes on, my aspirations also pass on – to you."<br>
"...What? I have too many of those for you to possibly shoulder?"<br>
"I know you're just trying to lift the mood with a joke, but I'm serious here."<br>
"...You really don't think you can do it without my help?"<br>
"You're asking an awful lot from someone who'll be dead."<br>
"But alright. I'll do what I can."<br>
"Everything I've worked for, I leave to you. My dreams, my path, and everything I've protected."<br>
I step through the door in that white space. A blinding whiteness appears and fades, then replaced by a soft light.<br>
Next, an overpowering feeling of fatigue hits me, nearly making me fall to the floor.<br>
I look around. I'm back at the Orthodoxy's conference venue – only now, it is dark outside.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
(That's odd. Every other time I've talked to Helena in that space, only an instant would pass in reality, no matter how long we spoke.)<br>
(This time, it feels like time has been flowing normally in reality.)<br>
(Maybe that's why I feel so tired... I must've been standing here for ages.)<br>
(I'm still concerned about the source of the jamming... but I won't be able to get anything done if I don't clear my head.)<br>
<span style="color:#5ce6ff;">???：</span><br>
There you are, mysterious assistant! You're late!<br>
I've been waiting AGES for you!<br>
<br>
I open the door to the guest room and find a dimly lit room with a hooded girl inside.<br>
She is lying on the bed, rhythmically hitting a pillow with an open palm.<br>
<span style="color:#5ce6ff;">???：</span><br>
You're the slowest slowpoke who's ever slowed!<br>
What took you so long to leave the venue?!<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
(Who in the world...)<br>
<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项1：What's going on here?</span>'''''<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项2：Uhh... Who might you be?</span>'''''<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项3：How'd you get in here?</span>'''''<br>
<span style="color:#5ce6ff;">???：</span><br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项1）</span>'''''What does it look like? I'm WAITING for YOU!<br>
<span style="color:#5ce6ff;">???：</span><br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项2）</span>'''''I'm Miss D!<br>
<span style="color:#5ce6ff;">???：</span><br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项3）</span>'''''I walked in! Your security is so lax I didn't need to sneak or anything!<br>
<span style="color:#5ce6ff;">???：</span><br>
Oh, by the way? I found a security hole of yours and fixed it! You should be thanking me!<br>
Someone was spying on you from extrastellar space! Bet you didn't know that, moron!<br>
<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项1："Extrastellar space"? And what do you mean, "spying on me"?</span>'''''<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
(Is she talking about that space Helena created with the Tower's power?)<br>
(Speaking of spying, this girl is in the guest room Helena mentioned. She also knows about our communications...)<br>
(Oh boy... Her "fixing the security hole" caused the interference that trapped me in the virtual space, didn't it?)<br>
......<br>
<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项1：It was all YOUR fault!</span>'''''<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项2：Hey, about that "fixing" you did...</span>'''''<br>
<span style="color:#5ce6ff;">Miss D：</span><br>
What? You ran late because my fix trapped you in there?<br>
I see how it is. You use that as a romantic dating spot. Sorry about that!<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
(...I did what?)<br>
<span style="color:#5ce6ff;">Miss D：</span><br>
But the thing is, I only cut the connection path. I didn't mess with anything local!<br>
If you could get in, why didn't you get out?<br>
<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项1：......</span>'''''<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项2：I didn't know HOW to get out.</span>'''''<br>
<span style="color:#5ce6ff;">Miss D：</span><br>
So you weren't able to...<br>
If you couldn't get out, why did you go in?<br>
<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项1：......</span>'''''<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项2：I didn't know HOW to get out.</span>'''''<br>
<span style="color:#5ce6ff;">Miss D：</span><br>
Wait, did you not go in by your own will?<br>
Ugh. This is getting so confusing!<br>
Forget it! You're here, and that's what matters! I've waited long enough, so let's go already!<br>
<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项1：Waited for what?</span>'''''<br>
<span style="color:#5ce6ff;">Miss D：</span><br>
To go whale-hunting!<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
(Whales? What do they have to do with anything?)<br>
(Wait, I can't let myself be caught up in her flow. I need to get some answers out of her–)<br>
<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项1：By the way, who's the "mysterious assistant" you mentioned?</span>'''''<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项2：Why did you call me "assistant"?</span>'''''<br>
<span style="color:#5ce6ff;">Miss D：</span><br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项1）</span>'''''You, duh! YOU are Aoste's mysterious assistant!<br>
<span style="color:#5ce6ff;">Miss D：</span><br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项2）</span>'''''Because you are! You're Aoste's mysterious assistant!<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
(Wait, so she even knows about my future "self"?)<br>
(Everyone who knows anything about that has only alluded to it in vague terms... but she just straight-up said it.)<br>
(Let's play along and see where it gets me.)<br>
<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项1：How do you remember who I am?</span>'''''<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项2：I'm surprised. Everyone else has forgotten who I am.</span>'''''<br>
<span style="color:#5ce6ff;">Miss D：</span><br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项1）</span>'''''I just do! What do you want me to say?<br>
<span style="color:#5ce6ff;">Miss D：</span><br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项2）</span>'''''That's because they're stupid! They've forgotten me, too!<br>
<span style="color:#5ce6ff;">Miss D：</span><br>
Look, enough Q&A! No more of that until we've caught the whale!<br>
I'm not gonna wait one more minute! We're leaving NOW!<br>
<br>
Without any warning, Miss D walks right up to me.<br>
Before I can get a word in, she musters an ungodly strength for her size and drags me outside.<br>
She leads me around the Iris city streets, pulling me by the sleeve of my uniform.<br>
I'm following her willingly because, despite my first impression, I don't sense any ill intent from her.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
(Also because I have to know who this girl is and what she wants with me.)<br>
<span style="color:#5ce6ff;">Miss D：</span><br>
The time has come, the whale has met its match! La-la-la, la-la-laaa!<br>
This time for sure we're bringing home a catch! La-la-la, la-la-laaa!<br>
<br>
She's been in a good mood ever since we left the guest room. She sings a tune, skipping and jumping as she goes down the street.<br>
Passersby should be turning their heads at us... but they aren't.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
(It's strange – she's practically screaming for attention, yet nobody seems to notice.)<br>
(Sure, it's late, but people are still on the streets. Why isn't anyone looking our way?)<br>
(It feels like nobody can even see us...)<br>
<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项1：Is it just me, or does nobody else see us?</span>'''''<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项2：Are you cloaking us?</span>'''''<br>
<span style="color:#5ce6ff;">Miss D：</span><br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项1）</span>'''''I couldn't bring you outside if they did, idiot!<br>
<span style="color:#5ce6ff;">Miss D：</span><br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项2）</span>'''''I'll clue you in after we've caught the whale!<br>
<br>
We keep walking until we arrive at a park, far away from the main venue.<br>
The girl is still singing and skipping along without a care.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
(I've got to ask...)<br>
<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项1：Where are we going?</span>'''''<br>
<span style="color:#5ce6ff;">Miss D：</span><br>
To the Gate of Avalon!<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Huh? Are you talking about Scapa Flow?<br>
You're not suggesting we WALK all the way over there, are you?<br>
<span style="color:#5ce6ff;">Miss D：</span><br>
If we have to!<br>
<span style="color:#5ce6ff;">Richelieu：</span><br>
I'm afraid that's not quite practical, Miss D.<br>
However, Commander, rest assured that there is a better way to get there.<br>
<br>
Richelieu's sudden appearance leaves me speechless.<br>
<span style="color:#5ce6ff;">Miss D：</span><br>
Right! The train! Let's take Liz's train!<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
...Liz? And what's this "train" you're talking about?<br>
And... why are you here, Richelieu?<br>
<span style="color:#5ce6ff;">Richelieu：</span><br>
I apologize for using such an unorthodox method of extracting you from the venue.<br>
But, everyone has their eyes on you. Miss D here was the only person capable of sneaking you out undetected.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
(Judging from how serious her tone is... This must be a matter of grave importance.)<br>
This must be a highly sensitive topic, then, if you're not even able to discuss it in your own capital.<br>
<span style="color:#5ce6ff;">Richelieu：</span><br>
Yes. No amount of precaution is excessive for what we have to talk about.<br>
After all, those who would seek to destroy our branch are everywhere, and we don't even know how many more lurk in the shadows.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
(...I did what?)<br>
<span style="color:#5ce6ff;">Richelieu：</span><br>
Allow me to cut to the chase. The Royal Navy and the Orthodoxy are currently preparing a joint operation.<br>
Not here, mind you. Our objective lies beyond our own branch.<br>
If we don't do something about it, it will one day have tremendous consequences for our world and everything we want to protect.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
And you want me to help – correct?<br>
<span style="color:#5ce6ff;">Richelieu：</span><br>
Correct. We need to move to a new location before we can tell you more. This place is not safe.<br>
Please come with me to Camelot's gate at Scapa Flow.<br>
Queen Elizabeth will give you all the details once we're there.<br>
I should state upfront that Naval HQ has no idea about this operation and that it is extremely dangerous.<br>
You can decide whether or not you'd like to help after you've heard what Queen Elizabeth has to say.<br>
Should you decide to decline our request, I will see to it that you're brought back as soon as possible.<br>
<br>
I squint at Richelieu and make out two figures standing behind her – Belfast and Sheffield.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
(Aha. Looks like the operation in Antarctica brought these factions closer than ever.)<br>
(I wonder what they've been discussing. I should ask about it later.)<br>
<span style="color:#5ce6ff;">Richelieu：</span><br>
Before you speak to Elizabeth, let me introduce you to your escorts. They will also be part of the operation.<br>
<br>
Richelieu makes a hand gesture, and her Iris comrades step forth out of hiding.<br>
<span style="color:#5ce6ff;">Alsace：</span><br>
This one is battleship Alsace – Sacrament of the Unified Orthodoxy, an unreachable dream, and guardian of the Holy See.<br>
<span style="color:#5ce6ff;">Mogador：</span><br>
I'm Mogador, judge of the Tribunal. I've been dying to show myself to you. Heheh...<br>
<span style="color:#5ce6ff;">Brennus：</span><br>
I am Brennus, a cruiser and a Templar Knight. Well met, Swordbearer.<br>
<span style="color:#5ce6ff;">Fleuret：</span><br>
Name's Fleuret – Le Hardi-class destroyer. Nice meeting you, Commander!<br>
<span style="color:#5ce6ff;">Épée：</span><br>
I-I'm Épée. Like Fleur said, nice to meet you...<br>
<span style="color:#5ce6ff;">Richelieu：</span><br>
They have all been carefully chosen for their battlefield competence and ability to protect you.<br>
The Tribunal may have a reputation for working behind the scenes, unlike those present at the venue now...<br>
But I assure you, these ladies can be relied upon in a fight.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
(Templar Knights, members of the Tribunal, and even Alsace... It's a small team, but their skill more than makes up for that.)<br>
(Clemenceau's cohorts are here, so you'd think she herself would be, too.)<br>
(She probably decided to let Richelieu do the talking. Clemenceau would so do that.)<br>
<br>
I shoot a look at each member of the team, then turn my eyes back on Richelieu and the Royal Maids.<br>
Richelieu gives me a solemn look, waiting for an answer from me, while Belfast gives me a small nod.<br>
Then there's Sheffield. The look in her eyes screams, "don't ask questions, just come with us."<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
(Elizabeth, Richelieu, and even Clemenceau are all on board with this.)<br>
(Moreover, their commitment to secrecy speaks volumes to the importance of whatever this is about.)<br>
(Then there's Miss D who knows what the future has in store. There's so much she could tell me.)<br>
(Most important of all, they need me. I have to hear what they have to say.)<br>
<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项1：Show me the way.</span>'''''<br>
<br>
Miss D waves her hands excitedly, and a train appears in the woods.<br>
<span style="color:#5ce6ff;">Miss D：</span><br>
Get in! We're going to Camelot to catch the whale!<br>

{{折叠面板|标题=The Two Queens|选项=2|主框=1|样式=primary|展开=是}}
<br>
We boarded the train and took off, running on invisible rails through the sky.<br>
Some time passes, and we finally arrive at the Mirror Sea in Scapa Flow.<br>
Scapa Flow - Anchorage<br>
Camelot - By the Gate<br>
The train doors open and a stream of brilliant golden light fills my vision.<br>
The clock says it's early morning, and yet this Mirror Sea is bathed in the light of afternoon.<br>
<span style="color:#5ce6ff;">Queen Elizabeth：</span><br>
Welcome to the Gate of Avalon, servant.<br>
A manmade Singularity and a jumping point between branches – impressive, no?<br>
<br>
This place – once merely a Mirror Sea – has been turned into a gateway between worlds since the Royal Navy seized it.<br>
I've come to know of it ever since Elizabeth sent me detailed documentation following Compiler's defeat.<br>
Still, reading about something and seeing it in person are two very different things. It's an awe-inspiring structure.<br>
<span style="color:#ffc960;">???：</span><br>
Heehee. Just the reaction she hoped for.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
"She"?<br>
<span style="color:#ffc960;">???：</span><br>
Yes, your Elizabeth. She wanted to impress you on your first visit here, so she turned the lights way up.<br>
<span style="color:#5ce6ff;">Queen Elizabeth：</span><br>
Oi! You're not supposed to say that!<br>
<span style="color:#ffc960;">???：</span><br>
Not say what? The truth?<br>
<span style="color:#5ce6ff;">Queen Elizabeth：</span><br>
Bah! Yes, I turned up the lights, but only to further demonstrate the importance of this operation.<br>
Oh, servant, I don't believe you've met before.<br>
This is Queen Elizabeth. META, as you can tell.<br>
She is the leader of her organisation and is currently staying here as part of my reinforcements.<br>
Also, she introduced me to Miss D and brought in that train you rode on.<br>
<span style="color:#ffc960;">Queen Elizabeth META：</span><br>
Greetings, serv– Commander. We've been observing you from the driver's seat.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
"We"? Were you both driving the train?<br>
<span style="color:#ffc960;">Queen Elizabeth META：</span><br>
...No. We mean the royalty you're addressing now. We are the only one capable of driving the Queen's Light, so we had to go and pick you up personally.<br>
As much as we'd like to introduce ourselves beyond what your Elizabeth just said, this is simply not the time.<br>
Now, about the observing we did... We've deduced that you're in a similar state to Miss D.<br>
To put it succinctly, you are incomplete.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
What does that mean?<br>
<span style="color:#5ce6ff;">Queen Elizabeth：</span><br>
Phrasing it like that doesn't explain anything. Come, servant. Sit down.<br>
I know you have questions. Richelieu surely promised that I'd explain everything you should know before you agreed to anything.<br>
What I am about to tell you is top secret. Whether or not you agree to help, you must not let Naval HQ hear a word of it. Do you understand?<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Of course.<br>
<span style="color:#5ce6ff;">Queen Elizabeth：</span><br>
Good. I just wanted to make it crystal clear.<br>
Before we go on, let me remind you of the information we've previously shared.<br>
First, the enemies we call the Sirens – they are manmade creations from the future whose true name is "Antiochus".<br>
Technically, it's ANTI-X, which stands for "Artificial Navy Transformational Intelligence, Class X" in full.<br>
Their name suggests that they are manmade weapons designed to fight against "X", but it isn't clear what this "X" actually is.<br>
All we know is that this greater threat is out there, and currently, neither Antiochus nor the Ashes have any fundamental countermeasures against them.<br>
Second, the Sirens are conducting experiments across many branches, ours included, designed to counteract X.<br>
The technology they possess allows them to not only manipulate these experimental branches at will, but also to dispose of them should they choose to do so.<br>
Whatever this "X" enemy is, it doesn't make the Sirens any less an existential threat to us, and we should still eliminate them.<br>
But, therein lies the problem. Even if we defeat the Sirens and banish their power from our world, what do we do about this looming threat?<br>
If we don't know how to fight it, our fate will be the same as though the Sirens had destroyed us all.<br>
So, I came up with a plan.<br>
Yes, that's right. Surely you must've noticed on your way here – that Miss D is indeed a Siren.<br>
My META self here has assessed that it's very likely that she is one of Antiochus' high-level programmes, despite her childish demeanour.<br>
Apparently, she is missing her rigging – the "whale," as she calls it. Its absence has impaired her memory and restricted her computational resources.<br>
She is incomplete, in other words.<br>
Think of what we could gain if we can make her complete again. Data on X, records of battles against it, perhaps even a way to stop it from invading.<br>
<span style="color:#ffc960;">Queen Elizabeth META：</span><br>
Indeed. Ever since we found Miss D, we've dispatched forces to try and capture this whale.<br>
So far, there's been no success, even if we got very close in our last attempt.<br>
A few days prior, Miss D picked up the whale's trail again, and we've been gearing up to hunt for it again.<br>
<span style="color:#5ce6ff;">Queen Elizabeth：</span><br>
She picks up the whale's trail only periodically, you see.<br>
Now I will explain why we want your help.<br>
The whale Miss D wants to catch is in a location where a spatial impact event occurred.<br>
Both I and my META counterpart believe the whale is drawn to those.<br>
These spatial impact events often occur where battles are waged. What we want is your tactical expertise to catch the enemy unawares. This will significantly raise our chances of success.<br>
<span style="color:#ffc960;">Queen Elizabeth META：</span><br>
One additional detail – these spatial events are frequently observed during Wisdom Cube experiments as well.<br>
We trust that your exceptionally high Cube affinity will allow you to deal with any unforeseen turns during the operation.<br>
Oh, and Miss D raised a huge fuss over you. She insists that you aid us.<br>
Yes, she may look and act like a child, but she is still a Siren. Her intuition is leaps and bounds better than ours.<br>
<span style="color:#5ce6ff;">Queen Elizabeth：</span><br>
She is also very familiar with all those terms you picked up inside the Reality Lens.<br>
Even if my probing has yet to yield any useful information from her...<br>
Regardless, it has been established that what happens in the future leads to the birth of the Ashes and the Antiochus.<br>
Speaking of which, we've learned that the Sirens call this particular future "the alpha timeline."<br>
As they are all linked, learning about the alpha timeline will lead to more knowledge about the Sirens and X...<br>
<span style="color:#ffc960;">Queen Elizabeth META：</span><br>
Don't give us that look. We aren't from the alpha timeline.<br>
Everyone we've met who seems to be from the alpha timeline is very tight-lipped about the branch they come from.<br>
They either don't want to talk about it, or they've lost their memories from that time.<br>
<span style="color:#5ce6ff;">Queen Elizabeth：</span><br>
Like with the case of Renown and Repulse who we found using our gate.<br>
Sometimes their accounts of the same event contradict each other and they don't even realise until I point it out.<br>
This makes it nigh-impossible to verify essentially anything about the alpha timeline.<br>
But you, my servant, are different. It's very clear that Miss D has been trying to tell you something.<br>
I am quite certain that you'll make progress in your own investigation if we successfully capture that whale.<br>
<br>
This barrage of new information from the two Elizabeths comes as a shock to me.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
(I AM the person best suited to investigate the alpha timeline I saw in the Reality Lens...)<br>
(Anzeel and Aoste are both from that timeline. There's a good chance that "Silver Fox" I heard about is from there, too.)<br>
(Hell, I probably am, too. No matter if they were simulations constructed from memories or not, they clearly knew who I was.)<br>
(Maybe I've actually lost some of my memories, just like those METAs...)<br>
<span style="color:#c3abff;">Recorder：</span><br>
Well, it looks like you've finally started to piece together the puzzle of the shipgirls' hulls.<br>
It only matches my records by less than 1%, but this wavelength has to be yours.<br>
The fact that you're playing this recording is absolute proof that it's you.<br>
It also means that my very last gamble was successful.<br>
I know you. No matter when, where, or who you are...<br>
You could never abandon those girls.<br>
Making you the final failsafe was the right call.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
(Wait, so that's what the recording of Anzeel inside the virtual memory space meant...)<br>
<span style="color:#5ce6ff;">Queen Elizabeth：</span><br>
It seems lots of pieces just fell into place for you, judging by your reaction.<br>
I was right to put my faith in you, my servant.<br>
You will stop at nothing for us shipgirls and keep no secrets to yourself.<br>
You have helped us see through the Sirens' web of lies foisted upon us by the Naval HQ, and carved out a place for us in this world.<br>
It is thanks to you that all our factions stand together, united in our struggle against our unrelenting enemies.<br>
And when we come together, we can accomplish the impossible. Like we did in Antarctica.<br>
Without you, we would have succumbed to distrust and old grievances, and consequently, fallen prey to the Gazers.<br>
But, you managed to bring unlikely allies together in Soyuz and Bismarck, averting the crisis we faced.<br>
You've been there for us every step of the way, which is why we can even talk about plans and about the future.<br>
And if you'll join us for this operation, I will gladly tell you everything I know and help you in any way I can.<br>
What do you say, Commander?<br>
<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项1：It's a very risky operation...</span>'''''<br>
But it's also a golden opportunity we can't afford to pass on.<br>
<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项1：You're right. I'm in.</span>'''''<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项2：All the more reason for me to get involved.</span>'''''<br>
<span style="color:#ffc960;">Queen Elizabeth META：</span><br>
Heehee. What a brave soul.<br>
<span style="color:#5ce6ff;">Queen Elizabeth：</span><br>
See? I told you my servant was up for the task!<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
I have a question. Won't there be bedlam over me suddenly disappearing from the venue?<br>
<span style="color:#5ce6ff;">Queen Elizabeth：</span><br>
I've already planned for that eventuality.<br>
Richelieu and I will come up with something to quell suspicions for long enough to accomplish the mission.<br>
<span style="color:#ffc960;">Queen Elizabeth META：</span><br>
For that reason, we will be accompanying you, Commander. The train requires a "Queen Elizabeth" to stabilise its conceptual defence.<br>
<span style="color:#5ce6ff;">Queen Elizabeth：</span><br>
Of course you get to go! I don't buy your excuse that it "needs" one of us, but I can't argue with it either!<br>
But I digress. In short, Richelieu and I will stay behind and cover for you.<br>
<span style="color:#5ce6ff;">Richelieu：</span><br>
The story I'm thinking we'll run with is that Her Majesty here is paying a sudden visit to the venue, so you, as her "servant," are busy tending to her whims for a few days.<br>
<span style="color:#ffc960;">Queen Elizabeth META：</span><br>
We won't need that much time. We'll be done and back in a day or two at most.<br>
<span style="color:#5ce6ff;">Miss D：</span><br>
Elizabeth! I told you, you're not coming along!<br>
No METAs can come! Not a single one!<br>
<span style="color:#ffc960;">Queen Elizabeth META：</span><br>
Yes, we know. You were quite insistent on employing shipgirls from this timeline rather than ours.<br>
But whether you like it or not, WE have to drive the train.<br>
<span style="color:#5ce6ff;">Miss D：</span><br>
Oh. Right. We need a driver. Fine, you can come! But watch yourself!<br>
<span style="color:#ffc960;">Queen Elizabeth META：</span><br>
Whatever you say...<br>
<span style="color:#5ce6ff;">Richelieu：</span><br>
I can vouch for these girls. They will risk their own lives to protect you if need be.<br>
<span style="color:#5ce6ff;">Miss D：</span><br>
Good! Not-METAs are better! They're handy!<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
(Our force would be much stronger with some of Elizabeth META's subordinates, strategically speaking...)<br>
(Why does Miss D not want any METAs along? Are they somehow a liability for this operation?)<br>
(I'd ask, but I doubt I'll get a straight answer from her until we catch her whale.)<br>
So, what now? Do we board the Queen's Light and jump to a new branch?<br>
<span style="color:#ffc960;">Queen Elizabeth META：</span><br>
While the Queen's Light would be ample for this mission, we will instead travel to our destination via Camelot.<br>
It's safer to have a two-way portal in case backup is required. It also guarantees we have a way home.<br>
There is the risk of Sirens or that Bon Homme Richard pursuing us, but if it comes to that, the new-and-improved gate and our train can easily hop from branch to branch.<br>
Any last questions before departure?<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
None that I can think of.<br>
<span style="color:#ffc960;">Queen Elizabeth META：</span><br>
Good. Then let us get ready to leave.<br>
<span style="color:#5ce6ff;">Queen Elizabeth：</span><br>
You do that. I'm off to the Orthodoxy in the meanwhile.<br>
Enjoy your whale hunt! And try not to die!<br>
<br>
Queen Elizabeth gets up and leaves, taking Belfast and Sheffield with her.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
(Huh. I thought for sure she'd make us bring along one of the Royal Maids.)<br>
(I hope that's a sign of her trusting Richelieu so much that she'll leave this mission entirely to her.)<br>
<span style="color:#5ce6ff;">Richelieu：</span><br>
Ladies – upon the name of the guiding Iris, remember your oaths and guard the Commander at any cost.<br>
<span style="color:#5ce6ff;">Alsace：</span><br>
For as long as one's heart beats, one shall be the guarding sword that protects the Commander from all who wish to do harm.<br>
<span style="color:#5ce6ff;">Mogador：</span><br>
And I will do the Holy See's bidding, for I am an agent of the Tribunal.<br>
<span style="color:#5ce6ff;">Richelieu：</span><br>
May the Iris be with you all.<br>
Commander, take this. It's a communicator modified and improved by the Tribunal.<br>
I've been told it's more advanced than the ones from the Eagle Union. It ensures a more stable, better-encrypted connection.<br>
The others have all gotten one, too. You'll be able to issue commands to them remotely like normal.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
(Even the Tribunal's chipping in for this mission, eh. I hope it'll protect against strong jamming, since I still can't get in touch with Helena as a backup.)<br>
Thanks a lot.<br>
<span style="color:#5ce6ff;">Richelieu：</span><br>
You're welcome. May luck and the Holy Iris be with you, Commander.<br>
<br>
After those words of farewell, Richelieu also takes her leave from Camelot.<br>
Soon after, the golden rings above the castle come to life.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Alright. Let's go catch a whale!<br>

<br>
The ring of light rotates, and the world around us begins to change.<br>
The jump between branches has begun, and yet, the courtyard of Camelot doesn't show any signs of motion.<br>
<span style="color:#ffc960;">Queen Elizabeth META：</span><br>
The gate can travel in two different ways. One is to jump from Mirror Sea to Mirror Sea, and the other is to designate coordinates for direct travel.<br>
When traveling directly to coordinates, one must handle the impact from the target branch – the spatial impact event.<br>
It seems this one accomplishes that through an energy barrier created by three rings.<br>
Our compliments to whoever built this.<br>
The foundation is well-designed, with ample attention paid to flexibility and comfort alike.<br>
Now, to keep any malicious actors from trailing us, we'll be taking a detour or ten.<br>
Three hours until we reach our target branch. Have a spot of tea while we wait.<br>
Your Elizabeth's maids made it before our departure.<br>
...We will have to drink elsewhere. Don't mind us. Go, relax.<br>
<br>
In the courtyard...<br>
<span style="color:#5ce6ff;">Brennus：</span><br>
The tea and snacks are ready. I taste-tested them. They're sweet and have a nice texture, and of course, I tasted no poison.<br>
<span style="color:#5ce6ff;">Fleuret：</span><br>
Phew... Royal Navy sweets never cease to amaze!<br>
It's crazy how you have such great sweets, but the rest of your food is... Bah, now's not the time for that!<br>
Eat up, everyone! It's hot and fresh! Don't be shy, Commander!<br>
<span style="color:#5ce6ff;">Alsace：</span><br>
*gulp*... *gulp*... This one shall ingest coolant instead of iced tea...<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Coolant?!<br>
Oh. Right, you need to cool your modules like Gascogne does.<br>
<span style="color:#5ce6ff;">Alsace：</span><br>
Th-that's right! Gascogne is acknowledged as a powerful, supportive ally!<br>
<span style="color:#5ce6ff;">Épée：</span><br>
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa...<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Épée, what's wrong? Do you see something in the sweets?<br>
<span style="color:#5ce6ff;">Épée：</span><br>
N-nope! I'm just worried I'll drop my tray... It's happened a million times by now... Whoa, whoa...<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Wait, didn't you say you struggle with controlling your strength?<br>
<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项1：It's okay if you drop it! No pressure.</span>'''''<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项2：Umm, what if I fed you?</span>'''''<br>
<span style="color:#5ce6ff;">Épée：</span><br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项1）</span>'''''C-Commander, that can't possibly be okay...<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项1）</span>'''''Her Majesty wouldn't mind a broken tray or two.<br>
<span style="color:#5ce6ff;">Miss D：</span><br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项1）</span>'''''Yeah! Elizabeth doesn't care!<br>
<span style="color:#5ce6ff;">Épée：</span><br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项2）</span>'''''C-Commander, that can't possibly be okay...<br>
<span style="color:#5ce6ff;">Fleuret：</span><br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项2）</span>'''''If Eepy won't take you up on it, I will! My mouth is open and waiting, Commander!<br>
<span style="color:#5ce6ff;">Alsace：</span><br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项2）</span>'''''Th-this one... w-w-wants to eat, too! *tremble*<br>
<span style="color:#5ce6ff;">Miss D：</span><br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项2）</span>'''''Me, too! Feed meee!<br>
<br>
Despite the momentary ruckus, we manage to enjoy a relatively relaxed tea time together.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Say, where's Mogador? I haven't seen her in a while.<br>
<span style="color:#5ce6ff;">Brennus：</span><br>
The way she... dresses... isn't appropriate for tea parties.<br>
Mogador should be on guard, same as I. Her post is in the tower over yonder.<br>
<br>
I look in the direction Brennus is pointing to. There I see a vague silhouette.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Yeah... Yeah, that's not proper dress for a tea party. Is there anything we can do about her?<br>
<span style="color:#5ce6ff;">Brennus：</span><br>
That is apparently a quirk of hers. Unfortunately, it comes with the work environment. I don't think it's within our power to help.<br>
We can simply leave her share of sweets for her to collect later.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Guess that's all we can do...<br>
<br>
Three hours pass in the blink of an eye. The tea party has helped me get to know our new Iris friends.<br>
While we all clean up, Miss D – who had spent much of the time lying on the grass after tiring herself out – suddenly springs onto her feet.<br>
<span style="color:#5ce6ff;">Miss D：</span><br>
The whale! I can practically smell it!<br>
It's close! So very close!<br>
Elizabeth, get the train! I'm bagging me a whale!<br>
<span style="color:#5ce6ff;">Alsace：</span><br>
Whale hunting confirmed as the objective of this journey. But this one cannot see or pinpoint the coordinates of said whale.<br>
<span style="color:#5ce6ff;">Brennus：</span><br>
Hmm. I have no idea what happened, either.<br>
<span style="color:#5ce6ff;">Miss D：</span><br>
Mm. This is weird. Where's the whale? Is it hiding?!<br>
How the hell did it activate that... The automatic defense system's exceeded its call limit!<br>
Hey, you damn whale! Show yourself already!<br>
Whaaaaale! C'mon, c'mon, c'mon!<br>
<br>
Miss D screams angrily into the empty sky.<br>
And then... something starts to show itself.<br>
First was a slight spatial fluctuation outside of the gate's rings.<br>
Immediately after, a whale emerges from space not far beyond the outermost ring.<br>
<span style="color:#5ce6ff;">Fleuret：</span><br>
Is that... the whale we're trying to catch?<br>
<span style="color:#5ce6ff;">Épée：</span><br>
It's huge...<br>
<span style="color:#5ce6ff;">Brennus：</span><br>
Judging from its apparent size and the distance between us, it must be between 1,100 and 1,300 meters long.<br>
Huge is an understatement.<br>
<span style="color:#5ce6ff;">Miss D：</span><br>
Yeah! That's my whale right there! Elizabeth! Get off your bum and let's go catch that whale!<br>
<span style="color:#ffc960;">Queen Elizabeth META：</span><br>
...<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
I have a question. Does that whale respond to your voice to begin with?<br>
Great if so, but if not...<br>
<span style="color:#5ce6ff;">Mogador：</span><br>
Ah, the whale's turning toward us. I have a bad feeling about thiiis...<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Oh no. Elizabeth! Activate your defenses!<br>
<span style="color:#ffc960;">Queen Elizabeth META：</span><br>
First Ring, deploy active defences!<br>
<br>
Dazzling golden light rushes through the gate's defensive barrier for a moment. The whale's energy blast is halted, left as nothing but ripples on the surface.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
It attacked us!<br>
<span style="color:#5ce6ff;">Miss D：</span><br>
H-how?! We didn't even attack it. Why would it activate its automatic defenses?<br>
Hell, why is it attacking ME in the first place?<br>
Why... I don't get it, I don't get it, it makes no sense!<br>
<br>
Realizing that its attack was futile, the whale shakes its head slightly. Without even glancing at Miss D, it disappears into the spatial fluctuations it had come from.<br>
<span style="color:#5ce6ff;">Miss D：</span><br>
Whale, my whale... *sob*... Whyyy...<br>
<span style="color:#5ce6ff;">Mogador：</span><br>
Do you think it's gonna try and ambush us?<br>
<span style="color:#ffc960;">Queen Elizabeth META：</span><br>
Maybe so. We've found it strange ever since Hunter's team last tried to catch it.<br>
When it was cornered, it suddenly showed unexpected intelligence AND weapons we'd never seen before...<br>
<span style="color:#5ce6ff;">Miss D：</span><br>
Lies! That can't be true!<br>
The whale answers only to me! Only I can control it!<br>
<span style="color:#ffc960;">Queen Elizabeth META：</span><br>
Yes, yes. We can see the truth for ourselves before long.<br>
For now, focus on finding out where that whale went... and how to drag it out of hiding.<br>
{{折叠面板|内容结束}}

{{折叠面板|标题=Concept Anchoring|选项=4|主框=1|样式=primary|展开=是}}
<br>
For the time being, we decide to observe for any more spatial fluctuations – distortions caused by enormous energy sources.<br>
<span style="color:#5ce6ff;">Mogador：</span><br>
So, Commander... You think it decided to be careful because its ambush failed?<br>
<span style="color:#5ce6ff;">Fleuret：</span><br>
And it'll show up again if we make ourselves look defenseless?<br>
<span style="color:#5ce6ff;">Alsace：</span><br>
Huh?! That makes sense, but using yourself as bait just sounds too dangerous!<br>
<span style="color:#5ce6ff;">Brennus：</span><br>
Swordbearer, I agree that patience is key. We still don't know the extent of the whale's power. If we show weakness, it may just prove fatal.<br>
<span style="color:#5ce6ff;">Mogador：</span><br>
Wanting to be taken advantage of is one thing, but by the enemy? No way!<br>
The whale's goal is to avoid capture, not kill us, right? What if it just hides until we leave?<br>
<span style="color:#5ce6ff;">Épée：</span><br>
Th-then what do we do?<br>
<span style="color:#ffc960;">Queen Elizabeth META：</span><br>
What if the whale is so quick to flee because of the recent spatial impact event?<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Hmm... Fighting Sirens causes spatial impact events, as I recall. And that leads to spatial fluctuations?<br>
<span style="color:#ffc960;">Queen Elizabeth META：</span><br>
Right. This whole operation began with the idea that the whale is drawn to spatial impact events.<br>
If this place is subjected to the same influence... Hm, this spatial impact event must have been severe.<br>
These coordinates must have been an experimental field where Sirens fought, or something.<br>
But there's nothing here. The spatial impact event was so intense that it wiped the whole area out of existence.<br>
Mmm... Basically, a concept erased from matter returned to another dimension, causing space to fold in on itself and create a special area in that dimension.<br>
For example, the sea where the whale swam. When the sea disappeared, the whale followed the concept of that sea and disappeared from reality.<br>
But once it leaves the world of that concept, that's it. This was our mistake.<br>
<span style="color:#5ce6ff;">Miss D：</span><br>
What? If there's no physical foundation for it, just make another!<br>
Take a new foundation and anchor the concept to that! Easy peasy!<br>
If that whale gets away now, there's no telling when I'll see it again!<br>
<span style="color:#ffc960;">Queen Elizabeth META：</span><br>
You're right about that. We're in trouble if it escapes into conceptual space again.<br>
At this rate, whoever is manipulating the whale now might just gain full control of it.<br>
In the worst case, this might be our final whale hunt.<br>
<span style="color:#5ce6ff;">Miss D：</span><br>
I TOLD you, nobody but me can control the whale! When I say you can't, I mean you can't!<br>
<span style="color:#ffc960;">Queen Elizabeth META：</span><br>
But what if that person was you?<br>
You Antiochus can still operate, even when you're incomplete. What if the one controlling the whale is another Miss D?<br>
<span style="color:#5ce6ff;">Miss D：</span><br>
Ah...<br>
AAAAAAAH!<br>
Damn, damn, damn! That's actually, really possible!<br>
I'm such a moron! I'm gonna get my whale stolen away... by ME!<br>
<span style="color:#ffc960;">Queen Elizabeth META：</span><br>
*sigh*... Well, we're glad you understand the gravity of this situation.<br>
<span style="color:#5ce6ff;">Alsace：</span><br>
Thank you, Commander. One is sorry you had to calm the two of them...<br>
But one still doesn't understand how we're meant to drag that whale out of hiding.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
That makes two of us. I could certainly use more explanation.<br>
<span style="color:#5ce6ff;">Fleuret：</span><br>
I don't get ANY of it!<br>
<span style="color:#5ce6ff;">Épée：</span><br>
M-me, either...<br>
<span style="color:#5ce6ff;">Brennus：</span><br>
Likewise, Swordbearer.<br>
<span style="color:#5ce6ff;">Mogador：</span><br>
I feel like I kinda got it... Mmm, but I dunno...<br>
<span style="color:#ffc960;">Queen Elizabeth META：</span><br>
It's too complicated for us to explain right now, and you don't need to understand the principles.<br>
However, we have hit upon a way to drag the whale out of hiding. It is dangerous, though.<br>
Our original plan was to snatch up the whale while the Antiochus were busy fighting their enemy...<br>
But the situation implies that their enemy is alive and well, and they aren't hostile toward the whale.<br>
In other words, if we try to drag out the whale, we may be forced to fight two factions at once.<br>
A head-on fight would be hopeless.<br>
So the plan is... for all of you to return to the beta timeline! Miss D and we will figure things out here!<br>
<span style="color:#5ce6ff;">Miss D：</span><br>
The assistant can't leave!<br>
<span style="color:#ffc960;">Queen Elizabeth META：</span><br>
What?!<br>
<span style="color:#5ce6ff;">Miss D：</span><br>
I don't know why! But I know that!<br>
<span style="color:#ffc960;">Queen Elizabeth META：</span><br>
We've put up with you for long enough, but our patience is wearing thin.<br>
If you don't give us a proper reason, already, we're taking our servant back home!<br>
<span style="color:#5ce6ff;">Miss D：</span><br>
Boooo! No means no!<br>
Back me up, assistant! I'll protect you. Just don't leave me!<br>
<span style="color:#ffc960;">Queen Elizabeth META：</span><br>
That's enough! We promised the other Elizabeth that her servant would be returned safe from harm!<br>
<span style="color:#5ce6ff;">Miss D：</span><br>
NOOOOOO!<br>
<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项1：There they go derailing things again...</span>'''''<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项2：Okay, girls, calm down...</span>'''''<br>
<span style="color:#ffc960;">Queen Elizabeth META：</span><br>
Servant, do you have something you'd like to add?<br>
<span style="color:#5ce6ff;">Miss D：</span><br>
Assistaaant!<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
In my opinion, we have too little time to waste it arguing.<br>
I came here well aware of the risks of this operation.<br>
If safety is really our top priority, then now is our chance to give up and go home.<br>
Besides, there is something I want to look into.<br>
Beyond the whale... I can't let slip an opportunity to learn about the Antiochus and the alpha timeline.<br>
As Commander, I've joined in countless battles. Every time we faced mortal danger together, we overcame it.<br>
I trust in the people who protect me, and in return, I want you all to trust in my resolve.<br>
<span style="color:#5ce6ff;">Miss D：</span><br>
Yeah, there you go! I'll keep you safe, mysterious assistant!<br>
<span style="color:#5ce6ff;">Alsace：</span><br>
If you say so, Commander... then one is resolved to fight.<br>
<span style="color:#5ce6ff;">Mogador：</span><br>
Heheh, I won't let anyone lay a finger on you, Commander♥<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
(I have friends and allies here. Let's think of a countermeasure first before we do anything drastic.)<br>
(If Miss D is willing to ally with us, then we might just be able to get Helena's help.)<br>
(I haven't received any word at all from her since I left the venue.)<br>
(But I know her. Even if our communication lines have recovered, she won't contact me until it's absolutely necessary.)<br>
(Anyway, I can discuss this with everyone another time.)<br>
<span style="color:#ffc960;">Queen Elizabeth META：</span><br>
Your composure betrays a lack of understanding, Commander.<br>
Even we don't want to fight an enemy that can cause such an enormous spatial impact event.<br>
<span style="color:#5ce6ff;">Alsace：</span><br>
Is it military power that scares you, or the power of the concept?<br>
<span style="color:#ffc960;">Queen Elizabeth META：</span><br>
Both. Do you not believe us?<br>
<span style="color:#5ce6ff;">Mogador：</span><br>
We trust the Commander. And the Commander trusts you, so...<br>
<span style="color:#ffc960;">Queen Elizabeth META：</span><br>
Alright, then. It seems you're not withdrawing.<br>
As for how to make a foundation to ground the concept and drag out the whale...<br>
The beta timeline had "concept anchors" that they used, yes? In that case...<br>
<span style="color:#5ce6ff;">Miss D：</span><br>
Elizabeth, the train! Use one of the train cars!<br>
<span style="color:#ffc960;">Queen Elizabeth META：</span><br>
Ugh... Must we really?<br>
<span style="color:#5ce6ff;">Miss D：</span><br>
Of course! The Queen's Light is strong and dense enough! It's perfect for turning individual space into a foundation!<br>
<span style="color:#ffc960;">Queen Elizabeth META：</span><br>
Urk... But our precious carriage...<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
(She really looks like she doesn't want to part with this train carriage... It must've taken an astronomical effort to build.)<br>
<span style="color:#5ce6ff;">Miss D：</span><br>
When we catch the whale, you can just turn it back into a train car!<br>
<span style="color:#ffc960;">Queen Elizabeth META：</span><br>
Ughhh...... Fine.<br>
Now, what concept will we use to manifest the whale?<br>
Perhaps a bridge?<br>
It will come with a river, giving the whale room to swim. If it escapes, we can cross it to give chase.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
(I don't like this. It'll just mean leaving everyone behind again.)<br>
Hold on a second. Let's get some things straight.<br>
The whale entered a separate, folded space. That's why we can't access it from the physical world.<br>
So we need to give it a concept and anchor it to it in order to drag it out into our world.<br>
To do this, we use your Mirror Sea train car technology to change a condensed space with the concept of "train" into a different concept, making it into a different space.<br>
If that concept can connect to the space where the whale is, the whale can be manifested here.<br>
And then we capture it before it can escape... Are we straight on that so far?<br>
<span style="color:#ffc960;">Queen Elizabeth META：</span><br>
(Wow... What a fruitful analysis.)<br>
That's more or less correct.<br>
Now, Commander, what do you think of the concept? What's likely to connect us to the space the whale is in?<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
How about doors?<br>
Maybe we can go through it and go to the whale. There were doors in all of the imaginary spaces connected to the Arbiters... to the alpha timeline, too.<br>
(And I've already been to those spaces several times already.)<br>
<span style="color:#ffc960;">Queen Elizabeth META：</span><br>
(The Commander knows about the doors, too...?)<br>
<span style="color:#5ce6ff;">Miss D：</span><br>
No, no, nuh-uh! Door and bridge are both wrong!<br>
It's Death! Only Death can capture the whale!<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
(Death... Huh? Is that what the "D" in Miss D means?)<br>
(Death is a tarot card, too... Is she related to the Arbiters?)<br>
<span style="color:#ffc960;">Queen Elizabeth META：</span><br>
Are you willing to stake our lives on a word that came so easily?<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
I trust her. It's a little violent, but Miss D knows the whale more than the rest of us combined.<br>
<span style="color:#5ce6ff;">Alsace：</span><br>
The Commander accepted the concept of death so quickly! It was even faster than this one's analysis module!<br>
<span style="color:#5ce6ff;">Brennus：</span><br>
The Swordbearer knows more than us. Now is the time to trust our leader's judgment.<br>
<span style="color:#5ce6ff;">Mogador：</span><br>
I like letting the Commander toy with me. Yeah, I'm just gonna wait and see what happens.<br>
<span style="color:#ffc960;">Queen Elizabeth META：</span><br>
Anchoring the concept of death means, well... We'll have to imagine it.<br>
We will operate the train, so it follows that we shall–<br>
<span style="color:#5ce6ff;">Miss D：</span><br>
No METAs!<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Okay, then let me–<br>
<span style="color:#5ce6ff;">Miss D：</span><br>
No assistant, either! If you lack the concept, then stay away from it!<br>
I'll pick one of the Iris shipgirls! That's for the best!<br>
...Alsace, you do it!<br>
<span style="color:#5ce6ff;">Alsace：</span><br>
Hmm? This one should imagine a concept...?<br>
Knowledge on how to do it does not exist in one's memory logs... What now?<br>
<span style="color:#ffc960;">Queen Elizabeth META：</span><br>
Don't worry. It's easy, we'll teach you right now.<br>
First, relax...<br>
<span style="color:#5ce6ff;">Alsace：</span><br>
Alsace, relax. Alsace, don't be nervous.<br>
Emotion module still running, reducing speed of relaxation below expected value...<br>
<span style="color:#5ce6ff;">Fleuret：</span><br>
Alsace, standby mode!<br>
<span style="color:#5ce6ff;">Alsace：</span><br>
Understood! Entering standby mode!<br>
<span style="color:#ffc960;">Queen Elizabeth META：</span><br>
...Whoa.<br>
Ahem. That will do. Now, imagine the concept of death.<br>
Not the moment of someone's death, but the manifestation of death, a place emblematic of it... Envision that.<br>
<span style="color:#5ce6ff;">Alsace：</span><br>
The concept of death. A manifested place, images, imagination...<br>
<span style="color:#ffc960;">Queen Elizabeth META：</span><br>
Keep doing that. The more specific, the better.<br>
Everyone, get on the train. It's almost time to ride.<br>

<br>
We camouflaged the door and Camelot before boarding the Queen's Light.<br>
Boundless stars shine outside the window.<br>
But our destination isn't the distant sea of stars. It's absolute nothingness.<br>
<span style="color:#ffc960;">Queen Elizabeth META：</span><br>
We're almost there. Alsace, are you ready?<br>
<span style="color:#5ce6ff;">Alsace：</span><br>
M-maybe! Let this one prepare a little longer...<br>
<span style="color:#ffc960;">Queen Elizabeth META：</span><br>
Don't worry. Relax and leave it all to us.<br>
<br>
Time stops.<br>
Everything in the carriage halts. Even sound is snuffed out.<br>
Elizabeth alone begins to slowly move.<br>
One step at a time, leaving faint afterimages behind her.<br>
She stops for a moment in front of Alsace. Then, she walks right through her.<br>
Instantly after, time flows anew.<br>
The afterimages left behind by Elizabeth flow through Alsace and melt into their owner.<br>
<span style="color:#ffc960;">Queen Elizabeth META：</span><br>
Our inspection is complete.<br>
Well done. You can stop imagining it now.<br>
<span style="color:#5ce6ff;">Alsace：</span><br>
It's over already...? Nothing is in this one's memory region...<br>
<span style="color:#ffc960;">Queen Elizabeth META：</span><br>
You did great.<br>
It's a shock that someone can construct the concept of death so well.<br>
<span style="color:#5ce6ff;">Fleuret：</span><br>
Eek, that was like a horror movie brought to life.<br>
Elizabeth just teleported behind Alsace... Like some kind of ghost!<br>
<span style="color:#5ce6ff;">Épée：</span><br>
I-I didn't see anything... Nothing at all...<br>
<span style="color:#5ce6ff;">Brennus：</span><br>
What awesome speed. Even I couldn't keep sight of her.<br>
<span style="color:#5ce6ff;">Mogador：</span><br>
Hmmm...<br>
<span style="color:#5ce6ff;">Miss D：</span><br>
Hahaha! Cool, right?<br>
After we catch that whale, I'll be even cooler!<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
(Huh? Did nobody else see what just happened?)<br>
(Actually, passing through a target so fast that you leave afterimages... I remember the Arbiter we fought in the Mediterranean doing the same thing.)<br>
(She called that... inspection? I'll ask Helena about that.)<br>
<span style="color:#5ce6ff;">Fleuret：</span><br>
So? Did it work, or what?<br>
Nothing looks any different outside.<br>
<span style="color:#5ce6ff;">Épée：</span><br>
Yeah... It's all dark and empty...<br>
<span style="color:#ffc960;">Queen Elizabeth META：</span><br>
The train hasn't begun its transformation yet.<br>
Honestly... Maybe we ought to use another car as the foundation for the concept of this lovely view.<br>
Concept conversion, car 7. Become the foundation of death, anchor the unseeable, and manifest its form!<br>
{{折叠面板|内容结束}}

{{折叠面板|标题=The Martyrium|选项=6|主框=1|样式=primary|展开=是}}
<br>
A light erupts from the empty blackness.<br>
Then, golden arches and a pearly white road appear. A circular city emerges from nothingness to everyone's amazement.<br>
<span style="color:#5ce6ff;">Épée：</span><br>
It's... beautiful...<br>
<span style="color:#5ce6ff;">Brennus：</span><br>
Like a Mirror Sea, a compressed space has been freed, birthing an entire city based on a concept.<br>
All this from an object the size of only a train car. It is truly awe-inspiring.<br>
<span style="color:#5ce6ff;">Mogador：</span><br>
Wooow... I've never seen anything like this before.<br>
This must be how Béarn manipulates space using reality anchors.<br>
<span style="color:#5ce6ff;">Fleuret：</span><br>
Reality anchors? What're those?<br>
<span style="color:#5ce6ff;">Mogador：</span><br>
They're a reality-stabilizing technology used in Basilicas all the time.<br>
As their name suggests, they can anchor all kinds of concepts. In this city's case, the concept of death.<br>
Béarn would be sooo excited if she could see this. Shame she's not here.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
(This doesn't really FEEL like a city based on the idea of death, though. It more brings to mind images of brilliance and holiness.)<br>
(Is it down to interpretation? Is this how Alsace views death?)<br>
<span style="color:#5ce6ff;">Fleuret：</span><br>
Alsace, does this city have, like, a name?<br>
<span style="color:#5ce6ff;">Alsace：</span><br>
Hm? Not that one knows of.<br>
<span style="color:#5ce6ff;">Brennus：</span><br>
A splendid structure of gold and marble to commemorate death...<br>
This brings to mind an idea – the Martyrium. How does that sound for a name?<br>
<span style="color:#5ce6ff;">Alsace：</span><br>
The Martyrium... A shrine built atop a grave, yes? One approves of this idea!<br>
<span style="color:#ffc960;">Queen Elizabeth META：</span><br>
It's a good name. Let's call it that.<br>
While you likely aren't conscious of it, it is good to name things according to your concept of them.<br>
If others accept the concept, it then... Bah, never mind that.<br>
A small problem has cropped up.<br>
We're unable to anchor the concept properly. The space the whale is occupying won't fully manifest in reality.<br>
Our spatial impact event was strong, but the amount of data within the folded space is simply mind-boggling... Even a whole train car could only unfold this much.<br>
<span style="color:#5ce6ff;">The Whale：</span><br>
......<br>
<br>
With a booming rumble, the whale suddenly appears in the sky above the Martyrium.<br>
<span style="color:#5ce6ff;">Miss D：</span><br>
The whale! My whale is here!<br>
<span style="color:#ffc960;">Queen Elizabeth META：</span><br>
Oh. So that was still all it took to lure it out.<br>
<span style="color:#5ce6ff;">Miss D：</span><br>
Elizabeth, start the train! We've got to catch my whale!<br>
<span style="color:#ffc960;">Queen Elizabeth META：</span><br>
Don't be so hasty. The Martyrium is a stand-alone space akin to a Mirror Sea. We cannot catch the whale without entering the space.<br>
<span style="color:#5ce6ff;">Miss D：</span><br>
Then do it! Go to the city! Start the train NOW!<br>
<span style="color:#ffc960;">Queen Elizabeth META：</span><br>
You can be such a pest... Fine, starting the engine now.<br>
...Wait. The whale isn't alone.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
What do you mean? There are others?<br>
<span style="color:#ffc960;">Queen Elizabeth META：</span><br>
METAs, to be precise. Two groups, one of which is uncamouflaged. Wichita and Kimberly.<br>
Judging by this duo... it's the Ashes.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Even all the way out here, we're still running into them...<br>
(But, one of our own is working with them – Friedrich. Maybe we can ask them about Enterprise, or Hiryuu.)<br>
<span style="color:#ffc960;">Queen Elizabeth META：</span><br>
The other group is camouflaged. We can't identify them at this range.<br>
Only we know about the whale, so they're most likely here only to investigate the spatial impact event.<br>
As if we didn't have enough to deal with...<br>
<span style="color:#5ce6ff;">Miss D：</span><br>
They WILL know about the whale as soon as they look up!<br>
Start the damn train already! Or they'll get to it first!<br>
<span style="color:#ffc960;">Queen Elizabeth META：</span><br>
STOP! RUSHING! US! Furthermore, we don't know who we're up against! Rushing in blindly will be our death!<br>
For now, everyone will stay put inside the train. We shall go and scope things out.<br>
The Queen's Light's anti-conceptual defences are impregnable. You'll be safe here while we're out.<br>
Commander, I've heard you're an excellent babysitter. Watch this sassy child in our absence! Make sure she doesn't run off.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
You got it.<br>
<span style="color:#5ce6ff;">Miss D：</span><br>
Why would I run away from the assistant? Just go and come back quick!<br>

<br>
Sometime earlier...<br>
<span style="color:#ffc960;">Wichita META：</span><br>
Is this it, Kimberly? Are we at the origin point of the spatial distortion?<br>
<span style="color:#ffc960;">Kimberly META：</span><br>
Soon – we're close. It's strange, though... there are no wreckages to be seen here.<br>
According to theory, there should be loads of them.<br>
<span style="color:#ffc960;">Wichita META：</span><br>
I've not seen ANYTHING, for that matter. The whole branch has literally been erased.<br>
There's only one explanation.<br>
The impact released so much energy that the space completely lost stability.<br>
It wiped away the real-world foundation of the entire branch and the test site with it, folding it into a higher dimension. Would explain why we can't see squat from outside.<br>
<span style="color:#ffc960;">Kimberly META：</span><br>
Simple. Just cause another spatial impact to create a pathway.<br>
<span style="color:#ffc960;">Wichita META：</span><br>
My thoughts exactly. Good thing I have a machine that can do just that.<br>
Lead the way. I've got a real fireworks show for ya.<br>
<br>
As the two Ashes were drafting a plan, they saw the light of the Martyrium on the horizon.<br>
<span style="color:#ffc960;">Kimberly META：</span><br>
...Wichita?<br>
<span style="color:#ffc960;">Wichita META：</span><br>
I see it.<br>
Someone rebuilt the foundation with a conceptual anchor, unfolding the space. Guess that's one way of doing it.<br>
<span style="color:#ffc960;">Kimberly META：</span><br>
Whoever did it is hiding themselves.<br>
<span style="color:#ffc960;">Wichita META：</span><br>
They're doing it damn well, too. My radar's got nothing.<br>
Forget about that city, though – see the whale in the sky? You recognize it?<br>
<span style="color:#ffc960;">Kimberly META：</span><br>
Arbiter XIII... Death.<br>
She's here. Maybe even to do the same thing as we are.<br>
<span style="color:#ffc960;">Wichita META：</span><br>
Either way, let's hurry. We gotta kill the target first, or we'll have wasted our time coming here.<br>
<span style="color:#ffc960;">Kimberly META：</span><br>
And ignore whoever rebuilt the foundation?<br>
<span style="color:#ffc960;">Wichita META：</span><br>
Don't give a damn. We'll find 'em sooner or later.<br>
If they're friendly, we'll talk it out. If they're not, we'll duke it out. Either way, they're not stopping us!<br>

<br>
Meanwhile, elsewhere...<br>
<span style="color:#bdbdbd;">Hatakaze META：</span><br>
Well, well... We just got here, and already we're seeing a spectacle.<br>
A conceptual anchor. Impressive. Do you have any guess as to whose, Devil?<br>
<span style="color:#5ce6ff;">Arbiter: The Devil XV：</span><br>
Not a single clue. They've perfectly concealed themselves.<br>
All I know is that they smell like they're from test site beta.<br>
<span style="color:#bdbdbd;">Hatakaze META：</span><br>
You mean the branch where Pamiat' ran into big trouble? Interesting.<br>
How can you tell?<br>
<span style="color:#5ce6ff;">Arbiter: The Devil XV：</span><br>
Arbiters have their secrets, too.<br>
<span style="color:#bdbdbd;">Hatakaze META：</span><br>
Fine. And the whale flying in the sky? What the hell is that about?<br>
<span style="color:#5ce6ff;">Arbiter: The Devil XV：</span><br>
What, you don't know?<br>
<span style="color:#bdbdbd;">Hatakaze META：</span><br>
The things I don't know could fill your whole database.<br>
You realized I only just escaped that place, yes? For now, all I can see are glimpses of things.<br>
<span style="color:#5ce6ff;">Arbiter: The Devil XV：</span><br>
Hahah. Okay, I'll tell you. That thing is a huge deal.<br>
And I mean huge. You'll be set for life if you can capture it.<br>
<span style="color:#bdbdbd;">Hatakaze META：</span><br>
Uh-huh. Are you going to tell me what it is or not?<br>
<span style="color:#5ce6ff;">Arbiter: The Devil XV：</span><br>
Nope. If you don't know, I'm not obligated to tell you. I'm not your mom.<br>
Buuut, I've heard that "They" are looking for it, and will grant a hefty reward for its return.<br>
<span style="color:#bdbdbd;">Hatakaze META：</span><br>
Really? Then I have to get my hands on it.<br>
No, wait, first I need to know the concept tied to that foundation. I will not be a fool and rush in blindly.<br>
<span style="color:#5ce6ff;">Arbiter: The Devil XV：</span><br>
You don't recognize the concept? I do.<br>
It's Death.<br>

<br>
Mirror Rail "Queen's Light"<br>
Car 5<br>
Present Time<br>
15 minutes have passed since Elizabeth left the train. We who stayed behind are lounging around as we wait for her to return.<br>
Miss D threw a tantrum earlier, lasting 5 minutes. Now she's just sitting quietly in a corner.<br>
Meanwhile, some of us are idly gazing out the windows at the mysterious city.<br>
<span style="color:#5ce6ff;">Brennus：</span><br>
Building such a splendid city simply by picturing it. Can you imagine that?<br>
We are all blessed to have witnessed this.<br>
<span style="color:#5ce6ff;">Fleuret：</span><br>
While we're here, we should take a picture!<br>
Hang on, lemme find my camera...<br>
<span style="color:#5ce6ff;">Alsace：</span><br>
If you wish to record it for posterity, one has already done so and is preparing to compile a report for the Cardinal.<br>
<span style="color:#5ce6ff;">Fleuret：</span><br>
No, not for posterity! For us! I'm talking about taking a picture as a keepsake!<br>
<span style="color:#5ce6ff;">Alsace：</span><br>
One has... questions about the practical purposes of doing so.<br>
<span style="color:#5ce6ff;">Fleuret：</span><br>
It's to show other people and say, "Look! We were here!"<br>
Like, we're the only ones who'll ever come here. They'll be so jelly when they see a picture of how pretty this place is!<br>
<span style="color:#5ce6ff;">Alsace：</span><br>
Uh-huh... Thought processor RPM is rapidly increasing...<br>
<span style="color:#5ce6ff;">Épée：</span><br>
Fl-Fleur, please don't mess with her like that...<br>
<span style="color:#5ce6ff;">Fleuret：</span><br>
I'm serious here! Don't you wanna show a pic to Tem and Opie and see the looks on their faces?<br>
<span style="color:#5ce6ff;">Épée：</span><br>
All I want is to go home and be alone.<br>
<span style="color:#5ce6ff;">Fleuret：</span><br>
Oh. Alrighty then.<br>
<span style="color:#5ce6ff;">Miss D：</span><br>
Brrrrr...<br>
<span style="color:#5ce6ff;">Fleuret：</span><br>
What's wrong, Miss D?<br>
<br>
Miss D has huddled up in her little corner and started shaking like a leaf.<br>
<span style="color:#5ce6ff;">Miss D：</span><br>
Cold... It's so cold in here! Don't you feel it? It's freezing!<br>
<span style="color:#5ce6ff;">Fleuret：</span><br>
Uh... Not really?<br>
<span style="color:#5ce6ff;">Alsace：</span><br>
One's body temperature remains stable.<br>
<span style="color:#5ce6ff;">Épée：</span><br>
Should I, um, get you a blanket?<br>
<span style="color:#5ce6ff;">Miss D：</span><br>
No! There's an intruder! Someone's snuck aboard the train!<br>
That's why it's so cold! I'm freezing my butt off!<br>
<span style="color:#5ce6ff;">Mogador：</span><br>
*sniff sniff*... Yeah, I'm smelling something, and it's not the Commander...<br>
It's corrupt and damp, the stench of depressing death...<br>
<span style="color:#5ce6ff;">Alsace：</span><br>
One's olfactory system isn't detecting anything. Could it be... the system is malfunctioning?<br>
<span style="color:#5ce6ff;">Mogador：</span><br>
I guess it's not strictly a smell, more like an aura. I've worked as a Tribunal judge for a long time, so I've developed a keen sense for these things.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Didn't Elizabeth say the train's conceptual defenses are impregnable?<br>
Although, if both you and Miss D sense something is wrong, I don't think that's a coincidence.<br>
Nobody panic, alright? Let's contact Elizabeth before anything else.<br>
<span style="color:#5ce6ff;">Miss D：</span><br>
The assistant is right! Call her!<br>
<span style="color:#ffc960;">Queen Elizabeth META：</span><br>
We double-checked. There is no sign of any intruder.<br>
<span style="color:#5ce6ff;">Miss D：</span><br>
There IS an intruder! They're getting closer and closer!<br>
They're only 1 car away! The barriers between them are useless! Heeelp!<br>
<span style="color:#ffc960;">Queen Elizabeth META：</span><br>
Alright, we trust your intuition.<br>
What we don't understand is how this intruder could break in without leaving a single trace along the way...<br>
No matter. Gather everyone in a single car and we'll be right there.<br>
Incidentally, we identified the other group that arrived here. One of them is an Arbiter – The Devil XIV. You surely know all about her.<br>
The other, it seems, is a META. We haven't yet figured out who, though.<br>
Hang in there. We're coming.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
(Devil? And a META is accompanying her?)<br>
(That's really bad news. We need to assume a defensive formation...)<br>
<span style="color:#5ce6ff;">Mogador：</span><br>
Hm? Commander, do you want us to prepare a defense?<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Yeah. You can smell where the intruder is coming from, right?<br>
<span style="color:#5ce6ff;">Mogador：</span><br>
Sure can!<br>
<br>
Mogador points at the door connecting to the next train car.<br>
<span style="color:#5ce6ff;">Mogador：</span><br>
I thiiink the best strategy is if me, Alsace, and Brennus go to the next car and intercept the intruder while the rest of you just stay here.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
(On one hand, it divides our force. On the other, it gives them more room to fight and guarantees we have an escape route.)<br>
Let's do that. Everyone else, keep an eye out for the enemy!<br>
{{折叠面板|内容结束}}

{{折叠面板|标题=The Faker|选项=10|主框=1|样式=primary|展开=是}}
<br>
Alsace, Mogador, and Brennus leave the train car while the rest of us stay behind.<br>
Little by little, I can feel the approaching hostile presence become palpable.<br>
<span style="color:#5ce6ff;">Mogador：</span><br>
Commandeeer! We've entered car 3 and I can see something.<br>
There's this... black mist coiling around, and some kind of white thing floating in the air.<br>
Hoo boy, they have an intense presence. I see why Miss D was terrified now.<br>
If fear had a smell, this place would reek of it.<br>
<span style="color:#5ce6ff;">Brennus：</span><br>
The sound of death drawing near. A quiet yet intense noise...<br>
<span style="color:#5ce6ff;">Alsace：</span><br>
I'm going to temporarily deactivate my emotion module. That should make me, uh, not afraid!<br>
<br>
Despite the considerable distance between us, the aura of death is clear as day.<br>
An inexpressible pressure leaks through the cracks in the door, acting on my body as though it were a physical thing.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
(Rotting and damp – the stench of overwhelming death. Yeah, Mogador, you hit the nail on the head with those words.)<br>
<span style="color:#5ce6ff;">Miss D：</span><br>
I'm scared! I'm scaaared!<br>
No, no, nooo! How did something so terrifying get inside the train?!<br>
<span style="color:#5ce6ff;">Épée：</span><br>
I'm not scared, I'm not scared, I'm not scared...<br>
My friends are here, so I'm not scared...<br>
<span style="color:#5ce6ff;">Miss D：</span><br>
Don't kid yourself! You're trembling as much as anyone else!<br>
<span style="color:#5ce6ff;">Épée：</span><br>
I-I can't help it... I'm so scared I feel like I could die!<br>
<span style="color:#5ce6ff;">Miss D：</span><br>
Me toooooo!<br>
<span style="color:#5ce6ff;">Fleuret：</span><br>
Whatever's coming, it's bad. BAD.<br>
Don't know how long I can hold out against it... but I'm not giving up without a fight.<br>
Commander, fall back to car 6! I'll hold the line somehow!<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
(This is getting dire already...)<br>
<span style="color:#5ce6ff;">Mogador：</span><br>
Hey, Commander, do we start attacking yet?<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
(I don't doubt their combat ability, it's just that we'll suffer serious casualties if we end up picking a fight with an Arbiter.)<br>
(But what's the alternative? There are only so many cars left to retreat to...)<br>
<span style="color:#5ce6ff;">Mogador：</span><br>
Umm, the enemy has entered car 4. They'll get the first strike in if we don't do something now.<br>
<br>
I look through the glass of the connecting door. There, in car 4, I see it – something floating in the air, covered in a black mist, coming straight toward me.<br>
<span style="color:#ff9b93;">??? XIII：</span><br>
Hahh...<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
(God dammit. Better to do SOMETHING than to just sit here.)<br>
Mogador! Open fi–<br>
<span style="color:#5ce6ff;">Miss D：</span><br>
Wait! Stop, stop, stop!<br>
<br>
Just before I can issue the order, Miss D jumps in front of me and interrupts me.<br>
<span style="color:#5ce6ff;">Miss D：</span><br>
I know now! I know who the intruder is!<br>
A faker! She's a faker!<br>
A faker, faker, faker!<br>
She's a stupid darn faker!<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Calm down. What do you mean, "faker"?<br>
<span style="color:#5ce6ff;">Miss D：</span><br>
It's all her fault I couldn't catch the whale! And she only got this far because she's a faker!<br>
She didn't force her way inside the train! She imitated my whole concept and fooled her way in!<br>
<span style="color:#5ce6ff;">Mogador：</span><br>
She... imitated your concept? So she's, like, the same as you?<br>
So if you're an Arbiter, that means this enemy is one, too... But what's her name?<br>
<span style="color:#5ce6ff;">Miss D：</span><br>
Who cares about her name?! What matters is you'll die if you fought me, and you'll die if you fight her!<br>
Get out of there! Ruuun!<br>
<span style="color:#5ce6ff;">Brennus：</span><br>
We cannot abandon the Swordbearer's mission. Furthermore, what solution is running away?<br>
<span style="color:#5ce6ff;">Épée：</span><br>
If we can't stop her, we'll have to abandon the train entirely...<br>
<span style="color:#5ce6ff;">Miss D：</span><br>
That's what I'm saying! Screw the train and go to the Martyrium!<br>
<span style="color:#5ce6ff;">Fleuret：</span><br>
No, you can't be serious! How would we even go there in the first place?<br>
<span style="color:#5ce6ff;">Alsace：</span><br>
One could materialize her rigging for you all to ride... However, the navigability of this space is highly uncertain.<br>
Without air, one's engines cannot run – moreover, the Commander will asphyxiate.<br>
<span style="color:#5ce6ff;">Miss D：</span><br>
Don't be dumb! I'm not talking about going out THERE!<br>
The Martyrium was manifested using the 7th car, remember? It has to be connected to the 6th car!<br>
We'll go through the door and end up there! Come on, get back here now!<br>
<span style="color:#5ce6ff;">Fleuret：</span><br>
Wait, that's how it works?<br>
<span style="color:#5ce6ff;">Alsace：</span><br>
One's thought processor is beginning to overheat...<br>
<span style="color:#5ce6ff;">Mogador：</span><br>
That sounds like a stretch, but maybe she's right?<br>
<span style="color:#5ce6ff;">Miss D：</span><br>
There's no time to argue! Assistant, tell them to retreat NOW! Do it, do it, do it!<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
If the car connects straight to the city, why didn't Elizabeth just use that route?<br>
<span style="color:#5ce6ff;">Miss D：</span><br>
Because she's a stupid moron and you're not!<br>
<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项1：(This is getting dire already...)</span>'''''<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项2：Alright, fine!</span>'''''<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Fleuret, go to car 4 and pick up Alsace's team! We'll link up in car 6 and retreat through the door to the Martyrium!<br>
<span style="color:#5ce6ff;">Miss D：</span><br>
There we go! Run! Run, everybody!<br>

<br>
Holding Miss D's hand, I step through the door into the 7th car. Suddenly, I am thrust into nothingness.<br>
My sense of time, space, and even self all become hazy, and it's like a mighty force is pulling me apart.<br>
Thought by thought, it feels like my mind is becoming one with this endless void.<br>
<span style="color:#c3abff;">???：</span><br>
Have you ever thought about death? About what it means to these girls? It is neither an end, nor a release for them.<br>
<br>
Just as it feels like I'll disappear, a familiar voice speaks to me.<br>
<span style="color:#c3abff;">???：</span><br>
For better or for worse, they will never truly die as long as they're remembered by people.<br>
Death, furthermore, is not a one-way trip for them as it is for us.<br>
"Dead" and "living" are no more than states of being to them.<br>
Every time they live, and every time they die, a little more information is simply added to their names.<br>
From a dialectic perspective, death is neither good nor bad for them. It's a neutral concept.<br>
Remember this, it's important – they form a collective of countless fragments of data until they are given individual bodies.<br>
It is possible to replicate the individual offshoots of this collective. I gave this power to Death.<br>
<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项1：Miss D?</span>'''''<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项2：Anzeel?</span>'''''<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项3：Aoste?</span>'''''<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项4：Who are you?</span>'''''<br>
<span style="color:#5ce6ff;">Miss D：</span><br>
...Hey! Don't just stand there!<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
(That was Miss D's voice... but something's off. Is she not aware of what she just said?)<br>
<span style="color:#5ce6ff;">Miss D：</span><br>
Hey! Moron! Way to go getting separated and freaking everyone out!<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
...What? You thought I brought you here?<br>
<span style="color:#5ce6ff;">Miss D：</span><br>
No, obviously not! Why'd you even come here? You'll literally fall apart if you stay any longer!<br>
Take my hand! I'll get you out!<br>
<br>
I grab hold of Miss D's hand. The blank void vanishes with a snap, giving way to golden light.<br>
I stand in a city carved from marble, arches of gold spanning overhead. The scent of the Iris countryside fills the air, as does faint, serene cathedral music.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
(This is the Martyrium... I made it.)<br>
<span style="color:#5ce6ff;">Alsace：</span><br>
Thank heavens you're okay, Commander! You just disappeared on us, and I thought you were gone...<br>
<span style="color:#5ce6ff;">Miss D：</span><br>
Hah, you're naive! Nobody goes gone if I decide so!<br>
<span style="color:#5ce6ff;">Brennus：</span><br>
Another miracle to the Swordbearer's name. It's a relief that you're unharmed.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Sorry if I scared you all. I just got a bit lost.<br>
<span style="color:#5ce6ff;">Miss D：</span><br>
"A bit" lost! You're the ONLY one who did! You're such a moron!<br>
<span style="color:#5ce6ff;">Alsace：</span><br>
Such insolence! You know, one's databanks say that those who call others morons are usually morons themselves!<br>
<span style="color:#5ce6ff;">Miss D：</span><br>
Sure, moron! I only call morons morons!<br>
<span style="color:#5ce6ff;">Alsace：</span><br>
Lies! One would never accept that the Commander is a moron!<br>
<span style="color:#5ce6ff;">Fleuret：</span><br>
Ugh... What is this, the playground? Stop arguing like a pair of kids.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
They'll tire eventually. More importantly, where'd the intruder go?<br>
<span style="color:#5ce6ff;">Fleuret：</span><br>
I think we shook her off.<br>
<span style="color:#5ce6ff;">Mogador：</span><br>
I love getting off– I mean, shaking off an enemy.<br>
Also, now we know concepts can ignore things like, you know, physical distance between two points in space...<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
(Technically, we're in a Mirror Sea, so maybe that's how this miracle was possible. I wonder if the Sirens' teleporters and artificial fog function in a similar vein...)<br>
<span style="color:#5ce6ff;">Miss D：</span><br>
Ugh... Whatever! The assistant ISN'T a moron! There! Happy now?<br>
<span style="color:#5ce6ff;">Alsace：</span><br>
One has won this argument!<br>
<br>
Alsace triumphantly places her hands on her hips and basks in her strategic victory.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Good. Now, Miss D, will that enemy come after us?<br>
<span style="color:#5ce6ff;">Miss D：</span><br>
"That enemy"... I hate how that sounds! She needs a name!<br>
Something like... I know! Death's Shadow!<br>
Yeah! I don't care what she thinks, we're gonna call her that!<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
(Is this another case of "the importance of a concept"?)<br>
Okay. Is Death's Shadow going to come after us?<br>
<span style="color:#5ce6ff;">Miss D：</span><br>
Anything I can do, she can do! Which means yeah, she will! Unless she's a total moron!<br>
But forget about her, there's something more important! We've reached the Martyrium, remember?<br>
And what are we here to do? Catch the whale! Whale tiiime!<br>
<br>
Miss D points a finger at the whale swimming through the sky as she jumps around ecstatically.<br>
But, before we can catch the whale...<br>
<span style="color:#ffc960;">Queen Elizabeth META：</span><br>
What?! The enemy breached the train's defences because their concepts are one and the same?!<br>
That does explain why we couldn't detect an intrusion from far away... The fact we can't detect her now either likely means she moved elsewhere.<br>
We just got back inside the train. Needless to say, there is no trace of... "Death's Shadow" to be found anywhere.<br>
<span style="color:#5ce6ff;">Alsace：</span><br>
Elizabeth, Miss D called you a moron earlier for not using the direct route through the 6th car's door.<br>
<span style="color:#ffc960;">Queen Elizabeth META：</span><br>
Did she, now? No sweets for her for a month.<br>
<span style="color:#5ce6ff;">Miss D：</span><br>
Why?!<br>
<span style="color:#ffc960;">Queen Elizabeth META：</span><br>
Did you consider WHY we didn't use that route? Because it significantly raises the risk of a pursuer following us into the train.<br>
<span style="color:#5ce6ff;">Miss D：</span><br>
Oh...<br>
<span style="color:#ffc960;">Queen Elizabeth META：</span><br>
Yes, now you know. Stay put and we'll be there shortly.<br>
<span style="color:#5ce6ff;">Miss D：</span><br>
No, don't come here! You weren't supposed to be here to begin with!<br>
<span style="color:#ffc960;">Queen Elizabeth META：</span><br>
Come again? So what is your plan – to confront Devil without us?<br>
<span style="color:#5ce6ff;">Miss D：</span><br>
Nuh-uh! No confrontations! I'm gonna catch the whale then bail!<br>
We can't let it get away again! You've gotta stay there and make the Mirror Sea and the concept stable!<br>
Make it super-duper stable! Then it will be trapped in here!<br>
<span style="color:#ffc960;">Queen Elizabeth META：</span><br>
Out of the question! We'll run out of resources if we make it any stabler!<br>
Or what, are you seriously telling us to use ANOTHER train car?!<br>
<span style="color:#5ce6ff;">Miss D：</span><br>
You can always turn it back! If the whale gets away now, who knows if we'll ever catch it!<br>
<span style="color:#ffc960;">Queen Elizabeth META：</span><br>
Tsk. So be it. Nothing ventured, nothing gained, we suppose.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
I'm with Miss D on this. Please do it.<br>
<span style="color:#ffc960;">Queen Elizabeth META：</span><br>
Very well. We shall support you as best as we can from the train.<br>
In the worst-case scenario, we'll come and rescue you. Now, off you go. Enjoy the Martyrium.<br>
<span style="color:#5ce6ff;">Miss D：</span><br>
You heard her, everybody. Let's go catch that whale!<br>

<br>
With Elizabeth's cooperation, our team starts heading toward the whale.<br>
At first, we walked, until we realized that the "clouds" around us had identical properties to water. So the girls deployed their riggings.<br>
We should be able to reach the whale by traveling from cloud to cloud.<br>
Before we do that, though, there's an issue that needs to be resolved.<br>
<span style="color:#5ce6ff;">Mogador：</span><br>
*sniff sniff*... The Commander was right. Somebody's up ahead.<br>
<span style="color:#5ce6ff;">Alsace：</span><br>
What? But one's sensors aren't detecting anything.<br>
<span style="color:#5ce6ff;">Mogador：</span><br>
I think they're using cloaking technology...<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Yeah. That's the Ashes' modus operandi.<br>
<span style="color:#5ce6ff;">Alsace：</span><br>
Signals detected! They are approaching from opposite directions! Requesting orders!<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
(Considering our previous encounters, they probably just want to talk.)<br>
Let's see if we can solve this with words. Stay on your guard, but don't fire the first shot.<br>
I'll try to reason with them.<br>
<br>
The Ashes acknowledge our non-hostile intent and turn off their cloaking devices, showing themselves.<br>
<span style="color:#ffc960;">Wichita META：</span><br>
I'm Wichita, this is Kimberly. We're with the Ashes. You don't look the least bit surprised to see us.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
No. We knew you were here before we even set foot in the Martyrium.<br>
<span style="color:#ffc960;">Wichita META：</span><br>
Set foot in the what now? Oh, you mean this place. You created it, didn't you?<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
You could say that.<br>
<span style="color:#ffc960;">Wichita META：</span><br>
I want to know who exactly. Which one of you did it?<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
I'm afraid I can't tell you. Let's change the topic. What do you say to a cease-fire while we're here?<br>
<span style="color:#ffc960;">Wichita META：</span><br>
Why?<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
I know your Hiryuu and Ark Royal. I've fought side by side with them. Friedrich from our timeline is also working with you.<br>
<span style="color:#ffc960;">Kimberly META：</span><br>
Ahh. So you're the people from test site beta.<br>
<span style="color:#ffc960;">Wichita META：</span><br>
You're test site beta? That explains a lot.<br>
We know all about you. Had a big battle a while back, didn't you?<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
(Big battle? Is she talking about the near-superimposition event? They know more than they let on.)<br>
(Assuming Friedrich has been feeding them intel, maybe I can get these two to agree to a temporary alliance.)<br>
I appreciate what you've done for Friedrich. How's she been holding up?<br>
<span style="color:#ffc960;">Wichita META：</span><br>
Just fine. She's working on something big back at our hideout.<br>
You sure seem to know a lot. I'm guessing you're the Commander I've heard so much about.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
In the flesh.<br>
<span style="color:#ffc960;">Wichita META：</span><br>
Figures. Hiryuu was right – just seeing ya brings back fond memories.<br>
Know what I mean, Kimberly?<br>
<span style="color:#ffc960;">Kimberly META：</span><br>
Yes. I'm... reminded, too.<br>
<span style="color:#ffc960;">Wichita META：</span><br>
A lot has changed since you and Enterprise met. Been making some odd decisions lately. Her letting in Friedrich was one of 'em.<br>
Have to admit, though, she's been doing good.<br>
Tell ya what, I'll bite – who are you, exactly?<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Good question. You're probably familiar with my future self, whereas I'm not. I'd like to know more.<br>
In fact, that's why I'm here. To find out more.<br>
<span style="color:#5ce6ff;">Miss D：</span><br>
I've already told you who you are! You're the mysterious assistant!<br>
<span style="color:#ffc960;">Wichita META：</span><br>
Never heard of a "mysterious assistant" before. Ring any bells, Kimberly?<br>
<span style="color:#ffc960;">Kimberly META：</span><br>
Not sure. If I have any memories of such a person, they're buried deep.<br>
<span style="color:#ffc960;">Wichita META：</span><br>
I'll ask Enterprise later back at the base. You there, the shortie – how do you know the "assistant"?<br>
<span style="color:#5ce6ff;">Miss D：</span><br>
I have a name! It's Miss D!<br>
<span style="color:#ffc960;">Wichita META：</span><br>
Sure ain't a name I've ever heard before. You got something to hide?<br>
<span style="color:#5ce6ff;">Miss D：</span><br>
None of your business! All you need to know is my name is Miss D!<br>
<span style="color:#ffc960;">Wichita META：</span><br>
I don't trust that rat. She's obviously a damn Antiochus! Bet she's a spy who's infiltrated test site beta!<br>
<span style="color:#5ce6ff;">Miss D：</span><br>
YOU'RE a spy!<br>
<span style="color:#ffc960;">Wichita META：</span><br>
Ya hear that? She didn't deny being an Antiochus!<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
She's an Arbiter. Arbiter XIII: Death, to be precise.<br>
<span style="color:#ffc960;">Wichita META：</span><br>
Bullshit. I've fought Death more times than I can remember and that sure ain't her.<br>
Ya see that whale in the sky? THAT'S Death.<br>
<span style="color:#5ce6ff;">Miss D：</span><br>
Huh?! You're a big fat moron! The faker duped you, moron!<br>
<span style="color:#ffc960;">Wichita META：</span><br>
Call me a moron again and you're getting it, you little shit.<br>
<span style="color:#5ce6ff;">Miss D：</span><br>
Eek!<br>
<span style="color:#ffc960;">Kimberly META：</span><br>
She's just a kid. Don't threaten her.<br>
<span style="color:#ffc960;">Wichita META：</span><br>
Sure, she's a kid, and kids need to be put in their place.<br>
Anyway... If that half-pint is with you people, that changes things. We'll leave the Antiochus alone as long as she doesn't mess with us.<br>
We've still gotta do something about that spatial impact event, though. Just hope we won't have to fight each other over it.<br>
That's what you came here for, right? To measure it?<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
In a way. Our goal here is to catch the whale. Getting data on the event is just a side objective.<br>
<span style="color:#ffc960;">Wichita META：</span><br>
Really, huh? We didn't know about the whale 'til we got here. Guessing you knew about it from the start.<br>
That thing is a giant database with fins, you know.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Interesting. So, what's your stance on us working together on this?<br>
There's an Arbiter – Devil – somewhere in this place, and I don't think she's just a vessel. She's our enemy, and yours as well.<br>
<span style="color:#ffc960;">Wichita META：</span><br>
Speak of the devil, as they say... Yeah, we detected her as soon as we stepped inside the... "Martyrium."<br>
But here's the thing. We work best alone.<br>
Best I can do is agree to keep out of your hair if you keep out of ours.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
(I almost forgot the Ashes is filled with lone wolves. If that's how they want it...)<br>
That's fine by me. Good luck on your task.<br>
<span style="color:#ffc960;">Wichita META：</span><br>
Yeah. Same to you.<br>

<br>
The Ashes and we go our separate ways, and we resume our climb toward the whale.<br>
However, we soon see that someone has gotten to the whale before both us and the Ashes.<br>
KABOOOM!<br>
<span style="color:#5ce6ff;">Alsace：</span><br>
The whale is being attacked by what appears to be drones!<br>
<span style="color:#5ce6ff;">Brennus：</span><br>
It's a sizable swarm as well, assuming the form of a net to catch it.<br>
<span style="color:#5ce6ff;">Mogador：</span><br>
Those things look familiar... Oh, I remember! They're Devil's drones!<br>
<span style="color:#5ce6ff;">Miss D：</span><br>
Nooooo! Devil, you big moron! Be gentle! You're gonna kill my whale!<br>
No, wait, it's gonna run away before anything else!<br>
See?! It's already getting ready to leave!<br>
...Wait, what?! Great! The faker's gotten her hands on a new weapon!<br>
<br>
As the whale is surrounded by drones, its body suddenly begins to glow blue.<br>
Every drone touched by the light swiftly loses control and falls to the ground. The whale then turns its dorsal fin and starts swimming for the Martyrium's center at speed.<br>
It reaches the limit of the city's ring, touching the boundary. A spatial distortion occurs, and the whale once more slips off into space.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Dammit. It got away again.<br>
<span style="color:#5ce6ff;">Miss D：</span><br>
Elizabeth! Pick up, Elizabeth!<br>
Use your train to expand the Martyrium! Draw the whale toward us!<br>
<span style="color:#ffc960;">Queen Elizabeth META：</span><br>
Uggghhh...<br>
Concept conversion, car 6. Broaden the horizon of death, materialise the unseeable, and manifest its form!<br>
<br>
A radiant light burst forth from the void once more.<br>
The Mirror Sea's concept is reinforced, expanding the Martyrium with a second ring furnished with gold and marble and arches just like the first.<br>
There, in the air above the second ring, the whale appears again.<br>
<span style="color:#5ce6ff;">Épée：</span><br>
The Martyrium grew even bigger and brighter than before!<br>
<span style="color:#5ce6ff;">Fleuret：</span><br>
Let's see that whale try to run away NOW!<br>
<span style="color:#ffc960;">Queen Elizabeth META：</span><br>
Incredible. We've unfolded so much space, and yet there's still more...<br>
One wonders what terrifying creature caused such a massive spatial distortion...<br>
<span style="color:#5ce6ff;">Miss D：</span><br>
Doesn't matter! All that matters is that it doesn't get away again!<br>
You can't let it happen a third time!<br>
<span style="color:#ffc960;">Queen Elizabeth META：</span><br>
We said we'll do it, remember? Believe us, we won't let it flee.<br>
<span style="color:#5ce6ff;">Miss D：</span><br>
Thank you! You're nice, Elizabeth!<br>
Come on, assistant! We've got to get back to catching the whale!<br>
<span style="color:#5ce6ff;">Alsace：</span><br>
How, though? There's no connecting path to the new ring.<br>
We weren't exactly built for jumping across clouds, so...<br>
<span style="color:#ffc960;">Queen Elizabeth META：</span><br>
Not that you could, anyway. Just like how each train car is independent of the next, the rings are independent of each other.<br>
Remember how certain Mirror Seas have rules for entering or exiting them? These work in a similar way.<br>
In short, the method that worked on the first ring won't work on the second. We must find a new way inside.<br>
<span style="color:#5ce6ff;">Miss D：</span><br>
It's fine! The train cars are connected, so we can go in the same way as we did last time!<br>
Just come with me and we'll get there! Don't worry about the conceptual rule!<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
We should at least know the rules before we start ignoring them. What's the conceptual rule we're dealing with?<br>
<span style="color:#5ce6ff;">Miss D：</span><br>
What do you think? Death! Death is the whole shtick of this place, remember?<br>
Like I said, don't worry about it! Just come along!<br>
The whale isn't gonna wait for us! Hurry!<br>

<br>
Somewhere, in the Martyrium...<br>
<span style="color:#5ce6ff;">Hatakaze META：</span><br>
KABOOOM!<br>
Impressive... I recover and reinforce my body more and more, and every time you knock me down regardless.<br>
You're no ordinary Ashes. You're two of its founding members, are you not?<br>
<span style="color:#ffc960;">Wichita META：</span><br>
Inhibiting your fear of death and instantly reviving... Just a bunch of tricks.<br>
I've seen people like you do it a million times.<br>
I've seen how their minds deteriorate 'til they're just one step away from losing it completely.<br>
So how the hell have you kept your sanity?<br>
Just who the hell are you?<br>
<span style="color:#5ce6ff;">Hatakaze META：</span><br>
KABOOOM!<br>
Blathering away even as you barrage me... You really are a seasoned warrior.<br>
Sadly for you, my secrets are staying with me.<br>
Look at that new ring. They've anchored twice now, creating two Mirror Seas, and still that which is hidden hasn't been revealed.<br>
Whoever caused this spatial fluctuation wields unimaginable power. How I wish I could meet them.<br>
KABOOOM!<br>
<span style="color:#ffc960;">Wichita META：</span><br>
You must think you're real hot shit, looking away during a battle with the Ashes.<br>
I told ya – I've seen your tricks a million times. You think you're invincible?<br>
<span style="color:#bdbdbd;">Hatakaze META：</span><br>
I'm not, and besides, death is only another way to the next destination.<br>
Haven't you realized what concept rules this space and what rules are woven through it?<br>
<span style="color:#ffc960;">Wichita META：</span><br>
Ahahah! Haven't even thought about 'em until now.<br>
Been a long while since I met someone with your take on death. The Antiochus must really love test site beta.<br>
<span style="color:#bdbdbd;">Hatakaze META：</span><br>
It's not that I laugh in the face of death. Death is a prerequisite to entering the second Mirror Sea.<br>
Death is the concept that rules this space. It is where all living things end up.<br>
Moreover, the very concept of death has been redefined here. You literally cannot kill me, no matter what you do.<br>
<span style="color:#ffc960;">Wichita META：</span><br>
I don't need to kill you. I can just tear you to shreds.<br>
Even if you won't die, your wounds ain't going anywhere and you'll eventually run out of energy.<br>
Maybe I can't reduce you to dust – or maybe I can. Only one way to find out.<br>
<span style="color:#5ce6ff;">Hatakaze META：</span><br>
KABOOOM!<br>
<span style="color:#ffc960;">Kimberly META：</span><br>
Your birth was never meant to be. Perish.<br>
<span style="color:#bdbdbd;">Hatakaze META：</span><br>
Now you fancy yourselves the arbiters of who gets to be born, do you?<br>
Tell me, how many people have you killed?<br>
All those souls, snuffed out – did those deaths get you what you wanted?<br>
<span style="color:#ffc960;">Wichita META：</span><br>
Shut up. Every little rat like yourself dead is one less problem for the universe.<br>
Don't think I don't know where your power comes from, who you're colluding with, and what you're planning.<br>
Scum like you don't get to preach morality!<br>
<span style="color:#5ce6ff;">Hatakaze META：</span><br>
KABOOOM!<br>
I'd hoped to make you doubt yourselves, but alas...<br>
You leave me no choice but to grant you your wish.<br>
Our final destination may be the same, but I'll give you a small nudge to get there!<br>
<br>
Somewhere, in the Martyrium...<br>
<span style="color:#5ce6ff;">Arbiter: The Devil XV：</span><br>
Two types of rings... A city?<br>
A new area has appeared. Fancy that.<br>
Assuming that death is the requirement for entry...<br>
––I guess I'll just die.<br>
KABOOOM!<br>
<br>
Away from the Martyrium, between the gate and the train...<br>
<span style="color:#c3abff;">544845544F574552：</span><br>
45 78 65 63 75 74 65 74 72 61 6E 73 70 6F 72 74 70 72 6F 74 6F 63 6F 6C 2E<br>
<br>
Inside what can only be called a battleship, a blue-haired girl stared at a monitor, a gentle expression on her face.<br>
<span style="color:#ffc960;">Helena META：</span><br>
I wasn't expecting those meddlers to be THIS powerful.<br>
I had to call on the Tower's power to finally get here...<br>
And now, they've just stopped.<br>
Maybe they're afraid to face me. I hope so, at least.<br>
Whoever you are, wherever you are...<br>
I will find you and destroy you for hunting the Commander and getting between us!<br>
<br>
Glowing blue fragments shot through the air, lighting up the vast interior of the ship.<br>
<span style="color:#ffc960;">Helena META：</span><br>
......<br>
70% of the matter folded up by the spatial impact event has materialized, divided across two Mirror Seas...<br>
Looks like I'm late, but not TOO late.<br>
The Commander is riiight... there.<br>
Oh? Wichita and Kimberly are here, too?<br>
......<br>
Change of plans. Abort the recycling process and engage the overwrite. Initiate plan E.<br>
Helena, exiting the ship now.<br>

<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
I'm here again...<br>
<br>
I grabbed Miss D's hand and was sent back to the void again.<br>
It stretches on endlessly in all directions. Time and orientation mean nothing here.<br>
Unlike last time, however, my consciousness isn't being wrestled from me. It's like I'm in a protective bubble, augmenting my perception of my surroundings rather than weakening it.<br>
This raised awareness lets me detect something amongst the nothingness.<br>
<span style="color:#bdbdbd;">？？？：</span><br>
Embracing death, one after the next... Is this what you chose?<br>
<span style="color:#bdbdbd;">???：</span><br>
Then "I" made the correct choice.<br>
<br>
A woman's voice devoid of emotion. Close, yet distant, coming closer, yet getting further away.<br>
Someone is speaking to me through the darkness.<br>
<span style="color:#bdbdbd;">???：</span><br>
Life comes from nothing, and to nothing death brings it back.<br>
Oblivion is the answer to all.<br>
You would be wise to accept your demise.<br>
It's better than fighting in vain somewhere between the beginning and the end.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
(She can't be far, but I have no idea where she is.)<br>
(All I know is that she's watching us... Watching the Martyrium.)<br>
(Who is she? And what is this place?)<br>
<span style="color:#c3abff;">???：</span><br>
Really?<br>
Then what if death didn't mean returning to nothingness?<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
(Is that... Miss D? She sounds older, somehow.)<br>
<span style="color:#bdbdbd;">???：</span><br>
What...?<br>
You can hear "my" voice?<br>
Who are you?<br>
<span style="color:#5ce6ff;">Miss D：</span><br>
Mmgh... *gasp*! No, who are YOU? What are you doing with the assistant?!<br>
<span style="color:#bdbdbd;">???：</span><br>
"Assistant"?<br>
<span style="color:#5ce6ff;">Miss D：</span><br>
You heard me! Assistant, why are you here AGAIN? I'm telling you, you WILL get torn apart!<br>
<br>
Miss D points to where I am. This finally alerts the other person to my presence.<br>
<span style="color:#bdbdbd;">???：</span><br>
Someone else... is here?<br>
<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项1：Hey.</span>'''''<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项2：Are you... Rodney?</span>'''''<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项3：I wasn't trying to eavesdrop, I swear.</span>'''''<br>
<span style="color:#bdbdbd;">???：</span><br>
......<br>
Who are you people? Why have you come here?<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Long story short–<br>
<span style="color:#5ce6ff;">Miss D：</span><br>
Shut up, you! There's no time to talk!<br>
Don't make me repeat how dangerous this place is! Come along!<br>
And you, whoever you are! You coming with us?<br>
<span style="color:#bdbdbd;">???：</span><br>
"Me"?<br>
No, "I'm" afraid "I'm" staying here.<br>
<span style="color:#5ce6ff;">Miss D：</span><br>
What do you mean, "no"? Do you LIKE being in this dark, dreary place? Suit yourself, weirdo!<br>
Assistant, we're going back to the Martyrium! Hang on tight and don't get lost a third time!<br>

<br>
As the light recedes, I find myself standing on a beach at sunset.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
(What the hell is this place? Wasn't she bringing me back to the Martyrium?)<br>
<span style="color:#5ce6ff;">Alsace：</span><br>
One has spotted the targets! Miss D and the Commander are uninjured!<br>
<span style="color:#5ce6ff;">Brennus：</span><br>
You had me worried, Swordbearer. You lagged behind us again.<br>
<span style="color:#5ce6ff;">Miss D：</span><br>
This ONLY happens with you every time we warp! If you're doing it on purpose, cut it out!<br>
<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项1：Where even are we?</span>'''''<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项2：If this isn't the Martyrium, what is it?</span>'''''<br>
<span style="color:#5ce6ff;">Mogador：</span><br>
I have no clue, sorry. We just moved on forward, and the next thing I know, here I am.<br>
All I can tell you is it's an island with some decently-sized coral reefs.<br>
<span style="color:#5ce6ff;">Fleuret：</span><br>
Hey, Alsace – you sure this place didn't come from your imagination?<br>
<span style="color:#5ce6ff;">Alsace：</span><br>
One never imagined any sort of island, let alone this particular one!<br>
<span style="color:#5ce6ff;">Fleuret：</span><br>
Okay, then why are we here? Did you make a wrong turn or something, Miss D?<br>
<span style="color:#5ce6ff;">Miss D：</span><br>
I don't make mistakes, full stop! Tell them, Elizabeth!<br>
<span style="color:#ffc960;">Queen Elizabeth META：</span><br>
Miss D did not botch the jump. Your coordinates are, in fact, inside the Martyrium.<br>
Specifically, you're in the second ring that we manifested using our sixth train car. The concept that rules there is still death.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
You're still with us, Elizabeth! I thought our comms would be down.<br>
<span style="color:#ffc960;">Queen Elizabeth META：</span><br>
Your phrasing suggests this is a regular occurrence for you.<br>
Worry not. That will not happen as long as we're backing you up.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
(The improved communicator probably helps, too. In any event, I can better deal with emergencies this way.)<br>
<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项1：Thanks. I'm glad we have you.</span>'''''<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项2：Thank you, Your Majesty. META or not, you can always be counted on!</span>'''''<br>
<span style="color:#ffc960;">Queen Elizabeth META：</span><br>
Yes, and you should be grateful for it!<br>
<span style="color:#5ce6ff;">Fleuret：</span><br>
Are you SURE this is the Martyrium? It looks nothing like the outside.<br>
The second ring looked, you know, just like the first one. Gold, marble, yadda yadda.<br>
<span style="color:#5ce6ff;">Miss D：</span><br>
Because the inside isn't the outside! It's a stand-alone space, just like the train cars!<br>
Does it also confuse you how those look different on the inside, or what?<br>
<span style="color:#5ce6ff;">Fleuret：</span><br>
But these two are COMPLETELY different! A train's interior still looks like a train's interior even if you redecorate it!<br>
<span style="color:#5ce6ff;">Miss D：</span><br>
I mean... Yeah, I guess two manifestations of the concept of death shouldn't look THIS different.<br>
I've got it! The concept probably got all jumbled up 'cause there's too many people here!<br>
This isn't JUST Alsace's idea of death – it's mashed together with someone else's, too. Several people's, in fact!<br>
That's the only explanation for why it looks so different!<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
(Then if this is a mix of concepts, does that mean it's closer to what the space originally looked like?)<br>
<span style="color:#5ce6ff;">Miss D：</span><br>
Hang on... It doesn't just LOOK different, it functions differently, too!<br>
Time is flowing in here!<br>
<span style="color:#5ce6ff;">Mogador：</span><br>
Uh, isn't time a constant? Because it doesn't really start or stop?<br>
<span style="color:#5ce6ff;">Miss D：</span><br>
I'm not talking about OUR time, moron! I mean time is flowing for this space!<br>
Elizabeth didn't make it like that when she materialized the Martyrium.<br>
She didn't, because all we needed was a simple foundation. She made an unchanging space!<br>
But this place is different. The concept of time has been added to it.<br>
That means this isn't a representation of static death anymore – it represents fluid death!<br>
<span style="color:#5ce6ff;">Mogador：</span><br>
Come again? So, like... this space will change as time goes on?<br>
<span style="color:#5ce6ff;">Miss D：</span><br>
Yeah! Exactly that!<br>
Which means I have no idea what's coming!<br>
<span style="color:#5ce6ff;">Brennus：</span><br>
Be that as it may, death is still death. Whatever will happen, it will involve death.<br>
<span style="color:#5ce6ff;">Miss D：</span><br>
You're not wrong!<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
(So it's like a videotape? A tape showing the process of someone dying... Or maybe, of this world dying.)<br>
<br>
Waves lapping at the beach. Tropical plants up on a small hill. It looks like any old island across the Pacific.<br>
However, one thing sets it apart – the building off in the distance.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
(The exterior is a little different from how I remember it, but the silhouette and location match...)<br>
(That's it. It's the Samos Marine Research Institute from the alpha timeline!)<br>
(If my guess is right, then this is a recording of the death of someone from that timeline – or of the "death" of this space.)<br>
<span style="color:#5ce6ff;">Épée：</span><br>
Th-this place creeps me out...<br>
It looks so calm and peaceful, but death is around the corner...<br>
<span style="color:#ffc960;">Queen Elizabeth META：</span><br>
You needn't be so afraid. Death is merely the rule that governs that space and the means to get in, out, and around it.<br>
Dying in there, so to speak, does not spell your literal death. That would only be a concern if the concept were to engulf you.<br>
Apropos of nothing, we checked again and have determined that there is STILL more space to unfold, if you can believe that.<br>
Know that if you need to pursue the whale further, you can use death to get to the next space.<br>
<span style="color:#5ce6ff;">Alsace：</span><br>
A-are you suggesting actually having a brush with death?<br>
One would much prefer to travel using the train cars!<br>
<span style="color:#5ce6ff;">Miss D：</span><br>
Death won't mess with you as long as I'm here. Besides, I have a better idea!<br>
We'll just catch the whale right here and now!<br>
<span style="color:#5ce6ff;">Fleuret：</span><br>
Great idea! Only problem is, I don't see the whale anywhere. It's probably run off again.<br>
<span style="color:#5ce6ff;">Miss D：</span><br>
Nuh-uh! I know it hasn't! It's just hiding somewhere nearby!<br>
Somewhere like... Aha! The sea!<br>
That's GOT to be where it is!<br>
Ready or not, we're going swimming!<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Just a second, Miss D. Don't you recognize this island? And more importantly, that building over there?<br>
<br>
I point to the research institute for her.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
(If she's an Arbiter, she has to know the place Dr. Aoste did his research.)<br>
<span style="color:#5ce6ff;">Miss D：</span><br>
Oh, you mean the Marine Research Institute?<br>
Yeah, I remember it. I think it was my house. Or yours. Or both of ours. Maybe.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
"Maybe"?<br>
<span style="color:#5ce6ff;">Miss D：</span><br>
I'm not sure, okay?! It's just a gut feeling!<br>
All my important memories are stored inside the whale! I won't remember until we catch it!<br>
How come YOU remember being here, anyway?<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
"Remember" isn't really the right word. It's too much to explain right now. Can we just please investigate the institute first?<br>
<span style="color:#5ce6ff;">Mogador：</span><br>
Wait, you recognize this place?<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
I do. It's Samos Island, located in the Bermuda Sea. Well, Samos Island from the future.<br>
<span style="color:#ffc960;">Queen Elizabeth META：</span><br>
From the alpha timeline? You mean to say that this space was built with data from there?<br>
<span style="color:#5ce6ff;">Miss D：</span><br>
Fiiine, we'll do as you say, assistant. We'll investigate the institute and THEN go catch the whale!<br>

<br>
We walk to the institute, my memory of the route guiding us.<br>
It's the same place I went in the Reality Lens and the same place Kronshtadt and her team described, yet stark differences remain.<br>
There are no shops, no stalls, and no facilities catering to tourists. They've all been replaced by defensive installations and barricades.<br>
The mask of peace has come off, revealing the island's true nature as a military base.<br>
All of a sudden, sirens start to blare.<br>
<span style="color:#5ce6ff;">Brennus：</span><br>
An alarm. Who carelessly tripped the security system?<br>
<span style="color:#5ce6ff;">Alsace：</span><br>
One's sensors are detecting nothing... They are working, before you ask.<br>
<span style="color:#5ce6ff;">Mogador：</span><br>
Wasn't me. I'm the one who's been switching off all the systems.<br>
<span style="color:#5ce6ff;">Fleuret：</span><br>
Since when? I had no idea you were doing that!<br>
<span style="color:#5ce6ff;">Épée：</span><br>
You Tribunal people scare me...<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
I don't think any of us tripped it. The alarms are going off across the whole island, and I don't think they activated just to arrest us.<br>
<span style="color:#5ce6ff;">Alsace：</span><br>
But then who did? One does not understand.<br>
<span style="color:#ffc960;">Queen Elizabeth META：</span><br>
An enemy fleet has appeared 50 nautical miles northwest. It seems they're heading your way.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
A fleet? Can you ID them?<br>
<span style="color:#ffc960;">Queen Elizabeth META：</span><br>
They're corrosion entities.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
You mean those things that the black tornadoes spew out and cannot be analyzed?<br>
<span style="color:#ffc960;">Queen Elizabeth META：</span><br>
If you mean corrosion phenomena, yes, but they can manifest through other means.<br>
Remember, they are literal embodiments of corrosion.<br>
As you said, they cannot be meaningfully analysed even up-close.<br>
Or, rather, you CAN, but what you perceive changes slightly each time.<br>
You also cannot capture them, and they don't leave wrecks behind when destroyed. It's as though they don't physically exist.<br>
In a way, they don't. They're shadows projected from a different dimension. Imperfectly, at that.<br>
The data loss caused by the projection process is in fact the reason why they appear as blurs you can't perceive properly.<br>
Think of them as corrupted data. The fact that they're there means the space you're in is being corroded.<br>
Now, it looks like we're dealing with... What? The Revolutionary Front?!<br>
Listen up! Those entities come from the data present in that space!<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
What do you mean?<br>
<span style="color:#ffc960;">Queen Elizabeth META：</span><br>
Just tune in to the frequency we just sent you! Their fleet is broadcasting a message to the island!<br>
<span style="color:#5ce6ff;">Communicator：</span><br>
This is the Revolutionary Front's AO Sector Fleet. We hereby issue an ultimatum to Samos Island.<br>
Hand over the individuals behind the attack on the freighter Poltava, disarm your Enforcers, and immediately destroy all artificial intelligence laboratories on the island.<br>
If our demands are not met in three hours, we will achieve these objectives by force.<br>
It is apparent that Samos Island has become a breeding ground for corruption owing to the Oceanic Federation's policy of neglect.<br>
It is home to experiments – especially on weaponized artificial intelligence – that have never received safety assessments nor been held to ethics guidelines, all in the name of "scientific progress."<br>
These people have put guns in the hands of robots and given the power over life and death to computer programs.<br>
It is exactly that which led to this tragedy. You cannot entrust human lives to machines.<br>
Artificial intelligences armed with weapons are both uncontrollable and extremely dangerous, and the attack on the Poltava proved this.<br>
If these evil machines are left to roam free, it will be the end of humanity.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
(Are they serious? They'll capture the island by force if necessary?)<br>
(They mentioned artificial intelligences and Enforcers... That means the Antiochus, Dr. Aoste's project.)<br>
(Then there was that attack on a freighter. They were vague on details...)<br>
(Seems safe to assume that the Antiochus struck the Poltava and hurt innocent people.)<br>
(In other words, they threatened the safety of the world's oceans, prompting the Revolutionary Front to retaliate.)<br>
Miss D, can you remember what this memory is about?<br>
<span style="color:#5ce6ff;">Miss D：</span><br>
No, not a thing! But it's obviously bad! Bad and I don't like it!<br>
<span style="color:#ffc960;">Queen Elizabeth META：</span><br>
...We are in agreement there.<br>
<span style="color:#5ce6ff;">Mogador：</span><br>
Sounds like both the Eagle Union and the Royal Navy are involved with this island.<br>
Those demands were pretty crazy... They want the scientists to hand over those people, disarm their units, and destroy their lab all in three hours.<br>
You could do maybe two of those in that time, but all three? No way.<br>
<span style="color:#5ce6ff;">Fleuret：</span><br>
I think they were going to use force anyway all along.<br>
<span style="color:#5ce6ff;">Communicator：</span><br>
BEEP BEEP!<br>
<span style="color:#5ce6ff;">Dr. Anzeel：</span><br>
I see you on the security cams, Commander! What are you doing on Samos?<br>
<span style="color:#ffc960;">Queen Elizabeth META：</span><br>
What the–?!<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
(Shh! I'll handle this!)<br>
Ahem. Dr. Anzeel?<br>
<span style="color:#5ce6ff;">Dr. Anzeel：</span><br>
Yes, that's my name! Aoste already bailed, so why are you back here?<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Do you know about the attack on the Poltava? The Revolutionary Front is on the island's doorstep, ready to enact revenge for it.<br>
<span style="color:#5ce6ff;">Dr. Anzeel：</span><br>
Yes, I know about the thing that's filled the world's headlines for days now!<br>
Do you seriously believe that? That the Antiochus would defy protocol and attack a civilian freighter passing by?<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
(That sounds just like what the Sirens we know would do...)<br>
(Considering everything we've witnessed, that definitely isn't beyond the realm of possibility... as much as it pains me to say that to her.)<br>
<span style="color:#5ce6ff;">Dr. Anzeel：</span><br>
"Revenge," my ass... That's just what they want you to think.<br>
The attack was a false flag by the Revolutionary Front. They wanted an excuse to send a fleet to Samos.<br>
Laplace's Demon is nearly finished, and they want to steal it.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
(Laplace's Demon?)<br>
<span style="color:#fef15e;">Dr. Aoste：</span><br>
If we adopt this plan, there may be a chance of success.<br>
However, we must ensure that the jamming device remains operational as long as possible. In the meantime, we'll have to hold the line while evacuations are carried out.<br>
In other words...<br>
<span style="color:#fef15e;">???：</span><br>
We already know this, Dr. Aoste. We've taken it upon ourselves to build upon this framework.<br>
<span style="color:#fef15e;">Dr. Aoste：</span><br>
...I understand. But even if that is the case, everyone has already sustained heavy losses. The actual feasibility of the timeframe you provided must still be carefully evaluated...<br>
If the "Light of Dawn" is ever extinguished, then Laplace's Demon will cease to be. If we have not reached the evacuation threshold at that time, our future operational plans will be impacted.<br>
<span style="color:#fef15e;">Dr. Anzeel：</span><br>
Worry not. I will also help buy time for you.<br>
<span style="color:#fef15e;">Dr. Aoste：</span><br>
Ahem. Dr. Anzeel?<br>
<span style="color:#fef15e;">Dr. Anzeel：</span><br>
I've already issued too many communications through the process of commanding the operation, and they've likely already identified me for destruction.<br>
As long as I can continue to draw their attention, I should be able to alleviate the pressure in other places, giving you more time to implement the plan.<br>
<span style="color:#fef15e;">Dr. Aoste：</span><br>
But, what will happen to you then?<br>
<span style="color:#fef15e;">Dr. Anzeel：</span><br>
After such a fiasco, someone always has to bear the responsibility. Only now, there aren't many people left who can shoulder that burden.<br>
<span style="color:#fef15e;">Dr. Aoste：</span><br>
I see... You can bring your KAN-SEN along as well. However, I would like Code G to accompany my Antiochus if possible.<br>
<span style="color:#fef15e;">Dr. Anzeel：</span><br>
Very well. You can have Enterprise, and whoever else manages to survive.<br>
However, take them as far away from NY City as you can. Never let them return here.<br>
<span style="color:#fef15e;">Dr. Aoste：</span><br>
...Without you here, I'm not sure I'll be able to control them...<br>
<span style="color:#fef15e;">Dr. Anzeel：</span><br>
What happened to the ever-so-wise and stoic Magister? You have no choice but to give those children both a purpose and the responsibility that comes with it, right?<br>
...Even after you "betrayed" us, I still believe we see things eye-to-eye. And I think what you're doing is just. I completely understand you, and I trust that in their hearts, they understand you as well...<br>
I'm sure they'll need some time to accept it, but they will come to understand you one day...<br>
Yes, I'm sure of it...<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
(That's what I heard when I was in the Arcana Sanctum. Is this what that conversation referred to?)<br>
So the Revolutionary Front wants to steal your time machine – Laplace's Demon. Does the Federation know about this?<br>
<span style="color:#5ce6ff;">Dr. Anzeel：</span><br>
Of course it does. They got this far in the first place because the RF had the Federation's tactic permission.<br>
The Federation wants the RF to make the first move and escalate tensions. That way, they don't have to take the blame for starting a war.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Wait... Starting a war?<br>
<span style="color:#5ce6ff;">Dr. Anzeel：</span><br>
Yeah. A war that will erase them from time.<br>
Seize the power to control time, and the world shall be yours.<br>
<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项1：My god...</span>'''''<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项2：They're going to start a World War...</span>'''''<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项3：But that's insane!</span>'''''<br>
<span style="color:#5ce6ff;">Dr. Anzeel：</span><br>
Don't freak out. Aoste and I already have a plan.<br>
Flare – as in, Enterprise and company – will swoop in unannounced and steal Laplace's Demon and make both sides take a chill pill.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Enterprise? You mean... Code G?!<br>
<span style="color:#5ce6ff;">Dr. Anzeel：</span><br>
Look, we've chatted enough and this island is about to become a warzone! You need to get out of here NOW!<br>
<span style="color:#5ce6ff;">Communicator：</span><br>
......<br>
<br>
The communicator falls silent.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
(The tension between the two major players in the alpha timeline is about to boil over into all-out war.)<br>
(But, if Anzeel's and Aoste's plan is a success and Laplace's Demon falls into neither side's hands, then this memory won't have anything to do with death.)<br>
(So what in the world is going to happen here?)<br>
<span style="color:#5ce6ff;">Mogador：</span><br>
Commaaander. Who was that? Do you know her?<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
According to the memory we're in, yes. Why do you ask?<br>
<span style="color:#5ce6ff;">Mogador：</span><br>
Because... she contacted you using the Tribunal's private frequency.<br>
Everyone on this mission, including Elizabeth, is also using it.<br>
This frequency is from OUR timeline, so how did that woman know about it and call us on it like it was the most natural thing in the world?<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
(That's a good point... I've grown so used to our frequencies being jammed or intercepted that I've stopped questioning it.)<br>
<span style="color:#5ce6ff;">Miss D：</span><br>
How she did it doesn't matter!<br>
Didn't you hear her? We need to get out of here, and fast!<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
It's too late for that. If this memory really is a representation of death, Anzeel's and Aoste's plan is going to fall through.<br>
<span style="color:#5ce6ff;">Miss D：</span><br>
Huh? How do you know that?<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Because if it had succeeded, this space wouldn't exist in the first place.<br>

<br>
In the midst of the raging storm, the fleet known as the Flare sails for Samos Island.<br>
<span style="color:#5ce6ff;">Hornet：</span><br>
Aw, man. It was sunny just a little while ago. Why'd it have to go and rain on us?<br>
The weather's so fickle around Samos Island, I swear.<br>
<span style="color:#5ce6ff;">Béarn：</span><br>
The abnormal weather and sea conditions here are side effects of research on Laplace's Demon.<br>
Sometimes, people even report ghost and monster sightings.<br>
<span style="color:#5ce6ff;">Ark Royal：</span><br>
Is it that bad? That's a little spooky...<br>
<span style="color:#5ce6ff;">Kasumi：</span><br>
Kasumi wants to see them.<br>
<span style="color:#5ce6ff;">Takao：</span><br>
With you around, we might just end up meeting some ghosts.<br>
I'd say this storm comes with a silver lining. It makes it easier for us to hide our maneuvers.<br>
<span style="color:#5ce6ff;">Yorktown：</span><br>
The higher-ups put too much faith in Laplace's Demon. They went and stirred up a crisis just because it's "almost done."<br>
And for what? Because they think if things come to all-out war, they can win, and it won't matter? As if anything could be that easy.<br>
<span style="color:#5ce6ff;">Hiryuu：</span><br>
They're not the only crazy ones. The RF came out in full force just to steal the incomplete machine.<br>
<span style="color:#5ce6ff;">Memphis：</span><br>
I can't say I don't empathize. If they waited until it was complete and things went the way the Federation wants, it would already be too late.<br>
<span style="color:#5ce6ff;">Hiryuu：</span><br>
You do have a point!<br>
<span style="color:#5ce6ff;">Enterprise：</span><br>
"Laplace's Demon is meant to serve all mankind. Not as a tool of war, nor as the trigger that ushers the destruction of mankind."<br>
We have to stop them.<br>
<span style="color:#5ce6ff;">La Galissonnière：</span><br>
Of course! In fact, why don't we take it a step further?<br>
Thanks to Dr. Anzeel, we already know her location and the status of the defenses near her.<br>
Why don't we go rescue her, while we're at it?<br>
<span style="color:#5ce6ff;">Marseillaise：</span><br>
Rescuing her is one thing. What happens after that? Will she actually flee with us?<br>
<span style="color:#5ce6ff;">Béarn：</span><br>
That would be unnecessary. Dr. Anzeel is sure to have a plan.<br>
<span style="color:#5ce6ff;">Hornet：</span><br>
Yeah! Even when she was imprisoned, she told us not to come to her rescue. She's just under house arrest right now, so we don't have to go out of our way.<br>
<span style="color:#5ce6ff;">Yorktown：</span><br>
Besides, the more of a mess we make out here, the more dangerous things will be for Dr. Anzeel and the people confined with her.<br>
<span style="color:#5ce6ff;">La Galissonnière：</span><br>
Ooh... My bad!<br>
<span style="color:#5ce6ff;">Kimberly：</span><br>
......<br>
<span style="color:#5ce6ff;">Helena：</span><br>
Enterprise, the Revolutionary Front has issued an ultimatum to Samos Island.<br>
The Federation's ambush fleet has also arrived at their target coordinates.<br>
<span style="color:#5ce6ff;">Enterprise：</span><br>
...Sounds like it's time for us to act.<br>
Wichita, what's the problem? You're awfully quiet today... You nervous, or something?<br>
<span style="color:#5ce6ff;">Wichita：</span><br>
I...<br>
Ahahaha, nah, I've just got a lot on my mind. I'll go scout the area with Kimberly again, try to get my head on straight.<br>
<span style="color:#5ce6ff;">Enterprise：</span><br>
Alright. Don't stray too far from the main fleet.<br>
<span style="color:#5ce6ff;">Wichita：</span><br>
Duh. Don't you worry about me!<br>
...Nobody should hear us around here.<br>
<span style="color:#ffc960;">Wichita META：</span><br>
The beginning of the end... I didn't think we'd be brought back to this day.<br>
<span style="color:#ffc960;">Kimberly META：</span><br>
I can tell that this is the new space manifested by the Martyrium.<br>
But why today? Why is this what it manifested?<br>
<span style="color:#ffc960;">Wichita META：</span><br>
Our concept of death must have mixed into the formula when we entered.<br>
No, to take it even further, maybe our concept of death is so strong that it superseded the beta timeline's perception of the Iris ruins...<br>
Heh. So that means we died today, huh? Hahahaha!<br>
<span style="color:#ffc960;">Kimberly META：</span><br>
Wichita.<br>
<span style="color:#ffc960;">Wichita META：</span><br>
Ah, sorry. That was meant to be a joke.<br>
Can you trace that META Hatakaze?<br>
<span style="color:#ffc960;">Kimberly META：</span><br>
She's in this space, but I can't trace her exact coordinates. She must be in hiding.<br>
But there's no doubt that this space is corroded. The RF and the Federation are all corrosion entities.<br>
<span style="color:#ffc960;">Wichita META：</span><br>
Aha. So that was the point of that whole suicide shtick.<br>
<span style="color:#ffc960;">Kimberly META：</span><br>
Wichita, do you remember that day? Corrosion phenomena appeared back then, too.<br>
We didn't know anything, so we only called them black tornadoes.<br>
<span style="color:#ffc960;">Wichita META：</span><br>
If we can learn the things we overlooked back then, we might just be able to dig out new truths from these fixed memories.<br>
This is a big opportunity.<br>
Heh. We can't change what really transpired, but what about righting the wrongs of the past in our memories?<br>
If we did things differently, made better choices back then...<br>
Could we have made a better future?<br>
<span style="color:#ffc960;">Kimberly META：</span><br>
There's no way to know now, but I certainly don't want to see that tragedy a second time.<br>
<span style="color:#ffc960;">Wichita META：</span><br>
Agreed. Let's do something about it.<br>

<br>
Samos Island - Shortly before<br>
<span style="color:#5ce6ff;">Alsace：</span><br>
One does question one thing.<br>
If Laplace's Demon is such an important machine, why don't they simply take it elsewhere for protection?<br>
<span style="color:#5ce6ff;">Fleuret：</span><br>
Who knows? Maybe it's too big to carry that easily?<br>
<span style="color:#5ce6ff;">Alsace：</span><br>
If the plan is for Flare to steal it, then it should be small enough to carry in one's personal storage, no?<br>
If shipgirls can do it, then surely the Antiochus can, too...<br>
<span style="color:#5ce6ff;">Brennus：</span><br>
Simply stealing it is one thing. The way out is fraught with danger.<br>
Perhaps the best way to see a well-protected target transported to a safer location is to let it be stolen without a fight.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
That might be the doctor's exact plan.<br>
<span style="color:#5ce6ff;">Fleuret：</span><br>
So how do we fit into all this?<br>
<span style="color:#5ce6ff;">Alsace：</span><br>
Do we contact the Revolutionary Front, tell them it's a Federation trap, and hope they give up the fight?<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
I doubt that would help. The completion of Laplace's Demon is a life-or-death problem for the RF.<br>
Trap or not, they can't afford to back out that easily.<br>
Besides... I don't think they're likely to trust us.<br>
<span style="color:#5ce6ff;">Miss D：</span><br>
I know! Let's call Aoste and have him hide Laplace's Demon!<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Absolutely not. That would cement them as enemies of the Federation.<br>
Further, if he could hide it without anyone's knowledge, he wouldn't need to get Flare to steal it.<br>
It's starting to look like we only have one option.<br>
<span style="color:#5ce6ff;">Fleuret：</span><br>
Oh! Are you gonna kick both of their butts at once, Commander?<br>
<span style="color:#5ce6ff;">Épée：</span><br>
Fleur, that's obviously not the plan!<br>
<span style="color:#5ce6ff;">Mogador：</span><br>
You're going to try and get your hands on Laplace's Demon first, aren't you?<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
That's right. Leaving things as they are means that the status quo stays intact – this space is engulfed by the concept of death. Therefore, our interference is what'll have to change things.<br>
(This is only assuming that Flare failed to steal it, though.)<br>
(If the problem lies in the doctors' method of salvaging the situation, then...)<br>
(No, now isn't the time to hesitate. It's time for action.)<br>
<br>
Shortly after...<br>
We've approached the Samos Marine Research Institute with Miss D in tow.<br>
Apart from automated sentries, they ran into no security staff along the way.<br>
That alone reinforces Dr. Anzeel's Federation false flag claims.<br>
KABOOOM!<br>
<span style="color:#5ce6ff;">Alsace：</span><br>
The sound of battle?<br>
<span style="color:#5ce6ff;">Mogador：</span><br>
It's been three hours already. The RF and Antiochus must be fighting by now, right?<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
You're close to Laplace's Demon. Hurry and secure it before Flare can.<br>
<span style="color:#ffc960;">Wichita META：</span><br>
Hm? Wait, that's...<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
(That's the META Wichita. So they ended up here too, did they?)<br>
(Now that I think about it, they might be the ones this memory belongs to... Takao, Enterprise...)<br>
(The Flare burns out, and all that's left is Ashes...)<br>
<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项1：Were the Ashes originally Flare all along?</span>'''''<br>
<span style="color:#ffc960;">Wichita META：</span><br>
Well, that's one way to greet someone.<br>
Little late to figure that out. You're right, but not all the way there.<br>
The survivors of Flare are among the Ashes, yes... But as the name implies, we're very literally what was left behind.<br>
The fact that you'd press on, even knowing that, means that you're still totally clueless.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Are you and Kimberly the ones who experienced this event in the alpha timeline?<br>
<span style="color:#ffc960;">Wichita META：</span><br>
...I have nothing to say on that matter.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Sorry. Let me change the subject, then.<br>
I got a call from Dr. Anzeel. She told me the RF and Federation's plans, along with what Flare is trying to do.<br>
<span style="color:#ffc960;">Wichita META：</span><br>
The doctor contacted you?!<br>
I don't know why she would contact YOU, but... she's under strict surveillance. She had to move mountains just to contact us.<br>
Contacting you specifically, and from Samos...<br>
No, if she told you Flare's plan, too, then that's all the more suspicious...<br>
So? What are you planning? Going to steal Laplace's Demon before Flare gets to it?<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Yeah. We know that leaving this situation to play out normally would result in the death of this whole area.<br>
And personally, I don't want Flare getting involved in this, either.<br>
<span style="color:#ffc960;">Wichita META：</span><br>
You're a weird one... but alright. I'm with you there.<br>
Don't worry. Flare isn't coming.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
They're not?<br>
<span style="color:#ffc960;">Wichita META：</span><br>
Yeah, they're not. We already got them all out of the area to keep them away from what's about to happen.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Did you and Kimberly come to steal Laplace's Demon, too, then?<br>
<span style="color:#ffc960;">Wichita META：</span><br>
Hahaha. Would you believe me if I told you that NOBODY got anywhere near the infernal machine on that day?<br>
...It's almost time.<br>
If you're so curious about it, then come get a front-row seat. You won't want to miss this.<br>
<br>
We canceled our plans and watched the distant sea along with the two Ashes.<br>
The Revolutionary Front already broke through the Enforcers' defensive line, and their vanguard appeared on the horizon.<br>
Just then, the Federation forces reappeared from the sea below and skies above.<br>
According to our long-range reconnaissance, more Federation forces were moving to surround them from three sides.<br>
Neither fleet fired the first shot, but neither did they cease their forward march.<br>
<span style="color:#ffc960;">Wichita META：</span><br>
On that day, Enterprise brought us here.<br>
The Marine Research Institute was right in front of us. All we had to do was steal Laplace's Demon, and this absurd situation would be resolved.<br>
And then... this happened.<br>
<br>
The world begins to darken, as if a solar eclipse has begun. The sky above distorts, bends, and twists, taking the shape of a massive vortex.<br>
A black tornado appears, whipping up the sea and growing larger with every passing moment.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
The black tornado... A corrosion phenomenon.<br>
<span style="color:#ffc960;">Wichita META：</span><br>
There you go. Yes, it's a corrosion phenomenon.<br>
Back then, we didn't know what it was either. We called it a black tornado, just like you.<br>
Heh. Yeah, no warning signs at all. It appears right out of nowhere.<br>
<span style="color:#5ce6ff;">Alsace：</span><br>
Commander, the tornado is rapidly spreading! It's going to engulf us soon!<br>
<span style="color:#ffc960;">Queen Elizabeth META：</span><br>
Stare at the pretty colours all you want, but that's a corrosion phenomenon, Commander! You won't survive long in there!<br>
Flee at once, or else!<br>
<span style="color:#5ce6ff;">The Whale：</span><br>
......<br>
<br>
With a deafening roar, the whale jumps out of the ocean and disappears into the black clouds.<br>
<span style="color:#5ce6ff;">Miss D：</span><br>
Aaargh! My whale got away again! Elizabeth, hurry up and anchor that concept!<br>
<span style="color:#ffc960;">Queen Elizabeth META：</span><br>
We're doing that already! Wait just one minute, would you?!<br>
<span style="color:#5ce6ff;">Miss D：</span><br>
Okay! Everyone else, gather around me! We're getting the hell outta here!<br>
<span style="color:#ffc960;">Wichita META：</span><br>
Heh, good idea. You'll want to get far away from this danger zone.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Aren't you coming? Corrosion must be dangerous for META, too.<br>
<span style="color:#ffc960;">Wichita META：</span><br>
We were weak back then. So we panicked, and we overlooked some important things.<br>
We're different now.<br>
We'll stay here and bear witness to the end.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Then I'm staying, too. Miss D, take the others to the next ring for me!<br>
<span style="color:#5ce6ff;">Miss D：</span><br>
Do you hear yourself, assistant?!<br>
<span style="color:#5ce6ff;">Mogador：</span><br>
Commander?!<br>
<span style="color:#5ce6ff;">Brennus：</span><br>
Swordbearer, it's too dangerous!<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
I'll be fine. If I use the concept of death instead of the train, I can catch up to you!<br>
That's how you got here, isn't it, Wichita?<br>
<span style="color:#ffc960;">Wichita META：</span><br>
Right. But...<br>
<span style="color:#5ce6ff;">Miss D：</span><br>
Even if you accept death and make it before you're corroded, death hurts! It hurts to death!<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Maybe, but there's so much to gain. It might even be as important as your whale.<br>
<span style="color:#5ce6ff;">Miss D：</span><br>
D-dang... Okay. Good luck, assistant!<br>
<span style="color:#5ce6ff;">Alsace：</span><br>
Wait! One should stay... to protect you from the worst case!<br>
<span style="color:#5ce6ff;">Fleuret：</span><br>
I'll stay, too!<br>
<span style="color:#5ce6ff;">Épée：</span><br>
M-me, too!<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
I'll be just fine, everyone. Have faith in Miss D, Elizabeth, and me!<br>
<span style="color:#5ce6ff;">Alsace：</span><br>
...Order received...<br>
<br>
Once Elizabeth gave the signal that her preparations were complete, Miss D and the Iris shipgirls all disappeared.<br>
All that remain next to me are the future Wichita and Kimberly.<br>
<span style="color:#ffc960;">Kimberly META：</span><br>
...Answer a few questions for me. How do you know so much?<br>
Our secrets, the secrets of the Antiochus... It's as if you know all of it...<br>
Why do we feel such nostalgia toward you?<br>
Why couldn't Enterprise do away with you?<br>
Why... can't I do it, either?<br>
Who in the world are you?<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Honestly, Kimberly, I could use an answer to that myself.<br>
That's why I'm here with you right now.<br>
<span style="color:#ffc960;">Kimberly META：</span><br>
...Okay.<br>
Then let's watch the end unfold... together.<br>
<br>
No more words are shared between us. We all watch in silence as the predetermined end comes.<br>
The black vortex grows in strength and ferocity in an attempt to swallow everything.<br>
Then, as if a critical point has been reached, a shockwave erupts from the center.<br>
Everything within view turns black.<br>
Wichita and Kimberly have already fallen. My body and mind creak under the weight of it, rapidly approaching the point of collapse.<br>
My hazy mind, on the verge of melting entirely, is enveloped in blue foam.<br>
I see the blackened sky. Fire, smoke.<br>
A single shooting star streaks through the desolation.<br>
How beautiful they are, the stars in the night sky.<br>

<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Is this... that same space again?<br>
Miss D says I got lost when I came in here, but... I think this might be the narrow gap between life and death.<br>
<br>
(I must've been brought here after I'd died – before the black tornado could corrode me.)<br>
The foam still covers my mind, protecting my "self".<br>
<span style="color:#bdbdbd;">???：</span><br>
...Back again, "I" see.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
......<br>
<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项1：Who are you?</span>'''''<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项2：Where am I?</span>'''''<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项3：Am I the only one here?</span>'''''<br>
<span style="color:#bdbdbd;">???：</span><br>

<span style="color:#bdbdbd;">???：</span><br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项2）</span>'''''Nowhere.<br>
<span style="color:#bdbdbd;">???：</span><br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项3）</span>'''''Yes.<br>
<span style="color:#bdbdbd;">???：</span><br>
It's "my" turn to ask the questions now.<br>
Do you know that what you've been witnessing are mere images?<br>
Foregone conclusions, all illusions, all destined to fade away.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Yeah. I know that very well.<br>
<span style="color:#bdbdbd;">???：</span><br>
Why struggle? Why resist? Why suffer and face death?<br>
What meaning is there to all of it?<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Well... It's something only I can do. Doesn't matter if it's real or not.<br>
I follow my heart, stick to my sincere beliefs, and do what I must do.<br>
What does the meaning matter, as long as I understand it? If I must, I can share it with someone else.<br>
I think there's inherent meaning in treading a path you believe in.<br>
Even if it seems meaningless at a glance, nobody knows what effects it might lead to.<br>
<span style="color:#bdbdbd;">???：</span><br>
...Answer received.<br>
You're still under the illusion that you can change established reality.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Recently, somebody told me, "Reality and truth are not always one and the same. Reality can only be truth if enough faith goes into it."<br>
I've spent a long time trying to figure out what that means...<br>
But now, it makes perfect sense.<br>
<span style="color:#bdbdbd;">???：</span><br>
What? That all vain effort will be rewarded?<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
No. It means that you can't always accept reality as the truth.<br>
If something doesn't exist in my memory, then it may be truth to others, but it isn't necessarily truth to me.<br>
Reality may be set in stone for all I care, but if you don't accept it as the truth, then it isn't your truth.<br>
No matter the situation, no matter the established premise...<br>
Until I, as an individual, experience something, make decisions, and see things to their conclusion...<br>
I won't accept it as the truth.<br>
So I'm going to fight for the sake of my truth.<br>
If that sounds like a vain effort to you, well, too bad. That's not enough reason for me to give up.<br>
<br>
When the light fades, I see the shadows of trees.<br>
The warm light shining through the leaves, the scent of flowers, the sounds of baby birds... An incredibly peaceful scene.<br>
Next to me on this bench is a girl dressed in the style of the Royal Navy. In the space between us sits a small box of sweets.<br>
<span style="color:#bdbdbd;">Rodney：</span><br>
Mmm... This is such a nice place.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Do you know where we are?<br>
<span style="color:#bdbdbd;">Rodney：</span><br>
You're asking "me"?<br>
This is a place that you constructed, that you interpreted, that you wished for.<br>
It is your "end."<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
My... end?<br>
I don't understand. What happened, and how did I end up here?<br>
<span style="color:#bdbdbd;">Rodney：</span><br>
You don't, but "I" do.<br>
You must go.<br>
Go back to your battlefield. Continue your vain struggle.<br>
"I'll" be watching you, Commander.<br>

<br>
Light paints my vision white again. Instantly after, I see the dark of nighttime.<br>
The roar of an engine reaches my ears. My nose is assaulted by the combined stench of smoke and death.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
(Is this a battlefield? But I'm on... a mass-produced ship, aren't I?)<br>
<span style="color:#ffc960;">Queen Elizabeth META：</span><br>
Aaaaaack! Where the bloody hell did you come from?!<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Elizabeth? Weren't you on the Queen's Light?<br>
<span style="color:#ffc960;">Queen Elizabeth META：</span><br>
Queen's Light...? Bel! Apprehend this stranger at once!<br>
<span style="color:#ffc960;">Belfast：</span><br>
Understood, Your Majesty. *cough*...<br>
<span style="color:#ffc960;">Queen Elizabeth META：</span><br>
Argh, fine! You just sit there and rest. We will take care of this ourselves!<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
(Everyone's acting weird...)<br>
(Actually, this might just be another memory like the Samos Island. And if Elizabeth is right before my eyes...)<br>
(...My communicator isn't reaching the Elizabeth in the train, after all. I guess there can only be one at a time in here.)<br>
(Belfast is injured. This isn't a very reassuring situation.)<br>
<span style="color:#5ce6ff;">Communicator：</span><br>
BEEP BEEP!<br>
<span style="color:#5ce6ff;">Rodney：</span><br>
Your Majesty, the X fleet has blocked our retreat route.<br>
<span style="color:#ffc960;">Queen Elizabeth META：</span><br>
...What kind, and how many?<br>
<span style="color:#5ce6ff;">Rodney：</span><br>
A Class-V mimic beast, over a thousand mimic entities, and a vector zone of five square nautical miles.<br>
<span style="color:#ffc960;">Queen Elizabeth META：</span><br>
We're struggling to handle a single Class-V? Gah, if only our fleet were in better condition...<br>
Set course for a detour. We mean to avoid unnecessary combat.<br>
<span style="color:#5ce6ff;">Rodney：</span><br>
Yes, Your Majesty.<br>
<span style="color:#ffc960;">Béarn META：</span><br>
Your Majesty. Enemies approach from all angles. We have no time for detours.<br>
I can handle a Class-V mimic beast alone. Given the losses your fleet has suffered, I would suggest leaving it in my hands.<br>
<span style="color:#ffc960;">Queen Elizabeth META：</span><br>
...Even if we can break through, the casualties will be enormous.<br>
Here's the plan. We will bring up the rear. While we distract the enemy, the rest of you can detour and escape.<br>
<span style="color:#ffc960;">Béarn META：</span><br>
Is this a roundabout means of suicide?<br>
<span style="color:#ffc960;">Queen Elizabeth META：</span><br>
No. The responsibility for this devastating defeat lies on our shoulders alone.<br>
Please... Allow us to make amends for it.<br>
<span style="color:#ffc960;">Béarn META：</span><br>
If I may, I think you're only trying to run away. Your death would do nothing to improve the overall situation.<br>
But you already know that, I'm sure.<br>
<span style="color:#ffc960;">Queen Elizabeth META：</span><br>
......<br>
We had a fleet of two hundred ships and one hundred KAN-SEN. Now, we're down to less than thirty percent...<br>
The other fronts in this battle don't fare much better...<br>
Tch... We put so much time and effort into gathering that force.<br>
We don't want to see anyone else die...<br>
<span style="color:#ffc960;">Belfast：</span><br>
Your Majesty, this is doomed to fail.<br>
<span style="color:#5ce6ff;">Nelson：</span><br>
The Royal Navy would never abandon you.<br>
I'm sorry, Your Majesty, but we won't accept those orders.<br>
<span style="color:#ffc960;">Mogador：</span><br>
*cough*...<br>
Hey, you can't predict the enemy's strength with any certainty. It's not your fault...<br>
<span style="color:#5ce6ff;">Alsace：</span><br>
Don't give up, Your Majesty! You promised we'd make it home together!<br>
<span style="color:#5ce6ff;">Mogador：</span><br>
With these numbers, I think we can make it through with a casualty rate of thirty percent. Detouring could buy us time, but it could also draw us deeper into a corner...<br>
<span style="color:#5ce6ff;">Vanguard：</span><br>
The Royal Navy stands and fights.<br>
No matter how dire the circumstances, we must face them together, Your Majesty.<br>
<span style="color:#5ce6ff;">Rodney：</span><br>
Yeah. Let's break through this encirclement together!<br>
<span style="color:#ffc960;">Queen Elizabeth META：</span><br>
......<br>
<span style="color:#5ce6ff;">Communicator：</span><br>
BEEP BEEP!<br>
<br>
A communicator beeps again – not Elizabeth's, but mine this time.<br>
<span style="color:#5ce6ff;">Dr. Anzeel：</span><br>
Comma... Ahem. Assistant, thank goodness I've finally reached you.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Dr. Anzeel... right?<br>
<span style="color:#ffc960;">Queen Elizabeth META：</span><br>
Did you say Dr. Anzeel?!<br>
<span style="color:#5ce6ff;">Dr. Anzeel：</span><br>
E-Elizabeth? Why are you with my assistant?<br>
<span style="color:#ffc960;">Queen Elizabeth META：</span><br>
Hm? The person who dropped in here out of nowhere was your ASSISTANT?<br>
<span style="color:#5ce6ff;">Dr. Anzeel：</span><br>
Yep.<br>
<span style="color:#ffc960;">Queen Elizabeth META：</span><br>
...We will accept that as truth. Anzeel, how are things with the Council?<br>
<span style="color:#5ce6ff;">Dr. Anzeel：</span><br>
Everyone's safe here. Some of the lost fleets are arriving at the rendezvous point.<br>
<span style="color:#ffc960;">Queen Elizabeth META：</span><br>
That's a relief...<br>
<span style="color:#5ce6ff;">Dr. Anzeel：</span><br>
You'd better get your butt back here too, okay?<br>
<span style="color:#ffc960;">Queen Elizabeth META：</span><br>
We... are currently planning our escape.<br>
We've strayed too far from our allies, though, so the odds are... not in our favour.<br>
<span style="color:#5ce6ff;">Dr. Anzeel：</span><br>
Elizabeth, don't give up yet. Hope is right there by your side.<br>
Can I get you to surrender leadership of the battle to my assistant there?<br>
<span style="color:#ffc960;">Queen Elizabeth META：</span><br>
Surrender leadership? To this stranger? Have you lost your mind?<br>
<span style="color:#5ce6ff;">Dr. Anzeel：</span><br>
Don't worry. I'm certain my assistant – the Commander – will lead you to victory.<br>
<span style="color:#ffc960;">Queen Elizabeth META：</span><br>
...Fine, fine, we trust you. Of course, we're supposed to obey your orders to begin with.<br>
<span style="color:#5ce6ff;">Dr. Anzeel：</span><br>
Alright, Commander, go wild. Reinforcements are on the way.<br>
I'm waiting for you to come home to us.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Dr. Anzeel? Wait, you're...<br>
<span style="color:#5ce6ff;">Dr. Anzeel：</span><br>
Hm? Were you saying something?<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Don't worry about it. You be careful.<br>
<span style="color:#5ce6ff;">Dr. Anzeel：</span><br>
No need to worry about me. We're in a safe place.<br>
Also, don't stray away from the flying battleships. And avoid contact with the X at all costs.<br>
Hanging up now.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
(Hmm. The way this Anzeel talks, I think I know who she really is.)<br>
(So in this memory, Dr. Anzeel and I were totally absent.)<br>
(That means, if we advance as we are, only death and destruction await...)<br>
<span style="color:#ffc960;">Queen Elizabeth META：</span><br>
Anzeel has awfully high hopes for you. Go on, then – show us what you can do.<br>
<span style="color:#ffc960;">Béarn META：</span><br>
What will your first order be, Commander?<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
I need a damage report on all ships and info on what weapons, personnel, and resources are available to us.<br>
In the meantime, all ships who can fight will head to the first defensive line. Put mass-produced ships on the second defensive line. We're planting our feet firmly.<br>
<span style="color:#ffc960;">Béarn META：</span><br>
Planting our feet? But the battle lines are a total mess. And we don't know if reinforcements really...<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Anzeel said there are reinforcements. Trust her.<br>
Fight until the last light has faded.<br>
<span style="color:#ffc960;">Béarn META：</span><br>
Yes, Your Majesty.<br>
<br>
My orders are based on intuition, but all ships quickly spring into action.<br>
From the flying battleship that I'd only read of in Guam's reports, I gaze upon the dark sea.<br>
In the distance, a great storm brews.<br>
Beneath the storm, a fluid emitting an uncanny blue light coats the sea.<br>
Countless things seem to stagger, squirm, and crowd upon it.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
So this is the alpha timeline's enemy... One that we'll be forced to face in our world's future.<br>
You've finally shown yourselves... "X".<br>

<br>
KABOOOM!<br>
Using the intel the girls gathered for me, I set the battlefield in motion.<br>
The floating battleships provide all the supporting fire they can, devastating the approaching wave of enemies.<br>
I thought I knew roughly how strong the Council's fleets were, based on Constellation's report. In reality, they are above and beyond that.<br>
This first-hand experience tells me that, if anything, estimates that I thought were exaggerated in the report now seem overly conservative.<br>
These vessels could decimate even a mass-produced main fleet from our timeline in a matter of seconds.<br>
That's not even mentioning the shipgirls whose strength are a whole magnitude greater than our timeline's.<br>
Take this fleet's Alsace, for instance. She's taken heavy damage and only one of her main batteries is still usable.<br>
Even so, I genuinely don't think our Alsace could defeat her in a one-on-one.<br>
I have to know what makes them so much stronger.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
(I've gotten a good grasp on this timeline's strength now.)<br>
(Next, to get a gauge on the X.)<br>
<span style="color:#5ce6ff;">Communicator：</span><br>
BEEP BEEP!<br>
<span style="color:#ffc960;">Queen Elizabeth META：</span><br>
Commander, a small fleet is headed your way.<br>
Are they the reinforcements you and Anzeel spoke of?<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
(I knew I was right to trust her. They came much sooner than I expected, too.)<br>
(Let's check the aerial recon and see who's coming. We've got... Kimberly and Wichita META, and...)<br>
(Wait... Miss D?!)<br>
<br>
The X have suffered heavy losses under my command, so to avoid further casualties, they coalesce into big blobs and disappear under the water.<br>
Looks like we've survived the storm.<br>
<span style="color:#5ce6ff;">Miss D：</span><br>
There you are, assistant! I finally found you!<br>
What are you doing here?!<br>
They're coming! The X are coming! We need to get out of here!<br>
<span style="color:#ffc960;">Wichita META：</span><br>
Calm your tits. The X have all been wiped out.<br>
I mean, you can see that, right?<br>
<span style="color:#5ce6ff;">Miss D：</span><br>
It's only a matter of time before they come back! When they do, you're gonna be in a world of pain!<br>
<span style="color:#ffc960;">Wichita META：</span><br>
Whose side are you on, talking like that?<br>
<span style="color:#5ce6ff;">Miss D：</span><br>
I'm on the assistant's side!<br>
<span style="color:#ffc960;">Wichita META：</span><br>
Yeah, yeah. Your assistant's right over there. Go on, scoot.<br>
<span style="color:#5ce6ff;">Miss D：</span><br>
Don't tell me what to do! You're not my mom!<br>
<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项1：Uh, thanks for looking after Miss D, I guess?</span>'''''<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项2：Well, this a chance meeting...</span>'''''<br>
<span style="color:#ffc960;">Wichita META：</span><br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项1）</span>'''''Now she's your problem again. I ain't doing any more babysitting today.<br>
<span style="color:#ffc960;">Wichita META：</span><br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项2）</span>'''''Sure is. Didn't think I'd run into you again.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Miss D, where is everyone else? Are we still in the Martyrium?<br>
<span style="color:#5ce6ff;">Miss D：</span><br>
*sniff sniff*... This place still smells like death, so I think so?<br>
The train cars didn't materialize it, though! Something else did!<br>
Look, it's really complicated!<br>
I only found you thanks to the tracker I put on you!<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Wait, how long have I had a tracker on me?<br>
<span style="color:#5ce6ff;">Miss D：</span><br>
Ever since I got out of that bed! I'm smart like that!<br>
<span style="color:#ffc960;">Queen Elizabeth META：</span><br>
Ugh... Some reinforcements she sent.<br>
At least we're all still alive thanks to you and the Commander.<br>
Why are you here, anyway? Don't you have somewhere else to be?<br>
<span style="color:#ffc960;">Wichita META：</span><br>
Uhh...<br>
It's complicated, basically. Don't have the words to explain it.<br>
<span style="color:#ffc960;">Queen Elizabeth META：</span><br>
If you say so. It's been complicated for all of us lately, with bizarre things happening one after the other.<br>
Regardless, we are glad to meet you.<br>
With you and the Commander aiding us, we might just live to see another day.<br>
<span style="color:#ffc960;">Wichita META：</span><br>
You will. You're coming back home.<br>
<span style="color:#ffc960;">Kimberly META：</span><br>
Yeah.<br>
<span style="color:#ffc960;">Béarn META：</span><br>
Commander, a corrosion vector zone has sprung up from the sea, protected by a cocoon.<br>
My estimates put their numbers at fifteen times greater than the last wave. Even your ability cannot compensate for the sheer difference in strength.<br>
<span style="color:#ffc960;">Queen Elizabeth META：</span><br>
We knew it... This place is one big ambush.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Then we'll just carve a path out of here as planned. Everyone, prepare for battle.<br>
The Ash– Wichita and Kimberly will clear the way. We'll pull out as soon as we have secured an exit!<br>
<span style="color:#ffc960;">Béarn META：</span><br>
Will the two of them really suffice?<br>
<span style="color:#ffc960;">Wichita META：</span><br>
We will. You saw what we're capable of just a minute ago.<br>
You focus on your task, and we'll focus on ours!<br>

<br>
KABOOOM!<br>
These so-called "mimics" – the X – possess a truly diverse range of characteristics.<br>
Their bodies are flexible, yet durable, reminiscent of metallic slimes found in certain fantasy works.<br>
They can absorb strikes by expanding while also maintaining a rigidity that allows them to survive nearby explosions. Interestingly, their appearances also vary by category.<br>
Accordingly, the people of this timeline have made categories for them based on appearance and size.<br>
The small ones are called "mimic entities," while the larger ones are called "mimic beasts," which are further divided into classes based on their strength.<br>
Additionally, the area they corrode is called a "vector zone." It affects not only the water, but the air as well.<br>
This, I suspect, is the reason why the flying battleships don't float that high off the surface.<br>
The X are also able to "infect" sunk mass-produced ships and reconstruct them at a frightening speed.<br>
It's safe to reason that they're able to do all of this on land as well.<br>
While they are a very powerful adversary, they are not invincible. They can be defeated.<br>
Defeating the large ones is a challenge, however, as they split into smaller X when destroyed.<br>
They lose all cohesion once they've been pummeled hard enough, but then they merge with the vector zone.<br>
With time, the vector zone will grow thicker and thicker until it allows for newly-formed X to emerge.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
(There is no X that Wichita and Kimberly cannot blow to pieces... but there is also no X that they can kill in any meaningful sense.)<br>
(How do you fight an enemy you cannot kill?)<br>
<br>
KABOOOM!<br>
There is a boom, and the flying battleship trembles. Luckily, the ship's shields stopped the attack.<br>
A different battleship not far from mine wasn't so lucky, though. The hit penetrated, forcing it to make an emergency landing.<br>
<span style="color:#5ce6ff;">Miss D：</span><br>
I sense something... A Class-IX mimic beast?! Where is it?!<br>
This is really, REALLY bad! Those two don't stand a chance against a Class-IX!<br>
It's over! We're all doooomed!<br>
<br>
The battlefield monitor shows a close-up of the vector zone ahead, where a glowing blue tornado rages.<br>
I narrow my eyes, and it looks like there is something floating inside of it.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Is that... an eye?<br>
<span style="color:#5ce6ff;">Miss D：</span><br>
Oh, phew... We're really lucky. That thing didn't get a sneak attack in on us.<br>
If it had hit us directly, that would've been game over!<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Why? We can't die in this place as long as the concept "doesn't engulf us." What's the danger here?<br>
<span style="color:#5ce6ff;">Miss D：</span><br>
Just because you can't die doesn't mean there's no danger!<br>
There are more ways to get rid of someone than just killing them!<br>
Do you see that X? Look close and tell me this – do you really think that's just a replica made from memories?<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Are you saying it isn't?<br>
<span style="color:#5ce6ff;">Miss D：</span><br>
No! It couldn't be any further from the truth! There's no such thing as a "fake" X!<br>
It was over for this space the moment that thing showed up!<br>
If the X get you, you're gone forever! Do you get it now?!<br>
Don't answer! Just hang on to me and I'll get us out of here!<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
I'm not running away. Not until I've seen for myself that it cannot be defeated.<br>
<span style="color:#5ce6ff;">Miss D：</span><br>
Ugh, fine! Then I'll protect you for as long as I can!<br>
Which won't be very long, mind you!<br>
When it really hits the fan, I'm getting you out of here whether you like it or not!<br>
<br>
KABOOOM!<br>
The mimic beast hits us once. Then again. Then again. Each time it strikes the ship's shields, it rocks so violently that I fear it's going to sink.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
(That thing is clearly after us in particular. The silver lining is, it's the only one that is. The rest of the X are ignoring us.)<br>
(It's obviously trying to cripple our chain of command, which won't happen without support on its side.)<br>
(How did it even know I was here? And if it's targeting individuals who aren't part of this memory, why isn't it hunting Miss D and those Ashes, too?)<br>
(Wait... That's it! We're not part of the memory, and neither is the mimic beast!)<br>
(If X's invasion was invoked by someone, it was most likely Hatakaze META and Devil.)<br>
(No, wait... there's one other person.)<br>
<span style="color:#5ce6ff;">Miss D：</span><br>
Assistant! We can't stay here any longer!<br>
Come to me right now or you'll be turned into smush!<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
No, I'm staying. We're going to defeat the mimic beast.<br>
<span style="color:#5ce6ff;">Miss D：</span><br>
Defeat a Class IX? Who do you expect to do that? Me?<br>
Without my whale, there's not a chance in hell!<br>
Look ooout! It's coming right for us! Stop wasting time and get over here!<br>
<br>
KABOOOM!<br>
<span style="color:#5ce6ff;">Miss D：</span><br>
Crap! I'm not gonna make it!<br>
Dammit, you stupid stupid idiot! If you're not gonna leave then I'll fight it, okay?!<br>
You're the moronest moron ever, I swear!<br>
<br>
Miss D jumps off the deck, immediately after which the mimic beast's attack penetrates the ship's shields.<br>
The attack, however, neither struck the ship nor Miss D.<br>
It was a blink away from striking Miss D, but then it warped and twisted before fading away in a burst of light.<br>
<span style="color:#bdbdbd;">Rodney：</span><br>
...Stubbornness has been the undoing of many a soul.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
I had a feeling you were here.<br>
More than that – you created this space, didn't you?<br>
<span style="color:#bdbdbd;">Rodney：</span><br>
Indeed.<br>
Why were you so sure that "I'd" save you?<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Because that's what you'd do, Rodney.<br>
<span style="color:#bdbdbd;">Rodney：</span><br>
......<br>
"I" am Rodney; "we" are Rodney. Greetings to you who goes by the name of "Commander."<br>
After much observation and thinking, "I" have made my choice.<br>
"We" choose not the demise known as oblivion, but instead choose to witness your end.<br>
May this illusory place change to your will.<br>
<br>
A feeling of weightlessness overcomes me, and my horizon suddenly expands.<br>
I can see it all – the battlefield, what's happening on it, and what's real and what's not.<br>
Elizabeth, Wichita, and Alsace's squadron are all fighting tooth and nail.<br>
What's more, I can see a temple of gold in the distance, far away from this memory.<br>
All around it, the girls from my timeline are holding on by the skin of their teeth.<br>
<span style="color:#5ce6ff;">Épée：</span><br>
T-try this on for size!<br>
<br>
KABOOOM!<br>
<span style="color:#ff9b93;">Death's Shadow：</span><br>
Charging up Death Laser.<br>
Charging progress: 0%... 10%... 20%...<br>
<span style="color:#5ce6ff;">Fleuret：</span><br>
"Death Laser" sounds really bad! In more ways than one!<br>
<span style="color:#5ce6ff;">Mogador：</span><br>
We need to interrupt the charge! Get her!<br>
<br>
KABOOOM!<br>
<span style="color:#5ce6ff;">Épée：</span><br>
Sh-she dodged again!<br>
<span style="color:#5ce6ff;">Alsace：</span><br>
Executing follow-up attack!<br>
<span style="color:#ff9b93;">Death's Shadow：</span><br>
30%... 40%... 50%...<br>
<span style="color:#5ce6ff;">Alsace：</span><br>
Such evasion... This Antiochus is a slippery one!<br>
<span style="color:#5ce6ff;">Brennus：</span><br>
An attack is coming. Step back!<br>
<br>
KABOOOM!<br>
<span style="color:#5ce6ff;">Brennus：</span><br>
She is too powerful. We cannot hope to defeat her alone.<br>
<span style="color:#5ce6ff;">Mogador：</span><br>
But we've lost contact with Miss D and the Commander, and Death's Shadow isn't gonna back down.<br>
<span style="color:#5ce6ff;">Fleuret：</span><br>
Running away isn't an option either, though. She'll just come after us.<br>
What rotten luck when she finally brought the whale here... What should we do?<br>
<span style="color:#5ce6ff;">Alsace：</span><br>
Strange... One can feel the Commander is watching. Does anyone else?<br>
<span style="color:#5ce6ff;">Fleuret：</span><br>
Watching? What are you talking about?<br>
I don't feel anything... Or at least, I don't think so?<br>
<span style="color:#5ce6ff;">Alsace：</span><br>
One can definitely sense it. Somewhere, far away, the Commander is watching us.<br>
Commander! We're over here!<br>
<br>
Amid the golden light, Alsace extends a hand toward me.<br>
Subconsciously, I extend mine in turn, trying to reach her across the vast distance.<br>
Before our hands can even touch, the feeling of weightlessness that overcame me is all gone.<br>
Gravity pulls my mind back to earth and constricts my field of view once more.<br>
The next thing I know, I'm back aboard the floating battleship.<br>
And, somehow, I know that this despair-ridden stretch of ocean has changed.<br>
At the same time, outside the command vessel...<br>
<span style="color:#5cffc0;">Fleuret：</span><br>
...Huh? Where are we? Did we just get teleported here?<br>
<span style="color:#5cffc0;">Mogador：</span><br>
I think we shook off Death's Shadow. *sniff sniff*... Hang on...<br>
Is that corrosion I smell? And is that one of those floating battleships the Commander talked about?<br>
Ugh... Man, all of a sudden I feel really bad.<br>
<span style="color:#5cffc0;">Fleuret：</span><br>
Yeah... I feel like breaking down in tears.<br>
<span style="color:#5cffc0;">Brennus：</span><br>
Likewise, there is sadness and anger in my heart... Did the memory put these feelings there?<br>
<span style="color:#5cffc0;">Épée：</span><br>
*sob*...<br>
<span style="color:#5cffc0;">Alsace：</span><br>
One is... I'm confused, but I can hear the feelings in my heart, screaming to break free.<br>
I know what needs to be done. I need to unleash everything!<br>
<span style="color:#ffc960;">Béarn META：</span><br>
Alsace? Mogador? I thought you suffered crippling damage.<br>
How did you recover? And why are you glowing?<br>
<span style="color:#5cffc0;">Alsace：</span><br>
It's okay, Béarn. One understands everything now.<br>
This one is battleship Alsace – Sacrament of the Unified Orthodoxy, an unreachable dream, and guardian of the Holy See!<br>
One has returned to cast holy judgment upon evil!<br>
<br>
Meanwhile, not far from there...<br>
<span style="color:#ffc960;">Renown META ：</span><br>
*cough cough*... Repulse, are you alright?<br>
<span style="color:#ffc960;">Repulse META ：</span><br>
I've pushed past my limit, but I'm surprisingly okay... *cough cough*...<br>
<span style="color:#ffc960;">Renown META ：</span><br>
The beacon is still sending out an SOS. Her Majesty is still fighting.<br>
Do you think you can keep going a little longer?<br>
<span style="color:#ffc960;">Repulse META ：</span><br>
Sure can! But we have to go faster!<br>
Her Majesty is waiting for us. We WILL make it in time!<br>

<br>
The Iris girls have been warped to – or rather, merged with their counterparts in – the memory.<br>
With their strength, the scales of victory now start to tip in our favor again.<br>
Inch by inch, they push back X's forces, a dazzling golden light shining around them all the while.<br>
The vector zone proves not as ineradicable as thought. It fades little by little under the light and cannon fire, being reduced to little white crystals that turn to dust.<br>
Finally, the mimic beast inside the tornado lets out a mournful cry before it disintegrates into nothing.<br>
<span style="color:#5cffc0;">Brennus：</span><br>
Your judgment hath come. Threads of death take you!<br>
<span style="color:#5cffc0;">Mogador：</span><br>
Go away, you damn pests!<br>
<span style="color:#5cffc0;">Alsace：</span><br>
Preparing to initiate cleanup mode!<br>
<br>
On board the floating battleship...<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
My god... They're making the X look like no threat at all.<br>
How did they get so strong all of a sudden?<br>
<span style="color:#bdbdbd;">Rodney：</span><br>
"I" don't know.<br>
"I" only gave you a foundation to express yourself. The rest was all you.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
I... did this?<br>
<span style="color:#5ce6ff;">Miss D：</span><br>
Wow! You actually did it, assistant!<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Do you know what I did, exactly?<br>
<span style="color:#5ce6ff;">Miss D：</span><br>
No, I was just giving credit where credit is due.<br>
<span style="color:#ffc960;">Queen Elizabeth META：</span><br>
The vector zone has been... neutralised? How? Our forces were vastly outmatched!<br>
Béarn, have you any explanation for this?<br>
<span style="color:#ffc960;">Béarn META：</span><br>
I'm afraid not. All I can say is that those girls glowed golden and seemed almost not like themselves.<br>
Somehow, they managed to repel the X without employing any spectacular Sacraments or weapons of any kind.<br>
<span style="color:#ffc960;">Wichita META：</span><br>
(The hell just happened?)<br>
(How'd they pull off an Enterprise-level stunt without some secret weapon?)<br>
(And how did the timeline beta girls merge with their memory counterparts like that? They weren't here until a minute ago!)<br>
(Unless Helena was involved somehow, their branch is nowhere near technologically advanced enough to have done this!)<br>
<span style="color:#5ce6ff;">Communicator：</span><br>
BEEP BEEP!<br>
<span style="color:#ffc960;">Repulse META ：</span><br>
We have a signal, sis! We made it in time!<br>
<span style="color:#ffc960;">Renown META ：</span><br>
Your Majesty, this is Renown and Repulse. We have come to aid you!<br>
<span style="color:#ffc960;">Queen Elizabeth META：</span><br>
Renown! You're a mess! What happened to you?<br>
And for that matter, what are you doing here?!<br>
We gave the order for all our forces to retreat! Were we not clear enough?!<br>
<span style="color:#ffc960;">Renown META ：</span><br>
You were still gone, Your Majesty. We came because we feared for your safety.<br>
<span style="color:#ffc960;">Queen Elizabeth META：</span><br>
Well, getting here clearly can't have been easy, we'll give you that.<br>
Truth be told, we were on the verge of complete annihilation until just now. We were prepared to be claimed by the ocean.<br>
It is nothing short of a miracle that we get to see each other again.<br>
Thank you, "friends from afar" – for coming to our aid.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Wait... Do you get it now, Elizabeth?<br>
<span style="color:#ffc960;">Queen Elizabeth META：</span><br>
It's only a gut feeling. Are we correct?<br>
<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项1：......</span>'''''<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项2：Yeah.</span>'''''<br>
<span style="color:#bdbdbd;">Rodney：</span><br>
Your struggle bore fruit. You managed to send death back to whence it came.<br>
All will return to nothing eventually – but your end is still far off.<br>
"I" will destroy the cocoon and put an end to this illusion.<br>
And you – you will return to where you were.<br>
Farewell. May we meet again someday.<br>
<br>
The Iris girls blinked, and they found themselves in that space of cold machinery again.<br>
<span style="color:#5cffc0;">Brennus：</span><br>
Are we... inside the whale now?<br>
<span style="color:#5cffc0;">Épée：</span><br>
Did we just get sent back?<br>
<span style="color:#ff9b93;">Death's Shadow：</span><br>
40%... 50%... 60%...<br>
<span style="color:#5cffc0;">Mogador：</span><br>
Oh god, it's her again! And she's still charging her laser! Did we space out and hallucinate that whole battle?<br>
<span style="color:#5cffc0;">Fleuret：</span><br>
We should PROBABLY do something about that laser like, now!<br>
<span style="color:#5cffc0;">Alsace：</span><br>
The power one suddenly gained is still with this one...<br>
<span style="color:#5cffc0;">Brennus：</span><br>
I can feel it, too. It's vanishing, little by little, but I still feel strong enough to take down Death's Shadow.<br>
<span style="color:#5cffc0;">Mogador：</span><br>
Then what are we waiting for? Let's kick her ass!<br>
<br>
The laser reached a charge of 85%, but it could get no further than that.<br>
Brennus pulled on her silver strings and brought down sword after sword upon Death's Shadow, purging the black mist around her and preventing her escape.<br>
Then, like a steed through the heavens, Alsace dashed in and dealt a beautiful blow.<br>
Death's chains were cut, and her pale, corpse-like pale was ripped apart.<br>
<span style="color:#5ce6ff;">Alsace：</span><br>
One dealt the killing blow!<br>
<span style="color:#5ce6ff;">Mogador：</span><br>
Phew... It's finally over.<br>
<span style="color:#5ce6ff;">Brennus：</span><br>
A flawless victory. That was some exemplary teamwork.<br>
<span style="color:#5ce6ff;">Fleuret：</span><br>
I think all the power juice just ran out... I think we actually cut it really close.<br>
<span style="color:#5ce6ff;">Alsace：</span><br>
One hopes control of the whale will be returned to Miss D now that her lookalike has been disposed of. Let's go find her and the Commander!<br>
I'm sure they'll be overjoyed to hear that we succeeded in capturing the whale!<br>
<span style="color:#5ce6ff;">Épée：</span><br>
Umm, girls... Look below you...<br>
<span style="color:#5ce6ff;">Mogador：</span><br>
At what? The Martyrium?<br>
...Oh. We're above a THIRD ring. When did that happen?<br>
<span style="color:#5ce6ff;">Fleuret：</span><br>
Who knows at this point... I think Miss D and the Commander are down there, though.<br>
<span style="color:#5ce6ff;">Brennus：</span><br>
Miss D is not here to create a path using the train cars for us. Our only way there is death.<br>
<span style="color:#5ce6ff;">Alsace：</span><br>
Nooo! I don't want to die!<br>
{{折叠面板|内容结束}}

{{折叠面板|标题=Radiant Heart|选项=25|主框=1|样式=primary|展开=是}}
<br>
The world of memories crumbles away, and when I next open my eyes, I'm back in the Martyrium again.<br>
<span style="color:#5ce6ff;">Miss D：</span><br>
We did it! We're back here!<br>
This is the Martyrium's third ring! The third ring is the heart!<br>
This SHOULD be the last unfolded space now that that weird memory thing is over.<br>
You're mine now, whale! There's nowhere left to run!<br>
Come out, come out, wherever you–<br>
...Are?! It's flown off to the outermost ring!<br>
Assistant, we have to–<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Hold on. Something doesn't feel right.<br>
<br>
I survey the area. The Martyrium's white basilica seems to glow brighter than anything else.<br>
Even more attention-drawing, however, is the plaza at the center of the third ring and the enormous structure that towers above it.<br>
It's a yellow crystal encased in wings carved from marble. At a glance, it feels almost sacred...<br>
Looking closer, though, I realize that it's the epicenter of a marbled, blank whiteness.<br>
A whiteness that lives, multiplying and propagating like the roots of a tree, corroding its surroundings.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
(Like an invasive mycelium... Is this what corrosion is?)<br>
(Did the Class-IX mimic beast appear in that memory because of this corrosion?)<br>
(Right, there was that META working together with Devil... Was this their doing?)<br>
<span style="color:#5ce6ff;">Miss D：</span><br>
Eww... Let's get out of here, assistant.<br>
<br>
I open my communicator and try to reach Elizabeth and Alsace.<br>
There is a click, but no sound beyond that. It isn't working.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
(Dammit, Devil is at it again. She's jamming our comms.)<br>
(I'm isolated from the girls and have no backup from Elizabeth. I'm in serious danger.)<br>
<br>
I can almost hear Devil laughing smugly at my predicament.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Hey, how do we get to the outermost ring?<br>
<span style="color:#5ce6ff;">Miss D：</span><br>
Just exit the Martyrium and come back in again.<br>
I know how to leave! It's through the glowy spot in the middle!<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
The middle... where the corrosion is coming from...<br>
Dammit. If it's the only way, so be it...<br>
{{折叠面板|内容结束}}

{{折叠面板|标题=Join in the Chorus|选项=26|主框=1|样式=primary|展开=是}}
<br>
We move to the plaza, where we unexpectedly come face to face with Hatakaze META.<br>
<span style="color:#bdbdbd;">Hatakaze META：</span><br>
We meet at last, Commander.<br>
Need I introduce myself?<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
You're Hatakaze META.<br>
<span style="color:#bdbdbd;">Hatakaze META：</span><br>
That I am, yes.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
You're also the one who sent that Class-IX mimic beast after us.<br>
<span style="color:#bdbdbd;">Hatakaze META：</span><br>
Correct. Its defeat means little to me. It was no more than a ripple on the lake that is this illusory space.<br>
Though, I must admit, you've surprised me.<br>
And caused me some headaches, too.<br>
You must've seen her. The one who calls herself "Rodney," who lives in that illusion.<br>
If she'd only let the cocoon incubate, she would have been reborn as a god with immense power over this world.<br>
Yet, she rejected that. She stopped it.<br>
She destroyed the cocoon and her own destiny.<br>
You made her choose this. Am I wrong?<br>
<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项1：......</span>'''''<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项2：You're not.</span>'''''<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项3：She has the right to make her own decisions.</span>'''''<br>
<span style="color:#bdbdbd;">Hatakaze META：</span><br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项1）</span>'''''You do not need to answer.<br>
<span style="color:#bdbdbd;">Hatakaze META：</span><br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项2）</span>'''''I thought as much.<br>
<span style="color:#bdbdbd;">Hatakaze META：</span><br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项3）</span>'''''So why did you make her choose the worst possible thing?<br>
<span style="color:#bdbdbd;">Hatakaze META：</span><br>
Your actions have wasted a tremendous amount of resources.<br>
So, I claimed the fragments of the cocoon and this entire city of death and I will make the most of them.<br>
<br>
With those words, the corrosion covering the basilica comes to life and begins to squirm.<br>
The thousands upon thousands of white roots extend toward the sky, chanting in a silent hymn.<br>
Suddenly, the Martyrium's golden light takes on a foreboding purple color.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
(Even if I can't contact anyone, they WILL see this and come running.)<br>
(Until then, though... Miss D can't fight head-on, so I have to buy us some time!)<br>
What was that? Felt like changing the lighting a bit?<br>
<span style="color:#bdbdbd;">Hatakaze META：</span><br>
×ĚŃřźşÉí<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Are you ignoring me now?<br>
(That's no language I've ever heard. Assuming she's even speaking a human language.)<br>
Miss D, what the hell is she doing?<br>
<span style="color:#5ce6ff;">Miss D：</span><br>
She's trying to seize control of the Martyrium!<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
What's she saying? Can you tell?<br>
<span style="color:#5ce6ff;">Miss D：</span><br>
No! I don't have a translation function!<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Can you do anything to stop her?<br>
<span style="color:#5ce6ff;">Miss D：</span><br>
I can try, but who's gonna protect you if I have to fight her?<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
(I wish I could say, "I'll be fine," but there is too much at stake here.)<br>
<br>
Hatakaze continues speaking in tongues, glaring at me all the while.<br>
<span style="color:#bdbdbd;">Hatakaze META：</span><br>
śřşó<br>
ÓÚ´Ë´ŚŐŔˇĹ°É<br>
<br>
She spreads her hands out, and the marble wings do the same.<br>
The massive crystal emits a pulse of light, and a white figure descends from the heavens.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Huh? Rodney?!<br>
No, wait. She may look the same, but I can sense that's not her!<br>
<span style="color:#bdbdbd;">Hatakaze META：</span><br>
Heehee. How keen of you.<br>
I used the cocoon fragments to raise a complex, in turn using that to create merely a false copy of her.<br>
Still, impressive – don't you think?<br>
<br>
She carries a presence so powerful that it makes the light around her seem dull.<br>
Her expression, blank. Her hands, joined in prayer. The wind blows through her hair and carries her gently flapping wings.<br>
Rodney – a being whose aura surpasses even the Martyrium – hovers there solemnly.<br>
<span style="color:#ffc960;">Queen Elizabeth META：</span><br>
She did not cause the spatial impact event.<br>
This Rodney is a puppet. An artificial body born by forcibly anchoring the invisible.<br>
Still, she wields unbelievable power...<br>
We cannot believe it... No one should be capable of what she is!<br>
<span style="color:#ffc960;">Helena META：</span><br>
Look at you, staring all slackjawed. You know so very little.<br>
<span style="color:#ffc960;">Queen Elizabeth META：</span><br>
And you know so very little about manners, insolent pillock.<br>
How did you evade our detection? Who are you?<br>
<span style="color:#ffc960;">Helena META：</span><br>
A true ally of the Commander. Unlike you.<br>
Tell me, why did you bring the Commander to such a dangerous place? What were you trying to achieve?<br>
<span style="color:#ffc960;">Queen Elizabeth META：</span><br>
We have no obligation to answer you.<br>
However, if you are an ally of the Commander, you are potentially our ally as well.<br>
We shall tell you this much – the Commander is instrumental to overcoming the crisis test site beta faces, and as such, had to know about this place.<br>
And not just know, but to see it firsthand.<br>
<span style="color:#ffc960;">Helena META：</span><br>
Has no one ever told you that knowing too much is dangerous?<br>
The alpha timeline, the Antiochus's true purpose, the X...<br>
The Commander isn't ready to know about all these things! It's too soon!<br>
<span style="color:#ffc960;">Queen Elizabeth META：</span><br>
"Too soon"?<br>
Richard and the Arbiters are fighting at the gates to test site beta as we speak, and you think it's "too soon"?<br>
We think you're plain overprotective.<br>
<span style="color:#ffc960;">Helena META：</span><br>
You don't know anything about "overprotective."<br>
But us arguing here won't do any good. I'll just ask you this – was it your subordinates that tried to stop me?<br>
<span style="color:#ffc960;">Queen Elizabeth META：</span><br>
We would've never even known you existed had you not shown yourself. How could we possibly do anything against you?<br>
<span style="color:#ffc960;">Helena META：</span><br>
...Fine.<br>
<span style="color:#ffc960;">Wichita META：</span><br>
Is that... Helena?<br>
<span style="color:#ffc960;">Helena META：</span><br>
Not the Helena you know, for the record.<br>
<span style="color:#ffc960;">Wichita META：</span><br>
Didn't ask, but okay.<br>
Guess Hiryuu was right about one thing.<br>
<span style="color:#ffc960;">Helena META：</span><br>
If you have questions, this is not the time. I won't answer them.<br>
<span style="color:#ffc960;">Wichita META：</span><br>
Pfft. Whatever.<br>
You just get here, or what? Are you after that thing, or the whale?<br>
<span style="color:#ffc960;">Helena META：</span><br>
Neither. I'm here to protect the Commander.<br>
<span style="color:#ffc960;">Wichita META：</span><br>
Oookay then...<br>
<span style="color:#ffc960;">Helena META：</span><br>
I know what you want to ask. I'm not going to answer.<br>
<span style="color:#ffc960;">Wichita META：</span><br>
Haven't changed one bit, have ya?<br>
Good to know we don't have to fight over the same target, at least. We're just gonna take care of that thing over there. That fine with you?<br>
<span style="color:#ffc960;">Helena META：</span><br>
I won't stop you.<br>
<span style="color:#ffc960;">Queen Elizabeth META：</span><br>
Neither shall we. We only want the whale, then we'll head home.<br>
<span style="color:#ffc960;">Helena META：</span><br>
The Commander is coming with me.<br>
<span style="color:#ffc960;">Queen Elizabeth META：</span><br>
And leave without the rest of us? We don't think so.<br>
<span style="color:#ffc960;">Helena META：</span><br>
......<br>
<span style="color:#ff9b93;">Arbiter: The Devil XV：</span><br>
Evening, ladies! Hope there's room for one more at your little table.<br>
<span style="color:#ffc960;">Queen Elizabeth META：</span><br>
You...!<br>
<span style="color:#ffc960;">Wichita META：</span><br>
What? She's still here?<br>
<span style="color:#ff9b93;">Arbiter: The Devil XV：</span><br>
Duh. Who walks out when a show's about to reach its climax?<br>
<span style="color:#ffc960;">Wichita META：</span><br>
You, if ya value your life. Get out or we'll murder you.<br>
<span style="color:#ff9b93;">Arbiter: The Devil XV：</span><br>
Ahahaha! You and what army?<br>
I'll bet you wouldn't last even 30 minutes against that Rodney.<br>
Even if you did, your precious Commander would be long dead by then.<br>
Won't have to bear seeing you all keel over one by one here then, at least.<br>
<span style="color:#ffc960;">Queen Elizabeth META：</span><br>
We will protect our servant. Can we count on you lot?<br>
<span style="color:#ffc960;">Wichita META：</span><br>
I'm in. Someone's gotta teach this bratty little shit a lesson!<br>
<span style="color:#ffc960;">Helena META：</span><br>
...Fine. Just this once.<br>
<span style="color:#ff9b93;">Arbiter: The Devil XV：</span><br>
Heehee. Everyone's on the same page, eh?<br>
Good. Then let's finish this show with a bang!<br>
{{折叠面板|内容结束}}

{{折叠面板|标题=To the Third Death|选项=27|主框=1|样式=primary|展开=是}}
<span style="color:#bdbdbd;">Rodney：</span><br>
AAAAAAAHHHH––!!<br>
<br>
KABOOOOM!<br>
<span style="color:#5ce6ff;">Miss D：</span><br>
Assistant, it's dangerous out there! Stay by me!<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Got it. But at this rate...!<br>
<br>
The META shipgirls and Rodney have already begun trading blows in the Martyrium sea.<br>
Individual METAs have banded together to fight as one unit with awesome power, but they still fail to overcome Rodney's strength.<br>
As I'm overwhelmed by my powerlessness and just how outmatched we are, suddenly, it hits me.<br>
What about that power I'd experienced before? The ability to see the battlefield in its entirety, to touch the senses of the shipgirls from afar?<br>
If I used that, I could do more than just tell them where I was – I could help the METAs in their fight.<br>
I might've lost the foundation that Rodney had made, but if the cocoon fragments that made this memory are still inside...<br>
If I could just harness their power, even a fragment of it...<br>
<span style="color:#5ce6ff;">Alsace：</span><br>
C-Commander! The Iris bodyguard fleet has assembled!<br>
<span style="color:#5ce6ff;">Fleuret：</span><br>
Phew... We made it in time!<br>
<span style="color:#5ce6ff;">Mogador：</span><br>
Here I was getting all hot and bothered knowing you were watching us, but things have really taken a serious turn...<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
(Alsace and the others! Nice, it worked...)<br>
Where have you been? Are you all okay?<br>
<span style="color:#5ce6ff;">Brennus：</span><br>
We climbed the whale and did battle with Death's Shadow.<br>
Your guidance bestowed us with the strength necessary to fell the fiend.<br>
We were meant to gather here in the third ring afterward, but the whale fled to the first ring during the fight. We were taken along with it.<br>
That's why we couldn't run to your aid... On behalf of all of us, I apologize.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Does that mean you came here from the first ring?<br>
Miss D was with me the whole time. Don't tell me you...<br>
<span style="color:#5ce6ff;">Brennus：</span><br>
We acted in accordance with the rules of this Mirror Sea. Do not worry for us, Swordbearer.<br>
<span style="color:#5ce6ff;">Fleuret：</span><br>
It's the Martyrium, after all! Sacrificing ourselves for the Iris as an offering fits the concept like a glove!<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
I'm sorry, everyone. If only we could use our communicators...<br>
<span style="color:#5ce6ff;">Épée：</span><br>
I-it's okay. We were on our way to you anyway.<br>
<span style="color:#5ce6ff;">Alsace：</span><br>
That's right. I kept tabs on our line of communication, so when things started going haywire, I knew I had to come running.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
You mean as soon as Devil cut off our communications, then?<br>
<span style="color:#5ce6ff;">Alsace：</span><br>
Yes! Pinpointing your location was a difficult task, though...<br>
<span style="color:#5ce6ff;">Mogador：</span><br>
Heheheh♥ We only got to meet up this fast because you were sooo very worried about us, huh?<br>
It's just a shame that our little power boost already went away. Even if we joined the battle, I don't think there's much we could do...<br>
But that doesn't mean we're sitting out this battle.<br>
That Rodney definitely has the Arbiter and the corrosion helping her out.<br>
So I say we even the odds by helping them fight off that Hatakaze and the Arbiter. We can even support them by strengthening the Martyrium's concept by killing off the corrosion entities.<br>
<span style="color:#5ce6ff;">Alsace：</span><br>
Yeah! We have Commander on our side, after all!<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Good call, Mogador. Rodney's strong, but she isn't the only threat in this fight.<br>
Hatakaze, Devil – either one intervening in the fight could be disastrous.<br>
Let's contribute to the battle in what ways we can.<br>
Formations, everyone! This is our fight now!<br>

<br>
Through our efforts, we manage to bring the Mirror Sea's concept closer to its original state.<br>
KABOOOOM!<br>
<span style="color:#5ce6ff;">Alsace：</span><br>
Enemies at three o'clock confirmed down!<br>
<span style="color:#5ce6ff;">Mogador：</span><br>
Yaaay♪ The corrosion's visibly slowing down!<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Keep it up! Press on to the central crystal!<br>
The Martyrium's... The Mirror Sea's control system might be waiting for us!<br>
<span style="color:#5ce6ff;">Fleuret：</span><br>
Fleuret speaking! The suppression fleet still can't reach the target sector due to the threat of being caught in the crossfire.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Skip that one. Let Elizabeth's fleet fight freely.<br>
I'm concerned about the battle with Rodney. Contact me as soon as you spot Hatakaze!<br>
<span style="color:#5ce6ff;">Épée：</span><br>
R-roger dodger...!<br>
<span style="color:#5ce6ff;">Brennus：</span><br>
I've spotted some of Devil's drones, but the Arbiter herself is nowhere to be seen.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Don't pursue the drones too far. Focus on the search as planned.<br>
<span style="color:#5ce6ff;">Brennus：</span><br>
Understood.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
(Perfect. Rodney should be weakening with every passing moment.)<br>
(Hatakaze hasn't shown herself since she manifested the corrosion, though.)<br>
(Devil must be plotting something, too.)<br>
(Could it be... they're waiting for us to defeat Rodney?)<br>
Miss D, status report on Rodney.<br>
<span style="color:#5ce6ff;">Miss D：</span><br>
She's still acting tough, but she'll disintegrate soon enough.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
...Disintegrate? What happens then?<br>
<span style="color:#5ce6ff;">Miss D：</span><br>
I dunno!<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
(Should I try contacting Helena? We're in the middle of a fight... but I think it's my best bet.)<br>
<span style="color:#5ce6ff;">Communicator：</span><br>
BEEP BEEP!<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Helena, can you hear me?<br>
<span style="color:#ffc960;">Helena META：</span><br>
We're almost done here. Focus on keeping yourself safe.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
I'm fine. But I do have a few questions for you!<br>
<span style="color:#ffc960;">Helena META：</span><br>
...Must it be right now?<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Yeah, it must. It's related to this battle.<br>
<span style="color:#ffc960;">Helena META：</span><br>
Okay, then. Ask me anything.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
That Rodney is a fake made from a complex, which means she's similar to a Pawn.<br>
How can she be so strong?<br>
<span style="color:#ffc960;">Helena META：</span><br>
The corrosion only serves as glue for the cocoon. What matters is the cocoon itself.<br>
As for the cocoon, it's a foundation that anchors the concept of Rodney to this world in order to manifest itself.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
The cocoon is fragmented now, isn't it?<br>
<span style="color:#ffc960;">Helena META：</span><br>
Yes. At first, Hatakaze sent the X into this memory region in order to corrode Rodney.<br>
Thanks to your interference, the concept of Rodney destroyed the cocoon herself.<br>
The X corrosion has stopped, but that also weakened the concept's own connection to reality.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
And from there, Hatakaze used the leftover fragments to create a puppet of pure power?<br>
<span style="color:#ffc960;">Helena META：</span><br>
Exactly.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
If your glue statement is right, then purifying the corrosion would make the cocoon fall apart... Do you think it's possible?<br>
<span style="color:#ffc960;">Helena META：</span><br>
Yes, of course.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Okay... What about, instead of destroying her, we left Rodney in this world? Would that work?<br>
<span style="color:#ffc960;">Helena META：</span><br>
It would be difficult, but not impossible.<br>
If that's your goal, then we'll need to suppress that Rodney's power for the sake of our own safety.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
We have to try. It's just a gut feeling, but I think Hatakaze and Devil are counting on you destroying that puppet.<br>
Otherwise, I don't think they would've shown themselves just to provoke you.<br>
<span style="color:#ffc960;">Helena META：</span><br>
Understood. D, help us approach the target. We'll proceed from there.<br>
<span style="color:#5ce6ff;">Miss D：</span><br>
How many times do I have to say it?! No whale, no dice! Not happening!<br>
<span style="color:#ffc960;">Helena META：</span><br>
Fine. I'll do it for you, then.<br>
Resource diversion, data transfer mode.<br>
<br>
A current like a blue collage rushes out of the communicator and engulfs Miss D.<br>
Instantly after, Miss D and Helena appear behind Rodney.<br>
<span style="color:#bdbdbd;">Rodney：</span><br>
...?<br>
<span style="color:#5ce6ff;">Miss D：</span><br>
Hwuh? What's going on? Whoa, whoa, whoa!<br>
<span style="color:#ffc960;">Helena META：</span><br>
Hacking... Complete.<br>
Overwriting... Complete.<br>
Rodney. In accordance with the Commander's wishes, resculpt yourself as a META.<br>
<br>
Gentle blue light covers Rodney. Her battered form recovers in an instant.<br>
The corrosion wafting in the air disappears all at once, as if washed away by the current.<br>
When it ends...<br>
<span style="color:#c3abff;">Rodney META：</span><br>
So you've called "me" here.<br>
<span style="color:#ffc960;">Helena META：</span><br>
If I hadn't, you would have been swallowed whole by the concept. Don't thank me – thank the Commander.<br>
<span style="color:#c3abff;">Rodney META：</span><br>
......<br>
Very well.<br>
<br>
Thus, the battle in the Martyrium sky came to an abrupt end.<br>

<br>
Martyrium Core - At the Basilica<br>
<span style="color:#5ce6ff;">Alsace：</span><br>
One will now secure the path to the crystal!<br>
<br>
KABOOOM!<br>
<span style="color:#bdbdbd;">Hatakaze META：</span><br>
This is as far as you go, youngling.<br>
<span style="color:#5ce6ff;">Mogador：</span><br>
The META Hatakaze...<br>
<span style="color:#5ce6ff;">Alsace：</span><br>
Commander, Hatakaze spotted! Requesting orders!<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
That really is the control center, then. Rodney's been neutralized! It's about time you surrender!<br>
<span style="color:#bdbdbd;">Hatakaze META：</span><br>
Heheh, heheheh... You never cease to amaze.<br>
But you seem to have forgotten something. Control of the Martyrium is still in my hands.<br>
<span style="color:#ffc960;">Queen Elizabeth META：</span><br>
Is it really, now?<br>
<br>
After a burst of dazzling light, another structure appears above the holy icon – the gate of Camelot.<br>
<span style="color:#bdbdbd;">Hatakaze META：</span><br>
Wha–?!<br>
<span style="color:#ffc960;">Queen Elizabeth META：</span><br>
Our train is still parked at Camelot. Mirror Sea or not, did you think that a single car could carry more information than the entire train?<br>
We were only reluctant to use this method because we wanted to avoid damaging the train.<br>
You've appeared in person, and our servant has already cleaned up the corrosion of the Mirror Sea.<br>
How, pray tell, do you expect to control this place?<br>
"In this glorious celestial orbit, there is but one train." Get out of our train!<br>
<span style="color:#bdbdbd;">Hatakaze META：</span><br>
Kh...!<br>
Test site beta... I won't forget this!<br>
Blundering like this on the final step...<br>
I admit defeat. But rest assured, you have not won!<br>
<span style="color:#ffc960;">Queen Elizabeth META：</span><br>
You've said enough, rat!<br>
Now, with a little cleaning, that corrosion problem will be as good as gone!<br>
<br>
The holy icon in the center of the Martyrium spreads its wings once more.<br>
This time, the crystal exudes a holy light that shines upon the city.<br>
Under the power of the Iris, the complex loses its source of corrosion and turns to ash. Before long, the Mirror Sea is purified.<br>
<span style="color:#ffc960;">Queen Elizabeth META：</span><br>
Phew... Perfect.<br>
All that's left is to recover the whale–<br>
<span style="color:#5ce6ff;">The Whale：</span><br>
......<br>
<span style="color:#5ce6ff;">Miss D：</span><br>
That was my whale calling!<br>
Gaaaaah! The whale! My whale's running away again!<br>
<br>
An earsplitting roar accompanies the whale's ascent into the Martyrium sky.<br>
<span style="color:#5ce6ff;">Alsace：</span><br>
Death's Shadow is defeated. If Miss D doesn't have control of the whale, then who could possibly...<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Damn it! Devil?!<br>
She lay in hiding all this time just to make us fight Hatakaze so she could steal the whale at the last minute?!<br>
She played us like a fiddle!<br>
<span style="color:#ffc960;">Wichita META：</span><br>
As cunning as ever... Had us fooled, too.<br>
<span style="color:#ffc960;">Helena META：</span><br>
Likewise. I'm sorry...<br>
<span style="color:#5ce6ff;">Miss D：</span><br>
Nuh-uh! No apologizing right now!<br>
Whale time! Follow that whaaale!<br>
<span style="color:#ffc960;">Queen Elizabeth META：</span><br>
Wait! We need to recover the train car first!<br>
<span style="color:#5ce6ff;">Miss D：</span><br>
Forget the damn train! Whale, whale, whale!<br>
WHAAAAALE!<br>
<span style="color:#ffc960;">Queen Elizabeth META：</span><br>
Ugh... Fine!<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Let's get back to the Queen's Light first.<br>
<span style="color:#ffc960;">Helena META：</span><br>
Hold on. I can't let you go, Commander.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Helena?<br>
<span style="color:#ffc960;">Queen Elizabeth META：</span><br>
Agreed. This pursuit is fraught with danger. It isn't part of the original plan.<br>
Commander, return with the Iris fleet. Be careful on the way – you're in a battlefield until you're home.<br>
<br>
Elizabeth dismisses me before I can speak up. Then, she thrusts a small pamphlet into my hands.<br>
<span style="color:#ffc960;">Queen Elizabeth META：</span><br>
An instruction manual on the gate of Camelot. Use it as directed, and you will make it to test site beta just fine.<br>
<span style="color:#ffc960;">Helena META：</span><br>
That isn't necessary. I can teach the Commander myself.<br>
<span style="color:#ffc960;">Queen Elizabeth META：</span><br>
Why must you argue over this... Fine. Do as you please.<br>
<span style="color:#ffc960;">Helena META：</span><br>
......<br>
The Martyrium can't be left in this state.<br>
Such an enormous spatial impact event will attract other factions before long. We have to eliminate all traces of it while we still can.<br>
...I'll turn this Mirror Sea back into train cars and deliver it back to test side beta.<br>
<span style="color:#ffc960;">Queen Elizabeth META：</span><br>
Much obliged. We leave it in your hands.<br>
<span style="color:#5ce6ff;">Miss D：</span><br>
Bye, mysterious assistant! See ya later!<br>
<br>
While the Queen's Light disappeared – a few cars lighter than it had arrived – the Ashes prepared to depart as well.<br>
<span style="color:#ffc960;">Wichita META：</span><br>
That resculpted META Rodney isn't a threat anymore.<br>
I doubt she'll come with us. Mind if we leave her with you, Helena?<br>
<span style="color:#ffc960;">Helena META：</span><br>
Not at all. Are you two going already?<br>
<span style="color:#ffc960;">Wichita META：</span><br>
Yeah. Hunting down Arbiters isn't our job.<br>
We confirmed the cause of the spatial impact event, so it's about time for us to go home.<br>
...It was a pleasure to fight alongside you. You're as reliable as ever, Helena.<br>
<span style="color:#ffc960;">Helena META：</span><br>
I have no idea what you're talking about.<br>
<span style="color:#ffc960;">Wichita META：</span><br>
Ahahahaha! Guess there's nothing to do but say goodbye, then!<br>
Hope we meet again, Helena.<br>
And boy, do I hope I never run into you test site beta folk again.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
I'm afraid I can't make any guarantees there.<br>
It's been an honor. Give Friedrich my regards.<br>
<span style="color:#ffc960;">Wichita META：</span><br>
Will do.<br>
<span style="color:#ffc960;">Helena META：</span><br>
Commander, take those girls back to Camelot. I won't be far behind.<br>
<br>
Thus, our part in the impromptu hunting trip had come to an end.<br>
Our visitors from other branches returned to their respective homes, too.<br>
All with their own ideals in mind. All ruminating on the future.<br>
All listening in to the distant voice echoing amidst the stars.<br>

Somewhere, in an unknown location...<br>
Camelot - Garden<br>
Sometime later<br>
Three of the Queen's Light's train cars sit silently amid the grass and foliage in the garden.<br>
<span style="color:#ffc960;">Helena META：</span><br>
Undoing materialization in the Martyrium. Eliminating all signs of combat and leftover data...<br>
Phew. I can finally bring you back home.<br>
But before that, you look like you have questions.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Keen as always. What's going to happen to Rodney?<br>
<span style="color:#ffc960;">Helena META：</span><br>
She's in an extremely unstable state right now. I need to bring her back home for treatment.<br>
Don't worry about her. I promise you'll meet her again soon.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Thank goodness.<br>
<span style="color:#ffc960;">Helena META：</span><br>
Anything else you're wondering about?<br>
<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项1：Nope. That was all.</span>'''''<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项2：How does a resculpting work?</span>'''''<br>

'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项1）</span>'''''Really?<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项1）</span>'''''You don't want to know about the resculpting process?<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项1）</span>'''''Will you tell me if I ask?<br>
<span style="color:#ffc960;">Helena META：</span><br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项1）</span>'''''No. All you need to know is it's a special stage of METAmorphosis that's dangerous and unstable.<br>
<span style="color:#ffc960;">Helena META：</span><br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项2）</span>'''''Like I told you just a while ago, it's a special stage of METAmorphosis. Dangerous and unstable, as you'll remember.<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项2）</span>'''''I'll tell you this – if you hadn't made that decision as quickly as you did, Rodney wouldn't be alive right now.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>

<span style="color:#ffc960;">Helena META：</span><br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项2）</span>'''''Yes? What about them?<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>

<span style="color:#ffc960;">Helena META：</span><br>

<span style="color:#ffc960;">Helena META：</span><br>
One META – Elizabeth – was with you on this operation. Were there any more?<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
No. She would've liked to bring her META subjects with her, but let's just say she had to go alone.<br>
<span style="color:#ffc960;">Helena META：</span><br>
Right. "Alone."<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Did I say something wrong?<br>

<br>
There was total darkness, broken up only by the faint light of an instrument panel.<br>
The place was abuzz with electrical noise and the sound of running machines – it was a control room of some sort.<br>
<span style="color:#ff9b93;">Arbiter: The Devil XV：</span><br>
Gee, it's kind of dark.<br>
<br>
A girl sat amid the chaotic crisscross of dozens of wires, preoccupied with what was right in front of her.<br>
<span style="color:#ff9b93;">Arbiter: The Devil XV：</span><br>
If I force-boot it... it'll push the power system to its limit.<br>
Have to focus on hacking the security instead.<br>
Then the first thing I'll do is turn the lights back on.<br>
Ugh... This place is too damn dark.<br>
<span style="color:#ffc960;">Sheffield META：</span><br>

Test Site Beta - Outer Defensive Perimeter<br>
Two Arbiters, the Lovers and the Empress, had erected a defensive line to ward off the invasion of the X.<br>
This clash between the unstoppable and the immovable was still being waged.<br>
<span style="color:#bdbdbd;">Bon Homme Richard：</span><br>
You people make me laugh.<br>
Come on, can't you call it quits already?<br>
I'm only gonna pay a small visit. You're being dramatic about this.<br>
Look at yourselves. You've constructed an airtight defensive line, and what good has it done?<br>
Test site beta is already a giant mess, and I haven't even gotten in yet.<br>
Like, what's the point in keeping me out?<br>
<span style="color:#5ce6ff;">Arbiter: The Lovers VI：</span><br>
Your logic is flawed.<br>
Allowing you inside would only make a bad situation even worse.<br>
I told you before – your battlefield is HERE.<br>
You're patient, no? Then show us how patient you can be.<br>

<br>
Somewhere, in test site F-45733...<br>
<span style="color:#5ce6ff;">Arbiter: Strength VIII：</span><br>
We've arrived at the objective, albeit 14 hours and 13 minutes behind schedule.<br>
The Ashes proved more resilient than anticipated. They've likely dispatched members here as well.<br>
We also encountered an abnormal type of jamming en route.<br>
Had it not been for that impact, we would've arrived sooner.<br>
Who the hell tried to stop us?<br>
<span style="color:#5ce6ff;">Arbiter: Temperance XIV：</span><br>
Unknown. No data matching characteristics found in database.<br>
<span style="color:#5ce6ff;">Arbiter: Strength VIII：</span><br>
So it's a new enemy we've never recorded across any of our test sites, huh.<br>
Color me intrigued.<br>
<span style="color:#5ce6ff;">Arbiter: The Hermit IX：</span><br>
Temperance, what're our prospects of extracting any data from the void?<br>
<span style="color:#5ce6ff;">Arbiter: Temperance XIV：</span><br>
Searching. Analyzing. None.<br>
This area has been scrubbed completely clean. Agent responsible possesses remarkable skill.<br>
Not even I possess the ability to perform a scrub leaving no traces.<br>
Only known agents possibly capable of this are Tower and Magician.<br>
<span style="color:#5ce6ff;">Arbiter: The Hermit IX：</span><br>
They didn't answer our request for reinforcements. There's no way either of 'em were here.<br>
<span style="color:#5ce6ff;">Arbiter: Temperance XIV：</span><br>
Then it must be an agent of equal skill to them.<br>
There is simply nothing here.<br>
Identifying cause and origin of the spatial impact event is impossible.<br>
Mission failed. Proceed with first task on mission list following submission of after-action report.<br>
<span style="color:#5ce6ff;">Arbiter: The Hermit IX：</span><br>
Submitting the report now.<br>
...Hey, I just got an urgent message from Empress.<br>
<span style="color:#5ce6ff;">Arbiter: Strength VIII：</span><br>
"Risk of test site beta running out of control... Requesting Arbiters to perform calming measures"?<br>
What's she also doing over in test bite beta?<br>
<span style="color:#5ce6ff;">Arbiter: Temperance XIV：</span><br>
It is a special site.<br>
Owing particularly to the entity known as "the Commander."<br>
An all-out attack is not an option; neither is not attacking. A bothersome dilemma.<br>
Requesting permission to join Lovers at defensive line.<br>
<span style="color:#5ce6ff;">Arbiter: The Hermit IX：</span><br>
Well, Empress hasn't set our assignments in stone, so if you wanna go, now's your chance.<br>
*sigh*... Back to test site beta we go.<br>

Orthodoxy Holy Capital - Conference Venue<br>
Commander's Lounge<br>
Following the operation's conclusion<br>
I gather up my resolve and open the door to my lounge.<br>
The inside looks practically the same as I left it. There's no one here to welcome me back, either.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
(Phew. Elizabeth and Richelieu really did cover for me. No one caught on.)<br>
(There's a lot, and I mean A LOT to think about for this operation. I've kept some notes, but they're rough.)<br>
(I'd better write down the details while they're still fresh in my memory.)<br>
<span style="color:#5ce6ff;">Computer：</span><br>
BEEP BEEP!<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Hm? A message as soon as I get back?<br>
(Huh... It's from the Eagle Union.)<br>
"There has been an as-of-yet unexplained incident in the Pacific."<br>
"During a 48-hour period, a large number of naval bases received large quantities of data which all contradict one another."<br>
"Additionally, contact with PH was briefly lost, determined later to be due to communication line issues."<br>
"Commander, you are to remain in the Orthodoxy for your own safety. Proceed with the conference as normal."<br>
"Enterprise is in charge of monitoring the Pacific situation as it develops. She will contact you with any eventual updates."<br>
I'm so confused by... whatever this is.<br>
What do they mean by "unexplained incident"?<br>
(I don't recognize the sender either. Could be Naval HQ, could be someone I know.)<br>
(Although, given how scarce the details are, it's probably Naval HQ. Something happened and they can't explain it.)<br>
I'll just let this simmer for a bit then call Enterprise and Saratoga.<br>
(I wonder if this happened specifically in the Pacific...)<br>
(It's adjacent to many factions. The Eagle Union, Northern Parliament, Sakura Empire, even the Dragon Empery.)<br>
(The Royal Navy, Iron Blood, and Iris Orthodoxy all have bases there, too.)<br>
(At any rate, I'll make some calls and check if anyone knows something.)<br>
(The lack of details about this "incident" gives me some major premonitions, though...)<br>
(I really hope my fears prove unfounded.)<br>

The storm rages across the waters, through a night that knows no end.<br>
Within the tempest lingers one lonesome vessel.<br>
Will the storm's rage first be quelled, or will this vessel first capsize?<br>
Will a ray of light bring hope through the darkness?<br>
.......<br>
For I am but an oneiric butterfly, fluttering among illusions.<br>
May light guide this vessel. May hope guide the Sakura Empire.<br>
Diadem of Light - Morning<br>
<span style="color:#5ce6ff;">Noshiro：</span><br>
This ritual is only performed when a crisis threatens our Empire... I never thought WE would do it one day.<br>
<span style="color:#5ce6ff;">Ryuuhou：</span><br>
Yes. When the times are the darkest, that is when Lady Shinano's power matters most.<br>
She is our symbol of hope, and if we can get her to officiate the ritual as well...<br>
Then I'm certain our Empire will find the right path, dispel the darkness, and restore the light.<br>
<span style="color:#5ce6ff;">Noshiro：</span><br>
While I hope so, too, the ritual is a major burden on Lady Shinano.<br>
<span style="color:#5ce6ff;">Ryuuhou：</span><br>
It is. That is why we, as ritual participants, must do everything we can to alleviate her burden even a little.<br>
<span style="color:#5ce6ff;">Noshiro：</span><br>
That, and to try not to slow her down.<br>
Now, I would like you to prepare the dance for the participants, as well as decide how to conduct the matches.<br>
And Suruga... Are you good? You've been fairly quiet.<br>
<span style="color:#5ce6ff;">Suruga：</span><br>
Huh? Yes, um, I'm just fine.<br>
<span style="color:#5ce6ff;">Noshiro：</span><br>
You don't have to be so nervous. We're all doing this together. If you have any thoughts, I'd like to hear them.<br>
<span style="color:#5ce6ff;">Suruga：</span><br>
Well, uh... It's not really our job to perform the dance before the ritual, is it?<br>
<span style="color:#5ce6ff;">Noshiro：</span><br>
...Right. I'll go have another look around.<br>
<span style="color:#5ce6ff;">Ryuuhou：</span><br>
The dance IS a part of the ritual. We must put as much effort into it as anything else.<br>
Since we have to do it, we should try to be excited about it.<br>
<span style="color:#5ce6ff;">Suruga：</span><br>
Me, I just want the ritual to end without any incidents.<br>
<span style="color:#5ce6ff;">Shinano ：</span><br>
(Is this... the Diadem of Light?)<br>
(This one was in the Orthodoxy's capital but a moment ago... How?)<br>
(Ahh... 'Tis another dream...)<br>
(I remember... Whilst I was asleep, they were preparing the ritual.)<br>
(I can neither speak, nor move... Neither could I that day...)<br>
<br>
*knock knock*<br>
<span style="color:#5ce6ff;">Kinu：</span><br>
Ryuuhou, Akagi's crew are about to arrive any minute now.<br>
<span style="color:#5ce6ff;">Noshiro：</span><br>
It is time to make our move, Ryuuhou.<br>
<span style="color:#5ce6ff;">Ryuuhou：</span><br>
...Yes, of course.<br>
This ritual will decide the future of the Sakura Empire.<br>
As representatives of our great land, we must not fail!<br>
Now, everyone, get into your respective positions!<br>
<span style="color:#5ce6ff;">Everyone：</span><br>
Understood!<br>
<span style="color:#5ce6ff;">Ryuuhou：</span><br>
After years of suffering... No, we've been training for this very moment, and it is time to show the entire world our might!<br>
<span style="color:#5ce6ff;">Shinano ：</span><br>
On that day, this one also witnessed the ritual within one's dreams...<br>
However, though the greater picture was true, the details diverged.<br>
Ahh, I am but in my own bedchamber...<br>
So why, then, do I feel so alone?<br>
<br>
The dreamwaker sees the light of the Dawning Ceremony...<br>
...Crimson-dyed intrigue. Otherworldly explosions. The house of faith, sundered by a charred blade.<br>
The dreamwaker sees her valiant comrades, stemming back the tides of chaos to complete the ceremony.<br>
At last, drifting within the vast sea between worlds, the dreamwaker stirs.<br>
Crimson, scarlet, vermilion. Red, bouncing all around.<br>
<span style="color:#5ce6ff;">Shinano ：</span><br>
...The Sacred Sakura has withered. The Mizuho islands are ablaze.<br>
...A dream luring one to destruction, and a red color that reduces all to ash.<br>
...Why?<br>
...This one must awaken and tell others of these omens...<br>
...Why can't I? Why do I feel so powerless?<br>
<br>
The shades of red bounced ever closer. The dream came apart, crumbled, collapsed.<br>
<span style="color:#5ce6ff;">Shinano ：</span><br>
...Ahh... Even in my dreams, my home is being taken from me...<br>
Lonesome and feeble still... This one hasn't changed...<br>
Naught can I do but follow fate and walk the path...<br>
But perhaps... that isn't so bad...<br>
<br>
Shinano looked directly at the red, contemplating neither running away nor giving up.<br>
<span style="color:#5ce6ff;">Shinano ：</span><br>
If you seek to turn that stands behind me to ash, you will first have to burn through me!<br>
<br>
Just as the flames were about to engulf her, a wind chime rang out.<br>
