Chapter 1 - A Kotatsu in the Winter<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">{namecode:79}：</span><br>
Phew... there's nothing quite like a warm kotatsu during the winter...<br>
Ahh... I don't want to ever get out...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">{namecode:78}：</span><br>
My, my, is that how you should be acting?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">{namecode:79}：</span><br>
Ehh? But Fusou, you look pretty cozy too...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">{namecode:78}：</span><br>
Umm... *cough*<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">{namecode:79}：</span><br>
It's not like I have a choice... it's way too cold this year...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">{namecode:78}：</span><br>
We're going to get all chubby at this rate. Even if it's cold, we're going to need to get some exercise.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">{namecode:79}：</span><br>
Ehh? In this weather? What kind of stuff is there to do?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">{namecode:78}：</span><br>
Hmm... how about cold-water freediving? We'd also be able to show some guts in the process. Heehee~<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">{namecode:79}：</span><br>
Jeez, Fusou, don't even make jokes about that... just thinking about it is making me cold...<br>

Chapter 2 - Cold-Water Swim Meet?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">{namecode:79}：</span><br>
Aah... Aachoo!<br>
Ughh... I knew it'd be freezing outside... Huh? Who's that...?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">{namecode:77}：</span><br>
Yo, if it isn't Yamashiro! Are you out for a stroll?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">{namecode:79}：</span><br>
Umm... not quite... I'm just on my way to the store... Brrr...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">{namecode:76}：</span><br>
A poor showing, Yamashiro! How could a battleship of the Sakura Empire allow herself to be bested by a little cold?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">{namecode:79}：</span><br>
Ise, Hyuuga... you two aren't cold...?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">{namecode:77}：</span><br>
Heh. All you need is a little guts, and the cold won't be an issue at all!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">{namecode:76}：</span><br>
As a matter of fact, we're organizing a cold-water swim meet. Heheh, we're also going to grab those Eagle Union blokes and let them see what the Sakura Empire is made of!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">{namecode:77}：</span><br>
How 'bout it, Yamashiro? Want to join?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">{namecode:79}：</span><br>
Eep... I, um, I think I'm good... achoo!!<br>

Chapter 3 - A Lost Gift Pt. 1<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">{namecode:79}：</span><br>
Cold-water swim meet, huh... That reminds me, I had to do a purification ritual like that last New Year's... <br>
I suppose... I have been a bit lazy recently...<br>
Milord did give me a swimsuit for the summer...<br>
If I remember correctly, it should be over here...<br>
Huh? It's not here...?<br>

Chapter 4 - A Lost Gift Pt. 2<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">{namecode:79}：</span><br>
Uuuuu... just where could it be...?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">{namecode:78}：</span><br>
Hm? Yamashiro, are you looking for something? This place is a mess.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">{namecode:79}：</span><br>
Fusou, I can't... find the swimsuit... that Milord gave me... waaah!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">{namecode:78}：</span><br>
……<br>
Oh, you... Didn't you keep it in a separate place because it was a special gift that you received from Commander?<br>
See? It's right here.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">{namecode:79}：</span><br>
Yay! Thank you so much, Fusou... Uuu...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">{namecode:78}：</span><br>
Why are you looking for your swimsuit all of a sudden? Don't tell me...<br>
You're actually going to join that cold-water swim meet?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">{namecode:79}：</span><br>
Mm... I ran into Hyuuga outside. It made me realize that as a member of the Sakura Fleet, I can't afford to fall behind...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">{namecode:78}：</span><br>
My, aren't you the hard worker~<br>
We don't get an opportunity like this often, so why not ask Commander to participate as well?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">{namecode:79}：</span><br>
D-Don't tease me like that, Fusou...! Besides, there's no way Milord will have time to spare, with all the work...<br>

Actually, umm...<br>
So that's why... we should all participate together! No guts, no glory!<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
……<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">{namecode:79}：</span><br>
Y-you don't wanna? I even took out the swimsuit that you gave me, Milord...<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
*nods* ...!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">{namecode:79}：</span><br>
Really?! Ehehe... In that case, let's go check on Hyuuga and the others!<br>

<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Saratoga：</span><br>
Ah... Achoo!! Wh-why did I agree to participate in this meet in this first place...? It's practically hazing!!<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
……<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">{namecode:79}：</span><br>
……<br>
You seem... pretty cold...<br>
M-Maybe we should find some other kind of training...? This doesn't seem very healthy. Don't you agree, Milord?<br>

<span style="color:#4eb24e;">{namecode:79}：</span><br>
Fwaahh... I can feel my hitpoints recovering~!<br>
Heehee, nothing beats a soak in the hot springs during the winter!<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
But what about training?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">{namecode:79}：</span><br>
T-training? Can't that wait 'til summer...?<br>
Milord, perhaps you don't like being in the hot springs with me?<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
That's not it!!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">{namecode:79}：</span><br>
Ehehe... Did you know? I've always treasured that swimsuit that you bought for me~<br>
We've had to endure a whole lot of hardships up until now, and surely... more will await us in the future...<br>
But as long as we're all together, we can accomplish anything!<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
That's right!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">{namecode:79}：</span><br>
So... please continue to guide us forward, Milord~!<br>
