After sailing halfway across the world, we’ve finally reached the Far East again.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Prince of Wales：</span><br>
The sea breeze here is not quite the same as the Atlantic Ocean... yes, it seems to have a taste of sourness in the air~<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Repulse：</span><br>
This isn't my first time here... Last time, I upheld the prestige of the Royal Navy alongside my elder sister ship Hood..<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Prince of Wales：</span><br>
…<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Repulse：</span><br>
Oh...I'm sorry, I didn't mean to deliberately bring it up<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Prince of Wales：</span><br>
The Sakura Empire is sneaking around. For the sake of the Royal Navy's honor, they shall be stopped without advancing an inch in this area.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Repulse：</span><br>
Understood, advance forward fleet ---- "Let's go find some trouble!"<br>

<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Vampire：</span><br>
Unknown enemy planes ahead, no fleet detected nearby!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Prince of Wales：</span><br>
Damn, we have been discovered, is there a submarine in the area?<br>
It's ok, those bombers are no match for our battleships, keep advancing, ready all anti-aircraft guns!<br>

It's rumored that the Army Air Corps just discovered a big catch, the Royal Navy is currently out of port.<br>
<span style="color:#ff0000;">{{AF|Atago}}：</span><br>
Hmmmm, after traveling halfway across the world, they finally started their attack. Let's stir things up then.<br>
On my command! Full-speed south! Let's intercept the Z-fleet.<br>

<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Repulse：</span><br>
Another wave of torpedoes incoming, emergency maneuvers!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Prince of Wales：</span><br>
Ahh... damn, the situation wouldn't be so dire if the Indomitable didn't strike that rock...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Repulse：</span><br>
Is this the end of the line...? Didn't realize a swarm of aircraft is so hard to deal with.<br>
Haw-haw, these big guns can no longer keep up with the times… I really want to shower the enemy with a volley... but...<br>
My sister ship Hood, I really miss the time when we traveled around the world...<br>

<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Prince of Wales：</span><br>
If I were to face the same situation again, what would I do if I were you...Admiral Hood...<br>
……<br>
Very well.<br>
At least this time... I'll face the enemy head on...<br>
For the Queen!<br>

<span style="color:#ff0000;">{{AF|Atago}}：</span><br>
Ahhaha~ She’s like a steel giant, so fragile while under torpedo attack. What a pity.<br>
Our credit was stolen by the Army Air Corps, which was not expected. It seems we need to play smarter in the future.<br>
<span style="color:#ff0000;">{{AF|Kongou}}：</span><br>
Well, at this point, the sisters of the First, Second, and Fifth fleets should have started their attack on the other side of the ocean.<br>
<span style="color:#ff0000;">{{AF|Atago}}：</span><br>
Hehehe, interesting, seems the world will soon become a livelier reality.<br>
Wait and see. A new era is about to begin.<br>
