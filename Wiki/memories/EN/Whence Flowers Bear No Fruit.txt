<br>
1 The Guardian Fox's Departure<br>
Sakura Islands<br>
Mikasa's Mansion<br>
July 23rd<br>
Prior to the widespread chaos in the Pacific, Nagato and her escorts visited Mikasa's mansion.<br>
It was a busy scene, with supplies being hauled back and forth.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Kawakaze：</span><br>
Be careful not to bump into anything. Wrap your goods, then take them straight to the pier. Make sure EVERYTHING is there!<br>
Harutsuki, how are the preparations going? This will be a long journey.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Harutsuki：</span><br>
They're going w-well! The ship Lady Musashi sent has arrived and is docked at the pier!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Kawakaze：</span><br>
Great. Thanks.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Shoukaku：</span><br>
THAT was fast, considering how urgently we're leaving.<br>
Perhaps the powers that be planned for that, though.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Zuikaku：</span><br>
Hellooo? Lady Nagato!<br>
Hey, Kawakaze, any idea where she is?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Kawakaze：</span><br>
She is in the mansion, preparing for the journey. Do you have business with her?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Zuikaku：</span><br>
Yeah, you could say that. I'll be quick, I promise!<br>
<br>
Mikasa's Mansion - Nagato's Room<br>
*knock knock*<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Zuikaku：</span><br>
Lady Nagato! It's me, Zuikaku!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Nagato：</span><br>
Zuikaku? Come in.<br>
Is there something wrong with the supplies? I assume that is why you've come to me unannounced.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Zuikaku：</span><br>
Oh, uh, no! I had a quick look around the pier and everything seemed to be in order and on schedule.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Nagato：</span><br>
That's good. Well? Why are you here, then?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Zuikaku：</span><br>
It's about the journey itself... Doesn't it smell fishy to you? It came completely out of left field.<br>
It's business as usual in the Pacific, yet Mikasa is sending you and a large fleet to the Solomon Islands with heaps of supplies.<br>
Unless this is her idea of a vacation, I don't understand why she'd do this.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Nagato：</span><br>
Yes, I do find it strange. Alas, all that she told me was that, "something has happened in the Solomons," and that she wanted me to investigate immediately.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Zuikaku：</span><br>
The "immediately" part of that is pretty weird, too!<br>
What if she knows something is going to happen on the mainland and she's intentionally sending you away?<br>
Akagi did that once, so it wouldn't be the first time.<br>
Then there's the time we went to Europa and she made up an excuse for me to take a long detour along the Cape of Good Hope.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Nagato：</span><br>
Had these orders come from Musashi, I would share your suspicions. However, Mikasa would never misdirect us like this.<br>
Still, you may be right that something big will happen in our homeland. Something which I am in the dark about.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Zuikaku：</span><br>
Right? That's why I'd like to stay here and look into it!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Nagato：</span><br>
That is a tall ask.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Zuikaku：</span><br>
I mean, Mikasa is basically sending away her own bodyguards. Who will protect her if we're all away?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Nagato：</span><br>
Hmm...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Zuikaku：</span><br>
Plus, I can report straight to you immediately if I see anything suspicious happen!<br>
Please! I promise I won't slack off for even a minute!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Nagato：</span><br>
...Very well. Then I have a request to ask of you.<br>
Mutsu has not been feeling well lately. Go and visit her on my behalf before we set off.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Zuikaku：</span><br>
Huh? Uh, okay!<br>
I just have one question...<br>
Does Mutsu herself know that she's ill?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Nagato：</span><br>
She will when you come to visit. If she does not, use the right words until she gets the hint.<br>
If that is all, then you should go.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Zuikaku：</span><br>
Understood! I will not disappoint you!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Nagato：</span><br>
The tree yearns for stillness, but the wind does not let up...<br>
Great Veteran, I will leave now.<br>
Please... do not do anything foolish.<br>

<br>
2 Trailing the Mountains<br>
Nagato and her fleet left for the Solomon Islands on a sudden redeployment.<br>
Right before that, though, Zuikaku paid a visit to Mutsu, and she suddenly "fell ill."<br>
With the guardian fox's sister in need of a caretaker, Zuikaku was allowed to remain on the mainland.<br>
Somewhere, in the Sakura Islands...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Zuikaku：</span><br>
Whew... Now that Lady Nagato has set off, Akagi and her co-conspirators must've lowered their guard.<br>
This gives me some time to work unimpeded.<br>
Finally, I have the golden opportunity to properly investigate what they've been scheming!<br>
...Huh? Is that... Musashi and her massive transport fleet? And Mikasa is with them?<br>
I knew staking out this place was the right call.<br>
Alright. If I follow them, I should find out where they're heading!<br>
<br>
Sakura Islands - Yakumoyama<br>
Yakumoyama has long since been famous as a sightseeing area.<br>
However, it has been fenced off ever since it was declared a holy site following the last Great War.<br>
Zuikaku trailed Musashi and Mikasa along the mountain path as they passed several checkpoints along the way.<br>
Then, she could do little but watch as their figures faded into the distance.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Zuikaku：</span><br>
Hardly anyone has been here since this place was declared sacred...<br>
What reason do they have to be here? Especially with such a huge convoy...<br>
There are too many guards. I can't follow them any further without getting spotted. I guess I'll have to stop here...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Zuihou：</span><br>
Chirp, chirp! You, hiding in the forest! Come out! I know you're there!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Zuikaku：</span><br>
(Crap! It's Zuihou.)<br>
(I was so focused on the convoy that I forgot to pay any attention to what's behind me...)<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Zuihou：</span><br>
Did you hear me? Come out now or I'm gonna call the guards! You have ten seconds!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Zuikaku：</span><br>
(Dammit... I'm BOUND to get in trouble if she keeps yelling like this!)<br>
(Ah, screw it. She's already seen me anyway.)<br>
(I can just make up some excuse for Zuihou. If I'm lucky, she might even help with the investigation.)<br>
Shhh! Keep your voice down!<br>
I'm not anyone suspicious! It's me, Zuikaku!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Zuihou：</span><br>
Chirp? Zuikaku?<br>
Why were you hiding in the bushes?<br>
Did you find something fun back there?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Zuikaku：</span><br>
There's nothing fun in the bushes, kid. But I AM on a fun mission. Wanna hear about it?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Zuihou：</span><br>
Ooh! A fun mission! Tell me!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Zuikaku：</span><br>
Heh. Well, long story short...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Zuihou：</span><br>
Ohh, I get it! You're here to do sightseeing around the mountain!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Zuikaku：</span><br>
It's not "sightseeing," it's an investigation!<br>
I'm trailing Musashi and Mikasa and trying to stay out of sight. Sounds pretty fun, doesn't it?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Zuihou：</span><br>
Uh-huh! It does!<br>
That's why you were hiding in the bushes, right? Because you couldn't get into the mountain?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Zuikaku：</span><br>
Mhm. But you're smart and everyone loves you, Zuihou. You must know a way in, right?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Zuihou：</span><br>
I do! Shiranui gave me a note that lets me through all the checkpoints since I'm here to see her!<br>
If you wanna come with me, hide in the wagon. I'll bring you in in secret!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Zuikaku：</span><br>
You'll do that for me? Thanks so much!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Zuihou：</span><br>
Heehee! You're welcome!<br>
<br>
Thanks to that slip of paper, trailing Mikasa and Musashi got much easier for Zuikaku.<br>
After she and Zuihou followed the mountain path to its end, they came across a modest yet majestic wooden building.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Zuihou：</span><br>
If Musashi and Mikasa are here to talk, they're probably doing it in that place over there.<br>
I've gotta go see Shiranui now, so it's time for you to get off.<br>
Meet me here again when you wanna leave! I'll bring you back down the mountain!<br>
<br>
Following the path Zuihou pointed out, Zuikaku quickly found her way to the side of the building.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Zuikaku：</span><br>
Dang. I can hardly make out a word because the walls are soundproofed.<br>
Those are definitely Mikasa's and Musashi's voices, though...<br>
If they just wanted to talk, why would they come all the way out to such a remote location?<br>
Hm? Is there someone else in there?<br>
Is that... Izumo?<br>
What did she say? "Work together"? On what?<br>
Ugh, I can't hear them... I wish I could sneak inside!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">???：</span><br>
Don't think I don't see you eavesdropping!<br>
<br>
Without any warning, Zuikaku's eyes were covered by someone behind her.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">???：</span><br>
Gueeess who!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Zuikaku：</span><br>
Zuihou! Cut it out!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Zuihou：</span><br>
Chirp! You actually got it on the first try!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Zuikaku：</span><br>
Shhh! Be quiet! And don't freak me out like that...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Zuihou：</span><br>
It's okay! They can't hear us from the inside.<br>
How'd your investigation go? Did you find anything?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Zuikaku：</span><br>
I found SOMETHING, but I can't talk about it here. Why? Are you leaving the mountain already?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Zuihou：</span><br>
Yep! Shiranui said something came up so she couldn't play with me. Are you gonna stay?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Zuikaku：</span><br>
Nah, I think I'll leave as well. Let's go.<br>
<br>
Sometime later...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Zuihou：</span><br>
Izumo? The blueprint lady?<br>
I don't think it's THAT weird that she's here.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Zuikaku：</span><br>
You don't?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Zuihou：</span><br>
I heard she attends religious ceremonies, and this is a holy mountain, so...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Zuikaku：</span><br>
Hmm. Maybe she just happens to be here by chance.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Zuihou：</span><br>
I wouldn't go that far. She's probably the mountain's guardian, or she works here.<br>
Because Musashi and Mikasa wouldn't come all the way out here if she didn't.<br>
They could just call her, or tell Izumo to visit them instead, you know?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Zuikaku：</span><br>
True. If a phone call was out of the question, those two have such high standing they could just make Izumo come to them instead.<br>
But, if Izumo can't leave the mountain for some reason, then what does she have to do with whatever they're planning?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Zuihou：</span><br>
Shh! More wagons are coming!<br>
<br>
Zuihou signaled for Zuikaku to hide, then quickly ran off to talk to the driver at the head of the line.<br>
Zuikaku watched as the wagons drove by, and noticed the small flags flying above their headlights.<br>
They were blue and featured a peculiar emblem – Tosa's emblem.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Zuihou：</span><br>
Okay, I'm back.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Zuikaku：</span><br>
Did you see those flags? That was Tosa's motorcade, wasn't it?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Zuihou：</span><br>
Mhm! This sure is a busy evening.<br>
What about it? You're not thinking about going back and eavesdropping again, are you?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Zuikaku：</span><br>
No, no way. That'd raise too much suspicion.<br>
It's getting dark. Let's get out of here!<br>
<br>
"Upon a horizonless field of crimson, drifting phantoms clump together."<br>
"Images of lost friends and old tales flood the mind."<br>
"Amagi, my dear sister... You never really left, did you?"<br>

<br>
3 The Prime Barrier<br>
As the sun set on the horizon, Zuikaku and Zuihou left the holy mountain's periphery.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Zuihou：</span><br>
Okay, you're in the clear now.<br>
I hope you enjoyed touring the holy mountain!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Zuikaku：</span><br>
Uh, yeah, ahaha... Thanks for everything!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Zuihou：</span><br>
Nighttime is coming soon so I'm gonna go home. What about you?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Zuikaku：</span><br>
Umm, I'm gonna...<br>
(I can't just go back to Mikasa's place now since I snuck out of Mutsu's house.)<br>
(Going home would also raise suspicions, since Shoukaku is on a sortie in the Solomons.)<br>
(There's no port near here, either. Even if there was, I have no excuse for being all the way out here!)<br>
(Is sleeping outside my only option? Do I really have to spend the night in the middle of nowhere?)<br>
<br>
Zuikaku's expression grows increasingly nervous. Zuihou notices and flashes a sweet smile.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Zuihou：</span><br>
Hey, how come you're still on the mainland, anyway? Didn't Lady Nagato's fleet leave earlier?<br>
Did you sneak off and now you've realized there's nowhere for you to go?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Zuikaku：</span><br>
No, I didn't sneak off, honest! It's just that Mutsu fell ill and I was tasked with looking after her.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Zuihou：</span><br>
Ohh, she fell ill?<br>
<br>
Zuihou looked in the general direction of Mutsu's house.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Zuikaku：</span><br>
Anyway, that doesn't matter!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Zuihou：</span><br>
I know! How about you stay at my house?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Zuikaku：</span><br>
Really? You'll let me do that?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Zuihou：</span><br>
Chirp, chirp! Yeah! Houshou gave me a house, and it's really, really big!<br>
It has lots of empty rooms which my friends use when we have sleepovers. You can stay, no problem!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Zuikaku：</span><br>
You're a lifesaver. Please show the way!<br>
<br>
The moon shone brightly overhead as the two arrived at the house. Already from just the door, it was clear this was a majestic building.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Zuihou：</span><br>
Here we are!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Zuikaku：</span><br>
THIS is what your place looks like?! It's basically as big as Mikasa's mansion!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Zuihou：</span><br>
Heehee. Houshou insisted that it had to be this big.<br>
Chirp! Look at the time. Let's go inside.<br>
I'll make dinner for you! I can't let any guest of mine go hungry!<br>
<br>
While Zuihou cooked in the kitchen, Zuikaku took a stroll around the garden.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Zuikaku：</span><br>
(This garden is well cared for. Look at all these flowers...)<br>
(Wait... Why have so many of them withered? I thought these varieties bloom during the summer?)<br>
(That's weird... The garden looks tip top, but the flowers don't...)<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Zuihou：</span><br>
Dinner is ready! How do you like my flowers? Aren't they pretty?<br>
I think they look pretty good both in the sunlight AND the moonlight!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Zuikaku：</span><br>
Uh, I don't know if you noticed, but...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Zuihou：</span><br>
What?! What happened to my flowers? They were blooming just yesterday!<br>
Can flowers even wither that quickly? They can't, right?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Zuikaku：</span><br>
That reminds me – I saw a lot of withered plants back at the mountain.<br>
I didn't think much of it then. Now, though... Something's clearly up here.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Zuihou：</span><br>
So it's not just my flowers... I wonder if something happened to the Prime Barrier.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Zuikaku：</span><br>
The what? What's the "Prime Barrier"?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Zuihou：</span><br>
It's the great, eternal barrier that covers the Sakura Islands and protects us!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Zuikaku：</span><br>
Huh. I might've heard about it from Lady Nagato, but I'm not sure.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Zuihou：</span><br>
Chirp. I guess you have selective attention, but that's fine.<br>
The Prime Barrier covers the entirety of the country, protecting it from outside threats.<br>
I've heard you can adjust it to change the weather, block out storms, and even make it rain.<br>
Basically, it's a super-duper important barrier!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Zuikaku：</span><br>
I had no idea that existed! Is it top-secret or something?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Zuihou：</span><br>
Hmm... I dunno. I'm pretty sure Yamashiro and others of her rank know about it, though.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Zuikaku：</span><br>
Uh-huh... So how come you know about it?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Zuihou：</span><br>
Yamashiro told me!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Zuikaku：</span><br>
Thought so...<br>
Hang on, does that barrier have anything to do with the rituals Lady Nagato performs with the Sacred Sakura?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Zuihou：</span><br>
Yup. She IS the guardian fox, you know. Officially, though, Yamato is in charge of maintaining the Prime Barrier.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Zuikaku：</span><br>
Officially?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Zuihou：</span><br>
Well, in practice, Musashi is the one who handles the barrier, because Yamato can't.<br>
Yamato lives in seclusion in Heaven's Gate, and the Sacred Sakura that maintain the Prime Barrier are all located OUTSIDE Heaven's Gate!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Zuikaku：</span><br>
Okay, so let's wind this back... You're saying you think the flowers withered because the Prime Barrier malfunctioned?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Zuihou：</span><br>
Mhm! It should be back in working order soon, so it's nothing to worry about.<br>
I feel bad for the poor flowers, though... This was their time to bloom... Chirp...<br>
<br>
*knock knock*<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ryuujou：</span><br>
Zuihou, are you home? I have come to hang out!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Zuihou：</span><br>
Oh, I think that's Ryuujou.<br>
You're not supposed to be here, right, Zuikaku? You should go hide.<br>
<br>
Zuikaku answered with a quiet nod, then slid the sliding door aside and hid in the room next to the kitchen.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Zuihou：</span><br>
I'm home! Just a minute!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ryuujou：</span><br>
Finally, you're back, Zuihou! I waited the whole day for you.<br>
Did you have fun visiting Yakumoyama?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Zuihou：</span><br>
It was beautiful! Though it wasn't really that fun.<br>
...Wait, you waited the whole day for me?<br>
Didn't you say you had a mission today? Something about special training out at sea?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ryuujou：</span><br>
I did... The mission was canceled at the last minute. I was only told that I was not to set sail.<br>
I thought it strange, so I asked around. Apparently, it wasn't just us shipgirls that were forbidden from sailing – civilian ships were, too.<br>
So, I went straight to you to ask if you knew anything!<br>
Incidentally, has Zuikaku paid you a visit?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Zuihou：</span><br>
Z-Zuikaku? Um, err...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ryuujou：</span><br>
I'm only asking because I saw her accompanying you inside. Is she still here, by any chance?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Zuihou：</span><br>
Wh-what? So when you said you waited for me the whole day, you meant you waited right outside my house?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ryuujou：</span><br>
Precisely! I hid behind the bushes and awaited your return!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Zuihou：</span><br>
......<br>
Zuikaku is, uhh... making dinner. Come inside and we'll talk over some food!<br>
Also, you must not tell anyone that Zuikaku was here!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ryuujou：</span><br>
Understood!<br>
<br>
With her cover blown, Zuikaku had no choice but to come out.<br>
The three sat down around the dinner table and discussed what they saw today while they ate.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Zuikaku：</span><br>
Nobody was allowed to leave, eh... I can see why the Prime Barrier malfunctioning would lead to that.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Zuihou：</span><br>
But the barrier has been running for ages, and any minor problems with it were fixed right away.<br>
It's never resulted in all ships being prohibited from sailing out to sea.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ryuujou：</span><br>
Then perhaps it was not a minor malfunction, but rather a major one?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Zuihou：</span><br>
I have no idea...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Zuikaku：</span><br>
Is there any way to determine what's going on?<br>
I think the fastest way would be to go there ourselves and see what's up.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Zuihou：</span><br>
Sure... The problem is, I don't have access to the Prime Barrier.<br>
Buuut... Yamashiro does!<br>
She lives nearby, and she probably won't tell us no if we all ask her together!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Zuikaku：</span><br>
(Hmm... Yeah, if anyone knows about barriers, it's got to be Yamashiro.)<br>
(Although, there's the risk that she'll let it slip to Akagi that I stayed behind on the mainland...)<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Zuihou：</span><br>
Zuikaku? Is something wrong?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Zuikaku：</span><br>
No, it's nothing. Let's talk to Yamashiro tomorrow since it's so late now.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Zuihou：</span><br>
Sure!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ryuujou：</span><br>
Then I suppose we have the night all to ourselves!<br>
If we can't visit Yamashiro, we can still play games.<br>
Zuihou, shall I call over Hiyou and Junyou to join us?<br>
I believe they're sitting idle at the moment, and the more the merrier, right?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Zuihou：</span><br>
Good idea! Wait... Are you okay with that, Zuikaku?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Zuikaku：</span><br>
I don't mind. When we visit Yamashiro tomorrow, the cat will be out of the bag anyway.<br>
Plus, I might need their help with my investigation later. Now's a good time to befriend them!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ryuujou：</span><br>
Pardon? What do you mean, "the cat will be out of the bag"?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Zuihou：</span><br>
It's nothing important! Go ahead and invite them over. I'll pick out a game for us to play meanwhile.<br>

Very well! I shall be right back!<br>

4 Ink-Stained Dream<br>
A while later, Ryuujou returned to Zuihou's house with Hiyou and Junyou in tow.<br>
They played games late into the night, then retired to their bedrooms.<br>
Zuikaku opened her eyes to an ink-stained scene of steel. She was back at the Sacred Sakura when she was trying to awaken Nagato.<br>
<span style="color:#ff9b93;">Kawakaze：</span><br>
Halt! Who are you?!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Shoukaku：</span><br>
We're the Sakura Empire's Reborn Combined Fleet, and we're here to have a look at the girl in the Sacred Sakura...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Zuikaku：</span><br>
(Huh? Why am I here?)<br>
<span style="color:#ff9b93;">Kawakaze：</span><br>
...Leave this place. None shall disturb the guardian fox's slumber.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Mikasa：</span><br>
Kawakaze... So you serve Amagi.<br>
We must speak with her. Won't you let us through?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Zuikaku：</span><br>
(Wait... Speak to Amagi? Not Lady Nagato?)<br>
<span style="color:#ff9b93;">Kawakaze：</span><br>
The guardian fox already carries a burden too great.<br>
I gave her my word that I would let no one disturb her slumber!<br>
No one! Not even our fellow countrymen.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Shoukaku：</span><br>
There's such a thing as being TOO stubborn... What if we insisted on seeing her?<br>
<span style="color:#ff9b93;">Kawakaze：</span><br>
If you'd push forward despite my warnings, you'd best prepare for a battle!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Zuikaku：</span><br>
(Something feels so wrong... But what?)<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Shoukaku：</span><br>
Zuikaku, focus! She's coming to attack us!<br>
<br>
KABOOOM!<br>
<span style="color:#ff9b93;">Kawakaze：</span><br>
I see now why you're decorated and revered...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Mikasa：</span><br>
You're a skilled fighter yourself. I'd expect as much from Amagi's aide.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Shoukaku：</span><br>
*cough cough*... Zuikaku, hurry!<br>
<span style="color:#ff9b93;">Kawakaze：</span><br>
Over my dead body!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Zuikaku：</span><br>
Shoukaku! Great Veteran!<br>
(No, wait... This isn't how it went!)<br>
<br>
KABOOOM!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Amagi：</span><br>
Kawakaze, step down.<br>
You've done well as my guardian, but I never asked you to repel guests with such ferocity.<br>
My sincere apologies to all of you. Kawakaze should have restrained herself better so as to not injure you.<br>
Please come to my mansion just up ahead and tend to your wounds.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Zuikaku：</span><br>
You're... You're Amagi, aren't you?<br>
Is that really you?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Amagi：</span><br>
Yes, it is me. I hope I've not slept in the Sacred Sakura for so long that I've been all but forgotten.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Zuikaku：</span><br>
Okay, uhh... Nice to meet you, I suppose?<br>
Sorry, I can't shake this feeling that something is wrong...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Amagi：</span><br>
Wrong? Yes, now that you mention it, something does feel off to me as well.<br>
What, precisely, do you feel is wrong?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Zuikaku：</span><br>
It's... Who is the guardian fox...<br>
And... who was sealed away in a slumber here...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">???：</span><br>
...ake up...<br>
Hey! Wake up!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Zuihou：</span><br>
You're finally up, sleepyhead!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Zuikaku：</span><br>
Huh? Whuh? Zuihou?<br>
Man, I just had the weirdest dream ever... Thanks for waking me up.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Zuihou：</span><br>
If only the dreams were the only weird thing happening right now...<br>
Look out the window! Everything is all messed up!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Zuikaku：</span><br>
Messed up?<br>
<br>
Zuikaku focused her gaze on the window. Zuihou had already pulled aside the curtains.<br>
Looking outside, she could clearly see what was happening.<br>
The trees had shrunk and all the old buildings on the street looked brand new, almost like time had reversed.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Zuikaku：</span><br>
I'm... not still dreaming, am I? Why does everything look like we went back in time?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Zuihou：</span><br>
I don't know, but it's not a dream! Ryuujou, Hiyou, and Junyou went out to see what had happened, and it's exactly like you just said!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Zuikaku：</span><br>
What about your house? Did it go back in time, too?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Zuihou：</span><br>
Luckily not, because mine's protected by one of Yamato's barriers.<br>
You see, the house had just been finished, and Ibuki came by to bless it with–<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Zuikaku：</span><br>
Ahem.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Zuihou：</span><br>
Oh, anyway, I got a message from Musashi earlier!<br>
This is apparently an illusion, and it happened because someone infiltrated the Prime Barrier.<br>
She said everything will go back to normal soon, and when it does, we have to sortie and locate the infiltrator!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Zuikaku：</span><br>
(Ohh! This is why Mikasa sent Lady Nagato so far away from the mainland!)<br>
(I need to gather intel quickly and relay the situation to her!)<br>
<br>
"The wedge has been driven in and the concept has been anchored."<br>
"The circle is finished and ready for the ritual to commence."<br>
"Soon, my dear sister. Soon."<br>

5 Misfortune Arriveth<br>
Sakura Islands - Yakumoyama<br>
A brilliantly moonlit night – that is what tonight was expected to be.<br>
Instead, thick clouds had gathered in the sky, blotting out all but a few streaks of moonlight.<br>
If you looked carefully, you could see the shadow of a tree's branches in the light.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Musashi：</span><br>
The ritual has begun...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Communicator：</span><br>
BEEP BEEP!<br>
<span style="color:#ffc960;">{namecode:91}：</span><br>
Just as we expected, the corruption is taking shape as the ritual proceeds.<br>
The Shadow of Corruption's embodiment is beginning to attack. We must intercept.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Musashi：</span><br>
I know.<br>
<br>
Musashi hung up the line and issued orders to the shipgirls under her command.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Musashi：</span><br>
(I told them not the truth about where this enemy is from.)<br>
(Although, it matters not. All they need do is be in position and annihilate them. Where the enemy comes from is unimportant.)<br>
(Let's just hope there won't be any more of them tonight...)<br>
<br>
She exhaled a sigh and looked up at the sky.<br>
There was a full, crimson moon and the branches and leaves of the Sacred Sakura, reaching toward the stars.<br>
Sometime later...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Communicator：</span><br>
BEEP BEEP!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Kii：</span><br>
Musashi, people are reporting visual and auditory hallucinations one after the next.<br>
Due to the likelihood of this causing unforeseen problems, I sent them all back to the harbor. Awaiting further orders.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Musashi：</span><br>
I know the situation. Bolster the harbor's defenses and remain on alert.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Kii：</span><br>
Yes, ma'am!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Musashi：</span><br>
(This is unexpected... Hallucinations should not be occurring whilst the corruption remains formless...)<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Communicator：</span><br>
BEEP BEEP!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Mikasa：</span><br>
Musashi, the enemy is multiplying. The situation does not look optimistic for us.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Tosa：</span><br>
My fleet has ceased attacking. We're working with fortifications and preparing for a defensive battle.<br>
In addition, those hallucinations Kii described earlier – my fleet is experiencing them, too.<br>
How long are you going to keep stalling, Musashi?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Musashi：</span><br>
...Another hour.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Communicator：</span><br>
BEEP BEEP!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Katsuragi：</span><br>
I have bad news to report, Musashi!<br>
Me and Zuihou's fleet were going to sortie together, but they never called me back despite my repeated attempts, so I sent out recon planes to investigate...<br>
Sure enough, I saw them locked in a battle with a META! She came out of nowhere!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Musashi：</span><br>
A META, you say?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Mikasa：</span><br>
Forward their coordinates to me. I will send in backup!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Katsuragi：</span><br>
Roger! Coordinates are on the way!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Tosa：</span><br>
Looks like you won't need to wait an hour after all.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Musashi：</span><br>
So it seems...<br>
<br>
After quickly summarizing what was happening, Musashi opened a comms channel with Akagi.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Musashi：</span><br>
As you can clearly see, the situation is getting out of control.<br>
This cannot be done, Akagi.<br>
It's time to stop.<br>
<span style="color:#ffc960;">{namecode:91}：</span><br>
Please, you must be kidding me.<br>
The Shadow of Corruption attacking and that META appearing only happened because the corrosion values are slightly higher than anticipated.<br>
The METAmorphosis is only temporary. We can use our barrier to purify and reverse it.<br>
Furthermore, the ritual circle is working. We are so close to completing the ritual. It's too late to stop now.<br>
Even if it wasn't, I wouldn't.<br>
All will be fine as long as Amagi's revival is a success.<br>
All you have to do is hold out until then.<br>
If you cannot hold out... then run away.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Communicator：</span><br>
BEEP BEEP!<br>
<br>
Akagi hung up the line. A look of deep sadness swept across Musashi's face.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Musashi：</span><br>
I should've known this would happen.<br>
Jintsuu, is our decisive weapon ready?<br>
<span style="color:#c3abff;">Jintsuu META：</span><br>
It can be used for a while, assuming that the core is reliable.<br>
Are you sure you want to do this?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Musashi：</span><br>
Akagi's flame burns so brightly only because I gave her my assistance.<br>
Therefore, it is my duty to bring the situation back under control.<br>
Perform final checks.<br>
<span style="color:#c3abff;">Jintsuu META：</span><br>
As you say...<br>
I wish you luck, Musashi.<br>

6 Obsession Rooted in the Past<br>
KABOOOM!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Mikasa：</span><br>
Zuihou, are you okay?!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Zuihou：</span><br>
Great Veteran! We're just fine over here. Please, go help Hiyou and Junyou!<br>
<span style="color:#ffc960;">Hiyou META：</span><br>
Kh... I'm losing my mind here. I wanna cut something!<br>
<span style="color:#ffc960;">Junyou META：</span><br>
The world is burning... Ahahaha! Yeah, let it all burn!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Mikasa：</span><br>
Hold on a second! Zuihou, Zuikaku!<br>
Are you saying those META ships are this branch's... OUR Hiyou and Junyou?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Zuihou：</span><br>
Mghh... Y-yeah... Basically–<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Zuikaku：</span><br>
When we got your orders, we immediately set sail to meet up with Katsuragi.<br>
But as soon as we left the coast, Hiyou and Junyou took a turn for the worse.<br>
They said they were hearing voices, and then they saw strange figures...<br>
When Zuihou tried to give them a checkup, this black fog suddenly surrounded them, and then... THAT happened.<br>
I saw the same thing happen to U-556 once when I accompanied Iron Blood on a mission...<br>
There must be something in the water here that corrodes shipgirls and turns them META!<br>
Great Veteran, we have to get them back to dry land!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Mikasa：</span><br>
Agreed there, but... Why are you here instead of with Nagato?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Zuikaku：</span><br>
Aaaah! Umm, Lady Mutsu is sick, so Lady Nagato ordered me to–<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Mikasa：</span><br>
I get it, I get it! Alright, I'll go inform everyone to retreat!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Zuikaku：</span><br>
Great Veteran... Thank you!<br>
I have one more report, too!<br>
The corrosion here isn't as strong as it was the first time I saw it. They aren't as far gone as U-556 was!<br>
If we can neutralize the two of them and purify the corrosion, then we should be able to bring them to their senses!<br>
The Royal Navy and Orthodoxy have both succeeded at this before. I know we can do it!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Mikasa：</span><br>
That's great. But if we want to neutralize them...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Zuihou：</span><br>
I have a great idea!<br>
Yamashiro gave me this paralyzing agent... Uhh, let's see...<br>
There! If we use this, we can temporarily suppress them! Then, we use the opportunity to rush in and go for the K.O.!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Zuikaku：</span><br>
Good stuff, Zuihou!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Mikasa：</span><br>
But who's going to purify them once they've been neutralized, and where?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Zuikaku：</span><br>
Well...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Communicator：</span><br>
BEEP BEEP!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Yamashiro：</span><br>
Hey, everyone! Sorry, I was eavesdropping a little!<br>
My mansion has a defensive barrier set up around it. We should be able to purify them there!<br>
Please! Just get them to me, and I'll handle the rest!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Mikasa：</span><br>
Yamashiro... Thanks!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Yamashiro：</span><br>
Don't mention it. I'm just doing what's right.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Mikasa：</span><br>
There you have it, everyone. Let's ground those two!<br>
<br>
Sometime later, at Yamashiro's mansion...<br>
The gang managed to drag Hiyou and Junyou to the mansion, where they quickly set upon the purification ritual.<br>
As Zuikaku theorized, their META corrosion hadn't advanced far enough to block their recovery.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Zuikaku：</span><br>
Hey, are you two okay? Still feeling bad?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Hiyou：</span><br>
Ugh... I feel like I just woke up from a nightmare.<br>
A nightmare full of someone else's memories and emotions...<br>
Forcing their way into my mind, trying to fuse until they've taken over me...<br>
That was just the worst!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Junyou：</span><br>
Yeah. It really was... I feel reborn now that I've been purified.<br>
I wouldn't wish that experience on any of you.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Zuihou：</span><br>
Oooh, I'm so happy you're okay!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Hiyou：</span><br>
But look to the sky. Things are only getting worse out there.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Junyou：</span><br>
A withered tree amidst blood-red clouds... It's like an upside-down world up above our own.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Zuihou：</span><br>
A distortion in space... Does this mean the Prime Barrier was corroded?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Hiyou：</span><br>
Probably. Where is Mikasa?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Zuikaku：</span><br>
She went to see Musashi as soon as we got back. I guess they're still talking.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Hiyou：</span><br>
Really? Well, I'm feeling great now! More people have evacuated back to land, so I'm gonna go help them!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Junyou：</span><br>
Me, too!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ryuujou：</span><br>
A warrior mustn't rest when people are in need! I shall join you!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Zuihou：</span><br>
Yamashiro already went, too! Let's go help her out!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">{namecode:89}：</span><br>
May we join you as well?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Zuikaku：</span><br>
Houshou and Jintsuu?! You're here, too?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Jintsuu：</span><br>
Musashi designated this as our gathering point. All of our mobile forces should gather here before long, and that includes us.<br>
But before we all leave to help the evacuees, I think I should explain things.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Zuikaku：</span><br>
Yeah. "Distortion" doesn't really tell the whole story... Jintsuu, you mind doing the honors?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Jintsuu：</span><br>
Gladly. Everyone, do you know what that distortion in the sky is?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Zuihou：</span><br>
Is it an illusion made by the contaminated Prime Barrier?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Jintsuu：</span><br>
No. That very tree IS the core of the barrier.<br>
The Shadow of Corruption may have appeared in the sea, but the Prime Barrier has yet to be corroded.<br>
However, the barrier's camouflage has been stripped away, revealing its true form.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Zuikaku：</span><br>
Its true form...?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Jintsuu：</span><br>
This is going to take us back... rather far in the past.<br>
When Akagi was still a battlecruiser, she and her sister Amagi...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Zuikaku：</span><br>
I-I had no idea all of that happened...<br>
If I'm understanding right... this Shadow of Corruption thing isn't an attack from the outside...<br>
It's the result of Akagi going mad?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">{namecode:89}：</span><br>
Perhaps so. At any rate, we discovered that the impurity stemming from Watatsumi exists even in the sacred tree where Amagi sleeps.<br>
The Great Sage Unzen, Lady Nagato, and Musashi have twice combated this corrosion...<br>
Zuihou, I believe you saw the second battle with your own two eyes.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Zuihou：</span><br>
Yeah... It was really scary. Nobody but Unzen could stand up to the corrosion...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Jintsuu：</span><br>
Back to the matter at hand... I believe Akagi's original intention was to use the Watatsumi's power to repair hulls.<br>
But, unfortunately, it seems that linking herself to the sacred tree has led to her ego being overwhelmed by the corroding impurity.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Zuikaku：</span><br>
Is Akagi that hell-bent on trying to bring her sister back? That she'd give up her own self?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Jintsuu：</span><br>
That's right. And the plan has already spiraled out of her control.<br>
The impurity in the ocean, the hallucinations, the corrosion that turns people META... It's all proof that Amagi has been corroded.<br>
Akagi must have known this would happen...<br>
But based on what she did, it seems to me that she fell to her own obsession.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Zuikaku：</span><br>
(Has Akagi really lost her mind?)<br>
(Putting the whole Sakura Empire in peril just to save something that might not even be her sister anymore... That's the furthest thing from sanity!)<br>
(Was what she did to Shoukaku at the holy site related to this, too?)<br>
(No. If that was true, why'd she give up on us so easily? Why did she participate in Musashi's game? And the reformation proposed by the Commander...)<br>
(Why didn't Kaga stop her?)<br>
(Akagi, you said you would lead the Sakura Empire...)<br>
(I thought better of her after what happened at the holy site... I thought she was worthy of respect.)<br>
(Hold your horses, Zuikaku. I know it pisses you off, but put yourself in her shoes for a second!)<br>
(If it was Shoukaku...)<br>
(If Shoukaku had been taken from us, and not Amagi...)<br>
(And if I led the Sakura Empire, and someone offered to help me get her back...)<br>
(I don't know what I'd do, but...)<br>
(If I was in Akagi's shoes, I wouldn't sacrifice the Sakura Empire... I wouldn't put my friends' lives on the line!)<br>
(Shoukaku wouldn't want that, either. Surely Amagi doesn't...)<br>
(Yeah! Amagi trusts her sister. She wouldn't want this to happen!)<br>
(We need to stop her before she does something that can't be taken back!)<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">{namecode:89}：</span><br>
I understand this is a lot to take in right now.<br>
We'll go ahead for now. Take your time and–<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Zuikaku：</span><br>
Houshou, do you know where Mikasa and Musashi are meeting right now?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">{namecode:89}：</span><br>
Yes. What are you planning?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Zuihou：</span><br>
Aargh! Zuikaku, are you going to eavesdrop AGAIN?!<br>

<br>
7 Planning Interference<br>
The meeting in the reception room approached its end.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Musashi：</span><br>
The barrier in the mansion is reaching critical levels, and META corrosion is only intensifying.<br>
I understand your feelings, Great Veteran, but we have no time left to prepare a backup plan.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Mikasa：</span><br>
Perhaps not, but...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Musashi：</span><br>
The Prime Barrier will prevent any entry as long as the ritual is in progress. We – no, our whole country – will be completely isolated.<br>
No external help can come unless we open a seam from the inside.<br>
Akagi's ritual circle has moved from the Prime Sakura to my sphere of influence in the Dragon Palace.<br>
Using the connection between the Watatsumi and the Yamato class, I can travel directly into the circle.<br>
Mikasa, I trust you to look after our comrades.<br>
Ideally, I will be able to stop Akagi's ritual myself...<br>
But, in the event that I fail, I will zap a hole in the barrier. That will be the time for you to execute your plan.<br>
For now, wait patiently and save your strength.<br>
No matter what happens to me, you have Lady Nagato, Shinano, and many other capable allies. The Sakura Empire's future will not be lost today.<br>
That will be all.<br>
<br>
Musashi unilaterally made her decision, stood up, and left.<br>
Meanwhile, outside...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Zuikaku：</span><br>
So Musashi was on Akagi's side, but I guess she isn't the one who caused this...<br>
And now she wants to stop Akagi's rampage all on her own?<br>
...Huh? Is someone leaving the room?<br>
Aw, crap!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Musashi：</span><br>
......<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Zuikaku：</span><br>
Umm... Hi, Musashi...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Musashi：</span><br>
You did well today. Keep up the good work.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Zuikaku：</span><br>
Of course! Thank you!<br>
<br>
After that, Musashi left without another word.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Zuikaku：</span><br>
Aah! My mind went blank when she came out... I forgot I needed to stop her!<br>
The impure power must be most potent in the ritual circle... I can't let her go into that alone!<br>
I know! I'll go tell everyone and think of a plan!<br>
<br>
Zuikaku ran out of the hallway and found Zuihou keeping watch over an area of the mansion.<br>
Upon hearing the scoop, even the bubbly bird began racking her brain.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Zuikaku：</span><br>
Anyway, we need to go to that Dragon Palace and stop Musashi...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Zuihou：</span><br>
Chirp... Akagi's circle is there, right?<br>
Oh! Shinano gave me a miniature model of the palace this one time! I hope it'll help somehow.<br>
Also, Musashi said that only the Yamato class can teleport there because they have a connection with Watatsumi, right?<br>
I heard Lady Nagato and Shimanto could do the same thing, though...<br>
Oh, I know! Just a while back, I asked Shimanto how to teleport in the sacred tree's domain, and she gave me this token!<br>
She said it's really precious, because it's made of a Watatsumi fragment... Maybe you could use this to do the same thing!<br>
Chirp! Good thing I took such good care of it. Now I can really help you out!<br>
Here you go, Zuikaku! Use this, and go catch her!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Zuikaku：</span><br>
Aww, thanks! Except... there's one problem.<br>
Just running in empty-handed sounds like a bad plan. I mean, that place is full of nasty stuff. There might even be enemies.<br>
I figure I need to be ready. Weapons, gear, talismans, that kind of stuff...<br>
Plus, that'll make it more likely that I win if I have to face Akagi in a fight!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Zuihou：</span><br>
Chirp! Leave that to me!<br>
Let's see... This one's from Unzen...<br>
I got this one from Ibuki...<br>
Mikasa gave me this one... This one was Lady Nagato... And Yamato, and Musashi...<br>
This one's from Akagi... One from Kaga, one from Tosa... Houshou...<br>
Hmm... Hrmm...<br>
<br>
One by one, Zuihou takes out various odds and ends and clutters the table with them.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Zuikaku：</span><br>
(I-is there anyone in the country who hasn't given her something?)<br>
(Zuihou is a force to be reckoned with!)<br>
<br>
"Truth. Falsehood."<br>
"That which resembles in form. That which is alike in spirit."<br>

8 Decisive Weapon<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Zuikaku：</span><br>
*cough cough*... My head is spinning...<br>
Is teleporting into the sacred tree's domain always this bad? *cough*...<br>
It looks like... this must be the circle at the core of the ritual.<br>
<br>
The sky was a dark red, and a sea of red spider lilies covered the earth.<br>
The mountain stream was as the Sanzu River, with faint, spectral blue flames dancing upon it.<br>
Palpable energy flowed through the air and into the great, withered tree.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Zuikaku：</span><br>
Eerie... I'd better go find Musashi, and fast!<br>
<br>
Zuikaku promptly sent out recon planes. Amidst the bed of lilies, she spotted Musashi.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Zuikaku：</span><br>
*pant*... *pant*... Musashi, let me come with you!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Musashi：</span><br>
...Zuikaku? I didn't think you would come here, nor so quickly.<br>
How did you do it?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Zuikaku：</span><br>
With this token made from a Watatsumi fragment! Zuihou says Shimanto gave it to her.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Musashi：</span><br>
I had no idea such a thing remained on the mainland...<br>
Seeing that faint golden aura about you, you must have what Yamato once gave her, as well.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Zuikaku：</span><br>
Golden aura...?<br>
<br>
Zuikaku finally realized that her whole body was emitting golden light.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Musashi：</span><br>
That token can only be used once. Now that you've used it to come here, you won't be going home so easily.<br>
I'm sure you're here to stay my hand, but I won't be leaving you alone for the sake of my return.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Zuikaku：</span><br>
Let's stop Akagi together!<br>
I don't know what danger awaits, but I know someone has to do something!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Musashi：</span><br>
...Very well. With you here, my chances of success have increased.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Zuikaku：</span><br>
What do we do now?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Musashi：</span><br>
There are two ways to stop the ritual.<br>
Either we defeat Akagi at the core of the circle...<br>
...Or we break its protective barrier and open it up to the outside world.<br>
That was the approach I was going to take – originally.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Zuikaku：</span><br>
Huh? You weren't going to stop Akagi?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Musashi：</span><br>
The ritual has gathered immense power. If we don't stop it, then her power will only grow as we approach the core.<br>
Forget defeating her – just approaching her will take enormous strength.<br>
While breaking the defensive barrier will not in itself prevent the ritual, it will open up a new course of action.<br>
The ritual barrier has fused with the Prime Barrier that protects the Sakura Empire.<br>
In breaking it, we will essentially create a route to the outside.<br>
That will allow us to join forces with our allies on the outside, but that's not all.<br>
It can also be used as an escape route if needs must.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Zuikaku：</span><br>
Then let me help you fight, Musashi!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Musashi：</span><br>
...No. You must go to Akagi.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Zuikaku：</span><br>
Huh? But didn't you just say she'd be stronger there? And it would be really hard just to get there?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Musashi：</span><br>
Only if she can bring all to bear against you.<br>
When I'm busy ripping holes into her barrier, she'll be forced to focus her attention on me.<br>
Use that opportunity to approach her.<br>
With what Yamato and the others have given you, the corrosion should be negligible for a time.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Zuikaku：</span><br>
Got it! I'll go stop Akagi, I swear!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Musashi：</span><br>
Heheh. That's the spirit.<br>
"With this strike, I clear thy path forward."<br>
<br>
Purple electricity surged from Musashi.<br>
It formed a helmet, arms, a torso – until it had become a giant, yet empty suit of armor, perhaps a hundred meters tall.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Zuikaku：</span><br>
What's that?!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Musashi：</span><br>
...Ahem. Consider this the trump card I've prepared for today.<br>
Now, Zuikaku, brace yourself.<br>
"Thunderhead on lake's reflection, by my heavenly blade, unleash thy lightning."<br>
"Cleave!"<br>
<br>
The suit of armor swung its sword toward the sky, cleaving the barrier like heaven and earth.<br>
Countless demons emerged from the horizon in response to Musashi's strike.<br>
The horde of monsters descended from sky and sea alike, a wave of sheer chaos.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Zuikaku：</span><br>
Uh, what are those?!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Musashi：</span><br>
...They're here to stop you from approaching Akagi.<br>
Allow me to strike once more and clear a path for you.<br>
"Thousand thunderbolts that pierce the stars, by my heavenly blade, purify the heavens."<br>
"Cleave!"<br>
<br>
Her slash cleaved the wave of demons in twain, cutting a path big enough for a shipgirl to proceed.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Musashi：</span><br>
*cough cough*... Urgh!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Zuikaku：</span><br>
Musashi? Are you okay?!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Musashi：</span><br>
Forget me! You must hurry to Akagi!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Zuikaku：</span><br>
...Okay! Good luck, Musashi!<br>
<br>
"Sanzu River, blooming spider lilies."<br>
"Draw in the eternal, and burn the heavens."<br>
"Sister... It's finally time..."<br>

9 Retreat<br>
Meanwhile, on the Sakura Empire mainland, black mist-borne hostiles began appearing on the streets.<br>
KABOOOM!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Kinu：</span><br>
Stay calm! Don't leave your post!<br>
We aren't suited to combat on land, but neither are they!<br>
All they have are sheer numbers. They're neither rational nor organized!<br>
They're just beasts, in the end. Fight calmly, and we can pick them off one by one!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Hatakaze：</span><br>
You're not wrong, but war is a numbers game. We won't last forever against an endless flood of them.<br>
And even if we can hold out, the same won't be true of Yamashiro's mansion and the barrier.<br>
You saw how Hiyou and Junyou turned into METAs.<br>
If the barrier is broken... we're in for a bad time.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Kinu：</span><br>
You're right in that we can't stay on the defensive forever... but if we're going to retreat, I'm not sure where–<br>
<br>
KABOOOM!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Kinu：</span><br>
Huh? Who's fighting over there?<br>
And what the hell is that golden light?<br>
<br>
Sometime later, at Yamashiro's mansion...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ibuki：</span><br>
Good day, everyone. I have come with Kitakaze and the Mutsuki-class shipgirls to support you.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Mikasa：</span><br>
Ibuki! Great timing.<br>
As you can see, the corrosive power is just getting stronger. Our barrier is on its last legs.<br>
Ibuki, can you and the Mutsuki-class girls do something about the barrier?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ibuki：</span><br>
Yes, and no...<br>
The corrosion strengthens as the ritual progresses. Continuing to protect this place is no long-term plan.<br>
Great Veteran, I propose a strategic withdrawal to Yakumoyama before it's too late.<br>
Yakumoyama's barrier was set up by Yamato herself. With Izumo's shrine, it may even be stronger than Heaven's Gate.<br>
The only road leading in or out is a single steep mountain path. Perfect for defense.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Mikasa：</span><br>
Yakumoyama, huh... I told Izumo I'd go there someday. But now isn't the time, especially under these circumstances...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ibuki：</span><br>
Great Veteran, we must keep up with the situation at hand. Overcome this crisis, and then we can think about the rest.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Mikasa：</span><br>
...You're right. Do we have a way to move outside the barrier without being corroded, though?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ibuki：</span><br>
No worries. I already made preparations for that.<br>
Mutsuki-class ships, form up!<br>
<br>
On Ibuki's signal, the Mutsuki-class shipgirls stood in formation with ritual items in hand, creating a circular area that would fend off the corrosion.<br>
The inside of the area glowed brightly. Countless golden butterflies flew around inside.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ibuki：</span><br>
"All of a world in this magic circle."<br>
Great Veteran, gather everyone in here! We're retreating to Yakumoyama!<br>

10 Scattering Thunder<br>
Deep in the barrier, at the Dragon Palace...<br>
Musashi collapsed onto the calm waters.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Musashi：</span><br>
Not so much as a sound.<br>
So easily neutralizing a wave of demons that blanketed the sea...<br>
Jintsuu wasn't exaggerating. And this trump card isn't even fully completed yet...<br>
But such a weapon is beyond any individual's control.<br>
It's fortunate that I was at the core this time.<br>
Shinano wouldn't... have...<br>
<br>
As her strength left her and her vision began to cloud, Musashi felt the passage of time slow.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Musashi：</span><br>
(Thinking that it would help her, I lent Akagi my strength and urged her to lead this empire.)<br>
(My respect for her human desires led me to foolishly try to grant them.)<br>
(But I was wholly unaware that madness had taken her.)<br>
(No... I will make no excuses.)<br>
(That this end would come was only natural. I have regrets, but I will not fear...)<br>
(All that lives must die. In this world, ships and humans alike are but fleeting phantasms.)<br>
Heehee...<br>
May this final blow bring the light of hope into this desolation...<br>
"Sever the pall of eternity, that I may become a leaf floating to the other side."<br>
"Steel... clash!"<br>
<br>
The fading armored behemoth unleashes one last blow.<br>
Its sword splits the red moon and sky alike, creating a great rift in the barrier protecting the ritual grounds.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Musashi：</span><br>
This... is all I can do now...<br>
Mikasa, Akagi, Nagato... I leave the rest to you...<br>
Oh, what a long day it's been...<br>
I'm exhausted... Just a moment's... rest...<br>
<br>
With eyes closed and a gentle smile, Musashi lay her head on the cold waters.<br>
In that moment, a kaleidoscope of brilliant golden butterflies lit up the world around her.<br>
And then, just as quickly as they'd come, the butterflies disappeared along with the sleeping warrior.<br>

11 Entrusted Will<br>
At Yakumoyama, the enemy's assault was ceaseless.<br>
KABOOOM!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ibuki：</span><br>
Izumo, everyone has reached the mountain. Close the barrier!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Izumo：</span><br>
I can't! It's impossible to seal it when it's under such a dense assault!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Mikasa：</span><br>
Then I'll go. Your job will be easier if I draw their attention, right?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Izumo：</span><br>
Great Veteran... Well, yes. A reduced density of attacks will let me seal the barrier in about 15 minutes.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Mikasa：</span><br>
Roger that!<br>
Kinu, Hatakaze, Matsukaze, Oite. Come with me!<br>
<br>
Mikasa's group charged down the mountain path, piercing through the horde of black mist entities like a spear.<br>
KABOOOM!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Matsukaze：</span><br>
What strange enemies... They look like they came right out of a youkai compendium!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Hatakaze：</span><br>
Foxes, rabbits, fish, ducks, even horned demons...<br>
Heh. At least there aren't any bugs.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Oite：</span><br>
Good. If there were bugs of such size... Urgh, just thinking about it makes me shudder!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Kinu：</span><br>
(They're all just making jokes. Am I the only serious person here?)<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Mikasa：</span><br>
This takes me back. How long has it been since the last time we all fought together?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Hatakaze：</span><br>
Getting emotional just shows your age, Mikasa.<br>
Besides, we fought together during Musashi's game, remember?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Mikasa：</span><br>
That doesn't count. Matsukaze and Oite weren't there.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Hatakaze：</span><br>
Ahaha... Fair enough.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Mikasa：</span><br>
(If this many enemies are attacking Yakumoyama...)<br>
(That must mean that Musashi's done her part.)<br>
<br>
Sometime later...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ibuki：</span><br>
Great Veteran, the sealing ritual is almost complete. Return at once!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Mikasa：</span><br>
Got it! I'll go stop Akagi, I swear!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Kinu：</span><br>
Gah... Finally over, huh? They may be weak, but fighting such sheer numbers is no easy feat!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Oite：</span><br>
The next wave is coming. Great Veteran, let's beat a hasty retreat.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Mikasa：</span><br>
You're all too injured to move at full speed. Go on ahead.<br>
I'll stay here and cover you.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Matsukaze：</span><br>
M-Mikasa, do you hear yourself right now?!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Mikasa：</span><br>
That's an order! Or do you want to see all of us sunk here and now?<br>
<br>
Mikasa cast a glance back at her injured friends, then returned her focus to the enemy.<br>
Then, with a fearless grin, she plunged into the dark torrent.<br>
Cannon fire and explosions flew through the battlefield, blowing away the black mist.<br>
Mikasa couldn't even count the wounds on her body and rigging by now.<br>
She continued to fight, driven only by her willpower and instincts, disrupting the enemy army as best she could.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Mikasa：</span><br>
(A desperate battle. The disparity between our forces and theirs is simply mad.)<br>
(The last time I felt like this... was my first time fighting Sirens.)<br>
(Guess the shoe's on the other foot now, after all the times I managed to get one over on them...)<br>
(I had so many opportunities to stop Akagi by force, and plenty of chances to persuade Musashi...)<br>
(But I didn't take action. Because I wanted to see things done my way.)<br>
(To be the veteran who supported the Sakura Empire's next generation of leaders from afar.)<br>
(My biggest regret of all was losing you, Amagi.)<br>
(I want to see you again, hear your strategize, and play games against you...)<br>
(I understand now. That's why I didn't stop Akagi...)<br>
(Hahaha... I guess this was the natural end of things, after all.)<br>
(Yakumoyama's barrier is sealed now. The Sakura Empire's combat forces have been preserved as much as anyone could hope for.)<br>
(Nagato... Sorry for being such a selfish role model.)<br>
(The rest... is all up to you.)<br>
<br>
Before her vision could be overwhelmed by darkness, Mikasa saw a group of butterflies that shone like the morning sun.<br>

12 Fallen Petals<br>
At the very center of the barrier, by the roots of the withering tree, the corroding ritual continued on.<br>
<span style="color:#ffc960;">{namecode:91}：</span><br>
Not enough... It's not enough...<br>
They still won't bloom...<br>
I need more nourishment for her soul.<br>
No, this ritual isn't over yet. I mustn't let it end.<br>
Even if things go completely out of hand...<br>
Dear sister... I know you'll be able to bring everything back under control.<br>
I couldn't lead the Sakura Empire myself, but I know you can!<br>
You were meant to lead the Empire. To lead me...<br>
When you're around, everything works out for the best.<br>
Even if everything burned down tomorrow... you'd make everything better. Isn't that right, dear sister?<br>
Of course it is! You can do ANYTHING!<br>
So I'll bring you back, no matter what it takes.<br>
I'm so close... So very close... I can practically feel you!<br>
But why? Why, why is the last step so...<br>
......<br>
Kaga... You know her just as well as I do. That's why we're the perfect exchange for the final fragment of her soul...<br>
You must understand. As soon as this is over, Amagi will come back to us.<br>
So...<br>
Just come with me, okay?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">{namecode:92}：</span><br>
...Okay.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Kaga(BB)：</span><br>
Let's go, Akagi.<br>
To the final stage of this ritual.<br>
<br>
In front of the great tree, Kaga took off her mask and smiled at Akagi.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Kaga(BB)：</span><br>
"From Naraka, down to the netherworld."<br>
<br>
A dead branch pierced Kaga's chest. Blood dripped from her mouth, painting it a vivid crimson.<br>
<span style="color:#ffc960;">Kaga(BB)：</span><br>
Urgh... I thought I was ready for this...<br>
But it really... hurts... *cough*...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Akagi：</span><br>
Kaga?!<br>
Why... Why do I have the ornament that Amagi gave you?<br>
You never let this out of your sight... Why is it on me now?!<br>
Why... Why did you protect me?!<br>
You're leaving me alone?! Didn't we promise we'd go together?!<br>
<span style="color:#ffc960;">Kaga(BB)：</span><br>
I'm... enough on my own...<br>
It's only natural... for me to return what your sister gave me...<br>
Consider it... her protecting you one more time...<br>
And now... I've done it...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Amagi：</span><br>
And please take care of my sister – Akagi...<br>
<span style="color:#ffc960;">Kaga(BB)：</span><br>
I fulfilled my promise... dear sister...<br>
Akagi... I can't protect you anymore.<br>
Only you can undo the karma you wrought...<br>
Someone important... that you've long forgotten...<br>
From now on... You'll be alone... in...<br>
<br>
Buds opened one after another, yielding blood-red blooms.<br>
With the ritual completed, the dead branches came back to life. And as Kaga disappeared into the tree's canopy...<br>
Crimson cherry blossoms came into full bloom.<br>

After the ritual ended, the gap between the material world and eternity was meant to be bridged.<br>
But the expected revival, the awaited reunion, had not come to pass.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Akagi：</span><br>
"When the cherry blossoms come into bloom, Amagi will emerge from the sea of flowers anew."<br>
Heh. Heheh... Ahahaha...<br>
Hahahahahaha!<br>
Nothing happened... Nothing at all.<br>
I thought I was ready for anything, but this? This I hadn't imagined...<br>
All I revived was this damn tree, instead of my sister?<br>
Oh, what horror... Heheh, hehahahah...<br>
<br>
She clenched her fist around the ornament that Kaga had left behind, so hard that her hand bled.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Akagi：</span><br>
Now I remember... Even back in the battle at AF, Amagi protected me...<br>
That's why mine is gone... and Kaga's is still here...<br>
Saved by my sister yet again...<br>
Losing the last thing that she left behind for me...<br>
Ahaha... Amagi's gone for good. I'll never see her again.<br>
Amagi's gone, Kaga's gone, they're all gone...<br>
Nobody will protect me anymore...<br>
Nobody...<br>
Ahaha... Ahahaha...<br>
Kaga... You were such a foolish girl.<br>
I was going insane. Why didn't you try to stop me?<br>
I wouldn't have even suspected you. If you wanted to stop me...<br>
It would've... It would've been so easy...<br>
Kaga... Oh, Kaga...<br>
Why did this have to happen?<br>
<br>
A wave of black mist monsters undulated on the horizon.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Akagi：</span><br>
...I get it. You have no more use for me, so you've come to take out the trash.<br>
Fine. If I can't see them again in this world...<br>
Kaga, Amagi... I'll come and see you on the other side.<br>
<br>
KABOOOM!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Akagi：</span><br>
What...? Carrier-based planes?!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Zuikaku：</span><br>
Akagi... Akagiii! Can you hear me?!<br>
The corrosion is all over the place! This ritual isn't going to go the way you want it to! Hurry and stop it!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Akagi：</span><br>
Zuikaku? But Musashi helped her escape. Why is she–<br>
<br>
KABOOOM!<br>
Zuikaku's planes weren't the only ones there. Even more closed in from the distance.<br>
When Akagi looked carefully at the angle they came from, it became clear that they were flooding in from the rift Musashi had created.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ryuuhou：</span><br>
Akagi! I brought a fleet to come and rescue you! Say something, Akagi!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Akagi：</span><br>
Ryuuhou?!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Communicator：</span><br>
BEEP BEEP!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Akagi：</span><br>
Ryuuhou! What have you come back for?!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ryuuhou：</span><br>
Oh, thank goodness you're safe!<br>
Lady Nagato is here. And reinforcements from abroad, too!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Akagi：</span><br>
Nagato? And others?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Zuikaku：</span><br>
Yeah! She came back with fleets from all over!<br>
It's not too late! If we destroy the ritual circle, we can still fix this!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Akagi：</span><br>
Fix? Hahaha... No, it's too late... What is there to fix now?<br>
All my planning, all my scheming, all my preparation... for what, exactly?<br>
I betrayed my country and my friends... What is there left for me?!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Zuikaku：</span><br>
"What's left"? Everything! Or what, are you going to give up on the living now, too?!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Nagato：</span><br>
Silence, both of you! You mustn't destroy the ritual circle!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Zuikaku：</span><br>
Lady Nagato?!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Nagato：</span><br>
Now that the ritual has been completed, the Singularity Naraka has already manifested.<br>
Destroying the circle now will just make it impossible to fix!<br>
Akagi, you are not wrong. Whether you were in your right mind or not, you have hurt the Sakura Empire, your friends, and most of all, yourself.<br>
You were overwhelmed by obsession, yes, but it was your love that left one final path for you.<br>
Take that path, and you may be able to do more than save Amagi.<br>
You might just be able to undo the damage you have done, and the sacrifices you have made.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Akagi：</span><br>
You mean... my... love?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Nagato：</span><br>
Of course. I speak no lies.<br>
And the one who revealed this possibility to us was none other than...<br>
{playername}.Our Commander.<br>
<br>
At the ritual's end, the Singularity Naraka appeared in the mortal world.<br>
Her dreams and desires were quashed by despair.<br>
But one hope shone on the bloodied horizon.<br>
Hope that effort may be rewarded.<br>
Hope that what was sown may finally be reaped.<br>
War, salvation, and atonement continue on in an endless cycle.<br>
And that distant sound continues to echo among the stars.<br>
To Be Continued<br>
