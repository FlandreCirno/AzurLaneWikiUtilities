Fight On, Royal Maids!<br>
<br>
Begin the Operation!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Queen Elizabeth：</span><br>
Do I make myself clear, Bel? I won't tolerate failure on this mission!<br>
We may have allowed the Eagle Union to hog the spotlight with their Christmas party, but the most effective way to prove that the Royal Navy is the mightiest faction here is through a show of force!<br>
At the upcoming joint exercises, make sure that everyone trembles before our might!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Belfast：</span><br>
In any case, that is what Her Majesty said...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Sirius：</span><br>
So I must cross swords with my honourable Master's fleet once more...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Gloucester：</span><br>
So that's why you called for all of us?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Curlew：</span><br>
I have no objections to facing off against Master's fleet, but... controlling the amount of force will take some finesse...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Curacoa：</span><br>
Well, we've already done this once before, so let's not take this too seriously~<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Gloucester：</span><br>
That may be the case, but as these are the Queen's orders, I can't afford to hold back.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Newcastle：</span><br>
Indeed. Regarding that matter, I've consulted with Belfast and made some adjustments to the personnel who will be handling this important mission.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Dido：</span><br>
I'm a bit concerned... I just arrived at the base, and I already have to fight against my Master's fleet...<br>
Will Dido also be cast aside like this child here...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Gloucester：</span><br>
Don't worry. Those are the actual orders that Her Majesty gave.<br>
*fidgets*<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Dido：</span><br>
In other words, I'll be supporting the Royal Maids and... fighting against my Master's fleet?<br>
Demonstrate the glory of the Royal Navy, help improve everyone's skills, and improve communication between members of the fleet...<br>
...and most importantly, prove to my Master that I can fulfill any request, no matter the situation...?<br>
Understood! For the sake of Her Majesty and my Master, I will give it my all!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Glasgow：</span><br>
What a monster...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Newcastle：</span><br>
She's the right person for the job. If Belfast or I were to handle this job, we'd end up subconsciously holding back against the Master.<br>
In contrast, Dido should be able to perfectly balance her obligations to the Queen, to the Maid Team, as well as to the Master, and therefore perform to her utmost.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Belfast：</span><br>
Indeed. I suppose we'll be taking a back seat this time.<br>
...The Master's fleet will be arriving soon. Everyone, prepare for battle.<br>

<br>
Fight On, Royal Maids!<br>
<br>
Secret Stratagem<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Dido：</span><br>
Let's take this from the top. As one would expect of my Master's fleet... launching such a fierce attack right away...!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Newcastle：</span><br>
Hehe, they really managed to catch us off guard last time. That's why Her Majesty decided to bolster our ranks.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Glasgow：</span><br>
Are we going to be all right? Our first defense line has already been broken...<br>
I hope they aren't thinking, "look how weak the Maid Team is..." Look, there are so many ships from various factions sailing under the same banner. Wouldn't it be better for us to go all out as well...?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Dido：</span><br>
I do believe you're overthinking things.<br>
From what I can tell, they're not attacking us with their full strength. If we were to counterattack with our full strength, my Master would respond in kind, and this would quickly devolve into a brawl.<br>
While that may be enough to "put on a show of strength," from the perspective of a training exercise, we should approach this situation as if it was an actual battle.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Newcastle：</span><br>
I see your point. In this current era of aircraft carriers, it would seem a bit anachronistic to engage in a decisive gun battle.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Glasgow：</span><br>
Ugh...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Dido：</span><br>
In any case, instead of playing all our cards right away, it would be best to gradually ramp up the challenge we pose to my Master's fleet...<br>
If I stick close to Master, I won't be thrown away... That way, I'll be able to stay with Master until the very end... Haah...<br>
Ah, Master, my beloved Master...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Glasgow：</span><br>
(Is she really going to be all right...)<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Newcastle：</span><br>
(She'll be just fine. After all, this is the best way to produce results that will satisfy both Master and Her Majesty.)<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Glasgow：</span><br>
(W-well... If you say so...)<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Newcastle：</span><br>
(Indeed, it'll be just fine. Despite her appearances, she's perfectly capable of thinking for herself.)<br>
Ahem. It doesn't make sense for us to tarry longer here. Let's move to the next defensive line.<br>

<br>
Fight On, Royal Maids!<br>
<br>
Sororal Defensive Line<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Curlew：</span><br>
Curacao, we're still hanging in there! Let's show them the power of the Royal...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Curacoa：</span><br>
All right, enough of that~♪ Dido and the others aren't fighting to the death, so why don't we conserve our strength?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Curlew：</span><br>
Speaking of Dido, she certainly has a striking way of fighting.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Curacoa：</span><br>
Indeed. At first, it seems like she's just brazenly charging forward, but she has a good grasp of when to back off.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Curlew：</span><br>
As a Royal maid, however, she still is a bit rough around the edges.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Belfast：</span><br>
I do apologize for suddenly pushing such an important role upon you.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Dido：</span><br>
Think nothing of it. Rather, I'm actually grateful, Miss Belfast.<br>
Despite the fact that I'm still a novice here, I am honoured that you gave me the opportunity to serve my Master and the fleet.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Belfast：</span><br>
Hehe, you show a lot of promise. I look forward to your performance as a member of the Royal Maids.<br>
And the same goes for your performance as a member of this fleet. After all, you are the nameship of the Dido-class, right?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Dido：</span><br>
Yes ma'am...!<br>
She's even... placed her trust in me...!<br>
...But still, I'm not...<br>

<br>
Fight On, Royal Maids!<br>
<br>
The Instructor's Tactics<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Gloucester：</span><br>
Kent, Suffolk, take advantage of your heavier armor to secure our supply routes.<br>
In addition, those who are equipped with anti-air equipment and radars should take care of the enemy's aircraft. Stick to the formations that Belfast instructed you on.<br>
Make sure to resupply now, as this will be our last opportunity. Double-check to make sure you won't run out of ammo.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Dido：</span><br>
The preparations for our final line of defense are complete.<br>
...So this is going to be the last battle...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Gloucester：</span><br>
Just fight with everything you have. We've already come this far, so don't regret anything.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Dido：</span><br>
That's right. Keep fighting... until Master and I are the only ones standing...<br>
And then Master will have no choice but to accept me...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Gloucester：</span><br>
Don't overdo it.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Dido：</span><br>
...But...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Gloucester：</span><br>
I'm not sure you'll listen to any of this, but I'm going to say it anyway.<br>
When you're standing in front of the Master, know that all the maids have been supporting you so that you could fight without reservations.<br>
You simply need to do your part, and give it your all. If you do that, Master will look upon you favorably.<br>
Even if you aren't able to produce the results that you want, neither Master, nor any of us, will cast you aside.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Dido：</span><br>
......Understood!<br>
They're coming. Master's fleet...<br>
Dido, nameship of the Dido-class light cruisers...<br>
Will fight with everything she has, for Master's sake!<br>

<br>
Fight On, Royal Maids!<br>
<br>
Her Reward<br>
The joint exercise with the Maid Team drew to a close.<br>
More important than winning or losing was the ability for the members of each fleet to work with each other and communicate properly.<br>
Or, as Her Majesty Queen Elizabeth said, for the Maid Team to "display the glory of the Royal Navy."<br>
Even though the exercise was not perfect, both sides achieved the results that they had hoped for.<br>
And now, we arrive at the present...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Dido：</span><br>
Master, I've finished passing out the results of the joint exercise. I've already archived the data within the intelligence room, as well as with the registries of the individual factions.<br>
<br>
While my secretary was gone, this maid somehow made herself comfortable sitting in my office.<br>
Thinking back about that training exercise, everyone did an outstanding job, but the way she fought all-out until she was the last one standing left a deep impression within me...<br>
For going above and beyond the line of duty, perhaps she deserves a little bonus...<br>
<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项1：Pat her on the head</span>'''''<br>

'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项1）</span>'''''Haah... Ahh... Um...<br>
<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项1）</span>'''''Dido quickly became flustered.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Dido：</span><br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项2）</span>'''''High... five...? Oh right, wasn't this some kind of Eagle Union exercise?<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项2）</span>'''''This lowly maid has no right to touch the Master's hand! At least...<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项2）</span>'''''Um, let this one...<br>
<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项2）</span>'''''Dido lifted the hand of a stuffed doll and pressed it against my hand.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Dido：</span><br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项3）</span>'''''Master...? Are you busy right now...?<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项3）</span>'''''Umm, is there something that I can do to help...?<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项3）</span>'''''...<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项3）</span>'''''...<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项3）</span>'''''...<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项3）</span>'''''...<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项3）</span>'''''Aww... I knew it... Master intended to cast me aside after all...<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项3）</span>'''''Waaah... Master! Please don't throw me away... Please let me stay by your side...! ！ ！ ！<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项3）</span>'''''I can't live without you, Master! I'll seriously die! Please! Master! Please! ！<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项3）</span>'''''Oh... you didn't notice I was here...? I'm so relieved, Master...<br>
<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项3）</span>'''''I calmed Dido down and consoled her.<br>
<br>
As such, we welcomed some new friends to the port...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Dido：</span><br>
Is there any work that I can help you with? Just ask, and I'll do it for you! I'll handle anything for you, no matter the request!<br>
That's because I... I'm your maid after all, Master!<br>
