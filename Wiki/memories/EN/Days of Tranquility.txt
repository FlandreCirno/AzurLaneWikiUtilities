Days of Tranquility<br>
<br>
1.Sound of the Waves<br>
A warm breeze – notably warmer than normal – greeted me when I stepped outside.<br>
It was a wonderful day. The sun was out, the skies were clear. I decided to make the most of it and go for a walk to the pier.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">U-47：</span><br>
…………<br>
<br>
Upon arriving there, I found U-47. She sat there, feet hanging off the pier and dipping into the water, just enjoying the solitude.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">U-47：</span><br>
…………？<br>
<br>
That's when she noticed I was there. She turned around to face me.<br>
"What are you doing out here all by yourself?"<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">U-47：</span><br>
Not much... Just listening to the waves.<br>
<br>
I sharpened my ears and listened in. The sound of the waves washing onto the shore gave me a sense of peace and quiet.<br>
For a moment, I forgot all about the stress of my job. I sat down next to U-47 and appreciated the calming sound.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">U-47：</span><br>
…………<br>
<br>
After a while of silently gazing out at the sea, U-47 turned and looked at me with a puzzled look.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">U-47：</span><br>
You're an odd one, Commander. But in a good way.<br>
You're the first person to hang out with me and keep quiet. Most people I know just make a racket.<br>
I've gotta go now, though. Submarine meeting thing around this hour. See you later.<br>
<br>
She bluntly announced her departure, then got up to leave.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">U-47：</span><br>
Just wondering...<br>
<br>
Right as she started walking, she suddenly stopped in place and began to pose me a question.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">U-47：</span><br>
Is it quiet in your office?<br>
<br>
"Quiet? It's pretty far from the dorms, so I suppose so...?"<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">U-47：</span><br>
I see... Good to know.<br>
<br>
She gave a concise response, then resumed her walking and left the pier.<br>
She seemed uninterested in me from start to finish, but I didn't get the impression that she disliked me.<br>
And then, it was just me. I stuck around for a while longer, simply taking in the sound of the waves.<br>

2.The Quiet Visitor<br>
I was doing work in the office, when suddenly someone came knocking on my door.<br>
I wasn't expecting a visitor at this hour, but I decided to let them in. I was surprised when I saw who it was.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">U-47：</span><br>
Huh. Interesting place you've got here.<br>
<br>
U-47 entered and had a look around. I asked if she had any business with me.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">U-47：</span><br>
Nope, I'm here just because. I can leave if you're in the middle of something right now.<br>
<br>
"It's fine, I'm not doing anything particularly important. You can stay as long as you want."<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">U-47：</span><br>
Oh, thanks. Then I'll just have a seat and read some books.<br>
…………<br>
<br>
It had been a while since U-47 and I said anything. I focused on my work and kind of forgot she was there, which I hoped she didn't take offense to.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">U-47：</span><br>
…………<br>
<br>
She was just sitting on the couch by the door, not making a single peep. Feeling curious, I walked over to check on her.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">U-47：</span><br>
Zzz... Zzzzz....<br>
<br>
An open book lied in her lap. Her snores were so quiet that I could only hear them up-close.<br>
I picked up the book and looked at the cover. It was on a complicated topic a bit above her comprehension level.<br>
It made sense to conclude she'd gotten drowzy while trying to digest it. I retrieved a blanket and tucked her in.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">U-47：</span><br>
...Nnh...<br>
<br>
For a moment, I thought I'd woken her up. Fortunately, that was just her turning her sleep a little.<br>
As I got back to work, I made a mental note to leave out a perhaps more accessible book.<br>

<br>
3.Milky Goodness<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">U-47：</span><br>
This is for you, Commander.<br>
<br>
U-47 came by the very next day after her first visit to my office. She brought with her a small carton of milk.<br>
The packaging sported a depiction of a brawny cow, an allusion to the widespread belief that milk promotes bone growth.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">U-47：</span><br>
A small thank-you for the blanket yesterday.<br>
<br>
"Ah, you're welcome. By the way, do you have a straw? There's none on the carton."<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">U-47：</span><br>
Oh, darn. Must've dropped it at some point... But it's still good, whichever way you drink it.<br>
<br>
She shrugged, then started scouring the bookshelf for something to read, like yesterday. Meanwhile, I got a glass and poured the milk into it.<br>
I took a sip, and immediately I could tell this was not your run-of-the-mill milk. Its taste was extraordinary. I commented on this to U-47.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">U-47：</span><br>
Mhm. It's my favorite. Imported, too. I wouldn't share it with just anyone.<br>
Also, got anything you need help with? I wanna make myself useful this time around.<br>
<br>
"There's nothing I desperately need your help with, but I appreciate the offer. For future reference though, what do you excel at?"<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">U-47：</span><br>
Stealthy stuff.<br>
<br>
"I see... I'll let you know if any missions like that crop up."<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">U-47：</span><br>
'Kay. Please do.<br>
<br>
She was content to leave it at that, and then pulled out a paperback from the bookshelf.<br>
I took a brief glance at the cover to see what she picked.<br>
It was titled, 'Catalogue of Navy-issue Postage Stamps.'<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">U-47：</span><br>
Pretty sure this wasn't here yesterday... Could be cool.<br>
<br>
Just like yesterday, she sat down on the couch and began reading in silence.<br>
I had put out the new book more or less at random, and was surprised to see she had taken an interest in it.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">U-47：</span><br>
I've said it before, but... you really are an odd one, Commander.<br>
I don't help around the office, but you still left this book here just for me. You're really quiet, too.<br>
Don't get me wrong, I don't want you to start running your mouth. I like peace and quiet, so I'm fine with that.<br>
<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项1："You don't need to exchange words to enjoy each other's company."</span>'''''<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">U-47：</span><br>
Mhm.<br>
<br>
She briefly echoed my sentiment, then focused her attention back to the book.<br>
Not much of note happened after that, and yet, a comfy mood enveloped the quiet office for the duration of her stay.<br>

<br>
4.The Loudmouthed Visitor<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">U-47：</span><br>
…………<br>
<br>
U-47 was now making regular visits to my office, which I didn't mind. I enjoyed her company, and she didn't interfere with my work at all.<br>
But, because she hung out with me so often, her fellow submarines weren't seeing her very much. This thought nagged me a little.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">U-47：</span><br>
Something wrong, Commander?<br>
<br>
I was staring idly at her. Sensing this, she turned around, and our gazes met. Just as I remembered I should start working, I heard a banging on the door.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">U-81：</span><br>
Commander! It's me! Open up!<br>
<br>
A voice yelled from beyond the door, breaking the peaceful silence up to that point.<br>
Startled by this abrupt noise, I got up and opened the door. U-81 immediately sprung inside.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">U-81：</span><br>
Hey, random question, but you seen U-47 around?<br>
<br>
I turned my gaze to the couch only to find U-47 was gone, even though she was there just a moment ago.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">U-81：</span><br>
Where the hell has she gone off to? I was sure I saw her headed here, so I came to investigate!<br>
<br>
U-81 sat down on the couch with a disgruntled expression. I watched her as I returned to my desk to sit down.<br>
That was when I spotted U-47, hiding underneath my desk. It caught me so off guard that I froze in place.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">U-47：</span><br>
Shhh. Let me hide here until she's left.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">U-81：</span><br>
What're you doing, Commander? Don't you have work to do?<br>
<br>
Trying to avoid making U-81 suspicious, I sat down in my chair and positioned my legs so they wouldn't bump into U-47.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">U-81：</span><br>
U-47's damn good at hiding, I'll give her that! TOO good, sometimes!<br>
But I'm the hide-and-seek champion! My title hinges on finding her, so I can't give up now!<br>
Ah, screw it! She's obviously not here, so I've gotta look elsewhere. Sorry for interrupting your work!<br>
<br>
U-81 apologized, then promptly darted out of the office.<br>
Then, U-47 emerged from under the desk after the coast was clear. She exhaled an exasperated sigh.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">U-47：</span><br>
Sorry about that. I'd hoped she wouldn't come by...<br>
<br>
"It's no big deal, so don't worry about it. But why were you hiding from her?"<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">U-47：</span><br>
Like I said, most people I know love to make a racket.<br>
That's not to say I don't like them, it's just... I'd rather bail when things get rowdy.<br>
<br>
She explained herself, then sat down on the couch and picked up her book where she left off.<br>
This reminded me it was high time for me to start working, so I went back to my desk.<br>
At the same time, I decided to plan for the possibility of U-81 making another sudden visit.<br>

5.Breaking the Silence<br>
U-47's days of peace and quiet had gone on for long, but that was about to change very suddenly.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">U-81：</span><br>
Would ya look at that! You were here all this time, eh, U-47? That means you're the seeker now. When are we playing the next round?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">U-557：</span><br>
This is such an obvious spot, and you still struggled to find her...? Maybe my bad luck is rubbing off on you...<br>
<br>
The office was unusually rackety, which was no surprise given that three submarines had gathered this day.<br>
It was almost a miracle how U-47 had managed to fly under their radar for so long.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">U-47：</span><br>
Yeah, I know, I'm the seeker. Could you pipe down? Commander's trying to work.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">U-81：</span><br>
All right, I'll be quiet!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">U-557：</span><br>
I'll just keep to myself... Lord knows what damage my bad luck could cause if I do anything else...<br>
<br>
The trio couldn't seem any more different, but U-47 did say she doesn't dislike them, so I assumed they were at least on friendly terms.<br>
Rather than order the other two to leave, I decided to just focus on my work instead.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">U-81：</span><br>
Oh right, I forgot to tell ya something!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">U-47：</span><br>
U-81, please... I told you to be quiet not even ten seconds ago.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">U-81：</span><br>
It's important, though! The three of us are gonna be a team for the next mock battle!<br>
<br>
I'd heard about this before during a meeting with the Iron Blood's leaders. There was to be a mock battle to improve their submarines' skills.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">U-81：</span><br>
It's only a few days away, so it'd be a good idea to get together and practice. Whaddya say?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">U-47：</span><br>
Sure, but on one condition...<br>
<br>
U-47 closed the book she was reading, then rose from the couch and walked over to the door.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">U-47：</span><br>
I'd like some time alone first, then we can practice. I'm kinda in a restless mood right now.<br>
<br>
U-47 left the office before the other two had time to answer.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">U-81：</span><br>
Question is whether she'll turn up or not... Always goes off on her own, that girl.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">U-557：</span><br>
Yeah, she's not much of a team player... My biggest concern is just making sure I don't mess up during the battle...<br>
<br>
The conversation between the remaining submarines made me think. It was likely they would run into teamwork problems with U-47.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">U-81：</span><br>
Any advice on what we should do, Commander?<br>
<br>
"Maybe. Let me see if I can devise a plan that'll let you all perform to the best of your abilities."<br>

6.Free Rein<br>
It was the day of the mock battle. The participants were gathering.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">U-81：</span><br>
Hey! There you are! You showed up after all!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">U-47：</span><br>
Ugh... Please, don't shout. It makes me a tad anxious.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">U-557：</span><br>
Everything all right...?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">U-47：</span><br>
Yeah, as long as you all keep it down. What about you?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">U-81 & U-557：</span><br>
…………？<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">U-47：</span><br>
I said I'd practice with you, but afterwards you told me I could do it by myself, so...<br>
I've just been worrying if I came off like a jerk when I walked out on you...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">U-81：</span><br>
Heheh, ya hear that? The commander was right!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">U-47：</span><br>
Right about what?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">U-557：</span><br>
That you... care about us more than you let on...<br>
<br>
Then, a siren rang out in the vicinity of the submarines. That was the signal that the mock battle had begun.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">U-81：</span><br>
Okay, so! U-47, you go on ahead and find targets to ambush!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">U-557：</span><br>
We'll keep an eye on the targets... and surround them from behind when they get close...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">U-81：</span><br>
You've got free rein as the lone wolf, and we'll do our best to support you!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">U-47：</span><br>
You're... giving me free rein?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">U-557：</span><br>
Yep, the commander came up with the idea... It's the optimal strategy, apparently...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">U-47：</span><br>
The commander came up with it...<br>
<br>
U-47 whispered to herself. She balled her hand into a fist and looked onward.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">U-47：</span><br>
Then it's bound to work. I'm sure of it.<br>
<br>
The mock battle concluded, and the trio's strategy was a resounding success.<br>
As they were receiving commendations for their performance, U-47 had but one person on her mind.<br>

7.Tacit Communication<br>
Office - The day after the mock battle<br>
U-47 came to my office and started reading, same as always. That was my sign to start working.<br>
I'd earlier received a report on her team's success during the mock battle. I wished I could've seen it in person, but unfortunately, my schedule didn't allow it.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">U-47：</span><br>
Hey, Commander...<br>
<br>
Out of nowhere, U-47 looked up from her book and spoke to me.<br>
Once she starts reading, she seldom ever pauses to say something. It must've been something important.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">U-47：</span><br>
U-81 and U-557 told me you came up with our winning strategy.<br>
<br>
I humbly scratched my head and half-smiled before she continued.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">U-47：</span><br>
And, well, I wanted to thank you for your smarts and consideration.<br>
We almost never talk despite how much we hang out... And yet, you seem to know everything about me.<br>
And I feel I know everything about you.<br>
...Including how talking to you now is making you feel tense.<br>
<br>
…………<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">U-47：</span><br>
I'll take that as a yes.<br>
You know, this really is a cozy, quiet place. It's become my special, most favorite place after coming here so much.<br>
So, given everything I just told you... you know what's on my mind right now, right?<br>
<br>
She threw me an earnest look, and a sudden question. I felt I knew the answer right away.<br>
"You like everything the way it is now, and..."<br>
<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项1："You want these happy days to continue."</span>'''''<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项2："You hope these days of peace and quiet to continue."</span>'''''<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">U-47：</span><br>
Mhm. Spot-on.<br>
And I want to spend them together with you.<br>
<br>
She then turned her attention back to the book.<br>
I took a moment to appreciate the quiet, soothing, cozy mood in the room before resuming my work.<br>
