Unknown Test Site<br>
Waters around the Sea of Wreckages<br>
Iron Blood Resistance - Salvage Fleet<br>
Under the light of the stars, a small fleet of three shipgirls was sailing forward cautiously.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Duisburg：</span><br>
We're nearing the Rising Tide now. Be on your guard.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Z52：</span><br>
Aw man, I'm seeing wreckages already!<br>
This Rising Tide is a Class V... I've never seen anything like this!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Z9：</span><br>
It is pretty amazing, but isn't it also the first Rising Tide we've seen this year?<br>
It could be the last, for all we know. I hope we'll get some valuable salvage...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Duisburg：</span><br>
That's what Rumey is counting on.<br>
Things will get even worse next year if we don't find anything good.<br>
Don't worry, though. A Class V yields way, way better salvage than anything else.<br>
Let's not think about the danger and instead look forward to the surprises we'll find.<br>
Hmm. Looks like a battle was fought here. Not that long ago, either.<br>
Did she get here before us?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Z9：</span><br>
Then it's no wonder why not even a single extradimensional showed up.<br>
*sigh*... She probably took lots of the valuable gear and components...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Z52：</span><br>
Going after Rising Tides is her only real choice, considering that she fights alone without any logistical support.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Duisburg：</span><br>
Don't lose hope. No matter what she may or may not have taken, a Class V is sure to yield enough to satisfy all of us.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Z9：</span><br>
*sniffle*... You're right. Sorry, I shouldn't just blurt out everything that comes to mind...<br>
We're not strong enough to stop her from doing whatever she wants... Not that we'd want to do that, anyway.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Duisburg：</span><br>
Exactly, so we should be praying that she found what she wanted, if anything.<br>
...Hm? Is there a person among the wrecks over there?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Z52：</span><br>
What? There's a human being inside a Rising Tide?!<br>
Oh my gosh, you're right!<br>
No sign of movement... Is that person even alive?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Z9：</span><br>
Ahh, umm... p-p-please be alive...?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Z52：</span><br>
Look! They moved! They're alive!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Duisburg：</span><br>
Looks like that's the Rising Tide's surprise for us. Let's go and help!<br>
<br>
After reviving Amagi inside the Naraka Singularity, the Commander and the shipgirls set about their home voyage.<br>
Although they made it back, it was not without incident.<br>
The Commander blacked out numerous times and met a mysterious woman named Madam M...<br>
The biggest incident of all, though, was the Commander's sudden and complete disappearance from reality at the celebration feast.<br>
In order to save the person most dear to them, the shipgirls immediately got to work to figure out this abnormal phenomenon.<br>
Meanwhile, the Commander also faced a choice that had to be made—<br>
Sometime later, inside the Rising Tide...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Duisburg：</span><br>
Hmm.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Z9：</span><br>
*sniffle*... Um...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Z52：</span><br>
Hey! You!<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
......<br>
<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项1：Uh, hello there.</span>'''''<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Z52：</span><br>
Woah! You can speak?!<br>
A language we understand, too! Awesome!<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
...?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Duisburg：</span><br>
Ahem. Sorry for skipping introductions, but I must ask you some questions.<br>
Where did you come from? And what are you doing inside a Rising Tide?<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Actually, I'm not sure myself. I just kind of woke up here.<br>
I'm not sure if this makes sense to you, but... everything's kind of a blur.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Duisburg：</span><br>
Hmm... Sounds like a case of memory loss.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
I still remember some things though... Just to make sure, have you ever heard of "test site alpha"?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Duisburg：</span><br>
Test site... alpha? Girls, does that ring any bells?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Z52：</span><br>
Nope.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Z9：</span><br>
Sorry, me neither.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Duisburg：</span><br>
Well, stranger, you showed up in a Rising Tide and now you're asking weird questions...<br>
Are you a visitor from the beyond?<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
"From the beyond"? Meaning?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Duisburg：</span><br>
A being from another world.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Come again?<br>
(From another world? Is she pulling my leg?)<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Duisburg：</span><br>
Some call your kind "outlanders", though that term isn't exactly accurate. In any case, we've had lots of visitors from other worlds since ancient times.<br>
They were friendly and contributed greatly to the development of our planet.<br>
Seeing one in the flesh, though – that's a rare privilege.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
(They're used to running into aliens... What a crazy branch I've wound up in.)<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Duisburg：</span><br>
Ah, you're having trouble taking this all in, aren't you?<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Aren't you? You're talking to someone from another world, in your own words.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Duisburg：</span><br>
Well, all we've heard are legends. The only beings from beyond we've seen so far though are extradimensional monsters.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Extradimensional monsters?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Duisburg：</span><br>
Oh, um, let's save that topic for later.<br>
<br>
She dodges my question with little subtlety.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Duisburg：</span><br>
I'm Duisburg. This ball of energy is Z52, and this shrinking violet is Z9.<br>
We're with the Iron Blood Duchy's Resistance Forces.<br>
<br>
She gives me a gentle smile.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
(So they're with the Iron Blood, huh... Wasn't a duchy from what I remember, though.)<br>
My name is {playername}. I'm from a world-branch known as test site alpha. If I remembered who or what I work for, I'd tell you.<br>
I am fairly certain... that I'm in the navy, and lead a fleet.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Z52：</span><br>
Wait, so you're, like... a naval commander?<br>
Hell yes! Rumey is gonna be thrilled to hear about this!<br>
Commander {playername}, mind coming with us?<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Should I? The last person told me to sit and wait for rescue.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Z9：</span><br>
Someone knew that we were coming?<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Yeah. I met Hipper before you girls came along.<br>
She said, and I quote, "Sit there all pretty and wait for rescue to arrive."<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Duisburg：</span><br>
Hipper? Admiral Hipper? You had a normal conversation with her?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Z52：</span><br>
Holy smokes... Outlander – or, Commander, I guess – you're incredible!<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Come again? Isn't she with you?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Duisburg：</span><br>
She... She doesn't exactly see us as allies, I think.<br>
More like passersby.<br>
<br>
While she speaks with a calm tone, her eyes betray an array of complicated feelings.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
(A resistance movement, a strange META, and even beings from beyond this dimension... This getting more and more confusing.)<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Duisburg：</span><br>
Z52, mind getting out your mass-produced ship? I'm taking the Commander back.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Z52：</span><br>
I could, but we'd be painting a target on our backs if we did that.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Duisburg：</span><br>
Fine, why don't you carry {playername} on your back, then?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Z52：</span><br>
Sounds fun! I'll do it.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Duisburg：</span><br>
Please don't ever do something stupid just because it "sounds fun".<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Z9：</span><br>
Exactly... What if you drop the Commander?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Z52：</span><br>
Good point... Are we leaving already, anyway? We still haven't salvaged anything.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Duisburg：</span><br>
No, obviously we're not.<br>
Also, I just had a word with headquarters. They issued a mission to bring back some heavy-duty gear, and at least a few.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Z52：</span><br>
Gotta make the most of this Rising Tide, then! We need to bring back a slew of treasures!<br>
<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项1：What did you say about a mission?</span>'''''<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Duisburg：</span><br>
Scout out the Rising Tide, find safe routes, and lay the groundwork for a large-scale salvage operation for the logistics team, I suppose.<br>
Bringing back valuable salvage wasn't part of our original plan, but if we're going to bust out a mass-produced ship, we can't come back empty-handed.<br>
Like Z52 just said, we have to return with a haul of treasure.<br>
In other words, our job now is to find the most valuable equipment for our base and salvage it.<br>
I know you want to leave right now, but don't worry, we'll be out of here soon.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Don't worry about me. Focus on finding your treasure.<br>
(Wreckages are considered treasure in this place... Interesting.)<br>

<br>
Riding aboard Z52's mass-produced ship, the three shipgirls embarked into the Rising Tide and began salvaging materials.<br>
By the time the eastward sky turned bright, they made way for home, storage loaded full of salvage.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Z9：</span><br>
Whew... We really managed to recover a lot.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Z52：</span><br>
Dang, this was a HUGE haul! Rumey is gonna jump for joy!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Duisburg：</span><br>
Yes, and there were even loads of good stuff among the things we couldn't salvage for now.<br>
I've marked it on the map so others can come and finish the job.<br>
<br>
After an evening of hard work, the girls have all gathered in the ship's break room.<br>
Duisburg takes out seven-or-so bottles and what looks like some bread and places them on the table.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Z52：</span><br>
Wow, that's a lot of food! We're really treating ourselves tonight, huh?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Duisburg：</span><br>
Of course. A smashing success of a mission deserves to be celebrated.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Z9：</span><br>
Y-yay!<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
(That's "a lot" of food?)<br>
(Is there food inside those bottles or something?)<br>
(I may be an amnesiac, but this isn't like any feast I remember...)<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Duisburg：</span><br>
No need to be shy, Commander. Come and eat with us.<br>
<br>
Duisburg grabs a piece of bread with one hand and a bottle with the other. She squeezes the bottle, wringing out the paste-like contents onto the bread.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Duisburg：</span><br>
It's schweinshaxe. Aren't you going to try it?<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
That's... That's what you call this?<br>
<br>
Even though the word does ring a bell, I'm still dumbstruck.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
(You could argue it smells like schweinshaxe, and the bottle serves as a substitute for a can...)<br>
(But the paste in question? Could you really call that "food"?)<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Z52：</span><br>
What's up? You look like you've never seen a squeeze tube before.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Duisburg：</span><br>
Heehee. I know what you're thinking – sorry, you won't find the real deal anywhere around here.<br>
Rest assured, it IS schweinshaxe, even if it doesn't look or chew like it.<br>
<br>
Duisburg puts down her bottle – or whatever it is – and takes a bite of her condimented bread.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Duisburg：</span><br>
Mmm, delicious! This is so good!<br>
<br>
Paying no heed to my state of disbelief, she spreads the schweinshaxe paste onto another piece of bread and presents it to me.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Well... Don't knock it till you've tried it, right?<br>
<br>
I accept the bread and bite into it.<br>
Initially, it just tastes like bread with a mystery spread, but it gradually takes on the taste and texture of meat.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Duisburg：</span><br>
What did I tell you? Pretty good, right?<br>
It's mass-produced synthetic food, but it does taste amazing.<br>
This bread isn't any ordinary bread, either.<br>
It changes taste according to the type of paste you put on it.<br>
Oh, also... I wouldn't recommend using more than one flavor of paste at a time.<br>
<br>
With a smile, she opens several of the bottle-tube-things in succession. Somehow, it actually starts to smell like there is a lavish feast on the table.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Duisburg：</span><br>
Got lots of questions, don't you? Let's hear them while we dig in.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
......<br>
<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项1：Tell me about the Resistance.</span>'''''<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项2：Tell me about the Rising Tide.</span>'''''<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项3：Tell me about Rumey.</span>'''''<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Duisburg：</span><br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项1）</span>'''''To do that, I need to provide a bit of backstory.<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项1）</span>'''''The Iron Blood Resistance is fighting an enemy that we call the extradimensionals.<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项1）</span>'''''Around 150 years ago, a meteorite crashed into our planet.<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项1）</span>'''''Hardly anyone noticed it at first, but then, hostile white creatures emerged from the sea.<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项1）</span>'''''They attacked so suddenly that they devastated every major faction in the world overnight.<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项1）</span>'''''Ever since then, the survivors have been doing their best to fight back.<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项1）</span>'''''The Dutchy we serve is among them, but it's only one of humanity's forces.<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项1）</span>'''''There are many people outside the resistance who also fight the good fight. And of course, there are still governmental bodies in existence.<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项1）</span>'''''Some of them are spread out deep inland, while others hide out on islands like we do.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项1）</span>'''''On islands? Isn't that much harder to defend against a seaborne enemy compared to staying inland?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Duisburg：</span><br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项1）</span>'''''It is. We shipgirls excel at fighting at sea, though, so yeah.<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项1）</span>'''''Also, our outposts aren't just some normal islands, they're former naval bases.<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项1）</span>'''''We also have giant weapons that can't be produced anymore, and installations that can handle both stealth and defense. Sort of like Mirror Seas.<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项1）</span>'''''It might be hard to imagine it all. You'll understand when we get there.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Duisburg：</span><br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项2）</span>'''''It's a phenomenon where wreckages rise out of the sea in large numbers.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项2）</span>'''''It occurs so frequently that you've given it a name?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Duisburg：</span><br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项2）</span>'''''Yeah. It happens when you have a war that's lasted as long as this one.<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项2）</span>'''''A lot of bases have been lost, seas captured, and forces defeated in that time. Most of the wreckages are pretty old, though.<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项2）</span>'''''As the extradimensionals' strength grew, they took over these starry seas and used them as their bases.<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项2）</span>'''''The waters changed with their occupation, leading to strange stuff happening.<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项2）</span>'''''Rising Tides is one of them.<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项2）</span>'''''They appear randomly across the world, bringing back heaps of old wreckages to the surface.<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项2）</span>'''''The things we salvaged earlier were made in the early stages of the war, judging by the advanced tech.<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项2）</span>'''''Thank goodness this Rising Tide came. It brought us a lot of good stuff.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项2）</span>'''''Wait, advanced tech? Are you saying that technology was more advanced then than it is now?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Duisburg：</span><br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项2）</span>'''''It's a world of difference. That's why we're extremely grateful when they happen – as long as it's not near a base.<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项2）</span>'''''Heck, the Tide even brought you to us!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Duisburg：</span><br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项3）</span>'''''Oh, yeah, we mentioned her a few times, didn't we?<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项3）</span>'''''Her full name is Fritz Rumey. She's the leader of our Resistance.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项3）</span>'''''She's a shipgirl like you, I assume?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Duisburg：</span><br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项3）</span>'''''You bet. The Resistance has to fight on the very front, and no ordinary human being could shoulder the heavy burden of her position.<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项3）</span>'''''In fact, most factions in the war have a shipgirl for a leader.<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项3）</span>'''''Rumey in particular is–<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Z52：</span><br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项3）</span>'''''A badass! And super strong!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Duisburg：</span><br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项3）</span>'''''That about sums it up. We've already told her about you, so you'll meet her soon enough.<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项3）</span>'''''What an honor!<br>
<br>
The relaxed mood carried on while the warship sailed forward without incident.<br>
On the way, I saw a handful of desolate islands emitting a strange glow dotting the landscape.<br>
Duisburg told me those islands used to be strongholds belonging to the Resistance.<br>
However, they were attacked with radioactive weapons and the soil was permanently contaminated.<br>
Shipgirls don't last long in irradiated environments, to say nothing of humans.<br>
They did have de-radiation equipment, but wear and tear finally broke the last serviceable one 20 years ago. As such, the island had to be abandoned.<br>
Following that, they became no-go zones, effectively treated the same as bases belonging to the extradimensionals.<br>
Hours have passed onboard. The evening sun shines, and the air in front of the warship seems to bend.<br>
Then, without any warning, a number of cross-shaped objects appear in the air.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Z52：</span><br>
Commander! We've entered our Mirror Sea!<br>
Those things there – they're our outer periphery defenses! Pretty cool, huh?<br>
<br>
The mechanical giants hang in the light of the setting sun, making not as much as a peep.<br>
Their appearances do not jog anything in my memory, and I cannot even imagine what functions they possess.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Duisburg：</span><br>
They're what we call the Eternal Stars.<br>
They, along with the Mirror Sea, are relics that have been here for over a hundred years. It's a mystery how they still work.<br>
Not only are they mind-blowingly sturdy, they also possess exceptional camouflage.<br>
It's for those reasons that Rumey picked this location for our base.<br>
Word of advice, though – don't get too close to them.<br>
They're simply following ancient programs. All we can do is provide upkeep.<br>
Anyone who comes too close without maintenance permissions is regarded as a hostile, so...<br>
Anyway, see that building over there?<br>
<br>
Off in the distance, a massive island rests in the water.<br>
Though not as jaw-dropping as the Eternal Stars, the building that sits at the island's center still commands awe.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Duisburg：</span><br>
That's the Resistance's headquarters.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Z52：</span><br>
Ahh... Finally, a landmark! Home sweet home!<br>

<br>
The next day...<br>
It was late by the time I arrived at the base, so I was promptly escorted to the guest room.<br>
Now it's the next day, and I'm going to meet Fritz Rumey at lunchtime today. Before that, though, I got a call from Duisburg on my communicator.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Duisburg：</span><br>
Good morning, Commander. It's Duisburg.<br>
We've made a few discoveries that I thought you should know about. Our engineers found some rather valuable components among the things we salvaged yesterday.<br>
These will let us finally accomplish our goal of fixing our radiation purgers.<br>
They also managed to decrypt plans for improving the device from the data core of a science vessel.<br>
I heard those are really going to come in handy.<br>
Rumey has always had plans to reclaim the surrounding island bases if we managed to repair the purgers.<br>
Thanks to all these discoveries, we'll be able to put our big plan into action at once.<br>
The plan will be publically announced today at noon. We'd love it if you came to listen.<br>
Once the announcement is done, I'll bring you to Rumey's office. Then you can talk secrets with her.<br>
<br>
Later, at noon...<br>
Shipgirls gather at the base's square and hoist their banners.<br>
Atop the high ground, a woman clad in the naval attire of Iron Blood makes her gallant appearance.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Fritz Rumey：</span><br>
My compatriots!<br>
I presume you've all heard that a Class V Rising Tide has appeared.<br>
Yesterday, our scouting party returned from it with spoils in tow.<br>
With the equipment they recovered, we will finally be able to restore our three radiation purgers to working order!<br>
At last, we will be able to reclaim the surrounding bases that were lost!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Crowd：</span><br>
YEAHHH!<br>
<br>
The silent crowd erupts into cheers, like a long-dormant volcano.<br>
However, Rumey raises her hand to quell their jubilation.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Fritz Rumey：</span><br>
It is not yet time to celebrate.<br>
The data core we recovered contains upgrade plans for the radiation purgers as well as blueprints for mass-producing them.<br>
This means we will be able to reclaim not just our islands, but also restricted areas on the mainland!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Crowd：</span><br>
YEAHHH!<br>
<br>
The crowd cheers even louder than the last time.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Fritz Rumey：</span><br>
Therefore, in three days, I will launch our first operation to reclaim our lost territory!<br>
The first to be reclaimed shall be area IB-AX-104, the Silberstern – the Silver Star.<br>
Our goal is to seize the island, restore the base's functionality, and establish a logistics line between it and our headquarters.<br>
We must reclaim this island to secure vital materials needed for the upgrade of the radiation purgers.<br>
Furthermore, it will serve as the springboard for future recapture operations...<br>
<br>
Rumey's announcement continues.<br>
Her briefing on the salvage mission turns first into a series of operation announcements, then into specific orders for her troops.<br>
These rapid-fire proclamations had me confused at first, but it makes sense now that I think about it.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
(This IS their forward operating base, so I assume everyone here is involved somehow.)<br>
<br>
Once the announcements wrap up, Duisburg escorts me to Rumey's office.<br>
The leader of this place just finished her speech, and now I will speak to her face-to-face.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Fritz Rumey：</span><br>
You must be the outlander – {playername} – or should I say "Commander"?<br>
I've been told about you. Did your memories return to you following a night's sleep?<br>
<br>
I shake my head in response. Without any change in expression, she cuts to the chase.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Fritz Rumey：</span><br>
I'll get straight to the point. Won't you consider joining us?<br>
As you've seen around the base, we need every pair of hands we can get.<br>
You would be of extraordinarily great help to us, especially considering your ties to other outlanders – the Sirens.<br>
Unfortunately, I cannot promise much in the way of tangible resources in exchange for the knowledge and intelligence you possess...<br>
However, if you work with us, I promise that you will be treated as an ally of the Resistance.<br>
No, more than just that – you are an excellent leader, I've heard.<br>
I will also give you our highest degree of trust and the space to fully display your tactical ingenuity.<br>
Naturally, if you wish to join another one of humanity's force, I will not stop you.<br>
Still, in a personal and official capacity, I sincerely hope you will choose to stay with us.<br>
Please, Commander.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
(A frank but succinct request. It's hard to say no when she's pleading so earnestly...)<br>
(You sure know how to persuade, Rumey.)<br>

<br>
Following the conclusion of my meeting with Fritz Rumey, I formally became a member of the Resistance.<br>
Not that I had much of a choice though, given that I'm stranded in this world.<br>
On the bright side, they did have knowledge pertaining to my situation that they could share.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Fritz Rumey：</span><br>
The records I've read say that cases like yours – an outlander suddenly vanishing into thin air – have happened numerous times before.<br>
A popular theory from the time is that the outlanders returned to the worlds whence they came.<br>
Since that is the case, I think you needn't worry about returning home for now.<br>
As for what comes next, we'll take it one step at a time.<br>
<br>
We also discussed the threat that this world faces, that being the so-called extradimensionals.<br>
The way they were described reminded me of X.<br>
Their surface-level looks are different, however. To find out more, I'll just have to fight them and see for myself.<br>
I also brought up the Antiochus, and the response was interesting.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Fritz Rumey：</span><br>
..."Antiochus"? I've never heard that word before. An unexpected alias for the Sirens, to be sure.<br>
If you want information on them, I can provide that.<br>
For, when you trace things back to their origin, they are inextricably linked with the development of our world as well as my very birth.<br>
<br>
Rumey told me that the Sirens appeared out of nowhere in this world roughly 200 years ago.<br>
In stark contrast to the extradimensionals, they came in peace.<br>
It was thanks to these friendly aliens that the world's technological development accelerated exponentially.<br>
As time went on, however, even the Sirens weren't spared from the hostility among the factions of the world. They were divided as well, sometimes even getting pulled into small-scale conflicts.<br>
Even so, humanity believed that this golden age of rapid development for civilization would continue forever.<br>
And so it did – at least until the extradimensionals struck.<br>
As soon as their existence came to light, the whole world united under the banner of the Sirens and fought countless battles, until the Sirens' ultimate defeat.<br>
Yet despite their victory, the extradimensionals strangely went no further. Their advance halted, and their power even seemed to subside.<br>
That is how humankind's resistance organizations have managed to survive up to this day...<br>
*knock knock*<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Z11：</span><br>
Mandy! You there?<br>
<br>
Z11 – another member of the Resistance – knocks on my door.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
What's up?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Z11：</span><br>
You haven't had dinner yet, have you?<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Nope.<br>
<br>
Nobody eats dinner at four in the afternoon.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Z11：</span><br>
Good! Perfect! See, Duisburg is throwing a welcome party and you're invited!<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Welcome party for who?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Z11：</span><br>
For you, duh! You're the guest of honor, so you can't, like, NOT attend. The girls would be literally heartbroken!<br>
So, you coming or not?<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Of course I'll come. Lead the way!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Z11：</span><br>
Huh? Wait, uh, umm... Don't you, like... know where our hideout is?<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Why would I?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Z11：</span><br>
Right, of course... I guess I just have to, uhh, escort you...<br>
Gotta make this as quick as possible...<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
...?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Z11：</span><br>
*huff puff*... *huff puff*... Okay, I'm all good! Let's get going!<br>
<br>
Something fierce inside her suddenly breaks out, and she drags me out of the break room at breakneck speed.<br>
Sometime later...<br>
On a beach you could hardly call pretty, Duisburg and her friends stand silently while watching the sunset.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Z52：</span><br>
Oh, there's the Commander! And Z11! You finally showed!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Z11：</span><br>
*pant*... *pant*... My work here is done... Can I go home now?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Z52：</span><br>
C'mon, are you serious? You're already here, so what reason do you have NOT to stick around for the party?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Z11：</span><br>
Aha... Ahahaha... You're doing the thing again, aren't you?<br>
Z9, are you attending?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Z9：</span><br>
I mean, it's for the Commander, so... *sniffle*...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Z11：</span><br>
Ooof course... Fine, I'll stay!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Z52：</span><br>
Sweet!<br>
<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项1：So where's the party?</span>'''''<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项2："The thing"? What thing?</span>'''''<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Duisburg：</span><br>
Heehee. Your face just screams completely obvious. Let me explain.<br>
Look over there. What do you see?<br>
<br>
Duisburg points toward a fairly large island sitting in the periphery of the headquarters.<br>
The two are connected by a bridge, and on that island stands a great structure that rivals the headquarters building in size.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Duisburg：</span><br>
That's our energy tower. It's our lifeline that powers not just the whole base, but also the Mirror Sea and even the Eternal Stars.<br>
They say it's home to many secrets that still haven't been uncovered after many years, so it's just been left sitting there.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Is that where your hideout is?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Duisburg：</span><br>
What? No. It's got something to do with what we're about to do, though.<br>
I'll let you in on a secret – there's a fish farm inside the tower.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Seriously?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Duisburg：</span><br>
Yeah. Since you're not keen on tube food, I was planning to politely borrow some fish to grill.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
By "politely borrow," you mean steal?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Duisburg：</span><br>
It's called taking with appreciation!<br>
<br>
She smiles a gentle smile.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Alright. How are you going to return the fish?<br>
(Unless she plans on having us regurgitate them like birds...)<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Duisburg：</span><br>
It doesn't matter as long as the population doesn't shrink.<br>
<br>
She maintains her unwavering smile.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Z52：</span><br>
They'll spawn more, sooner or later!<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
......<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Z52：</span><br>
So, you wanna come with and borrow some?<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Well, it sounds fun, and I could use some work experience in this world.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Z52：</span><br>
Thought as much. Time to set off!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Z11：</span><br>
H-here we go!<br>
<br>
Sometime later...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Z9：</span><br>
Whew... Good job, everyone. Have some coffee!<br>
The fish will be done in just a minute.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Duisburg：</span><br>
Your clothes should be dry now, too, Commander. Those were some lively fish, huh?<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
(Operation Polite Catch was a success... and fun.)<br>
(When was the last time I had this much fun?)<br>
(Dammit... I really can't remember because of this cursed amnesia.)<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Z52：</span><br>
Aaahhh! I messed up! Help, help!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Z11：</span><br>
Eek! Wh-what happened?!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Z52：</span><br>
I threw some gasoline on there 'cause the fire was looking weak, and, well... our food is getting burned!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Duisburg：</span><br>
Oh, for crying out loud... I SAID not to do it yourself.<br>
One moment, Commander. I'll deal with this!<br>
<br>
And so, me and the members of the Resistance had a fun night together.<br>
{{折叠面板|内容结束}}

{{折叠面板|标题=That Sinking Feeling|选项=5|主框=1|样式=primary|展开=是}}
<br>
Three days passed in the blink of an eye. The time to fight has finally come.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Duisburg：</span><br>
Commander {playername}, Rumey has directed me to relinquish command of this fleet to you.<br>
But given the fact that this is your first mission, may I serve as your second-in-command?<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
I'd be happy to have you.<br>
<br>
Duisburg knows a million times more than I do about these seas and so-called extradimensionals.<br>
I wouldn't dream of turning down an offer like that.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Duisburg：</span><br>
Heheh. I'll make you proud.<br>
Z52's recon fleet is en route from IB-AX-108 to 110, and Rumey has already set sail with her main fleet.<br>
The amphibious and escort fleets are still on standby.<br>
As for our own hunting fleet, our job is to secure the supply route at IB-AX-104, eliminate every enemy in sight, and collect samples from them.<br>
But to think that we would need a sample from an extradimensional, of all things, to fix our radiation purgers...<br>
IB-AX-104 is vast, but it's long been seen as relatively safe.<br>
Recon shows nothing out of the ordinary as of eight hours ago, as well.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Well, isn't that convenient...<br>
(If it really is safe, then dispersing our fleets makes for a more efficient search, yes. But something is fishy here...)<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Duisburg：</span><br>
Anyway, we'd best get going.<br>
<br>
<br>
KABOOOM!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Extradimensional Horde：</span><br>
ROOOOOAR!<br>
<br>
As time passed, the horde only grew in number.<br>
Things had turned from hopeful to hopeless in practically minutes.<br>
We did everything in our power, but we lost contact with ship after ship.<br>
Even retreat seemed an unlikely luxury at this point.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Duisburg：</span><br>
No... Why did it have to be today of all days?<br>
Why...<br>
<br>
A mission that we'd expected to be an easy success had ended in tragedy.<br>
Duisburg's voice trembles from pain, sadness, and regret.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Duisburg：</span><br>
Commander... We're done for, aren't we?<br>
I'm sorry for getting you involved in this. I...<br>
<br>
KABOOOM!<br>
Deathly silence fills the air.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
......<br>
Am I... dying?<br>
Right here? This easily?<br>
I haven't accomplished anything. I haven't even been able to get my memories back.<br>
But this is how it ends...<br>
<br>
KABOOOM!<br>
Amidst the explosion of the mass-produced ship, my consciousness is thrown into the empty abyss.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Strange Sound：</span><br>
SHUFFLE...<br>
<br>
Then, I hear the sound of cards shuffling.<br>
<br>
<br>
After a smooth journey to IB-AX-103, we ran into them – the extradimensionals.<br>
KABOOOM!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Extradimensional Horde：</span><br>
ROOOOOAR!<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
That's one heck of a horde! Is this what you call safe?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Duisburg：</span><br>
Not at all. This is the most we've seen in years!<br>
But why today?<br>
Commander, I urge a swift retreat! We can't fight off those numbers!<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Agreed. Give the order to all ships to cover each other's immediate retreat. Contact our allied fleets and headquarters as well – Rumey needs to stop the mission at once.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Duisburg：</span><br>
Roger that!<br>

Time: Unknown<br>
Location: Unknown<br>
In a giant ship, one blue-haired girl gazed upon the galaxy before her.<br>
<span style="color:#ffc960;">Helena META：</span><br>
Naraka and the NA Ocean Singularity are connected, and the Commander did enter the Singularity.<br>
But something is tampering with the exit.<br>
Memphis is off in another test site, and the Commander is missing...<br>
No... It's as if test site beta has become an illusion altogether.<br>
I can't find it anywhere. Where has the real test site beta gone?<br>
<br>
Helena's cold eyes showed a hint of pain.<br>
<span style="color:#ffc960;">Helena META：</span><br>
Passive radar and regular scans show no abnormalities. Our defenses haven't come up with any notifications, either.<br>
If not for the Tower's resources being diverted to active scanning, I never would've seen through the test site's camouflage.<br>
Something transferred the real beta elsewhere.<br>
The ability to not just change its coordinates, but to make a branch-sized illusion and even jam the Tower's observational capabilities...<br>
There's no doubt about it.<br>
The Empress and the Magician...<br>
So they've teamed up.<br>
<br>
The glint in her eyes turned even colder.<br>
<span style="color:#ffc960;">Helena META：</span><br>
Soulless beings lurking in the dark, coveting the Commander...<br>
Add another grudge to this long-simmering hatred... Very well. Let's have at it, then.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Communicator：</span><br>
BEEP BEEP!<br>

<br>
Sardegna Empire<br>
Former World Expo Venue<br>
Sakura Empire Pavilion<br>
After the Commander's disappearance, Akagi led the fleet who'd escaped from Naraka to Sardegna, hoping to get Amagi some necessary recuperation.<br>
The Sakura Empire pavilion at the World Expo was left intact, owing to its popularity during the event.<br>
However, much like the other pavilions of the World Expo, Shinano's new quarters were more than meets the eye.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Akagi：</span><br>
Barriers everywhere...<br>
Amazing that even the flowers in the garden are being cared for by the barriers.<br>
I couldn't have imagined that such a simple pavilion would be so complex.<br>
Perfectly defended, as well...<br>
And would you look at that? It isn't just the building – there are layers going all the way from earth to sky.<br>
Shinano, are we sure this is a Sakuran mansion and not some kind of Eagle Union doomsday bunker?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Shinano ：</span><br>
This one only oversaw construction, not design...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Akagi：</span><br>
Oh, I suppose you're right.<br>
Now that we're inside, have you received any more word from Yamato?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Shinano ：</span><br>
Wait, please...<br>
She says the defenses are but a precautionary measure. Do not mind them...<br>
They prevent interference of the mind, as well, so we may prepare without worry.<br>
She intends to perform the Rite of Return in two days...<br>
Eliminating the corrosion in Naraka, undoing the disturbance of the world's concepts, reviving those who fell in battle...<br>
In the process, possibly even removing the mental interference being done to the Commander.<br>
But before the rite, we must find the rupture in the world that was created by the Commander's disappearance...<br>
By repairing it with the correct memories and concepts, those which only we have...<br>
We can greatly bolster our chance of success.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Amagi(CV)：</span><br>
Treating our Sakuran allies and rescuing the Commander. Two birds with one stone, indeed.<br>
However, if the Rite of Return is in only two days, then that puts a lot of pressure on us to find and repair that rupture.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Memphis：</span><br>
Leave that to Helena and me. Information processing is what we do.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Helena：</span><br>
That's right. I'd do that and more for the Commander's sake!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Amagi(CV)：</span><br>
Of course. We all harbor the same love for the Commander, yes, but our skills are quite different.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Memphis：</span><br>
I-I guess...?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Zuikaku：</span><br>
Ryuuhou and I will help, too!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ryuuhou：</span><br>
Gladly!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Amagi(CV)：</span><br>
Heehee. Let us all endeavor for those we love.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Shinano ：</span><br>
Ah... She also says that it may help if we have any objects that connect us to the Commander.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Memphis：</span><br>
Objects that connect us... Oh!<br>
The brooch from Clemenceau... No, better yet! The handkerchief I gave the Commander!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Shinano ：</span><br>
A handkerchief... Perfect! Our chances of success rise ever more...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Akagi：</span><br>
What a lucky little coincidence.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Shinano ：</span><br>
Also... Yamato says that, since Kaga's soul is secure, she must be returned to normal soon...<br>
The mind will remain hers, but incorporated with memories beyond the limited scope of the sample...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Kaga(BB)：</span><br>
As long as I'm still me, I don't mind.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Shinano ：</span><br>
Then we must begin preparing the rite per Yamato's instructions...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Akagi：</span><br>
I must agree with my sister. Let's do our best to bring our Commander back.<br>

{{折叠面板|标题=An Old Friend?|选项=8|主框=1|样式=primary|展开=是}}
<br>
The light recedes, and I find myself inside a bright classroom.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
*pant*... *pant*... *pant*...<br>
<br>
The chill from my brush with death still lingers around me. The warm sunlight is enough to make me dizzy.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
What happened?<br>
Did I dream up all of that? Or is this the dream?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Madam M：</span><br>
Heehee. Death is not at all a pleasant experience. Take your time getting used to it.<br>
<br>
A purple-haired woman walks forward from the teacher's podium, smiling as she does.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
I remember you. You and this classroom.<br>
I've been here before... haven't I, Madam M?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Madam M：</span><br>
Sounds like some of your memories are back.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Can't remember much more than that, though. Are you responsible for my amnesia?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Madam M：</span><br>
...They say that seeing an old friend's face can help an amnesiac recover some of their memories.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Are you saying you're the old friend here? You don't feel like it to me.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Madam M：</span><br>
I don't? What a shame.<br>
<br>
So she says, yet there isn't the faintest trace of disappointment in her expression.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Madam M：</span><br>
Anyway, let's move on to discussing your current problem.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Yes, let's. What in the world is going on?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Madam M：</span><br>
Do you remember the two things I guaranteed you? The right to search, and the opportunity to choose.<br>
Are you ready to make your choice?<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
There you go, talking nonsense again. How does that have anything to do with figuring out who I am?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Madam M：</span><br>
It depends on what you manage to take from your search.<br>
Take the Sirens, for instance. What are your thoughts about them?<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
The Sirens, huh...<br>
Their arrival in that world ushered in a technological golden age, and they must've played an instrumental role in their battle against the invaders.<br>
Although their efforts ended in failure, the things they left behind helped with humanity's resistance.<br>
Wait, are you trying to hint that the Sirens and those extradimensionals are natural enemies, and that's why they were defeated?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Madam M：</span><br>
I'm not hinting at anything. I just love seeing your mind at work.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
What was it all, then? An elaborate illusion you created for me?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Madam M：</span><br>
That depends on what you think. If you think it was real, then it was. If you think it was fake, then fake it is.<br>
<br>
Expressionless as always, she utters yet more esoteric drivel.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Madam M：</span><br>
Reality or fiction? This question isn't particularly important.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Excuse me?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Madam M：</span><br>
I'm saying that it doesn't matter one way or the other to us.<br>
You're not concerned with the veracity of things, are you?<br>
This search came to a tragic end for you. Supposing that I said it was all real, what would you say then?<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
I'd say I regret making such an atrocious mistake, but I'm grateful for being rescued.<br>
If I'd known more about the enemy and shared some thoughts with Rumey, I might've been able to concentrate our forces and achieved a different result.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Madam M：</span><br>
Then if I were to tell you that it was all smoke and mirrors, would your thoughts on the matter change at all?<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
No, but this and that are two different matters.<br>
If it was real, then it was a complete and irreparable tragedy.<br>
But, if it was fake, you could call it an extremely valuable simulation.<br>
Should I face a similar situation in the future, I'll have greater odds of weathering the storm thanks to what I learned here.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Madam M：</span><br>
Those are the same thing.<br>
If you want to retry it, then just give it another shot and try something different. Why wait for the future to come?<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
What are you saying? That I should revisit your illusion and make better choices?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Madam M：</span><br>
I don't remember saying it was an illusion.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Well, if it was real, then what's done is done. How could I start over?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Madam M：</span><br>
That's what I'm wondering. What you should be thinking about is this: If you do get a chance to start over, will you take it?<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Of course I will. I'll keep on changing things until there's no more sadness.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Madam M：</span><br>
Then that's what you should do.<br>
<br>
The light outside the classroom windows grows blindingly bright, enveloping everything in pure whiteness.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Madam M：</span><br>
You will always have freedom of choice.<br>
And when you're not sure which choice to make...<br>
Exhaust all options until you're confident in your answer.<br>

T=T-82<br>
As the bright whiteness fades away, my consciousness is cast into the darkness.<br>
When I open my eyes again, I'm greeted by the ceiling of the break room, instilling in me an awareness of the flow of time.<br>
The communicator by my bedside is blinking. I press the on button and hear a voice message from Duisburg.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Duisburg：</span><br>
We've made a few discoveries that I thought you should know about.<br>
Our engineers found some rather valuable components among the things we salvaged yesterday.<br>
These will let us finally accomplish our goal of fixing our radiation purgers.<br>
They also–<br>
<br>
She enthusiastically told me about the fruits of their salvage operation. It was all the same as before day three.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
6 AM... I'm back, just like Madam M said I'd be.<br>
I've got to make use of this second chance.<br>
(Six hours to go until Rumey's address. Nothing will change if she announces her operation and assigns missions just like before.)<br>
(That means six hours is all I have to alter Rumey's plans.)<br>
(A lot of things to do, with a tight deadline, to boot... First thing's first – coming up with a new strategy.)<br>
<br>
Since I already had many ideas, I managed to finish the battle plan in roughly three hours.<br>
The next thing I did was call Duisburg and ask her to schedule my meeting with Rumey earlier.<br>
Although she was naturally stunned by my sudden suggestion, she nevertheless passed my word on to Rumey out of curiosity.<br>
Approximately 30 minutes later...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Fritz Rumey：</span><br>
...A change to my operation plan?<br>
<br>
Since I already knew how she thinks, I rushed through the introductions before immediately presenting my revised plan.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Fritz Rumey：</span><br>
Hmm. This is an interesting direction.<br>
<br>
My revisions focus on three things: The concentration of our forces, additional scouting of the area, and units committed to collecting samples.<br>
These will improve our probability of completing our main objectives at the cost of potential secondary gains throughout the operation.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Fritz Rumey：</span><br>
You came up with all of this solely because Duisburg called you?<br>
You must have been truly a one-of-a-kind commander prior to your amnesia.<br>
<br>
Needless to say, she is oblivious to the reasons behind this new plan.<br>
I decide not to say anything in response to her compliment to avoid introducing more complexity.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Fritz Rumey：</span><br>
Still, your plan seemingly takes the presence of an enemy ambush for granted.<br>
Why is that?<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Better safe than sorry. The opening phase of a counteroperation is especially crucial.<br>
<br>
Her gaze holds me under scrutiny, but I calmly reply with my prepared response.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
(She'd think I'm crazy if I told her I've already seen what's going to happen.)<br>
(My amnesia is cause for suspicion enough. The last thing I want to do is declare myself a prophet.)<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Fritz Rumey：</span><br>
I... see.<br>
<br>
Thankfully, my identity as a commander from a different time and place lends me enough prestige for Rumey to accept my proposal.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Fritz Rumey：</span><br>
Your plan is a most valuable one. I will include your changes to mine.<br>
Furthermore, I want you in command of my main force during the operation in three days. Will you accept the responsibility?<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
It would be my pleasure.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Fritz Rumey：</span><br>
Excellent. For choosing to stay with the Resistance, I am much obliged.<br>
Let us speak again later. Right now, I must concentrate on my address.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Roger that. By the way, there's one more thing I want to discuss...<br>
<br>
Despite my slight hesitance, I tell her about my idea to investigate the Eternal Stars and gather intel on both our enemies and the Sirens.<br>
To my surprise, she readily approves of it.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
(While my memories are hazy, I'm confident that I'm inextricably linked to the Antiochus' systems.)<br>
(If I can get a full grasp on the weapons they left behind, they'll be a powerful insurance policy in the battles to come.)<br>
(What information we'll gain from investigating the Eternal Stars over these three days will be key.)<br>
{{折叠面板|内容结束}}

<br>
After Rumey's public address, I asked Duisberg and Z52 to accompany me to the Eternal Star in the best condition.<br>
Following a quick voyage on a mass-produced ship, we now stand directly below the underbelly of the giant structure.<br>
It hovers soundlessly in the air, roughly ten meters above the surface.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
(Hovering technology. Reminds me of the United Council's floating battleships.)<br>
(Only more advanced. This structure dwarfs the likes of a battleship.)<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Duisburg：</span><br>
This is Eternal Star 1, the most-intact of the bunch.<br>
We investigated this thing once when we captured it, but we basically found nothing.<br>
Perhaps our ever-dependable Commander will succeed where we failed, though?<br>
<br>
Smiling at me, Duisburg opens the doors on the container resting on the deck.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Duisburg：</span><br>
Well, you first.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
What's this container for?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Duisburg：</span><br>
The thing is floating in the air, remember? Last I checked, none of us here can fly.<br>
<br>
With a snap of Duisburg's fingers, a flock of drones that resemble dragons swoop down and hook into the container's four corners.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Wait, are you going to fly us up there in the container? What are those drones, anyway?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Duisburg：</span><br>
Ornithopter model IB-50, nicknamed "Pterosaur". They were developed from rigging technology.<br>
Just call them Pterosaurs.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
(Ornithopters, of all things... Well, their applications aren't that different from fixed-wing aircraft.)<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Z52：</span><br>
C'mon, let's head up!<br>
<br>
Sometime later...<br>
Once we entered the structure, we were faced with a long corridor measuring three meters wide and five meters tall.<br>
At the end of it was an elevator, this time leading up into the Star's central area.<br>
Here, there are no branching paths, no staircases, and not even any doors.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Duisburg：</span><br>
The outside fools you into thinking there's tons of spaces to explore... In truth, the layout is extremely simple, isn't it?<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
I anticipated this would take three whole days. Now it seems we'll be done in half of one.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Duisburg：</span><br>
That's Siren structures for you – closed, compact, and automated through and through.<br>
If the Sirens hadn't accommodated for us, even this one hallway probably wouldn't exist.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
True.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Duisburg：</span><br>
Those seven pedestals over there – those are the control panels. Only the first is functional.<br>
The only things it can do is open and close the passageway, grant and remove entry privileges, and alter the structure's alertness range. Oh, and toggle view mode on and off.<br>
Let me give you a demonstration.<br>
<br>
Her delicate hands run across the control panel.<br>
In a blink, the walls and the floor turn transparent. Sunlight flows in from all directions, and the sea below us glows golden.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Duisburg：</span><br>
Heehee. This is the view mode. Pretty cool, right?<br>
<br>
It feels like I'm floating in the sky. This unbelievable view seems to span to the edge of the world.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
While it IS a great view, don't you think its real purpose is to provide an optimal overview of the battlefield?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Duisburg：</span><br>
Hmm. Could be.<br>
The thing is, there's no one capable of controlling the Eternal Star in battle, so in practice it's basically just a viewing platform.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
(I see...)<br>
<br>
Breathing a sigh internally, I casually place my hand on the station's control panel.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Control Station 1：</span><br>
Access permission verified.<br>
<br>
A bang echoes through the whole corridor. The lights on the second control panel light up, as though brought to life.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
(I knew it. The Antiochus and I have ties.)<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Duisburg：</span><br>
Holy... I can't believe it! Amazing job!<br>
No one's ever done that before! I've gotta tell Rumey!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Z52：</span><br>
Quick, check if it has any new functions!<br>
<br>
Pushed on by Z52, I walk over to the second station. I swiftly remember how to operate it.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Let's see, this one has... Check system logs, initiate self-recovery, open cargo passageway...<br>
Weapons system overview, adjust interception mode... There is even manual control of every individual weapon.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Z52：</span><br>
So, wait, you can control where to shoot?!<br>
Holy crap! That's the sickest thing I've ever seen!<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Looks like opening the passageway will also let us fix the surrounding Eternal Stars.<br>
We'll even be able to bring back ones that have been rendered inoperable.<br>
One thing is very clear – this will be a massive boost to the Resistance's combat capabilities.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Z52：</span><br>
You know, I'm really starting to admire you!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Fritz Rumey：</span><br>
What a magnificent surprise you have for me.<br>
I'm curious – is the Star able to be repositioned?<br>
Should it be capable of autonomous movement and targeting, many more places will open up for recapture to us.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
That might be asking for too much...<br>
Looking at the data logs, it seems like the Eternal Stars are actually parts of an even bigger machine. They weren't built to be moved on their own.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Fritz Rumey：</span><br>
A bigger machine? This is news to me.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Well, I'm speculating here. It's also possible the Mirror Sea and the energy tower have something to do with this supposed machine.<br>
But, unfortunately, some parts are still missing. They never did finish constructing it.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Fritz Rumey：</span><br>
Yes... That is unfortunate.<br>
It is much beyond our current capabilities to complete this machine of theirs.<br>
Even so, this is a monumental discovery for our forces.<br>
Hmm. Something appears to be up with Eternal Star One. Did you initiate maintenance?<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Yeah. While this one is in the best condition, the self-diagnostic I ran found heaps upon heaps of issues.<br>
Luckily, none of them are major. The maintenance should be done fairly soon.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Fritz Rumey：</span><br>
......<br>
<br>
Rumey bites her tongue, seemingly holding back some emotion.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Fritz Rumey：</span><br>
I'll leave the rest to you, Commander.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Thanks. I'll do everything I can.<br>
(The operation starts in three days. Until then, I'll have to get the other Eternal Stars in as good a condition as possible.)<br>

<br>
Three days passed in the blink of an eye. The time to fight has finally come.<br>
Thanks to the revised strategy, we quickly discovered the main extradimensional force, concentrated our attacks, and defeated them without issue.<br>
The real surprise was the amount of samples we'd obtained, accomplishing the postponed mission in the process.<br>
Currently, the main fleet is sailing smoothly toward the Silberstern.<br>
Due to our emphasis on firepower this time, we had opted not to assign landing and escort fleets. Thus, total control and large-scale mining of the island were excluded from this mission's objective.<br>
After clearing out all of the threats around the island, the main force would set up automatic mining stations to get only the necessary materials to fix the radiation purgers.<br>
This was another revision I'd made to the plan.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Z52：</span><br>
Everyone, look! The mining site is right up ahead!<br>
<br>
She points at a tall mountain on the edge of the island.<br>
The mountain is covered in debris instead of grass, giving it a metallic sheen.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Fritz Rumey：</span><br>
Come now. Did you think we would be mining from a mine?<br>
We plan to mine mineralized energy, a special kind of ore that grows from metallic debris. It's one of the principal materials of Energy Cubes.<br>
Long ago, each faction cultivated high-purity mineralized energy and produced countless Energy Cubes.<br>
That boundless energy once powered our civilization's golden age... We only live in its afterglow today.<br>
<br>
Rumey lets a sardonic smile slip.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
(Energy Cubes? Why do I feel like I've heard of those before...)<br>
<br>
A ray of light shines at the far end of the ocean, seemingly beaming a flood of information into my mind.<br>
……<br>
The Cube Standardization Summit ended today, making the results of the conference publicly available on the last day of its schedule.<br>
The Summit designated the official international name of the Energy Cube as "ε-Cube"...<br>
...and also provided a series of standards for its production and utilization.<br>
Unlike with conventional energy sources, the most important thing about producing ε-Cubes is the construction of a complex synthetic container.<br>
Differences in specifications during the production process of this container will directly affect the quality of the resulting ε-Cube.<br>
……<br>
……<br>
...After thoroughly analyzing all the data left in the Polar Decompilation project, our team has made remarkable progress in studying the material compositions of ε-Cubes.<br>
The ε-Cube does not inherit the properties of the materials used to make it, but rather changes based upon those materials.<br>
Simply put, an ε-Cube is more than the sum of the components used to make it.<br>
Of course, neither wood nor paper are suitable materials for the construction of an ε-Cube shell...<br>
...but with this knowledge, we once again open ourselves to countless new possibilities worth trying...<br>
……<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
(Are these more of the memories that I lost?)<br>
(All about Energy Cubes, at that. And the people of this world use this material to produce Energy Cubes?)<br>
(But what is this mineralized energy deal? That doesn't match my memories at all.)<br>
(The most important part of Energy Cube production was the construction of a complex synthetic container...)<br>
(Is that container the processed version of this mineral?)<br>
<br>
I didn't get any more information after that, so I didn't arrive at any meaningful conclusion.<br>
Meanwhile, Rumey and her fleet set up their automatic mining machines, and their mining robots got to work.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
The counteroperation is off to a good start with this bounty of strategic materials.<br>
It looks like we're out of danger... for now.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Communicator：</span><br>
BEEP BEEP!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Z11：</span><br>
U-u-urgent report! Can you hear me?!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Fritz Rumey：</span><br>
What happened?! Answer at once!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Z11：</span><br>

<br>
Rumey's Resistance fleet rushed back for headquarters at flank speed.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Duisburg：</span><br>
Rumey, Commander. Continuing along this direct route will bring us into treacherous waters.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
(Treacherous waters?)<br>
How much of a threat does this route pose to our main fleet?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Fritz Rumey：</span><br>
There is a level of risk. An acceptable level, though, given the size of our force.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Duisburg：</span><br>
So you're saying...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Fritz Rumey：</span><br>
Every second counts. We stay the course.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Duisburg：</span><br>
Roger that!<br>
<br>
<br>
KABOOOM!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Duisburg：</span><br>
Commander! Rumey! The attacks from our flanks are too strong! Our formation is breaking!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Fritz Rumey：</span><br>
I will cover the rear! Have all ships reform 30 nautical miles ahead!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Duisburg：</span><br>
Understood! I'll relay that at once!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Fritz Rumey：</span><br>
Commander, lead with the command ship and oversee the reformation effort! As soon as it's complete, proceed to base immediately!<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
If they know our plans, then their next move...<br>
Rumey. Are extradimensionals known to attack via self-destruction?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Fritz Rumey：</span><br>
They're beasts. They follow only their instincts – never would they end their own lives for a greater goal.<br>
They flee in the face of overwhelming odds, and it's extremely rare for them to fight to the death. If they ever did self-destruct, it would be...<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
...Because their leader forced them to.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Fritz Rumey：</span><br>
Good lord! But that can't–<br>
<br>
KABOOOM!<br>
Amidst the explosion of the mass-produced ship, my consciousness is thrown into the empty abyss.<br>
SHUFFLE...<br>
Then, I hear the sound of cards shuffling.<br>
<br>
<br>
KABOOOM!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Extradimensional Horde：</span><br>
ROOOOOAR!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Z52：</span><br>
Oh no... We're going as fast as we can, but they're faster!<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
This horde is even stronger than the last!<br>
Rumey, they're testing us and whittling away our forces all at once.<br>
They attack our headquarters AND intercept us when we return to defend it... Something must be leading them, that's for sure.<br>
It's too dangerous to press on. Rumey, requesting a change of course.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Fritz Rumey：</span><br>
You think there's a Chief out there? Those things don't show up often ever since we lost the Sirens.<br>
The last one was decades ago. I know that you're concerned, but you must be overthinking it.<br>
We're halfway through already, and we've sustained close to no damage.<br>
Your prudence is commendable, yes, but our defenses at HQ are thin without our main fleet.<br>
We have no choice but to risk it. Keep moving forward, now!<br>

Is that you, Helena? Have you already solved your problem?<br>

What's the situation?<br>

Nagato and Hiei from test site beta are back to normal, but we can't leave Camelot.<br>
<span style="color:#ffc960;">Helena META：</span><br>
Well, I happen to know why. Test site beta has moved somewhere.<br>
<span style="color:#c3abff;">Jintsuu META：</span><br>
Did you say it MOVED?<br>
<span style="color:#ffc960;">Helena META：</span><br>
The Empress did it. She was plotting this whole time.<br>
There's nothing outside of Camelot. That's why you can't leave.<br>
<span style="color:#c3abff;">Jintsuu META：</span><br>
I'm guessing... you don't know where beta is, either.<br>
<span style="color:#ffc960;">Helena META：</span><br>
Yes, she's really done it this time. But I think we owe D a debt of gratitude.<br>
Activate the communicator she left and maintain a connection with test site beta. Don't cut off comms with me, either.<br>
<span style="color:#c3abff;">Jintsuu META：</span><br>
You're going to trace it backward?<br>

Former World Expo Venue<br>
Sakura Empire Pavilion<br>
A day had passed since the Sakurans had arrived at their pavilion.<br>
Thanks to everyone's coordinated efforts, the recording and repairing of the rupture was proceeding smoothly.<br>
A barrier for Kaga had been raised, and she was performing the final preparations by herself.<br>
In spite of the situation at hand, some still found the time to rest and chat.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Memphis：</span><br>
...And that's every story I have about the Commander.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Amagi(CV)：</span><br>
From the Long Island defense line, to the Bermuda Sea, to the counteroffensive in the NA Ocean...<br>
There is also the World Expo incident, and the battle inside Naraka that was just fought.<br>
The Commander really has fought alongside the Eagle Union in many, many places.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Memphis：</span><br>
Yeah, I suppose so.<br>
Helena's fought under the Commander for a long time. I might have fought just a teensy bit longer, though.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Akagi：</span><br>
Ah, that gives you bragging rights amongst all the groupies.<br>
Am I supposed to act jealous now?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Memphis：</span><br>
Ugh, you...<br>
You think you're such a big deal. All you've done is nearly end the world and make the Commander weep for you. Then you had to be rescued.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Akagi：</span><br>
It's true. I made a great mistake and caused much trouble for the Commander.<br>
Despite that, the Commander saved me, and even accepted my obsessions.<br>
I'm ready to give up anything for that person, even my own life. Can you say the same?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Memphis：</span><br>
You still nearly ended the world as we know it, and the Commander along with it...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Akagi：</span><br>
That is precisely why the love in my heart must burn hotter than anyone else's.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Memphis：</span><br>
*sigh*...<br>
<br>
Memphis could only roll her eyes at the audacity.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Unzen：</span><br>
My, what's this lively conversation about?<br>
<br>
A voice spoke out, and a beam of light shot into the pavilion, assuming the form of a shipgirl.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Memphis：</span><br>
Who are you?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Akagi：</span><br>
Unzen? What brings you here?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Unzen：</span><br>
I heard you two talking about the Commander, so I thought I should share an old story of mine.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Shinano ：</span><br>
A story with us to share, have you?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Unzen：</span><br>
Yes. Long ago, when the Naval Academy delegation paid a visit to our homeland.<br>
It's about a person who feared not getting lost – a person who passed through countless barriers and paths to reach me...<br>

<br>
When the light fades, that bright classroom once again appears before my eyes.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Madam M's classroom. I'm back again, aren't I?<br>
<br>
Repressing the mental anguish of experiencing death firsthand, I survey my surroundings.<br>
As expected, the purple-haired lady stands at the podium. She shoots me a thoughtful look.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Madam M：</span><br>
So, did you enjoy this second search?<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Despite all my caution, I fell right at the finish line.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Madam M：</span><br>
Heehee. Not enough information, I take it?<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Just like when we were readying our counterattack, the extradimensionals caught us in a trap.<br>
There HAS to be a leader planning their actions, but who?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Madam M：</span><br>
You know I'm not going to tell you.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Figures.<br>
<br>
A sigh escapes my lips over her stubborn attitude.<br>
At the same time, I notice that there's a girl in white clothes sitting next to my desk.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">???：</span><br>
Did you remember anything?<br>
<br>
She speaks to me with innocent curiosity in her eyes.<br>
Her presence here feels unbelievably natural, like she has been here from the very start.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Yeah. Some things, at least.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">???：</span><br>
Good...<br>
<br>
There is a tiny change in her expression for just a moment – it's a smile.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Madam M：</span><br>
Back on topic. We were going to talk about you.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
I still have so many questions for you.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Madam M：</span><br>
You don't give up, do you? Even when you know how I'm going to answer.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
I'm well aware that you won't give me straight answers. I just want to discuss them with you.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Madam M：</span><br>
Well, that I can do. What's on your mind, then?<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Now, this is only a theory, but assuming that everything I experienced was real...<br>
What happens to the world the moment I leave it? After going back in time to make a new choice, that is.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Madam M：</span><br>
Perhaps it naturally develops into another possibility. Or perhaps it all vanishes into nothingness.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Those two couldn't be any more different. Wait, let me guess – they're the same, aren't they?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Madam M：</span><br>
Correct. They are.<br>
Because the moment you made your choice, that world thereafter became "real" from your perspective.<br>
As for other, branching outcomes, they were demoted to mere possibilities.<br>
Perhaps they are possible, perhaps they aren't. They may continue past that point, or they may cease right there and then.<br>
What difference does it make to you, as one who lives in "certainty"?<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
You're forgetting the people other than me. What about them?<br>
If my choice causes the world to deviate toward another branch that I cannot observe, how do other people perceive this branch?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Madam M：</span><br>
Other people. Of course.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Okay, let's take the girls from the Resistance as an example.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Madam M：</span><br>
Their existence in and of itself is simply one possibility. Discussing what-ifs about them is meaningless.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
They're "simply one possibility"? What does that make you, then?<br>
If you're saying only outside observers are worth discussion, then there's two of us. You've been observing them, too.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Madam M：</span><br>
Not quite. I've only been observing you and the immediate space around you.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Uh-huh. And what if you want to observe the past again?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Madam M：</span><br>
If I feel like doing that, then I'll do it.<br>
But, no matter I see or have seen, it means nothing to you.<br>
What-ifs – that is, possibilities – mean nothing compared to established facts.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Let's put the whole "this has meaning, that doesn't" talk to rest. You can observe infinite possible worlds while I cannot.<br>
What I'm wondering is – can I only move down a path made up of certainties?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Madam M：</span><br>
...Ah. I see what you were going for now. Frankly, I underestimated you.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
I thought so.<br>
The secret to that ability of yours lies in the Antiochus' system.<br>
That world – it's a test site, isn't it? That's why it can be observed.<br>
<br>
While she neither confirms nor denies my statement, her lips seem to stiffen a little.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Possibilities are endless and unable to be predicted. Throw an outside observer into the mix, though, and the possibilities converge, become facts, and gain meaning.<br>
That is why the Antiochus came up with test sites.<br>
Every test site is recorded in their system once they intervene at a specific point in time.<br>
What's more, every test site can continue being monitored even after the Antiochus' departure, thanks to the presence of their creations.<br>
Any given branch is a parallel possibility – until Antiochus arrives and makes it their test site, thus making it definite, real, and meaningful.<br>
Am I correct?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Madam M：</span><br>
......<br>
Not completely.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Is it not just the test sites? Is there something else that you observe?<br>
Oh... Now I get it. That's why you've been observing me.<br>
Every time I arrive at the truth, new possibilities are made definite, thus creating test sites. Is that it?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Madam M：</span><br>
See?<br>
As long as you're given an environment to think in, you can make one discovery after the next, no?<br>
Discussion time is over. Now it's time to make your next choice.<br>
Do you want to continue?<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
......<br>

<br>
T=T-8<br>
Over on the Silberstern, I see mining robots hard at work, running from place to place.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
(Now I'm back to just before the attack? That's about eight hours back...)<br>
(Dammit... I have so little time to work with. How do I do this?)<br>
(Should I order readiness for an ambush right now?)<br>
(It'll buy us some time, at least. Then I need to warn Rumey about rushing into dangerous territory...)<br>
(Working out a basic solution is going to require a bigger fleet.)<br>
(Wait... A bigger fleet...)<br>
<br>
A ray of light shines at the far end of the ocean, seemingly beaming a flood of information into my mind.<br>
......<br>
...The experiment finally worked!<br>
By improving the materials, we succeeded in creating a variant of the ε-Cube... We didn't have a name for it, but after doing some research and getting feedback from the other team members...<br>
Yeah, let's go with "Wisdom Cube."<br>
I like the sound of that!<br>
......<br>
......<br>
Today, we will discuss what has been dubbed the "META phenomenon."<br>
"META" itself is derived from an ancient word which means "change."<br>
It is quite broad in meaning, but for our purposes, it refers to the result of a property having undergone change.<br>
The process itself of a property changing is what is known as "METAmorphosis."<br>
This process has been observed in Wisdom Cubes.<br>
Cases of METAmorphosis have been observed in certain shipgirl subjects as well.<br>
......<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
(Another memory fragment. Perfect timing.)<br>
(There's a variant of the Energy Cube known as the Wisdom Cube...)<br>
(That's odd – how come there are Wisdom Cubes in this world?)<br>
(If the Resistance could use Wisdom Cubes to expand their fleet, they wouldn't be in these dire straits right now. So what went wrong?)<br>
(Without any Cubes, our only option is to rely on Admiral Hipper META to save us.)<br>
<br>
A while later, I've come to Rumey. She is overseeing the mining operation.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Fritz Rumey：</span><br>
Is something the matter? Your expression tells me so.<br>
<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项1：We've got to talk about Wisdom Cubes...</span>'''''<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Fritz Rumey：</span><br>
...Wisdom Cubes? How long it's been since I heard those words.<br>
It is as you say. We are beings born of those Cubes.<br>
Alas, all our Cube-gathering technology disappeared with the Sirens, and our stockpile has long since run out.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
(Wait, "gathering technology"?)<br>
Are you saying that Cubes are collected somehow?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Fritz Rumey：</span><br>
Indeed. A unique ore rests deep below the sea, I've heard. Only the Sirens knew how to retrieve it.<br>
Even should the technology be returned to us, building the necessary facilities to gather the material is a pipe dream in our circumstances.<br>
<br>
She cracks a bitter smile of self-deprecation.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
(That's not what I remember. It said the Wisdom Cube was created as a variation on the Energy Cube.)<br>
(Did the Sirens restrict their access to that information?)<br>
(Well, even if they did, it's far too late to change now.)<br>
<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项1：I want to get in touch with Admiral Hipper META.</span>'''''<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Fritz Rumey：</span><br>
Hipper, you say?<br>
Ah, yes, it was she who first discovered you. Do you have questions for her?<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
The Resistance's relationship with her is pretty complicated, based on what Duisburg told me.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Fritz Rumey：</span><br>
You can say that again.<br>
Her name is to this day on the Duchy's wanted list. That isn't to say we seek to arrest her, though.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Did she end up turning META because of something the Duchy did?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Fritz Rumey：</span><br>
Long ago, we fought a war and lost.<br>
We followed our orders and carried out our mission. There was no outside interference or internal strife. Still, we lost.<br>
We took our defeat and accepted it. Hipper, however, did not.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
So she fought the Duchy and wound up on the wanted list, I assume.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Fritz Rumey：</span><br>
...This was long in the past.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Sorry if I touched on a delicate subject.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Fritz Rumey：</span><br>
Later on, Hipper would not antagonize us. In fact, she would even at times assist us with Rising Tides.<br>
Though, if you asked her, she would never admit to it. It must be a matter of pride to her.<br>
Duisburg can tell you more about her than I. Summon her, will you?<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
There's no time for that. We can get into the nitty-gritty another time.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Fritz Rumey：</span><br>
What? No time?<br>
<br>
She becomes suddenly alert after her stint in the sea of memories.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Fritz Rumey：</span><br>
What do you mean? Can you explain?<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
The situation has changed.<br>
The extradimensionals have a leader, and they're using our counteroperation as an opportunity for something.<br>
Since your biggest guns are with us, the smartest thing to do is raise the base's alertness level and return as soon as possible.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Fritz Rumey：</span><br>
They have a Chief class, in other words... If there is one, it's a serious threat.<br>
There hasn't been a single sighting of a Chief class in decades since the Sirens left, however.<br>
How can you be certain there is one when we haven't even seen the shadow of an indication of it?<br>
<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项1：(Explain it with logic.)</span>'''''<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项2：(Appeal to her trust.)</span>'''''<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项1）</span>'''''They were already well-positioned and prepared an ambush. Mindless beasts don't do that. There is a very good chance someone is leading them.<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项1）</span>'''''Moreover, your allies back at HQ are repairing the Eternal Stars and have their guard down. That makes them easy targets.<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项1）</span>'''''Excessive pride invites mistakes and leads to defeat. This is something I failed to tell you before our departure.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Fritz Rumey：</span><br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项1）</span>'''''Yes... All excellently made points. The Eternal Stars' reactivation made me overconfident.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项2）</span>'''''My commander's instinct is screaming it at me. Trust me on this.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Fritz Rumey：</span><br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项2）</span>'''''"Instinct" isn't a satisfactory answer. How certain is this instinctual feeling of yours?<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项2）</span>'''''100% certain.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Fritz Rumey：</span><br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项2）</span>'''''Very well. I trust you.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Fritz Rumey：</span><br>
I will contact the base posthaste.<br>
<br>
One hour later, my "prediction" comes true, and the base is attacked.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Communicator：</span><br>
BEEP BEEP!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Z11：</span><br>
U-u-urgent report! Can you hear me?!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Fritz Rumey：</span><br>
What happened?! Answer at once!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Z11：</span><br>
A sw-swarm of extradimensionals are attacking the base!<br>
We're just about holding our ground because we raised the alertness level to maximum, and... Anyway!<br>
The enemy's kinda going ham out there, but we moved our defenses and they're holding up!<br>
That was some sick foresight on your part!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Fritz Rumey：</span><br>
It was not me who predicted the attack – it was the Commander.<br>
Get your forces together and bolster the defense! Once our capital ships are there, we will pincer the enemy and annihilate them!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Z11：</span><br>
Got it! Thanks a ton you too, Mandy!<br>
<br>
Rumey terminates the call, then turns to me with a look of suspicion.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Fritz Rumey：</span><br>
It is exactly as you predicted. What do we do now?<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
(The only thing I know is that the enemy is waiting in ambush in the danger zone...)<br>
(The base's defenses are solid... Ah, I know!)<br>
Since HQ was ready and they have the Eternal Stars, they should be able to hold their own.<br>
I'll admit, I might have suggested a return to base too hastily. As far as I can see, our original mission objectives are still completable to some degree.<br>
Securing the minimum we need is better than going home emptyhanded.<br>
Duisburg, how's the mining coming along?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Duisburg：</span><br>
It's about 30% of our goal.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Fritz Rumey：</span><br>
We cannot afford to wait for its completion.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
That is true. Enough for one radiation purger will have to do for now.<br>
That's enough for us to say we accomplished what we set out to do.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Fritz Rumey：</span><br>
There you have it, Duisburg. As soon as we have the materials for one device, recover the equipment and retreat.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Duisburg：</span><br>
Understood.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
There is the possibility that our force is their real target. I want everyone as ready for battle as can be when we head back.<br>
Let's aim for a return route that's as quick AND as safe as possible.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Fritz Rumey：</span><br>
Z52, help the Commander plot a course. There will be no running in blindly.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Z52：</span><br>
You got it!<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Oh, and I'd like to request one additional reinforcement.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Fritz Rumey：</span><br>
Come again? Let me remind you – we are the only combat-ready fleet in this area.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Almost. There's Hipper. Send her a request for assistance. Doesn't matter if it's unencrypted.<br>
Knowing her track record, she'll agree to help. We need her strength right now.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Fritz Rumey：</span><br>
It's worth a try. I cannot guarantee her aid, but the more support we have, the better.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Thank you, Rumey. We'll set off as soon as everyone is ready!<br>

<br>
The fleet sailed onward, maintaining vigilant, and arrived back at the headquarters.<br>
Duisburg tried to contact Hipper numerous times, but in the end, she did not show up in our defense.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Z52：</span><br>
Whew... Back at last!<br>
Man, these Eternal Stars are running way better than I thought! Those extradimensionals are stuck at the outer periphery!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Duisburg：</span><br>
Yup. This is our best chance to strike them from both sides.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Communicator：</span><br>
BEEP BEEP!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Fritz Rumey：</span><br>
Z11, we have reached the base. Give me a report on the enemy's deployments.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Z11：</span><br>
Uhh, what? D-did you only just arrive?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Fritz Rumey：</span><br>
...Why do you ask?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Z11：</span><br>
Because, um, a force outside our defense line attacked the enemy about an hour ago.<br>
It seemed like a pretty powerful force, so I just assumed it was you and you couldn't radio us or something...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Fritz Rumey：</span><br>
There is another force? In what direction? I must see for myself!<br>
<br>
Rumey's recon aircraft returned quickly with answers.<br>
The extradimensionals were being intercepted by one single person – a young lady with a flat profile.<br>
KABOOOM!<br>
<span style="color:#ffc960;">Admiral Hipper META：</span><br>
Since you've got such a death wish, I'll be your wish-granter!<br>
In the name of the Admiral Hipper class, I will play a song to soothe your souls!<br>
<br>
KABOOOM!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Z52：</span><br>
Hipper's here?!<br>
That explains why she wouldn't answer our calls!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Duisburg：</span><br>
Heheh. She's just too nice to turn her back on us.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Fritz Rumey：</span><br>
She has gotten even stronger in the long time since I last saw her.<br>
Her fighting style, though, is still the same.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Duisburg：</span><br>
Should we link up with her?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Fritz Rumey：</span><br>
What say you, Commander?<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Supposing that we do, what do you reckon the odds are that she'll help with our mission?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Fritz Rumey：</span><br>
I'm not sure. Given the circumstances, it seems a very slim chance.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Then let's not push it. She can do it her way and keep the enemy off balance.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Z9：</span><br>
Rumey, Commander, here are the enemy's p-positions.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
(There are fewer of them than I anticipated. Hipper must've really cut them down to size.)<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Fritz Rumey：</span><br>
First, let us deal with the group 60 degrees to the east, then we'll rendezvous with Hipper and take out the ones 95 degrees from there. Finally, we'll clean them up in order. How about that?<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Sounds good. I'll contact headquarters and request supporting fire. Everyone, prepare to engage!<br>

Our counteroffensive went smoothly. The enemy markers on the monitor vanished one after the next, and victory seemed but a shot away.<br>
But right at that moment, a shocking development occurred.<br>
A star overhead suddenly glows blindingly brightly, its magnified radiance lighting up half of the night sky in the blink of an eye.<br>
The white heavens become diffused with innumerable blue lights that flicker in and out of existence. It's like someone has inverted the colors of the night.<br>
A strange sound – like encroaching waves – rings out, resonating with everything and everyone and shaking the very soul.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Duisburg：</span><br>
Oh my god... Is that a Lord class?! I thought they were a myth!<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
A Lord class?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Fritz Rumey：</span><br>
A being that surpasses even the Chief class... The true leader of the extradimensionals.<br>
The Star Beast is its name... It has only appeared three times throughout history.<br>
Every appearance has been marked with disaster.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
That makes this the fourth time...<br>
How did you deal with it the previous three?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Fritz Rumey：</span><br>
The first time, we threw all of humanity's golden age creations at it. The second, the Sirens displayed their final glory.<br>
The third – we could do nothing but witness its fury.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
......<br>
This is looking grim.<br>
<br>
Countless feelers appear, reaching into the sky as though trying to stitch it and the sea together.<br>
The waves grow strong and furious, striking fear into the heart of every shipgirl.<br>
<span style="color:#ffc960;">Admiral Hipper META：</span><br>
Star Beast...<br>
Back then... It was you!<br>
Ahahahaha... Finally, I've found you!<br>
Yes... It's time!<br>
Time to take revenge for what you did to my sisters!<br>
I was weak back then – but not anymore!<br>
Your death will be the Admiral Hipper class' crowning achievement!<br>
<br>
Hipper gazed up at the vast sky and declared her intent for all to hear.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Z52：</span><br>
No, Hipper! Calm down!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Duisburg：</span><br>
It's no use. She won't listen to us.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>

Sardegna Empire<br>
Former World Expo Venue<br>
Sakura Empire Pavilion<br>
The day to perform the Rite of Return had come.<br>
The shipgirls had done everything that they could. Now they could only wait with bated breath.<br>
Along with a surge of light, golden butterflies appeared and flew through the hall.<br>
The butterflies touched the barriers one by one, lighting them up like machines coming to life.<br>
Elsewhere, this same ritual was being held.<br>
In the east, inside the Dragon Palace within the Pacific.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Memphis：</span><br>
Wow... This ritual is way more impressive than the ones in Bell's movies.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Helena：</span><br>
It feels like some strange power is surrounding me... Are these "souls"?<br>
<br>
After the golden butterflies came ones dyed purple.<br>
The two joined in a colorful dance, restoring life to the ruined land and renewing the decayed building. Their fallen comrade opened her eyes once more.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Shinano ：</span><br>
Musashi... You are back...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Amagi(CV)：</span><br>
Isn't this wonderful, Akagi? The ritual was a success.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Akagi：</span><br>
Yes... It's wonderful.<br>
<br>
Whilst the lights from the barriers mixed, another person appeared inside the hall.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Unzen：</span><br>
Lady Yamato has ordered me to pass on her congratulations on the successful ritual.<br>
Lady Musashi is back to normal and knows what must be done next.<br>
With the ritual complete, it is now time to activate the magic circle with which to find the Commander.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Shinano ：</span><br>
Most splendid...<br>
<br>
A third butterfly – a blue one – spread its wings in the hall.<br>
The power of the barriers warped the floor and walls around them, revealing dozens more hidden magic circles.<br>
The illusory night sky overhead and the myriad of ritual barriers below began to glow.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Unzen：</span><br>
Have you chosen a tracking pointer?<br>
<br>
The tracking pointer was the person who would determine the magic circle's search range to locate the Commander.<br>
This person had to remain at the heart of the magic circle, using the ritual's power to ward off cognitive interference.<br>
Not only would the person have to endure the burden of controlling this mighty power, but they at the same time needed to pin down traces of the Commander amidst an incoming flood of information.<br>
This required a resilient mind, and the process could inflict serious harm if sustained for a long period.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Akagi：</span><br>
I will do it.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Amagi(CV)：</span><br>
I'm here if you need to stop. Don't overdo it now, okay?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Akagi：</span><br>
I know. I won't.<br>
While I'm not as compatible with the Watatsumi as you, I'm more than sufficient for the task.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Unzen：</span><br>
Very well. Who shall be the guiding mark?<br>
<br>
The guiding mark was the one responsible for denoting the target and aiding with the pursuit.<br>
Whilst the original ritual had no such position, it was added in light of the handkerchief that Memphis gave to the Commander.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Memphis：</span><br>
Well, seeing as Clemenceau isn't here, and it was my handkerchief, I'll do it.<br>
Don't worry. Akagi and I will bring the Commander home safely!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Unzen：</span><br>
Both of you step into the magic circle, please.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Akagi：</span><br>
Of course. I'm ready.<br>
<br>
Akagi and Memphis set foot inside the magic circle.<br>
The lights dancing through the air spun around the circle and formed rings, then turned into columns of light that encased the two.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Memphis：</span><br>
(Wait for us, Commander...)<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Akagi：</span><br>
(I'm coming to save you, my dear Commander...)<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Unzen：</span><br>
Magic circle, activate!<br>

<br>
I'm back again – inside that well-lit classroom.<br>
Madam M looks at me with a smile on her lips, steps down from her podium, and walks up to me.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Madam M：</span><br>
Did you like the big surprise?<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Surprise? I'd call it a terrible shock. I should've figured you knew about it all along.<br>
What was that? The Star Beast.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Madam M：</span><br>
Good question. It's something you stand no chance against.<br>
You cannot defeat it. Not as you are now, anyway.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Exactly what I was thinking.<br>
Things could've turned out differently if I'd prepared for it sooner, though.<br>
You've sent me three days back before – can you send me back three years, or thirty?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Madam M：</span><br>
What, are you going to live there from now on?<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Aren't there endless possibilities? I can keep trying new things.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Madam M：</span><br>
There were, at first. Now, not so much.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Why not? You already sent me back in time twice.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Madam M：</span><br>
Three days is the limit. Well, four days, to be precise.<br>
You've only witnessed four days' worth of that world's possibilities.<br>
That includes your first observation – the day that you set foot in that world. I can send you back to that moment or any time later, but not before that.<br>
After all, there cannot be more than one first observation, can there?<br>
You can jump branches and return to an earlier starting point. That's certainly possible...<br>
But that isn't what you're hoping to do, is it?<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
No.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Madam M：</span><br>
Heehee. Well, what is the difference between this and that?<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
I don't know... I don't have a concrete theory yet.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Madam M：</span><br>
Okay. Keep on thinking, then.<br>
Will you keep on choosing, even if it means having to confront that nightmarish enemy?<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Of course. If I give up, it's all over.<br>
This isn't even a nightmare scenario yet. There are loads of things I can try.<br>
For example, I could have them relocate the base and convince them to flee from the Star Beast.<br>
I'll do whatever it takes to make the world better.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Madam M：</span><br>
Heehee. I'm excited to see you try.<br>

<br>
T=T-5<br>
Staring through the porthole of the mass-produced ship, I see the shipgirls fighting outside.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
(This is in the vicinity of the base. Five hours until the Star Beast arrives.)<br>
(There's reason to believe it can't just linger here forever.)<br>
(In that case, we should retreat at once and hide until it decides to go away.)<br>
(The problem is, abandoning the headquarters so suddenly will incur heavy casualties for the Resistance.)<br>
(Retreating while they're surrounded on all sides is a lot to ask, too.)<br>
(If that's out of the question, the only thing left is to stall for time while probing for the Star Beast's weakness.)<br>
(Though it seems unstoppable, they have repelled it twice in the past. There must be a way to counter it.)<br>
(Taking advantage of the facilities the Sirens left behind might buy us enough time until the Beast goes away.)<br>
(To fight, or to retreat – I'll let the girls make that choice.)<br>
<br>
Looking up, I see Rumey's recon aircraft in the air. The news about Hipper will reach us any second now.<br>
<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项1：(Brief her on the Star Beast.)</span>'''''<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Fritz Rumey：</span><br>
The Star Beast? You mean the leader of the extradimensionals?<br>
Why do you bring that up now?<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Because it's commanding the enemies we're fighting right now.<br>
(I have to cut to the chase. There's no time to waste.)<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Fritz Rumey：</span><br>
If that's your idea of a joke, I'm not laughing.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
No. I'm dead serious.<br>
<br>
She looks me right in the eyes, searching for any indication that I'm lying.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Fritz Rumey：</span><br>
How certain are you about this?<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Beyond a doubt. We have less than five hours before it shows up.<br>
I also know that Hipper got here before us and went to town – and that she has an ax to grind with it.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Fritz Rumey：</span><br>
...How do you know that?<br>
I only just sent out my recon aircraft.<br>
<br>
She shifts her gaze away.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Fritz Rumey：</span><br>
You best not be fooling me.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Does the Star Beast have any weaknesses? You've fought it off before, haven't you?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Fritz Rumey：</span><br>
Yes... Assuming it does appear, this will be our fourth encounter.<br>
You're not earnestly considering fending it off, are you?<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Quite the opposite. We should steer clear of it.<br>
Is it possible to evacuate the headquarters within four hours?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Fritz Rumey：</span><br>
......<br>
The personnel, yes, but we will be forced to abandon almost all of our supplies and equipment.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Lives are worth more than materials.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Fritz Rumey：</span><br>
Yet lives alone cannot win wars.<br>
<br>
She shakes her head and retorts with bitterness in her tone.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Fritz Rumey：</span><br>
That island is the last stronghold with the means to manufacture and maintain the equipment the Resistance needs.<br>
If we lose it and are forced to fall back on hastily-made, transferred supplies, we will not even make it to any allied territory.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Fleeing is out of the question, then.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Fritz Rumey：</span><br>
Yes. Fighting is only our choice.<br>
For us, at least. You, on the other hand...<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
I'm one of you. I can't just abandon you.<br>
The last time the Star Beast appeared, how long did its fury last?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Fritz Rumey：</span><br>
17 days.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Was everything in its path destroyed?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Fritz Rumey：</span><br>
Everything save for a few sturdy fortifications the Sirens left behind.<br>
Do you hope to use one of those and weather the storm there?<br>
Our headquarters is no straw hut, but it is nothing compared to the great strongholds of the Sirens.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
You're right – as it stands, it won't endure, but we could try reinforcing it.<br>
The Sirens were trying to build some sort of colossal structure right where we stand.<br>
The Eternal Stars were going to be its offense modules, and the energy tower its power source. It's no stretch to assume that the Mirror Sea was to be its defensive component.<br>
If we can reconfigure its parts like we did with the Eternal Stars, they might function as the Sirens intended them–<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Fritz Rumey：</span><br>
Hold on. I remember a report on this.<br>
Here it is. Our engineering team gave it to me prior to departure.<br>
Apparently, the third and fourth stations in the hall aboard Eternal Star 1 flickered for just a moment following its repairs.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
That's it! Do the other structures have access halls just like that?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Fritz Rumey：</span><br>
They do, but Eternal Star 1 is the most broad in scope.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
What if number one isn't just a weapon, but also the command center of the whole thing?<br>
I think that's worth investigating.<br>
I almost forgot about Hipper... Is it possible to make her follow orders?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Fritz Rumey：</span><br>
Yes. I believe she'll agree to work with us if she learns that the Star Beast is coming.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Then let's narrow our defense line and focus on conserving strength instead of eliminating the enemy.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Fritz Rumey：</span><br>
I agree. Let us split up and each get ready.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Roger. I'll head straight to Eternal Star 1.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Fritz Rumey：</span><br>
Z52, you are to escort the Commander.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Z52：</span><br>
On it! Heheh!<br>
{{折叠面板|内容结束}}

{{折叠面板|标题=Vanish in the Mist|选项=22|主框=1|样式=primary|展开=是}}
<br>
Z52 dashes bravely through the herd of extradimensionals.<br>
I switch from the warship and board a high-speed boat, following her wake.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Z52：</span><br>
Thunderheart, burst!<br>
<br>
KABOOOM!<br>
Sensing a change in the battle, the extradimensionals extend their feelers to try to cut off our path.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Z52：</span><br>
Too slow!<br>
Thunderheart, burn and send 'em flying!<br>
<br>
KABOOOM!<br>
She breaches through the wall of tentacles before its completion.<br>
BZZZZT!<br>
A strange sound suddenly rings out, and for an instant, it feels like the boat's engine and my heart completely stop.<br>
The next moment, though, that sensation vanishes like it was nothing.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
I felt that. The enemy's feeling pressured.<br>
That means our plan is working.<br>
Relax. I'm not going anywhere.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Z52：</span><br>
Almost at the target! Pterosaurs, go!<br>
<br>
The drones scatter the incoming enemies and carry off my boat into the Eternal Star.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Z52：</span><br>
Z52, regrouping with original fleet!<br>
Here's hoping this will work!<br>
Good luck, Commander!<br>

Blue stars glimmer in the inverted sky.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Fritz Rumey：</span><br>
A Lord class... It did appear after all.<br>
The Mirror Sea is changing. The Commander must have succeeded.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Z9：</span><br>
A-are we going to be okay?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Fritz Rumey：</span><br>
We shall see. Fighting is our only choice.<br>
<br>
Countless feelers appear, reaching into the sky as though trying to stitch it and the sea together.<br>
The Eternal Star's barrage of shells blow them to smithereens. The pieces fall back down into the sea like hailstones.<br>
BZZZZT!<br>
There is that odd sound again. Beams of energy are fired at me – but the Mirror Sea's protective barrier blocks them all.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Fritz Rumey：</span><br>
It worked.<br>
<span style="color:#ffc960;">Admiral Hipper META：</span><br>
Hah! Not so tough anymore! Your reign of terror is OVER!<br>
I can finally, finally have my revenge!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Fritz Rumey：</span><br>
Calm down, Hipper. Stick to the plan.<br>
<span style="color:#ffc960;">Admiral Hipper META：</span><br>
Yeah, I know.<br>
Although... that barrier probably won't hold up.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Fritz Rumey：</span><br>
It's sufficient to stall for time. Now we must come up with a countermeasure.<br>
All ships, focus fire on the tentacles! Stop the Star Beast's descent!<br>
<br>
<br>
Sometime later...<br>
I turn my attention to the third control panel in the hall.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Huh. The Wall of Midgard – a protective barrier that combines offense and defense.<br>
(I knew it. This Mirror Sea isn't just here to camouflage the headquarters.)<br>
(Was the offensive part of it never completed? Seems we'll have to rely on its defensive features.)<br>
<br>
Following the operation manual left in the data logs, I issue a set of instructions to the structure via the panel.<br>
My credentials are verified without issue, and the orders are executed one by one.<br>
The Mirror Sea's invisible boundary line starts to warp, creating what appears to be a sort of barrier.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Up next – station four.<br>
<br>
I examine the fourth control panel while the defenses activate.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Okay, logs, logs... This is the energy tower.<br>
Zero damage sustained. I'm amazed, considering how long it's stood there.<br>
Huh... It's called the Tower of Midgard.<br>
(Feels like I've seen that name somewhere before. Could it be linked to my lost memories?)<br>
<br>
I start looking for what secret knowledge the Tower contains.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Damn. The logs and operating access are locked.<br>
Let's see... It can only be accessed once Jörmungandr reaches 40%?<br>
"Jörmungandr"? What is that?<br>
What were the Sirens trying to do here?<br>
<br>
Despite looking around all over, I fail to find anything that could clue me in.<br>
BZZZZT!<br>
Right then, the shockwaves of the Star Beast appearing transmit through the hall.<br>
A star overhead suddenly glows blindingly brightly, its magnified radiance lighting up half of the night sky in the blink of an eye.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
That's quicker than last time! Did it catch on to what I'm doing?<br>
Fine! I'll have to play the hand I've built up, then!<br>
Eternal Star, commence attack!<br>

<br>
Sardegna Empire<br>
Former World Expo Venue<br>
Sakura Empire Pavilion<br>
The tracking magic circle displayed a scene completely unlike where they were before.<br>
It was a busy port, with cargo ships entering and leaving.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Memphis：</span><br>
Hang on... Is this NY City?<br>
Did we just get transported across the globe?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Akagi：</span><br>
No. It's just a vision the magic circle is showing us.<br>
The Commander's ties to the Eagle Union run deep. It's a good place to start looking.<br>
Do you sense anything?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Memphis：</span><br>
No, nothing at all.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Akagi：</span><br>
It's our first attempt, so that's no surprise. Let's try elsewhere.<br>
<br>
Golden light poured down from above, spreading out in all directions from Akagi.<br>
In but a flash, the scene of NY City vanished, like a popped bubble.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Memphis：</span><br>
Where did everything go?!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Akagi：</span><br>
Could you not freak out over every little thing?<br>
I simply excluded the place since our search there was done.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Memphis：</span><br>
......<br>
W-well, on to the next one!<br>
<br>
A turbulent sea. Abnormal weather was visible all throughout.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Memphis：</span><br>
This is the Bermuda Sea!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Akagi：</span><br>
Sense anything now?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Memphis：</span><br>
Nope. Nothing.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Akagi：</span><br>
Next.<br>
<br>
An island at sunset. Lit lamps dotted the landscape.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Memphis：</span><br>
This is our AF base... Isn't this like espionage?<br>
If there are any military deployments here in the future, you'll already...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Akagi：</span><br>
Just focus on locating the Commander, would you?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Memphis：</span><br>
Right, sorry. Still nothing.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Akagi：</span><br>
Ugh. This is going to take forever...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Memphis：</span><br>
...What are you doing?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Akagi：</span><br>
What do you think? I'm speeding things up.<br>
Next place – the entire Pacific.<br>
<br>
The air over the Pacific. Scattered islands stretched as far as the eye could see.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Akagi：</span><br>
Urgh... *cough cough*!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Memphis：</span><br>
Hey! What's wrong? Take it easy!<br>
God, you're pale as death! Are you okay?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Akagi：</span><br>
*cough cough*... Don't mind me!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Memphis：</span><br>
You're literally coughing up blood! Stop and rest!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Akagi：</span><br>
Out of the question! I'm not going to die, okay?<br>
So? Do you sense anything?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Memphis：</span><br>
I do, but it's very faint!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Akagi：</span><br>
Where?! Spit it out!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Memphis：</span><br>
It's not right here! It's further north!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Akagi：</span><br>
North? Surely you don't mean the Arctic?<br>
Next!<br>
<br>
A barren, frozen sea. A storm raged, leaving frost in its path.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Akagi：</span><br>
*pant*... *pant*... And... now?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Memphis：</span><br>
It's getting stronger! There! It's right over there!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Akagi：</span><br>
I'll narrow the range! Next!<br>
<br>
A realm of deep blue. Giant cubes rested silently in the water, like ice cubes.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Memphis：</span><br>
Where are we?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Akagi：</span><br>
I didn't change the location, I just narrowed the range... We're probably under the surface.<br>
What is this? An underwater Mirror Sea?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Memphis：</span><br>
Oh, the feeling got even stronger!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Akagi：</span><br>
This has to be the place. Next!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Memphis：</span><br>
Did... Did the colors change?<br>
And what in the world is that light?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Akagi：</span><br>
Some sort of force is fighting the magic circle...<br>
Hah... Let's see what's underneath you!<br>
Open... now!<br>
I said OPEN!<br>
Open, open, open! OPEN!<br>
<br>
A starlit battlefield. Flames blazed with ceaseless fury.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Memphis：</span><br>
The feeling is even stronger now! The Commander is very close!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Akagi：</span><br>
Yes! Commander!<br>
<br>
A classroom. Warm sunlight shone upon the desks and chairs.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Memphis：</span><br>
What the...?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Akagi：</span><br>
A... classroom?<br>
{{折叠面板|内容结束}}

{{折叠面板|标题=United as One|选项=24|主框=1|样式=primary|展开=是}}
<br>
When the light faded, I found myself back in the bright classroom.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Madam M：</span><br>
Alas, the energy tower just couldn't take it. So much for your plan.<br>
<br>
Madam M was waiting for me, as usual.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
You can say that again. I genuinely thought it was going to work at first.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Madam M：</span><br>
"You cannot defeat it. Not as you are now, anyway."<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
The thing is, I'm a bit of a sore loser. Let me keep banging my head against it for a while.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Madam M：</span><br>
What will you do next?<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
First, I'll need you to join me in some spirited debate.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Madam M：</span><br>
Sure. I don't see why not.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
The Star Beast has only appeared four times, and it's been decades since the last time.<br>
I just happened to end up in that world a week before it appeared. Now, I can accept this much.<br>
But it came down earlier this time.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Madam M：</span><br>
And why do you think that is?<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
It's because the Siren facility changed as a result of the Resistance's... no, my actions.<br>
Even back during the recovery operation at the Silberstern, the enemy was moving as an organized unit.<br>
I think the Star Beast was already onto us by that point.<br>
Repairing the Eternal Stars and activating the Wall of Midgard hastened its arrival.<br>
With every move and advancement we made, the Star Beast became warier.<br>
Just what is Jörmungandr?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Madam M：</span><br>
You're awfully sharp. The Star Beast is a creation of the Experimental Framework, and Jörmungandr is that which would destroy the beast.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
You mean Observer...Then is this related to the X, too?<br>
But the Star Beast is nothing like the X I remember.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Madam M：</span><br>
What you call extradimensionals are simply material manifestations of the X's power.<br>
While they are connected to the X, yes, they are not the X's true form.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
I see... That doesn't make the danger any less real, though.<br>
If the X have started to wiggle their way into a test site, why don't you Arbiters do anything about it?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Madam M：</span><br>
Oh? What makes you so convinced that I'm so close to the Arbiters?<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Not just close to them, Madam M.<br>
You're an Arbiter yourself... The Magician!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Madam M：</span><br>
Heehee. Really... If I was The Magician, then why would I be here trying to help you through this?<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
.........<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Madam M：</span><br>
And if you think the Siren facility is what attracted the Star Beast, then go ahead and try destroying the energy tower this time.<br>
After all, you're in no danger if it never comes.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Not gonna work.<br>
It's only human to seek progress. Someday, the Star Beast will feel threatened again, and it will return.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Madam M：</span><br>
Only in the distant future. You won't have to worry about it in your lifetime. Isn't that enough of a win?<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Then the world ultimately meets the same fate as I witnessed.<br>
The Sirens already failed the second time it came. We can't be certain that we'll be able to stand up to it whenever it returns.<br>
As far as I'm concerned, this is our final opportunity to be rid of it.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Madam M：</span><br>
I've said this several times now. "You cannot defeat it. Not as you are now, anyway."<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
And you're right. Not as I am now.<br>
But what about the past me? Or the future me?<br>
<br>
The handkerchief in my chest pocket begins to glow. My friends' feelings seem to flow out of it.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
So this is why you took away my memories.<br>
Don't presume that you can control me forever, Magician.<br>
<br>
Bright light bursts from the handkerchief, engulfing the entire classroom.<br>
When it subsides, I find that two very familiar friends have joined us in here.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">孟菲斯&{namecode:91:赤城}：</span><br>
Commander?!<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Memphis... and Akagi?!<br>
<br>
The haze in my mind clears. Memories of test site beta and the people of the Azur Lane come rushing back.<br>
Unsealed memories flood my mind, washing away the dark clouds that had obscured the faces of my friends.<br>
My mind works at speeds I've never experienced.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
(Energy Cubes, Wisdom Cubes, the meteorite sample, the Watatsumi...)<br>
(Obsession, illusions, souls, rebirth...)<br>
(Is that it?!)<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Memphis：</span><br>
Finally, we found you! Are you okay, Commander?!<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
I'm safe enough here. How in the world did you two find me?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Akagi：</span><br>
It's all thanks to the tracking magical circle Yamato prepared.<br>
<br>
The girls recounted what had happened after the banquet.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
A whole lot has happened without me, huh? We have a lot to thank Yamato for.<br>
And I need to thank the two of you, of course.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Memphis：</span><br>
Not at all. It was necessary.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Akagi：</span><br>
Are you ready to go back, Commander?<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Not yet. I have unfinished business here.<br>
But don't you worry. Thanks to you two coming, I've caught a glimpse of victory. I'll make my triumphant return to our world soon.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Akagi：</span><br>
Victory? Triumph? Commander, what are you going on about?<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Let's skip the details for now. Akagi, can you tell me how to use the Watatsumi?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Akagi：</span><br>
But you already put yourself into such danger to rescue me... You must take better care of yourself!<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
I know that. We promised to travel together, after all.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Akagi：</span><br>
Commander...<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
There's no time. Can you give me the quick explanation?<br>
<br>
She's flustered for a moment, but she calms herself and teaches me how to use the Watatsumi.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
(So thoughts and prayers are integral to the process... No wonder she succeeded in reviving Amagi.)<br>
Understood. Thank you.<br>
Staying in the magic circle must be bad for you. You two should go back!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Akagi：</span><br>
Absolutely not. If we sever our connection to you now, we may never be able to find you again.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Oh... Then I'm just going to need you to wait a little longer for me.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Memphis：</span><br>
I don't know what's going on here, but good luck, Commander. We're not going home without you!<br>
<br>
After another flash of light, Memphis and Akagi disappeared as if they were never here in the first place.<br>
Meanwhile, Madam M sits on a desk and leans in close, gazing into my eyes from mere inches away.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Madam M：</span><br>
Do you remember everything now?<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Yeah. Everything.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Madam M：</span><br>
What sweet friends you have. They've chased you to the ends of the earth and beyond.<br>
You and those girls are practically inseparable, aren't you?<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Naturally.<br>
Did you not know that? Or did you just pretend not to notice the handkerchief?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Madam M：</span><br>
Oh, I wonder. Either way, it's true that I'm impressed.<br>
But that's enough discussion. It's time for you to choose.<br>
Do you want to continue?<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
I do.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Madam M：</span><br>
You sound confident.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
I'm not going to solve my problems by running from them.<br>
Fleeing might buy you time, but you have to face your fears sooner or later.<br>
I won't give up as long as I'm still standing.<br>
Besides, I've come up with a strategy that just might work.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Madam M：</span><br>
Heehee. I'm excited to see you try.<br>

<br>
T=T-8<br>
Staring through the porthole of the mass-produced ship, I see the shipgirls fighting outside.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
(I'm back again.)<br>
(If we don't activate the Wall of Midgard, then it should take five more hours for the Star Beast to appear.)<br>
(I have to use that time to execute my plan!)<br>
<br>
Looking up, I see Rumey's recon aircraft in the air. The news about Hipper will reach us any second now.<br>
I convince her the Star Beast is coming and have her contact Hipper.<br>
But what I'm about to do is the real turning point.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Fritz Rumey：</span><br>
You want to use mineralized energy to bolster our forces?<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
That's right. Is this unprecedented in your world?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Fritz Rumey：</span><br>
As far as I know, it's never been done... No, wait.<br>
While I've never heard of mineralized energy being used to directly empower combat capabilities or output...<br>
When our civilization flourished, there were portable rigging repair devices made from that material.<br>
As the name implies, shipgirls could use them to repair their rigging in battle – but it also worked, albeit to a lesser effect, on their bodies and hulls.<br>
While it is indirect, I think it's apt to call that an improvement to your combat force.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
It worked on hulls, too? Does that include hulls with META corrosion?<br>
Do any of them still exist today?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Fritz Rumey：</span><br>
No. We happened upon a batch long ago, but they've been long used up by now.<br>
As for whether they can cure META corrosion, I don't know.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Really... That's a shame.<br>
(But they can repair rigging, flesh, and hull alike? That's useful information.)<br>
(When I get home, I'll have to research that at the Sea of Stars.)<br>
(If mineralized energy can directly affect hulls, then it may be related to the Watatsumi... To Wisdom Cubes.)<br>
Could I see some of this mineralized energy for myself?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Fritz Rumey：</span><br>
Out of the question, I'm afraid. It's still contaminated, but you can look after they're purged.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Can you do that right away?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Fritz Rumey：</span><br>
Yes. There is a repaired radiation purger in the energy tower at HQ.<br>
If you want it updated now, I don't mind pushing that through...<br>
But it'll take half a month at minimum. I doubt we'll have it done in time to fight that Star Beast, if you're right about it.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
I don't need it updated – I just want the mineralized energy.<br>
It'll help in the upcoming battle.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Fritz Rumey：</span><br>
...Do you really know a way to make shipgirls stronger with mineralized energy?<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Something like that. I'll explain later.<br>
For now, I need you to divide the fleet in two. One half will take the mineralized energy back to HQ, and the other half will find Hipper and have her come meet us.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Fritz Rumey：</span><br>
Understood. Let's pray that your plan works out.<br>
{{折叠面板|内容结束}}

{{折叠面板|标题=Emotion Given Form|选项=26|主框=1|样式=primary|展开=是}}
<br>
Two hours later...<br>
The radiation purger worked, and we managed to purify a batch of mineralized energy.<br>
We left cleaning up the enemy force to our allies while Rumey, Duisburg, and Hipper accompanied me to the energy tower.<br>
<span style="color:#ffc960;">Admiral Hipper META：</span><br>
So this stuff is supposed to make me stronger?<br>
Is this a joke, or what?<br>
<br>
Unsurprisingly, Hipper is suspicious at best.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
With a little more work...<br>
<br>
By drawing out the shared attributes between mineralized energy and the Watatsumi, and by imbuing emotion into the result, it can be turned into an item that affects a shipgirl's hull and boosts her firepower.<br>
Instead of trying to explain such a high-level concept, however, I opt to show rather than tell.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
(Imbuing emotions... In other words, I should focus on how much I care about Hipper.)<br>
<br>
Recalling the method that Akagi taught me, I raise the mineral fragment and touch it to my forehead.<br>
My mind seems to collapse, and I realize that I'm somewhere else.<br>
The void stretches on endlessly in all directions. Time and orientation mean nothing here.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Why does this feel... nostalgic?<br>
Is this where I first met Rodney META?<br>
Ah, damn it!<br>
<br>
My hazy mind starts melting, assimilating into the never-ending void.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Wait!<br>
<br>
As my consciousness starts to fade, I hear the familiar sound of wind chimes.<br>
<span style="color:#5cffc0;">Admiral Hipper：</span><br>
Ugh, why do you keep asking me what gifts I'd like?<br>
Are you stupid?!<br>
Hmph! Fine, but I'll only tell you just this once!<br>
You idiot!<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
(What was that?)<br>
<br>
I witness a strange scene, but it quickly slips from my memories.<br>
I look up in confusion. Everyone around me is just as surprised.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
......<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Duisburg：</span><br>
Commander... You did it that easily?!<br>
No special equipment, no special treatment... Just by touching it to your forehead, you changed the mineralized energy into something else!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Fritz Rumey：</span><br>
Unscientific.<br>
<span style="color:#ffc960;">Admiral Hipper META：</span><br>
Visitor from the beyond, indeed. You're something special.<br>
<br>
Their comments make me realize that the mineral in my hand has turned into a small box.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
(Giving emotions material form... Is that the Watatsumi's true power?)<br>
(I don't know if this works like Wisdom Cubes, but either way, it looks like it worked.)<br>
(But is this box what I think it is?)<br>
Hipper, I want you to have this.<br>
<span style="color:#ffc960;">Admiral Hipper META：</span><br>
This is supposed to make me stronger? What's in this thing?<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
The unknown. That's exactly why it can give you the power known as hope.<br>
Not knowing the future is what gives us hope. We get to decide our destiny, not others.<br>
We're not done yet. And neither is this world.<br>
With this power, we'll seize victory and find a future full of hope.<br>
<span style="color:#ffc960;">Admiral Hipper META：</span><br>
...Still not getting what you're going for here.<br>
Well, it is a gift. Thanks. I guess.<br>
<br>
Rumey and I worked together to prepare HQ's defenses as fast as humanly possible.<br>
After that, I went to the Eternal Star and used the console to switch the Mirror Sea to defense mode.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
The Star Beast is coming. Let's see how it can handle us this time!<br>
{{折叠面板|内容结束}}

{{折叠面板|标题=Side by Side|选项=27|主框=1|样式=primary|展开=是}}
<br>
The waters of the Mirror Sea begin to shift.<br>
Its normally invisible boundary distorts, manifesting something like a barrier.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Duisburg：</span><br>
I had no idea the Mirror Sea had such a hidden function... Another miracle wrought by the Commander.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Z52：</span><br>
Things are going surprisingly well so far!<br>
The Commander's predictions of enemy numbers and positioning were spot-on.<br>
It's almost like you can see the future! Frankly, it's kinda creepy...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Z11：</span><br>
I'm just glad the Commander's on our side.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Z9：</span><br>
Everything is going exactly the way you said... Then that must mean...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Fritz Rumey：</span><br>
The Star Beast will appear. Steel yourselves.<br>
<br>
Our counteroffensive went smoothly. The enemy markers on the monitor vanished one after the next, and victory seemed but a shot away.<br>
But right at that moment, a shocking development occurred.<br>
A star overhead suddenly glows blindingly brightly, its magnified radiance lighting up half of the night sky in the blink of an eye.<br>
The white heavens become diffused with innumerable blue lights that flicker in and out of existence. It's like someone has inverted the colors of the night.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Fritz Rumey：</span><br>
A Lord class... It did appear after all.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Z9：</span><br>
A-are we going to be okay?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Fritz Rumey：</span><br>
We shall see. Fighting is our only choice.<br>
<br>
Strange noises come in waves, seemingly shaking all the world through to our very souls.<br>
But the force is blocked by the Wall of Midgard, doing little more than causing some ripples on the barrier.<br>
Countless feelers appear, reaching into the sky as though trying to stitch it and the sea together.<br>
The Eternal Star's barrage of shells blow them to smithereens. The pieces fall back down into the sea like hailstones.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
(So far, so good. But this is where the battle truly begins.)<br>
Hipper, are you ready?<br>
<span style="color:#ffc960;">Admiral Hipper META：</span><br>
I've been waiting for this for a long time! Let me at it!<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Everyone, focus your attacks on the Lord class!<br>
<br>
KABOOOOM!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Fritz Rumey：</span><br>
Follow my lead! We will synchronize our strikes!<br>
Cover Hipper and secure a route to victory!<br>
<br>
<br>
KABOOOOM!<br>
The cannon fire vanished like fireflies in the black, starry sky.<br>

<br>
BZZZZT!<br>
When she leaves the safety of the barrier, the Star Beast launches an attack.<br>
However, the crushing noise is erased by soft light.<br>
<span style="color:#5cffc0;">Prinz Eugen：</span><br>
Bullying poor Hipper? Not on my watch.<br>
<span style="color:#5cffc0;">Blücher：</span><br>
Heheh☆ Hipper! Let's punish this big lug together!<br>
<br>
Two people thought long lost appear on the scene.<br>
The girls on Hipper's flanks point their guns in the same direction.<br>
<span style="color:#ffc960;">Admiral Hipper META：</span><br>
Eugen, Blücher... Shouldn't the two of you be...<br>
No way. This isn't real...<br>
Are you ghosts? Hallucinations? Or...?<br>
<span style="color:#5cffc0;">Blücher：</span><br>
Geez~ Settle down, Sis!<br>
You're not wrong, but that doesn't mean you're right!<br>
Well, uh, maybe you are actually wrong...<br>
Aargh, I don't understand it well enough to explain!<br>
Eugen, help me out here!<br>
<span style="color:#5cffc0;">Prinz Eugen：</span><br>
Basically, your wishes took form as us.<br>
You wished to make a new future for the Admiral Hipper class. How could we let you do it alone?<br>
<span style="color:#ffc960;">Admiral Hipper META：</span><br>
Is it... really you?<br>
<span style="color:#5cffc0;">Prinz Eugen：</span><br>
Yeah, we're back. Only for a while, though.<br>
<span style="color:#5cffc0;">Blücher：</span><br>

<span style="color:#5cffc0;">Prinz Eugen：</span><br>

<span style="color:#5cffc0;">Blücher：</span><br>
Hey, you big lug! I'm gonna beat the tar outta you!<br>
<span style="color:#ffc960;">Admiral Hipper META：</span><br>
Wait! Eugen, Blücher! Get back in the barrier!<br>
You two can't take that thing on alone!<br>
<span style="color:#5cffc0;">Prinz Eugen：</span><br>
Don't worry about us. We have each other.<br>
<span style="color:#5cffc0;">Blücher：</span><br>
Yeah! Let's win this together!<br>
<br>
KABOOOOM!<br>
<br>
<br>
That which I'd seen destroy the world before was halted by a gentler force, which weakened it more with every passing second.<br>
Silence took over the battlefield, engulfing all.<br>
Ages seemed to pass in this moment.<br>
When the light disappeared, so too did the Star Beast.<br>
<span style="color:#ffc960;">Admiral Hipper META：</span><br>
Did we... win?<br>
<span style="color:#5cffc0;">Prinz Eugen：</span><br>
It was a perfect victory.<br>
<span style="color:#5cffc0;">Blücher：</span><br>
Heheh☆ Our bond can beat anything!<br>
<span style="color:#ffc960;">Admiral Hipper META：</span><br>
I swear, I must be dreaming... We really, really won?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Fritz Rumey：</span><br>
Blücher? Eugen?! Have you come back to life somehow?!<br>
<span style="color:#5cffc0;">Prinz Eugen：</span><br>
It's been a while, Rumey. Who knew you'd become the leader of the Resistance?<br>
Sorry, but we haven't. Consider us just a fleeting illusion born from hopes and dreams.<br>
<span style="color:#ffc960;">Admiral Hipper META：</span><br>
A fleeting illusion... Does that mean you're leaving me?!<br>
<span style="color:#5cffc0;">Prinz Eugen：</span><br>
The future you dreamed of is reality now. Our job here is done.<br>
<span style="color:#ffc960;">Admiral Hipper META：</span><br>
Oh... Well, knowing that you two live on in this state is still a relief.<br>
When can I see you again?<br>
<span style="color:#5cffc0;">Prinz Eugen：</span><br>
Take care of yourself and keep getting stronger, and maybe then...<br>
You might just be able to find us... Or you might even realize that we've been with you all along.<br>
<span style="color:#ffc960;">Admiral Hipper META：</span><br>
Doesn't make much sense to me. But okay... I'll take care of myself. I'll get stronger. And someday, I will find you two!<br>
<span style="color:#5cffc0;">Blücher：</span><br>
We're cheering you on, Hipper!<br>
<span style="color:#5cffc0;">Prinz Eugen：</span><br>
Sure are. And keep an eye on your nutrition, got it?<br>
<span style="color:#ffc960;">Admiral Hipper META：</span><br>
You don't have to tell me that!<br>
<br>
A sea breeze blows through, and Prinz Eugen and Blücher begin to fade.<br>
<span style="color:#5cffc0;">Prinz Eugen：</span><br>
It's time for us to go... Thank you all for taking such good care of our sister. Keep her safe for us.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Fritz Rumey：</span><br>
No worries there, Eugen. We will win this war.<br>
<span style="color:#5cffc0;">Prinz Eugen：</span><br>
I believe you.<br>
<br>
SHUFFLE...<br>
There's the sound of shuffling cards again. But it's softer and slower, as if giving me time to prepare before I'm taken away.<br>
It's time to say goodbye.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Everyone, we've achieved a great victory today.<br>
From now on, the Star Beast is no longer a sword hanging over the world – it's a symbol of victory and hope.<br>
Congratulations, Fritz Rumey. Your counteroperation has taken a great leap forward.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Fritz Rumey：</span><br>
Commander... Thank you.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Duisburg：</span><br>
You're not leaving too, are you?!<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
...I am.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Duisburg：</span><br>
Will we ever see you again?<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Of course. I'm certain of it.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Fritz Rumey：</span><br>
You will forever be the Commander of the Iron Blood Resistance. Take care of yourself.<br>
<span style="color:#5cffc0;">Prinz Eugen：</span><br>
Heheh... Commander.<br>
Long time no see... Or perhaps should I say, "I'll see you soon."<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
(What?!)<br>

<br>
After the light faded, the headquarters, Eternal Stars, and Star Beast alike were all gone.<br>
I was slumped over a classroom desk, bathed in warm sunlight. When I sat up, it felt as if all that had happened was a dream.<br>
But I know very well that all I'd experienced was real. Eugen's words are still fresh in my mind.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
(Long time no see. See you soon.)<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Madam M：</span><br>
Thinking about something? Or just feeling strange now that you didn't have to die this time?<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
I'm thinking about what Eugen's phantom said to me as I left.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Madam M：</span><br>
Who cares? Why bother agonizing over something if she doesn't find it important enough to tell you directly?<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
You know something, don't you?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Madam M：</span><br>
Let's get back to talking about you.<br>
Your little search has finally come to an end. Are you satisfied?<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
I'd call it a happy ending.<br>
What about you? What have you been after all this time?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Madam M：</span><br>
There's one thing I'd like to know.<br>
...Did isolating you from your memories of test site beta make it easier to explore who you are and what you've experienced?<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
I can't deny that. Pieces of the puzzle came together like never before. I remembered some things, too.<br>
But...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Madam M：</span><br>
You just don't like my method.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Yeah, I really don't. I can overlook your manipulation of me to an extent, but I draw the line at manipulating my friends' memories.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Madam M：</span><br>
Really? Even if some of your own memories in test site beta are falsehoods?<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Doesn't matter. My memories are from test site beta – that's what matters.<br>
No matter what came before, that's where I belong.<br>
It's not an easily discarded test site to me. It's my home. Or one of them, at least.<br>
To be honest, I wouldn't have been able to get out of this if not for my bonds with my bonds.<br>
The answer I gave is no doubt different from the one you intended, right?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Madam M：</span><br>
Exactly. I planned to have you choose a different route.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Having me complete Jörmungandr, I presume.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Madam M：</span><br>
Why do you think so?<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
The Sirens' role is the key. I think your ultimate goal here was to make me change my opinion on them.<br>
You wanted me to fail over and over until I was willing to cooperate with the Antiochus... or you'd convince me to take a similar deal.<br>
If I accepted, you'd tell me how to complete Jörmungandr and provide the resources. With that, we'd defeat the Star Beast...<br>
...And with that, I would have a new impression of the Sirens – that they're my ally. Isn't that right?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Madam M：</span><br>
It means nothing now. You chose a different path, after all.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Magician... You don't remember me, do you?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Madam M：</span><br>
Why do you ask?<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
You've been trying to teach me things, though in a roundabout way. But you've kept so silent about my true identity.<br>
While I searched, you wanted to observe me and try to figure out who I am. Am I wrong?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Madam M：</span><br>
Heehee. Perhaps. Or did I simply manipulate you into presuming as such?<br>
Either way, I understand your thoughts now.<br>
I won't toy with your memories anymore. I'll promise you that, if nothing else.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
No more suddenly yanking me out of my world?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Madam M：</span><br>
Hmm... Depends on my mood, I'm afraid.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Then promise me that you won't interfere with their world anymore. I want to be able to see them again.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Madam M：</span><br>
Very well.<br>
We don't have much time left, so let's do something special.<br>
<br>
Suddenly, we're inside some kind of fortune-telling tent.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Madam M：</span><br>
Pick three cards, if you'd please.<br>
<br>
On the purple tablecloth is a deck of tarot cards spread face-down.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Are we doing divination now?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Madam M：</span><br>
Past, present, future. Three cards, please.<br>
Go on.<br>
<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项1：(Pick a first card.)</span>'''''<br>
Your first card is The Star, reversed.<br>
<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项1：(Pick a second card.)</span>'''''<br>
The Moon, upright.<br>
<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项1：(Pick a third card.)</span>'''''<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Madam M：</span><br>
Your third... Well, isn't this interesting?<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
How so?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Madam M：</span><br>
I'm not telling yet. I'd much rather keep you in suspense.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Yet another secret, huh?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Madam M：</span><br>
I only let you choose. I never said I'd share the result, now, did I?<br>
Besides, what good is knowing the future if it means limiting your options?<br>
Heehee. This has been a lot of fun.<br>
I look forward to meeting you again, Commander.<br>

I was finally reunited with my friends in the magic circle, surrounded by a kaleidoscope of butterflies.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">孟菲斯&{namecode:91:赤城}：</span><br>
Commander!<br>
- You're finally home! - I've been waiting for you!<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Ahem... Sorry for the long wait. It's over now.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Memphis：</span><br>
It hasn't been that long.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Akagi：</span><br>
We're honestly surprised how fast you were. Have you already finished everything you needed to do?<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
...Fast?<br>
How much time has passed since we last talked?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Akagi：</span><br>
Less than three minutes.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
(Time passed at a different speed there?)<br>
(...Did Madam M do that out of consideration for these two?)<br>
(I had no idea one of the Arbiters could do that.)<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Memphis：</span><br>
Commander? You just froze up... Did you forget something you needed to do?<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
No, no. I'm fine.<br>
I'm fed up with this little business trip. Let's go home and leave the discussion for another time.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Memphis：</span><br>
Yes, let's!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Akagi：</span><br>
I'd be happy to accompany you, Commander.<br>

Time: Unknown<br>
Location: Unknown<br>
For several days now, Helena has gazed endlessly at the panel before her and worked without pause.<br>
Only one system hour remained until she would find test site beta's coordinates.<br>
She had captured the core device of the phantom test site three system hours prior.<br>
<span style="color:#ffc960;">Helena META：</span><br>
It's almost going too smoothly...<br>
Magician must have set a trap. That much is clear from the fact that Miss D's appearance in test site beta isn't kept confidential.<br>
Besides, the Tower and Camelot need to maintain a constant connection for this to work...<br>
This would be the perfect time for her to launch an attack, and yet...<br>
Why isn't she doing anything?<br>
Was this the whole point? Just delaying me for a few days, and nothing else?<br>
<br>
BEEP BEEP!<br>
Right on cue, the situation took a turn for the worse.<br>
A strong impact came from seemingly all directions. The bait that Helena had prepared was destroyed in the blink of an eye.<br>
<span style="color:#ffc960;">Helena META：</span><br>
Is that all?<br>
No... She was never after the Tower. She wanted to disrupt time-space and delay my contact with test site beta!<br>
Observer, are you done over there?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Observer ：</span><br>
I'm still selecting a location for the mainframe. How fast do you think I am?<br>
<span style="color:#ffc960;">Helena META：</span><br>
I see. Then put that on hold for now.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Observer ：</span><br>
...You're not about to tell me to go fight Magician, are you?<br>
Me? Fight an Arbiter? You must be kidding.<br>
<span style="color:#ffc960;">Helena META：</span><br>
Shut down and go into hiding at once – before she can seize control and take us unawares.<br>
Otherwise, I'll be forced to dispose of you.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Observer ：</span><br>
Ugh... Fine, I'm out of here.<br>

<br>
My disappearance came to be known as the Day the Stars Faded.<br>
For a few days after, I stayed in the Sakuran pavilion due to safety concerns.<br>
During my stay, I submitted my report on the incident, contacted my allies across the world, and confirmed that everything was back to normal.<br>
After that, I contacted Elizabeth on an encrypted line and learned that the Ashes' reinforcements had never come to the NA Ocean Singularity.<br>
She also informed me of the situation with test site beta and how the META Helena was hard at work on it.<br>
I still couldn't reach Helena herself, and Camelot had lost contact with her.<br>
Given what I knew so far, there was no doubt that she and Madam M – The Magician – were in the midst of a fierce battle.<br>
I'd have had no way of intervening, and knowing their power, it seemed unlikely that either of them would come out seriously hurt.<br>
All I could do was pray that their battle ended soon.<br>
And finally, it was time for Akagi to return to the Sakura Empire.<br>
Sardegna Empire<br>
Former World Expo Venue<br>
Sakura Empire Pavilion<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Akagi：</span><br>
You may leave me here, Commander.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
This is a big moment for you. I don't mind coming with you if it makes it easier.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Akagi：</span><br>
You'd... really come with me?<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Of course. I have two or three days free, and I can make more time if I need to.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Akagi：</span><br>
You mustn't. This is an internal matter, so it must be decided by my people.<br>
If you were there, they may be too kind to me. I won't get the punishment I deserve.<br>
Besides... Lady Nagato, Musashi, Mikasa – they're all working as a united front now.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
But...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Akagi：</span><br>
I'll be fine. I'm prepared for whatever may come.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Amagi(CV)：</span><br>
Don't worry, Commander. I'll be there as well.<br>
I've been away from home for a long time, but I believe I still have friends who will show deference to me.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Akagi：</span><br>
I haven't forgotten our promise to travel together.<br>
When this is all over, Commander... I'll be waiting for you. In the Sakura Empire.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Thanks, Akagi.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Amagi(CV)：</span><br>
Commander. Friends. The Sakuran fleet will hereby take our leave.<br>
I look forward to seeing you all again.<br>
<br>
Thus, the Sakura Empire fleet departs.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Memphis：</span><br>
There they go...<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Getting a little sentimental?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Memphis：</span><br>
She risked her life alongside us.<br>
At first, I found her a little extreme... Now that we've spoken, though, I think differently of her.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
There's more to Akagi than her mistakes. I hope she's able to atone for her past actions.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Memphis：</span><br>
Goodness. Don't you think you should worry about yourself first?<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Hm?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Memphis：</span><br>
Don't go telling people you can make all the time in the world for them!<br>
Ugh, get your priorities straight!<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Oh... You mean the reformation?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Memphis：</span><br>
Yes, that is what I mean! The reformation is back on the table thanks to all of this, and it's looking better than ever!<br>
Siren forces are more disorganized now, too, with the loss of the mainframe... You have endless work to do, you know!<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
.........<br>
The winds of change are coming to the Azur Lane...<br>
<br>
I have to think about the test site, too.<br>
Now that the Experimental Framework is gone, should the truth be publicized?<br>
How will the future shake out without the Sirens' intervention?<br>
Problems that I'd thought "future me" would have to deal with are piling up in front of me right now.<br>
The Sirens have brought war and destruction, but at the same time, they've pushed us to solve the X problem.<br>
With their mainframe gone, that pressure is gone.<br>
What of the people who don't know about the X? They're relieved by the reduced Siren threat, but how will they feel?<br>
Does the Azur Lane truly have a reason to exist anymore?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Memphis：</span><br>
We've been so focused on defeating the Sirens all this time.<br>
But now that the Experimental Framework is gone... It doesn't really feel like we've won.<br>
<br>
There are still Sirens who threaten the safety of this world.<br>
The Arbiters watching us. The mysterious Observer Zero.<br>
As long as their experiments continue – as long as we suffer as their guinea pigs – peace with the Sirens is impossible.<br>
What's more, our true threat still lurks in the dark. The risk of it encroaching upon our world is ever-present.<br>
This is no time to sit on our laurels.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Memphis：</span><br>
We can't tell all the world everything about our enemy...<br>
They'll be celebrating this false victory and fighting over the spoils for a time to come...<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
There's nothing we can do about it. We just have to protect the world.<br>
The Azur Lane, Sirens, and our test site...<br>
I suppose I won't have much free time, after all.<br>
Right. I should return your handkerchief. It turned out to be a big help.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Memphis：</span><br>
Oh... That's okay! It's a gift!<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
I thought it was your favorite?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Memphis：</span><br>
Don't worry about it!<br>
If you really want to thank me, then get me a new one.<br>
Also... You said you're free for the next two days? Why don't we all go out together?<br>
I can't wait to see a Sardegnian holiday!<br>

Through the city, I walk.<br>
Buildings line the streets.<br>
Upon the earth, I walk.<br>
Mountains and rivers intertwine.<br>
Atop the seas, I walk.<br>
Coastlines stretch on eternal.<br>
In the skies, I walk.<br>
The sun dyes the world white.<br>
In purest white, I walk.<br>
Through heaven, I walk.<br>
Upon me, your eyes gaze.<br>
On my ears, songs of adoration echo.<br>
