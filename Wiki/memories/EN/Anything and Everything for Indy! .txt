<br>
Chapter 1 - Let's Have a Week of Indy!<br>
Port - Office<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Portland：</span><br>
Well, Commander? I think it's a brilliant idea!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Indianapolis：</span><br>
Not again, sis... You're dumping stuff on people again.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Portland：</span><br>
I can't help it! My head is always brimming with ideas thanks to how cute you are!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Indianapolis：</span><br>
Okay, well, what did you come up with this time?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Portland：</span><br>
Mass-producible Indy merch! Collectible photos! Keychains! Pillowcase covers! And much more!<br>
<br>
My desk is buried beneath giant stacks of documents, none of which go more than one sentence without mentioning Indianapolis.<br>
I've rejected Portland's proposals over and over, but each and every day she comes back and tries again to convince me.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Indianapolis：</span><br>
Please, not a pillowcase cover... That's too much.<br>
<br>
Indianapolis doesn't like the idea of being commercialized, but her concerns don't seem to weigh much on Portland's conscience.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Portland：</span><br>
But why not?! All I want is to maximize your appeal to the widest audience possible!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Indianapolis：</span><br>
I appreciate the sentiment, but this is way over the line...<br>
I want to make more friends, and while this would introduce me to new people, I just...<br>
I don't think it's the best way to do it.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Portland：</span><br>
Aha! Did you hear that, Commander?! Indy wants to make more friends!<br>
That gives me an idea! I'll preach about Indy until more faithful followers join our ranks!<br>
We'll have a whole Week of Indy! It's the perfect plan!<br>
<br>
Portland's eyes gleam with enthusiasm. I remain skeptical of her plan, however.<br>
Having said that... if it does work, and the two of them make new friends in the end, then that's great. And so, I give her the go-ahead.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Indianapolis：</span><br>
Um, Commander... If this gets out of control, you have to tell my sis to stop, okay?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Portland：</span><br>
It won't get out of control! Just have some faith in me!<br>
My plan is gonna make you some new friends, I guarantee it!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Indianapolis：</span><br>
That's not the part I have my doubts about...<br>

<br>
Chapter 2 - Clash of Sisters<br>
Port - Academy Schoolyard<br>
The Week of Indy has officially started.<br>
And with it, Portland's plan of converting others into the "Church of Indy."<br>
Her first potential convertees: other people who adore their sisters.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Deutschland：</span><br>
So, you decided to come to me first, is that it?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Portland：</span><br>
That's right! You're your little sister's biggest fan too, aren't you? I figured you'd get where I'm coming from.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Deutschland：</span><br>
...You could say that. My dear Spee means the world to me.<br>
It is true I adore my little sister, but that's all we have in common. Furthermore...<br>
You're asking me to become a fan of *your* little sister. Now why would I do that?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Portland：</span><br>
Why? Isn't it pretty obvious? My Indy's cuter than your Spee!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Deutschland：</span><br>
How dare you! Hey, lowly animal, I demand you let me blast this little worm to kingdom come!<br>
<br>
Deutschland doesn't seem to be joking. I order her to calm down and lower her cannons.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Deutschland：</span><br>
Hmph! One day, one way or another, you will pay for your slander!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Portland：</span><br>
Gosh, Deutschland gets really scary when she's angry...<br>
Oh, that reminds me... When Indy's scared, she gets all teary-eyed.<br>
And now that I think about it, she looks adorable that way! Like a cute puppy that deserves a hug!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Deutschland：</span><br>
Lowly animal, what's wrong with your secretary? Do you have some sort of aura that attracts weirdos?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Portland：</span><br>
Sorry, I lost my train of thought for a minute there.<br>
What I was gonna say is: imagine Spee, all teary-eyed. Doesn't the thought of that just make you wanna hug her?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Deutschland：</span><br>
W-well... yes. But I would never let Spee cry. And I'd send anyone who would make her weep to a watery grave before they can even try.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Portland：</span><br>
Yeah, I guess so... If anyone tried to do the same to my little Indy, they would regret it big-time.<br>
But now we're back at square one... How am I supposed to convert you to the Church of Indy?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Deutschland：</span><br>
You aren't. What made you think I want to revere someone else's little sister in the first place?<br>
You're wasting your own time, and more importantly, mine. You too, lowly animal! Expect some punishment later.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Portland：</span><br>
No, wait, don't leave! I'm not done preaching yet! Come baaaack!<br>
<br>
It seems like all we achieved here was make Deutschland angry...<br>

Chapter 3 - Like Two Peas in a Pod<br>
Port - Classroom<br>
The Week of Indy continues. Portland is not giving up so easily.<br>
She's trying again with a slightly different approach. Perhaps she will have better luck this time.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Dorsetshire：</span><br>
Goodness, yes, I totally understand you! It's so amazing to have a sister like mine!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Portland：</span><br>
I knooow, right? It's like, I literally never tire of talking about how great Indy is!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Dorsetshire：</span><br>
You said it! Even if I were to talk nonstop for three whole days, I wouldn't be able to express even 5% of Norfolk's greatness!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Portland：</span><br>
Same with Indy! We need more than words to convey our sisters's splendor! That's why I've been trying to get the Commander to agree to mass-producing Indy goods.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Dorsetshire：</span><br>
Ahh, making things in her image, eh? That's an ingenious idea! I'd love figurines of my dear Norfolk.<br>
<br>
I'm honestly surprised. These two are almost on the exact same wavelength.<br>
Keyword: almost. Listening a little closer, I realize that...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Portland：</span><br>
And then there's the time Indy hugged me in her sleep! My gosh, I just about...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Dorsetshire：</span><br>
Norfolk is still a little afraid of the dark, so sometimes I need to...<br>
<br>
...Both of them are only talking about their own sister and not really listening to the other.<br>
<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项1：This conversation is going nowhere.</span>'''''<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Portland：</span><br>
What do you mean "going nowhere"?! Of course it is! Dorsetshire completely understands Indy's appeal!<br>
She's totally on board with joining forces and spreading the word of how cute she is!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Dorsetshire：</span><br>
All too true! Together, Portland and I shall enlighten the entire world!<br>
Everyone will know Norfolk's name and celebrate her each and every charm point!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Portland：</span><br>
Hang on... Norfolk's name?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Dorsetshire：</span><br>
Yes...?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Portland：</span><br>
I thought you were going to join me in the Church of Indy and ask to be graced with her cuteness?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Dorsetshire：</span><br>
What? I thought you were the one who wanted to kneel with me before the altar of Norfolk and ask for her blessings?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Portland：</span><br>
That's, uhh... not what I had mind?<br>
<br>
Turns out I was right. They were both talking to a brick wall.<br>

Chapter 4 - Distance Felt<br>
Port - Classroom<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Portland：</span><br>
I don't get it, Commander. Despite all my efforts, my Indy fans counter remains at just one!<br>
Here I thought I could convince my fellow sister-lovers to join me, but it seems I was wrong...<br>
Since that's failed, all there's left now is to preach to everyone I come across!<br>
<br>
Just as I'm about to tell her not to be ridiculous, a familiar face peeks out from behind a corner.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Portland：</span><br>
You there! Have you heard about Indy, the cutest little sister on the planet?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">I-58：</span><br>
Wah! Don't spook me like that... Wh-what was that about an "Indy"?<br>
You don't mean... Indianapolis, do you?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Portland：</span><br>
I do! If you want to be among the first people to join the Church of Indy, now's your chance!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">I-58：</span><br>
Umm, the thing is, Portland...<br>
I... had this mock battle with Indy the other day, and I... I sank her...<br>
And ever since, I haven't been able to strike up a conversation with her...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Portland：</span><br>
You what?! Mock battle or not, you sank Indy?!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">I-58：</span><br>
I'm sorry! Sorry, sorry, sorryyyyy!<br>
<br>
Frightened, I-58 ran away.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Portland：</span><br>
Sorry for wh– Hey, wait!<br>
Aww... I didn't mean to scare her, I was just gonna say how amazed I am that she defeated Indy.<br>
Although I guess I understand how she feels. Back in the day, I had a similar incident with Yuudachi and Hiei...<br>
Beating someone really badly, even if just in an exercise, does make them wanna distance themselves from you.<br>
<br>
Portland seems nervous about how to deal with the people she's clashed with in the past.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Portland：</span><br>
And that's a problem, because if they won't want to talk to Indy, I can't preach her greatness to them...<br>
There's only one solution: getting Indy back in touch with those people so I can then preach about her to them!<br>
Once she's gotten her foot in the door, I'll sing Indy's praises until they realize how perfect and adorable she is!<br>
With that decided... Commander, I need a small favor from you!<br>
Could you gather all the people I've talked to over the past few days and send them and Indy on the same sortie?<br>
<br>
The look in her eyes is that of utmost sincerity. I don't know what she's planning here, but I'm inclined to go along with it.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Portland：</span><br>
Commander? What is it? Why so quiet all of a sudden?<br>
<br>
On second thought, I think the problem here is people distancing themselves not from Indy, but from Portland...<br>
I'd have to think carefully about how I wanted to conduct the next sortie...<br>

Chapter 5 - Change of Plans<br>
Port - Noon<br>
Today's the day of the sortie. I created a special fleet for the mission, composed of the girls relevant to Portland.<br>
Deutschland. Dorsetshire. Hiei. I-58. Yuudachi. And last, but not least...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Portland：</span><br>
...Me? Why am I the flagship?! This isn't what I asked for!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Deutschland：</span><br>
*sigh*, so what is the idea behind this fleet, exactly? Three girls from one faction, but then there's me, Dorsetshire, and Portland...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Dorsetshire：</span><br>
Heheh, I'll work with any fleet composition as long as you'll listen to me talk about Norfolk.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">I-58：</span><br>
Um... Hi, Portland...！<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Yuudachi：</span><br>
Woof? Yo, Portland! You ready for some payback after that time you dunked on me?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Portland：</span><br>
Oh geez... Don't tell me you still hold a grudge against me?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Hiei：</span><br>
Now, now, let's not taunt Portland.<br>
We once suffered an embarrassing defeat owing to her, but that's all in the past. Now let us fight side by side, rather than with each other.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Portland：</span><br>
(Gosh, Hiei's giving me scary looks...)<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">I-58：</span><br>
(Hope Portland's still not angry with me... It's probably for the best if I just treat this as a normal mission.)<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Deutschland：</span><br>
Hmph. If any of you can work as a team, I'll be surprised.<br>
Probably not, though. I don't expect much teamwork out of a pack of dogs.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Yuudachi：</span><br>
A pack of *what*?! I dare you, call me a dog again! I double dog dare you!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Portland：</span><br>
Commandeeeer! You need to swap me out for Indy, because this wasn't the plan!<br>
How am I supposed to preach Indy's adorable side to them if they won't even see her eye-to-eye?<br>
<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项1：No, this is about you.</span>'''''<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Portland：</span><br>
Huh?! You're doing this to... close the gap between me and other people?<br>
Well, all right, I suppose. And don't worry, I'll still play my part in the mission!<br>
But in exchange, we're gonna have a double pass of Indy Appreciation Hour when I get back!<br>

<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Portland：</span><br>
Enemy submarine to our port side! Yuudachi, ready depth charges!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Yuudachi：</span><br>
Got it! I'm gonna blow 'em to pieces!!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Portland：</span><br>
Their fleet is comprised mainly of light cruisers... We'll be playing catch-up with them since our ships are slower.<br>
Hiei, fire a battery to the enemy's front! Disorient them with the impact while Deutschland and Dorsetshire flank them!<br>
I'll suppress them with my own cannon fire! I-58, circle around to attack them with torpedoes!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Hiei：</span><br>
Understood!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">I-58：</span><br>
Okay! They won't know what hit them.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Dorsetshire：</span><br>
Let's go, Deutschland! I'll come in from the left!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Deutschland：</span><br>
Very well, then I will come in from the right and crush them!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Portland：</span><br>
All targets confirmed neutralized. Let's head back to port.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Dorsetshire：</span><br>
That went surprisingly well. Good job, everyone.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Yuudachi：</span><br>
Hell yeah! We totally mopped the floor with them!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Hiei：</span><br>
Plus, we only sustained minimal damage. It was all thanks to Portland's precise instructions.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">I-58：</span><br>
(Holy cow... Portland's a pretty good strategist without Indianapolis around to distract her.)<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Portland：</span><br>
Still, I could've done an even better job if only Indy had been here!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Deutschland：</span><br>
Really, now? So you weren't even at your best today?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Portland：</span><br>
Mhm! When Indy's with me, my brain works 100 times as fast!<br>
But when she isn't, I just can't push myself to my limit.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Deutschland：</span><br>
Heheh, you're a curiosity, I'll give you that much.<br>
To think you're this good at commanding, but you weren't even going all-out.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Portland：</span><br>
...Um, thanks.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Deutschland：</span><br>
My opinion of you has improved. You're not just some weirdo obsessed with her own sister.<br>
You've also made me want to learn more about your sister, if she really gives you the power you claim she does.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Portland：</span><br>
Really? But you didn't want to hear me out earlier, so what's changed?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Deutschland：</span><br>
It's simple... You're strong and competent, two traits which I like in people.<br>
More importantly, shouldn't we get a move on already? We're just standing around here.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Portland：</span><br>
Oh, right! Yeah, let's go, everyone!<br>

Chapter 7 - Happiness is Best When Shared<br>
Port - Noon<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Indianapolis：</span><br>
...Oh. Portland's team is back.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Portland：</span><br>
We've returned! I missed you, Indyyyyyy!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Indianapolis：</span><br>
Grrghhh... N-not so tight, please... I can't breathe...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Portland：</span><br>
Sorry! But you know, *you* were supposed to go on that sortie instead of me!<br>
This isn't how it was supposed to go! My plan was to help you make new friends!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Indianapolis：</span><br>
Actually... I think this exactly is what the Commander wanted.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Portland：</span><br>
Huh? What the Commander wanted?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Hiei：</span><br>
Heheh. This is just a guess, but I believe the Commander sortied us together so we could learn more about you, Portland.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Yuudachi：</span><br>
Oh yeah, that makes sense! I've pretty much like, never talked to her before now.<br>
All I knew about her is that she's crazy for her sister!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Dorsetshire：</span><br>
But as we found out from fighting alongside her, there are many more facets to her personality.<br>
Like how capable she is when she gets serious.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Portland：</span><br>
I-I don't know what to say...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Indianapolis：</span><br>
The Commander wanted to improve everyone's perception of you, and thought the best way of doing that was to have them see you in a new light.<br>
The idea was that once they got to know you better, they'd be willing to listen to what you have to say.<br>
So basically, the goal of this was to help you make some new friends.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Portland：</span><br>
Commander... is that true?<br>
<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项1：Yep.</span>'''''<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Indianapolis：</span><br>
Sis... It really does make me happy that you like talking about me so much.<br>
But you know what else makes me happy? You actually being happy.<br>
Seeing you getting on so well with people... that really brings a smile to my face.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Portland：</span><br>
Oh, Indy...!<br>
Thank you, Commander! Thank you for making Indy so happy! Her smile is as bright and essential as the sun to me!<br>
I hereby declare you the second member of the Church of Indy, with honors!<br>
Wait, that doesn't sufficiently express how grateful I am. You deserve something a little more special...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Indianapolis：</span><br>
Mhm. Since you made me smile, I think you should do the same for the Commander.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Portland：</span><br>
Oh, yeah! Commander, you really thought all this through, didn't you?<br>
Not only did you make Indy happy, you also made me really happy.<br>
And by making me happy, I hope I make you happy. So... thank you so much, Commander!<br>
Hehehe~<br>
<br>
Portland giggled and smiled for me. I couldn't help but smile back.<br>
