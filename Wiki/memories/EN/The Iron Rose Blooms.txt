<br>
1 Seydlitz Seems... Off<br>
Morning - Commander's Office<br>
While checking a document Seydlitz gave me, I happened to spot an unusual number of careless mistakes.<br>
It was certainly uncharacteristic of her.<br>
<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项1："I can't help but notice a few errors here and there."</span>'''''<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Seydlitz：</span><br>
Oh, I'm so sorry! I'll go over it one more time!<br>
Ugh, how could I let this happen? I put all the numbers in reverse order...<br>
I'm sorry, Commandant. This is all my fault!<br>
<br>
She apologized vigorously, but she clearly was not her acting her usual self.<br>
Normally, Seydlitz would be more like...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Seydlitz：</span><br>
Commandant, I'll devote every bone in my body to assisting you with your work!<br>
The commission team has returned to port! Would you like me to check the supplies in your place, Commandant?<br>
No problems here! Commandant, leave the rest of your duties to me!<br>
Hah! No matter what the mission may be, I will carry it through to your specifications, Commandant!<br>
<br>
It was certainly uncharacteristic of her.<br>
(She's really down. What could have happened to her?)<br>
<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项1："If anything is wrong, I'm glad to try and help."</span>'''''<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Seydlitz：</span><br>
Thank you! Actually, the thing is...<br>
Yesterday, the Iron Blood dormitory cat ran away. I was so worried that I ended up searching the whole night for her...<br>
I haven't gotten any rest, so it's a little hard to concentrate... Ugh, I shouldn't be making excuses like this.<br>
Commandant, I sincerely apologize for causing you trouble!<br>
Also, the kitty came back this morning, so... Basically, I just, uhh... Y'know...<br>
<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项1："I get it."</span>'''''<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Seydlitz：</span><br>
Sure, she's a cat and all, but that doesn't mean she can be all lazy and self-centered. I mean, she's not Eugen!<br>
At least let people know before you go out! That's just common courtesy!<br>
When she came home this morning, she was filthy. She looked like she was just out partying all night, or something!<br>
<br>
"It seems like the cat tired you out physically AND mentally."<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Seydlitz：</span><br>
The real problem is that she thinks she makes all the rules...<br>
I'm going to have to teach her proper discipline. That includes coming back by curfew.<br>
<br>
"I have some coffee, if you'd like. Why don't you rest for a while, maybe take a nap?"<br>

<br>
2 Seydlitz, Gone Serious<br>
Taking a break from sifting through data archives, I went to the lounge to pour myself a cup of coffee.<br>
But before I can round the corner just in front of my office, I hear a voice coming from near my doorway.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Seydlitz：</span><br>
On the Commandant's orders, all visitors must produce an invitation signed by the Commandant before they are allowed in.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Vanguard：</span><br>
My, Seydlitz. You've taken to your duties quite well.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Seydlitz：</span><br>
I'm honored by your praise... But I'm still not letting you in until you show your invitation!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Vanguard：</span><br>
*sigh*... Don't be so uptight. What if I told you I have urgent business with the Commander?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Seydlitz：</span><br>
In that case, you would have to explain your circumstances to the Commandant...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Vanguard：</span><br>
And how do I do that without one of those invitations you mentioned, exactly?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Seydlitz：</span><br>
Well, you'll have to ask in advance, and...<br>
<br>
Before she can finish her sentence, Seydlitz falls silent. After a moment of quiet, she suddenly bursts into laughter.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Seydlitz：</span><br>
Haha, I'm really going around in circles here...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Vanguard：</span><br>
Phew... I'm glad you get it now.<br>
Okay, how about you just pass these papers on to the Commander for me? Keep it up, you little hard worker.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Seydlitz：</span><br>
You, too! Good luck on your guard duty.<br>
<br>
(I'm glad Seydlitz seems to be back in proper form.)<br>
I waited for a moment to pass before turning the corner and greeting Seydlitz.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Seydlitz：</span><br>
Ah, Commandant! Welcome back!<br>
<br>
............<br>
<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项1："Should I write an invitation to myself before I come in?"</span>'''''<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项2："I don't need an invitation, do I?"</span>'''''<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Seydlitz：</span><br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项1）</span>'''''Commandant! D-don't laugh at my expense, please!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Seydlitz：</span><br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项2）</span>'''''Even you, Commandant?!<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项2）</span>'''''Even I'm not that inflexible!<br>
Though sometimes, I do worry a little...<br>
<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项1："Have some coffee, Seydlitz."</span>'''''<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Seydlitz：</span><br>
H-huh?! You've poured a cup for me, too, Commandant?!<br>
Thank you so much! But I'm always available to do odd jobs for you, so please ask me next time if you see fit!<br>
<br>
(She seems a little more relaxed now. Maybe this is a good time to ask...)<br>
<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项1："Has anything been bothering you lately?"</span>'''''<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Seydlitz：</span><br>
I don't know if this would count, but you've been on my mind... Ack! A-ahem, I mean, nothing's wrong!<br>
Your concern is deeply appreciated, but I'm in tip-top shape! Yep!<br>
<br>
So she says, but for whatever reason, her cheeks appear to be slightly flushed.<br>
(Hmm... In that case, I'll just keep an eye on her.)<br>

<br>
3 Seydlitz's Friends<br>
I was walking through the port town along with Seydlitz.<br>
Though, it would be more accurate to say that we're on patrol together.<br>
(This is the perfect opportunity. I can use this chance to ask about what's been bothering her. Let's start with her relationships...)<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Seydlitz：</span><br>
Personal relationships? Oh, that's nothing to worry about. I'm getting along with everyone just as much as ever.<br>
<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项1："That means you're worried about Lützow, then?"</span>'''''<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项2："Is Bismarck worrying you?"</span>'''''<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项3："Oh, no. Is it Hipper?"</span>'''''<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Seydlitz：</span><br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项1）</span>'''''W-well... I mean, she can be a little bit of a lazybones, but...<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项1）</span>'''''But even she hasn't done anything worth troubling you over, Commandant!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Seydlitz：</span><br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项2）</span>'''''Not at all. I have utmost respect for her!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Seydlitz：</span><br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项3）</span>'''''While Hipper can be difficult at times, I consider her a very trustworthy ally.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Seydlitz：</span><br>
Commandant, I appreciate your concern. I really do.<br>
But it's nothing to do with our friends. In fact, I trust them across the board. If there is a problem, I'd say it's myself...<br>
So I'll do my best to solve it and avoid causing trouble for you, Commandant!<br>
Besides, as long as I can faithfully fulfill my duty by your side, I'm more than satisfied!<br>
<br>
(It doesn't seem like questioning her further will get me answers. I'll just have to keep waiting and watching...)<br>
I happen to overhear a conversation as we pass by the outdoor patio of a nearby restaurant.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Carabiniere：</span><br>
Wait?! You already have the latest monster-hunting news?!<br>
...Oh, I see. But doesn't that make charge blades useless here?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Hunter：</span><br>
You'll find that these occasional large targets are more than worth the effort.<br>
Aim for its weakness from afar. That giant uses its tail for all of its attacks, so if you cut it off...<br>
<br>
(Very intriguing. Seydlitz is listening in, too. Might as well ask what she thinks.)<br>
<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项1："Did that pique your interest?"</span>'''''<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Seydlitz：</span><br>
Y-yes! A little...<br>
As far as I can tell, they're discussing a new virtual gaming attraction that recently opened up in the amusement park.<br>
I hear the monster-hunting experience it provides is like the real thing.<br>
In the simulation, you can even ride horses and gallop through the plains.<br>
Oh, I'd love to try it...<br>
<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项1："Do you go horseback riding often?"</span>'''''<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Seydlitz：</span><br>
Umm, I occasionally do when I'm on patrol...<br>
But I've never experienced hunting on horseback.<br>
Oh! I'm not saying I want to try it right now, though! We haven't even finished our patrols here yet!<br>
<br>
(I was about to invite her to go horseback riding together, but she shot that down before I could say a word.)<br>
(And she's right. We haven't finished our patrols yet.)<br>
(I'll have to think of a way to make her open up more...)<br>

4 Seydlitz's Feelings<br>
As we continue our patrol–<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Akashi：</span><br>
Stop on by, nya! We've got a special sale on clothes today, nya!<br>
You two there, come and check out our new arrivals, nya!<br>
<br>
Lured in by Akashi's sales pitch, Seydlitz and I decide to stop by for some shopping.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Seydlitz：</span><br>
Why are there maids at the door, exactly...?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Akashi：</span><br>
Nyeheheh~ Business is booming here, so I hired temp workers, nya!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Shropshire：</span><br>
So she says. Commander, wanna come and take a look~?<br>
<br>
"I could use an addition or two to my wardrobe. And Seydlitz..."<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Shropshire：</span><br>
Ooh, I get it~ You wanna buy Seydlitz new clothes, too?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Seydlitz：</span><br>
Huh? N-no, I'm fine...<br>
(whispering) I-I suppose I should look into new clothes for future parties and the like, but...<br>
I-I'd be happy to take you up on that, but if possible, Commandant, your input would be appreciated...!<br>
<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项1："I trust your fashion sense, Seydlitz."</span>'''''<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Seydlitz：</span><br>
Commandant...! Thank you! I swear, I will endeavor to go above and beyond expectations!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Akashi：</span><br>
Good, good. Come in, nya! Commander, sit right here and wait a moment if you'd please, nya!<br>
<br>
While waiting nearby, I can clearly hear the conversation coming from the measuring room.<br>
(Shouldn't this place be soundproofed? Why do I hear them so clearly?)<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Akashi：</span><br>
Hmm... So you want a dress, nya? What kind would you like, nya?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Seydlitz：</span><br>
Uh, what kind...? Well, I don't think the Commandant had any particular demands...<br>
Umm, something simple and safe, I guess...?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Akashi：</span><br>
Got it, nya. Then it's time to get you measured, nya.<br>
Shropshire, can you take care of this for me, nya?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Shropshire：</span><br>
Will do, boss~ Stand straight first... Okay. Now, spin around... Wow. Seydlitz, I really admire your perfect posture~ But you can relax a little, y'know.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Seydlitz：</span><br>
O-okay... I'm not tensing up on purpose, or anything...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Shropshire：</span><br>
You've always been the stoic kind, huh? I get it~<br>
Forget I said anything. Anyway, Seydlitz, do you understand why the Commander is trying to buy clothes with you?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Seydlitz：</span><br>
Er, I'm not sure... It came as a surprise to me, so I don't know.<br>
But orders are orders. If that's what the Commandant wants, then that's what goes.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Shropshire：</span><br>
Hmm? I don't think it was an order, though? It's just buying clothes. You could've said no if you wanted.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Seydlitz：</span><br>
B-but I couldn't refuse the Commandant's kindness...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Akashi：</span><br>
Do I hear juicy gossip, nya?<br>
Poor Seydlitz. You're so out of touch, nya♪<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Seydlitz：</span><br>
...Huh?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Akashi：</span><br>
If the Commander suddenly offered to buy me clothes, for example, I'd say...<br>
"Thanks for your business, nya! If you don't mind, I'll mark this as a business expense, nya♪"<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Seydlitz：</span><br>
Wow, I never thought of that! That's a real capitalist's brain at work!<br>
Thank you! That's very useful knowledge!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Akashi：</span><br>
There you go, nya! Heheh, I know lots of ways to get the Commander to spend money, nya♪<br>
Like hiring the maids as temp labor... But I can't share any more business secrets, nya!<br>
...I digress, nya. What is it that you want to do, nya?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Seydlitz：</span><br>
What do I want? Well...<br>
If this isn't an order, then that's all the more reason not to refuse.<br>
The Commandant is too kind.<br>
Whether or not there's some ulterior motive, it's up to me to see all of the Commandant's wishes satisfied.<br>
And even if it takes doing paperwork or patrolling the part, as long as I can be with the Commandant, I'm happy.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Akashi：</span><br>
Oh ho ho. There's your answer, nya~<br>
Your measurements are finished, nya. Wait a little longer, and we'll be done here, nya.<br>
<br>
After I wait a bit longer, Seydlitz and Akashi emerge from the back room.<br>
(They must be done getting her measurements.)<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Seydlitz：</span><br>
I have returned from being measured, Commandant!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Akashi：</span><br>
Commander, we expect it to be done by this time next week, nya. Look forward to it, nya!<br>
Oh, and here's a little thank-you gift, nya. Two tickets for the new attraction at the amusement park, nya!<br>
But it's only good for today, nya!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Seydlitz：</span><br>
I-it only lasts one day?!<br>
<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项1："We'd better not let it go to waste."</span>'''''<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项2："Want to go now?"</span>'''''<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Seydlitz：</span><br>
S-sure! I wouldn't want to waste it either!<br>
<br>
Thus, as a result of Akashi's obvious scheming, Seydlitz and I depart to check out the new attraction.<br>

5 Seydlitz in the Plains<br>
We visit the attraction and put on the VR headset as instructed.<br>
Endless, grassy plains fill my field of vision, and I can't help but gasp at the surreal, dreamlike scenery.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Seydlitz：</span><br>
It's so vast...<br>
So there really are grasslands that stretch beyond the horizon, just like the ocean...<br>
<br>
The vast grasslands are perfectly replicated from the real world, perhaps even more than perfect. Seydlitz clearly is impressed.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Seydlitz：</span><br>
Commandant, the truth is... I've never seen the real grasslands in person.<br>
As much as I've always wanted to, I only know about them from books and photos.<br>
But I'm so happy that, real or not, I get to experience the feeling of running wildly through the plains.<br>
<br>
............<br>
<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项1："Do you like it?"</span>'''''<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Seydlitz：</span><br>
The feeling of freedom, you mean?<br>
Well, umm... Sorry, but I don't know if I can answer that yet.<br>
I've never experienced real freedom. All my life, I've shouldered so many hopes - yours, those of my comrades...<br>
Sometimes, Lützow insists that I must get tired of that. That I should get a hobby. But I find my life very fulfilling.<br>
While I do, though, I also worry whether I'm properly meeting your expectations...<br>
Before I realize it, I'm just spinning in circles endlessly. Do you ever have moments like those, Commandant?<br>
<br>
............<br>
<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项1："Of course."</span>'''''<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项2："I guess not?"</span>'''''<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Seydlitz：</span><br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项1）</span>'''''And yet you never show a hint of hesitation... You're stronger than me, Commandant.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Seydlitz：</span><br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项2）</span>'''''Of course not... I appreciate your candid response!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Seydlitz：</span><br>
Commandant, thank you for hearing me out! I'll need some time to think of my own solution.<br>
...More importantly, I spy a juicy monster!<br>
Let's go and hunt it, Commandant!<br>
<br>
After putting her doubts behind her, Seydlitz charges toward her prey in high spirits. I rush to follow after.<br>
While it's impressive how quickly she can turn her mindset around, I can't help but ask myself–<br>
(Have I been misunderstanding her concerns all this time?)<br>

6 Seydlitz's Step Forward<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Seydlitz：</span><br>
The sunset is beautiful... The view from a Ferris wheel makes the world look so shiny and pretty.<br>
Is this how everything looks from inside carrier-borne aircraft?<br>
By the way, Commandant, I heard there's a fireworks show starting soon.<br>
Do you think they'll start right when we reach the top? I hope we'll get to see them...<br>
<br>
After we finished scoping out the attraction, Seydlitz and I ended up coming to the Ferris wheel.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Seydlitz：</span><br>
Oh, excuse me... There's something I'd like to ask you, Commandant.<br>
The reason you brought me out today... wasn't just for patrols, was it?<br>
U-umm... Right now, it kind of feels like we're...<br>
<br>
Surprisingly, Seydlitz herself mustered her courage and brought up the source of her concerns herself.<br>
Seeing that makes my lips curl into a warm smile.<br>
<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项1："I was a little worried about you, is all."</span>'''''<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项2："Actually, I also..."</span>'''''<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Seydlitz：</span><br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项1）</span>'''''I'm sorry for worrying you... But I'm fine now!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Seydlitz：</span><br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项2）</span>'''''O-oh, really?! And I...<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项2）</span>'''''N-never mind! Forget it!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Seydlitz：</span><br>
Erm, regardless of the original impetus... You and I are on a d-date, aren't we?<br>
If this is me being presumptuous, I apologize... But if that is what you want...<br>
If you intend for this to be a date... I'd gladly accept.<br>
<br>
"I'd love to, but if I said it directly, I feel like you might consider it an order..."<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Seydlitz：</span><br>
I appreciate your concern...<br>
Of course... All of my confusion and hesitation are making you worry unnecessarily about me.<br>
But Commandant, if I were to be torn between two answers right now, they wouldn't be whether to reciprocate your feelings or not.<br>
I would be torn between telling you, "I'd love to go on a date with you," and, "I love you!"<br>
Instead of causing you so much mental anguish, I should go on the offensive!<br>
This may be presumptuous, but Commandant, please accept my feelings—<br>
<br>
Just as our car reaches the top of the Ferris wheel, beautiful fireworks burst in the night sky.<br>

7 Seydlitz's Change of Heart!<br>
A week later, on my day off...<br>
While I was thinking about the upcoming party at the port, someone opens the door to the lounge.<br>
Of course, it was none other than–<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Seydlitz：</span><br>
Good morning, Commandant.<br>
I thought you might be here, even on your day off...<br>
(It was a good call to change into the dress the Commandant bought me. Now, I just need to...)<br>
Th-thank you for your time! Commandant, if you'd be willing, umm... Before the party starts, maybe we could take a little walk together...?<br>
It's been such a busy time that a change of pace might be nice, or–<br>
C-Commandant...?<br>
<br>
"............"<br>
Seydlitz's gorgeous attire, so different from her usual style, completely takes my breath away.<br>

<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Seydlitz：</span><br>
I am honored by your praise, Commandant!<br>
You're the first person who's seen me like this... Honestly, I was worried that it didn't work on me.<br>
It's such a relief to hear you say that!<br>
Thank you for your evaluation, Commandant.<br>
It took longer than usual to doll myself up, but it was worth every second!<br>
I'm ready for the party, too. Whether you'd like a partner or a bodyguard...<br>
No matter what you expect of me, I will do all in my power to exceed expectations!<br>
I await your orders, Commandant!<br>
