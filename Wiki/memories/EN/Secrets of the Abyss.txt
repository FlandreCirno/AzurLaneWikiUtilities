<br>
The resort villa, surrounded by trees. Fresh air and the smell of flowers fill the room. It feels quite different to staying by the beach.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Letting Richelieu and Clemenceau oversee this resort was the right call. They made sure this vacation feels fresh and new.<br>
Seeing as I've got time to myself, I suppose I'll have a dip in the thermae in the woods before I get to work.<br>
<br>
As soon as that thought pops into my mind, there's a knock on the door.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Shimakaze：</span><br>
Commander! A letter addressed to you has arrived! I implore you to read it!<br>
I'll be off now! I have other parcels that simply must be delivered!<br>
<br>
Like an island breeze, Shimakaze blows off.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
...They went out of their way to send it to the resort?<br>
What is this? A guidebook to "Aberrinth's Secrets"?<br>
Sounds to me like a new event they're hosting just for this vacation.<br>
Glad they're letting me know ahead of time this time. Not a fan of being thrust into it without any warning.<br>
Let's see... "Like the stars in the night sky, your wisdom shines; it is the blade, sharpest of its kind, that strikes back at your enemy."<br>
"Come now – heed the summons of destiny and enter the ivory tower of the Uroboros Magic Academy."<br>
"You, as the Commander of the Aberrinth Exploration Team, shall venture unto the final destination known as Aberrinth."<br>
"The truth lies at Aberrinth's depths, awaiting you".<br>
So... another story where I go into a fantasy land?<br>
Magic Academy. Exploration Team. Could be fun.<br>
I'll have a closer look later. I need to finish my work for the day first.<br>
<br>
The moment I say that, a strange light begins to envelop the room.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
What the hell is that light?!<br>
Wait... I think I know where this is going.<br>
<br>
Something dawns on me in that very moment.<br>
The fact that the guidebook doesn't list a starting time for this event.<br>

<br>
Once the light fades, I find myself before a heavy door.<br>
It leads to a grand auditorium, at the opposite end of which stands a pure-white tower that reaches into the clouds.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Frankly, I don't think I understand what this is about.<br>
Good thing I still have the guidebook on hand.<br>
<br>
The book got sent here with me. I open the first page to learn the fundamentals... only to discover that the pages are blank, and letters start forming before my eyes.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Codex Magicus：</span><br>
Location: Uroboros Magic Academy. A school that has produced many outstanding mages. Its name is known by all in the world of magic.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Talk about a unique way to dump exposition.<br>
So this is the Magic Academy, then?<br>
<br>
Current Quest: Enter the auditorium and attend the 91st graduation ceremony.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Wait, I'm graduating already?<br>
<br>
I push open the heavy, wooden door. The packed auditorium bursts with cheering from all around.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Painlevé：</span><br>
Those are our seniors. They're positively glowing...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Theseus：</span><br>
Mhm! I hope when we graduate, we'll look as great as they do!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Masséna：</span><br>
Hey, Theseus. Do you still have any snacks?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Theseus：</span><br>
I do. Just leave some for the rest of us, okay?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Duquesne：</span><br>
{playername}! I've been looking for you. Why do you stand by the door, looking clueless?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Codex Magicus：</span><br>
Character: Duquesne. Your classmate. One of the top graduates of the class of 91 at the Academy.<br>
<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项1：(Say hello to her.)</span>'''''<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项2：(Read aloud from the book.)</span>'''''<br>

<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Duquesne：</span><br>

'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项2）</span>'''''Never mind that. Come along. The ceremony will start momentarily.<br>
<br>
Duquesne grabs my hand and guides me through the crowd and to the seating for the graduates.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Le Hardi：</span><br>
Commander! Over here! I reserved a special seat just for you!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Codex Magicus：</span><br>
Character: Duquesne. Your classmate. One of the top graduates of the class of 91 at the Academy.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Duguay-Trouin：</span><br>
Heheh. You've finally come. It seems my prayer was answered!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Codex Magicus：</span><br>
Character: Le Hardi. Your classmate. One of the top graduates of the class of 91 at the Academy.<br>
<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项1：(Have a chat while you look around.)</span>'''''<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项2：(Read aloud from the book.)</span>'''''<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>

<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Le Hardi：</span><br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项1）</span>'''''No, there are others! Those in the seats over there are reps from lower grades.<br>

<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Le Hardi：</span><br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项2）</span>'''''Hey, cut it out! Stop reading!<br>
<br>
BANG!<br>
High over our heads, colorful fireworks go off with a bang.<br>
Then, a figure clad in black robes slowly ascends to the stage, drawing the whole auditorium's attention with this one eye-catching spell.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Codex Magicus：</span><br>
Character: Clemenceau. The youngest principal in the Academy's history, as well as the current youngest grand mage in the world of magic.<br>
Attention: She must not be allowed to know about this codex's existence.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
(That heads-up sure came at the perfect time.)<br>
(...You know, I'm starting to get the feeling that this is a chatbot disguised as a guidebook.)<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Clemenceau：</span><br>
Greetings, our outstanding graduates! Greetings, our unknown but young and aspirational students!<br>
Welcome to the world of magic!<br>
There is more than one road in life. Soon, you will face many situations wherein you must choose, and I believe you'll make the choice that's right for you.<br>
For instance, you can join the Royal Ministry of Magic and become a talented civil servant, with benefits such as a governmental title as well as lifetime employment.<br>
Naturally, you'll also be able to use the red telephone booth we've inherited from our ancestors and move about with it.<br>
Another option is to join the Akashi Company and work as an Aberrinth trader.<br>
You'll get to flex all the things that you learned at the Academy and make waves in the Aberrinth material trade.<br>
Or, perhaps, you'd like to register with the St. Unicorn's Magic Hospital and save countless lives as an exceptional healer.<br>
Assuming you complete the rigorous five-year course, you'll even be able to skillfully treat your companions returning wounded from Aberrinth.<br>
However, it must be said that all matters in Benedictus – big or small – revolve around Aberrinth.<br>
Thus, there is one career that's widely considered to draw the most attention, attract the most people, and lead to the most success – Aberrinth exploration.<br>
If there's one thing you must remember, it's this...<br>
No matter what path you choose, the stars of Uroboros shining in the sky will always light the path forward and guide you.<br>
<br>
Amid ceaseless applause, the curtain quietly falls on the ceremony.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Duquesne：</span><br>
Let's go, {playername}. We've been told to come to the principal's office in the ceremony's wake.<br>
Painlevé, Le Hardi, accompany us.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Painlevé：</span><br>
It's time. It's finally time...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Le Hardi：</span><br>
I've been waiting so long for this. Wonder what tasks they'll assign this year.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
(Oh boy. What are we in for here?)<br>
<br>
Uroboros Magic Academy - Principal's Office<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Clemenceau：</span><br>
Duquesne, Le Hardi, Duguay-Trouin, and {playername}. Heheh. Right on time.<br>
I presume you all have an idea of why I called you here, yes?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Codex Magicus：</span><br>
Character Supplement: Beyond serving as the Academy's principal, Clemenceau is also a member of the Benedictus Council and an expert on the history of the Elder Elf Kingdom.<br>
Additionally, she is the only grand mage who has explored the entirety of the third layer of Aberrinth and come back alive.<br>
Location: Benedictus. A magical city surrounded by Aberrinth. It was rebuilt atop the ruins of an ancient kingdom a hundred years ago and brought back to life. It has been the birthplace of many excellent Aberrinth exploration teams.<br>
Location: Aberrinth. A three-layered abyss created by a catastrophe two hundred years ago. It is home to dangerous monsters and abundant materials alike.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
(This feels a lot more high-budget than our last fantasy adventure... By the way, where can I see my character build?)<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Clemenceau：</span><br>
Each year, the graduating class lends its name to a single, unique Aberrinth exploration team.<br>
This team differs from others by being composed of our best graduates, and it undertakes missions assigned directly by the Academy.<br>
And you, the top-ranking students of this year, are the 91st Aberrinth Exploration Team.<br>
Your leader will be {playername}, and your second-in-command will be Duquesne.<br>
Your mission will be to descend into Aberrinth, explore the second layer, and fill in our incomplete map of it.<br>
You will be on this mission for at least 60 days, but no more than 90.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Duquesne：</span><br>
Understood, Principal Clemenceau. I vow upon my honor that we will meet the Academy's expectations.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Duguay-Trouin：</span><br>
Most impressive, coming from the youngest first-grade mage in history – who earned this title while still in school, no less. It is no exaggeration to say the success of this mission hinges on you.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Le Hardi：</span><br>
Let's give it our best shot!<br>

<br>
Clemenceau escorts me and my classmates to a grand door.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Codex Magicus：</span><br>
Location: The Aberrinth Warp Gate. A portal permanently linked to Aberrinth set up within Benedictus. It is without a doubt the safest way to reach the first layer.<br>
Character: Le Malin. The gatekeeper of the Academy's portal to Aberrinth.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Le Malin? Why am I getting a blurb related to her when she's nowhere to be seen?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Duguay-Trouin：</span><br>
Pfft...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Le Malin：</span><br>
Shluh... Zzz...<br>
Er... Are we starting? Already?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Clemenceau：</span><br>
This is Le Malin. She's the guardian of the Warp Gate. She's SUPPOSED to be standing guard to make sure nobody uses it without permission...<br>
But I suppose that doesn't matter now.<br>
Le Malin, activate the Gate and prepare to send off the 91st Team.<br>
Good luck, all of you. This is the first step of your own journey.<br>
I will remain here and await your good news.<br>
<br>
That moment, all light and sound are taken from me as I fall into a bottomless darkness.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Codex Magicus：</span><br>
Current Quest: Reach the first layer safe zone in Aberrinth, then report to the Academy's watchtower.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
The quest displays just fine, but nothing else does...<br>
Is this thing bugged or something?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Codex Magicus：</span><br>
Aberrinth Survival Guide: The first layer is covered in snow infused with mana. Protect against the cold, and don't forget countermeasures against mana corrosion.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
"Covered in snow," huh? Could've fooled me.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Codex Magicus：</span><br>
Recommended Quests: 1. Set up camp with Le Hardi. 2. Make food with Duquesne. 3. Purify the campsite with Duguay-Trouin.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Come again?<br>
Well, in that case...<br>
<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项1：(Set up camp with Le Hardi.)</span>'''''<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项2：(Make food with Duquesne.)</span>'''''<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项3：(Purify the campsite with Duguay-Trouin.)</span>'''''<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Codex Magicus：</span><br>
......<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
......<br>
Yep. It's bugged.<br>
They're probably rushing to fix it. In the meantime, I'll see if I can find an exit on my own.<br>
...Hm? What's that light over there?<br>
Wait... I've seen that door before.<br>
Isn't that–<br>

<br>
I push open the heavy, wooden door. The packed auditorium bursts with cheering from all around.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Radford：</span><br>
Those are our seniors. They're positively glowing...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Isuzu：</span><br>
Mhm! I hope when we graduate, we'll look as great as they do!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Erebus：</span><br>
Hey, Isuzu. Do you still have any snacks?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Isuzu：</span><br>
I do. Just leave some for the rest of us, okay?<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
(Deja vu.)<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Masséna：</span><br>
{playername}. There you are. Looks like I found you first again.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Codex Magicus：</span><br>
Character: Masséna. Your classmate. One of the top graduates of the class of 92 at the Academy.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
(Feels like I've been through this before...)<br>
(Wait, what? The class of 92?)<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Masséna：</span><br>
Come on. The ceremony's–<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Starting momentarily, right?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Masséna：</span><br>
Huh? How'd you know exactly what I was going to say?<br>
Never mind. We should hurry. They're waiting for us.<br>
<br>
I follow Masséna, slipping between rows of excited freshmen.<br>
The decorations all around us haven't changed much since the graduation of the class of 91 just a while ago.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Theseus：</span><br>
Over here! Aww, {playername}, what's wrong? You look down.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Painlevé：</span><br>
Did you not sleep well last night, by any chance? Shall I cast a spell of calming on you?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Codex Magicus：</span><br>
Character: Theseus. Your classmate. One of the top graduates of the class of 92 at the Academy.<br>
Character: Painlevé. Your classmate. One of the top graduates of the class of 92 at the Academy.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
(This performance is starting to sink its hooks into me.)<br>
<br>
BANG!<br>
Just as expected, fireworks go off and a figure wearing black robes gets up on stage.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Clemenceau：</span><br>
Greetings, our outstanding graduates. Greetings, our unknown but young and aspirational students.<br>
Welcome to the world of magic!<br>
<br>
Then, amid vigorous applause, the curtain quietly falls on the ceremony.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
(That should mean the principal's office is up next.)<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Emden：</span><br>
Pardon me.<br>
"Hello, top graduates of the class of 92. And you, {playername}."<br>
There's something I'd like to tell you. Please come along.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
And you are?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Codex Magicus：</span><br>
Character: Emden. Adopted daughter of the Academy's principal. Also serves as the dean of Spiritalker Academy.<br>
Attention: She must not be allowed to know about this codex's existence.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
(This notice again?)<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Emden：</span><br>
"Emden and the principal are well-aware of your exemplary performance at the Academy."<br>
Today, you shall set out on a mission together as the 92nd Aberrinth Exploration Team. {playername} will serve as your commander.<br>
"Your task is to head to the third layer and map out as much as possible of the area."<br>
Although this year's mission will be especially difficult, I believe that you all grasp its significance.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Painlevé：</span><br>
Of course. We WILL bring back our seniors trapped in Aberrinth!<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
(Wait, "trapped in Aberrinth"?)<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Emden：</span><br>
"A noble attitude. You must not, however, attempt the impossible. You are to return alive and well."<br>
In addition, I want you to have this.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Painlevé：</span><br>
It's... a protective charm?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Emden：</span><br>
"There is one for each of you. The environs on the third layer are ruthless."<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Theseus：</span><br>
Thanks, Emden!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Emden：</span><br>
There is no need for thanks. This is sadly all that Emden can do for you.<br>
"You shall set off tomorrow. Until then, return to your quarters and ready yourselves."<br>

<br>
After the ceremony, I, Masséna, Theseus, and Painlevé went to the dormitory and began preparing for our journey.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Masséna：</span><br>
So, is Aberrinth really as scary as the books say? Everyone I've seen has come back with pretty solid spoils.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Theseus：</span><br>
Aberrinth isn't just one place. It's divided into three distinct layers.<br>
It's not so dangerous if you only venture as far as the first layer, and it has plenty of loot to nab.<br>
The third layer is another story... Principal Clemenceau's team is the only one that has ever returned from there.<br>
According to her, there are also more than a few explorers who've fallen into traps on each layer.<br>
These traps all rob you of your perception of time, trapping you for a long, long time without you even realising it.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Masséna：</span><br>
Meaning, most people don't actually die in Aberrinth, they're just trapped there?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Theseus：</span><br>
Yeah. Something like that.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Masséna：</span><br>
And that's our job, I guess. Rescuing some of those trapped people.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Theseus：</span><br>
Mhm. And since our goal is to reach the third layer, that means we must go through the second layer first.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Painlevé：</span><br>
I'm close friends with Duquesne, one of the graduates of last year who were chosen for the 91st Exploration Team...<br>
They were assigned the mission of going to the second layer and creating a map.<br>
Not a single one of them has returned to this day...<br>
She must be trapped somewhere on the second layer. We must rescue her!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Masséna：</span><br>
Relax. You can count on me. I promise we're gonna find her.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Painlevé：</span><br>
Okay... I'll leave it to you.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Theseus：</span><br>
Right, if we're going to fight as a team, maybe we should know about each other's fighting styles, yeah?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Masséna：</span><br>
Good point. I'll start.<br>
I'm a spear user! I can thrust faster than the wind!<br>
My luck stat is also pretty high! It'll help us seize the best opportunities.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
A lucky lancer, huh? Now that's good to have.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Painlevé：</span><br>
I'm a healer. I'll support you from the back with healing magic, restoring your health and cleansing you of debuffs so you can fight comfortably.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Ah, a healer. An indispensable part of any team.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Theseus：</span><br>
And my forte is offensive magic.<br>
I can cause damage in both bursts and over time, but it takes a little while to cast my spells, just so you know.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
It takes time to chant your spells. Got it.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Masséna：</span><br>
What are you good at, Commander?<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Glad you asked!<br>
Strategy guide, what's my fighting style like?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Codex Magicus：</span><br>
Character: {playername}. Commander of the 92nd Aberrinth Exploration Team. Use ancient naval magic. Especially potent with Cannon Volley and Saturation Bombardment.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
"Ancient naval magic." Wow.<br>
That's perfect.<br>
<br>
The next day, at the Aberrinth Warp Gate...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Le Malin：</span><br>
Mrmh... Zzz...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Masséna：</span><br>
Do we wake her?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Theseus：</span><br>
Yeah. Or, well, we SHOULD do that.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Painlevé：</span><br>
It's a little hard to bring yourself to rouse someone who's sleeping so soundly, though.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Masséna：</span><br>
Now I'M getting sleepy... I just wanna activate the portal, wrap things up, and go to sleep.<br>

Layer One of Aberrinth - Icemaw Gorge<br>
Bone-chilling winds rush in to greet us from all directions as soon as we exit through the portal.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Masséna：</span><br>
Brrr! C-c-cold!<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
(This must be where my "last" self was supposed to end up.)<br>
We need to keep warm and protect ourselves against mana corrosion.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Painlevé：</span><br>
It sounds like you did your research, Commander. That's wonderful.<br>
Casting a freeze-warding and a mana-neutralizing spell... Now we should be okay!<br>
Based on the records our seniors left, the warp tower to the next layer should be in Frostheim, a fortress to the southwest.<br>
It is guarded by Bois Belleau, a powerful monster who is known as the Winter General.<br>
They say that she stands watch from 9 AM to 5 PM every day from Monday to Friday. We should try to avoid those times if we can.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
A monster with a consistent schedule, huh?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Theseus：</span><br>
Sounds in line with this layer's reputation of being "safe." Let's head to the fortress and have a gander.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Masséna：</span><br>
Hang on. There's an easier way of getting there.<br>
According to the maps and markings left by previous explorers, the bottom of the nearby cliff can bring us straight to the second layer.<br>
So, wouldn't it be better to just jump off from here?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Theseus：</span><br>
Flight is forbidden across many areas of Aberrinth. This place included.<br>
Jumping off here is as good as pressing the restart button on life.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Masséna：</span><br>
Sure, but I've always been lucky, remember? We'll probably land safely in a tree and stumble upon some legendary treasure while we're at it.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Painlevé：</span><br>
I think we should let our leader decide. Commander, what do you think?<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
(Strategy guide, what's your advice?)<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Codex Magicus：</span><br>
Attention: Jumping off the cliff will invariably result in death.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Cliff-jumping is out of the question. We'll take the direct approach.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Theseus：</span><br>
Yeah... Right! Let's stick to the regular route!<br>

Hmm. Looking at the map, this should be the Land of Auroras?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Masséna：</span><br>
Auroras. What soft things. I bet they taste amazing!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Painlevé：</span><br>

<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Theseus：</span><br>
Ahaha. You and Perseus would make great friends.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Painlevé：</span><br>
Excuse me, Commander... I've had a protection spell deployed this whole time, and I'm running quite low on mana.<br>
Could we please stop and rest for a while?<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Yeah. It's time for a break.<br>
Sorry for not catching on quicker. I'm not that used to how magic works in this world.<br>
Theseus, you see any spots on that map that look suited for a break?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Theseus：</span><br>
There are a few, but it says the closest one has been overtaken by monsters.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Masséna：</span><br>
Follow me, then. I just have a hunch that there's a shelter somewhere nearby.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
(Strategy guide, is there one?)<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Codex Magicus：</span><br>
Attention: There are no known shelters nearby. Continue forward as planned.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Are you SURE there's a shelter?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Masséna：</span><br>
Yeah! Trust me! My gut has never been wrong before!<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
If you say so. Reckon you can find it in an hour?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Masséna：</span><br>
That's plenty. Leave it to me!<br>
<br>
30 minutes later, she actually manages to find a cave to shelter us from the blizzards.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
(What in the world?)<br>
(How did she find a place that shouldn't even exist according to the story's script?)<br>
(Is Masséna's luck just so powerful that it can overrule the script?)<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Benson：</span><br>
Help! Heeelp!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Bailey：</span><br>
Somebody help uuus!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Painlevé：</span><br>
Commander, someone's crying for help!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Theseus：</span><br>
There're loads of intelligent monsters in the Land of Auroras. For all we know, their cries for help could be a trap.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Masséna：</span><br>
I don't think it is. It might even be an opportunity for us.<br>
Let's go check it out, Commander!<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Alright, we'll go. Only because I trust your gut!<br>

Benson! Look at their clothes! They... They must be mages!<br>
Um, a-are you explorers from above ground? Please help us!<br>

<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Benson：</span><br>
Well, we... Truth is, we are ALSO mages!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Bailey：</span><br>
Yeah, but we ran into a super tough monster... It kidnapped lots of our friends.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Benson：</span><br>
I know we're asking for a lot here, but could you please go and rescue them?<br>

This sounds dodgy as all hell, Commander.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Masséna：</span><br>

Character: Bois Belleau, Winter General of Frostheim and master of all monsters on the first layer of Aberrinth.<br>
She was a top graduate of Uroboros Magic Academy's 1st class.<br>
While she acts frigid and seemingly indifferent at most times, she has a caring disposition and prefers to support and care for others from behind the scenes.<br>
Belleau draws a clear line between work and her private life, but once engaged in work, she won't rest until all is complete.<br>
She has the uncanny ability to fall asleep or wake up on a dime at any time or place.<br>
Once, she fell asleep while walking atop the water. She might have drowned if not for you saving her.<br>

I don't remember such a thing.<br>
Besides, a mere human couldn't possibly live that long.<br>
Ngh... Strange. Memories are flooding back... Why is this happening?<br>
<br>
She shudders, and a frenzied aura emanates from her.<br>
But it settles shortly after, and she calms down.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Bois Belleau：</span><br>
...Deutschland? Did you reset my stats? Does that mean I was starting to lose control?<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Hey, are you okay?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Bois Belleau：</span><br>
I think so...<br>
I'll just say it. My companion and I are both burdened with an awful curse.<br>
We've both bound each other with an ancient spell in order to keep the curse from taking us over entirely.<br>
*sigh*... This is what I get for working on my day off.<br>
I'm going home. Just do what you want.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Painlevé：</span><br>
You'll just let us go to the warp tower?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Le Hardi：</span><br>
I'm... shocked.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Masséna：</span><br>
Commander, you might just be luckier than me!<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
(The strategy guide wins again.)<br>
Let's press on, everyone!<br>

<span style="color:#ff9b93;">Swampy Slimejuu：</span><br>
CHIRPO CHIRPO!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Mary Celeste：</span><br>
Right side! Protective spell!<br>
<span style="color:#ff9b93;">Swampy Slimejuu：</span><br>
CHIRPO CHIRPO!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Mary Celeste：</span><br>
I knew you'd attack from that side! Let the storm take you!<br>
<br>
At the same time, somewhere else on the battlefield...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Theseus：</span><br>
Why did the gate throw us out into the middle of a battle?!<br>
I'll need some time to establish a formation...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Masséna：</span><br>
I'll buy you some time!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Le Hardi：</span><br>
That's a whole lot of monsters... Hiyah! Blow them all away!<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
This is perfect. I've been waiting to try my ancient naval magic.<br>
Stay calm, girls! Form up and intercept the enemy!<br>
<br>
<br>
KABOOOM!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Fancy：</span><br>
No enemies remaining. Excellent.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Mary Celeste：</span><br>
Thanks for helping out, nameless explorers.<br>
Those guys would've been tough work if you hadn't come along.<br>
I'm Mary Celeste, and this is Fancy. We're both outcast mages.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Theseus：</span><br>
We're the 92nd Exploration Team, and I'm Theseus!<br>
This is {playername}, our Commander, and that's Painlevé, Masséna, and Le Hardi from the 91st.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Mary Celeste：</span><br>
Damn, the 91st and the 92nd? Time sure flies.<br>
Then let me reintroduce us. I'm Mary Celeste, a necromancer. I was once with the 22nd Exploration Team.<br>
Same with Fancy. She used to be a member of the team.<br>
As for you, {playername} – I've heard a lot about you.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Le Hardi：</span><br>
You... know the Commander?<br>
What, does everyone in Aberrinth know the Commander or something?<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
You're not gonna tell me I was part of the 22nd as well, are you?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Mary Celeste：</span><br>
"As well"? Nah. I've just heard about you from someone else, that's all.<br>
Seemed to me like she'd been searching for you for a long time.<br>
Let me take you to your camp of outcasts. You'll get what's up once you see her in person.<br>
{{折叠面板|内容结束}}

{{折叠面板|标题=Derelictus Hold|选项=14|主框=1|样式=primary|展开=是}}
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Painlevé：</span><br>
Um, Mary Celeste, there's something I've been meaning to ask you about...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Mary Celeste：</span><br>
Yeah? Let me guess – is it about the ghosts floating around me?<br>
Hahah! I was waiting for you to ask about these.<br>
They're a special kind of magic that we use to counter – or rather, avoid – curses.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Painlevé：</span><br>
Curses?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Mary Celeste：</span><br>
You heard me. Your team hasn't been in Aberrinth for long, has it?<br>
Well, being trapped here for decades makes you more susceptible to a certain type of... environmental curse.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Fancy：</span><br>
Aberrinth's thought assimilation...<br>
Once an intelligent creature has been in Aberrinth for an extended period, its thoughts will begin merging with those of the ancient dynasty.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Mary Celeste：</span><br>
You'll start getting memory problems and your body will undergo irreversible changes.<br>
Then again, I guess fighting this curse is the whole reason us outcasts banded together in the first place.<br>
We came up with protection spells and erected a protective barrier. It's let us just barely cling on to sanity while halting the changes to our bodies to a manageable point.<br>
Ah, we've arrived at our campsite. Let's pick this conversation back up in a bit.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Adventure Galley：</span><br>
What's the password?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Codex Magicus：</span><br>
Character: Adventure Galley. Outcast mage. She was a top graduate of Uroboros Magic Academy's 22nd class.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Mary Celeste：</span><br>
"Mages are stronger than monsters."<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Amity：</span><br>
Correct.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Codex Magicus：</span><br>
Character: Amity. Outcast mage. She was a top graduate of Uroboros Magic Academy's 22nd class.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
(They're both from the 22nd?)<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Amity：</span><br>
Welcome to Derelictus Hold!<br>
<br>
Mary Celeste opens the door to the tavern, and an oddly sweet aroma hits me in the face.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Duguay-Trouin：</span><br>
Welcome, welcome! I've been waiting for you!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Le Hardi：</span><br>
Duguay-Trouin! Thank gosh you're okay!<br>
More than okay, even... You look like you're thriving.<br>
I swear I heard someone call you "leader" just as I came in. What's that about?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Duguay-Trouin：</span><br>
I'm not so much a leader as I am a manager. While we're all mages here, nobody is as meticulous with the little things like I am.<br>
Also, {playername}, it's good to see you. I knew you'd make it out all right.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
I guess "alright" is the word. You don't happen to know anything, do you? About what happened to me back then.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Duguay-Trouin：</span><br>
I believe Duquesne uncovered a lead and is conducting an investigation. You'll surely learn everything once you find her.<br>
Now, enough of that. This is a blessed reunion, and it must be celebrated with ample drinks!<br>

<br>
The following day...<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
(Man, that food was really realistic. I didn't think it'd actually make me feel full and put me to sleep.)<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Mary Celeste：</span><br>
...regroup at...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Amity：</span><br>
...found traces of three enemy forces on the move...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Adventure Galley：</span><br>
...sightings of the Demon Princess...<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
(What's that about? Are they discussing strategy?)<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Duguay-Trouin：</span><br>
Ah. Did you have a good night's sleep?<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Sure did. Anyway, is there a problem? Caused by some monster?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Duguay-Trouin：</span><br>
So you heard that...<br>
It's nothing so serious. I suspect you saw some ferocious monsters en route here yesterday, no?<br>
There are two main types of monsters living on the second layer. The first simply follows its instincts of destroying everything it sees.<br>
The second type, however, makes up an army of organized, intelligent monsters. Their leader is one by the name of Deutschland, also known as the Demon Princess.<br>
It appears that she is in an alliance with the Winter General on the first layer.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
I know her. We actually encountered the General when we were on the first layer.<br>
Is your group and the Demon Princess fighting each other?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Duguay-Trouin：</span><br>
We have been, for many years. Her and her army and the outcasts never got along even before I arrived here. They've fought over every little thing.<br>
Things have changed lately, however, with me working to end the fighting between them.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
You mean by concentrating your forces and engaging them in all-out war?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Duguay-Trouin：</span><br>
Not quite. I'm trying to forge an alliance with them.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Really, now?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Duguay-Trouin：</span><br>
This all stems from the monsters becoming more violent.<br>
Not only that, their numbers suddenly skyrocketed recently. They've collided with not just us, but the Demon Princess' army quite frequently.<br>
Neither of us is particularly pleased with this, and that's how we got to the point where we've finally considered an alliance.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
So what was that deployment talk from earlier about?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Duguay-Trouin：</span><br>
It was about the defensive force that'll guard the place where the alliance will be signed.<br>
It just so happens it's tomorrow. Why don't you come along and see it?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Codex Magicus：</span><br>
Recommended Quest: Go to the location and witness the alliance being made.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
It being such an important event, I just have to see it. I'm also curious to meet this so-called Demon Princess.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Duguay-Trouin：</span><br>
Then we have a plan. Until then, get comfortable around the camp and let's have a couple of drinks!<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
A bit early for drinking. Didn't you drink loads yesterday, too?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Duguay-Trouin：</span><br>
There's little in the way of pastimes in Aberrinth, and leaving the camp requires maintaining a purification barrier which drains a lot of mana. I think you'll agree that this is the best place to be.<br>
Come on, don't just stand there. I'll take the first sip! Cheers!<br>
<br>
Later that night...<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Another day where nothing happened...<br>
Duguay-Trouin's nothing if not talented at tempting people into depravity.<br>
On the bright side, I picked up a key clue while talking to Mary earlier.<br>
That Clemenceau, the principal, once passed out while exploring the second layer.<br>
By the time the outcasts found her, she was on the brink of death. Strangely, though, she got better in the blink of an eye just as they tried to heal her.<br>
Clemenceau's body clearly keeps some kind of secret...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Codex Magicus：</span><br>
Character Supplement: Clemenceau. Your classmate. She was a top graduate of Uroboros Magic Academy's 17th class.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Really, now?<br>
How is Clemenceau, from the class of 17, one of my classmates?<br>
The 17th, the 91st, the 92nd... and the 1st, the most mysterious of them all.<br>
Wait a second... Just how many times have I graduated in this story?<br>

<br>
The next day, before the sun has risen...<br>
After two days of rest, it was time for us and the outcast mages to head to the Whispering Grove, where the alliance would be signed.<br>
There, we find that the monster army is waiting for us in an orderly line.<br>
<span style="color:#ff9b93;">Deutschland：</span><br>
Outcast mages – I, Deutschland, accept all the conditions of your pact.<br>
Our war is hereby over. Therefore, there's no need to drag this ceremony on any longer.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Duguay-Trouin：</span><br>
Your reputation for loathing to waste time holds true, I see, Miss Demon Princess.<br>
Then we just need to sign the document and we can all go home – am I correct?<br>
<span style="color:#ff9b93;">Deutschland：</span><br>
The Chosen One will stay here. That means you.<br>
I've waited eons for you. Now, come! Demonstrate that you're capable of fulfilling your duty!<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
"Chosen One"? You mean... me?<br>
Hey! Whoa! Why is she attacking us?!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Duguay-Trouin：</span><br>
I had a feeling it wouldn't be so simple... Plan B! Drive the monsters back!<br>
<br>
<span style="color:#ff9b93;">Deutschland：</span><br>
It really is you... You fought and won, as you should have.<br>
Just as the prophecy foretold!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Duguay-Trouin：</span><br>
What's this about there being a "Chosen One"?<br>
Are you not just making excuses for attacking us?<br>
<span style="color:#ff9b93;">Deutschland：</span><br>
Do you really think I'd do that? Apologies for my rude and sudden attack, but I had to verify the truth as soon as possible.<br>
At any rate, we can't stay here for long. I'll explain the rest at my palace.<br>
{{折叠面板|内容结束}}

<br>
Layer Two of Aberrinth - Palace of Pandemonium, some time later...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Deutschland：</span><br>
On a night many years ago, the monsters of Aberrinth, me included, all had the same dream.<br>
It said that, soon, the Chosen One would appear and put a stop to the war, reunite our fractured tribes, and lead us to the forgotten ancient kingdom.<br>
The one in our dream had your exact same hair and clothes and was skilled with the same magic as you. That's why I'm convinced that you're the Chosen One.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
(I don't buy that for a second. Let's see what the strategy guide says.)<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Codex Magicus：</span><br>
Character: Deutschland. Also known as the Demon Princess. Leader of the monsters on the second layer and lord of the Palace of Pandemonium.<br>
She was a top graduate of Uroboros Magic Academy's 1st class.<br>
She is also a noble and a descendant of the elder elves.<br>
She came to this place on an important mission. You and she have had fun adventuring together in the past.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
(She's a 1st class graduate, just like Bois Belleau? What? And what's that about us "having adventured together"?)<br>
(This doesn't make sense. Was I a part of the first-ever Exploration Team?)<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Deutschland：</span><br>
You must have many questions, Chosen One. Ask and I will answer each and every one.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
You and Bois Belleau were classmates, and you were a top graduate of the Academy's 1st class. You and I also once adventured together.<br>
Do you remember any of this?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Deutschland：</span><br>
While it's true I have known Belleau for a long time, it's been so long that I can't remember when we first got to know each other.<br>
And you say you and I adventured together? How would that be possible if you're from the 92nd?<br>
Even if I were on the 1st Exploration Team, there's no way I could have adventured with you, a member of the 92nd team.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Le Hardi：</span><br>
Well, the Commander HAS been a member of the 92nd, 91st, and 17th teams, all at once. I don't know how, but it's true.<br>
So it's not the craziest thing in the world that you might've been together on the 1st team.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Deutschland：</span><br>
What an incredible feat... If anyone could do that, it would be the Chosen One.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
(This isn't the time to sing my praises...)<br>
What about you descending from the elder elves? Do you remember that?<br>
How does someone like you end up as the leader of an army of monsters?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Deutschland：</span><br>
I don't know. I can't remember.<br>
However, this conversation has jogged a few memories I have of the ancient kingdom.<br>
Your body, Chosen One, is blessed with an ancient protection spell.<br>
This spell is likely the reason why you've experienced these miraculous things.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Does this ancient spell come from the elder elves?<br>
I've been struck by the elder elves' weapons in the past.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Deutschland：</span><br>
That's impossible! Simply impossible!<br>
I personally deployed the defenses on the first layer when... Ah, I'm remembering something...<br>
No... It's gone.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Fancy：</span><br>
The spirits are getting restless... Means Aberrinth's thought assimilation is getting stronger.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
(Is there some link between Aberrinth's monsters and the Elder Elves' descendants? And what were those "defenses" she mentioned?)<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Masséna：</span><br>
We might as well keep moving if you don't know right now.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Good point. Deutschland, can you show us the way to the third layer?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Deutschland：</span><br>
Yes, of course. Just know that the third layer is completely different to what you've seen here.<br>
A mighty Dark Elf rules over that land – Albion, the Lord of Aberrinth. She is also the governor of the Forgotten Reach.<br>
We may just be able to restore the ancient kingdom and return it to prosperity if you defeat her.<br>
Let's make haste and depart at once.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
You're coming with us?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Deutschland：</span><br>
Naturally. I can't wait to see the deeds you'll accomplish, Chosen One. Heehee.<br>

<br>
Layer Three of Aberrinth - Forgotten Reach<br>
With the help of the Palace of Pandemonium's warp magic, we successfully reached the deepest depths of Aberrinth.<br>
To the southwest, the ruined kingdom of the elder elves is all but buried by sand.<br>
The sound of iron boots walking on stone can be heard faintly in the wind, but the sound only leads to tattered flags fluttering beneath the moonlight.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Le Hardi：</span><br>
What a desolate place... Oh, Commander, look over there!<br>
<br>
Le Hardi points deep into the ruined city. There looms a tower shooting a blue beam of light into the sky above.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Theseus：</span><br>
Could that be the legendary Spire of Cycles of the third layer?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Deutschland：</span><br>
Correct. That's also the tower controlled by Albion, Lord of Aberrinth.<br>
If we defeat her and reclaim the third layer, we can restore the ancient kingdom to its former glory!<br>
<br>
We cross the decayed walls and enter the city proper, surprisingly unopposed.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Le Hardi：</span><br>
It's almost too quiet... We haven't seen a single thing, monster or otherwise.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Painlevé：</span><br>
Look closely. The city's infrastructure is still in working order.<br>
Somebody must be performing regular maintenance.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Something's going on here.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Duguay-Trouin：</span><br>
Indeed. We've passed by plenty of neglected and ruined places on the way here.<br>
Visitors to the third layer should be rare at best... This city has been exposed to hundreds of years of erosion.<br>
But its facilities show numerous signs of recent use.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
By who, though?<br>
<span style="color:#ff9b93;">Phantom：</span><br>
......<br>
......<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Masséna：</span><br>
There's someone ahead... No, behind us?!<br>
<span style="color:#ff9b93;">Phantom：</span><br>
......<br>
......<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Theseus：</span><br>
To our sides, too... We're completely surrounded!<br>
<br>
The sleeping city has awakened.<br>
Figures in black clothing line up and move in lifeless synchronicity like puppets. The same motions, the same faces, like phantoms in the night.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Duguay-Trouin：</span><br>
Heheh, I get it. This is illusion magic.<br>
We were right, Commander. This city isn't abandoned at all – SOMEBODY is taking care of it.<br>
And that somebody is our enemy... the Phantoms of Lord Albion.<br>
<span style="color:#ff9b93;">Phantom：</span><br>
...Defeat.<br>
...Defeat hostiles, defeat disaster...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Le Hardi：</span><br>
Whoa, they're speeding up!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Theseus：</span><br>
This is bad... We need to–<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Masséna：</span><br>
Build a combat front, right? Don't worry! We'll buy you time!<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Don't break formation! Defend yourselves and launch a counterattack!<br>
<br>
<br>
KABOOOM!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Royal Oak：</span><br>
Knights of the Enduring Fortress, form up and eliminate these invaders!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Le Hardi：</span><br>
Huh? Reinforcements here, of all places?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Painlevé：</span><br>
Do you think it's the exploration team that got trapped on the third layer?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Revenge：</span><br>
Step aside, lost adventurers. We will handle the rest.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Duquesne：</span><br>
Yes, leave this to us.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Le Hardi &   Duquesne：</span><br>
- Duquesne?! - YOU?!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Duquesne：</span><br>
Why are you here? And the Commander, too... Thank goodness. I always hoped you were safe.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Royal Oak：</span><br>
Huh? Are they friends of yours?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Duquesne：</span><br>
Comrades in battle, and reliable mages at that.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Revenge：</span><br>
Reliable mages... But they look so young. I guess you can't judge a book by its cover.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Duquesne：</span><br>
Allow me. These two are Royal Knights who've protected the Enduring Fortress with me all this time, Royal Oak and Revenge.<br>
Let's discuss details after we've dispatched of the invaders.<br>
<br>
There's a twinkle in her eye, as if she has some hidden motive.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
(Now may not be the time to interrogate her, but that's fine. I have a strategy guide anyway.)<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Codex Magicus：</span><br>
Location: The Enduring Fortress. A stronghold shrouded in mystery.<br>
Organization: Royal Knights, a group shrouded in mystery.<br>
Character: Royal Oak, a mysterious Royal Knight.<br>
Character: Revenge, a mysterious Royal Knight.<br>

After the battle, we followed Royal Oak's group – who insisted on treating us as guests – to the Enduring Fortress.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Royal Oak：</span><br>
...Thus, with the help of reinforcements skilled in modern magicks from the Association of Mages, we managed to defeat enemies many times greater in number than us and returned to the fortress without issue...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Centaur：</span><br>
So they finally sent their precious Elite Mage Corps to the front line? That's great!<br>
Thank you for all coming all this way from the capital. Get some proper rest in our fortress tonight.<br>
<br>
Duquesne had cleverly introduced our exploration team to them as "reinforcements from the capital's Association of Mages."<br>

(If everyone's mysterious, then nobody's mysterious.)<br>
(I don't think the strategy guide is going to help much here. Might as well figure out things for myself.)<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Centaur：</span><br>
Your assistance is greatly appreciated. We won't forget what you've done for us today.<br>
We've fought here for years to defend the kingdom from the Calamitous One.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Calamitous...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Centaur：</span><br>
Yes. Pardon me for the sudden question, but you all hail from the capital, yes?<br>
What is the situation in Benedictus? Are supplies plentiful? Are the citizens safe?<br>
Ah, I'm sorry... There I go, bombarding you with questions. You must be tired from the long way here...<br>
The sun will set soon. Duquesne, please show the elite mages to their rooms.<br>
And mages? You must remain in your rooms from sunset to sunrise. I mean this.<br>
Outside... strange things are known to happen. I can't divulge details at this time, but...<br>
Nothing bad will happen to you as long as you stay in your room, I assure you.<br>

Enduring Fortress - Guest Room<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Deutschland：</span><br>
The furniture here reflects the popular tastes from hundreds of years ago.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Duguay-Trouin：</span><br>
How do you know that?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Deutschland：</span><br>
It's obvious at a glance, isn't it? But I'm not sure why... Ugh, why can't I remember?<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
You're a magician too, right, Duquesne? How did you come to join the Royal Knights?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Duquesne：</span><br>
You insult me, Commander. Don't you remember my peerless swordsmanship and mastery of the Flashing Light spell?<br>
<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项1：...Flashing Light spell?</span>'''''<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项2：Peerless swordsmanship, you say?</span>'''''<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Duquesne：</span><br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项1）</span>'''''Yes, I may well be the greatest master out there. You'll need no light source as long as I'm around.<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项1）</span>'''''I happen to be an accomplished swordsman, too.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Duquesne：</span><br>

<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Duguay-Trouin：</span><br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项2）</span>'''''Just don't ask her to do magic. All she knows is the Flashing Light spell.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Okay, but what about this Calamitous One that Centaur mentioned?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Duquesne：</span><br>
Do you remember the history of Aberrinth, Commander?<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
(Strategy guide. Tell me the history of Aberrinth, quick!)<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Codex Magicus：</span><br>
Location: Aberrinth. A three-layered abyss created by a catastrophe two hundred years ago. It is home to dangerous monsters and abundant materials alike.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Duquesne：</span><br>
Two hundred years ago, a meteor landed in the ancient kingdom's territory, spewing evil in its wake. Aberrinth was created at this time.<br>
This place is our front line against the Calamitous One's advance.<br>
Ever since parting ways with Le Hardi and Duguay-Trouin, I've been exploring the third layer.<br>
It wasn't until I met the knights that I found a properly functioning organization.<br>
What I'm saying is... this fortress is special. Especially at night–<br>
<br>
KABOOOM!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Painlevé：</span><br>
An earthquake? N-no... Look outside!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Duquesne：</span><br>
Perfect timing. See for yourself what's happening.<br>
<br>
The watchtowers ring their alarms, and fires are lit all around for smoke signals, illuminating the defensive army atop the city walls in the process.<br>
Nightmarish monsters close in from the dark below.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
We're under attack!<br>

<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Centaur：</span><br>
Archers, nock!<br>
Loose!<br>
<br>
Arrows rain from the battlements, but they do nothing to stop the enemy's advance.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Revenge：</span><br>
Centaur, our first defensive line has fallen!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Royal Oak：</span><br>
It's only a matter of time before the second goes down, too!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Centaur：</span><br>
Try to hold on! If we can just make it until dawn...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Royal Oak：</span><br>
Centaur, there's a breach in the wall!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Centaur：</span><br>
Damn!<br>
<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项1：Cast Spell: Cannon Volley</span>'''''<br>
<br>
A well-coordinated barrage of artillery rips through the night and annihilates the enemies trying to breach the city.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Centaur：</span><br>
Mage? Why are you here?<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
We're your reinforcements, remember? We won't sit idly by while the fortress is destroyed!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Centaur：</span><br>
But...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Revenge：</span><br>
Oh, no! The city wall has collapsed!<br>
<span style="color:#ff9b93;">A group of Infernal Deviljuus has appeared.：</span><br>
TWEEVIL TWEEVIL!<br>
<br>
<br>
The devastating battle ends with dawn's arrival. Our foes recede like the tide, leaving destruction in their wake.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Revenge：</span><br>
Royal Oak, how are your injuries?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Royal Oak：</span><br>
Just a few scratches... I'll be fine in no time.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Deutschland：</span><br>
Look at what they've done to our walls. I'm not sure we can survive another siege.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Centaur：</span><br>
...I wouldn't worry about that. A moment, please.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Deutschland：</span><br>
Huh? The walls and structures are repairing themselves?!<br>
And Royal Oak's leg injury is gone...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Centaur：</span><br>
We were all just as surprised when we first witnessed this miracle.<br>
At first, we believed that the sages had cast a spell upon the walls. But our experimentation proved that it was far from that simple.<br>
The same thing happened night after night, on the ensuing dawn... like clockwork.<br>
That was why we sought reinforcements from the capital, but constant troubles prevented us from ever leaving the fortress for too long.<br>
This situation has gone far beyond our wildest expectations...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Codex Magicus：</span><br>
Tip: You'll receive a different quest depending on whether you tell the Royal Knights the truth or lie.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
...I see.<br>
Let me be honest. We're not reinforcements from the Association of Mages.<br>
We come from a world 200 years ahead of yours... one where the elder elves' kingdom has fallen, where the Calamitous One has yet to appear.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Centaur：</span><br>
Oh... Is that true? Then my suspicions must be right, after all.<br>
The Royal Knights... No, our very fortress... They don't exist anymore, do they?<br>
If you've heard the name Albion before, then I think you know what I mean to say.<br>
The elf Albion was a superb mage, and her best magic of all... was creating illusions.<br>
Maybe we're nothing but another of her illusions.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Revenge：</span><br>
Whatever the case, we've fought for hundreds of years, isolated and unaided.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Royal Oak：</span><br>
We must put an end to this...<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
If everything here IS an illusion, then I may know a way to dispel it.<br>
But I'll need everyone's help to do it.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Centaur：</span><br>
Of course. I cede command of the knights to you. Guide us back to true dawn, Commander!<br>

<br>
The next day, noon came and went in a blink. As the curtain of night falls again, the army of monsters once more amasses itself outside the fortress.<br>
Just as she'd done every night for hundreds of years, Centaur commands the knights to go into battle against the approaching army.<br>
Meanwhile, I, Masséna, and Deutschland leave the fortress together to search for something in the wastes.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
There must be a magic circle somewhere to sustain an illusion spell of these proportions.<br>

<br>
At the same time, at the Enduring Fortress...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Royal Oak：</span><br>
Centaur, the mana in the surroundings is changing.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Centaur：</span><br>
Yes. It's getting weaker and weaker, changing into something I'm not familiar with.<br>
Loyal knights of the kingdom, gather under the banner of the Fallen God!<br>
This will be the Enduring Fortress' final counterattack and our last battle. Please, let us make it a glorious finale!<br>
Form a line and advance!<br>
<br>
Sometime later, Centaur fired her final golden arrow as the enemy was beginning to retreat.<br>
The magic circle's destruction had broken the equilibrium, and the massive illusion could no longer sustain itself.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Revenge：</span><br>
It's finally over...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Royal Oak：</span><br>
Even the beams of light piercing through the clouds feel... different to the usual.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
You did it. Great work, everybody.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Centaur：</span><br>
Indeed. Victory is ours. I'm glad your team made it back safely, Commander.<br>
I'm delighted that we could speak one last time before we fade away.<br>
I wish I could leave behind a tale like, "The Commander's and the knights' journey still continues." Alas...<br>
I'm afraid this is where we must say goodbye.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Royal Oak：</span><br>
Don't forget about us, Commander.<br>
<br>
The illusory fortress disappears. The elder elves who gave their lives for their kingdom leave for their final resting place.<br>
During all this, a mysterious passage appears.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Duquesne：</span><br>
Where goes this path?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Masséna：</span><br>
I think there's something really nice hidden at the end of it!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Le Hardi：</span><br>
What are we waiting for? Let's go investigate!<br>
{{折叠面板|内容结束}}

<br>
We follow the passage to its endpoint, where an intense sleepiness suddenly comes over us.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Masséna：</span><br>
*yawn*... So tired. My gut is telling me to go to sleep right now.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Le Hardi：</span><br>
Same... I feel so sleepy all of a sudden.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Deutschland：</span><br>
Hmph. I suppose I can lower myself to... take a short nap with you.<br>

Ikazuchi, the Commander's starting to doze off.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ikazuchi：</span><br>
I see! Since you've shown just how badly you wanna see us, we'll unlock this secret event for you.<br>
<br>
In a trance, I hear faint whispers coming from the sky. The next thing I know, a desolate land and a temple appear out of nowhere.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Inazuma：</span><br>
Congratulations on getting the secret event. We're waiting for you inside the temple.<br>

<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ikazuchi：</span><br>
There you are, Commander!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Inazuma：</span><br>
It seems the ancient kingdom's blessing still works.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Who are you?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Codex Magicus：</span><br>
Character: Ikazuchi. A mysterious girl who's come out of nowhere. She's smart and strong.<br>
Character: Inazuma. A mysterious girl who's come out of nowhere. She's strong and smart.<br>
Attention: They know about this codex's existence.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Did you... write this into the story yourselves?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ikazuchi：</span><br>
What do you reckon, Inazuma? Should we feign ignorance about the Commander's meta comments?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Inazuma：</span><br>
That's our only real option. Let's treat it as though this is the first time all of us meet in this story.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ikazuchi：</span><br>
Alright, will do.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Have we met somewhere before?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Inazuma：</span><br>
......<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ikazuchi：</span><br>
To reward you for solving the Enduring Fortress' mystery, we're gonna tell you a story.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Inazuma：</span><br>
We presume that you've heard about the Calamitous One.<br>
This story begins long ago, around 200 years in the past...<br>
When the Calamitous One appeared, virtually every elf in the ancient kingdom fought until their last breath to protect Benedictus and the strongholds around the region.<br>
Those elves who didn't instead fought to prevent the spread of calamity inside Aberrinth. They, too, fell victim to its corrosive power.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ikazuchi：</span><br>
Still, there are a few rare, special cases like Deutschland. She is an elder elf who went out to survey this land with the 1st Expedition Team after her kingdom fell.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
What about the Lord of Aberrinth – Albion? Is she tied to the Calamitous One?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ikazuchi：</span><br>
Uhh... In the previous version, she was just someone you had to defeat.<br>
But we wanted this fantasy adventure to be more fun for you, so we added a little secret quest for you.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Inazuma：</span><br>
This secret quest... remains shrouded in mystery.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Okay?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Codex Magicus：</span><br>
Active Quest: Your current quest objective is still a mystery. Investigate further to find potential leads.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Inazuma：</span><br>
Do you still remember the Elder Elf's Arrow you retrieved on the first layer?<br>
That arrow contains a sacred power that excels at cleansing the dark and purifying corrosion.<br>
It's a hugely important relic, so think very carefully about whether you want to use it or not.<br>
We've said our bit now. We wish you luck on the rest of your journey with your party.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ikazuchi：</span><br>
Aaand that's it for this secret event!<br>

Layer Three of Aberrinth - Ancient Battlefield Ruins<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Masséna：</span><br>
Mgh... I think I just had a really long but really delicious dream.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Theseus：</span><br>
Seems we all dozed off. Thank god nothing happened while we were sleeping.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Deutschland：</span><br>
I... was an elder elf descendant who came to Aberrinth with the 1st Exploration Team...<br>
Gah! Why can't I remember?!<br>
What I can remember, though, is reading about those girls you saw in an ancient book. I think they were the elves' gods of thunder and lightning.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Gods?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Deutschland：</span><br>
Ikazuchi, the smart and strong god of lightning. Inazuma, the strong and smart god of thunder.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Le Hardi：</span><br>
I have no idea who you're talking about...<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
......<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Deutschland：</span><br>
Anyway, about the Elder Elf's Arrow – as they said, it's a relic made to cleanse the dark and purify corrosion.<br>
That thing should be able to deal with Albion, somehow.<br>
So, in other words, we're just one step away from reclaiming Aberrinth and restoring the ancient kingdom!<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Something tells me it's not so straightforward. They dodged the question when I asked them about Albion's connection to the Calamitous One.<br>
I'm sure we'll uncover another lead if we're able to deal with Albion one way or another, though.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Masséna：</span><br>
That's exactly what my gut's telling me! So, let's get back on the trail!<br>

<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Painlevé：</span><br>
Is she sleeping? She hasn't reacted to our arrival at all.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Masséna：</span><br>
She looks so comfy... It's making me sleepy, too.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Deutschland：</span><br>
Now's our chance! Pierce her with the arrow to cleanse the dark!<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>

Are you all from the Elite Mage Corps?<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
We're the Aberrinth Exploration Team from Benedictus. Albion, can you tell us anything about the Calamitous One?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Albion：</span><br>
Benedictus... How strange it is to hear that name again. That was once our capital.<br>
In olden times, it was the source of countless tales of bravery, pride, loyalty, and tragedy.<br>
As for the Calamitous One... We once believed that the guidance of the three sages would help us reclaim our lost home from her.<br>
But now... I think that you, those with the power to awaken me, may just have what it takes to save the world.<br>
I'll guide you to the hidden realm where the three sages reside.<br>

<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Will Inazuma and Ikazuchi appear this time, too?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Albion：</span><br>
I'll need a moment. Before the calamity engulfed me, I used my illusion magic to conceal the Realm of Slumber...<br>
...Hmm? Are you saying you've met Inazuma and Ikazuchi?<br>
Two hundred years ago, this temple was built and dedicated to the elves' most revered twin goddesses.<br>
Only those they've invited are permitted to set foot within.<br>
I had no idea their power still resided in this world... This may be wonderful news for us.<br>
Before I dispel the illusion, I must tell you all how that apocalyptic war ended.<br>
Once upon a time, when forests flourished and life filled the world, the three elven sages walked the land with us. Everyone, even orphaned children, took up arms to fight for hope.<br>
But as we lost our strongholds one by one, the power of the three sages waned.<br>
In the end, the sages made the ultimate sacrifice. They sealed the Calamitous One in eternal slumber, putting themselves to sleep in the process.<br>
Thus, this Realm of Slumber is also where the Calamitous One is sealed.<br>
Commander, I sense the sages' protective blessing within you.<br>
But they should still be asleep... I just hope the seal holds...<br>
Illusion, dispel!<br>
<br>
The illusion fades, revealing an enormous ancient tree. It towers into the twilight sky.<br>
Withering branches stretch desperately upward, like the faded crowns of decayed gods, struggling to protect the dying elven bloodline even as they themselves die.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Deutschland：</span><br>
I can sense it... The mother tree weeps.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Albion：</span><br>
Oh, no... Something is draining the tree's life force!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Duquesne：</span><br>
A barrier sinister with construction cunning envelops this place.<br>
Offensive magic most powerful will be needed to break it.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Theseus：</span><br>
Did someone say offensive magic? Heheh, it's finally my time to shine!<br>
I'll build a position now. Just you wait!<br>
<br>
KABOOOM!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Painlevé：</span><br>
The barrier is wavering, but it's not enough yet.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Let's combine our attacks!<br>
Casting spell... Cannon Volley! And Saturation Bombardment, too!<br>
<br>
KABOOOM!<br>
The focused bombardment obliterates the barrier in the blink of an eye.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Albion：</span><br>
Modern mages are so powerful... If I'm not mistaken, {playername}, did you just use naval magic?<br>
Even in our time, that was high-level magic only usable by a sparse few great mages.<br>
I'm all but certain now. You have the power to overcome the terror wrought by the Calamitous One.<br>
Now that the way is open... let's go meet the three sages!<br>

<br>
Realm of Slumber - Silent Grove<br>
The three elven sages sleep quietly under the tree of life.<br>
Despite the peaceful looks on their faces, they exude a dreamlike majesty.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Albion：</span><br>
Thank goodness... The defensive barrier held. Their sealing spell seems to be working, too, as the Calamitous One still sleeps...<br>
I'll awaken the sages now. The Calamitous One is sure to wake up alongside them.<br>
It should be weakened from its centuries of slumber. Use this opportunity to defeat her.<br>
In short... This will be your final battle, {playername}.<br>
Sorry – I'm just so nervous. But I know you've been ready for this for a long time.<br>
Defeating the Calamitous One will purify our tainted land.<br>
The raging blizzards will quiet, decayed forests will regain their former vigor, and buildings buried in sand will be renewed...<br>
Our world was once so beautiful. I'll never forget the sprouting buds and fresh branches from the spring seasons of my youth. If only you all could see that beauty, too.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Codex Magicus：</span><br>
Special Tip: Warning! Danger approaches! Danger approaches!<br>
<br>
With a crack, the charm I received from Emden suddenly shatters. Thick black mist undulates out of it like a living being.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Albion：</span><br>
I've done it! The three sages will soon awaken. Everyone, prepare for–<br>
...{playername}? What is that magic?!<br>
<br>
The sunlight blazes brighter, mingling with the black mist to make a disquieting aura.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Gouden Leeuw：</span><br>
......<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">De Zeven Provinciën：</span><br>
*yaaawn*... That felt like a really long sleep.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Evertsen：</span><br>
Are you... the same human from before?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">De Zeven Provinciën：</span><br>
Heehee, it looks like our protective magic worked...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Gouden Leeuw：</span><br>
...No.<br>
The black shade dancing around you... It's the Calamitous One!<br>
<span style="color:#ff9b93;">Emden：</span><br>
"You have the Calamitous One's sublime gratitude, my darling human."<br>
"I am the very meteor that wrought disaster, the enduring malice, the master of despair."<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Codex Magicus：</span><br>
Character Supplement: Emden's true identity is that of the Calamitous One, the incarnation of the meteor that fell upon this world 200 years ago.<br>
<span style="color:#ff9b93;">Emden：</span><br>
"You've escaped my grasp three times now, human."<br>
"The first was when these odious elves protected you."<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Codex Magicus：</span><br>

<span style="color:#ff9b93;">Emden：</span><br>

<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Codex Magicus：</span><br>

<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Codex Magicus：</span><br>
Character Supplement: {playername}. The Commander of the 91st Aberrinth Exploration Team. Led Le Hardi, Duguay-Trouin, and Duquesne.<br>
<span style="color:#ff9b93;">Emden：</span><br>
"But this time, I will not fail."<br>
"In fact, my success is all but guaranteed this time."<br>
"The elven blessing inside you can also be used to destroy their barrier, giving me access to wear away at their very spirits."<br>
"The age of elves is over. Now, an era of disaster will reign!"<br>
<br>
The Codex Magicus in my hand glows, as if defying the encroaching darkness.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">"Codex Magicus"：</span><br>
...You finally remember everything, Commander. Thank goodness.<br>
<br>
A girl clad in pure white appears before me in the darkness. She smiles.<br>

Character Supplement: Codex Magicus. Emden's reliquary box. A member of the 1st Aberrinth Exploration Team.<br>
I've been by your side all this time.<br>
<br>
Emden gently grasps my hand and places something soft in it.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">"Codex Magicus"：</span><br>
Accept my essence.<br>
Save me, awaken me...<br>
And take me home once and for all.<br>

<span style="color:#4eb24e;">"Codex Magicus"：</span><br>
...I'll hold you to that promise, Commander.<br>
Goodbye... We will meet again.<br>
<br>
......<br>
......<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Deutschland：</span><br>
The spires on every floor of Aberrinth have been destroyed...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Duguay-Trouin：</span><br>
If the Calamitous One reveals her true form and joins forces with Principal Clemenceau...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Albion：</span><br>
Then Benedictus will fall once again.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Painlevé：</span><br>
Let's not fret too much for now. The Commander is still sleeping, so we'll have plenty of time to analyze...<br>
...Huh? C-Commander, you're awake!<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
How long did I sleep?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Le Hardi：</span><br>
For like an entire day!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">"Codex Magicus"：</span><br>
Special Note: Only 30 minutes have passed.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Tell me everything that's happened in the past thirty minutes.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Duquesne：</span><br>
Dean Emden... I mean, the Calamitous One corrupted the elven sages three after you fell unconscious.<br>
She fled our pursuit, escaped Aberrinth, and destroyed all of the warp towers.<br>
In short, we're now trapped here...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Painlevé：</span><br>
Even if we could leave Aberrinth, we have no hope of reaching Benedictus.<br>
Based on her claims, Principal Clemenceau is a pawn of the Calamitous One.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Masséna：</span><br>
Yeah. I feel it, too... Benedictus is in grave danger.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Deutschland：</span><br>
Bois Belleau and the other outcast mages should have noticed by now, but they need more time to muster a defense.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Buying time... That's it!<br>
The Calamitous One's actions put her fatal weakness on full display. She knows this is going to be a hell of a fight.<br>
She destroyed the warp towers because she needs time to build a defensive line. In other words, she isn't ready yet.<br>
That means we must act now!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Duquesne：</span><br>
A counterattack, eh? But how do we get there with the towers destroyed?<br>
<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项1：Your thoughts, Masséna?</span>'''''<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项2：(Consult the strategy guide.)</span>'''''<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Masséna：</span><br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项1）</span>'''''What about warp magic?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Codex Magicus：</span><br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项2）</span>'''''Character Supplement: Ikazuchi and Inazuma. Twin elven goddesses. They have the power to create warp tunnels across dimensions.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Gouden Leeuw：</span><br>
...In that case, we can help.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">De Zeven Provinciën：</span><br>
The summoning spell...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Evertsen：</span><br>
I think we're all thinking the same thing.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Albion：</span><br>
Could it be?!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Gouden Leeuw：</span><br>
Commander, I think I represent all elves when I say, thank you so much for all of you and your teams' efforts.<br>
Let's work together, activate the twin goddess summoning circle, and begin our counteroffensive!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Albion：</span><br>
"Behold thunder and lightning, most radiant twins among the gods."<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Evertsen：</span><br>
"Reveal thy majestic forms and usher in the light of miracles."<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">De Zeven Provinciën：</span><br>
"To you, calamity is but a small, fleeting thing."<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Gouden Leeuw：</span><br>
"Where darkness can never reach, light and pure beauty live eternal."<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ikazuchi：</span><br>
I see... Look who called for our help.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Inazuma：</span><br>
I heard your pleas – you want an elevator built from Aberrinth to Benedictus. What a fun idea.<br>
Sounds just a little bit illegal, but you can have special approval just this once.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ikazuchi：</span><br>
This is the final request that we twin goddesses can fulfill for you.<br>
It's your war, mortals. Throw yourselves into it all you want!<br>
<br>
As the rain, thunder, and lightning fade, a rainbow bridge to Benedictus appears.<br>
{{折叠面板|内容结束}}

{{折叠面板|标题=The Battle for Benedictus|选项=28|主框=1|样式=primary|展开=是}}
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Le Malin：</span><br>
Mmh... Zzz...<br>
<br>
KABOOOM!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Le Malin：</span><br>
Hmh?<br>
Meh... Zzz...<br>
<br>
The battle had already begun as the rainbow bridge to Benedictus extended.<br>
Although she had had little time, the Calamitous One had still skillfully established a defensive line.<br>
Standing on a viewing platform in Benedictus, Clemenceau and her army of gargoyles await us.<br>
<span style="color:#ff9b93;">Clemenceau：</span><br>
I see you've remembered everything, "Commander."<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
It's not too late to quit, Clemenceau. Give it up.<br>
<span style="color:#ff9b93;">Clemenceau：</span><br>
No. It IS too late.<br>
Ignorance is bliss, and humanity should've stayed ignorant.<br>
We brought calamity's insatiable appetite upon ourselves when we learned of the gods' forbidden knowledge.<br>
The price we paid? You went missing, and I betrayed myself in exchange for a chance to live.<br>
But you keep ruining my plans again and again, just as you are now.<br>
Forget it... We'll discuss the past when we stand on the line between life and death.<br>
Because right now, there's unfinished business between us, isn't there?<br>
<br>
<br>
KABOOOM!<br>
Clemenceau is sent flying and tries to move forward again, but that same moment, the warp gate begins to glow, and a snowstorm whips up.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Bois Belleau：</span><br>
I am Bois Belleau, member of the 1st Exploration Team, here to assist!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Amity：</span><br>
Thank the stars we made it! The 22nd Exploration Team awaits your orders.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Deutschland：</span><br>
We shall deal with Clemenceau and her gargoyles! The rest of you, focus on the tougher enemies!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">"Codex Magicus"：</span><br>
Time to go, Commander.<br>
For us both.<br>
<br>
The Calamitous One soars high in the dark sky, seemingly anticipating the battle that's soon to come.<br>
<span style="color:#ff9b93;">"Emden"：</span><br>
"Heheh. You've finally come, my darling human."<br>
"There are those who lose their minds or even their lives when they lay eyes upon me. Some who've lost all hope even surrender to me."<br>
"But you... You alone are able to gaze upon me without fear. Why is that?"<br>
"I want to know the answer."<br>
<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项1：You'll know once I've beaten you.</span>'''''<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项2：The lack of an answer is an answer in its own way.</span>'''''<br>
<span style="color:#ff9b93;">"Emden"：</span><br>
"That look you have, brimming with confidence... I find it surprisingly amusing."<br>
"Heehee. You've thoroughly entertained me, and for that, I must thank you."<br>
"Haven't you forgotten something, though, human?"<br>
"If you want your enemy to surrender, the best thing..."<br>
<br>
"If you want your enemy to surrender, the best thing..."<br>
<span style="color:#ff9b93;">"Emden"：</span><br>
"Is a bang – from a cannon!"<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">"Codex Magicus"：</span><br>
Weapon: The ancient golem. A colossal magical automaton created in the ancient kingdom.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Ooh, a firepower-measuring contest? Sounds fun.<br>
<span style="color:#ff9b93;">"Emden"：</span><br>
"Yes, it does, doesn't it? Now let us take a few shots at each other!"<br>
{{折叠面板|内容结束}}

{{折叠面板|标题=An End and a Beginning|选项=29|主框=1|样式=primary|展开=是}}
<br>
KABOOOM!<br>
Amidst explosions and blinding light, a faint gap in the Calamitous One's seemingly flawless defenses finally reveals itself.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Masséna, now!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Masséna：</span><br>
Heh! This is the moment I've been waiting for! I'm on it!<br>
<br>
Right then, Masséna turns into a ray of blue light and thrusts at the Calamitous One.<br>
<span style="color:#ff9b93;">"Emden"：</span><br>
"Futile. Barrage Curtain!"<br>
<br>
With those words, the ancient golem further intensifies its onslaught. A web of cannon fire envelops the surroundings as the thick mist becomes blazing hot.<br>
Masséna's evasive maneuvers, however, are impeccably on point, and she takes not a single hit. Not even a scorching spark is able to come near her.<br>
Once her target is finally within range, she twirls her body and adjusts her position with an adept spin.<br>
Then, the very next moment...<br>
Several azure shadows take form around her and lunge toward the Calamitous One with great force.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Masséna：</span><br>
I did it! I hit her!<br>
<span style="color:#ff9b93;">"Emden"：</span><br>
"You... What?"<br>
"My wounds... aren't healing..."<br>
"Most... impressive."<br>
"But you shall pay dearly for angering me."<br>
<br>
Slowly, the Calamitous One raises her arm. A tear forms in the sky, from which boundless malice and a fiery meteor emerge.<br>
<span style="color:#ff9b93;">Clemenceau：</span><br>
The blazing meteor of evil... The Calamitous One has revealed her true self.<br>
<span style="color:#ff9b93;">"Emden"：</span><br>
"How long are you going to play games with those little insects, Clemenceau?"<br>
"Finish them already! Before you're consumed by the shadow of death that cursed you!"<br>
<span style="color:#ff9b93;">Clemenceau：</span><br>
Yes, of course...<br>
"O Holy Grail, partake of my blood."<br>
"Banish this sinful soul to the Forsaken Land and seek the essence of constraint!"<br>
<br>
A pitch-black magic circle appears at Clemenceau's feet which then instantly moves directly below the meteor's projection.<br>
<span style="color:#ff9b93;">"Emden"：</span><br>
"What are you doing?"<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Clemenceau：</span><br>
I was as shocked as you when the Commander appeared at the Academy.<br>
I knew you wanted to use the Commander to break the seal on the Realm of Slumber.<br>
So, as you started to scheme, I made plans of my own.<br>
When the 91st Exploration Team set off, I secretly reactivated the Elder Elf's Arrow in the Ancient Ruins, stopping your plan with a little "accident."<br>
I thought the Commander wouldn't reappear for another few years... Then everything would've been in order.<br>
But, by some twist of fate, the Commander reappeared after just a single year. And then, because you were personally taking action, there was nothing I could do.<br>
But... the Commander is a sharp one. You may have accomplished your goal, but we have you cornered now.<br>
Incapable though I may be by myself, all that's left is for me to light the spark.<br>
<span style="color:#ff9b93;">"Emden"：</span><br>
"You will die."<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Clemenceau：</span><br>
That's what my fate should've been anyway during my journey with the 17th Exploration Team.<br>
You attacked us, and I only survived because I struck a deal with you. All of that was so I could find an opportunity to avenge my fallen comrades.<br>
<br>
Clemenceau's expression twists in agony. It's like something is draining all the life force out of her.<br>
Countless black chains rise from the magic circle, each one binding itself to the meteor, locked in place by incantations.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Theseus：</span><br>
Is she... using Sacrificial Cage?!<br>
That's a forbidden spell! It converts the caster's life energy into a prison that eternally seals the target in another dimension!<br>
<span style="color:#ff9b93;">"Emden"：</span><br>
"I will return this land one day. You will be no more than bones in the ground by then."<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Clemenceau：</span><br>
So you may think.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">"Codex Magicus"：</span><br>
Commander, there is a way to save Clemenceau. However, I need your help.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
What do I need to do?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">"Codex Magicus"：</span><br>
You must use all your force of will to evoke me. The cost, though, is that you will be unable to use magic for quite some time.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
That's no cost at all. This is the final showdown.<br>
<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项1：(Focus wholeheartedly on evoking "Codex Magicus.")</span>'''''<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Emden：</span><br>
For the first time, Codex Magicus shows its true self. A soft light illuminates the meteor as pure-white flowers bloom from it one after another.<br>
– "White... flowers"?  – That is my keepsake, Commander.<br>
– "Impossible... How? You should've vanished long ago..."  – I am Emden, member of the 1st Exploration Team, and I shall aid you.<br>
– I will keep the Calamitous One under control. The rest of you, please hurry...  – "Silence. Begone with you. Shut up!"<br>
"I am the Calamitous One! I am in control of this body!"<br>
No. This is Emden's body, and Emden is in control of it.<br>
Please, everyone... put an end to this calamity while I'm suppressing her.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
All units, focus fire! Annihilate... the Calamitous One!<br>
<br>
In the final moment before my consciousness goes out from exhaustion, I issue the attack order. Mustering my last ounce of strength, I throw the evil-cleansing arrow forward.<br>
The blessed Elder Elf's Arrow pierces right through the Calamitous One's chest.<br>
Her death is not a cold, lonesome one. A clean light bursts out from the wound in her chest, like moonlight – it's her annihilation, but also her salvation.<br>
