Chapter 1 - Good Morning, Javelin!<br>

"This is a work of fiction. Names, characters, events, and incidents are products of the author's imagination, and maybe a World War II documentary. Any resemblance to actual persons, living or dead, or actual events... well, might actually be somewhat intended but that's not really what's important..."<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Javelin：</span><br>
Zzzzzzz...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Juneau：</span><br>
Javelin... Javelin...!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Javelin：</span><br>
J-Juneau...?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Juneau：</span><br>
Javelin, hurry and get up! We're going to be late for school!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Javelin：</span><br>
School...? Awawawa! I'm gonna be late!<br>
(My name's Javelin. I'm just a normal J-class destroyer who's just arrived at port!)<br>
(My dream is to be Commander's– Ahhh! That's a secret!)<br>
Well then, Javelin's gonna give it her all today... eek?!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">？？？：</span><br>
<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Javelin：</span><br>
The Meowfficer is... talking?!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">？？？：</span><br>
<br>
<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Javelin：</span><br>
——！！！<br>
(Is the Meowfficer really talking...?)<br>
... Akashi probably just had another weird lab accident again~<br>
W-wait, what time is it? I've gotta hurry to school!<br>
Oh no, oh no! I have to report to Commander this afternoon, so I have to make sure my hair is all perfect~!<br>
<br>
Javelin's story is only just beginning...<br>

Chapter 2 - The Mystery Within the Drawer<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Javelin：</span><br>
I'm so sorry I'm late!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Laffey：</span><br>
You're late, Javelin.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Z23：</span><br>
Really now? Class has already started!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ayanami：</span><br>
The notes you missed, here.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Z23：</span><br>
All right, that's no excuse for being late...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Javelin：</span><br>
I'm telling the truth! I met a talking Meowfficer, and it said something about how I am "destined to have a fateful encounter today," or something like that!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ayanami：</span><br>
The Seven Mysteries of the Academy just increased to eight.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Laffey：</span><br>
Maybe Javelin just isn't a morning person...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Z23：</span><br>
That is a possibility, but... there is also a chance that the Science Club crossed a certain line without permission.<br>
In any case, our best bet is to catch that thing and bring it to Akashi.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Laffey：</span><br>
If I see it, I'll catch it...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ayanami：</span><br>
I'll show you the agility of a special-type destroyer.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Javelin：</span><br>
Hey... aren't you guys taking this a bit too seriously?<br>
(Huh? There seems to be something weird in this drawer...)<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Z23：</span><br>
This is... a pink envelope...?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Laffey：</span><br>
Love letter...?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ayanami：</span><br>
Be careful, everyone.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Javelin：</span><br>
D-don't tell me this is...!<br>
<br>
"A mysterious love letter appeared before Javelin..."<br>

Chapter 3 - A Strange Letter...?<br>
<br>
"Splendid young lady of the J-class, there are words that I must share with you."<br>
<br>
"When the grand bell strikes IV, I shall be waiting for you underneath the blooming flowers."<br>
<br>
"There, you shall receive the truth and love of this world."<br>
<br>
<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Javelin：</span><br>
What's all this nonsense...?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Laffey：</span><br>
I thought for sure it was from Ark Royal, but guess not...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ayanami：</span><br>
I can't tell who sent it...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Z23：</span><br>
This definitely is "objectionable literature."<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Javelin：</span><br>
What's this talking about, though? Grand bell tower... underneath the blooming flowers...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Laffey & Ayanami：</span><br>
Let's ask around!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Unicorn：</span><br>
Unicorn doesn't really get it either...<br>
A similar letter...? Um, I've n-never gotten anything of the sort?!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Jamaica：</span><br>
Hmm... the truth of this world... I knew it, whoever sent this letter must be an "Esper!"<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">York：</span><br>
Impossible. I can't feel any †Force† coming from this letter.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Z35：</span><br>
Even the Devilish Idol has never written such a powerful document before~<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Z46：</span><br>
Tis true, this document is hard to read. But fear not, for we can interpret it.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Javelin：</span><br>
Really?! Viersechs, you're the best!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Z46：</span><br>
But first I must clear, the name of my friend. This did not come from Graf Zeppelin's hand.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Z23：</span><br>
If that's the case...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Z46：</span><br>
The grand bell must be, the school's clock tower. The blooming flowers, the Sakura dorm. This time of the year, their flowers doth bloom.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ayanami：</span><br>
In other words, "at 4 P.M., meet me underneath the cherry tree in the Sakura dorm's courtyard."<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Javelin：</span><br>
Th-that's it!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Laffey：</span><br>
Javelin, fight on!<br>
<br>
"Just what is the identity of the mysterious letter's sender...?"<br>

<br>
"And so, the story arrives at its climactic final battle..."<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">？？？：</span><br>
<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Javelin：</span><br>
Y-You're that...!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">？？？：</span><br>
<br>
<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Javelin：</span><br>
You're the one who sent this letter!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">？？？：</span><br>
<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Javelin：</span><br>
Eeek!<br>
<span style="color:#ec5d53;">？？？：</span><br>
<br>
<br>
"With a roar, the Meowfficer rained fierce attacks upon Javelin and the others."<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Z23：</span><br>
Javelin! Hang in there, I'm coming to help you!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Laffey：</span><br>
Meowfficer J... is the final boss...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ayanami：</span><br>
Taste the Demon's power...!<br>
<br>
(KABOOOM!!)<br>
<span style="color:#ec5d53;">？？？：</span><br>
<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Z23：</span><br>
Javelin, finish it off!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Javelin：</span><br>
Got it! Strike Mode activated, maximum output! Take THIS!!!<br>
<span style="color:#ec5d53;">？？？：</span><br>
<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Z46：</span><br>
... Did you see that, Graf?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Graf Zeppelin：</span><br>
Yes... Those girls are truly... the Heart of the Sea.<br>
<br>
"The peace and tranquility of the port was protected once more."<br>
"We're counting on you, Javelin! The fate of Azur Lane rests within your hands!"<br>

Chapter 5 - What the Heck is This...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Z23：</span><br>
...... What the heck is this...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ayanami：</span><br>
It turned into a trainwreck halfway through...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Laffey：</span><br>
Javelin... rushed the ending...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Javelin：</span><br>
I only got to write half of it when I was in the Manga Club! The ending was done by someone else!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Z23：</span><br>
So that's why only Lebe's and San Diego's names are left in the credits...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Laffey：</span><br>
You should explain... why you stopped writing halfway...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Javelin：</span><br>
W-well, so much was going on that I didn't know how to continue... and then I left my sketchbook in the classroom...<br>
And then everyone took turns drawing in it...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ayanami：</span><br>
Making a manga seems hard, yes.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Laffey：</span><br>
You should have asked us to help.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Z23：</span><br>
Well, everyone has their slumps. Next time, let's do our best to see things through to the end!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ayanami：</span><br>
Ayanami wants to help too.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Laffey：</span><br>
I... will also help.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Javelin：</span><br>
You guys... Mmhmm! Next time, we'll all make the best manga ever!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Everyone：</span><br>
Yeah!<br>
<br>
"Please look forward to Javelin and friends' next work!"<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ikazuchi：</span><br>
I see, I see! So this is what they call the "shameless plug" section!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Inazuma：</span><br>
But what if they don't see this message on time? You never know with extended maintenance...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ikazuchi：</span><br>
Well, let's not worry about that!<br>
Azur Lane will be coming to Anime Expo 2019 from July 4th to the 7th! Check us out at booth #206, as well as at Idea Factory's booth #3906!<br>
There will be awesome events for you to get some exclusive goodies, like wall scrolls and t-shirts. You might even get to meet a couple of your favorite voice actresses!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Inazuma：</span><br>
We'd love to see you there!<br>
