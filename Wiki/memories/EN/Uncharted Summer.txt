Uncharted Summer<br>
<br>
Onwards to a Royal Fortune<br>
It's a brilliant summer day. The still blue seas reflect the sun's rays like a mirror, sharing its cozy warmth with us.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Javelin：</span><br>
Gosh, it sure is hot today! As much as I love the sun, I feel like I'm gonna melt~<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Laffey：</span><br>
Perfect weather for a nap... Zzzzz...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Z23：</span><br>
I brought ice cream from the freezer. Who wants some?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ayanami：</span><br>
Me, please.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Z23：</span><br>
Here you go. And one for you, Commander.<br>
<br>
I take a bite out of the ice cream Z23 handed me. A lovely blend of chocolate and cream fills my mouth.<br>
A leisurely day in clear skies, warm waters, and cool winds. What more could one want?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Z23：</span><br>
Still no sign of that treasure... Where on earth could it be?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ayanami：</span><br>
We've been sailing for quite some time now. It should be around here, yes.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Javelin：</span><br>
Meaning, we should find it any minute now!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Laffey：</span><br>
Guess I'll be on the lookout... Zzzzz...<br>
<br>
Indeed, the real reason we're out at sea isn't to enjoy the weather, but to find treasure.<br>
As for how we learned there was treasure out here to begin with, it's a long story...<br>
Port - Office<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Memphis：</span><br>
By the way, Commander, a strange letter just arrived.<br>
It's from Royal Fortune, whom I'm sure you remember as...<br>
<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项1："The girl who held me captive last Halloween?"</span>'''''<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项2："Everyone's favorite pirate from Tempesta?"</span>'''''<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Memphis：</span><br>
The very same. She's a real piece of work, that one...<br>
The letter's marked "For the Commander's eyes only," but we decided to check it before you opened it.<br>
Just as a safety precaution to ensure there's nothing dangerous inside. You know the drill.<br>
Anyway, here.<br>
<br>
The back of the thick envelope was embellished with a wax stamp featuring a pirate motif.<br>
Opening it, I found a map and a sheet of old parchment paper with some sort of poem written on it.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Royal Fortune：</span><br>
"The easterly wind calls on ye, with courage and pluck, to a land o' gold beyond the sea..."<br>
"There lies a treasure for which kings will kill, pirate blood will spill, and many search for still..."<br>
"Hearken! If this treasure ye crave, then embark on this hunt, and prove ye are brave!"<br>
"The winds be with ye, Commander."<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Memphis：</span><br>
What is this? A treasure map?<br>
<br>
"Knowing Royal Fortune, it's got to be."<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Javelin：</span><br>
Hello, hello, Commander!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Z23：</span><br>
We've worked out a vacation plan and came to discuss it with...<br>
Oh, what's that? A treasure map?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ayanami：</span><br>
"Embark on this hunt, and prove ye are brave..." Where did you get this, Commander?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Laffey：</span><br>
Yeah, I wanna know too...<br>
<br>
I quickly told them about Royal Fortune and how I got this map.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ayanami：</span><br>
Interesting... Yes, we'll be right back.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Memphis：</span><br>
Huh? Weren't you going to discuss your vacation plan?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Z23：</span><br>
Well, in light of the situation, our plans have changed.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Javelin：</span><br>
Yeah! We're gonna go on a treasure hunt instead!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Laffey：</span><br>
Seize the day... And the booty...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ayanami：</span><br>
Will you come with us, Commander?<br>
<br>
It was clear they were all raring to go.<br>
Since I didn't have anything planned for my vacation, I thought, "Why not?"<br>
And so, we embarked together in search of treasure.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ayanami：</span><br>
What do you think this treasure is, anyway?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Javelin：</span><br>
Since we got this map from a self-proclaimed pirate, maybe it's a chest full of gold coins and jewels?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ayanami：</span><br>
I think it's an ancient relic with potent magical powers.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Laffey：</span><br>
I'm hoping it's a fluffy pillow...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Z23：</span><br>
A pillow is hardly worth being called pirate treasure.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Laffey：</span><br>
I guess so... A fluffy pillow made of diamonds, then...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Z23：</span><br>
A pillow like that would be the literal opposite of fluffy.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Laffey：</span><br>
Come on, don't be such a wet blanket...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ayanami：</span><br>
Yes. Anything is possible in a video game.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Z23：</span><br>
A video game? Seriously?<br>
That's just wishful thinking. We don't live in a video game.<br>
<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项1："Obviously."</span>'''''<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项2："We don't?! My whole life is a lie!"</span>'''''<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Z23：</span><br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项1）</span>'''''See? The Commander agrees. Let's at least try to take this seriously.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Z23：</span><br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项2）</span>'''''Commander, please don't enable them.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ayanami：</span><br>
I'll be right back. I'm going to restock on ice elementals.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Z23：</span><br>
It's called "ice cream"... Also, don't eat too much.<br>
<br>
Their treasure talk does make me wonder what we'll find.<br>
That's of course assuming the treasure exists in the first place.<br>
It could be gold, it could be precious gems... Even a soft diamond pillow isn't entirely impossible.<br>
But to me, this adventure is as good as any real treasure there is.<br>
The waves gently crash against the bow of our vessel as we continue sailing onwards to unexplored lands.<br>

<br>
Uncharted Summer<br>
<br>
Stranded... and That's Okay!<br>
Right before our eyes, the tranquil seas turn tempestuous and a storm whips up.<br>
Fierce gales rattle the rails, a downpour showers the deck, and the windstorm threatens to tear our hull in two.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Javelin：</span><br>
Oh my gosh! We've sailed right into a storm!<br>
<br>
"The weather is a fickle mistress. However, our vessel should withstand anything this storm throws at us."<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ayanami：</span><br>
I'm not so sure! The navigation system is on the fritz, and our comms equipment is down after that thunderstrike!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Z23：</span><br>
I'm trying to change course, but it's impossible to fight the storm! The propulsion system is starting to fail as well!<br>
<br>
CRAAASH!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Laffey：</span><br>
Uh-oh... Commander, we just hit a rock...<br>
<br>
Things go from bad to worse. I fear the worst – that we'll run aground. But to run aground, there must be land nearby.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Z23：</span><br>
Oh! I can see something that wasn't visible prior to the storm... Over there!<br>
Look, Commander! An island!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ayanami：</span><br>
Yes. It must be the mythical island that only appears during a storm, where the treasure is hidden.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Javelin：</span><br>
We'll be in deep-sea trouble if we lose our ship... Let's go to that island and wait out the storm!<br>
<br>
"Doesn't look like we have much other choice right now. To that island we go!"<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Javelin：</span><br>
Phew, we made it in one piece... Not dry, though! I'm soaked through!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ayanami：</span><br>
Yes, but the rain is waning. The skies will hopefully clear soon.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Laffey：</span><br>
No need to go looking for shelter...<br>
<br>
A few minutes later, the sun pokes through the grey clouds above. Not long after that, the storm vanishes into thin air.<br>
Then, we see the island clearly, in all its verdant glory. We disembark on the beach and step down onto the golden sand.<br>
Beyond these shores is a lush forest, and then a large volcano rising over the treeline in the distance.<br>
This is probably the most picturesque vacation island anyone has ever seen.<br>
...But, it's not exactly the kind of place you'd want to be shipwrecked in.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Z23：</span><br>
The good news is, we're not experiencing any Mirror Sea jamming. The bad news is... we still can't contact the port.<br>
The storm likely hasn't entirely subsided yet. Don't worry, we'll probably be fine, we just need to wait.<br>
<br>
"I suppose we'll just have to survive on this island until rescue arrives."<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Javelin：</span><br>
Shouldn't be that hard, since we made it out alright!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ayanami：</span><br>
Setting off in search of treasure, getting stranded on a deserted island, and being forced to survive in the wilderness...<br>
It's so cliché, but it's so good.<br>
Typically, this is the point where we explore and gather materials needed for survival.<br>
This place looks pretty big, so there should be plenty to forage.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Z23：</span><br>
It seems today is the day your game knowledge might end up saving our lives...<br>
I endorse Ayanami's idea. To survive, we'll need to learn our surroundings and erect a provisional camp.<br>
So, I suggest we all spread out until evening and search the island for materials to build a shelter with.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Laffey：</span><br>
We've officially respecced as explorers...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Javelin：</span><br>
Sounds good to me! I've been feeling too comfortable back at the port and could use a little adventure!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Z23：</span><br>
Oh, to be as carefree as you three... Commander, what do you think?<br>
<br>
I, too, could use a little adventure.<br>
Who's to say you can't make something fun out of being shipwrecked? They all seem to think so.<br>
"Let's have a look around and see what we can find."<br>

<br>
Uncharted Summer<br>
<br>
Living Off the Land<br>
The forest covering the island is both beautiful and bountiful.<br>
There's sure to be plenty of things to forage here.<br>
Then, just as I'm about to start, I run into Javelin, who seemingly had the same idea.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Javelin：</span><br>
Oh, are you going into the woods too?<br>
Me? I'm going to gather branches so we can get a fire started.<br>
A camp without a campfire is like fish without chips, after all!<br>
And also because I'd like to dry my clothes after that storm...<br>
<br>
"We'll cover more ground if we work together. Come on, let's get searching."<br>
The air is filled by the chirps of birds of paradise. Sunlight breaks through the leaves, creating scattered light dots on the grassy ground below.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Javelin：</span><br>
Hmm-hm-hmm♪<br>
<br>
Javelin hums a peppy tune while collecting dead branches off the ground. She doesn't seem the least concerned over being shipwrecked.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Javelin：</span><br>
Hey, we're safe and sound, and that's what matters. There's no point crying over spilt milk!<br>
Thinking about how to establish our camp is a much better use of our energy.<br>
Besides, look around – this is a gorgeous place to be stranded.<br>
A crystal-clear coast, a vast golden beach, and a truly massive forest!<br>
Frankly, the only thing this place needs is some nice accommodations!<br>
<br>
"That's not a bad idea. I could see myself sunbathing here on a holiday, tropical drink in hand."<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Javelin：</span><br>
Heehee~ Then think of this as the laying-the-groundwork phase of making this place into a vacation spot!<br>
Alright, this should be plenty to keep a fire going.<br>
Oh! Look, Commander! There's a whole colony of mushrooms growing under that tree!<br>
<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项1："We're eating good tonight."</span>'''''<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项2："What if they're poisonous?"</span>'''''<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Javelin：</span><br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项1）</span>'''''Mhm! Let's bring these back to camp!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Javelin：</span><br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项2）</span>'''''Don't worry, I know which ones are safe. Leave this to me!<br>
<br>
And so, we walk back to camp with a hefty haul of firewood and mushrooms.<br>

<br>
Uncharted Summer<br>
<br>
Gifts from the Gulls<br>
I trace the coastline to the east, searching for things we could use.<br>
Turning my gaze skywards, I spot a flock of seagulls circling a stone's throw away.<br>
Where there are seagulls, there's likely to be fish.<br>
After cutting through a beachside grove, I reach an open area.<br>
Dozens of seagulls saunter about the white beach as though it were their garden. And, at the center of them all...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Laffey：</span><br>
Zzzzz...<br>
<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项1："Laffey?"</span>'''''<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Laffey：</span><br>
Zzz... Zzzzz...<br>
<br>
She's sleeping like a baby.<br>
Then, upon realizing there's an uninvited guest in their midst, the seagulls all spread their wings and fly off to the skies.<br>
They call as they take off, incidentally awakening the Sleeping Beauty.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Laffey：</span><br>
Mmhh... That was refreshing.<br>
Oh... Commander. Did you come to nap?<br>
<br>
"Not quite. I'm searching for things we could use at camp."<br>
"Also, while I admire your courage for sleeping out here, you might catch a cold."<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Laffey：</span><br>
I'll be fine. The sun and the sand keep me warm.<br>
I sat down to rest and dozed off just like that.<br>
<br>
"You weren't here expressly to sleep? What were you doing, then?"<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Laffey：</span><br>
Gathering ingredients for dinner.<br>
Fishing, specifically... Do you want fish tonight?<br>
<br>
"Fish sounds great, but you won't find any on the beach."<br>
"You need to go into the water if you want a catch."<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Laffey：</span><br>
Not really. Fish fall from the sky here...<br>
Look. Here comes another.<br>
<br>
She points up at a seagull, holding a fish in its beak.<br>
It pays no attention to me, stood right next to Laffey, and drops the fish right into her hands.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Laffey：</span><br>
Thanks, Blanc.<br>
<br>
"Blanc?"<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Laffey：</span><br>
Mhm. She's a white bird, so...<br>
It's my nickname for her.<br>
<br>
Not only are these seagulls not afraid of Laffey in the least, but they also seem to treat her as their own chick.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Laffey：</span><br>
Try it, Commander. Wave to Blanc.<br>
<br>
I shrug, deciding to give it a shot, and wave to the friendly seagull.<br>
It flaps its wings cheerfully in response, then takes flight.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Laffey：</span><br>
She said she's happy to have guests on the island, and that you can have all the fish you want.<br>
<br>
"I didn't know you were fluent in seagullese..."<br>
And then, me and Laffey return to camp with a handful of fish.<br>

Uncharted Summer<br>
<br>
A Place to Dock<br>
I got a message from Z23, telling me to meet her at a certain spot.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Z23：</span><br>
Good news, Commander. We've managed to survey most of the island.<br>
It's even larger than I thought, and strangely, it doesn't appear in any writings or on any maps.<br>
I'm starting to think we're the first to discover and explore it.<br>
<br>
"It only appears during a storm, yet isn't part of a Mirror Sea..."<br>
"Maybe Royal Fortune's mysterious treasure map is the real deal after all."<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Z23：</span><br>
Perhaps so. That aside, what do you think about this area?<br>
<br>
I'm standing on a beach flanking a bay, surrounded by cliffs on two sides and a flat plain on the north-facing side.<br>
One thing immediately comes to mind.<br>
<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项1："This is an ideal location for a harbor."</span>'''''<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项2："This is the perfect spot to build a factory."</span>'''''<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Z23：</span><br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项1）</span>'''''Yes! I wholly agree!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Z23：</span><br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项2）</span>'''''A... factory? To make what, exactly?<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项2）</span>'''''Sure, there's a forest nearby, and you have ready access to water, but the question is...<br>
<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项2）</span>'''''"You don't need to evaluate it in earnest. I was just kidding."<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Z23：</span><br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项2）</span>'''''Oh, you were joking? Like Ayanami was earlier with her video game talk...<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项2）</span>'''''I'd like you both to take being shipwrecked a little more seriously, please.<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项2）</span>'''''See, what I thought is that this would make the perfect place to build a harbor.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Z23：</span><br>
It's just the thing we need to transport and store what goods we find.<br>
Granted, we don't have anything TO store at the moment, but still.<br>
I say we get started now, so that our rescuers have a good place to anchor once they arrive.<br>
Let's start by making a small pier, then expand it into a big harbor, and finally, build a storage depot.<br>
Does that sound good, Commander?<br>
<br>
"Yes. Logistics are a problem we must solve before we can further develop the island."<br>
"I'm impressed, Z23. We only just arrived, and you've already thought this far ahead."<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Z23：</span><br>
Thank you. The more you plan ahead, the better.<br>
By the way, I found several spots where we can gather materials during my survey earlier.<br>
Shall we go give them a look?<br>
<br>
"Sure. Securing resources is our top priority. If we can map out the island's terrain at the same time, that's two birds with one stone."<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Z23：</span><br>
Absolutely! Come with me!<br>

<br>
Of Mining and Crafting<br>
The giant volcano has caught my eye since we set foot here. I decide to go check it out.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ayanami：</span><br>
Oh, Commander. Did you want to explore the volcano too?<br>
<br>
At the volcano's foot, I run into Ayanami. She's squatting, looking intently at something on the ground.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ayanami：</span><br>
Volcanos have a way of drawing people closer, yes.<br>
If only I had a diamond pickaxe right about now...<br>
<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项1："To gather stone for the camp?"</span>'''''<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项2："You'd need a crafting table first."</span>'''''<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ayanami：</span><br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项1）</span>'''''Not stone, per se, but minerals.<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项1）</span>'''''I found this one just a minute ago. You can have it.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ayanami：</span><br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项2）</span>'''''Yes, exactly! Your game knowledge is up to scratch.<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项2）</span>'''''I've already asked Javelin to gather the wood for me.<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项2）</span>'''''I'll use that to make a wood pickaxe, mine enough iron to make an iron pickaxe, then use that to mine for diamonds...<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项2）</span>'''''Give it a few days, and I'll have enough materials to make a palace fit for a king.<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项2）</span>'''''With tons of underground passages, of course.<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项2）</span>'''''Oh, by the way, I found this mineral just a minute ago. You can have it.<br>
<br>
She hands me a small shard of obsidian.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ayanami：</span><br>
Little fragments like this are all I can get at the moment, since I don't have a way to mine...<br>
Although they are small, they're still dazzling. I'm gonna decorate my tent with them later.<br>
<br>
"It is quite the gem. No pun intended. Also, this volcano must've erupted at some point for there to be obsidian lying around."<br>
"There's a high likelihood there are other kinds of minerals and gemstones to be found here."<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ayanami：</span><br>
Yes, I think so too. Should we take a look around together?<br>
<br>
Ayanami and I briefly search the area for materials before we retrace our steps back to camp.<br>

Uncharted Summer<br>
<br>
Welcome to Camp<br>
As the sun starts to set and I make it back to camp, I discover that the girls have already pitched up tents.<br>
Moreover, everyone is working double-time to get all the essentials set up before nightfall.<br>
After adding my gathered resources to our pile, I decide to give them a hand.<br>
Deserted island - Provisional camp<br>
With everyone working together, we finally manage to light a campfire on the coast.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ayanami：</span><br>
Bonfire lit. Camp level 1 achieved.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Javelin：</span><br>
And we all have proper places to sleep tonight, too!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Laffey：</span><br>
The fire is so cozy... I'm dying for some barbecue...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Z23：</span><br>
Be patient. The mushrooms and fish need to roast a while longer.<br>
Oh, and Commander, I managed to reestablish contact with the port.<br>
I already told them about our predicament, and they're going to send a rescue team that will arrive tomorrow.<br>
<br>
"That's great news. Then we can enjoy this barbecue in peace, knowing help is on the way."<br>
Now the sun has set, night has come, and it's time for bed.<br>
While my food digests, I consider what to do next...<br>
<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项1：(Go to bed.)</span>'''''<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项2：(Radio the port.)</span>'''''<br>

'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项2）</span>'''''Good night.<br>
<br>
A calm breeze blows across the beach, marking the end of our little barbecue party.<br>
The fire crackles softly as all of us retire to our tents for the night.<br>

<br>
The Winds Bring Good Tidings<br>
As the morning light paints the beach a golden color, a battleship appears over the horizon.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Royal Fortune：</span><br>
Avast, ladies! Our destination is in sight!<br>
And boy, what a bloody brilliant sight it is!<br>
Lemme thank you all for being such gracious hosts! The food was scrumptious.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Queen Elizabeth：</span><br>
The cheek on you. Don't you feel the least bit responsible?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Memphis：</span><br>
The Commander wouldn't have gotten stranded had you not sent that letter. Care to explain why you did it?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Royal Fortune：</span><br>
What's there to explain? All I did was share information with my first mate.<br>
We share secrets, so what's wrong with sharing knowledge on some treasure?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Memphis：</span><br>
I don't remember you ever being that close.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Royal Fortune：</span><br>
Let's say we grew on each other quickly during last Halloween♪<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Memphis：</span><br>
By basically keeping the Commander hostage? Sounds like Stockholm syndrome.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Royal Fortune：</span><br>
So? Is a pirate not allowed to take hostages? Hahaha!<br>
Besides, the Commander CHOSE to go on this treasure hunt. I didn't force anyone!<br>
I'm glad the Commander went, though. Sailing into uncharted seas in pursuit of adventure takes a lot of courage! Courage that I envy!<br>
Oh, to seek the meaning of life amid tempestuous storms. THAT is the pirate life!<br>
Not that I expect some desk jockey to understand~<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Memphis：</span><br>
Watch your mouth...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Queen Elizabeth：</span><br>
Calm down, now. On the bright side, nobody was injured.<br>
At the same time, everyone gets to forget their troubles and have a leisurely vacation.<br>
I say let the Commander decide how to deal with Royal Fortune while we enjoy ourselves.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Belfast：</span><br>
Miss Memphis, Miss Royal Fortune, may I interest you in a cup of tea?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Royal Fortune：</span><br>
Cheers, darling.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Memphis：</span><br>
*sigh*... Thanks.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Enterprise：</span><br>
When you think about it, the Commander's made an amazing discovery. A whole uninhabited island.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Royal Fortune：</span><br>
Hey now, the Commander didn't do it alone! I deserve credit too!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Enterprise：</span><br>
I guess so. The shipwrecked thing could've been avoided if you'd mentioned a storm in your letter, though.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Royal Fortune：</span><br>
Err, well, I was so focused on making a fitting poem that I forgot.<br>
At any rate, the Commander DID get in touch with us! It took nearly a day, but...<br>
Alright, I'm sorry! I won't do something like that again.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Enterprise：</span><br>
Good. But if you do, I'll personally bring you to the Commander to answer for your criminal negligence.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Royal Fortune：</span><br>
(Blimey, she's terrifying!)<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Richelieu：</span><br>
Ladies, we've sighted the Commander and friends by the shoreline.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Sovetskaya Rossiya：</span><br>
They built a whole camp in just one day. Talk about impressive.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Saratoga：</span><br>
Hm? What are these coordinates? The supply drop-off point?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Bismarck：</span><br>
I think I see what they're going for. They plan to build a pier.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Nagato：</span><br>
A splendid idea.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Yat Sen：</span><br>
I have to agree. It would be much easier to load and offload cargo and people with a pier.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Vittorio Veneto：</span><br>
It sounds like a fun endeavor as well. Everyone, let's get ready to disembark.<br>
<br>
To be frank, I'm all but floored by the girls' enthusiasm.<br>
They set out to explore the island almost as soon as they set foot on it.<br>
If we keep this pace up, I think we'll have the resort built in close to no time.<br>
But before that, I need to deal with a certain someone who led me here in the first place.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Royal Fortune：</span><br>
Ahoy, matey! How ya been, Commander?<br>
Missed me? Wanted to thank me?<br>
<br>
"Sure, but first, there's something I wanted to ask."<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Royal Fortune：</span><br>
I know what you're thinking. I promise I didn't mean for you to get hurt, on my honour!<br>
On one hand, my carelessness got you shipwrecked, but on the other, it led you to this pristine piece of resort real estate!<br>
So, I'd say we're square, right? I mean, surely?<br>
...Oops, I just remembered I have a meeting with my Tempesta mates. I've got to scurry back home.<br>
Don't worry, I'll be back in a few days. Meanwhile, go on and explore the island!<br>
Until then, keep me in your thoughts – and heart.<br>
And remember, the treasure hunt has only begun. Toodles!<br>
<br>
In a reprise of our Halloween encounter, Royal Fortune disappeared just like that.<br>
I'm not quite sure that she's telling the truth about there being treasure, but for now, I'll focus on looking around the island.<br>

<br>
Beachside Daydream<br>
A beautiful woman stands alone on the beach, bathed in the sun's golden glow.<br>
I daydream of sitting down to appreciate the scenery... until her voice calls out to me.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Taihou：</span><br>
Ah, this weather is perfect – perfect for a date with you, my Commander~<br>
Taihou wraps her arm around mine and takes me on a stroll through the empty beach.<br>
I'm so happy to have you all to myself today~<br>
Oh... You can't take your eyes off my swimsuit – off me, hmm?<br>
By all means, stare as much as you wish. In fact, DO stare. I love it when you do♥<br>
It seems this swimsuit is a winner, because it has already captured your heart♥<br>
And yet, now your gaze is darting from place to place... Are you looking for someone else?<br>
I'm afraid you won't find another soul out here. The only people on this beach are you and me♥<br>
Do you know why?<br>
Because I've reserved the whole beach♥<br>
She leaned in close and teasingly whispered that right into my ear.<br>
And do you know what that means?<br>
That there's no way to run from my love♥<br>
Heehee~ Seeing your anxious face makes me want to tease you.<br>
Yes, it won't do with you passively staring at me. That won't deepen our bond at all.<br>
That being the case...♥<br>
I'll make the first move myself.<br>
Before I can attempt to wriggle my way loose, she grabs hold of me.<br>
You needn't do anything, my Commander. Allow me to take the lead.<br>
Your desires, your body, your spirit... I'll take care of them all♥<br>
Now, close your eyes...♥<br>

Uncharted Summer<br>
<br>
Turtle Sanctuary<br>
After a while of strolling along the coast, I realize I've ended up in the north corner of the island.<br>
The beach is beautiful, with shells of various colors dotting the sand.<br>
A few turtles lie in the open, silently sunbathing. And, what's more...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Laffey：</span><br>
Zzzzz...<br>
<br>
Resting atop a reef circled by the turtles, is Laffey, fast asleep.<br>
The waves splash against the reef gently, leaving behind junk and bits of driftwood in its wake.<br>
It seems this is a place of convergence for sea currents.<br>
I attempt to tiptoe my way over to Laffey, but the sound of my feet walking on the sand wakes her up.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Laffey：</span><br>
*yaaawn*... Good morning, Commander...<br>
The sunshine is so cozy here, so warming...<br>
I was cleaning up beach trash for the turtles, and I guess I took a nap at some point...<br>
<br>
"Can't blame you. Warm, glorious sunlight plus a cooling breeze is a recipe for an irresistible siesta."<br>
"Maybe we should build a beach hut and turn this into a rest area."<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Laffey：</span><br>
A place to sit and watch the turtles sound comfy... I think people would like that...<br>
But at the same time, this is the turtles' home... We don't wanna disrupt it...<br>
<br>
"You're right. Living in harmony with nature matters more than a beach hut."<br>
"Establishing a rest area somewhere else is an option, but all this trash littering the beach will be an eyesore."<br>
"I say we do the turtles a favor and help clean up this place thoroughly."<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Laffey：</span><br>
Good idea. We don't want them choking on bits of plastic...<br>
I'll help. That nap topped off my batteries...<br>
<br>
And so, Laffey and I cleared the turtles' natural habitat of all that junk.<br>

<br>
Fishing Friends<br>
Just a while away from here is a sea bird habitat where schools of fish congregate.<br>
There were only flocks of birds there on my last visit, but now even from quite some distance, I can hear a group of girls laughing.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Albacore：</span><br>
Ahah! Got another one!<br>
Check it out! It's got to be the biggest we've caught today!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ning Hai：</span><br>
I caught a pretty large one too.<br>
At this rate, we'll be set for a quán yú yàn tonight!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Albacore：</span><br>
Huh? A what?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ping Hai：</span><br>
It means, "whole fish feast." It's a full-course meal consisting of fish dishes.<br>
I can hardly wait. Yat Sen said she'll go all-out tonight with tonight's dinner if we bring her enough fish.<br>
<br>
Looks like the girls are all catching fish.<br>
A flock of seagulls off to the side seems to be observing them with curiosity.<br>
They must be wondering how on earth they're getting so many fish when they can't even fly.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ayanami：</span><br>
There'll be a lot of us, so I think we should catch extra.<br>
Oh, that reminds me... I want to try the trick Laffey taught me.<br>
<br>
Ayanami bends down and whispers something to a seagull.<br>
After which, it seems to nod its head and take off into the air.<br>
"You've got to be kidding me..."<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ayanami：</span><br>
Hi, Commander. Here to fish?<br>
<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项1："First of all, what was that about?"</span>'''''<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ayanami：</span><br>
Well, Laffey told me the seagulls on this island are super friendly.<br>
So I told Squawkey that he can sit at the dinner table tonight if he brings some fish.<br>
<br>
"Squawkey? Who's that?"<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ayanami：</span><br>
The seagull. He squawks, so I named him Squawkey.<br>
Oh, look. He's back.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Seagull：</span><br>
Squawk! Squawk!<br>
<br>
The seagull Ayanami spoke to returns to her side and drops off the fish held in its beak.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Seagull：</span><br>
Squawk! Squaaawk!<br>
<br>
It lets out a cheerful cry, as though it's eagerly anticipating tonight's dinner, then flies off again.<br>
It seems we'll have to prepare a chair to seat a seagull.<br>

<br>
Coconut Desserts<br>
Back when I'd looked around the island before, I noticed a palm forest to the east.<br>
When I hear that the Royal Maids were collecting ingredients for dessert there, I decide to go there myself.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Manchester：</span><br>
La la la la laaaa~♪<br>
Ooh! Are you here for ingredients, too, Master?<br>
You're not? You just came to watch us work?<br>
Okaaay... But I'm happy to see you, Master!<br>
Oh, yeah! How about you taste-test the fresh-baked sweets me and the others made?<br>
<br>
Not far from Manchester, I spot the food truck the maids use for cooking on-the-go.<br>
On the counter sits a drink that glows red for some reason and a dessert served in a coconut shell.<br>
("Me and the others"? That must mean one of those ISN'T made by Manchester!)<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Manchester：</span><br>
Overindulging on sweets is bad for you, so pick just one, Master!<br>
<br>
Noticing my gaze, she brings both of the items over to me.<br>
(Manchester's food is so dangerous that she's usually forbidden from cooking. In that case...)<br>
<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项1："I'll take the glowing red drink."</span>'''''<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项2："I'll take the sweets sampler."</span>'''''<br>
<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项1）</span>'''''(It might look terrifying, but maybe the trick is that it's actually the safer one to consume.)<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项1）</span>'''''(...Nope! Absolutely wrong!)<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Manchester：</span><br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项1）</span>'''''Heheh! I mixed chili powder and turmeric powder into the coconut milk to make a special flavor that really packs the heat of summer!<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项1）</span>'''''Do you like it, Master?<br>
<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项1）</span>'''''(Chili powder AND turmeric powder)<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项1）</span>'''''(It'll be a while before I recover from this trauma...)<br>
<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项2）</span>'''''(That glowing red drink looks life-threatening, so it probably IS life-threatening.)<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项2）</span>'''''(The sweets sampler looks much more normal in comparison.)<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项2）</span>'''''(White coconut oil, blue nata de coco, tasty-looking whipped cream.)<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项2）</span>'''''(At least it looks safe...)<br>

<br>
Valley of the Hot Spring<br>
I decide to take a stroll through the forest near the provisional camp.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Miyuki：</span><br>
Ugh... Fubuki, where did you go?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Shirayuki：</span><br>
Commander, have you seen Fubuki around?<br>
Oh... So you haven't, either...<br>
We were just gathering mushrooms together, and the moment we look away from her...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Miyuki：</span><br>
What if some shipgirl-eating monster in the forest got her?<br>
Oh, no... Commander, what do we do?<br>
<br>
"Even if there was a monster in this forest, I'm sure Fubuki could hold her own against it."<br>
"And as long as she wasn't ambushed, you'd hear a struggle, right?"<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Miyuki：</span><br>
R-right... I do feel a little better...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Fubuki：</span><br>
Heeey! Who'd you say got eaten by a monster?<br>
Actually, forget that. I found this really cool place! Get over here! You're gonna be amazed!<br>
<br>
We follow Fubuki's directions and meet up with her at the foot of a mountain.<br>
The valley has a naturally-occurring hot spring formed by geothermal vents, emitting hot water vapor.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Miyuki：</span><br>
C-could this be...?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Shirayuki：</span><br>
A hot spring...?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Fubuki：</span><br>
That's right! It's a volcanic hot spring, at that!<br>
If we develop it just right, we can help our friends relax when they come to the island!<br>
<br>
"A natural hot spring, of all things. I agree; building a resort is the ideal move here."<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Akashi：</span><br>
Hehehe~ Commander, I'm just the cat for the job, nya~ Leave it all to me, nya!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Fubuki：</span><br>
A-Akashi?! You really do pop up out of nowhere when you smell a way to get rich quick...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Akashi：</span><br>
Where there are customers, there is business to be done, nya!<br>
Whaddya say, Commander? Can I get to work on this new venture, nya?<br>
Can I, nya? No complaints, nya?<br>
I guarantee you that my capable paws will make this the finest hot spring resort you've ever seen, nya!<br>
<br>
Overcome by Akashi's strong willpower—or maybe greed—I allow her to begin building a hot spring resort on the deserted island.<br>

Safety...First?<br>
Our scouting and development of the island continue without issue.<br>
In the seas around the island...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Béarn：</span><br>
Our northern patrols are complete. Nothing out of the ordinary.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">La Galissonnière：</span><br>
East's all good, too!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Jeanne d'Arc：</span><br>
The west is safe, as well. Our recon is proceeding outward in the same direction.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Richelieu：</span><br>
At present, nothing unusual has been spotted to the south. Everyone, continue as planned.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">La Galissonnière：</span><br>
Cardinal, we've been at it for so long now. How about we just call it safe?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Algérie：</span><br>
That won't do. We know nothing about this island.<br>
And we plan to turn it into a resort, don't we? We should take safety seriously.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Joffre：</span><br>
Instead of complaining, La Galissonnière, focus on your work.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">La Galissonnière：</span><br>
Yeah, yeah.<br>
I'm EVEN willing to dive and search underwater if it means making sure the coast is clear for the Commander and our friends.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Surcouf：</span><br>
No worries! I've already checked underwater with my mass-produced ships~ We didn't find anything, of course.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">La Galissonnière：</span><br>
I-I was just kidding, geez!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Richelieu：</span><br>
(Hahaha! It seems there's nothing to worry about at this time.)<br>
(But something tells me this island is a little bit too bountiful...)<br>
Regardless, it must be thanks to the blessing of the Iris that we were able to happen upon such natural riches.<br>
We'll leave the next round of patrols to the mass-produced ships. As for us, it's about time we help develop the island.<br>

Get It While It's Hot<br>
The island's development is going swimmingly thanks to everyone's hard work.<br>
The sun sets in the west, and the night sky begins lighting up with glittering stars.<br>
As I arrive back at the camp, a massive steel object erected on the beach catches my eye.<br>
It takes me a second to figure out what it is...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ping Hai：</span><br>
Look! A barbecue grill!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ning Hai：</span><br>
I mean... Yeah, by all appearances, it's a barbecue grill...<br>
But look how HUGE it is! Why would you ever need one THIS big?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Otto von Alvensleben：</span><br>
Capacity. Not only can you grill way much more food at once, but you also keep that smoky flavor.<br>
That is the purpose of the Grillinator Mk II, designed by none other than Iron Blood's corps of engineers.~<br>
Needless to say, we're making enough barbecue to feed an army tonight!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Murmansk：</span><br>
Well... How are we going to get enough ingredients for such a huge grill, though?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Grozny：</span><br>
Hey, we're back. We caught a lot of good game out there.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Yuudachi：</span><br>
I'm eating good tonight! Throw some meat on that barbecue!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Yat Sen：</span><br>
Now, now, we can also grill fish and vegetables.~<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Laffey：</span><br>
I want some fish and carrots...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ayanami：</span><br>
Yes. Kombu with scallops is worth trying as well.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Javelin：</span><br>
Let's not forget about some fruits! I picked a bunch out in the forest!<br>
I even found some coconuts. Can you grill those?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Manchester：</span><br>
Should work, wunnit?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Z23：</span><br>
...Eugen, seeing as everyone has brought so many ingredients, I think we should set up a self-serve area.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Prinz Eugen：</span><br>
Not a bad idea. Wait right here, I'll fetch some tools.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Albacore：</span><br>
Mmm-mmh! This is gonna be delicious!<br>
But those skewers look even tastier. I might just start with those!<br>
Few things in life can compare to a barbecue party at sunset on a tropical island~~<br>
...Hm? What's up, Shoukaku? Not hungry?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">{namecode:95}：</span><br>
I just want to enjoy the sight of the setting sun and the first stars of the night a while longer. The food can wait.<br>
Don't wait for me. Dig in if you'd like.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">{namecode:96}：</span><br>
What she's really saying is that if she starts now, she won't know when to stop, so she'll put on a few kilos.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">{namecode:95}：</span><br>
Shush with you!<br>
<br>
Whether due to the giant grill or the scent of barbecue, the beach has attracted a crowd of curious girls from all factions.<br>
The lonely island in the middle of the ocean is enveloped in a lively atmosphere, becoming a harbor of warmth.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">{namecode:428}：</span><br>
It's been a while since we had a get-together this big.<br>
Oh, and Bismarck, can't you try to relax your poker face for once?<br>
Everyone else is having a lovely time, so the least you can do is smile.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">{namecode:435}：</span><br>
Like... this?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">{namecode:428}：</span><br>
Close, but no cigar. Look here and say "cheese"!<br>
<br>
With a flash from Eugen's phone camera, another happy moment is captured forever.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Avrora：</span><br>
Why don't you have a seat, Commander? I'll bring you a plate of barbecue.<br>
Would you like a little borscht as well? Volga made it.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Albacore：</span><br>
But we won't have any room for barbecue if we stuff ourselves on borscht!<br>
As much as I wanna eat both, my stomach doesn't have that kind of capacity...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Avrora：</span><br>
I suppose so. Too much of a good thing, as they say...<br>
Then how about a toast, Commander? I don't believe anyone has made one yet.~<br>
<br>
She's right. A toast will cap off this incredible evening.<br>
<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项1："A toast! To a fun-packed vacation on this island!"</span>'''''<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项2："To a banquet like this every day moving forward! Cheers!"</span>'''''<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Everyone：</span><br>
Cheers!<br>

Tea by the Sea<br>
Beneath a clear blue sky, a lively tea party is taking place.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">New Jersey：</span><br>
Yum! Nobody makes blueberry pudding like our Belfast!<br>
It tastes like summer – sour-sweet♪<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Yat Sen：</span><br>
And let's not forget these fluffy pastries. They're simply divine.<br>
You must share your secrets after this, Belfast.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Belfast：</span><br>
You flatter me so. I'm delighted to hear it is to your taste.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Nagato：</span><br>
Fresh coconut juice and a sea breeze to cool the body... It's so reinvigorating.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Belfast：</span><br>
I've prepared a wide variety of desserts today. You may pick and choose your favourites.<br>
Master, if I may, I'd like you to try my chef d'oeuvre.<br>
<br>
"Thanks, Belfast."<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Queen Elizabeth：</span><br>
We've earned this break after all that legwork. But, we need to make the most of it, as our work is far from over!<br>
Just look at the hot spring. It's nowhere near finished.<br>
Furthermore, there's untapped potential everywhere across this island!<br>
We could build a water park, holiday houses, and a food court serving cuisines from all corners of the world!<br>
The possibilities are endless, wouldn't you say?<br>
<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项1："This will be the ultimate island resort!"</span>'''''<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项2："We need to think about the environment, too."</span>'''''<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Queen Elizabeth：</span><br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项1）</span>'''''Exactly! However, we must pick up the pace, lest the Sakura Empire steal the show with their hot spring.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Queen Elizabeth：</span><br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项2）</span>'''''You say that like I haven't already, servant!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Yat Sen：</span><br>
Now that the pier is finished, it'll be quicker to transport goods around the island.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Nagato：</span><br>
Aye. Z23 commands praise for finding such an ideal location.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">New Jersey：</span><br>
Speaking of goods, me and a couple others placed an order for something special.<br>
I reckon it'll arrive in a few days.<br>
Betcha wonder what it is? That's a secret!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Nagato：</span><br>
Now I'm curious! Err... By which I mean, you are not ordinarily the secret-keeping type.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">New Jersey：</span><br>
This is a special occasion. Think of it as a surprise.<br>
<br>
This island resort project is materializing rapidly thanks to everyone's hard work.<br>
Aside from the fact I haven't seen Royal Fortune for a while, everything is going swimmingly.<br>
But, I feel as though I've forgotten something amidst all this hustle and bustle...<br>
The question is, what?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Bismarck：</span><br>
Say, the weather is perfect for sunbathing. Anyone interested?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Richelieu：</span><br>
I have plenty of sunscreen to go around, so that's no issue.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Vittorio Veneto：</span><br>
Sounds lovely. Will you be joining us, Commander?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">New Jersey：</span><br>
Throw in a beachside barbecue and I'm in!<br>
Let's go, Commander! Bring your swimming gear!<br>
<br>
New Jersey drags me out of my seat, and that's when I remember it.<br>
The reason we came here to begin with was to look for treasure.<br>

<br>
Titillating Sunbathing Time<br>
A golden beach under the brilliant sun. White waves caress the shore, their sound like music to my ears.<br>
But, that sound is all but drowned out by my racing heart.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">New Jersey：</span><br>
Hi, honey~ Seeing as I've got your attention, wanna sunbathe with me?<br>
Ahh... Chilling on a sunny beach while sipping a nice tropical drink. This is what summer's all about!<br>
Here, honey – enjoy~<br>
Wait, lemme have a sip first! ...Yeah, you're gonna love this. Try it!<br>
With some hesitation, I accept the glass she's already had a sip from, and drink it.<br>
What's up, honey? You're blushing. Sun too much for you?<br>
Ooor, is it the fact we had an indirect kiss? That's no big deal, if you ask me~<br>
Oh, I know. In exchange for the drink, can you apply sunscreen on me?<br>
I love lying in the sunshine as much as the next girl, but I can do without getting sunburned.<br>
...Whatcha looking at, hmm? My eyes are up here, honey.<br>
Checking out my swimsuit? So you DO love it♪<br>
<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项1："What can I say? It looks great on you."</span>'''''<br>

<span style="color:#4eb24e;">New Jersey：</span><br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项2）</span>'''''So you say, but you chose it.<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项2）</span>'''''Hahaha! You're blushing again~ You've got "New Jersey has stolen my heart" written all over your face♪<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">New Jersey：</span><br>
...Whuah! That's cold!<br>
Getting back at me using the glass, huh? Fair enough. Now apply the sunscreen, will you?<br>
Ooh, that's the ticket. Nice and slippery...<br>
So, whatcha wanna do next, honey?<br>
No? Hahaha! I know exactly what you're thinking.<br>
If it's too embarrassing to say out loud then don't. But don't play stupid either.<br>
Oh, honey~ You're so cute when you blush♪<br>
Now get comfy next to me and let's sunbathe♥<br>

The Dark Dragon's Invitation<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">???：</span><br>
You. What do you think you're doing?<br>
<br>
While I'm walking along the coast of the marina, Regensburg abruptly calls out to me.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Regensburg：</span><br>
Don't act like you don't recognize me just because I'm wearing new attire.<br>
I can read you like an open book. Obviously, you're floored by my swimsuit.<br>
...I'm wrong, you say?<br>
Tsk. Fine, deny it all you want, but you cannot hide the desires that urge your body onwards.<br>
Stop putting on airs. Tell me how you really– Eep! H-hands off my tail, you dog!<br>
Hmph. Don't give me that smug look. Misreading you is bad enough without you rubbing salt in the wound...<br>
Ahem... That's enough beating around the bush.<br>
Since you're here, why don't we do something relaxing?<br>
You're supposed to be on vacation, yet all you think about is developing the island. Forget about all that for a while, will you?<br>
If it's yacht races you fancy, you can spectate them from here. And if it's hands-on action you want, I'll fill the entry form for you.<br>
Or, if you simply want to lie down and relax, that's fine too. The sand on this beach is lovely.<br>
...Come again? You want to go someplace quiet to be alone with me?<br>
Okay then... If it's what you want, I suppose I can do that.<br>
Just to be clear, I'm agreeing to this out of my own will – not out of obedience to you...<br>
So, don't you dare say you've subjugated the dragon!<br>
She covers my mouth with her hand, like she's too embarrassed to hear anything from me.<br>
Look, I know. Don't talk – let your actions speak for you.<br>
Now come on. Take me wherever you want to go!<br>

<br>
Exploring the Forest<br>
Near the island's center, a team of girls wade through a forest, pushing through dead branches and bushes as they go.<br>
The sun shines through the gaps between the leaves, casting fuzzy shadows of the people walking through.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Minsk：</span><br>
Hmm...<br>
Huh?<br>
Hey, um, Rossiya?<br>
Was there always a fork in the road here? It's not marked on the map.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Sovetskaya Rossiya：</span><br>
Because it's a rough map. Our job is to fill in the details such as this.<br>
Let's see... There, I've updated the topography.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Soobrazitelny：</span><br>
This is sooo boring... There's only trees, trees, and more trees!<br>
I hoped there'd be a groundbreaking discovery waiting in this vast place, but nope...<br>
I have machines to be working on, but instead, I'm surveying a regular old forest!<br>
Oh, I know! Why don't we just chop down all the trees?<br>
Then we won't need to map out the forest at all!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Grozny：</span><br>
...*whack!*<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Soobrazitelny：</span><br>
Owww! You hit me, Grozny!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Grozny：</span><br>
This forest is the animals' home. It should be protected.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Minsk：</span><br>
Cutting a forest down because you don't wanna survey it is pretty extreme, don't you think?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Sovetskaya Rossiya：</span><br>
It is. While it would net us a lot of lumber, that's not what we're here for.<br>
The task at hand is to catalog the local ecosystem, locate areas suited for construction and resource-gathering, and mark boundaries for expansion.<br>
Additionally, we must completely clear the forest of potential dangers.<br>
Although we have been thorough thus far, it's possible we've missed something.<br>
Be wary around bushes and other hiding places, where threats may lie in wait.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Soobrazitelny：</span><br>
"Threats"? What kind of threats?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Sovetskaya Rossiya：</span><br>
Poisonous insects and snakes and the like. You won't find those with an aerial survey.<br>
An even greater danger lurks here according to those I've spoken to, that being the–<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Soobrazitelny：</span><br>
Whuah?! Wh-what the hell is this?!<br>
<br>
Soobrazitelny stepped on a snare trap hidden among the leaves, leaving her hanging from the tree upside-down.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Sovetskaya Rossiya：</span><br>
...That being the vine plants that ensnare their prey.<br>
As demonstrated by our subject Soobrazitelny here.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Soobrazitelny：</span><br>
Save the explanation for later! Get me down from here!<br>
*cough cough cough*... Damn tentacle plant...<br>
Just you wait. I'm gonna make a bunch of flamethrower bots and sic 'em on you...<br>
They'll find and burn every last of your kind to a crisp... Hehehehe...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Grozny：</span><br>
Soobrazitelny's turning into a mad scientist. I'm scared.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Minsk：</span><br>
Ahahah... I dig your inspiration, but remember, be careful about forest fires.<br>

<br>
We Want Fresh Vegetables<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ning Hai：</span><br>
Hmm... The taste is a bit of a letdown.<br>
The problem with shipping vegetables to the island is that they lose some of their flavor inside the freezer containers.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ping Hai：</span><br>
Then we have to find fresh veggies, 'cause I need your tasty veggie baozis to live!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ning Hai：</span><br>
You won't die without them... Anyway, fresh veggies are precisely what we're here to look for.<br>
<br>
In a flat area to the northwest of the camp, I bump into Ning Hai and Ping Hai having a discussion.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ping Hai：</span><br>
Commander!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ning Hai：</span><br>
Perfect timing, Commander! See, we just came up with a good idea.<br>
Namely, setting up a vegetable garden right here.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ping Hai：</span><br>
If we grow vegetables on the island, we can make fresh meals for everyone every day!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ning Hai：</span><br>
Mhm! What do you think, Commander?<br>
<br>
"The soil is high-quality and workable. Not only that, but it's also close to a water source."<br>
"This looks like a solid place for a vegetable garden, alright."<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ning Hai：</span><br>
So we have your permission? Perfect.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ping Hai：</span><br>
I need some veggie baozis now! I don't have much longer!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ning Hai：</span><br>
I can't make any just yet! Hang in there.<br>
First, we're going to have to level the ground out. After that...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ping Hai：</span><br>
We plant carrots, lettuce, celtuce, you mai cai... and broccoli!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ning Hai：</span><br>
Precisely. Once the groundwork has been laid, I'll tell Chen Hai to send us some seeds.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ping Hai：</span><br>
Woohoo!<br>
<br>
It sounds like the island's menu is about to get even better.<br>

<br>
Early Access<br>
I visit the natural hot spring Fubuki found for the first time in a while. There, I find that someone's put up a sign.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Sign：</span><br>
"Under construction! Do not enter, nya!"<br>
<br>
It even has Akashi's likeness on it. So the hot spring resort still isn't ready yet.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">???：</span><br>
My, do we have a customer trying to be the first to enjoy the hot spring?<br>
<br>
When I turn to leave, I hear a familiar voice behind me.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Akagi：</span><br>
Unfortunately, it's not ready yet.<br>
Heehee, but you don't have to leave so soon. It's okay, Commander♡<br>
<br>
"...Uh?"<br>
Before I can react, Akagi sidles over with a beaming smile.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Akagi：</span><br>
Customers as important as you deserve the VIP treatment, Commander.<br>
If you'd like, just come with me!♪<br>
<br>
She acts like it's up to me, but she wraps her arm around mine like she won't take no for an answer.<br>
"I guess I have no choice..."<br>
Akagi and I walk arm-in-arm through the dim corridor.<br>
"Hm... Something smells sweet."<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Akagi：</span><br>
Heehee, we're almost there, Commander.<br>
<br>
We continue a little further until the space opens up and a steamy hot spring comes into view.<br>
"So this spot alone is finished?"<br>
Pink petals float on the crystal-clear water, and the elaborate decorations around it add to the elegance of it all.<br>
This must be the VIP treatment Akagi was referring to.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Akagi：</span><br>
How do you feel, Commander?<br>
<br>
(I think incense in the air is making me heat up somehow...)<br>
"Is that scent what I think it is?"<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Akagi：</span><br>
Heehee. Why don't you go ahead and get undressed?<br>
Are you having trouble keeping up? You did come to take a dip in the hot spring, didn't you?<br>
<br>
Akagi leans in. Her sweet smell makes me go dizzy, making it even more difficult to calmly analyze the situation.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Akagi：</span><br>
Aww. Do you need my help?♡<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">???：</span><br>
Inside... Here...?<br>
Our intel... Has to be it...<br>
Of course, nya... I paid the fee, too...<br>
<br>
In my daze, I hear chatter from the other end of the corridor.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Akagi：</span><br>
Tch. And after I sent them off to collect materials...<br>
<br>
"Those first voices... Were they Zuikaku and Shoukaku?"<br>
"And that third one is very obviously a certain cat."<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Zuikaku：</span><br>
Ooh! Commander, so you were here!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Shoukaku：</span><br>
Heheheh. Akagi, what exactly do you think you're doing?<br>
<br>
"...Well, this doesn't seem good."<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Akagi：</span><br>
What a waste of this perfect mood.<br>
I thought I'd finally get to be alone with you... Such a shame.<br>
*sigh*... Well, you see our conundrum. What should we do, Commander?<br>
<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项1："I'd better leave."</span>'''''<br>

A Ruinous Adventure<br>
Island - Northern Mountain Region<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ayanami：</span><br>
The time has finally come to explore the ruins.<br>
I've been curious about this place ever since we first arrived.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Javelin：</span><br>
Maybe this is where that treasure lies that Royal Fortune talked about.<br>
Let's head right in and see what we find!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Z23：</span><br>
Not so fast. Commander, we'll go in first.<br>
Don't come in until we've made sure the ruins are safe, no matter what.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Laffey：</span><br>
Adventure, here I come...<br>
<br>
I want to follow them, but they decide against it on account of the risk of traps and other dangers.<br>
"Good luck, you four. I'll be here, waiting for you."<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Royal Fortune：</span><br>
"The pirate life takes you wherever the wind blows. However, sometimes, pirates set up temporary camps on uninhabited islands."<br>
"It's not uncommon that they hide their ill-gotten gains in ruins and task the most vicious monsters with guarding their loot."<br>
"To seize their treasure, one must be brave."<br>
That's the gist of the letters I hid under their pillows last night.<br>
<br>
So she's the one behind their sudden urge to investigate the ruins...<br>
"I haven't seen you for days. Where did you even come from?"<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Royal Fortune：</span><br>
Appearing and disappearing without a trace is key to a pirate's survival. Sorry, it's a trade secret!<br>
I wasn't lying about there being treasure on this island, by the way. They WILL find something, at least.<br>
<br>
"I'm more concerned about their well-being than some promise of treasure."<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Royal Fortune：</span><br>
They'll be alright! Like I said, I'd never do anything to hurt you. Or those close to you.<br>
Besides, if you wanna explore the whole island, you'll end up in the ruins sooner or later.<br>
And isn't finding treasure the reason you set out on this adventure to begin with?<br>
<br>
"Well, I suppose I can't argue with that."<br>
"Are you sure they'll be fine, though?"<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Royal Fortune：</span><br>
Totally, yeah! It'll just be like an obstacle course.<br>
Oh, hey, I just got a cracking idea!<br>
I know a secret shortcut to the treasure chamber. You wanna come with me?<br>
<br>
"But Z23 told me not to go in no matter what."<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Royal Fortune：</span><br>
C'mon, live a little! You'll be juuust fine. Follow me!<br>

<br>
Not-So-Dangerous Ruins<br>
The four girls continue deeper inside the abandoned ruins.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Javelin：</span><br>
Royal Fortune was right! These DO look like pirate ruins!<br>
That means we're gonna find treasure... and a monster!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ayanami：</span><br>
This place is even more dilapidated than I expected. I doubt there's anything of value left here.<br>
We should look for a passage leading underground.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Z23：</span><br>
You expect there to be one?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ayanami：</span><br>
Yes. It's a common trope to have vast dungeons beneath ancient ruins.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Z23：</span><br>
This isn't a fantasy story...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ayanami：</span><br>
While we're at it, we should also look for items and mechanisms that open doors.<br>
Keep an eye out for things like strange keys, statues, stone discs, and unusually-shaped gems.<br>
Oh, wait... Any keys might have rusted away, and those mechanisms may not work anymore.<br>
If so, we'll have to find a big pot or dynamite.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Laffey：</span><br>
Or just blow a hole with our riggings...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ayanami：</span><br>
Yes. Using our cannons is another way.<br>
Smart thinking, Laffey.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Javelin：</span><br>
Wait, are we allowed to just start blasting?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ayanami：</span><br>
Only as a last resort. Ideally, we won't have to destroy anything.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Z23：</span><br>
Okay then... I suggest we split up and look for out-of-place things.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ayanami：</span><br>
Yes. Be careful inside side-corridors.<br>
You never know if the pirates set up traps to–<br>
<br>
CLICK!<br>
A clicking sound is heard as a trap on a wall is triggered.<br>
It shoots out a net meant to capture invaders, but time has weakened the mechanisms behind the trap, and the net completely misses the girls.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ayanami：</span><br>
I was just going to say...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Javelin：</span><br>
Z23! Are you okay?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Z23：</span><br>
I'm fine! Just spooked...<br>
Seems stepping on this tile is what activated the trap.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Laffey：</span><br>
We need to be on our toes...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ayanami：</span><br>
There must be something worth guarding for them to have set up traps.<br>
Be careful, everyone. Let's go.<br>

Uncharted Summer<br>
<br>
Treasure?<br>
Island Ruins - Underground Dungeon<br>
"Countless serpentine corridors combine to form an enormous underground dungeon."<br>
"In every corner and every room are devious traps."<br>
"The rumbling coming from the belly of the dungeon signals the existence of a menacing beast."<br>
"To press forward is to inch ever closer to certain death."<br>
Or so you'd think; nothing like that actually happened.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Z23：</span><br>
Y'know... There's only one path here, and it's more boring than I expected.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Laffey：</span><br>
We're just walking down a normal path...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Javelin：</span><br>
B-but there were traps!<br>
They scared the heck out of us, too!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Z23：</span><br>
Yeah, they did, but that's all they did. They didn't even get our clothes dirty...<br>
Are we sure there's treasure in these ruins?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ayanami：</span><br>
Something's... off.<br>
Have you all noticed it? This wasn't originally a single corridor.<br>
Someone may have dealt with all of the traps before we entered.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Javelin：</span><br>
So you're saying... Someone came in here before us?!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Laffey：</span><br>
They're gonna steal the treasure...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Z23：</span><br>
Let's hurry!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ayanami：</span><br>
*pant*... *pant*... We made it to the end of the ruins.<br>
There's a big door up ahead. If there's treasure, it must be in the room beyond.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Javelin：</span><br>
Hold on a second, Ayanami! Didn't Royal Fortune say there was a monster guarding the treasure?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Laffey：</span><br>
The most dangerous sea monster... I'll fight, too...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Z23：</span><br>
But it hasn't felt like that so far, has it? What if it's just a lie meant to keep people away from the treasure?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ayanami：</span><br>
That may be. Regardless, I'll try to figure out how to open this door...<br>
<br>
The four shipgirls approach the large door.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ayanami：</span><br>
Hmm...<br>
I don't see a lock. No slot to fit anything into the door, either.<br>
Maybe it's the kind that opens through a nearby device or requires some special incantation...?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Laffey：</span><br>
Let's try giving it a nudge—<br>
<br>
The door slowly opens a bit, rumbling loudly all the while.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Javelin：</span><br>
It opened...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Z23：</span><br>
Huh?<br>
It did?! Just from Laffey pushing it a little?!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Laffey：</span><br>
Yeah. It's not locked...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ayanami：</span><br>
Ah! Could this be the Empty Fort Strategy, 32nd of the 36 Stratagems?!<br>
What an incredible stratagem. It had us fooled!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Final Boss of the Ruins：</span><br>
Ahoy, heroes! Ye did well to make it this far!<br>
I've been waiting for ye here!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ayanami：</span><br>
Hm? YOU'RE the final boss of this dungeon, the sea monster who protects the pirates' treasure?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Z23：</span><br>
Um...?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Final Boss of the Ruins：</span><br>
Hahahah, that'd be me! Final boss, sea monster, and all!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Z23：</span><br>
No, you're clearly—<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Laffey：</span><br>
If she's a monster, then we have no choice... Everyone, get ready to fight. We're taking her down.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Final Boss of the Ruins：</span><br>
Avast! Ye heroes who have conquered the ruins, I yield! The treasure be yours, as long as ye spare me!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Javelin：</span><br>
...Hwuh?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Laffey：</span><br>
Thank you, sea monster.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Z23：</span><br>
Again, you're clearly just Royal Fortune! Anyone can tell!<br>
And Commander! Why are you here?!<br>
<br>
"Well, the thing is..."<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ayanami：</span><br>
I'm impressed. You're always one step ahead, Commander.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Javelin：</span><br>
Hey... This is just cheating, isn't it, Royal Fortune?!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Z23：</span><br>
Here I was planning to disable the traps before the Commander came in... Oh! Are you actually the ones who dealt with the other traps?<br>
<br>
"What other traps?"<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Royal Fortune：</span><br>
Ah-ah-ah! Forget all that small stuff!<br>
The treasure you're after is right here!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Laffey：</span><br>
Ooh...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Javelin：</span><br>
Crystals, jewels... Even gold?!<br>
Whoa! This all looks really valuable, Commander!<br>
<br>
(The treasure might fetch a high price, but to me, the girls' smiles and fun are much more valuable treasures.)<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Royal Fortune：</span><br>
Heheh. You get it, Commander!<br>
I'm not reading your mind. It's written all over your face!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Javelin：</span><br>
Heave-ho... Once we've got it all packed up, let's go back!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ayanami：</span><br>
Phew... This marks the end of our adventure. I'm going back to the guild's bar to celebrate.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Laffey：</span><br>
I'm not sleepy... Not one bit...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Z23：</span><br>
Right... Let's collect our spoils and get back to the surface~<br>
<br>
When I'm not close to the four adventurers, Royal Fortune suddenly approaches me from behind.<br>
She hands me a golden compass adorned with a single jewel.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Royal Fortune：</span><br>
This compass is the real treasure. You get it for overcoming the trial of the ruins.<br>
Heheh, though I'm the one who handled the trial!<br>
Either way, it'll help you out someday. Keep it safe!<br>
Anyway, we'll be right behind you before long~<br>
<br>
I try to ask her what she means, but before I know it, she's disappeared... like usual.<br>

<br>
Uncharted Summer<br>
<br>
The Great Deserted Island Yacht Race<br>
It's another pleasant day.<br>
While making my way to the pier, I hear the voice of a certain self-styled journalist.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">???：</span><br>
Agh, the sunlight was so warm and nice that I overslept... I'll just change clothes after I get to the venue...<br>
<br>
Alfredo's running as fast as she can, cradling something in her arms. She's looking straight down.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Alfredo Oriani：</span><br>
Ouch... Ack! My draft!<br>
<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项1："Sorry about that."</span>'''''<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Alfredo Oriani：</span><br>
It's okay, no worries! My bad for not watching where I was going!<br>
Whoa, I'm out of time! Commander, help me pick up my draft! If I don't hurry, I'll be late!<br>
I gotta report on the Great Deserted Island Yacht Race!<br>
<br>
"...The Great Deserted Island Yacht Race? I think Regensburg mentioned that."<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Alfredo Oriani：</span><br>
Hm? You don't know about it, Commander?<br>
Aw, man... If you wanna watch, go to the pier! I gotta go!<br>
Nooo, it's already starting without me!<br>
<br>
After Alfredo Oriani snatches up her draft at lightning speed, she speeds off and disappears into the wharf.<br>
(Now that I'm thinking about it, New Jersey did say something about a surprise...)<br>
(I guess I'll go check it out.)<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Alfredo Oriani：</span><br>
Miss Memphis! Congratulations on securing the top spot of group A! Do you have any remarks for our viewers?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Memphis：</span><br>
Remarks? Umm, w-well...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Alfredo Oriani：</span><br>
Ack, there's no time! Save the speech for later. Right now, I gotta snap a pic!<br>
"Who will be the ace of the yacht race? Our top picks!" Yeah, that's a solid headline!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Memphis：</span><br>
O-okay...<br>
<br>
I go to the pier where the others are watching. The air is full of excitement for this spectator sport.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Enterprise：</span><br>
Oh! Commander, you came!<br>
<br>
"Are you competing in the next race, Enterprise? And the girls over there..."<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Enterprise：</span><br>
Yeah, we're the group B contestants. Our race is right about to start.<br>
<br>
"It looks like Hanazuki and Royal Fortune are joining in, huh?"<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Enterprise：</span><br>
Yep. They're warming up right now.<br>
<br>
"Then the boats in the water over there..."<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Enterprise：</span><br>
You mean Ning Hai and Ping Hai? They're not competing; I guess they're just out having fun.<br>
Once I'm done racing, do you want to ride a yacht together?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Royal Fortune：</span><br>
Heheh, don't get too carried away. You've got a race to focus on!<br>
Keep your eyes on what's in front of you~<br>
I spend all day every day wrestling the raging seas! There's no way you'll beat me!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Enterprise：</span><br>
Hahaha! Well, I guess I won't know until I try.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Hanazuki：</span><br>
Umm... I'll do my best, too, Commander!<br>
Royal Fortune, don't count me out yet!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Royal Fortune：</span><br>
Heheh. Instead of running away, you're coming right to face me?<br>
You've got guts! Bring it on!<br>

<br>
Progress Update<br>
Over in the camp's conference room, a small discussion is taking place.<br>
The topic – a progress update on the island's state of development.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Enterprise：</span><br>
Well, we've established a cargo route between us and the port.<br>
Work on the island's main infrastructure is done too. And the pier can be considered complete.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Akashi：</span><br>
The hot spring is finished too, nya. Drop in whenever you want, nya.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Akagi：</span><br>
Heehee... I'll be waiting for you there, Commander♡<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Sovetskaya Rossiya：</span><br>
On the mineral and lumber extraction front, things are going quite well.<br>
They're currently configured to operate for two hours a day. We also plan to develop them into scenic industrial spots eventually.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Yat Sen：</span><br>
With assistance from Hanazuki, Ning Hai and Ping Hai have got their flower garden set up.<br>
I'm sure they'd love it if you came to have a look, Commander.<br>
<br>
"Flower garden? Last time I spoke to them, they said they wanted to establish a VEGETABLE garden."<br>
"Wonder what changed their minds... I'll look into it later."<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Queen Elizabeth：</span><br>
It sounds like our work on the island is done, so–<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Marco Polo：</span><br>
Not so fast! You've forgotten one very, very important thing!<br>
You're some of the brightest minds I know, so how could you not notice?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Bismarck：</span><br>
There's an important facility that we've all forgotten about? That can't be possible.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Marco Polo：</span><br>
But it is! And I shall tell you what it is... another time!<br>
Worry not, I will personally see to its construction. Just wait and see.<br>
Hehehehehehe♪<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Vittorio Veneto：</span><br>
I don't like that she's making this needlessly mysterious...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Bismarck：</span><br>
(Whatever she's planning, I hope it isn't a nasty last-minute surprise.)<br>
...Iron Blood will assist with the construction. We're free at the moment.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Queen Elizabeth：</span><br>
Ahem. As I was going to say!<br>
It sounds like our work on the island is ALMOST done!<br>
Which I think calls for a grand celebration!<br>
<br>
......<br>
<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项1："Great idea!"</span>'''''<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项2："But Marco said to wait and see."</span>'''''<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Queen Elizabeth：</span><br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项1）</span>'''''I knew you'd agree, servant! Nothing says "job well done" quite like a banquet.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Queen Elizabeth：</span><br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项2）</span>'''''Be quiet, servant! Let me finish.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Queen Elizabeth：</span><br>
We'll host it on the beach near the camp.<br>
I've already been there. It has the best scenery anywhere on the island.<br>
As for the food, the Royal Maids will provide it.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Richelieu：</span><br>
Your Majesty, since this is a banquet for everyone who's helped develop the island, don't you think everyone should be involved in making the food as well?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Queen Elizabeth：</span><br>
You have a point... Apologies. The Royal Maids will take a more supporting role instead so we can all bring our best dishes to the table.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">New Jersey：</span><br>
Sounds sweet! Now you've got me excited!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Vittorio Veneto：</span><br>
If it's not too much to ask, I'd like Sardegna to be in charge of preparing any and all pizza dishes.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Yat Sen：</span><br>
Heehee. It seems I'll be quite busy soon.<br>
<br>
Suddenly, I remember that I haven't seen a trace of Royal Fortune since the yacht race.<br>
In fact, nobody has seen her for the past few days.<br>
I hope she'll turn up soon so she can partake in the banquet.<br>
After all, she deserves recognition for leading us to this island in the first place.<br>

<br>
Learning How to Swim<br>
The beach near the pier. The water is so clear you can see straight to the bottom. Rays of sunlight bounce off the sparkling waves, scattering in all directions.<br>
It is here where a slightly odd swimming lesson is taking place.<br>
No, "swimming lesson" is not the right phrase. "Date" might be more accurate.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Anchorage：</span><br>
Hmgh... There. Teacher, is Anchorage doing it right?<br>
This is how you swim, right? Heehee~<br>
I've never swam before, so I'm a little scared of drowning...<br>
But, you're right here if I need help, so I feel safe!<br>
Your way of teaching is so... umm... gentle! Yeah, gentle! I like it.<br>
I feel like I can do anything as long as I have you.<br>
Anchorage gives me a heartwarming smile from atop her inflatable orca.<br>
<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项1：(Give her headpats.)</span>'''''<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项2："You're doing great so far."</span>'''''<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Anchorage：</span><br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项1）</span>'''''Heehee~ Your hand feels so warm.<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项1）</span>'''''Even though it's super sunny, your hand feels warm in a good way. I love it.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Anchorage：</span><br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项2）</span>'''''Teacher thinks I'm doing great... That makes me so happy! Heehee~<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项2）</span>'''''But, it's not good enough. I need to do much better than just "great."<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项2）</span>'''''So we can both swim together...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Anchorage：</span><br>
Teacher, come closer.<br>
I do just that, and she tries to change directions.<br>
However, she can't control her orca, and nearly falls into the water.<br>
Acting quickly, I grab hold of her to stabilize her. Her wet body feels warm to the touch.<br>
Her cheeks seem to redden, possibly because she's overexerted herself.<br>
Ugh... I was this close to falling off...<br>
I really need to practice with you more...<br>
But I like being taught by you, so that's okay! I'm gonna give this another try!<br>

Poolside Beauty<br>
I decide to pay a visit to the island's indoor pool.<br>
Bismarck is there. She comes up after a quick swim and sits by the poolside. She is drenched – and looking gorgeous.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">{namecode:435}：</span><br>
Whew... My hair keeps getting caught on my body. I should've tied it up before going in.<br>
Fancy seeing you here, Commander. The water is perfect – neither too hot nor cold.<br>
A splendid pool is among the last things I thought we could build on this remote island.<br>
It's a great place to swim, but leaves much desired as a date spot... But never mind that. What do you think about the pool?<br>
Frankly, the main reason I'm here is because she invited me to swim with her.<br>
Not just to burn calories, of course, but also to enjoy some time together. Go on a date, in other words.<br>
"I noticed that we're alone in here."<br>
Yes. That's because I reserved it.<br>
We all want to be left undisturbed sometimes. Especially now, when... You know what I mean, don't you?<br>
Incidentally, I chose this swimsuit myself. I thought you might like it.<br>
It strikes a good balance between form and function.<br>
In truth, I did ask Eugen for suggestions, but all the swimsuits she picked out were...<br>
The kinds that draw undesirable attention. Let's just say that...<br>
Bismarck is not usually one to mince her words. Through squinted eyes, I notice that she's blushing ever so faintly.<br>
Ahem... I see you've done your warmups. Aren't you going in the pool?<br>
...Together? Someone's impatient... I just got up a minute ago.<br>
Oh, never mind. We're alone here – there's no point fussing over appearances.<br>
Go on in. I'll join you in a second.<br>
Care for a challenge? Let's see who's the best swimmer. I'm not going to go easy on you.<br>

<br>
Marco Polo's Grand Ambition<br>
A group of girls are industriously scaling the volcano. They are halfway to the summit.<br>
Aside from the leader, Marco Polo, all the girls bear looks of reluctance.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Otto von Alvensleben：</span><br>
*pant*... Help... I can't keep climbing... I'm too tired...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Alfredo Oriani：</span><br>
We're almost at the summit... Hang in there... *pant*...<br>
<br>
It seems they're a mountaineering team made up of both Sardegnian and Iron Blood girls.<br>
The team eventually reaches the mouth of the volcano. Marco Polo led them there under the pretense that the climb is "a pleasurable hike through nature."<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Alfredo Oriani：</span><br>
I climbed all this way, and for what? There's nothing to report on up here...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Marco Polo：</span><br>
Is overcoming challenges and finding scoops in dangerous places not the job of a journalist?<br>
Don't tell me you're giving up already.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Alfredo Oriani：</span><br>
You insisted that we tag along, that's the only reason we're here...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Jade：</span><br>
But... Bismarck said this is an important mission...<br>
Just... Just hang in there, ladies...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Marco Polo：</span><br>
Yes, exactly. The summit isn't far now!<br>
You must be present for this historic moment!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Otto von Alvensleben：</span><br>
What "historic moment"?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Marco Polo：</span><br>
The moment that I, the great Marco Polo, conquer this island!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Jade：</span><br>
I don't think merely reaching the island's highest point grants you ownership of it...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Marco Polo：</span><br>
Of course not. There's more to it than that. Da Vinci, is everything ready on your end?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Leonardo da Vinci：</span><br>
Ready as can be! Appreciate the huge grant, by the way.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Marco Polo：</span><br>
Magnificent. I'm not afraid to splurge if it means achieving my goals.<br>
Now let's see... Yes, over there will do just fine.<br>
<br>
Marco Polo scans her surroundings. After weighing her options for a second, she points to a flat stretch of land on the summit.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Leonardo da Vinci：</span><br>
That over there? Got it! Da Vinci Express is on the way!<br>
<br>
The sound of a colossal drone booms through the air, and a large shadow is cast upon the spot Marco Polo designated.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Alfredo Oriani：</span><br>
Oh my god...<br>
<br>
A giant monument lands on the summit with a loud rumble.<br>
At the top of the monument is a statue of Marco Polo.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Marco Polo：</span><br>
Yes! THIS is a monument befitting the Sardegnian Conqueror of Islands!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Otto von Alvensleben：</span><br>
Whoooa! It's really well-made!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Jade：</span><br>
*clap clap clap*... (I couldn't care less.)<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Alfredo Oriani：</span><br>
Hoooly cannoli! This is a picturesque statue if I ever saw one!<br>
I take back what I said. It WAS worth it to climb up here!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Marco Polo：</span><br>
I expect you to turn this into front-page news, with a long article to go with it.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Alfredo Oriani：</span><br>
Oh, you bet! I've got a million things to say about this already!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Jade：</span><br>
None of which have any substance, I'm sure...<br>
Ahem. Da Vinci, would you please use your drone to take us back down?<br>

<br>
Revisiting the Hot Spring<br>
The entrance to the hot spring resort, modeled after a torii gate, is adorned with decorations celebrating its grand opening.<br>
With the red envelope of a letter of invitation in hand, I return to the place where I spent a steamy time with Akagi.<br>
When I pass through the hot spring curtain, I'm greeted by a familiar, elegant figure.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Akagi：</span><br>
Welcome, Commander. I'm so glad you stuck to your promise.<br>
<br>
I enter the completed facility. There's a faint sulfur smell as hot spring water is diverted to several indoor baths.<br>
There's a different aroma from the last time I came here, too.<br>
The warmth of the hot spring, the aromatic scent, and the charming decorations give the place a refined air.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Akagi：</span><br>
*sigh*... I wanted you to be the only one invited today, Commander...<br>
Unfortunately, circumstances have forced me to welcome everyone.<br>
(Tch... Foiled again.)<br>
Enjoy a dip in the hot spring, and once you're done, I'll show you where to rest and get dressed.<br>
<br>
(That is how you normally do hot springs, yes, but that's not what I'd expect from Akagi... I can see why she's so down.)<br>
Akagi shows me to the biggest bath.<br>
I get in the bathtub, sink down to my shoulders, and heave a sigh.<br>
The hot water clouds my thoughts, and my consciousness begins to melt into the rising steam...<br>
I suddenly notice someone approaching.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Murmansk：</span><br>
Commander~ Did you get invited here, too~?<br>
The water temperature is perfect~ I'm used to the Northern Parliament's climate, but it's so nice to be all warm once in a while, right~?<br>
Phew... I can feel my body and mind stretching~<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Manchester：</span><br>
Sorry to intrude on your hot bath, Commander! Wanna give my new massage technique a go?<br>
Hot springs boost your circulation, so a massage would go perfect with that!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Shinano ：</span><br>
One wishes to partake of sweets with you...<br>
Yokan and manjuu... If it suits you, please give them a try...<br>
If you desire tranquility after your bath... You may lay your head to sleep alongside me...<br>
<br>
The shipgirls and I have a lovely time together.<br>
The hot spring and massage take all of my fatigue and stiffness away, and I fill my stomach with exquisite sweets.<br>
Tempted to sleep by Shinano's gentle whisperings and the sweet scent of incense, my eyelids grow heavy...<br>
Finally, melting in the warmth of everyone's kindness, I doze off.<br>

Fishing Competition<br>
On a nearby beach, a sign has been erected with a drawing of a fishing rod and a line of text on it.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Sign：</span><br>
"Come watch the island fishing competition!"<br>
<br>
(Sounds like fun. Might as well check it out.)<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Aoba：</span><br>
Good day, folks! I'm Aoba, reporter on the scene for our first-ever fishing competition!<br>
We're bringing you this exciting event live!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Z23：</span><br>
I've got one... Now!<br>
<br>
Z23 raises her fishing rod and reels in a large fish.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Aoba：</span><br>
Ooh! There's Z23 with her signature technique! She's on a roll today!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ayanami：</span><br>
It's not over yet...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Aoba：</span><br>
Why, it looks like Ayanami also has something on the hook! Will she bring it in, or will it squelch its way free?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ayanami：</span><br>
Hoy!<br>
<br>
Ayanami wrestles her fishing rod and pulls a big, white fish out of the water.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Anchorage：</span><br>
Wow! That's big!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Aoba：</span><br>
Hold on a minute... A seagull just deposited a fish into Ayanami's bucket!<br>
Was this planned, or a lucky coincidence?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ayanami：</span><br>
Thank you, Squawkey.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Laffey：</span><br>
I'm not giving up without a fight...<br>
Blanc, Noir, I'm counting on you...<br>
<br>
At first glance, it seems like Laffey won't catch any fish.<br>
A few seconds later, though, two fish land in her bucket, caught and carried by her seagull friends.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Aoba：</span><br>
She's catching fish without relying on a fishing rod! That's crazy!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Laffey：</span><br>
Three heads are better than one...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Z23：</span><br>
Wait, is that legal?!<br>
No, can't let myself get distracted... There! Caught another one!<br>
<br>
Z23 keeps her head in the game and manages to catch another big fish.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Aoba：</span><br>
Look at that! Rather than intimidate Z23, it seems this sudden turn of events only bolstered her fighting spirit!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Z23：</span><br>
You won't win so easily!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ayanami：</span><br>
Keep it up, Squawkey!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Laffey：</span><br>
Blanc, Noir, and now Gris, give it your all...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Aoba：</span><br>
It looks like the competition is nearing its climactic finish! Who will take home the gold?<br>
Once again, I'm Aoba, reporting to you live! Don't switch the channel – we'll be right back after a commercial break!<br>
<br>
...This whole thing sure is quite the sight.<br>
The odd fishing competition continues against the backdrop of white waves washing ashore.<br>

Uncharted Summer<br>
<br>
A Moment in the Flower Garden<br>
The smell of flowers wafts in from somewhere nearby.<br>
Strange. The scent wasn't this strong when I passed by just the other day.<br>
Which reminds me... Ning Hai and Ping Hai originally planned to make a vegetable garden around here.<br>
I wonder what made them change their minds. I'll go have a look.<br>
The once-empty clearing is now overrun with wonderfully fragrant flowers.<br>
Their petals bloom in various colors that complement each other.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ning Hai：</span><br>
We couldn't have made this garden so beautiful without your help.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Hanazuki：</span><br>
Aww, thank you. I'm glad I could be of use.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ping Hai：</span><br>
It smells so good! Makes me wanna plant a few around the camp!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Hanazuki：</span><br>
Oh, I suggest using species native to this island if you want to do that.<br>
See, this garden contains not just flowers picked from the island, but also ones imported from afar.<br>
There are quite a few native species to choose from, including morning glories, daisies, dandelions, daffodils...<br>
Essentially, you can pick anything you'd like, as long as it's not from this garden.<br>
...Oh, Commander! When did you get here?<br>
Forgive me. Once I start talking about flowers, it's so hard to stop...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ning Hai：</span><br>
Good timing, Commander. We wanted to show you our garden.<br>
What do you think? Aren't these flowers really pretty?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Hanazuki：</span><br>
I'm quite proud of them, myself.<br>
<br>
Being surrounded by gorgeous flowers seems to make their smile even brighter than usual.<br>
"They are. I'm curious, though, what made you change plans from a vegetable garden to a flower garden?"<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ning Hai：</span><br>
It takes a long time before vegetables can be harvested. We realized that once we got the seeds.<br>
There are vegetables that grow quickly, of course, but apparently the soil in this area isn't suited for them.<br>
So we figured, "Why not plant flowers instead?"<br>
Because hey, the island is already rich in flowers. Transplanting some wouldn't be too much work.<br>
As nice as it would be to have locally-sourced fresh vegetables, I prefer having a flower garden I can admire all year round.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ping Hai：</span><br>
It sucks I won't get to eat freshly-picked veggies...<br>
But a beautiful flower garden kind of makes up for it!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Hanazuki：</span><br>
Mhm. And I offered to help once I heard about their new plan.<br>
It so happened I needed a place to plant some flowers I'd brought along, so really, it was two birds with one stone.<br>
<br>
"That explains it."<br>
"I saw a lot of flowers while exploring this island, but I never realized there were THIS many different species."<br>
"Looking at them now all in the same place, this island really has a beautiful ecosystem."<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Hanazuki：</span><br>
Indeed. I couldn't have found them all by myself, though. A lot of finds were made by those exploring the island.<br>
By the way, I made a pot of herbal tea just a minute ago, Commander.<br>
If you have the time, won't you sit down and take in the flowers for a while?<br>

<br>
Beachside Banquet<br>
It's another wonderful day. A banquet is taking place on the golden beach, with cheers and shouting filling the air.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Javelin：</span><br>
I've got you nooow!<br>
Hahah! Direct hit!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Laffey：</span><br>
Someone's getting cheeky... It's payback time...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Javelin：</span><br>
Heh! You'll need to aim better if you hope to hit me~<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Z23：</span><br>
You make me feel like a fish in a barrel...<br>
If that's how you want it, I'm going to have to get serious!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ayanami：</span><br>
Just graze her shots. Easy game.<br>
I'm going to use my secret skill – akimbo style!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Javelin：</span><br>
Throwing down the gauntlet, eh? Don't expect me to go easy on you!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Hanazuki：</span><br>
A cup of lemon tea, anyone? It tastes sublime with a little sugar and jasmine leaves.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Hornet：</span><br>
Yo, the pizza's done! Who wants a slice?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Cleveland：</span><br>
Whoa, smells good! Don't mind if I do!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Leonardo da Vinci：</span><br>
I'll have some of that tea, but I'll pass on the pizza...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">U-110：</span><br>
Pizza is overrated. Have some schweinshaxe and sauerkraut instead.<br>
And drink it down with a cup of carbonated coffee. Raaawr!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Albacore：</span><br>
Where's the ice cream? You can't have a beachside picnic without ice cream!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Alfredo Oriani：</span><br>
What the hell, Aoba?! This was MY scoop you reported on!<br>
And this headline – "The Commander's UNBELIEVABLE Hot Spring Affair" – it's SO sensationalist!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Aoba：</span><br>
It's called, "being a better journalist than you."<br>
Don't like it? Then be quicker on the draw next time. Toodles!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Alfredo Oriani：</span><br>
I'm not done with you! Get back here!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Gridley：</span><br>
Let me join the journo club! Nobody covers the topic that is Sara better than me!<br>
<br>
The festivities continue as white waves wash ashore while a salty breeze blows.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Royal Fortune：</span><br>
"A warm wind tells a tale of gold. Though its time has passed, traces of it may be found amidst the sunlit ruins."<br>
<br>
I hear a familiar voice ring out from somewhere nearby.<br>
<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项1："Is that you, Royal Fortune?"</span>'''''<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Royal Fortune：</span><br>
Sure is! Surprised to see me?<br>
You shouldn't be. I couldn't call myself a pirate if I skipped out on such a grand party.<br>
<br>
"How did you know we were having a party today?"<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Royal Fortune：</span><br>
I dunno. Instinct? My gut leads me to where the fun is.<br>
<br>
"Enigmatic as ever. What have you been doing these past few days?"<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Royal Fortune：</span><br>
That's a secret. Mystery and Tempesta go hand-in-hand, matey.<br>
Ooh! Tell you what, I'll talk to you later!<br>
I've got to grab some Hawaiian pizza and barbecue before they're all gobbled up!<br>
<br>
She draws her cutlass and charges toward the dinner table, as if she's going to plunder it.<br>
I feel my lips curve. Her smile is contagious.<br>
I'll save the questions for later. For now, I'll just enjoy the moment with everyone else.<br>

<br>
Epilogue<br>
Evening has come, and the sun is setting on the golden beach.<br>
With the party over, the girls clean up and retreat from the shore.<br>
While I'm admiring the sunset's beautiful glow, I suddenly realize that Royal Fortune is right here.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Royal Fortune：</span><br>
Ahoy! Fun was had by all today, eh?<br>
Crazy to think how quickly this remote island turned into a real resort.<br>
Hat's off to you, Commander!<br>
<br>
"What brings you here? Come to admire the sunset?"<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Royal Fortune：</span><br>
I guess you could say that. But it's not the only reason, of course.<br>
<br>
"Then enjoy the view and stay as long as you want. I won't charge you anything."<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Royal Fortune：</span><br>
Charge? You're gonna start CHARGING for this place?<br>
Never took you for the money-grubbing type, Commander.<br>
...Pfft.<br>
Don't worry. I know you're kidding.<br>
Let's be serious for a sec. You already know what I'm here to tell you.<br>
<br>
"That it's time for you to leave again?"<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Royal Fortune：</span><br>
Sort of...<br>
<br>
"Before you go, I want to know – was this all part of your plan? Or was it really meant to be a simple treasure hunt?"<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Royal Fortune：</span><br>
Heehee~ In a way, yeah.<br>
The treasure map was authentic, and this island was the real treasure all along.<br>
Think about it. The bumpy ride here, the adventure in the ruins, the compass...<br>
The wonders of nature, the sun fading over the horizon, the warm beach, and all the fun activities we got up to over the past few days...<br>
The memories we've made are worth more than any old pile of doubloons.<br>
<br>
"You're right. But which of those things was your treasure map meant to lead me to?"<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Royal Fortune：</span><br>
You mean, what did I WANT you to find? Good question!<br>
I could tell you, but I think you already know the answer after everything leading up to now.<br>
In other words, there's no point in me spelling it out~<br>
Ah, it's getting late... The ideal moment for goodbyes arrives with the evening winds.<br>
It's getting cold, too. I think we should say bye-bye now while we're ahead.<br>
<br>
After taking a few bouncy steps along the beach, the barefoot Royal Fortune turns around and smiles warmly to me.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Royal Fortune：</span><br>
This really is farewell for now. It could be a long, long time before we meet again.<br>
<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项1："You're going away forever?"</span>'''''<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项2："I have a feeling we'll see each other soon."</span>'''''<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项3："In other words, tomorrow morning?"</span>'''''<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Royal Fortune：</span><br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项1）</span>'''''Not forever! I'll be back eventually!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Royal Fortune：</span><br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项2）</span>'''''You know what, I think so too~<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Royal Fortune：</span><br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项3）</span>'''''Ahaha! Not quite THAT soon, I'm afraid.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Royal Fortune：</span><br>
As much as I wish I could stay, the girls in Tempesta need me.<br>
We have our rules, and we all have to follow them...<br>
<br>
A brief look of gloom appears on her face at the use of the word "rules."<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Royal Fortune：</span><br>
Don't worry. I'll write you while I'm gone.<br>
May the winds be with you, Commander.<br>
<br>
A sudden, salty gust blows along the beach, and she is now gone.<br>
Gone with the wind. And hopefully, she will soon return with the wind.<br>
