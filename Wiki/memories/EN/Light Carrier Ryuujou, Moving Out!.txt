Light Carrier Ryuujou, Moving Out!<br>
<br>
Chapter 1: Debut! Light Carrier from the Land of the Rising Sun<br>
The shipgirls are warriors born from the will of humanity, given bodies of steel. <br>
With the power of Wisdom Cubes, the spirits of vessels that fought during the Great War were given human forms.<br>
Now, they aid humanity against their greatest enemies - the Sirens!<br>
Port - Warehouse<br>
The commander, face darkened with dust and grime, is digging through the back of the warehouse in search of rare equipment...<br>
Clang! Bang! Ba-boom!<br>
... but doesn't seem to be having much luck.<br>
Commander looked about ready to collapse underneath the mountain of materials and equipment.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">???：</span><br>
...Watch out!<br>
<br>
In a flash of light, talismans flew forth as if cutting through the thick, stagnant air of the warehouse. And then-<br>
They swerved upward, catching the crate of materials that was about to fall onto the commander.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">???：</span><br>
The skies and the seas are crying for help! The people of this land are crying for help! And now, milord, you too are crying for help!<br>
I am the ranger from the Land of the Rising Sun! Light cruiser, Ryuujou, moving out!<br>
... that is all!<br>
<br>
She beamed with light, as if she was an anime character making her grand debut.<br>
(But what about the explosion special effects? ... Nevermind, let's forget about it)<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ryuujou：</span><br>
Milord! Are you injured? I'm coming to help!<br>
<br>
As the secretary ship, I'm doing my best to protect you, Commander!<br>

Port - Training Grounds<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">{namecode:87}：</span><br>
Phew... I'm totally beat... I can't even lift my arms anymore...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Hiryuu：</span><br>
Haah... haah... I don't think... I can keep going...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Kaga：</span><br>
We're not done yet. Is this the best that the carriers of the Sakura Fleet can do?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Zuikaku：</span><br>
Our seniors are being more strict than usual, eh... Ah, wait, Shoukaku! Wait until afterwards to complain!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Shoukaku：</span><br>
Jeez, I didn't even say anything yet...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">{namecode:87}：</span><br>
A-anyway, since we're all worn out and stuff, cut me some slack...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Kaga：</span><br>
So that's all you can handle, huh? Well then, let's call it a day...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ryuujou：</span><br>
I can still keep going!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Kaga：</span><br>
Hmm, you can still move? Not bad.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ryuujou：</span><br>
It's just as Kaga said before! This is nothing for a carrier of the Sakura Empire!<br>
Crying and begging are useless on the battlefield! True warriors must work hard and settle things with their skills!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Akagi：</span><br>
Hehe, as expected of the former First Carrier Division. Such inspirational perseverance! Kaga, let's continue training!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Kaga：</span><br>
But...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Akagi：</span><br>
So, the little girl who followed Houshou and us around the seas thinks she has grown up... Well, let us see how much you've improved!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Kaga：</span><br>
Understood.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ryuujou：</span><br>
Well then! Everyone, let's keep at it! Let's muster our fighting spirits and work harder!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Everyone：</span><br>
Whaaaat....?!<br>
<br>
In the end, everyone got a double dose of training.<br>

Chapter 3: Focus! Don't stop until you've reached your goal!<br>
Port - Warehouse Workshop<br>
At the workshop, two people are inspecting the materials brought back from commissions.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Junyou：</span><br>
I've just cross-checked with the commission report. The coin and skill book counts are all consistent, and so is the fuel expenditure.<br>
... Want to know something else? Commander used to be an insomniac. Junyou always stayed by their side at night, so she knows~<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ryuujou：</span><br>
Good for you. Anyway, next!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Junyou：</span><br>
Along with the supplies, we've also received a mental unit from Headquarters... The prior year, Commander also took Junyou on a "personal vacation~"<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ryuujou：</span><br>
Good for you. Look over this as well.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Junyou：</span><br>
The number of aviation parts is correct... Ahh... that's right, Commander also promised to marry me after the war ended... I wonder when that'll be...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ryuujou：</span><br>
Mhm. Two more things to look over... I think this commission was a Great Success!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Junyou：</span><br>
Ahh, I'm so happy! I'll be the first to let Commander know, since I'm the childhood friend and all!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ryuujou：</span><br>
Appreciate it. Wait... isn't that your job in the first place as secretary?<br>
<br>
At last, the two of them finished their work.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Junyou：</span><br>
Hey, Ryuujou? I have a date coming up with Commander~ Where do you think we should go?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ryuujou：</span><br>
I don't recall seeing any plans like that in Milord's schedule. All right, that wraps up today's work.<br>
Junyou, I'll be frank. We're very busy, so we can't have you dragging Commander off to a date.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Junyou：</span><br>
Tsk... Well, I'll excuse myself then. I suppose you should report to Commander yourself then~<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ryuujou：</span><br>
... ...<br>
... A date, with Milord...<br>
... I wonder what that would feel like...<br>

Light Carrier Ryuujou, Moving Out!<br>
<br>
Chapter 4: Danger! A Girl's Mysterious Appeal!<br>
Days later - Port<br>
That concludes our exercise. I have no idea why Ryuujou left early all by herself - it's quite unlike her.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">{namecode:89}：</span><br>
So, Ryuujou went missing? How troublesome...<br>
I haven't even seen her today... so I'm not sure I can help...<br>
Since it's around this time, do you think she might have went to the canteen first?<br>
<br>
With that said, we took Houshou's advice and headed to the canteen...<br>
When we got there, an unbelievable scene unfolded before our eyes...!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ryuujou：</span><br>
*Om nom nom*... ...Delicious!!<br>
An army marches on its stomach... Ahh, a hearty meal after a tough victory is what life is all about!<br>
It's not as good as the food that Milord cooks for me, but this is still great!<br>
Ahh, it's not satisfying unless I eat until I'm stuffed!! *munch munch*<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Takao：</span><br>
Ryuujou, please mind your etiquette when eating.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Atago：</span><br>
Ryuujou, the food isn't going anywhere. You can afford to slow down.<br>
You wouldn't want Commander to see you like this, would you?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ryuujou：</span><br>
No need to worry about that... Milord will be in the training area for a while longer! *munch munch*<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Takao：</span><br>
Ah, Commander! Were you looking for Ryuujou?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ryuujou：</span><br>
... .... ... ... ... Ehh?!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Atago：</span><br>
Oh dear...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ryuujou：</span><br>
M-milord! I apologize deeply for showing you such unsightly behavior!<br>
C-could you p-please f-forgive... waaaaah...!!!<br>
<br>
The chopsticks fell from Ryuujou's trembling hands as tears began to stream down her face.<br>
Though everyone was a bit baffled by her exaggerated reaction, they still managed to calm her down with their kind words. It just took them a good half hour.<br>

Light Carrier Ryuujou, Moving Out!<br>
<br>
Chapter 5: Worries! What's going on with me lately?<br>
Port - Sakura Dorm<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ryuujou：</span><br>
I-I'm still full of regret from letting Milord see such rudeness... what a shameful thing for a ranger...!<br>
Ugh...! This thing has been bugging me for so long now...!<br>
<br>
On her day off, the restless Ryuujou was pacing around in her room.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ryuujou：</span><br>
If this keeps up, I won't even be able to do my normal military work, let alone serve as the secretary ship.<br>
<br>
Though it was her day off, Ryuujou hadn't stepped outside her room even a single time.<br>
Before she noticed, she had already cleaned the floor three times, spent two hours organizing things, and hid away all the dolls in her room. When all was said and done, the morning was already over.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ryuujou：</span><br>
Aww, I didn't even have a chance to play the game that Ayanami recommended...!<br>
Now that I think about it, I've been a bit off recently...<br>
I-I'm sorry! I forgot the information you told me yesterday...!<br>
You've come, Grey Ghost! As a former member of the First Carrier Division, I will have my vengeance!<br>
(This will be a great opportunity to redeem myself in front of Milord... Come to think of it, where is...)<br>
O-ow!! ..I-I've been hit?! No way!<br>
Illustrious, even though it was me who suggested to go shopping for cute outfits that Milord would like...<br>
N-no matter how you look at it, there's no way I could wear such... breezy clothing...!<br>
Just what in the world is wrong with me...<br>
<br>
In order to soothe the worries eating away at her, Ryuujou dug a Manjuu plushie out from the closet she had stuffed it in just hours earlier...<br>
And squeezed it tightly while rolling around in bed for the rest of the day.<br>

<br>
Chapter 6: Enemies! The identity of the legendary idol is...?!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ryuujou：</span><br>
I wonder what Milord is doing right now...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Saratoga：</span><br>
Ta-da! Carrier-based aircraft surprise attack!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ryuujou：</span><br>
Haah...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Saratoga：</span><br>
U-um... Ryuujou? Your reaction today was so lame...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ryuujou：</span><br>
Saratoga... I'm not really in the mood for your pranks today, sorry.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Saratoga：</span><br>
Is that so...? Well, Saratoga knows just the thing to cheer you up!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ryuujou：</span><br>
Y-you musn't! You're a carrier of the Eagle Union and I'm...<br>
Even though we're all in the same fleet now, it's not so easy to just open my heart!<br>
But now that I think about it, I heard that you gave tickets to Milord for Lexington's live concert!<br>
As the secretary ship, I can't condone such an egregious attempt to rob Milord of precious working time!<br>
In other words, Saratoga, you're my rival!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Saratoga：</span><br>
I see, I see. You're lovesick.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ryuujou：</span><br>
Eh?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Saratoga：</span><br>
I understand now. In other words, Ryuujou wants to show off her appeal to Commander.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ryuujou：</span><br>
Wha?!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Saratoga：</span><br>
I heard about what happened~ While it may have been a bit of a faux pas, Commander is not so close-minded!<br>
Therefore, instead of canning all your worries inside, why not tell Commander how you really feel?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ryuujou：</span><br>
I-I don't need to do such a thing...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Saratoga：</span><br>
It'll be fineee! Miss Sara wants to see love blossom for everyone~♪<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ryuujou：</span><br>
Saratoga...<br>

Chapter 7: Bravery! Commander, I love you!<br>
Academy - Behind the School<br>
After I finished work, Ryuujou called me to meet her behind the school, saying "Milord, I have something important to tell you."<br>
But she's the secretary ship, so why can't she just say it in the office...?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ryuujou：</span><br>
... .... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ...<br>
... .... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ...<br>
<br>
The awkward atmosphere grew thicker.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ryuujou：</span><br>
Uh... uh... um...! Th-thank you for taking time outside your business hours to see me!<br>
A-actually, there is something that's been on my mind for a long time that I've wanted to discuss with you!<br>
Milord, I would like you to make miso soup for me every day!<br>
<br>
Ryuujou, blushing from ear to ear, fumbled over her words as she hastily tried to explain what she meant.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ryuujou：</span><br>
A-anyway, ever since you saw me at the cafeteria, I've been worried about that day and night!<br>
So, Saratoga told me that... um... as long as I express my feelings... Milord would surely understand...<br>
To be honest, Saratoga told me "If you confess behind the school building, Commander will slam you into the wall and all your worries will be washed away by the pounding of your hearts," so that's how this ended up happening...<br>
Haah... haah... this kind of stuff... between a man and a woman... I can't deal with it after all...<br>
<br>
Even though there was so much that I wanted to shake my head at, her true feelings were undeniable.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ryuujou：</span><br>
Truthfully... I just wanted you to think better of me... so you would turn around and look at me...<br>
That's why... please accept my feelings! Milord, this humble Ryuujou will gladly face any challenge for your sake!<br>
Commander, I love you!<br>
<br>
Will you accept my confession...?<br>
