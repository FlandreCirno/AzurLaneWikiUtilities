<br>
1: A Morning Incident<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Cygnet：</span><br>
Huh?!? I-It's not here?! W-What should I do...<br>
Sob sob...Is this all I can do?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Comet：</span><br>
Cygnet?! W-What kind of equipment is this?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Crescent：</span><br>
F-Force! It's my "bare force" set! It's force-resistant!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Cygnet：</span><br>
Sob sob sob...Comet, Crescent...listen to me--<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Comet：</span><br>
The clothes from your balcony...are missing?! Your drying clothes and the clothes you were going to wash...?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Crescent：</span><br>
This...this is a disaster! But...(Stare--)<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Cygnet：</span><br>
Huh?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Crescent：</span><br>
But they're C Class, too...Why....Sob sob sob...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Comet：</span><br>
Don't cry, Crescent! Otherwise...I will, too...Sob sob...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Cygnet：</span><br>
B-But...where could my clothes have gone...?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Crescent：</span><br>
Is there...a thief?<br>

2: An Interrupted Clue<br>
b<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Foxhound：</span><br>
Heheh, at times like this...just leave it to me!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Cygnet, Comet, and Crescent：</span><br>
Ohhh...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Foxhound：</span><br>
(Sniff Sniff) I'm pretty confident in my nose, you know?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Cygnet：</span><br>
Foxhound...looks like she's ready to bark--<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Foxhound：</span><br>
It's just my nose that's strong, got it?!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Comet and Crescent：</span><br>
I-Is that so...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Foxhound：</span><br>
A-Anyways! This way--<br>
The scent disappears here...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Cygnet：</span><br>
This...This place is...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Foxhound：</span><br>
Yep...The Royal Navy Dorm...<br>

3: Suspicion and Questioning<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Foxhound：</span><br>
I-It's not good to suspect other's so casually<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Crescent：</span><br>
Y-Yeah! We should at least do a little more investigating, right?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Comet：</span><br>
M-Maybe we should ask the carriers about this--<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Illustrious：</span><br>
Huh? Cygnet, is this...winter training? Aren't you afraid of catching a cold?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Cygnet：</span><br>
Uh...Well, it's like this...<br>
<br>
…<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Illustrious：</span><br>
Oh my, this really is...But I haven't seen anything either...<br>
That person? I don't think I've seen her today...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Victorious：</span><br>
Hmm...I haven't seen that person, either...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Glorious：</span><br>
I think I saw her go into her room, that one over there--<br>

4: Caught Red-Handed?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Cygnet：</span><br>
(Gulps) Th-This is the place...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Comet：</span><br>
In the end...we still ended up here...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Crescent：</span><br>
E-Even if it's her, she has no right to do this...right?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Comet：</span><br>
L-Let's just confirm it, we should be fine...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Foxhound：</span><br>
I'll knock, okay?<br>
...Huh? The door wasn't shut all the way?<br>
<br>
Creeaak--(Door Opens)<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ark Royal：</span><br>
T-This is...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Cygnet：</span><br>
Those...those are my clothes...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Comet：</span><br>
Huh?!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ark Royal：</span><br>
WHA?!?!<br>

5: Justification<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Crescent：</span><br>
So it really was her...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Comet：</span><br>
Has it really gotten to this point...?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Foxhound：</span><br>
Have we caught her...red-handed?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Cygnet：</span><br>
Sob...Sob sob...Please just give me my clothes back--<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ark Royal：</span><br>
Eh?! W-Wait, it's not what you guys think--<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Crescent：</span><br>
Not another word! I'm calling the navy now!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Foxhound：</span><br>
So Ark Royal-san finally chooses the path of crime--<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Cygnet：</span><br>
Sniff...A-Anyways, just give me my--<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ark Royal：</span><br>
Y-You're wrong! I just finished a delegation and came back, only to find all these clothes hanging everywhere--<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Comet：</span><br>
Sounds...like a very forced excuse...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ark Royal：</span><br>
It's the truth! I was just about to start picking up the clothes on the floor--<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Everyone：</span><br>
Stare--<br>

6: The Witness<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ark Royal：</span><br>
Like I said! I got back and found all these clothes scattered around, and was just about to pick them up!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Crescent：</span><br>
In the end, considering it's Ark Royal-san...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Comet：</span><br>
Any way you look at it, she was bound to make a big mistake sooner or later...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Foxhound：</span><br>
And we did catch her in the act...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ark Royal：</span><br>
I have no idea how all these clothes ended up in my room, either!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Vampire：</span><br>
Muahahaha...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Cygnet：</span><br>
V-Vampire?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Vampire：</span><br>
You've been so loud all this time. If you're interested, come take a look. It's...to die for, hahaha...<br>
The culprit wasn't Ark Royal-san<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ark Royal：</span><br>
Hahaha...Vampire's the same as usual today...Wait, do you know how these clothes got here?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Foxhound：</span><br>
Does Vampire know the truth?!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Vampire：</span><br>
I saw it all, those clothes were blown from the destroyers' dorms here to the carriers' quarters. The wind was strong yesterday, remember?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ark Royal：</span><br>
Now that you mention it...I left in a hurry and forgot to close my window. No wonder my room was such a mess..<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Crescent：</span><br>
Does this mean...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Comet：</span><br>
Cygnet's clothes were blown away and landed perfectly in Ark Royal-san's room?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ark Royal and Cygnet：</span><br>
Huh?!?!?<br>

<br>
7: Conclusion<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Comet：</span><br>
Ark Royal-san, I'm so sorry...we shouldn't have suspected you so easily...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Foxhound：</span><br>
I didn't exactly make it look like I was innocent, either...I'm sorry.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Crescent：</span><br>
B-But it really looked like something Ark Royal-san would do! Even so, I also owe you an apology. S-Sorry...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ark Royal：</span><br>
You destroyers and your shy, sorry expressions...couldn't be any cuter!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Vampire：</span><br>
But it's true, we only made that assumption because of Ark Royal-san's usual behavior<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Cygnet：</span><br>
A-At any rate, I'm glad we found my clothes. Could you please give them back, Ark Royal-san? Wearing this all this time has been so embarrassing...sniff... <br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ark Royal：</span><br>
I would say seeing this swimsuit is enough to make me forget any troubles, haha...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Comet：</span><br>
This swimsuit really suits you, Cygnet. If I had your figure, even becoming an idol...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Crescent：</span><br>
Hmph, well I'm not jealous at all! Not even a little!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Vampire：</span><br>
Is this what you call "impressive"? From a certain perspective, you could say...this is overpowered...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Foxhound：</span><br>
Hmm? What's "impressive"?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Crescent：</span><br>
From a certain perspective...Vampire won't be outdone...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Cygnet：</span><br>
Erm...Was...that a compliment?<br>
Thank you everyone for helping me find my clothes, and sorry for troubling you all--<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ark Royal：</span><br>
Ahaha, as long as everything turned out okay. All this investigating made me hungry, so let's go get some food, everyone!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Everyone：</span><br>
Okay!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Cygnet：</span><br>
C-Can we wait for me to put on some clothes before going out to eat...?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ark Royal：</span><br>
Huhuhuh, eating with a bunch of destroyers...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Everyone：</span><br>
Stare--<br>
