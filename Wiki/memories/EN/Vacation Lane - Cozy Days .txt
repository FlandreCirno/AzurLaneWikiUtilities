With that chance encounter came exciting new vibes to the port. Now that the Venus girls have time for a vacation, how will they spend it?<br>
Vacation Lane - Cozy Days<br>
<br>
1 Care for a Crepe?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Misaki ：</span><br>
Come one, come all to Akashi's Crepe Stand! We've got more flavors than you can shake a stick at! You name it, we have it!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Akashi：</span><br>
Woo, we're really raking in the money today, nya!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Misaki ：</span><br>
Heck yeah we are! I didn't expect them to be such a smash hit.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Akashi：</span><br>
Well, it was, and you came up with it, nya. You've got the makings of an entrepreneur, nya!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Misaki ：</span><br>
Hehehe~ Please, it was just a stroke of luck~<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Akashi：</span><br>
Oh, we have another customer! Welcome, nya!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Misaki ：</span><br>
Hey! What can I ge– Oh, hi, big sis! And the Commander, too! Fancy seeing you two together.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Nagisa ：</span><br>
W-we just... ran into each other, that's all! Nothing more to it!<br>
<br>
Here I am, with Nagisa, at her sister's crepe stand. You're probably wondering how I ended up in this situation.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Nagisa ：</span><br>
Hey, why don't we go for some crepes?<br>
<br>
Why crepes, in particular?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Nagisa ：</span><br>
Well... Akashi opened a crepe stand, remember? And Misaki is working there, part-time...<br>
A-anyway! I'm in the mood for one! So, do you want to go, or not? I don't have all day... silly dog.<br>
<br>
Ah, so she wants to check on Misaki. What a considerate big sister she has.<br>
...And the rest is history.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Akashi：</span><br>
Lucky for you, we have a special offer for you today! Buy one crepe, get one free, nya~<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Misaki ：</span><br>
Whichever you order, I promise they're all delicious! My personal favorite might be the mango vanilla, though~<br>
<br>
That sounds pretty good, actually.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Nagisa ：</span><br>
Well, if you think it's good, then I guess...<br>
<br>
We pretty much have to go for it.<br>
<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项1：We'll have two mango vanilla crepes.</span>'''''<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Misaki ：</span><br>
Coming right up! ...Hey, something you wanna say, big sis? Is there something on my face?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Nagisa ：</span><br>
N-no, it's nothing! But on another note: it was your idea to set up a crepe stand, wasn't it?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Misaki ：</span><br>
Yup! I wanted to share these tasty treats with the whole world! Oh, and big sis, I'm sure you and the Commander will find your crepes are tastier if you eat them together~<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Nagisa ：</span><br>
I told you! We simply ran into each other... Come here now, silly dog. We're leaving.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Akashi：</span><br>
Thank you for your patronyage~<br>
<br>
Nagisa and I bid farewell to them and go for a brief walk.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Nagisa ：</span><br>
Listen... I was so worried if Misaki would be okay when we first arrived here...<br>
But now that I know she's safe and doing perfectly fine, my worries have eased up a little.<br>
...What? What are you grinning for, you silly dog?!<br>
<br>
Ah, what a considerate big sister she is.<br>

<br>
2 Sandcastle Showdown<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Marie Rose ：</span><br>
Hey, Honoka! We're building a sandcastle! Come on!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Honoka ：</span><br>
Sounds good to me! Let's get to it!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Gascogne：</span><br>
Fetching sandcastle blueprints from database. Proceeding to construction phase.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Takao：</span><br>
Now 'tis time to prove myself! I mustn't let my training have been for naught!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Nyotengu ：</span><br>
Fancy ourselves beachside architects, do we? Well, I shall be waiting to see your finalized creations.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Atago：</span><br>
Ooh, are we all making sandcastles? That sounds like fun!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Honoka ：</span><br>
We need a judge to determine whose is best, though... Oh, I know! Let's have the Commander decide!<br>
<br>
Seemingly out of the blue, a competition to see who can build the best sandcastle began.<br>
After a lot of digging, sculpting, and molding, everyone's sandcastles were finally complete.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Marie Rose ：</span><br>
What did we make? Well, have a look... Ta-daaaah!<br>
<br>
Marie and Honoka's creation is a giant sphere, donned with a necktie and a navy cap. It looks a lot like...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Nyotengu ：</span><br>
Hmm. Nice and round, almost like a delectable manjuu~ Though, it bears more resemblance to a cat.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Takao：</span><br>
It appears to be a massive... Meowfficer? Charming, I must confess... However! Mine has its own merits!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Nyotengu ：</span><br>
Ah, this is a traditional Sakura Empire castle, is it not? We mayhaps share aesthetic tastes, you and I.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Honoka ：</span><br>
Whoooaa! That's amazing, Takao!<br>
<br>
Let's see what our resident champion, Gascogne, came up with.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Marie Rose ：</span><br>
Oh my gosh... It's some kind of arch with fancy patterns etched into it!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Atago：</span><br>
Why, it looks like it came straight out of a museum!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Gascogne：</span><br>
Analysis: this sandcastle was constructed in the likeness of the Arc de Triomphe.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Nyotengu ：</span><br>
Ah-haha! This certainly is beyond my expectations! Fantastic!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Marie Rose ：</span><br>
So, Commander, which do you think is the best? You're the judge!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Honoka ：</span><br>
Whichever it is you like the most, you can only choose one!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Takao：</span><br>
Let your heart guide your choice, Commander.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Gascogne：</span><br>
Requesting Master's assessment.<br>
<br>
It's not easy to choose when they're all so good... Hmm...<br>

<br>
3 Luck of the Draw<br>
Monica asked me to come with her, saying she had something she wanted to do together.<br>
What could it be? Poker? Roulette? Or something else entirely?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Monica ：</span><br>
Thank you for letting me have some of your precious time!<br>
I'm working on one of my important dealer skills, and I need someone to assist. The stakes are higher than ever! Or, I wish I could say that, but just pretend a lot is on the line, okay?<br>
Now, have a look here. There is one ace of hearts, and one joker card. You see them, right?<br>
<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项1：Yep</span>'''''<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Monica ：</span><br>
Good! There's only one rule: if you pick out the ace of hearts, you win!<br>
<br>
I guess I just need to get lucky. It's a fifty-fifty chance.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Monica ：</span><br>
Okay, now I will shuffle the cards. Would you mind closing your eyes, Commander? And no peeking!<br>
<br>
I do as she asks and cover up my eyes.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Monica ：</span><br>
All right, you can open your eyes now.<br>
<br>
When I open my eyes, I see Monica has one of the cards held between her fingers.<br>
Where's the other? Did she hide it somewhere?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Monica ：</span><br>
The other? Heheh, why, it's right HERE!<br>
<br>
Gulp...<br>
She has the other card between her breasts.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Monica ：</span><br>
Well~? Which card do you choose, Commander~?<br>
<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项1：The one between her breasts</span>'''''<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项2：The one between her fingers</span>'''''<br>
<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项1）</span>'''''I reach for the card between her breasts, take it out, and flip it over... It's the joker card.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Monica ：</span><br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项1）</span>'''''Hehe~ You lose, Commander.<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项1）</span>'''''Tsk-tsk, Commander. You shouldn't let your base instincts take over like that.<br>
<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项2）</span>'''''I pull out the card between her fingers and reveal its face... It's the ace of hearts.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Monica ：</span><br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项2）</span>'''''Hehe~ You win, Commander~<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项2）</span>'''''Dang, I was sure that trick was gonna work on you... Oh well!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Monica ：</span><br>
That's all for now! We'll see each other sooner or later, I promise~<br>

<br>
4 Tales from the Sakura Empire<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Zuikaku：</span><br>
Holy smokes, the legends were real after all! We're talking to a real-life greater tengu!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Shoukaku：</span><br>
Shh, Zuikaku. I share your amazement, but it's rude to address someone like that.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Nyotengu ：</span><br>
I do not mind. I've lived for far too long to fuss over inconsequential details such as that.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Kasumi ：</span><br>
I must say, so much of the Sakura Empire feels so pleasantly familiar to the place that I'm from.<br>
I even ran into some girls who claimed to be ninjas! It was so much fun chatting with them.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Mikasa：</span><br>
Hahah. I'm pleased to hear you are enjoying your stay here.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Shoukaku：</span><br>
I've brought some tea. Would anyone like a cup?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Kasumi ：</span><br>
I do not mind. I've lived for far too long to fuss over inconsequential details such as that.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Nyotengu ：</span><br>
They have temples where they worship the gods, and shrine maidens that tend to them. Where, I wonder, do the similarities end?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Kasumi ：</span><br>
Not there, at least. I heard Honoka learned this world's customary shrine maiden dance from the girls at one of the temples.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Nyotengu ：</span><br>
Always eager to learn new things, that lass. Ah-haha.<br>
Truly, this place is teeming with novel and fascinating things. Not least of all, these "riggings" as they call them.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Mikasa：</span><br>
You seemed to adapt to them quickly, almost as though battling comes second nature to you.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Zuikaku：</span><br>
You could say that again... Nyotengu was THIS close to beating us!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Nyotengu ：</span><br>
Ah-haha. You put up a fierce fight, though. I had my share of fun.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Mikasa：</span><br>
Hahaha! I taught you juniors well! Clearly, you've not yet met your match.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Kasumi ：</span><br>
When we first arrived here, I was really worried about how we'd fare... But it turns out I got worked up over nothing. We've all had so much fun already!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Nyotengu ：</span><br>
The hot springs weren't so bad either.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Mikasa：</span><br>
It might be time I visit one again soon... My shoulders have been aching terribly of late.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Zuikaku：</span><br>
Oh, they have? Want me to give you a massage?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Kasumi ：</span><br>
Hehe. It's heartwarming, seeing everyone get along like this.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Nyotengu ：</span><br>
Well, I am pining for a hot spring visit. Will you any of you join me? Your company would be more amusing than that of some wild simians~<br>
<br>
The port's newest recruits bring not only their skills to the table, but a smile to everyone's face. And so, the Venus girls' vacation continues.<br>
