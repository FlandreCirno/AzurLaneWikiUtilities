「On my path of conquest, having yet to witness the light of dawn that I seeked,<br>
I found myself lost deep amidst the woodlands; dim, dark, and dreary were they<br>
Entombed within the darkness of those dense copses, I stood alone, trembling with fear,<br>
and I could do naught but curse myself for my ignorance and my foolishness <br>
O, when did I stray from the path of righteousness? How much time has passed?」<br>
Empyreal Tragicomedy<br>
<span style="color:#ffde38;">Littorio：</span><br>
No... Impossible...!<br>
<br>
The Sardegna Empire was under attack, and Taranto harbor was dyed a burning red.<br>
<span style="color:#ffde38;">Littorio：</span><br>
How was I unable... to foresee an attack like this...!<br>
<br>
Though the harbor's anti-air defenses were firing round after round into the skies, they could not stop the Royal Navy's aerial onslaught.<br>
<span style="color:#ffde38;">Littorio：</span><br>
How were they able to mobilize their aerial squadrons at night...?!<br>
<br>
The ships ablaze painted the harbor an infernal red. It was like staring into the maw of hell itself.<br>
Città Eterna, Capital of the Sardegna Empire - 3 Days Prior<br>
<span style="color:#ffde38;">Kitakaze：</span><br>
There's no way the Sirens are supposed to be here in the Mediterranean Sea. Are you certain your information is correct?<br>
<span style="color:#ffde38;">Carabiniere：</span><br>
Yes! I am certain of it! A large Siren fleet has amassed near the Empire's southern border to the sea!<br>
<span style="color:#ffde38;">Kitakaze：</span><br>
What are those Iron Blood bastards doing, allowing the Sirens to advance this deep into our territory...<br>
(One of our demands for joining the Crimson Axis was that the safety of the Mediterranean would be secured...)<br>
(I was already apprehensive of them when the Sirens dismantled the Vichya Dominion, but now they advance upon us...)<br>
<span style="color:#ffde38;">Littorio：</span><br>
Really, Veneto? History has shown us time and time again that the fruit left for those who blindly place their faith in others is bitter indeed.<br>
<span style="color:#ffde38;">Kitakaze：</span><br>
Littorio...<br>
<span style="color:#ffde38;">Littorio：</span><br>
Since when has grumbling solved any problems, Miss Eternal Flagship?<br>
Our response should be simple. Gaze upon our glorious imperial fleet, and turn your eyes upon me.<br>
We have the most technologically advanced fleet on the face of the continent.<br>
Now look across the land and the sea.<br>
Our land is a hallowed cradle that has given birth to great civilizations and timeless cultures.<br>
If we wish to reclaim Sardegna's fabled birthright, just give me the word, Veneto.<br>
And by our own hands, the world shall know of our glory.<br>
<span style="color:#ffde38;">Kitakaze：</span><br>
R-right...<br>
<span style="color:#ffde38;">Littorio：</span><br>
So, waste no more time being indecisive! I shall personally lead the Imperial Fleet to annihilate these intruders!<br>
<span style="color:#ffde38;">Kitakaze：</span><br>
But... I...<br>
<span style="color:#ffde38;">Littorio：</span><br>
Ah, you are worried about the Royal Navy, aren't you? You fear the same thing that happened to Vichya will happen to us?<br>
If we sit here and do nothing, we will end up just like those Vichya battleships, trophies adorning the Royal Navy's mantle.<br>
Moreover, the fact that the Sirens have approached in our waters might be a blessing in disguise.<br>
Because now, neither the Iron Blood nor Iris Libre are able to make a move in our territory.<br>
And even if they could, they would have no way of assessing our naval might.<br>
So, what do you say? Shall we seize this opportunity to partake in an act on the world stage...<br>
... and crush the Sirens in a show of Sardegna's might?<br>

<span style="color:#ffde38;">Giulio Cesare：</span><br>
These damned Sirens! How were they allowed to get this far?<br>
<span style="color:#ffde38;">Conte di Cavour：</span><br>
That's just how they operate, seemingly emerging out of nowhere. If they weren't so slippery, humanity wouldn't have been pushed to the brink.<br>
<span style="color:#ffde38;">Giulio Cesare：</span><br>
Whatever, just be quiet and focus on the mission! We're here to fight Sirens, not to philosophize!<br>
<span style="color:#ffde38;">Conte di Cavour：</span><br>
I'm just assessing the status quo. It goes without saying that the enemy... shall be annihilated.<br>
<span style="color:#ffde38;">Carabiniere：</span><br>
I... I'm glad you two are getting along well!<br>
<span style="color:#ffde38;">Both：</span><br>
Who'd get along with her?!<br>
<span style="color:#ffde38;">Carabiniere：</span><br>
I am very sorry for interrupting! ... But, enemy reinforcements are approaching!<br>
<span style="color:#ffde38;">Giulio Cesare：</span><br>
Open fire, everyone! Don't let those Siren bastards advance a step farther!<br>

<span style="color:#ffde38;">Vittorio Veneto：</span><br>
Cesare, how did your battle with the Sirens go?<br>
<span style="color:#ffde38;">Giulio Cesare：</span><br>
Nothing but small fry devoid of any thought. Not even worth mentioning.<br>
<span style="color:#ffde38;">Conte di Cavour：</span><br>
That's right. We didn't spare a single one.<br>
<span style="color:#ffde38;">Zara：</span><br>
Makes you wonder what they were even trying to do. Doesn't it, Pola?<br>
<span style="color:#ffde38;">Kitakaze：</span><br>
Yes, Zara. It was over before it even started.<br>
<span style="color:#ffde38;">Vittorio Veneto：</span><br>
You've all done well. Cesare, could you guide everyone to La Spezia? You've all earned some time to rest and recover.<br>
<span style="color:#ffde38;">Zara：</span><br>
We could definitely use it. Should I expect a celebratory party waiting for us?<br>
... Wait... What's that in the distance...?<br>
<br>
……<br>
<span style="color:#ffde38;">Zara：</span><br>
Eternal Flagship, did you request aerial support from Iron Blood?<br>
<span style="color:#ffde38;">Conte di Cavour：</span><br>
No, that's not Iron Blood... Those are Royal Navy aircraft.<br>
<span style="color:#ffde38;">Zara：</span><br>
Should we prepare for anti-air measures?<br>
<span style="color:#ffde38;">Kitakaze：</span><br>
It's probably fine. They've already left our range.<br>
<span style="color:#ffde38;">Zara：</span><br>
Typical Royal Navy fashion. They're more annoying than flies. Anyway... Cesare, your orders?<br>
<span style="color:#ffde38;">Giulio Cesare：</span><br>
Right. Attention, everyone! As per Veneto's orders, we'll head for La Spezia!<br>
<span style="color:#ffde38;">Littorio：</span><br>
……<br>
(Yes, everything is proceeding as planned. Soon, our play will begin...)<br>

The Royal Islands<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Warspite：</span><br>
Looks like the Sardegna Fleet has begun to move.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Illustrious：</span><br>
Warspite, did something happen?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Warspite：</span><br>
Oh, you're here, Illustrious. Come take a look at this photo taken by our reconnaissance planes and tell me what you see.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Illustrious：</span><br>
I can see... Cavour, Cesare, and the Zara sisters... And where was this photo taken?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Warspite：</span><br>
Above La Spezia harbour.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Illustrious：</span><br>
The one located in the hinterlands, yes? I'm sure they're there to rest and resupply after their battle with the Sirens.<br>
But, why would the Sirens be in the Mediterranean in the first place...?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Warspite：</span><br>
I can think of several reasons. While this may be nothing more than the usual poking and prodding from the Sirens, we cannot discount the possibility that this was a test run for a much larger invasion to come.<br>
Regardless, Sardegna's behaviour is concerning to me. The way they mobilised so many capital ships to suppress such a paltry foe in an almost theatrical show of force contradicts their long-held naval doctrine.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Illustrious：</span><br>
Are you saying it was a demonstration of their strength?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Warspite：</span><br>
Hmm... It's hard to say...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Illustrious：</span><br>
Perhaps we should bring this to the discussion table before acting. They might have an explanation that we aren't seeing.<br>
It's not too late for them to rejoin Azur Lane, and if they were to do so, the matter would resolve by itself.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Warspite：</span><br>
You're right. I'll inform Her Majesty.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Queen Elizabeth：</span><br>
So we negotiate first, but still plan for the next phase... A well thought out strategy, so I'll allow it!<br>
Warspite, you do understand the point of this operation, yes? Never forget the pride of the Royal Navy. Put them in their place!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Warspite：</span><br>
Yes, Your Majesty!<br>
However, if possible, I would like to avoid a repeat of the Vichya incident. That embarrassing event affected our standing within the Azur Lane...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Belfast：</span><br>
"A wise general understands how to win a war. A wise ruler understands how to avoid a war."<br>
<br>
Belfast casually poured tea for the Queen as she recited her quote.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Belfast：</span><br>
I was ordered by Her Majesty to deliver these words to you, Warspite, were you to bring up the Vichya incident.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Warspite：</span><br>
Very well... I have faith in Her Majesty's judgement. I shall depart immediately!<br>
<br>
Warspite bowed to Queen Elizabeth, then exited the throne room.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Belfast：</span><br>
"Look after Her Majesty for me," she says?<br>
<br>
I certainly hope it doesn't come to that...<br>
{{折叠面板|内容结束}}

{{折叠面板|标题=Negotiations|选项=5|主框=1|样式=primary|展开=是}}
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Warspite：</span><br>
The Sardegna Empire's territory lies just ahead of us...<br>
It seems there are still Sirens loitering in these parts... Let's stay alert and move forward.<br>
<span style="color:#ffde38;">Littorio：</span><br>
Let me see if I got this right. The Royal Navy came all this way just to ask us to rejoin the Azur Lane?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Warspite：</span><br>
That's right. With the Siren threat looming over the Mediterranean, now more than ever we should join forces and fight side by side.<br>
<span style="color:#ffde38;">Littorio：</span><br>
The "Siren" threat? Surely you jest. Are you not the ones threatening us?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Warspite：</span><br>
As I just said, the Royal Navy is simply concerned with freedom of navigation for all peoples. We have never had any ulterior motives.<br>
<span style="color:#ffde38;">Littorio：</span><br>
So the Royal Navy intervenes when the Sirens attack the Mediterranean, but sit and watch as hostilities escalate between us and Iris Libre, who happens to bend the knee to you?<br>
And now that you've allowed the Sirens to slip into the Mediterranean past your oh-so-vigilant eyes, you want Sardegna to clean up after your mess. Is this your idea of keeping the peace?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Warspite：</span><br>
Littorio, I know you're smarter than this. They may have been mass-produced units, but I find it very hard to believe that Sardegna would not have detected a Siren fleet of that size sooner.<br>
<span style="color:#ffde38;">Littorio：</span><br>
So, if you didn't let them through, and our recon didn't spot them...<br>
... you're saying that a Mirror Sea has appeared somewhere within the Mediterranean?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Warspite：</span><br>
Indeed. We control both entrances to this sea, therefore the Sirens could only have appeared here through the presence of a Mirror Sea.<br>
As they were first spotted near your southern sea border, chances are high that the Mirror Sea is somewhere in that area.<br>
<span style="color:#ffde38;">Littorio：</span><br>
I see. So how does the Royal Navy plan to act?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Warspite：</span><br>
For now, the Royal Fleet plans to scour the southeastern Mediterranean for the Sirens.<br>
<span style="color:#ffde38;">Littorio：</span><br>
Then allow us to assist you with it. You'll have a lot of ocean to search.<br>
Furthermore, the Mediterranean is the birthplace of our civilization. No Sardegnian could sit idly and let the Sirens defile it.<br>
In fact, allow me to make a proposition: how about we use this joint mission as a way to improve relations between us?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Warspite：</span><br>
…………<br>
<span style="color:#ffde38;">Littorio：</span><br>
Did you think we had forgotten about what you did to Vichya? Surely you understand that our trust must be earned.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Warspite：</span><br>
I must admit you have a point... The success of this operation depends on our mutual trust.<br>
Our mission is as follows: search the Mediterranean for the source of Siren activity and eliminate it...<br>
However, I'm going to have to add a condition to your participation in this operation.<br>
No Sardegnian battleships will be allowed to join the search. Violators of this rule will be dealt with accordingly by the Royal Navy.<br>
<span style="color:#ffde38;">Littorio：</span><br>
(Ah, making arbitrary rules when it suits you... The Royal Navy still uses the same old bag of tricks.)<br>
(But just you wait. Soon, you shall all dance upon my stage...!)<br>
<span style="color:#ffde38;">Kitakaze：</span><br>
Littorio, how are matters developing? Is my assistance needed?<br>
<span style="color:#ffde38;">Littorio：</span><br>
Not for now. All is going as planned.<br>
To gain control over the Mediterranean, we will need to break the Royal Navy's blockade. We will need Malta in order to do so.<br>
As long as the Royal Navy has their hands on that island, their little queen will be able to monitor our every move.<br>
On the other hand, if we wrest Malta away from the Royal Navy, it would not be long until the entire Mediterranean belongs to us.<br>
As long as we send a few ships to aid Warspite with her little Siren hunt, we should be able to avoid any suspicion.<br>
Using the cover of night, I will send our strongest ships to lie in wait at Taranto.<br>
At the dawn of the next day, we will pincer Malta while the Royal Navy is still occupied.<br>
Warspite may have a reputation for being swift, but even she won't be able to react to this.<br>
<span style="color:#ffde38;">Kitakaze：</span><br>
Your plan sounds good, but this would be a formal declaration of war against the Royal Navy... Do you really think we can win...?<br>
<span style="color:#ffde38;">Littorio：</span><br>
Veneto, what are we to do if our own flagship is this hesitant about taking action?<br>
You are the flagship that leads the mightiest fleet in the land. You need simply have faith in me and our glorious fleet.<br>
If you're not going to have more confidence in both yourself and in your fleet, then you should just let me be flagship for this operation.<br>
<span style="color:#ffde38;">Kitakaze：</span><br>
Ahaha... Sometimes, it seems like you're the big sister here...<br>
Littorio, you always know what to say when my resolve wavers. Let's carry out your plan.<br>
Well, except that part about letting you be the flagship.<br>
<span style="color:#ffde38;">Littorio：</span><br>
If that is what you want, then so it shall be.<br>
Besides, with you as our flagship, I can dedicate all my attention to fighting instead. One of us will earn their glory in the planning room, and the other will earn it on the battlefield.<br>
<span style="color:#ffde38;">Kitakaze：</span><br>
Hehe...<br>
<span style="color:#ffde38;">Littorio：</span><br>
Now that we've decided on our next move, we should treasure the night ahead of us.<br>
It would be such a tragedy for you spend this night alone, my beautiful signora. Care to join me?<br>
<span style="color:#ffde38;">Kitakaze：</span><br>
Why, I would love to~<br>

The following day - Prior to Sardegna's plan<br>
<span style="color:#ffde38;">Zara：</span><br>
I wonder if all Royal aristocrats speak in such a peculiar manner...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">York：</span><br>
Hah! You may not know the way of the Force, but nevertheless we shall fight side by side and fight our common enemy for this Operation! Let us search for the Heart of Dissonance!<br>
<span style="color:#ffde38;">Kitakaze：</span><br>
Zara... I kind of get what she's trying to say, but what a strange person...<br>
<span style="color:#ffde38;">Zara：</span><br>
Yeah, I can manage. Maybe those Royal Navy folks are just wired differently. Let's just act like we totally understand so she won't laugh at us like we're country bumpkins.<br>
<span style="color:#ffde38;">Kitakaze：</span><br>
Right...<br>
<span style="color:#ffde38;">Carabiniere：</span><br>
Err, according to our intel, the next area we should search for the Heart of Dissonance lies 100 nautical miles southeast of here...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">York：</span><br>
Ah, just what I would expect from a carabinieri – that is, an Imperial Dragoon! Now, using my Thippus Field Manipulation, I can divine our distance from the enemy, but even pushing to level 6, I still can't feel them!<br>
<span style="color:#ffde38;">Carabiniere：</span><br>
I'm level 10! Please allow me to search for them!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">York：</span><br>
Ohh, incredible! You must feel the Force as well...!<br>
<span style="color:#ffde38;">Kitakaze：</span><br>
Psst, Zara... Do you think Carabiniere can actually communicate with her?<br>
<span style="color:#ffde38;">Zara：</span><br>
......<br>
Who knows?<br>
Just pretend not to hear them...<br>

Nighttime<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">York：</span><br>
What?! What is the meaning of this?!<br>
<span style="color:#ec5d53;">Zara：</span><br>
Sorry, what was your name again? Oh, right, "York."<br>
Apologies, but we'll have to take you out in the name of the Empire!<br>
<br>
Fleet after fleet of mass-produced Sardegnian ships appeared out of thin air, completely surrounding the Royal fleet.<br>
<span style="color:#ec5d53;">Kitakaze：</span><br>
Sorry about this. We're just following orders~♪<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">York：</span><br>
………<br>
So this was your plan all along! To lead us here and ambush us!<br>
<span style="color:#ec5d53;">Zara：</span><br>
Yep. Your other fleets are also being dealt with as we speak. Also, we never intended to let you contact each other in the first place.<br>
Now, lay down your arms and surrender.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">York：</span><br>
Hahaha! If this is how you want it, then I shall reveal to you the true purpose of this Operation!<br>
Gaze upon my Secondary Weapons, granted to me by Her Majesty herself!<br>
<span style="color:#ec5d53;">Zara：</span><br>
What...?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">York：</span><br>
Here I stand, trapped in the lion's den, surrounded by the wicked machinations of these fiends. Everything rests on this! I alone stand against the impending ruin!<br>
Yes, Her Majesty's orders were clear - if the Sardegna Empire betray you during this joint operation in their quest to subjugate the Mediterranean...<br>
... then use your Force to reveal the blackness of their treachery with these Divine Cannons!<br>
Cannons of Bethlehem, I call upon you! Fireeeeeeeeee!<br>
<br>
The shell launched into the night sky and burst, casting a light that spanned tens of miles as if turning night into day.<br>
<span style="color:#ec5d53;">Zara：</span><br>
What...?! They prepared signal rounds ahead of time?!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">York：</span><br>
Warspite! Illustrious! Hear me!<br>
Our mission begins now!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Illustrious：</span><br>
Achoo...!!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Warspite：</span><br>
The signal flare has been fired... They should have been wiser than this...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Illustrious：</span><br>
We don't have time to be sentimental. Give me your orders.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Warspite：</span><br>
Of course, we'll take action as planned. Illustrious, prepare to launch your aircraft.<br>
<span style="color:#ec5d53;">Zara：</span><br>
Carabiniere, hurry back and tell our main forces that we've been compromised...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">York：</span><br>
Haha! Now it is my turn to Halt you!<br>
Nothing personal, but I can't let you leave!<br>

<br>
Prior to the Royal Navy's plan<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Warspite：</span><br>
Illustrious! Are you coming as well?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Illustrious：</span><br>
Greetings, Warspite. Yes, as per Her Majesty's orders, I will be accompanying you on this voyage.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Warspite：</span><br>
I see. Well, as I was saying earlier, we are preparing a joint Royal Navy-Sardegna search party to find where the Sirens are coming from...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Illustrious：</span><br>
But you're wary about their motives for agreeing to your terms so readily?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Warspite：</span><br>
You're quite perceptive, as always. Something seemed suspicious about the plan they proposed.<br>
They claimed that they wanted to carry out this search operation at nighttime because the Sirens are supposedly more active then.<br>
But, it just so happens that our patrol units at Malta don't operate at night. There's a possibility that they want to seize on that opportunity.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Illustrious：</span><br>
Yes, I made some preparations for that very scenario before I got here.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Warspite：</span><br>
You... did what? In any case, we don't have any proof that the Sardegnians are actually plotting something...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Illustrious：</span><br>
Call it a woman's intuition, but I already consulted with Her Majesty about this.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Warspite：</span><br>
A... woman's intuition?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Illustrious：</span><br>
Don't you know that this ability is sometimes more fearsome than the most brilliant tactical mind?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Warspite：</span><br>
Listen, you...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Illustrious：</span><br>
I have prepared countermeasures and a follow-up plan in case the Sardegnians would do anything that's not in our best interest. Oh, I've also prepared...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Warspite：</span><br>
... What are those? Flares?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Illustrious：</span><br>
Correct. But we need someone who can use them to signal us if something happens...<br>
……<br>
<br>
At that time, York happened to be passing by.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Illustrious：</span><br>
Yes, you're perfect!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">York：</span><br>
Huh? Whaaaat?<br>

<br>
Just prior to the Royal Navy embarking on the Siren hunt<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">York：</span><br>
So... the green one means "Siren base found and destroyed," blue means "requesting support," and red means "Sardegnians have betrayed us," if I'm not mistaken?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Illustrious：</span><br>
That's it. Could you please load your cannons with them now?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">York：</span><br>
Of course! Now I need to come up with a name for this manoeuvre... hmm... I'll have to do it later, for we're short on time.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Illustrious：</span><br>
Indeed, the Sardegnians will be grouping up with us any minute now. No matter what happens, God save the Queen.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">York：</span><br>
God save the Queen!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Warspite：</span><br>
………………<br>
Say York actually does fire the red flare to signal she's been attacked... what happens then, Illustrious?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Illustrious：</span><br>
I can only hope that it doesn't come to that...<br>
But, if it does happen, we will simply have to spank some naughty children~<br>

Ugh... why...?!<br>
<span style="color:#ec5d53;">Littorio：</span><br>
Impossible... How dare they...!<br>
<br>
Taranto harbor had become a sea of flames under the moonlight.<br>
<span style="color:#ec5d53;">Littorio：</span><br>
How did they know... to take advantage of us while our forces were split...?!<br>
<br>
In addition to having lost the initiative, the Sardegnian forces were unable to muster their anti-air defenses due to the poor visibility.<br>
<span style="color:#ec5d53;">Littorio：</span><br>
How were they able to mobilize their aerial squadrons at night...?!<br>
<br>
The ships staying in the harbor were gasping for air amidst all the fire and smoke.<br>
<span style="color:#ec5d53;">Kitakaze：</span><br>
They completely saw through us...<br>
<span style="color:#ec5d53;">Littorio：</span><br>
How did they anticipate that we'd redeploy our battleships here...?<br>
And how are they operating their air wings at night? I've never heard of this before!<br>
<span style="color:#ec5d53;">Kitakaze：</span><br>
Littorio, order everyone to retreat. We've been completely defeated.<br>
<span style="color:#ec5d53;">Littorio：</span><br>
No, Veneto, it's not over yet. If we can take out the enemy carrier, then we can seize Malta before dawn comes. Then the Royal Navy will have their hands tied without their precious intel.<br>
Attention, all battleships! We are evacuating the harbor! Find and put an end to the carrier launching these planes!<br>

<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Illustrious：</span><br>
I've been waiting for you. I am Illustrious, the Illustrious-class armoured aircraft carrier.<br>
<span style="color:#ec5d53;">Littorio：</span><br>
Tell me this, Illustrious: how did the Royal Navy deduce that we would transfer our battleships over to Taranto harbor?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Illustrious：</span><br>
It was quite easy, really... If we were in your position, we would have done the same thing.<br>
<span style="color:#ec5d53;">Littorio：</span><br>
Now you've said it... Are you also the one responsible for this bombing?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Illustrious：</span><br>
Correct. Those Swordfish squadrons are all my prided children.<br>
<span style="color:#ec5d53;">Littorio：</span><br>
What a magnificent woman. If you were Sardegnian, I might have fallen for you.<br>
But after what you've done, I'm afraid I have to destroy you.<br>
Remember this name - I am Littorio, Veneto-class battleship of the Sardegna Empire! En garde, signora!<br>

<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Illustrious：</span><br>
(My hangar has taken damage... Her firepower might even be greater than Her Majesty's...)<br>
<span style="color:#ec5d53;">Littorio：</span><br>
(Taking one of my salvos head on and still being able to stand... so this is the famed armored carrier...)<br>
Make this easier for us both and surrender. You've done us wrong, but your fate need not be to end up at the bottom of the Mediterra–<br>
More Swordfish...! But it'll take more than that...!<br>
Behold, the Pugliese system! Your little toys cannot sink me!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Illustrious：</span><br>
What...! Even though I've struck her with so many torpedoes...<br>
<span style="color:#ec5d53;">Littorio：</span><br>
Nngh...! A battleship salvo?!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Warspite：</span><br>
Illustrious, get back! Sardegnian battleships are coming!<br>
<span style="color:#ec5d53;">Littorio：</span><br>
Gah... I won't let you get away!<br>
<br>
BOOOOOOM!<br>
<span style="color:#ec5d53;">Littorio：</span><br>
Aaagh! My steering gear...!<br>
<br>
The Pugliese system absorbed some of the torpedo impact, but the impact angle had already caused flooding into the cabin, slowing Littorio's movement.<br>
<span style="color:#ec5d53;">Littorio：</span><br>
......<br>
<br>
Littorio recognized her defeat, but instead turned towards her foes with bravado.<br>
<span style="color:#ec5d53;">Littorio：</span><br>
Signora Illustrious, it seems this victory is yours. Bitter as that may be, getting to witness your captivating beauty is almost as good as victory itself.<br>
Hah... to think a ship even more glorious than me could exist in this world!<br>
Lovely signora, I promise you we shall meet again. Hahahaha!<br>
<br>
Littorio turned her back to the Royal Navy's fleet and withdrew from the battlefield.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Illustrious：</span><br>
So that's the Sardegnia Empire's battleship, Littorio... Still trying to show off even after taking so many hits...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Warspite：</span><br>
It's not every day I see you having trouble with an opponent. Are you all right, Illustrious?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Illustrious：</span><br>
Yes, somehow. But I feel like this isn't the last time that we'll meet...<br>

<br>
At the edge of that gloomy forest, three beasts blocked my path<br>
There was the Leopard,<br>
its coat dazzling with many colors<br>
There was the Lion, <br>
its head ringed with a proud mane<br>
And there was the She-Wolf,<br>
its body emaciated, mad with hunger<br>
They surrounded me, their ravenous intentions dripping from their mouths<br>
Little by little, step by ominous step, they advanced on me; I looked desperately back toward the dark forest<br>
A place where even the light of the sun itself had been snuffed out...<br>
The Royal Islands<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Illustrious：</span><br>
Victorious, Formidable, the tea's going to go cold.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Victorious：</span><br>
Ahahaha... It was so pleasant and warm outside that I ended up dozing off...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Formidable：</span><br>
That's Victorious for you. Good day, Illustrious.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Victorious：</span><br>
Hey, Formidable, I didn't appreciate that extra comment!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Illustrious：</span><br>
Calm down, you two. It feels like it's been ages since we've all sat down together for tea.<br>
Oh, Victorious, how did your shakedown cruise go?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Victorious：</span><br>
Err, there was a spot of trouble I guess? They said it might be a while before I'd be able to deploy~<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Illustrious：</span><br>
That means your little sister is going into active service before you. You'll have to redouble your efforts to match her.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Victorious：</span><br>
But of course! I shall be victorious! For my sisters, and for Her Majesty!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Illustrious：</span><br>
Pfft... Actually, I'm afraid there's a more important matter for which I've called you two here...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Formidable：</span><br>
You're getting married?!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Illustrious：</span><br>
Heavens, no! *cough* *cough*<br>
<br>
Illustrious turned bright red and nearly spilled her tea.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Formidable：</span><br>
Aw.......<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Illustrious：</span><br>
It's unbecoming of a Lady to joke about such things.. Hmph~<br>
Anyway, I did say it was an important matter, but...<br>
Could I interest the two of you in a trip to the Mediterranean?<br>

<br>
Città Eterna - Capital of the Sardegna Empire<br>
<span style="color:#ec5d53;">Kitakaze：</span><br>
...<br>
......<br>
Ah, um... can you stop doing that...<br>
<br>
Vittorio Veneto spoke up, unable to take Littorio's pacing around the palace any longer.<br>
<span style="color:#ec5d53;">Littorio：</span><br>
Hmm... Hmmmmmm...<br>
It is time to make a choice.<br>
<span style="color:#ec5d53;">Kitakaze：</span><br>
Indeed... I understand the Royal Navy has bolstered their strength in the Mediterranean...<br>
<span style="color:#ec5d53;">Littorio：</span><br>
Which would be more suitable, competition swimwear, or a bikini?<br>
<span style="color:#ec5d53;">Kitakaze：</span><br>
Hmm... I heard bikinis were all the rage these days...<br>
Wait, what...?<br>
<span style="color:#ec5d53;">Littorio：</span><br>
I heard that the three Illustrious sisters have been deployed to the Mediterranean. This is an opportunity that we cannot miss.<br>
<span style="color:#ec5d53;">Kitakaze：</span><br>
Um... Littorio? I'm beginning to suspect we aren't talking about the same thing.<br>
<span style="color:#ec5d53;">Littorio：</span><br>
Was the strategic plan to handle the Illustrious-class aircraft carriers not on the agenda?<br>
<span style="color:#ec5d53;">Kitakaze：</span><br>
I did say that, but... (I'm concerned. I hope that wasn't a pun...)<br>
(Littorio has been acting strange ever since the Battle of Taranto...)<br>
(It must be some sort of post-traumatic stress... Poor girl.)<br>
<span style="color:#ec5d53;">Littorio：</span><br>
Veneto, the truth is, I received a telegram from Illustrious some time ago.<br>
"To The Jewel of Calabria, the Most Resplendent One, Her Majesty the Queen hopes that our differences may become as water under the bridge."<br>
"PS: I am bringing my two little sisters."<br>
<span style="color:#ec5d53;">Kitakaze：</span><br>
Um, what's the point of this?<br>
<span style="color:#ec5d53;">Littorio：</span><br>
Ahh, do you not see the value of this opportunity? We must seize it with both hands!<br>
This is a prime opportunity to lay Illustrious bare and expose her secrets!<br>
An aircraft carrier who can launch planes in the dead of night, and with such unreasonably thick armor...<br>
Since that defeat, we have been groping in the dark to understand how that fateful night unfolded. But now, we can make them ours.<br>
We shall pad our technology with theirs, milk it for all it's worth, and usher in a new age of Sardegnian glory!<br>
<span style="color:#ec5d53;">Kitakaze：</span><br>
... When you put it that way, I can see your logic...<br>
The Senate responsible for keeping abreast of the situation with the Iron Blood and Royal Navy remains paralyzed by political infighting.<br>
The power struggles continue while the Sardegna Fleet stagnates. At this rate...<br>
<span style="color:#ec5d53;">Littorio：</span><br>
You're right. The Iron Blood seems to be losing patience with us since the Battle of Taranto.<br>
Not to mention the Sirens, whose numbers in the Mediterranean seem to grow by the day. They're watching our every move.<br>
<span style="color:#ec5d53;">Kitakaze：</span><br>
Littorio, I just had an idea.<br>
There must be a reason why the Royal Navy reached out to us, and we should not let it slip past us.<br>
Who are our allies, who are our enemies, and who remains an "actor" until the very end...<br>
Let us conduct a little experiment of our own.<br>
This was the "play" that you had wanted, is it not?<br>
<span style="color:#ec5d53;">Littorio：</span><br>
Yes... My thoughts exactly.<br>
Now then, Great Flagship, my sweet signora...<br>
<span style="color:#ec5d53;">Kitakaze：</span><br>
Err, what now...?<br>
<span style="color:#ec5d53;">Littorio：</span><br>
It is time to make your decision... on which swimsuit to wear!<br>
<span style="color:#ec5d53;">Kitakaze：</span><br>
Huh...?! Littorio, whyyyyyy...?!<br>

<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Formidable：</span><br>
I didn't expect such an... extravagant welcome from the Sardegna Fleet...<br>
<span style="color:#ec5d53;">Carabiniere：</span><br>
Lady Veneto instructed me to show the Ladies of the Royal Navy our Mediterranean hospitality.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Formidable：</span><br>
(What is this "Jewel of Calabria" that Her Majesty spoke of...?)<br>
W-wait! You're going to get my new clothes dirty!<br>
<span style="color:#ec5d53;">Carabiniere：</span><br>
Please forgive me for my indiscretion!<br>
{{折叠面板|内容结束}}

{{折叠面板|标题=The Destination|选项=16|主框=1|样式=primary|展开=是}}
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Formidable：</span><br>
... Your scurrying back and forth is giving me a headache.<br>
<br>
Carabiniere made use of her agility to avoid the carrier's attacks while gradually closing the distance between them, poking and prodding at Formidable with her guns.<br>
<span style="color:#ec5d53;">Carabiniere：</span><br>
Hah! My very name comes from a centuries-old type of Sardegnian light cavalry.<br>
Using rapid movements to confuse our enemies while I wait for the perfect moment to strike true, that is my fighting style.<br>
Miss Formidable, a lumbering carrier like you has no chance of keeping up with my speed!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Formidable：</span><br>
... I beg your pardon?!<br>
<br>
Formidable raised an eyebrow, giving off an uncharacteristically vexed aura.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Formidable：</span><br>
You... take that back!<br>
Who. Did. You. Call. Lumbering?!<br>
<br>
Carabiniere was taken back by Formidable's pouty lips and the tears welling up in the corners of her eyes.<br>
<span style="color:#ec5d53;">Carabiniere：</span><br>
No, I... That's not...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Formidable：</span><br>
DON'T MOVE AN INCH!!!<br>
<br>
An intense pressure began to exude from Formidable as she glared at the Sardegnian destroyer, enveloping her in a distorted aura.<br>
<span style="color:#ec5d53;">Carabiniere：</span><br>
Wha... what is this?<br>
<br>
Carabiniere's boiler suddenly gave out with a pop. One by one, her fellow destroyers lost power from their boilers and slowed to a crawl.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Formidable：</span><br>
So, who's the lumbering one now?<br>
Care to say that again? Who's the lumbering one now?!<br>
<span style="color:#ec5d53;">Carabiniere：</span><br>
W-wait! That's not what I meant...!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Formidable：</span><br>
You're about to become a kill marking on my Baraccuda! Engage!!<br>
<span style="color:#ec5d53;">Carabiniere：</span><br>
Waaaaaaaahhh!!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Warspite：</span><br>
... Huh?<br>
<br>
Warspite arrived just in time to see Carabiniere get blown away. She broke out in a cold sweat.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Warspite：</span><br>
Formidable... Don't you think you might have overdone it a bit...?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Formidable：</span><br>
Oh, um... What a fine day it is, Warspite.<br>
<br>
Formidable executed a graceful curtsy and smiled wryly.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Formidable：</span><br>
I took the liberty of clearing out Sardegna's vanguard.<br>
But don't worry, I made sure to not hit any vital areas. Just disable her, as Illustrious instructed.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Warspite：</span><br>
Um... w-well done, I suppose. We should hurry and search for this "Jewel of Calabria" next.<br>

And thus the sun once again sinks into the desolate darkness, the hollow of despair where no prayer can reach<br>
O those who were born into an era of false gods, wise is the teacher who guides the poet.<br>
You turned your head up, seeking salvation from above.<br>
Your journey has crossed through the Nine Circles. <br>
Your journey shall ascend the Seven Crowns towards Paradise.<br>
Your footsteps shall know no pause, even as the seas of flame consume your form.<br>
The trials of tribulation thus end, and the path of hope is opened.<br>
But alas...<br>
The fruit of Paradise is not freely shared...<br>
Has that not always been clear...?<br>
<span style="color:#ec5d53;">Zara：</span><br>
Pola, are you all right?<br>
<span style="color:#ec5d53;">Kitakaze：</span><br>
I'm fine. It's just a scratch.<br>
We're equipped with the most durable armor out there, and it's not just for show.<br>
<span style="color:#ec5d53;">Zara：</span><br>
Tenacemente e ardisco ad ogni impresa! Our courage and resolve will not be overlooked.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Formidable：</span><br>
Sardegnian warships are just as persistent as Illustrious said. Can't say I'm a fan.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Warspite：</span><br>
Let me handle this. Don't forget Her Majesty's orders - concentrate on that first.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Formidable：</span><br>
Of course. "Seize the Jewel of Calabria before midnight."<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Warspite：</span><br>
There's no time to waste. Take Orion with you. You already know what to do.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Formidable：</span><br>
Godspeed, Warspite, and God Save the Queen.<br>
<span style="color:#ec5d53;">Zara：</span><br>
Think I'd let you get away so easily? Fiiire!<br>
<br>
Warspite rushed in, causing Zara's shot to go wide.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Warspite：</span><br>
I wouldn't recommend taking your eyes off of me.<br>
<span style="color:#ec5d53;">Zara：</span><br>
Aw, look at you, the hero rushing to save the damsel in distress. Are you sure you should leave her alone though?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Warspite：</span><br>
Heh. Actually, it'll be much easier to deal with you without her around.<br>
<span style="color:#ec5d53;">Zara：</span><br>
What did you say...?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Illustrious：</span><br>
"To The Right Honourable Flagship: My sister is in your care. As this is her first sortie, I trust you will ensure her safety in case of any unexpected mishaps."<br>
"Yours sincerely, Illustrious"<br>
<br>
A chill ran down Warspite's spine as she recalled the telegram.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Warspite：</span><br>
No matter. Come then, bring your guns to bear and let us see who is the stronger! Belli dura despicio!<br>

<span style="color:#ec5d53;">Zara：</span><br>
How is this granny so hard to deal with... What was that attack...?<br>
<br>
As one of the Royal Navy's most esteemed warriors, Warspite easily won her duel. However, Zara's verbal assault did hit its mark.<br>
<span style="color:#ec5d53;">Kitakaze：</span><br>
How are you aiming so well in the middle of the night?!<br>
<span style="color:#ec5d53;">Zara：</span><br>
Ugh... This has to be some kind of cheat...!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Warspite：</span><br>
Heh. Allow me to teach you something I've learned from my many years of service as a warrior.<br>
And that is, the key to a ship's performance is not her raw combat prowess, nor is it through adhering to the service history imprinted within you.<br>
Rather, it is through constantly challenging yourself and pushing your limits.<br>
That is the source of the Royal Navy's strength. I wouldn't mind sharing some of my experience with you should you care to listen.<br>
......<br>
Hey... Where'd you go...?<br>
<br>
Warspite looked up to find the Zara sisters had already steamed out of range.<br>
<span style="color:#ec5d53;">Zara：</span><br>
Sorry, but we got tired of listening to your senile rambling. Pola, the communications...<br>
<br>
While taunting Warspite, Zara gestured in the direction that Formidable headed and relayed her instructions to Pola.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Warspite：</span><br>
Wait... Get back here!!<br>
<span style="color:#ec5d53;">Zara：</span><br>
Let everyone know. One aircraft carrier and her escort fleet broke through our lines... and are headed for the Jewel of Calabria.<br>
We've managed to waste some of Warspite's time, but she seems to have some new night battle technique. Please use caution.<br>
I'll now move to intercept them. Glory to Sardegna.<br>
<span style="color:#ec5d53;">Kitakaze：</span><br>
Hehe... Now Veneto will know. All right.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Warspite：</span><br>
Mercy... they got away. Kids these days just keep getting faster and faster. I can't keep up anymore...<br>
<br>
Warspite dragged her weighty hull slowly but surely through the night, trailing the heavy cruisers.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Warspite：</span><br>
It would be grand if Her Majesty would grant me a retrofit after this operation. Haha...<br>

"But thou, why goest thou back to such annoyance?<br>
Why climb'st thou not the Mount Delectable,<br>
Which is the source and cause of every joy?"<br>
Asked Virgil, the poet, of I.<br>
Please teach me, my teacher, please save me, my savior.<br>
In the name of the God you never knew,<br>
Help me escape this woe and torment.<br>
Take me to the place of which you spoke,<br>
That I may see the gate of Saint Peter,<br>
And the souls of those so tormented.<br>
<span style="color:#ec5d53;">Kitakaze：</span><br>
And in the end, they never came?<br>
<span style="color:#ec5d53;">Littorio：</span><br>
Correct. We informed the Iron Blood as soon as we engaged the Royal Navy.<br>
They said something about "night battle having too many unknown variables," but all I heard was a bunch of verbal garbage.<br>
<span style="color:#ec5d53;">Kitakaze：</span><br>
Hrmm...<br>
Looks like we were never more than cannon fodder to them, just like the Vichya Dominion.<br>
I was full of hope when we were brought into the Crimson Axis...<br>
But it looks like we are just pawns for their "Reenactment."<br>
<span style="color:#ec5d53;">Littorio：</span><br>
It's almost time for the denouement, Veneto.<br>
<span style="color:#ec5d53;">Kitakaze：</span><br>
Indeed. This "Reenactment" is about to come to an end. The only thing left for us... is to decide whether it ends as a comedy or as a tragedy...<br>

<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Formidable：</span><br>
The Jewel of Calabria... is this beautiful sea itself?<br>
<br>
The sea, illuminated by the glow of the pale moonlight, glimmered like a blue gemstone.<br>
The ruins of ancient civilizations swaying like mirages along the shore, and the lifegiving waters that birthed a home for so many people... The breathtaking scenery was almost a spiritual experience.<br>
<span style="color:#ec5d53;">Littorio：</span><br>
"The Coast of the Gods," they call it, as well as the Jewel of Calabria. This is Sardegna's national treasure.<br>
This is the cradle that nurtured countless peoples, civilizations, and legends over thousands of years.<br>
Indeed, this is a treasure that is as resplendent as you and I being together, beautiful signora.<br>
<span style="color:#ec5d53;">Kitakaze：</span><br>
(Uhh... that last line didn't seem necessary...)<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Formidable：</span><br>
Would you two mind telling me why you came here?<br>
<span style="color:#ec5d53;">Vittorio Veneto：</span><br>
We've come to make a wager. Between the Iron Blood's machinations and the Royal Navy's strength.<br>
Though we are a part of the Crimson Axis, we wish to ascertain what we mean to them.<br>
Will this battle become their "Reenactment," or will it become the first page of a new future?<br>
Of course, we are still interested in spreading the glory of Sardegna.<br>
But now that all the actors are assembled, the objectives of this play shall be revealed.<br>
Everything was for the sake of preserving the sanctity of this jewel.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Formidable：</span><br>
The Royal Navy has always held the power to ensure the safety and stability of the Mediterranean. Why not just negotiate with Her Majesty?<br>
<span style="color:#ec5d53;">Vittorio Veneto：</span><br>
The Iron Blood have become more powerful than us... No, stronger than you can possibly imagine. In due time, we would be swallowed by their darkness.<br>
That is the purpose of our wager here. If your Royal Navy falls here, what chance to do you stand against the Iron Blood and their Siren masters?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Warspite：</span><br>
So we've finally reached a mutual understanding, huh...<br>
<br>
Star-crossed ships bound by fate to battle... The lamentations of a sea ablaze... The girls dancing like puppets across countless "Reenactments..." But at last...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Warspite：</span><br>
"Res, non verba." All these obstacles you put in our way are parts of your "wager," correct?<br>
Let me ask you then. Should we stop you here and prove that we are capable of protecting the Mediterranean, would you rejoin the Azur Lane?<br>
<span style="color:#ec5d53;">Vittorio Veneto：</span><br>
Yes. As flagship of the Imperial Fleet, you have my word.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Warspite：</span><br>
Very well. Barham, Valiant, let us fight for the glory of Her Majesty.<br>
Formidable, I'll leave air support in your hands.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Formidable：</span><br>
Of course. You can count on me.<br>
<span style="color:#ec5d53;">Littorio：</span><br>
Is your sister not coming?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Formidable：</span><br>
Illustrious is on a little side trip to the Aegean, where she's putting an end to the Sirens there. She said it wouldn't be fair to put you up against the entire Illustrious-class.<br>
<span style="color:#ec5d53;">Littorio：</span><br>
Alas, what a pity. And here I thought I'd get to see all three goddesses of the Royal Navy in their swimsuits~<br>
<span style="color:#ec5d53;">Vittorio Veneto：</span><br>
Ahem...!<br>
Zara, Pola, and all members of the Sardegna Fleet. This is our time. Allow the light of Sardegna to shine!<br>
Lunga vita all'Impero！<br>

<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Illustrious：</span><br>
So you ended up fighting after all? What was the outcome?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Formidable：</span><br>
Of course we won. The night belongs to us, after all.<br>
<br>
Formidable sipped on her tea elegantly as she gave her report to her sisters.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Formidable：</span><br>
While Sardegna's ships are equipped with heavy armor, they don't have fire control radars.<br>
As a result, Warspite and I made quick work of them.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Illustrious：</span><br>
An expected result, but well done nevertheless.<br>
<br>
Finally, the three sisters could enjoy a moment of peace together.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Victorious：</span><br>
Aww, I also wanted to beat up some enemies, in an elegant way that only a goddess of victory like me could accomplish! How unfair~<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Illustrious：</span><br>
By the way, our fourth sister will soon be joining us, and the Royal Navy will grow even stronger.<br>
And of course, our sororal tea parties will become a little livelier~<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Victorious：</span><br>
Ah! I wonder what our new sister will look like. Could she possibly be cuter than Formidable? Hehehe~<br>
<br>
Victorious pinched Formidable's cheeks as she teased her.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Formidable：</span><br>
Oh, yes, I nearly forgot. That Sardegnian warship, Lit... Litter-something? She asked me to pass along a message for you, Illustrious.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Illustrious：</span><br>
...That was the very spirited one, if I recall? What did she have to say?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Formidable：</span><br>
Um, if I'm remembering this correctly... "When the Passions of this land fade at last, let us reignite the Passion between us." Dreadfully baroque, if you ask me.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Illustrious：</span><br>
One never quite knows what those bunch are up to... I suppose they have plenty of problems to deal with internally...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Victorious：</span><br>
Huh? What's going on?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Queen Elizabeth：</span><br>
Hey, that's my line! What's the meaning of this, having a secret tea party behind my back?!<br>
<br>
Queen Elizabeth, while strolling through the garden with her entourage, saw the sisters gathered for tea.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Belfast：</span><br>
Madam Illustrious, Madam Victorious, Madam Formidable, good day to you.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Illustrious, Victorious, Formidable：</span><br>
Good day, Your Majesty. Belfast.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Illustrious：</span><br>
As it happens, Your Majesty has excellent timing. The tea is just ready~ And may I offer you some treats from my trip to the Aegean?<br>
Won't you join us for sweets and a spot of scintillating conversation~?<br>

<span style="color:#ec5d53;">Scharnhorst：</span><br>
Hah. When it came down to it, those Sardegnian warships weren't worth a damn!<br>
After all that talk about being the greatest fleet in the Mediterranean, in the end they couldn't even fight their way out of a wet paper bag.<br>
Turns out it was a mistake to entrust the Mediterranean to them.<br>
<span style="color:#ec5d53;">Gneisenau：</span><br>
With their night carrier operations and improved shelling accuracy from their radars, the Royal Navy's victory was practically guaranteed.<br>
The observation data has already been forwarded to the research and development department. They should prove invaluable in the development of new weapons.<br>
<span style="color:#ec5d53;">Scharnhorst：</span><br>
And in the end that's all those insufferably arrogant Sardegnians were worth... Ahahaha!<br>
<span style="color:#ec5d53;">Gneisenau：</span><br>
Furthermore, Bismarck has finally begun to stir.<br>
When she returns once more, all the lands and seas will soon belong to us.<br>
<span style="color:#ec5d53;">Scharnhorst：</span><br>
Those who betray the Iron Blood shall quickly find that we are their judge, jury, and executioner.<br>
Gneisenau, can I trust you to monitor the Sardegna Empire?<br>
<span style="color:#ec5d53;">Gneisenau：</span><br>
Aye!<br>
<span style="color:#ec5d53;">Scharnhorst：</span><br>
I want eyes on their fleet around the clock. Report any signs of treachery immediately.<br>
<span style="color:#ec5d53;">Gneisenau：</span><br>
Affirmative! Long live Iron Blood!<br>

"At the edge of that gloomy forest, three beasts blocked my path"<br>
The Leopard, the Lion, and the She-Wolf.<br>
And so, I looked desperately back toward the dark forest, to such annoyance...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Tester：</span><br>
You're back to reading those stuffy old books again? What's the story this time?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Observer：</span><br>
A lost soul searching for redemption. Just another pile of clichéd metaphors.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Tester：</span><br>
The legendary poem of the Sardegna Empire, huh...<br>
The Leopard, the Lion, and the She-Wolf are just Iris Libre, the Royal Navy, and the Iron Blood.<br>
In the end, the Sardegnians make their way up the mountain, looking for a path to peace and redemption. But I wonder if their story truly ends as a comedy...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Observer：</span><br>
...<br>
Not quite...<br>
The three beasts represent the Sardegna Empire's hesitation, arrogance, and envy.<br>
The Empire fled and took a different path...<br>
In climbing the mountain, they may have gained clarity of vision, but they also lost sight of their original goal.<br>
In the end, they failed to slay their beasts.<br>
