<br>
The Mother of All Firecrackers<br>
At night, right before the start of the Lunar New Year...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Fu Shun：</span><br>
All right, carefully, slowly...<br>
There, I've lit the fuse! Everyone, scamper!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Chang Chun & Yukikaze & Mutsuki：</span><br>
Whuah?!<br>
<br>
Fu Shun's homemade firecracker went off with a loud bang, followed by several crackles.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Yukikaze：</span><br>
How can a firecracker go off with the flash of a small firework?! That's ridiculous!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Mutsuki：</span><br>
Wooow!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Fu Shun：</span><br>
It's the result of my sweat and tears and Chang Chun's technical know-how!<br>
That, my friends, was the mother of all firecrackers! We've named it the An Shan #7!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Mutsuki：</span><br>
I wanna light one too!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Yukikaze：</span><br>
Do you have more of them? Yukikaze the Great demands to get to set one off!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Chang Chun：</span><br>
Um, we *did* make a whole batch of them, expecting most to fail, but...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Fu Shun：</span><br>
Sure, but first, there's one more thing we need to do!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Mutsuki & Yukikaze：</span><br>
What's that?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Fu Shun：</span><br>
We need to prototype the Mega An Shan #1! It's the grandmother of all firecrackers!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Chang Chun：</span><br>
Hang on, isn't that the one that's just a can stuffed with gunpowder? Still... I *am* curious to see how it'll explode.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Fu Shun：</span><br>
It's not just a can with some gunpowder! It's a cocktail of gunpowder from a *whole bunch of firecrackers* stuffed into a can! Let's light this thing and–<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">An Shan：</span><br>
FUUUUUU SHUUUUUUN!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Fu Shun：</span><br>
Zoinks, it's An Shan herself!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">An Shan：</span><br>
What are you doing out here playing with firecrackers? You said you were going to help Ning and Ping make dumplings!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Fu Shun：</span><br>
Ow! Okay, I'll do it! Ow! OWW! Stop dragging me by my ear, you're gonna rip it off!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Chang Chun & Yukikaze & Mutsuki：</span><br>
Uhh...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Chang Chun：</span><br>
So, do you two still want to set off some An Shan #7's? We've got plenty left.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Yukikaze & Mutsuki：</span><br>
Yeah! Of course!<br>
<br>
Meanwhile, just a short walk away...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Deutschland：</span><br>
Setting off firecrackers, are they? Those little cracklers are no more than playthings for lowly animals.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Scharnhorst：</span><br>
Pretty much. If they want a loud bang, just do a damn cannon salute. I've gotta say though, that mega-whatever they spoke of has a jury-rigged charm to it.<br>
That's why I hoped to see it go off. Speaking of which, isn't that the whole reason you came here? To watch the firecrackers go off?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Deutschland：</span><br>
N-No! Why would I?!<br>

<br>
Redecorating the Office<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Taihou：</span><br>
(Having bided my time, waiting for Christmas to end so I can avoid the fierce competition, it's finally time to secure my Commander's heart with this new Dragon Empery outfit!)<br>
(Now, let us put my secret plan into action! I shall play my Commander a lovely ballad♡)<br>
Oh, my Commander! I have come for you!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Swiftsure & Black Prince & Sirius：</span><br>
Wh-What the?!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Taihou：</span><br>
...Huh?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Gloucester：</span><br>
I thought we locked the door, but it seems I was wrong.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Taihou：</span><br>
What is the meaning of this?! Where is my Commander?!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Illustrious：</span><br>
Ah. Greetings, Taihou. We are in the midst of redecorating the office in spirit of the Spring Festival whilst the Commander is out.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Gloucester：</span><br>
Indeed, that's why we've congregated here. Would you care to join us?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Taihou：</span><br>
Hmm... Very well, if it's for my Commander's sake, then I will assist!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Swiftsure：</span><br>
Sorry, but... isn't this good luck banner hung upside-down?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Gloucester：</span><br>
I do believe it's supposed to be. It seems to have a certain meaning in the Dragon Empery when hung that way.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Sirius：</span><br>
Where shall I place this decoration? Here?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Gloucester：</span><br>
There? Why would you believe a lantern belongs on a chair? Place it on the bookshelves.<br>
Oi, Black Prince, would you please stop staring at the gramophone and help redecorate?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Black Prince：</span><br>
My apologies! I got distracted...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Illustrious：</span><br>
You're doing a wonderful job keeping everyone on the same page, Gloucester.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Gloucester：</span><br>
I am only doing what's expected of me.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Taihou：</span><br>
If you don't mind, I will take care of the decoration to be hung by the door.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Gloucester：</span><br>
Certainly. Proceed at your leisure.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Taihou：</span><br>
(This way, I shall be the first one my Commander sees when returning to the office...!)<br>
<br>
Bit by bit, decoration by decoration, the port is getting ready for the Spring Festival.<br>

<br>
Full Swing<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ibuki：</span><br>
Everyone around the port must be busy making their preparations for the Spring Festival...<br>
Come nighttime, the skies will be showered in the red and white sparks of fireworks...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Halsey Powell：</span><br>
ACHOO!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ibuki：</span><br>
Eep!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Halsey Powell：</span><br>
Oh, Ibuki! I'm sorry if I spooked you there.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ibuki：</span><br>
No, not at all... I'm sorry, but I must ask, what are you doing up there?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Halsey Powell：</span><br>
Me? I'm helping everyone decorate with these lanterns! Don't ask what they're for though, 'cause I have no idea!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Biloxi：</span><br>
Didn't they tell you what they're for when they gave you that costume? Or did you forget already?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Halsey Powell：</span><br>
Nuh-uh, I haven't forgotten! Give me a second to search my brain for it! Think, thonk, think, thonk...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Biloxi：</span><br>
You'll have to forgive her, she's got the memory of a goldfish. She claims to be a lucky star, but she's only lucky that she hasn't forgotten something really important.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ibuki：</span><br>
A lucky star? Why do you call yourself that?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Halsey Powell：</span><br>
Because people who spot me will get good luck!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Biloxi：</span><br>
All right, just don't be a shooting star and fall off that tree. Anyway, take the next lantern and hang it over there.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ibuki：</span><br>
Would you like me to assist you?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Halsey Powell：</span><br>
You wanna help?! Thanks, we could use it!<br>
<br>
Meanwhile, in the shopping district...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Akashi：</span><br>
Come on in, nya! We have a special offer on all Spring Festival goods, nya! And when you're done shopping, try our lucky ball lottery!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ping Hai：</span><br>
A lottery? Do you have food prizes?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ning Hai：</span><br>
It's always about food with you... We get one spin for free, right? Then we'll do it just *once*!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ping Hai：</span><br>
I want that 4th prize, the pack of snacks! Let's see... I spin this thing, right?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Akashi：</span><br>
Hmm? Oh my...! That's the gold ball, nya! You won the 1st prize, nya!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ning Hai：</span><br>
Huh? What's the 1st prize?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Akashi：</span><br>
A tour of the Sakura Empire mainland, nya! Congratulations, nya!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ping Hai & Ning Hai：</span><br>
WHAAAAAT?!<br>

Spring Festival Party<br>
<br>
Spring Festival Banquet<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Azuma：</span><br>
Hmm... These clothes are rather tricky to put on. Particularly the back part...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Nagara：</span><br>
Oh, let me help you with that. Let's see here... There.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Azuma：</span><br>
Why, thank you so much. I couldn't have done it on my own.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Nagara：</span><br>
No problem~ Ah, I just remembered, everyone should be showing up at the party venue any moment now.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Azuma：</span><br>
I hope they're looking forward to the Spring Festival banquet as much as I am.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Yat Sen：</span><br>
On behalf of the Dragon Empery, I would like to thank you all for coming to our Spring Festival banquet.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ping Hai & Ning Hai：</span><br>
Xin nian hao! Happy New Year!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">An Shan Class：</span><br>
Gei ge wei bai nian la! We extend our New Year's greetings to you!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Yat Sen：</span><br>
I'd like to extend my gratitude to Hiei and Seattle, whose experience with hosting large events was invaluable to us.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Hiei：</span><br>
It was my pleasure. All I want is to see everyone enjoying themselves, and that's enough to make me happy.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Yat Sen：</span><br>
We hope that you will enjoy not just the drinks and food, but also a traditional Dragon Empery play which we are eager to show you.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ning Hai：</span><br>
Are you ready, Ping? I'm gonna be angry if you mess up your performance!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ping Hai：</span><br>
I've had plenty to eat, so I'll be fine!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">An Shan：</span><br>
I still can't believe we're actually performing on stage... Okay, does everyone remember their lines?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Fu Shun：</span><br>
Everything will go just fine, An Shan! Don't worry so much!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Taihou：</span><br>
Ahahaha... At last I get to play the song Yat Sen taught me! Its melody shall be the loving hand that steals my Commander's heart♡<br>
<br>
And so the banquet attendees were treated to a number of performances, with singers, dancers, and actors from not just the Dragon Empery, but from all the factions.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Yat Sen：</span><br>
We thank all the performers for their wonderful acts and songs. Now, we have one more thing to do before we end for the night...<br>
As is customary in the Dragon Empery, let us please wish a Happy New Year to none other than the Commander!<br>
<br>
...What? Me?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Everyone：</span><br>
*Clap clap clap*<br>
<br>
Well, this feels odd...<br>
Yat Sen put the spotlight on me and roused a round of applause from everyone in attendance, which I wasn't expecting. Once that was over, the party came to a conclusion.<br>
A few days later - In the Sakura Empire<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ning Hai：</span><br>
Phew... Finally we can relax. Ping, get your souvenirs in order, then we'll head to the next location.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ping Hai：</span><br>
I'm gonna go eat all the yummy food the Sakura Empire has to offer!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ning Hai：</span><br>
Ahh, I could use some wate– Hey! I told you *not* to go eating at every restaurant in sight!<br>
<br>
For Ning and Ping, their fun overseas vacation has just begun.<br>
