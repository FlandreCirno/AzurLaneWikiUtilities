Émile, the Dancing Angel<br>
<br>
Chapter 1 - The Popular Dancer<br>
Port - Dock<br>
My newly appointed secretary, Émile Bertin, and I were waiting on a commission team's return.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Émile Bertin：</span><br>
The cloudless blue sky, the warm and bright rays of the sun – ah, what a wonderful day~<br>
And on such a wonderful day, it'd be a shame not to go outside and move around~<br>
<br>
Émile jumped onto a bollard and did a graceful pirouette.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Émile Bertin：</span><br>
Really, you ought to get more exercise, Commander! Going outside only to greet returning commission teams is not enough.<br>
Of course, work is important, but sitting too much is bad for the body.<br>
And the work you do, dear me, it seems really tough~ I'm doing the best I can just to keep up!<br>
People who become commanders really are on a whole other level~<br>
<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项1：Respond humbly</span>'''''<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项2：Respond boastfully</span>'''''<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Émile Bertin：</span><br>
Ah, look, there they are!<br>
<br>
The commission team all gathered around Émile like it was routine. They had a cheery girls' talk about their commission accomplishments and rewards.<br>
......<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Émile Bertin：</span><br>
Well done! You didn't have any close calls, did you?<br>
<br>
......<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Émile Bertin：</span><br>
But of course I would worry about your wellbeing! You're my dear friends!<br>
<br>
......<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Émile Bertin：</span><br>
Ah, is this for me? You're too sweet! Merci!<br>
<br>
......<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Émile Bertin：</span><br>
Commander, is something the matter? You seem taken aback.<br>
... Oh, this? We're all part of the same fleet, so shouldn't we try our best to make friends with each other?<br>
<br>
Apparently, Émile doesn't realize how popular she really is.<br>

<br>
Chapter 2 - A Fellowship of Gold?<br>
Port - Commander's Office<br>
Edinburgh was in the office, and it seemed like she wanted to meet Émile.<br>
Edinburgh：<br>
Hey, Émile, I'm here to chat~<br>
Émile Bertin：<br>
Bienvenue, Edinburgh! Sorry, but we'll have to talk later, I've got my hands full with secretary work... Right, Commander?<br>
Edinburgh：<br>
Knowing you, you could get it done in a minute~ Believe it or not, I'm quite a good judge of character!<br>
<br>
Have you two always been this close...?<br>
Émile Bertin：<br>
Don't you know, Commander? We both transported gold during the war!<br>
Edinburgh：<br>
That's right! She transported more gold than I did, but my gold transport is way more discussion-worthy!<br>
Émile Bertin：<br>
Aw, that determination to never be outdone of yours is so cute♪<br>
<br>
Turns out Edinburgh's judgment was right; Émile finished her secretary work in a flash.<br>
Edinburgh：<br>
You're so talented, Émile... It reminds me of a pesky maid I know...<br>
Émile Bertin：<br>
You mean Belfast? Good heavens, no~ I don't hold a candle to her.<br>
Speaking of Belfast, I somehow get the impression that she's your big sister...<br>
Edinburgh：<br>
She's my LITTLE sister! I can't believe even YOU'RE saying that now!<br>
And I don't expect you to understand the complicated feeling that is having a little sister who's so good at everything!<br>
Émile Bertin：<br>
I'll admit that's true. But I think you have a more colorful character than her.<br>
Edinburgh：<br>
Not sure if I should take that as a compliment...<br>
Émile Bertin：<br>
On another topic: have you heard of the Land of Gold, Edinburgh?<br>
I read about it in a travel journal once. It said the Sakura Empire is a kingdom enveloped in gold! Fascinating, isn't it? Don't you want to see it in person?<br>
Edinburgh：<br>
We could just ask our Sakura Empire fleetmates about it...<br>
Still, the land of the Sakura Empire certainly is a mystical place... I suppose I want to visit it someday.<br>
Émile Bertin：<br>
Okay, then let's ask the Commander to assign us on the team next time there's a mission in the Sakura Empire's territory! Oh, just hearing the rumors about the Sakura Empire, the Land of Gold, makes me giddy!<br>
Edinburgh：<br>
Definitely! The idea of it is pretty exciting!<br>
<br>
......<br>
Seems their fellowship of gold will continue for quite some time.<br>

Chapter 3 - Hidden Talent<br>
Port - Commander's Office<br>
Akashi：<br>
Commander, I need to borrow Émile from you again, nya!<br>
<br>
... For the third time this week? Really?<br>
<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项1：Ask Akashi what she needs her for</span>'''''<br>
Akashi：<br>
My sales for this month have miraculously increased thanks to Émile helping out at my shop, nya!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Émile Bertin：</span><br>
Huh? How is that thanks to me?<br>
Akashi：<br>
Because you're a nice person, nya! You're an angel, nya! You're always helping everybody out, nya!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Émile Bertin：</span><br>
Really...? But the last time I substituted for you, all I did was show Shiratsuyu around, looked after Terror on Erebus' behalf...<br>
... gave advice to some friends of mine, and showed off some of my dance performances. I'm pretty sure that's all I did.<br>
Akashi：<br>
That's exactly it, nya! You're helping everyone out, nya! And they show their gratitude by shopping at my store, nya!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Émile Bertin：</span><br>
D-do they...? I'll always help a friend in need, that's all it is. I don't do it so that they'll feel indebted to me...<br>
Shiranui：<br>
That is because you are always able to discern what it is a person wants, and you know how to help them with it in a capable manner.<br>
<br>
Suddenly, Shiranui popped up.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Émile Bertin：</span><br>
It sounds quite embarrassing when you describe it like that~<br>
Shiranui：<br>
Please, you need not be so humble. I, too, am indebted to you.<br>
Akashi：<br>
Nya?! Where the heck did you come from, nya?! If you came to try to steal Émile from me then get lost, nya!<br>
Shiranui：<br>
Bah... In any event, Émile's talent to sell products is undeniable. She need only see our recent increases in sales to understand her influence...<br>
Indeed, one could call her very presence therapeutic. Even I felt as though I may ascend to the heavens when observing her, even from afar...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Émile Bertin：</span><br>
Please, I'm not THAT amazing! Still, if you think my contributions matter so much, then how about I watch both of your stores for a while? Would that be okay, Commander?<br>
<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项1：Agree to her proposition</span>'''''<br>
<br>
I guess I should go check on her later when she's shopkeeping.<br>

<br>
Chapter 4 - Be Strong, Émile!<br>
Port - Commander's Office<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Dunkerque：</span><br>
... Here is the mission report, Commander. Do give it a look.<br>
<br>
Dunkerque handed me the mission report along with a small box of her confections.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Dunkerque：</span><br>
By the way... I made a few sweets. Would you like some, Commander?<br>
<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项1：Sure, thanks</span>'''''<br>
<br>
... It seems Dunkerque does this every day. She makes mouth-watering sweets which she just gives to people...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Dunkerque：</span><br>
Ah, you're here as well, Émile? Why don't you come here and we can eat them together?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Émile Bertin：</span><br>
Err... I wish I could, but... sorry, I can't today!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Dunkerque：</span><br>
Is that so...? Ah, my apologies; today must be a no-sweets day for you. Please, do tell me the next time you'd like some.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Émile Bertin：</span><br>
I will! Thanks~<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Dunkerque：</span><br>
I'll leave these here, then. Take your time, Commander.<br>
<br>
Dunkerque left her confections on the desk and then exited the office. Now, what to do with these...<br>
<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项1：Thoroughly enjoy eating them</span>'''''<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项2：Leave them be</span>'''''<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Émile Bertin：</span><br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项1）</span>'''''Commander, no... I will NOT give in to temptation!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Émile Bertin：</span><br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项2）</span>'''''Commander, don't mind me, I can manage...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Émile Bertin：</span><br>
I know how delicious Dunkerque's sweets are, and that you can't just eat one of them and be satisfied...<br>
Then you'll gain weight, and your steps will get sloppier... And in the end, you'll never be able to dance before other people ever again...<br>
They're a devilish temptation, I tell you! And that's why I've decided not to eat Dunkerque's sweets more than once a week! And I've already had my amount for the week... *Sob*...<br>
<br>
Émile seemed pretty upset by her predicament.<br>
<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项1：Try to cheer her up</span>'''''<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Émile Bertin：</span><br>
How could I not worry about my weight?! I'm a girl! And you should know that a girl's weight is a sensitive topic, Commander!<br>
If you don't take care of your figure, you'll undoubtedly regret it in the future!<br>
And to begin with, as a commander, you shouldn't be so...<br>
<br>
... Somehow I ended up getting lectured by Émile for some thirty-odd minutes.<br>

Émile, the Dancing Angel<br>
<br>
Chapter 5 - Émile's Romance Theory Pt. 1<br>
Port - Commander's Office<br>
Èmile and I were having a chat.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Émile Bertin：</span><br>
... And because we focus on the details, we can see the beauty of everyday things. A true romanticist values even the smallest of life's beautiful things, wouldn't you agree?<br>
<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项1：Such as...?</span>'''''<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Émile Bertin：</span><br>
To me, life's small beauties are the things that make a subtle difference. In other words, no matter how small they are, you should be able to find them if you look for them.<br>
The chirping of birds resting on the windowsill; the small flowers growing on the wayside. Once you calm your mind and scan your surroundings, you'll find the world is brimming with those sorts of things.<br>
<br>
Émile closed her eyes and gestured like she was hugging something.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Émile Bertin：</span><br>
The same goes for people. No two people will have the exact same personality. They may have very much in common, but they will undoubtedly differ in some ways.<br>
When you make new acquaintances, it's important to discover what characteristics and traits they have and which set them apart from others.<br>
To find out a person's unique merits, the ones you've never seen before – that's just so wonderfully romantic, you know?<br>
<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项1：I suppose so</span>'''''<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Émile Bertin：</span><br>
All I need to get through times of great sorrow and pain is remembering that there are still many, many beautiful things I've yet to see.<br>
I want to see those things, I want to experience them, and I want to cherish them with all my heart.<br>
<br>
......<br>
Émile suddenly turned around and faced me, looking a little embarrassed.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Émile Bertin：</span><br>
Aha... That might've sounded a little pretentious. You may disregard what I just said.<br>
<br>
Then Émile made a proposition to me:<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Émile Bertin：</span><br>
I know! How about a date, Commander?<br>
Romance is more easily understood through first-hand experience than through another person's description of it, you know?<br>
Besides, wouldn't you like to have a date with me? *Giggle*<br>
<br>
Èmile convinced me to go on a date with her... Which I guess isn't so bad?<br>

Chapter 6 - A Romantic Date?<br>
Port - Plaza<br>
......<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Émile Bertin：</span><br>
I know I came up with the idea of going on a date, but... where should we even go, Commander?<br>
<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项1：We could just wander around for now</span>'''''<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Émile Bertin：</span><br>
I see, so we could take a walk together. Let's head over in that direction~<br>
<br>
Émile casually grabbed hold of my arm without any hesitation.<br>
<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项1：W-whoa, now!</span>'''''<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Émile Bertin：</span><br>
What? We're on a date, Commander! We need to act appropriately~<br>
<br>
......<br>
As we were walking, I decided to ask Émile about her dancing.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Émile Bertin：</span><br>
Ah, you're curious as to why I love dancing, are you?<br>
During the war, I was moored in a single port for a very long time. The days were empty and boring, so I decided I should learn a new skill. In the end, I went with dancing.<br>
I learned a few other things during that time, too. Such as how to, even on the dullest of days, find the hidden joys of life...<br>
How to share my happiness with others in joyous and fortunate times through my dancing...<br>
And even how to alleviate others' suffering in sorrowful and painful times...<br>
That said, some may view my dancing as a bit self-centered, haha~<br>
<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项1：I think your dancing is pretty romantic</span>'''''<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Émile Bertin：</span><br>
You certainly know how to flatter people, Commander♪<br>
By the way, I know I only joined the fleet and started getting to know you a short while back, but I've been wondering...<br>
*Giggle* Have you thought about trying something romantic and flirting with somebody?<br>
<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项1：I have</span>'''''<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项2：I haven't</span>'''''<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Émile Bertin：</span><br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项1）</span>'''''Then it's good that you haven't acted on that thought yet, because I have no interest in such things...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Émile Bertin：</span><br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项2）</span>'''''I knew it! You're the person I've been looking for, Commander~!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Émile Bertin：</span><br>
You see, unlike most other girls, I'm not a fan of clichéd romance.<br>

Émile, the Dancing Angel<br>
<br>
Chapter 7 - Émile's Romance Theory Pt. 2<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Émile Bertin：</span><br>
Romance shouldn't be an act for the public to see, I believe it should be a feeling you convey to your partner.<br>
You may not have thought about it before, Commander, but just as a few examples:<br>
Whether you're quietly admiring my dancing, letting me do the things I want to, or enjoying dessert with me...<br>
<br>
Émile smiled and grabbed hold of my hand with both of hers.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Émile Bertin：</span><br>
... All those things are what I consider to be romantic♪<br>
But if you aren't doing them specifically for your partner, then they're nothing more than shallow gestures, no matter how romantic you think they are...<br>
When your actions are with your partner in mind and you're doing what they want, your feelings will unquestionably reach them.<br>
... I am so happy that I met a romantic who's just like that.<br>
I am so happy that I met you, Commander.<br>
<br>
I could feel the strong sense of affection and romance behind Émile's words.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Émile Bertin：</span><br>
That feeling you get when you understand your partner, make them happy, and know what it is you want to tell them...<br>
I believe... no, I KNOW this is the feeling known as "love"!<br>
... I don't know why, but suddenly I feel like dancing♪<br>
<br>
Letting go with one hand, Émile guided herself towards me with her other, taking light steps before coming to a stop.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Émile Bertin：</span><br>
Normally, I dance pas seul – but this time, I'd like to dance pas de deux...<br>
... Will you dance with me, Commander?<br>
