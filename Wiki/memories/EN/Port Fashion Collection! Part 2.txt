Port Fashion Collection! Part 2<br>
<br>
1 Dreamy White Sands<br>
It's well into the night. I should go to bed early so I can have a productive day tomorrow.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Shinano：</span><br>
Hmm... This is quite the predicament...<br>
<br>
A familiar voice speaks to me.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Shinano ：</span><br>
Opening my eyes, I'm greeted by a cloudless blue sky and sea that stretch to the horizon... and Shinano, donning a swimsuit, looking abashed.<br>
It seems... You've appeared in this one's dream...<br>
This little creature won't let go of my swimsuit... It's most humiliating to be seen like this... Will you help?<br>
<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项1：(Advice her on how to get the starfish off.)</span>'''''<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项2：(Peel it off by yourself.)</span>'''''<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Shinano ：</span><br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项1）</span>'''''Like this, you mean? I see...<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项1）</span>'''''This one hopes... this unsightly appearance doesn't cause you offense...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Shinano ：</span><br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项2）</span>'''''Mmh... I feel your strong hand, even through the fabric...<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项2）</span>'''''Ah... No, it's alright. Please do continue...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Shinano ：</span><br>
After a bit of work, the starfish clinging on to her swimsuit finally comes off.<br>
Your hand in removing the creature is appreciated...<br>
...What is this place, you wonder?<br>
It is a dream plane of endless blue – a reflection of one's thoughts...<br>
Therefore, it stands to reason that this humiliating garb and the sea creature both are mirrorings of your thoughts and expectations...<br>
Your yearning for me brings me joy... even if your mind's projections are on the odd side...<br>
Please, you needn't apologize.<br>
Dreams, while woven from experiences, are not strictly bound by your sense of reason...<br>
Furthermore, this dream came to be because I, too, desired a rendezvous with you...<br>
And as this bliss is a fleeting one, one should enjoy it while they can...<br>
Passion, palpitations... whether they be felt in the waking world or a dream, their effects are tangible all the same...<br>
So, let us forget the rules and constraints of the earthly world and follow our hearts in the dream world...<br>
Yes, let us surrender ourselves to these feelings...<br>
And partake in one another...<br>

2 Sojourn Through Clear Seas<br>
On Unzen's invitation, I've come to the beach. We gaze at the calm seas together, enjoying the tranquility.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Unzen：</span><br>
Here, Commander, have some tea.<br>
...Oh, you find its taste lacking? I thought the leaves had sufficiently infused the water, so I strained them in advance...<br>
It seems this had the opposite effect of what I intended...<br>
That's not strictly true. I tell her that the aftertaste definitely makes me think of her.<br>
Heehee. That makes me feel better. Thank you.<br>
Now, why don't you come and lie down beside me? The view is quite different here.<br>
<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项1：But what if I fall into the water?</span>'''''<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项2：Wouldn't it be pretty cramped, though?</span>'''''<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Unzen：</span><br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项1）</span>'''''You need not worry about that. I promise you it won't happen.<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项1）</span>'''''Oh, but if you do wish to swim in the deep blue, I will gladly join you.<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项1）</span>'''''That sounds like it could be fun. Unless you'd prefer to swim alone, that is?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Unzen：</span><br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项2）</span>'''''You think so? I think there's plenty of space for both of us if you don't mind our skins touching.<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项2）</span>'''''Granted, that is a big if... Maybe that IS something you'd prefer to avoid?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Unzen：</span><br>
I don't want her to jump to any more conclusions, so I shrug and sit down in the hammock. Immediately, my nose picks up a saline breeze and a pure scent coming from Unzen.<br>
Thank you, truly, for indulging this wanderer today, Commander.<br>
You know, I've known you for a while now, and thoughts of you always come to mind whenever I go wandering.<br>
If the fates permitted it, I would freely walk the lands for years with only you by my side... Of course, that's not going to happen.<br>
But, even being with you for a few hours still makes me feel unbelievably fulfilled.<br>
...Oh, please, there's no need to be sorry.<br>
It's just a pipe dream of mine. I know you cannot abscond your role in protecting the world's lanes.<br>
I ask only that you stay true to your duty until we can enjoy true, lasting peace.<br>
<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项1：One day, I'll make your dream come true.</span>'''''<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Unzen：</span><br>
Oh, Commander...<br>
All those days I languished over what my dream is... You are the only one who can bring such a tempest to my calm heart.<br>
I will remember that promise until the end of my days.<br>
But for now, let's just enjoy this moment to ourselves...<br>

<br>
3 The Cat and the White Steed<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Cheshire：</span><br>
Hmm-hm-hmm~♪<br>
Cheshire in the morning♪ Cheshire in the snow♪<br>
Heart full of excitement♪ Waiting for her Owner to show♪<br>
<br>
I walk through the snowy forest, following the sound of someone singing.<br>
A clearing appears in my path. There, I find a princess draped in white.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Cheshire：</span><br>
Owneeer! There you are!<br>
Come here, come here!<br>
Gosh, talk about dragging your feet! Fine, I'll come to you instead~♪<br>
<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项1：Good morning, my princess.</span>'''''<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Cheshire：</span><br>
P-princess? Wow, someone's a real smooth-talker...<br>
Heehee... That's right! I am a princess – YOUR princess.<br>
And if this were a fairytale...<br>
I'd give you my hand, you would place your lips on it, and then...<br>
You know what? That trope is old and busted!<br>
I'd rather take the lead and hug you instead!<br>
Despite the deep snow, and with no regard for her delicate dress, Cheshire throws herself at me with open arms.<br>
Hey, why don't we hop on my horse?<br>
Let's go for a horseback stroll through the forest in the morning light~ It'll be a ton of fun♪<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Believe me, I'd love to...<br>
<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项1：But your dress isn't suited for riding horseback.</span>'''''<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Cheshire：</span><br>
That's not a problem! I know a trick!<br>
You can take the reins, and I'll sit in the back and hold you tightly!<br>
...You're thinking about how we don't have a saddle, and the ground is slippery, aren't you?<br>
Yeah, I guess... Okay, lemme think about a solution!<br>
Hrrrrmmmmmhhh!<br>
Out of nowhere, Cheshire circles behind me and wraps her arms around me in a snug embrace.<br>
I've got it! Let's not ride the horse!<br>
We can just wander the woods like this!<br>
I look over and notice the horse has started casually walking off, probably to search for patches of grass buried under the snow.<br>
Meanwhile, Cheshire flashes me a smile as bright as the morning sun.<br>
It's hard to walk like this, but I guess I can put up with it if it means spending some time with my "princess"...<br>
