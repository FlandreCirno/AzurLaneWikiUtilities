Convergence of Hearts<br>
<br>
1 Starting Point of Trust<br>
......<br>
It's been a little while since TB arrived in this virtual town in her current... size.<br>
......<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
(She's awfully quiet and always carries that plushie around.)<br>
Hey, TB, what is your plushie supposed to be?<br>
<br>
What's a... "plushie"?<br>
Sounds like she doesn't know the concept of a plushie yet. Time to rephrase.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
What's that in your hands?<br>
<br>
It's... my old friend. Hugging it makes me sleepy.<br>
Not the kind of answer I was anticipating!<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
(Talking with a young child isn't exactly easy.)<br>
<br>
It's a lot... like you.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Is it? Does it look like me?<br>
<br>
No... but you both make me feel safe.<br>
She takes her plushie's ear and puts it in my hand.<br>
Safe... and relaxed.<br>
She starts to yawn, as though affected by some strange energy.<br>
*yawn*...<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
(Oh, okay. It's for making her feel at ease.)<br>
(If I'm "a lot like it," that means she trusts me. That's great to hear.)<br>

2 The Power of Wishing<br>
Hm-hmm-hm-hmm♪<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
TB?<br>
<br>
Oh... You heard me.<br>
TB's language and reasoning skills have slowly improved, in no small part thanks to her interaction with the outside world.<br>
She has reached the point of relative fluency by now.<br>
Were you... looking for me? Do you need something?<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Just wanted to ask you something. Has any of the stuff we've done been difficult for you?<br>
<br>
What does "difficult" mean?<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
It means "hard to do." Basically, is there anything you don't want to do if you don't have to?<br>
<br>
No...<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Alright. I heard you practicing your singing a moment ago. Was that hard for you?<br>
<br>
Nuh-uh.<br>
I also do more things...<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
You practice other things, too?<br>
<br>
Mhm.<br>
But those aren't hard.<br>
Practicing is... full feeling.<br>
It makes me and you full feeling.<br>
I think she's trying to say "fulfilling."<br>
TB was cut off from her database prior to her entry into this virtual town, but it seems she carried something with her...<br>
Her wish to develop a personality. It's still somewhere inside her.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Take it slow and easy now, okay?<br>
<br>
Mhm.<br>
I will... as long as you're here.<br>

<br>
3 Your Story<br>
Tell me a story.<br>
TB has started developing an interest in the stories in picture books.<br>
I read a story to her once a day, but only when it's time for bed.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
But it's not even close to bedtime yet.<br>
<br>
Pleeease...<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
(Fine. It's not every day she asks for something with a "please.")<br>
<br>
I come back with a handful of books I've read to her lately. She doesn't seem very interested, though.<br>
Not like these...<br>
You already told these stories.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Do you want to hear a new one, then?<br>
<br>
Yeah! Tell me a new story!<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
(Oh, boy. What type of story should I tell her? That's the question...)<br>
<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项1：A story about a battle.</span>'''''<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项2：A story about her.</span>'''''<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项1）</span>'''''Do you want to hear a story about a battle?<br>
<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项1）</span>'''''...No.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项1）</span>'''''(She flat-out said no!)<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项1）</span>'''''(Okay, need to choose a different story.)<br>
<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项2：A story about her.</span>'''''<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项2）</span>'''''(That should work. I'll make up a story based on her.)<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项2）</span>'''''But where to start...<br>
<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项2）</span>'''''Hm...?<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项2）</span>'''''(I've got it. The story will be about TB's pursuit of a personality.)<br>
<br>
As the story went on, TB slowly but surely slipped off into slumberland.<br>
I'm like... a navigator...<br>
And brave...<br>
She mutters something in her half-asleep state.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Yes you are, TB. You're so brave.<br>
<br>
*yawn*... Zzz...<br>

<br>
4 The Value of Feelings<br>
......<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
What's the matter, TB?<br>
<br>
......<br>
She looks under the weather.<br>
...I did a thing I wanted to do, but it went wrong.<br>
Is this what it means to be "unsuccessful"?<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Yup. It didn't go like you hoped it would, did it?<br>
<br>
No.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
That means you've grown, and that's something to celebrate. Let's get something good to eat for dinner tonight!<br>
<br>
But why?<br>
Why celebrate something that went badly?<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Because you've learned to express your feelings at last.<br>
Anger, sadness – those are feelings too, you know.<br>
Don't they often say that you're behind the other students at school?<br>
<br>
...Yeah. My teacher says I've never shown any emotion.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
And you just did. You felt sad about something. I know it sounds weird, but that is something to celebrate.<br>
<br>
I think you're making excuses and just want yummy food.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
I'm really not. I'm just stating facts.<br>
<br>
Gaining emotions and expressing them. TB has taken the first step on her journey to finding her personality.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Come on. Don't you want to go out and get something tasty?<br>
<br>
...I do.<br>

<br>
5 Favorite Stories<br>
I've drawn up a list of activities for TB based on her wishes.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Truth be told, I'm not sure which of these you'll like...<br>
<br>
Actually, I like everything on the list.<br>
Without any sound or warning, TB appears before my eyes.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Oh. Can you tell me why you like them?<br>
<br>
Why? Because I feel they're right.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Liking something and thinking something is right are very different things...<br>
There are things that people like doing even if they know it's wrong. Like eating candy before dinner, for example.<br>
<br>
...That's so complicated.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
I want you to do something for me. Can you clear your head and not think of anything?<br>
<br>
What then?<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Then think of the most fun thing you know.<br>
<br>
......<br>
Hearing you tell me stories.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Got it. You like stories, then.<br>
<br>
No, it's not the stories themselves.<br>
When you read to me before bedtime, that's what I like.<br>
It makes me feel warm... and safe.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
(That hasn't changed since she was little.)<br>
I'll read you a story before bed tonight if you want!<br>
<br>
Sure.<br>
If you wanna do it every night... that's fine, too.<br>

6 Each Other's Wishes I<br>
...You're very selfless, aren't you, $1?<br>
She throws me a surprising question out of the blue.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Come again?<br>
<br>
Even when you're neck-deep in work, you still come with me to do the things I like.<br>
All the time. You don't need to go out of your way for me like that.<br>
She looks a bit peevish. It's best to go with a safe answer here.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Hey, I'm just doing my duty as your guardian.<br>
<br>
Then at least let me fulfill YOUR wish every now and then.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Oh. So that's why you're upset.<br>
<br>
I'm not upset, really. I just said what came to mind.<br>
If there's nothing you want to do, that's fine. Pretend I never mentioned it.<br>
She heads for the door, her head hanging a little low.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Hold up. There is one thing, actually...<br>
<br>
What?<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
I haven't told you a good bedtime story ever since you grew out of them, have I?<br>
You used to love them so much, you'd beg me to tell you more.<br>
<br>
Did not. I would never beg for that.<br>
But, I'm assuming that's what you want – to tell me one last bedtime story.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Yup.<br>
<br>
I guess that's fine.<br>
I'm... curious what story it's going to be. Just a little.<br>
I will criticize your story if it's bad, though. Ruthlessly so.<br>

7 Each Other's Wishes II<br>
Uh, there's something I'd like to talk about...<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Hm?<br>
<br>
Oh, it's nothing serious or anything. I was just wondering if you had an unfulfilled wish, $1.<br>
You've been granting mine for as long as I can remember...<br>
So I'd like to return the favor for once!<br>
She looks very serious about this, and almost afraid of me saying no to her.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Hey, I'm just doing my duty as your guardian.<br>
No need to fuss over "returning favors."<br>
<br>
I won't take that for an answer! Tell me your wish, or else I'll...<br>
Uh... I'll run away from home!<br>
She pauses for a moment to think before making a threat, in an extremely uncharacteristic manner.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Did... Did I mishear, or did you say, "Run away from home"?<br>
<br>
You heard me correctly! If you don't tell me, I will run away from home right now!<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Okay, okay. Let me think...<br>
<br>
Don't be modest! I'll do anything to make your wish come true, no matter what it is!<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
I haven't told you a good bedtime story ever since you grew out of them, have I?<br>
You used to love them so much, you'd beg me to tell you more.<br>
<br>
Huh? What's this about all of a sudden?<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
I'm saying that's my wish. I want to tell you another bedtime story.<br>
<br>
That's it? Heehee. Very well.<br>
Then I look forward to hearing it.<br>
By the way... This is my wish, too.<br>

8 Each Other's Wishes III<br>
I've been thinking... Don't you, like, spoil me way too hard?<br>
TB crosses her arms, makes a peevish face, and stares at me.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
What?<br>
<br>
You know what I'm talking about, $1. I say I wanna do something, and you make it happen, every time.<br>
You try to make even my wildest wishes come true. If that's not spoiling me rotten then what is?<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Hey, I'm just doing my duty as your guardian.<br>
And I wouldn't call it "spoiling you." I just want to make you happy.<br>
<br>
Yeah! That's the thing!<br>
You've done all I've ever asked for, and I think it's time for a bit of a role reversal.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
You're going to be MY guardian, is what you're saying?<br>
<br>
Don't be silly! I'm not gonna be anyone's guardian!<br>
Unless that's your wish, of course!<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Oh, uh, no. It's not.<br>
<br>
Reeeally? How can I be sure it isn't if you won't tell me what you really wish for?<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
I'm not falling for that leading question.<br>
<br>
Tsk. I tried...<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
You don't need to play mind games to get an answer from me. What I want is really simple.<br>
I want to tell you a bedtime story for old times' sake.<br>
I haven't told you one ever since you grew out of them, have I?<br>
<br>
Seriously? THAT'S what you want?<br>
Sure, that's totally fine... On one condition! I get to decide what it's about!<br>
Adventure and fighting! That's what I wanna hear!<br>
