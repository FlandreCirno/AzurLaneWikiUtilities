Flower Festival<br>
<br>
Chapter 1 - Spring Springs Forth<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Souryuu：</span><br>
*Whew*... It feels like it's gotten hot much earlier than last year...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">{namecode:89}：</span><br>
It certainly does! Soon it will be spring.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Souryuu：</span><br>
The seasons go by quick...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">{namecode:89}：</span><br>
They certainly do! Would you like a cup of tea?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Souryuu：</span><br>
Yes, please... Wait, Houshou?! How long have you been here...?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Hiryuu：</span><br>
This is where you went, Houshou?! You must've mastered the art of masking your presence!<br>
Ah, sis, Houshou here gave me a hand with making this tea just earlier!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Souryuu：</span><br>
I see, so she was helping you... Thanks, Houshou.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">{namecode:89}：</span><br>
There's no need to thank me, I'm just glad to help~<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Souryuu：</span><br>
Oh yeah, since spring is around the corner, the cherry trees should start blooming soon...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">{namecode:89}：</span><br>
It's that time of year...<br>
Then why don't we have a Flower Festival so we can watch them bloom together?<br>
Nothing embodies the beauty of spring better than the blooming cherry tree, after all~<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Hiryuu：</span><br>
That sounds like a great idea! I think we should do it!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Souryuu：</span><br>
I mean, sure, but... why does the idea of a Flower Festival excite you so much, Hiryuu?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Hiryuu：</span><br>
Why? Because a Flower Festival is a festival for girls! I just have to attend it!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Souryuu：</span><br>
Um... it's not exactly a girls-only festival, though...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">{namecode:89}：</span><br>
If you're in favor of it, then let's do it! Please, allow me to make all the necessary preparations~<br>

Chapter 2 - Blooming Beckoning<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Souryuu：</span><br>
I'll go out and tell people about the festival, then.<br>
Oh, hi, Shoukaku and Zuikaku. Good timing.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">{namecode:95}&{namecode:96}：</span><br>
What's up?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Shoukaku：</span><br>
It is nice to see you, Souryuu.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Souryuu：</span><br>
Ahaha, sorry for interrupting your stroll... You see, we're having a Flower Festival soon, and I'd like to invite you to come.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Zuikaku：</span><br>
A Flower Festival... and we're invited?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Shoukaku：</span><br>
Ah yes, spring seems to have come early this year...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Souryuu：</span><br>
It seems there will be some good company and good food as well, courtesy of Houshou.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Zuikaku：</span><br>
We would love to come! You can expect to see us there!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Shoukaku：</span><br>
Zuikaku... your eagerness to accept offers may come back to haunt you in the future...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Kisaragi：</span><br>
I want to... see the flowers... too...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Mutsuki：</span><br>
Will there be candy? Because I wanna eat candy!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Souryuu：</span><br>
Now, now... Everyone loves sweets, but didn't I teach you that eating too much of it is bad for you?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Shoukaku：</span><br>
Ahaha, Souryuu is like a mother figure to them... That's what I would call "sweet"~<br>

Chapter 3 - Preparing for the Party<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">{namecode:89}：</span><br>
There... Now, could someone help me with these boxes~?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Hiryuu：</span><br>
Sorry for leaving you to do everything alone... But I brought some people who can lend us a hand!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">{namecode:89}：</span><br>
Oh, who might they be...?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Matsukaze：</span><br>
Me, for one!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Nagara：</span><br>
I can probably help you with the food as long as it's not too fancy!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Fusou：</span><br>
Please allow us to help you out as well.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Yamashiro：</span><br>
I'm so excited for the Flower Festival I can hardly wait!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">{namecode:89}：</span><br>
My, it's starting to get crowded in here!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Hiryuu：</span><br>
All I did was tell them about the Flower Festival and they all came here to help!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">{namecode:89}：</span><br>
They must have really high expectations of it~<br>
Then, to meet their expectations, I think we should make some gourmet food for all our guests to enjoy~<br>

Chapter 4 - The Banquet Begins<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">{namecode:89}：</span><br>
Now then, let the Flower Festival begin!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Everyone：</span><br>
Woohoo!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">{namecode:89}：</span><br>
We prepared a whole banquet worth of food, so dig in and enjoy yourselves~<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Zuikaku：</span><br>
Mmm! Sis, you have to try this tempura, it's amazing!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Shoukaku：</span><br>
I'm sure it is...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ikazuchi：</span><br>
I see! So this "Flower Festival" thing is all about stuffing your face with food!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Shiratsuyu：</span><br>
I'm pretty sure it isn't...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Yuubari：</span><br>
Hum, hum... I've never had melon bread this good before...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Nowaki：</span><br>
Ahh, what a perfectly sunny day... Perfect for a nap, too...<br>
Hey, wait, where's Akatsuki? Wasn't she coming with you, Ikazuchi?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Inazuma：</span><br>
She left a note saying she had embarked on a journey to "find the perfect snack to eat at the Flower Festival"...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ikazuchi：</span><br>
Uhh... didn't she leave that note like 3 days ago...?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Everyone：</span><br>

<br>
Chapter 5 - Cherry Flowers and Cheery Folks<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">{namecode:89}：</span><br>
There really is nothing that embodies spring better than the cherry tree.<br>
And sitting underneath one, surrounded by friends and food... I can't think of anything more enjoyable.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Souryuu：</span><br>
You must've worked hard to make this gathering a reality, Houshou.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">{namecode:89}：</span><br>
Yes, but seeing everyone enjoying themselves makes it all worth it... Hm? Do we have more guests coming?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Z23：</span><br>
Looks like this is the place. And looks like everyone's having a good time!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Javelin：</span><br>
Not to mention all the yummy food they've got~<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Laffey：</span><br>
And the alcohol...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ayanami：</span><br>
Yes, this is the Flower Festival – a Sakura Empire tradition. You can join us if you'd like.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Z23：</span><br>
We certainly would!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Javelin：</span><br>
I think we can sit over here! Come on!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Laffey：</span><br>
The smell of sake... beckons me...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">{namecode:89}：</span><br>
Ahaha, how pleasant to see more people join us.<br>

Chapter 6 - Sakura Sake<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ise：</span><br>
*Glug glug*... Ahh, can't have a Flower Festival without something to drink!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Hyuuga：</span><br>
Going straight for the sake, like always, eh... I think I'll have some, too...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Kamikaze：</span><br>
Hohoho~! Nothing says elegance like Flower Festival sake!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Prinz Eugen：</span><br>
I suppose this is part of the tradition... Can't say I dislike it.<br>
Drinking sake under a cherry tree waving in the wind feels... surprisingly charming.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Laffey：</span><br>
Yep, you can't top that Sakura Empire sake... *Buuuurp*...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">{namecode:89}：</span><br>
Oh dear, it seems they're getting busy with their beverages~<br>
Hmm... I hope they don't have too much to drink, or else they might get "shipfaced"~<br>

Chapter 7 - Private Time<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">{namecode:89}：</span><br>
The banquet was wonderful, but I felt rather lonely when it had ended and everyone went home...<br>
Oh, is that you, Commander? I thought you had already gone to sleep...<br>
Would you like to... see the moonlit cherry trees, together with me?<br>
<br>
(Nod)<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">{namecode:89}：</span><br>
Ahaha... I see. Then please wait a moment while I get ready.<br>
Oh, my beloved, please allow me to accompany you to see the cherry trees tonight.<br>
<br>
(Gulp!)<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">{namecode:89}：</span><br>
Do you like my look? ...Does it excite you, Commander?<br>
<br>
!!!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">{namecode:89}：</span><br>
It is an honor to be admired by you, Commander...<br>
Now then, why don't we enjoy a drink beneath the moonlit cherry trees... my beloved?<br>
