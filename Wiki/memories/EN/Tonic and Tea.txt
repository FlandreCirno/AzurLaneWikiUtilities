Tonic and Tea<br>
<br>
1. The Proposal<br>
Port - Office<br>
The office is bathed in a golden afternoon glow. A tranquil, serene mood fills the room.<br>
A new batch of reports rests atop my desk. I reach out to read one, but then, out of nowhere...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Queen Elizabeth：</span><br>
Listen up, servant! You are going to read this business proposal and greenlight it at once!<br>
<br>
Queen Elizabeth vigorously throws open the door and dumps a stack of papers on my desk.<br>
"What have we here... 'Project Return to Glory'?"<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Queen Elizabeth：</span><br>
Indeed! This is the project outline for a teahouse with a maid theme, tentatively named "The Royal Tea"!<br>
I've been informed that certain individuals have been questioning my status here at port lately.<br>
That is why I laid out this project from the ground up – to reassert the Royal Navy's position and my status as its leader!<br>
<br>
Good lord... She means to use a themed teahouse to promote the Royal Navy's own culture.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Prinz Eugen：</span><br>
Well, well. Two can play at that game.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Queen Elizabeth：</span><br>
Eugen?! When did you get here?! Let me guess... You're here to spy on me, aren't you?!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Prinz Eugen：</span><br>
I got here before you did. Sounds like you were so excited about your proposal that you didn't even notice me.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Queen Elizabeth：</span><br>
My mind filters out mere commoners like you! Now explain yourself – what brought you here to begin with?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Prinz Eugen：</span><br>
Commoner business. I won't bore you with the details, Your High-and-Mightyness.<br>
More importantly, I see the location you chose for the project has a vacant plot of land next to it... Perfect for the Iron Blood to set up its own shop.<br>
What do you say to that? It'd foster healthy competition in a race to provide the customers with the best service.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Queen Elizabeth：</span><br>
(Hmm. My status would improve further yet if we're able to surpass our sworn rivals...)<br>
Very well, I approve of this idea. As do you, right, servant?<br>
<br>
If it means better service for the customers and more fun for all, two shops are definitely better than one.<br>
<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项1："Of course, Your Highness."</span>'''''<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项2："I'm fine with that."</span>'''''<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Prinz Eugen：</span><br>
Great. Then we'll have you rate both shops after a week and pick a winner.<br>
<br>
"Wait... Who said anything about winners and losers? Do we really have to do that?"<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Queen Elizabeth：</span><br>
Yes. You cannot have a competition without victors and losers! Although, our victory is as good as guaranteed already.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Prinz Eugen：</span><br>
We have an agreement then. Better start setting up our respective shops, hmm, Queen?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Queen Elizabeth：</span><br>
Hmph. Indeed it is! I'm eager to see you try and fail to manage a shop, Eugen!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Prinz Eugen：</span><br>
I never even suggested I'd be personally managing the place, did I?<br>
With you – the head of the Royal Navy – assuming the managing position, it only makes sense for Bismarck to be the leader on our end.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Queen Elizabeth：</span><br>
Bismarck, you say... Do give her a message. Tell her to be ready to kneel and officially acknowledge my superiority!<br>
Bel, come with me. We must establish our teahouse posthaste.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Belfast：</span><br>
Certainly, Your Highness. Master, forgive us for the intrusion, and thank you for your time.<br>
<br>
Belfast bows gracefully to me, then she and Elizabeth leave my office.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Prinz Eugen：</span><br>
I'd better get going too. Looking forward to hearing your unbiased opinion on our respective shops. Hehe~<br>
<br>
The battle of the shops has officially begun, and it's off to a fierce start, at that.<br>

<br>
2. Impromptu Strategy Meeting<br>
Port - Iron Blood Assembly Room<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Bismarck：</span><br>
Seeing as you've appointed me, I will give it my utmost effort to the end.<br>
To emerge victorious over the Royal Navy, we need a well thought out business plan before we set up shop.<br>
If anyone has ideas or suggestions, don't be afraid to share them right now.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Prinz Eugen：</span><br>
Since the Commander will be the final judge, how about we focus our theme and menu accordingly?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Bismarck：</span><br>
I see where you're coming from, but we can't pigeonhole ourselves into solely pleasing the Commander. Let's not forget the Royal Navy's original goal with all this.<br>
It's to make an exhibit Elizabeth's status. The Commander's evaluation is a factor too, of course, but we cannot put the cart before the horse.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ulrich von Hutten：</span><br>
The Royal Maids are experts when it comes to service. I doubt we'll beat them when it comes to that.<br>
So our efforts should go into our menu. The Commander is a known fan of Iron Blood coffee, so why don't we center our theme around that?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Bismarck：</span><br>
Focusing on our strengths. I like that idea.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">U-1206：</span><br>
Ooh, I have one! It'd be cool if we could offer all kinds of fizzy drinks!<br>
You know, bubbly coffee, juice, soda, and so on! I think people would love that!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Elbe：</span><br>
Splendid idea. We could even offer carbonated wine and the like!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Bismarck：</span><br>
Now that's a novel idea. Maybe excessively so for the wine... But the rest of those drinks may suit our menu.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Magdeburg：</span><br>
Think we're covered in the drinks front. What 'bout the food?<br>
Black Forest cake would be a sure hit. Some sausages plus other light side dishes would be good too.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Bismarck：</span><br>
Hmm... A café serving traditional Iron Blood cuisine might be a novelty, but I'm not sure our food has universal appeal.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Prinz Adalbert：</span><br>
I've got another suggestion, and it ain't for food or drinks. I'm thinking we add...<br>
A cage of death. Perfect for burning calories after you wolf down a bunch of pastries.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Bismarck：</span><br>
No.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Prinz Adalbert：</span><br>
Darn. Here I thought I was onto something.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Leipzig：</span><br>
Umm... Shouldn't we wear uniforms, if we're going to be serving customers...?<br>
They'll have maid uniforms after all. It'd be strange if we just... wore what we have now...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Bismarck：</span><br>
You raise a good point. We need new uniforms as part of the theme.<br>
Another thing we must decide on is the café's name. Any suggestions?<br>
<br>
With Bismarck as the director, the planning phase for the Iron Blood's themed café went swimmingly.<br>

3. Maid Crash Course<br>
Port - Royal Navy Assembly Room<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Queen Elizabeth：</span><br>
...In summary, the Iron Blood meddled during the meeting, and now we must compete with them.<br>
Our plan remains the same, however! Prevailing over them is incidental to our goal of asserting my royal status!<br>
Now, on to why I gathered you here... It is you, not the Royal Maids, who will have the honour of staffing our teahouse.<br>
I am certain beyond a doubt they will base their entire strategy on us fielding the Royal Maids, as one would expect.<br>
However, we will defy those expectations and exclusively employ shipgirls who are NOT part of the Royal Maids!<br>
This will catch everyone by surprise, leaving them with a fresh, novel impression!<br>
And that, ladies, is our strategy! Did you all understand that?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Howe ：</span><br>
Quite an interesting approach.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Penelope：</span><br>
What is a maid supposed to do? I've never worked as one. Someone will have to teach me.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Queen Elizabeth：</span><br>
Worry not, the Royal Maids will give you a crash course on it.<br>
Any questions pertaining to the job should be directed to Bel!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Southampton：</span><br>
Will do! Thank you for this honour, Your Highness!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Queen Elizabeth：</span><br>
No, no! Not "Your Highness"! You will refer to me as "Reigning Manager" until further notice!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Icarus ：</span><br>
As you say, Reigning Manager!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Queen Elizabeth：</span><br>
Good. Bel, take over from here. I'm leaving to check on their uniforms.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Belfast：</span><br>
Certainly. Ladies, let us try a small exercise. I want you to imagine this room is the teahouse, then I want you to conduct yourself as you believe a maid would.<br>
Don't be afraid to make mistakes. Everyone does, initially. For now, any amount of practice is good.<br>
<br>
A short while later...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Howe ：</span><br>
Goodness, a maid's work is much harder than I thought... Thanks for everything you do, Belfast.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Belfast：</span><br>
Think nothing of it. The other maids and I are only doing our jobs.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Southampton：</span><br>
Do you really want me to play the violin at the teahouse?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Icarus ：</span><br>
I'm wondering about these cats too... Will they be at the teahouse as well?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Belfast：</span><br>
Yes to both your questions. Her Highness wishes to include them as part of our theme.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Penelope：</span><br>
And the maid uniforms? What are they going to be like?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Belfast：</span><br>
They are going to look splendid on you all. That much I can say with certainty.<br>
Now, let us repeat the exercise from the top. This time, try to keep our core tenet – gracefulness – in mind.<br>

<br>
4. Out of the Box<br>
The new Royal Navy and Iron Blood stores are just around this corner.<br>
They have names quite representative of their respective factions – The Royal Tea, and Scharlachroter Tresen.<br>
And apparently, they've become the port's hottest places to be.<br>
I meant to check them out yesterday, but couldn't due to work getting in the way. Now, though, it's time to pay the girls a visit.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Leipzig & Penelope：</span><br>
- C-Commander! - Hi, Commander!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Leipzig：</span><br>
Huh? P-Penelope...?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Penelope：</span><br>
L-Leipzig...?<br>
<br>
Before I can even turn the corner, a representative from each establishment jumps out to greet me.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Leipzig：</span><br>
Umm! C-Commander, we'd love to see you at our café! Pl-please come check us out!<br>
Here, h-have a flyer! I recommend trying our new coffee!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Penelope：</span><br>
If you want to kick back and relax, then you should visit The Royal Tea instead.<br>
Because, uhh... our staff is more welcoming, I guess?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Leipzig & Penelope：</span><br>
- Come visit us, Commander...! - You won't regret it, Commander...<br>
<br>
I've yet to set foot inside either store, and already they're trying to one-up each other...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Albacore：</span><br>
Hey-hey-hey! Surprise!<br>
<br>
"What the–?!"<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Leipzig & Penelope：</span><br>
- EEK! - Bwah!<br>
<br>
A wild Albacore appeared. Out of a cardboard box of all things.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Albacore：</span><br>
Teehee~ Oops, sorry for spooking you two. I only meant to give the Commander a fright!<br>
Betcha would've freaked out even harder if you'd just come a little closer first. Alas, you were all taking too long, and impatience got the better of me~<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Leipzig：</span><br>
W-were we taking that long...? Sorry for keeping you here, Commander!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Penelope：</span><br>
I'm sorry too. I'll just... wait for you at our store.<br>
<br>
Whether Albacore meant to or not, her shrewdness got Penelope and Leipzig to back down. Now I can finally move on.<br>
<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项1："Nice job, Albacore."</span>'''''<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项2："Why the maid uniform, Albacore?"</span>'''''<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项3：Say nothing</span>'''''<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Albacore：</span><br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项1）</span>'''''Nice job on what~? I have no clue what you're talking about~<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Albacore：</span><br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项2）</span>'''''Good question! Buuut that's a secret~<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Albacore：</span><br>
Anyhow, you gonna visit the new stores, Commander? Only one will get to be the lucky first to serve you, so choose carefully now~<br>
Teehee~ Well, I had my fun, so I'm off. Toodles~<br>
<br>
As obvious as that is, she's right about one thing: it'll be hard choosing which to visit first...<br>

<br>
5. Experimental Menu<br>
I step into the Iron Blood's café – Scharlachroter Tresen.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Bismarck：</span><br>
Welcome, Commander.<br>
<br>
"Bismarck? I'm honored to be greeted by the leader herself."<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Bismarck：</span><br>
This way I can personally oversee the business to make sure everything is going as planned. We only just opened, after all.<br>
Anyway... Follow me. The seats are over here.<br>
<br>
Bismarck leads me deeper into the café. I take a seat and turn to look at her.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Bismarck：</span><br>
We're trying out a lot of new drinks. Some of them have already made it onto our menu, and some others we'd like your opinion on first.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">U-1206：</span><br>
Here you go! Apple juice, milk, and coffee, all bubbly! Enjoy~<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Prinz Adalbert：</span><br>
Try this, uhh, bubbly wheat juice too. It's– *hic* It's great.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">U-1206：</span><br>
You've clearly had too much of that, Adalbert!<br>
<br>
While I have my misgivings about all the "intriguing" drinks they've presented me with, I can't exactly just pass on them...<br>
"I'm... pleasantly surprised. The bubbles tickled my tongue in an oddly satisfying way."<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Bismarck：</span><br>
Phew... I'm glad you enjoyed them. We'll add them to the menu tomorrow.<br>
Care to try some food too? We have both desserts and whole dishes.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Magdeburg：</span><br>
Yup-yup. From Black Forest cake to waffles with sausages, you name it.<br>
<br>
"The desserts sounds nice, but– Wait, did you just say waffles WITH sausages?"<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Leipzig：</span><br>
H-here you go, Commander! Hope you enjoy...!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">U-1206：</span><br>
You heard right, Commander! Waffles with sausages is my own original recipe. Gosh, just looking at 'em makes my mouth water!<br>
Dig in, Commander! You should start with the waffles before they get cold!<br>
<br>
This is quite a bizarre dish, that much is obvious. Nevertheless, I can't say no...<br>

<br>
6. Classy Establishment<br>
I step into the Royal Navy's teahouse – The Royal Tea.<br>
Upon opening the door, I'm immediately greeted by the harmonious sound of violin music.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Icarus ：</span><br>
Welcome, Commander!<br>
Oh, where are my manners! I'm supposed to conduct myself like a maid!<br>
<br>
Icarus stops herself in the middle of something, slightly lifts her skirt by the side rims, and bows courteously to me.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Icarus ：</span><br>
Please follow me~<br>
<br>
She escorts me through the teahouse and takes me into a separate room.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Icarus ：</span><br>
Here is our menu. I recommend trying our famous royal milk tea~<br>
<br>
I scan the laminated paper adorned with gorgeous decorations. The milk tea Icarus mentioned has the comment "A customer favourite" written next to it.<br>
Something else I notice is that the drinks menu lists numerous kinds of tea I've never heard of before.<br>
"I can't help but admire the Royal Navy's extreme passion for all things tea. Maybe I'll– Huh?"<br>
Looking up, I notice Icarus walked over to a corner of the room to play with some cats. Why are there cats in here?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Icarus ：</span><br>
Hehehe~ Who's a good girl~ Just stay right here and I'll bring you dinner later~<br>
<br>
Later I would find out that these cats are part of the new theme Elizabeth envisioned. She's been inspired by cat cafés, I suppose.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Southampton：</span><br>
Are you ready to order, Commander?<br>
<br>
Southampton comes into the room, violin in hand and donning a maid uniform.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Southampton：</span><br>
By the way, how did you like my violin performance?<br>
<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项1："It was great."</span>'''''<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项2："It soothed my soul."</span>'''''<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Southampton：</span><br>
I'm glad you liked it! At first I was unsure I'd be able to play it all that well.<br>
<br>
"The music adds so much to the atmosphere. I love how you can hear it in here even when the door is closed."<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Southampton：</span><br>
Lovely, isn't it? As a matter of fact, Her Highness had special equipment installed so the music can be heard all throughout the teahouse.<br>
<br>
"You could host a small concert in here with equipment like that. Might be something to consider."<br>
"Oh right, I've still not ordered anything. I'm ready now, Icarus. I think I'll have a..."<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Icarus ：</span><br>
...Got it! Just stay put and I'll be right back with your order! Same for you, kitties!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Southampton：</span><br>
And I'd better get back to work. Breaktime is over. Please do enjoy the rest of the performance, Commander.<br>
<br>
A short while later, Icarus returns with my order. I listen to the vibrant violin music while I savor my cup of tea.<br>

7. A Day Off<br>
The bell at The Royal Tea's front door rings. A pair of unexpected guests enter the teahouse.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">U-1206：</span><br>
Hey, everyone! We're here to hang out!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Z46：</span><br>
"Hang out" isn't quite right. More apt would it be to say "pay a visit."<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Icarus ：</span><br>
Hang on... Don't you girls work just next door at the café?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Southampton：</span><br>
They do. I've got a feeling like they're spies here to steal our trade secrets!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Penelope：</span><br>
I doubt that's the case.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Queen Elizabeth：</span><br>
Hehehe, if it isn't the Iron Blood. Here to concede victory since you stand no chance of winning?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">U-1206：</span><br>
Nope! Just here to hang out, that's all! Bismarck gave us the day off.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Z46：</span><br>
...Indeed. Hang out, as she said. That is the sole purpose of our visit.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Queen Elizabeth：</span><br>
Well, we would certainly never turn away new customers! Penelope, show them to their tables.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Penelope：</span><br>
Yes, Your Highness.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Queen Elizabeth：</span><br>
It's "Reigning Manager"!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Penelope：</span><br>
...Apologies, Reigning Manager. I'll show them to their tables now.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">U-1206：</span><br>
Check out their menu! It's... Geez, it's like a hundred times more fancy than ours.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Z46：</span><br>
Luxury and elegance are the Royal Navy's principles, and simplicity and pragmatism are ours. Suppose one were to combine them...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Penelope：</span><br>
So... Can I take your order?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">U-1206：</span><br>
It's hard to choose when all of these sound delish! Lemme think for a bit...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Z46：</span><br>
Commonplace teatime biscuits contrasted with a plethora of diverse beverages...<br>
<br>
*scribble*<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Penelope：</span><br>
Excuse me, what are you writing?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Z46：</span><br>
Nothing of importance. Pay it no mind.<br>
Cats most charming, and music most calming...<br>
<br>
*scribble scribble*<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Penelope：</span><br>
You know can write after you make your order, right?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Z46：</span><br>
Oh, how right you are... U-1206?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">U-1206：</span><br>
Yeah, I've decided now! We'll have everything on the menu, thanks!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Z46：</span><br>
No. Not happening.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">U-1206：</span><br>
Darn. Hmm, in that case...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Penelope：</span><br>
Reigning Manager, the "spies" have left.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Queen Elizabeth：</span><br>
That they have. You did well, Penelope!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Howe ：</span><br>
Are you sure it's fine to let them gain information on how we run our teahouse?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Queen Elizabeth：</span><br>
Let them, I say! I'd like to see them try to replicate our trademark style!<br>
It's not so hard to replicate our staff's level of expertise, however...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Penelope：</span><br>
It's... not...?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Queen Elizabeth：</span><br>
All right, change of plans! You may all leave now!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Icarus ：</span><br>
L-leave? All of us?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Southampton：</span><br>
Are you saying that we're all fired?!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Queen Elizabeth：</span><br>
No! I'm saying: they're taking the day off, therefore we will as well!<br>
I'll have the maids look after the teahouse. Anyone so inclined is free to visit the Iron Blood's café in the meanwhile!<br>
Understood?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Everyone：</span><br>
Yes! Of course!<br>

8. A Word of Thanks<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Bismarck：</span><br>
Welcome, Commander.<br>
<br>
I'm once again greeted by Bismarck at the café's entrance.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Bismarck：</span><br>
This way, please.<br>
Take your time, we'll be with you soon.<br>
<br>
Bismarck leads me to my table. We pass through a corridor, passing not a single other customer on the way.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ulrich von Hutten：</span><br>
Just so you know, we're not open for another half an hour.<br>
<br>
"Oh, really? Sorry, I must've misremembered when you open."<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Bismarck：</span><br>
It's fine. Everything is ready for us to start early today anyway.<br>
This presents us a rare opportunity, in fact. Care for a drink, Commander?<br>
<br>
She places a foaming drink on the table.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Z46：</span><br>
Ah. Latte art, but with beer.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ulrich von Hutten：</span><br>
Mhm. The principle's the same with any drink that foams.<br>
That said, you have to be intimately familiar with Iron Blood beer to pull it off. You'd better appreciate the skill it takes.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Bismarck：</span><br>
It certainly does. It takes an expert hand, like Ulrich's, and specialized equipment to make a drink like this. It also tastes as good as it looks.<br>
<br>
I examine the drink from above. There is a word written in the foam – "Danke."<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Bismarck：</span><br>
Don't be shy now. Though it may be a work of art, it's still a drink. Drinks are meant to be drunk.<br>
<br>
I take one final appreciatory look at the lovingly crafted message, then down the glass' contents all in one go.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ulrich von Hutten：</span><br>
Heh. If the Commander's look is any indication, the drink is a success.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Z46：</span><br>
Indeed. And its success entails our glorious victory.<br>
<br>
"This drink is incredible. The nutty, full flavor complements the kick of the carbonation. I feel like I just got supercharged with energy."<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Bismarck：</span><br>
Ah yes, that's the secret ingredient you tasted – almonds.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Prinz Eugen：</span><br>
Ulrich, Z46, come to the kitchen. We have a small problem on our hands.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Bismarck：</span><br>
A "problem"? I'll go and have a look.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ulrich von Hutten：</span><br>
No need to, we'll take care of it. Go make sure we're ready to open instead.<br>
<br>
At Eugen's behest, Ulrich and Z46 make for the kitchen to resolve the problem.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Bismarck：</span><br>
I hope they're not up to anything strange again.<br>
Oh, by the way, I personally taste-test all the drinks we make for you. I always worry if you'll like them, though.<br>
After Eugen first suggested I take on the role of store manager... frankly, I struggled for a long while.<br>
But I'd already agreed to it. And once I agree to something, I commit wholeheartedly.<br>
<br>
"It's a good thing to push yourself sometimes. Just don't do overdo it, okay?"<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Bismarck：</span><br>
Don't worry, I won't. Having overcome that initial hurdle, I'm actually having a good time now.<br>
<br>
Bismarck and I have a pleasant chat, killing a bit of time before formal opening hours.<br>

9. Your Cup of Tea<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Queen Elizabeth：</span><br>
There you are, servant! You're going to test a new teahouse service we're working on!<br>
<br>
The moment I set foot inside The Royal Tea, Elizabeth begins shouting at me from her executive throne.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Queen Elizabeth：</span><br>
Hurry up and follow the maids! You have no power to refuse our kind offer!<br>
<br>
I'm shown to a separate room. Howe and Penelope are setting the table for a tea party.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Queen Elizabeth：</span><br>
Here it is – our deluxe service! An extravagant tea party with 3 of our maids!<br>
<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项1："3? I only count 2."</span>'''''<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Queen Elizabeth：</span><br>
How dare you overlook ME! Can't you see my maid uniform?<br>
<br>
"Oh, right. If I remember right, didn't you say at some point you wanted to see for yourself what it's like to be a maid?"<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Queen Elizabeth：</span><br>
Indeed I did! I am presently serving the roles of queen, teahouse manager, and maid all concurrently!<br>
By serving as a maid, I learn first-hand what my staff's responsibilities are. Accordingly, I am better able to manage the teahouse!<br>
<br>
While I'm not sure I follow her train of thought, I'll take her word for it.<br>
I turn my attention from Elizabeth to Howe and Penelope, watching quietly while they put things down on the table.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Howe：</span><br>
Stop once the cup is three quarters full, Penelope. Don't overpour.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Penelope：</span><br>
Three quarters... Got it. Three quarters...<br>
Here you are, Commander. I hope it is to your liking.<br>
<br>
"Thanks. Hang on... It just struck me I haven't ordered anything yet."<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Queen Elizabeth：</span><br>
You are already being served! I expect you'll enjoy the tea. I also expect some appreciation once my prediction proves right. Now drink!<br>
<br>
I do as urged and drink the tea Penelope poured for me. It tastes pretty good. I'd gladly have another cup.<br>
"It's good. Doesn't quite hold up to the Royal Maids' high standards, but even so, I can taste how much effort you and Howe put into this."<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Queen Elizabeth：</span><br>
Well? Satisfied with our service? I thought so!<br>
Being so accustomed to the Royal Maids' splendid work, I of all people would know what constitutes good service!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Penelope：</span><br>
I'm just glad you liked it... That covers the tea, now let's get you some dessert. Howe, go ahead.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Howe：</span><br>
Right. Stay put and I'll bring you some cookies.<br>
<br>
"Cookies are part of the package?"<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Queen Elizabeth：</span><br>
Correct! We're only getting started here, servant! Brace yourself for an evening of desserts and entertainment!<br>

10. Emergency Escape<br>
Port - Office<br>
"So... Here we are now."<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Bismarck：</span><br>
Mhm. The agreed-upon 7 days have passed since both our stores opened.<br>
<br>
"That they have. The week went by in a flash, it feels like..."<br>
"Let's start with what others think. Both your respective stores have been garnering rave reviews."<br>
"In fact, some customers have even requested we keep the stores open for maybe another day or two."<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Bismarck：</span><br>
If you'd like us to do that, then it can be arranged.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Queen Elizabeth：</span><br>
Ditto for The Royal Tea. I-I suppose I can tolerate being your maid for a bit longer...<br>
<br>
"Wonderful. Then since both parties are in agreement, the stores will stay open for a while longer. That was a quick meeting."<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Bismarck：</span><br>
What? But you've not declared a winner yet.<br>
That's what we asked you to do – decide which store you, personally, like the most.<br>
I'm curious to hear your opinion, regardless of which is your favorite.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Queen Elizabeth：</span><br>
I concur. Go on! Give us your honest opinion, servant!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Prinz Eugen：</span><br>
Heheh. You look like you have a lot to say, Commander.<br>
<br>
"I do. There's much I'd like to say as a preface to deciding the winner..."<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Prinz Eugen：</span><br>
Nobody's stopping you. We're all ears.<br>
<br>
*knock knock*<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Enterprise：</span><br>
Sorry for barging in. I couldn't get a hold of... Why are you all gathered here?<br>
<br>
Oh, thank god. Someone has come to save me in my hour of need!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Enterprise：</span><br>
The Eagle Union's holding a briefing later today on our upcoming exercise. I was just wondering if you wanted to attend, Commander?<br>
<br>
That's my golden ticket out of here. Thank you, Enterprise.<br>
<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项1："Of course I'll attend."</span>'''''<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项2："It would be my pleasure."</span>'''''<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Enterprise：</span><br>
Oh, awesome! ...Didn't think you'd agree to it instantly.<br>
<br>
Now I have an excuse to postpone my final answer for later. Time to leave, quickly.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Bismarck：</span><br>
Wait! We're not finished here...!<br>

11. After-Hours Visit<br>
After finishing up work, I pay a visit to Scharlachroter Tresen.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Z46：</span><br>
Apologies, but we're closed for the da– Commander?<br>
<br>
"Sorry for turning up so late. I just really wanted to check on you all."<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Bismarck：</span><br>
Magdeburg, the cats are still knocking things over. Take care of that tomorrow, will you?<br>
Seems we're running out of beer. Elbe, order a refill.<br>
Z46, have you finished cleaning the entrance ye–<br>
<br>
Bismarck and I make eye contact.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Bismarck：</span><br>
First you come before we open, and this time, after we close. You're as unpredictable as they come...<br>
<br>
"I'm just dropping in to see how you're all doing. Don't mean to disturb you, so I'll be on my way now."<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Bismarck：</span><br>
Hmm... We still have leftovers in the kitchen, don't we?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ulrich von Hutten：</span><br>
Yeah. Why? Are we gonna keep the café open longer today?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Bismarck：</span><br>
That's the idea. It'd be a shame for the food to go to waste, wouldn't it? Let's invite the Commander inside and have dinner.<br>
Right this way, Commander. We have the café reserved all to ourselves tonight.<br>

12. Garden Tea Party<br>
I arrive at The Royal Tea as per Elizabeth's invitation.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Noshiro：</span><br>
Welcome, Commander.<br>
<br>
Surprisingly, I'm greeted by Noshiro of all people. She gestures for me to step inside, which I do.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Noshiro：</span><br>
Many Sakura Empire girls have expressed an interest in opening our own store. I'm simply here to see how the Royal Navy runs theirs.<br>
Her Highness is waiting for you in the garden.<br>
<br>
"They've set up a garden behind the store now? Good grief..."<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Queen Elizabeth：</span><br>
How good you could make it, servant.<br>
Icarus, fetch us some tea.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Icarus：</span><br>
Certainly. Just a moment.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Queen Elizabeth：</span><br>
Well? Will you join me, or are you just going to stand there?<br>
Your seat is over there. Sit down, servant.<br>
Hehe! Good. Now listen up.<br>
Our teahouse has been a great success. A growing number of customers have even said they want to try the maid experience for themselves!<br>
With how well our store's been received, I propose we keep it in business indefinitely.<br>
What do you think of that, servant? You have the final say in the matter.<br>
No need to decide right at once. Ponder it over some tea and biscuits.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Icarus：</span><br>
I'm back with your tea!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Queen Elizabeth：</span><br>
Oh, and I've checked your schedule for today. I know you have all the time in the world to stay and indulge in a chat with me.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Icarus：</span><br>
May I pour some for you too, Commander?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Queen Elizabeth：</span><br>
Wait, Icarus. I shall do it.<br>
There we are. Go on, drink. Savour the taste... my dear servant!<br>
