<br>
1 Situation Abnormal<br>
Port - Northern Parliament Lounge<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Kuybyshev：</span><br>
Everyone, I've returned.<br>
Oh, nobody's here?<br>
<br>
Kuybyshev, a cruiser of the Northern Parliament, turned her gaze down to a sheet of paper on the salon table.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Kuybyshev：</span><br>
"Fairy Magic"?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Sovetskaya Rossiya：</span><br>
Caught your interest, Kuybyshev?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Kuybyshev：</span><br>
(That's an odd look on her face. It must be a code name for a major mission.)<br>
(Belorussiya is here, too... It's certain to be important.)<br>
Rossiya, Belorussiya. Would you mind telling me what's going on?<br>
Have we been given a new mission?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Sovetskaya Belorussiya：</span><br>
Actually, Kuybyshev, it concerns you more than it does us.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Sovetskaya Rossiya：</span><br>
Ahem!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Sovetskaya Belorussiya：</span><br>
Ah, my apologies. I've said too much already.<br>
May I offer you this coin as a token of apology, Rossiya?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Sovetskaya Rossiya：</span><br>
Oh, I'll gladly take it. Thanks.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Kuybyshev：</span><br>
(Isn't that coin from Akashi's shop? What's going on...?)<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Sovetskaya Rossiya：</span><br>
Now, allow me to pass on the orders handed down by the Northern Parliament.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Kuybyshev：</span><br>
(I just got back from one mission, and now they have another for me? Work never ceases...)<br>
Yes, Comrade. If there's anything I can do to further our goals—<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Sovetskaya Rossiya：</span><br>
You are to obtain Akashi's coins and find the fairies' treasure hidden within this port.<br>
See it done, Pathfinder.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Kuybyshev：</span><br>
Um...?<br>
What was that all about? Is there no mission?<br>
(Maybe it's some sort of code... No, that has to be it!)<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Theseus：</span><br>
"Fairy Magic," hm?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Kuybyshev：</span><br>
Right. It looks to be code. And if these are Akashi's coins...<br>
My, are you... Theseus of the Royal Navy?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Theseus：</span><br>
That would be me, the fleet's dearest Little Witch!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Kuybyshev：</span><br>
Little Witch... Could this be code, as well? You are floating, after all.<br>
Knowing that Akashi's involved in this, I wouldn't be surprised if she had some way for you to float.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Theseus：</span><br>
It's much simpler than that. Witches fly! Ergo, not surprising that I would fly.<br>
So? Searching for the fairies' treasure, are you?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Kuybyshev：</span><br>
I suppose. What about you, Theseus?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Theseus：</span><br>
Same! The treasure does tickle the imagination, does it not?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Kuybyshev：</span><br>
(Everyone's acting strange, but maybe that's because of the mission?)<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Theseus：</span><br>
Either way, you'd better get your hands on it if you want to help your friends, Pathfinder of the Northern Parliament.<br>
But it's a treasure, which means everyone wants a piece of it. Don't think I'll let it go that easy!<br>
Eyes open, got it? ♪<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Kuybyshev：</span><br>
I see. You mean to say that the Royal Navy has their hands in this mission, as well.<br>
But my only clue is that it's a treasure... This looks to be a difficult quandary.<br>
Yet I must do it! For the Commander, and for the others.<br>
It falls to Kuybyshev to crack this case!<br>

2 Friends Block Your Path<br>
Port - Main Plaza Set<br>
With binoculars in hand, Kuybyshev decided to go over the information she'd found in her investigation so far.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Kuybyshev：</span><br>
I thought that structure in the plaza to be one of Akashi's sets, but it's plausible that it might be connected to this mission.<br>
Based on Avrora and the Commander's movements, it seems reaching the center of it is their objective.<br>
Oh? You're...<br>
Pamiat' Merkuria?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Pamiat' Merkuria：</span><br>
Pssh, whoever could that be?<br>
I am the great Grand Magus, and my companion here is the slightly-less-impressive Warlock!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Kuybyshev：</span><br>
More code words? Or are these codenames for the mission?<br>
...Know me as Pathfinder. Step aside.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Gangut：</span><br>
Bwuh?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Kuybyshev：</span><br>
Am I misunderstanding something here... "Grand Magus, slightly less impressive than the Warlock"?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Pamiat' Merkuria：</span><br>
H-How dare you...<br>
Wait there a second!<br>
<br>
Apparently frazzled for some reason, Pamiat' pulled Gangut away by her sleeve and whispered madly at her.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Pamiat' Merkuria：</span><br>
(You heard that, right?! Kuybyshev mixed us up!)<br>
(Or did she intentionally mix us up as a joke? Does Kuybyshev "do" jokes?!)<br>
(Everything's all wrong! Whose stupid idea was this in the first place?!)<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Gangut：</span><br>
(What do you want me to do about it?! If we invited her normally, she'd be too considerate to accept!)<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Pamiat' Merkuria：</span><br>
(Nrrrrgh...)<br>
(Very well. We let Kuybyshev through for now. Is that acceptable, Gangut?)<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Gangut：</span><br>
(I suppose? But what do we do after that?)<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Pamiat' Merkuria：</span><br>
(What do you wanna do? Go drinking until the event starts, maybe?)<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Gangut：</span><br>
(Now you're talking, Pamiat'! I'm in.)<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Pamiat' Merkuria：</span><br>
(Then it's decided! All we need to do is get her to leave us alone!)<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Kuybyshev：</span><br>
Erm... Have you finished your discussion?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Pamiat' Merkuria：</span><br>
Ahem. Thank you for graciously waiting, Pathfinder. We've settled our matters.<br>
Upon much reflection, we have realized that we don't particularly care about this treasure.<br>
As such, we entrust these coins to you, representative of the youth.<br>
The Fairy Coins I bequeath to you are necessary items to find the treasure you seek.<br>
Only one person, the one holding the most coins, can obtain the treasure.<br>
And when you find that treasure...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Kuybyshev：</span><br>
My only desire is to let my comrades feel the warmth of victory. The treasure doesn't really matter to me.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Pamiat' Merkuria：</span><br>
A-anyway, just go to the center of the set! Go there, and you'll understand!<br>
Now, Kuy—ahem! Our job here is done. Accept this coin and this wand.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Gangut：</span><br>
Right! Take my hat and coin as well, Comrade Pathfinder!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Pamiat' Merkuria：</span><br>
There you go! Okay, you're free to pass now.<br>
Don't get distracted, now. Have fun!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Gangut：</span><br>
I pray for your success, Pathfinder!<br>
<br>
Pamiat' Merkuria and Gangut forced Kuybyshev to take the coins and then rushed away from the scene.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Kuybyshev：</span><br>
...This seems to be more serious than I'd once thought.<br>
Regardless of whatever this "treasure" might entail, the shipgirls are all too focused on it to hold their own in a fight as things are.<br>
I'd best wrap up this mission quickly.<br>
It sounds like there are others trying to collect coins here, as well...<br>
<br>
Kuybyshev gazed in confusion at the hat and wand that had been foisted upon her. Were they meant to be a disguise?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Kuybyshev：</span><br>
I don't like it much, but I suppose there's little choice.<br>
Perhaps disguising myself as a member of staff rather than a participant will make things smoother.<br>
Pamiat' and Gangut seemed awfully serious about it, so it's surely worth trying.<br>
I'll put on a robe and wizard hat, and I'll hold this wand... Okay. This should do it!<br>

3 Intermezzol<br>
Main Plaza - Rest Area<br>
Avrora showed me to the set's break room, where the staff was already buzzing with excitement.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Sovetskaya Belorussiya：</span><br>
Slrrrp... Aah. You have my thanks for bringing refreshments, Avrora.<br>
Hm? Pamiat' and Gangut?<br>
It seems you've had your coins taken by an invitee.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Pamiat' Merkuria：</span><br>
You could say that.<br>
Kuybyshev didn't hesitate for a moment. She got us good, so we had to give her our coins.<br>
We totally didn't give them away because we wanted to come and drink vodka, okay?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Gangut：</span><br>
That would be why I gave mine away, actually.<br>
<br>
"Seems like the mission is proceeding exactly as planned."<br>
<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项1："Do you think Kuybyshev is having fun?"</span>'''''<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Avrora：</span><br>
Hmm, I dunno. I did see her watching this set with binoculars before...<br>
She may see it as more of a mission than an event to have fun at.<br>
But who knows? Maybe that's fun for her.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Theseus：</span><br>
So this is where the fairies have gathered!<br>
<br>
For some reason, one of the invitees—Theseus of the Royal Navy—came into the break room.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Sovetskaya Belorussiya：</span><br>
Impressive of you to find this place, Little Witch.<br>
Given your appearance, I presume you've collected nearly all of the necessary coins.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Theseus：</span><br>
I sure have. After all, my magic lets me fly! Might as well put it to good use.<br>
I decided to play along with the Commander and liven things up with some fantasy vibes.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Sovetskaya Belorussiya：</span><br>
That is appreciated. You will join us in the battle for the summit, won't you?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Avrora：</span><br>
On that note, there's something I'd like to try during this final showdown...<br>

4 Battle for the Summitl<br>
Port - Main Plaza Set<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Kuybyshev：</span><br>
These must be Akashi's coins. They don't seem particularly special, though.<br>
Supposedly, I can find the fairies' treasure once I have enough. And then...<br>
Oh? A box?<br>
<br>
She noticed a box right in the middle of the road before her.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Avrora：</span><br>
Aah, aah... Ahem. The chosen one who is prophesied to obtain the fairies' treasure will soon appear.<br>
But do not lose hope. This is the final prophecy.<br>
If you can hear this message, you should listen well to the fairies' words.<br>
You must take the fairies' final gift and do battle with the chosen Little Witch.<br>
Take it as one final ray of hope in your quest for the treasure.<br>
This will be your final battle. Only the victor may cross the threshold of truth.<br>
Have faith in miracles, in magic, and in the light of dawn...<br>
And walk onward toward ultimate victory!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Kuybyshev：</span><br>
The fairies' final gift... Would that be this box?<br>
<br>
Kuybyshev turned the box over and found two of Akashi's coins affixed to the bottom.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Kuybyshev：</span><br>
If that message was correct, then these should be the last ones I need.<br>
I still have no idea what's going on, but if the others are involved, then it's up to me to help them.<br>
As for doing battle with the Little Witch...<br>
That means Theseus will be my opponent.<br>
She should be with the treasure already. Forget the investigation; I should defeat her and end this mission as soon as possible.<br>
Okay... Let's go!<br>
<br>
Main Plaza - Rest Area<br>
"It took some doing, but it looks like we've succeeded in drawing our new allies to the final stage."<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Avrora：</span><br>
Thank you for trusting in my plan, Commander.<br>
If we'd let her keep up her search, she might have found this rest area like Theseus had.<br>
And wouldn't that be a mess!<br>
So it's about time we wrap this up and put on a good show before everyone gets too tired...<br>
<br>
Port - Main Plaza Set<br>
In the plaza adorned by Akashi's set, the two chosen invitees were drawn together by fate.<br>
One was Kuybyshev, of the Northern Parliament. As for the other...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Kuybyshev：</span><br>
I had a feeling you would be my final opponent, Theseus.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Theseus, the Chosen One：</span><br>
That's right! I'm the Chosen One, the Little Witch!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Kuybyshev：</span><br>
I hear you've nearly won this little coin-collecting contest. Well done.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Theseus, the Chosen One：</span><br>
Heheh, thanks for the compliment!<br>
So how about you hand over the last of the coins, eh?<br>
I wanna get the fairies' treasure and go on a date with the Knight who protects this port!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Kuybyshev：</span><br>
There's a Knight now, too...? Well, my apologies, but I won't hand them over that easily.<br>
We may be comrades of the same port, but I fight for the Northern Parliament today, Little Wizard.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Theseus, the Chosen One：</span><br>
It's Little WITCH! Grrr!<br>
Anyway, the whole plan was to have a mock battle here, so have at you!<br>
Open those eyes, everyone! I'm about to WIN this!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Kuybyshev：</span><br>
I'll be careful not to destroy this lovely set.<br>
It's time to uncover the fairies' treasure... To solve the mystery of Fairy Magic!<br>

5 Welcome Party<br>
Port - Main Plaza Set  Mock Battlefield<br>
A battle began to unfold between Theseus, who used her broom-like rigging to fire off planes, and Kuybyshev who fought them off.<br>
Though they couldn't put their full power on display in the port, their masterful technique allowed the battle to unfold like a glorious dance.<br>
But eventually, a victor emerged.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Theseus：</span><br>
Ack... Okay, I give up! You win.<br>
Congrats, Kuybyshev! You did great!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Pamiat' Merkuria：</span><br>
It looks like we have a winner!<br>
Hooray! Gangut, Kuybyshev won!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Gangut：</span><br>
Comrade Kuybyshev, beautifully done! You've given them a real taste of the Northern Parliament's power!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Kuybyshev：</span><br>
Oookay...?<br>
Um, are you telling me...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Avrora：</span><br>
Congratulations. You've won the Fairy Coin Collecting Contest with aplomb!<br>
As for the fairies' treasure... You've won a ticket good for one day with the Commander!<br>
Come, Commander. You must give the victor her prize, no?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Kuybyshev：</span><br>
Wait, but...<br>
Err... So this was never a mission or an exercise? It was mere play?<br>
<br>
"Exactly."<br>
<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项1："Here's your prize, Kuybyshev."</span>'''''<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Kuybyshev：</span><br>
*sigh*... I had a feeling, you know, but it's embarrassing to hear it outright.<br>
Frankly, all I wanted was to find out why everyone was acting so strange. Now I've made a fool of myself.<br>
But thanks to you all—especially Theseus—I'm in a much more festive mood now. I've forgotten all about my investigation.<br>
Either way, I'm glad that I could assist you all without causing any undue trouble.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Theseus：</span><br>
Yeah! Congrats again for winning, Kuybyshev.<br>
I had a lot of fun thanks to you, too!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Kuybyshev：</span><br>
You're too kind. I'm overjoyed to have both achieved this heated victory and livened up the event.<br>
Never will I forget this day. Thank you all.<br>
It may not be the best way to show my gratitude, but why don't I go back to the dorm and make some piping-hot borscht—<br>
<br>
But before Kuybyshev could go out of her way to be so kind to us, we announced the beginning of today's main event.<br>
A few days later, Kuybyshev visited me in my office.<br>
There were two documents on my desk. One concerned the Fairy Magic event. As for the other...<br>
<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项1："Port welcome party investigation report...?"</span>'''''<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Kuybyshev：</span><br>
Consider the first one a report on my own impressions of the event.<br>
Thanks to you all, I've come face to face with some of my own inadequacies.<br>
My foolhardiness in trying to solve problems all alone, my thickheadedness in refusing to notice my comrades' goodwill...<br>
As for the other... It's an investigation into your holding a welcome party for us without prior approval.<br>
You've made a mistake, Commander, in indulging us without first deferring to the rules of the port.<br>
<br>
After giving me a token scolding, Kuybyshev placed a certain ticket on my desk. And then...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Kuybyshev：</span><br>
You'll have to explain yourself during our date today, Commander. Heehee!<br>
<br>
Our guiding light Kuybyshev bashfully extended her hand.<br>
(A promise is a promise. It looks like I'll be spending the rest of the day with her.)<br>
