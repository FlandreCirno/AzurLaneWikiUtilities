<br>
A fresh breeze reminiscent of early morning blew through the trees, whipping up robust pink petals and scattering them about.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Nagato：</span><br>
This is...<br>
<br>
The sloped road seemed to go on forever, lined by trees shedding their petals.<br>
Nagato approached one such tree and gently placed a hand on it—<br>
Sakura Empire<br>
In the luxurious Guardian Fox's chamber, Nagato awakened.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Nagato：</span><br>
Was that... a dream?<br>
If it was, why do I continue to feel that stinging pain from when I touched the Sacred Sakura?<br>
<br>
It was a terrifying dream, in which the sacred tree had decayed in fetid fog.<br>
Withering, devastation. A spectacle of destruction, painted by the pain and misery of all who lived.<br>
*knock* *knock*<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Nagato：</span><br>
Kawakaze? You may enter.<br>
<br>
The screen door slid open, and Kawakaze, the white-haired servant of the Guardian Fox, sat on her knees behind it.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Kawakaze：</span><br>
I'm sorry to disturb you at this late hour, Lady Nagato.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Nagato：</span><br>
It is fine. In fact, I meant to ask something of you.<br>
Are the widespread reports of the Sacred Sakura's withering true?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Kawakaze：</span><br>
Yes, Lady Nagato. I've already verified the reports firsthand... They're all true.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Nagato：</span><br>
(In that case, that was no mere dream.)<br>
So the withering of our sacred tree has spread...<br>
<br>
Nagato straightened out her clothes and stood up, while Kawakaze entered her room and expertly closed the shoji window.<br>
The folding screen stretched wide, hiding Nagato's figure as she was dressed.<br>
Kawakaze removed Nagato's nightgown, combed her long black hair, and rinsed her with water.<br>
After wiping her down with a hand towel, she helped Nagato change into her usual day clothes.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Nagato：</span><br>
Kawakaze, inform Musashi that I will be visiting at sunrise.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Kawakaze：</span><br>
Lady Nagato, about that...<br>
Musashi is already waiting outside.<br>

<br>
Sakura Empire - Nagato's Abode<br>
During the midnight hour, the full moon hung over the starry night sky.<br>
On one balcony in a corner of the castle, Kawakaze performed a tea ceremony in which she poured tea for two.<br>
Visitor and host – Musashi and Nagato – sat side by side, rather than facing each other.<br>
Despite the vast property and magnificent castle, their meeting was small and isolated.<br>
Wind caused the leaves in the trees to rustle, prompting the two to begin their conversation after a sip of tea.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Musashi：</span><br>
Lady Nagato, tell me what you saw in your dream.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Nagato：</span><br>
I was walking down a long, tree-lined path, with sakura blossoms raining down from above.<br>
When I tried to catch the falling petals, they disappeared.<br>
And just as I touched the Sacred Sakura, it withered and was engulfed in darkness.<br>
All that remained was silence.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Musashi：</span><br>
I dreamed of something similar, myself.<br>
The same sacred tree, but not in the midst of a tree-lined path.<br>
I only saw one tree... It jutted out far into the sky, and its branches and leaves blotting out the sun.<br>
Far bigger and taller than the Sacred Sakura you sealed yourself into...<br>
However, like your dream, it would not last.<br>
The tree abruptly began to wither.<br>
Its blooms crumbled into dust, leaving gaunt branches in their wake.<br>
...And similarly, it all disappeared into endless darkness in the end.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Nagato：</span><br>
You've heard the rumors of the Sacred Sakura all over the empire withering, haven't you? Musashi, what are your thoughts?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Musashi：</span><br>
Lady Nagato, we believe we have found a pattern to the withering.<br>
As one approaches the holy sanctuary of the Sakura Empire where you sleep, such reports grow in frequency.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Nagato：</span><br>
Right. I've noticed this, too.<br>
Our land's Sacred Sakura are all connected. It is not unsurprising that the withering would spread.<br>
However, there is one clear lesson to be learned from this omen.<br>
...The corruption will come in full force before long.<br>
<br>
Nagato stood up, produced a small pouch, and handed it to Kawakaze.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Nagato：</span><br>
The full moon is lovely tonight. I'm in the mood for a stroll.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Kawakaze：</span><br>
Lady Nagato...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Nagato：</span><br>
You stay, Kawakaze. If I don't return by dawn tomorrow, give that pouch to Mutsu.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Kawakaze：</span><br>
Yes, Lady Nagato.<br>

<br>
On this night, wispy clouds covered the moon, and even the ripples of light on the water were indistinct.<br>
After leaving the castle, Nagato and Musashi walked slowly upon the stone path.<br>
It was then that a slight breeze lifted some fallen leaves and blew them toward the young Guardian Fox.<br>
She fended them off with her sleeve and looked to the sky.<br>
The clouds had faded, allowing the moon to shine its delicate blue light upon the courtyard again.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Musashi：</span><br>
Lady Nagato...?<br>
<br>
After gazing in silence at the lake for some time, Nagato finally spoke.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Nagato：</span><br>
...Musashi, do you remember this place?<br>
Long ago, she used the Sacred Sakura to communicate a message to me.<br>
To perform the ritual and summon her to this place.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Musashi：</span><br>
...You mean the Sage.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Nagato：</span><br>
Exactly.<br>
<br>
After a short silence, Nagato began walking toward the lake.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Nagato：</span><br>
If you and I have had similar dreams, then the solution to this problem is all but clear.<br>
Isn't that right?<br>
Musashi, you and I are alone.<br>
Speak frankly.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Musashi：</span><br>
Then allow me, Lady Nagato.<br>
The withering of the Sacred Sakura is an ill omen concerning the safety of the Prime Sakura.<br>
If signs of decay can be found there, too, then that will explain things.<br>
...It's like the last time this happened.<br>
However, I don't know if we have the strength to fight our enemy today...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Nagato：</span><br>
The Prime Sakura is isolated from the earthly world, protected by the Sage.<br>
If something did happen there, that would mean the entire sanctuary is in peril.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Musashi：</span><br>
This is true. The withering of the Sacred Sakura may be reverberations from the last time...<br>
We may need to be prepared for the worst.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Nagato：</span><br>
...I say we make for the sanctuary right now.<br>

<br>
Memory - Musashi's Abode<br>
It was late at night. Musashi, a high-ranking member of the Sakura Empire, happened to have a freeloader in her home.<br>
Said freeloader, a girl with a veil draped over her face, gazed out the window and up at the moon.<br>
*stomp* *stomp* *stomp*!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Sakawa：</span><br>
Sorry! I heard a weird noise, so I came to check things out!<br>
Whoa. You should be resting... Is everything okay?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">???：</span><br>
There's nothing to be concerned about. I'm only here because I couldn't sleep.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Sakawa：</span><br>
Hm? Are you looking for Lady Musashi?<br>
She's out right now, so...<br>
<br>
Despite Sakawa saying so, the girl showed no intent to leave. Instead, she retrieved two cushions placed in the corner of the room.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">???：</span><br>
It's not as if I'll ever get to sleep. Shall we chat?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Sakawa：</span><br>
Sure!<br>
Oh! I almost forgot! Should I, um... make an offering of tea for you, or...?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">???：</span><br>
You don't have to do all that.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Sakawa：</span><br>
Okay... Um, what should we talk about?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">???：</span><br>
Hmm. Could I ask you to tell me about the past?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Sakawa：</span><br>
The past...<br>
Lady Musashi did tell me to answer any questions you have, so I'm glad to share anything I know.<br>
But when you say "the past"... What exactly do you want to know?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">???：</span><br>
How about... the Reenactment of the treaty?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Sakawa：</span><br>
Oh, that~ You mean the time Lady Nagato planned special training exercises and retired from being the Combined Fleet flagship?<br>
I only know bits about it that I've heard here and there, so...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">???：</span><br>
Hearsay is acceptable.<br>
All I want is to know what you know.<br>
<br>
The girl removed her veil, revealing her divine visage.<br>
Sakawa gazed into her crimson eyes, perhaps out of curiosity, or perhaps bewitched by some magic shining within.<br>
After a nervous sigh, she finally told the story.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Sakawa：</span><br>
It IS just hearsay, though... One morning long ago—<br>

<br>
Memory - Sakura Empire Long ago?<br>
A fresh breeze reminiscent of early morning blew through the trees, whipping up robust pink petals and scattering them about.<br>
The sloped road seemed to go on forever, lined by trees shedding their petals.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Michishio：</span><br>
Oh, Yuudachi? Good morning~<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Yuudachi：</span><br>
Wooow, the sakura are in full bloom~<br>
Hm? Why are you here, Michishio? Aren't you supposed to be cleaning the courtyard at this time of day?<br>
Are you slacking off?! Do I smell a slacker?!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Michishio：</span><br>
Geez, Yuudachi, I finished cleaning hours ago~<br>
Lady Mutsu has a very important guest today, so she sent us all home early~<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Yuudachi：</span><br>
Is that the same as Lady Nagato's guest?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Michishio：</span><br>
Maybe... Isn't it unusual, though?<br>
She didn't give us any more details than that, though, so there's no point trying to guess.<br>
Heheh, by the way, I made some more sakura mochi yesterday~<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Yuudachi：</span><br>
You mean I can have some?! Your sakura mochi is the best! Let's find a place to chow down!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Michishio：</span><br>
You're so impatient! When you want to eat good food, you can't just sit anywhere willy-nilly. You need good scenery!<br>
...Hmm, but where would that be...?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Yuudachi：</span><br>
Lady Nagato's courtyard?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Michishio：</span><br>
Absolutely not! Geez~<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Yuudachi：</span><br>
Then let's sit in the grass over there! We can look at the sakura trees while we eat. Yeah, that's perfect!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Michishio：</span><br>
You just go find a place now, Yuudachi. I'll go get the cake box.<br>
...Oopsie!<br>
<br>
Not looking where she was going, Michishio ran into somebody and fell. However, her victim quickly caught her.<br>
The person she had run into – a tall woman wearing a white robe – gently brushed the flower petals off of her head.<br>
Michishio looked up at her apologetically and bowed.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Michishio：</span><br>
I'm sorry! I should've watched where I was going!<br>
<br>
.........<br>
But the tall woman had already disappeared, before the flower petals she'd brushed away could fall to the ground.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Yuudachi：</span><br>
Michishio! I found a good spot!<br>
<br>
When Michishio turned around, she saw Yuudachi sitting in the grass and waving at her.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Michishio：</span><br>
R-right! I'll go get that cake box~<br>
(That lady... was kind of weird...)<br>

<br>
Clouds blocked the moon once more, making the rooms in Musashi's abode just a little darker.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Sakawa：</span><br>
After that, Lady Nagato announced that she was resigning from her position as flagship, and that there would be combat exercises to decide her successor...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">???：</span><br>
In other words, you're saying that her mysterious guest caused it all to happen?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Sakawa：</span><br>
N-not necessarily! It's just speculation...<br>
The thing is, Lady Nagato left on a trip for a while before her announcement.<br>
But weirdly, nobody in the Sakura Empire ever SAW her doing that.<br>
The truth is...<br>
<br>
Sakawa shifted to sit on her knees seiza-style and whispered quietly.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Sakawa：</span><br>
Lady Nagato went to this "sanctuary."<br>
And she wasn't alone. I hear Musashi went with her.<br>
More than that... I went with them as Musashi's bodyguard.<br>
Anyway, that's all I know. I don't actually know what happened inside the sanctuary, okay?<br>
Only Lady Nagato, Musashi, and that weird guest I mentioned went in there.<br>
...And there you have it. That's everything I know!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">???：</span><br>
I see... So Musashi went to visit the Guardian Fox, too?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Sakawa：</span><br>
Yeah...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">???：</span><br>
This isn't related at all, but has Musashi mentioned any dreams to you lately?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Sakawa：</span><br>
Not really...? Oh, but a few days ago, she really didn't look good.<br>
It was like she was sleep-deprived... Maybe nightmares kept her from sleeping?<br>
<br>
Before the girl could answer, thunder roared outside.<br>
Lightning struck several more times until a thin, purple spear of electricity finally struck in the direction of the lake.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Sakawa：</span><br>
That's...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">???：</span><br>
Musashi's signal. I should get going.<br>
Also, you can have... Ahem. I mean, I confer this to you.<br>
It's been a while since I got to talk to someone like this, after all. Heheheh.<br>
<br>
She took Sakawa's hand and placed something small in her palm.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Sakawa：</span><br>
...Origami?<br>
<br>
On closer inspection, it wasn't a paper animal. It looked like it was modeled after some kind of head or face.<br>
The face, with two adorable horns on its head, was quite familiar to Sakawa.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Sakawa：</span><br>
Wow, this is... me, isn't it?<br>
Heheh. Thank you~♪<br>
<br>
She gingerly held the origami in her hands and gazed out the window, where the girl previously was, toward the moon outside.<br>
And she offered a heartfelt prayer.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Sakawa：</span><br>
Please, Dragon God...<br>
Make sure they all come home safe...<br>

<br>
??? – ???<br>
An ominous black fog closed in from all directions.<br>
Musashi tried to cut it away with her purple lightning blade, but the severed darkness only reformed again to attack.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Nagato：</span><br>
Bear witness! Haaaah!<br>
<br>
Materializing her mental imagery, Nagato's prayer became a guiding light that drove off the darkness.<br>
However, it was weak, and it only managed to slow the darkness's encroachment temporarily.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Nagato：</span><br>
No...!<br>
......<br>
We only have one choice now.<br>
Musashi, I'll entrust the last of the Guardian Fox's power to your blade. Strike true, and cut a way out of this situation!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Musashi：</span><br>
...You mustn't.<br>
Even if I were to escape, you...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Nagato：</span><br>
It is my duty as a miko to protect the Sakura Empire.<br>
I vowed to do so, and I showed you my resolve during our game.<br>
Bear witness... to the Guardian Fox's power!<br>
<br>
The young woman forcibly pushed the sheathed sword, imbued with the last of her power, into Musashi's arms.<br>
In the next instant, the blackness engulfed Nagato.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Musashi：</span><br>
Lady Nagato...!<br>
<br>
Pure nothingness—a world devoid of sound or light, home only to endless darkness.<br>
In the darkness of the sanctuary, memories flashed through Musashi's mind.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Nagato：</span><br>
The Sacred Sakura is withering... And the people are losing faith...<br>
A few days ago, I relinquished my position as the Combined Fleet's flagship.<br>
The Reenactments have acquiesced to it, of course, but I have one more reason.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Musashi：</span><br>
You were badly wounded in the sanctuary. At this rate, your hull...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Nagato：</span><br>
My soul will transmigrate without issue. Even without me, she whom I entrust the Sakura Empire to will do just fine.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Musashi：</span><br>
Lady Nagato, please. As long as we have the Sacred Sakura, you don't have to let yourself be sunk.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Nagato：</span><br>
Seal myself in the Sacred Sakura, hm?<br>
It is a good idea, but... There's something that I must do first.<br>
Musashi, how long do you believe I can last under these circumstances?<br>
......<br>
............<br>
...That's more than enough. Have Amagi arrange a special exercise.<br>
During the exercise, I will announce my resignation from the post of Combined Fleet flagship.<br>
<br>
*jingle*<br>
The ringing of wind chimes.<br>
Musashi sat up in bed and gazed at the moonlight outside.<br>
She thought to herself as she got dressed.<br>
It was already late at night. Hearing the noise, Sakawa came running.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Sakawa：</span><br>
Musashi? Umm, are you going out?!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Musashi：</span><br>
...Don't yell so much, please.<br>
I have urgent business with Lady Nagato. I'll be leaving at once.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Sakawa：</span><br>
Okay, but, umm... You don't look good, Musashi. Why not rest until morning?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Musashi：</span><br>
I told you, it's urgent. I mustn't waste any time.<br>
Sakawa, ensure you take good care of our guest.<br>
If she asks you any questions, tell her all you know.<br>
<br>
Musashi walked alone under the full moon.<br>
She turned around and saw the faint light of candles still burning in the castle tower through the window.<br>
It appeared that she was not the only restless one on this long night...<br>
