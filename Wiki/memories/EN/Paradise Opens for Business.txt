Paradise Opens for Business<br>
<br>
1 The Idea That Started It All<br>
Port - Pier<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
So, I'd like to present and hold a vote on various plans today.<br>
That is, plans regarding the refurbishing and expansion of the port amusement park.<br>
<br>
After adjusting the microphone to a better height, I explained why I'd gathered everyone here.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Dupleix：</span><br>
Now, Memphis and I have helped the Commander narrow it down to just a few proposals.<br>
But even after we took out the obviously ridiculous ones, there are still... a lot.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Z23：</span><br>
We'll be here forever if we have to go through all of those...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Javelin：</span><br>
Aw, who cares? It's not like we have anywhere better to be, right?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Memphis：</span><br>
True, but I think the Commander mainly held this meeting to avoid making a solo decision.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Fleuret：</span><br>
Hmm... But if the Commander won't decide, who will?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Napoli：</span><br>
Well, it's everyone's amusement park, so everyone should have a voice. Isn't that it?<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Exactly right, Napoli.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Richelieu：</span><br>
I see... Well, Commander, I have some concerns.<br>
The success of an oral presentation hinges largely on the speaker's eloquence.<br>
Meanwhile, words alone are limited in effectiveness. Or do you expect us to imagine everything based on simple explanations?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Laffey：</span><br>
Laffey's no good at this stuff... Zzzzz...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ayanami：</span><br>
I don't think I can imagine things that easily, either...<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Hmm...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Akashi：</span><br>
Nya~ In that case, I've got just the idea for you, nya~<br>
<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项1：Okay, I'm all ears.</span>'''''<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项2：(Pretend you didn't hear her.)</span>'''''<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项2）</span>'''''(If Akashi has an idea, it's sure to cost a fortune.)<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项2）</span>'''''(I'll just pretend I heard nothing... Yeah, that's a good idea.)<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Akashi：</span><br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项2）</span>'''''I know exactly what you're thinking, nya. This time, it's free, nya!<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项2）</span>'''''You mean it? Okay, let's hear it.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Akashi：</span><br>
Do you remember the fantasy adventure game we played before, nya?<br>
Ever since then, I've been tinkering with my machine to make some improvements, nya.<br>
<br>
The green cat took out a helmet-like item and raised it proudly overhead.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Akashi：</span><br>
Turn everyone's ideas into game demos, and your problem's solved, nya!<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Ooh. You know, experiencing the proposals would make it easier to give impartial votes.<br>
Wait a second. You already made devices for everyone?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Akashi：</span><br>
Of course I have... not, nya!<br>
I only have a few I can provide for free, nya. So I want you to experience them first and pick who gets to see them, nya.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Amagi：</span><br>
So you'll let a few of us wear these devices and enter a virtual amusement park... Am I understanding this correctly?<br>
In a way, it's like a shared dream.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
I see the similarity there.<br>
But you forget dreams shortly after you wake up. I doubt that's the same here...<br>
Oh, but Shinano's powers aren't that different...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Amagi：</span><br>
A dream you don't forget even after you wake up... Heehee...<br>
<br>
Amagi giggles meaningfully, but she quickly conceals her excitement.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
As for who gets to go in... I don't know how you expect me to up and choose. Do we have any volunteers?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Pittsburgh：</span><br>
Oh? You get the chance of a lifetime, and you're just giving it up?<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
I want to prioritize your opinions over my own.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Clemenceau：</span><br>
Is that so? If I may offer some advice...<br>
I would first choose a girl who both understands the fun of an amusement park AND has a level of childlike innocence. Have her give a totally subjective appraisal.<br>
Then, I would balance things by picking a second who can offer a logical, unbiased opinion on it.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Fu Shun：</span><br>
Someone who gets amusement parks... That's me, right?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Chang Chun：</span><br>
You just want to go on a park adventure all on your own!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Fu Shun：</span><br>
Aaah! Don't expose my evil motives!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Mutsuki：</span><br>
Uh-muse-ment park? That's where mommies and daddies take good girls to play, isn't it?<br>
I bet there's lots of candy there! I wanna go, I wanna go!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ark Royal：</span><br>
The little destroyers are shoo-in when it comes to innocence.<br>
The devices should be safe, but... Nuh-uh. I'm still too worried about it!<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
(If I'm to follow Clemenceau's advice, then Mutsuki really is the perfect girl for the job. But...)<br>
Okay, I've decided. The girls who get the sneak peek will be Mutsuki and Ark Royal.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ark Royal：</span><br>
Huh?! Why me?! I-I mean, understood! As you wish, Commander!<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Akashi, can you get us a few more of those headsets?<br>
I want the people who proposed each idea to be able to join in and show off what makes their proposals special.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Akashi：</span><br>
Of course, nya! I'll go grab as many as I can, nya.<br>
<br>
After deciding on the candidates and the experiment process, I give Akashi my final plan.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Once the demos are ready, I'll have you all gather in my office. Sound good?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Everyone：</span><br>
Yes, Commander!<br>
<br>
And with that, the first messy page of the amusement park chronicle came to a close.<br>

<br>
Paradise Opens for Business<br>
<br>
2 Random Superpowers<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Akashi：</span><br>
I-it's finally done, nya... Thanks to Dupleix and Memphis's help, nya...<br>
<br>
In my office, the green cat Akashi adjusted the machine. She had bags under her eyes.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Ark Royal, Mutsuki. How do you two feel?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ark Royal：</span><br>
In perfect condition, Commander!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Mutsuki：</span><br>
I'm okay as long as I get candy! Hehe~<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
By the way, Akashi, whose proposal are you starting with?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Reno：</span><br>
The one that me, Essex, San Diego, and Hornet came up with~<br>
<br>
Reno charged into the office, plopped down onto the couch, and watched Akashi tinker.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Reno：</span><br>
Satisfaction guaranteed!<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Oh, yeah? How's it going, Akashi?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Akashi：</span><br>
Systems normal... Okay, nya!<br>
<br>
I nodded back and signaled the start of the exercise.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Have fun in there, everyone.<br>
<br>
After feeling temporary numbness at the top of their heads, the girls' vision began to blur.<br>
They felt an odd sense of weightlessness, neither floating nor falling.<br>
Eventually, the odd sensation faded, and...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ark Royal：</span><br>
Is this... an arcade?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Reno：</span><br>
Yep! This is the lynchpin of our proposal!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Mutsuki：</span><br>
Arr-kayd? Is that a kind of animal?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Reno：</span><br>
No, it's for games! Try using the gachapon machine there in the middle!<br>
<br>
On Reno's urging, the girls try spinning the dial...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ark Royal：</span><br>
What happened just now?<br>
Huh? My clothes...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Mutsuki：</span><br>
Mine changed, too!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Reno：</span><br>
Yep! You two are superheroes now!<br>
When you spin the random superpower gacha, you get REAL... virtual superpowers!<br>
You get hero outfits to match, too, and then you get warped to the real amusement park!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ark Royal：</span><br>
Goodness. So my power is...<br>
Uhhh... Sloppy Shooter? I can make a gun out of thin air, and I have infinite bullets, but I always miss?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Mutsuki：</span><br>
I got Ultimate Reindeer Tamer! When I sit down, I get a sleigh and reindeer!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ark Royal：</span><br>
Reno, these superpowers... are just a little bit useless.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Reno：</span><br>
Uhh, ahem... If you want to be a respected hero, you'll need to learn to use those powers!<br>
I'll show you to the superhero labyrinth escape room right away! You'll understand when we get there!<br>
<br>
After showing them to the labyrinth's entrance, Reno explained the rules of the escape room.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Reno：</span><br>
Okay, there you go! Use those powers to the fullest!<br>
<br>
After she ran off, the labyrinth walls shuddered and shook, blocking the path forward.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Mutsuki：</span><br>
There's a red thing over there! A candy apple...?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ark Royal：</span><br>
Hm? You mean that button there?<br>
Stand back, Mutsuki! I'll try pressing it by firing at it!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Mutsuki：</span><br>
Okay! But can you hit it?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ark Royal：</span><br>
Even if I'm cursed to miss, I'll hit it eventually if I just fire at random!<br>
<br>
Ark Royal aimed her gun in the opposite direction from the button and pulled the trigger.<br>
The bullet took an abrupt U-turn and flew straight for the red button.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ark Royal：</span><br>
Huh?! It worked?!<br>
<br>
It hit the button, pressing it and causing the walls to move again.<br>
And not just the walls – the floor at their feet changed, too!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Mutsuki：</span><br>
Hehe, this is fun! It's like a tram-puh-leen!<br>
<br>
The floor suddenly turned elastic. Struggling to keep her balance, Ark Royal tried to approach her partner.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ark Royal：</span><br>
M-Mutsuki, try sitting down!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Mutsuki：</span><br>
Hm? Wanna play with the reindeer? Okay! That sounds like extra fun... There!<br>
<br>
The two of them sat down in a sleigh – after much struggling on Ark Royal's part – and the reindeer pulling it began bouncing forth.<br>
This allowed them to avoid many traps and gimmicks. Eventually, they arrived at a passage blocked by a wall.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Mutsuki：</span><br>
More red things! Three... buttons? Is that what they're called?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ark Royal：</span><br>
Yes, those are indeed buttons.<br>
Pressing them all at once seems unlikely. But with my superpower...<br>
<br>
She pulled the trigger once more. Miraculously, the bullet bounced and struck all three buttons.<br>
...But not without hitting a few dozen trap-triggering switches in the process!<br>
The labyrinth began to morph wildly.<br>
Once the changes had settled, the two of them realized that they were right in front of the exit.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Reno：</span><br>
Oooh! Congrats on your victory!<br>
Heheh, how'd you like it? Did the superpowers help?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ark Royal：</span><br>
They were a little too ridiculous, but... sure. They helped.<br>
<br>
After they'd experienced a few kinds of attractions, the three of them logged out of their terminals.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
How was it?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Mutsuki：</span><br>
It was fun! When I sat down, reindeer appeared!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ark Royal：</span><br>
Hmm... I did enjoy it, but I struggle to see how it can be implemented in real life.<br>
I mean, getting random superpowers from a gachapon machine and using them to conquer the attractions isn't exactly realistic to begin with.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Reno：</span><br>
R-right... That's the whole point of superpowers, huh? They're not real...<br>
What a silly, obvious mistake we made...<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Sorry, but I think I'll have to deny this one.<br>
Everyone's tired, so let's call it for today. You two can try the next one tomorrow.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ark Royal & Mutsuki：</span><br>
- Roger! - Okaaay!<br>

<br>
3 Vying Melodies<br>
An unexpected visitor came to my office.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Strasbourg?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Strasbourg：</span><br>
Aww, are you that surprised to see me?<br>
I get it. The original plan was for Friedrich Carl and West Virginia to present their plan...<br>
But when I expressed my desire to use Akashi's device, they let me do it.<br>
<br>
She sidles over to me and whispers into my ear.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Strasbourg：</span><br>
It's just such a shame you're not part of the experiment...<br>
I was so very interested in what melodies you'd play at the attractions.<br>
But there will be more opportunities... won't there?<br>
<br>
After flashing a mischievous grin, she leaves me.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Akashi：</span><br>
Strasbourg! Over here, nya~ I'll put your headset on for you, nya~<br>
<br>
Upon the cat's beckoning, she goes and sits next to Ark Royal and Mutsuki.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Akashi：</span><br>
If it feels like ants are crawling on your head, that's normal, nya~ Known issue, nya!<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Hmm? I didn't feel anything like that last time I wore one.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Akashi：</span><br>
Look, I had to turn that giant machine into a portable headset, nya! There are gonna be bugs, nya!<br>
Final adjustments done, nya~ Turn it on when you're ready, nya!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ark Royal：</span><br>
Mutsuki and I are ready.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Strasbourg：</span><br>
Likewise.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Okay. Now starting round two of the amusement park demo.<br>
<br>
One bout of numbness and weightlessness later...<br>
When the girls opened their eyes, they were in another world.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Mutsuki：</span><br>
There are lines in the sky... and tadpoles?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Strasbourg：</span><br>
Those are musical staffs and notes.<br>
More importantly, take a look at yourselves.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ark Royal：</span><br>
Hmm...? When did I change clothes?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Mutsuki：</span><br>
I look like I'm going to a festival!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Strasbourg：</span><br>
That's right. Our amusement park idea is themed after music.<br>
So I had you changed into outfits that matched your personal tastes and the amusement park theme.<br>
The specifications were left vague. I'm amazed that they made such a detailed world out of them...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Mutsuki：</span><br>
Music? Notes? I don't really get it...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ark Royal：</span><br>
Strasbourg, this park feels a tad inaccessible to the layman.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Strasbourg：</span><br>
You'll understand when you try it. Come with me.<br>
<br>
They proceeded through the park overflowing with music and arrived at a giant attraction.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Mutsuki：</span><br>
So many toy cars!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ark Royal：</span><br>
They're not exactly toys, Mutsuki – they're bumper cars.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Strasbourg：</span><br>
That's right. Each of them represents a musical instrument.<br>
Fittingly, this attraction is called the Bumper Symphony.<br>
When the cars bump into each other, they play sounds. Said sounds compose a song via the attraction's control system.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Mutsuki：</span><br>
Wow! Can it play "The Wheels on the Bumper Car"?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Strasbourg：</span><br>
Um... P-probably not...?<br>
Go on. Pick the car instrument that suits your fancy.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ark Royal：</span><br>
Okay... I'll go for the harp car. Mutsuki?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Mutsuki：</span><br>
I want that long one with the head and tail!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ark Royal：</span><br>
You mean the violin?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Mutsuki：</span><br>
Yeah! It looks like a stretched-out candy apple! I wanna ride that one!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Strasbourg：</span><br>
By the way, if you go into the golden area on the edge of the lot, the song will reach its high point.<br>
<br>
The girls got into their cars. On Strasbourg's signal, they began playing.<br>
Ark Royal's harp car struck a wall, and a lovely harp chord played.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Mutsuki：</span><br>
Me, too!<br>
<br>
When she heard it, Mutsuki spun her steering wheel and rammed her violin car into Ark Royal's harp car.<br>
The two instruments played a beautiful melody.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ark Royal：</span><br>
Good stuff, Mutsuki! Keep it up!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Mutsuki：</span><br>
Really? Okay, here I go again!<br>
<br>
The violin car drifted... and the sudden rotation sent it careening into the unmanned drum car.<br>
A powerful, rhythmic drum beat played... but it failed to mesh with the violin's dulcet tones.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Mutsuki：</span><br>
Aww... That sucked!<br>
<br>
Mutsuki let go of the steering wheel.<br>
The violin and harp cars collided again. Then they struck the sax, horn, triangle, and so on...<br>
The whole lot was full of a mad cacophony of random instruments.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ark Royal：</span><br>
I-it's okay! Let's do it again! If we can get into the golden area, we might just save this!<br>
<br>
While other cars kept on bouncing and making random sounds, the two manned cars entered the golden area at the same time, forcing the song to its climax.<br>
It made a melody that was light yet rich, profound yet uncanny.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ark Royal：</span><br>
Yeah... We might need Strasbourg's help for this.<br>
<br>
When Strasbourg stopped the attraction's control system, the two of them hastily got out of their bumper cars.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ark Royal：</span><br>
I'm sorry. I feel like I just stepped into musical hell...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Strasbourg：</span><br>
Don't worry. It wasn't so messy... In fact, it was bellicoso, in a way.<br>
However, that did prove some of the flaws in our design.<br>
I'll have the Commander deny this proposal.<br>
<br>
The girls woke up and took off their headset terminals.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Strasbourg：</span><br>
Commander, I must apologize. You can deny our proposal.<br>
If there's another opportunity, we'll correct its flaws and devise a more perfect plan.<br>
<br>
There was a smile on her face, but her voice had an air of disappointment to it.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Don't brood over it too much. If you have any good ideas, come to me whenever.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Strasbourg：</span><br>
Now you've said it... Keep that up, and I'll just want to monopolize you more and more.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Hmm?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Strasbourg：</span><br>
Just talking to myself. Everyone seems tired, so shall we consider ourselves done for the day?<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Sure. You two get some rest, and I'll see you tomorrow.<br>

<br>
4 The Sweetest Roller Coaster!<br>
My office is even livelier than usual compared to the past few days.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Fu Shun：</span><br>
Whaaat?! Let ME go, An Shan! I'm the one who improved on the proposal!<br>
Besides, I have experience using those headsets, so I'm the best candidate for the job!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">An Shan：</span><br>
Absolutely not! If you go in there, you'll cause nothing but trouble!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Lung Wu：</span><br>
Then what if we sent Vestal?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Vestal：</span><br>
Huh? Me? I think someone more... energetic and lively should go.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Hu Pen：</span><br>
Then... should this tiger go?<br>
<br>
Hu Pen timidly raised her hand.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Fu Shun：</span><br>
Aww... I wanted to play with the headsets again...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">An Shan：</span><br>
Fu Shun! I knew you were up to no good!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Akashi：</span><br>
Nyahaha! When I update these bad boys and officially launch, you'll be the first to know!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Fu Shun：</span><br>
Sold! Can't wait!<br>
<br>
Fu Shun swiftly preordered her own headset, and Akashi gleefully adjusted the device.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ark Royal：</span><br>
So many skilled chefs under one roof... I have to assume this proposal is related to cooking?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Hu Pen：</span><br>
Heheh~ You'll get the answer to that when you go inside!<br>
<br>
With everyone ready, I announced the start of the third demonstration.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
(Food and adventure, huh? Now even I'm starting to feel the FOMO.)<br>
<br>
Another wave of now-familiar numbness and weightlessness...<br>
...And the three of them were faced with a giant refrigerator.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Hu Pen：</span><br>
Uh, ahaha... The whole "entrance is a refrigerator" thing was Lung Wu's idea. Little unique, huh...<br>
Whoa! When did we all change clothes?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ark Royal：</span><br>
Hmm? Isn't that how your amusement park works?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Hu Pen：</span><br>
I had no idea... Maybe Fu Shun added that when she was improving the plan?<br>
Ah, who cares! Tigers don't fuss over details. Let's get in there!<br>
<br>
When they went into the refrigerator, a very unusual roller coaster appeared before them.<br>
The rails split into several different colors, with decorations modeled after various vegetables and seasonings set up near them.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Hu Pen：</span><br>
At first, we just wanted to add a space to eat tasty food in the amusement park...<br>
But since we were designing a whole park, Fu Shun said we should build a place for adventure!<br>
After incorporating and adjusting everyone's ideas, we came up with this roller coaster!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ark Royal：</span><br>
It sure looks interesting, but I wonder if it isn't too dangerous for little Mutsuki here.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Hu Pen：</span><br>
Ngh... True! But it's just a virtual coaster, so it's fine, I think!<br>
Anyway, just get on! Umm... I think it was called the Roller Coaster of Flavor?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Mutsuki：</span><br>
Yaaay! I wanna ride!<br>
<br>
After the two had sat down and secured themselves, the coaster rushed forth at incredible speed, as if it had rockets attached to it.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ark Royal：</span><br>
Aaaaaah!<br>
I-I can't handle thiiiiis!<br>
<br>
Ark Royal's cries echoed through the virtual sky.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Mutsuki：</span><br>
Wheeeee! This is even more fun than the toy caaaars!<br>
<br>
The coaster took a turn. Suddenly, they smelled – and TASTED – something sweet!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ark Royal：</span><br>
We can actually taste it?!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Mutsuki：</span><br>
It's tanghulu! Mmm, tasty!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ark Royal：</span><br>
Smell aside, how in the world are you feeding it to the people on board?<br>
<br>
While Ark Royal thought about it, the coaster reached its next turn.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ark Royal：</span><br>
*sniff*... I know that smell.<br>
Is that the Dragon Empery's legendary aged vinegar?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Mutsuki：</span><br>
Uuurgh...<br>
<br>
Mutsuki grimaced at the pungent stench.<br>
Yet the roller coaster's inexorable march continued on.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Mutsuki：</span><br>
Waaaaah, it's bitter... Eeeew!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ark Royal：</span><br>
Watch out! The next one is... Huh?!<br>
<br>
The flavor coaster journey ended with Ark Royal red-faced, and Mutsuki crying from the sheer spiciness.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Hu Pen：</span><br>
Sorry! I didn't think it'd be that bad...<br>
Aww, I really messed up... L-let's just leave...<br>
<br>
All of them logged out in short order.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Fu Shun：</span><br>
How was it?! Did you LOVE it?<br>
Of course you did! After all, the queen of adventure, Fu Shun herself, was the mastermind behind it!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Hu Pen：</span><br>
I thought the food lounge idea was better, honestly...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Fu Shun：</span><br>
Whaaat?! A negative opinion?!<br>
<br>
After seeing off the dejected Fu Shun and her poor friends, I sat at my desk and thought to myself.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
(Hmm... Doing this one by one is too inefficient.)<br>
Akashi, can you collect the remaining ideas for me?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Akashi：</span><br>
I CAN, nya, but...<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Actually, forget it. I see only unmitigated chaos in that situation.<br>
Let's do this. First, create one big amusement park.<br>
Partition each idea off in its own section. Don't let any section interfere with the others' operation.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Akashi：</span><br>
Nya~ Now that's doable, nya!<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Then let's do it. This time, I'll join in – that should improve efficiency, too.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ark Royal：</span><br>
Nice! I'd love to tour the park with you, Commander!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Mutsuki：</span><br>
I wanna play house while we explore!<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Ahaha... Anyway, let's leave the rest to Akashi. You two, go home and rest.<br>
I'll call you when her work is done.<br>

<br>
The girls spotted a castle with a pointed roof, the kind you'd only see in fairy tales.<br>
Sunlight reflected off the watchtower and lit up the park with dreamy lighting.<br>
A light, cheerful melody played, and the park air was full of the smell of sweet cotton candy.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ark Royal：</span><br>
Huh? It just started, just like that?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Mutsuki：</span><br>
We didn't change clothes this time! And the park is so big!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ark Royal：</span><br>
We really didn't... Where's the Commander? Already in the park?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Mutsuki：</span><br>
I dunno, either! But I wanna play right away!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ark Royal：</span><br>
Then let's both search for the Commander AND have fun!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Mutsuki：</span><br>
Okaaay!<br>
<br>
Thus, the two of them scoured the new amusement park.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ark Royal：</span><br>
They're all normal attractions, but so high-end...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Mutsuki：</span><br>
Spinny teacups! I wanna ride those!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ark Royal：</span><br>
Wait, Mutsuki. How in the world do you get these to run...?<br>
The seats are such high quality. I wonder how comfortable they are...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Amagi：</span><br>
Heehee. Why don't the two of you just sit down? I'll operate the ride for you.<br>
<br>
They heard a gentle voice behind them.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ark Royal：</span><br>
Amagi...? Are you in charge of introducing this park today?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Amagi：</span><br>
Well yes, but actually no.<br>
<br>
The red figure approached them with a meaningful look on her face.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Amagi：</span><br>
This is your...no, all the port's image of the ideal park.<br>
You could even call it your dream.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ark Royal：</span><br>
Dream...?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Mutsuki：</span><br>
I don't get it...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Amagi：</span><br>
Do the two of you remember how you got here?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ark Royal：</span><br>
Huh? We, uh... umm...<br>
I can't remember.<br>
How DID I get here?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Mutsuki：</span><br>
I was taking a nap, and I ended up here!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ark Royal：</span><br>
You were asleep? Oh... Now that you mention it, I remember falling asleep, too...<br>
Does that mean we really are dreaming?<br>
It feels too real, though...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Amagi：</span><br>
Heehee. That is the wonder of dreams... but also a little experiment of mine.<br>
Consider it a sweet dream, relax, and enjoy yourselves.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ark Royal：</span><br>
Will we remember what happened here when we wake up?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Amagi：</span><br>
If you do...<br>
No, no. Isn't it normal for dreams to be forgotten upon waking?<br>
Forget the trivial details. Enjoy the paradise of your dreams to your hearts' content.<br>
<br>
*snap!*<br>
Amagi snapped her fingers. Ark Royal and Mutsuki were bathed in warm light.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Amagi：</span><br>
This isn't quite like me, but it's fun to shake things up once in a while.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Mutsuki：</span><br>
Huh?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ark Royal：</span><br>
Whoa. Did you just change our clothes?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Amagi：</span><br>
In the paradise of your dreams, should you not have a trick that dresses you effortlessly?<br>
<br>
Her fox tail swayed slightly behind her, adding a cunning air to her narrowed eyes.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Amagi：</span><br>
Now, I'd best be going. Have a lovely time.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ark Royal：</span><br>
Where are you going?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Amagi：</span><br>
I'm off to meet the person you were searching for.<br>
The Commander, of course. Heehee.<br>
<br>
With one last smile, Amagi disappeared into a sudden flurry of petals.<br>
Paradise Opens for Business<br>
