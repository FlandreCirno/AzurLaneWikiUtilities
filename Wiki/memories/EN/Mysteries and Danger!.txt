Mysteries and Danger!<br>
<br>
1 Where's the Hidden Passage?!<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
(As I recall, my new secretary ship starting today was...)<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Fu Shun：</span><br>
Commander! Destroyer Fu Shun, reporting for her first day of secretary work!<br>
<br>
An energetic voice fills my office. I can already tell that today's going to be a hectic day.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Fu Shun：</span><br>
Right, so... The first thing a new secretary ship does is... check your schedule? Let's see what you've got... Hmm, yep...<br>
You have a meeting at noon, so you should understand the important parts in advance, right? I'll go print the materials!<br>
Commander, are you thirsty? Do you want coffee or juice? Oh, or maybe tea after all?<br>
Commander, you need to sign this report. I'll leave it on your desk!<br>
Commander...<br>
<br>
I'd expected things to be more chaotic with her here, so it surprises me how seriously she takes the job.<br>
It seems safe to delegate work to her, so I can head to the meeting with peace of mind.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
It's almost time for the meeting. I'll leave this work to you, Fu Shun.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Fu Shun：</span><br>
Got it! Rest assured, your work is in capable hands!<br>
<br>
After a while, Fu Shun stops working.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Fu Shun：</span><br>
Oookay, that's enough work for one day! Now it's time for... Investigation! Adventure!<br>
Oh, hidden passage, where are yooou~♪ It's gotta be behind that bookshelf~♪<br>
<br>
After my meeting, I open the door to my office—<br>
There, I find my bookshelf moved out of place, books and documents scattered all over the floor, and one panicked Fu Shun.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Fu Shun：</span><br>
Huh? Commander? You're back early... Th-the meeting is over? That was too fast!<br>
Taking advantage of your absence to do mischief? Pssh, who, me? Never! This is just... Yeah, an investigation! Yep! I'm investigating stuff!<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Investigating?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Fu Shun：</span><br>
I'm seeing if there are any hidden passages leading out of your office! Moving the bookshelf and books were just to check for traps!<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
I should hope there aren't any hidden passages, let alone traps. There... aren't, right?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Fu Shun：</span><br>
Hey, there's no need to jump to conclusions! Maybe you just never noticed, right?<br>
I already started the job. Let's search together!<br>
My secretary work and stuff? I already finished it while you were out at your meeting! Let's use the rest of the day to investigate!<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
(Should I correct her attitude toward work here? No, I'd feel bad stopping her now...)<br>
(Ah, whatever. She took her job seriously in the morning. I'll manage the afternoon work myself.)<br>
<br>
I manage to weave through the piles of books on the carpet, sit at my desk, and get to work.<br>

Mysteries and Danger!<br>
<br>
2 Day in the Life of a Secretary Ship<br>
As the sun sets and another day of work comes to an end, there's a knock at the office door.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">An Shan：</span><br>
Commander, it's An Shan and Tai Yuan. May we come in?<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Be my guest... Oh.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">An Shan：</span><br>
Thank you. Coming in—Hm? The door won't move... at all, in fact.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Tai Yuan：</span><br>
Hngh... It's like something is blocking it... We can't open it from here.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Fu Shun：</span><br>
Comiiing! Wait, An Shan?!<br>
H-hold on a second! I-I'm cleaning up!<br>
<br>
After some confusion, Fu Shun cleans the books off of the floor, and An Shan and Tai Yuan finally get to enter.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">An Shan：</span><br>
Fu Shun, what are you doing?! This map is supposed to be on that wall there! Why'd you take it off and throw it on the floor?<br>
Also, why is the carpet all flipped up?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Tai Yuan：</span><br>
A-An Shan, be careful! You're going to knock down that pile of books...!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">An Shan：</span><br>
Fu Shuuun! I knew I shouldn't have let you be a secretary ship! You're troubling the Commander with all your mischief!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Fu Shun：</span><br>
Aaaah, An Shan, don't get mad! I-I promise, I'm doing my job! Right now, I'm just, um, investigating stuff...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">An Shan：</span><br>
Investigating WHAT, exactly?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Fu Shun：</span><br>
Like... whether or not there's a hidden passage in this office...?<br>
That's why all this stuff is all around, y'know... Hehe!<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
It's okay, An Shan. I could've stopped her, and I didn't.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Fu Shun：</span><br>
Yeah! The Commander didn't stop me!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">An Shan：</span><br>
Fu Shuuun!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Fu Shun：</span><br>
Ack! I'm sorry, An Shan! I'll get this office spick and span on the double!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">An Shan：</span><br>
Really... Commander, you mustn't spoil her. It's a secretary ship's job to help you work.<br>
As her older sister, I must apologize on her behalf. I'm truly sorry, Commander.<br>
I won't let her go until your office is back to normal! Of course, I'll help, too.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
I would like it back in its usual state, but...<br>
You have an exercise tonight, don't you? Are you sure you should be here, An Shan?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">An Shan：</span><br>
Urk... I'm sure if we try hard, I'll make it in time... Hopefully.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Fu Shun：</span><br>
Don't worry, An Shan! Even if we don't finish in time, I'll be here. You can go to your exercise while I finish the job!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Tai Yuan：</span><br>
I-I'll help, too!<br>

Mysteries and Danger!<br>
<br>
3 The Mystery of the Mysterious Abandoned Factory<br>
Fu Shun's destructive power exceeds expectations. Even when moonlight begins to shine through the window, the cleanup effort is still incomplete.<br>
An Shan leaves on time to get to her nighttime exercise, but she urges Fu Shun to get everything back to normal before running out of my office.<br>
After a little longer...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Fu Shun：</span><br>
Okay, Tai Yuan! Let's go, too!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Tai Yuan：</span><br>
Huh? A-aren't we supposed to finish cleaning before we go? We haven't put all the books back yet...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Fu Shun：</span><br>
Commander! Can we go home now? I'll be back to clean up tomorrow! Pretty please! I'll never ask you for anything again!<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
You have cleaned up most of it, so I don't really mind. But didn't you promise An Shan you wouldn't leave until it was all done?<br>
Did something important come up?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Fu Shun：</span><br>
Heheheh, weeell, there's a mystery of the port that I just gotta bag!<br>
Chang Chun told me there's a rumor about a weird, shady figure showing up at the abandoned factory at night, and I wanna investigate it!<br>
It's the perfect time. Tai Yuan, come with me!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Tai Yuan：</span><br>
D-do I have to go, too? Aww, I don't want to... I'd rather stay here and pick up the books...<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
(Knowing Tai Yuan, I doubt she wants to go investigate mysteries this late at night...)<br>
(But that doesn't mean I want to make her clean up all on her own.)<br>
Tai Yuan, you go back to your room and get some rest.<br>
Fu Shun... I worry too much to let you check it out alone.<br>
I'll come with you.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Fu Shun：</span><br>
Hmph. Why do I feel like you don't trust me... Not that it matters! Let's go!<br>
<br>
Fu Shun leads me to the abandoned factory far from the center of the port.<br>
The factory, overgrown with plants, is wrapped in the dark of night. We peek inside, but the moonlight isn't enough for us to see anything.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
I think I remember this factory was abandoned after we relocated...<br>
It does feel like a place where strange things would happen.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Fu Shun：</span><br>
Heheh. You think so, too? I knew it...<br>
W-wait! Commander, don't just go in!<br>
It's an old building, and there's no light. We have to be ready before we go in!<br>
Fortunately, I happened to bring a flashlight! Tadaaa!<br>
What will we find inside? A lost monster? A wandering spirit? Ooor...<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
I appreciate you trying to liven up the search...<br>
But can you stop shining the flashlight up at your face while you do it?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Fu Shun：</span><br>
Heheh! Did I scare you?<br>

<br>
Mysteries and Danger!<br>
<br>
4 Ghost Spotted!<br>
With only the flashlight to guide us, Fu Shun and I walk through the factory.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Fu Shun：</span><br>
Heeey! Anyone theeere?<br>
Whoa, this place is big. Did you hear that echo?<br>
You think if someone was here, they'd be too scared of all my yelling to come out?<br>
Mmm, would they be that cowardly...?<br>
Besides, don't you think it's more fun if we openly announce our presence?<br>
*sigh*... All this walking, though, and not a single ghost or monster... There aren't any hallways or rooms, either.<br>
Hmm... Should we search the office? Maybe we'll find something saucy, like an abandoned safe!<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Don't rush so much. Watch your step!<br>
<br>
I can hardly get the words out before Fu Shun staggers and loses her balance.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Fu Shun：</span><br>
Whoa?! I-I just felt a mysterious force! ...And it almost made me fall flat on my face!<br>
Something mysterious is going on here!<br>
C-could it be... it's trying to stop me from learning too much? Is it WARNING me?!<br>
Have we already stepped into the danger zone?!<br>
<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项1：I think your shoelaces are just loose.</span>'''''<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项2：Maybe you tripped over a cord.</span>'''''<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Fu Shun：</span><br>
Come ON, Commander. You should learn when to play along.<br>
Anyway, let's get to the next area!<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
(Fu Shun sure is enjoying herself... Maybe I should try to have fun, too.)<br>
<br>
Fu Shun and I go to the area where the office is.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Fu Shun：</span><br>
Aww, it's more plain than I expected... I thought maybe there'd at least be wooden stairs...<br>
Not maintained for years, so worn out that they crack and break when you step on them... That would at least add to the mood!<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Well, no. Abandoned or not, this is still a port facility, so it's not going to be that delicate.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Fu Shun：</span><br>
Fair... That's a shame. But there should still be value in investigating it!<br>
Ooh, look at those safety regulations on the wall! And next to it... Oh! The factory floor plan! It looks like we're on the first floor, huh?<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Let's see... There's a reference room on the third floor. Want to go?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Fu Shun：</span><br>
Of course! A reference room must be a whole treasure trove of secrets.<br>
It looks like the stairs are at the end of the hallway! Let's go!<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Careful, now...<br>
<br>
The overeager Fu Shun ignores my warning and charges forward, armed with only a flashlight.<br>
*rip!* I hear the sound of clothes tearing, followed by Fu Shun's screams.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Fu Shun：</span><br>
Whoa?! C-Commander, I can't move!<br>
<br>
When Fu Shun struggles to escape what's holding her back, there's a clicking sound.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Wait... A hidden passage...?<br>
<br>
The wall in front of me slowly moves aside, revealing an unknown corridor.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Fu Shun：</span><br>
A hidden passage! It was real!<br>

<br>
5 A Mystery Unveiled!<br>
The two of us proceed through the hidden corridor together.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Fu Shun：</span><br>
Huh? Is it just me, or are the temperature and humidity changing...?<br>
Commander, I think we're going underground.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Agreed. But what do you think this passage is connected to?<br>
<br>
*beep beep!*<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Fu Shun：</span><br>
Commander, do you hear something?<br>
<br>
Fu Shun whispers to me. I find myself tensing up a little.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Do we need to whisper?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Fu Shun：</span><br>
Ahem... I mean, it's a real hidden passage. Even I'm gonna get a little nervous...<br>
Wait! Th-this is bad! Something's rushing at us from up ahead!<br>
Green... eyes?! Aaah... Is it a ghost?!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">???：</span><br>
Who... Who's there?<br>
<br>
There's a trembling voice in the darkness—Ingraham's voice.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Fu Shun：</span><br>
Oh... The green-eyed thing was just Ingraham's little helper robot.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ingraham：</span><br>
Phew... It's just Fu Shun and the Commander. I thought YOU were scary ghosts.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
(Looks like we scared each other.)<br>
<br>
After a moment, everyone calms down, and Ingraham questions us.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ingraham：</span><br>
Why did the two of you come to the factory's underground warehouse?<br>
So late at night, at that...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Fu Shun：</span><br>
Well, to us, you're the mysterious one for walking around this factory all alone in the middle of the night.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ingraham：</span><br>
I just came to look for any materials that were forgotten during the move. They're planning to demolish the building, after all.<br>
Taking inventory at this time of night won't get in anyone's way.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
So they're finally planning to clear this plot of land?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ingraham：</span><br>
Yep. Tomorrow, I'll be supervising the blasting process.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Fu Shun：</span><br>
I get it now... You've been here taking inventory every night, and that's why Chang Chun thought you were the mystery of the abandoned factory...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ingraham：</span><br>
Mystery of the abandoned factory? Come again?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Fu Shun：</span><br>
Nothing. Don't worry about it! Heheh!<br>
Oookay, that marks the end of our search! The mystery is unveiled to be none other than Ingraham!<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Aren't you disappointed that the mystery was all a big misunderstanding?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Fu Shun：</span><br>
Nope! Quite the opposite, in fact! Today was a ton of fun!<br>
Having fun exploring is what satisfies me! The results and truth don't matter one bit!<br>
An abandoned factory, mysteries and legends, walking through the darkness with just a flashlight... That's where the real fun lies!<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
(So the adventure matters more than the destination? Maybe that's why she can always get so fired up over mysteries?)<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ingraham：</span><br>
Speaking of, my work here is very nearly done. Do you have any more business here?<br>
If not, let's go back together.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Fu Shun：</span><br>
Okay! Heheh~ It's the perfect time at night for me to share some of my own stories of the port's mysteries!<br>
What do you say? Want to hear some crazy true stories about the port?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ingraham：</span><br>
W-well, not really... Let's keep quiet and watch our steps, instead...<br>
<br>
Thus, the three of us quietly proceed through the passage...<br>
...Until we hear an odd sound on the other end.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
What was that?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Fu Shun：</span><br>
You heard that, too, Commander? It was like a click, and then... nothing?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ingraham：</span><br>
Did my robot malfunction? No... That sound was unfamiliar.<br>
C-could it be... one of those mysteries you were talking about?!<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Fu Shun, let's not investigate this one, okay?<br>
<br>
I look to Fu Shun. For some reason, she's looking down and fiddling with her phone.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ingraham：</span><br>
Fu Shun? Are you sending a message, or...?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Fu Shun：</span><br>
Hm? Oh, did you say something?<br>
That was just a random noise. Nothing to worry about!<br>
Okay, everyone! Let's go home already! There's nothing to investigate here!<br>
Commander, Ingraham! Let's get going!<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
(She was having fun before. Why has she lost all interest in this factory now? Something's off...)<br>
(Hmm... I'll keep a close eye on Fu Shun for a while.)<br>
<br>
The adventure of the mystery of the abandoned factory ends confusingly and unsatisfactorily.<br>
Is that just the nature of a mystery—that sometimes, some questions simply go unanswered?<br>
{{折叠面板|内容结束}}

{{折叠面板|标题=The Secret Only You Know - Part 1|选项=6|主框=1|样式=primary|展开=是}}
<br>
Early the next morning, I enter my office as usual.<br>
All of the books that had been left on the floor last night have been put back, and the carpet and map are in their rightful places. And...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Chang Chun：</span><br>
Commander, good morning!<br>
Oh? You look confused. Are you wondering why I'm here instead of Fu Shun?<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
You read my mind. Isn't she my secretary ship for today?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Chang Chun：</span><br>
Maybe she went off somewhere? Heheh, I don't really know~<br>
By the way, you went to the abandoned factory together, right? How'd it go?<br>
Did you find the truth of one of the mysteries of the port?<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
We did. The shady figure appearing there lately was Ingraham.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Chang Chun：</span><br>
Oh, I see! Everyone must have been surprised when you ran into each other, I'd bet.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Yes...?<br>
(Why does she sound like she knows all this?)<br>
<br>
Before I can ask her, there's a loud noise outside. It's so intense that it rattles the windows.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Chang Chun：</span><br>
Hmm... Was the factory demolition supposed to be this early?<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Ingraham probably scheduled such an early time so she wouldn't cause any trouble for people.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Chang Chun：</span><br>
I was so surprised when I learned it was getting destroyed! Well, not that it matters, since it sounds like it's done.<br>
Phew, okay! Everything's all cleaned up! Bye bye, Commander~<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Thanks for your help. Take the rest of the day to rest, okay?<br>
<br>
As I look upon my restored office, I remember the question that Chang Chun had brushed off.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Now, where is Fu Shun?<br>
<br>
After a while, Fu Shun finally comes in to work late.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Fu Shun：</span><br>
Commander! Sorry, sorry! I totally forgot I had secretary work today!<br>
I smell like smoke? Uhh, well, I went to the demolition site!<br>
Here, I'll open a window and get some fresh air in! Huh, wait...<br>
You finished cleaning up?<br>
Did you do it all yourself, Commander? Aww, I'm really sorry...!<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Not quite. I was planning to...<br>
But Chang Chun got here before me, finished it up, and went home.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Fu Shun：</span><br>
Wow... Chang Chun did it, huh?<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Hm? Are you saying you didn't ask her to do it?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Fu Shun：</span><br>
No? It's not like I told her to come in for me. Like I said, I forgot all about my secretary duty today...<br>
*whispering* If she came here, she must have been worried about that...<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Hm?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Fu Shun：</span><br>
Nothing! Anyway, let's start today's work, Commander!<br>
<br>
Later the same day, Ingraham comes to visit my office.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ingraham：</span><br>
I'm here to bring the report on today's demolition of the abandoned factory. I'll leave it on your desk.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Fu Shun：</span><br>
Oh, Ingraham! That explosion was awesome! One big bang, and the building is gone!<br>
It's such a shame I forgot to bring fireworks! If I launched them when you detonated the building, that would've been a real sight to see!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ingraham：</span><br>
I wouldn't let you! That's dangerous.<br>
Anyway, the demolition was completed without issue.<br>
And one more thing...<br>
That odd sound from last night has been on my mind, so I went to check on it one more time first thing in the morning.<br>
In doing so, I found evidence that there was a fourth person there—someone other than you, Fu Shun, and I.<br>
I don't know who they were, why they were there, or if they were even there at the same time as us...<br>
But I made an evacuation announcement before the demolition, and I confirmed nobody was inside, so they couldn't have been crushed.<br>
My investigation on the fourth person is included in the report. Commander, take a look at it some time.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Fu Shun：</span><br>
Th-there couldn't have been a fourth person! It must have been a ghost, or something, ahaha...<br>
I know! Your investigation must have been flawed, Ingraham! Yeah, there's NO way anyone else was there.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
(Fu Shun... Could you be any more suspicious if you tried?)<br>
(Chang Chun in my office first thing in the morning, those odd remarks, Fu Shun's weird reaction... I think I know who that fourth person is already.)<br>
(Fu Shun knows, too. That's why she's trying her hardest to cover up for her sister ship.)<br>
(I guess even a troublemaker like her can be a caring sister.)<br>

<br>
Even later that day...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">An Shan：</span><br>
I'm sorry, Commander... I'm just here to check up on Fu Shun. I've been worried sick about her.<br>
Fu Shun. You haven't done anything to trouble the Commander today, have you?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Fu Shun：</span><br>
Not at all! I did every last bit of my secretary ship work!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">An Shan：</span><br>
And you mean that?<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
She did. Fu Shun's been a big help today. I think she does a great job as secretary.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">An Shan：</span><br>
Commander, if she's causing trouble, I want you to tell me without hesitation. I hear she dragged you to the abandoned factory late last night.<br>
She didn't do anything weird there, I hope?<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
It's okay. Fu Shun may be mischievous, but she's not that absurd. She has a good head on her shoulders, and she's reliable when she needs to be.<br>
And she's a good sister, too. You should have more faith in her.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Fu Shun：</span><br>
Wh-whoooa... Is it just me, or were those compliments?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">An Shan：</span><br>
Phew... If you say so, Commander, that is a relief.<br>
But don't you get carried away, Fu Shun!<br>
You take your job seriously until the end of the day and fulfill all of your secretary duties! Understood?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Fu Shun：</span><br>
Y-Yes, An Shan!<br>
<br>
After An Shan's visit, Fu Shun works diligently throughout the day. Before I realize it, our work day is over.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
You can go home now, Fu Shun.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Fu Shun：</span><br>
Whuh? It's already dark out? Closing time, closing time!<br>
By the way, Commander, do you have plans? I want to take you to a cool place!<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Is this another mystery of the port?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Fu Shun：</span><br>
Hm? Are you interested in the great mysteries of the port too?<br>
Anyway, that's not it this time! Actually... Well, you'll know when we get there!<br>
<br>
I follow Fu Shun to an unfamiliar place.<br>
There are piles of things as far as the eye can see. Some of them are rusty and faded, but they still emit a soft luster.<br>
I can tell that everything here is well cared for.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Fu Shun：</span><br>
Tadaaa! It's my secret base! Awesome, isn't it?<br>
I didn't just bring you here on a whim, though... And I'm not plotting anything, either!<br>
After a whole lot of thought, I decided to share my secret with you!<br>
I mean, you and I already share one secret after yesterday and today, right?<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Hm? Do you mean Chang—<br>
<br>
Before I can speak Chang Chun's name, Fu Shun puts a finger on my lips.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Fu Shun：</span><br>
Shh! Secrets are secrets because we can't blab about them.<br>
Only you and I know about this secret base!<br>
You can come any time you want and store your treasures here! I'll protect them for you!<br>
When we go on adventures again, we'll hold strategy meetings here! Hehe, just the thought of it is exciting!<br>
<br>
Fu Shun excitedly runs around her little secret base before coming back to me again.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Fu Shun：</span><br>
Secrets only you know, secrets I can only share with you... Heheh, you're like a member of my family now♪<br>
<br>
It feels as if she's added me to her collection of treasures.<br>
