Cinnamon Roll on a Rainy Day<br>
<br>
1 Sweet as Sugar<br>
Early morning - Outside the office<br>
I was nearing my office, and that's when I saw a familiar figure right by the door.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Helena：</span><br>
Good morning, Commander. I'll, um, be your secretary starting today.<br>
I thought I should wait for you before stepping inside, so... Here I am.<br>
<br>
Right, today was the day Helena would start as my secretary. I then noticed she'd brought a big stack of notes with her.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Helena：</span><br>
Okay, first thing's first – sorting paperwork.<br>
<br>
Helena placed her stack of notes on the table and started flicking through them.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Helena：</span><br>
Paperwork, paperwork... Ah, here it is.<br>
<br>
She withdrew a sheet with gorgeous handwriting and adorned with a colorful stamp, to boot.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Helena：</span><br>
...Hm? Are you wondering what my notes are for?<br>
They're a list of secretary tips I compiled by asking girls around port.<br>
I figured their advice would help me perform my job better, so yeah...<br>
<br>
Talk about playing it extremely safe... To be fair, she has always been like that.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Helena：</span><br>
Ah, crap, I haven't made you a drink yet. Do you want tea or coffee?<br>
<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项1："I'll have some tea. The usual strength."</span>'''''<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Helena：</span><br>
The usual strength... Got it. I'll be back in a minute.<br>
<br>
She anxiously skimmed her notes until she found the page she was looking for, then left the office.<br>
Helena came back a while later with a kitchen scale in hand.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Helena：</span><br>
This? It's so I can make exact measurements.<br>
Based on the size of your teapot, it'll take about five grams of tea leaves for the right strength...<br>
...It's done. Here you go, Commander.<br>
<br>
I had a sip, and... it was just my cup of tea. Literally, I suppose.<br>
However, seeing how meticulous she was made me worry if she cooked like this too. I prayed she wouldn't turn the kitchen into a science lab.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Helena：</span><br>
I'm done sorting your papers now. Have a look.<br>
<br>
She was already performing impeccably as a secretary. Then, all of a sudden, someone came knocking on the door.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">St. Louis：</span><br>
Hey, Commander. We're just here to drop off yesterday's after-action report.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Honolulu：</span><br>
Ugh. Couldn't you have carried these papers yourself, Louis?<br>
<br>
It was St. Louis and Honolulu. What a coincidence.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">St. Louis：</span><br>
What's up, Helena? Starting to get the hang of this yet?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Helena：</span><br>
L-Louis? Um, hi.<br>
Sorry, I just remembered I have to go return this scale. I have to go...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">St. Louis：</span><br>
Goodness, she left in a hurry.<br>
Anyhow – she's a great help around the office, isn't she, Commander? My little Helena is a diligent girl.<br>
<br>
"She definitely is. Though 'diligent' doesn't quite do it justice. More like 'fastidious'..."<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">St. Louis：</span><br>
I get what you mean. She's a bit like rock candy, you know?<br>
<br>
"Rock candy? In what way?"<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">St. Louis：</span><br>
Sweet, but sticky, I suppose.<br>
Well, seeing as we're done here, it's time we get going. Keep at it, Commander~<br>
<br>
The analogy didn't really hit home, though I had a feeling it would make sense in due time.<br>

Cinnamon Roll on a Rainy Day<br>
<br>
2 A Storm is Coming<br>
Later that evening, a drizzle descended upon the port.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Helena：</span><br>
It's starting to rain, Commander. Should we call it a day now, before it gets worse?<br>
<br>
"There's still work left to do. I can't leave before it's all done."<br>
"You can go home early if you want to, though. You've already finished your job."<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Helena：</span><br>
I could, but... I'd hate to leave without you...<br>
<br>
"And I'd feel bad if I let you down. I'll try to finish up quick, then."<br>
While I was chipping away at my work, the rain had whipped up into a complete downpour.<br>
Gales rattled the windows while thunder boomed in the distance. What began as an evening shower had grown into a storm.<br>
"Now I remember... Yesterday's forecast warned there could be a big storm coming."<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Helena：</span><br>
A storm? Oh god...<br>
<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项1："Seems I got tunnel vision over my work. Sorry."</span>'''''<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Helena：</span><br>
Don't be sorry, it's fine. We can just wait for it to pass.<br>
<br>
Thunder rumbled outside, and my stomach growled almost as if it were echoing it.<br>
"Hmm... I think it's time for dinner. I've got instant noodles and snacks in my drawer..."<br>
<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项1："Do you want some?"</span>'''''<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Helena：</span><br>
Oh. Yes, please.<br>
<br>
Helena and I both reached for the instant noodles, and our hands made contact.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Helena：</span><br>
Err... I-I'd like to do the preparation. It's what a secretary should do...<br>
Okay, first I set the timer to three minutes, and then...<br>
<br>
She again flipped through her notes while seemingly reciting a recipe.<br>
It seemed like she'd written down tips for every plausible occasion...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Helena：</span><br>
Dinner is served. Bon appetit, Commander.<br>
<br>
"Wow, this is really good!"<br>
"Seriously, this is great. Where'd you learn to cook like this?"<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Helena：</span><br>
Well, it's actually a recipe I got from a Sakura Empire friend of mine. Dried plums and potato chips have surprising culinary utility.<br>
<br>
The fact she even knew what snacks I keep around the office shows just how far she went to gather intel to prepare for the job.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Helena：</span><br>
If you'd like, I could ask around for more recipes to add to my–<br>
<br>
BRRZT...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Helena：</span><br>
*gasp*! Wh-what was that?<br>
<br>
A shockingly loud thunderbolt struck, and the lights in the office all went out.<br>

<br>
3 A Light in the Darkness<br>
Port - Office<br>
Helena and I relied on the backup lights to find our way to the breaker room.<br>
A scorched smell lingered in the air when we got to the power station. Whatever broke here, fixing it wouldn't be quite so easy.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Helena：</span><br>
Commander, I think we have a small generator over in the depot.<br>
If we can get it online, we should be good on power... for a while, at least.<br>
Let's head there together, shall we?<br>
<br>
This building's confusing layout was only made worse by our inability to see anything in the dark. Getting lost seemed an inevitability...<br>
"Is it this way? No, that leads to the archives... What about that way? Wait, that's not right either..."<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Helena：</span><br>
The depot is this way. Or at least, I'm pretty sure it is...<br>
<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项1："Do your notes include a blueprint of this place, or...?"</span>'''''<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Helena：</span><br>
Oh, not exactly. It's just that I've been here once before, so I know roughly where to go.<br>
If I remember right, we just have to turn right here, then left, then left again, and then...<br>
<br>
I let Helena lead the way, and after just a short while, we'd made it to the depot.<br>
Did she really memorize such a complex layout after just one prior visit? That was amazing, if so.<br>
"Well, we're here. Now the question is, how are we going to find a needle in a haystack? The generator could be anywhere."<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Helena：</span><br>
I'm fairly sure it should be over in... aisle twelve, first shelf.<br>
Ah, there it is! Thank goodness my memory didn't betray me.<br>
<br>
She even remembered its exact location. I was stunned.<br>
<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项1："You've got a memory like an elephant."</span>'''''<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Helena：</span><br>
Please, that's not true. I just had a gut feeling it would be here.<br>
Also, uh... We're going to need some fuel for the generator.<br>
<br>
Even in near pitch-black darkness, I could tell my compliment made Helena smile.<br>
We found some fuel and got the generator started. The office lights lit once more.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Helena：</span><br>
That takes care of that. Now we should probably–<br>
Eek! Oh god! Did I do something wrong?<br>
<br>
"No, it's fine. I doubt that flickering was because of you."<br>
"The generator's probably just gotten weaker over the years. Let's turn off all the non-essentials and use my desk lamp for light."<br>
The office was bathed in the faint glow of a lone light bulb atop my desk. Helena and I found a cozy spot to sit down and rest for a bit.<br>

<br>
4 Warming Words<br>
Thanks to Helena's efforts, I finally managed to wrap up my work for the day.<br>
"Well... The storm doesn't seem to be dying down. Why don't we talk about stuff to kill some time?"<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Helena：</span><br>
Talk about... what stuff?<br>
<br>
"I guess for starters... What's your favorite thing?"<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Helena：</span><br>
Hard to say... Maybe my SG radar?<br>
<br>
"Your radar, huh. I had a hunch... What about something more general?"<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Helena：</span><br>
Hmm... Nice clothes, I suppose?<br>
<br>
I made a mental note to buy some nice clothes later to thank her for her outstanding performance today.<br>
"I see. What about... something you consider a shortcoming of yours?"<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Helena：</span><br>
A shortcoming? Well...<br>
<br>
She gazed into the floor and went quiet for a short while.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Helena：</span><br>
Um... I dislike going into battle...<br>
Because every time I see my friends get hurt, it feels like my heart is coming apart at the seams...<br>
I really wish I was stronger so I could do something to prevent that, not just watch powerlessly while it happens...<br>
<br>
A somber look formed on her face, and she fell silent again.<br>
In retrospect, I should've asked a different question instead...<br>
Dropping the topic, I got up and poured a cup of tea for each of us.<br>
<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项1：Quietly give it to Helena</span>'''''<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项2："Sorry for asking about such a touchy subject."</span>'''''<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Helena：</span><br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项1）</span>'''''For me? Th-thanks for the tea.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Helena：</span><br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项2）</span>'''''...Thanks, Commander.<br>
<br>
Cup of tea held in her hands, she gazed through the office window, brooding for a considerable time.<br>
Eventually, after gathering up enough courage, she turned around and threw me a decided look.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Helena：</span><br>
What about you, Commander? What's one of your shortcomings?<br>
And what do you do to try to make up for it?<br>
Knowing you, you must have some good advice for fixing your own flaws.<br>
...Why are you shaking your head? Are you saying I don't need to fixate on that?<br>
<br>
"Yeah. You'll be just fine if you work on it at your own pace."<br>
"I should've said it sooner, but you've been a lifesaver today. You deserve a huge thank-you for that."<br>
"So thank you, Helena, for going above and beyond."<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Helena：</span><br>
Y-you really think so?<br>
I'm... I'm delighted to hear those words from you.<br>
<br>
Her expression lightened up a bit.<br>

5 Shattered Glass<br>
CRAAACK!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Helena：</span><br>
*gasp*! What was that?!<br>
<br>
A gale sent an object crashing through the window, letting the fierce storm winds blow through the office.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Helena：</span><br>
Commander, are you okay?!<br>
<br>
"I'm all right. I can't say the same for the documents, though..."<br>
"Or the rest of the office, for that matter. That gust left a mess in its wake."<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Helena：</span><br>
It really did. We should do something about that broken window.<br>
<br>
First thing's first – the documents. She took a heavy book and placed it atop the stack of papers so they wouldn't be blown away.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Helena：</span><br>
That should do for now. There should be a folded-up cardboard box behind the bookshelf – can you get it?<br>
<br>
Indeed, there was one. I fished it out and brought it over.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Helena：</span><br>
Great. Just put it over the window and I'll fasten it with some duct tape...<br>
There. Now let's get the wet papers off the floor. Hopefully they'll still be legible after they've dried.<br>
<br>
After covering up the broken window, we picked up the documents spread around the office.<br>
The wind howled outside, buckling the cardboard in an attempt to break through.<br>
"It's not going to hold for long. The winds are too strong."<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Helena：</span><br>
Then we'd better move these documents someplace safe, quick!<br>
Eek!<br>
<br>
Her foot slipped in the dark, but luckily I caught her before she fell over.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Helena：</span><br>
Th-thanks. That was close... The floor's wet, so watch your step. Wait here – I'll fetch some mops.<br>
<br>
It struck me just how proactively she took care of one problem after the next.<br>
She likely didn't notice it herself – but I definitely did.<br>

6 Sweet Respite<br>
After carrying the documents to a safer place, Helena and I mopped the floor.<br>
We were both tired after dealing with so much in such a short timespan, so we lay down on the couch to rest for a bit.<br>
KRRCH-BOOOM!<br>
The thunder kept on booming. I suspected the storm wouldn't let up until the morning.<br>
All of a sudden, Helena grabbed my hand and held it with a trembling grip.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Helena：</span><br>
S-sorry. I just need a little something to help me relax...<br>
I can let go, if this is making you uncomfortable...<br>
<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项1："Not at all. I'm here for you."</span>'''''<br>
<br>
The shaking in her hand calmed down little by little, giving way to a comforting warmth.<br>
The warmth was soothing to my heart.<br>
The office became like a cozy lighthouse in the eye of a turbulent storm.<br>
Fatigue had finally caught up to me after such a long day. My heavy eyelids were closing on me... That's when Helena's head brushed against my shoulder.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Helena：</span><br>
Zzzzz...<br>
<br>
I don't blame her for dozing off on me. Her first day on the job had been incredibly hectic.<br>
It wouldn't be long before someone came to check on us. I decided to get some shuteye...<br>

7 The Calm After the Storm<br>
Port - The next day<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">???：</span><br>
*sigh*...<br>
Come on, sleepyheads, that's enough. Wake up.<br>
<br>
Opening my eyes, the first thing I saw was... Helena's thighs. It seemed I'd asked for a lap pillow at some point before dozing off again.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Honolulu：</span><br>
Ahem. What the hell are you two doing?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Helena：</span><br>
Huh...? Honolulu? Louis? Why are you here?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">St. Louis：</span><br>
To check on you. You never came back to the dorm last night.<br>
We figured it was because of the storm, so we waited for the rain to let up first.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Honolulu：</span><br>
Care to walk me through what happened? Please don't tell me any funny business went down.<br>
<br>
Uhh, sure. It started late in the evening...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Honolulu：</span><br>
...Hmm, all right. I'll take your word for it.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Helena：</span><br>
Now that the sun's up... Geesh, the storm made a worse mess of the office than I thought.<br>
We need to order a new windowpane, replace fried wires, tidy up the place... There's a lot to do to better prepare for the next storm.<br>
Commander, should I go ask Akashi if she can provide new electronics?<br>
<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项1："Go ahead. I'm sure you can work something out."</span>'''''<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Helena：</span><br>
All right. I'll see you in a bit.<br>
<br>
With a blush on her face, Helena made her swift exit.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Honolulu：</span><br>
Something's fishy here... I'm going to have to press her for the real answer about what went down last night.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">St. Louis：</span><br>
How about we say they had a sweet moment and leave it at that, hm? Heehee~<br>
Commander, be a dear and keep looking after Helena for me.<br>
