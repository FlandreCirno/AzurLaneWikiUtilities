1 Dance Beneath the Moonlight<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Huan Ch'ang：</span><br>
And thus, heaven's will be done... No, not good enough. It needs more impact...<br>
Perhaps the one about the light from fireflies above rotten grass... Ugh, no, that still isn't enough...<br>
I've got it! First, I'll don this mask...<br>
How can the light from fireflies above rotten grass ever compare to the brilliance of the moon above?<br>
<br>
I'm taking a casual stroll before the Lunar New Year banquet, and it seems I've caught Huan Ch'ang unaware.<br>
She's busy with something, so I should...<br>
<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项1：(Leave her to her business.)</span>'''''<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项2：(Sneak away.)</span>'''''<br>
<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项1）</span>'''''Wouldn't want to disturb her. I'd better leave.<br>
<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项2）</span>'''''She's in the middle of something. Let's not interrupt.<br>
<br>
With a hollow crack, a fallen branch snaps under my foot.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Huan Ch'ang：</span><br>
Who's there?!<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
(Maybe if I hold my breath, she won't notice me...)<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Huan Ch'ang：</span><br>
C-Commander?! When did you get here?<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
(Guess not...)<br>
<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项1：I, uh, just got here.</span>'''''<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项2：I didn't see anything, I swear!</span>'''''<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Huan Ch'ang：</span><br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项1）</span>'''''S-so you saw that...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Huan Ch'ang：</span><br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项2）</span>'''''That's not what I asked!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Huan Ch'ang：</span><br>
Oh, god...<br>
<br>
Her face immediately turns bright red, like the paper lanterns decorating the streets.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Huan Ch'ang：</span><br>
D-don't say a word of this to anyone!<br>
If this gets out, I'm going to... I'll... Look, just please don't tell anyone!<br>
<br>
I swear on my honor that I won't tell a living soul, and only then does calm finally return to her expression.<br>
Likewise, the color of her face also goes back to normal. Even so, I can tell something still bothers her.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Huan Ch'ang：</span><br>
...What's on my mind?<br>
Oh. Well, it's just that I feel like my appearance isn't sufficiently stately.<br>
I've changed into a new outfit, as you see, and I need a new mask and mannerisms to go with it.<br>
As a senior shipgirl, I need to project an aura of strength to those outside my family. It helps me protect others.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
I hear you. I can help you with that.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Huan Ch'ang：</span><br>
Really? Thanks, I appreciate it.<br>
How's this?<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
A bit too austere, maybe... Plus, those glowing red eyes feel like they belong on a horror movie monster.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Huan Ch'ang：</span><br>
Then how about this black one?<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Not bad, but I think one that matched the color of your outfit would be better.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Huan Ch'ang：</span><br>
The pink one might be... Actually, no! Th-this is a sleep mask I brought by mistake. I'm not wearing that.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Dang. The pink would've looked cute on you...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Huan Ch'ang：</span><br>
This white one is adorned with flowers. I like it quite a lot, but what do you think?<br>
Then there's this one with antlers. It strikes a good balance between cute and mysterious, I'd say.<br>
Also... This manjuu mask...<br>
It's not the least bit stately... but it is cute.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
......<br>
<br>
After considerable deliberation and doubt, Huan Ch'ang finally settled on a few masks that would look good on her.<br>
She further practiced her deportment as well. She most definitely projects a stately aura now.<br>

2 Ascendant Dragon's Spring Feast<br>
It is the eve of the New Year's banquet, and a lone girl is sitting down, looking anxious.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Lung Wu：</span><br>
Mumble, mumble... Grumble...<br>
Dang it all! I'm so worried!<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Oh...<br>
<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项1：Are you okay?</span>'''''<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项2：Are you all done in the kitchen?</span>'''''<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Lung Wu：</span><br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项1）</span>'''''No, I'm not okay!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Lung Wu：</span><br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项2）</span>'''''That's the thing! I couldn't even get in!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Lung Wu：</span><br>
Earlier this morning, everyone chased me out of the kitchen and forbade me from entering. They said they were preparing a surprise for me...<br>
But... Aaaggghhh! I'm worried out of my mind!<br>
There's all these dishes to cook, and I don't know if Ning Hai and Ping Hai can do it!<br>
What if something goes wrong and they mess it up?<br>
There's also the fact that we all have different tastes and seasoning preferences, so in the worst case scenario...<br>
<br>
Lung Wu's face turns more and more pale as she imagines everything that could possibly go wrong.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Lung Wu：</span><br>
No! I need to go check on them!<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
(Hang on... Lung Wu must be exhausted after all the preparatory work she's done the past few days.)<br>
(I also remember Chen Hai asking me to not let her into the kitchen. "She has to rest," she said.)<br>
(That being the case...)<br>
<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项1：(Look around.)</span>'''''<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
(There are appetizers plated up on the table. Drunken crab, baozis, and more...)<br>
(I don't know who thinks of baozis as appetizers, but as a thing to distract Lung Wu with, they'll do the trick!)<br>
You know what they say – "Don't be scared of freshly baked potatoes." Obviously, these aren't potatoes, but why don't you try one anyway?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Lung Wu：</span><br>
Huh? Potatoes? What on Earth are you talking about?<br>
I don't get what baozis have to do with anything... but if you say so, I'll try one...<br>
Om, nom... Mmm!<br>
The texture of this dough! The seasoning in the bean paste! I... I hate to admit it, but Ping and Ning sure cook a good baozi!<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Oh yeah? Now try the drunken crab.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Lung Wu：</span><br>
Om, nom... Mmm!<br>
It's sweet and juicy... Did they use the Shaoxing wine I took out of the cellar? This has just the perfect amount of soy sauce, too!<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
(If a delicacy like drunken crab can't help her forget her worries, then not much will.)<br>
(Hm? Come to think of it, someone told me to never, ever let Lung Wu into the kitchen when she's drunk...)<br>
(Chen Hai was so insistent about it that I can't remember everything she said...)<br>
(It's fine. The banquet is almost ready, so there won't be any reason for Lung Wu to go into the kitchen before long.)<br>
<br>
I end up so distracted by the delicious drunken crab that... when I come to, I realize that Lung Wu has disappeared.<br>
<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项1：(Go find her NOW!)</span>'''''<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项2：(Don't worry about it.)</span>'''''<br>
<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项1）</span>'''''When I get up to search, Lung Wu is already on her way back to the table.<br>
<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项2）</span>'''''They're already serving the food, so even if she went to the kitchen, there's surely nothing left for her to flub.<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项2）</span>'''''While I rationalize my mistake, Lung Wu is already on her way back to the table.<br>
<br>
Before long, the final dish of the banquet – spring rolls – is served.<br>
That marks the completion of my mission to keep Lung Wu in check.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Lung Wu：</span><br>
Commander, spring rolls are a must during the New Year's festivities! Give this one a try.<br>
<br>
When I put it in my mouth, chew, and taste the spring roll... spiciness beyond words assaults my senses!<br>
<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项1：Wh-what is this?!</span>'''''<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项2：Water... I need water!</span>'''''<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项3：Delicious! Seconds, please!</span>'''''<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Lung Wu：</span><br>
Heh heh heh... Spicy, huh? That's the good stuff!<br>
Those are my special recipe – flaming hot spring rolls! I snuck into the kitchen to make them!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Hu Pen：</span><br>
Flaming hot?!<br>
Ack! Eating all that drunken crab turned her into a drunken Lung Wu...<br>
Come on, Commander! When she's drunk, she can't cook anything but spicy food!<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
How could this be...<br>
My perfect strategy, defeated at the hands of drunken crab!<br>

3 Prancing Tiger Welcomes the Spring<br>
I walk down the festive street under the light of lanterns and fireworks.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Hu Pen：</span><br>
Grooar! Grooooar!<br>
<br>
With a roar, a very odd creature jumps out from the shadows and locks her arm around mine.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Hu Pen：</span><br>
Groar groooar! Grooooar!<br>
<br>
The shipgirl – no, tiger – blocking my path continues to roar, shaking her huge "head" gleefully from side to side.<br>
Or... No. That is clearly a lion's head. Is this one of those ligers I've heard about?<br>
<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项1：(Take a step left.)</span>'''''<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项2：(Take a step right.)</span>'''''<br>
<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项1）</span>'''''The liger takes a step left as well.<br>
<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项2）</span>'''''The liger takes a step right as well.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Hu Pen：</span><br>
Grooar, groaroar!<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
(The lion head is just blinking back at me...)<br>
<br>
(Guess I'll have to find another way...)<br>
<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项1：(Try taking the lion head off of her.)</span>'''''<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项2：(Jump over her.)</span>'''''<br>
<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项1）</span>'''''The liger swiftly jumps back and evades my ambush.<br>
<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项2）</span>'''''As a Commander, if I can just command my legs to jump high enough... Yeah, that's not happening.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Hu Pen：</span><br>
Hahahaha~ Yaaay, my prank worked perfectly!<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
(Hm? I know that voice...)<br>
Hu Pen? I didn't realize.<br>
<br>
Within the beast's gaping maw, I see Hu Pen grinning proudly.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Hu Pen：</span><br>
Heheheh, did I getcha?<br>
Lung Wu and I are practicing our lion dance! We're on break right now, though...<br>
I saw you walking from far away, so I decided to play a little prank on you!<br>
See? My lion dance is awesome, right?<br>
<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项1：It sure is!</span>'''''<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项2：I'm not sure lions roar like that...</span>'''''<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Hu Pen：</span><br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项1）</span>'''''It better be! I gave 2,000% percent of my effort to learn it!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Hu Pen：</span><br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项2）</span>'''''Y-yeah, well... It's cuter the way I do it!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Hu Pen：</span><br>
Why did we decide to do the lion dance?<br>
Heheh, because lions are auspicious beasts that can ward off disaster.<br>
...Dragons and tigers are, too? Heheh, you sure know your stuff!<br>
Yep! Lung Wu and I are doing the lion dance, so our tiger and dragon elements will blend in and make it the perfect good-luck dance for everyone!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Lung Wu：</span><br>
Hu Pen! Quit slacking off and come back to practice!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Hu Pen：</span><br>
Oh, comiiing!<br>
<br>
Hu Pen dons her lion head once again.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Hu Pen：</span><br>
Bye, Commander! Hope you're excited to see our lion dance!<br>
<br>
With that, the lion-tiger hybrid scampers energetically back to Lung Wu.<br>
(Seems like our New Year's festival has an exciting new program coming up.)<br>
