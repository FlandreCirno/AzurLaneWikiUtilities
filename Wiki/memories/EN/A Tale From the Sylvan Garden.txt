By a stroke of serendipity, I find myself stepping into a quiet place.<br>
The verdant bamboo forest sways gently as the wind passes through, echoing the melodies of nature.<br>
In the middle of that beautiful scenery that seemed like something right out of a painting, my eyes are drawn to a graceful figure in the corner of the garden.<br>
That person's name is Chen Hai. She seems to be doing some needlework with a gentle expression on her face, and when she notices me, she slightly lifts her head.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Chen Hai：</span><br>
Oh, good day, Commander.<br>
I didn't expect to run into you here... Heehee. Could it be, that you came looking for me?<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
I, uh, just happened to be wandering around in the park... I never knew there was such a serene place here...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Chen Hai：</span><br>
Perfectly serene, like a piece of heaven on earth, right?<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Mmhmm.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Chen Hai：</span><br>
Haha. I'm glad we're of one mind, Commander.<br>
I'm also quite fond of this place. It puts my heart at ease, and helps me organize my thoughts–<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Organize your thoughts...? I'd normally expect to see you sitting in front of a Go board, but you seem to be...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Chen Hai：</span><br>
Embroidering? Yes, but that is not solely an exercise in femininity.<br>
Each move in a game of Go represents the player's thoughts and planning, while also ascertaining if there is resolution in their heart.<br>
The same can be said for embroidery – each movement of the needle must weave through the gaps in the opus's frame, and one would do well to plan each move.<br>
If Go emphasizes the big picture, then embroidery calls for rigorous attention to detail. In both cases, however, concentration, perseverance, and dedication are required.<br>
These two things seem as different as night and day, but they actually have quite a lot in common, right?<br>

'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项1：It's not a connection I ever would've made...</span>'''''<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项2：Impressive as always, Chen Hai.</span>'''''<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项3：Actually, can you tell me what you're working on?</span>'''''<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Chen Hai：</span><br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项1）</span>'''''Heehee. At the end of the day, they're just some hobbies of mine.<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项1）</span>'''''Though, if you're interested in learning embroidery, I don't mind showing you the ropes...<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项1）</span>'''''Of course, if you simply wanted to have a little chat with me... I wouldn't mind that either.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项2）</span>'''''Your range of interests is simply remarkable. I didn't expect you to be so well-versed both in strategy and in crafts.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Chen Hai：</span><br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项2）</span>'''''Well-versed? I wouldn't go that far. I've only picked it up recently, and am still learning.<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项2）</span>'''''There's much I'd like to learn from you too still, so you're always welcome to come here and keep me company.<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项2）</span>'''''Of course, that offer extends far beyond topics such as Go and embroidery. Heehee~<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Chen Hai：</span><br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项3）</span>'''''Oh, you're curious about my little piece of embroidery here?<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项3）</span>'''''It might be a bit too soon to tell you, but...<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项3）</span>'''''Hmm, let me think about the best way to convey this...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Chen Hai：</span><br>
Since I'm sure you're interested in this piece in my hands right now...<br>
I suppose you could call it a present I was making for you, Commander.<br>
In the pursuit of more intricate designs and patterns, I've employed a special technique known as "Three-Azures Embroidery".<br>
The style is clean and elegant, and uses soft tones... The very same technique can be seen on the clothes that I am wearing now.<br>
Every stitch is careful and deliberate, filled with my intent to convey my feelings towards you.<br>
Once I am done with this piece of work, I do hope that you will find it to your liking.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Of course. I'm really looking forward to it.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Chen Hai：</span><br>
I'm glad to hear that... But right now, since we're already here together...<br>
<br>
Chen Hai suddenly sets down her handiwork on the stone table, and picks up the instrument lying right now to her.<br>
Her long, slender fingers dance across the strings, the notes spreading forth like a gentle breeze across a placid lake.<br>
Her music is graceful and melodious, yet still imbued with her unique poise and calmness. Slowly, gradually, it fills up this quiet world.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Chen Hai：</span><br>
If you don't mind, why not stay here a bit longer?<br>
There's plenty I'd still like to share with you... Whether it's my experiences learning embroidery, or my knowledge of Go.<br>
Though, if you'd like to take a nap, I'll also be more than glad to keep you company, continuing to work on my embroidery until you wake up again.<br>
Whatever the case, I hope we can continue to cherish our wonderful time together.<br>
<br>
The girl's sweet giggles flow into my ears along with her music.<br>
