<br>
Troublesome Kids Come From The Port<br>
Academy Port<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Köln：</span><br>
*Sigh*... What should we do...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Königsberg：</span><br>
*Sigh*... What should we do...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Köln：</span><br>
I guess every school has some students like them...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Königsberg：</span><br>
Looks like I'll need to "discipline" them. With my whip, that is...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Köln：</span><br>
Um, Köning... I think a whipping might be too much.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Königsberg：</span><br>
Tsk. Oh well...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Köln：</span><br>
But still... *Sigh*... What exactly should we do about them...<br>
We can't just let them do as they please.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Z23：</span><br>
I just so happened to overhear your concerns, Köln and Königsberg!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Königsberg&Köln：</span><br>
Zed? When did you get here?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Z23：</span><br>
No matter! Please allow me to deal with your problematic students!<br>
I'll give them a lengthy lecture on how important and fun it is to study!<br>

<br>
Social Reject And Proud Of It<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Long Island：</span><br>
First you do the thingy here... Then the next thingy!<br>
Crap! I'm gonna die!<br>
Oh nooo! Game over... I guess I gotta practice more if I want to beat this on the hardest difficulty.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Z23：</span><br>
Oh dear... How on earth can you live in a room as cluttered as this...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Long Island：</span><br>
Hello? Hang on, I remember you... You're Z23, from Iron blood, right?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Z23：</span><br>
Correct! Now listen, Long Island: as a member of the fleet, it is both a privilege and your duty to actually study!<br>
Come with me! Leave your shut-in life behind and we shall study together!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Long Island：</span><br>
S-stop being a shut-in?! Fat chance!<br>
Setting sail already takes so much effort, and now you want me to use my precious time off on studies? Heck no!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Z23：</span><br>
Um... Did I forget to tell you that studying can be relaxing...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Long Island：</span><br>
You can't trick me as the commander did! Try to convince me all you want, but I'm not going anywhere!<br>
My pride as a social reject depends on it!<br>

Class Z III<br>
<br>
Who's There?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Z23：</span><br>
I wasn't able to make Long Island leave her room... *Sigh*...<br>
Now's not the time to fret, me! ...Let's see, next in line is...<br>
San Diego!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">San Diego：</span><br>
Heyaaa! I'm right here~!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Z23：</span><br>
I was looking for you! Perhaps you already know why I'm here?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">San Diego：</span><br>
Hmm... To play a game with us, right?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Z23：</span><br>
No, I'm here to tutor you! Your grades have been bad and it's making the teachers worry! If you won't study hard then you won't be of any use to the commander.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">San Diego：</span><br>
Tutoring, huh... Okay! I'm super duper smart so studying will be a walk in the park for me~!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Z23：</span><br>
It's good to see that you're motivated! (That went well... Looks like I managed to convince San Diego to study...)<br>
So, how about starting with math...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">San Diego：</span><br>
Maff? Sure... Easy peasy! Probably!<br>
<br>
A Few Minutes Later<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Z23：</span><br>
W-what happened here...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">San Diego：</span><br>
Aha, ahaha... I'm seeing so many big, pretty stars... One, two... Where am I? Who am I?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Z23：</span><br>
A-are you okay, San Diego?! Please, come to your senses! How could you get knocked out from such a simple task?!<br>

<br>
Class Z IV<br>
<br>
Taboo Double Trouble!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Z23：</span><br>
Ughhh... This time, I definitely have to succeed...<br>
Let me see... Next up... is Miss Saratoga.<br>
"She loves playing pranks, so watch out", is it? All right then.<br>
<br>
Several minutes later, outside the counselor's office<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Z23：</span><br>
Okay, Miss Saratoga is waiting for me inside. I'm ready to head in-<br>
Eh? The door's partially open... and a blackboard eraser is wedged in the door panel?<br>
Really likes pranks, eh? Isn't this way too old school? I almost want to get hit by that thing just as a tribute...<br>
However! My objective today is to set these problem children straight!<br>
I have to teach Miss Saratoga that the classroom is a sacred site of learning, not a place to play pranks!<br>
I just have to carefully avoid this eraser while opening the door...<br>
<br>
(Boom!)<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Z23：</span><br>
Uwah!!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Saratoga：</span><br>
The classic door trap is just a decoy! The real trap is the highly precise carrier-based eraser-bomber! This is Saratoga's specialty, the Taboo Double Trouble! Hehe, scared ya, didn't I?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Z23：</span><br>
Miss... Sa... ra...!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">？？？：</span><br>
My, oh my...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Saratoga：</span><br>
Th-this voice... can it be? Saratoga out! *Jets out of the classroom in a puff of dust*<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Lexington：</span><br>
Haah... that Sara, causing trouble for others again. Z23, are you okay?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Z23：</span><br>
Miss Lexington...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Lexington：</span><br>
This time, I really will have to properly "educate" that sister of mine. I am truly sorry. After I find her, I will make sure she apologizes.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Z23：</span><br>
Ugh... I wasn't able to do any tutoring yet again...<br>

<br>
Class Z V<br>
<br>
The Melancholy of Z23<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Z23：</span><br>
Uuugh... why won't things ever work out?<br>
Maybe... I'm just a powerless student after all...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Illustrious：</span><br>
Oh my... it seems that I've come across a child who needs some illustrious guidance~<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Z23：</span><br>
I-Illustrious? Uwaahh...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Illustrious：</span><br>
There, there... let me help get this burden off your chest~<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Z23：</span><br>
So... the situation is like this...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Illustrious：</span><br>
So that's what's going on. Ahh, all the kids are so energetic~<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Z23：</span><br>
Ener... getic...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Illustrious：</span><br>
How could there be any bad children in this naval base? If you try to put yourself in their shoes more and become a part of their lives, who is to say that the problems won't resolve themselves?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Z23：</span><br>
Become a part of their lives...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Illustrious：</span><br>
Zed, do you truly wish to help them from the bottom of your heart? If that is the case, surely you will be able to find common ground with them.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Z23：</span><br>
I... I understand now. One more... I'll give it one more try!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Illustrious：</span><br>
Ahh... good girl~ I'll be cheering you on~<br>

Class Z VI<br>
<br>
Let's Dash! <br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Z23：</span><br>
To become a part of their life... Okay! First up is...<br>
Long Island! Let's have a challenge!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Long Island：</span><br>
Eh?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Z23：</span><br>
Using games!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Long Island：</span><br>
Ehhh? Hehe... hehehe... you dare face the God of Gaming, the Vizier of Vidya, Long Island? You sure have guts. I'll accept your challenge!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Z23：</span><br>
If I win, you'll have to accept your tutoring obediently!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Long Island：</span><br>
You ought to save it 'til after you win~<br>
I... I lost...?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Z23：</span><br>
Heheh, a promise is a promise~<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Long Island：</span><br>
I never thought I'd make such an elementary error... to let my opponent select the game... what the heck is Sudoku...<br>
Guh... I know, I know... I'll go to tutoring!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">San Diego：</span><br>
What is it~ Something fun~?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Z23：</span><br>
Mhm. I was in too much of a rush before. If it's San Diego, I have to start with something more basic.<br>
Miss Sara will be there as well.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">San Diego：</span><br>
Yahoo~ I'll be able to play with Sara again~<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Saratoga：</span><br>
I'm sorry, Z23, I just wanted to joke around with you a bit...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Z23：</span><br>
Don't worry about it... However, that "Taboo Double Trouble" of yours... Miss Sara sure has some flair.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Saratoga：</span><br>
Heh heh, pranks never go out of style precisely because they're fun!<br>
Um.... (looks both ways nervously) Big Sis isn't here, right... She'd give me another earful if she heard that...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Z23：</span><br>
Hey, look at it this way. Would you rather play pranks that leave you feeling guilty, or would you rather do something glorious and fun that won't get you "disciplined?"<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Saratoga：</span><br>
Eh? Is there really something that nice?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Z23：</span><br>
For example, we could conduct an experiment using carrier aircraft to make artificial rain, or make rainbows... or something along those lines?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Saratoga：</span><br>
That does sound interesting~<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Z23：</span><br>
These are all examples of how fun studying can be, so make sure to come to tutoring!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Saratoga：</span><br>
Eh... I somehow still feel like my leg is getting pulled... f-fine!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Z23：</span><br>
All right! This time, I'll definitely be able to succeed!<br>
Everyone, get ready~ after-school special tutoring is about to begin!<br>

Class Z VII<br>
<br>
Teach Me, Miss Z23! <br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Laffey：</span><br>
I heard Zed was here...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Javelin：</span><br>
What's "special tutoring?" Sounds like something that would be fun with the Commander~<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ayanami：</span><br>
Ayanami... also wants to be Z23's student...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Z23：</span><br>
Y-you've come to tease me, haven't you?!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Laffey&Javelin&{namecode:6}：</span><br>
"Teach me, Miss Z23!!"<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Z23：</span><br>
All right, all right. There's no point being shy now...<br>
This is important! (knocks on the blackboard) If you don't take notes carefully, Miss Z23 is going to punish you!<br>
