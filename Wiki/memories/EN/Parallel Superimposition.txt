<br>
The static, ringing sound swirling chaotically in my head gradually orders itself.<br>
When I open my eyes again–<br>
I find myself surrounded by tall buildings and busy traffic.<br>
Clusters of high-rises dot the skyline, blurry-faced passers-by surge back and forth around me.<br>
Before my astonishment fades, my thoughts begin to orient themselves.<br>
Where am I? I have to get my bearings straight first.<br>
Yes, there was an emergency in the Sea of Stars... I should've been in the process of evacuating with Helena.<br>
But... What happened? Why am I here?<br>
Where's Helena? No, of course she wouldn't be here right now.<br>
...I can't make any sense of how I got here. My head feels fuzzy.<br>
It feels like I'm forgetting something but can't quite put my finger on it, as if I had just woken from a dream.<br>
I look around, and my memories seem to overlap with the strange sights flooding my eyes. Everything seems so alien, yet also intensely familiar.<br>
It feels as if I know this place, but how? There are tall buildings all around me, yet my eyes refuse to focus on their blurry names.<br>
Flickering holograms and countless lights fill the air, blurring the line between day and night.<br>
It almost seems like a lifelike fantasy taken right from the set of a science fiction movie.<br>
But, everything around me seems to run with such regularity, a hyper-realism that borders on uncanny.<br>
For a moment, I am convinced that I've been transported into the future.<br>
...But, that's not possible, is it?<br>
Things start to fall into place bit by bit. The nebulous, blurred-out faces of the people around me. The impossible-to-read signs on the buildings. These were the same products of the Reality Lens' replication function.<br>
If so, is everything around me somehow related to the abnormality that occurred in the Sea of Stars before the emergency evacuation?<br>
And most importantly – what am I supposed to do here?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Communicator?：</span><br>
Ring ring~♪<br>
<br>
A buzzing is coming from the pocket of my clothes, accompanied by the sound of something resembling a ringtone.<br>
I fumble around inside my pocket, and my fingers brush against a slender, rectangular object.<br>
Is this... a cellphone?<br>
I don't remember bringing my phone with me into the Reality Lens...<br>
Rather, I don't even recognize the clothes I'm wearing.<br>
It seems to be... a lab coat worn by researchers.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Communicator?：</span><br>
Ring ring~♪<br>
<br>
I fumble around to pull the strange phone out of my pocket. The ringing has already stopped, but a prompt lingers on the screen, asking me if I want to hear the message.<br>
<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项1：Slide your finger towards the green button.</span>'''''<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项2：Slide your finger towards the red button.</span>'''''<br>
<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项1）</span>'''''I start to play back the message, and hear a familiar voice coming from the other side.<br>
<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项2）</span>'''''...A voice inside me is telling me that nothing will begin unless I take this first step.<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项2）</span>'''''It seems to be compelling me to listen to this message.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Memphis：</span><br>
Hello, Professor. This is Memphis.<br>
I've been trying to reach you for the last few days, but haven't been able to get through. I figure you're still busy on your trip, so I'll just leave this message here for you.<br>
So, at the time of this message, Dr. Anzeel and Yorktown have just arrived safely.<br>
She originally planned to pick you up and take you to the university herself, but...<br>
But, uh... Her flight got delayed.<br>
In any case, she was a bit short on time as a result, so she had to head there first to get ready for the presentation.<br>
But don't worry, Northampton will be there to pick you up instead.<br>
Anyways, I'll see you soon at the usual place.<br>
<br>
The message comes to an end, and the screen goes dark.<br>
The device somewhat resembles the smartphones I'm used to but is even more lightweight and elegant in design. I slide it back into my pocket.<br>
But... why did Memphis call me "Professor?"<br>
I had used the Reality Lens to merge my consciousness with Anchorage's hull, which resulted in an amalgamation of our imagery, memories, and data.<br>
If that's the case, whose consciousness is this? Who exactly is Dr. Anzeel, and what is this university?<br>
And why did I receive a message from Memphis when I was not actively focusing my thoughts on her?<br>
...Maybe some of my questions will be answered when I meet with Northampton.<br>
Come to think of it... what's "the usual place?"<br>
As I walk down the street, some unmistakable landmarks come into view.<br>
That would explain the sense of deja vu I felt earlier. This place was clearly based upon NY City.<br>
Had the buildings around me not been covered with holographic displays, I probably would've made the connection much sooner.<br>
The question still remains: is this actually a scene from the future, or merely the figment of someone's imagination?<br>
The closest thing I've ever seen to something like this was the City of Light inside the Arcana Sanctum... But who would be able to reproduce something like that with such fidelity– ...Hmm?<br>
While I was lost in my thoughts, a car had just pulled up to me.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Northampton II：</span><br>
Hey there. You wandered off to a pretty interesting place. The fact that I even found you means we really are two peas in a pod, huh?<br>
Sorry 'bout that. Did I keep you waiting?<br>
<br>
Though her attire is a lot more modern-looking, the girl in front of me still appears to be the same Northampton I know.<br>
First Memphis, now Northampton; both appearing inside the simulation without my conscious input.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Northampton II：</span><br>
What's the matter? Got an upset stomach or something?<br>
<br>
Northampton gets out of the car and approaches me. She seems worried that I didn't respond to her greeting.<br>
...Until I have a better grasp of the situation, I don't want to draw too much attention to myself. So, I should try to act natural–<br>
<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项1："I'm fine. Just a little tired, that's all."</span>'''''<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Northampton II：</span><br>
Ahaha... Don't blame you. Coming all the way over here must've been a pretty long drive, huh?<br>
Just hang in there a bit longer, alright? We still need to head over to the university and meet up with Dr. Anzeel.<br>
<br>
"Is Dr. Anzeel... over there right now?"<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Northampton II：</span><br>
Yup, that's what Memphis said. Apparently, her flight was delayed so she went straight over to prepare for the presentation.<br>
Though, by the time we get there, the presentation will probably already be over.<br>
<br>
"Alright. Let's get going then."<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Northampton II：</span><br>
Sounds good. Hop on in, I'll take you there.<br>
<br>
"This is the captain. I'm addressing every man aboard this ship"<br>
"In the last few hours, many things have happened."<br>
"I believe what we have stumbled across is not man-made, but a phenomenon of nature."<br>
"One that can't be explained."<br>
"This storm has some effect on time as far as we know."<br>
"It created a portal, a door into another era."<br>
"We're about to fight a battle that was lost..."<br>
"Before most of you were born."<br>
"But this time, with our efforts, it's going to be different."<br>
"The established past will be rewritten."<br>
"––May God watch over us."<br>

<br>
The scenery outside the window passes by like a scroll being unfurled.<br>
There is nothing foreign to me about this scenery, except that I have never seen any of this futuristic landscape before.<br>
It is vast, continuous, and exceedingly realistic. It has a clarity about it not seen in dreams, and an exacting fidelity not seen in simulations.<br>
Is the Reality Lens a lot more sophisticated than I gave it credit for, or had I actually leapt through time?<br>
My thoughts continue to race, but the car comes to a stop at the parking lot outside some university.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Northampton II：</span><br>
Here we are, Professor.<br>
<br>
"This is where we'll meet Dr. Anzeel?"<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Northampton II：</span><br>
Not quite. There's a no-car zone up ahead, so we'll have to walk the rest of the way.<br>
<br>
I get out of the car and look around. It seems that these institutions of higher learning don't change much – rugged and functional as ever.<br>
However, the advanced technology seen throughout the campus already speaks volumes about this place's prestige.<br>
<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项1："Where are all the people?"</span>'''''<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Northampton II：</span><br>
Hah, good question. That was the first thing out of Dr. Anzeel's mouth too.<br>
Maybe people just don't feel like leaving home on a weekend. The latest model of virtual entertainment devices just came out too, you know?<br>
On the other hand, that means parking's easier to find, and I absolutely consider that a dub.<br>
Oh, Dr. Anzeel just sent me a message. She says her presentation is over and she's waiting by the entrance on the first floor.<br>
Let's get a move on. It's easy to get lost here, so stick close to me.<br>
<br>
I enter the building, and see a group of people waiting at the entrance outside the lecture hall.<br>
Most of them are shipgirls, and like Northampton, I recognize their faces but not their outfits.<br>
But, the woman standing in front of them...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">???：</span><br>
Heya! Good to see you again, my assistant!<br>
<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项1："Who are you...?"</span>'''''<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项2："Dr. Anzeel?"</span>'''''<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Anzeel：</span><br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项1）</span>'''''Haha, funny joke. What, is it uncool to say "long time no see" nowadays?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Anzeel：</span><br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项2）</span>'''''...Who else would it be? Jeez, did you hit your head on the way here or something?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Anzeel：</span><br>
Anyway, sorry about ditching you, but my flight got delayed and that ended up screwing with my schedule. Totally out of my control, okay?<br>
But look at you, all stony-faced like the other faculty members. You're gonna make me feel bad here!<br>
Seriously, I would've tried a bit harder to accommodate you, but the circumstances really didn't allow for it!<br>
What, are you giving me the silent treatment now? It's not like I was the one piloting the plane.<br>
<br>
As she continues to wallow dramatically in feigned helplessness, the shipgirls are trying to stifle their bemusement.<br>
...She does not seem to be providing the entire picture.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Hornet II：</span><br>
Suuure, but like, aren't you the one who chartered the flight?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Langley II：</span><br>
Woah, you just went and spilled the beans...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Anzeel：</span><br>
Hey! I thought we all agreed to keep it a secret from my assistant here?!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Hornet II：</span><br>
Wouldn't stay secret for long when you're taking the plane home as well, y'know.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Anzeel：</span><br>
Right. I didn't think of that...<br>
<br>
...So it was solely her own fault that she was late.<br>
<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项1："Honestly, it's no big deal."</span>'''''<br>
<br>
"Unexpected things can happen even with chartered flights. Besides, I made it here just fine, didn't I?"<br>
If anything, the extra time worked in my favor, allowing me to make some sense of my surroundings and my situation.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Anzeel：</span><br>
See, I knew you'd understand! You know what they say – life is full of surprises, and all that!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Hornet II：</span><br>
I didn't expect you to take her side, Professor. But if you're fine with it~<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Langley II：</span><br>
You shouldn't enable her like that. Her time management skills will only become worse and worse if you don't call her out.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Anzeel：</span><br>
The Professor just said it's no big deal. You know what happens to those who criticize the Creator, Langley?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Langley II：</span><br>
Owch! Owww! Please stop pinching my cheeks!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Anzeel：</span><br>
*sigh*... I'd even planned a sweet speech for our long-awaited reunion, but that ship has already sailed.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Hornet II：</span><br>
Gee, I wonder whose fault that is.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Anzeel：</span><br>
Whose, indeed...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Hornet II：</span><br>
It's the pilot's, obviously! If only they hadn't been late!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Anzeel：</span><br>
Exactly! There's no point lingering on it, so let's move on.<br>
Hammann, you've been hiding this whole time. Come on, say hello to my assistant!<br>
You've met her before, haven't you?<br>
<br>
(Of course... I've known Hammann for ages.)<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Hammann II：</span><br>
I-I haven't been hiding at all! H-h-hello, Assistant...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Langley II：</span><br>
The Professor is Dr. Anzeel's assistant, Hammann, not yours. How do you refer to all your other teachers?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Hammann II：</span><br>
T-Teacher? Really?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Hornet II：</span><br>
We should call you "Teacher" too, then. You teach, and you assist the doctor, too.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Langley II：</span><br>
I beg to differ! There's a world of difference between the Professor's work and mine.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Yorktown II：</span><br>
Ahem. It's been a while, Professor. How goes your research?<br>
<br>
...Yorktown.<br>
Memories begin to well up uncontrollably in my mind, like tears about to overflow.<br>
I still remember the last time I visited her in the ICU, how she lay in bed beside those beige curtains, mustering a faint smile.<br>
Countless emotions flow through me. I'm so glad to see her like this, even in a simulated world.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Yorktown II：</span><br>
Professor? Is something the matter?<br>
<br>
I don't want to alarm her. I'm just a bit tired from the journey after all, in more ways than one.<br>
<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项1："I'm fine. It's good to see you again, Yorktown."</span>'''''<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Yorktown II：</span><br>
Yes, it's been a while. I've missed you.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Anzeel：</span><br>
Okay, that's enough pleasantries. Let's get down to business.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Yorktown II：</span><br>
Oh. The two of you have a meeting with General Garfield, right?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Anzeel：</span><br>
That's important business. I was talking about another kind of business.<br>
Namely, sightseeing. I've delayed our meeting with the general until tomorrow, so my schedule is totally free until then!<br>
And since the gang is all here, I say we go paint the town red!<br>
We can go wherever and do whatever. We're the masters of our own destinies! For today, anyway.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Hornet II：</span><br>
Aw hell yeah! Way to go, Doc!<br>
Although I think some sort of plan would be good to have. Where are we going, exactly?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Anzeel：</span><br>
Let me think... Oh, hey, it's almost lunchtime! I know a good café Aoste told me about years ago.<br>
I dunno if they're still around, but if they are, we'll grab something to eat!<br>
After that, we could do some window shopping, then go to the movie theater.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Langley II：</span><br>
So the plan is to wing it as usual? Fantastic... Oh well, it's at least worth it to check out the café.<br>
Could you tell me the name of it? I'll look them up and see if they're still open.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Anzeel：</span><br>
Sure. It's called "Granate."<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Langley II：</span><br>
Spelled like pomegranate, right? I think I see it.<br>
<br>
Suddenly, I remember something...<br>
<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项1："Where's Memphis?"</span>'''''<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Anzeel：</span><br>
She didn't tell you? Sheesh, she must be running on fumes.<br>
She's preparing for tomorrow's test. That's why she could only leave you a message.<br>
Poor thing. Hard at work while we're partying the night away.<br>
Good thing you reminded me about her. I'd almost forgotten to buy a gift for her.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Langley II：</span><br>
Doctor, I just checked, and the café is still in business.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Anzeel：</span><br>
Great! Then let's go!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Yorktown II：</span><br>
Hammann, remember to stay close to us. We don't want you to get lost.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Hammann II：</span><br>
Get lost? I-I would never!<br>

<br>
Anzeel leads us through the streets leisurely.<br>
Though there's hardly a soul outside, the walk does not feel lonely thanks to the outspoken and hungry researcher.<br>
She tells stories of when she attended this university, and talks about her friendship with a colleague named Aoste.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Anzeel：</span><br>
...And that's the long and short of it.<br>
He set up a script that automatically signed me up for classes, and I just barely managed to snag enough credits to graduate.<br>
I tell you, he always thought one step ahead of me. Raising a cat went exactly like he said it would, too.<br>
By the time I graduated, I never managed to teach it to do my housework.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Hornet II：</span><br>
...Wait, what was that about a cat and housework?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Anzeel：</span><br>
I just told you. Weren't you listening?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Northampton II：</span><br>
I'm preeetty sure ordinary cats can't be taught to clean and stuff.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Anzeel：</span><br>
No... I guess you're right. It didn't have an ordinary upbringing. I must've taught it wrong.<br>
It did learn to send and receive emails, though!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Langley II：</span><br>
Could you elaborate on that, please?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Anzeel：</span><br>
Sure. So, one day I got this email from Aoste that said, "Nevermind, I guess I won't pry," and as it turns out...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Yorktown II：</span><br>
Doctor, Professor, I believe the entrance to Granate is over there.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Anzeel：</span><br>
Huh? Let's see...<br>
Yeah, this is it! I'm glad it's still here.<br>
Looks like they've modernized quite a bit. Guess they've been doing well for themselves since I last visited.<br>
Anyhoo, let's talk inside. You can't come by this campus and NOT pay a visit to Granate!<br>
<br>
We head inside, and Anzeel leads us into a private room.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Anzeel：</span><br>
I'm amazed they still accept my old membership card! Now this is why shops that've been around for a while are the best~<br>
<br>
The cafe's interior is a quaint mix of traditional and modern, harmonizing perfectly to create a cozy atmosphere.<br>
This private room in particular toes a fine line between austere and luxurious, providing a unique, art-like aesthetic.<br>
Having that said...<br>
<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项1："Doesn't it seem a bit too high-class?"</span>'''''<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Anzeel：</span><br>
Hmm? Well, that's exactly what it's supposed to be. Or so I think, anyway...<br>
By the way, umm... does anyone know where the menu is?<br>
<br>
Anzeel fumbles around the back of her chair, but finds nothing.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Waiter Robot：</span><br>
GOOD EVENING. DO YOU NEED SOMETHING?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Anzeel：</span><br>
Whuah?! Where'd this thing come from?!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Waiter Robot：</span><br>
WELCOME TO GRANATE. I WILL BE YOUR WAITER THIS EVENING. PLEASE HAVE A LOOK AT OUR MENU.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Northampton II：</span><br>
Well, it's dressed to look the part...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Anzeel：</span><br>
Sheesh... Modernizing the shop is one thing, but this is ridiculous.<br>
I think I've seen you guys before. Aren't you, like, the fourth generation of E-Cube-powered service bots?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Waiter Robot：</span><br>
THANK YOU FOR YOUR COMPLIMENT. YOUR PRAISE MOTIVATES US TO CONTINUE IMPROVING OUR SERVICE.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Anzeel：</span><br>
That wasn't a compliment in any... Meh, whatever.<br>
At least they've kept their uniforms the same.<br>
To hold on to tradition, or to embrace modernity... Looks like the owner has thought about both.<br>
Man... Coming here again sure brings back some fond memories.<br>
So I'll have the usual for old times' sake. Seafood paella and a cappuccino, please.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Waiter Robot：</span><br>
COMING RIGHT UP. WOULD YOU LIKE ANYTHING ELSE?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Hornet II：</span><br>
Huh, looks like paella is the house specialty.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Yorktown II：</span><br>
Isn't that... a pretty hearty meal? This being a café, I expected smaller items on the menu.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Anzeel：</span><br>
See, that's what's unique about this place. They do, of course, offer a more conventional menu as well.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Hammann II：</span><br>
What a weird café...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Anzeel：</span><br>
Call it weird if you want, but I would argue that their paella is the secret reason this café has stuck around so long.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Langley II：</span><br>
Now I can see why you used to be a regular here, Doctor...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Anzeel：</span><br>
Hang on, are you saying I've got weird tastes?<br>
Because, let me remind you, it was Aoste who introduced this place to me!<br>
Trust me, he didn't seem like the type of guy to frequent fancy-schmancy places like this.<br>
But it only took one visit, and I was hooked.<br>
In any case, order whatever you want. Everything on their menu is good.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Hornet II：</span><br>
Alrighty then, I like the sound of that! Then, hook me up with a Hawaiian pizza and some large fries!<br>
What do you want, Hammann? A hamburger combo?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Hammann II：</span><br>
Do you think I'm a baby? No! I'll have these!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Langley II：</span><br>
A slice of Black Forest gateau and a cup of black coffee?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Hammann II：</span><br>
You heard me right! Hmph!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Langley II：</span><br>
Maybe I'll have the hamburger combo, then.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Northampton II：</span><br>
I think... I'll try the chorizo-cheese paella.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Yorktown II：</span><br>
Me, I'll have some loaded pub fries, and a cup of herbal tea.<br>
What are you going to order, Professor?<br>
<br>
"I think I'll have the seafood paella as well."<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Anzeel：</span><br>
Good taste, my assistant! That should be our final order.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Waiter Robot：</span><br>
THAT'S TWO SEAFOOD PAELLAS, ONE CHORIZO-CHEESE PAELLA, ONE HAWAIIAN PIZZA, ONE HAMBURGER COMBO...<br>
ONE LARGE FRIES, ONE LOADED PUB FRIES, ONE BLACK FOREST GATEAU, ONE HERBAL TEA, ONE BLACK COFFEE, AND ONE CAPPUCCINO.<br>
IS THAT CORRECT?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Anzeel：</span><br>
Yep, that'll be all!<br>

<br>
We are waiting for our orders. Hammann seems to have found a strange ice cream machine with a variety of zany flavors, which has attracted the attention of the others.<br>
Everyone except Anzeel, that is, who remains in place as if deep in contemplation.<br>
Has she noticed my strange behavior?<br>
<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项1："You're not going to take a look at the ice cream machine?"</span>'''''<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Dr. Anzeel：</span><br>
Did you know that it didn't always use to be a self-serve? You used to have to wait for people to bring out your ice cream.<br>
But, that's one thing I don't miss about this place. Those flavors aren't something you come back for.<br>
Like, pepperoni and jalapeno. Who came up with that anyway?<br>
<br>
"I don't know about you, but that sounds like it could work."<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Dr. Anzeel：</span><br>
Are you serious? It's your funeral.<br>
At any rate, only kids would get fired up over an ice cream machine. Do I look like a kid to you?<br>
...Or, should I ask, how does the current "you" perceive me?<br>
<br>
Sure enough, she has noticed.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Dr. Anzeel：</span><br>
You've been acting odd this whole time. Something about you just doesn't sit right with me.<br>
Maybe you're just having a bad day. Maybe I'M just having a bad day. Or maybe...<br>
You've been replaced by aliens.<br>
<br>
"Aliens? Calling that far-fetched would be an understatement."<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Dr. Anzeel：</span><br>
It's a non-zero possibility, so it could theoretically happen. Heck, it'd take an alien to enjoy pepperoni and jalapeno ice cream.<br>
So... Let's have a little pop quiz just to see if you're an alien imposter or not~<br>
<br>
"...Are you serious, or are you just messing with me?"<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Dr. Anzeel：</span><br>
Do I look like I'm messing with you? C'mon, just take a seat right over there~!<br>
<br>
I don't have much of a choice.<br>
All of a sudden, I feel the hairs on my back standing on end, as if an electric current just ran down my spine.<br>
The words coming out of my mouth seem to bypass my brain.<br>
It's as if I subconsciously have always been used to these kinds of interactions with Anzeel.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Dr. Anzeel：</span><br>
First question. Who am I?<br>
<br>
"You're Dr. Anzeel. You discovered Wisdom Cubes and pioneered their application, and now lead the Oceanic Federation's Wisdom Cube Research Team..."<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Dr. Anzeel：</span><br>
Uhh... I said I wasn't messing with you, but you also don't need to recite my whole CV...<br>
<br>
The words seem to flow right out of my mind, as if I had known this information my whole life.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Dr. Anzeel：</span><br>
Next question. What am I currently researching?<br>
<br>
"Practical applications of Wisdom Cubes, and the effect of nurture on KAN-SEN."<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Dr. Anzeel：</span><br>
What's the reason I came back to my alma mater?<br>
<br>
"To test the effect of Type II hull-fusion rigging on KAN-SEN combat capabilities."<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Dr. Anzeel：</span><br>
Right... Who's the general I talked about earlier?<br>
<br>
"The vice-admiral of the Eagle Union Navy, head of Division 13 and supervisor of Cube weaponization research."<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Dr. Anzeel：</span><br>
Finally, who is Dr. Aoste?<br>
<br>
"Your colleague at the university, a leading expert in the fields of Energy Cubes and artificial intelligence, as well as head of the 'Antiochus' project."<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Dr. Anzeel：</span><br>
Hahaha! You actually answered everything!<br>
<br>
"Am I in the clear now?"<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Dr. Anzeel：</span><br>
Hmm... Actually, I have one more question, but my gut tells me it's not a good idea to ask it right now.<br>
...Forget I said that. You're in the clear.<br>
I can safely say that you have not been abducted by aliens. We all have those rough days, huh?<br>
<br>
...How in the world did I manage to answer those questions?<br>
The Oceanic Federation, Division 13... I have seen some of those terms before, during my adventures in the Northern Parliament as well as at the Sea of Stars.<br>
But, I couldn't even guess as to how they were related, nor did I know how I tied together all those threads of information into something coherent.<br>
It left me with a bizarre feeling I couldn't quite put my finger on.<br>
Almost as if some memories locked away deep inside me had been awakened at just the right time.<br>
But how is any of this happening...?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Hornet II：</span><br>
Guess who's back with ice cream!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Yorktown II：</span><br>
We got something for each of you as well!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Northampton II：</span><br>
(She's really gonna do it?)<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Hammann II：</span><br>
(If Yorktown said it's fine, no harm to it, right?)<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Langley II：</span><br>
(Oh boy... I suppose it'll be fun to see how they react.)<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Hammann II：</span><br>
Starting with the one I chose~!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Dr. Anzeel：</span><br>
The colors on those cones... Ugh, those are nasty flavors.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Hornet II：</span><br>
Allow me to tell you your choices!<br>
The one with the yellow cone is yogurt beef flavor.<br>
And the red cone, that's pepperoni flavor!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Dr. Anzeel：</span><br>
Pepperoni? Wow, that's the Professor's favorite!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Hammann II：</span><br>
I-it is? Okay, it's yours!<br>
<br>
Anzeel forces the pepperoni-flavored ice cream on me before I have a chance to respond.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Dr. Anzeel：</span><br>
Come on, chow down! Don't let perfectly good food go to waste!<br>

<br>
[Reality Lens Replicated Space] [Location: Café Granate] [Cognitive merging data unknown]<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Dr. Anzeel：</span><br>
Phew... This paella's to die for, just like I remember it!<br>
And let me tell you, I've been all over searching for comparable stuff, but no other shop comes anywhere close!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Northampton II：</span><br>
Mmhmm. My chorizo-cheese paella was pretty awesome too.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Yorktown II：</span><br>
I didn't know that the cheese and pork in my pub fries were imported. Quite an innovative, upscale take on a classic comfort food.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Langley II：</span><br>
I just did some research, and apparently, this shop sources locally as well as imports fine foods from overseas.<br>
There's something on the menu for everyone. I'm quite impressed by how they manage to maintain such a broad menu.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Dr. Anzeel：</span><br>
That's right! You girls should try Basque cheesecake sometime! I had the real deal once when I went abroad to another research academy.<br>
Ohh, I can still taste it if I focus on that memory.<br>
...Come to think of it, you shipgirls still don't get to leave the base much, do you?<br>
Hey... Think you could pull some strings so I can bring a few friends with me on my next business trip?<br>
I could use the extra help to find souvenirs for those who stay home. There's a long list, you know.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Northampton II：</span><br>
...Are you sure you're allowed to use your private jet for that?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Dr. Anzeel：</span><br>
What's wrong with that? Bonnie does it all the time, and nobody seems to care.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Yorktown II：</span><br>
Random question, Doctor, but I just looked up the name of this café.<br>
Apparently, it comes from granatum, the pomegranate flower. Do you think that has any special significance?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Dr. Anzeel：</span><br>
I mean, the meaning of a flower changes from country to country, so it depends on who you're asking.<br>
That said, I have heard the granate symbolizes "yearning for happiness" and "a chance about to be missed."<br>
It also symbolizes abundance and the blessings of life. Put that together, and you probably have something like "a hearty meal not to be missed out on."<br>
It's been around for a long while, and their food is the best for miles around.<br>
Then again, I can't remember the last time I ate at any other café or restaurant in this area...<br>
...Hang on, I'm getting a call.<br>
Sorry, this one's work-related. I'll be right back.<br>
<br>
Anzeel takes out her phone and walks out of the room, her light-hearted mood instantly vanishing beneath a serious, focused demeanor.<br>
But, nobody else seems to think much of it. It mustn't be that serious then...<br>
With Anzeel out of the room, I feel everyone's gaze turn onto me.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Hornet II：</span><br>
Hey, do you all remember the Professor's lectures on the history of modern warfare?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Yorktown II：</span><br>
Of course. Because they were so clear and easy-to-digest, I have a solid grasp of just about every page in the textbook.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Northampton II：</span><br>
The tactical classes really clicked with me.<br>
I might not be the sharpest tool in the shed, but I still use the Professor's lessons to adapt to the changing battlefield.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Langley II：</span><br>
Don't let it get to your head, Professor. I'm an educator just like you now, and the path of learning never ends!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Hammann II：</span><br>
Huh? Who is teaching the Professor then?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Yorktown II：</span><br>
Dr. Anzeel, of course. The Professor isn't just our teacher, but also Dr. Anzeel's assistant as well.<br>
I bet you've been involved in all sorts of confidential projects lately, haven't you?<br>
<br>
My skin begins to tingle again when I hear those words, but unlike when I was interrogated by Anzeel, no words appear in my mind.<br>
With nothing to work with, I can only handwave the question.<br>
<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项1：(Nod)</span>'''''<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Yorktown II：</span><br>
I see... Sorry, I shouldn't be asking about confidential information in the first place.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Dr. Anzeel：</span><br>
I'm back. Sorry that took so long.<br>
<br>
"Let me guess. Big news?"<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Dr. Anzeel：</span><br>
Yup. Change of plans – General Garfield is going on an urgent mission tonight, so our meeting has to happen now.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Hornet II：</span><br>
Now? But we're not done eating yet...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Dr. Anzeel：</span><br>
I know, but there's nothing I can do. It's an emergency situation.<br>
Must be pretty serious too, because he sounded like he was in a pretty bad mood.<br>
Professor, I was originally planning on bringing you along. But I don't think I should put you in front of the general's fury while you're still... "not fully awake."<br>
I'll deal with him myself. In return, keep these girls busy, will you?<br>
Oh, and take my credit card. Take them on a shopping trip and go watch a movie or something.<br>
I'll go take care of the bill first. Enjoy your day off, girls~!<br>
{{折叠面板|内容结束}}

<br>
We leave the café, and head for the shopping district around the campus.<br>
Before I know it, we'd already crossed over from the campus into the bustling downtown area.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Yorktown II：</span><br>
The doctor is quite the busy bee, isn't she?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Northampton II：</span><br>
Always has been. She comes and goes at the drop of a hat.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Langley II：</span><br>
Thankfully, we have the Professor here, or our day off would've been cut short.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Hornet II：</span><br>
Haha, it's much more than a day off now. It's a group date with the Professor now!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Northampton II：</span><br>
Let's not call it that. Professor, is there any place you wanna visit?<br>
<br>
Northampton passes me a device that projects a blow-up version of the surrounding area, casually navigating it with swipes of her finger.<br>
If this world was a simulation and we could go anywhere within it, the scale and fidelity of the area around me alone would instantly exhaust the Sea of Stars' computational capacity.<br>
Therefore, somebody else's data must have been incorporated into this replication. But whose? I want to explore every nook and cranny of this world.<br>
That isn't possible before the time Anzeel comes back, but I at least have an idea of where I want to start.<br>
<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项1："Let's check out the downtown area."</span>'''''<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Hornet II：</span><br>
Sounds good to me!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Langley II：</span><br>
While we're at it, we can buy some souvenirs for our friends.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Hornet II：</span><br>
Hell yeah. Let's buy a literal boatload of stuff with Anzeel's money.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Langley II：</span><br>
I'm going to veto that. The doctor's going to have our heads if we max out her credit card.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Hornet II：</span><br>
Don't worry. I know just the perfect way to plan out a great date on a budget.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Langley II：</span><br>
I know what you're thinking. You may NOT use your aircraft to get a better view.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Hornet II：</span><br>
C'mon! I might've thought about it, but I wasn't gonna do it for real.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Hammann II：</span><br>
What are we going to do downtown?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Northampton II：</span><br>
Don't worry, I'll handle this. Drones are legal, even if your planes aren't.<br>
<br>
Northampton suddenly takes out a small white drone from her bag, and it ascends into the air.<br>
It's more sleek and elegant than anything I've seen before, a faint blue light pulsing from its center.<br>
<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项1："Whoa."</span>'''''<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Northampton II：</span><br>
Pretty cool, right? It's one of the newest models.<br>
The doctor let me borrow it. Said it ought to give us a better view of the city.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Hornet II：</span><br>
Lemme have a look... Dayum! That is a stunning view.<br>
There's a neat souvenir place just down that way. Whaddya say we go there first?<br>
<br>
After a period of walking, we enter the souvenir shop.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Northampton II：</span><br>
Wow, they have a lot of stuff you don't see every day.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Hornet II：</span><br>
Yeah, like this! The collector's edition of A Fistful of Molars! I've been dying to get my hands on this ever since...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Hammann II：</span><br>
These cat-ear headphones are pretty cute.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Langley II：</span><br>
It sounds like everyone's having a whale of a time.<br>
What do you have there, Yorktown? A shopping list?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Yorktown II：</span><br>
Yes. We need to buy souvenirs for Enterprise, Memphis, and Dr. Anzeel.<br>
And something for the Professor, of course.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Hornet II：</span><br>
*gasp*... I think I just overheard something juicy!<br>
Yorktown's gonna buy something for the Professor, eh? Hehe...<br>
Hey, come over here for a sec!<br>
So, anything you've been wanting to get your hands on lately? Asking for a friend.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Yorktown II：</span><br>
Hornet! *sigh*... It was meant to be a surprise!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Hornet II：</span><br>
Whew, what a haul! So, where are we heading next?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Hammann II：</span><br>
I wanna look around the pet store!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Yorktown II：</span><br>
Let's do that. We can't spend too much money after all.<br>
<br>
As we walk to the pet store, we see a movie advertisement playing from a giant screen on the side of a tall building.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Bon Homme Richard Movie Ad：</span><br>
Hey, everyone! It's me, Bon Homme Richard. The Final Countdown is in theaters now!<br>
I had a lot of fun in the starring role. Be sure to check it out!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Deep-Voiced Narrator：</span><br>
Welcome to the paradox of time, where past and present become one and history is actually changed! The Final Countdown... now in a theater near you.<br>
Buy a ticket today and you have the chance to win a three-day guided tour of...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Hornet II：</span><br>
Did you see that? That was Bonnie up there!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Northampton II：</span><br>
She's really featuring in a movie?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Hornet II：</span><br>
Apparently! I asked her what she's been up to the other day, and she said she's involved in a top-secret project...<br>
Guess this is what that was.<br>
I wish I was a cultural ambassador like her. She's got it easy.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Yorktown II：</span><br>
It's harder than it looks. Having the eyes of the world on you comes with a lot of pressure.<br>
Imagine having to choose your every word carefully. I really don't think any of us are cut out for that.<br>
And while we're enjoying ourselves as tourists, she's probably rehearsing for her next public appearance.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Hornet II：</span><br>
You got a point. I didn't think about that.<br>
Whaddya say we buy her a souvenir too, while we're here?<br>
Wait, first, let's take a group selfie! Northampton, you do the honor with your drone.<br>
Make sure you get all of us, Bonnie included, in the frame.<br>
Y'know, she'd probably be livid if she learned we went on a date with the Professor without her...<br>
But if her face is in the picture, you can at least say she was there in spirit, right?<br>
How does that sound, Professor? Over here, you can stand in the middle. Hammann, Langley, scoot over a bit. Yorktown, you can stand right beside the Professor.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Northampton II：</span><br>
And I'll be riiight here. Everyone ready? Say "cheese" on three. One, two...<br>
Yup, looks good.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Hornet II：</span><br>
Thanks! Send it to me. I wanna show it to Bonnie right away.<br>
Oh, I just got an idea. Why don't we go watch that movie she's in? She did tell us to check it out.<br>
I know you wanna. Especially you, Professor.<br>
<br>
That name, Bon Homme Richard... It's come up before, in some files from the Northern Parliament and the Royal Navy. None of it seemed good, but I'm very curious to learn more.<br>
"Sounds like a plan. Let's do it."<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Hornet II：</span><br>
Sweet. Yorktown, go ahead book some tickets for us.<br>

<br>
Two hours later...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Hornet II：</span><br>
I can't believe they really got Bonnie to play the captain. The movie was surprisingly gripping, too.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Langley II：</span><br>
I read that the troops, warships, and locations featured were also real. Apparently, the movie was produced in collaboration with the Oceanic Federation.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Northampton II：</span><br>
Even the mass-produced ships were real. I recognize 'em from a previous naval exercise. They must've pulled them in for filming right after.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Hammann II：</span><br>
The ending was a bit of a letdown though. Just as it seemed like something major was about to happen, they just got pulled back to their original timeline...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Langley II：</span><br>
I suppose that's just the nature of the genre. Time travel is one of the hardest things to pull off convincingly in literature, with time paradoxes and all that stuff.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Hornet II：</span><br>
Wasn't the whole premise of the movie going back in time to prevent disaster? The screenwriters should've done a better job if you ask me!<br>
Well, at least Bonnie got some awesome lines. "We're about to fight a battle that was lost before most of you were born."<br>
I'll bet you, if Enterprise were in that same situation, she'd have been all like, "the enemy's in range. Strike first and wipe them out."<br>
If you ask me, the folks in the movie were way too hesitant to do anything that might've influenced the past.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Langley II：</span><br>
It's an understandable concern, as you could inadvertently erase yourself from ever having existed.<br>
As for me, I'd be happy enough to just sit on the sidelines and watch history unfold. That alone is a golden opportunity we don't get in real life.<br>
In any case, the stakes are way too high, and there are some decisions you can't make on impulse.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Hornet II：</span><br>
Hrmmm... Fair enough. How about you, Yorktown? What'd you think about the movie?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Yorktown II：</span><br>
I've been thinking about it since the ending, and I'm still not sure.<br>
Changing the past means changing everything that happens after it.<br>
The past shaped us into who we are today. Changing it would change us as well.<br>
That's not even mentioning the fact that the future we know may not exist anymore when we return to it.<br>
And much like the butterfly effect, our actions may not result in the outcome we wanted.<br>
Doing what feels like the right thing at the moment may lead to greater problems down the line.<br>
Of course, changing the past could create a better future, or a worse one, as could doing nothing.<br>
All that is to say... I don't know what I'd do.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Hornet II：</span><br>
"I don't know" means someone else has to decide. People's lives would be at stake.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Yorktown II：</span><br>
I know. I suppose I'd do what the captain did and take it step by step.<br>
If you can't predict the future even when you can influence its course, the best thing to do is minimize the potential repercussions.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Hornet II：</span><br>
You know... That answer fits you, actually.<br>
In the end, that decision isn't even for us to make. Professor, if you had a chance to go back in time, what would you choose to change?<br>
<br>
Hornet's right. I am the one whose decisions so often influence the fate of my friends and companions.<br>
"If I could have it my way, I'd rather create a better future than rewrite history."<br>
"But, supposing I traveled back in time, like in the movie..."<br>

<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Hornet II：</span><br>

<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项2）</span>'''''"However much pain the past caused us, the present we live in is built on it."<br>

<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Langley II：</span><br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项2）</span>'''''A rational judgment, Professor. If you can't predict the future, leaving the past unchanged is the right decision.<br>
<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项3）</span>'''''"When you really think about it, going back in time in and of itself causes the past to branch off."<br>

'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项3）</span>'''''"That being the case, you can't fall prey to overanalysis. You have to clear your mind, focus on what's right in front of you, and solve problems one at a time."<br>

Yorktown! There's a toy store over there with some really adorable stuffed animals!<br>
You still haven't bought souvenirs for everyone, right? Let's go check it out!<br>

Oh, thanks, Hammann. What do you say, Professor?<br>

That evening, at the university...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Hornet II：</span><br>
Aww, maaan. It's dark already.<br>
Time flies like a fighter jet when you're having fun, I guess.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Northampton II：</span><br>
True. Dr. Anzeel should be back any minute now.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Langley II：</span><br>
We DID have a lot of fun and bought all the gifts we wanted to. I'd say we made excellent use of our time.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Northampton II：</span><br>
Yeah, I'm just worried about being addicted to shopping now.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Hornet II：</span><br>
Don't think I didn't see you stowing it all away inside your rigging.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Northampton II：</span><br>
Hey, it's not a crime if you don't fully deploy it.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Hornet II：</span><br>
That's not the problem, it's that your bags aren't in your hands! You can't call it shopping if you're not flaunting your loot.<br>
I mean, just look at the rest of us! We're walking around like queens!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Langley II：</span><br>
Yes, and you stand out more than you would with your rigging deployed...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Hornet II：</span><br>
Won't hear me complaining. It's all part of the experience, baby!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Yorktown II：</span><br>
Oh dear, which bag did I put the food in...?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Hammann II：</span><br>
I'll help with your bags!<br>
There... Hey, Yorktown, do you want some donut holes? Say "ahh!"<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Hornet II：</span><br>
Not fair! I wanna feed her too!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Yorktown II：</span><br>
Hornet, for goodness' sake... We're not kids anymore.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Hornet II：</span><br>
No, but the Professor's totally raring to do it as well!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Dr. Anzeel：</span><br>
*sigh*... Woe is me, the lady with too much to carry and nobody who'll help.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Hornet II：</span><br>
I got you, lemme just... Wait, when'd you get here, Dr. Anzeel?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Dr. Anzeel：</span><br>
Like, a minute ago? The same as you all.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Memphis：</span><br>
I'm here, too, finally free from the layer of hell that is my job.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Dr. Anzeel：</span><br>
What did you girls get? Please tell me you bought food. Memphis and I are starving!<br>
Hammann, Hornet, don't you try to hide anything. Bags and hands where I can see 'em!<br>
Whew... I'm stuffed like a turkey. That was delish.<br>
<br>
"I take it your meeting with the general went well."<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Dr. Anzeel：</span><br>
Eh, as good as it could've gone. Turns out he was stressed out because of pressure from his superiors, not anything I did.<br>
When you're someone of his rank, the problems of everyday people stop fazing you. But having that said, the impact of said problems always has a way of trickling down to us.<br>
That pressure on him forced me to make drastic changes to my plans.<br>
Particularly those surrounding the Type II rigging test scheduled for tomorrow.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Memphis：</span><br>
There's also the naval exercise. The Reality Le– I mean, the reality of the situation is that we'll need you to assist.<br>
<br>
"Wait, what?"<br>
<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项1："Were you about to say 'Reality Lens'?"</span>'''''<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Memphis：</span><br>
Uhh... What I meant was, you'll be playing the role of the commander for the red team in tomorrow's rigging test<br>
I will play the role of your opponent, leading a fleet of Federation mass-produced ships.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Hornet II：</span><br>
Yo, rewind! What naval exercise? Nobody said anything about that!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Yorktown II：</span><br>
Indeed. That wasn't exactly part of the plans we received.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Dr. Anzeel：</span><br>
That's putting it mildly. It totally came out of left field.<br>
They turned what was supposed to be a simple benchmark test and target practice into a full-blown naval exercise, completely unannounced.<br>
Whoever green-lit the decision also deliberately omitted a combat script, saying that the exercise's scope depends on actual combat performance.<br>
In other words, we don't know a damn thing. Nothing about what enemies we're going to be up against, what equipment they're going to have, what "unexpected situations" we'll need to prepare for, nada.<br>
Apparently, they're also installing equipment to simulate certain combat environments, and we can expect state-of-the-art weaponry to be in play.<br>
Given the scale of the exercise, expect it to be unlike anything you've ever seen before.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Northampton II：</span><br>
Mm... I get the feeling that there are gonna be a lot of unknown variables and unpleasant surprises thrown in.<br>
I wonder why they're in such a hurry to push out all this new equipment that hasn't even been listed on the registries yet. It must be a really big deal to them.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Langley II：</span><br>
The cutting-edge Type-II hull-fusion rigging hasn't been perfected yet, but it's apparently able to draw out a lot more power than before even in an unfinished state.<br>
Therefore, it makes sense to want to get a benchmark of our new power as soon as possible so they have some ballpark numbers they can reference.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Hornet II：</span><br>
Now that's music to my ears. It's been a while since I've gotten to flex my muscles.<br>
Plus, I really want to see what I'm capable of after all that sweat, blood, tears... and new gear!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Yorktown II：</span><br>
Agreed. This is a good opportunity to challenge ourselves and test our mettle.<br>
Knowing your strength on paper is good. Knowing your strength in practice is even better.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Dr. Anzeel：</span><br>
Heh. I had a feeling you'd all be on board.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Yorktown II：</span><br>
Oh right, Doctor. Did you say something about the Professor participating in this exercise as well?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Dr. Anzeel：</span><br>
Well, naturally. Since the whole timetable got pushed up, that also necessitates some staffing changes.<br>
After all, can you name a single person more fit to be a commander than my assistant here?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Hornet II：</span><br>
I see! Thanks, Dr. Anzeel, that works out perfectly then!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Dr. Anzeel：</span><br>
Heheh. You can repay me by putting on a stunning performance, then. Who knows, maybe you'll get to participate in more projects in the future as well!<br>
If you impress the evaluators, maybe you'll get to spend more time working with the Professor here as well~<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Northampton II：</span><br>
Work hard to get more work, huh? Sounds like a bad deal, but I'm in.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Langley II：</span><br>
Agreed. I've never had a reason to doubt the Professor's knowledge or experience.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Yorktown II：</span><br>
Alright then. Since we're all on the same page, I guess we'll be calling you Commander from now on~<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Dr. Anzeel：</span><br>
Haha, I like the sound of that! Maybe I'll have to jump on the bandwagon as well~<br>
What do you say to that, my assistant?<br>
<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项1："Just couldn't resist saying it again, huh..."</span>'''''<br>
<br>
Commander. That is the title most familiar to me, after all.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Dr. Anzeel：</span><br>
"Commander" it is. We'll go through the exercise in greater detail later. For now, we've got another hour to ourselves before it's time to head to our accommodations for tonight.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Hornet II：</span><br>
Where are we staying? The university?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Dr. Anzeel：</span><br>
If only. I can pull strings and bend rules during daylight hours, but accommodations are outside my jurisdiction.<br>
Sadly, we'll be staying at a base near the exercise area.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Hornet II：</span><br>
Darn. Oh well, that doesn't sound too bad.<br>
Just with one tiny caveat. All their bedrooms are double rooms.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Hammann II：</span><br>
Wait, how do you know that?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Hornet II：</span><br>
Hehehe... I expected something like this might happen, so I did a bit of research.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Northampton II：</span><br>
Oh boy. So that means...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Langley II：</span><br>
We'll all share a room with someone else, I suppose?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Hornet II：</span><br>
Bingo. Which leads us to the inevitable question–<br>
Who gets to share a room with the Commander?<br>
I know people who'd kill for that chance! Maybe it'll be me... Or maybe it'll be you.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Hammann II：</span><br>
Wh-why are you looking at me like that?!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Hornet II：</span><br>
You don't wanna? 'Kay, we can exclude Hammann~<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Hammann II：</span><br>
Hang on! I didn't say anything I didn't want to–<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Hornet II：</span><br>
Then you've still got a chance!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Yorktown II：</span><br>
*sigh*... Hornet, please. You're making things hard for the Commander.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Hornet II：</span><br>
This is important. We have to work it out one way or another.<br>
But hey, you could be the roomie arbitrator if you have a sound proposal.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Yorktown II：</span><br>
Well... If the Commander doesn't mind, I'd–<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Dr. Anzeel：</span><br>
Seriously? I leave for five seconds, and you all start arguing about who'll sleep with who?<br>
Sorry to burst your bubble, but the Commander and I are staying in separate staff rooms in another building. We have an exercise to plan, y'know.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Hornet II：</span><br>
Laaame!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Dr. Anzeel：</span><br>
Do you have a problem with that? Would you rather take my place and spend all night planning?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Hornet II：</span><br>
You KNOW I can't do that! Fiiine. We'll discuss room sharing among ourselves.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Dr. Anzeel：</span><br>
Thought so. You have one hour before it's time to go. Decide before then.<br>
Ooh, look! Street food! I used to visit the stands here all the time, and it looks like they've only gotten better since then!<br>
Come with me, Commander. You've GOT to try some of this stuff!<br>
<br>
Anzeel drags me right back outside to the street vendors. By the looks of things, this night is only just getting started...<br>

<br>
The next day, at the exercise site...<br>
The skies are calm today over the exercise site. As I wait aboard the command vessel, Yorktown and the other shipgirls are finalizing their preparations.<br>
Though everyone's morale is initially high on the surface, that quickly takes a nosedive as I read off the information sent over by Memphis.<br>
The enemy forces consist of everything from old and new mass-produced ships, to combat drones and unmanned carrier-based aircraft.<br>
Not only that, their armaments and formations were specifically formulated to combat shipgirls.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Langley II：</span><br>
By the looks of things, our opponents are far better prepared for this than any of us could have predicted...<br>
I don't say this very often, but what the hell is going on? Their equipment is all cutting-edge stuff.<br>
They have frigates with anti-air weaponry capable of shooting down entire waves of aircraft, and corvettes providing formidable close-range defenses...<br>
That's not even mentioning their long-range anti-surface missiles that can track moving targets, their high-end radars, or their numerous jamming devices.<br>
This is not a force of comparable strength. It's more like...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Northampton II：</span><br>
They're trying to gauge how we'd do in case of an alien invasion?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Hornet II：</span><br>
I can handle being the underdog, but this is ridiculous! What do they expect from us?!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Hammann II：</span><br>
This is gonna be so one-sided... Those weapons are straight out of science fiction!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Langley II：</span><br>
One-sided is an understatement. That huge modern fleet, against three carriers, a destroyer, and a heavy cruiser.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Hornet II：</span><br>
Plus the Commander's unarmed command vessel, if you want to be generous...<br>
As if we weren't already at a huge disadvantage, they've even got Memphis in command. Talk about "lured in by the dark side"...<br>
Jeez, she could've at least told us where her forces are deployed before she swore to secrecy.<br>
Unless she never meant to make it easy for us, and was just pretending to be all friendly yesterday...<br>
That would explain why she showed up so late – she was perfecting her evil master plan!<br>
Dr. Anzeel was with her, so she must've had SOME clue of what Memphis was up to.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Yorktown II：</span><br>
I think she purposely told us nothing because she has faith in us and the Commander.<br>
Plus, Memphis hasn't gotten the Type II upgrade, so she might not be able to join our side even if she wanted to.<br>
At the end of the day, the purpose of this exercise is to test OUR abilities.<br>
Regardless of which side achieves victory, we'll demonstrate our full capabilities.<br>
It makes sense to over-tune the enemy as well, considering what we do know about the trajectory of the Revolutionary Front's E-Cube research.<br>
Everyone, just have faith in yourself, and we'll be just fine.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Hornet II：</span><br>
Confidence ain't the problem here. Fairness is.<br>
<br>
"Hornet has a point. The odds are heavily stacked against us in every meaningful metric."<br>
"However, that does not mean that we don't have options."<br>
"Let's think about frigates, first of all. They form a sturdy anti-air screen, but these mass-produced vessels must be controlled finely to achieve maximum effectiveness."<br>
"Memphis can't possibly control them all by herself, meaning there have to be command ships that relay commands as intermediaries."<br>
"Neutralize those, and the mass-produced ships will be thrown into disarray. They'll be sitting ducks."<br>
"This will create an opening for us to focus an assault on the enemy line and take out their chain of command. Speedy elimination of key targets is one of the major advantages shipgirls have over conventional warships."<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Hornet II：</span><br>
Basically, you're saying we may be outgunned, but have a huge tactical advantage?<br>
<br>
"Yes. Your individual power trumps that of any mass-produced ship. If we're able to concentrate that power, we can turn the battle in our favor."<br>
"Issuing the orders that lead us to victory – that will be my job."<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Yorktown II：</span><br>
The Commander is right. As long as we stay calm and seize whatever advantages we can get, victory isn't out of the question.<br>
Studying modern and past warfare isn't enough. We have to look ahead at how warfare might be conducted in the future as well. The Commander has much to teach us about that.<br>
<br>
"Please. I'm just speaking from experience."<br>
Experience that I've accumulated over countless battles against the Sirens, leading shipgirls just like them.<br>
<span style="color:#ec5d53;">Memphis：</span><br>
Morning. Have you all finished strategizing?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Hornet II：</span><br>
Oh, you bet. You'll see soon.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Langley II：</span><br>
Don't expect us to hold anything back with the Commander leading us.<br>
You'd be wise not to underestimate us.<br>
<span style="color:#ec5d53;">Memphis：</span><br>
Of course not. I know that the Commander is extremely capable.<br>
As for me, I'm good to go. This is no simulation, and I'm not gonna mess around.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Yorktown II：</span><br>
Huh? Did you and the Commander run some sort of simulated exercise in preparation for this?<br>
<span style="color:#ec5d53;">Memphis：</span><br>
What? No, I meant... Mental simulations. Planning for your enemy's actions, that stuff.<br>
While this is my first field exercise, I've done hundreds and hundreds of simulated ones before.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Hornet II：</span><br>
Woah, is that what you're doing all day in your room? And here I thought you were...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Hammann II：</span><br>
I'm starting to get nervous now...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Northampton II：</span><br>
Don't worry. Just keep your wits about you, and don't let the enemy get into your head.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Dr. Anzeel：</span><br>
Are we done chatting yet?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Hornet II：</span><br>
Dr. Anzeel?! Where were you this morning?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Dr. Anzeel：</span><br>
What do you think? Over at HQ, looking for a first-row seat and popcorn.<br>
Let's quickly go over the rules one last time.<br>
The red team's flagship is Yorktown, the blue team's is Memphis. First team to sink or effectively neutralize the other's flagship wins.<br>
Simple enough. Everyone got that?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Everyone：</span><br>
Understood.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Dr. Anzeel：</span><br>
Great. Then, let the Type II hull-fusion rigging test naval exercise commence!<br>
{{折叠面板|内容结束}}

{{折叠面板|标题=Fusion Armaments|选项=10|主框=1|样式=primary|展开=是}}
<br>
In the midst of the exercise...<br>
Meager as our forces are, I still split them up into three groups.<br>
I assign Northampton to Hornet, have Hammann and Yorktown pair up, and keep Langley with me by the command vessel.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Hornet II：</span><br>
Tons of enemy aircraft, incoming! Looks like they're from the carrier strike team! Memphis is finally putting her cards on the table!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Northampton II：</span><br>
Langley, give me a sitrep, ASAP!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Langley II：</span><br>
I'm working on it! Just two more seconds...<br>
Sent! The carrier strike team has several AA-focused corvettes as escorts! Be careful!<br>
I'm still working on designating their command ships. Hold off your assault until I'm finished!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Hornet II：</span><br>
Roger!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Langley II：</span><br>
Commander, Hornet's group is hanging in there, for now.<br>
Unfortunately, things aren't looking very good. The enemy's strength is simply dumbfounding.<br>
In addition to aircraft and drones, they've also deployed a lot of submersibles and mini-submarines.<br>
While we do have the advantage in one-on-one fights, their swarms of expendable weaponry are starting to overwhelm us.<br>
<br>
Anzeel gave me a report the night before which outlined the Type II rigging's construction and the functions it improved upon.<br>
Chief among them are a general combat effectiveness increase, jamming countermeasures, and built-in electronic warfare capabilities.<br>
Special mentions should also be given to the enhanced communications and information processing systems.<br>
These allow shipgirls on the field to directly share info with each other via data links, and draw much more potential out of a shipgirl's hull.<br>
This technology is the result of a production process that consumes additional Wisdom Cubes...<br>
And research that, according to Anzeel, I played a significant role in.<br>
"We have the upper hand when it comes to information sharing. We have to use it to our advantage."<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Langley II：</span><br>
You mean the data link? I guess so... The increased data processing power is one of the major selling points of the new rigging type.<br>
This makes it possible to analyze data instantaneously and relay the results to shipgirls on the field in almost real-time.<br>
It allows us to act as one, based on the orders you issue us.<br>
Your terminal should be relaying information received from our end as well, right? It's an astronomical improvement over the back-and-forth radioing of the past.<br>
<br>
"So, aircraft can be much better coordinated when they all have access to the same information, right?"<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Langley II：</span><br>
Correct! That's one of the features you helped develop.<br>
You can also hand over control of certain reconnaissance equipment, something I took advantage of at the beginning of the exercise to continue gathering data while letting the others focus on the fight.<br>
<br>
"Does the same apply to other carrier-based aircraft? Isn't it possible for carriers to share each other's air wings?"<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Langley II：</span><br>
Um, let me see... Oh, you can! I can't believe I overlooked that.<br>
I'm glad you're here, Commander. You have a better grasp of the situation than we do individually.<br>
<br>
The truth is, however... I don't know any more about this new rigging than they do. Maybe even less. They say I helped develop it, but I have no recollection of that at all.<br>
"Yorktown, can you hear me?"<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Yorktown II：</span><br>
Yes, Commander?<br>
<br>
"How's the situation on your end? Have you been able to cover the anti-submarine warfare?"<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Yorktown II：</span><br>
We've managed to deal with the underwater threat for now...<br>
But, the air situation is still not looking too good. While I'm fighting for some airspace control, Hammann has to worry about both anti-ship and anti-submarine combat.<br>
Sorry, but I won't be able to help the other two groups right now.<br>
<br>
"Don't worry. In fact, I'm here to lend you a hand."<br>
"Your recon planes aren't much use in a dogfight. Let Langley take control of them so she can pinpoint the location of the enemy command ships."<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Yorktown II：</span><br>
Give control to Langley? Okay, let me just... There, they're hers now.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Hammann II：</span><br>
Look out, Yorktown! We've got more mini-subs incoming!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Yorktown II：</span><br>
Shoot, what terrifying numbers... Memphis really is going all-out this time.<br>
<br>
"Hang in there a bit longer. We'll have our chance to turn things around soon enough."<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Yorktown II：</span><br>
Understood! I'll fight with all I've got!<br>
<br>
"Langley, use all the recon aircraft at your disposal to mark those command ships."<br>
"As soon as you do that, I'll give the order to have everyone focus fire on them."<br>
"Then, while chaos spreads among the mass-produced ships, we'll deal a devastating blow to Memphis' main fleet and seize victory."<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Langley II：</span><br>
Roger!<br>
{{折叠面板|内容结束}}

{{折叠面板|标题=Seizing the Advantage|选项=11|主框=1|样式=primary|展开=是}}
<br>
KABOOOM!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Langley II：</span><br>
All designated command ships have been successfully eliminated! The enemy line is in shambles!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Northampton II：</span><br>
I'll be damned... You actually did it, Commander!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Yorktown II：</span><br>
Now that the enemy's been crippled, we'll ride the momentum and push forward as one, right?<br>
<br>
"That's the plan. We'll still need to take out enemies sequentially, according to their relative levels of risk. I'll re-assess the situation from that point."<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Hammann II：</span><br>
Yorktown! How did I do?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Yorktown II：</span><br>
You were outstanding, Hammann. You managed to hold your own against enemy ships and subs, and bought me enough time to mount our counterattack.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Hammann II：</span><br>
Heehee~ Thank you!!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Hornet II：</span><br>
Hehe, piece of cake. Is that all those souped-up tin cans have to show?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Yorktown II：</span><br>
Far from it. The battle isn't over yet.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Hornet II：</span><br>
I know, I know. I'm not as naive as I used to be.<br>
<br>
As far as I can tell from the data links, Memphis' main fleet has been completely destroyed.<br>
And yet, she's not said a word to us over the radio.<br>
That's a bad omen. She's got to be planning a comeback.<br>
If I was able to figure out her fleet's weakness, she's surely figured out mine as well.<br>
That being, our carriers have an immense presence, but their protection is critically lacking.<br>
I have successfully divided up her forces. However...<br>
If she regroups outside our recon range, then launches a focused assault on us, we'll be in serious trouble.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Langley II：</span><br>
Status update. The blue team's main fleet has been destroyed. While our shipgirls have sustained no damage, we have lost 40% of our aircraft.<br>
Memphis has yet to make a clear move. What shall we do?<br>
<br>
"For now, regroup in anticipation of an enemy ambush. Afterwards, we'll reorganize our groups."<br>
"Hammann, Langley, you'll swap places and turn on your electronic warfare gear."<br>
"Langley, I need you to send out a duplicate of Hammann's signal near Yorktown, while Hammann turns her signal off altogether."<br>
I've read all the materials about the Type II that I could get my hands on, and I'm still not sure if my proposal is actually doable...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Langley II：</span><br>
Understood. I can do that.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Yorktown II：</span><br>
What are you planning, Commander? This sounds like it'll make you look unprotected...<br>
Wait... Don't tell me you're going to use yourself as bait!<br>
<br>
"Correct. It will lure Memphis into attacking me while giving your group more fighting power."<br>
"It's a risky plan, but it's worth a shot."<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Yorktown II：</span><br>
As you say... I'll scramble my planes as soon as anything happens. Just be careful!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Langley II：</span><br>
Looking at the radar, it seems we have a bite already. She's sending her reserve fleet this way.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Hornet II：</span><br>
Her RESERVE fleet? She really was waiting for an opportunity like this!<br>
<br>
"Our aircraft will make short work of them before they get here, and she must know that. This reeks of a distraction to me..."<br>

<br>
Later in the exercise...<br>
The girls are doing a good job holding back the reserve fleet, but there are so many enemies to deal with that they can't focus on anything else.<br>
Everyone is fighting hard, except for Hammann, who's with me on the command ship's deck.<br>
She's pacing around anxiously, keeping an eye on my device for updates on the battle.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Hammann II：</span><br>
Why am I sitting around while everyone else is fighting for dear life?<br>
The Commander clearly made the wrong call here...<br>
<br>
"What's wrong, Hammann? Do you have a problem with my deployments?"<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Hammann II：</span><br>
Huh? I guess. I just wish I was doing something to help. I'm not mad at you or anything...<br>
They're handling themselves well, but that doesn't change the fact...<br>
...Wait! A blip just appeared on our sonar! An enemy is nearby!<br>
A big one, too. It must be a big submarine... No, it's the size of a battleship!<br>
Heads up! It's resurfacing!<br>
<br>
The seas rumble, and a massive, silver-clad vessel emerges from the depths.<br>
Just as I anticipated, Memphis' reserve fleet is only a diversion. This mega-submarine is the real threat to us.<br>
"Interesting exterior. It looks a lot like the submarine Belorussiya's crew used when I went to the Northern Parliament."<br>
<span style="color:#ec5d53;">Memphis：</span><br>
This is no Northern Parliament vessel. She's the Epimetheus, a Federation mega-submarine for deep-sea exploration.<br>
She's outfitted with a range of sensors and supercomputers that processes data from the ocean floor just as well as the battlefield.<br>
And not only that, her cannons pack more than enough firepower to blow your command ship to kingdom come!<br>
Heheh... Sounds like you're lost for words.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Hornet II：</span><br>
They let you have a submarine that can dive out of our sonar range?!<br>
How is that fair?! That's literally cheating!<br>
<span style="color:#ec5d53;">Memphis：</span><br>
Cry about it. Even if you scramble your planes, it's too late.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Hammann II：</span><br>
I'm so sorry, Commander. I had no clue she'd made it right next to us...<br>
<br>
"It's okay. She should have no idea YOU'RE here either. Strike now while she's unaware!"<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Hammann II：</span><br>
Got it! I'll show her what happens when you mess with us!<br>
<br>
KABOOOM!<br>
Memphis' mega-submarine is a very different beast to an ordinary mass-produced ship, but still, it's not designed specifically for combat.<br>
A shipgirl should easily prove a fair fight for it.<br>
"You're not the only one with a trump card. You might want to–"<br>
<span style="color:#ec5d53;">Memphis：</span><br>
Back down? I don't think so!<br>
Didn't you hear me? This baby has supercomputers and advanced sensors onboard!<br>
I knew Hammann was with you from the moment I reached the surface!<br>
That's why I resurfaced from a distance – to lure her away from you while I do... THIS!<br>
Target: deck of the command ship at twelve-o'-clock!<br>
Activate escape pod! Bail out!<br>
<br>
KABOOOM!<br>
An oval-shaped object shoots out of her mega-submarine, coming straight towards me.<br>
It lands just nearby on the deck, then burst open to reveal Memphis, rigging at the ready.<br>
<span style="color:#ec5d53;">Memphis：</span><br>
Checkmate, Commander.<br>
While you did display excellent knowledge of tactics and mastery of the Type II rigging's functions, you did not anticipate me boarding you.<br>
You did well, but I was one step ahead.<br>
<br>
Sure, I didn't anticipate a tactical use of her escape pod, but I DID plan for something similar.<br>
<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项1："Nice thinking outside the box, Memphis."</span>'''''<br>
<span style="color:#ec5d53;">Memphis：</span><br>
Thank you. I contemplated a thousand different ways to beat you, and eventually arrived at this one.<br>
<br>
"I see. You deserve a promotion. The battle isn't over yet, though."<br>
<span style="color:#ec5d53;">Memphis：</span><br>
It will be once I neutralize you. Without someone to command your team, it will... Huh?<br>
Wait... What are those planes?<br>
<br>
"My contingency plan in case you were to board my command vessel through some means."<br>
"Open fire!"<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Yorktown II：</span><br>
Grab on to something, Commander!<br>
<br>
KABOOOM!<br>
<span style="color:#ffd000;">Announcer：</span><br>
Blue team's flagship has been destroyed. The exercise is over. Red team has won.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Memphis：</span><br>
Wow... I applaud you, Commander. I thought I planned for everything, and still you were one step ahead.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Dr. Anzeel：</span><br>
Holy smokes, what a finale! I was on the edge of my seat there.<br>
You really deserve a round of applause, Commander. I get why everyone adores you now.<br>
Both sides, great job. This was truly a spectacular test. Expect a juicy reward for all your efforts later.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Hornet II：</span><br>
It better be good! We worked our asses off today, and with minimal time to prepare!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Dr. Anzeel：</span><br>
Yeah... Sorry 'bout that. On the bright side, we have the next few days off while the team analyzes the exercise data.<br>
Heck, we can take my plane and go on a short vacation somewhere! The Commander would probably like that.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Hammann II：</span><br>
An actual vacation? Really?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Hornet II：</span><br>
Aww hell yeah! Commander, Dr. Anzeel, you're the best!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Dr. Anzeel：</span><br>
Hang on, someone's calling... Oh, it's Aoste. Just a minute.<br>
...Anzeel speaking. What's up?<br>
...I mean, what do you think? The test went perfectly.<br>
...Yeah, I guess it was a given, with the Commander at the helm.<br>
...You did that? That totally explains why the blue team was overpowered in quantity AND quality.<br>
...Come again?<br>
...You know me too well. Data will take a few days to process, so yeah, might as well take some time off.<br>
...You're serious? Okay. I dig the sound of that.<br>
...Yeah, I'll try to explain it to the Commander. Talk to you later.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Yorktown II：</span><br>
What was that about, Dr. Anzeel?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Dr. Anzeel：</span><br>
Nothing important. We just talked about vacation destinations.<br>
He told me about a pretty sweet place, actually. Ever heard of Samos Island?<br>

<span style="color:#4eb24e;">TB：</span><br>
Overflow resolved. Reality Lens data analysis program functioning normally.<br>
Maintaining crisis response. Temporal regulator restored to 95% functionality.<br>
Subjective time ratio has been restored to 67%.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Memphis：</span><br>
Thank goodness... We were seconds from disaster.<br>
We've regained control of the temporal regulator, so I think we're well on our way to saving the Commander.<br>
Helena, can you release the safety lock?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Helena：</span><br>
Understood. Releasing emergency safety lock... And done!<br>
TB, disconnect the Commander and restore consciousness.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">TB：</span><br>
Orders received. Proceeding with emergency rescue sequence—<br>
Warning: Unable to restore connection with the Commander's consciousness.<br>
Warning: Unable to confirm Commander's presence in Virtual Space 3.<br>
Warning: Unable to monitor virtual space.<br>
Conclusion: The Commander does not currently exist in the virtual space constructed from Anchorage's hull data.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Vestal：</span><br>
Does not currently exist...? Umm, are you saying the Commander is not in her dream?<br>
...In other words, the Commander is no longer inside the Reality Lens?!<br>
TB, please! Tell us what's happened!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">TB：</span><br>
Apologies, I am unable to disclose that information through my language programs.<br>
The Commander's body exists within the Reality Lens. The connection between the Commander's consciousness and the Reality Lens is stable.<br>
However, I am unable to locate the Commander's consciousness, and therefore cannot monitor the virtual space.<br>
Hypothesis: The Commander's consciousness has been transferred to an inaccessible space.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Helena：</span><br>
An inaccessible virtual space? TB, aren't you the administrator of the Reality Lens?<br>
I've never heard of any areas in your own mainframe that you don't have the power to monitor.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">TB：</span><br>
Per protocol, I am not authorized to disclose this information. Insufficient clearance.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Memphis：</span><br>
Everyone, just calm down! TB, I need you to tell me one thing. Is the Commander's consciousness safe?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">TB：</span><br>
Query received. Currently attempting to trace the Commander's consciousness–<br>
The Commander is still connected to the Reality Lens. Therefore, it must still exist.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Memphis：</span><br>
That doesn't tell us much... Okay. Let's try this.<br>
The Commander's body and mind are still here in the Reality Lens.<br>
If we give the order to shut down the device, the Reality Lens should automatically disconnect from the Commander as a safety precaution.<br>
It might result in some confusion once this is over, but if nothing else, it should save the Commander.<br>
Think it'll work, TB?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">TB：</span><br>
In theory, it should be possible.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Memphis：</span><br>
Alright, let's try it. Shut down the Reality Lens and bring the Commander's mind back.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">TB：</span><br>
Orders received. Shutting down the Reality Lens.<br>
Shutdown program halted. Administrative permissions required.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Vestal：</span><br>
Wait, what's going on? I thought you had the highest level of administrative privileges!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">TB：</span><br>
The authorizations required to use the shutdown program have changed. I do not have access to this function.<br>
I will need to be granted permission or a temporary authorization code to complete this action.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Memphis：</span><br>
The authorizations... have changed? We didn't do anything of the sort...<br>
Did someone secretly modify the authorization requirements after the experiments started? But how...?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Vestal：</span><br>
Memphis! Now isn't the time to worry about that.<br>
We need to focus on what we can do for the time being!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Memphis：</span><br>
Y-yeah. You're right... Helena, can you continue monitoring the situation?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Helena：</span><br>
Will you... help us again...?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Memphis：</span><br>
Helena? What's going on?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Helena：</span><br>
Perhaps you, of all people... could successfully hack into the Sea of Stars.<br>
Can I... trust you?<br>
Can I trust you... "Helena?"<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Vestal：</span><br>
Helena, who are you talking to?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Helena：</span><br>
Emergency control code: 47741 30130 30146. Authorizing agent: "Helena."<br>
I know how we can save the Commander.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Memphis：</span><br>
Huh...?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Helena：</span><br>
TB, transfer control of the Tower to "Helena."<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">TB：</span><br>
Orders received. Transferring control now.<br>
Emergency access code confirmed. Permissions transfer complete.<br>

Now, please grant me permission to track the virtual space.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Helena：</span><br>
Understood. It's up to you now, Helena...<br>
<br>
Helena murmured, seemingly to herself, and typed a code into the control apparatus.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">TB：</span><br>
Orders received. Tracking virtual space.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Memphis：</span><br>
Helena, what did you just do?<br>
I didn't know TB... heck, the entire Sea of Stars had this function.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Vestal：</span><br>
How did you do all that? And who were you talking to just now...?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Helena：</span><br>
S-sorry, it's a bit complicated...<br>
If you bear with me, I'll try to explain after we rescue the Commander...<br>

<br>
[Reality Lens Replicated Space] [Location: Chartered plane WFH 'n' Chill Mk. 1] [Cognitive merging data unknown]<br>
As soon as we get our luggage sorted, Anzeel plops down on a plush couch inside her jet's cabin and gazes out the window.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Dr. Anzeel：</span><br>
Ooh, that's nice... I tell ya, there's no place like home.<br>
I did a full day's work. Finally, time to kick back and relax...<br>
<br>
"Speaking of home, I've been wondering about this plane's name."<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Dr. Anzeel：</span><br>
Hm? You got a problem with the name I gave it?<br>
<br>
"...Never mind, actually."<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Dr. Anzeel：</span><br>
What's with that look on your face? C'mon, grab a coffee and take it easy.<br>
<br>
I accept the cup of hot coffee Anzeel hands me. She goes right back to flipping through some documents.<br>
Not exactly my idea of "taking it easy."<br>
Or maybe, reading something is just a way for her to clear her head.<br>
I've probably been overthinking this too much. I'm not going to get more information about this world if I don't ask her.<br>
Last night was a bit too hectic to even make small talk, but this is a good opportunity.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Dr. Anzeel：</span><br>
What are you staring at me for?<br>
Oh, I get it. You're part of the tea faction, aren't you?<br>
<br>
Where should I even begin...?<br>
<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项1："So about that movie, 'The Final Countdown'..."</span>'''''<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Dr. Anzeel：</span><br>
The one where the fleet travels through time?<br>
Pretty crazy how Bonnie got the lead role in that movie, huh?<br>
I already knew though, since I got to sit in on their internal screenings.<br>
Y'know, I would've at least liked to be one of the extras...<br>
But it just didn't mesh with my schedule, so I couldn't.<br>
Oh, right. You wanted to ask me about something, huh? Maybe time travel?<br>
I'm the kind of person who'd try to change the past, no doubt about it.<br>
Sure, it might cause the preordained future to unravel, but that's not a bad thing, is it?<br>
If anything, doesn't that mean there's a chance to create a better future?<br>
In the end, isn't that what humans are always trying to do, with or without time travel?<br>
For the sake of creating a better future, I think changing the past is perfectly reasonable. Maybe even morally correct.<br>
But, Aoste probably wouldn't agree with me on that one.<br>
<br>
"Speaking of Aoste, what has he been up to recently?"<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Dr. Anzeel：</span><br>
That guy... What doesn't he research? His team has gotten so big these days that he has his hands in every cookie jar at once.<br>
After all, he's now our prized Renaissance man, master-of-all-trades.<br>
I think he's been focusing on AI research these days though.<br>
I think you've already met his favorite. Does "Zero" ring a bell?<br>
She's part of Project ANTI-X. They seem to be next-generation humanoid weapons.<br>
<br>
...Zero?<br>
Suddenly, Yorktown comes up to us, holding a tray of pastries.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Dr. Anzeel：</span><br>
Oh, Yorktown. Need something?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Yorktown II：</span><br>
Doctor, Commander. Would you like some sweets?<br>
The new instant mechanical confectioner is working very well.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Dr. Anzeel：</span><br>
Sweets, huh? Wait, come again? An instant mechanical confectioner?<br>
I said I'd pay for souvenirs, not whatever that is!<br>
Spill the beans, Yorktown! Who did the deed?! You? Hornet? Or maybe the Commander?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Yorktown II：</span><br>
Hornet bought it. Erm, she said it seemed like fun to make sweets in a chartered plane...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Dr. Anzeel：</span><br>
And she got you hooked, huh?<br>
I get it. What's done is done, and if it tastes good, maybe it's not all bad...<br>
<br>
Despite her grumbling, she gets up and makes her way to the mechanical confectioner.<br>
"The facilities and furniture in this charter plane are too nice to be just a private plane, aren't they?"<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Yorktown II：</span><br>
The military provided this plane for the doctor.<br>
As I recall, some corporate alliance from the Union used cutting-edge Energy Cube technology to make it. It can fly smoothly in any weather.<br>
Heehee. This is my first time riding, too, Commander.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Dr. Anzeel：</span><br>
Commander, this mechanical confectioner is awesome!<br>
<br>
It looks like Yorktown's going to tell me something, but Anzeel interrupts with her shouting from the hallway.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Dr. Anzeel：</span><br>
It's seriously so cool! You gotta try it out! I mean, it can make anything!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Yorktown II：</span><br>
Shall we, Commander?<br>
{{折叠面板|内容结束}}

{{折叠面板|标题=Samos Island|选项=15|主框=1|样式=primary|展开=是}}
<br>
Anzeel's charter plane lands at the Samos Island airport and we disembark.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Friedrich der Große：</span><br>
Before I go, let me leave you with a gift. You'll want to pay a visit to Samos Island.<br>
All I can say is that you'll find something of intrigue there.<br>
<br>
"Something of intrigue, huh. That's so vague I'm not sure what to think of it."<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Friedrich der Große：</span><br>
If I knew what it is, I would tell you a little more. Sadly, I don't.<br>
<br>
Friedrich has mentioned Samos Island, too...<br>
But will I really find that thing of intrigue here? In this virtual space?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Northampton II：</span><br>
Bright sunlight, sandy beach... Now that's a vacation island for you.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Hornet II：</span><br>
It's like an island resort!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Dr. Anzeel：</span><br>
Right? I told you we were gonna party.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Hornet II：</span><br>
You also said this place had a secret military research facility. I don't see anything like that, though...<br>
Should they be letting tourists get so close to a military facility in the first place?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Dr. Anzeel：</span><br>
I forgot that this was your first time here. This is how some secret research facilities are.<br>
It's not the facility that needs to be hidden; it's the research.<br>
You never know. Maybe that university had a lab where they conduct secret experiments right under the café!<br>
Anyway, it's not like this facility isn't hidden.<br>
Outsiders think it's just the Samos Marine Research Institute, though.<br>
A long time ago, they actually used to research marine life here.<br>
One day the military took over, and it became Dr. Aoste's research facility.<br>
I think he had his reasons for picking this place.<br>
But hey, it's a tourist destination. Maybe he just picked it so he could hang out on the beach when he feels lazy.<br>
Ooh! Commander, did everyone bring swimsuits?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Hornet II：</span><br>
Umm... I didn't.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Yorktown II：</span><br>
Me, neither. I'm sorry, Commander...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Langley II：</span><br>
That goes to show just how few of us seriously see this as a vacation.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Dr. Anzeel：</span><br>
You heard them, Commander. You'd better go get some swimsuits!<br>
<br>
"We didn't come here just to have fun, did we?"<br>
<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项1："What can I help out with?"</span>'''''<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Dr. Anzeel：</span><br>
Forget about that for now! Right now, we gotta think of how to get these girls ready to swim!<br>
Oh, but don't worry about buying swimsuits for everyone.<br>
Aoste has facilities that can make gear for each individual guard on demand, so I bet there's something here that can make swimsuits and other clothes!<br>
Maybe it even spits out certain designs on demand!<br>
<br>
"Would he really have equipment like that?"<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Yorktown II：</span><br>
Should we be wasting time on the beach...?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Dr. Anzeel：</span><br>
Don't worry about it! You came all this way to help, so we gotta let you indulge yourselves a little!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Hornet II：</span><br>
As long as it's okay...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Dr. Anzeel：</span><br>
The facility's just through these woods. Make sure you keep up! We don't want anyone getting lost.<br>
{{折叠面板|内容结束}}

{{折叠面板|标题=Zero?|选项=16|主框=1|样式=primary|展开=是}}
<br>
After a walk through the woods, we reach an aging facility.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Dr. Anzeel：</span><br>
Authenticating access, aaand... Done.<br>
Heheh. Open sesame!<br>
Welcome, one and all, to Aoste's own research center: the Samos Marine Research Institute!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Hornet II：</span><br>
Th-thanks...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Dr. Anzeel：</span><br>
Geez, temper your excitement. This is THE secret research facility! Aren't you excited at all?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Hornet II：</span><br>
It's kinda plain. Like, it's just... a research facility, like you'd expect.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Dr. Anzeel：</span><br>
If you're gonna camouflage your secret research facility, then go all the way! That's basically Aoste's motto.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Hammann II：</span><br>
Is that... a room full of fish tanks?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Dr. Anzeel：</span><br>
Yep! That's a remnant of when this place actually performed marine research.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Hornet II：</span><br>
Wow, and it's so well-maintained. They've even got fish in there... Now I'm hungry.<br>
Is fish the main course at the cafeteria here?!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Dr. Anzeel：</span><br>
Poultry is, actually. But they do serve fish.<br>
This one time back at university, Aoste and I visited the aquarium together.<br>
The exhibits were, well, okay. But their restaurant's specialty was grilled squid!<br>
So you'd see squids in the exhibits, and then you'd have to eat their relatives...<br>
Let me tell you, I remember crying while I put lemon on it more than I remember the aquarium itself!<br>
Yorktown, you ought to take the Commander and Enterprise out on a date there sometime!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Yorktown II：</span><br>
Eugh... They didn't cook the squids from the exhibits, did they...?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Dr. Anzeel：</span><br>
Of course they did! They had other stuff like that, too~<br>
Now that I think about it, maybe Aoste chose this Marine Research Institute because of the trauma...<br>
Anyway, the boring building up ahead is our destination.<br>
You'd never know what kind of research is going on here unless you went in there!<br>
<br>
Me and the others set foot inside the building's main hall. Then, something unexpected happens.<br>
There's a panel next to the entrance. It glows and starts projecting a hologram.<br>
The hologram looks familiar. Is that...?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">???：</span><br>
Welcome back, Dr. Anzeel.<br>
<br>
TB?!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Dr. Anzeel：</span><br>
Lookin' cute as ever, Zero. Is Aoste in?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Zero?：</span><br>
Yes. He has been awaiting you.<br>
Unfortunately, the doctor is currently preoccupied with work. You cannot meet him quite yet.<br>
So for the time being, I will be your guide around the facility.<br>
Subject for Artificial Navy Transformational Intelligence, Class X is ready for testing. Will you be observing?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Dr. Anzeel：</span><br>
Yes, please lead the way. Also, that full name is too much of a mouthful. Just go with Antiochus, alright?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Zero?：</span><br>
Understood. I will now guide you to the testing area.<br>
<br>
There's a slight beneath my feet. Most likely some sort of machine springing into action.<br>
Then, the floor ahead of us splits in two, forming a set of staircases that lead down.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Yorktown II：</span><br>
I presume this is our way to the secret institute.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Dr. Anzeel：</span><br>
Right you are.<br>
Now come along and I'll show you what the "Marine Research Institute" REALLY works on!<br>

<br>
[Reality Lens Replicated Space] [Location: Samos Island, Secret Underground Laboratory] [Cognitive merging data unknown]<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Hornet II：</span><br>
Just how far underground are we?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Langley II：</span><br>
Good question. I'd estimate around 20 or 30 meters.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Hornet II：</span><br>
With how many branching paths by now?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Langley II：</span><br>
I'm not sure... Why do you ask?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Hornet II：</span><br>
Thought I'd explore this place, but I don't wanna get lost. How many do you reckon, Commander?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Zero?：</span><br>
I do not endorse moving through the facility without a Navigator.<br>
Each and every corridor here leads to a different testing area, all of which are isolated from each other.<br>
Furthermore, you would not make it past the entrance to any of them without the proper clearance.<br>
In the event of a breach, the security systems will engage and sound an alarm. Please be aware of that.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Hornet II：</span><br>
Oh, then I won't. Sorry.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Zero?：</span><br>
It's alright. Simply follow my lights and there will be no issue.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Hammann II：</span><br>
It's so dark and spooky in here...<br>
I don't like it... I wanna go back to where we were before...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Yorktown II：</span><br>
You'll have to hang in there a bit longer, Hammann. Dr. Aoste has a very different personality than what we're used to.<br>
The Commander's with us, so just bear with it, okay?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Dr. Anzeel：</span><br>
Hrmm... I figured something like this would happen.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Yorktown II：</span><br>
Knew what would happen?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Dr. Anzeel：</span><br>
More often than not, having the backing of the military isn't a good thing.<br>
I can tell, that guy's under a ton of pressure right now.<br>
He not only has his own projects to attend to but also has to deal with the whims and never-ending demands of the military folks.<br>
His project team has gone through several rounds of expansion, fragmenting, and reorganizing, all the while their workload continues to grow.<br>
With deadlines to meet and confidentiality levels to balance, keeping this place running must be an absolute nightmare<br>
Basically, there's a laundry list of reasons why the facility looks the way it does. Try not to take it out on the staff, alright?<br>
Having that said, we're not some formal government delegation either. Just follow me and don't go running around, and we shouldn't have any problems.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Langley II：</span><br>
I see... Everyone has their own share of troubles, huh?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Hornet II：</span><br>
I can manage that. Not like this is my first choice for a date spot either, hehe~<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Zero?：</span><br>
Thank you for your understanding in this matter.<br>
We're almost there. Please stand behind the yellow line while the doors open.<br>
<br>
I do so as instructed, and the massive doors shielding the research division part for us, revealing a lab that seems to double as a manufacturing facility.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Zero?：</span><br>
The assembly workshop is open. Standing by pending further directives.<br>
The experimental ANTI-X vessel scheduled to participate in the upcoming test is just ahead. Please wait for further instructions from Dr. Aoste.<br>
<br>
The hologram of "Zero," the girl who looks uncannily like TB, disappears after finishing her words.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Hornet II：</span><br>
Whoooa! This place is huuuge!<br>
Look at all the equipment hanging from the ceiling... I can't even imagine how much that must've cost.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Langley II：</span><br>
Incredible... A single one of those glowing-blue facilities must be worth more than Dr. Anzeel's plane...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Northampton II：</span><br>
Look over there. That corridor seems to lead to some kind of... harbor?<br>
Even though we're deep underground, they even dug out an underground waterway.<br>
I wonder where it leads...<br>
<br>
The immense facility before me has me lost for words.<br>
Row after row of highly sophisticated machinery, occupying enough space to fit several football fields. Another passage that leads even deeper underground. But most interesting of all...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Arbiter: The Devil XV：</span><br>
Is a girl with black hair sitting on the railing in the hall, her back against an enormous metallic contraption.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Dr. Anzeel：</span><br>
Woah, look at that, my assistant! Isn't that freakin' amazing?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Arbiter: The Devil XV：</span><br>
The figure in front of me exudes a familiar, oppressive aura––<br>
So much so that the instant I see her, a single word starts to wrack my mind: Arbiter.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Dr. Anzeel：</span><br>
I can't believe my eyes! Her hair... isn't white!!<br>
<br>
"..."<br>
<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项1："That's what you're most surprised about?"</span>'''''<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Dr. Anzeel：</span><br>
Zero, come here! I need to know this girl's name!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Zero?：</span><br>
Acknowledged. This is a vessel for "The Devil XV."<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Dr. Anzeel：</span><br>
Another Major Arcana name, huh? Aoste, you edgy lad.<br>
<br>
"The Devil XV? I knew it... That's just like the designation of the Sirens' Arbiter Program!"<br>
Anzeel also just said she's Dr. Aoste's creation... Is he the father of all Arbiters – or even of all Sirens?<br>
Project ANTI-X... Antiochus... So it wasn't a coincidence after all...<br>
<span style="color:#ff9900;">Takao.META：</span><br>
The attack on NY City... was no more than a ploy devised by the Antiochus. Its true purpose was for us to meet one another.<br>
As for us, we are but Ember and Ash in the wind. You need not concern yourself with our names.<br>
<br>
I remember the first time I heard that word, "Antiochus."<br>
"Artificial Navy Transformational Intelligence, Class X." The Sirens' true name...<br>
Wait, why is the Reality Lens showing me this? And why am I taking this information at face value?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Memphis：</span><br>
Commander, are you okay? You look pale.<br>
<br>
If none of this is actually real, why aren't I doing something to get back to reality?<br>
I have to know. Someone needs to tell me what's real.<br>
<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项1："Memphis, about the Sirens––"</span>'''''<br>
<br>
She let something slip about the "Reality Lens" earlier. She has to know something.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Memphis：</span><br>
Huh? Commander, what are you saying...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Dr. Anzeel：</span><br>
Are you alright? And what are these "Sirens" you keep talking about?<br>
<br>
Memphis's reaction to that word was clear and immediate. She's related to my current situation, but how exactly?<br>
She doesn't seem to be acting maliciously, but why isn't she telling me anything?<br>
<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项1："Sorry, I mixed something up in my head."</span>'''''<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Dr. Anzeel：</span><br>
Hey, I'm not gonna let you squirm your way out of an explanation after you said all that.<br>
You said something about "Sirens" and some "Arbiter Program." Never heard of those things before, but they definitely sound like Aoste lingo.<br>
*gasp*... Have the two of you been secretly working on a project behind my back?!<br>
<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项1：(Continue to improvise a story on the spot.)</span>'''''<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Dr. Anzeel：</span><br>
So... Those words just came to you in a dream?<br>
I suppose that's not too unusual in this line of work.<br>
See, while dreams are usually reconstructions of your memories, sometimes they'll hit you with something you've never even thought of.<br>
Dreams follow their own rules. Sometimes they can't be logically explained, other times they can't be explained at all.<br>
The brain has a tendency to mash things together and recombine them into things that you perceive as entirely new information. Happens to me all the time.<br>
For all we know, these "Sirens" could be a mishmash of mythology, horror, and sci-fi.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Yorktown II：</span><br>
(Psst, Hornet. Why is she giving the Commander a lecture on dreams?)<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Hornet II：</span><br>
(Beats me. All I know is we have to step in, or she'll never stop.)<br>
(Hey, Zero. Can you power up that Antiochus vessel?)<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Zero?：</span><br>
(Yes. The Devil is in standby mode and ready to be activated whenever desired.)<br>
<br>
While Yorktown and Hornet whispered about something among themselves, Anzeel kept going and going.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Hornet II：</span><br>
(Then do me a favor. Wake Devil up and tell it to draw the doctor's attention.)<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Zero?：</span><br>
(Understood. Initiating program.)<br>
<br>
Suddenly, the machine behind the black-haired Arbiter begins to whirr softly.<br>
A few moments later, she stretches her arms, and listlessly opens her eyes.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">The Devil XV：</span><br>
Hmm...? Who woke me up?<br>
Oh, must've been you guys. Guessing you're with Dr. Anzeel.<br>
Welcome to the Samos Marine Research Institute. I'm The Devil XV. Just "Devil" is fine.<br>
I've received the plans for our test and am ready to get started.<br>
Lemme know if you need something.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Dr. Anzeel：</span><br>
......<br>
...Holy shit.<br>
She's so cute I'm gonna get diabetes!<br>
<br>
I've never seen Anzeel run before, but she closed the gap between her and the Devil in a terrifyingly short span of time.<br>
She whips her phone out, buzzing around the bored-looking girl, snapping pictures of her from every which way.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Hornet II：</span><br>
Hook, line, and sinker! The Commander's free!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Anzeel：</span><br>
Awwwww! You're the sweetest little devil ever!<br>
Let's see a smile! Look into the camera!<br>
Yeah, that's perfect!<br>
Three, two, one!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Memphis：</span><br>
Doctor, everything in this facility is absolutely top secret.<br>
Any pictures you take will be deleted on the way out.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Anzeel：</span><br>
Dammit, I forgot!<br>
Aww... Wait, I've got it!<br>
I can send these pics to Aoste before they get deleted...<br>
Then after we've left, I'll ask him to send them to me, citing communication between project members. I'm a genius!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Memphis：</span><br>
That's not a solution, Doctor. That's leaking classified material.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Anzeel：</span><br>
No it's not! It's perfectly within the rules!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Zero?：</span><br>
Commander, Dr. Anzeel. Dr. Aoste's work has concluded. He is waiting for you in his office.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Hornet II：</span><br>
Whoa! That's no hologram, that's actually her in the flesh!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Dr. Anzeel：</span><br>
Uooooh! She's even cuter in person!<br>
Anyway, come along, Commander! It's time you met Aoste.<br>
Everyone else, you can stay here and chat with Devil.<br>
{{折叠面板|内容结束}}

{{折叠面板|标题=The Magister|选项=18|主框=1|样式=primary|展开=是}}
<br>
We make our way to Dr. Aoste's office.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Dr. Aoste：</span><br>
That will be all, Zero. Go work on something else.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Zero?：</span><br>
As you command.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Dr. Aoste：</span><br>
So, Commander, what do you think of the new Antiochus?<br>
They put Anzeel's silly puppets to shame, wouldn't you agree?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Dr. Anzeel：</span><br>
All I have to say is that they're leagues cuter than the previous ones. I was getting tired of the white hair.<br>
<br>
"I must admit, many of your Antiochus do share common features... Was that by design, Dr. Aoste?"<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Dr. Aoste：</span><br>
Yes. Reusing a tried and tested design is efficient. Unlike someone here, I don't concern myself with frivolous appearances.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Dr. Anzeel：</span><br>
Bite me. Anyway, let's get to the point.<br>
You didn't call us all the way here just to show off your new Antiochus, did you?<br>
Be honest with me here. You dabbled in some tech you don't understand, didn't you?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Dr. Aoste：</span><br>
Indeed... The newest Antiochus model has something that the prior ones did not, something akin to your Wisdom Cubes.<br>
Just as the two of you have been trying to incorporate Wisdom Cubes into the Type II rigging, I have been applying a similar technology to the latest generation of Antiochus vessels.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Dr. Anzeel：</span><br>
You... You made these Antiochus with Wisdom Cubes?!<br>
How is that even possible? They don't even have hull data to pull from!<br>
Hull data stores the embodiment of human emotions associated with the conceptual existence of a warship...<br>
You can't just reach into a magic hat... How can you use Wisdom Cubes to give form to something from pure fiction?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Dr. Aoste：</span><br>
You're correct. Allow me to explain – the Antiochus are fundamentally different from your KAN-SEN.<br>
KAN-SEN draw information from the Wisdom Cube and are embodied as individuals with personalities based upon the concepts and emotions imprinted in their hull data.<br>
On the other hand, the Antiochus are simply androids with an anthropomorphized personality installed. In that sense, my creations are closer to puppets than yours.<br>
But that isn't important. What matters is that the Commander developed the Type II rigging using Wisdom Cubes not to create KAN-SEN, but to make a conceptual weapon capable of augmenting their hull data.<br>
That inspired me to devise a similar process. Using Energy Cubes, I tapped into the concept of a weapon that does not rely on core data, and manifested that instead.<br>
Just as the Commander managed to add information to hull data through the Type II rigging, I used a similar process to add information to the Antiochus using Energy Cubes.<br>
Furthermore, these new weapons are modular in nature and not locked to any particular individual. One of your more worthwhile ideas to borrow, Anzeel.<br>
Commander, as you already know, I am more interested in technology than playing with Anzeel's dolls. No offense to you, of course.<br>
At a fundamental level, the Antiochus are built with a sophisticated AI program at their core. These vessels, just like your riggings, can be freely replaced.<br>
All in all, I suppose you could say that I took advantage of a little loophole.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Dr. Anzeel：</span><br>
Wow... Have to hand it to you – well done, Aoste.<br>
I presume Devil back there has gear made from E-Cubes. She must be a lot stronger than the previous generation.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Dr. Aoste：</span><br>
That goes without saying. The last technical obstacle to their mass production will soon be solved, too, once I've finalized my theory.<br>
I can't tell you how close I am, I'm afraid. You'll see for yourself later during our joint experiment.<br>
Oh, forgive me, I never addressed your initial question, Anzeel.<br>
The reason I asked you both to come is that I need your help on this upcoming experiment. There's a risk I want to eliminate at all costs, you see.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Dr. Anzeel：</span><br>
I thought you'd forgotten after you went on that admittedly enlightening tangent.<br>
I will say... If you're actually able to get the Antiochus to the mass-production stage, they will without a doubt define the next era of warfare.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Dr. Aoste：</span><br>
When that day comes, the true nature of their name will be realized.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Dr. Anzeel：</span><br>
Might go from eXperimental to Xenotermination if they'll be fighting aliens. Commander? You look like you have a question.<br>
<br>
Here I am, in a room with the Creator of the shipgirls and the Magister of the Sirens... Am I not one step away from answering the question I've had for so long?<br>
Assuming this world truly is woven from memories and not from fantasy, that is.<br>
<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项1："If a Wisdom Cube is damaged..."</span>'''''<br>
<br>
"Or a shipgirl is born with a defect in her hull data... Is it possible to cure those conditions using this technology?"<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Dr. Anzeel：</span><br>
Wow, THAT came out of left field. I mean, theoretically, it should be possible, but would depend on the nature and quality of the damage.<br>
The Type II fusion-hull process pulls information out from a secondary "mainframe," embodies that information in the form of a rigging, and, as the name implies, fuses it with the original shipgirl's hull data.<br>
The presence of a secondary "backup" Wisdom Cube not only strengthens the existing hull, but also provides a way to bypass certain levels of damage to the primary Wisdom Cube.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Dr. Aoste：</span><br>
Think of it as using a cloned liver to treat someone with renal disease.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Dr. Anzeel：</span><br>
Eww, gross! Although, that is a pretty apt comparison.<br>
For example, take Yorktown, who was given the Essex-class Type II rigging. That managed to postpone the issues we were experiencing with the original Yorktown-class hull.<br>
Unfortunately, this method is only a stopgap measure. It cures the symptoms, not the disease itself.<br>
Just as in the case of humans, backups can fail. Under normal conditions, the sub-Cube will be able to compensate for damages caused to the main Cube.<br>
But if this damage becomes too severe, we likely won't be able to use this trick twice. <br>
Furthermore, it's best not to kick the can down the road too much. Once a Wisdom Cube has been irreparably damaged, even the Type II rigging won't be able to reverse its course.<br>
To truly rid ourselves of these aberrations requires nothing short of a miracle – and an enormous amount of Wisdom Cube resonance.<br>
<br>
"Wait... So with enough Wisdom Cube resonance, there might be a way?"<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Dr. Aoste：</span><br>
Which is a serious drawback compared to my Antiochus. They're only programs inhabiting artificial bodies.<br>
Their bodies and weaponry are expendable and replaceable ad infinitum.<br>
All they need is a functioning mainframe to take control of a new vessel.<br>
And if their mainframe is destroyed, they only need a replacement to reboot the program.<br>
Should an individual program suffer an error, it will be swiftly corrected as long as they're connected to another terminal.<br>
If a program is not connected, its access to key equipment is restricted. Moreover, rogue actors can be swiftly identified and neutralized.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Dr. Anzeel：</span><br>
"Neutralized"... Sheesh, that's extreme.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Dr. Aoste：</span><br>
"Neutralize" is not always a euphemism for "kill," Anzeel. It simply means taking measures to ensure the safety of it and other programs.<br>
Losing connection to the network in and of itself is an error. This expedites search and recovery efforts for programs in danger.<br>
Are you convinced by the Antiochus' potential yet, Commander? I'd love to have you on the project. I could even put you in charge of your very own team.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Dr. Anzeel：</span><br>
Hey! Stop trying to poach MY assistant!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Dr. Aoste：</span><br>
Very well. Then, let's move on to the next order of business – the experiment.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Dr. Anzeel：</span><br>
Sure, but I want to have a few words with you. Can we leave the experiment to my assistant here?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Dr. Aoste：</span><br>
That was my original plan. As I told you before, I won't interfere with the KAN-SEN in any way. Devil will manage things on the Antiochus' end.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Dr. Anzeel：</span><br>
Good. Commander, show us how it's done.<br>
<br>
Soon, Anzeel and Aoste step through a door to the side of the office, heading deeper into the laboratory.<br>
I am left by myself. Unsettling, alien thoughts start to creep into my mind.<br>
It reminds me of what I experienced while talking to Anzeel back at the café.<br>
A strange case of deja vu, as if I wasn't hearing this conversation for the first time.<br>
Aoste did not seem to be responding to my question, but rather addressing his own agenda.<br>
<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项1：(Try to push the sensation out of your mind)</span>'''''<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项2：(Try to follow them through the door.)</span>'''''<br>
<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项1）</span>'''''...But, I can't dwell on that right now.<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项1）</span>'''''The experiment is about to begin. They're all waiting for me.<br>
<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项2）</span>'''''I place my hand on the door at the back end of the office and push.<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项2）</span>'''''It doesn't open. It refuses to open. It doesn't seem like it can open, as if my mind recognizes it as a wall instead of a door.<br>

'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项2）</span>'''''Yes, it was when I entered the Reality Lens. There was the AI that called itself "Recorder."<br>

<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项2）</span>'''''I reach for the door again, but Memphis's voice snaps me to my senses.<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项2）</span>'''''...Something tells me that she's here to stop me.<br>

<br>
[Reality Lens Replicated Space] [Location: Sea near Samos Island] [Cognitive merging data unknown]<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">The Devil XV：</span><br>
So, before we get this thing started, a quick self-introduction.<br>
My model ID is The Devil XV, but you can just call me Devil.<br>
I'm a second-generation Antiochus specializing in battlefield support. Frankly, taking head-on fights isn't my forte.<br>
The purpose of today's experiment is to gauge how Antiochus and KAN-SEN fight both against and alongside each other. Mostly the latter.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Hornet II：</span><br>
In other words, we do some target practice first, then we shoot at each other?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">The Devil XV：</span><br>
Yep. Thanks for summarizing that for me.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Yorktown II：</span><br>
Are there any other Antiochus coming? Surely you don't mean it's all of us against you alone...?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">The Devil XV：</span><br>
I've got mass-produced weapons on my side, but apart from them, I'm the only second-generation vessel.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Hornet II：</span><br>
Guess we'll have to hold back. We don't wanna damage Dr. Aoste's beloved vessel.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">The Devil XV：</span><br>
Oh, don't worry; nobody wants you to take it easy on me. This is a test of my combat abilities, so give me everything you've got.<br>
I sent you data on the test plan as well as the specs of my vessel and weapons, so give it a peek if you want.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Hornet II：</span><br>
Ooh, let's see... Huh? Why isn't my communicator working?<br>
It's, like, overloaded or something... Northampton, can I have some space?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Northampton II：</span><br>
Is it that much data? Okay, I've given you storage permissions.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Langley II：</span><br>
Goodness... I'm not exaggerating when I say that this is an enormous amount of data.<br>
I only glanced at the data headers, but it does indeed seem to be a detailed specification of Devil's vessel.<br>
No offense, but it seems a little difficult to estimate your strength on the spot with this...<br>
There isn't much reason for us to know every little detail about you, either.<br>
We're just helping with the experiment anyway, and knowing too much might unduly influence the results.<br>
As for the drill plan – I consider it more of a drill than an experiment... Ah, there it is. Likewise, it's totally unreadable.<br>
The file's pretty big, sure, but this isn't an amount of data that should be exceeding your storage. Northampton and I didn't have a problem with it.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Hornet II：</span><br>
Huh, wonder what the problem is then. Maybe I downloaded too many of those movies Shangri-La recommended to me.<br>
I mean, we're on Dr. Anzeel's network. Might as well use her bandwidth while we still can!<br>
Look, I didn't even pirate them! Aren't you proud of me?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Northampton II：</span><br>
......<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Langley II：</span><br>
......<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Yorktown II：</span><br>
Excuse me, Commander? Can we strike that from the record? If Dr. Anzeel hears...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Hammann II：</span><br>
Y-Yorktown! Help me make sense of this data!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Hornet II：</span><br>
Y-your guess is as good as mine! I can't make heads or tails of it, ahaha...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Yorktown II：</span><br>
Oh? Langley, would you mind explaining it to them?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Langley II：</span><br>
*sigh*... Fine. First, the positions of the weapons on Devil's vessel.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Hammann II：</span><br>
......<br>
Nnngh...<br>
Grrrgh...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Hornet II：</span><br>
I can't understand a word Langley's saying...<br>
Hammann, are you okay? There's steam coming out of your ears!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Hammann II：</span><br>
Ueergh... Bwuh?! What were we talking about?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Langley II：</span><br>
This is where we were in the lesson. Do you have any questions so far?<br>
<br>
"Langley, I think your teaching methods might not be well-suited to Hammann's learning style."<br>
"We're not in a lecture hall right now, so try using a more appropriate method."<br>
"For example, learning by demonstration."<br>
"Devil, since you're on our side for now, we can have you help with this."<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">The Devil XV：</span><br>
Want me to show off how my combat support drones work? Sure. I'll launch one now.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Hammann II：</span><br>
Whoa! My rigging is running so much smoother now! Is this because of Devil's drone?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Hornet II：</span><br>
It's not just smoother. I feel lighter, too... What in the world is that ability?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Langley II：</span><br>
I just explained that. Devil uses her drones' discrete support modules to adjust the output of each rigging within range and augment their capabilities.<br>
Each additional support increases these capabilities proportionately. As such...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Hammann II：</span><br>
Well, uh, I sure feel strong enough to do just about anything!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Hornet II：</span><br>
O-oh, nooo, Hamman. You can't go over theeere! I'd better go bring her back!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Langley II：</span><br>
I wasn't done...<br>
<br>
"Don't worry about it, Langley. You did a good job."<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Langley II：</span><br>
Well, thank you for the help... You're still a much better teacher than me, Commander.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Yorktown II：</span><br>
D-don't be so down. I listened the whole time!<br>
Anyway, it's about time we get started. Commander, shall we begin upon their return?<br>
<br>
"Any more talk of data won't help much if they don't actually learn anything from it."<br>
"I think everyone's ready for a proper demonstration. Let's experience her power for ourselves."<br>

<span style="color:#4eb24e;">The Devil XV：</span><br>
Everybody, the target ship is in position. It's right over there.<br>
<br>
A small warship slowly comes into view from the distance.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Yorktown II：</span><br>
Is that ship... some kind of hologram?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">The Devil XV：</span><br>
Nope. It's a mass-produced ship I released into this testing area.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Yorktown II：</span><br>
You released it...? I didn't see anything on the radar.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">The Devil XV：</span><br>
Of course you didn't! It wasn't even here until I released it.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Yorktown II：</span><br>
It wasn't here? Does that mean you brought it from somewhere else?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">The Devil XV：</span><br>
That's right. More precisely, I assembled it on the spot.<br>
I keep the component parts in a manufacturing plant I manage, so I had its construction begin when we entered this area.<br>
Once it was done, I transferred the ship here through my rigging, allowing me to deploy it in a place of my choosing.<br>
It used to take around four days to make a mass-produced ship, but our technology allows me to shorten that to roughly forty minutes.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Yorktown II：</span><br>
In other words, as long as you have enough materials on hand...<br>
You can basically serve as a frontline shipyard and single-handedly provide a near-endless amount of reinforcements...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Langley II：</span><br>
This kind of technology will forever change the way battles are fought...<br>
<br>
Is that how the Sirens have been materializing out of nowhere...?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Memphis：</span><br>
The way war is fought is always changing. There's nothing new about that.<br>
Just as we shipgirls made traditional warships obsolete, the same may be true for the Antiochus.<br>
Even though this technology is amazing, I don't think people will ever stop exploring new ideas.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Northampton II：</span><br>
Interesting. Really makes me wonder what the future has in store.<br>
So, are you supposed to attack that target now?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">The Devil XV：</span><br>
Yes, but use live ammunition.<br>
First, we'll establish a control to gauge your combat performance without the support of my drones.<br>
I'll set up another target after that, and we will repeat the process except with my support.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Hornet II：</span><br>
Alrighty, let's do this!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">The Devil XV：</span><br>
Unfortunately, carriers will have to be left out of this part of the exercise. While carrier-based aircraft will benefit since they're also part of the rigging, this experiment specifically focuses on shelling performance.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Hornet II：</span><br>
Whoops! You're right. Good luck, the rest of you!<br>
{{折叠面板|内容结束}}

{{折叠面板|标题=Testing Teamwork, Part 2|选项=21|主框=1|样式=primary|展开=是}}
<br>
Later in the exercise...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Northampton II：</span><br>
Target ship confirmed sunk. Shelling test complete.<br>
The upgrades in raw output are quite nice, but the functions that highlight enemy weak points and analyze their current status are even more helpful.<br>
My rigging even seems to have some sort of guided target correction built in.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Hornet II：</span><br>
Like aimbots in a shooting game?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Northampton II：</span><br>
I'm not much of a gamer, but that's probably a fairly good description.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">The Devil XV：</span><br>
Next up is the torpedo exercise. Carriers using torpedo bombers are able to participate, in addition to all torpedo-mounted ships.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Yorktown II：</span><br>
What kind of assistance can your drones provide to torpedo bombers?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">The Devil XV：</span><br>
It can support single-target aiming, add a multi-target function through improved information processing capabilities, increase the precision of line-of-fire predictions...<br>
...Change the travel path of torpedos after they've been launched, and even–<br>
Basically, it draws out more performance than your weapons could on their own.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Yorktown II：</span><br>
Unbelievable... How have you accomplished all this?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">The Devil XV：</span><br>
All I did was bring Dr. Aoste's research to life.<br>
I have many other functionalities, which you are free to experiment with after we begin our exercises.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Hornet II：</span><br>
I can't wait to find out how strong I can get! Commander, just give us the signal when it's time to start!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">The Devil XV：</span><br>
Give me just a minute to deploy the mass-produced weapons you will be facing.<br>
{{折叠面板|内容结束}}

{{折叠面板|标题=The Devil's Enforcers|选项=22|主框=1|样式=primary|展开=是}}
<br>
With the Devil's support, we finish a series of bombing, recon, and electronic warfare tests.<br>
Finally, it is time for us to face each other in a head-on test.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Hornet II：</span><br>
Man, I thought we'd be here all day, but those drones made things a piece of cake!<br>
Despite your name, you're a real angel when it comes to buffing us up!<br>
Lemme tell you, if I ever find myself on the battlefield, I'd want you behind my back!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">The Devil XV：</span><br>
Sure thing. I don't mind having meatshields like you.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Yorktown II：</span><br>
I just hope... it never comes to that. War never accomplishes anything in the end.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Hornet II：</span><br>
Haha, relax! It's just a bit of friendly banter!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Yorktown II：</span><br>
I understand you're just joking, but that is also our duty as shipgirls.<br>
If war truly was to break out, I would proudly carry out that duty.<br>
<br>
Yorktown's resolve seems to overlap with the memory of the Yorktown I know.<br>
She sounds exactly like her. Even inside this simulation, I'm sure she must be the same person.<br>
"Devil, are you ready to begin?"<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">The Devil XV：</span><br>
Ready whenever you are.<br>
Now, let's see how you fare in an actual battle against me.<br>
Let me remind you that I'm not a frontline fighter. Supporting from the backlines is what I do best.<br>
Having that said, my vessel is no slouch in a direct engagement.<br>
In addition to my arsenal of support drones and defensive weapons, I obviously have the mobility to get out of dangerous situations.<br>
Speaking of those drones, they will be used to strengthen the mass-produced ships to make your job harder.<br>
While I do not hit as hard as my peers on my own, you will find it difficult to approach me.<br>
My win condition is simple – I will isolate you, and pick you off one by one.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Yorktown II：</span><br>
You oversee and coordinate the state of the battle then... Much like the Commander...<br>
But the difference is, you are already isolated to begin with. Once we take out your mass-produced ships, there's nothing to protect you.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Hammann II：</span><br>
That's right! I bet I could take you out single-handedly!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">The Devil XV：</span><br>
Oh yeah? We'll see about that. Remember what I said about mass-produced weapons at the start?<br>
Well... Just take a look around you.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Langley II：</span><br>
What?! Yorktown, look at the radar... We're completely surrounded by unidentifiable signals!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Yorktown II：</span><br>
Are these... also your drones? But, they look humanoid, just like your vessel...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">The Devil XV：</span><br>
They're technically both at once. Unlike me, however, they are not controlled by a mainframe.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Yorktown II：</span><br>
How did you manage to produce that many vessels in such a short period of time?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">The Devil XV：</span><br>
I didn't, actually. My current vessel does not have the ability to mass-produce Enforcers, so I hid them beforehand.<br>
As for why you didn't notice their presence... It's because I hacked into all your electronics before we even began.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Hornet II：</span><br>
When did you... Oh, I bet it was when you transferred all that data to us!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Northampton II：</span><br>
No wonder her communicator acted up... Here I thought she really had downloaded too many movies.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">The Devil XV：</span><br>
Hmph, make sure you take this lesson in electronic warfare to heart. Whoever controls information also controls the flow of battle.<br>
Now, allow me to introduce my little helpers.<br>
Enforcer XV: Temptation. Aircraft carrier. Specialty: using aircraft to harass targets and support allies.<br>
Enforcer XV: Restriction. Battleship. Specialty: blowing targets to bits in head-on engagements.<br>
This is the Antiochus force you'll be fighting. It's our integrated combat systems versus you and your Commander's wits.<br>
Just so you know – this is probably not going to be a very fair fight.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Langley II：</span><br>
Let's see... Enforcers, Enforcers... Found it. Commander, those Antiochus models boast absurd combat effectiveness.<br>
They will make short work of us extremely quickly if we don't take this 100% seriously.<br>
<br>
Against any other Arbiter, our meager forces would likely make any prospect of victory a pipe dream.<br>
But I've fought plenty of Enforcers before. If direct combat is this Arbiter's weakness... then there might still be a chance.<br>
<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项1："There are no challenges we can't overcome."</span>'''''<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Yorktown II：</span><br>
Well said, Commander. Let's give it our all.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">The Devil XV：</span><br>
So, any final questions before we start?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Hornet II：</span><br>
I have one. Two, actually.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">The Devil XV：</span><br>
As long as it won't affect the experiment results, shoot.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Hornet II：</span><br>
Question one: your support drones can't buff us by mistake, can they?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">The Devil XV：</span><br>
Nope. They're calibrated to only empower Antiochus units.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Hornet II：</span><br>
Figures. Question two: are we using live ammunition or blanks?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">The Devil XV：</span><br>
Do you WANT to use live ammunition?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Hornet II：</span><br>
Oh, absolutely not. Dr. Aoste would cry if I kicked your asses AND left you full of holes.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">The Devil XV：</span><br>
You'll be the one crying at the end of this, KAN-SEN.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Hornet II：</span><br>
Big girls don't cry, and I'm bigger than you in more ways than one. I'll show you why I'm worthy of inheriting the title of Grey Ghost!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">The Devil XV：</span><br>
Hahaha! Those are fighting words! This will be interesting!<br>

<br>
Both our fleets arrive at the designated location. The exercise will begin any moment now.<br>
While I look across the water from the deck of my command ship, Yorktown comes over to me.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Yorktown II：</span><br>
Hi, Commander.<br>
<br>
"I know that look. You have something to tell me."<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Yorktown II：</span><br>
Heehee. You read me like an open book.<br>
I wanted to thank you again for all you've done for me.<br>
For the longest time, sorrow formed a chain around my heart...<br>
Then you came into my life. Spending time together with you released my heart from the clutches of grief after so long.<br>
But a while ago, I started getting anxious. I feared that the wonderful moments we shared would come to an end.<br>
You showed me the light. What would happen if I fell back into the darkness? My anxiety grew worse and worse.<br>
You are still just as kind and gentle as you have always been, but...<br>
Something about you feels more distant...<br>
I can't exactly put my finger around it, but... It feels almost tragic.<br>
I'm sorry, Commander. Please forget I brought this up...<br>
It might just be my own doubts and insecurities speaking.<br>
Thank you for always being so kind to me. Sometimes, I feel like that... is the true power behind the Type II rigging.<br>
<br>
No... She's not wrong.<br>
After all, I don't remember what kind of memories the "me" of this world might have shared with this Yorktown.<br>
But despite that, this world has shown me how blissful Yorktown's smile can look.<br>
And surely... there must be something real about that.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Hornet II：</span><br>
Hey, Yorktown~ Commander~<br>
Hate to interrupt, just wanted to say you really should give your present to the Commander after this!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Yorktown II：</span><br>
H-Hornet? How did you...?<br>
Oh no... I forgot to switch off my communicator!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Hornet II：</span><br>
Wheeew~♪ You sure as heck did!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Yorktown II：</span><br>
Don't tell me you heard everything I said...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Hornet II：</span><br>
Wheeew~♪ You sure as heck did!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Yorktown II：</span><br>
Oh... my goodness...<br>
<br>
Yorktown buries her face in her hands, blushing so furiously she seems to be giving off steam.<br>
<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项1："What was that about a present?"</span>'''''<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Yorktown II：</span><br>
P-please ignore that! You know how she can be with her pranks sometimes...<br>
Hornet, you should know better than to say stuff like that before an important exercise!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Memphis：</span><br>
Yorktown... What's done is done...<br>
Nobody else is here. Nobody else can see us. Nothing is going to change...<br>
So, let's just say what we need to say...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Yorktown II：</span><br>
Memphis...? Is something wrong?<br>
Your voice is shaking... Did I say something I shouldn't have?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Memphis：</span><br>
Sorry, I'm a bit worn out. I've just been going through a lot lately...<br>
Once we're done here, I'm gonna get a good night's sleep. I'm sure everything will be fine when I wake up.<br>
Yes, everything... will go back to normal...<br>
<br>
There's no mistaking it. The tone of someone who has given in to despair. I've heard it before.<br>
Without a doubt, she knows that this whole world is a temporary dream. <br>
But, who exactly is she? She doesn't seem to be the same "Memphis" I know.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Hornet II：</span><br>
Ditto. After this is over, I'm taking more than a few days off!<br>
I'm gonna go to the beach, binge-watch movies, and go full Bunker Hill mode and turn my sleep schedule on its head!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Memphis：</span><br>
...Right. That's why we have to finish the work in front of us first.<br>
Commander, radio Devil and tell her we're in position.<br>
<br>
As my finger leaves the communicator, the battle begins.<br>

<br>
Though our battle against Devil is gruelling to say the least, we are standing our ground.<br>
Our carriers' planes weave past the anti-air fire and attack her repeatedly, but accomplish nothing other than create pillars of seawater.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Hornet II：</span><br>
How the hell is she so mobile when she's gotta haul that huge rigging around?!<br>
What kind of power source did Dr. Aoste put into these second-generation Antiochus?!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Yorktown II：</span><br>
It's as if she's using her sheer volume of Energy Cubes to brute force her way into the air.<br>
Our torpedoes can't hit her and our bombers can't lock on to her. That leaves us with only fighters...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Langley II：</span><br>
Yorktown, I still have these jets with experimental anti-air missiles. Do you want to give them a try?<br>
If we can disable that pesky flight system, she'll be an easy target.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Yorktown II：</span><br>
Commander, I'd like to request an aerial feint attack to give me an opportunity to coordinate with the missile fighter jets to strike Devil's power system.<br>
<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项1："Roger. Proceed."</span>'''''<br>
<br>
Missiles aren't exactly foreign to me, but I've only seen them deployed in a very limited capacity by the Dragon Empery.<br>
But here, the technology is robust enough to mount them onto carrier-based aircraft? Surely something that powerful should be able to disable her power system.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Yorktown II：</span><br>
A direct hit! Commander, six of our missiles landed! That should be enough to...<br>
Wait, it still didn't work...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Hornet II：</span><br>
She's still in the air! If anything, she's moving even faster now!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Yorktown II：</span><br>
That doesn't make any sense. The module should've automatically shut down after the dummy warheads hit... Is something wrong with my sensors?<br>
<br>
"Something isn't right here."<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Northampton II：</span><br>
Commander, Enforcer aircraft incoming! I think those missiles pissed them off!<br>
<br>
"Hammann, don't let them hit Yorktown."<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Hammann II：</span><br>
On it! I'll shoot every last one of them down!<br>
<br>
KABOOOM!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Hammann II：</span><br>
Ow! Oww! Those are some hard-hitting blanks...<br>
Wait, no! Those are NOT blanks! Commander, Yorktown, they're using live ammunition!<br>
Stupid Antiochus, breaking the rules once they start losing...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Yorktown II：</span><br>
What?! Langley, are they using live rounds?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Langley II：</span><br>
They are. I sent out planes to intercept theirs, and they went up in smoke. That couldn't happen if they shot blanks!<br>
<br>
...I enlarge the feed from our recon planes and look carefully at Devil.<br>
She no longer looks like the Antiochus vessel we had been speaking to just moments ago. The lust for destruction swirling around her is unmistakable - it is that of a Siren Arbiter.<br>
Even as the shipgirls around me begin to realize the danger they are now in, they remain calm and collected.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Yorktown II：</span><br>
Commander, what should we do now?<br>
<br>
"Swap to live ammunition, and regroup around the command ship."<br>
"Devil doesn't seem to be coming for us for the time being. She is an AI, so we can't exclude the possibility that she's gone rogue due to an error."<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Yorktown II：</span><br>
Understood! Everyone, group up!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Memphis：</span><br>
The exercise can't go on like this. Should I call it off, Commander?<br>
<br>
"You're right. I don't want to risk any damage if it can be avoided. Let's radio Devil."<br>
"We'll need to determine why she suddenly used live ammo against us."<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Memphis：</span><br>
Roger.<br>
Devil, you've violated the rules of the exercise! I order you to immediately disarm and return to the surface.<br>
...She's not responding? Why isn't my override working?<br>
What?! My hacking attempt failed! How? The Arbiters here can't have developed countermeasures already...<br>
<br>
Only Anchorage and I were connected to the Reality Lens when the experiment started...<br>
If "Memphis" was able to connect afterwards, it would be a piece of cake for the far more technologically advanced Arbiters.<br>
Everything starts to fall into place... The Devil was not a product of this virtual space. Rather, this whole place was hosted by the Arbiter.<br>
The fear of death sends an icy chill to my bones. This is no longer a situation any of us can manage.<br>
"Change of plans. Turn around and head for Samos Island at full speed. Put me in touch with Anzeel and Aoste."<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Everyone：</span><br>
Roger!<br>

<br>
[Reality Lens Replicated Space] [Location: Sea near Samos Island] [Cognitive merge: Commander - Arbiter: The Devil XV - ???]<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Hammann II：</span><br>
I've downed another Enforcer!<br>
How'd you like my Type II Edsall-class rigging, you big ol' tin can?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Yorktown II：</span><br>
The Enforcers have much stronger defenses now than before. Be careful, everyone!<br>
Engaging them rashly will only lead to unnecessary casualties!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Langley II：</span><br>
Devil is beelining toward us! She'll be within sight in one minute!<br>
<br>
Our bombers and torpedos failed to get any solid hits on the flying Arbiter, while our fighters couldn't break through the thick plating.<br>
And, our missiles were all dummy warheads...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Memphis：</span><br>
I can't reach Samos Island... The doctors aren't picking up, either!<br>
<br>
"Are our communications being jammed?"<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Memphis：</span><br>
No, our comms systems are running fine. We simply can't reach them.<br>
But it's okay, Commander! I'll think of another way!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Northampton II：</span><br>
Several vessels of unknown affiliation have appeared at close range! Where did they come from?!<br>
<br>
"Enemy reinforcements now, of all times? Could they be Sirens?"<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Northampton II：</span><br>
Our recon planes just sent an image! Wait a second...<br>
What the...? I can't make anything out!<br>
<br>
The image Northampton sent us was full of... them.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Northampton II：</span><br>
Commander, do you know what these enemies are?<br>
<br>
Though the images should've been processed, my eyes are unable to focus on the blurry mass.<br>
Their forms seem to shift within the still images. I see images of a nightmarish, writhing mass engulfing the battlefield.<br>
For some reason, there's a gnawing emptiness in the back of my mind. Where have I seen these enemies before?<br>
The City of Light in the Arcana Sanctum flashes through my mind.<br>
But what happened next? How did we deal with these enemies?<br>
KABOOOM!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Gromky：</span><br>
Oof! These enemies don't mess around!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Murmansk：</span><br>
Yeah, not to mention they're covered in some sort of... weird mist...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Tallinn：</span><br>
They look like Sirens, but there's something very different about these things!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Sovetskaya Belorussiya：</span><br>
If they look like Sirens and come attacking us, then as far as I'm concerned, they might as well be Sirens!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Kirov：</span><br>
Well said! Either way, there's but one thing for us to do: dispatch them!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Sovetskaya Belorussiya：</span><br>
That's the Kirov I know! Hahaha!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Kirov：</span><br>
Right you are! I cannot and will not rest until the revolution has come!<br>
They are neither immune to our cannon fire, nor too fast to hit! We need only keep firing on them until they sink!<br>
Blow them to dust, comrades! Hold the frontline until Comrade Commander and Gremyashchy have evacuated!<br>
<br>
The City of Light, the memories of Anzeel and Aoste, the Long Island Defense Line, Recorder, the end of the battle with this unknown enemy...<br>
Memories start to flood back into my head.<br>
"Please fight until the last light has faded."<br>
<span style="color:#a020f0;">Memphis：</span><br>
...Why? Why have these things appeared here?<br>
Those should have been excluded from the components of this world!<br>
Even if everyone inside this space has awoken, there still shouldn't be any way for them to get inside...!<br>
Does Devil somehow have memories of that battle?!<br>
Or does the Tower? Or the Natural Calculation System itself?<br>
How... What have I done?!<br>
Who could have awakened these memories?!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Yorktown II：</span><br>
Memphis, what's wrong?! Get a hold of yourself!<br>
<span style="color:#a020f0;">Memphis：</span><br>
The memories of that battle... They belong to me...<br>
It's my fault for observing the Commander and Anchorage!<br>
It's my fault for making the Commander flee here!<br>
It's my fault for connecting to the Natural Calculation System!<br>
The Tower already noticed that these memories of ruination were here!<br>
...And that's why I can't control the Reality Lens or access the Natural Calculation System anymore!<br>
There's no escaping this place now!<br>
We can't free the Commander's consciousness!<br>
And if this world is destroyed, the Commander's consciousness will die with it!<br>
I'm sorry, I'm sorry! It's all my fault... I've...<br>
I've doomed... the Commander... *sob*...<br>
What have I done?!<br>
<br>
I silently pull Memphis into a hug.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Yorktown II：</span><br>
Memphis, what are you going on about?!<br>
Nothing you're saying makes any sense! What's going to happen to the Commander?!<br>
<span style="color:#a020f0;">Memphis：</span><br>
I'm sorry... *sob*... I'm sorry!<br>
Commander... I...<br>
<span style="color:#ff9900;">???：</span><br>
Memphis, Commander! It's not over yet!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Yorktown II：</span><br>
Who's there...? And where are you?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Hornet II：</span><br>
That voice... Helena?!<br>
<span style="color:#ff9900;">???：</span><br>
Reality Lens connection confirmed. Removing data lock.<br>
<span style="color:#ff9900;">Helena META：</span><br>
This burden isn't yours alone to bear, Memphis.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Hornet II：</span><br>
Is that really you, Helena? You look so different...<br>
<span style="color:#a020f0;">Memphis META：</span><br>
*sniffle*... Helena...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Yorktown II：</span><br>
Who... are you two?<br>
<span style="color:#ff9900;">Helena META：</span><br>
Explaining would take too long, so maybe another... No. I'll try to make it as brief as I can now.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Yorktown II：</span><br>
I'm listening.<br>
<span style="color:#ff9900;">Helena META：</span><br>
I am Helena, but I am not the Helena you know.<br>
Likewise, she is Memphis, but she is not the Memphis you know.<br>
Like you all, we are loyal to the Commander.<br>
Sorry to keep this introduction so brief, but we're going to do everything in our power to save the Commander.<br>
Is that a satisfactory explanation, Commander?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Yorktown II：</span><br>
Commander, can we trust them?<br>
<br>
"That's an easy one."<br>
<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项1："Of course."</span>'''''<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项2："They're our allies."</span>'''''<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Yorktown II：</span><br>
Okay. If you say so.<br>
<span style="color:#ff9900;">Helena META：</span><br>
Long time no see, Commander.<br>
<br>
"I could tell that Memphis didn't belong to this virtual space."<br>
"But I didn't expect you to be involved as well."<br>
"Then my memories of the Sea of Stars being attacked..."<br>
<span style="color:#ff9900;">Helena META：</span><br>
Mhm. Things went awry when you used the Reality Lens to connect to Anchorage's hull.<br>
Instead, you got connected to the Natural Calculation System – the origin of the Reality Lens – by mistake. That's where you saw those memories of Dr. Anzeel.<br>
Unfortunately, the Arbiter caught wind of this and came after you.<br>
When Dr. Anzeel's failsafe detected this, it erased the entire virtual space, flinging your consciousness into limbo.<br>
<br>
.........<br>
<span style="color:#a020f0;">Recorder：</span><br>
Wait. Something's coming this way.<br>
Whatever it is, it's been following you for a while now.<br>
.........<br>
Warning: Category V threat detected nearby. Commencing removal of AI and records per security protocol.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Anchorage：</span><br>
Teacher!<br>
Hurry... We need to run!<br>
Teacher! This is bad...! Nooo!<br>
<br>
"So, everything began when I saw that aberration within Anchorage's hull data. That's when I got pulled into Memphis's virtual space where the Sea of Stars came under attack."<br>
"Even so, the Arbiter continued to chase me, and she had no choice but to link multiple hulls together to create this megaspace."<br>
"This all culminated in the creation of this entire world from several different memories and minds. Meanwhile, I never woke up at all."<br>
<span style="color:#ff9900;">Helena META：</span><br>
That's why Memphis blamed herself for what happened here. This place is a simulacrum of all the consciousnesses connected to it.<br>
Yours, hers, the Devil's, and even the records buried at the foundation of the Natural Calculation System.<br>
The reason she hosted the virtual space from the Devil's mainframe was to prevent your mind from being contaminated by the aberrations you just saw.<br>
Incidentally, when your consciousness melded with the existing data in the Natural Calculation System, your compassion for your shipgirls provided the last missing piece of data needed for the completion of the Type II rigging.<br>
Memphis superimposed your memories with the existing memories of the Type II rigging, creating a world where these shipgirls would temporarily be freed from their fates.<br>
Our only miscalculation was, the Devil found some way to forcibly connect into this space at the same time.<br>
That was why her vessel went berserk and started attacking us with live ammunition.<br>
And that brings us to the present moment.<br>
<br>
"I'm still extremely confused, but I get the gist of your explanation."<br>
"But there's one question you haven't answered. What does the Tower have to do with all of this?"<br>
<span style="color:#ff9900;">Helena META：</span><br>
Sometimes, Commander, ignorance is bliss.<br>
<br>
"Huh?"<br>
<span style="color:#ff9900;">Helena META：</span><br>
Don't worry about it. What's important is that the situation isn't as bad as Memphis thinks.<br>
The other Helena and I can regain control of this virtual space and extract you from the Reality Lens. To do that though, you'll have to boot out the other intruder.<br>
You know what to do, right? You said it yourself – "Please fight until..."<br>
<br>
"...The last light has faded. And fight I will until everyone's safe."<br>
<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项1："Yorktown, prepare for battle."</span>'''''<br>

<br>
[Reality Lens Replicated Space] [Cognitive merge: Commander - The Devil XV - Framework of Logic - ???]<br>
<span style="color:#ff9900;">Helena META：</span><br>
The Devil's formation is already in place. Under these conditions, don't even bother trying to attack the main vessel.<br>
We'll need to eliminate her "eyes" first – the Temptation-type carriers.<br>
Memphis. Requesting intel support.<br>
<span style="color:#a020f0;">Memphis META：</span><br>
Understood. I've sent information on their location, stats, and weaknesses over the data link.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Langley II：</span><br>
How did you tap directly into our data link?<br>
<span style="color:#a020f0;">Memphis META：</span><br>
That's not important.<br>
Commander, order a synchronized attack on these coordinates. Just as you did with my mass-produced ships in the previous exercise.<br>
<br>
"We know the enemy's weakness. Now..."<br>
<span style="color:#ff9900;">Helena META：</span><br>
Anti-jamming measures and communication network reinforcement. I'm already on it.<br>
<br>
"We've got the META shipgirls' support. Everyone, attack the Antiochus – the Sirens!"<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Yorktown II：</span><br>
Leave it to us, Commander!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Hornet II：</span><br>
Ol' Hornet's ready to get her revenge!<br>
<br>
KABOOOM!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Langley II：</span><br>
Target confirmed sunk! We did it, Commander!<br>
Our aircraft have improved in speed, power, and more. Helena, did you do this?<br>
<span style="color:#ff9900;">Helena META：</span><br>
Of course!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Yorktown II：</span><br>
The Devil is losing altitude! She's about to land in the water!<br>
<span style="color:#ff9900;">Helena META：</span><br>
That means she's getting serious. Being in the air restricts what weapons she can use.<br>
Don't let her Restriction-type battleships distract you. Fighting them is a trap people fall into when they don't know about her tactics.<br>
Without air control, her battleships are nothing more than clubs to be swung around indiscriminately.<br>
Now, let's slip in and strike at her vessel before the Enforcers have time to readjust their formation.<br>
<br>
"I understand the urgency, Helena, but we'll need some time before we can have our second wave of planes fully prepared."<br>
<span style="color:#ff9900;">Helena META：</span><br>
Don't misunderstand me. We're not sending in aircraft – we'll be getting up close and personal ourselves.<br>
I can hack into her system and disable most of her weapons.<br>
I would normally do that remotely, but Helena hasn't gained full control over this virtual space yet.<br>
<br>
While grumbling, Helena META produces a black syringe-like device.<br>
<span style="color:#ff9900;">Helena META：</span><br>
So instead, we're going to go in and stab this into the Devil's heart.<br>
<br>
"I get it. You weren't kidding when you said we need to get up close and personal."<br>
"But this strategy is far too dangerous."<br>
<span style="color:#ff9900;">Helena META：</span><br>
You're right.<br>
We'll have to shake off the Enforcers defending her, avoid the hail of bullets coming from Devil's close-range defenses, and scale her enormous rigging.<br>
It's a lot to ask for... but it's also our only chance.<br>
If the Enforcers manage to regroup, it'll become a battle of attrition. And by that point, we've already lost.<br>
Also, don't forget that she's still a floating manufacturing plant with the ability to call in limitless reinforcements.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Hammann II：</span><br>
So you just need someone with the speed and agility to get in there, right?<br>
That's a piece of cake for me!<br>
Commander, leave it to me! Let me do it!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Northampton II：</span><br>
Allow me to help you. This job is too big for one little Hammann to handle.<br>
I'll do whatever it takes to protect her along the way and deliver her to Devil's heart.<br>
<br>
"...Be careful out there, okay?"<br>
"Memphis, plan a route. Everyone else, shift your attacks to clear a path for Hammann!"<br>

KABOOOM!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Hammann II：</span><br>
You little... Keep trying, and maybe you'll hit me in a hundred years!<br>
<span style="color:#ec5d53;">Arbiter: The Devil XV：</span><br>
Tch.<br>
<br>
KABOOOM!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Northampton II：</span><br>
Nngh! *cough*...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Hammann II：</span><br>
Northampton, are you alright?!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Northampton II：</span><br>
I'm fine! Hammann, focus on your mission!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Hammann II：</span><br>
I know! I've got this!<br>
This is what you get for messing with my friends and the Commander, Antiochus!!<br>
<br>
KABOOOM!<br>
<span style="color:#ec5d53;">Arbiter: The Devil XV：</span><br>
*cough* *cough*... What...?!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Hammann II：</span><br>
It's working! Yorktown, did you see that?!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Yorktown II：</span><br>
Well done, Hammann!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Hammann II：</span><br>
Heheheh! Did you see how awesome I was, Commander?<br>
<span style="color:#ff9900;">Helena META：</span><br>
I'm hacking her now... Done!<br>
I've disconnected Devil's vessel and her Enforcers!<br>
<span style="color:#a020f0;">Memphis META：</span><br>
I can't believe... you really did it...<br>
<span style="color:#ff9900;">Helena META：</span><br>
What, did you doubt the Commander and me?<br>
<span style="color:#a020f0;">Memphis META：</span><br>
I guess not... Pfft, hahaha...<br>
<span style="color:#ff9900;">Helena META：</span><br>
Commander, it's time to focus our fire on the Devil's vessel and destroy it.<br>
With the Arbiter's connection severed, I'll be able to bring the Sea of Stars and the Reality Lens back under our control.<br>
<br>
"So it's finally time to go back home. Yorktown..."<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Yorktown II：</span><br>
It's okay. I know.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Hornet II：</span><br>
It was exciting to get to know each other, but... Turns out we were just being manipulated to put you in danger, huh?<br>
<br>
"The battle isn't over. We're not entirely out of danger yet."<br>
"But Helena is right. We should at least be able to escape from here."<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Hornet II：</span><br>
Wait, what's going on up there? It looks like... the sky's tearing apart?!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Hammann II：</span><br>
Bwah?! What in the world is that??<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Northampton II：</span><br>
Look, some kind of rift is forming in the sky!<br>
<br>
A brilliant blue-white light pours out from the gash above us, splashing across the darkened evening sky.<br>
A mysterious machine reaches through the rift, as if forcibly pushing itself into this world.<br>
<span style="color:#ff9900;">Helena META：</span><br>
Damn it... This entire virtual space is about to get purged...<br>
<br>
"Is that what happens when you forcibly shut down the Reality Lens from the outside?"<br>
<span style="color:#ff9900;">Helena META：</span><br>
No. This is something else...<br>
<br>
Countless rays of light burst from the rift, devouring everything from heaven to earth.<br>
Everything grinds to a halt beneath their radiant glow. The Enforcers, the formless enemies, even the land itself.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Hammann II：</span><br>
Commander! The Devil's stopped moving, too!<br>
Do you think this is a superweapon the doctors developed to help us?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Hornet II：</span><br>
It definitely isn't! Those rays of light are going to swallow us up too!<br>
We have to run––<br>
<br>
Hornet's voice cuts off abruptly. I look down at my battlefield monitor, and her signal is gone.<br>
<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项1："Everyone, run!!"</span>'''''<br>
<br>
But, my voice reaches no one. One by one, their signals disappear. Everything around me collapses faster than my eyes can keep track of.<br>
First Hammann, then Northampton, Hornet, then Langley... The ones furthest from us are the first to go.<br>
<span style="color:#ff9900;">Helena META：</span><br>
Yorktown! Stay close to the Commander!<br>
Forget about the others, it's too late for them!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Yorktown II：</span><br>
Helena? What's happening?<br>
...Hornet? Are you there? Answer me!<br>
Northampton! Do you read me?<br>
Langley! Where have you gone?<br>
Hammann! Please... Please talk to me...<br>
<br>
I hardly recognize my own voice.<br>
All that remains is an eerie, pure-white silence.<br>
<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项1："HELENA!!"</span>'''''<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项2："Helena, what's going on?"</span>'''''<br>
<span style="color:#ff9900;">Helena META：</span><br>
Calm down. Let me explain.<br>
The Devil isn't the only Arbiter connected to this virtual space. The Tower is, too.<br>
Though limited in scope, the Tower has the ability to access the Natural Calculation System.<br>
<br>
"So we basically walked right into her 'home,' and those rays of light are her way of purging intruders?'<br>
<span style="color:#ff9900;">Helena META：</span><br>
Not quite. The rays of light are part of the Reorigination System. More accurately, she's trying to wipe the slate clean altogether.<br>
When I first hacked into the Reality Lens, I made sure that the Tower would not be alerted.<br>
While the Devil theoretically had access to the Reorigination System, she would not have been able to use it without purging herself in the process.<br>
However, now that she has been disconnected and the aberrations are running rampant in this space, there's no way we would continue to avoid the Tower's gaze.<br>
And what do the Sirens do when they encounter a bug in the Natural Calculation System? They eliminate it.<br>
For the Tower, that's just as easy as you stepping on a bug.<br>
<br>
"Isn't there anything you can do to stop her?"<br>
<span style="color:#ff9900;">Helena META：</span><br>
Sadly, no.<br>
The Tower is different from other Arbiters. She is not some kind of program you can hack or a person you can talk to.<br>
Commander, you've been aware this whole time that this world is nothing but a replicated virtual space, right?<br>
No matter how interconnected our lives may be within this world, no matter what experiences we might have, everything in this space is nothing more than an array of data for the Tower.<br>
We are but programs within this data space. When bugs appear in the data or programs malfunction, you go in and fix them.<br>
After all, you wouldn't sit down and try to talk it out with a computer bug, would you?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Yorktown II：</span><br>
Helena... So you're saying that...<br>
I'm just a bunch of data created by this world?<br>
<span style="color:#ff9900;">Helena META：</span><br>
I'm afraid so. To the best of my knowledge, the real Yorktown's hull is not connected to this space.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Yorktown II：</span><br>
What about Hornet, Hammann, and the others?<br>
<span style="color:#ff9900;">Helena META：</span><br>
Same story.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Yorktown II：</span><br>
What about Dr. Anzeel then, and Dr. Aoste?<br>
<span style="color:#ff9900;">Helena META：</span><br>
Same story.<br>
With the exception of me, Memphis, the Commander, and Anchorage, wherever she is... Everything else is a fabrication.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Yorktown II：</span><br>
My feelings... My memories... Are they all fake?<br>
Everything I know... is a lie?<br>
<span style="color:#ff9900;">Helena META：</span><br>
I... I'm sorry. I don't know what to tell you.<br>
<span style="color:#a020f0;">Memphis META：</span><br>
Helena! The Reorigination System is about to catch up to us!<br>
<br>
"Yorktown! Look out––"<br>
<span style="color:#a020f0;">Yorktown META：</span><br>
......<br>
<span style="color:#a020f0;">Yorktown II：</span><br>
Who are you? Where... am I?<br>
Was my data... deleted from the system?<br>
<span style="color:#a020f0;">Yorktown META：</span><br>
No, not quite. Helena took special measures to protect you.<br>
As for who I am, I'm sure you already know.<br>
And I have something to tell you.<br>
<span style="color:#a020f0;">Yorktown II：</span><br>
......<br>
You're me... You're Yorktown.<br>
The Yorktown that holds the future's "memories of ruination," as Memphis mentioned.<br>
And I... am the blessed "Yorktown," given life in this virtual space.<br>
Yes. I remember everything now.<br>
<span style="color:#a020f0;">Yorktown META：</span><br>
That's right. In this virtual space, countless memories and thoughts are woven together, simulated, and given new form.<br>
Sorry for making you suffer this in my place... But, you were never meant to last for long.<br>
<span style="color:#a020f0;">Yorktown II：</span><br>
...It's alright. It's not your fault.<br>
If anything, I am glad I got to experience this fleeting happiness. With my friends, with Dr. Anzeel, and with the Commander...<br>
They will live on in the Commander's memory. The Commander will remember all of us.<br>
Thank you... for telling me.<br>
<span style="color:#a020f0;">Yorktown META：</span><br>
You're right. Even when this world is no more, the Commander will still remember.<br>
I promise you, these memories will help the Commander forge a brighter future.<br>
For Hornet, Northampton, Langley, Hammann... and at least one Yorktown.<br>
As you've yourself shown, happiness finds its way to those who connect with the Commander.<br>
<span style="color:#a020f0;">Yorktown II：</span><br>
...But to ensure that future comes to pass, you have to pull the Commander out of here?<br>
<span style="color:#a020f0;">Yorktown META：</span><br>
Mhm. The Commander has to awaken from this dream.<br>
<span style="color:#a020f0;">Yorktown II：</span><br>
"Fight until the last light has faded"...<br>
Tell me. What can I do to help?<br>
<span style="color:#a020f0;">Yorktown META：</span><br>
Only one thing.<br>
Fight until the waves take you – until your light has faded – so the Commander may be saved.<br>
<span style="color:#a020f0;">Yorktown II：</span><br>
Then that's what I will do. It's what you would want as well.<br>
But is that really all I have to do? Do you know how to save the Commander?<br>
<span style="color:#a020f0;">Yorktown META：</span><br>
Yes. Helena is working hard on it, but she needs more time.<br>
I'm so sorry for sacrificing you like this... I wish I could help...<br>
<span style="color:#a020f0;">Yorktown II：</span><br>
Don't be like that, me. I'm fine with it.<br>
If you really wish to help... then there's one favor you could do for me.<br>
I bought a present for the Commander. Will you deliver it for me?<br>
<span style="color:#a020f0;">Yorktown META：</span><br>
I will. I swear it.<br>
<span style="color:#a020f0;">Yorktown II：</span><br>
Then thank you, and goodbye, other me. My final battle awaits.<br>
<br>
In the midst of all-consuming light, Yorktown begins to move again as enemies close in on us.<br>
<span style="color:#a020f0;">Yorktown II：</span><br>
Don't worry, Commander. I'm just fine.<br>
Thanks to Helena and the Type II rigging you gave me, I'm able to move a little now.<br>
<span style="color:#ff9900;">Helena META：</span><br>
You met her, didn't you? The other you.<br>
<span style="color:#a020f0;">Yorktown II：</span><br>
Helena, how's the progress on your end?<br>
<span style="color:#ff9900;">Helena META：</span><br>
Everything's on track. I've linked up with the Helena on the other side and have secured an escape route.<br>
Memphis will lead the way. Yorktown, you and I will keep the enemies from pursuing.<br>
<span style="color:#a020f0;">Yorktown II：</span><br>
Heehee, did you hear that? It's time to go home, Commander.<br>
<br>
"Doesn't that mean you—"<br>
<span style="color:#a020f0;">Yorktown II：</span><br>
Didn't I tell you not to worry?<br>
There's still time before the reset gets me. Besides, Helena is here with me too.<br>
We won't let the enemy pass. Not until you've made it home.<br>
"Fight until the last light has faded," right?<br>
<br>
"But..."<br>
<span style="color:#a020f0;">Yorktown II：</span><br>
It's okay. Don't say a word.<br>
The Yorktown you desire has the strength to see this through. Please... Honor my decision.<br>
<br>
......<br>
<span style="color:#ff9900;">Helena META：</span><br>
The entrance to the Marine Research Institute on Samos Island. That is your escape route.<br>
Hurry, Commander.<br>
<span style="color:#a020f0;">Memphis META：</span><br>
Yeah. I'm gonna go fast, so make sure you keep up.<br>
<span style="color:#a020f0;">Yorktown II：</span><br>
Farewell, dear Commander. I hope we'll meet again—as the Yorktown you desire.<br>
<br>
...............<br>
The sounds of roaring engines and thundering cannons gradually dwindle.<br>
We press on, never looking back even as the virtual space crumbles around us.<br>
The memory of her angelic figure still lingers in my mind.<br>
As light surrounds me, I make a vow–<br>
To forever engrave her into my heart.<br>

[Reality Lens Replicated Space] [Cognitive merge: Commander - The Devil XV - Framework of Logic - ???]<br>
<span style="color:#a020f0;">Memphis META：</span><br>
The extraction point is just ahead, Commander. Just keep following this path and you'll be out.<br>
<br>
"What will you do, Memphis?"<br>
<span style="color:#a020f0;">Memphis META：</span><br>
I'm going back to help Helena. Need to cover your retreat, after all.<br>
Don't worry about me. We have our own way of getting out.<br>
Hurry and go. You'll be in danger if you stay here long.<br>
<br>
Memphis pushes me into the passage leading underground.<br>
<span style="color:#a020f0;">Memphis META：</span><br>
...I'm sorry. I won't let this happen ever again.<br>
<br>
Ring, ring. The delicate tinkling of wind chimes.<br>
I again find myself weightless, just like when I first entered the Reality Lens.<br>
But this time, a wave of relief washes over me. I had overcome the crisis.<br>
But when I look around, I seem to be inside another virtual space.<br>
It looks like the inside of Dr. Aoste's research facility on Samos Island, but a few things seem different about it.<br>
<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项1："Doctor...?"</span>'''''<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Dr. Anzeel：</span><br>
Daydreaming again? Hellooo, Commander?<br>
<br>
"Where am I? And... I guess Laffey is here, too?"<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Laffey II：</span><br>
Yep. That's me, Commander. Poke, poke.<br>
<br>
Another virtual space made from the data left over in the Natural Calculation System?<br>
"Er, Laffey? Why are you in that gear...?"<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Dr. Anzeel：</span><br>
Are you losing your mind, or are you just half-asleep?<br>
Bah, whatever. You're always weird like that.<br>
Let's take it from the top. You and I are visiting Aoste. Laffey tagged along, and she's wearing your Type II rigging prototype.<br>
We're here to test the Type II rigging and take a look at his new Antiochus.<br>
Got it?<br>
<br>
Nobody should be connected to this space but me. Which means...<br>
Is this a recorded world being shown to me by that Recorder AI?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Anzeel：</span><br>
So anyway, how do you like this?<br>
<br>
Anzeel shows me a photo of Laffey together with another sleepy-looking white-haired girl.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Anzeel：</span><br>
This one's kind of a cutie, right?<br>
<br>
I know that girl. She was a high-ranking Siren named Compiler.<br>
"Everything in this facility is absolutely top secret."<br>
"Any pictures you take will be deleted on the way out."<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Anzeel：</span><br>
Dammit, I forgot!<br>
Aww... Wait, I've got it!<br>
I'll just send these pics to Aoste before they get deleted...<br>
Then after we've left, I'll ask Aoste to send them to me, citing communication between project members. I'm a genius!<br>
<br>
I try repeating the same words Memphis had said. Anzeel replies the same way as before.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Aoste：</span><br>
Anzeel and Commander? Did I happen to hear my name?<br>
This is the latest vessel for the brand-new Antiochus model. What do you think?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Anzeel：</span><br>
Aoste is acting a lot more normal than usual... Commander, it must be because you brought Laffey along.<br>
<br>
"Come to think of it, all the first-generation Sirens do have white hair."<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Anzeel：</span><br>
I knew it! So that was Dr. Aoste's fetish all along~<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Aoste：</span><br>
Nonsense, you two! This is still a work-in-progress. What's wrong with referencing an existing prototype?<br>
By the way, I think I'm going to call her "Compiler."<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Anzeel：</span><br>
I still think your naming scheme is kind of lame.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Aoste：</span><br>
...Can't you at least pretend to show some excitement when I'm making a big announcement here?<br>
<br>
There's that wind chime again.<br>
Suddenly, everything around me stops, and my vision is flooded with blocks of random colors.<br>
"What now...?"<br>
Try as I might, I cannot move much at all. <br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Memphis：</span><br>
...The Comma... has not regained consciou...<br>
...Commande... can you hear me?<br>
<br>
Before my mind finally succumbs to the darkness, I hear Memphis calling for me.<br>
"I'm recalling those planes."<br>
"Scrub the mission. Get those planes back!"<br>
"This is Captain Richard. Now, hear this."<br>
"We've been through it once. We're going through it again."<br>
"Prepare for approaching storm!"<br>

<br>
Beep... Beep... Beep...<br>
(Things don't feel off like they do inside the Reality Lens. I must be back in the Sea of Stars.)<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Memphis：</span><br>
Commander?! Thank goodness... You're finally awake!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Vestal：</span><br>
Vital check complete. The Commander's mind and body seem to be in perfect shape.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Helena：</span><br>
Oh, this is wonderful news... Welcome home, Commander.<br>
<br>
...............<br>
<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项1："It's good to be back."</span>'''''<br>
<br>
(It feels like I just had the longest dream.)<br>
(But I remember everything clearly, as if it happened in reality.)<br>
(Still, there's someone I'm more worried about than myself.)<br>
<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项1："How's Anchorage doing?"</span>'''''<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Memphis：</span><br>
She's fine. She woke up before you, and is doing perfectly fine.<br>
The aberrant data in her hull is all gone now too.<br>
But seriously, when are you going to worry about yourself before you worry about other people?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Vestal：</span><br>
A lot has happened here while you were in the Reality Lens, Commander.<br>
Someone gave Helena the access code to the Sea of Stars, allowing us to halt the Reality Lens.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Memphis：</span><br>
That's what allowed us to save you. So... Helena, would you like to explain?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Helena：</span><br>
Umm...<br>
<br>
"It was the other Helena, right? Helena META told you?"<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Helena：</span><br>
Y-yes, Commander! How did you know that?<br>
<br>
"Let's just say, a lot has happened to me, too."<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Memphis：</span><br>
Is she one of the META shipgirls you met alongside New Jersey?<br>
<br>
"Like I said, a lot has happened."<br>
"We can talk more about it later."<br>
"TB, are you there?"<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">TB：</span><br>
I am here.<br>
<br>
"Does the name Zero sound familiar to you?"<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">TB：</span><br>
Query received. Searching data.<br>
5,320,000,000 results found. I suggest narrowing down your search.<br>
<br>
"Can you narrow it down to individuals you personally know?"<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">TB：</span><br>
Query received. Searching data.<br>
No results found. No individual with those features exists in my records.<br>
<br>
"I guess it couldn't be that easy..."<br>
"One more question. I think this one's something a bit more manageable."<br>
"TB, do you have any logs or data concerning my time in the Reality Lens?"<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">TB：</span><br>
Due to data overflows that occurred during the experiment, searching and analyzing the logs would be time-consuming at this point.<br>
Once I have organized the data in question, I can begin analysis.<br>
<br>
"Is there anything on... Type II rigging?"<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">TB：</span><br>
Query received. Searching data.<br>
Found analyzed data regarding Type II rigging.<br>
The data is broken up into five blocks based on the current naming schemes: Yorktown, Hornet, Langley, Northampton, and Hammann.<br>
<br>
"Anything on Laffey?"<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">TB：</span><br>
No data exists on Type II rigging concerning Laffey. Would you like me to conduct another search?<br>
<br>
(Unlike the others, I only interacted with her for a moment. It made sense that there would be no data on her.)<br>
(But that's no problem. With this data...)<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Memphis：</span><br>
Commander... What's a Type II rigging?<br>
<br>
...............<br>
<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项1："It's a way of integrating a separate mainframe..."</span>'''''<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项2："It's a way of reinforcing hull data..."</span>'''''<br>
<br>
"Anyway, we need to call Saratoga and have her come to the Sea of Stars ASAP."<br>
"We're going to save Yorktown and Lexington."<br>

Have you confirmed Master's safety?<br>
...I am overjoyed to hear that Master is safe. Still in the Sea of Stars, I presume?<br>
But? But what?<br>
You won't divulge the location of the Sea of Stars?<br>
That is a shame. I will inform Her Majesty.<br>
It seems all we know is that the snowy scenery will be beautiful.<br>
I can only hope that the Eagle Union won't try to do anything untoward...<br>
Understood. I await further reports.<br>
<br>
Another red string hung on the map on the wall, connecting two of the thumbtacks littering its surface.<br>
Rumors and records swirled in a complex vortex on the map, betraying signs of a new danger.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Belfast：</span><br>
I hope our information exchange with the Eagle Union can bear some fruit...<br>
Her Majesty was right. A storm is brewing.<br>

You're in high spirits, Eugen.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Prinz Eugen：</span><br>
Of course I am! Hehe, do you know what this is?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Z2：</span><br>
Would this be... information on the blueprint shipgirls of other fleets?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Prinz Eugen：</span><br>
That's right! You can't imagine the effort it took to put all of this together.<br>
All that remains is the Dragon Empery... It's such a shame that Harbin didn't bother attending the World Expo.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Z2：</span><br>
One would imagine that they didn't allow her to come, lest a certain snoop gets too close to her.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Prinz Eugen：</span><br>
Don't be so mean~ Especially after I brought our cutting-edge Prinz Rupprecht here.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Z2：</span><br>
You're clearly trying to show her off. Hah, quite unlike the Empery.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Prinz Eugen：</span><br>
Now, now~ So, how is Ulrich doing?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Z2：</span><br>
So far, so good.<br>
I bring news, as well. The Empery's delegation will depart tomorrow.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Prinz Eugen：</span><br>
Tomorrow?! What's the rush?<br>
The Commander isn't even here yet... Did they catch wind of something?<br>
Z2, do the Empery girls have plans tonight? Are they meeting with another fleet, or anything?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Z2：</span><br>
I wouldn't know. But if they plan to depart tomorrow, I see no reason for them to make plans for the night before?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Prinz Eugen：</span><br>
Good! Let's make plans with them. Dinner, a party, whatever it takes—just get them into our pavilion.<br>

...I see. A one-in-a-million escape.<br>
Things are just fine on my end. Don't fuss over me.<br>
I have to sympathize with poor Vestal.<br>
Musashi is coming. I'll call you back.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Musashi：</span><br>
You do so enjoy the company of your little birds, don't you?<br>
<span style="color:#a020f0;">Jintsuu META：</span><br>
Apologies. I tend to get a little distracted when it's this nice out.<br>
Musashi... To what do I owe the pleasure?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Musashi：</span><br>
I purchased an omikuji fortune on a whim.<br>
<span style="color:#a020f0;">Jintsuu META：</span><br>
A fortune? Is there some reason for that?<br>

Le Terrible, you nominated Jeanne as an Expo representative to keep her away from us, didn't you?<br>
Do you mean to propose a strategy that does not involve her?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Le Terrible：</span><br>
I wouldn't go that far, Cardinal. I simply believed this would be too much for her pious ears to take.<br>
Politics are like poison to the pious. They have a way of eroding one's faith.<br>
Cardinal, are you aware that the Iris Orthodoxy's Basilica is not only in this southern continent?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Richelieu：</span><br>

<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Richelieu：</span><br>
Any updates regarding the Tribunal?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Le Terrible：</span><br>
In terms of power dynamics, there have been no particular changes as of yet.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Richelieu：</span><br>
Are the two of you still in contact?<br>

I wonder. She only seems to remember about me when it suits her.<br>

{{折叠面板|标题=Richard the Riddler!|选项=34|主框=1|样式=primary|展开=是}}
<span style="color:#ffd000;">Bon Homme Richard：</span><br>
Hello there! Yes, you, the one watching this video!<br>
Before we meet, how about we get to know each other a little?<br>
For example... Do you like riddles?<br>
"Behold, His Majesty's castle and home!"<br>
"From his window, one sees his all-piercing eyes!"<br>
"Below him are six faithful generals!"<br>
"Above him, countless soldiers stick to the castle walls!"<br>
Here's a hint: it's a marine biology riddle! Think you can guess it?<br>
Let's begin the countdown...<br>
Zero! Hahahahaha!<br>
The answer is... a hermit crab!<br>
His castle is the shell on his back!<br>
Hermit crabs will use basically anything, from real shells to humans' litter!<br>
His six faithful generals are his two claws and four outside legs!<br>
He uses those to move around and catch prey!<br>
But don't be fooled. Like other crabs, hermit crabs have four more legs; they're just on the inside!<br>
The soldiers stuck to the castle walls are the sea anemones that have a symbiotic relationship with the crab.<br>
They might look like plants, but they're actually carnivorous animals!<br>
But they're really slow, on account of their total lack of bones.<br>
Working together with the hermit crab lets them move much further, and they get to eat his scraps, too!<br>
In return for carrying them, the sea anemones use their venomous tentacles to fight off the crab's natural enemies!<br>
They're just like soldiers protecting their king, right?<br>
They're smart, they can work together, they know how to use their advantages and cover for disadvantages. Hermit crabs are awesome!<br>
That's why they're used as a motif for the high-ranking Arbiters! Ahahahaha!<br>
Well, goodbye! See you soon!<br>
