Lunar New Year Celebration<br>
<br>
Chapter 1 - Preparations for the Wonderful New Year!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">{namecode:67}：</span><br>
Phew... I'm finally back...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">{namecode:98}：</span><br>
Welcome back, nya! You've got a big catch today, nya...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">{namecode:67}：</span><br>
Big catch, huh? If memory serves me properly, we were supposed to do some New Year's shopping... Right, Akashi?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">{namecode:98}：</span><br>
Nya! ... I stumbled upon some nice things and, uh, well... No harm, no foul, right? Consider it a "business opportunity," nya!<br>
And besides, I'm sure Commander and the others will appreciate this stuff, nya!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">{namecode:67}：</span><br>
Hey Akashi, where do you think you're running off to? Put those parts down and come help out.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">{namecode:98}：</span><br>
Nya... Akashi wanted to go sleep in Commander's lap, nya~<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">{namecode:93}：</span><br>
Hm, Atago and Akashi, you're back? How did shopping go?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">{namecode:98}：</span><br>
Nya! It's Souryuu, nya!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">{namecode:67}：</span><br>
Indeed. We're done with the New Year's shopping, but a certain cat decided to buy a lot of stuff that wasn't on the list. Hehe...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">{namecode:93}：</span><br>
Great. After you're done organizing, we need to get ready for Spring Cleaning. We'll have to call everyone to help.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">{namecode:67}：</span><br>
Souryuu, you sure are something else. As expected of Commander's right hand.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">{namecode:93}：</span><br>
I-I just do what needs to be done, that is all...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">{namecode:98}：</span><br>
Akashi is Commander's other right hand, nya!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">{namecode:67}：</span><br>
Two right hands? Is Commander a Stand user...? Well, Akashi, if you're going to be a "right hand," you'll have to act like one and help me move all this stuff~<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">{namecode:98}：</span><br>
Fine, nya...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">{namecode:93}：</span><br>
Ah, shall I lend a hand as well?<br>

Lunar New Year Celebration<br>
<br>
Chapter 2 - The Great Spring "Cleaning!"<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">{namecode:93}：</span><br>
Ahem! This year's Great Spring Cleaning is about to commence!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Sakura Members：</span><br>
Ohhhh!!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">{namecode:16}：</span><br>
Vroooom!! I'm gonna clean this stuff up in a flash like a gale cutting through fallen leaves!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">{namecode:34}：</span><br>
Hawawawa! The place I just cleaned... it's all messy again...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">{namecode:92}：</span><br>
Unlike on the battlefield, that kind of "cleaning up" only generates more headaches...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">{namecode:91}：</span><br>
Ahaha... I seemed to have lapsed in my vigilance, but I will have to pay extra attention during this festival... to "clean up" all the pests from Commander's port...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">{namecode:92}：</span><br>
Sister, today's cleaning is the ordinary kind. Please try to contain your urges a bit...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">{namecode:91}：</span><br>
Worry not, Kaga. I would never cause any unnecessary trouble. Unless, of course, those pests start clinging to Commander...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">{namecode:93}：</span><br>
I seem to have overheard something rather perverse...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Prinz Eugen：</span><br>
Oh my, it seems like there's something interesting going on here.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">{namecode:92}：</span><br>
Hm? You're the Iron Blood's....<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">{namecode:93}：</span><br>
Ah, it's Eugen. Good day. We're currently in the middle of the Sakura Empire's annual Great Spring Cleaning.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Prinz Eugen：</span><br>
"Great Spring Cleaning," huh? By the way, I saw Commander with some girl just now...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">{namecode:91}：</span><br>
Wh-what...?! So there needs to be some thorough "cleaning" after all... Ahhhhh, Commander, wait for me! Akagi is rushing to your side!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">{namecode:93}&{namecode:92}：</span><br>
……<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Prinz Eugen：</span><br>
As expected, this form of "cleaning" is much more entertaining. Hehe...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">{namecode:92}：</span><br>
Masterminding a ploy to divert Akagi's destructive power just like that... the Iron Blood isn't to be underestimated.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">{namecode:93}：</span><br>
Hardly. Akagi is just an open book when it comes to the commander.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">{namecode:67}：</span><br>
Jeez, there's still so much cleaning to do, and Akagi ran off just like that?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Prinz Eugen：</span><br>
In that case, why don't I help out?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">{namecode:93}：</span><br>
Eh? Are you sure?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Prinz Eugen：</span><br>
Hehe~ Let's just say I'm a bit intrigued by the your "New Year."<br>

Lunar New Year Celebration<br>
<br>
Chapter 3 - Reach Toward the Unknown<br>
Several days prior...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Prinz Eugen：</span><br>
Looks like another year is drawing to an end...<br>
I'll probably spend the end of this year eating dinner alone just like everyone else... It feels a bit inane...<br>
Hm? Isn't that the Sakura Fleet's...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">{namecode:98}：</span><br>
Nya! It's Eugen! What's the matter? You look kind of down, nya.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Prinz Eugen：</span><br>
You're Akashi, from that shop, right? How's everything been? You seem rather busy.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">{namecode:98}：</span><br>
Everyone in the Sakura Fleet is getting ready for the New Year! It's actually an extremely busy time, nya! Business is suffering as a result, nya...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Prinz Eugen：</span><br>
Hmmm~? Tell me about this Sakura's "New Year." What kind of preparations are you doing?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">{namecode:98}：</span><br>
There's way too much to do, nya! For the Sakura Empire, the New Year is a very important holiday, nya!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Prinz Eugen：</span><br>
I see. That sounds a bit interesting.<br>
<br>
Present - Sakura Dormitory<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">{namecode:93}：</span><br>
If you want to help out, then let's start by having you set the decorations. All these are for New Year's day, so we need to get it done today. It looks a bit sparse here...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Prinz Eugen：</span><br>
Got it. What are these bamboo-like things?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">{namecode:93}：</span><br>
These are called "kadomatsu," or gate pines. They come in pairs and should be placed to the sides of the door. They represent prosperity and longevity and are said to welcome home ancestral spirits.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Prinz Eugen：</span><br>
They certainly stand out when placed around the door like this... So, what's this straw-like decoration? It looks pretty cool.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">{namecode:93}：</span><br>
Ah, how should I say this... it is used to mark a sacred site so that the visiting spirits won't leave. They are placed in entrances, so you can hang it in the doorway or on windows. Oh, and in the kitchen too.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Prinz Eugen：</span><br>
It seems that the Sakura Empire likes things... high-strung.<br>
Can I eat this white biscuit thing?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">{namecode:98}：</span><br>
That is called "kagami mochi," or mirror rice cake, nya! It is food, but you can't eat it just yet, nya... You'll have to make offerings first, and wait until after the New Year to eat it, nya.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Prinz Eugen：</span><br>
What? These things are sitting here begging to be eaten and you're telling me to wait?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">{namecode:98}：</span><br>
Be patient, nya! After the New Year, you can eat and drink to your heart's content, nya!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Prinz Eugen：</span><br>
A party to celebrate the passing of the year... Hmm, can I come to that as well?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">{namecode:98}：</span><br>
Everyone in this base is a friend, so anyone is welcome, nya~<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Prinz Eugen：</span><br>
Ehehe... I'm looking forward to it then... I hear Sakura's liquor is like ambrosia. <br>

Lunar New Year Celebration<br>
<br>
Chapter 4 - Friendship, Hard Work, and Victory!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Z23：</span><br>
Huh? I didn't expect the whole gang to show up.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Javelin：</span><br>
That's right~ when I received Ayaya's invitation, I was wondering if I'd run into all of you!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Laffey：</span><br>
Uhh... hnn...?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Javelin：</span><br>
Laffey seems sleep-deprived as usual... Ah, the New Year is almost here! C'mon, get your excited face on! New Year~!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Laffey：</span><br>
Mm... I... am full of... excitement...?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Z23：</span><br>
Ahaha... you two never change.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Javelin：</span><br>
I sure didn't expect Ayaya to invite us though~<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Z23：</span><br>
Even though she doesn't talk a lot, she's actually quite fond of everyone.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Javelin：</span><br>
Ehehe~ she's so cute~<br>
(knocks on the door) Ayanami~ We're here~<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Z23：</span><br>
Seems like... nobody's here...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Laffey：</span><br>
Did Ayanami... oversleep...?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Z23：</span><br>
Laffey, you shouldn't project onto Ayanami... Probably.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">{namecode:6}：</span><br>
Ayanami is here, yes...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Z23：</span><br>
Woooahhh! Ayayanami?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Javelin：</span><br>
Wahaha~! Zed's face just now! "Ayayanami!" Ahahaha!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Z23：</span><br>
Ugh... Why did you suddenly pop out from behind...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">{namecode:6}：</span><br>
I went to Houshou's place... to pick up something I had asked for...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Javelin：</span><br>
I see, that stuff you're carrying right now... is it an outfit?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">{namecode:6}：</span><br>
I asked Houshou to make a set for everyone... but there wasn't enough time this year... so there's just one...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Javelin：</span><br>
Just one...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Z23：</span><br>
Just one, huh?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Laffey：</span><br>
Ayanami... what's this tasty-looking round thing?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Javelin：</span><br>
Stop right there, Laffey! Z23, Ayanami, restrain her~<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">{namecode:6} & Z23：</span><br>
On it!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Laffey：</span><br>
Eh....? Ah... wait-<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Javelin：</span><br>
Ehehehe~ Just relax, it'll be fine~<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">{namecode:6}：</span><br>
Laffey's skin... so smooth...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Laffey：</span><br>
Cold... Itchy...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Z23：</span><br>
Keep it PG-13, you two... Well, whatever...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Javelin：</span><br>
Transformation complete~! Laffey, what do you think?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Laffey：</span><br>
Feels weird... the waist is a bit too high... and it's too tight. The sleeves are too breezy... and I'm getting cold...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">{namecode:6}：</span><br>
But, it's cute...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Z23：</span><br>
It really suits you though! I'm a little jealous (whispers)... A-ahem!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Javelin：</span><br>
Ahh, how nice~ I want a cute outfit like Laffey's as well~<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">{namecode:6}：</span><br>
Next time... I will have outfits for everyone...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Laffey：</span><br>
Mm... everyone, together...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Z23：</span><br>
Mhm! I'll be looking forward to it!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Javelin：</span><br>
Now, since everyone is here and all dressed up, let's go to the party!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">{namecode:6}：</span><br>
Yes... but first, it's time to appreciate some good anime...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Everyone：</span><br>

Lunar New Year Celebration<br>
<br>
Chapter 5 - New Year's Cards<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">{namecode:34}：</span><br>
Big sister Souryuu, what are you doing?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">{namecode:93}：</span><br>
Ah, Kisaragi. I'm writing New Year's cards for everyone.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">{namecode:34}：</span><br>
New Year's cards?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">{namecode:93}：</span><br>
They're for sending regards to your friends. You can also write a bit about what's going on in life, that kind of stuff.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">{namecode:34}：</span><br>
Can I... try writing one?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">{namecode:93}：</span><br>
Of course. Who would you like to send it to?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">{namecode:34}：</span><br>
Um... uh... Commander?<br>
I... want to wish Commander a happy New Year...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">{namecode:93}：</span><br>
Oh? That's a good idea. I'm sure Commander would be very happy to get a card from you.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">{namecode:16}：</span><br>
Eh? Why would Commander be happy?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">{namecode:93}：</span><br>
Well... Hey! Yuudachi, no running in the hallway! ... Anyway, children who send cards to adults might just receive a nice reward.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">{namecode:16}：</span><br>
Say what? Then, I wanna write one too!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">{namecode:93}：</span><br>
Do you really? Then, sit down right here. Kisaragi, you too. All right, take a postcard and a pen.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">{namecode:34}：</span><br>
Okay! This looks fun!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">{namecode:16}：</span><br>
Souryuu, why is there a picture of a pig on this card?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">{namecode:93}：</span><br>
These cards are usually printed with the corresponding zodiac animal. It's now the Year of the Pig. Is something the matter, Yuudachi?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">{namecode:16}：</span><br>
Just looking at it is making me hungry...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">{namecode:93}：</span><br>
Haha... In short, there are no rules on what you can write on your card, especially for children. Just writing what's on your mind is good enough.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">{namecode:16}：</span><br>
In that case, I'll write... "Commander, I wanna eat lots of meat this year as well." ... And done!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">{namecode:93}：</span><br>
... ... At least write "Happy New Year," okay?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">{namecode:16}：</span><br>
Ohh! ... But uh, how do I spell that again?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">{namecode:34}：</span><br>
Um... I also... don't know how...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">{namecode:93}：</span><br>
I suppose we'll have to start from the basics then. Here, I'll write it out first, then you can try for yourself.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">{namecode:55}：</span><br>
Hrm? Souryuu, Yuudachi, and Kisaragi? What are you three doing here?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">{namecode:93}：</span><br>
I'm teaching them how to write a New Year's card to send to Commander.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">{namecode:55}：</span><br>
Eh? Um... I see... In that case, I'll be slowly making my way toward the egress~<br>
<br>
One hour later...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">{namecode:93}：</span><br>
Aoba, is this your doing?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">{namecode:55}：</span><br>
What could you be talking about?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">{namecode:93}：</span><br>
Who else would call all the destroyers to come write cards?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">{namecode:55}：</span><br>
Oh come on, I merely asked everyone if they had anything they'd like to thank the commander for...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">{namecode:33}：</span><br>
Ms. Souryuu, I drew a flower, see?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">{namecode:34}：</span><br>
Souryuu... Um, teacher... Did I do it right?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">{namecode:16}：</span><br>
Ah! This card has a porkchop on it! I wanna use this card!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">{namecode:124}：</span><br>
Oh ho ho~ I do believe I shall write some most "stimulating" things~<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">{namecode:125}：</span><br>
Uuu.... I made a mistake again...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">{namecode:19}：</span><br>
Souryuu, what do you think of my elegant writing?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">{namecode:55}：</span><br>
Eheh, it's decided then! The "Super Popularity Contest - Ms. Souryuu's Special Classroom, End of Year Edition," will begin tomorrow!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">{namecode:93}：</span><br>
Why is Kamikaze even here... Ah jeez, I suppose this isn't so bad...<br>
All right, if you have any questions, please come up one at a time. First, I'll write "Happy New Year" on the board, so make sure to watch me carefully!<br>

Phew... All right, the New Year Soba is coming out nicely...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">{namecode:34}：</span><br>
It smells really good...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">{namecode:93}：</span><br>
Ah, watch out, Yuudachi! Don't fall into the pot!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">{namecode:16}：</span><br>
This one seems yummy too! Gimme seconds!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">{namecode:93}：</span><br>
Calm down, there's more than enough left.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">{namecode:67}：</span><br>
Souryuu, you really are quite talented~ Oh my, is Kaga here too?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">{namecode:92}：</span><br>
Being able to enjoy a moment of peace every now and then isn't so bad.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">{namecode:67}：</span><br>
That's not something I hear from you every day, Kaga. Oh, by the way, where's Akagi?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">{namecode:92}：</span><br>
She spouted something like "I need to pamper Commander, who is always so hard working," and then ran off again.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">{namecode:67}：</span><br>
Oh my... Looks like Commander will have no shortage of troubles this New Year as well...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">{namecode:92}：</span><br>
I suppose this is "the weight of love." Well, since it's the New Year, we might as well let Akagi cut loose a bit.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">{namecode:67}：</span><br>
Speaking of "cutting loose," I think these two have gone a bit overboard.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Prinz Eugen：</span><br>
Oh, sakura's liquor... is truly ambrosia... *hic*<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Laffey：</span><br>
Laffey... wants another glass too...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">{namecode:93}：</span><br>
I'll turn a blind eye on Eugen... But why is that girl from the Eagle Union here?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">{namecode:98}：</span><br>
I ran into her at the store, nya. She seemed quite interested in our New Year's customs, so I brought her along, nya.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">{namecode:93}：</span><br>
Ah, what a waste. She's wearing such a cute outfit... but give her some drinks and she turns into a puddle of mush.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">{namecode:92}：</span><br>
A New Year's drinking party, huh? Haha... I haven't gotten fired up in a while.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">{namecode:67}：</span><br>
Oh my, I can already see what happens next...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">{namecode:34}：</span><br>
Li... quor? Is that edible...?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">{namecode:98}：</span><br>
That would be the name of a miserable end for adults who have cast away too much. It's not something a good kid like you needs to know about, nya.<br>

Akagi, you didn't forget to do your New Year's shrine visit, did you?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">{namecode:91}：</span><br>
Ahaha, of course not! I wished for important things like the Commander's health, and for Commander to avoid all those poisonous wicked pests~<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">{namecode:67}：</span><br>
Exactly as expected of you, Akagi...<br>

My head... hurts....<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Prinz Eugen：</span><br>
What the heck, Kaga... Even though you were drinking so much, how come you look so refreshed today...?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Laffey：</span><br>
Ughhh... So this is... the Sakura Empire's true power...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">{namecode:92}：</span><br>
Heh, can't afford to miss the important New Year's shrine visit, after all.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">{namecode:98}：</span><br>
We have to pray for peace and prosperity in the coming year, nya!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">{namecode:34}：</span><br>
I'm... sleepy...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">{namecode:93}：</span><br>
Well, we did stay up pretty late. Must be especially hard for those who went to the drinking party.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Prinz Eugen：</span><br>
So this is the "shrine?" It has a nice atmosphere to it.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">{namecode:92}：</span><br>
It's a sacred site, after all. It's quite impressive how those two sisters got set up here so quickly.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">{namecode:67}：</span><br>
All right, since we're all here, we should all make our offerings.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">{namecode:93}：</span><br>
Those who came here first have already started to hang up their wishes, huh? Wow, there's quite a variety of wishes...<br>
This note with all these scribbly lines… “I wanna eat a lot of meat!” One glance and I can already tell it's Yuudachi's...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">{namecode:78}：</span><br>
Welcome to the shrine. Yamashiro and I are so happy to see everyone's wishes. It makes all our work worth it.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">{namecode:92}：</span><br>
Thank you for this ceremonial arrow. I shall take good care of it.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">{namecode:78}：</span><br>
No, thank you for coming. Everyone, please come this way. Because Eugen and Laffey are here, I will explain how to make an offering.<br>
First, purify your hands. Toss a coin into the offering box and ring the bell to greet the deity. Then bow twice, clap your hands twice, and pray. Finally, bow again, and you will be all done.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Prinz Eugen：</span><br>
All right...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Laffey：</span><br>
Okay...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">{namecode:93}：</span><br>
Let’s start then.<br>
<br>

<br>

<span style="color:#4eb24e;">{namecode:91}：</span><br>
(Commander will definitely be with me forever, right, Gods? Of course, just leave those troublesome pests to me… hehehe…)<br>
<br>
(ding-a-ling~)<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">{namecode:92}：</span><br>
(I wish to engage in a thrilling, bloody battle with a truly worthy foe this year...)<br>
<br>

<span style="color:#4eb24e;">{namecode:34}：</span><br>

<span style="color:#4eb24e;">{namecode:98}：</span><br>
(I wish for everyone to support Akashi's business this coming year, nya)<br>
<br>
(ding-a-ling~)<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">{namecode:16}：</span><br>
I wanna be able to eat a lot of delicious stuff!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">{namecode:93}：</span><br>
Hey, if you say it out loud, it won't come true! Besides, that's not even a wish!<br>
<br>
(ding-a-ling~)<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Prinz Eugen：</span><br>
(My wish, huh... My wish is to learn about a lot of interesting things, and meet a lot more interesting people in this fleet~)<br>
<br>
(ding-a-ling~)<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Laffey：</span><br>
(I wish… to always be together with Commander... and everyone else...)<br>
<br>
(ding-a-ling~)<br>
Everyone：<br>
I wish… that this will be a good year ahead of us!<br>
