<br>
It was a regular day, and the Aladiss Research Team was carrying out an important mission deep within a cave...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Yumia Liessfeldt：</span><br>
Once we're through this cave, we'll arrive at where our survey target is. Let's do this, team!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Isla von Duerer：</span><br>
You said the same thing a good while ago... Nina, did it take this long the last time you went to this cave?<br>
Because I'm starting to think we've gotten lost.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Nina Friede：</span><br>
This cave is a straight line from start to finish. It would be an achievement to get lost in here.<br>
That said, this thick fog was definitely not there the last time.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Isla von Duerer：</span><br>
And no manabound area so concentrated that you needed Yumia to escort you either, right?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Nina Friede：</span><br>
Yeah. All things considered, this cave phenomenon strikes me as weird.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Yumia Liessfeldt：</span><br>
Hmm... Do you think we should pause our survey and sort the situation out?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Lenja：</span><br>
Yumia, Nina... I think we might... be nearing the exit...<br>
I can smell it... There's a humid breeze blowing our way...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Yumia Liessfeldt：</span><br>
Wait, humid breeze?<br>
But the place we're heading to should be a dry wasteland...<br>
Oh well, let's keep moving! We'll figure it out on the other side.<br>
Come on, everyone! We're almost there!<br>

<br>
It was a regular day, and the treasure hunter duo was pursuing a lead in a stretch of the sea...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Portsmouth Adventure：</span><br>
...We're on the right track, yeah? This IS the route the merchant ship took to some ancient ruins, tryin' to avoid the storm?<br>
It's been seven or eight days now, 'n' we haven't found bloody anythin'!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Amity：</span><br>
Maybe it was a false lead?<br>
Ill-founded guesswork makes up the bulk of information you'll get at a tavern, after all. Why did you take their word for it?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Portsmouth Adventure：</span><br>
Y'have any idea what it cost to get this information?! Three whole bottles of good-arse liquor, that's what!<br>
This tip HAS to be real or I'll be livid!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Amity：</span><br>
*sigh*... Alright. I'll stick around for another day or two.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Portsmouth Adventure：</span><br>
Hang on a minute... This won't take that long!<br>
Look! Storm clouds are formin'!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Amity：</span><br>
A storm appearing completely out of nowhere... The exact same thing as what the merchant told us happened.<br>
I have a theory – perhaps you can only reach the ruins during a storm?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Portsmouth Adventure：</span><br>
Ahahaha! There it is! The tip was genuine!<br>
Onward, ye brave treasure hunters! Through the storm 'n' rain, to a land brimmin' with treasures!<br>

<br>
It was a gloomy afternoon, with foreboding, heavy clouds hanging overhead. A team of adventurers was carrying out an important mission...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Fu Shun：</span><br>
You really did it, Fu Po! You got us on a patrol mission around the permanent surveillance point of the Tower of Illusions!<br>
If I'd brought a hat, I'd tip it for you in respect!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Fu Po：</span><br>
Heheheh. Yeah, this brilliant plan of mine was in the works for a long, long time.<br>
I first got Fei Yuen appointed as the secretary, then we schemed together from the inside, and while the Commander wasn't looking, that's when we struck...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Gallant：</span><br>
Hold on now! You're saying this patrol mission WASN'T ordered by the Commander?!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Fu Po：</span><br>
No, of course it was. The Commander just doesn't know it. Yet.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Fu Shun：</span><br>
*sigh*... Poor Fei Yuen, our hero and martyr! We've gotta adventure extra hard on her behalf!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Gallant：</span><br>
I'm starting to think this adventure team has a pretty reckless inclination...<br>
I'm going to have to keep an eye on you two to make sure you don't do anything wildly dangerous!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Fu Shun：</span><br>
Sure! Good idea! In fact, we could use a goody two shoes like you to provide camouflage for this grand adventure!<br>
Now tag along! Adventure is a-calling!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Gallant：</span><br>
Fwee-fwee! To the Virtual Tower we go!<br>

<br>
Chapter 1<br>
Sea of Beginnings<br>
Height above sea level: 0 m<br>
A cerulean sky, white clouds, blue sea, and yellow sands, with great mountains towering toward the heavens.<br>
Amongst all of this, the Aladiss Research Team looked on in awe and bewilderment.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Yumia Liessfeldt：</span><br>
Uhh...<br>
Flammi, where are we?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Flammi：</span><br>
Flammi's records contain no information on this place. It appears that we've entered uncharted territory.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Yumia Liessfeldt：</span><br>
H-how did we end up on the wrong trail?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Nina Friede：</span><br>
It doesn't look like we just ended up in an unfamiliar place.<br>
The cave we used to get here is gone without a trace.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Isla von Duerer：</span><br>
It totally is! Doesn't that mean we're, you know, stuck here?!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Yumia Liessfeldt：</span><br>
In a place we know nothing about... Not at all the kind of position you want to be in.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Lenja：</span><br>
Um... Yumia!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Yumia Liessfeldt：</span><br>
What is it, Lenja?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Lenja：</span><br>
The mana in this place... It feels a little off to me...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Yumia Liessfeldt：</span><br>
It "feels a little off"?<br>
Now that you mention it... Yeah, something is a little off about it.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Isla von Duerer：</span><br>
What does that mean? Is something wrong with the mana here?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Yumia Liessfeldt：</span><br>
It's not so bad that I'd say something is "wrong," per se...<br>
Flammi, can you do a scan?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Flammi：</span><br>
Initiating scan...<br>
Scan complete. The mana in this location seems to differ from ordinary mana.<br>
Although its specific structural elements cannot be identified, it would be suitable to call this mana "pseudo-mana."<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Yumia Liessfeldt：</span><br>
Talk about a strange place...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Nina Friede：</span><br>
Hey, there's a ship heading toward us.<br>
It looks to be a pirate ship.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Isla von Duerer：</span><br>
What? Pirates?! Are they coming to steal our stuff?!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Lenja：</span><br>
W-we have no idea what happened, and we know nothing about this place! I think we should run away for now!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Isla von Duerer：</span><br>
There's another option: Hit them before they hit us!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Yumia Liessfeldt：</span><br>
Items for fighting, and items for running... I have both ready for use at any time.<br>
Although... Is it just me, or are they waving at us?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Isla von Duerer：</span><br>
Maybe they're the polite kind of pirates?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Nina Friede：</span><br>
Assuming they're willing to negotiate, I think we should talk to them first.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Yumia Liessfeldt：</span><br>
Okay. We'll wait until they make it to land.<br>
<br>
Meanwhile...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Portsmouth Adventure：</span><br>
Amity! I reckon we've actually reached the ruins!<br>
Have a gander at the mountains! The sea! And the sky, she's a beaut!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Amity：</span><br>
Strange... All we did was cut through some fog, then the storm disappeared and our surroundings changed completely.<br>
Maybe, just maybe, we've hit the jackpot with this one.<br>
On another note, there are some people standing on the beach over there. How did they get here before us?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Portsmouth Adventure：</span><br>
Maybe they're some folks livin' in the ruins? We oughta moor 'n' have a chat with 'em.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Amity：</span><br>
*sigh*... Still haven't learned a thing about being cautious, I see.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Portsmouth Adventure：</span><br>
That's 'cos I don't need to be! C'mon then, let's get on the shore!<br>
{{折叠面板|内容结束}}

{{折叠面板|标题=Pleasant Sands|选项=5|主框=1|样式=primary|展开=是}}
<br>
Shortly after, the treasure hunters and the Research Team managed to meet face-to-face on the shore.<br>
After a brief conversation, both sides grew more confused about this place they were in – as well as each other.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Yumia Liessfeldt：</span><br>
..."Shipgirls"?<br>
Flammi, does that ring any bells?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Flammi：</span><br>
Searching... No corresponding entry for this term was found in Flammi's records.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Amity：</span><br>
Hm? I mean, shipgirls are warriors who sail the seven seas with their riggings.<br>
Everyone knows that. It's strange that you don't. Let me guess – did you girls come from another world, perhaps?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Portsmouth Adventure：</span><br>
Wait, what're you sayin'?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Amity：</span><br>
Royal Fortune talked about it once, remember? Don't tell me you've forgotten about that port with mindbogglingly powerful cannons.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Portsmouth Adventure：</span><br>
Ohh! Right, yeah!<br>
Blimey. Then we've wound up in the same situation, eh...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Yumia Liessfeldt：</span><br>
You mean... we've wound up in another world?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Isla von Duerer：</span><br>
How'd that even happen? Was it because we passed through a concentrated manabound area?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Lenja：</span><br>
Something like this wouldn't happen just by passing through a manabound area...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Nina Friede：</span><br>
It must've been due to some bizarre phenomenon we don't know about.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Yumia Liessfeldt：</span><br>
That would explain why the mana here feels so strange.<br>
Sounds like you were right to call it "pseudo-mana," Flammi.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Flammi：</span><br>
Of course. Flammi is a super-high-spec independent survey-assistance device, after all.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Yumia Liessfeldt：</span><br>
Unfortunately, this will make it even harder for us to return home than I expected.<br>
Amity, Portsmouth, would you two mind telling us more about this world we're in?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Portsmouth Adventure：</span><br>
Sure we can!<br>
But first, how 'bout you lassies board our ship 'n' have a rest?<br>
Travelin' by ship'll make it easier to map our surroundings 'n' all.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Yumia Liessfeldt：</span><br>
I'm fine with that. What about the rest of you?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Isla von Duerer：</span><br>
I've never been on a pirate– Err, treasure hunter ship before.<br>
It sounds interesting, so count me in!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Nina Friede：</span><br>
Agreed. I'm curious to see what the ships are like in this other world.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Lenja：</span><br>
I wouldn't... mind it.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Portsmouth Adventure：</span><br>
So, we good to go?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Yumia Liessfeldt：</span><br>
One more thing. I saw a sign that said, "This beach is named Pleasant Sands," signed by someone named "Purity."<br>
Do you happen to know anything about this person?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Amity：</span><br>
"Purity"? Can't say I do.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Yumia Liessfeldt：</span><br>
I see... No worries, then. Let's set off.<br>

{{折叠面板|标题=The Rocky Beach|选项=6|主框=1|样式=primary|展开=是}}
<br>
Across the cliffs, the adventure team had endured many difficulties – fierce gales, raging waves, heavy fog, and communication cutoff.<br>
Worse yet, they were still in dire straits.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Gallant：</span><br>
Fwee-fwee! Push on! Don't stop!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Fu Po：</span><br>
But I can't... I feel like I'm going to drop dead from exhaustion...<br>
What did we do to deserve... this string of horrible luck?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Fu Shun：</span><br>
Are we really going to die... without even having finished this adventure?<br>
My head's dizzy, my stomach's rumbling...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Gallant：</span><br>
Fwee-fweeee! We're just one step away from victory!<br>
All we have to do is get past this reef and we'll be on land!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Fu Shun：</span><br>
Oh, thank god! Just need to rest, then we can resume our adventure...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Fu Po：</span><br>
I'm just wondering... was there always an island in this area?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Fu Shun：</span><br>
Maybe? I dunno!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Gallant：</span><br>
I'm not too sure either...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Fu Po：</span><br>
Well, whatever... We can ponder that once we have land beneath our feet.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Gallant：</span><br>
Fwee-fwee! Let's go!<br>

<br>
As a pleasant wind blew around them, the members of the Research Team looked around on the deck of Portsmouth Adventure's ship, eyes brimming with curiosity.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Isla von Duerer：</span><br>
Thalassopolis, Nebula Guardians, Tempesta... It sure does sound like an otherworldly story.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Yumia Liessfeldt：</span><br>
I mean, they are literally from another world, so it tracks.<br>
What's really interesting to me is those "riggings" that drastically raise your fighting ability. I'm curious how to make one.<br>
Maybe I could even make one for each of us...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Nina Friede：</span><br>
Sadly, I don't think that's going to happen.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Isla von Duerer：</span><br>
There you are, Nina. Are you done with your tour?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Nina Friede：</span><br>
Yes. I saw everything there was to see. The idea of riggings really caught my interest.<br>
It got me curious, so I asked Amity about the possibility of producing them at scale.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Isla von Duerer：</span><br>
And what'd she say?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Nina Friede：</span><br>
That you supposedly cannot use a rigging properly unless you're a shipgirl.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Yumia Liessfeldt：</span><br>
Aww... That's a bummer. Also, where is Lenja?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Nina Friede：</span><br>
I heard she volunteered to help investigate a particular phenomenon that Amity discovered.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Yumia Liessfeldt：</span><br>
That sounds like her, alright. What was the phenomenon?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Nina Friede：</span><br>
Apparently, there's a strange, giant structure out there... Amity suspects it's the entrance to some ancient ruins.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Portsmouth Adventure：</span><br>
Aye! And if it really is the entrance, that brings us 'nother step closer to findin' the treasure!<br>
We're 'bout to head out 'n' do a survey. If ya lassies're interested, feel free to come along.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Yumia Liessfeldt：</span><br>
Umm... Sorry, but I think your priorities are wrong.<br>
Our focus should be on finding a way home, not on finding treasure, so while we appreciate the offer, we'll have to pass.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Portsmouth Adventure：</span><br>
Whuh? Who said ya can't do both at once?<br>
When ya get thrown into a foreign place, most folks'd try to solve the mysteries while lookin' for a way out, yeah?<br>
Now there's this giant ruin ahead of us, 'n' I wager the way out might be in there. Makes sense, aye?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Yumia Liessfeldt：</span><br>
That's... strangely convincing.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Nina Friede：</span><br>
Come to think of it, we've had similar experiences while exploring ruins before.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Isla von Duerer：</span><br>
Going on a search with treasure hunters, you say? Yumia, Nina, let's give it a shot!<br>
{{折叠面板|内容结束}}

{{折叠面板|标题=Coming Together - Part 2|选项=8|主框=1|样式=primary|展开=是}}
<br>
The little squad of adventurers had made it to land after enduring numerous hardships. Now, they realized something – two vessels were on the horizon.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Gallant：</span><br>
Fwee-fwee! Attention to the sea! There are ships coming toward us!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Fu Shun：</span><br>
Huh? Those look like sailing ships, don't they?<br>
This might sound crazy, but I think we ended up in Tempesta's world after passing through that storm!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Fu Po：</span><br>
Yes – I have heard that they take advantage of storms to travel between places.<br>
Hmm... That would explain this strange landmass and our comms going down.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Fu Shun：</span><br>
So we are LITERALLY adventuring in a new world?!<br>
Holy cow! Now that's a crazy twist to what I thought would just be a little trip!<br>
Alright, we should totally give them a shout...<br>
Ahem! Excuse me, are you with Tempesta?<br>
<br>
Thus, the Aladiss Research Team, the treasure hunters, and the trio of adventurers all met at the entrance to the ruins.<br>
However, their decision to exchange information at this turn led to further confusion.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Yumia Liessfeldt：</span><br>
So in short... you and the treasure hunters come from different worlds.<br>
But at the same time, you've had many cross-world exchanges in the past.<br>
And in your world, visitors from afar like us have become a common sight. Did I get all that right?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Fu Shun：</span><br>
More or less!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Yumia Liessfeldt：</span><br>
And you found out about alchemy through those visitors?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Fu Shun：</span><br>
Yup! If I remember right, alchemists need some kind of base to do alchemy, right?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Yumia Liessfeldt：</span><br>
Yes. The term we use for it is "atelier"!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Fu Shun：</span><br>
Okay, then we should go looking for one ASAP! I wanna see some sick alchemy in action!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Yumia Liessfeldt：</span><br>
I knew you'd say that...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Isla von Duerer：</span><br>
To be fair, that's a very normal reaction to have.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Yumia Liessfeldt：</span><br>
A handful of conditions must be met for a place to serve as an atelier. Ideally, it'd be somewhere where I can focus on doing alchemy.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Lenja：</span><br>
Um, Yumia... How about... inside these ruins?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Yumia Liessfeldt：</span><br>
Let's see... Yes, this looks like the optimal place for it!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Amity：</span><br>
Pardon for butting in, but there's a sign over here.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Isla von Duerer：</span><br>
Is there? Let me see!<br>
"You're now approaching the entrance area leading to the Skynexus Tower. There's no danger, so you can go forward with peace of mind." Signed Purity.<br>
Another sign left by this Purity individual, eh...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Fu Po：</span><br>
Huh? Pur– Purity?!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Isla von Duerer：</span><br>
Oh, are they someone you know?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Fu Po：</span><br>
That's putting it mildly... She's so famous in our world that you'd struggle to find anyone who DOESN'T know her.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Gallant：</span><br>
Mhm. Her name almost always pops up whenever there's something to do with visitors from another world.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Fu Shun：</span><br>
And in the adventuring world, she's revered as a goddess!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Nina Friede：</span><br>
You keep using the word "adventure." What do you mean by that?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Fu Shun：</span><br>
It means a thrilling, action-packed, and supremely stimulating journey into the unknown!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Yumia Liessfeldt：</span><br>
A journey into the unknown...<br>
In that case, let us be part of your adventure!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Fu Po & Gallant：</span><br>
Adventure tiiime!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Isla von Duerer：</span><br>
Not you too, Yumia...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Yumia Liessfeldt：</span><br>
Alright! Let's start exploring the entrance area!<br>
{{折叠面板|内容结束}}

{{折叠面板|标题=Skynexus Tower: Entrance Area|选项=9|主框=1|样式=primary|展开=是}}
<br>
Beyond a long, narrow passage, the team was faced with an incomprehensible, towering structure.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Portsmouth Adventure：</span><br>
Ooh! Aye, these ruins are as ancient as any I've seen!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Fu Po：</span><br>
A typical Siren structure...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Isla von Duerer：</span><br>
Hey, I found another sign here!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Nina Friede：</span><br>
Let me see it.<br>
"Go through this path to find a safe and comfy rest area."<br>
Dubious. Are you sure we can trust these messages?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Fu Shun：</span><br>
Yeah, we can! If Purity left a message, then I say it's trustworthy!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Yumia Liessfeldt：</span><br>
What lies up ahead? There's only one way to find out!<br>
<br>
Shortly after, at the "safe and comfy rest area"...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Isla von Duerer：</span><br>
Whoa, this place is so fancy! It's nothing like the outside!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Portsmouth Adventure：</span><br>
Hell's bells, the sign was true!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Fu Shun：</span><br>
Heheh, I think it really was left by THE Purity!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Lenja：</span><br>
Umm... There's another one here, too.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Fu Po：</span><br>
That's one heck of a sign... It takes up the whole wall.<br>
So many words, so many little doodles...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Amity：</span><br>
Why does she go through the trouble of leaving these signs, anyway?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Fu Po：</span><br>
It's a mystery. The inner workings of Purity's mind are an enigma.<br>
For now, let's see what we can discern from her writing.<br>
I see... It mostly contains basic information about the tower itself.<br>
This place is called the Skynexus Tower, and this particular place is the entrance area. It's really, really tall.<br>
Most functions of the tower are inoperative, including the elevator.<br>
To use the elevator, we need to repair the generator...<br>
Hmm? It says all of the clues we need to repair it are in this very room!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Yumia Liessfeldt：</span><br>
In this room? Could it be that thing that looks like a memory vial?<br>
It sticks out so much to me, like the pseudo-mana did when we got here.<br>
Flammi, can you scan its structure for us?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Flammi：</span><br>
Initiating scan...<br>
This memory vial's structure differs from those of normal ones. However, it exhibits similar data-recording functions.<br>
It would be suitable to call this memory vial a "pseudo-vial."<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Yumia Liessfeldt：</span><br>
This must be the perfect place for alchemy that we were hoping for.<br>
Flammi, can you read the data on that vial?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Flammi：</span><br>
Of course. Flammi is a super-high-spec independent survey-assistance device, after all, so even a pseudo-vial–<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Yumia Liessfeldt：</span><br>
Yes, yes, we get it. Hurry it up, please.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Flammi：</span><br>
Initiating scan...<br>
Reading complete.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Yumia Liessfeldt：</span><br>
Nothing happened. You're not malfunctioning, are you?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Flammi：</span><br>
Flammi is not malfunctioning. The reason for this playback failure lies in the structure of the pseudo-vial.<br>
However, Flammi already imported the data from this pseudo-vial during the scan. There is no cause for concern.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Yumia Liessfeldt：</span><br>
So it isn't like the ones we know at all. Let's see what you've got...<br>
Hmm... A recipe for an Energy Tuner to repair the elevator.<br>
And... What's this? A recipe for four people's worth of rigging?!<br>
But rigging isn't something that just anyone can use, is it?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Fu Shun：</span><br>
You're right in theory, but for some reason, every visitor from other worlds has been able to so far.<br>
By the way, people at the port did research on that! Uhh... Something about reconstruction and matching, and...<br>
I dunno. It looked too complicated for me to bother reading any of it.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Yumia Liessfeldt：</span><br>
That's a shame. It sounds fascinating.<br>
Fu Shun, you strike me as the kind of person who can't stand studying.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Fu Shun：</span><br>
Don't be silly. An Shan always praises me for my good grades!<br>
It's just that studying and doing what you want to do are totally different things!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Yumia Liessfeldt：</span><br>
You mean adventure... I totally understand.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Isla von Duerer：</span><br>
C'mon, Yumia. Let's make our own riggings already!<br>
I wanna see how it feels!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Yumia Liessfeldt：</span><br>
Sorry, Isla, but there are a few materials I don't recognize in this recipe. I won't be able to make them right now.<br>
But I did see the materials for the Energy Tuner on the way here.<br>
If we go back to the beach, we can collect them all!<br>

<br>
Once the Energy Tuner was placed in the designated location, the elevator whirred to life.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Fu Shun：</span><br>
You made that complicated little device in an instant... Alchemy is incredible!<br>
Teach me alchemy, Master Yumia!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Fu Po：</span><br>
Me, too.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Yumia Liessfeldt：</span><br>
Can you feel the pseudo-mana around us, Fu Shun?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Fu Shun：</span><br>
Feel the what?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Yumia Liessfeldt：</span><br>
It isn't quite the same as the mana I use for alchemy, but if you can't even sense the pseudo-mana, then it's going to be difficult for you to imitate my style...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Fu Shun：</span><br>
Aww, man...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Gallant：</span><br>
Fwee-fwee! Cheer up! Onward and upward!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Amity：</span><br>
Wait. If we're going to climb, then what do we do about the ship?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Nina Friede：</span><br>
We'll just have to leave it.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Fu Shun：</span><br>
I have an idea! We get a whole ton of logs, line them up on the beach. Then, we haul the ship up with ropes...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Amity：</span><br>
So we're all in agreement – we leave the ship as-is.<br>
Our way in was by ship, and I'm guessing our way out will be, too.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Fu Shun：</span><br>
Shoot... And there I thought the "shiptravel by land" plan might actually be genius.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Amity：</span><br>
......<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Isla von Duerer：</span><br>
What about the supplies in the rest area? Should we take them?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Fu Shun：</span><br>
Yeah! The sign doesn't say anything about them being off-limits!<br>
Purity can't complain even if we pilfer the whole place dry!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Yumia Liessfeldt：</span><br>
There are a few things I'd like to take...<br>
Lenja, can you help me?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Lenja：</span><br>
O-okay! I'm happy to help, Yumia!<br>

<br>
Chapter 2<br>
Abundance Stratum<br>
Height above sea level: Approximately 2 km<br>
When the party took the elevator above the tower's entrance area, a gleaming blue lake came into view.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Gallant：</span><br>
Fwee-fwee! Another sign spotted!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Amity：</span><br>
"The lake is at its peak water level. Its water is potable, and tasty fish inhabit it."<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Nina Friede：</span><br>
Tasty fish, eh? We were so busy repairing that elevator that we forgot to eat.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Fu Shun：</span><br>
Camping time! We should set up camp by the lake!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Portsmouth Adventure：</span><br>
Ohh, camping! Let's get to fishin' up grub, mateys!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Amity：</span><br>
We'll need people to collect firewood, set up tents, and the like. Or do you think we can build shelter with fish?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Isla von Duerer：</span><br>
Then I'll go get the firewood!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Gallant：</span><br>
Isla, the forest might be dangerous. I'll go with you!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Isla von Duerer：</span><br>
Yay! Kindling buddies!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Fu Po：</span><br>
I'm not much of a fisher... but I can pitch a tent or two!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Nina Friede：</span><br>
I set up plenty of camps in my time as a merc. Let me help you out.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Lenja：</span><br>
I'll help, too...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Fu Po：</span><br>
Great! With our combined powers, we'll build the fanciest tent ever seen!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Nina Friede：</span><br>
Not so fast. You want a sturdy tent, not a pretty one.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Lenja：</span><br>
*nods*<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Fu Po：</span><br>
Okaaay... Well, you just tell me what to do, boss!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Fu Shun：</span><br>
Does that mean the rest of us are fishing?<br>
Well, let's hop to it! Just you wait – first catch is going to be mine!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Amity：</span><br>
A fishing competition with treasure hunters? Count me in.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Yumia Liessfeldt：</span><br>
That does sound like fun! Can I join?<br>
<br>
Shortly after...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Portsmouth Adventure：</span><br>
Mwahahaha! Check out this catch!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Amity：</span><br>
Now do you see? You never had a chance.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Fu Shun：</span><br>
Urk... How am I supposed to beat that?<br>
Yumia, status report?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Yumia Liessfeldt：</span><br>
I'm doing fine, I guess?<br>
By the way, I cooked this a little while ago for the survey. Please give it a taste!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Fu Shun：</span><br>
Hey, uh... did everything in this meal really come from the lake?<br>
But... aren't there chestnuts in it?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Yumia Liessfeldt：</span><br>
That's right! I fished up some pretty big ones just the other day.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Fu Shun：</span><br>
You... "fished up" chestnuts?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Yumia Liessfeldt：</span><br>
Yeah!<br>
{{折叠面板|内容结束}}

<br>
In the finished tent, everyone showed off their cooking skills and enjoyed a luxurious lunch together.<br>
After a sufficient rest period, they continued their exploration.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Gallant：</span><br>
Fwee-fwee! Now entering the Forest of Abundance!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Yumia Liessfeldt：</span><br>
I see another of Purity's signs. What does it say this time?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Gallant：</span><br>
"There's lots of good food in the Forest of Abundance, and you can harvest weird materials from the treetops!"<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Yumia Liessfeldt：</span><br>
Weird materials? I'll try harvesting them!<br>
One, two, aaand...<br>
<br>
Yumia smacked a tree with her staff, causing many spherical objects to fall from it.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Yumia Liessfeldt：</span><br>
Oh... They're just ordinary Uni.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Fu Shun：</span><br>
???<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Fu Po：</span><br>
???<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Amity：</span><br>
Ordinary... uni? Do those come from trees?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Yumia Liessfeldt：</span><br>
Well, normally, yes.<br>
{{折叠面板|内容结束}}

{{折叠面板|标题=Meadow of Abundance|选项=13|主框=1|样式=primary|展开=是}}
<br>
Beyond the Forest of Abundance, the group happened upon a vast grassland.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Yumia Liessfeldt：</span><br>
What a huge meadow...<br>
Flammi and I can use Procella to explore the area, if you'd like.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Gallant：</span><br>
All we need is something that goes fast that everyone can ride, right?<br>
Lucky us, I brought just the thing!<br>
<br>
Gallant produced a huge sled from her rigging's storage container.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Fu Shun：</span><br>
Something that goes fast...<br>
Come to think of it, on my last adventure with Bristol, I borrowed a Dullahan with an internal power source. I think I forgot to give it back to her...<br>
Here it is!<br>
<br>
Fu Shun suddenly disappeared into the suit of armor.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Amity：</span><br>
Why do you girls carry those things around with you?<br>
Portsmouth and I don't typically travel by land, so we didn't bring anything of the sort.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Isla von Duerer：</span><br>
Neither do we...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Lenja：</span><br>
I-I can just run as fast as I can!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Gallant：</span><br>
Nuh-uh! That would be too hard!<br>
Two more people can fit on my sled!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Fu Po：</span><br>
Then that leaves three.<br>
Wait a second... Aha! There's the ATV I brought for our last topological survey!<br>
Finally, an actual vehicle... I bet this bad boy could fit three of us, easy!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Gallant：</span><br>
Fwee-fwee! Everyone up for a race?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Fu Shun：</span><br>
Heh heh heh... I'll be the spooky ghost chasing everyone!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Yumia Liessfeldt：</span><br>
Three, two, one... Goooo!<br>

<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Nina Friede：</span><br>
Oh, my...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Isla von Duerer：</span><br>
All of the plants here are contaminated!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Yumia Liessfeldt：</span><br>
Be careful, everyone! The still water here is extremely corrosive.<br>
I'll gather a few materials for analysis...<br>
The source of this contamination might be nearby. Let's proceed with caution.<br>
{{折叠面板|内容结束}}

{{折叠面板|标题=Poison River|选项=15|主框=1|样式=primary|展开=是}}
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Nina Friede：</span><br>
Corrosive liquid is flowing through this river.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Lenja：</span><br>
Is this what contaminated the meadow?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Yumia Liessfeldt：</span><br>
I'll analyze the river...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Fu Po：</span><br>
Hey, what if we fished here?<br>
Can we catch fish in this river?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Yumia Liessfeldt：</span><br>
We... might be able to.<br>
I caught one.<br>
Is this a poisoned puffer? That tracks with the state of the river...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Fu Po：</span><br>
You already caught one?!<br>
Imagine if Huan Ch'ang saw this...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Fu Shun：</span><br>
Can we eat it?!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Amity：</span><br>
Come on. That clearly isn't edible.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Yumia Liessfeldt：</span><br>
That's right. It isn't food, but it IS useful for alchemy.<br>
{{折叠面板|内容结束}}

{{折叠面板|标题=Abandoned Village|选项=16|主框=1|样式=primary|展开=是}}
<br>
After following the poisonous river upstream, the party arrived at an abandoned settlement.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Yumia Liessfeldt：</span><br>
"As the name suggests, this village has been abandoned." Signed Purity.<br>
What was even the point of this sign?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Lenja：</span><br>
Yumia... The river's source is that huge waterfall!<br>
I think the corrosive water must be coming from there, too.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Yumia Liessfeldt：</span><br>
It's like a lake of poison. We have to find out how to get past this...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Portsmouth Adventure：</span><br>
If we can't go IN the water... How's about I go 'n' get that ship?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Fu Shun：</span><br>
Great idea!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Fu Po：</span><br>
BAD idea!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Gallant：</span><br>
Why not just deploy our riggings? We're SHIPgirls, so we don't need a ship.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Yumia Liessfeldt：</span><br>
Deploy... riggings? Can someone explain?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Gallant：</span><br>
Basically, it's this.<br>
<br>
With a dazzling flash of light, the rigging on Gallant disappeared. In its place, a single destroyer appeared upon the lake.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Yumia Liessfeldt：</span><br>
That is... amazing.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Isla von Duerer：</span><br>
Wow! You summoned that huge ship in the blink of an eye! How'd you do that?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Portsmouth Adventure：</span><br>
How DID ya do that?<br>
If I could do that, I wouldn't hafta buy ships all the frickin' time!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Fu Shun：</span><br>
That's a tough question...<br>
And I sure don't know the answer, either!<br>
{{折叠面板|内容结束}}

{{折叠面板|标题=Lake of Rot|选项=17|主框=1|样式=primary|展开=是}}
<br>
The girls boarded the destroyer and sailed onward, eventually finding a sign floating on the water.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Isla von Duerer：</span><br>
She's even leaving signs out on this huge lake! That girl's wild!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Gallant：</span><br>
"This is the Lake of Rot. The water quality is terrible and the fish are inedible. Look out for monster attacks!"<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Yumia Liessfeldt：</span><br>
Monster attacks...<br>
Did she mean from the giant group of monsters over there?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Fu Shun：</span><br>
Heh. An army of monsters... Then it's finally time to whip out big guns befitting of an adventure!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Lenja：</span><br>
D-did she just... transform?!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Yumia Liessfeldt：</span><br>
Whoa! I'd be scared if I were the enemy!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Portsmouth Adventure：</span><br>
...Whaddya call that shapeshiftin' ability of yours?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Fu Shun：</span><br>
This? This is called retrofitting!<br>
Let's gooo!<br>
<br>
<br>
KABOOOM!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Gallant：</span><br>
Defence one! Attack!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Amity：</span><br>
Fire portside cannons!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Nina Friede：</span><br>
I'm locked on. Time to finish this!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Isla von Duerer：</span><br>
Save some for me! I've got a hit with their name on it!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Yumia Liessfeldt：</span><br>
Take this... And that! Take all of it!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Fu Shun：</span><br>
All cannons! Fire!<br>
<br>
KABOOOM!<br>
Faced with the team's motley yet effective synergy, all the monsters blocking the path were eliminated.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Yumia Liessfeldt：</span><br>
Nice work, team!<br>
I managed to get some materials from the monsters. Materials that we'll need to make those riggings!<br>
Although, it looks like we're going to need more of them.<br>
Let's keep taking out monsters as we move through the lake!<br>
{{折叠面板|内容结束}}

{{折叠面板|标题=Skynexus Tower: L1 Area|选项=18|主框=1|样式=primary|展开=是}}
<br>
The girls sailed on, collecting materials from fallen monsters as they went. Eventually, they came upon another section of the tower that reached for the clouds.<br>
Naturally, Purity had left another sign there.<br>
"This is the Skynexus Tower's L1 area, which mainly... Eh, forget it. It's broken down, so it doesn't matter."<br>
They moved on, following the breadcrumb trail of signs along the road, until they arrived at another rest area.<br>
Shortly after, at the "safe and comfy rest area"...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Yumia Liessfeldt：</span><br>
I've read the instructions on all the signs.<br>
We just have to keep doing what we're doing: Adjust the Energy Tuner, reactivate the elevator, and proceed to the next floor.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Isla von Duerer：</span><br>
Thanks for doing the reading. Now why don't you come here and rest?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Yumia Liessfeldt：</span><br>
Wait, what? There's an entire hot spring in this rest area?!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Isla von Duerer：</span><br>
Yup! Even though it's got the same name, everything's completely different on the inside!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Yumia Liessfeldt：</span><br>
So Purity likes to change up the interior for each base... I've obviously never met her, but I think I know what kind of person she is.<br>
Anyway... It's safe to say there will be another, even bigger Lake of Rot at the waterfall's source. There will no doubt be more monsters living there, too.<br>
For now, let's recover our strength so we can be prepared for tomorrow's journey.<br>

<br>
Chapter 3<br>
Rot Stratum<br>
Height above sea level: Approximately 4 km<br>
The following day, the girls employed the same method as last time to activate the elevator in the L1 area.<br>
Aside from the fact that they were getting further and further away from the treasure hunter duo's ship, everything was going quite well.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Fu Po：</span><br>
"This the Sea of Rot. Yeah, a whole sea. You can't pass through it because it goes on forever. Just go by land."<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Fu Shun：</span><br>
Grr... Her saying that just makes me want to explore that sea even more!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Amity：</span><br>
Agreed. We just made it back to the sea, so I'm not too keen to be stuck on land again.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Yumia Liessfeldt：</span><br>
Personally, I don't mind one or the other.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Fu Shun：</span><br>
Okay! Then let's go the way opposite of land – into the Sea of Rot's deep waters!<br>
<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Lenja：</span><br>
This fog... It's getting thicker and thicker...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Nina Friede：</span><br>
Does it remind anyone else of how it looked when we first ended up here?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Isla von Duerer：</span><br>
Maybe there's a chance this will bring us back home!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Yumia Liessfeldt：</span><br>
Something tells me it won't be quite that easy.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Gallant：</span><br>
Fwee-fwee! Eyes ahead! Massive, unknown structure sighted!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Fu Po：</span><br>
Wait... Isn't that the area we set off from? The tower's L1 area?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Yumia Liessfeldt：</span><br>
Then it seems we've gone in a circle. I knew it wouldn't be that simple to leave this place.<br>
On the bright side, we gathered a bunch of useful materials.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Portsmouth Adventure：</span><br>
We did? Then at least we got somethin' outta this!<br>
Ya got enough to make some riggings now?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Yumia Liessfeldt：</span><br>
Not quite... I have plenty of ingredients, just not all the right ones.<br>
Some of them will need to be procured from the monsters living on land.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Fu Shun：</span><br>
Welp... Sounds like our only option is to get back on land.<br>
I was hoping we'd get to break the mold with this adventure, but oh well!<br>

<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Fu Po：</span><br>
"Here lies the Forest of Rot. There are loads of poisonous things here, and some monsters even swoop down from above. Terrible place to be."<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Yumia Liessfeldt：</span><br>
Purity's always leaving signs along paths that we're likely to travel. Is this her signature skill or something?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Amity：</span><br>
Ugh. This environment is certainly a step down from before. Not to mention there are more enemies to fight.<br>
Might I suggest we go back and get ourselves ready before we continue?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Portsmouth Adventure：</span><br>
Aye, me 'n' her're runnin' dangerously low on cannonballs. Best thing would be to go back and resupply.<br>
We're a wee bit frugal, y'see, so we don't usually go 'round haulin' loads of stuff.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Yumia Liessfeldt：</span><br>
If it's cannonballs you need, I might be able to make something using simple synthesis.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Amity：</span><br>
Simple synthesis? What's that?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Yumia Liessfeldt：</span><br>
It's a simple type of alchemy that can be done anywhere. It can be used to make ammunition, bandages, and things to use in combat.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Amity：</span><br>
One small issue. We use cannonballs, not bullets.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Yumia Liessfeldt：</span><br>
Well, when I got the recipes for the riggings, the data for the ammunition they use was also listed there.<br>
A cannonball is more or less like a large bullet, so I think I should be able to manage it with simple synthesis!<br>
Let me give it a try...<br>
It's done!<br>
Do you think this will work, Amity?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Amity：</span><br>
That was quick! Let me fire one...<br>
<br>
KABOOOM!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Amity：</span><br>
Wow, it actually works!<br>
And you really made these using materials we just picked up along the way?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Yumia Liessfeldt：</span><br>
Yes.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Amity：</span><br>
Well, I'll be... Alchemy is incredible.<br>

"This here's the Desert of Death. It's dominated by ruthless winds and sand. Careful not to die here! Mwahahaha!"<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Fu Shun：</span><br>
Careful not to die here! Mwahahaha!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Isla von Duerer：</span><br>
Wow, you really sound like a villain!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Nina Friede：</span><br>
Mhm... Purity hit the nail on the head with that name. This place really does remind me of death.<br>
Before we move on, we should prepare ourselves for a sandstorm.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Yumia Liessfeldt：</span><br>
We also have to be on the lookout for snakes and scorpions hiding in the sand. While they are top-rate materials, one bite or sting from them could spell disaster.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Portsmouth Adventure：</span><br>
Snakes 'n' scorpions, y'say... That reminds me! Accordin' to the ol' miracle remedy recipe I got ages ago, those'd make for perfect ingredients.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Fu Shun：</span><br>
I know the one! Besides those two, you can also use centipedes and the like!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Portsmouth Adventure：</span><br>
Centipedes? Yeah, bet there's a bunch of 'em 'round here... Y'know, that makes this place more like a desert of treasure than a desert of death!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Yumia Liessfeldt：</span><br>
By "miracle remedy," do you mean... the liquid in the bottle you sometimes take out?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Portsmouth Adventure：</span><br>
That's the one! Wanna try it?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Yumia Liessfeldt：</span><br>
Oh, um, thanks, but no thanks.<br>
Anyway, let's keep moving. We'll cross the desert and gather materials on the way!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Portsmouth Adventure：</span><br>
Awright! I'm gonna nab me some ingredients!<br>

<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Gallant：</span><br>
Fwee-fwee! Numerous ruins up ahead!<br>
And there's a sign, as expected!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Fu Po：</span><br>
"This is an abandoned outpost that belonged to the great forerunner Purity. The area beyond this point is extremely dangerous, so be thoroughly prepared!"<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Fu Shun：</span><br>
Hmph... She's letting her fame get to her head. Let's see how she likes a little rewrite...<br>
There!<br>
"This is an abandoned outpost that now belongs to the great Queen of Adventure Fu Shun. The area beyond this point is extremely dangerous, so be thoroughly prepared!"<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Amity & Fu Po：</span><br>
......<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Portsmouth Adventure：</span><br>
Ahahaha... So, do we keep goin'?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Yumia Liessfeldt：</span><br>
Hold on a minute, please. The area ahead might actually be as dangerous as the sign says.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Lenja：</span><br>
The road leading to the outpost... It's a concentrated manabound area...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Yumia Liessfeldt：</span><br>
Since the "mana" in this world is a lot like the real deal, a concentrated manabound area should work the same. I guess you could call it a concentrated pseudo-manabound area.<br>
Isn't that right, Flammi?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Flammi：</span><br>
Indeed, Yumia. It would be appropriate to refer to this place as a concentrated pseudo-manabound area.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Fu Shun：</span><br>
Teach, I have a question!<br>
What is this "mana" you've been talking about? I've been wondering for a while now, and I haven't seen any trace of it!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Yumia Liessfeldt：</span><br>
Well, you need a rather unique ability to be able to see mana.<br>
While I can't explain how the pseudo-mana in this place is formed, I can explain a thing or two about regular mana.<br>
When a life returns to the earth, the memories and feelings etched into their soul turn into mana that builds up in the land.<br>
Alchemists are able to take this mana and directly "control" it, in a way.<br>
Manipulating mana, creating a recipe from the stored memories, and offering up materials to reconstruct something...<br>
That is what alchemy is.<br>
Mana by itself is also an all-purpose source of energy that we use in our day-to-day lives.<br>
However, when the mana gets too concentrated, it can have various effects on the human body.<br>
When a person without proper protection is exposed to too much mana at once, they might start feeling dizzy or get a headache. In especially bad cases, they could even lose consciousness or worse.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Fu Po：</span><br>
An all-purpose source of energy? That sounds quite a lot like the Wisdom Cubes we use.<br>
Although, those exist in the form of physical cubes, and they can't turn into some invisible matter.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Fu Shun：</span><br>
Sounds to me like we should explore this concentrated manabound area right now!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Isla von Duerer：</span><br>
Sure, that'd be great... but it's not that simple.<br>
It's really dangerous to enter a place with high mana concentrations without protection.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Fu Shun：</span><br>
Yeah? So? We're not just regular people! We're shipgirls!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Nina Friede：</span><br>
And this isn't just regular mana either, remember?<br>
While Yumia does have a way to lead us through this manabound area safely, you still shouldn't go in recklessly.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Fu Shun：</span><br>
Fine... In that case, when are we going in, Yumia?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Yumia Liessfeldt：</span><br>
It's gotten pretty late. I think we should stay at this outpost until tomorrow.<br>
Plus, we've gathered most of the ingredients needed for the riggings, and I want to finish them by tonight!<br>
<br>
Later that night...<br>
After thorough preparations...<br>
And a careful synthesis process...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Yumia Liessfeldt：</span><br>
It's done! I've finally synthesized the riggings!<br>
Look, Flammi! They're so pretty.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Flammi：</span><br>
It is Flammi's belief that these riggings were not created plainly through alchemy – rather, they also incorporate some unique technology from this world.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Yumia Liessfeldt：</span><br>
So it's the product of two different technologies...<br>
Did Purity also invent it? I'd really love to meet her in person.<br>
<br>
*knock knock*<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Isla von Duerer：</span><br>
Yumia, got a moment? We have a problem!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Yumia Liessfeldt：</span><br>
I just got done here. What is it?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Isla von Duerer：</span><br>
This...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Yumia Liessfeldt：</span><br>
What's this? A letter?<br>
"We're setting out on an adventure! Don't worry, we'll be back before you know it! Yours truly, Queen of Adventure Fu Shun."<br>
Oh no... They went to the concentrated pseudo-manabound area, didn't they?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Nina Friede：</span><br>
Probably. By the time we found this letter, those girls were nowhere to be seen.<br>
I'd wager they went into the valley not far from here.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Isla von Duerer：</span><br>
We gotta go now and save them!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Lenja：</span><br>
Th-they'll put themselves in danger at this rate!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Yumia Liessfeldt：</span><br>
Luckily, I just finished our riggings. They'll prove useful on our journey through this world. I also added some handy features!<br>
For instance, they have storage space able to fit a lot of cargo and defensive systems similar to a mana core.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Isla von Duerer：</span><br>
Ooh... So you're saying we can move around freely in the concentrated manabound area as long as we have these riggings?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Yumia Liessfeldt：</span><br>
In theory, yes. Although, it's possible that they'll only protect us from the pseudo-mana in this place and not regular mana.<br>
It's interesting how they're so similar, yet subtly different... I'd love to know the principle behind pseudo-mana.<br>
Ah, right, now's not the time to be thinking about that!<br>
Let's get ourselves in order and go rescue them!<br>

<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Lenja：</span><br>
Yumia, they should be somewhere close!<br>
We'll find them any moment now!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Yumia Liessfeldt：</span><br>
It's reassuring to have you here, Lenja! Thanks for always helping!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Lenja：</span><br>
O-of course! Thank you! B-by the way... There's another sign over there...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Isla von Duerer：</span><br>
She really left one in a place as dangerous as this?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Yumia Liessfeldt：</span><br>
Let's have a look.<br>
"The Great Rift Valley, as you might expect, is a very large valley. Head to the entrance and you'll see how to get through. From Purity."<br>
Well, her naming sense leaves little guesswork.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Lenja：</span><br>
...I found them! All three of them... over there!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Isla von Duerer：</span><br>
Oh no! They're all on the ground! Don't tell me they've passed out!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Gallant：</span><br>
Fwee... Zzz...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Fu Po：</span><br>
This is... the perfect plan... Zzz...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Fu Shun：</span><br>
Time for adventure... Zzz...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Lenja：</span><br>
Their breathing is stable... They're talking in their sleep. I think they might just be sleeping.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Isla von Duerer：</span><br>
Wow, uh... They really fell asleep in the middle of a concentrated manabound area, huh?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Nina Friede：</span><br>
I suppose shipgirls must really be quite different from regular people.<br>

<br>
As the three adventurers awoke, they found themselves in strange, new surroundings, prompting much confusion.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Gallant：</span><br>
A warm fireplace and a slick chandelier... Are we back at the port?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Fu Po：</span><br>
Maybe we never even left the port in the first place, and it was all a dream?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Fu Shun：</span><br>
Dream? No... My adventure into another world couldn't have been just a dream!<br>
<br>
*knock knock*<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Isla von Duerer：</span><br>
Hi!<br>
Are you girls feeling good? No pain, no nausea?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Fu Po：</span><br>
Isla? You're... here?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Isla von Duerer：</span><br>
Well, yeah?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Gallant：</span><br>
So you're back at the port, too?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Isla von Duerer：</span><br>
I'm what? What are you talking about?<br>
Oh no. Don't tell me this is some kind of mana symptom...<br>
Yumia, come here! I need you!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Yumia Liessfeldt：</span><br>
What's wrong?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Isla von Duerer：</span><br>
I think they're experiencing memory problems.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Fu Shun：</span><br>
Y-Yumia? So even you came back with us!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Yumia Liessfeldt：</span><br>
Come again? What do you mean?<br>
Um, what's the last thing you can all remember?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Gallant：</span><br>
I was in the corridor leading to the office, putting up an "under construction" sign.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Fu Po：</span><br>
I was drafting an adventurous plan to save Fei Yuen.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Fu Shun：</span><br>
And I was writing a 10,000-word-long apology while An Shan kept watch on me...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Isla von Duerer：</span><br>
Psst. See? Something's up with them.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Yumia Liessfeldt：</span><br>
Now, this is just a guess...<br>
But I think you're having difficulties distinguishing between your dreams and what happened in reality.<br>
I have a question, so please listen.<br>
Do any of you remember sneaking off into a concentrated pseudo-manabound area on an adventure just a short while ago?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Fu Po：</span><br>
An adventure in a concentrated pseudo-manabound area...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Gallant：</span><br>
Now that you mention it... Yes, it feels like we did.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Fu Shun：</span><br>
So what you're saying is that WASN'T a dream?<br>
But then... where are we?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Isla von Duerer：</span><br>
We're in the resting room of the L2 area of the Skynexus Tower!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Fu Shun：</span><br>
Wait, the L2 area? How the heck did we get here?<br>
What happened to that endless valley we saw? Did we pass through it?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Yumia Liessfeldt：</span><br>
We found you near the valley. You'd fallen into a deep slumber as a side effect of the concentrated pseudo-mana.<br>
So we simply brought you right back to the outpost.<br>
You still hadn't woken up by the time we got back, so we decided to head out and bring you with us.<br>
We managed to come all this way safely thanks to the zip lines that Purity set up.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Fu Shun：</span><br>
Aww, man... That was such a big and spectacular valley! It was meant to be a challenging chapter along our adventure!<br>
Darn you, Purity! You're too helpful!<br>
Don't get me wrong, I appreciate the help, but it takes all the fun out of the adventure!<br>

Chapter 4<br>
Ruin Stratum<br>
Height above sea level: Approximately 6 km<br>
The group rode the reactivated elevator up and set foot inside a new area.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Fu Shun：</span><br>
"This is the Haunted Mountain. There are honest-to-god ghosts roaming around, so it'd be perfect for a haunted house. Shame there wouldn't be any customers. From Purity."<br>
Yeah... That is a real shame.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Fu Po：</span><br>
Gh-ghosts...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Amity：</span><br>
I have a bad feeling about this.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Yumia Liessfeldt：</span><br>
I see one! Take aim... Fire!<br>
<br>
BANG!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Fu Po：</span><br>
You shot it, just like that?!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Yumia Liessfeldt：</span><br>
Well, it might be dangerous to just leave it there.<br>
Plus, it's a type of monster we haven't seen before, so I might get some new material from it.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Portsmouth Adventure：</span><br>
...There're materials to get from somethin' that fades away into nothin'?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Yumia Liessfeldt：</span><br>
Of course there are. It could be a gas, for instance.<br>
Who knows? It might even yield something you could use as a secret ingredient in your miracle remedy!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Portsmouth Adventure：</span><br>
Oh yeah! Ahahaha! Then it's ghost-bustin' time!<br>
C'mon, lassies! The hunt is on!<br>

{{折叠面板|标题=City of Ruins|选项=26|主框=1|样式=primary|展开=是}}
<br>
Having collected enough materials to meet their needs, the group left the Haunted Mountains behind.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Gallant：</span><br>
"This is the City of Ruins. Who do you think wrecked it?"<br>
"Also, if you want the treasure I left, you'll have to go looking for it! From Purity."<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Fu Po：</span><br>
"Who wrecked it"? Is she hinting that she had a fierce battle with someone here?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Yumia Liessfeldt：</span><br>
Maybe with some monsters?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Fu Po：</span><br>
Doubt it. Those monsters weren't much of a fight for us, were they?<br>
And, while it pains me to admit it, Purity's firepower is leagues better than ours.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Amity：</span><br>
Then it seems she fought and won if she still had the strength to place a sign here.<br>
That, to me, suggests we don't have to be very concerned about the enemy.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Fu Shun：</span><br>
That leaves the treasure hunt as our number one focus, then!<br>
And as everyone knows, ruins without treasure are like fries without ketchup!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Amity：</span><br>
Ah, I just remembered – finding treasure is what Portsmouth and I came here for in the first place!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Lenja：</span><br>
Look, everyone... There's a box over by that wall. If I'm not mistaken... isn't it a treasure chest?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Isla von Duerer：</span><br>
Whoa, you're right! It IS a treasure chest!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Fu Shun：</span><br>
Then we just need to look for the key!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Yumia Liessfeldt：</span><br>
We don't need a key to open it. Let me take care of it!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Fu Shun：</span><br>
What? But how are you gonna open the chest without a key?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Yumia Liessfeldt：</span><br>
With chests like this, you can just...<br>
Hiyah!<br>
There. Let's see what's inside.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Gallant：</span><br>
I never considered simply breaking it open...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Fu Po：</span><br>
That's right! I should've realized! There's no need to look for a key if you can just smash open the chest!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Yumia Liessfeldt：</span><br>
Here you go. Here's Fu Shun's share, and here's Portsmouth Adventure's share. Take everything you want.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Portsmouth Adventure：</span><br>
Bloody Nora! It's actual treasure! We oughta see if there're any more boxes around!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Fu Shun：</span><br>
Treasure hunt tiiime!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Gallant：</span><br>
Fwee-fwee! Let's go!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Isla von Duerer：</span><br>
Oh boy... They all ran off.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Yumia Liessfeldt：</span><br>
Heheh. It's more efficient to split up.<br>

"This is the L3 area of the Skynexus Tower. It leads to the Skynexus Peak. Your last battle before the final showdown."<br>
"You know the drill! Head straight for the elevator!"<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Nina Friede：</span><br>
We're finally almost at the end.<br>
I don't know when it's coming, but I know I'm tense for it.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Lenja：</span><br>
Hang in there... Purity.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Nina Friede：</span><br>
The place of our final battle... That should mean we're getting close to the summit.<br>
So far, the elevator has taken us up three plateaus...<br>
It's no wonder why it's called the Skynexus Tower... It really is reaching for the sky.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Yumia Liessfeldt：</span><br>
Yeah. It's a shame the tower was in ruins by the time we got here. I wish I could've seen it in its original state.<br>
It must've been a magnificent sight to behold...<br>
Well, we all know what to do – how about we stay the night here, then ascend tomorrow?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Fu Shun：</span><br>
Good idea! I propose we all do our own things until then!<br>
The Great Rift Valley isn't far from here, and I wanna go adventuring in it!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Yumia Liessfeldt：</span><br>
I mean... You didn't see the zip lines we took earlier, so I doubt you'll be able to cross it.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Fu Shun：</span><br>
I might be able to jump across the gap if I really rev the engines on my rigging!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Yumia Liessfeldt：</span><br>
What if you don't? Will your rigging handle the impact if you fall?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Fu Shun：</span><br>
Hmm... Probably not.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Yumia Liessfeldt：</span><br>
Then I'd reconsider that idea if I were you.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Fu Shun：</span><br>
Ahaha... I was just kidding anyway!<br>
All I really want to do is go to the edge and snap some photos.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Lenja：</span><br>
Speaking of the rift... I'd actually like to see more of it...<br>
Do you mind if I... come with you?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Fu Shun：</span><br>
Be my guest! Let's go on an adventure, you and me!<br>

<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Portsmouth Adventure：</span><br>
Ahh... Sea breeze, crashin' waves. A treasure hunter's only truly free if she's ridin' on the open seas!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Amity：</span><br>
Agreed. I've had enough of running around on land.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Isla von Duerer：</span><br>
Hang on! We're really high up! Even higher than the clouds!<br>
What's a sea doing all the way up here?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Amity：</span><br>
Did you forget about the Sea of Rot from earlier?<br>
This is just how ancient ruins work. Don't think too deeply about it.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Isla von Duerer：</span><br>
...Is it?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Amity：</span><br>
Anyway, you all have riggings now, but you've never set sail like us before.<br>
Now's the perfect opportunity. Time to get used to your new fighting style!<br>

<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Fu Po：</span><br>
Looks like we can't go any further...<br>
The buildings up ahead are unnaturally well-preserved. Is it because of this barrier?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Fu Shun：</span><br>
I noticed something especially odd. I don't know if you girls noticed, but...<br>
There aren't any signs left by Purity around here!<br>
Didn't that last sign say something about a final showdown?<br>
The stuff in the barrier doesn't show any traces of conflict, and there aren't any signs. You don't think...?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Nina Friede：</span><br>
Let's not jump to conclusions. For now, let's investigate everything.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Yumia Liessfeldt：</span><br>
Hmm... This barrier is entirely made up of pseudo-mana.<br>
There might be a way to dispel it.<br>
I'll give it a try.<br>
<br>
Yumia put a hand on the barrier and sensed the current of pseudo-mana coursing within.<br>
When she did, a new scene appeared to her.<br>
Inside a storm, an army of steel fiercely attacked the barrier.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Purity：</span><br>
This barrier's weird. It's not the product of normal technology, that's for sure.<br>
Did a concept from the outside make it, or something? Like alchemy?<br>
If so... something from that world might tell me how to get rid of it.<br>
Let's go take a look.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Yumia Liessfeldt：</span><br>
What is this? Did the memories in the pseudo-mana just manifest as an illusion?<br>
This really is unlike the mana I know, and yet... it's interesting.<br>
Is that person Purity?<br>
...Hello?<br>
Hey, thanks for guiding us all this way, okay?<br>
...Haha, what am I doing?<br>
Okay, back to work...<br>

<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Yumia Liessfeldt：</span><br>
I'm done!<br>
We should be able to move on now!<br>
<br>
With those words from Yumia, the group was transported into a city made out of steel.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Isla von Duerer：</span><br>
Hey, why did we just suddenly get warped into the middle of a city?!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Yumia Liessfeldt：</span><br>
I don't know. I didn't do anything special.<br>
All I did was slightly retune the pseudo-mana constituting the barrier.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Fu Shun：</span><br>
I've got it! This is a Mirror Sea – a Siren invention!<br>
We entered it as soon as you dispelled the barrier!<br>
I KNEW these ruins were tied to the Sirens somehow!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Nina Friede：</span><br>
Did you say "sea"? But how can this be a sea if we're inside a city?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Fu Shun：</span><br>
Good question. The answer is...<br>
I don't know!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Yumia Liessfeldt：</span><br>
I... see...<br>

{{折叠面板|标题=Skynexus Tower: Top|选项=31|主框=1|样式=primary|展开=是}}
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Gallant：</span><br>
Fwee-fwee! Look, girls! There's also a section of the tower here!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Nina Friede：</span><br>
Seems to be the top.<br>
It's completely intact, too. Unlike every other place we've seen so far.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Lenja：</span><br>
There's another barrier sealing off the entrance...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Yumia Liessfeldt：</span><br>
Another one...<br>
Alright, I'll have a look and see what data is recorded in it.<br>
<br>
Purity stared fixedly at the entrance at the top of the tower.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Purity：</span><br>
Here we go again...<br>
The enemies and the layout on the way here – they weren't how Observer usually does things.<br>
Heh.<br>
First there was the Virtual Tower, with some weird connection to the Arbiters...<br>
And now, there's a shady-ass Skynexus Tower.<br>
Is this your doing, DOS?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Yumia Liessfeldt：</span><br>
DOS...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Fu Shun：</span><br>
Deo... ess?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Yumia Liessfeldt：</span><br>
Does it ring any bells for you?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Fu Shun：</span><br>
Nope!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Amity：</span><br>
I've certainly never heard of it. What about it?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Yumia Liessfeldt：</span><br>
I think it may very well be the enemy we're fighting.<br>
That's what Purity said.<br>
I mean, we've come this far, and I don't think there's any turning back at this point, so...<br>
<br>
BANG!<br>
Yumia suddenly fired a shot, causing a folded-up ladder up ahead to drop down.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Yumia Liessfeldt：</span><br>
I expect this next battle will determine whether we get to go home or not.<br>
Let's get ourselves pumped and ready!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Fu Shun：</span><br>
Whoa! That's a sick way of bringing down a ladder!<br>
Gotta take notes. It's bound to come in handy on my next adventure!<br>

<br>
With their guards up yet their curiosity unmasked, the group rapidly ascended to the top of the tower.<br>
Unlike all the previous times, there was nothing dividing the area at the top into clearly distinct zones.<br>
There was simply a vast space covered with water, and buildings dotting the seascape like islands.<br>
Even the expansive space overhead wasn't divided into strata like previously, extending all the way from the water to the highest point – an artificial sky shining like a green star.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Nina Friede：</span><br>
To think a space this vast could exist inside a building...<br>
The Sirens really possess some incredible technology.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Fu Shun：</span><br>
They sure do. It's not so nice when they're your enemy, though.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Yumia Liessfeldt：</span><br>
Your rigging technology is incredible in its own right.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Fu Shun：</span><br>
You think so? I'd say alchemy is more wow-worthy.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Yumia Liessfeldt：</span><br>
No, I really think riggings are the more impressive technology. There's still so much I don't know about them.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Fu Shun：</span><br>
If we're going by that metric, then alchemy's easily the more impressive one!<br>
Because I don't know the first dang thing about it!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Isla von Duerer：</span><br>
Ahahaha...<br>
<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Lenja：</span><br>
Everyone, be careful... I-I think our opponent is right over there!<br>
<span style="color:#ff9b93;">???：</span><br>
......<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Fu Shun：</span><br>
Are you that DOS we heard about?<br>
Then it's you who arranged this adven– I mean, this evil scheme!<br>
<span style="color:#ff9b93;">???：</span><br>
......<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Fu Shun：</span><br>
So you admit it!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Isla von Duerer：</span><br>
But she didn't even say anything.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Fu Shun：</span><br>
Her silence means she isn't denying it!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Isla von Duerer：</span><br>
I... guess so?<br>
<span style="color:#ff9b93;">???：</span><br>
......<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Gallant：</span><br>
Fwee-fwee! Be on your guard! She's coming toward us!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Portsmouth Adventure：</span><br>
Just have to take this wee ruin guardian out! Then we resume our treasure hunt!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Yumia Liessfeldt：</span><br>
Be careful, everyone!<br>
<br>
<br>
KABOOOM!<br>
Faced with the group's coordinated attacks, it wasn't long before the enemy succumbed.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Yumia Liessfeldt：</span><br>
Nice teamwork! That's a wrap!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Lenja：</span><br>
Yumia... The enemy's wreckage, it's... Something's happening to it!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Yumia Liessfeldt：</span><br>
Wait... The surrounding pseudo-mana is starting to get chaotic!<br>
I think it's...<br>
<br>
A field of burning wreckages littered the sea's surface.<br>
They were most concentrated in the center, where two figures stood facing one another.<br>
<span style="color:#ff9b93;">？？？：</span><br>
So you, an experiment program, have developed a personality and aspirations...<br>
How fascinating...<br>
Care for a rematch?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Purity：</span><br>
I'm SUCH an idiot...<br>
I already knew the Arbiters were going to be tough opponents...<br>
I just didn't think the DOS would be such a handful...<br>
This is hopeless. I can't even scratch her.<br>
If it's come to this, there's only one choice left – to blow myself up!<br>
To whoever comes after me: I wish you luck!<br>
<br>
KABOOOM!<br>
<span style="color:#ff9b93;">？？？：</span><br>
I see.<br>
Heheh...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Isla von Duerer：</span><br>
...Yumia!<br>
...Yumia!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Yumia Liessfeldt：</span><br>
...Isla? What is it?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Isla von Duerer：</span><br>
You just froze up all of a sudden! You didn't even react to being in the air, so I got pretty worried.<br>
Are you okay?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Yumia Liessfeldt：</span><br>
Thanks. I'm fine. I just witnessed another fragment of the past, I think...<br>
Wait, what'd you say? In the air? Right now?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Isla von Duerer：</span><br>
Yeah! We're flying, Yumia!<br>
<br>
The group rode on an ascending air current above the top of the tower, soaring through the sky.<br>
All the previously scattered areas of the tower, too, rose up one by one, shaking violently while they recomposed.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Fu Po：</span><br>
The Skynexus Tower is rebuilding itself... Does that mean we did it? We won?<br>
<br>
Under the green light, the figures of all the members of the group became blurrier and blurrier.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Yumia Liessfeldt：</span><br>
Looks like it...<br>
Now we should all be able to go home.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Portsmouth Adventure：</span><br>
Hang on! Where's our treasure?! I haven't had a proper gander at our booty yet!<br>
Plus, we can't leave like this!<br>
Our ship! We still need our ship!<br>
Waaaaait!<br>

<br>
When the light subsided, a world of beautiful blue skies and quiet seas lay before the party.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Yumia Liessfeldt：</span><br>
This isn't Aladiss, is it?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Fu Shun：</span><br>
Oh... Our communications with the port are restored.<br>
Are we in the seas near the port?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Fu Po：</span><br>
Aw, crap! Chang Feng's on the phone!<br>
Lenja, answer it for me! Pretty please!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Lenja：</span><br>
Umm...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Fu Shun：</span><br>
I have a call from An Shan, too...<br>
Nina, you're so smart and pretty, why don't you answer it instead?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Nina Friede：</span><br>
Heehee! Oh, if you insist.<br>
You said this was a... "phone"? How do you use it?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Gallant：</span><br>
Ahhh... Warspite's about to give me a tongue-lashing, too...<br>
Flammi! You're a super-high-spec independent survey-assistance device, aren't you?<br>
You're the perfect candidate to answer the phone!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Flammi：</span><br>
First, Flammi will need to perform a scan on this object referred to as a "phone."<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Isla von Duerer：</span><br>
Wait...<br>
I thought we'd gone back to our home world from the Skynexus Tower, but I guess we're in a totally new place?<br>
This is kinda bad, isn't it?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Yumia Liessfeldt：</span><br>
Yeah... A little.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Fu Shun：</span><br>
It's cool! Now that we're in contact with port again, there's nothing to worry about!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Yumia Liessfeldt：</span><br>
Because...?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Fu Shun：</span><br>
Our port is used to entertaining guests from other worlds!<br>
And we have experience getting people home safe, too!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Yumia Liessfeldt：</span><br>
You mean it? Well, I'd love to take a look around before we go home – especially if it's full of shipgirls like you!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Isla von Duerer：</span><br>
Our adventure isn't over yet!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Fu Shun：</span><br>
Welcome, Aladiss Research Team, to our humble little port!<br>

While the Aladiss Research Team and adventure team made way for port...<br>
In a different sea area...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Portsmouth Adventure：</span><br>
Wait up! My ship still ain't baaaack!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Amity：</span><br>
Ahem... Settle down, Portsmouth. What is that floating over there?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Portsmouth Adventure：</span><br>
Is that... a ship? No, TWO ships?<br>
Did we make it back, ships 'n' all?!<br>
Thank GOD! I had tons o' treasure on that ship!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Amity：</span><br>
Yeah. We, and our ships, have made it back safely.<br>
And the treasures we got from those ruins are still here!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Portsmouth Adventure：</span><br>
For real...<br>
Hahaha, hell yeah! We're gettin' rich today!<br>
Heheh... With all this loot on hand, how 'bout we sail back to Tempesta HQ and show off a little?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Amity：</span><br>
I don't see why not. Let's regale them with stories of the adventure we've had.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Portsmouth Adventure：</span><br>
Treasure hunters we be, wild and free♪<br>
Onward we rampage, to where storms rage♪<br>
Anchors aweigh, we set sail today♪<br>
