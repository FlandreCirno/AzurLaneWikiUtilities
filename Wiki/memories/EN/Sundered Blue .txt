West of SP Island - Afternoon<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Princeton ：</span><br>
……<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Cleveland：</span><br>
Something wrong, Princeton? You look like you're in a bad mood.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Princeton ：</span><br>
Cleveland, don't you think our current operation... is a bit too conservative?<br>
We know SP Island has already been occupied, but all we're doing is staking out over here waiting for the Sakura Empire to strike first...<br>
With our current strength, we can make a decisive preemptive strike!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Montpelier：</span><br>
Cleve, I also think we should make the first move.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Cleveland：</span><br>
I get how both of you feel. I don't think it'd be a bad idea either, but...<br>
It's been a few days since we last got a report from our submarine fleet, so the Sakura Empire's fleet should already be nearby.<br>
...Given the situation, the Naval HQ decided that the best thing to do is play it safe and stick to defense. It's best not to underestimate the enemy, right?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Birmingham：</span><br>
Until we get a clearer grasp of where the enemy is, I agree that sticking to defense is the safer bet.<br>
We may have more submarines and surface ships, but we could still lose if we get ambushed. Let's just play it safe.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Montpelier：</span><br>
I see... That's a good point...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Princeton ：</span><br>
What would Saratoga do... at a time like this...?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Enterprise：</span><br>
It seems that you all have an opinion on this mission.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Princeton ：</span><br>
Hm? Enterprise, were you listening in?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Enterprise：</span><br>
Yeah. Honestly, I'd like to make a move as well. We've been winning battle after battle, so we're probably all being influence by the high morale going around.<br>
However, the more drunk you are on victory, the harder it is to keep track of your surroundings. That's why we should be extra vigilant at this moment.<br>
Otherwise, even a single misstep can ruin everything we've built up to this point.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Princeton ：</span><br>
Indeed... It's just as you said.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Enterprise：</span><br>
...However, there's no need for us to follow every instruction to the letter.<br>
Our objective may be to just focus on protecting this area, but simply sticking to defense isn't the way our fleet does things.<br>
As the command ship, I cannot leave this area, but... I'd like to send a fleet to the surrounding islands to establish air superiority and clear out potential obstacles to our operation.<br>
Princeton, can I entrust you with this mission?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Princeton ：</span><br>
Ah?! Y-yes! Please leave it to me!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Enterprise：</span><br>
Alright. Next, I'll be assigning the escorts. Reno, Cleveland... I'd like one ship from each of your ship classes.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Montpelier：</span><br>
Cleve, would it be okay for me to go on this mission?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Cleveland：</span><br>
Hmm... I think... Birmingham should do it this time.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Birmingham & Montpelier：</span><br>
Huh?!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Cleveland：</span><br>
You can be a little impulsive, so I'd like you to stick with me and back me up. I'll leave the anti-air to you!<br>
Birmingham is a bit more cautious, so she'd probably be a good fit as an escort. Think you're up for it?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Birmingham：</span><br>
If you say so... I don't have a problem with it.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Enterprise：</span><br>
Alright, then it's decided. Princeton, Reno, Birmingham. Your mission is to neutralize the air forces of the Sakura Empire in the perimeter of the area.<br>
If you encounter the enemy's main fleet, report back here. Don't push yourselves, and remember that we've got your backs.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Princeton ：</span><br>
Alright!<br>
(Neutralizing the enemy's air forces... it's a small mission, but it's time to focus!)<br>

<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Princeton ：</span><br>
A small number of Sakura Empire ships spotted up ahead. I wonder if they're the island's defense fleet.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Reno：</span><br>
What should we do, Princeton? Shall we engage?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Princeton ：</span><br>
There are no other ships in the vicinity, and no signs of the Sakura Empire flagship either... Alright, let's go!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Birmingham：</span><br>
Roger. Birmingham, ready for combat.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Reno：</span><br>
Alright, let's get to work!<br>

<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Reno：</span><br>
Princeton, you looked really cool out there!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Princeton ：</span><br>
...Hm? Really...?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Reno：</span><br>
You landed some great direct hits, and your timing was perfect as well! I was blown away!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Princeton ：</span><br>
That's because... I had a good teacher.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Birmingham：</span><br>
A good teacher...?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Princeton ：</span><br>
Yes. She's another carrier from the Union. Someone I admire - Saratoga.<br>
The way of fighting you were praising was also something I learned from her.<br>
Saratoga's fighting style might be far more stylish than mine... And it might be hard to see her influence if you only saw my performance...<br>
Though she can be a bit mischievous at times, her grasp of the flow of battle is unparalleled. Also...<br>
I've never seen anyone else command their planes as flawlessly as she does...<br>
All of the Eagle Union's twelve carriers are amazing in their own right, but Saratoga is just...<br>
<br>
...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Birmingham：</span><br>
(...How am I supposed to butt in?) A-ahem!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Princeton ：</span><br>
Ah! I'm sorry... I get really excited every time I start talking about Saratoga without even realizing it...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Reno：</span><br>
Don't sweat it~ I'm glad I now know how much you respect Saratoga!<br>
To be able to fight alongside someone you admire, and to be able to learn from them... I'm sure that's a great feeling!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Princeton ：</span><br>
I'm so glad you understand!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Birmingham：</span><br>
Princeton... You and Montpelier seem to have some things in common.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Princeton ：</span><br>
We do...?？<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Birmingham：</span><br>
Yeah, that really deep admiration of someone. Wait... I'm getting a message from my sister...<br>
...Shoot! It's an enemy air raid! Everyone, prepare for combat!<br>

West of SP Island — Eagle Union's Main Fleet<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Enterprise：</span><br>
So, the Sakura Empire's fleet is finally launching its attack...<br>
Just what we were waiting for! Everyone, prepare for combat!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Cleveland：</span><br>
Enterprise, I've already relayed the information to Princeton and co. They said they'd be coming to join up with us once they finish taking care of the enemy's remnants.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Enterprise：</span><br>
Got it. The enemy's air forces shouldn't be as strong as they were before, but... don't let your guard down. We're engaging the enemy, full force!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Montpelier：</span><br>
Ready over here too. Don't let the enemy get close!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Enterprise：</span><br>
I'm not planning on letting any through... But if any do make it past me, I'll leave that to you.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Cleveland：</span><br>
Sure thing! Hehe, let's take care of them in one fell swoop!<br>

{{折叠面板|标题=Intercepting the Enemy|选项=5|主框=1|样式=primary|展开=否}}
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Princeton ：</span><br>
I've wrapped things up here as well. We should head back and rejoin the main fleet...<br>
Huh? What's this signal?!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Reno：</span><br>
Princeton, what's wrong?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Princeton ：</span><br>
We've been discovered by their planes! Everyone, prepare to intercept them!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Birmingham：</span><br>
No way... Could there be an enemy carrier nearby?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Reno：</span><br>
Princeton! Birmingham! They're coming!<br>
<span style="color:#ec5d53;">Taihou：</span><br>
...<br>
Ahahaha... How shall I break you all...?.<br>

{{折叠面板|标题=Tradeoffs|选项=6|主框=1|样式=primary|展开=否}}
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Birmingham：</span><br>
The enemy's attack force has retreated. Now leaving combat.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Reno：</span><br>
Judging from the scale of that attack... Was it just one ship? Either way...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Princeton ：</span><br>
Judging from that squad's combat power, we're probably not dealing with their main fleet. Maybe their forces are split up right now, or their airpower could just be lower than we expected.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Birmingham：</span><br>
Sakura Empire's main fleet seems to be a separate force heading towards SP Island. I wonder if Cleve and the others are okay...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Princeton ：</span><br>
We have seven carriers as well as a massive convoy here. I'm sure they'll be fine.<br>
Most importantly, Enterprise is there too, so everything in the sky is going to be-<br>
Well, basically, if we can neutralize the enemy's airpower, we'll be able to establish air superiority.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Birmingham：</span><br>
And without air control, the enemy will not be able to stop our advance no matter how many big guns they have...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Reno：</span><br>
The side that controls the sky controls the flow of battle.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Princeton ：</span><br>
Yeah. I'm sure the Sakura Empire understands too. That's probably why they're contesting right now.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Birmingham：</span><br>
Reno, Princeton. I've received a message from the others.<br>
Apparently, a friendly submarine has landed a hit on a powerful Sakura Empire carrier.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Reno：</span><br>
A friendly submarine... If I recall correctly, I think Albacore and Cavalla were around in these waters.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Birmingham：</span><br>
Hopefully, this will sow some chaos among the enemy fleet.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Princeton ：</span><br>
(Even though the submarine got a good hit on their carrier, I doubt a Sakura Empire carrier would sink just from that. Even Saratoga has taken plenty of hits.)<br>
(But now, the enemy will have to be more vigilant in their lookout for submarines... right?)<br>
(Things don't seem to be going badly at all. Let's hurry and group up with the main fleet.)<br>

<span style="color:#ec5d53;">Shoukaku：</span><br>
Zuikaku, Taihou seems to have been hit by a torpedo.<br>
<span style="color:#ec5d53;">Zuikaku：</span><br>
How'd an Eagle Union submarine find its way here? Shoukaku, tell the destroyers to be on high alert. Let's find out who attacked us!<br>
<span style="color:#ec5d53;">Shoukaku：</span><br>
Indeed. With such a large strike force, we'll have to make proper use of it.<br>
<span style="color:#ec5d53;">Zuikaku：</span><br>
That's right! I'll have to teach them not to underestimate the strength of the Sakura Empire's Air Fleet!<br>
<span style="color:#ec5d53;">Shoukaku：</span><br>
Hehehe, I wonder if it's time to play a requiem with this flute~<br>
<br>
West of SP Island - Princeton's Fleet<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Princeton ：</span><br>
Birmingham, what were you saying earlier about me and Montpelier?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Birmingham：</span><br>
Oh... I was just making a little remark. Don't worry about it~<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Princeton ：</span><br>
That's not what I meant. You know how originally the Independence class was designed to be Cleveland-class ships?<br>
I really wanted to get to know all of you a bit better, like Biloxi and the others... but I never really had the opportunity to do so.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Birmingham：</span><br>
Sisters, huh. I don't know them as well as the Columbia-class girls, but if that's fine, then...<br>
First should be Cleveland. She's always confident and a moodmaker. She's everyone's cool big sis.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Princeton ：</span><br>
No wonder you look up to her.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Birmingham：</span><br>
Next would be Columbia. She's really friendly with Cleve... Maybe it's just her teasing her, though.<br>
And then would be Montpelier and Denver. They both admire Cleve and aim to be like her, but they're working towards that in different ways.<br>
Then, there's...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Princeton ：</span><br>
(Montpelier has Cleveland's back... It's like me with Saratoga...)<br>
(Hehe, I might get along with her.)<br>

{{折叠面板|标题=The Second Strike|选项=8|主框=1|样式=primary|展开=否}}
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Princeton ：</span><br>
We've spotted more squadrons of planes from the Sakura Empire. There are more this time around.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Reno：</span><br>
They're not going to let us join up with the main fleet that easily...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Princeton ：</span><br>
No... What if they've made us their primary targets rather than going after our main fleet?<br>
(There's no way they'd half-heartedly send a squad of this size to attack Enterprise and our main fleet... Could this squadron be coming from a different enemy force?)<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Birmingham：</span><br>
Do you know what's happening on their side?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Princeton ：</span><br>
"See what someone is thinking, and you can see their future." That's what Saratoga (as a prankster) told me.<br>
In any case, I don't think I'll be able to handle these numbers by myself. I'll have to get some anti-air support.<br>
Contact Enterprise. We'll guide their interceptors to neutralize the enemy air squadrons.<br>
And... we'll hold out until they arrive. Reno, Birmingham. Please cover me!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Reno & Birmingham：</span><br>
Leave it to me!<br>
Roger.<br>

<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Princeton ：</span><br>
There's too many of them... At this rate, we're going to be in trouble!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Reno：</span><br>
Everyone, be careful! New, unknown planes are approaching us from over there!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Birmingham：</span><br>
Are they seriously pulling out all the stops to attack us...?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Reno：</span><br>
Aren't we lucky? We're getting the VIP treatment today...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Princeton ：</span><br>
That means this is going to be a battle of will and endurance...!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Birmingham：</span><br>
Wait, I'm getting a visual on the unknown planes! They're from the Eagle Union fleet!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Princeton ：</span><br>
Those must be Enterprise's interceptors then!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Reno：</span><br>
Phew, you scared us~ ...Oh, Cleveland, you and others are here too!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Cleveland：</span><br>
Sorry we're late. Reno, Birmingham, Princeton, are you all okay?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Montpelier：</span><br>
Enterprise not only sent the interceptor squadron, but also asked me to bring support as well.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Princeton ：</span><br>
That means the enemies were focusing on us after all? Is Enterprise going to be alright?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Cleveland：</span><br>
Hehe, no need for you to worry! We've already taken care of that already!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Montpelier：</span><br>
That's why we've come here to help you out! Okay, let's go and wrap things up!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Princeton ：</span><br>
Roger! Everyone, get in anti-air formation and repel the enemy!<br>

<span style="color:#ec5d53;">Zuikaku：</span><br>
Damnit, Enterprise! ...Ugh, is it impossible to take down the Eagle Union's Task Force?<br>
<span style="color:#ec5d53;">Shoukaku：</span><br>
Zuikaku, calm down... *cough* *cough*... Let's withdraw for now and come up with a plan...<br>
I can't believe I let my guard down like that... just after Taihou took a torpedo hit as well...<br>
<span style="color:#ec5d53;">Zuikaku：</span><br>
Damn it...!<br>
...All right, Shoukaku, let's go...!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Enterprise：</span><br>
Princeton, have you wrapped things up on your end?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Princeton ：</span><br>
I appreciate the backup. Thanks to you, we were able to demolish the enemy's attack forces.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Enterprise：</span><br>
Not quite. We were able to focus on the enemy carriers because of the role you played in thinning their airpower. This battle was just the culmination of that hard work.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Birmingham：</span><br>
Thank goodness. I'm glad things worked out this time.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Enterprise：</span><br>
Also, I heard that our subs landed another hit on a different enemy carrier. That the enemy's attack forces haven't returned must be a sign that the enemy's in disorder.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Reno：</span><br>
I guess that means we can finally catch our breath for the time being... Well done, everyone~<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Princeton ：</span><br>
I wonder if we'll get an order to pursue the enemy fleet...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Enterprise：</span><br>
Perhaps. No matter how many ships they might have left, with our strength, we should be able to overwhelm them with few issues.<br>
However, it seems that the Naval HQ wants to switch to another operation and move us over to a new front.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Princeton ：</span><br>
I wish Saratoga was here to see my performance today...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Cleveland：</span><br>
Why don't you just tell her about it directly next time?<br>
Not just about the battle, but how you were shining brilliantly on the battlefield as you took down dozens of enemy planes! Ehehe.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Princeton ：</span><br>
...Hehe, maybe I'll do just that.<br>
(Though I'm still inexperienced, if I keep striving to learn everything I can from the battlefield, then...)<br>
...Maybe someday, I can be just like her...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Enterprise：</span><br>
It's not a goal you'll be able to reach easily, but I'll be cheering you on.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Princeton ：</span><br>
Enterprise... Yeah! Thanks, I'll do my best!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Cleveland：</span><br>
Yeah, I'll be cheering you on too!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Enterprise：</span><br>
(Hehe, it looks like we both have capable rookies following our footsteps, Saratoga.)<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Princeton ：</span><br>
Saratoga... I'll definitely catch up to you someday.<br>
May we fight together in the near future, once again.<br>
