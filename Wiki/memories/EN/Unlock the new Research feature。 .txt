Commander~ I've been looking for you, nya!<br>
Hurry, hurry, come here, nya! I have something good to show you!<br>
In light of recent events and the increasing technology of the Sirens, the top brass at the naval headquarters have become concerned, nya...<br>
As a result, research on decoding the Wisdom Cube's black box has been given the "Priority" designation, nya! That means–<br>
Ta-da~! Commander, with your hard work and my support, I'm proud to unveil the "Development Dock" and the "Tech Academy", nya!<br>
I'll explain, nya~! Decades ago, with the appearance of the Sirens and the "Wisdom Cube," ships gained the ability to manifest in human form, nya!<br>
Although the technology that has come with the Wisdom Cubes has allowed us to hold our ground against the Sirens, that alone will not allow us to make any breakthroughs, nya...<br>
For ships to be able to manifest as humans... the Wisdom Cube allows the collections of various feelings, emotions, and images from an unspecified number of people to take on a physical form... in other words, a "collective body," nya.<br>
In theory, even if there was a ship that never existed, as long as peoples' beliefs in their form and function were strong enough, we would be able to manifest them as well, nya!<br>
"How do we carry out that manifestation?" Unfortunately, I don't have the answer to that, nya...<br>
However, that's why the Tech Academy exists, nya! It is a place where the best brains from each camp come together to push the cutting edge of research, nya!<br>
Even if we don't understand it yet, as long as everyone works together, we will surely be able to unravel the mysteries of the Wisdom Cube, nya!<br>
... Until then, Akashi expects your continued support and patronyage at her shop. It'll be a pleasure doing business with you, nya~♪<br>

Commander, good work, nya!<br>
After countless hours of development, we've finally been able to manifest our first new comrade, nya!<br>
However, we still have much to learn about the hidden powers of the Wisdom Cube, nya.<br>
Even though this successful manifestation has allowed us to meet a powerful new ally, they are still in an incomplete state, nya.<br>
Priority ships can only reach their full potential when we further strengthen their "Cognition," nya!<br>
Discover specific "Blueprints" through the Tech Academy, and use them to further strengthen your comrade in the "Development Dock," nya!<br>
In addition to the Tech Academy, these blueprints can also be obtained during events, nya!<br>
If your head starts hurting from all the research, Akashi's shop is always open for you, nya~♪<br>
