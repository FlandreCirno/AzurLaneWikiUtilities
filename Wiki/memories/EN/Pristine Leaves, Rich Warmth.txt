Pristine Leaves, Rich Warmth<br>
Early in the morning, I arrive at a garden per Yat Sen's invitation.<br>
There she is, brewing tea amidst the budding greenery of late spring, the delicate aroma from the tea leaves swirling around her.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Yat Sen：</span><br>
Welcome, Commander.<br>
Please take a seat. I'll have the tea ready for you in just a moment.<br>
Hm? Did you notice the aroma of the tea leaves on your way here? That means you're about to enjoy a particularly high-quality batch~<br>
Heehee, there's no need to rush. Patience is necessary to fully bring out the essence in these leaves.<br>
Once submerged, the tea leaves slowly unfold as they are embraced by the dew of time, and thus their essence gradually dissolves into the warm water.<br>
Though we won't have to wait too long, shall we talk about something to pass the time?<br>
<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项1："Is this your hobby?"</span>'''''<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项2："Can you tell me more about this tea?"</span>'''''<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项3："What's special about this garden?"</span>'''''<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项4："How long does it take to brew this tea?"</span>'''''<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Yat Sen：</span><br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项1）</span>'''''Indeed. Whenever I have time to myself, I enjoy brewing tea by myself and enjoying the tranquility of nature.<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项1）</span>'''''If I were to borrow the words of my ancestors... "Invite the moon at night for company, face alone the twilight before sunrise," or something like that?<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项1）</span>'''''Of course, I've been refining my tea-brewing techniques ever since I invited you here.<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项1）</span>'''''Since you've taken time out of your busy schedule to be with me, I hope I will be able to show you proper hospitality with the best tea.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Yat Sen：</span><br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项2）</span>'''''This is called Longjing tea.<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项2）</span>'''''The flavor is subtle, with an orchid-like dignity and a refreshing aroma that uplifts your heart. It is my favorite.<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项2）</span>'''''If you would, Commander– "A cup filled, with no reason in mind; presented to those who love tea."<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Yat Sen：</span><br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项3）</span>'''''It is a most wonderful place. It is peaceful and elegant, and when the sun shines warmly in the sky, it makes your heart sing.<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项3）</span>'''''Is it to your liking as well, Commander? I'm glad to hear that. You're welcome to visit me whenever you'd like.<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项3）</span>'''''Whether it's enjoying tea, reading poetry, or taking in the night scenery together, I'm always willing to keep you company.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Yat Sen：</span><br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项4）</span>'''''It takes a while to draw out the aroma, but one must be careful not to brew for too long.<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项4）</span>'''''If the tea leaves are steeped for too long, the color will become dull, the fragrance will fade due to oxidation, and the essence of the tea will be lost.<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项4）</span>'''''And, of course, the taste will turn bitter. As they say, all things in moderation.<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项4）</span>'''''While some people enjoy this kind of taste, do be careful to watch the time carefully if you wish to fully appreciate the aroma.<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项4）</span>'''''A similar principle applies in how you treat your friends. Though, I'm sure you're already well-versed in that, heehee.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Yat Sen：</span><br>
I am handed a glass-colored teacup filled with the completed tea– the hot water, replete with the tea's essence, produces a rich white steam that wafts through the air.<br>
It's ready now, Commander. Please enjoy.<br>
Oh, but do remember to take your time. The tea is piping hot, after all.<br>
The exquisite Longjing tea swirls around in my cup like a green cloud. When I bring it closer, a refreshing aroma spreads through my nostrils.<br>
How picturesque and aromatic... As I feel Yat Sen's expectant gaze upon me, I feel compelled to deeply savor the tea without reservation.<br>
Did my tea meet your expectations, Commander?<br>
<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项1："Superb. A taste without equal."</span>'''''<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项2："It was beautiful, just like you."</span>'''''<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Yat Sen：</span><br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项1）</span>'''''"A taste without equal, a fragrance as pristine as the budding spring..." Heehee...<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项1）</span>'''''Thank you, Commander. I'm honored that you enjoyed my selection.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Yat Sen：</span><br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项2）</span>'''''"Though words of jest this may be, fine tea is much akin to a fine woman..."<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项2）</span>'''''A slight blush flutters across Yat Sen's cheeks.<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项2）</span>'''''Commander... hearing you compliment me with such flowery words is rather embarrassing...<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项2）</span>'''''But, umm... I'm honored you feel that way.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Yat Sen：</span><br>
...Heehee. Maybe I've been a bit too nervous this whole time~<br>
If you don't have any plans afterwards, would you like to take a stroll through the garden with me?<br>
Let yourself be surrounded by the fragrance, and your body and mind alike will be rejuvenated.<br>
Now then, Commander, please close your eyes, take in the aroma of the tea, and feel the warm sunlight caressing your cheeks.<br>
That's right. I'll be right here with you.<br>
