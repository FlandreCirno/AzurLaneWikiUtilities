Band of Bulins<br>
<br>
1 Band of Bulins<br>
It had been a day of exhausting work for the three Bulin sisters. Worn out and sleepy, they dozed off and went to dreamland...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Yat Sen：</span><br>
As the saying goes: pressing times create heroes. You must go forth and do what needs to be done.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Prototype Bulin MKII：</span><br>
Easy for you to say, bulin! We're just Bulins – we don't stand a chance against those freaky Sirens, bulin...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Specialized Bulin Custom MKIII：</span><br>
I smell negativity in the air, bulin. What's wrong, bulin?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Universal Bulin：</span><br>
Lookie, bulin! I found something tucked away in this corner, bulin!<br>
I think... Wow! It's a rainbow gear box, bulin!<br>
There's something written on it, bulin! Can anyone read it, bulin?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Specialized Bulin Custom MKIII：</span><br>
Hey, hands off, bulin! That's MY gear box, bulin!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Universal Bulin：</span><br>
Nuh-uh, bulin! Finders keepers, bulin!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Specialized Bulin Custom MKIII：</span><br>
If you don't give it back now, I'm gonna smack your basic rarity butt with my hammer, bulin!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Universal Bulin：</span><br>
Not if I block it with my wrenchy wrench, bulin!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Prototype Bulin MKII：</span><br>
No more fighting, bulin! Bulins of all colors are equal, bulin!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Bulins：</span><br>
- She's the one picking a fight with me, bulin! - You're dumb, bulin! Everyone knows URs are better than elites, bulin!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Prototype Bulin MKII：</span><br>
No, we're all heroes of equal standing, bulin! Instead of fighting among ourselves, we should form a league of bulins and fight the baddies, bulin!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Universal Bulin：</span><br>
I agree, bulin! We'll be like the Three Musketeers, bulin!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Specialized Bulin Custom MKIII：</span><br>
You know what, that sounds cool, bulin! All right, I'm in, bulin!<br>
<br>
The Bulins gathered beneath a peach tree. They raised their respective weapons to the skies and swore an oath.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">All Bulins：</span><br>
Today and onwards, the wrench, the drill, and the hammer will be as one – we shall unite, and together, we shall fight... bulin!<br>
<br>
Then, they embarked on their quest to rid the world of evil. What dangers lay in wait for them? They would soon find out...<br>

<br>
Finally, after enduring wave after wave of unrelenting attacks, Purifier showed an opening.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Prototype Bulin MKII：</span><br>
Now, bulin! Hit her with everything you've got, bulin!<br>
Taste this – my drill that pierces the heavens, bulin!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Universal Bulin：</span><br>
And my wrench that pierces the earth, bulin!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Specialized Bulin Custom MKIII：</span><br>
And my hammer that strikes down the stars, bulin!<br>
<span style="color:#ec5d53;">Purifier ：</span><br>
Gaghh! How is this possible?! How could a bunch of glorified resources defeat me?!<br>
<br>
Purifier was hit with a huge explosion. Once the smoke of it cleared, she ran away with her tail between her legs.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">All Bulins：</span><br>
We did it, bulin! We beat the big baddie, bulin!<br>
<br>
With their combined powers, the three Bulins put a stop to the Siren's invasion, and the world enjoyed a brief period of peace.<br>
And while the world could breathe easy now, the Bulins' quest had only just begun.<br>
What is the next challenge that awaits them in their dreams?<br>
Find out in the next episode! To be continued.<br>
<br>
<br>
After 50 fierce clashes with Purifier, Rainbow Bulin seemed to be in a losing position. But then, right on time...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Universal Bulin：</span><br>
The cavalry's here, bulin!<br>
<br>
<br>
Together, the two Bulins were able to rival Purifier's might. However, it would still take more than that to turn the tides of battle in their favor...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Prototype Bulin MKII：</span><br>
Have no fear, for I'm here, bulin!<br>
<span style="color:#ec5d53;">Purifier ：</span><br>
Hah! Go ahead, gang up on me – it won't make a difference!<br>
<br>
The three Bulins formed a circle around Purifier in the blink of an eye and commenced a battle of attrition against her.<br>
<br>
<br>
The Bulins grew stronger with each passing day as they refined their skills. Finally, one day came the opportunity to show the world the fruits of their training.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Hai Chi：</span><br>
Listen, everyone! A Siren big shot is at the door! She's saying she could take on ten of us at once without breaking a sweat!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Hai Tien：</span><br>
Uh-oh... If only our heavyweight champion Saratoga was here. She could mop the floor with her easily.<br>
<span style="color:#ec5d53;">Purifier ：</span><br>
Yo, yo, yooo! Purifier's back, baybeee! Is anyone gonna step up to my challenge, or are y'all a bunch of WUSSIES?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Specialized Bulin Custom MKIII：</span><br>
You sure talk big for a big fat nobody, bulin!<br>
<span style="color:#ec5d53;">Purifier ：</span><br>
Now those are fighting words, you half-pint! Who the hell are you?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Specialized Bulin Custom MKIII：</span><br>
Just call me Rainbow Bulin, bulin! But you're not getting the rainbow – you're gonna get the PAINbow, bulin!<br>
<span style="color:#ec5d53;">Purifier ：</span><br>
Oh yeah? We'll see about that! Show me whatcha got!<br>
