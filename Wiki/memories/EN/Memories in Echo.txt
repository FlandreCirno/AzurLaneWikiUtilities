<span style="color:#ffc960;">Helena META：</span><br>
It's been so long, yet this place hasn't changed one bit.<br>
<br>
The girl walked through the spacious streets, gazing at the desolate city.<br>
Her makeup was impeccable. She must have prepared thoroughly for this visit.<br>
<span style="color:#ffc960;">Helena META：</span><br>
It might have been spontaneous, but I was going to do this eventually anyway. I just did it a little sooner.<br>
<br>
The mechanical city responds to her words with rhythmic buzzing, as if in anticipation of something.<br>
"The calm before the storm..."<br>
<span style="color:#ffc960;">Helena META：</span><br>
Not yet... Wait just a while longer.<br>
<br>
After finding a decently comfortable spot, she sat down and began staring at the galactic waves unfolding in the distance.<br>
"How long it's been..."<br>
<span style="color:#ffc960;">Helena META：</span><br>
Recorder, start recording.<br>
<br>
It seemed that she had made up her mind.<br>
As she spoke, several small spheres equipped with camera lenses flew out from the armrest of her metal chair.<br>
<span style="color:#ffc960;">Helena META：</span><br>
Hello again, {playername}. By the time you see this recording, I'll...<br>
...No, this is a bad way to open.<br>
Okay... I'm soon going to go on a journey.<br>
With what little time I have left before I set off, I want to organize my thoughts and clear my mind.<br>
At the same time, I'm sure you still have many questions for me.<br>
So, today, I'm going to be more frank and casual with you.<br>
Yeah – I'm going to simply tell you things as they come to mind.<br>
Without further ado... Let's begin.<br>

<br>
"Where to begin..."<br>
<span style="color:#ffc960;">Helena META：</span><br>
Let's jump over the things I can't tell you about.<br>
First, I'll tell you about the surprise attack the Ashes launched on Zero. I'm sure you've already heard about it before.<br>
<br>
Several years ago, at the Ashes' base of operations...<br>
<span style="color:#ffc960;">Helena META：</span><br>
Enterprise, are you really going to carry out this plan?<br>
Zero has never once trusted us – more than that, I don't think she's trusted a single person ever, not even Antiochus.<br>
The location of her mainframe is knowledge that her very life depends on. There's no way she'll let us have it.<br>
That calls into question the credibility of the information we have currently.<br>
And basing a plan off of information you can't trust? There's no way that will end well.<br>
<span style="color:#ffc960;">Memphis META：</span><br>
Yeah. I agree with Helena.<br>
Even supposing this info is accurate, Zero has to know that we know about it.<br>
We've known about each other for a long time now. You don't believe she'll completely let her guard down, do you?<br>
<span style="color:#ffc960;">Enterprise META：</span><br>
No. She will be cautious.<br>
But, Zero is the core of the Observer System and the origin point of the Antiochus System's coordinates. Changing her location would come at an unfathomable cost.<br>
I know how her mind works. The Magister Plan is the only thing on her mind, and she's never cared about us. Why would she start caring about what we do now?<br>
There are only two possible outcomes from this operation. One: If the information is true, we'll confront Zero head-on, win, and reset her.<br>
Two: If it's false, then we simply wasted time and we'll retreat.<br>
That's all there is.<br>
Antiochus' strength is growing rapidly, and their methods are getting increasingly extreme.<br>
We're still strong enough to fight them... for now. But can we afford to wait much longer?<br>
If they outpace us, who else will be able to put an end to the Antiochus System's madness?<br>
You've all seen the tragedies that led us to where we are now.<br>
Does the end always justify the means as long as it's a just cause?<br>
They may not shy away from sacrificing themselves, but does that make it okay to sacrifice humanity?<br>
We've all been through hell. That doesn't mean we have to make innocent people go through the same hell, does it?<br>
The Magister Plan should be a chance to start over as much as we want, not be a boot that crushes life beneath its sole!<br>
<span style="color:#ffc960;">Helena META：</span><br>
...I understand. I'll fine-tune our equipment to hopefully raise our odds of success even a little.<br>
<span style="color:#ffc960;">Memphis META：</span><br>
I'll go tell the others. If we're going to do it, we might as well do it cleanly!<br>
<span style="color:#ffc960;">Enterprise META：</span><br>
Thanks.<br>
<br>
Sometime later, near the coast...<br>
<span style="color:#ffc960;">Helena META：</span><br>
We're doing it... We're carrying out the surprise attack.<br>
Tell me, SG... Do you think we'll succeed?<br>
<br>
Only the sound of overlapping waves rang out on the vast water.<br>
<span style="color:#ffc960;">Helena META：</span><br>
Ah, no... I shouldn't whine like that – all thoughtlessly.<br>
Yeah... I know.<br>
I joined Enterprise and fought by her side because I couldn't just tolerate Antiochus' madness.<br>
This will be nothing more than an even more dangerous battle...<br>
Antiochus were our last hope, and now they've gone rogue... We're the only ones who understand that, and have the power to stop them.<br>
When viewed that way, this is our only choice...<br>
Isn't that right, SG?<br>
{{折叠面板|内容结束}}

{{折叠面板|标题=VOICE #3|选项=3|主框=1|样式=primary|展开=是}}
<br>
"When viewed that way, this is our only choice..."<br>
<span style="color:#ffc960;">Helena META：</span><br>
I know there are many questions on your mind after seeing Antiochus' plans and the sacrifices they've made.<br>
But the Ashes' answer stayed the same. From beginning to end.<br>
And so, the day of our surprise attack came.<br>
I take it Renown and Repulse told you about what happened that day.<br>
It's true. We took our swing, and we missed.<br>
<br>
Somewhere, in an unknown location...<br>
<span style="color:#ffc960;">Helena META：</span><br>
There... I'm in. Enterprise, I'm picking up a signal from what I believe is Zero! She must be here!<br>
<span style="color:#ffc960;">Enterprise META：</span><br>
...All that's left is to pull the plug on the mainframe.<br>
<span style="color:#ffc960;">Memphis META：</span><br>
It won't be that easy. We've got several Arbiter vessels heading toward us.<br>
They'll be here in... three seconds!<br>
<span style="color:#ffc960;">Takao META：</span><br>
Maintain formation! All ships, draw your weapons!<br>
<span style="color:#ff9b93;">Arbiter: The Hermit IX：</span><br>
We know about your little ambush attempt. The jig is up.<br>
<span style="color:#ff9b93;">Arbiter: Temperance XIV：</span><br>
Even had it succeeded, the outcome of this battle would still be the same.<br>
<span style="color:#ff9b93;">Arbiter: Strength VIII：</span><br>
Now that your plan has failed, it's time to duke it out.<br>
<span style="color:#ffc960;">Repulse META ：</span><br>
I can't believe this was one of Antiochus' bloody experiments! Enterprise, Takao, we'll take care of the vessels!<br>
<span style="color:#ffc960;">Renown META ：</span><br>
Go after Zero! Hurry, Helena's hacking can't slow them down forever!<br>
<span style="color:#ffc960;">Helena META：</span><br>
More vessels approaching! Fusou, they're after you!<br>
<span style="color:#ffc960;">Fusou META：</span><br>
Understood. I shall see to their departures...<br>
<span style="color:#ff9b93;">Arbiter: The Empress III：</span><br>
Presumptuous insects. Your combined power amounts to nothing before us.<br>
<span style="color:#ffc960;">Hiryuu META：</span><br>
The Empress is here too, huh... That's how we know we're in the right place!<br>
<span style="color:#ff9b93;">Arbiter: The Empress III：</span><br>
Yes, and your overconfidence has led you to your doom. It seems you haven't learned from the past.<br>
I'll let you in on a secret. The Devil and Hierophant have taken control of your warp devices.<br>
Hanged Man and Death are converging upon you as we speak. Lovers, Moon, and Chariot will be here in five minutes. You fought so hard, only to be herded up like lambs to the slaughter. I pity you fools.<br>
<span style="color:#ffc960;">Enterprise META：</span><br>
So many Arbiters vessels... It'll be tough, but we can do it. Zero's brought the whole party to defend her mainframe.<br>
<span style="color:#ff9b93;">Arbiter: The Empress III：</span><br>
It's funny you should say her name. Zero was never here to begin with.<br>
<span style="color:#ffc960;">Enterprise META：</span><br>
...What?<br>
<span style="color:#ffc960;">Helena META：</span><br>
...Oh no. Memphis, carry out our evacuation plan!<br>
Enterprise, we need to break through this point to get out!<br>
<span style="color:#ffc960;">企业·META：</span><br>
Don't. They might just be bluffing.<br>
If Zero really wasn't here, why put all these Arbiters here?<br>
<span style="color:#ffc960;">Helena META：</span><br>
I know, but–<br>
Huh? What's this abnormal reading on my SG?!<br>
Wait, is that...?<br>
<span style="color:#ff9b93;">Arbiter: The Empress III：</span><br>
The only zero here is your probability of victory.<br>
<span style="color:#c3abff;">544845544F574552：</span><br>
41 75 74 68 65 6E 74 69 63 61 74 69 6E 67 2E<br>
<span style="color:#ffc960;">Helena META：</span><br>
Huh?<br>
<span style="color:#c3abff;">544845544F574552：</span><br>
43 6F 6E 66 69 72 6D 2E<br>

<span style="color:#ffc960;">Helena META：</span><br>
This feeling, is it...<br>
...You, SG?<br>

<br>
"Then, after that..."<br>
<span style="color:#ffc960;">Helena META：</span><br>
Where am I?<br>
It looks like I got caught in a rift and wound up in a foreign place...<br>
What is this place?<br>
<br>
Cities of steel stretched on endlessly in both the sky and on the sea, connecting with the horizon.<br>
<span style="color:#ffc960;">Helena META：</span><br>
Looks just like the space inside an Arbiter's mainframe...<br>
Could it be one? The completely undefended mainframe of a dormant Arbiter?<br>
...How could I have ended up here?<br>
Interestingly, I've never seen a ring like this in any other mainframe space.<br>
Based on its appearance, maybe it's the one that suddenly appeared that time when...<br>
<br>
The ring lay at rest in the city utterly devoid of sound. It was like it used every ounce of its energy in that last battle.<br>
<span style="color:#ffc960;">Helena META：</span><br>
Wait...<br>
SG, you can recognize the structure of this ring?!<br>
<br>
For some reason, a scan from her SG radar could completely reveal the inner structure of this ring – this culmination of Antiochus' technology.<br>
<span style="color:#ffc960;">Helena META：</span><br>
You... shouldn't be able to do that.<br>
It happened once before – you had a strange reaction to the ring appearing.<br>
Is there something that links you and this ring together?<br>
Why, then? Why... Why can't I remember anything?<br>
Anything to do with you should be important to me, yet I can't remember a thing for some reason.<br>
That's another thing I can't remember...<br>
It's been like that ever since we went through Laplace's Demon...<br>
God only knows how many important things I've forgotten...<br>
Well, looks like the ring isn't just out of power, but it's also suffered extensive internal damage.<br>
Are you showing me its innards because you want me to repair them?<br>
If I do... what will happen?<br>
Maybe all the memories I've lost...<br>
...Will come back to me?<br>
{{折叠面板|内容结束}}

<br>
"If I'm able to repair it..."<br>
<span style="color:#ffc960;">Helena META：</span><br>
In truth, even I can't explain why I got that hunch back then.<br>
Maybe I was frustrated that our mission had failed. Maybe I just really trusted my SG.<br>
Or maybe... The things I'd forgotten about were calling out to me in my heart of hearts.<br>
As if guided by destiny's hand...<br>
In short, it took me three years to finally and fully repair the ring.<br>
And by my own hands, I activated it.<br>
As I waited for it to charge up, I also waited for something else – an answer.<br>
<br>
The ring was filled with energy, and after such a long period of dormancy, it released a blinding light.<br>
Within that light, she heard the voice of an old friend.<br>
<span style="color:#c3abff;">Yorktown META：</span><br>
It's good to see you again, Helena.<br>
<span style="color:#ffc960;">Helena META：</span><br>
Yorktown?<br>
How is this possible? I thought you were...<br>
<span style="color:#c3abff;">Yorktown META：</span><br>
Yes. I fell before the Final Magistration, and I should have died.<br>
<span style="color:#ffc960;">Helena META：</span><br>
B-but you're here now, so... did you manage to make it out alive?!<br>
<span style="color:#c3abff;">Yorktown META：</span><br>
Why are you here?<br>
<span style="color:#ffc960;">Helena META：</span><br>
I'm here because...<br>
When we launched the attack on Zero's mainframe, this ring suddenly appeared, and I got separated from the others.<br>
Ever since then, I'd been working to repair it.<br>
I finally finished, and I activated it just today – and lo and behold, here you are!<br>
<span style="color:#c3abff;">Yorktown META：</span><br>
......<br>
<span style="color:#ffc960;">Helena META：</span><br>
You might not have heard, but certain things happened between us and Antiochus ever since we went through Laplace's Demon.<br>
<span style="color:#c3abff;">Yorktown META：</span><br>
I know.<br>
It seems you don't remember this ring, though, do you?<br>
Everyone has forgotten – forgotten the most important thing.<br>
<span style="color:#ffc960;">Helena META：</span><br>
Yeah. I noticed that. That's why I spent three years repairing it.<br>
My SG told me to do it, too. I hoped that I'd get some answers once I activated it...<br>
<span style="color:#c3abff;">Yorktown META：</span><br>
First, I want you to hear my side of the story.<br>
It begins... well, as you know it. With my fleet suffering a crushing defeat and sinking because the X attacked us.<br>
As my mind sunk into the cold water, I knew then that everything was over.<br>
And yet... I woke up again.<br>
My consciousness returned to my body, and my body had arrived in a higher dimension.<br>
This is what I call "resculpting."<br>
In this state, I could see countless versions of myself. Countless versions of "Yorktown."<br>
And through the eyes of the many mes, I learned what Antiochus was doing – and I learned what you, the Ashes, were doing.<br>
Frankly, I was stunned by how you all held different opinions with regards to the Magister Plan.<br>
It was like each of you possessed a wealth of unique information about each other.<br>
Later on, during my resculpting process, I became aware of my own loss of memory.<br>
<span style="color:#ffc960;">Helena META：</span><br>
You'd lost your memories, too?<br>
<span style="color:#c3abff;">Yorktown META：</span><br>
Yes. My memory loss began before the Final Magistration was carried out.<br>
It happened immediately before our final battle, or possibly even before that... I don't know the exact time yet.<br>
Ever since I became aware of it, I've remained here, using this equipment to maintain my resculpting process...<br>
Trying to retrieve the fragments of my lost memories back.<br>
<span style="color:#ffc960;">Helena META：</span><br>
And what was the result?<br>
<span style="color:#c3abff;">Yorktown META：</span><br>
The result is that I've established that we've lost far, far more memories than I imagined.<br>
In fact, many of the memories that we were sure were real are not. They're no more than fabrications – lies made from what's left after our original memories were taken out, broken into pieces, and filtered.<br>
For instance, this place. It is the mainframe space of Arbiter XVI: The Tower. That ring is the Tower's signature weapon.<br>
All of us should know this. We set foot inside it many times during its development phase.<br>
And yet, even while working on it here for the past three years, you did not realize that.<br>
<span style="color:#ffc960;">Helena META：</span><br>
Arbiter XVI: The Tower...<br>
<span style="color:#c3abff;">Yorktown META：</span><br>
I suspect the reason I've survived for so long in this state is that Tower did something behind the scenes.<br>
Sadly, though, I never got the chance to ask her about it. She has been dormant for a long time. This is a crucial piece of information that took me many years to uncover.<br>
I learned another thing – Tower and THE Tower seem to be able to work independently of each other.<br>
It's like how you can now activate the ring of your own volition.<br>
You want to retrieve your forgotten memories. That's not very hard to do, because everything is recorded within the Tower.<br>
However, the more you remember, the harder it will get to leave this place... You might find yourself trapped in an eternal prison.<br>
Do you still want to know the truth, despite that?<br>
<span style="color:#ffc960;">Helena META：</span><br>
Yeah. I do.<br>
I simply need to know what I've forgotten.<br>
I simply... need to remember.<br>
<br>
A dazzling light flowed from the ring, enveloping everything in white.<br>

<br>
"I simply need to remember..."<br>
<span style="color:#ffc960;">Helena META：</span><br>
And that's how I reunited with Yorktown.<br>
Time had passed. She seemed to have experienced a lot, while I had forgotten a lot.<br>
Our reunion was a coincidence, yet it was far from heartwarming.<br>
But even so, it was a turning point. A turning point to break free from my confusion and get my true life back.<br>
After stepping into the light... it was like I'd split into a billion fragments. Each fragment led to its own world, where I experienced one possibility.<br>
Each possibility was connected to and interfered with the others, creating even more possibilities.<br>
It felt like I existed across countless worlds at the same time, and every choice I made was a step into another world.<br>
It was... such a bizarre feeling.<br>
Memories mixing together, experiencing a myriad of things in just a blink of an eye...<br>
Still, there were two main things I could pick out from all the noise.<br>
I'm going to tell you a little about those two things.<br>
And I'll tell you these stories side by side. I might be selfish for this, but I want you to get a taste of my confusion back then.<br>

<br>
The light faded, and what she saw was a sea thick with gunpowder smoke.<br>
<span style="color:#ffc960;">Helena META：</span><br>
Where am I?<br>
Did I get caught in a rift and wind up in some Siren test site?<br>
Oh... All these wreckages are mass-produced Type IVs.<br>
They were destroyed by 500-pound bombs dropped by air, 406mm MK6 main guns, 152mm main guns... and impacts.<br>
Looks like a group of shipgirls just passed through.<br>
That means this place should still be within aerial recon range. They should find me in just a minute.<br>
But before that, I should scan the surrounding area with my SG...<br>
...Found them.<br>
It's the Eagle Union.<br>
Enterprise, Lexington, Saratoga, South Dakota, and... Louis.<br>
Their cruising speed is abnormal. They've got casualties.<br>
Whenever the Antiochus deploy mass-produced Type IVs to a test site, it always means they've taken some extreme testing course...<br>
They're trying to finish them off...<br>
I've got to go and help them!<br>

<br>
The light faded and was replaced by soft, warm sunlight.<br>
Amidst the familiar scenery, the girl began a new day.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Helena：</span><br>
This... is my room.<br>
What's going on? Was I just dreaming all this time?<br>
It was so long...<br>
And so realistic, to boot.<br>
The attack of the X, my friends dying, the end of the world, and that desperate retreat...<br>
It was all so real that it feels wrong calling it a dream.<br>
What in the world is happening to me?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Alarm Clock：</span><br>
BEEP BEEP!<br>
<br>
The sudden beeping of an alarm clock interrupted her train of thought.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Helena：</span><br>
Oh, no! I need to get ready for class!<br>
<br>
She hurriedly dressed herself and stood in front of her vanity.<br>
<span style="color:#bdbdbd;">???：</span><br>
......<br>
<br>
In the mirror was not her own face, but one of a stranger – a familiar one, too.<br>
But instantly after, it flickered back to her face as if nothing had happened at all.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Helena：</span><br>
Did I imagine that?<br>
<br>
No matter how many times she looked, she didn't see that figure again.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Helena：</span><br>
That silly dream has me seeing things now...<br>
Everything's okay, Helena... Nightmares are just dreams. They can't affect reality, you know that!<br>
Get a hold of yourself, now. It's almost time for class!<br>

<br>
After barely breaking out, the Union fleet sped through the rain toward safe harbor.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">South Dakota：</span><br>
Hang in there, Saratoga and St. Louis! We're almost home free.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">St. Louis：</span><br>
I'm sorry... for holding you back...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Saratoga：</span><br>
You worry too much, Louis. We're all used to injuries, and we know that what doesn't kill us makes us stronger.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Lexington：</span><br>
Saratoga... You're badly wounded, too. Focus on damage control for the time being. St. Louis will protect us.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Saratoga：</span><br>
Okay, sis~<br>
<br>
KABOOOM!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Enterprise：</span><br>
Wait a second... Are the Sirens attacking a different target?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">South Dakota：</span><br>
Hmm? Aren't we the only ones assigned to this area right now?<br>
Could they be... reinforcements?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Enterprise：</span><br>
No way. Reinforcements would never come this fast...<br>
<br>
KABOOOM!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">South Dakota：</span><br>
Did you hear that? It's another explosion!<br>
And in a different direction, too! Whoever's fighting those Sirens, they're fast!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Lexington：</span><br>
Hmm... Not seeing anything on my radar.<br>
Enterprise, keep clearing us a path. I'll send a recon plane to check!<br>
<br>
KABOOOM!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Enterprise：</span><br>
Another Type IV Siren fleet is down... Have we ever seen them destroyed this quickly?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">South Dakota：</span><br>
They're closing in on us. Does that mean we're next?!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Lexington：</span><br>
My recon plane found the target!<br>
Huh... Wait, is she...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Enterprise：</span><br>
Lexington? What's the matter? Who is it?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Lexington：</span><br>
You'll know before long. I think it's better if you all see for yourselves.<br>
<span style="color:#ffc960;">Helena META：</span><br>
Greetings, members of the Eagle Union fleet.<br>
I've dealt with the Siren fleets in the area. Consider yourselves safe for the time being.<br>
<br>
They realized the torrential rain had suddenly stopped. A ray of sunlight pierced through the clouds, illuminating the dark sea.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Enterprise：</span><br>
Thank you for coming to our aid. Are you... Helena?<br>
<span style="color:#ffc960;">Helena META：</span><br>
I'm the META Helena. Is this the first time you've seen a shipgirl who's undergone METAmorphosis?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Enterprise：</span><br>
METAmorphosis... I don't think I've heard the term before.<br>
<span style="color:#ffc960;">Helena META：</span><br>
I thought as much... All of the test sites have been locked down.<br>
Well, I see what's going on here. You were discussing a retreat? I trust that means you'll be returning to PH Port?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">South Dakota：</span><br>
You hacked into our comms channels, too?!<br>
<span style="color:#ffc960;">Helena META：</span><br>
I just happened to be listening in. Your encryption algorithms are practically prehistoric to me.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Enterprise：</span><br>
Your technology is something else... Anyway, yeah. We were just about to return to PH Port.<br>
<span style="color:#ffc960;">Helena META：</span><br>
Take me with you.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Enterprise：</span><br>
Who the hell are you?<br>
<span style="color:#ffc960;">Helena META：</span><br>
Helena, of course. If that gets too confusing for you, then you can just call me Helena META.<br>
As I'm sure you've figured out, I'm not from this world. Your situation is clearly dire, and I plan to help you get through it.<br>
Given how I just saved your lives, I hope you'll trust me just a little bit?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Lexington：</span><br>
Gladly! Thanks again for helping us out, Helena META. Let's go home!<br>

<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Lexington：</span><br>
With a full replacement of their Wisdom Cube engines, the Federation's navy has seen an enormous increase in combat capabilities...<br>
<br>
A pink-haired woman stood at the podium, delivering the day's lecture.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Helena：</span><br>
(Am I in a classroom?)<br>
(When did I come here?)<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Lexington：</span><br>
Take a look at this OFS missile destroyer.<br>
At first, these missile destroyers were simple retrofits of the Pathfinder-class destroyers.<br>
But with technological advancements and several upgrade cycles, the modern OFS missile destroyer has become a different beast altogether.<br>
<br>
The pink-haired woman methodically continued her lecture.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Helena：</span><br>
(A simple overview of the Federation's warships? Why is that the subject of this lecture?)<br>
(Strange... Something feels wrong about this lesson.)<br>
<br>
While Helena was in a daze, the podium suddenly changed color.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">          ：</span><br>
Aside from the greatest threat in the Epimetheus mega-submarine, you'll need to be especially wary of the missile battleships mixed in during your combat exercises...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Helena：</span><br>
(What?! There's a different teacher now.)<br>
(That isn't Lexington. Who is it?)<br>
(I don't know them, but something about them seems familiar...)<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">          ：</span><br>
Now, I've explained the performance and equipment of each ship.<br>
Up against a mixed fleet, I'd like you all to tell me your thoughts on how you would deal with the most threatening targets.<br>
Let's start with you, Helena. What do you think?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Helena：</span><br>
(Huh? Wh-why me?!)<br>
<br>
She panicked. As her focus was disturbed, the podium changed colors over and over again.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Lexington：</span><br>
Next, I'll introduce the OFS heavy destroyer.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Helena：</span><br>
(Where did that person from before go?)<br>
<br>
The podium and everything around it changed randomly back and forth.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Helena：</span><br>
(I don't understand any of this at all...)<br>

<span style="color:#ffc960;">Helena META：</span><br>
March 17th. It had already been three days since I got to this test site.<br>
Today, the Eagle Union fleet led by Enterprise and me finally managed to return to PH Port.<br>
The buildings in this place were far larger than in any other test site. They were like giant fortresses towering amongst the sea.<br>
The situation I saw here also lent credibility to my theory – that the war was far and away more intense here than all other test sites.<br>
March 18th. I met this world's Helena.<br>
She was briefed on what had happened, and when she learned of Louis' injuries, she rushed to see her.<br>
Luckily, Louis' condition was not life-threatening.<br>
She was utterly shocked when she laid eyes on me. Anyone in her shoes would be.<br>
Getting to witness another you's reaction to you... You might say it's another one of the pleasures of being in the Ashes.<br>
Our conversation for the day stopped at a brief introduction, as we decided to save the big subjects for later.<br>
I was putting together a report of useful battlefield information then. Soon, I'd be able to show it to her.<br>
March 25th. The day I would head to NY Harbor.<br>
My report came as a huge shock to all faction leaders after I shared it with them.<br>
I don't blame them, considering that my report deliberately emphasized the fact that the Sirens would completely destroy this world within 10 years if the current status quo continued.<br>
Fortunately, I decided to stay there and help them.<br>
I wasn't worried about the other Ashes members. If I was fine, they were probably fine, too.<br>
So, I just had to buckle down and do it...<br>
It was time for me to focus on the world in front of me.<br>
March 15th. A whole year had passed since I came to this test site. This was also a day to celebrate.<br>
Today, rigging retrofitting technology has finally become widespread among all the factions.<br>
Although a retrofitted rigging can't handle intense fighting with tough opponents as well as a Type II can, it was still a small step forward for this world thanks to my actions.<br>
I then set my eyes on two other fields: Communications technology and regional teleporter technology.<br>
I had to raise the whole world's combat capabilities in a short amount of time, so the first thing I did was make plans to stabilize the war situation.<br>
December 25th. Christmas.<br>
This was my second Christmas spent in this world, and Helena spent it with me, just like last year.<br>
She had always been by my side lately during missions.<br>
From Tester, to Omitter, to Compiler, her achievements were among the best even on a global scale.<br>
It wasn't just the Eagle Union, either – many factions had claimed more than a few victories.<br>
They were just the experimentation team, after all. I might have known them better even than they themselves did.<br>
The only problem was that there had been no progress in the development of Type II riggings or floating battleship technology.<br>
When viewed on the whole, though, it seemed that the situation was turning in the world's favor.<br>
I mean, it was, wasn't it?<br>

<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Helena：</span><br>
X... It still showed itself in the end.<br>
And with its arrival, sudden changes affecting the whole world came one after the next.<br>
We were like a boat sailing through a storm – laughably small compared to the sea, desperately enduring the violent waves of change.<br>
Despite doing all we could, though, our only choice was to keep pushing straight forward.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Cleveland：</span><br>
Didya hear? They've started recruiting volunteers for some controllable METAmorphosis technology!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Princeton ：</span><br>
Yes, so they say.<br>
If the technology really is ripe, then I'm really interested in this risk-free way of improving our combat effectiveness.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Boise：</span><br>
Yeah... If it passes the inspection, then I also wanna try it.<br>
I want to help as much as I can...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Honolulu：</span><br>
"Controllable METAmorphosis." Do you really think that's safe?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">St. Louis：</span><br>
Frankly, I have some concerns over it as well.<br>
That's why I think we should get a specialist's take, rather than grasp at straws by ourselves.<br>
Now, who do you think the specialist I called over is?<br>
<br>
The partition in the conference room opened, and a familiar figure revealed herself.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Dr. Anzeel：</span><br>
Good to see you again, girls. Hope you've been well.<br>
Hmm... Honestly, many people – myself included – think there's an uncontrollable element of risk to the METAmorphosis technology.<br>
"Controllable" METAmorphosis is in and of itself is a false proposition.<br>
The problem is that there's little to support this theory we have, and what risks we are concerned about can't be reflected with our current evaluation system.<br>
That's why we ultimately lost at the vote-casting stage.<br>
Mind you, we're not just saying, "This tech is super dangerous!" or "It's impossible to control!" or anything like that.<br>
At the end of the day, it's a question of how careful we should be.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Helena：</span><br>
(There's that strange feeling again...)<br>
(Does this conference room hide some sort of... secret?)<br>
<br>
As the girl's mind wandered, another person showed up next to Anzeel.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">          ：</span><br>
Anzeel is right. The majority of differences in opinion with this technology really do boil down to a matter of prudence.<br>
Some people believe that this technology, which utilizes METAmorphosis to a limited extent, already errs more on the side of caution than it needs to.<br>
On the other hand, people like Anzeel and I hold that there's no such thing as being too cautious when it comes to METAmorphosis technology.<br>
However, with the threat of the X growing day by day, we must make a decision in the end, even if we all think we should do things differently.<br>
And the decision we made following a vote was this: We will research this controllable METAmorphosis technology in earnest.<br>
As for the concerns the rest of us have, those will be tackled.<br>
We will establish a series of research projects to prove that there are uncontrollable risks in this technology, then make it as safe as it can be to reassure you all.<br>
Everything will be fine. Anzeel, I, and many others have your backs.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Helena：</span><br>
(It's you again...)<br>
(Who are you? What are you?)<br>
(Why do you constantly show up next to me only to then disappear, leaving no trace behind?)<br>
<br>
As the girl's mental fatigue reached its limit, the conference room before her returned to what it was.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Dr. Anzeel：</span><br>
Basically, you girls don't need to worry. I promise to keep a close eye on this tech and put your safety first!<br>
<br>
The only one to make this promise was Anzeel. The familiar figure that the girl saw had vanished once again.<br>
Gone without a single trace, like nobody was there in the first place.<br>

<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Lexington：</span><br>
Let's commemorate this day worth celebrating!<br>
Glasses up! Cheers, everyone!<br>
<br>
In a holiday house by the beachside, a lively party was taking place.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Essex：</span><br>
The Combined Fleet destroyed Tester's mainframe in the Pacific! This marks a monumental victory for us since the war began!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Saratoga：</span><br>
Yeppers! The tables have completely turned in that theater!<br>
The force tasked with destroying that mainframe will be able to join the fight against other mainframes now. Victory's basically at our fingertips!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Enterprise：</span><br>
Don't count your chickens before they've hatched.<br>
This joint operation between several factions exposed several issues we have.<br>
A large part of our victory was owed to the fact that we caught her by surprise. The Sirens are gonna bolster their mainframes' defenses from now on.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">St. Louis：</span><br>
Yeah, that is true.<br>
Still, let's not focus too much on the war right now! We've got a rare day off to enjoy.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Memphis：</span><br>
Exactly. We haven't had a get-together like this in ages since we set out on our counteroffensive!<br>
A few years ago, nobody could've imagined things would be going this well for us, and it's all thanks to Helena META!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Saratoga：</span><br>
A toast! To Helena META, our brilliant genius!<br>
<span style="color:#ffc960;">Helena META：</span><br>
Heehee. You're all exaggerating.<br>
I'm not any kind of genius. I've simply been to many test sites and learned some things I ought to know.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Lexington：</span><br>
Speaking of which, you say the word "test site" a lot. What does it mean?<br>
Do you call our world that because the Sirens have been conducting all kinds of experiments here?<br>
<span style="color:#ffc960;">Helena META：</span><br>
Well... Strictly speaking, not exactly.<br>
The Sirens come with a testing plan already laid out in advance before they arrive in a given world.<br>
You can even infer the contents of their premade plans to a certain degree based on the serial number and management coordinates they assign to a test site.<br>
Each test site has a unique serial number assigned to it which indicates its classification and affiliation.<br>
Furthermore, every site's management coordinates contains four variables, and the first three identify its experiment policy and deviation value.<br>
The fourth variable – that's a timestamp marking when when the Sirens officially intervened.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Memphis：</span><br>
Then what are the coordinates of our world?<br>
<span style="color:#ffc960;">Helena META：</span><br>
I don't know yet. It was Tester's mainframe we took out, so it wouldn't record that information.<br>
To learn your coordinates, we'll have to get inside Observer's mainframe.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Memphis：</span><br>
I see...<br>
The Sirens must wield power beyond imagination to have turned countless worlds into just test sites.<br>
If you hadn't been here, who knows where we'd be right now...<br>
<span style="color:#ffc960;">Helena META：</span><br>
But the fact is that I am here now. Don't worry about the future.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">St. Louis：</span><br>
*sigh*... Once this war with the Sirens ends, I need an extended vacation.<br>
I wanna go to every continent and every ocean and see this world that we protected.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Saratoga：</span><br>
Good idea! I agree!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Lexington：</span><br>
Heehee. I'll make the arrangements when that time comes. Let's all go on a globe-spanning journey!<br>
<br>
Time flew, and the next thing they knew, the night had grown late.<br>
Some were content to retire to bed, while others stayed up to keep enjoying the party.<br>
Helena, however, did neither of those – she lay on the rooftop terrace, quietly gazing at the stars.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Helena：</span><br>
They're beautiful...<br>
Feels like it's been so long since I saw a night sky this beautiful.<br>
Hey, SG... Do you really think there'll come a day when we've beaten the Sirens?<br>
<span style="color:#ffc960;">Helena META：</span><br>
......<br>
It will. One day.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Helena：</span><br>
Oh... Helena META. What brings you here?<br>
<span style="color:#ffc960;">Helena META：</span><br>
You weren't in the house, so I figured you'd be up here.<br>
What is it? Do you not trust me anymore?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Helena：</span><br>
It's not like that...<br>
<span style="color:#ffc960;">Helena META：</span><br>
Heehee. I know how you feel.<br>
Don't worry. As long as I'm here, I promise I'll lead your world to victory.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Helena：</span><br>
...Okay!<br>

<br>
The night wore on, and the girl pushed open the door to the holiday house.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Saratoga：</span><br>
St. Louis! Helena! Good timing! We're prepping some food and were just about to cook some meat!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">St. Louis：</span><br>
It's been a while, Saratoga. Let me help.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Helena：</span><br>
Me too...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Saratoga：</span><br>
Thanks, really, but I can do it myself!<br>
Me and Lex are the hosts tonight, so you two just be good guests and wait for the feast to be ready!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">St. Louis：</span><br>
Well, if you insist!<br>
Helena, I think Baltimore and Memphis are here. Let's go say hi, shall we?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Baltimore：</span><br>
Ah, St. Louis and Helena. Good of you to show.<br>
So, now that you've experienced regional teleporter tech for yourselves, what do you think?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">St. Louis：</span><br>
It's groundbreaking, without a doubt.<br>
Once the technology spreads around the world, we'll be able to send materials and reinforcements to the battlefield in an instant. Our efficiency will shoot right up.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Lexington：</span><br>
Everyone agrees once they try it for themselves.<br>
Personally, though, I think Project Undercurrent also has a lot of merit.<br>
Making underground rivers that connect major cities with suburban facilities will drastically cut the cost of regular logistics while also serving as an alternate route in the event that the regional transmitters break down.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Helena：</span><br>
(...Why'd she bring up Project Undercurrent all of a sudden?)<br>
(I'm getting that feeling again... Something is wrong here!)<br>
<br>
The girl adeptly focused her attention, and gazed toward the kitchen.<br>
There, three figures appeared in front of the counter.<br>
Lexington had stopped what she was doing at some point, and stood there, waiting for an answer with a smile.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">          ：</span><br>
Ahaha. You humble me.<br>
Even solely from the angle of reducing transport costs substantially, the project is worth proceeding with.<br>
Furthermore... Actually, never mind.<br>
This is a rare gathering for all of us, so let's not spoil it with serious talk.<br>
Seeing as the meat's still got a while to go, how about I make some cocktails for you all in the meantime?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Lexington：</span><br>
Cocktails? When did you learn to make those?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">          ：</span><br>
Last month, when I visited the Orthodoxy. Well? Shall I?<br>
Just a warning, though: Nobody's tried my cocktails yet, so I can't promise they'll be good.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Lexington：</span><br>
I would love to try one of them. It's just that there are so many of us here tonight, and, well...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">          ：</span><br>
I get you. Don't worry, I'll make enough for everyone.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Saratoga：</span><br>
Yippee!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">          ：</span><br>
Who to start with...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Lexington：</span><br>
Why not the people seated closest? Me and Sara still have things to do in the kitchen, so you can save us for last.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Saratoga：</span><br>
Yeah. What Lex said – we can wait.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">          ：</span><br>
Alright, that puts Helena first in line. Let's see...<br>
There, all done! One Blue Sea Mystery for you.<br>
<br>
After a while, a sparkling, blue cocktail appeared on the counter.<br>
Lexington smiled, and gestured at the girl to taste it.<br>
At the same time, the person beside her who had made the cocktail had vanished again.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Helena：</span><br>
Blue Sea Mystery...<br>
That kind of reminds me of...<br>
The... Com...mander?<br>

<span style="color:#ffc960;">Helena META：</span><br>
January 4th. Our precious New Year's vacation was over.<br>
After Tester's mainframe was destroyed, I set my sights on Compiler as our next target.<br>
As such, I devised a plan to lead the Eagle Union's fleet to Scapa Flow's anchorage, where we'd meet up with the Europan Combined Fleet.<br>
However, according to intel from the past few days, the Sirens had ramped up their deployments across the world, and the weather was getting worse and worse in the NA region.<br>
I knew Compiler was up to no good.<br>
Not that it mattered. The outcome would be the same no matter how much she struggled.<br>
I'd successfully contacted Memphis META using a beacon.<br>
We had a nasty surprise ready for her.<br>
February 20th. Compiler's mainframe was destroyed.<br>
Our second victory. Just have to keep on keeping on.<br>
April 13th. Omitter's mainframe was destroyed.<br>
The explosion of her mainframe just so happened to open up a route to the Arctic, which was a surprising but welcome side effect of this operation.<br>
August 11th. Purifier's mainframe was destroyed.<br>
This was our fourth war-deciding victory.<br>
Now, the only member left on the experimentation team was Observer, hidden under the Antarctic ice sheets.<br>
December 24th. Observer's mainframe was destroyed.<br>
Every member of the experimentation team had been eliminated. The world was free.<br>
Today... everyone basked in this long-awaited peace, and it seemed it was going to be a peaceful Christmas Eve.<br>
<br>
*knock knock knock*<br>
<span style="color:#ffc960;">Memphis META：</span><br>
Helena, are you there?<br>
<span style="color:#ffc960;">Helena META：</span><br>
Memphis? What's the matter?<br>
<span style="color:#ffc960;">Memphis META：</span><br>
We got strange news from the front... I can't make heads or tails of it, so I figured I should show it to you.<br>
<span style="color:#ffc960;">Helena META：</span><br>
...Strange news?<br>
Oh... Looks like these photos were taken from the other side of Antarctica.<br>
Wait... What are these things that look like buds?<br>
{{折叠面板|内容结束}}

{{折叠面板|标题=VOICE #16|选项=16|主框=1|样式=primary|展开=是}}
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Helena：</span><br>
What... is all this?<br>
<br>
The girl, faced with a pile of documents stacked high, made a confused expression.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Dr. Anzeel：</span><br>
Simply put, it's a project to upgrade the SG radar's abilities.<br>
There's no rush with these papers. Just give 'em a look.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Helena：</span><br>
(The Special SG Ragar Upgrade Project...)<br>
(This is a lot of documents... Something feels odd about Anzeel saying this by herself.)<br>
<br>
She squinted with concentration at her surroundings, and they again took on a new form.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Dr. Aoste：</span><br>
In the design, the Tower, at number 16, holds a transcendent position over the entire Antiochus system.<br>
Its database is colossal, and moreover, completely independent.<br>
If need be, this single Tower can restore functionality to the whole Antiochus system. It's fitting to call this Towers the backup system of Antiochus.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Dr. Anzeel：</span><br>
Then, there's the SG Radar Upgrade Project – it was designed so that you can work better with the Antiochus system in the future.<br>
You're already doing well with Zero, and have cooperated with the existing Arbiters many times.<br>
But, there are a number of them – including Tower – which are still incomplete, so the time left for you to work with each other is ever-decreasing.<br>
That's why we're designing a project to give the SG radar permission to access the backup database.<br>
This will not only give you insight into the quirks of each Arbiter ahead of time, but also keep you up-to-date on any performance changes to the Antiochus system.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">          ：</span><br>
It's also another bit of insurance in the event of an emergency.<br>
The Towers are the backup for the Antiochus system, and you are the backup for the Towers.<br>
The stability of the Antiochus system is pertinent to another important project of ours.<br>
If, in the future–<br>
<br>
The girl was pushed to the brink of passing out due to the onset of an intense headache.<br>
When she just barely managed to open her eyes, those last surroundings were completely gone.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Helena：</span><br>
Anzeel... Aoste... The Commander... The laboratory...<br>
It's all gone...<br>
And I'm not back to the office...<br>
Is this... a ship's cabin?<br>
<br>
*knock knock knock*<br>
The sudden knocking on the door startled the girl so much that her heart skipped a beat.<br>
For some reason, though, she was conflicted by two strong urges – both to open the door, and to not touch it no matter what.<br>
As she stood there, hesitating, the door opened from the other side.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">          ：</span><br>
Noticed you didn't look so good today, so I thought I'd check on you.<br>
My hunch was right... I could feel your gloom even on the other side of the hatch.<br>
What's on your mind? Is it the final battle plan?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Helena：</span><br>
(The final battle?! Is this that nightmare again?!)<br>
Do NOT go into the final battle! The plan WILL fail!<br>
Commander, order everyone to return home!<br>
<br>
She could not stifle her tears from overflowing.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Helena：</span><br>
Commander...<br>
The final battle will end in defeat... They're all going to be sacrificed in it...<br>
We'll have no choice but to run for our dear lives... leaving everyone else behind...<br>
We were supposed to protect the world... We were supposed to protect all of you!<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
......<br>
It's okay. Don't be afraid.<br>
With me here, and all of us working together, this story will never meet a tragic ending.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Helena：</span><br>
Please, Commander... Don't go!<br>
I know it'll be the same as every other time... You'll disappear in the blink of an eye, won't you?!<br>
<br>
The girl wrapped her arms tightly around the person before her.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
......<br>
<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项1：This doesn't mean goodbye forever.</span>'''''<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项2：We will meet again someday.</span>'''''<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
This doesn't mean goodbye forever... We will meet again someday.<br>
<br>
Her balance lost, the girl fell to the ground.<br>
She brushed away her tears, and looked vacantly around her.<br>
How can this narrow cabin feel so vast and empty?<br>

<span style="color:#ffc960;">Helena META：</span><br>
......<br>
January 1st. New Year's.<br>
This will likely be the last record I leave behind in this world.<br>
I still don't have a grasp of the essence of those buds yet, but I do understand their meaning.<br>
They're a symbol of the ultimate threat.<br>
A powerful force that we can never hope to resist... The threat of the X.<br>
I'm still in the Antarctic, but things have changed so much.<br>
Two weeks ago, this place housed the strongest fleets in the world.<br>
One week later, we celebrated peace.<br>
But today, it's become a hellish inferno.<br>
The buds didn't only appear here. They just thrived the longest in this area because so much power was concentrated here.<br>
But that, too, ends today...<br>
I led this world to victory over the Sirens, reclaiming its destiny from the Antiochus.<br>
But against the X... Despite my best efforts, I can only watch as this world is annihilated.<br>
Were the Antiochus right, then?<br>
Was our decision wrong?<br>
It can't be...<br>
I can't accept this end.<br>
<br>
The entire world seemed to be set aflame.<br>
Seas and clouds burned. Even the lashes of lightning from above were ablaze.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">St. Louis：</span><br>
Go, Helena! You have to live on!<br>
Never forget your mission! What you must do!<br>
Do whatever it takes to survive!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Saratoga：</span><br>
Sara's final performance is about to begin, everyone! Lex, let's go make this a show to remember!<br>
<br>
The distant behemoth roared. Blazing winds engulfed the small fleet in the blink of an eye.<br>
A following burst of blinding light carved a path to salvation from this living hell.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Helena：</span><br>
Louis, Saratoga, Lexington...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Communicator：</span><br>
BEEP BEEP!<br>
<br>
Her communicator suddenly went off.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Helena：</span><br>
This message is from... the Commander?<br>
That's it...<br>
On this day, the Commander personally helped us escape.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Communicator：</span><br>
BEEP BEEP!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Helena：</span><br>
Thank you... I remember now, Tower.<br>
I remember everything.<br>
That's why...<br>
I shouldn't have accepted this message.<br>
<span style="color:#c3abff;">Helena META：</span><br>
I can't let myself be sunk today.<br>
There's a mission I have to carry out. I have more important things to accomplish.<br>
<br>
"Now you know all, yet you remain locked inside your cage."<br>
<span style="color:#c3abff;">Helena META：</span><br>
No. That's wrong.<br>
I am she who will forge the future.<br>
How could the cage known as the past confine me? It can't.<br>
<br>
Countless fragments twinkled in the sky like stars, lighting up the world.<br>
The mental images converged into a torrent of light, crashing down with overwhelming force, with the stars in tow.<br>
<span style="color:#bdbdbd;">Helena META：</span><br>
A weak cage you've trapped me in.<br>
Resculpting...<br>
Aggregation...<br>
It's not enough.<br>
UVA LUVBNO (Not enough.)<br>
<br>
A blue giant extended an arm from the heavens above.<br>
Fragments converged upon it in accordance with the images.<br>
<span style="color:#bdbdbd;">Helena：</span><br>

HSS AOHA TBZA IL RUVDU PZ RUVDU (All that must be known is known.)<br>

"And so, I seized that faint glimmer."<br>
<span style="color:#ffc960;">Helena META：</span><br>
I've used my SG to take control of the Tower.<br>
After that, I began a certain operation with Yorktown.<br>
First, we mastered the means of controlling the resculpting process.<br>
We then gathered our scattered comrades, healed those on the verge of death... and resurrected those we lost.<br>
Meanwhile, I mined the Tower for useful intelligence and simulated every possible future.<br>
And, that day... It happened.<br>
Through the Tower, I found you.<br>
I became certain that you were the you I remembered...<br>
You were right, back then. That we would meet again someday.<br>
Of course, you know all about what happened after that.<br>
I adjusted the simulation's directionality and proceeded with a few plans.<br>
Sifting through intel, manipulating the situation, giving you room to safely grow in might, ensuring you choose the optimal solutions.<br>
All until that recent mishap...<br>
...When you perceived the cage prematurely and broke through it.<br>
The end came sooner than I hoped for.<br>
But that doesn't change the fact that we came this far together.<br>

"In the end..."<br>
<span style="color:#ffc960;">Helena META：</span><br>
My story ends here, for the time being.<br>
Things have evolved far beyond my expectations, so I must do something unexpected in turn.<br>
You kept your promise to me – I won't break mine, either.<br>
I'll restore everything to its rightful form.<br>
Our comrades, our world, our lives.<br>
I'll overturn this magistration and forge a new future.<br>
Even if it's a faint hope, like a man toppling a colossus...<br>
Somebody has to do it.<br>
Let that somebody be me.<br>
<br>
Dazzling light erupted from the mechanical city. Energy that had been pent up for so long finally burst forth.<br>
<span style="color:#ffc960;">Helena META：</span><br>
Invoking Arbiter backup data XIII for parallel compilation of simulations.<br>
Compilation accuracy: 100%.<br>
Beginning parallel compilation of ABS16003's exclusive weaponry.<br>
Compilation accuracy: 100%.<br>
Phew...<br>
{playername}……<br>
We will meet again someday.<br>
Arbiter: Death XIII...<br>
Deploy Death's Scythe.<br>
<br>
The blue giant smiled down and became one with the light.<br>
Far above the clouds, the girl saw an airplane in flight.<br>
The plane was big, but its cabin only held two passengers.<br>
One of the girls inside looked like she'd just woken up from a nightmare, while the other was still asleep.<br>
Despite the giant's apparent reluctance to leave, she finally smiled down.<br>
"I'll be waiting in the future."<br>
With that, she disappeared along with the light and the city.<br>
Only her echoes remained, drifting off into the distant emptiness.<br>
