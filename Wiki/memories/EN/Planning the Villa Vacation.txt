1 Strategic Investment Briefing<br>
"The Akashi Island Resort!"<br>
"Summer, sunshine, the beach!"<br>

Port - Office (Formerly)<br>
Port - Executive Strategic Investment Briefing Room (Currently)<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
......<br>
<br>
As soon as I enter my office, I'm greeted by the sight of a sign with some bizarre writing on it. Akashi is there, too.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Akashi：</span><br>
Great, nya! Now everyone is here, nya.<br>
Shiranui, escort our esteemed guests to the VIP seats, nya. The executive strategic investment briefing is starting, nya!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Shiranui：</span><br>
Clap, clap, clap.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
......<br>
<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项1：What's the meaning of this?</span>'''''<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项2：What is it this time?</span>'''''<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Akashi：</span><br>
Now, now, everyone settle down, nya.<br>
<br>
Akashi shoots an ardent gaze at the "VIP seats," which only seat me.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Akashi：</span><br>
First of all, I have a question for our kind and charitable guests, nya.<br>
Would you like to go on a luxury vacation with your beloved, nya?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Shiranui：</span><br>
"Oh yeah, totally. I so wanna go on a vacation. Absolutely."<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Akashi：</span><br>
Nyahaha – I hear you loud and clear, nya!<br>
In that case, please direct your attention to the screen, nya!<br>
Introducing: The Akashi Island Resort, nya!<br>
Summer, sunshine, the beach!<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
......<br>
<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项1：I've had plenty of all that.</span>'''''<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项2：So, got anything for me besides the marketing talk?</span>'''''<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Akashi：</span><br>
Ahem. In summary, this is the top-tier offering we've prepared specifically for big-time elite investors like you, nya!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Shiranui：</span><br>
Clap, clap, clap.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
(They didn't even hire shills to clap along...)<br>
(The direction this is going, though... Surely not...)<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Akashi：</span><br>
Nui, you can't just clap! Say your lines, nya!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Shiranui：</span><br>
Oh. Allow me to tell you about this island.<br>
Its location is within a region specially selected by Akashi for its picturesque scenery.<br>
Here, you'll find a grand villa representing state-of-the-art luxury and style.<br>
It comes with all indoor and outdoor facilities – including space to host a hundred guests for drinks, and areas large enough to accommodate a thousand for activities.<br>
Connections to the port are also excellent. Reachable within a day of travel.<br>
It is truly an ultra-luxurious resort – a slice of paradise, a piece of heaven itself.<br>
Bring your loved ones and treat them to the experience of a lifetime – to an unforgettable, perfect vacation.<br>
"Whoa... That sounds amazing. I'm sold already."<br>
"I wish I could live in such an amazing villa with my sweetheart."<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Akashi：</span><br>
The reservation is limited to just one person – only the finest for our distinguished VIPs, nya! Act now while you have the chance!<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Akashi, are you really trying to sell me on real estate?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Akashi：</span><br>
Heheheh – who do you take me for, nya?<br>
If this was just any regular old plot of land, I wouldn't have prepared such an elaborate show, nya!<br>
This is the cream of the crop – a top-tier property that passed both Shiranui's and my rigorous assessment, nya!<br>
Even the nitpickiest of nitpickers will praise this as the ideal island, nya! And it looks even better in person, nya!<br>
<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项1：Okay, I'm sold!</span>'''''<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项2：Hang on a second...</span>'''''<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项2）</span>'''''What sets this island apart from the port?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Akashi：</span><br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项2）</span>'''''A beautiful beach and ocean view, nya?<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项2）</span>'''''Again, what sets it apart?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Akashi：</span><br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项2）</span>'''''Uhh... It's fully furnished, nya? And it can hold 1,000 people, nya?<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项2）</span>'''''Still not seeing what makes it any special.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Akashi：</span><br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项2）</span>'''''Err, umm... The luxury villa where you can live with your beloved, nya?<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项2）</span>'''''I'll ask one last time – what sets it apart from the port?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Akashi：</span><br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项2）</span>'''''There's also an office on the island so you can work in a completely new environment, nya!<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项2）</span>'''''Okay, I'm sold!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Akashi：</span><br>
I knew you'd be charitable, nya!<br>
Heheh... Command– I mean, esteemed client, you've made an exceptionally wise decision, nya!<br>
Now, please have a look at this exclusive vacation plan we've prepared for you, nya.<br>
Buy it as a package deal to receive a whole 5% off, nya!<br>

<br>
Planning the Villa Vacation<br>
<br>
2 Negotiation Strategy<br>
After a lot of thinking, I came to the conclusion that having our yearly vacation on an island resort wasn't such a bad idea.<br>
This brings us to today, in my office...<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
...And that's the long and short of it. What do you all think?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Mogador：</span><br>
An island resort...? Heehee, that sounds like a pretty solid vacation spot.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Enterprise：</span><br>
Yeah. It's a good pick.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Essex：</span><br>
Um, Enterprise, I get the feeling she's picturing something completely different...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">New Jersey：</span><br>
Honey, as long as you think it's good, I'm totally on board! Plus, we've never been to an island resort before.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Laffey：</span><br>
I'm just as fine with staying at the port and taking it easy... Zzz...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Javelin：</span><br>
Nothing's stopping you from sleeping on the island, too, you know.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Laffey：</span><br>
Then I'm fine with either one... Zzz...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Z23：</span><br>
I think it could be interesting.<br>
It even seems to have separate indoor and outdoor entertainment areas. You can tell they really made it with enjoyment as a top priority.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ayanami：</span><br>
Yes, they've even got all the latest game consoles. They thought of the gamers amongst us, too.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Hwah Jah：</span><br>
But look at the price tag... It does make you think, doesn't it?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ning Hai：</span><br>
That asking price is... quite a number.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ping Hai：</span><br>
Assuming meals are free, you can eat all the baozi you want!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Memphis：</span><br>
That's nice and all, but it doesn't even come close to justifying the cost.<br>
I'll bet Akashi hiked this vacation's price as high as she could!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">San Jacinto：</span><br>
Yeah, I don't think we should let her rip us off like this.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Santa Fe：</span><br>
I have an idea! We should all grill her about it!<br>
Come on, I know how badly you all wanna go, it's written all over your faces!<br>
But, in the eyes of that shrewd business cat, this looks exactly like an open invitation to set any price she pleases!<br>
We're not just gonna sit here and let her scam us, are we?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Fu Shun：</span><br>
Heck no!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Santa Fe：</span><br>
Exactly! So basically, find as many flaws in this plan as you can so we can bring this price down!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Fu Po：</span><br>
Now things are getting interesting...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Alfredo Oriani：</span><br>
Ooh, ooh, lemme help!<br>
Trust me, finding faults is my specialty. If we all work together, making that scam-cat cave in will be easy as pie!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Santa Fe：</span><br>
Heheh! Now go and nitpick this thing to heck! For our wallets!<br>
<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项1：Is all this enthusiasm really warranted?</span>'''''<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项2：We don't really need to haggle...</span>'''''<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Memphis：</span><br>
Commander, sometimes you just have to take the bull by the horns. Or the cat.<br>
Come on, people! Let's give this our all!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Everyone：</span><br>
YEAH!<br>
<br>
Sometime later...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Akashi：</span><br>
Commander, I'm here, nya. Finished your inspection yet, nya?<br>
...Nya? What do you mean you found 2,743 issues, nya?!<br>
I... I have to respond to ALL of them, nya?!<br>
Uhh... C-can we settle this with a 10% discount instead, nya?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Memphis：</span><br>
Commander, I think it's best to go through all the issues in painstaking detail.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Akashi：</span><br>
...How about 15%, nya?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Harbin：</span><br>
Gang, we should just go on a different cruise this year. I'll pay.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Akashi：</span><br>
I'll give you 20%, nya!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Sovetskaya Rossiya：</span><br>
I wonder how the construction of new buildings on Seabreeze Island is progressing.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Akashi：</span><br>
25%, nya!!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Amagi(CV)：</span><br>
Another option we have is to renovate Dream Park instead.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Akashi：</span><br>
Okay, 30%, nya!!!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Akagi：</span><br>
Listen, Akashi. I will admit that I adore your slogan – "Bring your beloved along and have a break in paradise."<br>
I also really want to go on this vacation, so this is your final chance – what's your price?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Akashi：</span><br>
40%! A 40% discount, nya! I can't afford to go any lower, nya!<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
(Maybe just a teensy bit lower...)<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Akashi：</span><br>
*sob*... *sniff*... Nya...<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Alright, alright, that'll do.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Akashi：</span><br>
So we have an agreement now, right, nya?! No backsies, nya!<br>
And no regrets or cancelations, nya! Thank you for your patronyage!<br>
<br>
Then, Akashi bolted out at breakneck speed, and our vacation destination was officially set in stone.<br>

Planning the Villa Vacation<br>
<br>
3 Pre-Vacation Shopping<br>
The next day...<br>
As soon as our vacation plan was confirmed, my desk was flooded with documents related to the preparations.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Well, not just documents – some other stuff snuck in there, too.<br>
Like this. It's... one of Anchorage's drawings?<br>
"Things Anchorage wanna do with the teacher on vacation"...<br>
Looks like even she's excited about this vacation.<br>
I'd better start preparing for this thing in earnest.<br>
Speaking of which, I think Akashi said she'd provide everything from day-to-day items to luxury goods.<br>
What did she call it again? Her "premium lavish vacation package deal," was it?<br>
I wouldn't call it a "deal," but I digress. Let's see what it includes.<br>
<br>
I dig the list out from the pile of papers, and a quick scan tells me this "lavish package" costs a good 30% more than buying all the items separately!<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Man. She could've just ripped me off without saying anything, yet she still ends it with a "thank you."<br>
I'll have Akagi deal with her later.<br>
<br>
KNOCK KNOCK!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Memphis：</span><br>
How's that paperwork going, Commander? Wanna visit the shopping district with us?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Helena：</span><br>
It's quite... bustling today.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Sounds like everyone's fired up. Are you two going shopping as well?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Memphis：</span><br>
Yeah. As a treat. Wanna come with?<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
You know what? Since you asked, sure.<br>
<br>
Even from a distance, it's clear the shopping district is packed today, much more so than usual.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Franklin：</span><br>
Canned food, emergency rations, bandages, a first-aid kit... Alright, that's everything.<br>
I know this is a vacation and all, but it doesn't hurt to be ready for an adventure along the way.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Maggiore Baracca：</span><br>
You're a pro survivalist alright – more concerned with safety than thrills.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Shangri-La：</span><br>
Doing what it takes to survive is arguably much more exciting than run-of-the-mill "thrills."<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Franklin：</span><br>
Yup. I'll do anything to get caterpillar paste off my menu.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Maggiore Baracca：</span><br>
Eugh... That punishment sounds too extreme even for me.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Lung Wu：</span><br>
We're all going there, and you poor things are getting left behind...<br>
......<br>
Alright... I'll bring you along on the vacation!<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
(That's so sweet of her, even if she's talking to a bunch of lobsters in a tank.)<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Hu Pen：</span><br>
Why are they squirming so desperately – for freedom?! Sis, just give up. They obviously aren't interested in going on vacation.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Lung Wu：</span><br>
No, look back there. Don't you see the special price tag hanging by the fish tank?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Hu Pen：</span><br>
Don't say another word. I know what to do now.<br>
Kitty Kabam Punch charged and ready!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Mutsuki：</span><br>
Wow, look! They're giving away samples of that new candy!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Kisaragi：</span><br>
M-Mutsuki, don't run so fast. The candy's not going anywhere.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Nagatsuki：</span><br>
It's always candy with you kiddies. I came to the snacks section to find something more interesting. Like depth charges.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Mutsuki：</span><br>
Ooh, "Manjuu-elly beans in all flavors – a different happy taste in each one"!<br>
That sounds yummy! I want that!<br>
Nom, nom... Wait, I know this flavor!<br>
It tastes like the Comainder!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Nagatsuki：</span><br>
Really? L-let me have a taste of it!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Kisaragi：</span><br>
Umm, I'll try it... Huh? This one just tastes like fruit...<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
There's a real energy here today. Everyone's so enthusiastic.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Helena：</span><br>
Which area should we visit first, Commander?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Memphis：</span><br>
Let me guess – you're going to say the office supplies, right?<br>
I heard there's an office space on the island. You were gonna secretly work during our vacation, weren't you?<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
...I like to think of it as a workcation.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Memphis：</span><br>
Fine, we're going to the snacks area first!<br>
I want this to be a FUN shopping trip!<br>
Come on, Commander and Helena!<br>

<br>
Planning the Villa Vacation<br>
<br>
4 Swimsuits and the Wind<br>
The day of the voyage is approaching.<br>
Thanks to the port's excellent logistics and Akagi's outstanding "negotiation" skills, all the vacation supplies had been neatly stacked by the docks, waiting to be loaded up.<br>
Meanwhile, the passengers are moving on to a more... "private" part of their preparations.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Pamiat' Merkuria：</span><br>
When it comes to island vacations...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Murmansk：</span><br>
The most anticipated thing is going to the beach!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Friedrich Carl：</span><br>
And if you're going to the beach, you need swimsuits and beachwear. Heehee.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Prinz Eugen：</span><br>
Which means what clothes we pick here will be an important surprise.<br>
We did invite you to come along for it, but there will be absolutely no peeking – understood?<br>
<br>
The girls all run off, and I sit alone in the waiting area, starting to think about my plans for the near future.<br>
Just then, though, a hand reaches out from behind the curtain right ahead and gestures for me to come closer.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Pamiat' Merkuria：</span><br>
...Yoohoo! Come here, Commander!<br>
I need you to be my personal fashion advisor. Don't worry, this place is safe!<br>
I go in, and Pamiat' Merkuria, holding a garment in each hand, beams and gives a little twirl.<br>
Which do you think's cutest?<br>
I could put 'em on and show you, maybe♪<br>
Come ooon, I prepared this well in advance!<br>
Don't worry about what the other girls will think. Let them take what time they need.<br>
...It'll ruin the surprise if I do? Heheh, good news for you: I have many more surprises up my sleeve!<br>
For instance...<br>
Which one makes your heart race – the black one, or the white one?<br>
<br>
At the same time, on an island in the port's vicinity...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Le Mars：</span><br>
*pant*... *pant*... There!<br>
Just need to pass this bend and I'll have finished my quota for today!<br>
Gosh, I've worked up such a sweat... I suppose I'll do some stretches while letting the sea breeze cool me off.<br>
...Hm? Is that a sort of reddish-purple I'm seeing in the sunset glow? That's an unusual sight...<br>
Reddish-purple sunset... Purple... I feel like I've read about that somewhere. I think the Commander showed it to me...<br>
Dang it, I can't remember!<br>
Haha, I thought I'd learned something new, but I guess I just imagined it.<br>
...That's odd. Why does the breeze feel stuffy and not cool in the least?<br>
Meh, it's nothing! Time to head back!<br>

Planning the Villa Vacation<br>
<br>
5 Putting the Ow in Meow<br>
Over on the horizon, a surging thunderstorm engulfed the last rays of sunlight.<br>
The clouds massing over the sea were as grey as lead, swirling like immense, boiling waves.<br>
The wind howled ever louder, rain hammering down as nature unleashed its most primitive fury.<br>
Then, a deafening thunderclap ripped the sky in two. That was when the cold reality of the situation chilled their hopeful hearts.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Akashi：</span><br>
G-God, please listen, nya!<br>
If I've done anything wrong, then I'm the only one who should be punished for it, nya!<br>
Please just leave my most precious belongings alone, nya!<br>
My island! My villa!<br>
My money! My geeems!<br>
<br>
All of this began in the early hours of the morning...<br>
Early Morning - Office<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Memphis：</span><br>
There you are, Commander!<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Yeah. I saw Nakhimov open the emergency line. What's the situation?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Admiral Nakhimov：</span><br>
Sorry for bothering you this early.<br>
While Fargo and I were monitoring today's route, we... We discovered something terrible concerning the island resort.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Akashi：</span><br>
Nya?! What has happened to my island resort, nya?!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Admiral Nakhimov：</span><br>
Our instruments are picking up some worrying signs around the island: the water temperature's exceeded 27℃, sea surface salinity has plunged, and vortices are starting to develop at low altitudes.<br>
Also, thunderclouds are gathering in the sky, and the pressure at their center is rapidly decreasing.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Fargo：</span><br>
Commander, we are dealing with a hurricane.<br>
It is on a direct course toward our villa.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Akashi：</span><br>
DIRECT COURSE, NYA?!<br>
No, no, let's stay calm, nya... I took measures against hurricanes while designing the villa, nya!<br>
Hurricanes at this time of year aren't typically too strong, nya. It'll knock over some outdoor tables at worst, nya!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Admiral Nakhimov：</span><br>
The hurricane isn't the only problem. Around the same time it was detected, we also recorded a significant burst of seabed activity.<br>
Fargo and I believe there was an eruption from an underwater volcano in the area around the island.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Akashi：</span><br>
An... An underwater volcanic eruption, nya?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Fargo：</span><br>
Furthermore, the violent seafloor activity caused a series of earthquakes.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Akashi：</span><br>
E-earthquakes, nya?!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Admiral Nakhimov：</span><br>
There was also a tsunami.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Akashi：</span><br>
Tsunami... Tsunami, nya?!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Memphis：</span><br>
A hurricane, an underwater eruption, earthquakes, and even a tsunami...<br>
Is the island going to be okay, Akashi?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Akashi：</span><br>
It's done for... My dream island resort that was gonna make me a fortune is done for, nya...<br>
G-God, please listen, nya!<br>
If I've done anything wrong, then I'm the only one who should be punished for it, nya!<br>
Please just leave my most precious belongings alone, nya!<br>
My island! My villa!<br>
My money! My geeems!<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
How could this all be happening... So this is what they mean by "even the best-laid plans can go awry"?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Memphis：</span><br>
Commander, I think we should reconsider the vacation now.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Akashi：</span><br>
It's over, nya... It's all over, nya...<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Hmm. I suppose we could find a different location?<br>
But then again, the whole port was so excited about this island vacation, and Akashi poured a ton of work into it.<br>
I'd hate to tell them that the island plan is off all of a sudden.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ting An：</span><br>
In that case, I have a proposal. Everyone, may I please have your attention?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Memphis：</span><br>
Please go on.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ting An：</span><br>
Commander, as I recall it, you haven't yet officially signed the sales contract of the island.<br>
In light of what's occurred, I believe the sum that you agreed upon needs to be revised.<br>
Actually, "revise" isn't the right word. I believe it's better to render the contract null and void, given the circumstances.<br>
Wouldn't you agree, Akashi?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Akashi：</span><br>
Nyaaa...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ting An：</span><br>
As it so happens, I've carefully inspected the specifics of that island villa over the past few days.<br>
Honestly, I must say that Akashi has an excellent eye for assets.<br>
If we put aside this exceedingly rare and unfortunate incident, this private resort is indeed of the utmost quality.<br>
Therefore, my suggestion is this: How about proceeding with the purchase at a rock-bottom price?<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
We should still buy the villa? ...And you're saying a rock-bottom price?!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ting An：</span><br>
Yes. Everyone does seem quite enthusiastic about this vacation, after all.<br>
It should be more than possible to repair the villa if we all work together.<br>
I'd say that this is an excellent opportunity to get a top-notch asset at a bargain price – wouldn't you agree?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Akashi：</span><br>
Y-you vulture, nya!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ting An：</span><br>
It's either that or canceling the contract altogether.<br>
You may of course do the repairs yourself, although I suspect that the cost would be astronomical.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Akashi：</span><br>
Hmph... There's no denying that, nya...<br>
Fine, how about a 50% discount, nya?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ting An：</span><br>
Make it 99%.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Akashi：</span><br>
NYINETY-NYINE?!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ting An：</span><br>
If you won't accept that, then the deal is off.<br>
You don't want this to be a complete loss, do you?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Akashi：</span><br>
Fine, nya... We have a deal, nya...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ting An：</span><br>
Great, then we can write the contract right now. A pleasure doing business with you.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Akashi：</span><br>
Nya...<br>
<br>
Akashi and Ting An soon leave the room with haste.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Memphis：</span><br>
I never knew Ting An could be so unrelenting.<br>
I suppose this is quite the plot twist, huh?<br>
Which means...<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Our island resort vacation is still on! We can't let Akashi down!<br>
Although, we'll have to change the plan a little bit.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Memphis：</span><br>
Roger. I'll draft a reconstruction plan and start allocating resources.<br>
Ahh... This one-of-a-kind villa vacation is going to be amazing.<br>
Right, Commander~?<br>
<br>
To Be Continued<br>
