<br>
Chapter 1: Good Morning<br>
Port - Office<br>
......<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Zara：</span><br>
Ah, Commander, you're awake.<br>
How many fingers am I holding up?<br>
<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项1："Two?"</span>'''''<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项2："Three?"</span>'''''<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项3："Four?"</span>'''''<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Zara：</span><br>
Wrong. A thumb isn't a finger. I'm afraid you're not totally awake yet.<br>
I sent you to bed last night and yet I found you passed out on your desk this morning. Were you working all night, Commander?<br>
You can't be pulling all nighters like that.<br>
<br>
I was getting lectured by Zara, my secretary ship.<br>
All because I stayed up to get some work done ahead of schedule. Of course in the end I was so tired I couldn't finish it, and now I'm behind schedule...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Zara：</span><br>
I've told you a hundred times. I'm your secretary ship, you have to let me help you. You can't be working yourself to death like this.<br>
Could it be... Commander, do you not trust me? You'd rather collapse from exhaustion in the dead of night? If that's really how it is...<br>
Then I've been derelict in my duties. And I apologize profusely.<br>
<br>
Zara suddenly flipped around to blaming herself.<br>
But I was never one to let others take responsibility for my failings.<br>
<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项1："It won't happen again."</span>'''''<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Zara：</span><br>
Really? So you'll listen to me from now on?<br>
<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项1："We'll cross that bridge when we come to it..."</span>'''''<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Zara：</span><br>
Hrm... that's too bad.<br>
Then I'm off. I certainly hope to find a strong and healthy Commander when I return.<br>
<br>
It was a close call. If I had just given in to her, who knows what would have happened...<br>
But I couldn't spend the whole day splayed out on my desk. I had to clean myself up.<br>
When I started to move, I felt something had been draped over my back. It was... Zara's cape?<br>
I would have to thank her when she got back.<br>

Chapter 2: A Caring Big Sister?<br>
Port - Office<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Zara：</span><br>
All right, that's about all for today's missions.<br>
<br>
Zara and I have been working together a lot more since the all-nighter incident.<br>
While I was thankful for the support, I couldn't help but think that my job was no longer my own...<br>
*knock* *knock*<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Carabiniere：</span><br>
Carabiniere, coming in!<br>
<br>
Carabiniere knocked, entered, executed a standard 90-degree bow, and looked directly at me.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Carabiniere：</span><br>
Please forgive the interruption, Commander, Chief!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Zara：</span><br>
What's the matter?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Carabiniere：</span><br>
Well... a-actually I came to express my humblest thanks to you, Chief.<br>
Thanks to your wise counsel, I made some new friends and had a wonderful time! Words cannot express my gratitude!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Zara：</span><br>
Is that all? I told you before, it was nothing. You don't need to take everything so seriously. We're friends. And please drop the Chief thing. Zara will do.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Carabiniere：</span><br>
It wasn't nothing! Chief, you took me shopping for clothes, helped me try on outfit after outfit, you–<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Zara：</span><br>
You can't be interrupting the Commander's work over every little thing, now can you? If you're not here on fleet business, it can wait.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Carabiniere：</span><br>
A-absolutely, Chief! Forgive my insubordination!<br>
<br>
Carabiniere backed out of the room, demonstrated another perfectly starched bow, and gently closed the door.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Zara：</span><br>
Who would've thought that she even thanks people for things like that...<br>
Oh? Did that pique your interest? Is prodding into a young girl's private affairs one of your hobbies?<br>
I guess I can tell you. It's no big deal anyway.<br>
Carabiniere isn't so great at expressing herself. But she still managed to make a few non-Sardegnian friends. I guess they made plans to go out together and she was panicking over what to wear.<br>
She came to me for advice. Apparently, Veneto told her to "just try wearing something outside your comfort zone."<br>
My favorite part was when she showed up with a mountain of photographs of different outfits. She really tries too hard in everything. But of course, when it comes to fashion, the only way to be sure is to try things on yourself.<br>
So I took her shopping. You know, Commander, you should have me do your look next time you've got a date.<br>
<br>
That conversation was heading in an unproductive direction, so I steered our attention back towards work.<br>

<br>
Chapter 3: Caring for the Commander<br>
Port - Office<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Zara：</span><br>
Now all that's left is the research and development budget...<br>
<br>
*knock* *knock*<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Trento：</span><br>
Pardon me~<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Zara：</span><br>
Is that Trento?<br>
<br>
Zara looked uncharacteristically rattled.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Trento：</span><br>
Ah, Commander. Just who I was looking for.<br>
I came to thank you for taking me to try that Sakura cuisine.<br>
<br>
Huh? All I recall was showing her to the cafeteria...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Trento：</span><br>
As I said, I wanted to thank you, but by the time I finished eating, you were nowhere to be found.<br>
But then it dawned on me: why, during working hours, the Commander would have to be in the command office!<br>
<br>
That certainly was a logical conclusion.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Trento：</span><br>
In any case... yay~!<br>
<br>
Hmmff?!<br>
Even more startling was when I found my face buried in her voluptuous bosom.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Trento：</span><br>
Good Commander, good Commander, you did great. I'm so proud of you~<br>
<br>
I struggled to breathe, smothered by her pillowy chest.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Zara：</span><br>
Trento, why is it you feel the need to come to the office and– HMMFF?!<br>
<br>
She pulled Zara right in with me.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Trento：</span><br>
And how could I forget my sweet little Zara? You helped Carabiniere make friends. You deserve a reward too! Good girl, good girl~<br>
I should take my leave now. Good luck with work, you two~<br>
<br>
Trento closed the door behind her as she left.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Zara：</span><br>
She just comes and goes like a storm, that girl... I really have a hard time dealing with her.<br>
<br>
If she was able to even shake Zara up like this, perhaps I should be careful around her...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Zara：</span><br>
Commander, you seemed to be pretty happy cozying up to Trento earlier. Maybe you'd like to give mine a try?<br>
<br>
Hmmmm?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Zara：</span><br>
Hehehe...<br>
<br>
Despite being the second time today, I was no less startled to be once again be drowning in softness.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Zara：</span><br>
You're beet red, Commander! Now, mine or Trento's, which did you like better?<br>
<br>
I couldn't be sure if I was in heaven, or in hell.<br>

Zara Character Story - Storia di Rosa<br>
<br>
Chapter 4: Afternoon Chat<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Zara：</span><br>
I brought lunch today. Apparently the Sakura girls call this kind of lunchbox a "bento".<br>
Want to eat together?<br>
<br>
When lunchtime rolled around, Zara and I stayed in the office to share the bento.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Zara：</span><br>
So, I got invited to one of those Royal Navy tea parties once, and had a pretty good time. I wonder if they have to orchestrate something like that...<br>
Eh... they don't? And they throw one of these almost every day...? Those Royal Navy girls really are something.<br>
Oh, you know how Cavour and Cesare are always trying to one-up each other?<br>
They might look that way, but they're closer than anyone else.<br>
<br>
Zara was the talkative sort. There was nothing she couldn't squeeze a conversation out of.<br>
We spent our time discussing the fleet and her homeland, the Sardegna Empire, when suddenly...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Zara：</span><br>
Commander, can I ask you a question?<br>
Gun to your head, would you rather have a hardworking girl like Carabiniere or a warm and gentle lady like Trento?<br>
Come on, spit it out! I promise not to tell anyone. Just between you and me.<br>
<br>
I had been placed in a difficult position.<br>
I had no idea why, but it somehow felt like my life was at a crossroads...<br>
<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项1：Carabiniere</span>'''''<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项2：Trento</span>'''''<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项3：Actually, you're my type, Zara.</span>'''''<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Zara：</span><br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项1）</span>'''''So you like them more honest and hardworking, huh Commander?<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项1）</span>'''''But you know there are some issues with that type. Like, for example, if you're going out on a date, she might end up fretting over her outfit only to show up hours late.<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项1）</span>'''''At the restaurant, she could waste a few hours debating the nutritional value of each menu item. When you want to take a picture, she might end up spending hours getting the background juuuust right.<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项1）</span>'''''And then when it's all said and done, even though the process was kind of a slog, the two of you still had a nice time together. Hooray.<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项1）</span>'''''Enough about that though. Shouldn't you be tasting my steak right about now? Open up~<br>
<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项1）</span>'''''I didn't quite get what she was going for with that hypothetical, but the steak was pretty good...<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项1）</span>'''''I had to be careful not to talk with my mouth full.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Zara：</span><br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项2）</span>'''''So you like the caring type, Commander?<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项2）</span>'''''Naturally, who wouldn't want a sweet-voiced beauty telling you "everything's going to be okay" whenever you're feeling down? Who wouldn't want someone who washes away all your worries?<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项2）</span>'''''The only problem is, giving into that kind of gentle sweetness turns you weak. Before long, you won't even be able to fend for yourself.<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项2）</span>'''''I can hear Trento now. "No need to worry. Just let the Commander turn into a little baby. I can take care of everything."<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项2）</span>'''''Perhaps you like being babied like that? Here comes the choo-choo train, say ahhn~<br>
<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项2）</span>'''''It seemed like my descent into an impotent juveline form was a foregone conclusion, but the steak was really good...<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项2）</span>'''''I had to be careful not to talk with my mouth full.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Zara：</span><br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项3）</span>'''''You're an excellent naval strategist, but...<br>
<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项3）</span>'''''I got commanderzoned.<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项3）</span>'''''Even though she was playing around, I couldn't help but feel a little hurt.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Zara：</span><br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项3）</span>'''''Oh? Commander, if I didn't know better I'd say you were disappointed. Don't tell me... you were serious?<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项3）</span>'''''Don't take it to heart. No matter what happens, I will honor my promise: to bring victory and glory to your fleet. That includes serving you as your secretary ship.<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项3）</span>'''''Now now, I can't have my colleagues seeing you with that dejected face. You know how they talk. Open up and let me feed you some of my juicy steak. Ah~<br>
<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项3）</span>'''''Of course I knew it was just a joke and I shouldn't take it to heart. And the texture of the steak was really delightful...<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项3）</span>'''''I had to be careful not to talk with my mouth full.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Zara：</span><br>
Talking to you is so much fun, Commander, but we do need to be getting back to work. Let's do this again sometime!<br>
<br>
Somehow, I felt like Zara was always two steps ahead of me.<br>
And I can't say I liked that very much.<br>

<br>
Chapter 5: Devil's Whispers<br>
Port - Office<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Zara：</span><br>
Break time, Commander. Put your work down.<br>
Hehe... Is there anything your secretary can do for you? Just say the first thing on your mind.<br>
<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项1：Ask her to clean your ears.</span>'''''<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Zara：</span><br>
Huh? Clean your ears? I guess I can try.<br>
<br>
I figured this was a good way to see another side of Zara.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Zara：</span><br>
Hehehe~<br>
Now then, come rest your head right here on my lap. Don't be nervous, just relax.<br>
Ah, that's it, and put this on for me.<br>
<br>
It was an eye mask. I didn't know what she was up to, but I decided to go along with her anyway.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Zara：</span><br>
Alright, here we go. Don't move, Commander~<br>
<br>
......<br>
I felt something hard and metallic press against my ear.<br>
Zara's earpick made slow gentle circles around the edge of my ear, before gently making its way inside.<br>
The contrast of my ear rejecting a foreign object against the tingly pleasure of the earpick sliding through my narrow ear canal was an indescribable experience.<br>
The earpick rubbed up against the deepest part of my ear, where Zara started to slowly and gently twist it around. The tiny circular motions lightly tickled the sensitive nerves near my eardrum.<br>
Waves of pleasure surged from my ear, washing over my brain and sending tingles out over my entire head. With my vision blocked by the eye mask, the feelings were only that much more intense.<br>
I began to lose consciousness as I drowned in the soothing joy of Zara's ear cleaning...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Zara：</span><br>
Nau~ghty~<br>
<br>
Huh?!<br>
Her breathy whisper flooded my brain with pleasure, making every nerve from my neck up cry out in ecstasy.<br>
I suddenly realized I had once again played right into Zara's hands. She had me trapped, completely at her mercy.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Zara：</span><br>
Commander, you're not allowed to fall asleep until after I'm done. Okay? Hehehe.<br>

<br>
Chapter 6: Commander's Ordeal<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Zara：</span><br>
Commander, since we have the day off tomorrow, how about we go shopping together?<br>
<br>
Was she asking me on a date?<br>
If she was, then...<br>
I really shouldn't have given in so easily.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Zara：</span><br>
We've got everything Carabiniere asked for, plus Littorio's perfume... There's still cosmetics. Commander, over here~<br>
<br>
What I thought was going to be a lovely date had turned into me hauling four huge shopping bags behind Zara.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Zara：</span><br>
And we need dumbbells for Cesare. Exercise equipment is over there.<br>
<br>
Dumbbells were on the list too?!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Zara：</span><br>
That's all we needed to get for everybody. Thanks so much, Commander. There's no way I could've done this in one trip without you.<br>
Oh but there is one last thing. Over here, Commander~<br>
<br>
It was a clothing shop.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Zara：</span><br>
We're going to take this special opportunity to try a new look on you, Commander. Hehehe...<br>
<br>
Zara gazed at me with devious eyes as she approached with a veritable wardrobe in her arms.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Zara：</span><br>
Of course you have to try them on before we know if they're any good on you. Come on, Commander, one by one, you're trying them all on!<br>
What do you mean you're embarrassed? That's right, "tenacemente" – don't you remember my motto, Commander?<br>
<br>
... I realized I wasn't getting out of that shop unless I did as she asked.<br>
It felt like eons...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Zara：</span><br>
And with that, everything got where it needed to be.<br>
I had a lot of fun today. Thanks, Commander.<br>
But really, the night is still young.<br>
How about keeping me company a while longer. You wouldn't say no to me, would you?<br>
<br>
We'd already come this far, I figured I might as well see our date through to the end.<br>

<br>
Chapter 7: Starry Night<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Zara：</span><br>
All right, we're here. This is the perfect spot.<br>
<br>
Zara had pulled me to a bench, where we sat admiring the starry sky.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Zara：</span><br>
Thanks again for today, Commander~ Here, I got you a sports drink.<br>
Not to mention the part where I made you my pack mule for the day. Thanks, and sorry. Hehe, it wasn't so bad, was it?<br>
......<br>
<br>
Zara was staring directly into my eyes.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Zara：</span><br>
Even as dark as it is, I can see it in your eyes, Commander. I can see that dissatisfaction.<br>
"I want to show her my strong and heroic side! I don't want to be prey that she toys with." That's what your eyes are saying. They're full of frustration that you've never succeeded.<br>
But I love toying with you, my prey. I never get tired of it, hehe~<br>
<br>
In the end, Zara was always two steps ahead of me. Any time I tried to resist her, she always brought me to heel.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Zara：</span><br>
... The stars really are beautiful. Heh heh. The night actually brings back some pretty ugly memories. But even so, I can't help but admire the way the stars twinkle.<br>
They carry with them people's hopes and dreams, across tens, hundreds, thousands of light years out to the edge of the universe.<br>
But you're different, Commander. You're right here with me.<br>
The stars are cold and distant, but you're real. I can touch you.<br>
I know I overdo it sometimes, but I really much prefer the prey caught in my traps to some smooth and confident fleet officer.<br>
Hehe, looking into this face of yours just makes me want to tease you more.<br>
Sooner or later, this game of ours is going to end. And we'll be right back where we started.<br>
So...<br>
<br>
Zara clung to my arm.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Zara：</span><br>
I won't be a star far off in the sky either. I'll be here with you.<br>
Commander, I'll always be here with you.<br>
<br>
Maybe she'd gotten too tired. Zara rested her head on my chest.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Zara：</span><br>
Don't you think it'd be scandalous if someone saw us like this?<br>
But... let's keep it up... just a little while longer... okay?<br>
