Faster...<br>
Faster, faster, faster...<br>
...<br>
Why now of all times? <br>
Why did this have to happen?<br>
... ....<br>
Commander...<br>
Please be safe...!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Victorious：</span><br>
Evasive manoeuvres! Those bloody...!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Baltimore：</span><br>
Enemy aircraft approaching from the northeast! Don't stop firing those anti-air guns! Commander's safety is our first priority!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">San Diego：</span><br>
No matter how many they send at us, we won't give an inch!<br>
<br>
Eagle Union - Newport Harbor <br>
A sea of flames...<br>
The dormitory, the docks, the hangars... everything was burning...<br>
Terror. Panic. Anguish. Rage.<br>
In mere minutes, a former paradise was reduced to cinder and ash.<br>
All that remained... was a sea of flames.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Hornet：</span><br>
The Sirens' carriers must be nearby. We can't just sit here waiting to be attacked. Let me take the fight to them!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Baltimore：</span><br>
Don't be rash, Hornet. We haven't finished analyzing the intel report yet...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Hornet：</span><br>
Don't worry about me. Just keep everyone safe. I'll be right back!<br>
<br>
... ...<br>
Not long ago...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Hornet：</span><br>
Look, Commander, Newport City is just ahead of us!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Victorious：</span><br>
Hehe, I didn't expect to find myself back on Eagle Union soil so soon.<br>
<br>
A few days ago, I received a communiqué regarding an important military conference taking place in the Eagle Union.<br>
As a result, the fleet is now making its way there, towards Newport City.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Victorious：</span><br>
I wonder what this meeting is going to be about...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Hornet：</span><br>
Oh, the welcoming committee is already waiting for us!~<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Victorious：</span><br>
Oh! If there are people waiting for us, we must reciprocate with a magnificent welcome of our own!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Hornet：</span><br>
Huh? Haven't you heard the news yet, Victorious?<br>
Apparently, Enterprise will be coming through here today!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Victorious：</span><br>
Really? THE legendary hero of the Eagle Union — Enterprise? In the flesh? I'd love to finally meet her.<br>
<br>
(We haven't told anyone about Enterprise's emergency mission, though...)<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Baltimore：</span><br>
Hah, I was wondering where all this racket was coming from. I see you're as lively as ever, Hornet.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Hornet：</span><br>
Long time no see, Baltimore~!<br>
Commander, this is the renowned lady-killer of the Eagle Union, the gallant Baltimore!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Baltimore：</span><br>
Leave your jokes at the door, Hornet. Well met, Commander. I'm Baltimore.<br>
I'll be in charge of showing you around Newport City.<br>
Newport Harbor may be a naval base, but it's also a famous resort.<br>
If you want to make some unforgettable memories here, I have some tips for you!<br>
<br>
Unforgettable memories, huh...<br>
... .... ...<br>
This was supposed to be an impregnable fortress, so how...<br>
"Get out of here! This place is about to fall!"<br>
No... I refuse...<br>
If I have to sink, I want to be with the others... <br>
"You must live on... Hope must live on..."<br>
"Looks like... I won't be able to keep our Promise..."<br>
Why... must war always be like this...<br>

<br>
What... just happened...? Baltimore? Victorious?<br>
Apparently, Newport City was attacked by Sirens shortly after we arrived. I had lost consciousness during the turmoil...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Baltimore：</span><br>
Commander, we've been caught off guard... They somehow managed to get through without being detected by the radar screen...<br>
The situation is looking very dire now. The entire Newport Harbor has gone up in flames, and we've lost most of our facilities.<br>
We've begun rescue, evacuation, and triage operations, but things are only going to get worse unless we break their siege and stop their airstrikes.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Victorious：</span><br>
They're indiscriminately bombing everything...!<br>
I suppose that's to be expected, though... We let our guard down because Newport was far from the front lines...<br>
What I want to know is, radar aside, how were they able to slip such a large-scale attack force past the patrols? What in the world is going on?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Baltimore：</span><br>
We'll have plenty of time to think about that later.<br>
Right now, Hornet is out there searching for the Sirens' main fleet. With these kinds of numbers, it's going to be too much for her to handle.<br>
Besides, if they're going to attack us on our home soil, then we'll have to give 'em a taste of Eagle Union hospitality!<br>
That's all I have to say. Commander, please issue the orders for our counterattack!<br>

<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Victorious：</span><br>
We've located Hornet and the Siren fleet!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Baltimore：</span><br>
Atta girl! I'd be setting a bad example if I don't bust her out of there!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Victorious：</span><br>
Ah, hold on!<br>
I understand your burning desire to protect your country, but don't go leaving me behind!<br>
Commander, we've got to hurry as well!<br>

<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Hornet：</span><br>
Not on my watch!<br>
Return to the depths you crawled out of—!!!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Baltimore：</span><br>
What good does yelling at a lifeless lump of metal do? Are you trying to blow off steam...?<br>
So, do you even need any help here?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Victorious：</span><br>
Haah... You both... should think... before you charge in!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Baltimore：</span><br>
Haha, sorry 'bout that. I suppose Hornet's enthusiasm is rather contagious.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Hornet：</span><br>
Are Commander and the others safe? How about the harbor?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Victorious：</span><br>
Thanks to your heroism, the evacuation is going smoothly, and the Sirens are being pushed back.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Hornet：</span><br>
Thank goodness... I was able to fight without fear because I knew you'd come after all!<br>
The only thing left now is the Siren flagship. If we wipe it out, the rest of the production-type fleet should fall apart.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Baltimore：</span><br>
Hornet, you've been hurt pretty badly, are you still able to fight?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Hornet：</span><br>
The fiercer the battle up here, the safer things are in the back. How could I retreat at a time like this?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Baltimore：</span><br>
That decides it then. We'll make the Sirens atone for their sins in blood!<br>

<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Baltimore：</span><br>
You're finished...!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Hornet：</span><br>
Ugh... (collapses)<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Victorious：</span><br>
Hang in there, Hornet! I knew it was a bad idea to keep fighting with all those injuries...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Hornet：</span><br>
Sorry, I'm just a little tired, that's all...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Baltimore：</span><br>
We'll handle things from here. Commander, you should stay with Hornet.<br>
<br>
We instructed the accompanying destroyers to escort Hornet back to Newport Harbor.<br>
The Siren fleet, cut off from its leadership, quickly fell into disarray. Though the battle continued, it was only a matter of time until they were completely routed.<br>
However, this would still be the largest attack ever conducted on the Eagle Union's soil...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Baltimore：</span><br>
In accordance with Commander's orders, the rest of the fleet is to move to NY Harbor while we continue to carry out the evacuation.<br>
Once we rendezvous with the ships already stationed there, we will—<br>
<br>
<br>
Attention, all fleets nearby NY Harbor. This is an emergency.<br>
<br>
NY Harbor is currently under siege by the Sirens' main force. The situation is extremely dire.<br>
<br>
The defensive fleet is currently engaging the enemy, but cannot hold out for long.<br>
<br>
Destruction of the attacking Siren fleet and protecting NY Harbor are our top priorities. <br>
<br>
Requesting immediate aid from any nearby fleets.<br>
<br>
Repeat: requesting immediate——<br>

<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Juneau：</span><br>
H-how is this happening... on our own soil...?<br>
Atlanta... I'm scared...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">？？？：</span><br>
So this is where you were.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Juneau：</span><br>
Uwooah?!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Birmingham：</span><br>
Easy there, Juneau! It's just me, Birmingham.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Juneau：</span><br>
Oh... B-Birmingham, huh? I was worried the Sirens had killed everyone and made their way here...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Birmingham：</span><br>
Don't fret. Our defenses are still holding strong. The Sirens won't be able to break through so easily.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Juneau：</span><br>
R-right... I'm worrying too much...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Birmingham：</span><br>
It happens to all of us. Nobody expected the Sirens to launch a full-scale assault here.<br>
How's the evacuation going?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Juneau：</span><br>
Ah, um, it's basically done! Dewey and Aylwin are transporting everyone to the evacuation point...<br>
I just wish Atlanta was here... things would be so much better...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Birmingham：</span><br>
I also wish Cleveland was... No, I can't always stay in her shadows.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Juneau：</span><br>
Birmingham...?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Birmingham：</span><br>
We have an important role to play in times like this... Juneau, try taking a deep breath.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Juneau：</span><br>
Hnnnh... phewww...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Birmingham：</span><br>
How's that? Calmed down yet?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Juneau：</span><br>
I-I think I'll be okay... Thanks, Birmingham...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Birmingham：</span><br>
C'mon, then. Since evacuations are already done, let's get to the front lines and drive those Sirens back.<br>

<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Birmingham：</span><br>
Something isn't right... That was too easy.<br>
What were they thinking, sending such small numbers? This is still the headquarters' defensive line...<br>
Did the Sirens really think they could breach our defenses with such a ragtag fleet?<br>
Unless...<br>
<br>
BOOOOOOM--------!!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Birmingham：</span><br>
We've been breached?!<br>

Eagle Union - NY Harbor Combat Zone<br>
NY Harbor is the largest naval base in the Eagle Union, complete with cutting-edge equipment and auxiliary facilities.<br>
In addition to its strategic location, it has served as the command center for all Atlantic operations since Azur Lane's inception.<br>
The Long Island Defense Line is responsible for protecting NY Harbor as well as its neighboring auxiliary facilities.<br>
With its superb fortifications, large-caliber coastal artillery, plentiful supply routes, multiple military bases, as well as several operational fleets along the coast...<br>
It is practically impenetrable, a fortress that safeguards the heart of the Azur Lane.<br>
When humanity was driven to the brink by the appearance of the Sirens, this was the only place that managed to withstand the Sirens' onslaught.<br>
In a sense, this is humanity's last bastion. As long as it stands, there is still hope.<br>
After the Crimson Axis broke off, there was no choice but to send many forces to various different countries in order to try to preserve the precarious peace around the world.<br>
It was as if everything had been dancing within the Sirens' palms...<br>
But now there is no time to speculate about that...<br>
If the Eagle Union were to fall, the entirety of Azur Lane would soon follow, and the delicate balance of power around the globe would be cast into chaos. The stalemate with the Sirens would be broken, potentially ushering in another massive offensive...<br>
Time is running out...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Victorious：</span><br>
How can this be... Commander, what should we do?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Baltimore：</span><br>

I'm another Farragut-class destroyer, Aylwin. Reporting for duty.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Victorious：</span><br>
Are you two from the defense line?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Dewey：</span><br>
Yes we are, Miss Victorious.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Baltimore：</span><br>
What about the others?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Dewey：</span><br>
The diversion force managed to draw the Sirens' attention away, giving us the opportunity to retreat with the wounded. But after that...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Aylwin：</span><br>
We'd like to check back with the others, but the Siren fleet is blocking the way back.<br>
It's too much for just us to handle...<br>
<br>
……<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Dewey：</span><br>
B-but... as long as you're here, Commander, you'll think of something, right?<br>

<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Baltimore：</span><br>
Don't worry. You've done well. With Commander's help, we'll get through this<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Victorious：</span><br>
The goddess of victory is with you! We'll keep you two safe - just stay behind us!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Dewey：</span><br>
V-Victorious! We received a transmission from Juneau and Birmingham, informing us that they made contact with an elite Siren!<br>
Commander, we should go save them!<br>

<span style="color:#ec5d53;">Purifier：</span><br>
Man, they sure dumped a ton of dirty work in my lap this time. Hey, what's-your-name, Burnie-sham? You still with me? Heellloooo? Come on, get up!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Juneau：</span><br>
P-please stay away from us!<br>
<span style="color:#ec5d53;">Purifier：</span><br>
Whoa, there! Didn't your mom teach you not to point guns at people, little girl? Especially in your state! Look at you, you're barely able to see me through those tears!<br>
Tell you what: plead for your lives like you mean it and I might just spare you~<br>
After all, you're so insignificant that your fates aren't worth the brain cells it takes to remember!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Birmingham：</span><br>
Juneau... Don't worry about me, just get out of here...!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Juneau：</span><br>
No way! I won't abandon my friends... or surrender to the enemy!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Baltimore：</span><br>

Juneau! Baltimore! Thank goodness, you're still okay!<br>

Dewey... Aylwin...! Why did you come back? Ohh! Commander!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Birmingham：</span><br>
We're saved...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Baltimore：</span><br>
You've managed to hold back a mighty enemy for such a long time. You should be proud of yourselves.<br>
You there! "Purifier," was it? Pick on someone your own size instead!<br>
<span style="color:#ec5d53;">Purifier：</span><br>

Oh no, I'm so scared~ By the by, while you've been messing around here, NY back there's been having a city-wide barbecue party! You should go check it out!<br>

We... we got her!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Birmingham：</span><br>
Nice shot, Juneau!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Juneau：</span><br>
P-please... It's embarrassing...<br>

I felt confident leaving the cleanup work in the hands of Juneau and the others. We had to press forward to the next destination... NY Harbor.<br>
However, Purifier's words weighed heavily upon my mind. What did she mean by "lead actors?"<br>

Eagle Union - NY Harbor, at about the same time<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Long Island：</span><br>
W-what do we do?! The Sirens have totally broken through the defensive line!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Langley：</span><br>
We've detected the Sirens' main fleet! In addition to the massive numbers of production-type ships, there are also many humanoid-type Sirens!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Bogue：</span><br>
We're getting distress calls from Newport Harbor as well!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">San Juan：</span><br>

Ugh... I still can't get in touch with Enterprise or Commander!<br>

Argh... we're going to be in serious trouble if their communications are being jammed...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Vestal：</span><br>
Headquarters is going to be in danger at this rate!<br>

Okay everyone, let's calm down first. Ausburne, can your Little Beaver Squadron handle the surrounding light fleets?<br>

<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Saratoga：</span><br>
Bataan, can I count on you to check on the status of the defense line?<br>
Langley, Bogue, follow me. We'll wrest air superiority from those Sirens!<br>
We won't have as many escorts as we'd normally like, but where there's a will, there's a way!<br>
(Everyone, please be safe...)<br>
Let's get going! We'll show those Sirens what happens when you mess with the Eagle Union!<br>

Looks like you've done your homework already. But you'd better add "the one who's going to smash your face in" to that list.<br>
You're the one who's commanding the Siren forces here, aren't you?<br>

You are nothing but weapons, instruments of death and destruction.<br>
You would even strike down your allies without hesitation if you were ordered to.<br>
How ironic it is that tools of death would speak of justice. Do you even know what justice is?<br>

Justice is simple enough ⁠— it's about using your power to protect your loved ones!<br>

KABOOM!!<br>
KABOOM!!<br>

Long-distance barrages from a 16-inch battery...?!<br>
<br>
KABOOOM!!<br>

Hehe~! Tester, while you were rambling on, those joke fleets you brought along with you have been reduced to rubble!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Alabama：</span><br>
Did I miss 'er? Can't tell from this distance...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Baltimore：</span><br>
No, it was a direct hit. Well done.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Alabama：</span><br>
Mm... it was only possible 'cause you provoked her.<br>

Evolution and progress necessarily bring about suffering and sacrifice. The salvation granted in the end pales before the desolation wrought through the means.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Baltimore：</span><br>
Evolution and progress? You may talk like you're a savior, but your actions are utterly despicable.<br>
You are nothing more than a crazed butcher, an enemy to all of humanity.<br>
<span style="color:#ec5d53;">Tester：</span><br>
So much ignorance, but so much hatred. This falls within the expected behavior of this test subject.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Victorious：</span><br>
I've had enough of all of you! What do you mean, ignorance? You keep prattling on about evolution and all these experiments without telling us anything!<br>
I hate the way you bunch always show up smugly, start attacking us smugly, start rambling on smugly, and then disappear smugly!<br>
Why can't you tell us what you want, like normal people?!<br>

Hehe~! Tester, while you were rambling on, I've reduced all your little underlings to scrap metal!<br>
If you know what's good for you, you should just surrender!<br>
<span style="color:#ec5d53;">Tester：</span><br>
That's true... I suppose I've said too much.<br>
But too bad for you. Time's already up.<br>

Another enemy airstrike?! Wait, this is a Corsair! Saratoga, what are you doing?!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Saratoga：</span><br>
Eek! These aren't my planes, though!!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Baltimore：</span><br>
What's going on? Commander, quickly contact the other ships...!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Transmitter：</span><br>
BZZZZZT...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Victorious：</span><br>
Our radio communications are down! We're going to be surrounded at this rate...<br>
Wait, are you trying to run away?!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Baltimore：</span><br>
What are you doing? Answer me, Tester!<br>
<span style="color:#ec5d53;">Tester：</span><br>
Running away? No, the experiment has only just begun.<br>
This is not a "reproduction" of your "history," but it is your reality. Do show me how you all dance, my little "Actors."<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Baltimore：</span><br>
Argh...! She disappeared in a flash of light...!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Saratoga：</span><br>
The Siren fleets are withdrawing en masse. We should stop trying to chase them and prioritize defending the harbor!<br>
The corsair came from that way... Maybe it's some kind of secret message from an ally!<br>
Hey! Whoever you are, Saratoga's coming to help!<br>
All that remained... was a sea of flames.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Baltimore：</span><br>
No... impossible...<br>
<br>
... ...<br>
An unbelievable sight unfolded before us.<br>
There "she" was, standing quietly in the midst of the Siren fleet.<br>
It was almost as if...<br>
<span style="color:#ff6100;">？？：</span><br>
The next singularity is nearing completion.<br>
<span style="color:#ff6100;">？？？？：</span><br>
I see...<br>
<span style="color:#ff6100;">？？：</span><br>
And you're sure that the Master's target is... that person?<br>
<span style="color:#ff6100;">？？？？：</span><br>
Yes... I can feel their presence.<br>
<span style="color:#ff6100;">？？：</span><br>
Surely "she" will also be there. Are you ready to face her again?<br>
<span style="color:#ff6100;">？？？？：</span><br>
I threw away my regrets long ago...<br>
Very well. In that case, I shall lend you aid when the time comes.<br>
<span style="color:#ff6100;">？？：</span><br>
But let me warn you, you must keep moving forward...<br>

Combat Zone - Bermuda Triangle<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Essex：</span><br>
Ugh... We've been had...! This was the Sirens' trap after all!<br>
Victorious! Shangri-La!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Victorious：</span><br>
We've lost communication with Task Force 11 and Task Force 17!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Shangri-La：</span><br>
The enemies are several times more numerous than the intelligence report claimed.<br>
We've been completely surrounded...<br>
<br>
KABOOM---!!<br>
NY City - Wharf<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Enterprise：</span><br>
I must first extend my gratitude to each and every one of you for arriving in such a timely manner. I'll now explain the next phase of the operation.<br>
As we all know, the Sirens laid siege to NY City just a week ago. Currently, many of our port facilities are still disabled from the attack.<br>
However, due to the tenacity of our brave defenders and Commander's effective leadership, the damages ended up being a lot lighter than they could have been.<br>
During the time of the attack, many of us, including Cleveland and myself, were unable to come to the defense of the harbor due to jamming of our communication networks.<br>
In addition, we cannot ignore the reality that the Sirens managed to disable and bypass our radar system.<br>
Given the status quo, the harsh reality is that we cannot deal with another potential large-scale attack from the Sirens.<br>
As such, Headquarters has submitted a proposal - that we take the fight to the Sirens' forward base instead of waiting for our destruction. Commander has accepted this as our best plan of action.<br>
We've determined that the most likely location for the Sirens' forward base is in the Bermuda Triangle.<br>
There is ample evidence to support this conclusion. When the Sirens' attack began, a dark cloud was spotted forming over that area, covering the surface of the ocean.<br>
Additionally, strong electromagnetic readings have been detected from that area, similar to when the "Winter's Crown" formed near the Northern Parliament.<br>
Given what we know about the Winter's Crown, and the enormous manpower it took to suppress that situation, we can conclude that if a similar situation were to occur here, NY City would be in grave peril.<br>
The primary goals of our operation are to find and destroy the Sirens' main base, secure the maritime routes around NY City, and finally...<br>
Victorious, please explain what a "singularity" is.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Victorious：</span><br>
I am Victorious, a carrier from the Royal Navy. I accompanied Commander to NY City in order to participate in a strategic meeting. Some of you might know me as "Robin."<br>
Anyways...! I'm a representative of the Royal Navy. During this operation, I will be joining as an advisor.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Enterprise：</span><br>
Ahem... Victorious...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Victorious：</span><br>
Ack! My apologies!<br>
Um, the Winter's Crown... The best way to describe it is as an area of anomalous weather, similar to the Mirror Seas. I first encountered one during an operation in the north.<br>
Even from a distance, we experienced significant electromagnetic disruption to our communications equipment. About half our fleet lost radio contact temporarily, and a variety of other electronic equipment was also affected.<br>
Without being able to utilise radar, it became very difficult for us to control our aircraft. We had to rely on experience - and at times, sheer luck.<br>
We attempted to conduct reconnaissance operations inside the Crown, but we would lose our seaplanes as soon as they entered, as if they were getting absorbed the expanding cloud.<br>
However, what we see here in the Bermuda Triangle is slightly different.<br>
We are still able to see into the area, meaning that we will be able to visually confirm any combat that happens inside.<br>
In other words, we will approach from here⁠—<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Enterprise：</span><br>
If we destroy the core, we will be able to stop a full-fledged singularity from forming.<br>
In this mission, Essex, Baltimore, and I will each lead a fleet into the Bermuda Triangle.<br>
Our final objective is to stop this singularity from forming!<br>
In addition, Commander will directly be leading us from one of the ships, actively supporting our efforts on the front line.<br>
Everyone, I wish you the best of luck.<br>

There's a lot of them, but they're merely production-type models.<br>
We haven't even seen a single humanoid-type Siren, let alone an elite...<br>
Instead, it's just been crude copies of us...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Victorious：</span><br>
Even if they look like us, they are just lifeless husks in comparison...<br>
It's sickening to see so many of them...<br>
If you're going to clone, at least give them some cute clothes and makeup!<br>
I bet it's much easier to get those Sirens to surrender than it is to teach them to develop some taste!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Enterprise：</span><br>
That's just the way things are. When Commander gives the order, I'll need you to follow me.<br>
<br>
Victorious's strange obsession aside, it's always disconcerting to have to aim your weapons at your image repeatedly.<br>

Bermuda Triangle - Essex Fleet Combat Zone<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Shangri-La：</span><br>
According to the photos taken from the air, there are two Siren fleets patrolling this area.<br>
In terms of numbers, we're at an overwhelming disadvantage.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Essex：</span><br>
We're clearly just a decoy, but to think that the Sirens are still willing to face us with such numbers...<br>
I wonder what kind of enemies Enterprise is fighting right now...<br>
But, on the other hand... the more enemies we can draw to us, the more pressure we can take off of everyone else...!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Shangri-La：</span><br>
(scribbles frantically)<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Essex：</span><br>
H-huh? What are you doing, Shangri-La?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Shangri-La：</span><br>
Don't worry about it, just keeping some regular old naval records.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Essex：</span><br>
"Essex is getting all dreamy thinking about Enterprise even when completely surrounded by the enemy" ...Whaaat?!?!<br>
H-hold on! I was merely considering the best way to minimize our losses!<br>
What kind of naval records are these anyway? Jeez, don't get distracted with this kind of stuff!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Shangri-La：</span><br>
Of course I won't. After all, it falls upon me to record Essex's flustered expression for posterity.<br>
Jokes aside, I personally could use a bit more time to prepare, but you know how the saying goes... A soldier can't choose her battlefield...<br>
All ships, forward! Let's drop some freedom on those Sirens!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Essex：</span><br>
As an Essex-class, I can't afford to lose...<br>
Especially not to you Sirens!<br>
{{折叠面板|内容结束}}

{{折叠面板|标题=The Third Fleet - Part 2|选项=21|主框=1|样式=primary|展开=否}}
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Essex：</span><br>
All right, we're finally done here.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Shangri-La：</span><br>
I managed to collect a lot of combat data in this adverse weather. Once we get back, I'm going to have to analyze it...<br>
Right, come to think of it, Essex, you know how the Bermuda Triangle has always been notorious for its extreme and sometimes unexplainable weather?<br>
Some of humankind's earliest encounters with this area are filled with reports of a sudden storm that filled the entire sky.<br>
Furthermore, these storms would persist for several days at a time. Only the most skilled navigators could hope to weather these terrible storms.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Essex：</span><br>
Do you think that the Sirens have been lurking here for hundreds of years?!<br>
No, no, that's way too far-fetched!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Shangri-La：</span><br>
Perhaps. But maybe we're looking at it from the wrong angle.<br>
It's hard to deny the relationship between the Sirens and the strange phenomena we've been observing around the oceans.<br>
We know that the "singularity" is capable of causing widespread anomalies. The Mirror Seas can manifest illusionary landscapes into reality, and the Sirens are known to possess rigging in the image of mythical sea creatures.<br>
Rather than being foreign, alien entities, perhaps the Sirens have always been there, shaping humanity's perceptions and understanding of what the very seas are.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Essex：</span><br>
Sirens... what in the world are they...?<br>
... Afterward, I'll have to ask Commander to investigate some of these unexpected phenomena that we assumed to be unrelated.<br>
But right now, we'll stick to the original plan and make our way towards the middle!<br>

Bermuda Triangle - Combat Zone<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Enterprise：</span><br>
Commander, all fleets are progressing smoothly, and are now advancing as planned to the central area.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">North Carolina：</span><br>
We're encountering fewer and fewer Siren forces as we push towards the center.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Victorious：</span><br>
Perhaps they destroyed all of their forces in the sneak attack...<br>
Whatever the reason might be, though, I'll gladly take it.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Enterprise：</span><br>
Commander, I'm a bit interested in that additional objective. That is, to investigate the identity of the "mysterious individual."<br>
<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项1："I agree."</span>'''''<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Enterprise：</span><br>
That's also why North Carolina and Washington are with us. They appear to have seen this mysterious ship during their last excursion into the Mirror Seas.<br>
When that ship attacked NY City, it was said that the silhouette of her riggings resembled my own...<br>
Commander has also seen that ship. For all three of us to be assembled in this fleet, it can be said that our true purpose is to meet her face-to-face.<br>
Sorry that I didn't tell you earlier, Washington.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Washington：</span><br>
It's cool. Doesn't really bother me.<br>
Whoever the hell they are, they've fought back some of the elite Sirens. However, they clearly aren't on our side either.<br>
If what Saratoga and Commander said about her being allied with the Sirens during their attack on NY City is true, then we'll have to steel ourselves for a confrontation.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Enterprise：</span><br>
That's right... We should be approaching our target very soon.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Victorious：</span><br>
I don't like the feeling of this... My skin's beginning to crawl...<br>

Don't worry, Commander, I'm fine.<br>

We'll have our answers soon enough.<br>

Bermuda Triangle - Baltimore Fleet Combat Zone<br>

No evil can withstand the gunfire of justice!<br>
Isn't that right, my partner in justice?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Baltimore：</span><br>
Ah... right, justice always prevails!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Cleveland：</span><br>
Heard you're the one who saved Birmingham in that battle earlier! You're a real champ, Baltimore!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Baltimore：</span><br>
She was the one who stood against Purifier without hesitation. If anything, she is the one who saved all of us.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Montpelier：</span><br>
You have my thanks as well.<br>
... The Sirens aren't getting away with what they've done.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Cleveland：</span><br>
Ausburne, Little Beavers, how are you all holding out?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Charles Ausburne：</span><br>
Back in NY City, we made use of our speed to support from the rear and disrupt the Sirens, so we haven't been in a real fight yet!<br>
We took some light scratches, but nothing that'll slow us down! We'll fight tooth and nail in the name of justice!<br>
... But I'm wondering, why did headquarters split us up into several fleets?<br>
Wouldn't it better to get everyone together and smash the enemy in one go?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Baltimore：</span><br>
Our rescue effort response in NY City delayed our regrouping plan, and it took a lot of time to properly analyze the abnormal weather patterns in the Bermuda Triangle.<br>
Furthermore, we don't know exactly where the singularity is. In order to locate it given our limited intel and personnel, the only viable approach is to divide and conquer.<br>
Remember, the main goal of this operation is to prevent the singularity's formation, rather than to eliminate the Sirens. Then we can figure out which fleet should make the final move.<br>
Have to say, headquarters really thought this through...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Charles Ausburne：</span><br>
So that's how it is... Like a true hero of justice, you're so knowledgeable about everything~!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Montpelier：</span><br>
Come to think of it, Baltimore, for a hero of justice, you don't seem to talk about it a whole lot.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Baltimore：</span><br>
Ah, that's because for me, justice isn't something you preach. Justice is simply the pursuit of doing what is right.<br>
In that regard, you, Cleveland, and I all believe in the same kind of justice.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Montpelier：</span><br>
... I do?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Charles Ausburne：</span><br>
That's the spirit! Come, my partners of justice, and we'll take down the evil Sirens!<br>
Justice always prevails!<br>

<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Cleveland：</span><br>
Well said, Ausburne! What matters most is that everyone gets along!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Baltimore：</span><br>
Indeed. We're about to break through into the objective area, so let's take a moment to rest and resupply first.<br>
Destroyers, stay behind and be on alert. Everyone else will keep advancing!<br>

This is not what was meant to happen! They are people with souls, just like us!<br>
You see these monsters, one of which could singlehandedly annihilate the entire 2nd Fleet, as "people"?!<br>
There has to be an explanation! If we can just talk to them, ask them about it...<br>
Your time here as a researcher is over. We will confiscate all of your data as evidence and use it for the betterment of humanity.<br>
As for you, you should worry more about your pending imprisonment than the wellbeing of these godforsaken monsters.<br>
Guards, take her away...<br>

The wind is too strong...! I can't launch my scout planes anymore!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Saratoga：</span><br>
Sara can't either! Our flight decks weren't built for this kind of weather!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Enterprise：</span><br>
We're almost there! Call your seaplanes back and keep pushing forward! We'll soon be in the eye of the storm!<br>
From there, we can launch our planes again!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Victorious：</span><br>
Trying to control our aircraft in this storm is... almost impossible!<br>
Wait... I think I can see Sirens coming towards us!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Saratoga：</span><br>
They must be our unwelcome welcoming party...!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Enterprise：</span><br>
Everyone, prepare for combat! We're about to break through!<br>

... ... ...<br>
Why did you come here?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Enterprise：</span><br>
Are you the "mysterious ship" the report mentioned?<br>
In the Mirror Seas, you broke through the Sirens' forces in order to save one of our fleets.<br>
However, to our surprise, we also saw you leading the Sirens during the attack on NY City.<br>
And now, following the Winter's Crown incident, you once again seem to be involved with this singularity.<br>
... Just who are you, exactly?<br>

<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Washington：</span><br>
There you are! You beat my ass hard last time, but that ain't gonna happen again!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Saratoga：</span><br>
You got away earlier because we had to prioritize defending the harbor, but now we have you just where we want you!<br>
I thought we could maybe become allies after you rescued North Carolina and company, but in light of what you did...<br>
What you did - attack NY City - is unforgivable! We should've known better; you're no different from the Sirens!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Victorious：</span><br>
Though at first glance they seem different, the electromagnetic readings emitted by the storm in the Bermuda Triangle are identical to those of the Winter's Crown!<br>
That incident was your doing as well, wasn't it?!<br>
<span style="color:#ec5d53;">？？？：</span><br>
……<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Enterprise：</span><br>
……<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Victorious：</span><br>

<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Enterprise：</span><br>
Stay out of this!!<br>
<span style="color:#ec5d53;">？？？：</span><br>
What are you thinking, Enterprise?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Enterprise：</span><br>
... Why won't you answer?<br>
<span style="color:#ec5d53;">？？？：</span><br>
You were the one person I hoped never to encounter. But, in the end, you're just a lifeless puppet being controlled by Antiochus.<br>
You've even brought "the Key" right into my hands...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Enterprise：</span><br>
Anti...ochus? Key...?<br>
... Everyone, protect Commander! It's not us she's after!<br>
<span style="color:#ec5d53;">？？？：</span><br>
... That's not why I'm here. I am not here for the Key...<br>
At least not until I've brought someone close to me back.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Enterprise：</span><br>
You haven't answered my question! Are you friend or foe?!<br>
<span style="color:#ec5d53;">？？？：</span><br>
... ... ...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Enterprise：</span><br>
ANSWER ME!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Saratoga：</span><br>
Enterprise!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Enterprise：</span><br>
I'm okay, but stay alert, everyone! Enemy reinforcements, incoming!<br>
... Gah?!<br>
What is this...?!<br>
Where am I...? What happened...?!<br>
<span style="color:#ec5d53;">？？？：</span><br>
I've warned you about making unnecessary contact with others in this timeline.<br>
I shall hold them back. You... should know what to do.<br>
... Appreciate it.<br>
... There are a lot of them. Be careful.<br>
Understood.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Enterprise：</span><br>
Where do you think you're going?! Come back! Answer me...!<br>
<span style="color:#ec5d53;">？？？：</span><br>
You have no right to face her yet.<br>
I am Ember. I am residue, born from an exhausted flame. But my resentment of humankind still burns.<br>
Come! I shall appraise the strength of you beings from this timeline!<br>

<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Victorious：</span><br>
Sh-she's strong...!<br>
<span style="color:#ec5d53;">？？？：</span><br>
It appears her judgment was correct...<br>
This timeline - hidden out of sight by Antiochus - differs from all others we've seen.<br>
Perhaps it is because of the human with you - that commander.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Enterprise：</span><br>
(They mentioned Commander again...!)<br>
What exactly is it you're planning?! Why did you side with the Sirens and attack NY City?<br>
<span style="color:#ec5d53;">？？？：</span><br>
The attack on NY City... was no more than a ploy devised by the Antiochus. Its true purpose was for us to meet one another.<br>
As for us, we are but Ember and Ash in the wind. You need not concern yourself with our names.<br>
You cannot even begin to fathom the burden that we shoulder.<br>
Leave us be, and pray that our paths never cross again.<br>
... ...!<br>
<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项1：... ... ...</span>'''''<br>
<br>
"Locate and neutralize the ship responsible for the singularity"... I'm pretty sure that's what our orders from headquarters were...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Baltimore：</span><br>
All ships, fire!<br>
<br>
KABOOM!<br>

'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项1）</span>'''''Commander!<br>
<span style="color:#ec5d53;">？？？：</span><br>
... I had begun to believe you may be able to lead these girls...<br>
<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项2）</span>'''''Shells were speeding through the air, all targeting the mysterious ship. However, just as they were about to hit–<br>
<span style="color:#ec5d53;">？？？：</span><br>
But if you truly insist on standing in our way, then I will have to show you...<br>
... the limits of the strength which Antiochus has leased you!<br>
Swift death unto evil!<br>
<br>
There was a glimmer, followed by the sharp, swift sound of a sword's swing.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">North Carolina：</span><br>
She... slashed the shells to pieces?!<br>
<br>
A surging wave of energy came forth from the ship's sword, slashing shells, planes, and the very sea in twain.<br>
This immense power was like that of Bismarck's, possibly even stronger.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Washington：</span><br>
The hell?! My riggings aren't...?!<br>
<span style="color:#ec5d53;">？？？：</span><br>
This... is the reason why she suffers so... If I was to destroy it...<br>
<br>
The swordswoman faced me, seemingly preparing to attack.<br>
<span style="color:#ec5d53;">？？？：</span><br>
... If I was to destroy it...!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Enterprise：</span><br>
COMMANDEEEER!!!<br>
<span style="color:#ec5d53;">？？？：</span><br>
That's enough, we've already finished what we needed to do here.<br>
... ...<br>
... Pardon. I let myself go.<br>
It's fine. It won't matter in the long run.<br>
I've finished installing the Beacons. We should now be able to oppose "them."<br>
There's no need to fight these people anymore.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Enterprise：</span><br>
Why...<br>
Why did you stop that attack?!<br>
<span style="color:#ec5d53;">？？？：</span><br>
...<br>
Don't start making assumptions... I just...<br>
... Don't want to experience that regret twice...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Enterprise：</span><br>
... Huh?! This is...!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Victorious：</span><br>
It's the same light that the Crown emitted!<br>
<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项1：Look towards the mysterious ships</span>'''''<br>
<br>
Those two mysterious ships, so foreign but so familiar... Had I seen them before...?<br>
They seemed to stop to look at me. Without a word or a trace of hesitation, they turned and vanished into the light.<br>
As the light faded, the winds began to slow, the waters became placid, and the whirring of electronics returning to life could be heard throughout the fleet.<br>
The singularity which had covered the Bermuda Triangle was completely gone, as if nothing had ever happened.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Victorious：</span><br>
Do singularities... simply disappear like this?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Saratoga：</span><br>
It's finally over... For a minute there, Sara really had no idea what could happen~!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Enterprise：</span><br>
…………<br>
<br>
The danger was over, but the mystery was only getting deeper.<br>
We immediately contacted headquarters to inform them that the source of singularity was undoubtedly a ship. And yet, that was all the information we even could give them.<br>
We know nothing about this "Antiochus" or the ships that call themselves "Ember and Ash"...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Saratoga：</span><br>
Uhh, the singularity has disappeared, and the Siren fleet is in pieces, so...<br>
I guess that means the operation was a success! C'mon, Commander! Let's get everyone home already!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Washington：</span><br>
(That second ship doesn't look like she's from the Sakura Empire... but if she is...)<br>

<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Cleveland：</span><br>
Sweet, finally! Time to go home!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Victorious：</span><br>
Saratoga, what's the matter? You've looked deep in thought for some time now.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Saratoga：</span><br>
Oh, it's nothing! I was just thinking about what a long and exhausting operation this was!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Victorious：</span><br>
Right? It's nothing short of a miracle that we managed to keep everyone safe through all that!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Charles Ausburne：</span><br>
Of course we're okay! We're allies of justice after all!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Victorious：</span><br>
But if what they said is true - that the attack on NY City was just a ploy to lure us into the Bermuda Triangle - then what were the Sirens trying to achieve...?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Essex：</span><br>
Even up until the singularity disappeared, Tester didn't even show her face. I'm concerned about what she's brewing up next...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Montpelier：</span><br>
Until the Sirens have unconditionally surrendered, I'm sure we'll clash with her again.<br>
We'll have plenty of opportunities to slowly settle the score in the future.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Shangri-La：</span><br>
I would say that our discovery - that we can disrupt a singularity from forming - is a great leap forward for our knowledge.<br>
Hopefully, this will help progress our understand of the singularity's mechanisms and lead to the development of a safe method of eliminating them.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Baltimore：</span><br>
Commander, I heard you came across a Hornet impostor as well?<br>
How underhanded. They clearly were targeting Enterprise with a move like that!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Essex：</span><br>
After fighting the Sirens more, I think I'm starting to understand why they make these clones.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Shangri-La：</span><br>
We didn't have any problems dealing with the clones, but it's clear that they strive to confuse and demoralize us by forcing us to aim at the likeness of our own comrades.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Essex：</span><br>
(But Enterprise wouldn't fall for such cheap tricks! I wish I was more like her...))<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Shangri-La：</span><br>
That reminds me... Before we sortied, we ran into Memphis. She looked quite gloomy, grumbling things like, "heh heh heh, let's hope you have a pleasant voyage" to herself...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Enterprise：</span><br>
We did, too. She's been working extremely hard behind the scenes for us. I heard she went above and beyond by contacting headquarters, planning the operation, and writing documents.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Essex：</span><br>
S-so that's the reason why she seemed like a whole other person when we saw her...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Cleveland：</span><br>
Well, the operation went off without a hitch, so I think we should go on a vacation somewhere~ How about you guys?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Montpelier：</span><br>
I'll go with you. Wherever you're heading, I will follow.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Shangri-La：</span><br>
Hmm... If I get the time, I think I'd like to go someplace far away... Perhaps like the valley I was named after.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Essex：</span><br>
Where would you go, Enterprise?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Enterprise：</span><br>
I... don't really know. Even if the war was over...<br>
Commander... have you thought about what you'll do once this war is over?<br>
<br>

Well, well, congratulations. You've destroyed each and every last Siren in this area.<br>
Never did I think you would return to clean up. You must've been particularly fond of my play.<br>

Ah, "people"... What exactly do you mean by "people"?<br>
If you're referring to those Pawns, they were made specifically for your disposal. You can do with them as you please.<br>
Oh, but if you're talking about "those", they are simply research subjects. You may destroy those at will.<br>
Or perhaps... How curious... Just when "the Key" was within your grasp, why'd you let it slip between your fingers?<br>
<span style="color:#ec5d53;">？？？：</span><br>
……<br>
I will stop you, no matter what it takes.<br>

Oh, don't be like that. Being the Prototype that you are, we can always reconcile and be friends whenever you'd like.<br>
But you'll never save anyone if you keep walking down that path. You will only experience that same agonizing sorrow, again and again. And what a miserable life - frozen in time - that would be.<br>
Actually, you're just avoiding reality, aren't you?<br>
