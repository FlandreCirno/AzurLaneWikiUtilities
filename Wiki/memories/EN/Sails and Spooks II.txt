Sails and Spooks II<br>
<br>
1 Call of the Creeping Embrace<br>
I was forced to pause my hike up the mountain due to a sudden rainstorm. As there happened to be a mansion nearby, I decided to seek shelter there.<br>
If only I'd known what was in there...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">???：</span><br>
Feeble mortal. You are disturbing the Ancient Ruler's slumber.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Queen Anne's Revenge：</span><br>
A bunch of massive tentacles squirm inside a dark pond. Sitting there upon a crooked throne, a girl slowly opens her eyes.<br>
I am Queen Anne's Revenge, an ineffable supreme being.<br>
Wherewith whose permission do you, mortal, set foot upon this sacred ground?<br>
The tentacles move only slightly, but it feels like they're approaching with staggering might.<br>
Well... It would be a bit of a shame to just devour you right here and now.<br>
Saved by the bell. She seems to have changed her mind.<br>
Given how large and how daunting my sanctuary is to clean, I shall make a special exception for you.<br>
I will allow you to remain here as my retainer and serve me for the rest of your life.<br>
Make your choice. Will you submit, or will you be devoured?<br>
<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项1：Sounds like there's only one real option...</span>'''''<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项2：What's my salary like?</span>'''''<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Queen Anne's Revenge：</span><br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项1）</span>'''''Heheh. A wise decision.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Queen Anne's Revenge：</span><br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项2）</span>'''''Nonexistent. Refuse, and you'll be swiftly eaten whole.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Queen Anne's Revenge：</span><br>
The tentacles bring me up to her, and then hand two things to me.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">{playername}：</span><br>
Uh... A towel and soap?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Queen Anne's Revenge：</span><br>
This is your first task – clean my noble body.<br>
Remember this well: You will from now on be cleaning my tentacles thoroughly.<br>
All of them, down to the last sucker. Make sure you don't miss a spot!<br>
She flaunts a haughty attitude as she lifts her head, all but commanding me to accept her orders.<br>
Why are you just standing there? Get to it already.<br>
I do as I'm told, and begin carefully wiping down her body. Her look of displeasure gradually dissolves into a relaxed expression. She sometimes gives me a small nod to show satisfaction.<br>
Mhh... Aahh...<br>
Ohh... To make even a supreme being such as I feel this pleasure... Your technique is impeccable.<br>
Marvellous work, my diligent retainer.<br>
As a reward, I will permit you to partake in the supreme ritual of this god.<br>
Before I can even respond, several tentacles suddenly drag me into her bosom.<br>
I feel the warmth of her body through her thin clothes. Compared to the cold, damp tentacles, she's strangely hotter than I expected.<br>
You should be honoured to not just get to witness, but also be a part of this grand moment, mortal.<br>
You will now set aside all your worldly thoughts and surrender your soul to the Ancient Ruler.<br>
A growing number of tentacles begin to envelop us until, finally, they fill in the last bit of space between us.<br>
*pant*... *pant*...<br>
Soon, the Supreme One shall descend to us...<br>
Are you ready, my retainer, to fall into my abyss of nothingness?<br>

<br>
2 The Forbidden Slurp<br>
The wine cellar's door is kicked open with a loud bang, blowing a cloud of dust into the air.<br>
<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项1：Don't move! Drop your weapons!</span>'''''<br>
<br>
I am a legendary investigator tracking down a wicked occult society. My pursuit has been an exceedingly long one, spanning several continents.<br>
I found this hidden, underground wine cellar after receiving a tip from my informant. Rumors say that the occult society has been conducting experiments on a forbidden being down here.<br>
I was prepared for a firefight to unfold in this place, but now that I'm here, I don't see even a single person with a gun drawn.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Royal James：</span><br>
Instead, what I find is a dainty girl covered in some sticky liquid.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">???：</span><br>
Wuh... Uhh? H-hello...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Royal James：</span><br>
The innocent girl looks at me and slurs out a greeting with her index finger in her mouth.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">{playername}：</span><br>
Who are you?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Royal James：</span><br>
Royal... James. I'm Royal James!<br>
That's the one and only thing I know!<br>
Hey? Hey! Are you listening?<br>
Where am I? Who are you? Also, what am I?<br>
Her clueless barrage of questions interrupts my train of thought. All of a sudden, she crawls up right next to me.<br>
There is a massive tentacle behind her that wags around like a tail. It catches my eye.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">{playername}：</span><br>
...I get it now. You must be the forbidden being I got a tip about.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Royal James：</span><br>
Forbidden... being?<br>
I'm... a forbidden being!<br>
Judging by her reaction of immense joy, she seems to really like this "title."<br>
Heheh – I'm starting to like you a bit!<br>
You're a really interesting person! But why? Why are you more interesting than me?<br>
How are we different? What exactly sets us apart?<br>
Please tell me everything you know!<br>
<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项1：I'm an investigator.</span>'''''<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项2：I'm your creator.</span>'''''<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项3：Sadly, I know nothing.</span>'''''<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">{playername}：</span><br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项1）</span>'''''I'm an investigator, and I'm looking into a wicked occult society. You are a forbidden being that they created.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Royal James：</span><br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项1）</span>'''''I... I don't know what that means! But it sounds really interesting!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">{playername}：</span><br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项2）</span>'''''I'm an investigator, and I created an assistant through forbidden means to be my perfect partner in stopping a wicked occult society. That assistant is you.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Royal James：</span><br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项2）</span>'''''I'm your... perfect... assistant? I love that! It sounds so fascinating!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">{playername}：</span><br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项3）</span>'''''Sorry to say, but I don't know jack squat either. Hell, what is this place? Who are you? Who am I, for that matter?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Royal James：</span><br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项3）</span>'''''Huh? Whuh? Who is this place? Where are you? What am I?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Royal James：</span><br>
The tentacle behind her starts to move around happily.<br>
Wait... I can move this tentacle however I want?!<br>
This is so much fun! I want to try some things!<br>
Ahaha! Look at me! I'm flying!<br>
Let me try changing directions! Whoa, hahaha! That was close, but I'm having so much fun!<br>
This is sooo cool!<br>
Whew... That was a lot. Now I want to do something even funner.<br>
First, though, I need to land!<br>
Taking advantage of her momentum, she leaps at me before I can even react. She places all her weight on my chest.<br>
Her arms wrap around me, and her soft hair touches my neck, sending a tickling sensation throughout my body.<br>
Ever since I woke up, everything's seemed really fresh and interesting...<br>
But you! You're the most interesting thing of all!<br>
And I think you're keeping something from me. Heehee. Something really fun.<br>
I want to see every part of you!<br>

<br>
3 The Doubtful Madam of the Castle<br>
The night is wearing on, and an old castle in a remote wilderness enters my view.<br>
I open the front door, which produces an ancient creaking sound. My breath held, I carefully begin exploring this mysterious building.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Adventure：</span><br>
KRR-BOOM!<br>
Thunder roars. Its light illuminates the dark hall, and I spot a girl standing in front of a fountain of wine.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">???：</span><br>
A safe castle and a party no one knows of. This safe house is getting better and better.<br>
Wait... Huh?! Eeek! H-how did you get in here?!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">{playername}：</span><br>
Sorry if I'm disturbing you this late. See...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Adventure：</span><br>
I'm a lost adventurer, and I came here in search of a safe place to spend the night – I tell her that.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">???：</span><br>
L-lies! I planted traps everywhere outside the castle! You're saying you just avoided all of them, are you?<br>
No ordinary adventurer would have the skill for something like that!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Adventure：</span><br>
There is a look of nervousness and doubt on her face. The situation is gradually heading in a bad direction.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">???：</span><br>
Or what, did you just so happen to stumble upon my safe castle, then luck your way past all the traps?<br>
And moreover, then you accidentally made your way into this secret hall?<br>
You expect me to take your word for it when you're some intruder sneaking around?<br>
A-ha! I've figured you out. Someone as skilled as you could only be an assassin!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Adventure：</span><br>
Then Adventure's castle is no longer safe...<br>
Now I'm feeling uneasy... Extremely uneasy...<br>
I try really hard to explain that I'm telling the truth, and ask her to believe me.<br>
In addition, I open the bag I'm carrying and show it to her.<br>
Her gaze is fixated on my every move, and she looks curious yet vigilant. Unconsciously, she leans forward.<br>
You... don't have any weapons?<br>
But if this was a planned assassination, you'd obviously bring a weapon...<br>
No. That's not enough. It doesn't prove your innocence!<br>
I might believe you if you'll let me do a full-body search!<br>
Who's to say you aren't hiding weapons on your person, right?<br>
She suddenly comes close. I am not at all ready for this "full body search" out of the blue.<br>
Nothing here... Nor here...<br>
You really don't have any weapons... Are you telling me it truly was all a big coincidence?<br>
Fine. I'll believe you for now.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">{playername}：</span><br>
Okay, then–<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Adventure：</span><br>
Not so fast. Stay where you are.<br>
I said I believe you, not that I'll let you leave.<br>
There is a loud thud, and the door to the entrance is completely shut.<br>
Oh? Not one to panic, but to analyse the situation instead, hmm?<br>
So you stay calm, despite the trouble you're in now...<br>
Only a battle-hardened adventurer would be able to pull that off.<br>
Heh. I'll be frank – you've greatly piqued my interest!<br>
You will remain here, and you're going to amuse me with your adventure tales!<br>
Oh, but there's no rush. We'll have all the time in the world to ourselves here.<br>

<br>
4 Fallen Angel in the Dark Castle<br>
After a long journey, having overcome many difficulties along the way, I've finally made it to the deepest parts of the Dark Lord's castle jail, where her army has imprisoned my guardian angel.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Pearl：</span><br>
Is it you? Are you my benevolent saviour?<br>
Amidst faintly swaying lights, the angel's white wings are bound tightly by chains, greatly limiting her range of motion.<br>
She sees me, having just sneaked into the room. Her expression is curiously not one of relief that she'll be saved – rather, it looks more as though she's carefully examining something.<br>
So you've infiltrated the Dark Lord's dangerous castle all by yourself to save your beloved angel...<br>
Your bravery is truly a touching thing.<br>
<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项1：(Tell her you're getting her out.)</span>'''''<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">{playername}：</span><br>
I'm here to save you! Come on, let's get out of here!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Pearl：</span><br>
Oh, hero – my dear hero – you say you're here to "save me," but it's only you who thinks I need saving.<br>
Just the thought of leaving this wonderful place sends a throbbing pain through my heart.<br>
Say, why don't you come closer and feel how my heart aches?<br>
Ah, what is it, my hero? Why have you fallen silent?<br>
Are you perhaps enamored with the way I look now?<br>
Yearning for the visage of a pure angel, yet being unable to turn away from the titillating sight before you...<br>
I imagine there must be some quite fun things happening in your inner mind.<br>
She spreads her arms widely, and unfolds the wings behind her.<br>
She is beckoning me into her embrace, inviting me to a divine land overflowing with passion and lust.<br>
Heehee... You grasp it now, don't you?<br>
I've lost the goddess' blessings. I will never again be your guardian angel.<br>
Yet, even knowing this, you still look at me with those same gentle eyes, brimming with love... It tears me apart, hero.<br>
Perhaps, if you stay by my side, I may still be saved one day.<br>
When that day comes, maybe then the angel you know so well will return to you.<br>
As she smiles, her body twitches. A purple liquid with a sweet aroma catches the light, with little sparkles reflecting off of it.<br>
Oh, are you curious as to what this is, my dear hero?<br>
Why, it's quite a rare charming potion. I accidentally spilled a little of it just now. Would you please come and help me "collect" it?<br>
Naturally, you may even lick it off me if you so please.<br>
Her breath brushes against my face, carrying with it a really odd yet appealing scent.<br>
Heehee... It seems even my dear hero can't defy the call of temptation.<br>
That being the case, I will go all out.<br>
These chains, this black lingerie, these little pearls... I prepared them all just for you.<br>
Their purpose? To allow you to fully unleash your instincts♥<br>
Come... Discard your mask of heroism – and of humanity♥<br>
Here, we are just creatures of love, seeking only to endlessly lick and bite one another...<br>
Please, remain here... by my side. Forever and ever♥<br>

5 The Cursed Investigator<br>
A few days ago, Kronshtadt and I came to this abandoned village to investigate an inexplicable curse that affects this place.<br>
However, she hasn't yet shown up at the time we agreed to meet today. Concerned, I decided to go and check on her.<br>
I knock on the door.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Kronshtadt：</span><br>
Wh-who is it? Judging by the intensity of those knocks... Is it you, Comrade?<br>
Sorry, it's just... My attire. But I understand you'll be worried if you don't see me, so...<br>
Okay. I'm ready. Come in!<br>
I enter the room, and I'm met with Kronshtadt, but something is seriously wrong with her.<br>
The most eye-catching things are the black horns sprouting from her head, as well as the black tail behind her, wagging anxiously.<br>
As you can tell, this happened completely out of nowhere.<br>
I simply woke up, and then I looked like this...<br>
I couldn't make any sense of the situation, so I didn't dare just rush out... So sorry for keeping you waiting!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">{playername}：</span><br>
Nothing happened in all the prior days during our investigation, and now, all of a sudden... this.<br>
Don't tell me it's what I think it is...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Kronshtadt：</span><br>
Are you thinking that this is what's devastated the place?<br>
That it's a curse that turned all the people into animals? Our intel said nothing about that. In fact, it sounds like something out of a kids' ghost story.<br>
Well, our intel also said nothing about... this irresistible, primal urge I'm getting...<br>
She bites her lip, as though she's frantically trying to keep something within herself.<br>
Her gaze tells it like it is, however. Even as we speak, her eyes keep turning to the giant milk barrel in a corner of the room.<br>
Hey, um, Comrade... Could you bring me the straw that's over there?<br>
Wait, no! Never mind I said that! Forget it!<br>
I just suddenly felt something weird... Like my chest swelled a bit...<br>
Apropos of nothing, this curse should only affect your outside appearance, right?<br>
Because if so, that's no big deal at all for a seasoned investigator like myself! Right?!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">{playername}：</span><br>
Don't worry. I won't leave you.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Kronshtadt：</span><br>
Yeah. As long as I've got you, it won't take long to get used to looking like this.<br>
Ugh... But I really need to... No! I can't! I can't allow myself to let you down!<br>
She firmly grips the fence in front of her, seemingly to calm herself down. The look in her eyes is that of someone pleading for help.<br>
O-on a related note, I've heard that distracting yourself can relieve mental stress.<br>
Since I doubt I'll be able to investigate for a while, why don't we just... talk about something?<br>
Great! I knew I could count on you! Only problem is, I'm not sure what we could discuss.<br>
Incidentally, are you thirsty? Do you want some milk?<br>
No, wait! I can't believe I just said that... I'm thinking this curse might affect your mind, too!<br>
When viewed another way, though, if you want to beat magic, you have to fight fire with fire, so...<br>
O-okay, this is just a theory, but what if these things happening to me aren't interference on the curse's part, but rather the solution to it?<br>
It's about not being bound by form, learning to unleash your instincts, and being true to yourself...<br>
Yeah... That's it! It's got to be!<br>
She nods along as she mutters to herself, before finally taking a deep breath.<br>
If I'm wrong about this, then I'll accept that. Here goes...<br>
Comrade, would you like some fresh milk?!<br>

<br>
6 Tail-Stirred Cocktail<br>
It's now day two of my investigation into this nightclub.<br>
According to my leads, the bartender here serves a special kind of cocktail. Anyone who drinks it supposedly becomes a rabid fan of hers.<br>
However you cut it, there has to be some foul play going on here.<br>
My investigation yesterday yielded nothing, so tonight, I'm going to be infiltrating under the guise of a lost customer.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">???：</span><br>
Hmph. Found you, you sneaky little rat.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">{playername}：</span><br>
Whuh?!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Izumo：</span><br>
BANG!<br>
As I slowly shake off this dizziness, my eyes open to a strangely familiar ceiling.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">{playername}：</span><br>
A... detached room in the nightclub?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">???：</span><br>
You awake?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Izumo：</span><br>
A beautiful lady sitting in a gorgeous chair addresses me in a deep voice.<br>
There is a crystal glass in her hand. She gently runs her slender fingers around it while tapping the chair's leather surface with her tail.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">???：</span><br>
You're the one who went sniffing around the club last night, aren't you?<br>
You caught me off guard, and you got away once. Here you are again, except you've gotten further this time.<br>
Curiosity killed the cat, Investigator. You should know better.<br>
That said, I respect your bravery.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Izumo：</span><br>
I'll reward you with a little info. I am Izumo, the bartender you're so curious about.<br>
Now tell me – who hired you? I'll give you twice whatever they're paying if you tell me everything.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">{playername}：</span><br>
(I'm not only in the dark on the situation, but also her captive now... I'll just have to improvise.)<br>
<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项1：(Tell her you came by your own volition.)</span>'''''<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">{playername}：</span><br>
I'm not working for anybody. I'm doing this investigation of my own volition.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Izumo：</span><br>
Are you? Hah. Interesting.<br>
Her eyes narrow and she smiles, as though she just remembered something pleasant.<br>
"Your own volition." You really don't know how this works at all.<br>
I'm sure you know what you're in for now that I've sniffed you out.<br>
Well, I'll level with you – I used to solve things with violence, but now I prefer to talk it out over drinks.<br>
After all, why wouldn't you want a friend like me, eh?<br>
Here's what we'll do. If you're still sober after you've drunk my cocktail, I'll let you leave, and even tell you the secret behind this glass.<br>
You've got one chance, so make it count. What do you say?<br>
Heh – alright. This was your decision. I didn't force you.<br>
Let's get started.<br>
Wow, you've had a lot. You can really hold your liquor compared to the average person.<br>
Hm? Now do as I promised?<br>
Hah. I'm surprised you still remember.<br>
Of course. A promise is a promise, and I'm a woman of her word.<br>
You want to know the secret of what's in this cocktail? It's this...<br>
She lifts her tail, and reveals an injection hole at the tip of it, from which a slimy, pink liquid slowly oozes out.<br>
Got it? That's the secret.<br>
I can feel it – your heart is racing, and your breathing is getting rough.<br>
You want it, don't you? You're like someone who's found an oasis in the middle of a desert. Don't deny yourself.<br>
The ceiling light starts to dim little by little. I feel an odd sensation on my lips.<br>
There's more if you want it. That's right. Keep drinking.<br>
Stop your pointless struggle. I'll give you what you want, and free you from everything.<br>

<br>
7 Broken Through the Mind's Defenses<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Lyme：</span><br>
Hmph. Here to try to break my will again? Nothing new is going to happen. I will not yield!<br>
Lying down in a dark, metallic cage, Lyme musters the strength to lift her head.<br>
Her hands are bound behind her back, and from the gleam in her eyes, it looks like whatever sanity she has left is giving way to pure fury.<br>
How will you try to break me this time?<br>
Lying out a pack of coloured pencils neatly, then purposefully turning one upside down, like last time?<br>
Or will it be like the time before that, when you placed a pile of asymmetrical clothes in front of me?<br>
Do you really think that these petty annoyances are going to break me?<br>
Because you will NOT have your way with me!<br>
The golden glimmer in her eyes intensifies, and the belt restricting her movement squeaks.<br>
However, the angrier she becomes, the deeper she realizes that she is powerless to escape this cage.<br>
This is the sight that greets me. Following a piece of intel, I've come to the Dark Lord army's secret chamber to rescue Lyme, who's been captured by this corrupting trap.<br>
Wait... Are you... the Commander?<br>
Hmph. Your brute-force measures weren't working, so now you've resorted to disguises. What a shrewd trick.<br>
...I'm safe now? No, you don't understand! You don't know what I've experienced!<br>
Curse your Dark Lord and your vile army...<br>
Once I break out of here, I will round you all up and put you in the ground!<br>
Her anger has reached its peak. Maybe it'll get her to calm down if I undo her restraints.<br>
Spurred on by that thought, I pry open the cage's lock and step inside...<br>
W-wait, that familiar aura... Is it really you?!<br>
Just as I'm about to nod, her joyful expression suddenly takes a dark turn.<br>
She twists her body furiously in disregard of her own well-being to get closer to me.<br>
You need to get away, Commander! The state I'm in now is extremely dangerous to you!<br>
The trap that snared me was imbued with some sort of special, evil power!<br>
At this point, I'm no longer fully able to control myself!<br>
Urgh... Agh... I think I'm at my limit!<br>
Aah! Aaaggghhh!<br>
This feeling... It's awful... Commander!<br>
I need to release this power... That's the only way!<br>
All of a sudden, in a display of superhuman strength, she simply rips through her restraints.<br>
Through the dust cloud that comes after, she stares at me, and slowly walks forward.<br>
I tried to warn you, Commander.<br>
There is no one but you and me in this chamber now.<br>
Which means... you're not getting away.<br>

8 The Alchemist's Whispered Feelings<br>
I am a modest alchemist, and I'm a little different from others.<br>
In truth, an alchemical experiment of mine went awry, and for some reason, it sent me to a strange new land.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Harutsuki：</span><br>
Um, Professor! Look! I finished my first alchemical assignment without a hitch!<br>
So cute... I didn't think ghosts would like this sort of thing.<br>
This is my disciple, who I recently took on. She used to be a "shrine maiden," whatever that is.<br>
Under my guidance, she has made slow but steady strides toward becoming an excellent alchemist.<br>
Ah, I can't wait...<br>
Professor, is it true that the cute ghosties are drawn to this gel?<br>
Y-you said they are, and I believe you, of course! I've just never seen it before, and I'm excited to get to do it.<br>

Did you never see any ghosts when you were a shrine maiden?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Harutsuki：</span><br>
Well, I diiid...<br>
But I don't think the ghosts I saw back then were the same as what you're talking about.<br>
By that, I mean the ghosties you've told me about sound adorable just from the name alone.<br>
She gives me an awkward smile. Just as I reach out to pat her head, the flames of the candles standing on the table suddenly flicker.<br>
Eek!<br>
Everything goes dark for a moment, only to return to normal just a blink of the eye later.<br>
She releases her embrace around me, her cheeks red and flushed. Out of sheer embarrassment, she turns her back to me.<br>
...Oh! W-wait! Professor!<br>
L-l-look! They actually showed up!<br>
It's them! Actual ghosties!<br>
Translucent creatures with adorable looks hover near the door, staring at us while looking slightly afraid.<br>
Harutsuki grasps my fingers, her eyes glowing with excitement.<br>
Sensing that we mean them no harm, the ghostly creatures slowly approach us.<br>
One ghostie, two ghosties, three...<br>
That's a lot of them! Um, Professor, do you think they'll like the gel I made for them?<br>
If they don't really like it, do you think they'll just... leave?<br>
Th-that won't happen, right?<br>
We made the gel together, so it SHOULD be perfectly good! Just as you said!<br>
I'm feeling confident now, if only just a little! Heehee.<br>
Oh! Th-they just ate some of the gel!<br>
I was having so much fun chatting with you that I almost missed it.<br>
Heehee – they look like they really enjoy the taste of it!<br>
I've learned so much since I came under your tutelage, Professor. Words can't express how grateful I am to you.<br>
You're always so considerate with regard to my growth, and I want to return your goodwill somehow!<br>
Oh, um, since we happen to have a hot bath running...<br>
Would you... have a soak?<br>
Y-you mean it? In that case, leave the cleansing! I've been practicing for this for– No, I mean, I've been thinking about it for quite some time!<br>
O-okay, now please turn your back to me. I'll make sure to clean it thoroughly!<br>
