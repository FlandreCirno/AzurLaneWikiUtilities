A Lady's Modest Proposal<br>
<br>
Chapter 1 - The Secret Spot<br>
While taking a stroll through the port in the nice, warm sunshine, I noticed Illustrious up ahead of me.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Illustrious：</span><br>
Though I was wondering if she was going to head to the Royal Navy's dorms, I instead saw her pass it by and head somewhere else.<br>
<br>
Curious about her destination, I decided to follow her.<br>
Walking up along a narrow path, I arrived at a breathtaking place that offered a panoramic view of the port.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Illustrious：</span><br>
Oh my. Commander?<br>
You must have followed me here without my noticing. It would have been nice if you had called out to me...<br>
<br>
"Sorry... I followed you without thinking."<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Illustrious：</span><br>
I found this place a few days ago. It's my new favourite secret spot.<br>
I'm sure that you already know that Her Highness, myself, and the others partake in tea parties from time to time.<br>
I was thinking that I'd really like to hold the next tea party at this beautiful location.<br>
<br>
"That's a great idea," I told her. Upon hearing this, she gave me a cute smile.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Illustrious：</span><br>
Hearing you say that makes me very happy. Well then, I suppose I should start making preparations for it!<br>
Saying that, she turned to head off. However, I spotted a tree root sticking out right where her foot was.<br>
<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项1：Watch out! Take my hand!</span>'''''<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项2：Rush to her side before she hurts herself.</span>'''''<br>
<br>
*boing*<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Illustrious：</span><br>
Th-thank you, Commander. I'm kind of a klutz, so this happens a lot...<br>
<br>
While her body was still glued to mine, Illustrious gave me an inquisitive look.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Illustrious：</span><br>
...Commander?<br>
<br>
Because I knew I couldn't stay like this forever, I calmed my beating heart and let her go.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Illustrious：</span><br>
It'll be lunchtime soon. Shall we return? The others might be wondering where we are.<br>
<br>
Differently from how we arrived, the two of us left her secret spot together, descending the slope in a single-file line.<br>

<br>
Chapter 2 - Consultation<br>
When I exited the office after finishing up all of my work, Illustrious was waiting for me at the door.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Illustrious：</span><br>
Good afternoon, Commander.<br>
I believe I told you about my desire to hold a tea party at the secret spot we visited together yesterday.<br>
Won't you come join us, Commander?<br>
<br>
Gladly accepting her proposal, I asked if there was anything I could help out with.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Illustrious：</span><br>
I'd be overjoyed to have you help me, but... wouldn't it be a hassle for you?<br>
<br>
I told her it wouldn't be a problem. That settled, we started to look for things we'd need for the tea party.<br>
Though we struggled for a bit, in the end, we were able to bring a white table and some chairs up the slope to the secret spot.<br>
This was more back-breaking work than I had thought. Exhausted, the two of us both leaned back into the chairs we had brought.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Illustrious：</span><br>
...Mmn...<br>
<br>
It seemed like Illustrious was deep in thought.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Illustrious：</span><br>
Oh, I'm sorry... It's just that, a while ago, Ms. Littorio sent me a letter inviting me to dinner.<br>
However, I was very busy at that time, so I forgot to send her a response. I'm worried about what I should do now...<br>
<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项1：Why don't you invite her to the tea party?</span>'''''<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Illustrious：</span><br>
Invite her to the tea party...? Oh, why, that's a wonderful idea!<br>
Ah, the letter also said that she wished to speak with Formidable as well, so I relayed the message to her, but...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Formidable：</span><br>
"I appreciate the invitation, but on that day, I have plans to rock in my– Err, enjoy some music."<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Illustrious：</span><br>
...Is the reason she said she couldn't be in attendance.<br>
I really wanted her to come to the tea party, but... I'm sure she really likes the new craze. That's why I think it'll be really hard to get her to come...<br>
<br>
I told Illustrious that I'd help her write a response to Littorio and try to convince Formidable to attend.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Illustrious：</span><br>
Hehe. You're a really nice person, Commander.<br>
Well, if you'd be so kind...<br>
<br>
Illustrious seemed to feel more relaxed as she pulled her chair up next to mine. My heart started to pound as I noticed that Illustrious was so close that our shoulders were about to touch.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Illustrious：</span><br>
For my letter to Ms. Littorio, I should start off by apologising for my late response... right?<br>
<br>
While praying fervently that she couldn't hear my heart exploding in my chest, I thought about how Illustrious should respond.<br>

<br>
Chapter 3 - An Unexpected Disaster?<br>
After finishing writing the letters, I escorted Illustrious back to the Royal Navy's dorms.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Illustrious：</span><br>
A member of the Royal Maids will be setting the tableware for the tea party. Is there anything else we need to do?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Unicorn：</span><br>
G-good afternoon! What are you two talking about...?<br>
<br>
Unicorn, who had just been passing by, came up to us with a curious look on her face.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Illustrious：</span><br>
Oh! I'd love to get your thoughts too, Unicorn.<br>
<br>
Illustrious told Unicorn about how she was planning a tea party to be held at her beautiful secret spot.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Unicorn：</span><br>
Preparing for a tea party? I want to help out too...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Illustrious：</span><br>
Oh, come to think of it. We didn't bring a parasol to block out the sun.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Unicorn：</span><br>
I think I saw one at the storehouse earlier!<br>
<br>
Unicorn guided us to the storehouse. Inside were a variety of parasols with different designs, all stored away.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Illustrious：</span><br>
The table and chairs we're going to be using are all white, so let's look for a white one.<br>
<br>
Everyone split up to look for a white parasol.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Illustrious：</span><br>
All of these don't fit well enough... It'd be nice if there was a high-quality one...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Unicorn：</span><br>
Eek!<br>
<br>
When I turned toward the source of the noise, Unicorn was swaying unsteadily on top of a ladder propped in front a shelf.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Illustrious：</span><br>
Unicorn! When did you manage to get up so high?!<br>
<br>
Nobody had been watching out for each other. It was probably because everyone was so absorbed in their search.<br>
The moment Illustrious and I rushed over to help her, Unicorn lost her balance and fell off the ladder.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Unicorn：</span><br>
...Nooo!<br>
...Y-you caught me...?<br>
<br>
Fortunately, I caught Unicorn just in the nick of time as she fell off the ladder. I breathed a sigh of relief.<br>
Illustrious had supported the falling ladder so it didn't crash into the floor, and thus, we somehow made it.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Illustrious：</span><br>
Are you alright, Unicorn?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Unicorn：</span><br>
I-I'm sorry, you two... There was a really nice parasol up at the top...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Illustrious：</span><br>
No, it's our fault for not being careful. But make sure you're not reckless like this next time, you hear?<br>
<br>
Illustrious stroked Unicorn's hair gently.<br>
Her expression was full of affection, as if Unicorn were her real sister.<br>

Chapter 4 - Heart-pounding Intimacy?!<br>
The parasol Unicorn had spotted was indeed a very fancy one. We should hurry up and put it to use.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Unicorn：</span><br>
Umm, can I help out?<br>
<br>
It seemed safe enough, so I decided to let her help out.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Unicorn：</span><br>
We did it!<br>
<br>
After successfully setting the parasol inside the table, Unicorn sat down on a chair next to her.<br>
She must be happy that she was able to help out. She's quite the reserved one, but I could tell that much.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Illustrious：</span><br>
Hehe, Unicorn seems very happy. It's almost like she hadn't been feeling downhearted at all just a bit earlier.<br>
<br>
Illustrious looked at Unicorn gleefully, then sat down next to me.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Illustrious：</span><br>
She's such a lovely child. Sometimes it feels like she's my real sister. Though, I do worry that I'm not a very good sister to her...<br>
As long as I can cover for her shortcomings while she's still a young girl, that's enough for me...<br>
<br>
Even so, I'm sure that Unicorn trusts you and depends on you.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Illustrious：</span><br>
You're always so nice, Commander. Heehee~<br>
<br>
Illustrious showed me a dazzling, pure smile. Staring at it made me a bit embarrassed, so I turned away from her.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Illustrious：</span><br>
What else was there to do... Right, we need to make sure to prepare some cups as well...<br>
...Commander?<br>
<br>
When Illustrious saw me stretching my arms, she looked down at the ground with dejection.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Illustrious：</span><br>
...Of course you'd be exhausted, after carrying so many heavy things all day.<br>
Um, would you like it if I gave a light massage?<br>
<br>
Acceding to my pounding heart, I accepted Illustrious's unexpected proposal.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Illustrious：</span><br>
Then, if you don't mind, please come over here.<br>
<br>
Though I was immensely nervous when I felt the sensation of Illustrious's fingers intertwined with mine, I let go of her hand slowly,<br>
I let go of her hand and sat down. Just then, I felt Illustrious place her hands on my shoulders.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Illustrious：</span><br>
This is my first time massaging someone's shoulders, so it may not feel that good...<br>
<br>
As she doesn't have her rigging equipped, she may not be able to put as much strength into her massage as she hoped.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Illustrious：</span><br>
Here we go... Mmn... How does it feel?<br>
<br>
Honestly, my brain didn't even register that as a massage.<br>
The only sensation I felt was that of something soft hitting my back, over and over again...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Illustrious：</span><br>
Mgh... Ahh... Hrmh... Commander, am I using the right amount of force...?<br>
<br>
Fearing her massage would energize me in the wrong way if this continued, I decided to hastily excuse myself.<br>

<br>
Chapter 5 - The Little Sister's Opinion<br>
It's been a bit since Illustrious went to the Royal Maids' headquarters to give them the cups they would use during the tea party...<br>
Just as I was getting bored out of my mind, I heard someone's voice from near the foot of the hill.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Victorious：</span><br>
I see, so this is where you're planning on holding your tea party~<br>
<br>
Standing next to Illustrious was her little sister, Victorious.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Victorious：</span><br>
Hello there, Commander. My sister just told me about this place and it sounded interesting, so I had her bring me over.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Illustrious：</span><br>
How is it, Victorious? Don't you think I've found quite the spectacular place?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Victorious：</span><br>
Well, it certainly has a nice view, but... aren't the two of you forgetting about something veeery important?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Illustrious：</span><br>
Something important? What could that be...?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Victorious：</span><br>
You're forgetting that the road that leads to a beautiful place should be beautiful as well!<br>
The road to this hill just won't do. It's hard to walk up here because it's covered with branches and fallen leaves.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Illustrious：</span><br>
Now that you mention it...<br>
I always lose my balance when I look down, so I never look at the ground...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Victorious：</span><br>
Don't brag about how big your knockers are!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Illustrious：</span><br>
Brag... about my... knockers...?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Victorious：</span><br>
Ugh... You really are something else!<br>
Commander, keep an eye on my sister, would you? Make sure she doesn't fall over when cleaning and such!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Illustrious：</span><br>
Commander, I apologise, but... Would you mind helping me just a bit more?<br>
<br>
Of course I had no intention of turning her down. I extended my hand toward her to show my willingness, but...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Illustrious：</span><br>
Commander...?<br>
<br>
I was trying to express that we should hurry because the day was getting dark, but she didn't seem to understand that, and looked at my hand with perplexment.<br>
As I was wondering if what I did was really that strange, Illustrious suddenly spoke.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Illustrious：</span><br>
...Okay. Thank you.<br>
<br>
Illustrious hesitantly reached for my hand, and wrapped her thin, soft fingers around mine.<br>
Everything was almost ready for the tea party. Knowing that this would soon end, I felt a bit regretful...<br>

Chapter 6 - Holding Hands, Once More<br>
Quite some time had passed since we started cleaning...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Illustrious：</span><br>
Commander, look at that! There's such a beautiful sunset.<br>
<br>
It was as Illustrious had said. Looking out from the secret spot, the sunset was brilliantly painting the port a bright red.<br>
We had to return to port before it got too dark. There wasn't time to waste.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Illustrious：</span><br>
...And with this, the cleaning is done.<br>
Commander, thank you so much for staying with me all day today.<br>
I'm sure this tea party will be the best there ever was. Really, I'm so grateful for all you've done.<br>
<br>
Illustrious feels a bit weird, just like earlier... Kind of like she's restraining herself...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Illustrious：</span><br>
Well, let us return now.<br>
<br>
When Illustrious declared that and started to walk, her foot got caught by the same tree root she was caught by yesterday...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Illustrious：</span><br>
Ah...<br>
<br>
Having lost her balance completely, she broke into a trot.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Victorious：</span><br>
"Commander, make sure you take good care of my sister. Make sure she doesn't fall over when cleaning and such!"<br>
<br>
I need to make it... Worrying about Illustrious, I flew over to where Illustrious was.<br>
*boing*<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Illustrious：</span><br>
Commander?!<br>
<br>
Because I had focused only on bolting to her side, I ended up holding Illustrious in a tighter embrace than the previous day.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Illustrious：</span><br>
Th-thank you...<br>
Tripping not just once, but twice on it... It'd be good to take care of that tree root...<br>
<br>
Illustriously softly broke free from my grasp. Her cheeks were dyed a deep red from the sunset.<br>
...No, I wonder if they really were dyed from the sunset.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Illustrious：</span><br>
Commander, um...<br>
Since it's evening, the shadows cast by the trees are going to make it hard to see what's on the ground.<br>
If it's alright with you... can we hold hands like earlier...?<br>
<br>
Without even thinking for a moment about saying no, I gave her my hand. Illustrious, who seemed to be a bit embarrassed, grabbed it gently.<br>
Slowly matching her pace, I continued to escort her down the hill.<br>

<br>
Chapter 7 - Our Special Spot<br>
It was the day of the tea party.<br>
While there were many troubles along the way, we were able to successfully host a tea party at the secret spot Illustrious found.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Littorio：</span><br>
I'm enthralled to be invited to an elegant tea party like this by a beautiful signorina such as yourself. The scenery here is truly wonderful.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Unicorn：</span><br>
Hehe... Hood just complimented me on finding this parasol. I'm so happy.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Victorious：</span><br>
Seriously, I'm still impressed by how beautiful the port looks from up here.<br>
I mean, the path's been cleared up and all. I think we should continue to have tea parties here from time to time in the future. How about it?<br>
<br>
The secret spot Illustrious had found received a storm of positive reactions.<br>
The black tea and neatly lined-up sweets were all tasty as well. It was satisfying to see everyone enjoying themselves.<br>
It felt as if I had just completed a big task. Wanting to be alone for a bit, I separated from the group.<br>
While I was looking down at the wide view of the port, Illustrious came to my side.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Illustrious：</span><br>
There's no wind today and the sea looks so calm.<br>
It's wonderful weather, without even a single cloud. The transparent, azure sea is so still... I had never thought that the weather would be this great on the day of the tea party.<br>
This is the image of peace, that which I love the most.<br>
<br>
I can hear the relaxing sound of waves from the sea, sparkling beneath the sun's rays.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Illustrious：</span><br>
Commander...<br>
<br>
Our gazes meet. Neither of us say a word, we simply grasp each other's hands.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Illustrious：</span><br>
Commander, you always grasp my hands so gently. And... you're always so warm...<br>
Um... If you don't mind, could you spare some time to come to this place with me again? Just the two of us...<br>
This time, it won't be to prepare for a tea party. I'd like you... to tell me more about yourself.<br>
<br>
Saying that, Illustrious graced me with an angelic smile.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Illustrious：</span><br>
Hehe. Let's talk about other things too. I... have many things about myself that I wish to tell you.<br>
<br>
I'm sure... If it's the two of us, we'll have so much to talk about that we won't have enough time for it all.<br>
And that means we'll have to revisit this place, time and time again.<br>
This beautiful and peaceful place. Our secret spot...<br>
