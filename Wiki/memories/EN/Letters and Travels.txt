1 Opening Ceremony<br>
Scapa Flow - Ceremony Venue<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Suffolk：</span><br>
Whew... Everything is finally in place. It took a lot of work, but I did it!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Hermione ：</span><br>
Great work. Although I'm afraid this chair is in the wrong place, and the banner behind the podium is a little misaligned.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Suffolk：</span><br>
Don't sweat the small stuff! Nobody will notice!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Hermione ：</span><br>
I'll have someone else take care of it. You can head to the dessert room and start on that next.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Suffolk：</span><br>
Awww... Just when I thought I could catch a break...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Sheffield：</span><br>
There you are, Suffolk.<br>
Why are you in here and not outside, welcoming the guests as Belfast asked you to?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Suffolk：</span><br>
Oh right, that's what I was supposed to do! I'll be right there!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Hermione ：</span><br>
Oh, my apologies. I found Suffolk staring at the clouds outside, so I decided to ask her to set up things around here.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Sheffield：</span><br>
That explains that, then. Speaking of which, are you finished in here?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Hermione ：</span><br>
Not yet – it's quite a lot bigger than I anticipated. But worry not, I'll finish on schedule!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Sheffield：</span><br>
That's what I like to hear. If you'll excuse me, I have to get back to my station.<br>
We have some very important guests tonight. We cannot slack on security.<br>
<br>
Scapa Flow - Pier<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Renown：</span><br>
Incredible. This place has already recovered so well after all the damage the Sirens did in that battle...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Repulse：</span><br>
You can thank the manjuu construction corps for that. Those little guys are rather capable.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Renown：</span><br>
Yes, but we should be ashamed that a critical part of our naval infrastructure has come under attack so many times!<br>
We must defend it to the last woman henceforth and never let such a thing happen again.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Repulse：</span><br>
Yes, and we shall do just that.<br>
For now, just settle down. Scapa Flow is back in business, and that's what we're here to celebrate.<br>
Brighten up, Renown. Hood's going to be in attendance, and you wouldn't want to disgrace the Royal Knights by facing her with a frown, would you?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Renown：</span><br>
You're right. I must conduct myself properly on this occasion for Her Majesty's and Lady Hood's sake!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Repulse：</span><br>
There you go! That's more like the Renown I know.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Renown：</span><br>
All right, enough frivolities. Look sharp and let's head for the ceremony venue.<br>
...Incidentally, where even is it?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Repulse：</span><br>
No idea. Belfast said someone would come get us, but I don't see anyone here.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Suffolk：</span><br>
P-pardon my tardiness! <br>
I'll show you to the venue. Follow me, please.<br>
<br>
Scapa Flow - Ceremony Venue<br>
A cannon salute and fireworks were set off at the open-air venue to commemorate the occasion.<br>
Friedrich's plan had succeeded, resulting in the elimination of a key Siren. However, Scapa Flow sustained significant damage in the battle.<br>
The Royal Navy and Eagle Union attributed this damage to the Sirens in their formal report to Naval HQ.<br>
And so, this ceremony serves two purposes – to keep up appearances, and to celebrate this great leap forward.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Abercrombie：</span><br>
Gee, granny Hood's awfully late.<br>
<br>
As the curtain rose on the opening ceremony, Hood – the guest of honor – was nowhere to be seen.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Repulse：</span><br>
Wonder if something came up that she has to tend to...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Renown：</span><br>
Lady Hood is punctual and a lady of her word. She wouldn't miss this event for the world.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Repulse：</span><br>
She's not one to keep Naval HQ representatives waiting either, but she IS late...<br>
I can't imagine she's engaging Sirens either. They'd have to be mad to attack when practically our whole navy is here.<br>
Maybe the Royal Maids know what's up?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Renown：</span><br>
They aren't acting out of the ordinary, so I don't believe so... I'll have a look around the area. You stay here, Repulse.<br>
<br>
Just as Renown rose from her seat to do some sleuthing, an alarm went off.<br>
BWEEEEE! BWEEEEE!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Repulse：</span><br>
What's that?! The air raid siren?!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Renown：</span><br>
How?! They couldn't possibly have slipped through our anti-air patrols!<br>
<br>
Panic broke out across the venue as the warning alarm kept blaring.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Belfast：</span><br>
Dear guests, please calm down. We assure you everything is fine.<br>
This venue is under the protection of the Royal Navy's finest shipgirls. Any Siren aircraft headed this way will be shot down before they reach the harbour.<br>
However, as a precautionary measure, please follow our staff to the on-site bunker.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Renown：</span><br>
I don't understand... The alarm shouldn't sound if our fleets can eliminate the planes well before they get near us...<br>
Belfast, me and Repulse shall sortie as well. Kindly tell us where the enemy is!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Belfast：</span><br>
Of course. Our patrols are currently spread out over a wide perimeter beyond the bay.<br>
Please join up with King George's support fleet. They shall be setting sail to assist the patrols shortly.<br>
As for the rest of the ceremony... I'm afraid to say it needs to be cancelled.<br>

2 Behind Closed Doors<br>
Scapa Flow - Harbor Facility<br>
Deep inside a building within the harbor was a room fit for a royal, were it not for the many medical devices and cables littering it.<br>
At the very center of the ornate room lay the patient under care. She sat upright to speak to the shipgirl by her side.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Hood：</span><br>
I've said it before, but this is excessive, Your Majesty.<br>
My injuries from that battle have long since healed. You needn't go out of your way to tend to me.<br>
I'll miss the ceremony altogether if I don't hurry. I'd hate to tarnish your honour like that.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Queen Elizabeth：</span><br>
Forget about the ceremony. It's already been cancelled.<br>
We'll just blame it on the Sirens seeking reckless vengeance for us taking out one of their top-ranking units.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Hood：</span><br>
But... Your Majesty...<br>
Very well. I'll do as you say and rest a while longer.<br>
I apologise for my sickliness. As I said, I've made a full recovery, so this must be a simple bout of fatigue.<br>
It doesn't warrant you personally tending to me, Your Majesty, especially not if you risk raising Naval HQ's suspicions in doing so.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">King George V：</span><br>
That's enough, Hood. You need to rest, not worry about appearances.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Hood：</span><br>
But a lady must. I'd poured so much effort into my speech for the ceremony, too...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">King George V：</span><br>
I was opposed to you delivering that speech from the very start.<br>
Even if it's the greatest of our time and perfectly reframes the events of the battle to suit our narrative, I will not let you risk your health for it.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Hood：</span><br>
Please, I've rested enough to at least–<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Queen Elizabeth：</span><br>
No, you've not. You've pushed yourself too far as it is.<br>
Listen. We got data from the Commander and the Iron Blood, and what it revealed is quite bad. You've not fully recovered. Far from it, your health is deteriorating.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">King George V：</span><br>
Dear god. It seems the injuries Bismarck inflicted using that Black Cube run far deeper than any of us realised.<br>
It's no wonder you passed out and had to be brought in here.<br>
Hood... I know you were looking forward to this day, but you must put your health before the Royal Navy's image.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Queen Elizabeth：</span><br>
What I just told you is strictly confidential. Naval HQ must never hear a word of it!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">King George V：</span><br>
Of course. My lips are sealed.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Hood：</span><br>
That is terrible news... Your Majesty, George, please forgive me.<br>
My failure has sullied the glory of the Royal Navy.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">King George V：</span><br>
It's all right. Remember, Bismarck vanished completely, then suddenly returned one day. You doing the same is not out of the question.<br>
Excuse me, but I need to see to our Siren coverup now. Take care and rest up, Hood.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Hood：</span><br>
I will, and thank you. Be safe.<br>
...Your Majesty, based on what you just said... There is no healing my wounds, is there? The Royal Navy lacks the cure Bismarck had.<br>
If I'm living on borrowed time, then I'm willing to give what little I've left... for the glory of the Royal Navy...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Queen Elizabeth：</span><br>
What? What do you mean?!<br>
<br>
The queen demanded an explanation, but all she got was silence.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Queen Elizabeth：</span><br>
Hood...<br>

3 A Cure<br>
Scapa Flow - Harbor Facility<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Queen Elizabeth：</span><br>
Did Hood's inspection reveal anything?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Warspite：</span><br>
Yes, Your Majesty. As you surmised, there's indeed something left within the wounds she suffered. Whatever it is, it's getting progressively worse.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Queen Elizabeth：</span><br>
Then it won't be long before she'll be confined to her sickbed for the rest of her days.<br>
All the samples and information we've received from Bismarck, Algérie, and so many others have been insufficient to develop a permanent cure...<br>
Perhaps different hulls respond differently and there is no universal, permanent cure. But then what options do we have left to pursue?<br>
Hood never used the power of the Black Cube, so why would a normal injury cause...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Warspite：</span><br>
Your Majesty, we could try asking Bismarck to examine Hood directly.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Queen Elizabeth：</span><br>
No bloody way. Naval HQ and the Sirens would catch on to us instantly.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Warspite：</span><br>
But procuring a Black Cube of our own is beyond the scope of what the Royal Navy can do...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Queen Elizabeth：</span><br>
I'm aware of that, but we cannot continue relying on others for help.<br>
Naval HQ knows what the Iron Blood did during that battle, and they've taken measures to prevent anything like that from happening again.<br>
It would be pure recklessness to collude with other factions right now.<br>
Friedrich no doubt anticipated this, and that's why she chose to bow out at such a convenient time.<br>
The most anyone can do for us at the moment is share information. Everything beyond that is up to us and us alone.<br>
We know the Sirens are never going to deliver us a Black Cube on a silver platter.<br>
Therefore, we must look beyond the Black Cube and another approach.<br>
We already have the means to do so. The Iron Blood's gateway is now under our control.<br>
You didn't think I agreed to aid Friedrich just to sink some Sirens, did you?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Warspite：</span><br>
Ah, of course! The question is, how will it help us find a cure for Hood?<br>
...Oh, I get it now! It's our door into the Sirens' home territory!<br>
And if we're able to find information that can explain her sickness, there'll be no need to obtain something as hazardous as a Black Cube!<br>
With some luck, we might even be able to learn more about the Ashes or the META.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Queen Elizabeth：</span><br>
Correct. We could skip that entire step if we had a META ally to ask questions to, like the Iron Blood, but alas...<br>
No matter. If it must be done, so it shall.<br>
Let me add that finding a cure for Hood is our top priority here. Recruiting new allies comes after that.<br>
Now, let's talk about the Mirror Sea – or rather, "Camelot." How is it looking?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Warspite：</span><br>
The singularity remains stable and is anchored to the Mirror Sea that we've designated as Camelot.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Queen Elizabeth：</span><br>
How long would it take to investigate Camelot and the areas linked to it?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Warspite：</span><br>
Erm... Somewhere between six months and a year.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Queen Elizabeth：</span><br>
Hood doesn't have that kind of time. Why will it take so long?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Warspite：</span><br>
It's due to the number of Sirens in the area. Even "abandoned" Siren facilities are home to countless stragglers.<br>
Sending in mass-produced ships isn't an option, I'm afraid. It would require a tremendous amount of energy to enlarge the gateway.<br>
Our best option currently is sending in an expedition team mainly consisting of Your Majesty's palace guard.<br>
It will be a dangerous task, and pursuing both objectives will already stretch our resources thin.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Queen Elizabeth：</span><br>
Hood would never tolerate others being put in danger for her sake...<br>
Can we not simply send in more expedition teams?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Warspite：</span><br>
I'm afraid not. The logistics of supplying and supporting even just one expedition team takes a huge number of people.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Queen Elizabeth：</span><br>
You're right... It's too dangerous to send in several teams if they're all underprepared, and we cannot afford to lose Camelot.<br>
But we cannot afford to lose Hood either!<br>
Time is of the essence... There must be another way...<br>

4 Call to Arms<br>
Scapa Flow - Harbor Facility<br>
Not far from the ceremony venue, there was a newly constructed building. A battleship by the name of Monarch was wandering alone through its corridors.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Monarch：</span><br>
Strolling through a place without a soul in sight is strangely relaxing.<br>
Seems they're going to cancel the ceremony due to a Siren air raid... What a shame.<br>
I alone could have disposed of their aircraft, yet they send me here, far away from any action.<br>
George, York, Wales, and I all swore an oath to fight for Royal Navy... So why am I not allowed to fight?<br>
<br>
She passed by a door and heard voices coming from inside.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">???：</span><br>
...It's no wonder you passed out and had to be carried in here...<br>
...There is no healing my wounds, is there? The Royal Navy lacks the cure Bismarck had...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Monarch：</span><br>
Is that... Hood?<br>
<br>
Though the voices on the other side were muffled, Monarch could still easily make sense of their conversation.<br>
It became clear that the reason Hood was absent during the ceremony was that she was very sick, and there was no cure for her illness.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Monarch：</span><br>
Good Lord... What happened to you, Hood?<br>
<br>
She had seen Hood many times on the Royal Islands. It came as a shock that the very symbol of the Royal Navy's glory was mortally ill.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Monarch：</span><br>
You meant to deliver a speech today, but couldn't... What's more, the Siren air raid is only a facade...<br>
This raises the question... Why is Her Highness keeping this a secret?<br>
<br>
The conversation went on.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">???：</span><br>
...Sending in mass-produced ships isn't an option, I'm afraid...<br>
...Our best option currently is sending in an expedition team mainly consisting of Your Majesty's palace guard...<br>
...Pursuing both objectives will already stretch our resources thin...<br>
...The logistics of supplying and supporting even just one expedition team takes a huge number of people...<br>
...We cannot afford to lose Camelot...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Monarch：</span><br>
Camelot... I assume that's what they call the Mirror Sea beyond the gateway.<br>
The place to where they must go and find a Black Cube, or information leading to one, or else Hood will never wake again...<br>
I can understand why Her Majesty is at a loss. Those Cubes have shown to be immensely dangerous. It's wise of her to want to minimise contact with them.<br>
Hmph... Then I shall be the answer to her prayers.<br>
I'll gladly put my very life on the line if it means proving to all the world that I, Monarch, am excellence itself.<br>
I shall undertake this mission, bring the Royal Navy glory, and aid Hood in her hour of need.<br>
<br>
Monarch left the scene with a resolve of steel in her heart.<br>
