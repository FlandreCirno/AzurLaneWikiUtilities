♪ The winter has passed, the spring has come, and life begins new ♪<br>
♪ From the gods get we our blessings, and this lovely world does too ♪<br>
<br>
A village sits on a grass plain. A bard's singing can be heard from down the road.<br>
<span style="color:#fef15e;">Bard：</span><br>
♪ 'Tis time to shake the cobwebs, to go where one never has ♪<br>
♪ Oh, here's a slice of Paradise; a splendid town to pass♪<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Laffey：</span><br>
You hear that? Someone's singing...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Z23：</span><br>
A traveling bard... We've never had one of those come to the village before.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Javelin：</span><br>
Heehee! What a nice voice she has!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">{namecode:6}：</span><br>
Yes, I think she's literally singing the praises of our village.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Javelin：</span><br>
Ms. Bard! Thank you for the verses!<br>
You should come sing in our tavern, too! Should I show you the way?<br>
<span style="color:#fef15e;">Bard：</span><br>
Ah, Javelin... I mean, my fair lady, you are too kind.<br>
However, I am simply passing through this place. I must politely reject your offer.<br>
For you see...<br>
♪ The darkness is upon us ♪<br>
♪ O villagers kind and friendly, I imploreth ye to flee ♪<br>
♪ My flute's sound shall lead ye, to a great sanctuary ♪<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">{namecode:6}：</span><br>
Uh... "The darkness"?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Javelin：</span><br>
It'll be several hours before the sun sets.<br>
<span style="color:#fef15e;">Bard：</span><br>
Ah... Of course, your village is isolated from the rest of the world.<br>
I assume you've not heard the news about the Demon King.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Laffey：</span><br>
The Demon King? I have a book about her at home.<br>
<span style="color:#fef15e;">Bard：</span><br>
I speaketh not of the Demon King of fables and fairy tales.<br>
Hmm... I suppose this is a reason to stay the night.<br>
Your village seemeth to need the services of a bard.<br>
Where be your tavern?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Javelin：</span><br>
Right over here! Follow me!<br>

<br>
The next day, by the village's water well...<br>
<span style="color:#fef15e;">Bard：</span><br>
♪ O ladies, come hither; I ask only for thy ears ♪<br>
♪ Across forests and mountains, lies a castle far from here ♪<br>
♪ Turn your gazes northward, it shall be worth the hassle ♪<br>
♪ Among the mountains yonder, there sits a mighty castle ♪<br>
♪ Though so pretty and so fancy, its decor is blood and flames ♪<br>
♪ Houses a despot with bloodlust; 'tis the Demon King's domain ♪<br>
♪ Hers is a heart like stone, and cold just as the ice ♪<br>
♪ And where that one travels follows a wake of demise ♪<br>
♪ And as the army of darkness has now begun to move ♪<br>
♪ It's best for you to flee now, for staying shall be your doom ♪<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Laffey：</span><br>
The Demon King Army is on the move...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Javelin：</span><br>
That reminds me... Some merchants passing by have said they were attacked by monsters.<br>
But don't worry! We already took care of all the monsters near the village!<br>
<span style="color:#fef15e;">Bard：</span><br>
So you aren't only villagers, you're also guardians of the lanes of trade. I applaud you.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Javelin：</span><br>
Heehee... "Guardians" might be a strong word.<br>
<span style="color:#fef15e;">Bard：</span><br>
Regardless, a few stray monsters can ill compare to the might of the Demon King Army.<br>
Even the army of humanity is buckling under its offensive.<br>
In fact, they have already decided to abandon the area surrounding the Endless Woods.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">{namecode:6}：</span><br>
And where is the Endless Forest, exactly?<br>
<span style="color:#fef15e;">Bard：</span><br>
...Over yonder. 'Tis the great forest that stretches on far past the village.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Z23：</span><br>
Oh, I thought it was called the Forest of Origin. I never knew it was known as the Endless Woods as well.<br>
<span style="color:#fef15e;">Bard：</span><br>
"Forest of Origin"? That's the local name for it?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Z23：</span><br>
Yup. Always has been.<br>
<span style="color:#fef15e;">Bard：</span><br>
It has a nice ring to it. I shall call it that as well.<br>
<br>
The bard thinks to herself for a moment, then resumes her singing.<br>
<span style="color:#fef15e;">Bard：</span><br>
♪ O people of this village, by the Forest of Origin ♪<br>
♪ Though the times may be dire, to despair do not give in ♪<br>
♪ To the south there is hope, a star amidst the darkness ♪<br>
♪ A wall to reach the heavens, its guardians art bless'd ♪<br>
♪ Constructed by decree it is, its finish drawing near ♪<br>
♪ Twelve goddesses' blessings, 'pon a lake fine and clear ♪<br>
♪ A vampire founded Ballad, its cornerstone she laid ♪<br>
♪ The guardian dragon soars, its scales glow like jade ♪<br>
♪ Blessed be our kingdom, and to you I say... ♪<br>
♪ O people of this village, by the Forest of Origin ♪<br>
♪ Come with me southward, and your tale we shall spin ♪<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Z23：</span><br>
You're... asking us to come with you, is that it?<br>
<span style="color:#fef15e;">Bard：</span><br>
Aye. 'Tis a shame your gorgeous village will fall, but you mustn't fall with it.<br>
As a humble bard on the lowest rung of society, inviting you to the land of hope is the most I can do.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">{namecode:6}：</span><br>
You mentioned guardians. That's what they call the kingdom's protectors.<br>
Our records mention them secretly colluding with the Demon King. Is that true?<br>
<span style="color:#fef15e;">Bard：</span><br>
Your village has records of such treachery?<br>
Hmm. This will take some time to go through.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Laffey：</span><br>
I guess you can stay another night.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Javelin：</span><br>
Yeah! We'll keep you and the rest of the village safe from monsters!<br>
<span style="color:#fef15e;">Bard：</span><br>
Very well. Then another night I shall stay.<br>

<br>
The next day, under a tree by the river...<br>
<span style="color:#fef15e;">Bard：</span><br>
♪ Come closer here my ladies, and listen to my song ♪<br>
♪ I've an ancient tale to tell, a past that's so far gone ♪<br>
♪ Of when this land was forged, and gods were only four ♪<br>
♪ Four spires were there then, protecting people ever more ♪<br>
♪ And the gods they were of wisdom, joy, and even war ♪<br>
♪ Then there was the fourth god, its name is known no more ♪<br>
♪ The lands were all in harmony, but meant to last 'twas not ♪<br>
♪ In then came the new gods, when the old began to rot ♪<br>
♪ Oh, betrayed felt the wisdom god, the heretics it cursed ♪<br>
♪ The god of joy was furious, its bubble had been burst ♪<br>
♪ The last two gods were out of words, for blood was all they cared ♪<br>
♪ Together they all swore revenge, with demons did they pair ♪<br>
♪ To those who had forsaken them swore to bring despair ♪<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Z23：</span><br>
So when the new gods flourished, faith was lost in the old ones. Out of spite, they joined forces with the Demon King. Am I correct?<br>
<span style="color:#fef15e;">Bard：</span><br>
That you are.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Laffey：</span><br>
I have a question...<br>
What was the name of the last old god?<br>
<span style="color:#fef15e;">Bard：</span><br>
Nobody knows. I am but a vessel for the muse, not an expert on the war between gods.<br>
I've told you all that I know. Now, shall we set off?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">{namecode:6}：</span><br>
First, I wanna know about those four spires.<br>
<span style="color:#fef15e;">Bard：</span><br>
Ah, the four spires. It's a long story to tell, though...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Z23：</span><br>
So just stay another night then.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Javelin：</span><br>
Just one more night! Please! We'll pack our stuff in the meantime!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">{namecode:6}：</span><br>
Yes. We'll set off tomorrow, I promise.<br>
<span style="color:#fef15e;">Bard：</span><br>
So be it. One more night, then we shall be off.<br>

<br>
The next day, by the village's entry gate...<br>
<span style="color:#fef15e;">Bard：</span><br>
♪ Listen now, miladies, before you start your quest ♪<br>
♪ Spires there were four, to north, east, south, and west ♪<br>
♪ Gone are they all now, like tears amidst the rain ♪<br>
♪ First we have the southly one, its guardian chased out ♪<br>
♪ Second is the western one, 'tis swimming with the trouts ♪<br>
♪ Third there is the eastern one, of Ballad became its stones ♪<br>
♪ Lastly there's the northern one, its fate remains unknown ♪<br>
♪ Appeared they did and went they did, all signs of them are gone ♪<br>
♪ The witch inside the tower, a note to finish on ♪<br>
♪ If one thing can be said of her, she is all mankind's friend ♪<br>
♪ And so... it... goes ♪<br>
There you have it. 'Twas the full tale of the spires.<br>
Now, if I may ask... What are you all wearing?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ayanami：</span><br>
I'm geared up to kill the Demon King.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Laffey：</span><br>
We're gonna take down the big bad...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Javelin：</span><br>
If there's no more Demon King, we won't need to flee our village!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Z23：</span><br>
Exactly! And we can help people along the way as our skills improve.<br>
<span style="color:#fef15e;">Bard：</span><br>
Well... I suppose you have a point.<br>
But I must warn you – facing the Demon King means risking your life.<br>
Besides, even if you are successful, another Demon King will be born one day.<br>
History has proven that this, if nothing else, will always be true.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ayanami：</span><br>
Not if we take her down for good.<br>
My fists will put an end to this ceaseless cycle.<br>
<span style="color:#fef15e;">Bard：</span><br>
An admirable spirit. I sincerely wish you luck.<br>
Then, one last thing...<br>
<br>
The bard pauses to think for a moment, then resumes her song.<br>
<span style="color:#fef15e;">Bard：</span><br>
♪ The Demon King's great treasure, of it you must beware ♪<br>
♪ There's thorns beneath its petals, their sting without compare ♪<br>
♪ Do not take it lightly, or it shall be your end ♪<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Javelin：</span><br>
Thanks, bard! We'll keep that in mind!<br>
<span style="color:#fef15e;">Bard：</span><br>
One last thing. Take this flute with you.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Z23：</span><br>
Are you sure? But being a bard, don't you need it more than we do?<br>
<span style="color:#fef15e;">Bard：</span><br>
Don't worry about me. I have another one.<br>
I know it will come in handy on your adventure.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Javelin：</span><br>
Well, if you insist! Thank you so much!<br>
Oh, right, you never told us – what's your name?<br>
<span style="color:#fef15e;">Bard：</span><br>
My... name?<br>
I do not know.<br>
I suppose you may remember me as the bard searching for her own name.<br>
Now, I must bid you farewell...<br>
Heroes to-be.<br>
