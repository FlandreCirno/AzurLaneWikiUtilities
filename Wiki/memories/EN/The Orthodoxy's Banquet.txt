Today is a special day. A day to be remembered.<br>
And what better way to remember it than with a grand banquet?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Richelieu：</span><br>
Everyone, could I get an update on how the preparations are going?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Le Triomphant：</span><br>
I've finished assigning guards along the guest routes and I'm currently double-checking to see if everything looks good.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Le Malin：</span><br>
Likewise, I've finished my tasks. I'm waiting for my next one.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Émile Bertin：</span><br>
My dance rehearsal for the partygoers is finished.~<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Vauquelin：</span><br>
I've set up all the equipment for the orchestra. The players will be here soon.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Joffre：</span><br>
The food and drinks are coming along well, aside from... her.<br>
La Galissonnière, what are you doing? These drinks are for the guests.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">La Galissonnière：</span><br>
Hey, think of it as taste-testing. Or checking for poison. Either way, it's not like anyone will know.~<br>
<br>
La Galissonnière tries and fails to come up with an excuse, to the chagrin of some and the amusement of others.<br>
The celebration they're preparing now began as a project much smaller in scale.<br>
That was, until everyone – but especially the Iris Orthodoxy – put forth various ideas on how to make it better, bigger.<br>
Now, these girls are all working tirelessly to help make this banquet one of the biggest, most memorable of the year.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Richelieu：</span><br>
Alright, everyone. Please return to your stations and work on all the finishing touches.<br>
Remember that we are hosting this banquet. We cannot let any imperfections sully the Holy Iris' name.<br>
<br>
With all their accounts settled, the girls settled down in the waiting room.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Richelieu：</span><br>
Hmm... Although it was a little hectic, this generally went quite well.<br>
<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项1："We couldn't have done it without you."</span>'''''<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Richelieu：</span><br>
Please. If anything, I should be the one saying that.<br>
It was you who assigned tasks to each faction and coordinated our efforts on the scene.<br>
I can't think of anyone else who could've filled your shoes.<br>
I am convinced this banquet will be a great success, largely thanks to you.<br>
<br>
While I doubt my part is as important as Richelieu makes it sound, I'm nevertheless glad to have helped everyone.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Richelieu：</span><br>
Jeanne, are we ready?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Jeanne d'Arc：</span><br>
Yes, we are! Everything is in order for the banquet to begin.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Richelieu：</span><br>
Excellent. Commander, we are ready to open our doors to the guests.<br>
Once again, thank you for everything. I hope you'll enjoy the festivities.<br>
<br>
"Thanks. I'm looking forward to hearing your opening speech."<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Richelieu：</span><br>
My opening speech? I'm afraid it might not be what you're expecting.<br>
The planning of this banquet required my full attention, so I gave the task of delivering a speech to someone else.<br>
You'll find out who soon enough.<br>
Clemenceau, I leave the Commander and the venue to you. I know you don't like being in the spotlight, but I have no one else to turn to.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Clemenceau：</span><br>
Of course. Our good reputation is on the line here – it would be discourteous of me to hide behind the scenes.<br>
Follow me, Commander. It's time to go back to the main hall and enjoy yourself as a guest.~<br>

<br>
The Orthodoxy's Banquet<br>
<br>
Enterprise's Speech<br>
As much as I want to check out the venue, I feel that I should have a look around the palace.<br>
Two people are having a chat just down the hall...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Enterprise：</span><br>
That's everything I need to know? Noted.<br>
I'm surprised that you came to tell me that. I was expecting Richelieu.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Clemenceau：</span><br>
What can I say? Even I – a known behind-the-scenes schemer – need to take center stage now and again.<br>
Now, I trust you're willing to deliver the Eagle Union's speech, yes?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Enterprise：</span><br>
Yeah. I'm up for it.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Clemenceau：</span><br>
Great. Then if you'll excuse me... Oh, if it isn't the Commander.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Enterprise：</span><br>
Didn't see you there, Commander.<br>
<br>
"Good evening, you two. I hope I didn't interrupt your conversation."<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Clemenceau：</span><br>
Not at all. Your timing couldn't have been better, in fact. We just finished our little talk.<br>
Seeing as there's still some time before the banquet officially starts, I'll go on ahead and find some drinks. You two have a good one, now.~<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Enterprise：</span><br>
You haven't seen Essex or Massachusetts around, have you? They said they were on the way.<br>
<br>
As far as I can tell by Enterprise's expression, she doesn't seem particularly worried about them.<br>
"Can't say I have, no. Do you reckon they've gotten lost?"<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Enterprise：</span><br>
Maybe. I helped Essex with her dress, then sometime later she just disappeared on me.<br>
Same with Massachusetts. She put on her dress, I turned around for a minute, and she was gone.<br>
They're obviously SOMEWHERE in the palace, so I don't think they're in danger or anything. It's just...<br>
Ah, forget it. I'm sure they're just doing something to pass the time.<br>
Anyway... Could I have a minute of your time, Commander?<br>
It's nothing important. I just wanted to ask you something.<br>
<br>
"Sure, not a problem. What's on your mind?"<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Enterprise：</span><br>
It feels weird to just come forth and ask it outright, but... what do you think about my dress?<br>
<br>
I expected something else, given how she beat around the bush for a bit. I'm relieved this is all it was.<br>
<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项1："It looks great on you."</span>'''''<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项3："You completely own the look."</span>'''''<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项2："It's breathtakingly beautiful."</span>'''''<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Enterprise：</span><br>
You really think so?<br>
It took a while to put on, and I rarely ever wear dresses, so I wasn't entirely sure.<br>
Hearing you say it does look good is a big relief.<br>
<br>
"Glad to give you some peace of mind. On another subject, what were you and Clemenceau talking about earlier?"<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Enterprise：</span><br>
Oh, that. We were discussing a speech for the banquet. It's a big day, after all, so it feels appropriate.<br>
She asked me to deliver it on behalf of the Eagle Union.<br>
<br>
"I see. Do you need any help with that?"<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Enterprise：</span><br>
Well, the script itself is already finished, so I'm good on that front.<br>
But I'd appreciate it if you could read it through, and maybe offer some feedback too.<br>
<br>
"I could do that, no problem. First, though, we should find a place with fewer inquisitive people."<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Enterprise：</span><br>
You're right. Someplace quiet would be ideal. Let's go.<br>
<br>
And so, Enterprise and I take off, leaving the hall behind.<br>

The Orthodoxy's Banquet<br>
<br>
Drinks, Dresses, and Despair<br>
As much as I want to check out the venue, I feel that I should have a look around the palace.<br>
I sense an intense gaze from somewhere nearby.<br>
After a quick look around, I figure out who's watching. She doesn't realize yet that I'm here.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Essex：</span><br>
Man... Enterprise sure looks stunning in her dress...<br>
*glug glug*... Pfah!~<br>
<br>
It's Essex, gazing at Enterprise from afar. She's admiring her outfit and drinking wine straight from the bottle.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Essex：</span><br>
I	's leagues ahead of mine... How am I supposed to impress anyone like thiiis!<br>
<br>
"What are you up to, Essex?"<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Essex：</span><br>
Commander! Wh-wh-what brings you here?<br>
Please don't say you heard me grumbling just now...<br>
<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项1："I couldn't help it."</span>'''''<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项2："Grumbling? I didn't hear anything."</span>'''''<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Essex：</span><br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项1）</span>'''''Oh god... Please forget it. Push it out of your memory...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Essex：</span><br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项2）</span>'''''You didn't? Phew... Wait, what DID I even say? Uhh...<br>
<br>
She's had some drinks – a few too many, possibly. Maybe a little company will get her to take her hand off the bottle?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Essex：</span><br>
*stares drunkly*...<br>
<br>
She opens her eyes wide and stares at my clothes like I'm a fashion model.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Essex：</span><br>
You know, I just realized... You're looking quite stylish, too.<br>
Really rocking that fit... Hey, want some wine?<br>
<br>
"No thanks, and I think you've had too much. I'd offer to sit down with you, but I think what you need now is to rest in the lounge."<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Essex：</span><br>
Heheh, good point... No, wait, I still need to put my dress on! I can't go there yet...<br>
Buhh... That reminds me, I have a fun fact.<br>
Did you know I helped Enterprise put on her dress?<br>
She's bad with dresses, you see, so somebody had to give her a hand...<br>
So I did. It took quite some time, which she felt a little shy about.~<br>
And that, right then, is when I realized! *glug glug*...<br>
Did you realize it too, when you saw her, Commander?!<br>
<br>
She forcefully puts her bottle down on the table with an audible thud, then looks at me intently again.<br>
"Realize what? What are you talking about?"<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Essex：</span><br>
Please. Now you're just playing dumb...<br>
I realized that she had me beaten. There was no topping the beauty of her dress...<br>
So I decided – screw it, why even bother with my own dress...<br>
<br>
Now I see the reason why she sounded depressed.<br>
However, she'll probably want to kick herself once she sobers up.<br>
It's best not to let her get any more drunk than she already is.<br>
<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项1：(Take the wine bottle away from her.)</span>'''''<br>
<br>
"It's not like you to give up without a fight."<br>
"And furthermore – I still want to see how you'd look in your own dress."<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Essex：</span><br>
You... You're right! I shouldn't give up before I've even tried.<br>
This is the battle of the dresses... I won't admit premature defeat, even if I'm up against Enterprise!<br>
Especially not when you're eager to see me all dressed up...<br>
<br>
She seems to sober up ever so slightly from her defeatist daze.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Essex：</span><br>
Alright... I'll go back to my room immediately and get changed. You should come with me!<br>
<br>
"Come again?"<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Essex：</span><br>
You said you want to see me in a dress, didn't you?<br>
The last thing I want is to dash your expectations, so I need to pick out the best dress possible.<br>
The first step to doing that is to go back to my dorm room, together!<br>
<br>
It doesn't seem like there's any chance she'll budge on this.<br>
Left with no other option, I'm forced to leave the venue with her...<br>

<br>
The Orthodoxy's Banquet<br>
<br>
Bumpy Road<br>
As much as I want to check out the venue, I feel that I should have a look around the palace.<br>
Curious about what the Sakura Empire is doing, I decide to go have a look – until a sound interrupts my thoughts.<br>
A loud clanging, like something metallic fell over on the road.<br>
In other words – the sound of an accident.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Sakawa：</span><br>
Bad news, Lady Musashi! Our manjuu carriage toppled on its side!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Wakatsuki：</span><br>
What do we do? Our luggage is all over the road!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Musashi：</span><br>
Don't panic. First, check if anybody is hurt, then load the baggage back into the carriage.<br>
<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项1："Need any help with that?"</span>'''''<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Musashi：</span><br>
Oh, it's you, Commander.<br>
Just as trouble strikes, you appear before us. Perhaps this is fate?<br>
Yes, your help would be much appreciated. Let's fix this little accident.<br>
<br>
With everyone working together, we manage to load the luggage back onto the carriage.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Sakawa：</span><br>
Whew... Thanks for the assistance, Commander!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Musashi：</span><br>
Indeed. You have my gratitude.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Wakatsuki：</span><br>
Oh! Oh no!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Sakawa：</span><br>
"Oh no" what? What's wrong?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Wakatsuki：</span><br>
Look what happened to Lady Musashi's banquet dress!<br>
It seems it got dirty whilst we were loading the luggage back up...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Sakawa：</span><br>
Oh dear, that's awful. You can't wear a dirty dress to a banquet.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Wakatsuki：</span><br>
What do we do... Lady Musashi is meant to appear at the banquet really sooon!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Musashi：</span><br>
It's not the end of the world. Fortunately, it didn't tear.<br>
A little dirt is nothing we can't fix with some soap and water before I make my entrance.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Wakatsuki：</span><br>
Right! Of course. Let me see how long it would take to clean and dry the fabric... Hmm...<br>
Not too long, luckily! Allow me to do it!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Musashi：</span><br>
Very well. If you insist.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Sakawa：</span><br>
Meanwhile, I'll call the banquet staff and inform them you'll arrive a bit later than planned.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Musashi：</span><br>
You mean calling Richelieu? It's best if I do that myself.<br>
Accident or not, it affects the schedule. The least I can do is personally apologize to her for the delay.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Sakawa：</span><br>
As you say, Lady Musashi!<br>
<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项1："As you say, Lady Musashi!"</span>'''''<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项2："I suppose everything worked out in the end."</span>'''''<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Musashi：</span><br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项1）</span>'''''You really needn't parrot people without reason...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Musashi：</span><br>
It's truly fortunate you were here, Commander. Without your help, we'd still be lifting luggage.<br>
Now, it'll take a while for Wakatsuki to clean my garb, and I don't wish to stand around idly.<br>
Say, would you lend me a bit of your time?<br>
I wish to repay my debt of gratitude to you for coming to our aid.<br>

<br>
The Orthodoxy's Banquet<br>
<br>
Spotlight-Shy<br>
As much as I want to check out the venue, I feel that I should have a look around the palace.<br>
Over there, in a quiet corner of the palace, I spot Jean Bart. She seems lost in thought.<br>
Our eyes lock for a moment. I wait for her to say the first word.<br>
...But she doesn't, and she turns her gaze elsewhere. Maybe she's feeling absentminded?<br>
Whatever the case, I should go over and say hello.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Jean Bart：</span><br>
Of course you saw me. Tsk...<br>
<br>
An angered look flashes on her face for an instant before she turns away from me.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Jean Bart：</span><br>
...Okay, sorry. I'm not avoidin' you on purpose.<br>
It's just that wherever you go, a crowd follows. I don't like the attention.<br>
That's why I'm here, trying to stay low so ya wouldn't find me.<br>
Or was. No point in that anymore. So, what is it?<br>
<br>
She explains herself matter-of-factly, still looking away from me.<br>
<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项1："I thought you could use some company."</span>'''''<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项2："You're acting strangely."</span>'''''<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Jean Bart：</span><br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项1）</span>'''''How considerate of you.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Jean Bart：</span><br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项2）</span>'''''Strangely? The hell ya talking about?<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项2）</span>'''''This is our banquet. There's nothin' odd about me being here. At least nothin' I can think of...<br>
<br>
"You didn't put on a beautiful dress just to stand in a corner, did you? You should be enjoying yourself. Go talk to people, enjoy a drink or two."<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Jean Bart：</span><br>
Second time hearing that tonight.<br>
Richelieu said the same thing. Maybe she wasn't just bein' polite.<br>
<br>
I grab a drink and pull up a chair beside her. Something tells me she wants somebody to talk to.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Jean Bart：</span><br>
...Don't get me wrong – I am enjoyin' myself. The whole Orthodoxy pulled all the stops to organize this thing, and the mood's great.<br>
It's not the banquet itself I'm miffed about, but it's related.<br>
See, Richelieu told me to deliver the Orthodoxy's speech later ton–<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Massachusetts：</span><br>
Evening, Commander.<br>
You haven't seen Essex around, have you?<br>
We came here together, but we got separated after a while.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Jean Bart：</span><br>
M-Massachusetts! Aw, shit...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Massachusetts：</span><br>
Long time no see, Jean.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Jean Bart：</span><br>
......<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Massachusetts：</span><br>
Beautiful dress you have.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Jean Bart：</span><br>
......<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Massachusetts：</span><br>
Speaking of dresses... Thoughts?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Jean Bart：</span><br>
About what?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Massachusetts：</span><br>
Um, my dress?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Jean Bart：</span><br>
......<br>
<br>
All of a sudden, Jean Bart hooks her arm around mine and escorts me out of the hall.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Massachusetts：</span><br>
Huh. She didn't even rate my dress...<br>

The Orthodoxy's Banquet<br>
<br>
A Peculiar Apéritif<br>
As much as I want to check out the venue, I feel that I should have a look around the palace.<br>
Suddenly, cheers and lively chatter erupt at a table not far away.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Gangut：</span><br>
Whew! It totally lacks the kick of vodka, but the Orthodoxy's wine isn't half-bad. It's got good flavor to it!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Kirov：</span><br>
Couldn't have put it better myself. Cheers!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Avrora：</span><br>
While they did say we may drink as much as we'd like, please try not to have too much.<br>
<br>
In a corner of the banquet hall, the Northern Parliament is having a small wine-tasting party.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Avrora：</span><br>
Ah, Commander! Nice of you to stop by. Would you like to join us for a toast?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Kirov：</span><br>
Didn't expect you to come around so soon, Comrade Commander.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Gangut：</span><br>
It's funny. On the way here, Avrora kept repeating how she was so sure you'd show up at our table.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Avrora：</span><br>
Hmm? I don't remember saying it THAT many times.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Gangut：</span><br>
Either way – how about you take a seat and sip some wine with us?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Kirov：</span><br>
It won't get us drunk because we're used to much stronger stuff, but it might just hit that sweet spot for you, Commander.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Avrora：</span><br>
We won't force anything on you, of course. If you'd rather not drink at all, that's perfectly fine.<br>
Oh, I just remembered – we still haven't changed into our dresses yet!<br>
We got sidetracked as soon as we arrived. Gangut said she was "compelled" by the aroma in the air.<br>
Then, the next thing I know, here we all are...<br>
Clemenceau was very understanding, fortunately. She even sent extra wine our way.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Gangut：</span><br>
Yeah, yeah. Let's rewind! We were talking about the Commander drinking with us – I know you want that, Avrora.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Avrora：</span><br>
Yes, but if the Commander wishes to abstain, we must respect that choice.<br>
So – would you like some wine, Commander?<br>
<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项1："Well, it would be rude of me to refuse..."</span>'''''<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项2："Cheers!"</span>'''''<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Kirov：</span><br>
That's the spirit!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Gangut：</span><br>
Ahahahah! I knew you wouldn't say no!<br>
Bottom's up, folks!~<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Kirov：</span><br>
You said it, comrade!~<br>
See, Avrora? Comrade Commander is having a great time! You had nothing to worry about.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Gangut：</span><br>
Ahahahaha! Now THAT'S how you drink! Keep it up, comrade!<br>
<br>
All the world's sounds and pictures are getting hazy, fading...<br>
How much have I drunk? I can't even remember...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Avrora：</span><br>
That's enough now. The Commander is barely keeping it together.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Gangut：</span><br>
Aww. Guess the fun's over. Avrora's got that look like she's not gonna budge.~<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Kirov：</span><br>
I'm surprised the Commander even drank with us for this long. Alas, all good things must come to an end.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Avrora：</span><br>
Commander? Are you okay? Can you hear me?<br>
<br>
"Wuh... Water..."<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Avrora：</span><br>
Water? No problem. It's a good thing I brought my canteen. Here you go.<br>
<br>
Avrora produces a blurry canteen-thingy and hands it to me.<br>
<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项1：(Chug its contents.)</span>'''''<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Gangut：</span><br>
Uhh... The Commander just keeled over...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Avrora：</span><br>
Commander! What's wrong?! Please wake up!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Kirov：</span><br>
Avrora... This isn't water in the canteen! It's goddamn spirytus vodka!<br>

The Wall at the Banquet's Center<br>
"...Hm? A Juustagram notification?"<br>
"...Hm? A Juustagram notification?"<br>
"And it's from Prinz Eugen, too. Let's see what it is."<br>
She sent me a picture. In it, she and her Iron Blood comrades are smiling, laughing, enjoying the banquet.<br>
But, something is off about it.<br>
Namely, a certain someone isn't in the picture.<br>
At the center of the banquet venue is Bismarck, sitting all alone at a table, enjoying a drink.<br>
As more and more guests have shown up, the banquet's atmosphere has gotten warmer and livelier.<br>
And yet, that doesn't seem to extend to her. It's as though there's an invisible, people-repelling barrier around her.<br>
The only ones who'll talk to her are fellow Iron Blood girls. Everyone else is keeping their distance from her.<br>
I should go talk to her and ask what's up.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Bismarck：</span><br>
Oh. Good evening, Commander.<br>
<br>
"Hey, Bismarck. Do you have a moment?"<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Bismarck：</span><br>
Your expression tells me that you have something on your mind.<br>
To answer you – yes, I do. I'm all ears.<br>
<br>
Aha. I've figured out why that invisible barrier surrounds her.<br>
<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项1："I think you're being excessively formal."</span>'''''<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项2："You should let loose – you'd be more approachable then."</span>'''''<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Bismarck：</span><br>
Ah. "It's meant to be a relaxed banquet," right?<br>
Yes, I suppose it is, to the majority of people.<br>
To you as well, I... No, it's simply a fact – I'm objectively failing to blend in.<br>
Unlike Eugen. Wherever she goes, the party spirit follows.<br>
<br>
"Did you ask Eugen to be the star of the night, because you feel you dampen the mood?"<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Bismarck：</span><br>
Have you seen her, by any chance? Is she spreading the fun?<br>
<br>
"Yeah. She sent me a photo. I just wish you were in it, with the rest of them."<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Bismarck：</span><br>
You know me, Commander. I'm not a party person. It doesn't come naturally to me.<br>
As you speculated, I just rain on everyone's parade when I'm around.<br>
That's why I asked Eugen to take the initiative.<br>
Judging by how she's doing, it seems I made the right decision.<br>
<br>
"Alright. Them aside, then, how are you enjoying the banquet?"<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Bismarck：</span><br>
Who's to say I am, or have to? There are different kinds of banquets.<br>
Some are for fun and drinking, others are more formal in nature and demand a serious approach.<br>
As Iron Blood's leader, this banquet falls into the latter category for me.<br>
<br>
"I don't think Eugen sent me that photo just to show she and the rest are having a good time. They're concerned about you."<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Bismarck：</span><br>
......<br>
First Eugen expresses concern about me, and now you.<br>
<br>
She cracks a wry smile.<br>
"Why don't you go join them? Then they wouldn't be concerned about you."<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Bismarck：</span><br>
A good point...<br>
Say... The orchestra is gearing up for the ball.<br>
If you don't mind, would you like to go with me?<br>
<br>
She offers me her hand. I take it.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Bismarck：</span><br>
Thank you for accepting my invitation. Let's do as you suggested and go enjoy this banquet.~<br>

<br>
The Orthodoxy's Banquet<br>
<br>
A Minute with Her Majesty<br>
As much as I want to check out the venue, I feel that I should have a look around the palace.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Sirius：</span><br>
Your Majesty! Look out!<br>
<br>
A decorative vase placed dangerously to the edge of a desk threatens to fall over as Queen Elizabeth approaches. Sirius jumps in front of her and shields her with her own body.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Belfast：</span><br>
Please be calm, Sirius. The inside of the palace is safe.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Queen Elizabeth：</span><br>
Mrmf! Mmgh!!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Sirius：</span><br>
Oh, how clumsy of me! Please forgive me, Your Majesty!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Queen Elizabeth：</span><br>
*gasp*! What were you thinking? You nearly choked me with those huge knockers of yours!<br>
Grrrr... Hmph!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Sirius：</span><br>
My sincerest apologies. I shouldn't have held you so forcefully. Please give this naughty maid her due punishment!<br>
<br>
"What's going on here?"<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Queen Elizabeth：</span><br>
Why, if it isn't my servant.<br>
Nothing is "going on" – except for Sirius being a klutz.<br>
No matter. Your timing is perfect, servant. Come with me on a little stroll.<br>
<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项1："Gladly!"</span>'''''<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项2："Well, I've got an important thing to do..."</span>'''''<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Queen Elizabeth：</span><br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项1）</span>'''''Good. Right this way.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Queen Elizabeth：</span><br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项2）</span>'''''Nonsense! What could possibly be more important than accompanying me, the queen?<br>
<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项2）</span>'''''Darn. Doesn't sound like I can't wriggle out of this one...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Belfast：</span><br>
In the meantime, I shall prepare a beverage for after you finish your stroll.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Queen Elizabeth：</span><br>
Thanks, Bel.<br>
Sirius, you go with her. She'll need your help.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Sirius：</span><br>
But Your Majesty, you need an escort...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Queen Elizabeth：</span><br>
I'll be fine. The venue is safe, plus I have Sheffy watching over me from the shadows.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Sirius：</span><br>
Well, if you're certain...<br>
Shall I also prepare a light meal for you and my honourable Master while you're away?<br>
There's quite some time before dinner, and I'd hate for you to be hungry until–<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Queen Elizabeth：</span><br>
No need! There are hors d'oeuvres in the banquet hall. Moreover, the Iris Orthodoxy should be allowed to display its cooking knowledge today. The Royal Maids needn't do anything.<br>
<br>
Elizabeth and I wander around the palace, admiring the sights and architecture.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Queen Elizabeth：</span><br>
Hmm... The Orthodoxy has done a respectable job with this banquet.<br>
Although it's still only about 80% as good as the banquets we host.<br>
<br>
"That's a specific estimate. You must have a keen, critical eye for these things."<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Queen Elizabeth：</span><br>
I do. Let's imagine that we were hosting this banquet...<br>
First of all, we wouldn't hang a painting on that wall. All the elements of the interior need to be in harmony, and...<br>
<br>
With an excited tone, she points out a myriad of things they'd do differently. She seems to quite enjoy the act of critiquing.<br>
Then, all of a sudden, she falls silent and deep in thought. I wonder why?<br>
<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项1：(Observe her closely.)</span>'''''<br>
<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项1）</span>'''''"You seem a bit restless. Did you dismiss Sirius and Belfast because you wanted to tell me something in private?"<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Queen Elizabeth：</span><br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项1）</span>'''''What? No. I have nothing to tell you that I wouldn't if they were here.<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项1）</span>'''''Where did that come from? Are you pining for Sirius' cooking?<br>
<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项1）</span>'''''"She has improved – she can make chocolate and simple meals now – but no, that's not why I asked."<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Queen Elizabeth：</span><br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项1）</span>'''''Ugh... Alright, if you really must know...<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项1）</span>'''''Look around you. People have been coming and going since I arrived.<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项1）</span>'''''And I've scarcely seen anyone with their subordinates in tow.<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项1）</span>'''''Richelieu doesn't have any assistants accompanying her, and neither do you.<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项1）</span>'''''That's what's normal at this banquet, and I simply wanted to experience this normalcy for myself.<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项1）</span>'''''Even if only for a little bit.<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项1）</span>'''''Just an ordinary shipgirl, not a queen, taking a stroll through this giant palace.<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项1）</span>'''''And with you for company.<br>
<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项1）</span>'''''"Is it 'normal' for me to follow you around?"<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Queen Elizabeth：</span><br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项1）</span>'''''If I SAY it's normal, then it is!<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项1）</span>'''''Or what, do you think I don't mean it?<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项1）</span>'''''I'm confiding in you here, servant. I demand you take me seriously!<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项1）</span>'''''Otherwise, I can always get mad like a normal person and discipline you.<br>
<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项1："Please forgive me, Your Majesty!"</span>'''''<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项2："By doing... what?"</span>'''''<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项1）</span>'''''If you truly want my forgiveness, earn it.<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项1）</span>'''''Lucky for you, there's still some time before Bel comes back with that drink.<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项1）</span>'''''Until she does, think of something to appease me!~<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Queen Elizabeth：</span><br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项2）</span>'''''What? Umm... By... By bemeaning you, or inflicting some light punishment...<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项2）</span>'''''I've got it! Something like what Ajax or Scylla would do.<br>
<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项2）</span>'''''Elizabeth's disturbing idea makes me stifle a laugh.<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项2）</span>'''''"To that, I say – it's not normal for a shipgirl to punish her Commander, is it?"<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Queen Elizabeth：</span><br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项2）</span>'''''It's not? But I thought...<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项2）</span>'''''No matter! If you don't want to suffer, straighten out and look sharp!<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项2）</span>'''''Lucky for you, there's still some time before Bel comes back with that drink.<br>

<br>
And so, the festivity in the banquet venue reached its peak.<br>
Palace - Banquet Hall<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">{namecode:84}：</span><br>
Well, well, there's the Commander.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Queen Elizabeth：</span><br>
You sure took your sweet time, servant!<br>
Do you know what a banquet without you is? Dull, that's what!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Avrora：</span><br>
I have to agree. We all missed you, Commander.~<br>
Now, shall I get you something to drink?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">{namecode:435}：</span><br>
Spirits are high tonight, Commander.<br>
I hope you enjoy the atmosphere as much as I do.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Jean Bart：</span><br>
If ya see anything less than perfect, please try to ignore it...<br>
Yeah, I know it's not my style to say "please," but still.<br>
What I'm trying to say is – I hope you have a hell of a time tonight.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Essex：</span><br>
Commander! Can you feel the excitement in the air? I sure can!<br>
This is only the start, though! Peak excitement will be when the performances start!~<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Enterprise：</span><br>
Commander, thank you for always being here for us. You are the wind in our sails and the lighthouse that shows us the way.<br>
...That sounded more wistful than I meant it to. Ahem.<br>
Happy anniversary, Commander. Cheers.<br>

<br>
Big E, the Fighter<br>
Sometime later...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Enterprise：</span><br>
...And that's the speech. What are your thoughts, Commander?<br>
<br>
"It's well thought-out and has good flow. It's impeccable – like you."<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Enterprise：</span><br>
Thanks. I'm glad to hear you say that.<br>
I thought it might be too formal. I know my way around the battlefield, but social gatherings are a different beast.<br>
<br>
"I can empathize. Nobody wants to be that person who spoils the mood."<br>
"Still, it's not necessarily bad if the speech feels formal. What matters is that it conveys a sincere message."<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Enterprise：</span><br>
It's reassuring when you put it that way.<br>
<br>
"And, in a way, if it does sound formal, it's because you see the banquet as a battlefield, and this speech symbolizes your determination to take it on."<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Enterprise：</span><br>
That's... an interesting take. Didn't think you thought so too.<br>
<br>
"Too?"<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Enterprise：</span><br>
Yeah. Some of my friends have also compared the banquet hall to a battlefield.<br>
Like Brooklyn. She said social spaces and warzones are the same at the end of the day.<br>
<br>
"The comparison doesn't make much sense. Unless banquets became a life-or-death ordeal while I wasn't looking."<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Enterprise：</span><br>
Heh, yeah. I guess it means social exchanges are complicated.<br>
Either way, if the banquet is a battlefield, then I will fight. To the tune of my script, of course.<br>
I guess that makes my dress my combat uniform. Wish I felt a little more comfortable in it, but there's no time for that now.<br>
<br>
Enterprise's fighting spirit seems to ignite inside of her.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Enterprise：</span><br>
If I'm gonna go into battle...<br>
Then, obviously, I need you behind my back, Commander.<br>
What do say? Will you follow me?<br>
Into the treacherous warzone that is the banquet?<br>
<br>
"You already know the answer – gladly."<br>

<br>
Dressed to Impress<br>
On the other end of Essex's room, the sound of rustling fabrics...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Essex：</span><br>
I-I'll be done in just a minute. Please don't turn around yet!<br>
Aaand... there! Sheesh, putting a dress on without any help is a lot harder than I expected...<br>
Wait, no! The thing just slipped! Ugh...<br>
Okay... I'm ready now, Commander.<br>
You can turn around now... and look at my dress!<br>
Wh-what do you think?<br>
Does it look good on me?<br>
<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项1："Yes. It's on par with Enterprise's."</span>'''''<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项2："It's night and day compared to before."</span>'''''<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Essex：</span><br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项1）</span>'''''Really? You think so?<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项1）</span>'''''Although... I have mixed feelings about being "on par" with her...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Essex：</span><br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项2）</span>'''''Night and day, you say? I'm not sure what to make of that...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Essex：</span><br>
Sometimes, I just want to be told, "You look cute," or "You're pretty." That's not too much to ask...<br>
<br>
She mutters something under her breath and turns on her heel. Still under the influence, she staggers and nearly trips over her herself.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Essex：</span><br>
Urgh... I feel dizzy. In hindsight, I really drank way too much...<br>
Dang it, why is this stupid dress so long? It keeps getting in the way!<br>
<br>
It's clear she's sobered up somewhat over the past fifteen or so minutes. That's a relief.<br>
How, though? Sobering up takes longer than that, especially if you haven't eaten food or drank water.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Essex：</span><br>
Hey, Commander, could you help me over here?<br>
<br>
I offer a hand to help her get her bearings straight.<br>
Then, the next thing I know, she has wrapped her arms around mine and looks at me.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Essex：</span><br>
Hehehe... I got you nooow!<br>
Pleeease, Commander. Can't you give me your honest opinion on how I look?<br>
<br>
She squeezes my arm tightly. The wine must be empowering her – or at least encouraging her.<br>
<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项1："You look beautiful."</span>'''''<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项2："Your beauty is stunning."</span>'''''<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项3："You are drop-dead gorgeous."</span>'''''<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Essex：</span><br>
Hehe... Hehehe...<br>
Words of praise... From the horse's mouth...<br>
Even when I'm up against Enterprise, I'll try to look my best...<br>
But... Her dress is really, really pretty... Hehehe...<br>
Isn't that right... Commander?<br>
<br>
She looks me in the eyes and flashes a soft smile.<br>
Our faces are dangerously close to kissing distance. The smell of wine and her perfume tickles my nostrils.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Essex：</span><br>
Maybe it's just me... but you look even more attractive than usual tonight... ♪<br>
<br>
My assumption was wrong. She has not sobered up at all.<br>
There's no way I can let her roam the palace in her current state.<br>
At the same time, I can't just leave her behind. I suppose I have to look after her for a while...<br>

Musashi invites me onto a small boat. We'll follow the canal to get to the banquet.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Musashi：</span><br>
Hmm? You have a curious expression on you.<br>
Is it my kimono you're drawn to? It's my only one, at the moment.<br>
<br>
Dressing appropriately for the banquet is a must... and for some reason, she decided to change into a more traditional outfit.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Musashi：</span><br>
I'm sure you recognize it. It's what I wore at our pop-up café.~<br>
It's one of the reserve garments I packed in case something happened. I didn't expect to actually use it.<br>
But enough about me – I've heard you're not only a guest at the banquet, but also something of an organizer as well.<br>
<br>
"You've heard correctly. Who told you that, though?"<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Musashi：</span><br>
No one. It was merely a deduction based on your character. You are someone we can always turn to for help with anything.<br>
On top of you working all day, you just helped with that luggage. You must be quite exhausted, no?<br>
<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项1："Can't say I am."</span>'''''<br>

'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项1）</span>'''''You needn't do it for me.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Musashi：</span><br>

<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Musashi：</span><br>
No one can see us aboard this boat, much less interrupt.<br>
You may seek comfort beside me without fear of being judged.<br>
...No response? Is there something that prevents you from relaxing?<br>
<br>
"Not really. My work for the day is done, so it's not that. It's just..."<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Musashi：</span><br>
There is no need for "justs." You deserve a break after a tiring day, simple as that.<br>
Now, close your eyes.<br>
<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项1：(Do as she says.)</span>'''''<br>
<br>
Don't be nervous. Relax your muscles. *fluff fluff* ♥<br>
Yes, just like that. Feels comfortable, no? Heehee.<br>
I feel the fatigue leave my body – or is it my consciousness? It's hard to say...<br>
*fluff fluff*...♥ *fluff fluff*...♥<br>

Jean Bart leads me arm-in-arm to a quiet place elsewhere inside the palace.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Jean Bart：</span><br>
Phew... This place feels safe enough.<br>
<br>
......<br>
<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项1："What was that about?"</span>'''''<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Jean Bart：</span><br>
Didn't ya hear me earlier? I don't wanna be noticed.<br>
<br>
"So you led me all this way to avoid attention? Sounds a bit excessive."<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Jean Bart：</span><br>
Not like I had any damn choice.<br>
<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项1："Was it to get away from Massachusetts?"</span>'''''<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项2："Is this my fault?"</span>'''''<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Jean Bart：</span><br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项1）</span>'''''Yeah. I can't stand being around her. That's not the only reason, though.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Jean Bart：</span><br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项2）</span>'''''*sigh*... Listen.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Jean Bart：</span><br>
The shit Richelieu expects from me – the speech and all – I ain't cut out for it.<br>
Forcing smiles, minding my manners, people staring at me like some painting...<br>
I can't do it. I even told her that.<br>
I know she's got her hands tied. Same with Clemenceau. Someone's gotta represent the Orthodoxy out there.<br>
But that doesn't mean it HAS to be me.<br>
Why not have Jeanne do it? Why not Marseillaise? They'd do much better than me.<br>
<br>
"Maybe so, but the fact is that she entrusted YOU with the speech."<br>
"And I can't imagine she did so just to make a fool of you."<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Jean Bart：</span><br>
Oh, for sure. She doesn't have bad intentions or anything.<br>
If I had to guess, I think her goal is to get me used to being one of the Orthodoxy's representatives.<br>
<br>
"So you understand where she's coming from. Then why did you run?"<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Jean Bart：</span><br>
......<br>
<br>
"Okay. Here's what we'll do: I'll try to convince Richelieu to replace you with Jeanne so you don't have to–"<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Jean Bart：</span><br>
No.<br>
I'm still gonna do it. I already said I would. I'm a Templar Knight, dammit – I don't back down.<br>
<br>
"Then I have to ask again – why DID you run?"<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Jean Bart：</span><br>
Do I really gotta spell it out?<br>
I'm not denyin' I'm nervous about it, but the Orthodoxy's reputation matters more than a bit of discomfort.<br>
<br>
Jean Bart being upfront about her feelings is a rare and welcome sight. I can think of only one thing to say here.<br>
"I believe in you."<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Jean Bart：</span><br>
Thanks. I appreciate it.<br>
Anyway... 'bout time we head back now.<br>
I ran away from Massachusetts without sayin' a word. Oughta go and formally apologize to her.<br>
<br>
"That's a tall order right out of the gate. Do you want me to help? Chime in when you need it, maybe?"<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Jean Bart：</span><br>
Nah. I've gotta face my fears on my own. No two ways about it.<br>
Besides, I haven't got the time to psych myself up.<br>
So I just gotta do it – find Massachusetts and say sorry.<br>
Also... I know it's a lot to ask, but...<br>
You'll stick with me until it's time, won't you?<br>

<br>
The Blackout Nightmare<br>
'How long have I been out? I still have a mission to do...'<br>
'Dammit... Brain fog makes it impossible to think...'<br>
'Guess the sleeping med hasn't worn off yet...'<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Avrora?：</span><br>
I get the picture now. Continue with the job.<br>
I'll say this one last time – bring 'em back ALIVE. Got it?<br>
<br>
A figure I can only assume is Avrora barks out an order, then turns her attention to me.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Avrora?：</span><br>
Heh. You're finally awake. That was earlier than I expected.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Avrora：</span><br>
Better that way. The soon this is over with, the sooner I can send you away.<br>
Now spit it out. Tell me everything you know.<br>
<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项1："What are you talking about?"</span>'''''<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项2："I don't know anything."</span>'''''<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Avrora：</span><br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项1）</span>'''''What was that? Are you playing dumb with me, or are you still drugged out?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Avrora?：</span><br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项2）</span>'''''Of course you don't. Like you don't all tell me that every single day.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Avrora?：</span><br>
Doesn't matter. I didn't expect you to spill the beans just because I asked nicely.<br>
Since you didn't want to do this the easy way, we'll do it the hard way.<br>
Let's see how much pain it takes to make you squeal. Hehehe...<br>
<br>
"Avrora, no! Stop!"<br>
Wait a second. Avrora would never say or do anything like this!<br>
The only answer is...<br>
<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项1："I'm in a dream?"</span>'''''<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项2："I'm not telling you anything! Just kill me!"</span>'''''<br>
<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项1）</span>'''''The second the thought forms in my head, my surroundings start to fade out, like a light being dimmed.<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项1）</span>'''''The world is once more engulfed in a confused, groggy darkness.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Avrora?：</span><br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项2）</span>'''''Oh? So you know my name. That means there's a rat in our ranks.~<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项2）</span>'''''Thanks for the tip. That gives me two cans of beans to crack open.<br>
<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项2）</span>'''''"I don't care what you do to me! I'm not telling you a damn thing!"<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项2）</span>'''''"My secrets... will die with me!"<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Avrora?：</span><br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项2）</span>'''''Hah! Been long since I dealt with someone with an actual backbone. Now you've got me excited.~<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项2）</span>'''''I'm gonna enjoy finding out how long you'll last. Hehehe.<br>
<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项2）</span>'''''"AAAAHHHH!"<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Avrora?：</span><br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项2）</span>'''''Cry! Scream! Eat this goddamn piroshki!~<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Avrora：</span><br>
Oh dear... The Commander is tossing and turning.<br>
Maybe a lap pillow wasn't the brightest idea. My legs are getting numb...<br>
Although... This is the least I can do, after that blunder.<br>
<br>
"Avrora! Stop!"<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Avrora：</span><br>
*gasp*! St-stop what?<br>
What kind of awful dream did you have?<br>

The Orthodoxy's Banquet<br>
<br>
Finally Letting Loose<br>
After enjoying a dance in the ballroom, Bismarck and I went to the theater room to view some performances.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Bismarck：</span><br>
That jazz number was very novel compared to the classical music I'm familiar with.<br>
The same melody played with different instruments can produce an entirely new-feeling song.<br>
Oh, you brought refreshments? Thank you, Commander.<br>
<br>
"No problem. I hope they're to your liking."<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Bismarck：</span><br>
They look delicious. Let me try one.<br>
<br>
In her typical elegant and formal fashion, she picks up a pastry and takes a bite.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Bismarck：</span><br>
Delicious, and with a distinct mouthfeel.<br>
<br>
"So, how do you feel about the banquet now? You seem to be enjoying yourself."<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Bismarck：</span><br>
You could say that. The general vibe has changed a little with you around.<br>
<br>
"Is it no longer formal and demanding of a serious approach, as you said earlier?"<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Bismarck：</span><br>
...Yes. I suppose this situation calls for a party-person mindset.<br>
It's rare that I get the chance to actually enjoy a banquet. It's partly due to who I am as a person.<br>
Most of the time, I approach celebrations as a leader – formally, and moderately. It's a lot like a job, really.<br>
Even when the chance presents itself for me to let loose, I can't get completely comfortable.<br>
And let's be fair, neither can you. If you receive an important message, you need to respond immediately.<br>
Then, suddenly, your guard is up and you can't enjoy the taste of good food or appreciate the sound of a great song.<br>
<br>
"It doesn't have to be that way. The Iron Blood can handle one day without you at the helm."<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Bismarck：</span><br>
Oh, to leave my work at the door and enjoy the moment with my friends...<br>
I wish I could. But I have my duties.<br>
<br>
"If something urgent does crop up, you can simply ask someone else to take care of it. That includes me."<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Bismarck：</span><br>
You're right. I suppose I could briefly hang up my hat and rely on you.<br>
...Alright. I'll take you up on your offer.<br>
I'll do as you say and enjoy this banquet without worrying about what-ifs.<br>
<br>
"I really hope you'll have the time of your life tonight."<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Bismarck：</span><br>
I will, with you by my side.<br>

<br>
The Orthodoxy's Banquet<br>
<br>
A Toast to Our Host<br>
After finishing my stroll around the palace with Elizabeth, I return to the banquet hall, where I find someone waiting for me.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Sheffield：</span><br>
Master, I've been asked to forward a message to you from Her Majesty. I urge you to read it at once.<br>
<br>
She hands me an ornate card, embellished with royal iconography.<br>
In short, it tells me to come to a certain numbered room.<br>
By the time I finish reading and look up, Sheffield is gone. I infer this to mean I should come alone.<br>
Beyond the numbered door is a big room, furnished in typical Royal Navy fashion.<br>
Its lavishness rivals that of Elizabeth's own royal chamber. It's almost hard to believe a room like this exists within this palace.<br>
At the center of the room is a dining table. On the other end of it, Elizabeth sits by herself.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Belfast：</span><br>
Welcome, Master. Her Majesty is waiting for you.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Queen Elizabeth：</span><br>
Took you long enough, servant!<br>
<br>
"Sorry, I don't know this palace so I got lost for a while. That aside, very luxurious place you have here."<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Queen Elizabeth：</span><br>
You mean this VIP room?<br>
Of course it is. Elites such as me deserve elite treatment. I'm sure they provided Bismarck with something equally opulent.<br>
<br>
"I take it you're done experiencing normalcy, then?"<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Queen Elizabeth：</span><br>
I've enjoyed it enough for a while.<br>
<br>
Belfast gestures at me, then shows me to my seat at the table.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Queen Elizabeth：</span><br>
Take a seat.<br>
Reckon you still have room in your stomach?<br>
<br>
"I might. Did the Royal Maids prepare the whole feast you have here?"<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Queen Elizabeth：</span><br>
No, only the tea, courtesy of Bel. Everything else is from the Orthodoxy's kitchen.<br>
It's the same as what they're serving in the banquet hall. If you're not hungry, you may pass.<br>
<br>
"It might be the same food, but the experience is different. It surely affects the taste when you eat in a queen's opulent room, per her invitation."<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Queen Elizabeth：</span><br>
Well, well! You can be charming from time to time.<br>
<br>
My dinner with Elizabeth is pleasant.<br>
The mood is quiet, relaxing, and feels like it's another world compared to the hustle and bustle of the banquet hall.<br>
Leaning back to admire my surroundings, I notice something strange – while my cup contains tea, Elizabeth's seems to contain wine.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Queen Elizabeth：</span><br>
Wondering why you don't get any wine, do you? Because you need to stay sober until the main event.<br>
As for why I'M drinking wine... I just wanted something different.<br>
Let's not forget that the Orthodoxy is famous for its wine.<br>
Furthermore, Richelieu put a great deal of thought into her selection.<br>
She hand-picked different vintage brands to match each guest's preferences, you see. And she did a marvellous job.<br>
<br>
She takes a sip from her cup of wine and savors it with all the elegance befitting a queen.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Queen Elizabeth：</span><br>
As I've said many times already, the Orthodoxy really did a remarkable job with this banquet.<br>
Everything is spotless, from the general gist to the fine details.<br>
But what do you think, servant? Have you been enjoying yourself?<br>
<br>
"Absolutely. I've not once felt anything could've been better."<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Queen Elizabeth：</span><br>
Good to hear. We're in agreement.<br>
<br>
Right then, I hear a ring on my communicator. It's an invitation.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Queen Elizabeth：</span><br>
Must be from Richelieu. Seems you never have a moment to rest, eh?<br>
Go. She's waiting for you.<br>
Don't worry about me. I've had you to myself enough for one day. Plus, I'm a little tipsy, so I should stay and rest.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Belfast：</span><br>
If you would, Master, please follow me.<br>
<br>
Belfast leads me to the door. As I leave, I overhear Elizabeth whispering something to herself.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Queen Elizabeth：</span><br>
The Orthodoxy can have this one victory.<br>
It's their banquet, after all. It'd be rude of us to steal their thunder.<br>
Enjoy the celebration now, servant.<br>

<br>
Schedule-wise, the banquet should be nearing its climax now.<br>
In reality, though, spirits are still rising – both of the soul, and of the bottle.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Kirov：</span><br>
I know you can hold your liquor, Comrade Commander. Don't be a teetotaler and drink up!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Avrora：</span><br>
Don't you worry. My canteen actually contains water this time... or does it? Heehee~<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Queen Elizabeth：</span><br>
Not again, servant! Stop letting the drunkards sink their claws into you!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Wakatsuki：</span><br>
The Commander certainly is popular. For better or worse...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Sakawa：</span><br>
What do you say we walk over and snatch the Commander for ourselves, Lady Musashi?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Musashi：</span><br>
No. Only a fool gets between two fighting tigers to steal their prey.<br>
Let us wait for a more opportune time, when the Commander needs external help.<br>
And be vigilant. We aren't the only ones who want a piece of the Commander.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Bismarck：</span><br>
......<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Prinz Eugen：</span><br>
Well, fellow hunters, that might take a while. Let's pass the time with some of our domestically-produced beer, shall we?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Richelieu：</span><br>
Whew... Finally, a moment to breathe. Enjoying yourself, Jean?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Jean Bart：</span><br>
Yeah. Not a bad party, I guess. You, uh... wanna share a toast?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Richelieu：</span><br>
Why, I'd love to. To a long and eventful night!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Essex：</span><br>
Heeey, Enterprise... You like the refreshments? I do, and I could use some more!<br>
*hic*... Commander... C'mere, I wanna talk! Ahaha...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Enterprise：</span><br>
For god's sake, Essex... Go easy on the drinks. People are looking.<br>
<br>
My gut told me that things would get a little TOO rowdy if I stayed in the hall, so I decided to step outside for a while.<br>
Fortunately, nobody saw me sneaking out. I'd hate for it to look like I'm bailing on everyone.<br>
I look up at the night sky, the laughter and cheering from inside the hall still ringing in my ears. It's like a battlefield in there.<br>
I take a deep breath of fresh air. This is just what I needed.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">？？？：</span><br>
Well, well. Going outside right before the clock strikes midnight.<br>
Needed a break, I presume? That's why I'm here, too.<br>
<br>
"I recognize that voice... Clemenceau?"<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Clemenceau：</span><br>
Do forgive me if I'm disrupting the moment.<br>
<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项1：Not at all. Stay here if you'd like.</span>'''''<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Clemenceau：</span><br>
Alright. If you're sure.<br>
*sniff sniff*...<br>
The girls in there really left their mark on you, didn't they?<br>
I can smell perfume residue all over you. Iron Blood, Sakura Empire, Iris Orthodoxy... There's a little bit from everyone.<br>
It must be exhausting, being passed around from faction to faction like a volleyball.<br>
Maybe I should rub some of my scent off on you as well, hmm?<br>
<br>
"Might the words 'have mercy on me' convince you not to?"<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Clemenceau：</span><br>
Heehee. I was only joking.<br>
<br>
"Fair enough. By the way, you look a little worn out. Is it that taxing to oversee a banquet and speak to guests?"<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Clemenceau：</span><br>
It is. I'm very much not a people person.<br>
Nor am I a party person. I'm not much for clinking glasses and engaging in warm conversations – I like my drinks with a side of sea breeze and solitude.<br>
Besides, with Richelieu on the scene, nobody will notice if I'm gone.<br>
...I'm curious, Commander. How do you feel about our banquet?<br>
<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项1："It's a typical banquet, and I like that."</span>'''''<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项2："It was a lot of work, but I'm having a great time."</span>'''''<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项3："It's thrilling, that's for sure."</span>'''''<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Clemenceau：</span><br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项1）</span>'''''Yes, typical. I think so too.<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项1）</span>'''''The celebrations we throw at this port feel normal and commonplace, in the best way.<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项1）</span>'''''They're symbols of the calm, peaceful life we enjoy, and the normality we strive to maintain.<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项1）</span>'''''Heehee. I feel like I know you better now than I did before.~<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Clemenceau：</span><br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项2）</span>'''''"It was a lot of work, but I'm having a great time."<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项2）</span>'''''But, it was worth it. As far as entertaining the guests is concerned, this banquet is perfect.<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项2）</span>'''''You deserve acknowledgment for your part, too. This banquet wouldn't be what it is without you.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Clemenceau：</span><br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项3）</span>'''''Thrilling, you say? Interesting... Perhaps there are things beyond even my predictions going on in there.<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项3）</span>'''''Seems you navigate parties like you navigate the battlefield. I feel like I know you a little better now.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Clemenceau：</span><br>
Alright, we've both had enough fresh air. It's time to lead you to the next battlefront.<br>
<br>
"The next battlefront? Meaning...?"<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Clemenceau：</span><br>
When this palace was built, we had a few secret passageways and hidden rooms constructed as well.<br>
Think of it as an exploratory detour. You won't be disappointed.<br>
Come on. Let's enjoy this party to the end – together.<br>
