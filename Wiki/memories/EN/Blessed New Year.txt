New Year's Blessings<br>
<br>
Chapter 1 Kitchen Commotion<br>
 <br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Akashi：</span><br>
I'm back nya~! Whew... I bought some soba and mochi nya~<br>
So, could you all help me make some zouni? You can be the first to taste it once it's done nya!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Yuudachi：</span><br>
Woof! I smell mochi! Let's eat, right now! ...But I don't wanna leave the kotatsu, it's too comfy...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Urakaze：</span><br>
On that topic, making New Year's food is a Sakura Empire tradition... and a historian would be able to make truly traditional zouni!<br>
We of Destroyer Division 17 shall lend you a hand! Now let us head for the kitchen!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Isokaze：</span><br>
We ought to make it fast! We've still got the backyard to clean afterwards!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Tanikaze：</span><br>
I don't think we should rush it; it's important to get New Year's food done right...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">{{AF|Hamakaze}}：</span><br>
"The man who chases 2 rabbits catches neither." We have to help Akashi first!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Akashi：</span><br>
Can you handle it nya...? Making zouni takes quite some time nya. I hope you're ready for that nya!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Isokaze：</span><br>
Oh, shoot! I got it on my clothes!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Urakaze：</span><br>
I told you to be careful! Why would you mix it so hard?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Akashi：</span><br>
Oh dear nya... Those stains aren't easy to get rid of nya...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">{{AF|Hamakaze}}：</span><br>
Isokaze just never listens to people.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Tanikaze：</span><br>
Well, there's no use grumbling over it now... But that reminds me, wasn't Urakaze-chan making some new clothes?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Urakaze：</span><br>
I'm not finished with them yet! And I'm only making one set anyway...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">{{AF|Hamakaze}}：</span><br>
Come on, Urakaze. You're not just going to let Isokaze spend New Year's wearing dirty clothes, are you?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Urakaze：</span><br>
Fine, fine! I get it! *Sigh*, why should I have to pay for Isokaze's mistake...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Isokaze：</span><br>
Tadah! Look at these cute clothes! They fit me perfectly!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Urakaze：</span><br>
They're hardly a perfect fit, but of course they're cute. Though they're not finished, I still poured my heart into making them!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Akashi：</span><br>
A-anyway, all that's left is adding the mochi to the mix nya. Just let me handle that nya.<br>
Since Urakaze-chan could go crazy if someone gets her precious clothes dirty nya...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">{{AF|Hamakaze}}：</span><br>
We're really sorry. We said we'd help, but in the end we hardly did anything but get in the way...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Akashi：</span><br>
It's okay nya! Everyone's so busy around this time of year that I appreciate almost any help I can get nya.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Isokaze：</span><br>
Okay, then it's time for us to withdraw! We'll be back to help again when the zouni is ready!<br>

Chapter 2 New Year's Snow<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Yuudachi：</span><br>
Aw yeah~ Kotatsus are frickin' amazing~<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Shigure：</span><br>
Here we have Yuudachi in her natural habitat: by the kotatsu, adamantly refusing to come out...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Atago：</span><br>
Well, it's winter; who can blame her? ...Oh, look outside! It seems it's started snowing.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Yuudachi：</span><br>
Snow?! Oh, man, it's snowing! C'mon, Shigure, let's have a snowball fight!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Shigure：</span><br>
Hey! Let go! Don't drag me along!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Isokaze：</span><br>
Wow, look at all that snow! It's piled up so quickly!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Urakaze：</span><br>
Hmph, I don't see why anyone would get so fired up over a bit of snowfall.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Isokaze：</span><br>
Then why is your tail wagging so much? It's moving faster than Nobunaga's unification of Japan!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Urakaze：</span><br>
No it's not! L-like I'd ever get excited over some stupid snow!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Akagi：</span><br>
A trim here and a snip there... Fufufufu... Ahh... I can't wait to see how much he'll love my present...<br>
...There seems to be quite the commotion outside.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Kaga：</span><br>
Seems so... Might be those destroyers having a snowball fight.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Akagi：</span><br>
Ufufu, perhaps we should pay them a visit later.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Kaga：</span><br>
That's unusual... I never thought you'd care about such things.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Akagi：</span><br>
Oh, I'm just in the mood. Would you like to join us, Souryuu?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Souryuu：</span><br>
I'm afraid I have to decline as I still have New Year's cards I must write.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">？？？：</span><br>
In that case, why don't we tag along?<br>
The early snow is the omen of a fortunate year... I think it would be really nice if I... would be able to enjoy the holidays together with everyone.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Atago：</span><br>
Why, if it isn't Izumo and Ibuki! You deserve praise for your last commission.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Izumo：</span><br>
We're just doing our job. That doesn't warrant any praise.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ibuki：</span><br>
That must be a snowball fight I hear... It looks like they're having fun.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Akagi：</span><br>
Fufufufu, so you'd like to participate as well? Fine. Then let us fight so we can once and for all see who is the most worthy of being by the commander's side!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ibuki：</span><br>
E-excuse me?! You mean to take part in the snowball fight?!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Kaga：</span><br>
A snowball fight is not so different from a mission or practice. And the 1st Carrier Division will hold nothing back!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Yuudachi：</span><br>
Heh! Carriers don't stand an icicle's chance in hell against me in a snowball fight!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Souryuu：</span><br>
Wait! We just cleaned the yard, so please don't make a mess in it!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Yuudachi：</span><br>
Huh? Fine... then let's do it somewhere else. Then at least we won't make a mess of the yard.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">{{AF|Hamakaze}}：</span><br>
Yeah. How about the drydock nearby? It's big and not very windy. And it's been empty for a while so I'm sure nobody would mind.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Tanikaze：</span><br>
That's a great idea, Hamakaze-chan! I'm starting to feel like you know everything~<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Izumo：</span><br>
At last it's time to show the fruits of my training. Come! Let us fight like it were a real battle!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Souryuu：</span><br>
Everyone gets so excited around New Year's... I just hope they don't make a mess... *Sigh*, my stomach's already starting to ache...<br>

Chapter 3 The Great Snowball Brawl<br>
Port - Docks<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Yuudachi：</span><br>
Hm? I think those people are... from the Eagle Union and the Royal Navy? And I think they're having a snowball fight too?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Cleveland：</span><br>
Raaaaagh! Taste the full force of our snowball volley!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Prince of Wales：</span><br>
I should expect no less of the Royal Navy's most sworn and trusted friend. Then how do you like THIS?!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Eldridge：</span><br>
Snowball... sparky.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Cygnet：</span><br>
Awwhhh... I-I've been hit...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Montpelier：</span><br>
Sis! Look out!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">St. Louis：</span><br>
Helena, give Cleveland backup! Use the SG radar if you have to!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Cygnet：</span><br>
Use the SG...? But it's just a snowball fight...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Cleveland：</span><br>
Ahahaha... I think I've gone a little bit overboard...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Helena：</span><br>
Cleveland... Don't you know you'll strain your shoulder if you throw it too hard...?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Cleveland：</span><br>
Heh, relax, I'm fine! I'm just starting to get warmed up!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">St. Louis：</span><br>
Oh...? Aren't those... Sakura Empire girls?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Cygnet：</span><br>
Fueehhh... N-nice to see you, folks...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Kaga：</span><br>
Well look at that... Who'd have thought all these people would be here... Fufufu, looks like this will be an enjoyable battle.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Akagi：</span><br>
(Whispering) Ufufu... I just need to eliminate all the people here, then I can be with the commander forever...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Helena：</span><br>
Looks like Akagi is up to her same old schemes...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Prince of Wales：</span><br>
I see no reason to decline your challenge! But you should know that beating us will not be a simple task.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Cleveland：</span><br>
Hahah, now things are getting interesting! Knights of the Sea, let's do this!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Urakaze：</span><br>
Hmph! We will fight too! Come on, Isokaze, Tanikaze, Hamakaze!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Destroyers：</span><br>
Let's do this!<br>
<br>
The snowball fight continued.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Cygnet：</span><br>
Fueehhh... I'm starting to feel like a snowman...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Atago：</span><br>
Oh dear, it's gotten so late. I say we head home. We still have to write our New Year's cards.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Yuudachi：</span><br>
Right! Let's get home and eat some soba and mochi!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Akagi：</span><br>
It seems our battle will not end today... Perhaps I was too busy thinking about my present for the commander to properly concentrate...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Izumo：</span><br>
That was quite the engaging snowball fight. I swear we shall fight once more another day! Now I will take my leave as I still have New Year's preparations to make!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Prince of Wales：</span><br>
Preparations for New Year's, huh...<br>

Chapter 4 The Sakura Empire's New Year<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Prince of Wales：</span><br>
I've long heard the Sakura Empire's new year celebrations are lively... but are they really that fun?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Cleveland：</span><br>
I'm curious about that "sobaean muchy" thing Yuudachi mentioned! Man, I'm starving after throwing so many snowballs.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Yuudachi：</span><br>
You wanna try Akashi's handmade mochi, huh? Let me tell you, it's like a bombshell from Flavortown!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Helena：</span><br>
Now that you mention it, last year Laffey taught me a lot of interesting things about Japanese New Year's.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">St. Louis：</span><br>
Right. Like about gods, shrine visits, that kind of stuff?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Eldridge：</span><br>
Mochi. Want.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Prince of Wales：</span><br>
I mainly heard about it through Iron Blood channels. I believe they said "the more people, the better it is."<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Cygnet：</span><br>
Umm... there's also the way Eugen drinks... Oh, I guess it's pretty hard to imagine how that looks...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Kaga：</span><br>
From them, huh? I believe it's called "the more, the merrier." If you're that curious about it you may as well come to the Sakura Empire dormitory and see for yourselves.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Izumo：</span><br>
Exactly. If you're so curious then we could invite everyone to try and show how generous the Sakura Empire is. Any objections, Akagi?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Montpelier：</span><br>
It sounds kinda weird to celebrate a holiday with some people you just fought...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Cleveland：</span><br>
Don't be like that. Sure we're from different factions, but we're all comrades just trying to keep this base peaceful! No need to be so headstrong, Montpelier! Hahahah!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Montpelier：</span><br>
W-well, if you say so...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ibuki：</span><br>
Since the snow on your clothes is starting to melt, perhaps we should head for the dormitory soon?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Helena：</span><br>
You're right. We'll get sick if we wear wet clothes in this weather. Let's go right away.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Yuudachi：</span><br>
All right! All units: full steam ahead! Our target is Akashi's zouni!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Akashi：</span><br>
Whew~ My zouni is finally done nya! Who wants to be the first to...<br>
Nya?! Where did everybody go?!<br>

Chapter 5 A Gift From Akashi<br>
Port - Sakura Empire Dormitory<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Akashi：</span><br>
Nyah... I'm glad you brought me some customers and all, but...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Souryuu：</span><br>
I should've guessed you don't stock clothes for this many people.<br>
But then how will we help our freezing Union and Royal Navy friends...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Akashi：</span><br>
If it's come down to this... then I have no choice but to let you all wear some new clothes I've prepared nya!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Montpelier：</span><br>
(I've got a feeling like... Akashi's planning something...!)<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">St. Louis：</span><br>
This outfit... it's what's known as a "kimono", right? Ahah... It seems to be made of quite fancy materials.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Cygnet：</span><br>
Whoa... these clothes... are warmer than I thought they'd be~<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Helena：</span><br>
These decorative strings and hems... make it feel a little hard to move around.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Eldridge：</span><br>
Glasses nice. No emit sparks. Hair will be ruined...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">{{AF|Izumo}}：</span><br>
This makes me want to perform kabuki. It's flamboyant and doesn't get in the way.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">{{AF|Ibuki}}：</span><br>
And I received a regular kimono. Somehow it feels relaxing to wear.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Prince of Wales：</span><br>
Now I see. These kimonos have design elements from various different factions. Hahah, how fascinating!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Cleveland：</span><br>
....W-what the heck is this...?!<br>
I-I've got urgent business to do, so I've gotta go early!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Montpelier：</span><br>
(I wanted to see how Cleveland's would've looked...)<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Akashi：</span><br>
There's no helping that nya... Now it's your turn, Montpelier. Come on, put this on nya!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Montpelier：</span><br>
Wha?!<br>
(So this is how a kimono looks... I think Columbia and Denver would like it.)<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Akashi：</span><br>
Hah hah ha! Now, tell me what you think about it nya!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Montpelier：</span><br>
Meh. I don't really think much of it.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Akashi：</span><br>
... ...<br>
H-has everyone gotten changed nya? Then come have your fill of New Year's food nya!<br>

Chapter 6 Dinner Takes An Exciting Turn<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Isokaze：</span><br>
Wow! Soba and zouni! Finally we get to have dinner!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Prince of Wales：</span><br>
So that's "mochi" floating in the pot. Let's give it a try...<br>
Mm...! What a peculiar texture! It's so soft, yet hard to actually chew...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Eldridge：</span><br>
Mochi. Good.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Cygnet：</span><br>
It really is! It's nothing like what I'd normally eat, but it still tastes so good!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Montpelier：</span><br>
She still hasn't come back... Her soba's gonna go cold...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Helena：</span><br>
I'll go look for her. She might slip and get hurt now that there's snow everywhere...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">St. Louis：</span><br>
Relax and don't think about it too much, Helena. Cleveland's a strong girl, she's not one to get hurt like that.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Helena：</span><br>
But...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Cleveland：</span><br>
Yo! I'm back!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">St. Louis：</span><br>
Hahah, see? I told you she'd be fine. Good timing, Cleveland! You know, apparently this "soba" thing tastes better while it's still warm.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Cleveland：</span><br>
Oh, thanks! Hey, wait, why's there a blanket going through the table?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Isokaze：</span><br>
Because it's a kotatsu. It's our ultimate weapon to combat the cold!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Cleveland：</span><br>
So you're warming yourselves up? Sorry, but I think I'll... Hey, stop, Louis! Let go of my poncho!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Souryuu：</span><br>
It seems like everyone, regardless of their faction, has gotten intimately familiar with the kotatsu.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Akashi：</span><br>
Yep, you can't beat the kotatsu nya...<br>
Oh! I forgot to give you all your New Year's cards nya!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Souryuu：</span><br>
I prepared them while you were chatting earlier. Here.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Cygnet：</span><br>
Is this a flower...? How cute! Thank you so much!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Helena：</span><br>
This is a picture of... ah, it's a blue bird which symbolizes happiness! Thank you. I will treasure it.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Eldridge：</span><br>
Sparkle... cute. Like.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Montpelier：</span><br>
Mine has snow and flower petals, and Cleveland's has a bald eagle on it. Hm, I'm not sure... what to think...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Cleveland：</span><br>
Hm? We can swap if you like mine more.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Montpelier：</span><br>
N-no, it's fine! T-this works too... (Blushes)<br>

Chapter 7 New Year's Blessings<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Akashi：</span><br>
Nya?! It's this late already nya?!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Prince of Wales：</span><br>
Late? Does that mean it's time we go visit a shrine?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Cygnet：</span><br>
We go to a shrine, say our wishes for the year, and... Umm, I can't remember what it's called...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">{{AF|Ibuki}}：</span><br>
It's called a hatsumode, the first shrine visit of the year. It's said that the first wish of the year you make will always come true.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Montpelier：</span><br>
New Year's wish, huh. (Whispering) I wonder if it'll really come true...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Cleveland：</span><br>
Hm? Did you say something?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Montpelier：</span><br>
No, nothing. Just that I'll keep working hard to try to be more like you.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">St. Louis：</span><br>
Is there anything you're hoping will come true, Helena?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Helena：</span><br>
Huh? Me? Well...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">{{AF|Izumo}}：</span><br>
Hold it. If you say your wish out loud, it won't come true. Your wishes are for the gods' ears only.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Akashi：</span><br>
At any rate, we'd better go now nya! The day is coming to an end nya!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">{{AF|Izumo}}：</span><br>
Whoa! I've never visited the port's shrine before, but I didn't expect it to be this magnificent!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">{{AF|Ibuki}}：</span><br>
It's marvelous that such a divine place exists on this base... I'm certain the gods will watch over it.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Prince of Wales：</span><br>
I see. I'm surprised that there'd be such an awe-inspiring building on the base's premises.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Isokaze：</span><br>
(Whispering) Psst, Akashi-san... last year, this place was...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Akashi：</span><br>
Shh! You don't need to tell anyone that nya!<br>
Anyhow, be quick and make your wishes nya! And don't forget you have to clap twice, put your hands together, and bow nya!<br>
<br>
Yes... but first, it's time to appreciate some good anime...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">St. Louis：</span><br>
So what did everyone wish for?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Cleveland：</span><br>
Uh, didn't Izumo tell us not to say our wishes out loud or they won't come true?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Prince of Wales：</span><br>
Well, people of all cultures wish for good health and happy lives. Happy new year, everyone.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">{{AF|Ibuki}}：</span><br>
That they do. Let's work together to restore peace and harmony to this world.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Akashi：</span><br>
...Hah hah ha...<br>
I can tell you my wish: that tomorrow I'll have the money you owe me for renting those clothes nya!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Everyone：</span><br>
WHAAAAAT?!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Akashi：</span><br>
Nya♪ It looks like this will be another prosperous year for me! Happy new year nya!<br>
