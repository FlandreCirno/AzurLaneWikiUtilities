The Melancholy of a Princess Chevalier<br>
<br>
Chapter 1 - Teatime Visitor<br>
One afternoon at the port...<br>
Belfast：<br>
Master, Lady Triomphant, please enjoy.<br>
<br>
Le Triomphant and I showed up to join the Royal Navy's tea time.<br>
Le Triomphant：<br>
I'm honored to have been invited to your famous afternoon tea time.<br>
<br>
As she spoke, Le Triomphant took out a cutely-wrapped present.<br>
Queen Elizabeth：<br>
Hmm... So you're the new arrival from Iris Libre?<br>
Good, I see that Iris Libre also cultivates some fine young ladies.<br>
And you, the commoner over there! You should be more thankful, since I went out of my way to invite you!<br>
<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项1：Thank you very much! Long live the Queen!</span>'''''<br>
<br>
It seems that Le Triomphant had made a good impression upon Her Majesty.<br>
If you wanted to look at it a certain way, they certainly seemed to give off the same vibe.<br>
Le Triomphant：<br>
Commander, you were thinking of something rude just now, weren't you?<br>
<br>
The chief maid, Belfast, was pouring tea for everyone.<br>
Le Triomphant：<br>
This aroma is... Darjeeling?<br>
Belfast：<br>
Yes. This particular batch was freshly picked in the spring. It's Her Majesty's favorite.<br>
Le Triomphant：<br>
I see, so that's why it's so refreshing. I've always heard that the First Flush of Darjeeling is one of the most precious teas.<br>
Queen Elizabeth：<br>
Heh heh, precisely! I can see that you have discerning tastes~♪<br>
<br>
...<br>
Le Triomphant：<br>
Being here reminds me... of the tea parties we used to have back in Iris Libre...<br>
<br>
Le Triomphant's eyes seemed to swim with a mix of affection and loneliness.<br>
Perhaps it would be nice to have a tea party with the Vichya girls as well.<br>

Chapter 2 - Do Your Best, Le Triomphant!<br>
Port - Commander's Office<br>
Le Triomphant：<br>
Commander, here is a list of the ships participating in today's joint exercise. Please have a look.<br>
<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项1：Joint... Exercise?</span>'''''<br>
Le Triomphant：<br>
Really, have you already forgotten? According to the plan that we made a while back, we would conduct a joint exercise between Iris Libre and the Royal Navy as a part of our ongoing daily training.<br>
As the commander of the fleet, everyone's counting on you to keep things together. Come on, please hurry and check the list.<br>
<br>
After getting scolded by my secretary ship...<br>
I made a few small modifications to the list.<br>
Le Triomphant：<br>
You'd like to adjust the list? Let me see...<br>
Huh? You'd like me to lead the vanguard fleet?<br>
It's because you want everyone to see my combat performance?<br>
Heh. If that's the case, then I readily accept!<br>
Commander, I'll be glad to show you - and everyone else - just how powerful the Le Fantasque-class is!<br>
<br>
...<br>
Afternoon - Training Grounds<br>
Le Triomphant：<br>
Make sure to match each others' pace! Don't charge forward on accident!<br>
Stay calm and collected. This isn't a solo operation, so don't be afraid to ask for help!<br>
... Good work. We've finished this area, so let's go support our allies in the next area!<br>
<br>
Due to Le Triomphant's successes, Iris Libre's team started off with a strong score.<br>
<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项1：Praise Le Triomphant</span>'''''<br>
Le Triomphant：<br>
Heheh, thank you very much, Commander.<br>
What'd I tell you? Are you impressed with how powerful the Le Fantasque-class is?<br>
That said, we're still working on the basics.<br>
If my sisters were here...<br>
<br>
Le Triomphant seemed to be immersed in her memories again...<br>
Le Triomphant：<br>
Ahem! Nevermind! In any case, let's all review the results of today's joint exercise...<br>
<br>
Ahh, what an exemplary secretary ship.<br>

Chapter 3 - Le Triomphant, Sortie!<br>
Operation Sea Area<br>
Le Triomphant：<br>
Torpedoes incoming from port! Watch out!<br>
Please keep firing!<br>
Line ahead! We're going to break the enemy's formation!<br>
Requesting assistance from the main fleet!<br>
Are preparations complete? Please provide us with aerial support!<br>
You'll find that the speed of the Le Fantasque-class is not easily matched!<br>
Commander, operation complete! We'll be able to come back home soon, hehe~!<br>
<br>
With Le Triomphant's leadership, the combat operation was a great success.<br>
Port - Harbor<br>
<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项1：Praise Le Triomphant</span>'''''<br>
Le Triomphant：<br>
It's only natural! It comes with being an elegant Le Fantasque-class destroyer.<br>
However, this victory would not have been possible without everyone's hard work.<br>
That includes you too, Commander. Your instructions were also important!<br>
I'm glad that I was able to be a part of such an excellent fleet!<br>
So once again, good job on the operation, everyone. Commander, would you like to join me for some tea before we get back to work?<br>
<br>
Ahh, what an exemplary secretary ship. Truly without equal.<br>

Chapter 4 - Cheer Up, Le Triomphant!<br>
Le Triomphant and I were patrolling the port together.<br>
Le Triomphant：<br>
All right! Let's prepare ourselves for another fine day of work!<br>
<br>
She seemed to be quite energetic today.<br>
Erebus：<br>
Ah... it's Commander... Terror, come here and greet the commander!<br>
Terror：<br>
Hello, Le Triomphant... and Commander...<br>
<br>
We had bumped into Erebus and Terror.<br>
Le Triomphant：<br>
Good day, Miss Erebus, Miss Terror.<br>
Erebus：<br>
Thank you, Le Triomphant. After sortieing with you, Terror seems to be a lot more confident in herself.<br>
Terror：<br>
Thank you...<br>
Le Triomphant：<br>
There's no need to thank me. Terror has always been very capable, all I did was give her a little support.<br>
Erebus：<br>
I'm terribly sorry, but we're going to have to get going. Too much sunlight is bad for Terror's body. Terror, want to go get some sweets?<br>
Terror：<br>
Sure...<br>
<br>
With that, Erebus lead Terror off.<br>
Le Triomphant：<br>
Self-confidence, huh...<br>
Lexington：<br>
Oh my, Le Triomphant? Are you on patrol with Commander today?<br>
Le Triomphant：<br>
Good day, Miss Lexington, Miss Saratoga.<br>
Saratoga：<br>
Eh? Ehhhh?! How'd you find me? I was gonna sneak up on Commander and get a real good reaction!<br>
Le Triomphant：<br>
I'm sorry, Miss Saratoga... I seem to have made a mistake...<br>
Lexington：<br>
Knock it off, Saratoga. You're a member of the Lexington-class, so you should take some lessons from Le Triomphant about being responsible.<br>
Saratoga：<br>
I know, I know.<br>
Lexington：<br>
Well then, Commander, Le Triomphant, thank you both for your hard work. Good luck with those patrols!<br>
Saratoga：<br>
Bye bye! Oh, by the way, Lex, did you hear the rumors?<br>
Le Triomphant：<br>
Being responsible...<br>
<br>
...<br>
Le Triomphant seemed a little down...<br>
Le Triomphant：<br>
H-huh? Is something stuck on my face...?<br>
<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项1：Pat her gently on the head</span>'''''<br>
Le Triomphant：<br>
C-Commander...<br>
Le Triomphant smiled at me, but she somehow seemed distant and lonely.<br>

<br>
Chapter 5 - Listen to Your Heart<br>
I asked Le Triomphant what was bothering her while we walked around port.<br>
Le Triomphant：<br>
Commander, did you know that I'm the youngest sister of the Le Fantasque class?<br>
Yes, as you might surmise, I have several other older sisters...<br>
Before that war, we were all very close. I thought that things would be able to stay like that forever.<br>
Even when war broke out, I had nothing to fear as long as my sisters were with me...<br>
But reality was much harsher.<br>
There were a lot of complicated circumstances; everyone started to go their separate ways...<br>
Even though we're all aiming for the same goal, why did we end up having to fight each other...?<br>
<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项1：You'll be able to overcome your differences one day.</span>'''''<br>
Le Triomphant：<br>
Since coming here, I've managed to regain some of my hope thanks to you, Commander.<br>
Somewhere deep in my heart, this has always been bothering me...<br>
Even if we're all in the same fleet, would it really be so easy for things to return to how they used to be...?<br>
<br>
Le Triomphant's expression was full of sorrow.<br>
Le Triomphant：<br>
That's why when I saw Erebus and Terror, Lexington and Saratoga, I felt a little jealous...<br>
I hope that one day, I'll be able to return to those days where I can get along with my sisters again...<br>
But as things are right now, even if I was to meet them, I don't know what I should do...<br>
Commander, can you tell me what I'm supposed to do?<br>
<br>
Her sorrowful voice quivered with helplessness.<br>

Port - Commander's Office<br>
Forbin：<br>
Commander, I've come to deliver the resources that came in earlier!<br>
You're here too, Le Triomphant? Congratulations on your secretaryship!<br>
Le Triomphant：<br>
Ehehe. It's no big deal~<br>
<br>
Good timing. I'd like to ask you something about you and Le Mars.<br>
Forbin：<br>
About me and Le Mars?<br>
Le Triomphant：<br>
C-Commander?!<br>
<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项1：Explain the situation to Forbin</span>'''''<br>
Forbin：<br>
I had no idea... Le Triomphant is always brimming with confidence, even with so many things to worry about...<br>
If you ask me though... I'd say that she's overthinking things.<br>
Le Triomphant：<br>
Huh...?<br>
Le Mars：<br>
I heard Forbin calling for me! Huh? Le Triomphant too?<br>
Le Triomphant：<br>
Good day, Miss Le Mars.<br>
Forbin：<br>
Um, so it's like this... Commander is asking us for advice about when your sister ship is in an opposing faction.<br>
Le Mars：<br>
That's the issue, huh? Well, it's perfectly normal for siblings to fight, right?<br>
Le Triomphant：<br>
Really?<br>
Forbin：<br>
Le Mars is a blockhead, so that's the only method you can use to get to her anyway.<br>
I've actually tried it a bunch of times in combat. Using practice equipment, anyway.<br>
Le Mars：<br>
Anyway, all you gotta do is hit 'em with your feelings! Use words for stuff that can be conveyed with words. Use your fists for all the stuff that can't!<br>
Forbin：<br>
Sigh... that's why you're a blockhead...<br>
Le Mars：<br>
Who the heck are you callin' a blockhead?<br>
Le Triomphant：<br>
W-well, I'm glad you two get along... but I wonder if I can have this kind of relationship with my sisters...<br>
Forbin：<br>
You have a point. There's no guarantee with this kind of stuff, but don't you think it's better to express yourself than to keep your emotions bottled up?<br>
They're your sister ships after all. I'm sure they'll understand if you talk to them. Someone as smart as you can figure that out, right?<br>
Le Triomphant：<br>
My sister ships...<br>
Miss Forbin, Miss Le Mars, thank you both for your advice. I think I understand a bit better.<br>
<br>
It seemed like Le Triomphant's heart was finally beginning to thaw.<br>

Chapter 7 - Le Triomphant of Iris Libre<br>
After seeing off Forbin and Le Mars...<br>
Le Triomphant：<br>
Commander, I think... I understand what I have to do now.<br>
Up until now, I've always been trapped by my memories of the past, afraid of opening old wounds.<br>
I've decided that I won't run from my past anymore...<br>
But I can't do that as I am now.<br>
<br>
Le Triomphant made a fist, gentle but filled with determination.<br>
Le Triomphant：<br>
As Forbin said, I can't just keep my emotions bottled up.<br>
No matter what it takes, I have to make my sisters understand my feelings.<br>
Perhaps my sisters would get angry at me, but even then...<br>
I... I want to get along with my sisters again!<br>
<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项1：Offer Le Triomphant your support</span>'''''<br>
Le Triomphant：<br>
Thank you so much, Commander. This is only possible because of you...<br>
I won't get jealous of others anymore... because surely, I'll be able to have fun with my own sisters again.<br>
From now on, I won't run away from what needs to be done. As my name suggests, I'll be triumphant in reforging my relationship with my sisters!<br>
<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项1：You are still cute, though, even if you do decide to run.</span>'''''<br>
<br>
Upon hearing my words, Le Triomphant turned a deep shade of red.<br>
Le Triomphant：<br>
Wh-what are you saying? C-calling me c-cute...<br>
<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项1：It's true. You're really cute.</span>'''''<br>
Le Triomphant：<br>
Uuu... F-fine... Then, the next time I'm worried about something, you'd better be there to hear me out...<br>
Since you're the person I trust the most, you won't mind if I rely on you a bit more, right?<br>
