Song of Nevada<br>
<br>
1 Gettin' Home on Time<br>
I arrived at the office on a crisp morning.<br>
I can still feel the exhaustion of yesterday's late-night work weighing on me.<br>
And yet, there is still so much more work to get through...<br>
Just as the pile of paperwork begins to bring my mood down, I hear a knock at the door.<br>
Before I can respond, the door flies open and a shipgirl confidently saunters right in.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Nevada：</span><br>
Howdy there, young'un. Mighty fine day, ain't it?<br>
<br>
It was the ever-energetic Nevada, who I had recently appointed as my secretary.<br>
<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项1："Hi there, Nevada."</span>'''''<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项2："Urgh, I'm still so tired..."</span>'''''<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Nevada：</span><br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项1）</span>'''''That's the spirit. Let's work our butts off today!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Nevada：</span><br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项2）</span>'''''What's the matter, young'un? It's barely mornin', and you're pooped already? C'mon, buck up!<br>
<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项2）</span>'''''Nevada had worked late into the night alongside me, but she still seems to be astonishingly energetic.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Nevada：</span><br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项2）</span>'''''Hahaha! I won't lose to those younger ships. You too, young'un - get a hold o' yourself!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Nevada：</span><br>
Now, on to today's paperwork... Hoowee, it's another biggun.<br>
I reckon I shoulda brought this up before, but have you thought about makin' a secretary squad?<br>
It oughta be easier for all of us if we divvy up the work.<br>
You wouldn't have to whip yourself to exhaustion all the time. Heck, ya might even finish early once in a while. Imagine: paid vacation!<br>
<br>
"A secretary... squad?"<br>
<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项1："That might be a good idea."</span>'''''<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项2："Too many cooks might spoil the broth."</span>'''''<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Nevada：</span><br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项1）</span>'''''Ain't it? Hire more secretaries, and the office will be nice and lively, too.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Nevada：</span><br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项2）</span>'''''You've got a point there, but we have plenty o' good talent around this port here. Find the right ones, and we'll be good to go in no time!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Nevada：</span><br>
But, I reckon that can wait. For today, all we've got is each other.<br>
Pass me whatever paperwork you want. No need to be shy about it!<br>
<br>
Slowly but surely, the pile of paperwork on my desk shrunk.<br>
Watching Nevada power through the work filled me with the willpower to press on.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Nevada：</span><br>
Say... Now that I'm your secretary, should I call you Commander instead of young'un?<br>
<br>
"There's no rule that says you have to, but I am the Commander, after all..."<br>
"Still, I want to let everyone's individual personality shine."<br>
"Call me 'Commander' in formal settings, but anywhere else, you can call me whatever you feel like."<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Nevada：</span><br>
Hahaha! Now that's the young'un I put my trust in!<br>
Just a little more work today! Let's buck up and hop to it! We might just get home on time for once!<br>

2 Quick Draw in the Twilight<br>
A formal secretary squad was still a question for the future, but for now, we brought in Oklahoma to help with secretary work.<br>
"Today's the third day in a row that I get to leave on time, huh?"<br>
Nevada and Oklahoma left ahead of me. After tidying up, I leave the office as well.<br>
The port is bathed in the evening's golden light.<br>
How long has it been since I'd last gotten to enjoy gazing at this scenery? Too long.<br>
While I was immersed in these emotions, I hear the rumbling of a machine from the exercise area.<br>
The first thing that catches my eye is Nevada's figure, dyed by the golden light of the setting sun.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Nevada：</span><br>
Howdy, young'un. Came for a li'l trainin'?<br>
<br>
"Not quite... A Commander using the ships' training ground is a little too crazy, even for me."<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Nevada：</span><br>
Haha! Don't be silly.<br>
There's all kinds of trainin' out there. I reckon even you can handle firearm training, young'un.<br>
<br>
Nevada showed me the gun in her hand.<br>
<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项1："What is this gun?"</span>'''''<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Nevada：</span><br>
Don't you worry. It ain't rigging - it's just an ordinary gun.<br>
More a... personal hobby, than for use on the high seas.<br>
<br>
"I didn't even know you could use this here."<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Nevada：</span><br>
Course I can! Y'know, the other girls love it. Lots of 'em join in when they've got time to spare.<br>
I ain't surprised you don't know, given how busy you are.<br>
<br>
"Maybe so. I don't usually pay this place much mind."<br>
"How do you have so much energy, Nevada? Is there a trick to it?"<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Nevada：</span><br>
A trick? I dunno if I'd call it that, but have you tried takin' regular breaks?<br>
Let loose when ya can. For example... like this!<br>
<br>
*gasp*<br>
Nevada fired her revolver with lightning speed. All six rounds struck the target in almost the exact same place at the exact same time.<br>
She then twirled the gun around her finger once and ended the display by blowing smoke away from the barrel.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Nevada：</span><br>
How'd ya like it? Not bad, eh?<br>
<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项1："You're like a cowboy!"</span>'''''<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Nevada：</span><br>
A cowboy, huh? Hahaha! Funny comparison, there!<br>
Shootin' my gun in the twilight... Reckon that does sound like a Western cowboy flick.<br>
Still... A cowboy, huh?<br>
You interested in horses, young'un?<br>
<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项1："...Horses?"</span>'''''<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项2："Absolutely!"</span>'''''<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Nevada：</span><br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项1）</span>'''''You heard me. Horses!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Nevada：</span><br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项2）</span>'''''Good to hear it. I didn't peg you as the sorta fella to get so excited over 'em, though.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Nevada：</span><br>
Cowboys are all about six shooters and broncs!<br>
Work's movin' along smoothly these days. Why don't you try and take a vacation?<br>
<br>
"I'm having trouble following the conversation here..."<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Nevada：</span><br>
Yeehaw! No answer means okay, I say!<br>
I'll get things ready in a jiffy! Don't you worry your pretty little head; it's a secretary's job to get your schedule straight, young'un!<br>
Leave the rest to me. Just you wait!<br>

3 Packin' Up<br>
After work the next day, Nevada and I went to the store.<br>
"You keep saying we're getting ready to leave, but what exactly do you have planned?"<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Nevada：</span><br>
Akashi! Akashi you around?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Akashi：</span><br>
I-I'm right here, nya! Oh? Commander and Nevada, nya?<br>
Are you here to pick up the things you ordered yesterday, nya?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Nevada：</span><br>
You bet. Didja manage to wrangle all the things in my list?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Akashi：</span><br>
Every last item, nya! I left them all in the back, nya.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Nevada：</span><br>
Shoot, you're a daisy! Much obliged!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Akashi：</span><br>
Hold your praise, nya. The key to fruitful business is good service, nya.<br>
<br>
Helmets, kneepads, gloves, scarves...<br>
As I watched Nevada check each and every item, my curiosity grew. What was all of this equipment for?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Nevada：</span><br>
You look real interested. Haha, why bother hidin' it? We're gonna go ridin' horses!<br>
<br>
"R-riding?"<br>
I'd guessed as much based on what she'd ordered, but actually hearing it came as a shock.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Akashi：</span><br>
That explains it, nya. Riding with the Commander... Saddles weren't on the list, nya. Is this enough, nya?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Nevada：</span><br>
Findin' a comfy saddle is real tough. If you pick one that don't fit, ya might get hurt.<br>
I'll let the Commander use my saddle. It's broken in, so it oughta be way softer and comfier than any new one.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Akashi：</span><br>
That's fine, nya... It's just a shame I won't get to show off the saddle I found, nya.<br>
<br>
"What was that at the end? I didn't hear."<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Akashi：</span><br>
N-Nothing, nya! If you're satisfied with your purchase, then I'll go organize our stock, nya!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Nevada：</span><br>
Yeah, much obliged! Don't just stand there, young'un. Pick a scarf!<br>
<br>
Nevada shows me two scarves.<br>
<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项1："I choose the brown scarf."</span>'''''<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项2："I'll go with the blue scarf."</span>'''''<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Nevada：</span><br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项1）</span>'''''You and I have the same taste. Good on ya, young'un.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Nevada：</span><br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项2）</span>'''''You want this one? Awright, then I'll take the brown.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Nevada：</span><br>
Now, let's mosey on home and get some shut-eye. Tomorrow, we ride early.<br>
<br>
"Huh? Does that mean I'm taking tomorrow off? There's still work—"<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Nevada：</span><br>
Settle down, now. I've got all that straightened out. Oklahoma and the others can handle it for two or three days.<br>
<br>
"What if something requires my presence? Or if there's an emergency..."<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Nevada：</span><br>
It'll be the same as any other day off. We can burn that bridge when we get to it!<br>
Y'know, they've got this spiffy new thing they call "remote work." I reckon you can do that if there's any real emergency.<br>
You've been workin' your butt off, so it's high time you empty your mind and have a rootin'-tootin' good time!<br>
<br>
As such, I am forced to take a vacation with Nevada.<br>

<br>
4 Off to a Cowboy Vacation!<br>
We traveled together to the badlands.<br>
When I look around, I see parched grass growing along the riverside. Shrubs dot the landscape, but they all appear yellow and withered.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Nevada：</span><br>
You look disappointed, young'un.<br>
<br>
"I always thought you rode horses in meadows and the like."<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Nevada：</span><br>
Hahaha! Y'ain't wrong, but that ain't how cowboys work.<br>
Besides, there's a reason I picked this spot.<br>
The ground here is dryer and harder than in rainy places. It's a right perfect place for a horse.<br>
<br>
"Huh... You sure know a lot about horseback riding, Nevada."<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Nevada：</span><br>
That's another hobby of mine. Along with shootin', of course.<br>
C'mon. They don't call me a cowboy for nothin'!<br>
<br>
Nevada's refined handiwork as she prepared the horse and riding gear was a real sight to see.<br>
"But aren't the horses the most important part? As far as I can see, you've only brought one."<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Nevada：</span><br>
Ridin' ain't easy enough for a beginner to do alone.<br>
You'll ride with me 'til you're used to it.<br>
<br>
With a practiced motion, Nevada straddles the horse and reaches a hand out to me.<br>
<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项1：Sit in front of Nevada.</span>'''''<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项2：Sit behind Nevada.</span>'''''<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Nevada：</span><br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项1）</span>'''''Awright. Lean back against me and hold those reins tight so you don't fall! Let's ride!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Nevada：</span><br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项2）</span>'''''Awright. Hold on to my waist and keep those legs firmly on the horse! Let's ride!<br>
<br>
Nevada was careful not to go too fast, so I was able to relax and enjoy both the gentle wind and the scenery.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Nevada：</span><br>
How d'ya like it, young'un? Feel good? We're gonna really scoot now, so hold on tight!<br>
Yeehaw!<br>
<br>
The clip-clops of the horse's hooves grow in frequency, and the scenery around us accelerates.<br>
Nevada's horse practically seems like an extension of her own body.<br>
<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项1："Aren't we going a little too fast?"</span>'''''<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项2："The wind feels great."</span>'''''<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Nevada：</span><br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项1）</span>'''''Think so? This is pretty comfy for me.<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项1）</span>'''''But if you wanna sightsee, I reckon I oughta slow things down a bit.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Nevada：</span><br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项2）</span>'''''Damn straight, young'un! That's the spice of life for a cowboy ridin' through the badlands!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Nevada：</span><br>
Stay focused, now! Our ride has only just begun!<br>

<br>
5 Break Time for the Bronco Buster<br>
Moved by the sight of the badlands lit by the golden evening light, I let out an emotional sigh.<br>
My body, weary and aching from all the desk work, has difficulty adjusting to the bumpy horseback ride. However, that doesn't stop the joy of being surrounded by nature from resounding within me.<br>
I lean on the balcony handrail next to Nevada and savor the sensation of the wind and the scent of dry grass emanating from the badlands.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Nevada：</span><br>
How'd you like your first ride, young'un?<br>
<br>
"It's not bad... But honestly, it might've been a little too rough for my liking."<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Nevada：</span><br>
Hahaha! Like ridin' a boat, ya just have to get used to it over time. Experience is the only way to grow and overcome it.<br>
By the way, do you know where the name cowboy comes from?<br>
<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项1："They herded cows."</span>'''''<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项2："I have no idea."</span>'''''<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Nevada：</span><br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项1）</span>'''''Correct! You got a good head on those shoulders, Commander.<br>
<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项2）</span>'''''"It's strange, if you really think about it. You're a cowboy, but you ride horses?"<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项2）</span>'''''"Why not call them horseboys?"<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Nevada：</span><br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项2）</span>'''''Well, 'tain't about what ya ride. Cowboys herded cows, so they called 'em cowboys.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Nevada：</span><br>
Okay. Wanna visit the stable with me?<br>
Ya gotta get to know broncs if you wanna ride broncs, right?<br>
<br>
I follow Nevada to the stable. The best way to get along with these horses would be...<br>
<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项1："Let's give them carrots."</span>'''''<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项2："How about we groom their manes?"</span>'''''<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项3："I say we should bathe them."</span>'''''<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Nevada：</span><br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项1）</span>'''''Now there's a good idea. They can choke if you give it to 'em as-is, though, so I suggest cutting the carrots.<br>
<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项1）</span>'''''Nevada cuts the carrots, and I give the pieces to a horse.<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项1）</span>'''''It eats them happily. Before I knew it, it has cleaned them out of my palm.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Nevada：</span><br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项1）</span>'''''She loves ya. Keep it up!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Nevada：</span><br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项2）</span>'''''Brushin' their manes is a good way to make horses like ya. Be gentle, now. Easy does it... Pretend you're brushin' a cute li'l lady's hair.<br>
<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项2）</span>'''''Nevada gives me a brush, which I use to slowly brush along the horse's mane.<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项2）</span>'''''The horse snorts happily.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Nevada：</span><br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项2）</span>'''''Good work! Horses love it when you brush their manes. Keep it up!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Nevada：</span><br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项3）</span>'''''That sounds a little tough, but I'm always in for a laugh.<br>
<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项3）</span>'''''I use the methods Nevada taught me to handle the horse and wash its body and hooves.<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项3）</span>'''''The horse stamps unhappily a few times, but luckily, it is patient enough to let me wash it without any violence.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Nevada：</span><br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项3）</span>'''''The horses ain't real fans of it, but when it's all over, I wager you'll be closer than ever.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Nevada：</span><br>
Phew... I reckon that oughta do it.<br>
How's about you try ridin' alone now, young'un? Don't worry; I'll be right there. Once ya get the hang of it, that's where the fun really begins!<br>

6 Twilight in the Outback<br>
When I wake up and check the time the following day, I see that it's already past noon.<br>
The night before, I'd done some miscellaneous port administration work before throwing myself into bed. Seems like I slept in pretty late.<br>
<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项1："So much for my alarm..."</span>'''''<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Nevada：</span><br>
I saw you weren't wakin' up, so I turned it off for ya. It's your vacation, dang it! I gotta let ya rest.<br>
Whoops, sorry. I didn't just barge in, promise. You didn't answer when I knocked, so I got worried and came to check on ya.<br>
Since your alarm was goin' off nonstop, and you were snoozin' so peacefully... Well, I felt a little bad wakin' ya up.<br>
So? Did ya sleep good?<br>
<br>
"My body is heavy, but my mind does feel really refreshed."<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Nevada：</span><br>
Yeah? They say exercise cures the body and mind.<br>
If your mind is refreshed, then my plan went off without a hitch. Hahaha!<br>
<br>
"Is that the whole reason you brought me out here?"<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Nevada：</span><br>
Yeah! Besides, the air's real nice, and you get the lovely company of adorable horses. Two birds with one stone, I reckon. And ya seem relaxed.<br>
I made ya breakfast. Or lunch by now, I guess. After you chow down, I'll take ya somewhere nice.<br>
On horseback, 'course!<br>
<br>
Orange-crimson light falls upon two horses coursing through the badlands.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Nevada：</span><br>
Behold! Twilight in the outback. Can't see sights like this back at port, can ya?<br>
<br>
The red sun is just beginning to dip into the horizon.<br>
It glistens upon the grand river stretching into the distance, making the water's surface shine like the most beautiful of jewels.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Nevada：</span><br>
Ridin' together throughout the wastes at sunset...<br>
<br>
Nevada pulls the gun from her hip and fires a blank toward the sun.<br>
As if in response, the light shining upon her seems to turn even redder and more beautiful.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Nevada：</span><br>
How do you feel, young'un? There's somethin' about a ride like this once in a while, right?<br>
<br>
"You're totally right, Nevada. Riding around in the wilderness drained all of my mental fatigue in no time."<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Nevada：</span><br>
Heh. I like that look on your face.<br>
Y'know what they say: time flies when you're havin' fun. It's about time we mosey on home.<br>
Let me know if you ever fancy comin' back.<br>
<br>
I thanked Nevada as we turned home, all the while anticipating my next vacation.<br>

7 The Stuff of... Legends?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Charles Ausburne：</span><br>
Nevada, tell us more about your cowboy adventures with the Commander!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Nevada：</span><br>
*sigh* Didn't I just tell you that story?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Charles Ausburne：</span><br>
Maybe, but you haven't covered EVERYTHING!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Bristol：</span><br>
Yeah, yeah! Tell us about the treasure you found, or the scary gangs you trounced!<br>
Or how you wrestled a hippopotamus in the river and rode off into the sunset with a herd of horses!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Nevada：</span><br>
Fiiine, fine. I'll tell ya, so sit your butts down...<br>
<br>
"Why do I not remember any of this happening?"<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Nevada：</span><br>
Look, young'un. You gotta stretch these kinds of stories with little exaggerations. That's what adventures are made of.<br>
Rumors about you are gonna spread far and wide through the port. They'll become legends, and then...<br>
All the details of what actually happened there will be our own little secret. Now that's some spicy drama, ain't it, partner?<br>
What do ya say?<br>
<br>
"Hide the truth with exaggerations? I guess that's...kind of logical?"<br>
She isn't wrong. By exaggerating certain parts of stories, you can make everyday occurrences a bit more colorful, a bit more exciting.<br>
Besides, work has just calmed down for the moment. Why not listen in on "our" heroic adventures for a while?<br>
