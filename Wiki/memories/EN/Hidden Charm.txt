1 A Girl Without a History<br>
Port - Office<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Suruga：</span><br>
Good morning, Commander.<br>
I'm Suruga. Starting today, I will serve the role of your secretary.<br>
<br>
Suruga entered my office and gave a brief introduction. My first impressions were that she's quite dignified, but also standoffish.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Suruga：</span><br>
...<br>
<br>
I felt her watchful gaze analyzing me. It was a little... unnerving.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Suruga：</span><br>
If you don't mind... I'd like to ask a question right off the bat.<br>
<br>
"Sure. What are you wondering?"<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Suruga：</span><br>
Why'd you appoint me as your secretary? Why me of all people?<br>
<br>
That was a complicated question. I debated whether or not to answer it...<br>
<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项1："No reason in particular."</span>'''''<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项2：Keep quiet for now</span>'''''<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Suruga：</span><br>
*sigh*... Really? Is this how you do things around here?<br>
<br>
She breathed a deep sigh which took me by surprise. I worried if I'd offended her, and wondered what I should've said instead.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Suruga：</span><br>
See, what you SHOULD have said is...<br>
<br>
She continued before I could say anything, phrasing it like she'd read my mind. I withheld comment as she took a deep breath, preparing to elaborate.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Suruga：</span><br>
...<br>
(Ugh! It's so obvious why I was picked for this job! "Because the commander knows you," you might think, and you'd be totally wrong! The answer is: blueprint ship bias! And that's despite the fact I'm nowhere near the level of a PR, let alone a DR!)<br>
(I never even asked for this position! It makes me stick out like a lit Christmas tree at night! All I want is to quietly do my job and go unnoticed! Is that so much to ask for?! God, I'm so close to having a nervous breakdown right here and now...)<br>
...On second thought, never mind I said anything.<br>
<br>
A few seconds passed without a word from Suruga, and yet somehow, I had this feeling like she'd just roasted me to a crisp.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Suruga：</span><br>
Let's get back on track. What's on the agenda today?<br>
<br>
Her tone of voice changed noticeably. I took it to mean she'd had a change of heart.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Suruga：</span><br>
I can perform any task you need done. Within reason.<br>
<br>
She spoke with a sense of great gravitas that meant to reassure me, but at the same time, I sensed there may be some workplace friction between me and her before long.<br>

2 What's on Suruga's Mind<br>
Port - Office<br>
Work was progressing smoothly, in no small part thanks to Suruga.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Suruga：</span><br>
Let's see...<br>
Hmm... Hm.<br>
<br>
Every now and then she'd mutter a few words to herself, but beyond that, she did her job in total silence. In that regard, there was nothing to complain about.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Suruga：</span><br>
...<br>
<br>
However, not everything was perfect. The mood in the room was just as tense as when we started. I didn't know what was going through her mind.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Suruga：</span><br>
I've completed the task you assigned me, Commander.<br>
<br>
"Good to hear. You did a great job."<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Suruga：</span><br>
What's next? I can see there's a lot of work on the back burner. Shall I take care of some of it?<br>
<br>
"It's all right. You don't need to concern yourself with these particular tasks."<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Suruga：</span><br>
Uh-huh. I see... Do I take that to mean you're reluctant to assign me any important work?<br>
<br>
That wasn't at all how I meant it. There was some hostility in her tone, and her question put me on the spot.<br>
I answered not with words, but with a nervous gaze, hoping she'd understand.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Suruga：</span><br>
(Oh no... Way to go, Suruga. You couldn't have made that more passive-aggressive even if you tried.)<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">....：</span><br>
That wasn't at all how I meant it. There was some hostility in her tone, and her question put me on the spot.<br>
<br>
(Just from looking at her, all signs point towards me having offended her in some way.)<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Suruga：</span><br>
(I'll bet the commander's furious with me... Which is a normal reaction to that attitude I just put on...)<br>
(If it's only going to get worse from here, it's time to reconsider the whole thing...)<br>
<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项1："Do you want to resign?"</span>'''''<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Suruga：</span><br>
Maybe I should resign as– Wait, what?!<br>
<br>
Strangely enough, we both got the same idea.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Suruga：</span><br>
(Actually... Resigning would be a terrible idea.)<br>
(I'd be teased to no end if people found out I quit only hours after becoming secretary...)<br>
<br>
In the end, I decided against discharging Suruga. I reasoned that we just needed time to get to know each other better.<br>
It seemed to me she felt the same way. And so, we both agreed to do our best to get on amicable terms.<br>

3 Not Standing Out is Hard<br>
Port - Shoreline path<br>
Suruga continued serving as my secretary, even if we had our awkward moments together.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Suruga：</span><br>
...<br>
<br>
We were heading to the exercise area that day, passing by a fair few familiar faces along the way.<br>
That's when a realization hit me. Neither of us were saying a word to each other, and simply stared at the ground as we walked.<br>
It was in stark contrast to the talkative people we passed by. We stuck out. And if there was one thing I knew about Suruga, it's that she hates sticking out.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Suruga：</span><br>
S-say, um... H-how about we talk about something?<br>
<br>
She sounded terribly nervous. It seemed I was right.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Suruga：</span><br>
Please, you choose the topic. It can be anything.<br>
<br>
That being the case, I decided to ask about her distaste for being in the spotlight.<br>
<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项1："Why are you so anxious about sticking out?"</span>'''''<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Suruga：</span><br>
Wow, um, talk about getting straight to the point!<br>
I suppose, all things considered, you deserve to know. Allow me to explain.<br>
<br>
I was keenly interested to hear her answer.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Suruga：</span><br>
It's easy to become socially distant when you're like me, but rest assured, I still have people I consider my friends.<br>
<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项1："I'm glad to hear that."</span>'''''<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项2："That's... surprising."</span>'''''<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Suruga：</span><br>
...I'm going to take that only the way you intended it.<br>
Anyway... Among my friends, one of them in particular just loves to be the center of attention.<br>
<br>
"And you think something bad's going to happen if you get more attention than she does? Is that about right?"<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Suruga：</span><br>
You're quick on the uptake, aren't you? That's the gist of it all. I'll give you the whole story sometime later.<br>
<br>
The next thing I knew, we'd arrived just outside the exercise area.<br>
Suruga was going to participate in today's battle. Looking at the lineup, it seemed her opponent was someone close to her.<br>

4 To Be a Kii<br>
Port - Exercise Area<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Amagi：</span><br>
To all who are joining us on this day: thank you for coming.<br>
<br>
After coughing a few times, one of the Sakura Empire's brightest minds – Amagi – addressed the crowd.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Amagi：</span><br>
Of course, that includes you, Commander. Your presence is greatly appreciated.<br>
<br>
I hadn't been invited just as a friendly gesture. There was an important role for me to fulfill.<br>
I was to serve as the referee for this naval exercise. It would be a friendly battle between Amagi's great apprentices, and other shipgirls connected by the threads of history.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Kii：</span><br>
Well, well! You came after all, Suruga. Congratulations on taking the first step!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Suruga：</span><br>
{{AF|Kii}}……<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Kii：</span><br>
Yeah, me again. Ready to get whooped again?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Suruga：</span><br>
You know, it's just like you to count your chickens before they've hatched.<br>
<br>
Tension was building. Kii and Suruga were about on par in terms of rigging specs, but it sounded like Kii had an advantage from the get-go.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Amagi：</span><br>
It's time to begin. Commander, if you would.<br>
<br>
After taking a look across the spectators, Kii, and Suruga, I gave the starting signal.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Kii：</span><br>
Let's give the audience what they came for! Say goodnight!<br>
<br>
Kii immediately sprung into action. She held nothing back, firing several volleys at Suruga in an effort to take her out quickly.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Suruga：</span><br>
You've used this strategy a million times already! Get new material!<br>
<br>
Suruga dodged the volleys while firing back with sharp remarks the likes of which I'd never heard from her before.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Kii：</span><br>
Whoa, what?! What's changed with you between now and last time, Suruga?<br>
<br>
Kii was taken aback, but kept firing even so. Despite Suruga's evasive maneuvers wearing away at her stamina, she now went on the offensive.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Suruga：</span><br>
(This time will be different! I'll win, I swear it!)<br>
<br>
Suruga's desire to win could be felt even from the spectator rows. Her heart was on fire.<br>
Of course, Kii burned with a similar desire, but Suruga's passion stood out particularly much.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Suruga：</span><br>
YOU'RE MIIIINE!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Kii：</span><br>
Hmph! Nice try!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Amagi：</span><br>
After much passionate fighting... It seems we have ourselves a victor.<br>

5 The Things We Tell Ourselves<br>
Port - Exercise Area<br>
It was clear-cut who had won. Suruga was my secretary, but I couldn't let that influence my judgment.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Kii：</span><br>
Ahahaha! Victory is mine!<br>
<br>
Kii lured Suruga closer with a series of feint shots, securing the victory by scoring a hit at point-blank range. Her strategy had been executed flawlessly.<br>
The crowd burst into applause, congratulating Kii on her result.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Suruga：</span><br>
Whew... That's that done with.<br>
<br>
Suruga, on the other hand, was indifferent about the whole thing. If anything, she sounded like she'd gotten done with a boring chore.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Kii：</span><br>
"Done with"? You sound like you weren't even trying to win!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Suruga：</span><br>
...And? So what?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Kii：</span><br>
And that's lame, that's what. It wouldn't kill you to give it 100% in a duel with me.<br>
Do that, and I'll be able to give it as much as 120%! We've still got time for a round two, y'know. C'mon. You had fun, and you know it.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Suruga：</span><br>
*sigh*... Would it kill YOU to show some basic consideration?<br>
I'm also working as the secretary now, remember?. I've got huge amounts of work to do today and tomorrow. I don't have the energy for a no-holds-barred duel.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Kii：</span><br>
Damn, girl, okay! Don't let me keep you then.<br>
<br>
This, however, wasn't true. Suruga's workload for the day and the next was nothing out of the ordinary. She was making excuses for herself.<br>
Maybe she was bitter over her defeat. I felt I had to say something to her.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Amagi：</span><br>
Please... It's best you don't.<br>
<br>
I rose from my seat, but Amagi stopped me and adviced against it.<br>
Not long after we returned to the office, Suruga's anxiety abruptly boiled over.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Suruga：</span><br>
Urgh... I gave it my all. I really did. But I still couldn't beat Kii...<br>
At least, if I'm destined to wallow in mediocrity forever then it's not my own fault... I'm just cursed, simple as that...<br>
<br>
Her sobbing grew little by little into a bawl, and then something completely unexpected happened.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Suruga：</span><br>
Plop! Ploop! Flissshhh!<br>
<br>
She blurted strange words in an even stranger voice. But strangest of all was the fact she grew a furry tail, and her horns morphed into big, fluffy ears.<br>
They looked like they belonged to... a raccoon.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Shimakaze：</span><br>
Oh dear, oh dear! Suruga has dropped her disguise and shown her true form! Commander, you must evacuate!<br>
<br>
Shimakaze burst into my office as if she'd predicted this turn of events. She took me by the hand and dragged me outside...<br>

6 The Weakness Kept Inside<br>
Port - Evening<br>
Shimakaze, being one of Suruga's friends, likely had an explanation for her transformation. I decided to ask her about it.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Shimakaze：</span><br>
She'd prefer it if you'd keep what you saw a secret.<br>
Suruga maintains a constant tough girl act, you see. She goes out of her way not to seem cute or delicate.<br>
<br>
And here I'd come to adore that cool side of her...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Suruga：</span><br>
Look at these horns, Shimakaze. What do you think?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Shimakaze：</span><br>
Wooow! I'm simply stunned!<br>
As in, stunned that you've managed to disguise your real ears beneath them. They look so... so different!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Suruga：</span><br>
"I'm simply stunned" would've been plenty for an answer, you know!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Shimakaze：</span><br>
Sorry. At any rate, rest assured, I think you look awesome with a capital A!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Suruga：</span><br>
Heheheh... I sure do! This new look will finally give me the confidence needed to truly excel!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Shimakaze：</span><br>
...And that's the story behind them. Sadly, they still weren't enough to take her to the absolute top.<br>
<br>
As a result, Suruga set her expectations lower and lower. She'd settle for 2nd place, then 3rd, and it only got worse.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Shimakaze：</span><br>
Kii holds some... quite strict beliefs. "Defeat comes from not trying hard enough. All losers do is make up excuses for it."<br>
She doesn't know Suruga in and out. The only reason she associates with her is for her looks...<br>
<br>
"Now I see the greater picture... There's only one thing I can do."<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Shimakaze：</span><br>
You're going to try to console her?<br>
<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项1："Yes."</span>'''''<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项2："That, and something more."</span>'''''<br>
<br>
There was Suruga, my secretary, and then there was Suruga, the Kii-class battleship.<br>
There was Suruga, brimming with valor in the exercise area... and Suruga, vulnerable and exposed.<br>
I learned something important that day. Suruga had two sides to her.<br>
When I returned to my office, Suruga had not only stopped sobbing, she'd seated herself at her desk and started working again.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Suruga：</span><br>
Oh. There you are, Commander. You were out for quite some time.<br>
<br>
She spoke casually and straight to the point, like nothing had happened before I left. It was a sly tactic, and seemed... a little like what a raccoon might do.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Suruga：</span><br>
If you have any work lying around, just let me at it. I could use something to clear my mind.<br>
<br>
Her eyes were still faintly red after weeping for so long. Instead of assigning her work, I decided to tell her something to raise her spirits.<br>
<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项1："Let's head out to sea tomorrow."</span>'''''<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Suruga：</span><br>
The sea?! But that's not on tomorrow's schedule?<br>
Unless... you mean in the after-hours, then I suppose that could be arranged...<br>

7 The Road to Improvement<br>
Port - Exercise Area<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Suruga：</span><br>
Pl-please! I've asked you not to touch my ears! Err, horns, I mean!<br>
<br>
After finishing our work for the day, I invited Suruga to participate in a mock battle using a mass-produced ship.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Suruga：</span><br>
...You'll show a preview of your steering skills before we begin? Are you that confident in them?<br>
Well, go ahead, I suppose. I'm not sure why you– Oh... OH!<br>
<br>
Suruga's jaw dropped – I had just performed a maneuver characteristic of Kii's fighting style. I'd spent the whole previous night practicing to learn how to imitate it.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Suruga：</span><br>
(You went out of your way to stage a mock battle against basically-Kii... just for me, Commander...?)<br>
<br>
With a hesitant gait, she seemed to come closer to me.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Suruga：</span><br>
Don't tell me you arranged this, hoping it would make me happy?<br>
<br>
Though she made it sound like she wasn't pleased, I could sense she was.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Suruga：</span><br>
(Crap... I can't hide how obviously overjoyed I am.)<br>
<br>
The tables had turned – now I could read HER mind, clear as day.<br>
"My goal with this whole endeavor is simple. I want to make you comfortable with being yourself, and not who you think others want you to be."<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Suruga：</span><br>
Are you trying to say you actually LIKE my raccoon features? Are you just into exotic things, or something...?<br>
<br>
"Your appearance is part of it, but it's not all."<br>
"More importantly, I can't bear to see you keep losing to Kii. This will help with that."<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Shimakaze：</span><br>
Aha! I see you've started! Are you having fun, Suruga?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Suruga：</span><br>
Sh-Shimakaze?! You're not taking part too, are you?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Shimakaze：</span><br>
Hm? No, not at all. I just completed a mission and I'm simply passing by to say hello. Isn't that right, Commander?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Suruga：</span><br>
(Wait a second... Did the commander get Shimakaze's aid to make this happen...?)<br>
<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项1：Suspiciously look the other way</span>'''''<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项2：Own up to it</span>'''''<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Suruga：</span><br>
You know... You really didn't need to go through all this effort just for me.<br>
<br>
The fact of the matter was that I wanted to. Suruga was precious to me, and it was only natural I'd want to convey that.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Suruga：</span><br>
I know that look! You're thinking of cheesy stuff right now, aren't you?! Ugh, it's giving me second-hand embarrassment!<br>
<br>
She turned red as an apple from ear to ear and fired a volley of training shells at my ship.<br>
As I maneuvered out of their path, I smiled and hoped for our now-amicable relationship to continue just like this.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Suruga：</span><br>
Oh no you don't!<br>
It's time we get serious! Come here and I'll show you what I'm really made of!<br>
