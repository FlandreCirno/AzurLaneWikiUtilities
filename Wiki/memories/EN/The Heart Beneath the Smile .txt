The Heart Beneath the Smile<br>
<br>
Chapter 1 - The Bright and Cheery Secretary Ship<br>
Port - Office<br>
Repulse takes up her post as secretary ship today.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Repulse：</span><br>
Commander, can I come in?<br>
<br>
There is a knock before the door flies open. In walks Repulse, with a cheerful smile on her face.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Repulse：</span><br>
I was surprised to hear you made me secretary ship, Commander.<br>
But since you chose me, I'll do everything I can to help with your work. Just leave it to me.<br>
<br>
Repulse has an impatient look on her face, like she can't wait to dive right into her secretary work.<br>
Let's give her something to do, since she's so eager.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Repulse：</span><br>
Yes! It's finally time to start being a real secretary ship! So, Commander, where should we start?<br>
<br>
I'll show her the mountain of files on the desk.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Repulse：</span><br>
Oh? What are all these papers...?<br>
<br>
We'll start with file management for now...<br>
<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项1：So begins your endless struggle！</span>'''''<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Repulse：</span><br>
Whaaaaaat?! Th-there's so much paperwork!<br>
I thought it would be something more physical. I always leave the brainier stuff to Renown. I'm not so good at it.<br>
<br>
Repulse's famous smile is now a troubled frown. Should we give her something else to do?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Repulse：</span><br>
Oh, but, Commander! I'm sure I can organize these for you!<br>
I may be no good at sitting around reading all day, but getting the files sorted will be a piece of cake!<br>
<br>
The moment she finishes speaking, Repulse's hands flash into action, tidying up the pile of paper.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Repulse：</span><br>
No time to waste! I'll get started at once.<br>
<br>
She has the right idea. It's better to sort through the pile before going over each document one by one.<br>
Seeing her work, I'm sure I made the right choice to appoint her secretary ship.<br>

<br>
Chapter 2 - The Sisters and the Commander<br>
Two days after Repulse became my secretary——<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Renown：</span><br>
Commander, I have the reports for the meeting this afternoon.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Repulse：</span><br>
Ooh, Renown!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Renown：</span><br>
Repulse, have you finished your secretarial duties?<br>
<br>
Renown asks, eyeing the mountain of papers (now neatly stacked) on the desk.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Repulse：</span><br>
Oh, don't get me wrong! It's just... I'm better at working with my hands than my brain...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Renown：</span><br>
Sorting paperwork is all well and good. But you must leave all the important decisions up to the Commander.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Repulse：</span><br>
Well... Yeah...<br>
<br>
Seeing Repulse's dejected face, Renown sits down at the desk and looks at the stack of files.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Renown：</span><br>
The Commander won't be able to handle all this work without help. I'll lend a hand.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Repulse：</span><br>
My very own big sister here to help me? Brilliant!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Renown：</span><br>
Just a bit. You'll still have to do the cleaning and sorting on your own, Repulse.<br>
Commander, these armaments are for distribution to the Royal Navy—<br>
But I did find some inaccuracies in the equipment maintenance documents... Like these here—<br>
<br>
With Renown's attention to detail, we efficiently cut a swath through the paperwork.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Repulse：</span><br>
......<br>
<br>
I look up and just happen to lock eyes with Repulse as she takes a break from cleaning to watch the two of us.<br>
When she realizes she's been seen, she quickly makes herself busy and gets back to work.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Repulse：</span><br>
Renown and the Commander work so well together. I just couldn't help myself.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Renown：</span><br>
Repulse, why don't we have you do at least a little clerical work, like a proper secretary ship?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Repulse：</span><br>
I'd certainly like to... But I'm not sure I could do it like you do.<br>
So I'll just stay out of your way. Wouldn't want to bother you doing such great work together! Enjoy yourselves! Hehe~<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Renown：</span><br>
Hm? You don't mean...?<br>
<br>
Repulse taps the mop in her hand in an effort to interrupt Renown's question.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Repulse：</span><br>
Right then, best focus on your work~<br>
My sister really is something, isn't she...?<br>
<br>
With a smile on her face, Repulse resumes cleaning.<br>
She maintains, at all times, a sunny disposition. But on the other hand, it is difficult to read what's going on behind that smile.<br>
What would it take to know her true thoughts?<br>

<br>
Chapter 3 - A "Sharp" Friend<br>
A few days after Repulse started working as my secretary——<br>
Port - Academy<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Vampire：</span><br>
Repulse? I didn't expect to see you faffing about here.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Repulse：</span><br>
Oh, Vampire! It's been so long!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Vampire：</span><br>
I've heard you're serving as the Commander's secretary! That must be stimulating.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Repulse：</span><br>
Oh? N-no, it's nothing like that! I'm just doing busy work around the office... is all...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Vampire：</span><br>
Oh? Why so quiet all of a sudden?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Repulse：</span><br>
N- no reason... I'm just wondering whether or not I've actually been any help to the Commander at all...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Vampire：</span><br>
Uh huh~<br>
<br>
Vampire narrows her eyes, moves around to the dispirited Repulse's side, and gives her a sudden, firm clap on the back.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Repulse：</span><br>
Hey! What was that for?!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Vampire：</span><br>
You were slouching. I'm helping you with your posture.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Repulse：</span><br>
O- oh! Well thanks for that!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Vampire：</span><br>
So, what happened exactly?<br>
<br>
......<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Vampire：</span><br>
Right then. Your sister helped you finish the work.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Repulse：</span><br>
Yes. I'm not very good at these sorts of things, so I asked Renown for a hand.<br>
But... While she and the Commander were working on the documents, I couldn't shake the feeling that I oughtn't bother them.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Vampire：</span><br>
Oughtn't?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Repulse：</span><br>
Yes... I don't know. I just thought I should leave them be. So I went about my own business as quietly as I could.<br>
That's why I'm here. I came to Akashi's by myself, so as not to bother them.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Vampire：</span><br>
Hm. What should I do with this?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Repulse：</span><br>
Huh? Which part?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Vampire：</span><br>
Every part! You don't see? If you keep this up, you will be the one to suffer.<br>
Honestly! I'm going home! You do what you must!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Repulse：</span><br>
Did she seem mad?<br>
<br>
Repulse tilts her head in confusion and gets up to leave, just as Vampire's voice floats in from the distance.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Vampire：</span><br>
Feel free to come to me with your troubles! All righty~?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Repulse：</span><br>
S-sure!<br>
<br>
Vampire's words set Repulse at ease.<br>

<br>
Chapter 4 - Hesitation<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Repulse：</span><br>
That should be everything... there. Alright, I ought to be getting back. Renown and the Commander must be waiting for me.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Atago：</span><br>
Oh my, isn't that Repulse?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Takao：</span><br>
Yes, indeed it is. I have heard that she is the current secretary ship.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Repulse：</span><br>
If it isn't Atago and Takao! What a coincidence, bumping into you here!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Atago：</span><br>
Ooh, are those treats for the Commander? Hehe, I'm jealous you're up to that level already~<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Repulse：</span><br>
Ahaha... I just grabbed them while I was out. And some of them are for my sister, actually.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Takao：</span><br>
Your sister... that's Renown? Of course, you must be preparing.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Repulse：</span><br>
Preparing... what?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Atago：</span><br>
For the exercises, of course. You Royal Navy girls will be facing off against the Sakura fleet, led by Takao and I.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Repulse：</span><br>
Oh, so... ah?!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Takao：</span><br>
The plans were submitted a few days ago. But it seems this is the first you're hearing of it? Could I be mistaken?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Repulse：</span><br>
Erm, err, no...<br>
Y-you know what? I remembered the Commander asked me to hurry back. Sorry, I'd better be going!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Atago：</span><br>
You'd better, hm?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Takao：</span><br>
A secretary's work is never done.<br>
<br>
In front of the office—<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Repulse：</span><br>
(How am I supposed to tell them I forgot about the exercises? I'm the secretary ship...)<br>
(I'm pretty sure I saw the plans... but Renown went over the details... Ugh...)<br>
<br>
She hears a voice from inside the office.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Renown：</span><br>
Commander, there are a few things I'd like to fix here. Repulse will have an easier time if we order them like so.<br>
No, here—<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Repulse：</span><br>
(Hm? What are they talking about?)<br>
<br>
Repulse carefully pushes the door open to find the two going over documents.<br>
Renown, to make it easier to point out issues in the documents, is seated right next to the Commander.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Renown：</span><br>
Repulse? What is it? Why were you——<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Repulse：</span><br>
Oh, sorry I didn't announce myself. I'm back...<br>
<br>
Repulse hesitates before walking into the office.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Repulse：</span><br>
(Renown is sharp as ever.)<br>
(Which makes me wonder: am I... am I really cut out to be the secretary ship...?)<br>
<br>
Careful not to disturb Renown's and the Commander's important work, Repulse silently places the things she was asked to get, as well as her gifts, on the desk.<br>

The Heart Beneath the Smile<br>
<br>
Chapter 5 - Chance Encounter<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Renown：</span><br>
Exercises with the Sakura Empire? Oh yes, I remember seeing those plans. However...<br>
<br>
Renown strokes her chin as she ponders Repulse, who has just come back from Akashi's shop.<br>
In a few days, the Royal Navy and the Sakura Empire will face off in war games. Renown and Repulse are both at the top of the list of Royal Navy participants.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Renown：</span><br>
Training for such an exercise will certainly have an impact on Repulse's secretary work.<br>
<br>
That's for sure. Things will get tight around here, but what else can we do—<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Repulse：</span><br>
It'll be fine♪<br>
<br>
Repulse suddenly throws out her arms, speaking in that bright, cheery tone of hers.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Repulse：</span><br>
Let me handle everyone's training. Then we won't have to lean on Renown. I'll pound 'em all flat myself!<br>
Like so: peeeewwwww——kabooom!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Renown：</span><br>
Are you sure? I think I should probably—<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Repulse：</span><br>
Of course! You just stay here and help the Commander! Leave the training to me!<br>
Sisters have to help each other like this. We each lighten the other's load and make both our lives better!<br>
<br>
Repulse has the right idea. This way, we'll be able to tackle the paperwork and the exercises at the same time.<br>
But even if we didn't, we could still get it done. So why would Repulse, my designated secretary, come up with this plan?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Repulse：</span><br>
Alright, let's get moving! I need to go scout out the waters where we're holding the exercise first.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Renown：</span><br>
Repulse! Oh, she's already gone...<br>
Sorry about that, Commander. She's not usually this stubborn.<br>
<br>
I did think she seemed a little off when she left the office.<br>
I wonder if she's doing this for Renown...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Renown：</span><br>
Ah!<br>
<br>
Renown's eyes grow wide with a sudden realization.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Renown：</span><br>
Commander! I've got it!<br>
Repulse must have found some equipment at Akashi's to guarantee our victory! That's why she's so confident!<br>
<br>
There's no way Renown has it right... I'll go to Repulse and figure out what's going on.<br>

The Heart Beneath the Smile<br>
<br>
Chapter 6 - Dazzling Smile<br>
I'll leave the work to Renown for now and head out to find Repulse. She said she was going out to the waters where we'll hold the war games, but she should still be in port.<br>
Sure enough, I find her standing on the pier, staring out at the water.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Repulse：</span><br>
Commander?<br>
<br>
The moment our eyes meet, Repluse's widen in shock, but she quickly reverts to her typical smile.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Repulse：</span><br>
Hey, Commander! How could you leave my sister to do all your work while you come out to play? Get back in there!<br>
<br>
Repulse seems like her old self. But knowing how abnormal she's been, I have to figure out exactly what's going on behind that smile.<br>
Not just for the fleet, or Renown, but for Repulse herself.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Repulse：</span><br>
Wait... what are you doing? Don't get too close to the water or you'll fall in! Ahahaha...<br>
<br>
I study her carefully.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Repulse：</span><br>
*Sigh*... I guess there's no use trying to hide it...<br>
What's wrong with you, Commander? I've been trying so hard to give you two your space, but here you are wasting your big chance.<br>
<br>
I touch Repulse's hand. She jumps, at first, before drooping her head and averting her eyes.<br>
Finally, she mumbles—<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Repulse：</span><br>
...As long as you two are happy. That's all I want.<br>
I'm sloppy, and I'm better with my hands than my brain... Even if I wanted to be like Renown, I probably wouldn't be able to...<br>
It's only natural my sister would be a better match for you...<br>
<br>
That's not true.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Repulse：</span><br>
I...<br>
<br>
I take out several pages, filled with text, and hand them to her.<br>
It's Renown's work, a special manual describing, in detail, how to be a secretary ship.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Repulse：</span><br>
You and Renown... made this for me?<br>
<br>
To be more precise: it was Renown's idea, with my input, built on your work.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Repulse：</span><br>
But... why though...?<br>
I'm the one who asked her to help. I mean, it's obvious she's much more able to assist you...<br>
<br>
Renown is much better at paperwork than you are. If we only cared about efficiency then yes, this manual would be a waste of time.<br>
But Renown can't do everything by herself.<br>
You're my secretary ship. And, more importantly, I want both you and Renown at my side.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Repulse：</span><br>
Oh... yes! Thank you, Commander! I'm so sorry to have troubled you!<br>
<br>
Repulse rubs her eyes and smiles a bright, genuine smile, more dazzling than any she has ever beamed before.<br>

<br>
Chapter 7 - Why I Chose You<br>
Port - Seaside<br>
When the war games came, Renown and Repulse performed spectacularly, handily defeating Atago and Takao's team.<br>
The duo earned high marks for their excellent showing and became the heroes of the day.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Repulse：</span><br>
Commander!<br>
<br>
I start to turn to see who's calling me, but Repulse latches onto my arm before I complete the maneuver.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Repulse：</span><br>
Hehe~♪ Commander, did you see us out there? What did you think? Jolly brilliant, no?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Renown：</span><br>
Calm yourself, Repulse. You're cutting off bloodflow to the Commander's arm.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Repulse：</span><br>
Huh?! N-no I'm not! I did the same thing back in our training and the Commander didn't mind. Right?<br>
<br>
True... I did go along with Repulse's training plan, and she was rather touchy-feely through all of it. That earned us some fiery gazes (for a number of reasons).<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Repulse：</span><br>
And Renown too! Like Vampire said!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Renown：</span><br>
......!<br>
<br>
At Repulse's prompting, Renown latches herself onto my free arm.<br>
Not knowing how to handle the situation, I suddenly stiffen up.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Renown：</span><br>
Indeed, a little skin-to-skin contact might well be important to sharing the joy of victory together.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Repulse：</span><br>
Hehe, we're making a Commander Sandwich♪<br>
<br>
Of course, there's no way Renown fully understands the situation she's been roped into...<br>
But I can't just throw her off me. My only option is to stay frozen here.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Repulse：</span><br>
Um, Commander... Can I ask... why me?<br>
Obviously, there are better choices for secretary ship... Like my sister here.<br>
<br>
The answer should be pretty clear.<br>
<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项1：I love that bright smile of yours!</span>'''''<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Repulse：</span><br>
——!!<br>
You can't just go blurting things out like that!<br>
The reason I'm so hyper all the time is... I'm trying to hide my faults.<br>
<br>
Honestly, I find it charming.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Repulse：</span><br>
Unngg... You sly fox...<br>
But the truth is you've made me very happy. Thank you, Commander. And you'll keep being good to me?<br>
<br>
Of course I will. I'll be spending many more days with her, on into the future. We've made sure of that.<br>
