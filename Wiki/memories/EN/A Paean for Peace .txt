A Paean for Peace<br>
<br>
Interim Head Maid<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Queen Elizabeth：</span><br>
Listen closely, Belfast and I will be leaving our posts today!<br>
During our absence, secretary duties will be passed to Newcastle!<br>
...There's nothing to worry about. Before Belfast became the head maid, Newcastle was responsible for coordinating the whole maid team.<br>
She might be rather boring, but... she shouldn't have any trouble supporting my servant.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Newcastle：</span><br>
Commander, is something amiss?<br>
I was pulled back to my senses by the sound of Newcastle's voice.<br>
This is the report of the previous joint exercise. Please look over it.<br>
Newcastle handed me a neatly-organized report.<br>
Commander, would you like anything to drink?<br>
Coffee? Roasted tea? Or perhaps pale ale?<br>
I would personally recommend the tea, but if you'd prefer something else, I'd be glad to prepare it.<br>
<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项1：Some tea sounds good.</span>'''''<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Newcastle：</span><br>
As you wish.<br>
<br>
Before I could blink, a tray with a tea set appeared upon my desk. The fragrance and warmth of the black tea wrapped around my senses.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Newcastle：</span><br>
Though I cannot hold a candle to Belfast, I formerly directed the Royal Maids. I will strive to serve you to the best of my abilities.<br>
<br>
From her demeanor as a maid to her experience with secretary work, there was nothing "former" about her.<br>
If Belfast could be described as "perfect," she would almost be better described as an excellence that transcended perfection.<br>

Perfection and Peace<br>
*knock* *knock*<br>
While working with Newcastle in the office, I heard a knock at the door.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Sheffield：</span><br>
Master, sincerest apologies for interrupting your work.<br>
Newcastle, there's something I would like your help with...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Newcastle：</span><br>
Is it about that warehouse?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Sheffield：</span><br>
Indeed.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Newcastle：</span><br>
It should be fine as long you clean it up afterwards. You should take care of the rest as you see fit.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Sheffield：</span><br>
Understood. Thank you.<br>
<br>
After exchanging a few pleasantries, Sheffield bowed politely and left the office.<br>
<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项1：What was that just now...?</span>'''''<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Newcastle：</span><br>
There's a slight issue with one of the old warehouses.<br>
Nobody had time to clean it, so Sheffield and I suggested to Belfast that we might take care of it.<br>
As for Belfast... Well, if the Head Maid was to handle it, nobody would be leaving until every single item in the warehouse were inventoried and listed.<br>
Even if all the Royal Maids were to help out, we'd struggle to complete a project of that scope.<br>
But with just Sheffield and me, the two of us would be enough to get things to a satisfactory state.<br>
<br>
That Belfast will settle for nothing less than perfection, anything else be damned.<br>
However, there are situations in which the pursuit of perfection is not the best way to get things done.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Newcastle：</span><br>
Oh, pardon me. I apologize for boring you with my personal matters.<br>
What I now pursue is not "perfection," but rather "peace."<br>

Lunch Break<br>
After we had our lunch, I instructed Newcastle to take an hour off. ...And she was gone in the blink of an eye.<br>
<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项1：Look for her</span>'''''<br>
<br>
Even though lunch wasn't quite over yet, I was a bit curious as to what she did during her spare time, so I decided to look for her.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Kent：</span><br>
Do you need something? You're looking for Newcastle?<br>
Erm... Sorry, but little old Kent hasn't seen anything...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Suffolk：</span><br>
Huh...? That cloud over there looks like... Gah! I wasn't daydreaming! I swear, I was working!<br>
...Umm, where did Newcastle go? I don't know either...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Sheffield：</span><br>
Haven't seen her... Sorry.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Edinburgh：</span><br>
Newcastle? If she's not with Sheffield, then she's probably somewhere reading by herself!<br>
Anyway, I don't know where she is... but she has been helping out with maid duties, so I'd guess maybe she's off doing something like that?<br>
Why not try looking in that empty lot behind the Royal Navy's dorms? That's where we usually dry out the laundry...<br>
<br>
Finally, I found her in the lot Edinburgh mentioned, hidden behind a white sheet that was fluttering in the wind.<br>
She was sitting on a stool next to the clothes rack with a half-opened book in her lap, drowsiness weighing upon her eyelids.<br>
As if she sensed me approaching, she raised her head serenely, a gentle smile forming upon her lips.<br>

<br>
Prank Time?<br>
Port - Office<br>
I was quietly working with Newcastle, who was seated on the couch.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Queen Elizabeth：</span><br>
She might be rather boring, but... she shouldn't have any trouble supporting my servant.<br>
<br>
Why did Queen Elizabeth describe her as "boring"...?<br>
<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项1：Steal a furtive glance at Newcastle</span>'''''<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项2：Don't do anything, like a wimp</span>'''''<br>
<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项1）</span>'''''Newcastle was silently flipping through operation reports.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Newcastle：</span><br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项1）</span>'''''Phew...<br>
<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项1）</span>'''''In the silence of the office, I could hear every gentle breath that escaped from her lips.<br>
...<br>
<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项1：Try playing a prank on her</span>'''''<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项2：Be mature about it</span>'''''<br>
<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项1）</span>'''''Terribly curious as to how she would react, I decided to play a little prank on Newcastle.<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项1）</span>'''''I tore a small piece off the eraser in my hand and flicked it in front of her.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Newcastle：</span><br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项1）</span>'''''...<br>
<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项1）</span>'''''Newcastle paused for a moment, but then resumed looking over her documents as if nothing even happened.<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项1）</span>'''''Unsatisfied, I decided to try again, but she shrugged off that attempt as well. I tried to get her attention in a variety of other ways, but failed each time.<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项1）</span>'''''Fine... Drastic times call for drastic measures...<br>
...<br>
<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项1：Pull out all the stops</span>'''''<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项2：Let's not do this after all...</span>'''''<br>
<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项1）</span>'''''I sneakily made my way behind the sofa and extended my fingers towards Newcastle's nape...<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项1）</span>'''''KABOOM!!<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项1）</span>'''''The sound of a loud explosion from the R&D Department tore through the office, sending me to my knees as my vision went black.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Newcastle：</span><br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项1）</span>'''''Commander, are you all right?<br>
<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项1）</span>'''''When I came to my senses, I found myself on top of Newcastle, my body pressed against hers.<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项1）</span>'''''I could feel a warm sensation pressing against my face...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Newcastle：</span><br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项1）</span>'''''Now, was this a happy little accident... or was this what you were aiming for all along?<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项1）</span>'''''You may stay there as long as you want... but you'll have to make up for it with overtime afterwards.<br>
<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项1）</span>'''''Her words were kind and mellow as always.<br>

<br>
Outing<br>
I headed to town with Newcastle and Sheffield to help them out with some shopping.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Sheffield：</span><br>
Now then, I have other business to attend to.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Newcastle：</span><br>
Thank you for your help, Sheffy.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Sheffield：</span><br>
The pleasure is mine. I'll leave Master in your capable hands.<br>
<br>
She left as if she were handing off an unruly child to the other parent...<br>
<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项1：Ask Newcastle about her plans</span>'''''<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Newcastle：</span><br>
Hmm, let's see. There are a few more stores I'd like to visit.<br>
The purpose of this trip was partly to buy some items that Akashi doesn't stock, and wouldn't be worth ordering.<br>
Since we're here, why don't we renew my insurance as well?<br>
Your... insurance?<br>
Indeed, my insurance.<br>
We may be ships, but our bodies and minds are human in many respects.<br>
For us, falling in battle is just another unfortunate part of life. In order to avoid leaving behind any regrets, we have to make sure to prepare beforehand.<br>
Travel insurance, disaster insurance, fire insurance, accident insurance... you never know when these things might come in handy.<br>
I have Gneisenau to thank for showing me this truth.<br>
<br>
Newcastle opened up the umbrella she usually carried on her as she continued to talk.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Newcastle：</span><br>
It's not just for me. I've also purchased insurance for Her Majesty, as well as the other Royal Maids.<br>
Newcastle gradually approached me, covering me underneath her umbrella.<br>
After all, my quiet and peaceful life is only possible thanks to all my precious friends who fight so hard to protect me...<br>

<br>
Sunset<br>
After making our rounds, we managed to purchase everything we came out for.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Newcastle：</span><br>
We still have some free time before we're supposed to meet up with Sheffield.<br>
Commander, why don't we rest for a bit?<br>
<br>
In accordance to Newcastle's suggestion, we sat down on a bench at the street corner.<br>
<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项1：Strike up a conversation with Newcastle</span>'''''<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Newcastle：</span><br>
I rarely get to shop with anyone but the Royal Maids.<br>
Ever since I accepted Her Majesty's appointment, I've pretty much done everything with the other maids. Even afterwards, when I returned to the Royal Islands, I was always with Glasgow...<br>
I'm sorry, I hope it doesn't sound like I'm brooding...<br>
Don't worry about me. I'll be able to adapt, no matter where I am.<br>
She pulled a book out of hammerspace and placed it upon her thighs.<br>
Whether in times of war or times of peace, whether I'm serving as a maid or as a secretary, I can be myself as long as I'm surrounded by those dear to me.<br>
This is what "peace" means to me. As for my dreams, those are but trivial matters.<br>
Her Majesty might disapprove of my viewpoint, but...<br>
She did once tell me, verbatim, "You should hold onto your dreams".<br>

A Paean for Peace<br>
<br>
Her Desires<br>
Queen Elizabeth said that Newcastle should hold onto her own dreams.<br>
However, she had already found the "peace" that made her life satisfying.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Newcastle：</span><br>
"As for my dreams, those are but trivial matters."<br>
<br>
But somehow...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Newcastle：</span><br>
Hmm? You'd like to... realize your dreams?<br>
If I can really be of assistance with that, I'd be glad to help you.<br>
Just let me know what I can do.<br>
Newcastle treasures her friends greatly, and they reciprocate that feeling.<br>
Thus, in order to protect her own "peace," she cannot disregard the "peace" of her friends.<br>
<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项1：I want to protect you.</span>'''''<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Newcastle：</span><br>
...<br>
Commander, are you just trying to protect your own "peace" just like me?<br>
You are someone who is precious to me, so it'd only make sense for you to want to protect me...<br>
<br>
Newcastle quietly closed her book.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Newcastle：</span><br>
Thank you very much, Commander.<br>
I feel like I better understand those words that Her Majesty imparted to me now.<br>
I heard something in her voice that was never there before - a hint of nervousness.<br>
She inched her body towards mine, her eyes fixed on my own...<br>
Singing the wordless paean of the peace which she desired from the bottom of her heart...<br>
Commander, would you treasure me?<br>
