Another Leader?<br>
<br>
Chapter 1 - An Unexpected Savior<br>
Port - ???<br>
As I opened my eyes, an unfamiliar scenery slowly began to spread before me...<br>
An ornate, imposing ceiling. A somewhat nostalgic fragrance. The opulence was reminiscent of the heart of the Royal Family...<br>
<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项1：Where am I...?</span>'''''<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">？？？：</span><br>
Heheh... Thou hast awoken at last?<br>
<br>
(This voice... Duke of York...?)<br>
(By the looks of things, I was taken to her room...?)<br>
<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项1：What's going on...?</span>'''''<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Duke of York：</span><br>
Prying into a lady's motives, how sinful thou art.<br>
It is hard to believe that someone in thy line of work would have no knowledge as to why I resorted to such... forceful measures.<br>
<br>
(She seemed to be serious, but what did she mean by "my line of work?" Had I done something wrong...?)<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Duke of York：</span><br>
Ahaha, thy tender expression, so full of innocence and confusion... how I wish to devour it so...<br>
Did thou truly think to escape from me by hiding behind "that" woman?<br>
<br>
(Not Wales, but "that" woman...? She can't be talking about...)<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">？？？：</span><br>
Commander, your deliverance has arrived.<br>
<br>
The voice that echoed across the halls belonged to that of the newly-appointed secretary, King George V.<br>
The thick aroma of Duke of York's incense, coiling around my senses like shackles, robbed me of my defenses as it pulled me deeper into a sweet darkness... Until suddenly, my savior cut through it in a flash of light.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Duke of York：</span><br>
Curses... why you bloody...!<br>
<br>
The normally imperturbable Duke of York seemed at a loss.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">King George V：</span><br>
Hmph. You can't hide anything from me, dear sister.<br>
Now, work is about to begin, so I'll have to bring the Commander along with me. If you have something to say, you're welcome to come to the office.<br>
With that, King George V swooped over and–<br>
<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项1：... Woah!?</span>'''''<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">King George V：</span><br>
Commander, hang on tight.<br>
<br>
... picked me up in a bridal carry, all the way back to the office.<br>
... What a colorful way to start off the day.<br>

Chapter 2 - An Affable Personality...?<br>
Port - Main Plaza<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Prince of Wales：</span><br>
In other words... you're asking me why Duke of York is so afraid of our sister?<br>
After what happened this morning, I went to see Prince of Wales for an explanation.<br>
Heh... Heheh... Hahahaha...!!<br>
The normally unexpressive Prince of Wales suddenly burst out into laughter.<br>
Let's see... One could say that King George V is that snake's nemesis.<br>
<br>
... Nemesis?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Prince of Wales：</span><br>
Unlike Duke of York, her power does not stem from "individual strength," but rather from "Noblesse Oblige," the charisma she holds over others. Ah, good timing — see for yourself, Commander.<br>
…………<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Washington：</span><br>
Sis, are you still hung up on that one time...?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">North Carolina：</span><br>
No way! As long as people continue to say that I have no personality, I won't give up!~<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Washington：</span><br>
Uh, Sis, that's what being hung up means...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">？？？：</span><br>
Precisely! If you'd like, I could offer some words of advice?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Washington：</span><br>
You're... King George V, from the Royal Navy!?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">King George V：</span><br>
Pardon me for eavesdropping on your conversation. Ms. North Carolina, you stated that you have no personality, but if I may be so bold, I would offer that your noble search for a personality is in fact your personality.<br>
In other words, you must first accept who you are before you can move forward.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">North Carolina：</span><br>
B-but... who would acknowledge a personality like that...?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">King George V：</span><br>
Me, of course!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">North Carolina：</span><br>
Huh?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">King George V：</span><br>
What's the issue? If you are looking for someone who accepts you for who you are, then I shall be that person.<br>
Therefore, you have nothing to worry about. Take pride in yourself and smile — don't you think that suits you better?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Washington：</span><br>
... ... (Seems to be desperately trying to suppress her laughter)<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">North Carolina：</span><br>
Hm... If you put it that way, that does make me feel a bit better! Thanks for hearing me out!<br>
<br>
... ... ...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Prince of Wales：</span><br>
See, Commander? That's just the type of person she is.<br>
Her presence is like the sun, bright and indiscriminate. Whether for better or for worse, she can't stop radiating charisma.<br>
For Duke of York, this is someone who she absolutely cannot handle.<br>
<br>
...For once, I seemed to understand what Prince of Wales was talking about.<br>

Chapter 3 - Her Majesty<br>
Port - Royal Navy Dorms<br>
One day, I suddenly heard Queen Elizabeth's distinctive voice as I passed by the Royal dorms.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">？？？：</span><br>
What's the meaning of this, George!?<br>
<br>
To say that the Queen was not very happy would be an understatement, and the target of her anger was... King George V?<br>
I had to see what was going on.<br>
When I entered the room, I saw Queen Elizabeth flushed and sweating profusely, trying to fan her tongue as she sat in front of a plate of supernaturally red food.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Queen Elizabeth：</span><br>
Wh-wh-what is this dish? You said it wouldn't be spicy at all and I believed you!<br>
Bel! Hurry and get me water, right now!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Belfast：</span><br>
As you wish.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">King George V：</span><br>
Your Majesty, this is authentic "mapo tofu" recipe I learned from the girls of the Dragon Empery.<br>
They told me that "you'll stop tasting the spiciness after your mouth goes numb." Perhaps I should have relayed that message, Your Majesty...<br>
<br>
Probably would have been a good idea...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Queen Elizabeth：</span><br>
Ughh... so spicy... but there does seem to be a nice flavour lingering in my mouth...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Belfast：</span><br>
Your Majesty, the water.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Queen Elizabeth：</span><br>
Queen Elizabeth gulped down the glass of water, and immediately afterwards, continued her showdown with the mapo tofu.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">King George V：</span><br>
Your Majesty, I've actually learned a variety of different dishes from the various camps here.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Queen Elizabeth：</span><br>
We'll talk about it later! Ack...! I can't feel my tongue!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">King George V：</span><br>
In that case, excuse me. Please enjoy your meal.<br>
Oh, what's this? Were you watching us?<br>
<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项1：Nod...</span>'''''<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">King George V：</span><br>
Ah, it is but a small hobby of mine. Have you heard of the saying, "an army marches on its stomach?"<br>
Having that said though, even if we're just eating to survive, it can't hurt to make things a bit tastier, right?<br>
<br>
At that time, I swore I could almost see the warrior-chef's soul burning bright in her chest, full of loyalty for her Queen.<br>

Another Leader?<br>
<br>
Chapter 4 - The Knight Commander's Leadership<br>
When I talk to King George V, I sometimes feel like she is the de facto leader of the Royal Navy.<br>
During a sortie...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">King George V：</span><br>
Interesting attack you have there!<br>
Stay calm! Make no mistakes. I shall ensure both victory and the safety of all my comrades!<br>
<br>
Even on the battlefield, she often leads the forces of the Royal Navy.<br>
Port - Harbor Entrance<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">King George V：</span><br>
Let's get this shipment over to Warehouse #3.<br>
Also, make sure to let the Eagle Union representative know that our joint exercise is still on for next week. Even though Her Majesty will be out, I'll take charge in her stead.<br>
<br>
She even takes care of many of the responsibilities normally handled by Queen Elizabeth...<br>
Port - Main Plaza<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">King George V：</span><br>
Norfolk, is everything all right? Did you have a bad dream?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Norfolk：</span><br>
Uhh... Don't think so...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">King George V：</span><br>
If there's something on your mind, let's hear it. Maybe I might be able to help.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Norfolk：</span><br>
...Sure!<br>
<br>
Even during her leisure time, she still helps others work out their problems or conflicts.<br>
Port - Royal Navy Dorms<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Hood：</span><br>
Are you saying that King George V acts more like Her Majesty than, well, Her Majesty?<br>
<br>
While dining with some members of the Royal Navy, I candidly offered my observations from the last few days to Hood.<br>
<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项1：Nod</span>'''''<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项2：That isn't what I was trying to get at...</span>'''''<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Hood：</span><br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项1）</span>'''''Perhaps she should be more aware of her boundaries. What say you, George?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Hood：</span><br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项2）</span>'''''No, Commander, thank you for being frank with your observations. If those were the conclusions you made, then we indeed have a problem.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">King George V：</span><br>
I see... That may not have been my intention at all, but if the Commander made that observation, then surely others must have as well.<br>
<br>
As she said this, she emerged from the kitchen with plates of freshly-prepared food in her hands.<br>

<br>
Chapter 5 - Let's get this shipment over to Warehouse.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Hood：</span><br>
Don't you agree, George? If you shine too brightly, you may find yourself eclipsing Her Majesty.<br>
Having that said, the Royal Navy is full of unique personalities, like Wales and Duke of York...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">King George V：</span><br>
Being strong in both body and personality is a good thing indeed.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Hood：</span><br>
But your charismatic personality is particularly problematic. You'll cause trouble for Her Majesty if you aren't careful.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">King George V：</span><br>
Are you trying to say that I'd cause...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Hood：</span><br>
That's right. If you think from the perspective of others such as the Commander...<br>
Your character overlaps too much with Her Majesty's...<br>
<br>
The temperature in the room seemed to drop by a few degrees.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Hood：</span><br>
Within the Royal Navy, we all know what kind of person you are. You do not act out of lofty ambitions, but rather because you were born with a big heart and a sense of duty.<br>
But what if you were another leader, such as Nagato, Bismarck, Avrora, or even the Commander?<br>
What would they think when they see you vying for power with Her Majesty, and how would they react to that?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">King George V：</span><br>
...That sounds a bit terrifying, if you phrase it like that...<br>
<br>
(Wow, I didn't even think it was that serious...)<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Hood：</span><br>
Haha, I merely jest. However, the problem that the Commander posed is very real, and in order to resolve that–<br>
<br>
Hood stood from her seat and walked between King George V and myself, pointing us towards each other before giving an elegant curtsy.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Hood：</span><br>
You must let the Commander learn more about you, George.<br>
But not as friends, nor as commander and secretary. What you two need is a much deeper bond.<br>
<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项1：In other words...</span>'''''<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">King George V：</span><br>
Hmm... I think I understand.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Hood：</span><br>
Heheh~ George, you'll have to show some of your "soft side" to the Commander.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">King George V：</span><br>
Come again...?<br>
<br>
Huh? King George V has a "soft side?"<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Hood：</span><br>
Commander, why don't you try cooking for her?<br>

<br>
Chapter 6 - Tonight's Supper<br>
As a result of Hood's proposal, I suddenly found myself trying to cook for King George V.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">King George V：</span><br>
Commander, do you know how to cook?<br>
<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项1：I've poured myself a bowl of cereal before.</span>'''''<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项2：I wouldn't get my hopes up.</span>'''''<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">King George V：</span><br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项1）</span>'''''Heh. Let's see what you're capable of then.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">King George V：</span><br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项2）</span>'''''I see. Well, in any case, this is a good opportunity to learn a useful skill.<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项2）</span>'''''You can always grab one of the Maids to help you.<br>
<br>
With that, the kitchen became a much livelier place.<br>
I started with the basics, such as learning how to handle vegetables and eggs.<br>
Then I prepared them on the skillet...<br>
... and finally, plated my freshly-made omelet!<br>
I carried my creation over to King George V.<br>
<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项1：I'd like you to try this.</span>'''''<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">King George V：</span><br>
This is... scrambled eggs?<br>
She poked at the dish in front of her with curiosity before lifting some to her lips.<br>
Hmm... Commander, it'll take a lot more practice before you can hope to satisfy my palate.<br>
<br>
(Well, that was to be expected. This person is capable of crafting dishes fit for a Queen, so of course she'd be on a completely different level from me...)<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">King George V：</span><br>
However...<br>
The fact that you prepared this dish especially for me... is quite the delicious seasoning.<br>
King George V smiled at me warmly, almost as if...<br>
... the person in front of me was not my secretary ship, a Knight Commander, or one of the most charismatic leaders in the Royal Navy — but rather, just an ordinary girl who enjoyed cooking.<br>
<br>
And with that, I caught a glimpse of her "soft side."<br>
I turned back towards the kitchen to continue my training.<br>
One day, I would make something that she would acknowledge as truly delicious.<br>

Chapter 7 - Heart's Desire<br>
Port - Royal Navy Dorms<br>
One day, King George V asked me to prepare supper at the Royal Navy dorms — my biggest test yet since I started to learn how to cook for her sake.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Hood：</span><br>
So this supper is the culmination of the Commander's hard work? Let's give it a try.<br>
Hood sized up my cooking, before bringing a bite to her mouth elegantly.<br>
Not bad at all, Commander. I can taste the effort that you've put into this.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">King George V：</span><br>
Hood, I must offer you my gratitude.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Hood：</span><br>
Oh? For what, may I ask?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">King George V：</span><br>
This whole thing. Starting from the Commander's misconception, no... the fact that you recognized that I was overstepping my boundaries.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Hood：</span><br>
Heehee. I don't recall doing any such thing~<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">King George V：</span><br>
Although the Commander was the one who put in the effort, all of this is possible today because of the advice you gave.<br>
This method of yours — getting to know each other better by sharing your soft side — really worked out well.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Hood：</span><br>
Yes, it's well suited for you.<br>
<br>
Indeed, it wasn't only our relationship that improved. When word spread that I had been cooking for her, she seemed much more approachable and relatable in the eyes of the other factions.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">King George V：</span><br>
Hahaha! I can't deny that!<br>
<br>
While joking merrily with Hood, she turned her face towards me and smiled.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">King George V：</span><br>
In any case, thank you as well for doing all of this for me, Commander.<br>
There's a saying that "the quickest way to one's heart is through their stomach." In my case though, you've managed to win over both at once... Hahaha...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Hood：</span><br>
Oh my...<br>
<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项1：...Huh?</span>'''''<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">King George V：</span><br>
Ahh, um, sorry. I didn't mean to spring that upon you all of a sudden. I'll try to read the mood better next time...<br>
I'm not as easygoing as Wales, nor am I as forceful as Duke of York.<br>
But I'm not good at letting go of people who manage to earn my trust.<br>
<br>
She may have grown quite a lot through our time together, but some things never change. Her straightforward and earnest confession was charismatic and irresistible.<br>
I smiled at her, looking forward to the many culinary adventures that we would have together.<br>
