<span style="color:#ff0000;">Hornet：</span><br>
So you're the new Commander? I'm surprised that you were able to find my coordinates so fast!<br>
But it would be a shame if this exercise had never started.<br>
Let me, the great Hornet, test your strength. Don't worry, we'll both be firing blanks!<br>
Don't worry, I won't hurt you too badly!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Long Island：</span><br>
Commander, air support preparation is underway. Buy us time and delay Hornet's attacks until its complete!<br>

<span style="color:#ff0000;">Hornet：</span><br>
Aya! A diversion. I was too careless! All these new Commanders are monsters!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Long Island：</span><br>
*Heehee* Hornet, you were just focusing on your attacks! We managed to find an opportunity.<br>
<span style="color:#ff0000;">Hornet：</span><br>
Hornet lost, but just this once! My two sisters are even more powerful than me. Test yourself against them in the future if you dare!<br>
Sadly, my sisters are out on a mission. It's a pity that you can't meet each other today!<br>
<br>
Attention all crew, attention all crew! The main harbor is under attack. It's an airstrike! All hands on deck! This is not a drill!<br>
Repeat. All hands on deck! This is not a drill!<br>
<span style="color:#ff0000;">Hornet：</span><br>
What's going on? The harbor is under attack? Could it be the Sirens?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Long Island：</span><br>
It's unclear. We received a telegram requesting us to return to harbor at once. This doesn't look like it's going to end well.<br>
<span style="color:#ff0000;">Hornet：</span><br>
It's time that we part ways. Remember, we'll use live ammo next time! No more drills for you, Commander.<br>
For the Eagles! For freedom!<br>

Sister… where are you?<br>
Sister… the sea… it's burning…<br>
Sister… I'm sorry… I couldn't protect them...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Pennsylvania：</span><br>
If Hell exists, this must be what it feels like.<br>
May you guide us to a future in which these sacrifices welcome your compassion.<br>
At least... take this child's soul... Give us the courage to fight back...<br>
This damn war... has started again...<br>

Our telegraph just reported a bombardment in our port. Arizona, California, West Virginia and Oklahoma were heavily damaged...<br>
Our headquarters has ordered us to hold the outer defense as long as possible, no enemy ship shall pass!<br>
Commander, it is on you.<br>

<br>
Harbor perimeter defense established! It's a shame that they managed to escape...<br>
From their gear, I'd wager that the warship was used as cover for their fleet. There may be an even bigger division assembling in the distance...<br>
HQ has ordered us to give chase. Hopefully we have enough ammo... *cries*<br>

<br>
Hostile enemy flagship ahead!<br>
<span style="color:#ffffff;">？？？：</span><br>
Hehehe, another group of bugs to squash. I'm surprised you managed to find your way here.<br>
They managed to break through our outter defences... This is not going according to plan.<br>
Our main objective has already been completed. All that remains is for us to play with these bugs... hehehe...<br>

Our objective has been completed. Call off the third wave of airstrikes. All ships, retreat!<br>
<span style="color:#ff0000;">{{AF|Kaga}}：</span><br>
Call off the airstrikes? But, if we don't finish them off now...<br>
<span style="color:#ff0000;">{{AF|Akagi}}：</span><br>
Listen, bugs! This is the will of the gods!<br>
Today, the Sakura Empire officially joined forces with the Crimson Axis. We will deliver divine punishment upon the heretics!<br>
The future belongs to the strong. We will take our rightful place as divine masters of the oceans! Hehehe!<br>
You, Commander. I'm sure we will meet each other in battle again.<br>
