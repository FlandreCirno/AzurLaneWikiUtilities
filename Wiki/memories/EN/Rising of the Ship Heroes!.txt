Frontier City - Blacksmith<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">System：</span><br>
You will face more dangerous enemies henceforth. You should upgrade your GEAR!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Blacksmith：</span><br>
Welcome, nya~ Upgrading gear is 100G a pop, nya. What do you say, nya?<br>
<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项1：YES</span>'''''<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项2：NO</span>'''''<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Blacksmith：</span><br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项2）</span>'''''Look, hero, this is part of the tutorial, nya. No is not an option, nya.<br>
<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项1：YES</span>'''''<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Blacksmith：</span><br>
This will just take a minute, nya~<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">System：</span><br>
You paid 100G. You have 100G remaining. You received WARRIOR'S AXE+1!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Blacksmith：</span><br>
Here you go, nya~ Do you wanna upgrade it again, nya?<br>
<br>

<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项1：YES</span>'''''<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Blacksmith：</span><br>
This will just take a minute, nya~<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">System：</span><br>
You paid 100G. You have 0G remaining. You lost WARRIOR'S AXE+1!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Blacksmith：</span><br>
Darn, it failed, nya. Talk about bad luck, nya!<br>
It's not the end of the world though, nya! I can upgrade another piece of gear any time if you have the money, nya!<br>
Do you want to upgrade something else, nya?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Z23：</span><br>
Did... Did I just LOSE my axe?!<br>
That took all our money, too!<br>
Ahah... Ahahaha...<br>
*sigh*... We have to start from scratch and earn our gold back...<br>

Great Dungeon - Top Floor<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Javelin：</span><br>
Holy cow! We've found the Four Beasts' Dungeon!<br>
All we have to do is make it to the exit and we'll have a straight path to the Demon King's lair!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">{namecode:408}：</span><br>
While that sounds great, this place is a maze... Finding the exit will take forever.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Laffey：</span><br>
Ugh... I'm already tired as heck...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">{namecode:408}：</span><br>
Don't get lazy so soon! We haven't even fought one battle yet!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ayanami：</span><br>
I've figured out the dungeon's layout.<br>
This wall just ahead has a weak spot in its structure. Yes, I can do this.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Javelin：</span><br>
Wait, do what? What are you going to do?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ayanami：</span><br>
One's body is one's most powerful weapon. You wouldn't understand.<br>
I'm going to use my Ultimate Ability: Dynamic Entry Kick!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">System：</span><br>
AYANAMI performed DYNAMIC KICK! SURPRISINGLY STURDY WALL took 999 DMG! SURPRISINGLY STURDY WALL was destroyed!<br>
A path to the dungeon's center appeared!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ayanami：</span><br>
Heheh... Yes, this is much faster. Now let's go!<br>

<span style="color:#ec5d53;">The Demon King：</span><br>
Mwahahah! I'm surprised you made it to my lair alive!<br>
But you won't be for much longer! I will see to that myself!<br>
Your little adventure ends right here and n–<br>
<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">System：</span><br>
JAVELIN performed ENDLESS SLASH! DARK LORD took 100,000,000 DMG! DARK LORD was defeated!<br>
<span style="color:#ec5d53;">The Demon King：</span><br>
Th-this cannot be! How could you possibly defeat me?!<br>
Graaaghhh!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">System：</span><br>
You received DARK LORD'S TREASURY KEY!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Javelin：</span><br>
Oh my gosh... This has to be the legendary weapon that only the chosen one can wield!<br>
It looks fishy... but it has the best attack stat I've ever seen!<br>
Heheh, I think I'm gonna hang on to this!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">System：</span><br>
And so the Demon King was defeated and the world was at peace.<br>
THE END<br>
