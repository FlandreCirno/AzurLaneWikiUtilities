<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Sirius：</span><br>
My honourable Master would have noticed that last mistake.<br>
I need to practice more. To give you the ultimate performance you deserve...<br>
This is my duty – my duty as a maid...! Right!<br>
<br>
When the performance ends, I come to the wings of the stage and find Sirius still hanging from the ring.<br>
She's muttering to herself. It's hard to tell if she's noticed me or not.<br>
<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项1：Sirius?</span>'''''<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项2：Sirius!</span>'''''<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Sirius：</span><br>
Ah?! My honourable Master, how long have you been here...?<br>
No, I'm sorry. A mere maid mustn't ask such things.<br>
How did you enjoy the show?<br>
Did my dance please you, my honourable Master?<br>
<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项1：I loved it.</span>'''''<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项2：It was awesome!</span>'''''<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Sirius：</span><br>
Ooh... It's such a joy to receive your recognition, my honourable Master!<br>
<br>
She looks over at me, swaying slightly as she maintains the same pose from the end of her show.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
It must be tiring to maintain that posture, right?<br>
The show's over... Why not come down already?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Sirius：</span><br>
Well...<br>
When our eyes met at the end of the show, I became so nervous that, umm, I made an unexpected movement...<br>
Some of my ribbons tangled... and I can't untie them...<br>
But do not worry, my honourable Master! I will have this problem solved in no time!<br>
<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项1：(Help her.)</span>'''''<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项2：(Rush to her aid.)</span>'''''<br>
<br>
I can't just leave her like this, so I move to help her untie the ribbons wrapped around her.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Sirius：</span><br>
My honourable Master, I couldn't trouble you to...<br>
O-oh, okay... Thank you... I apologize for my clumsiness.<br>
<br>
Given her lack of support or anything to hold on to, she sways when I touch her.<br>
It makes untying the ribbons a difficult task.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Sirius：</span><br>
This must make it difficult for you to help, my honourable Master... May I hold on to your shirt for support?<br>
<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项1：Go for it.</span>'''''<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项2：I'd be offended if you didn't!</span>'''''<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Sirius：</span><br>
Okay. Pardon me...!<br>
<br>
Sirius stretches out her free hand and grabs my top.<br>
Her swaying abates. Eventually she stabilizes, but since she's using me for support, we're a lot closer to each other now.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Sirius：</span><br>
D-don't you think we're a little too close, maybe...?<br>
Or is this acceptable for you?<br>
No answer... Is this tacit acceptance?<br>
I think I might just be able to slip out now.<br>
<br>
She lets go of my shirt, causing the ring to rock back and forth again.<br>
Right after, a warm feeling touches my waist – she's wrapped her arms around me to stabilize herself again.<br>
We're even closer than before now.<br>
And... the ribbons I just untied have all gotten tangled again.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
It's going to take even longer to fix this mess.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Sirius：</span><br>
I'm so sorry, my honourable Master. I blundered again...<br>
But I understand that you're not angry with me.<br>
Does that mean... you're okay with being this close to me?<br>
You wouldn't mind staying like this for a while longer? Is that right, my honourable Master?<br>
