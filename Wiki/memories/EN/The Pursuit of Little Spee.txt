KABOOOM!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Clevelad：</span><br>
An ambush?! Hey, Helena, you okay?!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Lena：</span><br>
I'm fine... But they got away with the goods we were transporting again...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Clevelad：</span><br>
What the heck is their deal? That's the third time this week!<br>
We'll run all out of candy if they keep stealing from us!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Li'l Sandy：</span><br>
You know what that means! We've got to fight fire with fire!<br>
It's time to teach the evil candy thief a good lesson!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Lena：</span><br>
F-first we need information, though. We can't catch the thief if we don't know where they are.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Clevelad：</span><br>
I have a plan! I'll take the mass-produced ships and reinforce the convoy carrying the candy.<br>
Helena, contact the other factions in the meanwhile. Nobody's gonna like it if we run out of candy!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Li'l Sandy：</span><br>
What about me? What should I do?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Clevelad：</span><br>
You could call Saratoga! If anyone can figure out what's going on, it's her.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Li'l Sandy：</span><br>
Okey-dokey! That's easy peasy!<br>
<span style="color:#ec5d53;">Little Spee：</span><br>
Hehehe... So much candy, so many snacks...<br>
I should gather even more...<br>

A few days later...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Little Enterprise：</span><br>
Hey, Helena. I brought the Eagle Union girls along.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Little Cheshire：</span><br>
And I brought my Royal Navy friends!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Little Renown：</span><br>
Hello. I come bringing support and greetings from Her Majesty.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Little Illustrious：</span><br>
In the name of love and peace, may our endeavour to prevent the candy shortage be successful.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Akagi-chan：</span><br>
The Sakura Empire is here too! Gosh, I can't believe the thief has gotten away with it for so long.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Hiei-chan：</span><br>
As candy becomes more scarce, it'll be harder and harder for me to throw banquets...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Amagi-chan：</span><br>
The thief has even taken our yummy dangos... We've got to catch them as soon as possible!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Little Saratoga?：</span><br>
Alright, be quiet, everyone! I've got intel to share with you!<br>
Firstly, there's actually two thieves! And I know they're from the Iron Blood. Attacking shipping vessels and stealing candy is just what they'd do!<br>
See, I was playing in the sea just the other day and saw Eugen trading candy with some other girl!<br>
Then, while I was distracted by Eugen, the other girl snuck up from behind and attacked me...<br>
I heard a big boom, then fell asleep! And when I woke up, they were both gone!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Lena：</span><br>
Interesting... Thanks for the helpful info.<br>
Now we know Eugen is one of the thieves, but who's the other? I can't think of any–<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Clevelad：</span><br>
Big trouble, everyone! The shipping vessels transporting the candy are under attack!<br>
The mass-produced ships are engaging 'em right now! I'm headed there now, but I need backup!<br>
Get over here as soon as you can! This is our chance to catch the thieves!<br>

<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Clevelad：</span><br>
There you are, candy thief! We've got you now!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Akagi-chan：</span><br>
Yeah, heheh! You should just surrender now. Play nice and we'll hear what you have to say in jail.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Little Renown：</span><br>
Lower your weapons and hand over the candy! If you don't, we'll have no choice but to fight you!<br>
<span style="color:#ec5d53;">Little Spee：</span><br>
You're never getting my candy.<br>
Beer and bratwurst aren't the only important things in life. Candy is, too. You all just don't understand that.<br>
That's why I came up with a plan... A plan to fill the ocean with candy and snacks!<br>
And I'm so close to achieving it.<br>
All I need is a little more candy, then candy will cover the whole ocean. Nobody can stop me now!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Little Enterprise：</span><br>
I... I don't know what her deal is, but I do know she's up to no good!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Li'l Sandy：</span><br>
Obviously candy is important, but the ocean is just as important!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Amagi-chan：</span><br>
The ocean is where we live and play. It's our home, and it's where we're safe!<br>
We're not gonna let you get away with this!<br>
<span style="color:#ec5d53;">Little Spee：</span><br>
F-fine, then we'll fight it out. I'm just as strong as you. Don't blame me if you get hurt and cry!<br>
<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Clevelad：</span><br>
Aim more carefully, girls! You're hitting the shipping vessels by mistake!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Lena：</span><br>
That wasn't any of us! It's Spee! She's sinking the vessels!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Li'l Sandy：</span><br>
Oh no! The candy is leaking into the ocean!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Little Illustrious：</span><br>
Hmm... Is it just me, or does the water taste sweet?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Amagi-chan：</span><br>
*gulp*... You're right.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Akagi-chan：</span><br>
Don't do that, Amagi! Salt water is bad for you!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Little Enterprise：</span><br>
What the...? What've you done, Spee?!<br>
<span style="color:#ec5d53;">Little Spee：</span><br>
All I wanted was to make the ocean sweet... That was my dream...<br>
And if my dream can't be real...<br>
Then I'll become one with the ocean! I'll go to my dream world where everything tastes like candy!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Clevelad：</span><br>
Wait! Don't!<br>
<span style="color:#ec5d53;">Little Spee：</span><br>
Farewell, protectors of the sea!<br>
<br>
"And so, the girls put a stop to Spee's plan to sweeten the world's oceans."<br>
"Even to this day, you'll sometimes find candy resurfacing from the spot where Spee went under. The area has become a popular port tourist attraction."<br>
"While some say Spee lived happily ever after in her candy world, others say Eugen came and rescued her."<br>
"Whichever the case, the fact is that nobody has seen Spee for quite some time."<br>
"Some stories have fuzzy beginnings, others have ambiguous endings. As for this one, well, it ends here."<br>
The End<br>
