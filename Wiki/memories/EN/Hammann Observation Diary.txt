Hammann Observation Diary<br>
<br>
Chapter 1: The Ill-Tempered Secretary<br>
Port - Office<br>
Hammann：<br>
Hey! You there!<br>
<br>
Huh...?<br>
Hammann：<br>
The report that I submitted! You still haven't gone over it?<br>
I left it on your desk an hour ago! Why haven't you looked at it yet?<br>
<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项1：I still haven't finished looking over the reports from three hours ago...</span>'''''<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项2：Didn't I say you could submit that report tomorrow?</span>'''''<br>
Hammann：<br>
No excuses!<br>
If you said you haven't looked at it, then that means you haven't looked at it! After I put all that time and effort into writing the report, how do you plan to make it up to me?<br>
*mumbles* ...and here, I was going to give you a reward if you already finished checking it...<br>
<br>
Why'd you start mumbling all of a sudden...<br>
Hammann：<br>
None of your business! Finish reading that report this instant so you can take me... I mean, give me orders!<br>
You have to oversee the training exercises next, right? I might not be around after that, so speak now or forever hold your peace!<br>
... What do you mean you don't have any work for me right this second...?! You've been so busy over there, so why aren't you letting me help?<br>
Argh, what a pain! Just hurry up and go to those exercises already!<br>
Iiiiidiot!<br>
<br>
*SLAM!*<br>
For some reason, Hammann chased me out of the office.<br>

Hammann Observation Diary<br>
<br>
Chapter 2: Unhappiness, Part 1<br>
A minute after Hammann chased me out of the office...<br>
<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项1：Look through the window to check on Hammann</span>'''''<br>
Hammann：<br>
That big idiot! Even though I offered to help, "it's not good to push yourself too hard"...? What's with that attitude?!<br>
Isn't it the secretary's job to help out when the work piles up?!<br>
The next training exercises take place at... 1600...? There's still two more hours to go?!<br>
... Ugh.<br>
<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项1：Ah- she stopped moving.</span>'''''<br>
Hammann：<br>
H-hmph! It's all because Commander was too slow!<br>
... Let's see, today's work is... this entire mountain of documents?!<br>
... And the timestamp on these documents... no way, this entire morning?!<br>
S-so this is why I was told to turn the report in tomorrow...<br>
......Ughh...<br>
<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项1：Ah- looks like she ran out of steam this time.</span>'''''<br>
Hammann：<br>
N-not bad I suppose... I'd expect no less from my Commander...<br>
And despite being a total pervert around me... Commander treats everyone so nicely...<br>
...and is totally dreamy on the battlefield, so why do I get treated like this...<br>
...*Gasp*!<br>
Why'd I chase Commander out of the office?!<br>

Hammann Observation Diary<br>
<br>
Chapter 3: Unhappiness, Part 2<br>
A while after Hammann chased me out of the office...<br>
<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项1：Continue observing Hammann while eating your to-go meal</span>'''''<br>
Hammann：<br>
In, in any case, I should clean up the office...<br>
<br>
Five minutes later...<br>
Hammann：<br>
Wh-what should I do...? What if Commander ends up hating me...?<br>
No, it's not too late. I'll have to properly apologize... But I don't know where Commander is now...<br>
That's right! I'll go ask Lexington, since she should be using the training area right now...<br>
No, no, no! I have to practice what to say in case I run into Commander along the way...!<br>
<br>
Hammann gave herself a couple quick pats on the cheeks to cheer up.<br>
Hammann：<br>
C-C-Commander! S-Sorry for chasing you out of the office!<br>
Stop loafing around and get back to work already!<br>
<br>
... ...<br>
Hammann：<br>
Aaahhh! Wait! If I said it like that, Commander would just get depressed...!<br>
<br>
Hammann hugged her head, apparently agonizing over this.<br>
Hammann：<br>
Aahh, forget it! I'll just do that method Saratoga told me to try last time...<br>
Sorry, Commander~♪ Hammann made a little oopsies earlier~☆<br>
Hammann will be a good girl next time and work harder for Commander's sake, so please forgive her (>_<)<br>
<br>
(The door creaks open)<br>
Sims：<br>
Hammann~♪ Let's play~<br>
Hammann：<br>
Eh...?<br>
Sims：<br>
Eh...?<br>
Hammann：<br>
Gyaaaaaaaaaah!!!!!!<br>

Hammann Observation Diary<br>
<br>
Chapter 4: Unhappiness, Part 3<br>
Hammann：<br>
Someone saw me... Someone saw me......<br>
Sims：<br>
It wasn't on purpose but... what the heck were you doing?<br>
Hammann：<br>
Um, so it goes something like this...<br>
... But forget about all of that! Right this instant!<br>
Sims：<br>
Aaahhh! Stop shaking me around! B-Besides, it's not even that big of a deal...<br>
Hammann：<br>
Of course it's a big deal! I don't know how Commander is handling all this...<br>
Sims：<br>
Didn't this only happen in the first place because you can't give a proper apology?<br>
Hammann：<br>
That may be the case but... I can't do this apology thing alone! Sims, I need you to help me!<br>
Sims：<br>
Wait, what am I going to do? ...That's right, you should ask Yorktown!<br>
Hammann：<br>
Good point! If anyone would know what to do, it's Yorktown...! Thanks, Sims! Look after the office for me, okay?<br>
<br>
Hammann zoomed off in a puff of smoke.<br>
Sims：<br>
Ah... there she goes again...<br>
Well, I did get some juicy recordings of the look on her face, so I suppose that makes this worth my while.<br>
I wonder what kind of prank I should play on her next time... Ehehe~♪<br>
<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项1：Sneak up behind Sims and scold her</span>'''''<br>
Sims：<br>
Eek! Commander, when'd you get here?!<br>
Take you over to Yorktown? I can do that, but.. and you want me to erase the video?! Whyyy?!<br>

Hammann Observation Diary<br>
<br>
Chapter 5: Hammann and Yorktown<br>
Hammann：<br>
...And then, I chased Commander out of the office...<br>
Yorktown：<br>
Hmm, I see.<br>
Hammann：<br>
...And now I don't know where to find Commander...<br>
Yorktown：<br>
Mmhmm.<br>
Hammann：<br>
...But even then, how am I supposed to apologize...<br>
Yorktown：<br>
I see. That is a bit of a tough situation, Hammann...<br>
Hammann：<br>
Waaaaaagh! Yorktown~!!<br>
<br>
Yorktown gave Hammann a pat on the head before pulling her into her bosom.<br>
Yorktown：<br>
Hammann, as long as you really are sorry, then you should just be true to yourself.<br>
As long as you're genuine about it, Commander will understand your intentions.<br>
Hammann：<br>
You have a point... Thanks, Yorktown...<br>
<br>
Elsewhere...<br>
Sims：<br>
Ermm... seems like you missed your opportunity to step in? ...Hey, I'm not taking videos anymore!<br>
<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项1：I suppose I did...</span>'''''<br>
Sims：<br>
Maybe they've already noticed us...<br>
Yorktown：<br>
Indeed. Sims, Commander, I know you're over there.<br>
Sims：<br>
Geh?!<br>

Hammann Observation Diary<br>
<br>
Chapter 6: Hello, Military Police?!<br>
Sims：<br>
Um... I just happened to run into the Commander who just happened to tell me about what happened with Hammann... and yeah...<br>
Yorktown：<br>
Is that so...? I could've sworn you two were listening in for quite some time...<br>
<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项1：I'm sorry! I promise not to eavesdrop anymore!</span>'''''<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项2：Sims convinced me to do it!</span>'''''<br>
Sims：<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项1）</span>'''''That's right! It was a total coincidence! Coincidence, I tell you!<br>
Sims：<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项2）</span>'''''Eeeeehhhhhh?!?!<br>
Hammann：<br>
C-C-Commander?!<br>
You pervert! Stalker! Iiiiidiot!!<br>
<br>
Hammann tearfully reached for the telephone to dial the naval headquarters.<br>
Hammann：<br>
Hello? Headquarters?! Yes! There's a commander here... and, and...<br>
...the commander is doing a fine job... yes...<br>
<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项1：I'm truly sorry. I could've timed this much better.</span>'''''<br>
Yorktown：<br>
...See? Commander was worried and came looking for you.<br>
Hammann：<br>
I know... But even then...<br>
Yorktown：<br>
Commander, I owe you an apology as well... Sorry for all the trouble Hammann has caused you...<br>
Sims：<br>
Hammann, this could've all been prevented if you were a bit more honest with yourself~<br>
Hammann：<br>
...Uuu...<br>

Hammann Observation Diary<br>
<br>
Chapter 7: Honest... For Just a Moment!<br>
Yorktown：<br>
Hammann, Commander is right here. Why don't you say what you told me and apologize properly?<br>
Sims：<br>
Ah! That thing Saratoga told you do is good fun and all, but let's not do that again!<br>
Hammann：<br>
Of course I wouldn't! ...Jeez! All I have to do is apologize, right?<br>
You id- I mean, Commander!<br>
S-s-s-s-s-sorry... about chasing you out of the office earlier...<br>
Actually, I didn't know you had so much work in the morning! Because of that...<br>
(whispers) ...I, I just wanted you to praise me for finishing early...<br>
(whispers) ...But you weren't paying attention to me... even though I like you so much...<br>
<br>
Though her voice was but a tiny whisper, I still could hear what she said.<br>
<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项1：I owe you an apology as well, Hammann.</span>'''''<br>
Hammann：<br>
Commander... Uuu... thank you...<br>
I get grumpy if you don't pay attention to me... so...<br>
<br>
I could feel Hammann's warmth as she threw her arms around me.<br>
Sims：<br>
"...I, I just wanted you to praise me for finishing early..."<br>
Aha! Recording successful! Heehee~♪<br>
Hammann：<br>
? ! ? !<br>
Siiiiiiiiiiimmmmmmmmssssssssssss!!!<br>
Sims：<br>
Weeell, y'see, Commander, I promised not to film anything. But you never said anything about audio recording!<br>
Yorktown：<br>
Oh my... How troublesome...<br>
Hammann：<br>
Sims! Delete it!!!!<br>
<br>
Today... proved to be another hectic day.<br>
