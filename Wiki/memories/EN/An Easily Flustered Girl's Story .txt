<br>
Chapter 1 - An Easily Flustered Girl's Day<br>
Port - Office<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Honolulu：</span><br>
My secretary, Honolulu, was standing in front of a bookcase and sorting documents.<br>
......<br>
Hey, uh... Could you not stare at me so much? I can't work properly when you do that...<br>
...... (The Commander silently stopped observing Honolulu.)<br>
*Sigh*... So, will these documents be all you need?<br>
...... (The Commander silently nodded in agreement.)<br>
Are you gonna inspect my gear? Fine, as long as you don't do anything weird...<br>
...... (The Commander silently got ready to inspect Honolulu's equipment.)<br>
Hey, are you even paying attention? ... A commission's been completed.<br>
...... (The Commander silently confirmed the results of the commission.)<br>
<br>
It's been some time since Honolulu started working as my secretary, and to a point, we've begun to understand each other's ways of doing things. However...<br>
While she does her work just as you'd expect, for some reason, she always seems to be in a bad mood. I feel like she's hard to initiate a conversation with.<br>
<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项1：Ask her how she feels</span>'''''<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Honolulu：</span><br>
D-don't touch me from behind without asking! You need to learn how to be more delicate... So, what do you want?<br>
... No, I'm not angry, but maybe there's something that's bothering me.<br>
... I'm not trying to say that I hate you... I've just always had a temper like this.<br>
If you don't like it then maybe you should get someone else to do the job...<br>
(Whispering) ... I bet you just chose me because of my bust...<br>
<br>
I can only conclude that Honolulu isn't upset at me in particular.<br>
If I had to guess, she's just not very good at communicating her feelings...<br>
... That actually made me a little curious about her.<br>

<br>
Chapter 2 - She Doesn't Have Many Friends?<br>
Port - Academy Courtyard<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Honolulu：</span><br>
What did you want, Louis?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">St. Louis：</span><br>
*Giggle*~ What? You mean we can't chat if I don't need something from you?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Honolulu：</span><br>
Well, I guess we could chat... Not like I have anything better to do.<br>
... But why is the Commander here, too?<br>
<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项1：Say hello to them</span>'''''<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">St. Louis：</span><br>
Ah, is this what you might call a lucky coincidence?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Honolulu：</span><br>
W-what's so lucky about this...?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">St. Louis：</span><br>
Well, you hardly talk to anyone but Helena and me, no?<br>
So why don't you try getting to know the Commander? You have the chance now that you're the secretary.<br>
<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项1：Nod in agreement</span>'''''<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Honolulu：</span><br>
*Ugh*... That's none of your business, is it? And you, Commander, stay out of this!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">St. Louis：</span><br>
It IS my business. We're friends, aren't we?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Honolulu：</span><br>
*Sigh*... You just want me to make a fool of myself again, don't you?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">St. Louis：</span><br>
Sure, if that's what you want to call it then let's go with that.<br>
<br>
I have a hunch that St. Louis can see straight through Honolulu's charade.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">St. Louis：</span><br>
Putting that aside... What are your thoughts on these clothes?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Honolulu：</span><br>
What clo...?! W-w-what's your problem, displaying embarrassing stuff like this in public?! You're the only person on the planet who likes this stuff!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">St. Louis：</span><br>
Well, I think they'd look great on you... Why not try them on just once?<br>
I bet the Commander is curious as to how you'd look, too.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Honolulu：</span><br>
Whatever, do as you like... Don't be upset if it looks awful on me, cause I don't give a hoot...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">St. Louis：</span><br>
I'll take that as an "OK"~ Then what about these...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Honolulu：</span><br>
*Sigh*...<br>
<br>
Their conversation, if one could call it that, went on for surprisingly long.<br>
I feel like I've come to understand Honolulu's character now.<br>

<br>
Chapter 3 - You've Got a Friend in Me!<br>
Honolulu, Leander, and I went to a café that I frequent.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Honolulu：</span><br>
Thanks for inviting me, Leander.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Leander：</span><br>
Not at all, it's my pleasure.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Honolulu：</span><br>
... But why are YOU here, Commander?<br>
<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项1：Say hello, this time with more energy</span>'''''<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Honolulu：</span><br>
*Sigh*... Whatever, I can't muster the energy to care anymore...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Leander：</span><br>
Well, I first asked the Commander about us going here together, then the Commander told me "I really want to sit next to Honolulu," and since I too wish to get to know you better, I decided to invite you both.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Honolulu：</span><br>
... (Whispering) Yeah, there is...<br>
<br>
Honolulu averted her gaze from me. She seemed displeased.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Leander：</span><br>
Um... I ordered a slice of cake for each of us. I hope you'll find it delectable.<br>
<br>
The 3 of us sat down and enjoyed some good cake and afternoon tea.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Leander：</span><br>
... Ah, that reminds me: it seems you don't socialize much with other girls, Honolulu. Is there a reason for that?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Honolulu：</span><br>
... Yeah. It's because that's just the way I am.<br>
<br>
Leander's question seemed to make Honolulu a little unhappy.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Leander：</span><br>
That's rather unfortunate... You're such a beautiful and wonderful person. You shouldn't be ashamed of who you are.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Honolulu：</span><br>
B-beautiful...? Me...?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Leander：</span><br>
Yes! Even your service record is something to admire. I've always wanted to get to know you better.<br>
I'm certain that other people too would come to understand your splendor if you'd sit down and have a chat with them like this.<br>
You are so splendid, in fact, that I would honestly say it makes me a little jealous.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Honolulu：</span><br>
...... T-thank you...<br>
<br>
Hearing that, Honolulu's expression turned bright red and she began acting fidgety. Maybe nobody has ever praised her so much before.<br>
I knew it was a good idea to invite Honolulu.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Honolulu：</span><br>
... W-why are you looking at me like you just made some kind of breakthrough...<br>
Stupid jerk...<br>
<br>
Honolulu averted her gaze from me again. This time she seemed embarrassed.<br>

<br>
Chapter 4 - Honolulu's Concerned?<br>
Port - Courtyard<br>
I came across Honolulu and Helena as they were hanging out.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Helena：</span><br>
*Sigh*...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Honolulu：</span><br>
What's the matter, Helena?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Helena：</span><br>
Hm...? Oh, nothing, really.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Honolulu：</span><br>
Nothing, huh... Good...<br>
Hey, uh...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Helena：</span><br>
Yeah? What is it?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Honolulu：</span><br>
... No, never mind. What did you have for lunch today?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Helena：</span><br>
Huh? Just the usual... And you?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Honolulu：</span><br>
R-right... Me, well... I guess the usual, too?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Helena：</span><br>
Sounds nice...<br>
Hey, sorry, Cleveland's waiting for me, so I've gotta go.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Honolulu：</span><br>
Oh, okay. See you later.<br>
I failed to start a conversation, again... *Sigh*...<br>
I'm such a big and total moron...<br>
<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项1：Tell her that's not true</span>'''''<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Honolulu：</span><br>
... Huh?!<br>
How long have you been spying on us... *Sigh*... Whatever. It's hardly surprising to see you show up out of nowhere...<br>
Honolulu drew a heavy sigh.<br>
... I'm worried about Helena. And yet... I can't even properly ask her if she's okay. I'm such a helpless, stupid idiot...<br>
<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项1：Offer to give her advice</span>'''''<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Honolulu：</span><br>
Why should I have to take advice from you of all people...<br>
Honolulu averted her gaze from me yet again. This time, however, while she seemed embarrassed, she didn't seem displeased.<br>
But... as strange as it is... you might be able to understand my situation...<br>
So... could you share some of your advice... with me?<br>

An Easily Flustered Girl's Story<br>
<br>
Chapter 5 - Honolulu's Bothered<br>
Port - Office<br>
Honolulu took a seat in the office sofa and, after a few minutes, finally began talking.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Honolulu：</span><br>
... I'm easily flustered, and I'm not honest with people. I don't really get mad at people, but I can't speak my mind to them either...<br>
That's me, in a nutshell. And you've put up with me the whole time...<br>
Honolulu suddenly went silent. A short while later, she started talking again, with a hint of hesitation in her voice.<br>
... A-as I was saying... I'm not bold like Louis, and I'm not elegant like Leander.<br>
I can't imagine myself ever cheerfully smiling like some other girls do, either...<br>
<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项1：Assure her that it's all okay</span>'''''<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项2：Say you like her just the way she is</span>'''''<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Honolulu：</span><br>
You're a strange one, you know that? ... *H-hmph*... *Ugh*...<br>
<br>
Honolulu sighed, got off of the sofa, then walked behind me and started gently massaging my shoulders.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Honolulu：</span><br>
Listen, I don't act grumpy like this because I want to...<br>
I wish I could hold a friendly conversation like Louis, or sit down and enjoy a refined cup of afternoon tea like Leander...<br>
I want to smile and make friends, I want to express my concern and offer my comfort to Helena when she seems down...<br>
Everyone else can do it with no effort, but I just can't manage.<br>
Commander, you have to tell me what I should do...<br>
Honolulu exposed her weak side to me, something she's never done before.<br>
<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项1：Propose going on a date together</span>'''''<br>
...... What?<br>
<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项1：Clarify that it's to buy a present for Helena</span>'''''<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Honolulu：</span><br>
S-sure... I-I guess we can do that.<br>
<br>
And so, I got Honolulu to agree to a "date" with me.<br>

<br>
Chapter 6 - A Date With Honolulu (Part 1)<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Honolulu：</span><br>
You're late, Commander.<br>
I "seem to be in a good mood"? W-why does that matter...<br>
......<br>
I recognize those clothes... Lou showed me a picture of them in a magazine once.<br>
They do look pretty nice, after all... *A-ahem*! Okay, that's enough window shopping! ... Come on, let's head to the next store.<br>
... Honolulu seemed like she couldn't let up and relax.<br>
Hey, that's a pretty cute teddy bear...<br>
L-look, I didn't mean it like that ... I was just wondering if Helena might like it! C-c'mon, let's get a move on...<br>
... I won't be able to have a conversation with her like this.<br>
Sweets? ... I'm not in the mood... Let's just get something small to eat.<br>
... What's the problem with that? Girls have to be mindful of their calorie intake!<br>
......<br>
<br>
We went around and checked every store in the district, and the present we ended up with was...<br>
A cushion made to look like an SG radar.<br>
I'm not sure if Helena will actually like it or not.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Honolulu：</span><br>
Excuse me, I'm pretty sure I know what Helena would like.<br>
Honolulu glared at me.<br>
Okay... I'll give this to her next time we meet. It should make her happy... probably...<br>
<br>
I thought to myself that if Honolulu is convinced it'll work, then it was good enough.<br>
Though she might not have realized it herself, right then the expression on her face wasn't one of displeasure, but of sincere kindness.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Honolulu：</span><br>
Wait, you bought something, too...? Judging by the wrapping, it must be expensive...<br>
Mind if I ask... who it's for?<br>

<br>
Chapter 7 - A Date With Honolulu (Part 2)<br>
Honolulu was curiously ogling the present I had bought.<br>
<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项1：Give Honolulu the present</span>'''''<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Honolulu：</span><br>
... Huh? It's for... me?<br>
I hope for your sake this isn't a jack-in-the-box or something...<br>
<br>
Honolulu left the bag containing the SG radar cushion on the floor and opened the large present I'd given her.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Honolulu：</span><br>
Wait... Isn't this... that teddy bear I saw earlier...?!<br>
You went back and bought this just for me...?<br>
... T-thank you...<br>
Honolulu seemed to relax as she hugged the large teddy bear I'd given her.<br>
She then took a deep breath, and it seemed like she was determined to say something...<br>
I didn't tell you this during our chat the other day, but...<br>
To tell you the truth, I thought you were just nice to me because you liked my big melons since I don't have any other attractive features or character traits...<br>
But, as you began helping me solve my problems... I started thinking that, e-even if that is all you care about...<br>
Honolulu was blushing. Her expression turned as deep red as her hair.<br>
... That I might actually... like you...<br>
Honolulu hid her face behind her teddy bear. Maybe she'd mustered every last bit of her courage to say of all that.<br>
<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项1：Hug Honolulu tightly</span>'''''<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Honolulu：</span><br>
... W-wha...?! Geesh... N-next time, tell me before you do that...<br>
... Thank you, Commander...<br>
