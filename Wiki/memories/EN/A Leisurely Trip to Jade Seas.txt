As we slowly descend into the water, sunlight filters through and shines on me and Lung Wu, casting mottled shadows and shimmering specks below.<br>
The water's buoyancy gently supports my body, giving me a sense of weightlessness.<br>
The world around me gradually comes into focus – colorful fish dart by as a magnificent coral reef unfolds before my eyes like a vibrant garden.<br>
I hold Lung Wu's hand as we dive deeper, the light surrounding us gradually becoming dimmer, the color of the water around us becoming more muted as well.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Lung Wu：</span><br>
Commander, is this the surprise you wanted to show me?<br>
<br>
The sunhat that had been perched atop the girl's head earlier is slowly drifting away through the water, but she seems too enraptured by the beautiful scenery to notice.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Lung Wu：</span><br>
The way the corals sway with the water is so beautiful...<br>
I never knew there was such a vibrant, wonderful world beneath the waves...<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
I'm glad you like it.<br>
<br>
While we're talking, I take the opportunity to pop up and grab her hat.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Here, you lost your hat.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Lung Wu：</span><br>
Oh, thank you so much! ...But, umm, I've been wondering, why did you decide to take me diving in the first place, Commander?<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
You're always so busy in the kitchen, especially recently with how you've been researching new recipes even during your breaks.<br>
So I thought to myself, why not take you somewhere for a change of pace?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Lung Wu：</span><br>
I see, so that's how this happened... I'm sorry for making you worry. I'll try to pay more attention to keeping a proper work-life balance...<br>
Oh, look over there, Commander! Some really pretty jellyfish are floating by!<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Well...<br>
<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项1：Do you like jellyfish, Lung Wu?</span>'''''<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项2：Do you also like corals?</span>'''''<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项3：Indeed, the water here's clear and refreshing.</span>'''''<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项4：Protecting the corals is pretty important, huh...</span>'''''<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Lung Wu：</span><br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项1）</span>'''''I do! They're so soft and fluttery... and incredibly beautiful!<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项1）</span>'''''But, most jellyfish also have poisonous tentacles, so you need to be careful not to touch them.<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项1）</span>'''''Umm... So, it's probably safer to just stay here with the corals...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Lung Wu：</span><br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项2）</span>'''''Yes, of course! They come in all different shapes and sizes!<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项2）</span>'''''Some look like big flowers blooming at the bottom of the ocean, others stretch out like tree branches. They're really colorful too!<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项2）</span>'''''It's said that corals become even more beautiful under the current's gentle caresses, and pass on their vitality to the marine life around them.<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项2）</span>'''''I guess they also play an important role in purifying the seawater, right?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Lung Wu：</span><br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项3）</span>'''''Yes, that's right... Almost like a translucent crystal gemstone...<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项3）</span>'''''But, water this clear also shows that the ecological environment here is excellent, and there isn't much pollution or damage.<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项3）</span>'''''Which is why we need to be extra careful not to harm the corals or creatures here!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Lung Wu：</span><br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项4）</span>'''''You bet! Protecting the corals is pretty much protecting the entire ocean ecosystem!<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项4）</span>'''''The corals serve as a valuable habitat and breeding ground for so many different species of marine life.<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项4）</span>'''''Without them, all these creatures would lose their homes and be in grave danger, and this would disrupt the delicate balance of the entire ecosystem!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Lung Wu：</span><br>
And we can't have that happening, because there are so many delicious ingredients to be found in the ocean such as sea urchins, jellyfish, oysters, and more...<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Want to take some jellyfish home with you to make jellyfish salad?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Lung Wu：</span><br>
Commander, I need to set the record straight here! Just because some kinds of jellyfish are used for cooking does not mean that EVERY jellyfish can be eaten!<br>
Sure, we've probably all heard the saying that "food makes the world go 'round," and filling one's stomach is undoubtedly one of the most important things in life...<br>
You brought me here to appreciate the beauty of the seabed, not to collect food ingredients, right?<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
You're exactly right. We can buy cooking ingredients anywhere, but while we're here, the last thing we want is to mess up the environment.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Lung Wu：</span><br>
Mmhmm! When we get back, I'll cook you an entire banquet of delicious food to thank you for showing me this surprise!<br>
Let me think... I need to buy groceries, do the prep, then finish cooking... The whole process might take a while.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Then, should we start heading back?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Lung Wu：</span><br>
Sure thing~! Commander, um, next time we get the opportunity... Can I go diving with you again?<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Sure. I like the sound of that.<br>
<br>
After hearing my words, Lung Wu nods, then turns towards the corals below and waves them goodbye.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Lung Wu：</span><br>
Goodbye, my wonderful coral friends...<br>
<br>
The colorful corals continue to sway in the gentle current, almost as if waving back.<br>
