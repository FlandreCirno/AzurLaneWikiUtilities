After the Rain Comes the Sun<br>
<br>
Chapter 1 - Tomorrow's Weather Is...<br>
Port - Command Office<br>
It was a day like any other - My secretary ship, Yamashiro, and I were taking care of some work.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">{namecode:79}：</span><br>
Here's the next document... Woah! It slipped through my fingers again... Um, I'll go pick it up right now... Huh?<br>
Ah! Milord, didn't you ask me to seal this document for you earlier this morning? *pouts* Milord, you've been spacing out a lot recently...<br>
You're not pushing yourself too hard, are you? Fusou is really worried about you...<br>
<br>
Right... I did ask you to do that for me...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">{namecode:79}：</span><br>
Pat Yamashiro on the head<br>
Ehehe~ Milord, you're the nicest~<br>
By the way, Milord! Take a look at this! It's super convenient!<br>
<br>
With excitement in her voice, Yamashiro pulled out a smartphone.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">{namecode:79}：</span><br>
Technology advances super quickly, doesn't it! Shigure told me that thirty years ago, there weren't even televisions around. She said families had to huddle around radios. After the Sirens attacked, everything has developed so fast!<br>
It's way too fast...? Hmm... I don't really get it, but... I can do a ton of stuff with this, so it's probably fine!<br>
Let's see what tomorrow's weather is like... Um, hit confirm... Okay! See, now I won't even need to leave a memo!<br>
<br>
Yamashiro held her smartphone out towards me, showing me the screen.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">{namecode:79}：</span><br>
Remember how you promised that you'd help me clean the shrine last time? Well, tomorrow's a holiday, so I'll be counting on your help!<br>

After the Rain Comes the Sun<br>
<br>
Chapter 2 - High Pressure? Low Pressure?<br>
In order to help Yamashiro clean the shrine, I left early in the morning to meet her at the port. She was already waiting for me there.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">{namecode:79}：</span><br>
Good morning, Milord! Let's do our best today!<br>
Umm... when did I get here? Um... h-half an hour ago, m-maybe? I didn't want to keep you waiting, in case I got lost...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">{namecode:17}：</span><br>
Yamashiro! ...and Commander, huh... Don't you have the day off? Are you two going on a date or something?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">{namecode:79}：</span><br>
D-Date?! Y-You've got the wrong idea, Shigure! We're just going to clean up the shrine together...!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">{namecode:17}：</span><br>
Hmmm... If it's not a date, you won't mind me lending a hand, would you? Heh heh~ with my tremendous powers, we'll have the place squeaky clean in no time~!<br>
Or... maybe you'd prefer to be alone with Dumb Commander over there, getting kissyfaced~? ----Oww!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">{namecode:57}：</span><br>
Shigure, leave Yamashiro and Commander alone, will you. Good morning, Yamashiro.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">{namecode:79}：</span><br>
Oh, Mogami! Are you taking Shigure shopping?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">{namecode:57}：</span><br>
Yup. Michishio and the others needed some supplies for the dorm. I can't be relying on Mikuma forever for this kind of stuff...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">{namecode:17}：</span><br>
That darn Shiranui raised her prices again recently. And since those two run the only stores here on the base, complaining won't even do you any good...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">{namecode:79}：</span><br>
Is that so? I don't really get it, but leave it to me! The next time I go to buy tech packs, I'll be sure to give her a scolding!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">{namecode:17}：</span><br>
I appreciate it, Yamashiro, but it's fine. Even if you went, you'd probably get bamboozled by her and end up overpaying for stuff again.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">{namecode:79}：</span><br>
Seriously~?!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">{namecode:57}：</span><br>
Haha, you two get along really well, don't you?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">{namecode:17}：</span><br>
Of course! Yamashiro and I are super tight-knit! She's my favorite!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">{namecode:79}：</span><br>
Ehehe, Shigure... Oh, I really should be heading out to the shrine just about now. Let's hang out next time!<br>

Chapter 3 - A Light Breeze<br>
The shrine close to the port...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">{namecode:79}：</span><br>
Fusouuuu, I've come to help~!! ...Uwooahh!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">{namecode:78}：</span><br>
Yamashiro? Watch out...! Phew... how many times have I told you not to run up the stairs?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">{namecode:79}：</span><br>
Sorry, Fusou... Oh! I borrowed Milord for the day, so we've come to help you clean the shrine!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">{namecode:78}：</span><br>
B-Borrowed...?<br>
<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项1：Ask Yamashiro</span>'''''<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项2：Enlighten Fusou</span>'''''<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">{namecode:79}：</span><br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项1）</span>'''''What does "borrowed" mean? Um, it's because you've agreed to spend the day with me, or something like that!<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项1）</span>'''''Shigure said that this was like a date but not really, so... borrowing makes sense!<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项1）</span>'''''Anyway, Milord, you made a promise to me before, so that's why I picked the same day off as you!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">{namecode:78}：</span><br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项1）</span>'''''Well, just having Commander here will be a huge help. Let's give it our all today.<br>

'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项2）</span>'''''Oh that's what "borrowed" means? ... I don't think I get it, but that's all right...<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项2）</span>'''''You know how Yamashiro is... She probably picked up some strange thing someone else said without fully understanding it...<br>

<span style="color:#4eb24e;">{namecode:78}：</span><br>
Hmm...? You're curious about when this shrine was built...<br>
If I remember correctly, Commander, you had too much work to come here for last year's Hatsumode, right?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">{namecode:79}：</span><br>
Well, this one started as a makeshift for the New Year's celebration while we planned to build another shrine elsewhere, but...<br>
As the number of people from the Sakura Empire increased, we figured that if we were to build a shrine, it should be a place for everyone to make fond memories. That's why the two of us decided to build as nice a shrine as possible.<br>
<br>
Easier said than done. An elaborate shrine like this must have been incredibly difficult to build...<br>

Chapter 4 - Low Pressure Approaches<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">{namecode:78}：</span><br>
Phew... looks like we'll finish early today... Having Commander here was a big help.<br>
Yamashiro, you're more wobbly than usual today... Is everything okay?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">{namecode:79}：</span><br>
I'm fine... but, Milord... Uuu...<br>
Right after we finished cleaning the exterior, we went to my room to take a break...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">{namecode:78}：</span><br>
I already divined your fortune for the day, and it's not that bad... Maybe you were a bit careless, or simply too nervous.<br>
You're not hurt or anything, so you'll be able to get over it. It'd be best not to cause Commander any problems, though.<br>
<br>
I'm no stranger to her clumsiness, but this was my first time seeing it this bad.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">{namecode:79}：</span><br>
M-Milord, p-please don't look inside the drawer! ...Awawa!<br>
Milord, please hold the ladder for me, I need to clean up there! Eeek, from behind?! Uwoaaahh?!<br>
Uuu... a furniture coin fell behind the dresser... Uuu.... can't reach it... M-Milord?! D-don't look in there! Awawawa?!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">{namecode:78}：</span><br>
All right, I'm going to head back to the dorm now. Yamashiro, how about you and Commander?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">{namecode:79}：</span><br>
Um... there's still something I want to do, so I'll head back later! Milord, can you keep me company for a little longer?<br>
<br>
*nods*<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">{namecode:79}：</span><br>
Yay! Milord, please wait a moment!<br>

Chapter 5 - After the Clouds Part<br>
Shortly afterward...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">{namecode:79}：</span><br>
Sorry to keep you waiting, Milord! *cough*!<br>
I wanted to show you the special dance that I talked about before!<br>
Um, to tell you the truth, I've been secretly learning this dance from Fusou! I haven't shown anyone yet, so I have no idea if it looks weird or not...<br>
Therefore, I'd like you to be the first person to see! Um... a shrine maiden's dance has to be performed in the right place after all.<br>
Since we just cleaned the interior, let's head back outside...<br>
<br>
Ding! Ding!<br>
The Kagura bells began to ring---<br>
Though her movements were unrefined, it was clear how much hard work and dedication she had put in.<br>
Ding! Ding!<br>
The Kagura bells rang out again---<br>
Though she's always stumbling around, she's giving off such a spiritual, divine aura.<br>
Ding! Ding! Pitter... Patter...<br>
Huh...?<br>
The ringing of bells... was soon joined by the sound of rain.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">{namecode:79}：</span><br>
W-woahhhh!<br>
<br>
Grab Yamashiro and run inside<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">{namecode:79}：</span><br>
Milord? Ah... alright! Let's avoid getting soaked first!<br>

<br>
Chapter 6 - Rain Shower<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">{namecode:79}：</span><br>
Fwahhh... I'm all wet now... Milord, here's a towel for you!<br>
<br>
Yamashiro handed me a dry towel while drying her hair with her own towel.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">{namecode:79}：</span><br>
Fusou always told me to come prepared in case it suddenly started raining. I guess it came in handy today...<br>
Umm... something to change into, something to change into... Here it is! Give me just a-<br>
Uuu... Milord, you're also here... I-I'm sorry...<br>
<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项1：Turn around without saying anything</span>'''''<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项2：Head for the door</span>'''''<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">{namecode:79}：</span><br>
Milord? It's still raining outside!<br>
Um, umm... C-come back here, it's fine, really...<br>
All right, Milord! You can turn around now!<br>
Sorry, I only have enough clothes for myself... but there are still fresh towels...<br>
It's a shame that I couldn't finish my dance, though...<br>
<br>
I sat next to Yamashiro and quietly ruffled her hair<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">{namecode:79}：</span><br>
Ehehe... why does it mean so much to me? Mm, I suppose I haven't told you before?<br>
The first reason is that I want to ease some of my sister's burdens and responsibilities. The second reason is because, well, you know how Fusou and I have bad luck? Akashi said that it might be because people call us "unlucky ships."<br>
But I think that... as ships, even if we had an unlucky service history, we can't forget about the lives and effort of the people involved...<br>
So, we should work hard to become happy and fortunate, to repay all those people for giving us this life...<br>
<br>
And with that, the rain began to pass.<br>

Yamashiro! Commander! Are you two alright?<br>
Oh my...! Heehee~<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">{namecode:79}：</span><br>
Fusou!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">{namecode:78}：</span><br>
Hmm, since it started raining before the two of you got back, I came to bring you some umbrellas...<br>
But it looks like we won't need these anymore~♪<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">{namecode:79}：</span><br>
Jeez, Fusou! But, thank you...<br>
Hm? Look over there... it's a rainbow! Fusou, Milord, look, a rainbow!<br>
<br>
Yamashiro took my hand and pulled me outside---<br>
Above the gates of the shrine that these two sisters had painstakingly built sat a small rainbow.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">{namecode:79}：</span><br>
Milord, there's something I forgot to tell you earlier.<br>
Right now, I feel like the luckiest girl in the world!<br>
Because right here, I can be with my sister, my friends, and the person I love the most!<br>
<br>
With that, Yamashiro turned towards me and ---<br>
*mwah~*<br>
I felt her soft lips press against my cheek.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">{namecode:79}：</span><br>
That's why... today, tomorrow, there will be nothing but blue skies!<br>
Right, Milord~♪<br>
