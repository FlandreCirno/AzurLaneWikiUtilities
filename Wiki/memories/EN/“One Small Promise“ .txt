Hrmm... we've been out this long and still not a single target...<br>
nothing but icebergs. Not even a whale. I'm guessing faulty intelligence?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">U-557：</span><br>
Even an ace submarine comes back empty-handed every once in a while<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">U-556：</span><br>
Then am I just unlucky? Everybody at the port's been saying I'm such a lucky girl.<br>
What happens when I come back from my first sortie with nothing to show for it? I couldn't face Lord Bismarck like that!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">U-557：</span><br>
Seems we're not so unlucky after all. I've got a contact on sonar.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">U-556：</span><br>
Where?!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">U-557：</span><br>
Target transport ship off our bow, bearing 040, advancing...<br>
... Prepare to dive!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">U-556：</span><br>
Witness... the first majestic battle of Unterseeritter U-556!<br>
Ooohh! Such an invigorating feeling... coursing through my entire body!! I feel fantastic!!!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">U-557：</span><br>
Shhhh! Quiet down... We need to dive before they see us.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">U-556：</span><br>
(Whispering) Understood! Unterseeritter U-556, commencing operation.<br>

<span style="color:#4eb24e;">U-556：</span><br>
Ahahaha! Didn't even break a sweat!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">U-557：</span><br>
It was just a small transport fleet. They didn't even have anti-submarine capabilities.<br>
Maybe you actually are blessed with luck, 556.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">U-556：</span><br>
I'll be an ace in no time. And then they'll have to give me the Knight's Cross, maybe even with oak leaves! And then Lord Bismarck will notice me~!<br>
Heheheheeheeee~<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">U-557：</span><br>
No... the transport fleet we just sank was maybe a thousand tons.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">U-556：</span><br>
A thousand tons?! That much?!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">U-557：</span><br>
"That little," you mean... You'd need to break at least a hundred thousand tons to make ace.<br>
And then to be an ace among the aces you'd need something like two hundred thousand...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">U-556：</span><br>
Aaaughh... I suddenly feel like it's so far out of reach...<br>
......<br>
No matter. It's time to prove the goddess of fortune stands with us!<br>
Torpedo reserves still good. 557, let's continue our war patrol!<br>

<span style="color:#4eb24e;">U-556：</span><br>
Phew... that sure was something. Ehehehe~<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">U-557：</span><br>
Conditions in this sector are rapidly deteriorating. With their transports under attack, the enemy is sure to deploy anti-submarine forces.<br>
Also, our torpedo reserves have been depleted. I think we should quit while we're ahead.<br>
<br>
Beep beep... beep beep...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">U-556：</span><br>
Hm? I've got a weird distress signal here...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">U-557：</span><br>
I'm getting it too... They're using an Enigma code, but I can't determine who the sender is.<br>
Could it be a trap? Could the enemy have cracked the Enigma? ... That's impossible.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">U-556：</span><br>
At this point... you don't think it could be Lord Bismarck...?<br>
Gah! I have to see for myself!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">U-557：</span><br>
Wait a second, 556! We're out of torpedoes, remember? What if it's a trap?!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">U-556：</span><br>
557, you head back to port and let them know what happened. I have to go! I made a promise to Lord Bismarck!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">U-557：</span><br>
556...<br>
... Okay. But you have to be careful! If you see an enemy you just dive as deep and as fast as you can!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">U-556：</span><br>
Ehehehe, don't worry about me! The goddess of fortune stands with us!<br>
