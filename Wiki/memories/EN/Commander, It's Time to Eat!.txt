Commander, It's Time to Eat!<br>
<br>
1 Loving Food Therapy<br>
Port - Office<br>
When I open the door to my office as usual, I find things are a little different.<br>
The vase is filled with fragrant flowers, and my pending documents have already been arranged by category.<br>
All of this was done by my new secretary, Chi An, who is currently standing by my desk with a smile.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Chi An：</span><br>
Greetings, Commander.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Morning, you got here even before me today?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Chi An：</span><br>
Indeed I did~ It's my first day, so I came early to give myself time to prepare.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
I was planning to go over your work responsibilities again, but that doesn't seem to be necessary... I'm glad you're settling in well.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Chi An：</span><br>
Heehee~ I've sorted today's documents in order of priority.<br>
Of course, if you have any concerns, feel free to consult with me right away.<br>
<br>
I nod at her, sit down at my desk, and try to gather my thoughts before starting work.<br>
But Chi An approaches with a thoughtful look on her face.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Chi An：</span><br>
By the way... Have you had breakfast yet, Commander?<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Now that you mention it... I've been focused on work and haven't thought about it.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Chi An：</span><br>
Goodness me, that's no good.<br>
As they say, breakfast is the most important meal of the day. Shall I serve it up for you, Commander?<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Eh? You...? Cooking?<br>
Has Lung Wu allowed you back into the kitchen?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Chi An：</span><br>
N-not yet...<br>
But if you say that you want to taste my cooking, I'm sure she'll have no choice but to let me in~☆<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
(Aha... I see her ploy.)<br>
(If it was my day off, I'd be willing to let her try.)<br>
(But I have a mountain of work today. Let's not risk disaster.)<br>
We'll go with a simple breakfast. Can you brew a cup of coffee and bring some toast?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Chi An：</span><br>
Aww... I thought you'd finally let me cook for you...<br>
*sigh*<br>
Looks like I need to redeem myself by showing off some of my skills.<br>
Very well... I'll bring your food right away~<br>
<br>
With a soft smile, she gracefully exits through the doorway.<br>
After a quick breakfast, we dive into our mountain of work.<br>
I finish one stack of documents, close my eyes, and rub my brow to refresh my mind.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Chi An：</span><br>
You've been working hard. Why not lean on me for a little while and relax?<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
It can wait. Let's finish the rest in one last burst.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Chi An：</span><br>
Commander, you should listen to your inner voice a little more.<br>
It's best to let yourself rest when you're tired.<br>
For example, like so...<br>
<br>
Chi An stands up and walks behind me.<br>
Then, she gently leans in, wrapping her arms around me and using her slender fingers to massage the tension from my neck and shoulders.<br>
It feels good, sure, but my mind is drawn by the soft, warm sensation pressed against my back.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Chi An：</span><br>
I understand that you work so hard for the sake of us and the port...<br>
But I'm still beside myself with worry.<br>
Here's an idea. Would you be interested in trying the special treatment I've tailored for your needs?<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Special treatment?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Chi An：</span><br>
That would be... gourmet food therapy, filled with lots of love!♡<br>

<br>
2 Commander, It's Time to Eat!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Chi An：</span><br>
Here's an idea. Would you be interested in trying the special treatment I've tailored for your needs?<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Special treatment?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Chi An：</span><br>
That would be... gourmet food therapy, filled with lots of love!♡<br>
<br>
Chi An leans over and whispers into my ear.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Chi An：</span><br>
But I can't do it without your special permission to use the kitchen...<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
...<br>
(No matter how I try, it comes to this.)<br>
(I suppose my only choice is to steel myself.)<br>
Sounds nice. How about we do it on our next day off?<br>
You've been busy too, and I don't want to overwork you.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Chi An：</span><br>
Aww, how sweet of you... I'm SO moved~<br>
You just look forward to my nutritious, nourishing, love-filled cooking, okay?<br>
<br>
After expressing my excitement, I resume work with Chi An.<br>
A few days of peace pass... until the dreaded day off finally comes.<br>
Port - Corridor<br>
BANG!<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
What was that? Did someone just set off fireworks?<br>
<br>
Before I can ascertain the cause, it's followed by more loud noises.<br>
BOOM! BANG! BOOM!<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
It's shaking the ground, too?!<br>
<br>
Instantly after, alarms ring all throughout the port.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Hu Pen：</span><br>
Aaaaah, Commander! Commandeeer!<br>
Has anyone seen the Commander?! Commander! Save meee!<br>
<br>
An orange-haired girl comes dashing through the corridor in a panic.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Hu Pen：</span><br>
Oh! There you are!<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
What in the world is going on?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Hu Pen：</span><br>
Okay, so, uh, the kitchen is in danger... No. In CRISIS!<br>
This morning, Chi An came to the kitchen... and she said she had special permission from you!<br>
And Lung Wu ACTUALLY let her in!<br>
And then... Oh, man...<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Wait a minute. Are you saying Chi An caused all those bangs and booms?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Hu Pen：</span><br>
Go see for yourself! Please, you have to stop her!<br>
Oooh... Lung Wu told me to keep an eye on her while she went shopping, and it's a disaster now... She's gonna be so mad when she gets home!<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Don't panic. Let's go see what's going on.<br>
<br>
I follow Hu Pen into the kitchen and find a bunch of people standing at the entrance.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Fu Shun：</span><br>
This is real bad news... Huan Ch'ang, what did your hexagrams tell you?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Huan Ch'ang：</span><br>
This must be solved by our own hands. We cannot get the Commander involved in it.<br>
If the Commander is forced to intervene...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Hu Pen：</span><br>
Fu Shun! Huan Ch'ang! I brought the Commander!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Huan Ch'ang：</span><br>
...This is really bad.<br>
<br>
When Huan Ch'ang sees me, her masked eyes flash with both worry and regret.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Huan Ch'ang：</span><br>
Alas, it seems that's a fate the Commander has to face today.<br>
If there's no escaping it, then let it be misfortune that leads to fortune.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Sorry, what?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Huan Ch'ang：</span><br>
Nothing. Before you enter, please take this.<br>
<br>
Huan Ch'ang produces a gas mask and shoves it into my hands.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
It's my fault this happened, so it makes sense that I should fix it...<br>
But surely a gas mask is going too far, right?<br>
<br>
She shakes her head, then nods.<br>
I reluctantly accept the gas mask, but I decide not to put it on yet.<br>
Thus, after taking a deep breath, I step forth and open the door.<br>
The central kitchen is filled with smoke. Sprinklers rain down on the room, but they can't stop the burnt smell and the dangerous aura emanating from within.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Chi An：</span><br>
Oh, my. I didn't think you'd be here so soon.<br>
Were you so impatient...?<br>
<br>
Chi An's cheeks are just slightly flushed as she emerges from the smoke.<br>
She takes my hand, interlocking her fingers with mine as she leads me to the kitchen table.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Chi An：</span><br>
It was an arduous process, yes... But I'm certain that my lovingly cooked meal will soothe your fatigue, Commander~<br>
<br>
The smoke clears a bit, revealing her twisted masterpieces.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
...<br>
<br>
On the table sits a soup bowl filled with a bluish-purple liquid and unidentifiable ingredients.<br>
Dark smoke billows from it and the surrounding plates, each topped with some kind of distorted, seemingly twitching mass.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
You... made them all?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Chi An：</span><br>
Yes! Nutritious soup, and my own secret stir-fry recipe.<br>
Go on, Commander. Here are your chopsticks~<br>
<br>
With Chi An's expectant gaze upon me, I silently accept the chopsticks she offers and...<br>
...In the end, her terrifying, indescribable cuisine overcomes both my taste buds and my sanity.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Chi An：</span><br>
Commander? Commander! Why did you just collapse?!<br>

Commander, It's Time to Eat!<br>
<br>
3 How to Make Tasty Food!<br>
A warm feeling cradles the back of my head, and a panicked and guilty voice reaches my ears.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Hmm...?<br>
<br>
When I open my eyes, I see Chi An's face right in front of me.<br>
My head seems to be lying in her lap.<br>
<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项1：(Get up.)</span>'''''<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项2：(Stay still.)</span>'''''<br>
<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项1）</span>'''''Understanding the situation, I try to sit up.<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项1）</span>'''''But when I move even a little, she pulls me back to my previous position.<br>
<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项2）</span>'''''Before I can try to sit up, pain shoots through my temples, forcing me back down.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Chi An：</span><br>
Aww, you just woke up. Why not stay a little while?<br>
You just collapsed out of nowhere. It scared me so badly, you know.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Oh...<br>
<br>
I think for a moment, carefully picking words that won't hurt her feelings.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
I think I was just too tired. I'm fine now, though.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Chi An：</span><br>
I'm glad, but I just hope my special recipe served as some kind of comfort for you...<br>
Right after it happened, my sisters rushed in and threw away all of my food. *sob*...<br>
<br>
Upon hearing that, I quickly sit up and look around.<br>
The... "striking" food that she'd served me was all gone, as if it had never been there.<br>
Fresh air filled the kitchen, leaving no traces of the turbid odor from before.<br>
The kitchen table is spotless again, with fresh veggies neatly organized on plates.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
I see.<br>
Did it soothe me? I think so. In a way, it was shockingly delicious.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Chi An：</span><br>
Phew... I'm so happy to hear that! I'll cook for you often from now on.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Hold it.<br>
Now is the perfect opportunity. Can I watch you cook? We already have all the ingredients.<br>
(I seriously need to figure out how the hell this is happening.)<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Chi An：</span><br>
But after they cleaned the kitchen, they said Lung Wu would be back soon...<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
It's okay. I'll explain everything to her. You just show me your skills.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Chi An：</span><br>
If you say so... I would be happy to~<br>
Stand behind me, Commander.<br>
Lung Wu taught me that the kitchen is as dangerous as a battlefield!<br>
<br>
The human brain has a defensive feature called motivated forgetting.<br>
No doubt that's what led to me forgetting everything I saw after that.<br>
Fortunately, the kitchen wasn't utterly destroyed by her acts. However...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Chi An：</span><br>
Huh? Why did the food in my pan just disappear? Isn't stir-frying supposed to be done on high heat?<br>
Why did it all burn away? Oh, no...<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
(I have no other choice. Someone needs to teach her how to cook, step by step.)<br>
(Her sisters seem to have given up on her entirely, and it's not really appropriate for the girls from other factions to help either.)<br>
(At this rate, she'll never be able to enter the kitchen and naturally won't have the chance to properly hone her skills...)<br>
Hmm... I think I have an idea.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Chi An：</span><br>
Oh? What is it?<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
We're going to have cooking drills until you're good enough to go into the kitchen on your own.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Chi An：</span><br>
Cooking drills?<br>

<br>
4 Cooking Drills<br>
After a quick kitchen cleanup, I brought the confused Chi An back to my office.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Chi An：</span><br>
Aren't we doing cooking drills? Why are we in your office...?<br>
Oh! Are your secret recipes hidden in here, Commander? Are you planning to share them with me?<br>
Heehee, thank you in advance for your trust! I'll make sure to thoroughly learn all about your preferences!<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
I appreciate your enthusiasm, but we're here so you can learn how to handle ingredients.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Chi An：</span><br>
Huh? In your office?<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Yep. This is the most suitable place for you to learn at your level.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Chi An：</span><br>
But this is where you work. If I make a mess...<br>
...I see.<br>
You chose this room because you knew I'd do everything I could to avoid ruining it.<br>
That means I have to handle ingredients with the utmost care.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
You got it. We're going to start with learning how to treat ingredients gently.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Chi An：</span><br>
What interesting training~ Only a sweetie like you would come up with this, Commander.<br>
I look forward to your lessons♪<br>
<br>
Her handling of the ingredients is much smoother this time than I remember.<br>
But, perhaps because it's her first time being so careful, she breaks out into a sweat as soon as she finishes the first step.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Chi An：</span><br>
I'm so embarrassed... to be this flustered.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
You're doing well. This is a great start.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Chi An：</span><br>
Thank you for your compliment, but I really don't think we can go any further in your office...<br>
You can say it's okay, but I must refuse. What if I make the room smell bad forever?<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
That's true. Sorry to drag you all over the place, but let's go back to the kitchen now.<br>
<br>
With prepared ingredients in hand, we once again returned to the kitchen.<br>
Once everything is prepared, I begin demonstrating to Chi An while explaining what I'm doing.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
When you put ingredients in the pan, you want as little moisture as possible.<br>
That's to avoid hot oil splashing everywhere when it comes in contact with water.<br>
Then, gently push the ingredients into the oil from the inside out to ensure they cook evenly.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Chi An：</span><br>
The oil isn't splashing around at all... Goodness, Commander, you're a perfect chef!<br>
I see, I see... Yes, I think I understand now!<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Alright. I'll bring another pan for you to work on.<br>
<br>
She thus begins cooking as instructed.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Hmm... You've drained enough moisture, and your movements are steady now. You should be fine–<br>
<br>
I'm interrupted, however, by flames rising from the pan and oil splashing everywhere.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Chi An：</span><br>
Ah! C-Commander, get behind me!<br>

5 Never Give Up!<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Hmm...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Chi An：</span><br>
Mm...<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Frankly, I'm stumped.<br>
You're keeping to the process and to my warnings. How did this happen?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Chi An：</span><br>
*sigh*... Why is it always like this when I'm so close to doing it right?<br>
<br>
After putting out the fire, the two of us looked at each other and fell silent.<br>
While I'm thinking of how to solve this conundrum, she suddenly grasps my hand.<br>
Her eyes gaze searchingly into mine.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Chi An：</span><br>
Commander...<br>
...Did I do something wrong?<br>
I just wanted you to get proper nutrition even while you're busy at work.<br>
That's why I asked for your permission to use the kitchen. But I only ended up causing trouble for you and everyone else in the end...<br>
I'm supposed to be the one who solves your troubles, not makes them.<br>
Commander... Should I just give up on cooking entirely?<br>
<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项1：(Encourage her to keep trying.)</span>'''''<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项2：(Support her decision.)</span>'''''<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项1）</span>'''''It's too early to give up.<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项1）</span>'''''I offered to train you because I sensed genuine concern in your words.<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项1）</span>'''''You don't want to throw in the towel halfway through, do you?<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项2）</span>'''''Give up or not, I respect and support your decision.<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项2）</span>'''''But in my personal opinion, I don't want you to give up on what you love.<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项2）</span>'''''Don't make a decision you'll regret.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Chi An：</span><br>
Commander... I want to be by your side forever.<br>
In our future together, I don't want you to look back on today with any unhappiness.<br>
But... If you're still willing to help me...<br>
Then I want to make food that will make you genuinely happy!<br>
Um... I may be dreaming too big.<br>
Hmm, let me correct myself: first, I want to earn the right to use the kitchen without causing trouble for others!<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Then it sounds like we'll continue our training.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Chi An：</span><br>
Okay!<br>

<br>
6 From Your Stomach to Your Heart<br>
After that, we immersed ourselves in the kitchen together.<br>
From cooking to baking, I guided Chi An through every step to ensure she grasped all the basics.<br>
We stayed there until late at night before finally leaving.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Chi An：</span><br>
Thanks to you, Commander, I've learned so many things.<br>
Even the most fundamental parts of cooking are so elaborate...<br>
I knew I shouldn't have just learned by watching Lung Wu.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Hm? You only learned by watching?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Chi An：</span><br>
Umm... Before she forbade me from entering the kitchen, I asked her to teach me.<br>
She then showed me and said I could ask about anything I didn't understand, but just by watching, I thought I understood them all. I even had an unearned confidence.<br>
And then.... well, I ended up being banned from the kitchen. Aww♪<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
I see...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Chi An：</span><br>
But be at ease now. Tomorrow, I'll put my newfound skills to use and treat you to a delicious meal again.<br>
I'm certain it'll work out this time!<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Someone's confident.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Chi An：</span><br>
Because your training has helped me discover the most essential ingredient that makes food truly delicious, Commander.<br>
In reality... I started cooking not just to make sure you get enough nutrition.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
What does that mean?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Chi An：</span><br>
My scheme was to seize your heart with my delicious food.<br>
So through our studies today, I learned...<br>
What matters isn't the food itself, or even the scheme that I was using it for...<br>
<br>
She draws out her words, intentionally stopping herself before the most important part, all while wearing a sly grin.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Chi An：</span><br>
Hmm... Maybe it's too early to tell you.<br>
The secret shall be revealed when you come to see the fruits of my training tomorrow!<br>

<br>
7 The Secret Ingredient: Love<br>
I didn't see Chi An at all the next work day.<br>
It was when I left my office in the evening that I happened to run into her in the hallway.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Chi An：</span><br>
Oh, my. Impatient to eat my cooking again, Commander?<br>
<br>
Before I could ask her what she'd made, she dragged me to her room, promising a surprise.<br>
Port - Chi An's Room<br>
Her thorough preparations are evident as she's even closed her curtains, leaving the room too dark to see anything.<br>
My inability to see makes her warm breath against my ear stand out even more.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Chi An：</span><br>
Are you ready for my surprise, Commander?<br>
Heehee. Here it comes...<br>
<br>
When she flips on the lights, I see several dishes under plate covers.<br>
Chi An smiles and gently lifts the covers, revealing food that looks as good as it smells.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
(Hmm... Well, it doesn't LOOK bad.)<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Chi An：</span><br>
A sight for sore eyes, isn't it, Commander?<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
It definitely looks a lot better than the last time.<br>
(I'd just about call this a miracle.)<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Chi An：</span><br>
Compliment me all you like. Heehee.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
After I taste-test it, sure.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Chi An：</span><br>
Heehee, you're a tough customer. Then without further ado...<br>
<br>
I accept the utensils from her and glance at the dishes before me. I'm stricken by incredible emotion.<br>
This is the ultimate result of so much time and effort. Of so many trials overcome.<br>
I have total faith that it won't betray my expectations.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
*gasp*<br>
<br>
A flavor beyond the reach of human language fills my mouth.<br>
My senses of sight and taste send contradictory signals, leading to an intense debate between my brain and tongue.<br>
I struggle to swallow it. If my stomach had a mouth, it would scream.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Chi An：</span><br>
C-Commander, are you okay?<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
*cough*... *hack*... Give me a second...<br>
<br>
I'm bearing the weight of her expectations. How could I tell her the truth? I can't.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Mmm... Well. It's hard to express how it tastes.<br>
It's juicy... and very rich, I'll give you that.<br>
Personally, I consider it... not bad.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Chi An：</span><br>
Heehee. Of course.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Why are you laughing?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Chi An：</span><br>
Because you're too kind to me.<br>
You said it's "not bad," but that's not the truth, is it?<br>
You're desperately trying to hide it, but your eyes don't lie.<br>
You've indulged me so much and supported me unwaveringly when I was about to give up.<br>
As someone who usually listens to other's troubles, it means so much to me that you've gone to such lengths to solve my own problem.<br>
<br>
She leans in close and holds my face in both hands.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Chi An：</span><br>
It may not taste as good as we'd hoped... but you've eaten the food that I put all my heart into.<br>
Now, it's my turn.<br>
To say what I couldn't say last night...<br>
<br>
She unbuttons my shirt starting from the collar down, and the rest of her words fade between our lips.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Chi An：</span><br>
The only therapy I need... is you♡<br>
