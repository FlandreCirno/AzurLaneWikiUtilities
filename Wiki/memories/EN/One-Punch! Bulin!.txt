One-Punch! Bulin!<br>
<br>
1.An Ancient Legend<br>
Legends speak of a god in far-off lands who will grant any wish you can imagine.<br>
However, a legend is all it is. A legend from long, long ago...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Universal Bulin：</span><br>
Any wish you can imagine, bulin?<br>
Nuh-uh, that's impossible, bulin! Not even my almighty wrench can do that, bulin!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Prototype Bulin MKII：</span><br>
Even if that god does exist, they live in some unreachably distant place, bulin!<br>
Even my drill that pierces the heavens can't take you THAT far, bulin!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Specialized Bulin Custom MKIII：</span><br>
Not with that attitude it won't, bulin!<br>
My godly luck tells me the legend is real, bulin!<br>
I'll prove it, even if I have to defy the universe itself, bulin!<br>
<br>
With those words, the defiant MKIII Bulin walked away.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Universal Bulin：</span><br>
Whoa, bulin! She sounded mad, bulin...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Prototype Bulin MKII：</span><br>
We ought to support her, bulin! Let's get her the strongest hammer around and go on an adventure, bulin!<br>
I know a hammer that can turn even diamonds into dust, bulin! I'm gonna find it, bulin!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Universal Bulin：</span><br>
Sounds like an awesome idea, bulin!<br>
I'm the bestest treasure hunter alive, bulin! I'm going with you, bulin!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;"><size=28>Universal Bulin & Prototype Bulin MKII</size>：</span><br>
I'll find that hammer if it's the last thing I do, bulin!<br>
<br>
And so, the three Bulin sisters went off on their separate adventures.<br>
One fateful day, they would reunite...<br>

One-Punch! Bulin!<br>
<br>
2.Hard Work Pays Off<br>
The MKIII Bulin has been training day in, day out ever since she first set off on her quest.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Specialized Bulin Custom MKIII：</span><br>
Feel the might of my Kitty Kabam Hammer, bulin!<br>
I did it, bulin! I've become the strongest girl alive, bulin!<br>
My daily workout routine of 100 situps, 100 pushups, 100 squats, and a 10-kilometer run has turned me into a demigod, bulin!<br>
But my Kitty Kabam Hammer has reached its physical limits, bulin... I need a new, stronger weapon that can withstand my power, bulin!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Universal Bulin：</span><br>
Good news for you, bulin! We've found clues as to where the legendary Ultra Rainbow Hammer is!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Prototype Bulin MKII：</span><br>
You'd be invincible if you had that, bulin!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Specialized Bulin Custom MKIII：</span><br>
Really, bulin?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Prototype Bulin MKII：</span><br>
Really-deally, bulin! It's in the Site of Trials, bulin! Pass all the trials and the hammer will be yours, bulin!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Specialized Bulin Custom MKIII：</span><br>
Easy peasy, bulin! I've been training for something like this, bulin!<br>

One-Punch! Bulin!<br>
<br>
3.The Site of Trials<br>
By working together, the three Bulin sisters managed to pass all the trials.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Universal Bulin：</span><br>
That was the last one, bulin! We got a key, bulin!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Prototype Bulin MKII：</span><br>
And there's a treasure chest here, bulin! Open it, bulin!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Specialized Bulin Custom MKIII：</span><br>
Okay, bulin! Here we go, bulin!<br>
<br>
Opening the box released a blinding rainbow light which pierced the skies.<br>
Item obtained: Ultra Rainbow Hammer.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Specialized Bulin Custom MKIII：</span><br>
Look at that light, bulin! This thing must be amazingly powerful, bulin!<br>
And now it's in my hands, bulin!<br>
<br>
While the sisters cheered and celebrated, a stranger approached from the dark.<br>
<span style="color:#ec5d53;">Lord of Evil：</span><br>
What the hell is all this ruckus about?<br>
Ah... Adventurers. You're after the legendary hammer, are you?<br>
Well, bad news for you. If you want to keep it, you've gotta get through me!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Prototype Bulin MKII：</span><br>
The big baddie has appeared, bulin! She wants to take our hard-earned loot, bulin!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Universal Bulin：</span><br>
Like that's gonna happen, bulin! Give her a taste of the hammer's might, bulin!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Specialized Bulin Custom MKIII：</span><br>
Come here, bulin! I'm gonna squash you like a bug, bulin!<br>
...What the heck, bulin? The hammer isn't doing anything, bulin!<br>
<span style="color:#ec5d53;">Lord of Evil：</span><br>
Hahah! You didn't know? The Ultra Rainbow Hammer is an energy weapon! You've gotta charge it, idiot!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Prototype Bulin MKII：</span><br>
Okay, bulin! We'll keep her distracted, bulin! Charge up the hammer quickly, bulin!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;"><size=28>Universal Bulin & Prototype Bulin MKII</size>：</span><br>
Let's see what you've got, bulin!<br>
<br>
<br>
The Bulin sisters fought, but their best efforts weren't enough to trump their adversary.<br>
<span style="color:#ec5d53;">Lord of Evil：</span><br>
Your attacks are useless! Ahahahah!<br>
No one, and I mean no one on this earth can bring out the hammer's power!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Universal Bulin：</span><br>
You're wrong, bulin! Our sister's the strongest person alive, bulin!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Prototype Bulin MKII：</span><br>
She'll put you in your stupid rightful place, bulin!<br>
<span style="color:#ec5d53;">Lord of Evil：</span><br>
Try it! Struggle all you want, then despair!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Specialized Bulin Custom MKIII：</span><br>
You'll be the one to despair, bulin! My hammer is at full charge, bulin!<br>
<span style="color:#ec5d53;">Lord of Evil：</span><br>
What?! That's impossible!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Prototype Bulin MKII：</span><br>
Great job, bulin! Let's wale on her until she cries for mama, bulin!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Specialized Bulin Custom MKIII：</span><br>
Follow my lead, bulin! Show her what we bulins are capable of, bulin!<br>
<br>
<br>
The Ultra Rainbow Hammer's mighty attacks wore away at the Lord of Evil's will to battle.<br>
<span style="color:#ec5d53;">Lord of Evil：</span><br>
Screw it! This is unfair! I'm outta here!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Universal Bulin：</span><br>
She has her back turned, bulin!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Prototype Bulin MKII：</span><br>
Now's our chance, bulin! Gang up on her, bulin!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Specialized Bulin Custom MKIII：</span><br>
Hope you like the taste of rainbow punch, bulin!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">All Three Bulins：</span><br>
- This is the blow that pierces the earth, bulin! - This is the blow that pierces the heavens, bulin! - This is the blow that strikes down the stars, bulin!<br>
<br>
The hammer glowed with all the colors of the rainbow, and the Bulin sisters' strength converged into a single beam of light that outshone even the stars.<br>
KABOOOOOOOM!<br>
......<br>
.........<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Prototype Bulin MKII：</span><br>
Victory is ours, bulin! We vanquished the big baddie, bulin!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Specialized Bulin Custom MKIII：</span><br>
But at what cost, bulin? The hammer's light is gone, bulin...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Universal Bulin：</span><br>
Oh no... Did it break, bulin?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Specialized Bulin Custom MKIII：</span><br>
Oh well, it's still a nice trophy, bulin! Besides, our combined strength felt stronger than even the hammer, bulin!<br>
Now we have to celebrate our triumph, bulin. Let's go for barbecue, bulin!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;"><size=28>Universal Bulin & Prototype Bulin MKII</size>：</span><br>
Hooray, bulin!<br>
<br>
And so, the Bulin sisters left to treat themselves to first-rate barbecue.<br>
As for the legend that inspired their adventure... It remains only a tale to this day.<br>
