Together with Souryuu<br>
<br>
Chapter 1: Be Careful What You Wish For<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Souryuu：</span><br>
My name is Souryuu. Commander, from now on, please request my permission in writing before doing anything weird.<br>
<br>
Ever since we first met, I've always been drawn to her cold, dignified seriousness.<br>
Thinking that she might be able to help increase my work efficiency, I appointed her as my secretary to see how things would go...<br>
Port - Office<br>
That morning, when I arrived at the office...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Souryuu：</span><br>
Good morning, Commander. I have already sorted all your documents, so please begin reviewing them.<br>
<br>
Right away, I knew she had no intent on showing me any mercy...<br>
<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项1：Try to strike up some small talk with Souryuu.</span>'''''<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Souryuu：</span><br>
Commander, please refrain from idle chatter while you're working. There's a lot to get through today.<br>
<br>
I was rebuked coldly.<br>
... I'm getting a bit tired. Maybe it's time to take a break...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Souryuu：</span><br>
Commander, all my planes have already locked onto you.<br>
During work hours, please make sure that you're actually working.<br>
<br>
I heard the churning engines of aircraft circling above my head... How terrifying...<br>
My attempts to strike up friendly conversation with Souryuu had backfired spectacularly.<br>
Nevertheless, under her watchful eye, my productivity had undeniably skyrocketed.<br>
Would I be able to convince her to be a little more easygoing if we were on better terms?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Souryuu：</span><br>
Commander, surely you aren't daydreaming about weird things while pretending to read your documents?<br>
<br>
... I guess I have no choice but to focus on the work in front of me first.<br>

<br>
Chapter 2: Instruct Me, Souryuu!<br>
I heard that Souryuu's hobby was playing hanafuda, so I decided to learn it as a way of finding some common ground with her.<br>
Port - Sakura Dorms<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Souryuu：</span><br>
... Today, we'll be going over the Battle of Okehazama.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Urakaze：</span><br>
Hmm... At last, the great battle that led to the country's unification!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Souryuu：</span><br>
At that time, the Imagawa clan had a numbers advantage... Oh my, Commander. What brings you here?<br>
<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项1：Ask what she is doing.</span>'''''<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Urakaze：</span><br>
Isn't it obvious? It's a history lesson!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Souryuu：</span><br>
Indeed. Urakaze wants to deepen her understanding of the Sengoku period, so I'm giving her a lesson.<br>
Commander, you're welcome to join if you're interested.<br>
I suppose it wouldn't hurt to listen.<br>
... Nobody could have foreseen that Imagawa Yoshimoto would be slain by Nobunaga's attack.<br>
In the aftermath of the battle, the Oda clan...<br>
... All right, that concludes today's lesson.<br>
<br>
Amazing... Souryuu's lesson was informative, but also very easy to follow.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Urakaze：</span><br>
Hm, hm... I see! Thank you very much, teacher!<br>
Teach us something else next!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Souryuu：</span><br>
Of course. It would be my pleasure.<br>
<br>
Something else...? I was beginning to think that Souryuu knew everything...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Souryuu：</span><br>
Commander, your thoughts are written all over your face... This is simply part of a secretary's duties.<br>
Now, did you need something?<br>
<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项1："Could you teach me hanafuda?"</span>'''''<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Souryuu：</span><br>
You want to learn hanafuda? Why the sudden interest...?<br>
However, if you are genuinely interested in learning, I wouldn't mind teaching you...<br>
<br>
And thus, I began to learn hanafuda from Souryuu.<br>

Together with Souryuu<br>
<br>
Chapter 3: What are Friends?<br>
As a natural result of having her teach me hanafuda, I found more and more time to converse with Souryuu.<br>
I decided to head over to her place again today.<br>
Sakura Dorms - Souryuu's Room<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Souryuu：</span><br>
Why'd you come here by yourself, Z23? Aren't you usually always with your friends?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Z23：</span><br>
Ahaha... I wouldn't say "always." Even I need some time for myself now and then.<br>
And even though we're good friends, we sometimes get on each others' nerves.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Souryuu：</span><br>
You have a point. I imagine it can be hard to deal with Ayanami and Laffey since they like to do things at their own pace.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Z23：</span><br>
Ah, um, it's not that bad. Compared to us, I'd say that the Sakura carriers have more than their fair share of... strong personalities.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Souryuu：</span><br>
You don't have to pull your punches. *sigh*... We definitely do have a handful of oddballs...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Z23：</span><br>
Ahaha... I feel like we have a lot of common ground. Don't you ever get tired of dealing with the others?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Souryuu：</span><br>
I wouldn't say I get tired, but... Kaga's obsessed with combat, and let's not talk about Akagi...<br>
Shoukaku won't stop poking and prodding at Akagi, and Zuikaku is a bit like my sister. Way too much energy.<br>
*sigh*... Sometimes, I wonder if my reputation as a workaholic resulted from having to clean up after them...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Z23：</span><br>
Ahaha...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Souryuu：</span><br>
You know what they say, "you don't get to choose your own family." But, looking back, I don't think I'd want it any other way.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Z23：</span><br>
I totally get it, "we're friends after all!" "Who the hell are you calling your friend?!" That kind of dynamic!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Souryuu：</span><br>
I think it's a bit different for us. I wouldn't even say that we're "friends."<br>
But, there is a deeper bond connecting all of us.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Z23：</span><br>
A relationship that can't be described by words... That sounds a bit enviable when you put it that way.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Souryuu：</span><br>
I'm also a bit jealous of you and your friends. Hehe.<br>
But more importantly... Commander, didn't anyone ever teach you that it's rude to eavesdrop?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Z23：</span><br>
Ah... Good morning, Commander!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Souryuu：</span><br>
Good grief... But since you're already here, we might as well chat for a bit.<br>
<br>
Time flew as the three of us chatted the day away.<br>

Chapter 4: Unnecessary Things...?<br>
Port - Sakura Dorms<br>
On my day off, I once again found myself headed for Souryuu's room, looking to relax and recover.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Hiryuu：</span><br>
Did you need to see my sister?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Souryuu：</span><br>
Commander, though you're free to spend your day off however you please, I'd recommend you do something more worthwhile.<br>
As she spoke, she was still working on documents that she had brought back from the office yesterday. Truly a model secretary.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Hiryuu：</span><br>
*sigh*...<br>
I wonder when I'll be able to help the Commander like this...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Souryuu：</span><br>
If that's what you really want, you'd better start studying harder from now on.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Hiryuu：</span><br>
That's not what I meant... When you're working hard like this, you look really beautiful. Don't you think so too, Commander?<br>
<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项1："I agree."</span>'''''<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Souryuu：</span><br>
*sigh*... What are you talking about? There's nothing beautiful about this.?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Hiryuu：</span><br>
Err, I dunno, I'm not so great with words... but Akagi said something about "a woman's allure?"<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Souryuu：</span><br>
Listen, Hiryuu. This is simply what is expected of every member of the fleet. My relationship with the Commander has nothing to do with this.<br>
This has nothing to do with a "woman's allure" or that "girlishness" thing that you're always talking about, understood?<br>
Wow... Souryuu was being colder than usual.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Hiryuu：</span><br>
Well, isn't there something that you'd want to do to improve your girlishness?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Souryuu：</span><br>
What are you... why in the world would I want to do something like that?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Hiryuu：</span><br>
Ah, um, hear me out! I really think you're beautiful, Souryuu, and that includes when you're being cold too. However, I sometimes want to see more aspects of your personality!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Souryuu：</span><br>
*sigh*...<br>
But... Hmm. There just might be a way to get me to change.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Hiryuu：</span><br>
Eh? Really?!<br>
<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项1："I'd like to know, too."</span>'''''<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Souryuu：</span><br>
I wonder, what should I do...<br>
<br>
Was it just my imagination, or did Souryuu just steal a sideways glance at me?<br>

Chapter 5 - Change (Pt. 1)<br>
Port - Office<br>
Recently, I feel like I've been able to talk to Souryuu about more and more things.<br>
Of course, she was no less strict during work hours.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Souryuu：</span><br>
Commander, please do your work properly. Don't develop any strange ideas.<br>
<br>
However...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Souryuu：</span><br>
Commander, regarding the next naval exercise...<br>
<br>
……<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Souryuu：</span><br>
You're entrusting the dive bomber training to me? Very well, no objections here. I'll sort out the other details as well.<br>
<br>
As much as I greatly appreciated Souryuu's assistance...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Souryuu：</span><br>
This is your itinerary for the day. Please look over it.<br>
<br>
It felt like I'd taken after her too much and started overworking myself.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Souryuu：</span><br>
I knew you had it in you, Commander. Look what you've been able to accomplish with some focus and hard work.<br>
<br>
Of course, her praise quickly washed away any fatigue I otherwise might have felt.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Souryuu：</span><br>
Com...<br>
<br>
Though at first I only wanted to improve our relationship so she wouldn't be so strict...<br>
Before I knew it, I was starting to become a workaholic just like her.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Souryuu：</span><br>
Comman...<br>
<br>
I guess that's not such a bad thing though...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Souryuu：</span><br>
Commander!<br>
<br>
！<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Souryuu：</span><br>
Good grief, you should stop daydreaming like that.<br>
<br>
I could hardly believe my ears when I heard what Souryuu said next.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Souryuu：</span><br>
By the way, would you like to go on a date this upcoming weekend?<br>

Port - Plaza <br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Souryuu：</span><br>
My apologies, Commander. I didn't keep you waiting, did I?<br>
<br>
I wasn't quite sure what happened, but somehow I ended up on a date(?) with Souryuu.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Souryuu：</span><br>
This is my first time going out like this, so I'm not sure what we should do...<br>
But, I've already picked out some spots to go to based upon your preferences.<br>
<br>
It almost felt as if Souryuu was going to take me on a guided tour.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Souryuu：</span><br>
Shall we get going?<br>
Akashi, here's what we'd like to buy. Shiranui, would you mind bagging everything for us?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Shiranui：</span><br>
Sure...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Akashi：</span><br>
Thank you for your patronyage. H-hope to see you next time, nya...?<br>
<br>
We walked out of the shop with two incredulous gazes following us the entire time.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Hiryuu：</span><br>
S-Souryuu?! Is that you...?!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Souryuu：</span><br>
Good day, Hiryuu. Is something the matter?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Hiryuu：</span><br>
Ah, um, I'm fine. Souryuu, you're...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Souryuu：</span><br>
Indeed. I'm planning to head into town with Commander.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Hiryuu：</span><br>
I-I see...<br>
<br>
I can understand why everyone might be a bit bewildered... After all, Souryuu has had her arm entwined around mine ever since we left.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Souryuu：</span><br>
I apologize for dumping dinner duties on you like this, Hiei.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Hiei：</span><br>
Don't worry about me. Just have a good time together, you two.<br>
<br>
Hiei slipped out of the room with a knowing grin on her face.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Souryuu：</span><br>
Commander, have you been enjoying today's date so far?<br>
<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项1：Nod.</span>'''''<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项2：Nod vigorously.</span>'''''<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Souryuu：</span><br>
Hehe... I'm glad.<br>
<br>
But now I wondered... why did she even ask me out in the first place?<br>

Together with Souryuu<br>
<br>
Chapter 7: Change (Pt. 3)<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Souryuu：</span><br>
Everyone was staring at us incredulously the whole day.<br>
<br>
It's true. Pretty much everyone who saw us today ended up with bewildered expressions on their faces.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Souryuu：</span><br>
Well, the only "me" people expect is the stolid Souryuu that pushes you to work harder.<br>
Of course it'd be hard for them to imagine me smiling happily while on a date.<br>
Naturally, those kinds of assumptions are incorrect.<br>
Souryuu adjusted her glasses and looked my way.<br>
Commander, you've matured into someone who no longer needs my supervision. <br>
Someone who chose to invest their precious time into me so that we could have a shared hobby...<br>
For me to go on a date or two with that person, or even fall in love with that person, is perfectly normal, isn't it?<br>
Despite her tremendously assertive confession, Souryuu did not appear flustered in the slightest.<br>
Commander, do you still remember what Hiryuu and I talked about a while ago?<br>
<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项1：Nod.</span>'''''<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Souryuu：</span><br>
The person who I want to change for... the person who I want to become "girlier" for... is you.<br>
I had assumed that I was getting used to following her lead, but it turns out that I had been influencing her as well.<br>
By the way, Commander, what do you think about me?<br>
My feelings for Souryuu obviously needed no words. But at this crucial moment, when I opened my mouth...<br>
<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项1："Let's head back and play hanafuda!"</span>'''''<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Souryuu：</span><br>
... Pfft...<br>
I see. How very much like you, Commander. Very well, since we began with hanafuda, it makes sense for us to communicate through hanafuda.<br>
If you can beat me even once, I'll tell you anything you want to know.<br>
