Hmmf. I thought we'd have time for some chitchat, but it seems we'll have to do it on the move. Admiral Graf Spee has sunk another freight ship.<br>
It's been 9 hours since the last one. Just before they sunk, I received a telegram from the ship. After 2 months of searching, I've now managed to pinpoint Admiral Graf Spee's location. We'd better start giving chase to her.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Achilles：</span><br>
Hahah, giving chase right away? You never change, huh~ So, where is Spee now?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ajax：</span><br>
It seems she's in the Atlantic near the African coast. Mmmm... Hopefully we can find someone worthy of my harassment along the way. It's been a while since I had some fun... Hehe.<br>
Anyway, our objective is the Río de la Plata Estuary. Chart a course for 32 degrees south and 47 degrees west. Remain highly vigilant and maintain formation at cruising speed. ...We may run into some pests along the way.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Exeter：</span><br>
Now hold on! I've put up with you for months now because you're in charge of this operation...<br>
But here you go again giving us orders you decided on a whim! I want an explanation for why we're doing this!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Achilles：</span><br>
Wuh-oh. Ajax, don't be too mean to Exeter. She's served longer than you have after all...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ajax：</span><br>
Because, Exeter, search missions are boring. Don't you agree? So let's do something else, even if just to kill time... Ahahah♪<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Exeter：</span><br>
Now listen, you!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Achilles：</span><br>
Wait! Exeter, please calm down! You don't need to fight with her to solve this!<br>
I know she's strange, but she's still the smartest Leander-class, so she won't make us go on a pointless mission... I think... Right, Ajax?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ajax：</span><br>
Ahahah. The telegram came from the South Atlantic, and the Río de la Plata is the most prominent route for merchant ships in that area. If you were Graf Spee and wanted to disrupt trade routes, wouldn't you pick a location where you can cause as much damage as possible?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Exeter：</span><br>
If I were her... that... is where I'd go.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ajax：</span><br>
It's good that you understand. Unless I turn out to be wrong, we may even engage enemies on our way there. Ahahah... I hope you won't disappoint me, Graf Spee♪<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Exeter：</span><br>
...Shouldn't we wait for Cumberland?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ajax：</span><br>
We don't have the time. Tell her to catch up to us.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Exeter：</span><br>
...Understood. I'll have faith in your judgement. Just one more thing...<br>
When we're back, I will report everything you've done up to this point to the Admiralty!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ajax：</span><br>
Ahahah, do as you wish.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Achilles：</span><br>
Aha, hahah, I guess you two are starting to get along...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Exeter：</span><br>
You call this "getting along"?!<br>

<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Exeter：</span><br>
I can't believe it, there really is an Iron Blood fleet out here... I hate admitting it, but it seems you were right. We should hurry to the Río de la Plata Estuary and sort them out.<br>
<span style="color:#ff0000;">Leberecht Maass (Z1)：</span><br>
Sorry, girls, but I can't let you pass.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ajax：</span><br>
Ahahah... you must be a Z-class, no?<br>
<span style="color:#ff0000;">Leberecht Maass (Z1)：</span><br>
That's right. You're talking to none other than the 1st ship of the Z-class - Leberecht Maass!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ajax：</span><br>
It must be tough to have so many sisters.<br>
<span style="color:#ff0000;">Leberecht Maass (Z1)：</span><br>
Tough? Uh, not really. I'm honestly blessed to have so many cute little sisters.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ajax：</span><br>
I see. You're a nice big sister to them, just like our sister Leander is to us.<br>
<span style="color:#ff0000;">Leberecht Maass (Z1)：</span><br>
Hey, thanks.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ajax：</span><br>
Shouldn't Graf Spee be arriving at the Río de la Plata Estuary any time now?<br>
<span style="color:#ff0000;">Leberecht Maass (Z1)：</span><br>
Yep. ...Wait, you tryin' to make me look dumb?!<br>
Whatever. At any rate, I'm not letting you through!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ajax：</span><br>
Ahahah, I must've struck a nerve... Now you're worth toying with... Let's go, Exeter!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Exeter：</span><br>
Roger! But strangely enough now I can sympathize with Z1...<br>

<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ajax：</span><br>
Graf Spee has sunk many ships, but she always lets their crews get to safety first... Seeing as she plays nice, I'll let you off the hook now.<br>
<span style="color:#ff0000;">Leberecht Maass (Z1)：</span><br>
Guh... You're a twisted sadist... but... at least you're not all bad...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Exeter：</span><br>
I think she has lost consciousness. Is it really okay to leave her like this?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ajax：</span><br>
As much as I love having more toys to play with... we can't fight Graf Spee with the burden of a captive on our backs.<br>
Or does the "honour of the Crown" dictate that you tow her all the way home?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Exeter：</span><br>
People like you are just... Ugh, fine! We're moving on.<br>

<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ajax：</span><br>
Now, let me explain the plan.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Achilles：</span><br>
I'm all ears!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Exeter：</span><br>
The plan...?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ajax：</span><br>
Surely you don't believe that just the three of us... can pin down an enemy of her caliber? That's not an option, Ms. Exeter. You have a brain, please use it more often~<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Exeter：</span><br>
You... Calm down, Exeter, control yourself... Deep breaths... Sigh... Okay, explain it to me.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ajax：</span><br>
Ahahah, it's simple, really. Should we encounter Graf Spee during daytime, you will break from formation and flank her. But if we encounter her during night then I guess you won't need to flank her, just keep ample distance from her.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Exeter：</span><br>
So one of us acts as a decoy while another launches an attack on her... Won't our firepower lack any real punch that way, though?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ajax：</span><br>
Sinking Graf Spee is not our objective. Have you forgotten that already?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Exeter：</span><br>
...Very well. You're right. I'll follow your orders.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Achilles：</span><br>
Ahahaha~! Now that we have a plan, let's mop up the remnants of the fleet we just fought, then continue the search!<br>

<span style="color:#ff0000;">Admiral Graf Spee：</span><br>
...I was wrong. You aren't merchant ships, you're... hunters...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ajax：</span><br>
Ah, so rather than make use of your cannons' range, you decided to draw closer... Oh ho... you mistook us for yesterday's convey, didn't you? Ahahah, I didn't think the notorious Graf Spee would be so careless...<br>
<span style="color:#ff0000;">Admiral Graf Spee：</span><br>
...Even so... you can't defeat me.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Exeter：</span><br>
I wouldn't be so sure about that!<br>
<span style="color:#ff0000;">Admiral Graf Spee：</span><br>
Flanking me, huh... You must think you're so clever!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ajax：</span><br>
You don't know if something is clever until you try it. ...Let's get her, Achilles.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Achilles：</span><br>
Aye-aye, ma'am!<br>

<span style="color:#ff0000;">Admiral Graf Spee：</span><br>
Dammit... You leave me no choice...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Exeter：</span><br>
You're not going anywh—AGGGHHH...!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Achilles：</span><br>
Oh my god! Exeter, are you okay?!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Exeter：</span><br>
...Guh... Looks like... she got...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ajax：</span><br>
Hm? She's turning to flee...<br>
I see... Exeter, you should head straight back home for repairs. Achilles and I will pursue Graf Spee.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Exeter：</span><br>
Wait. She's getting away, but just the two of you can't... Argh, I can... I'm gonna... ram the bastard.... It will be the end of us... but it will sink her too!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ajax：</span><br>
In your current state, you'll only be a hindrance to us. And you can still be repaired. That's just how it is. Besides...<br>
I'm not going to concede the feat of sinking Graf Spee that easily.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Exeter：</span><br>
But...!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ajax：</span><br>
Ahahah. How about worrying about your own wellbeing before that of others?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Exeter：</span><br>
...Very well... I will pray for your success.<br>

<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Achilles：</span><br>
But... it's just the two of us now... you saw what she did to Exeter... and two of your turrets don't function... are we really going after her?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ajax：</span><br>
Of course we are. Please remember that our allies are right behind us.<br>
Even if we're not able to sink her, if we can severely damage and corner her then our blockade will prevent her from returning to drydock for repairs.<br>
If we can achieve that, we win. And if we can bring her down on our own, we won't even need to ask the others for help.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Achilles：</span><br>
So... this was your plan all along, wasn't it? You even let Z1 go because you counted on our blockade up ahead to stop both her and Graf Spee, right?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ajax：</span><br>
It wasn't. If a blockade was all that was needed to contain Graf Spee... then we need not have gotten involved in the first place.<br>
Besides, now we're rid of that oversized paperweight that was slowing us down. And if she's in so much pain, she won't be able to leave the docks for some time.<br>
After all, our objective is to take down Graf Spee. No more.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Achilles：</span><br>
So that's why you had Exeter leave... But won't she totally hate you if you tell her that? She nearly sunk today.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ajax：</span><br>
I don't care. People like her are just fun to mess around with.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Achilles：</span><br>
Right-o, then since you're my friend, I'll just go along with it!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ajax：</span><br>
You know, if I had to sacrifice someone either way, I could've given a good reason for you to retreat as well. Anyway, judging from Graf Spee's escape route, we might be able to easily beat her on our own.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Achilles：</span><br>
Huh? Really?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ajax：</span><br>
That depends on if we can trick her into doing what we want, of course.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Achilles：</span><br>
Yeah, true!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ajax：</span><br>
And lastly... A-Achilles, thank you for... b-being you!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Achilles：</span><br>
Ajax? ...Aw, look at you, being all timid~ You never change, silly girl.<br>

<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ajax：</span><br>
Ahahah, how does it feel to be forced into a fight with us?<br>
<span style="color:#ff0000;">Admiral Graf Spee：</span><br>
......<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ajax：</span><br>
Allow me to remind you: while I'm sure you were hoping to dock at a neutral port, there are Royal Navy freighters here.<br>
How unfortunate. All you had to do was choose another port, then you would have put us in a tight spot...<br>
<span style="color:#ff0000;">Admiral Graf Spee：</span><br>
I'm surprised you planned this far ahead... But I wonder: why are you so confident that you can defeat me?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ajax：</span><br>
WE don't plan on defeating you. A half dozen more capable people are on their way here to do that... like Ark Royal, or Renown, just to name a few.<br>
In short: all that we had to do was to slow you down.<br>
<span style="color:#ff0000;">Admiral Graf Spee：</span><br>
...I see. What a flawless plan you've devised...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ajax：</span><br>
Though, because you've been so gracious and allowed all the merchant ship crews to escape, we'll let you live if you surrender now. I swear it on the honour of the Royal Navy.<br>
<span style="color:#ff0000;">Admiral Graf Spee：</span><br>
...If you think I'll go down by your hands just as you'd hoped, know I won't let you do that... There is no reason for me to harm you... or any of the innocent people at this port, simply to entertain an impossible fight...<br>

<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Achilles：</span><br>
Persistent even to the end... Who would've thought she'd scuttle herself... Now she's gonna make us look like the bad guys!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ajax：</span><br>
...There's no such thing as a good or bad side in war, Achilles.<br>
We don't have any need for Cumberland to come anymore... I'll just inform our allies that... Graf Spee has been sunk.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Achilles：</span><br>
Alright. Then we should start heading... Ajax? You okay?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ajax：</span><br>
Go on ahead, I'll catch up with you.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Achilles：</span><br>
...Alrighty then. I'll take it slow so you've got time.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ajax：</span><br>
Yeah, sure.<br>
In reality, Cumberland was the only one behind us. I lied about Ark Royal and Renown, you see. Ahahah...<br>
But even supposing you were to defeat us, your defeat would have been set in stone the moment you docked at this port.<br>
...It's not like me to be emotional in front of my fallen enemies like this. When I get back home, I'm going to harass Exeter some more.<br>
But still, I'm grateful, Admiral Graf Spee. It's thanks to you that I managed to have such an... enjoyable time. Ahahah...<br>
