Chapter 1 - Zuikaku In The Morning<br>
Port - Early morning<br>
My secretary, Zuikaku, would usually come to my office and give me a report at this time of day, but it seems she's not here yet.<br>
......<br>
<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项1：Head to the dorm to check on Zuikaku</span>'''''<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">{namecode:96}：</span><br>
*Snore*... Mmhh... *Snore*... Zzzzzzz...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">{namecode:95}：</span><br>
As you can see, she's fast asleep... Please, forgive her, Commander...<br>
<br>
Zuikaku was lying in her bed, limbs stretched out in all directions, snoring loudly.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">{namecode:95}：</span><br>
Perhaps she overworked herself during last night's training... Usually, she'd even wake up before me...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">{namecode:96}：</span><br>
... Sis... *Snore*... Some people dream of success... but I'm gonna work hard at it... Zzzz...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">{namecode:95}：</span><br>
I just cleaned the room yesterday, and now she's made a mess of it...<br>
C'mon, Zuikaku, wake up! The Commander's here!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">{namecode:96}：</span><br>
Com... mander?! Oh shoot, I-I'm sorry! I overslept when I- Waahh?!<br>
<br>
Startled, but awake, Zuikaku got out of bed. She tripped over a pillow which must've fallen off the side of her bed.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">{namecode:95}：</span><br>
Goodness gracious... Go and get yourself in order, I'll clean up the room.<br>
... The Commander's waiting for you, so don't dawdle. *Giggle*<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">{namecode:96}：</span><br>
G-got it!<br>

Chapter 2 - Zuikaku & Her Friends<br>
After Zuikaku hurriedly gave me her morning report, we went out together for a walk around the base.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">{namecode:96}：</span><br>
Sorry, Commander... I was up all night cramming Offense Skillbooks...<br>
... I know, I'll be more careful next time...<br>
Hey, what's this? Why's everyone gathering at the pier?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">{namecode:76}：</span><br>
Why, if it ain't Zuikaku! You out for a walk with the Commander?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">{namecode:96}：</span><br>
Yup! So, why are you all gathered here?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">{namecode:77}：</span><br>
We wanted to talk to some Eagle Union peeps about a joint exercise, and we're discussing how to bring it up with them.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">{namecode:96}：</span><br>
Uh, can't you just, like, bring it up with them? Like normal people do?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">{namecode:47}：</span><br>
Ise and Hyuuga could maybe do it, but most of us aren't the types who can just ask someone about a joint exercise...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">{namecode:54}：</span><br>
She's right. If someone like Takao or I were to ask them, we'd come off as too formal, and they might speculate that we're up to something...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">{namecode:96}：</span><br>
Then why don't I do it? I was just about to head their way anyhow.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">{namecode:76}：</span><br>
Really? 'Cause that'd be a huge help.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">{namecode:47}：</span><br>
If Zuikaku will ask on our behalf, then I'm sure it'll go well.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">{namecode:54}：</span><br>
Yeah. Sorry for making you go out of your way like this, Zuikaku.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">{namecode:96}：</span><br>
No need to be sorry! I can handle it, no problem!<br>
<br>
Zuikaku went to the Eagle Union dormitory and proposed the joint exercise. Almost everybody she told about it agreed to participate.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">{namecode:96}：</span><br>
*Phew*... That about makes it one lap around the base, huh?<br>
This happens surprisingly often~ Like, I'm just out and about, then suddenly somebody asks me for a favor.<br>

Chapter 3 - Zuikaku & The Foxes<br>
As I was making my way back to the office...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">{namecode:91}：</span><br>
Oh, Commander~!<br>
<br>
By pure coincidence, I bumped into Akagi and Kaga who had just finished their exercises.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">{namecode:96}：</span><br>
Hello, you two! I heard you did a great job during your exercises.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">{namecode:92}：</span><br>
And I heard you did a... job... walking around the base with the Commander.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">{namecode:96}：</span><br>
You heard right! ... Hey, what're you doing, Commander? What are you hiding from?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">{namecode:91}：</span><br>
Ah, you see, the Commander gets very shy when Akagi is around. *Giggle*... I shall leave my report in the usual place. You know where, Commander~<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">{namecode:92}：</span><br>
Bootl... *Ahem*, Akagi, please try not to inconvenience the Commander too much.<br>
That goes for you too, Zuikaku. You're the secretary, so do your job right... Now, Akagi, after you.<br>
<br>
......<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">{namecode:96}：</span><br>
Hey, Commander, Akagi's left now.<br>
Like, I know she can be overbearing sometimes, but don't you think you were overreacting to her just a little much?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">{namecode:92}：</span><br>
You don't understand, do you, Zuikaku?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">{namecode:96}：</span><br>
Huh? Don't understand what, exactly?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">{namecode:92}：</span><br>
If Akagi had seen the Commander together with any other girl, she wouldn't have been smiling like that, she would've been talking about how she's going to "eliminate all filthy pests" that get in her way. And hiding won't save you from her.<br>
That is to say, Akagi has assessed that, even though you're together with the Commander, you are harmless to her plans. That's why you've even made it this far.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">{namecode:96}：</span><br>
I don't know whether to be happy or sad about that... It's a weird feeling...<br>

Chapter 4 - Zuikaku & Master Mikasa<br>
Evening - Practice Area<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">{namecode:82}：</span><br>
Splendid! Now come at me and attack!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">{namecode:96}：</span><br>
Okay!<br>
<br>
Zuikaku's planes released their dummy bombs over Mikasa, achieving a marvelous direct hit.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">{namecode:82}：</span><br>
Ouch!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">{namecode:96}：</span><br>
Sweet, sweet victory! ... Hey, Master Mikasa, what happened? Are you okay?!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">{namecode:82}：</span><br>
I-I am fine... I must say, that was a spectacular attack! You have made phenomenal progress since your training began!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">{namecode:96}：</span><br>
Thank you, Master Mikasa! ... Hey, Commander, am I awesome, or what?!<br>
... Ahahahah! Okay, I'm awesome, but maybe not THAT awesome~! All right, now I should be one step closer to surpassing the Grey Ghost!<br>
Then, next time, I'll be able to protect my sister and my friends...!<br>
... Commander, could you put the Grey Ghost and me together for the next sortie? I'll nab that MVP, I swear it!<br>
<br>
Zuikaku grinned as she turned around and headed back towards the base.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">{namecode:82}：</span><br>
Commander, do you have a moment?<br>
Zuikaku may not seem like it, but within her lies the strong desire to thoroughly prove her worth. In other words: she will one day drive herself into a corner.<br>
Her desires go beyond merely wanting to surpass the Grey Ghost. She wants to shoulder the burdens of Shoukaku, her Sakura Empire brethren, the entire world, and even you, Commander.<br>
Commander, I must ask a favor of you... A favor as Zuikaku's mentor, a favor as an individual...<br>
If the burdens she carries grow too heavy... then I want you to be by her side and support her.<br>
<br>
......<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">{namecode:82}：</span><br>
... Ahah, that's what I wanted to hear. You have my gratitude.<br>

Chapter 5 - Today, I'm Your Chef!<br>
Office - Nighttime<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">{namecode:96}：</span><br>
Welcome back, Commander! Want me to bring you your food soon?<br>
... Huh? Didn't I tell you that I'd be making your food today, not Shoukaku? I can't keep asking her to make food for you forever, so I tried my own hand at it!<br>
Just sit tight, I'll be back in a moment.<br>
<br>
A short while later, Zuikaku returned with a tray of food.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">{namecode:96}：</span><br>
Dinner's served! Chicken nuggets with onions, rice cooked in barley and miso soup with an egg, and lastly for dessert: coconut juice and a Royal Rations Banana!<br>
All in all, it's like a road trip through Flavortown! Bon appetit!<br>
<br>
The food itself certainly looked appetizing, but it was arranged rather casually on the tray. One could really tell Zuikaku prepared this meal.<br>
It also looks like she hid some tempura next to the chicken nuggets. Maybe they were meant to be a surprise?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">{namecode:96}：</span><br>
So, what do you think?<br>
<br>
......<br>
<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项1：It's delicious, like always</span>'''''<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">{namecode:96}：</span><br>
... Delicious, like always? Sweet! I mean, even without my sister's help, I can at least make some delicious food!<br>
So it's even better than the Grey Ghost's cooking? Thanks, Commander!<br>
I've heard Vestal is teaching her how to cook so that basically means she's no match for me!<br>
*Giggle*♪ I beat the Grey Ghost today♪<br>

Chapter 6 - Someone Like Me...<br>
Office - Past midnight<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">{namecode:96}：</span><br>
Geesh... There's an unusual amount of paperwork today... Usually, by now you'd have already been gone to sleep...<br>
<br>
It's been a long time since I've had to work this late into the night.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">{namecode:96}：</span><br>
Um, since it's so late, maybe I should make you something light to eat?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">{namecode:95}：</span><br>
Don't you know, Zuikaku? You should have something prepared before you even ask that.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">{namecode:96}：</span><br>
You're here, sis?!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">{namecode:95}：</span><br>
I noticed that you hadn't come back to the dorm yet, so I reasoned that you must still be hard at work...<br>
It's not good for your health to overwork yourself. Now, watch and learn the importance of being prepared...<br>
<br>
With an alluring smile, Shoukaku reached into her pockets and took out a handful of snacks and a small can, which she placed on my desk.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">{namecode:96}：</span><br>
B-but I was just about to prepare something... Wait a minute, is that... beer?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">{namecode:95}：</span><br>
It is~ The Commander has been working all day, so I thought a drink might help relieve some of the stress... In a way, I'm also taking a little revenge for that thing a few days ago~<br>
By which I mean that time when I'd had a lot to drink, and... Oh, you haven't told her yet, have you, Commander...?<br>
<br>
I don't remember anything like that...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">{namecode:96}：</span><br>
(I knew it: sis has been doing all sorts of stuff with the Commander when I'm not around...)<br>
(I get it now... She's prettier than me, she's more composed than me, and though we're equals in combat, she's a way better secretary than me... Someone like me can't even hold a candle to her...)<br>
... Alright, then... I'll just go and leave my snacks in the fridge...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">{namecode:95}：</span><br>
... Maybe I took my teasing a little too far?<br>

Chapter 7 - The Indomitable Crane<br>
Office - Past midnight<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">{namecode:96}：</span><br>
I'm sure... you'd prefer Shoukaku's snacks over mine anyway...<br>
<br>
......<br>
<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项1：Tell Zuikaku not to leave</span>'''''<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">{namecode:96}：</span><br>
You mean you want mine too...?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">{namecode:95}：</span><br>
*Giggle*~ The Commander must be quite famished♪<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">{namecode:96}：</span><br>
You don't have to force yourself to eat it... Sis has already gotten you some snacks, so I'll save mine for next time, okay...?<br>
... "Only when together can sis and I form your wings, so it's absurd to choose only one of us"...?<br>
... J-jeez...<br>
<br>
For a moment, Zuikaku's expression turned bright red.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">{namecode:95}：</span><br>
That is a charming, albeit very cheesy way of expressing your feelings...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">{namecode:96}：</span><br>
Commander, thank you.<br>
I know that you care about us both. I've known it for a long time, and yet I got so upset over nothing...<br>
If I ever lose faith in myself again and start acting mopey...<br>
Actually, no! I'll never let that happen again! I'm the indomitable crane; I'm above mopiness!<br>
But... if you'd every now and then tell me that you like me more...<br>
Then I might... be a little happier...<br>
... Please? Commander...?<br>
