Summons From the Sakura Empire<br>
<br>
The Invitation<br>
One day, months after the battle of the Rose Tower...<br>
*knock knock*<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Memphis：</span><br>
I'm coming in, Commander.<br>
<br>
The time is 10 AM. Memphis would normally be attending some conference at this hour.<br>
The fact that she's here now likely means that she has something to tell me.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
(Can't go too long without something unexpected ruining the peace...)<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Memphis：</span><br>
Why are you staring at me? Is there something wrong with my clothes, or...?<br>
Is it my hair? Did something get stuck in it?<br>
Helena, could you give it a look?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Helena：</span><br>
It looks perfectly normal to me. Nothing unusual...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Memphis：</span><br>
Then what's the matter?<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
I'm just wondering what news you've got for us today.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Memphis：</span><br>
Ah, of course. You're perceptive as always.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Only because it's not the first time this has happened. Judging by your attitude, it's not bad news, is it?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Memphis：</span><br>
Well, it's just that the Sakura Empire has extended a formal invitation to us.<br>
Something about wanting to formally thank you for helping them during the Naraka incident.<br>
Also, they'd like to discuss their and your future joint plans in person.<br>
Here it is – the physical thing. I sent a digital copy of it to our superiors.<br>
The conferences will take place during the reformation talks, so central command will be pleased. They should issue the official order for the trip soon.<br>
<br>
I read the invitation, and the contents are nearly the same as what Memphis just described.<br>
And, listed in the inviter column is a familiar name – Nagato.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
(Ah, Nagato, a welcome name indeed. She fought admirably with us during the Naraka incident.)<br>
(I heard she not only took on Akagi's position, but also became the Sakura Empire's new representative for the Crimson Axis.)<br>
(We'll no doubt have many things to discuss regarding the reformation later.)<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Memphis：</span><br>
Are you wondering why this invitation is from Nagato and not Akagi?<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Hm?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Memphis：</span><br>
Akagi said she wanted to invite you to visit her homeland, right? I'm surprised her wish became reality so quickly.<br>
The invitation might officially be from Nagato, but it would surprise me if Akagi played no role in it.<br>
...Did I guess wrong? Were you thinking about something else?<br>
Ahem... Helena!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Helena：</span><br>
Yes? What?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Memphis：</span><br>
I'll pass on this trip to the Islands. You'll go instead.<br>
Have fun, and look after the Commander!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Helena：</span><br>
Don't worry, I will. You won't be disappointed.<br>
Also, I'll be sure to bring back some Sakuran souvenirs for you.<br>
Good luck with your work in the meantime.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Memphis：</span><br>
*sigh*... What I wouldn't do for a vacation...<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Strictly speaking, this isn't a vacation for us either. We're going there on official business.<br>
There'll be a banquet, sure, but then we'll have to attend conferences with the Sakurans.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Memphis：</span><br>
Luckily for you, there shouldn't be that much to discuss since they support the reformation. As for the fine details, we'll work them out in conferences over here.<br>
So, basically, your conferences are just a formality. The real goal of your trip is entertainment and relaxation!<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Yeah, well, let's hope so.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Memphis：</span><br>
Heheh. I'll adjust your schedule accordingly.<br>
Opportunities like this don't come often, so you'd better enjoy the trip to its fullest!<br>

<br>
Summons From the Sakura Empire<br>
<br>
Dream of Shocking Strings<br>
And so, we set off on our trip.<br>
Our chartered plane goes straight from the Iris Orthodoxy to the Sakura Empire, with escorts accompanying us from the places we fly over.<br>
Besides me and Helena, there are two other passengers on board – Shinano and Noshiro, her attendant.<br>
Shinano received the order to return home to the Sakura Empire at the same time as I received my invitation.<br>
Since our destination is the same, there's no issue in letting them fly with us.<br>
It's also reassuring to have someone as capable as her in my company in the event that something weird happens to us.<br>
As time passes on the plane, a sleepiness gradually comes over me...<br>
I walk through a vast hall.<br>
However, I can sense that it's not just a big, open space.<br>
This place is brimming with a strange darkness.<br>
When I take one step forward, the darkness takes one step back. When I go backward, it goes forward.<br>
This all-enveloping darkness that follows my steps prevents me from seeing beyond just a meter ahead of me, no matter how hard I try.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
(Talk about creepy... Where the hell am I?)<br>
<br>
I keep walking through the dark for a while.<br>
Until, finally, at the edge of the black nothingness, a single figure appears.<br>
<span style="color:#fef15e;">？？？?：</span><br>
...Wh-who's there?<br>
...Who's watching me? Who are you?<br>
<br>
Startled by this sudden appearance, I take one step back. The figure on the dividing line moves forward.<br>
The distance between us is about a meter. It's as though the darkness limits both our fields of view to precisely that distance.<br>
<span style="color:#fef15e;">？？？?：</span><br>
There's no one here... There can't be...<br>
And yet, I sense it... You ARE there, aren't you?<br>
What are you? A ghost? A spirit? Or maybe even a higher-order life form?<br>
You were drawn to Amahara, weren't you?<br>
Those beautiful wishes, those false promises... They deceived even a transcendent being such as you?<br>
Heheh... Ahahahahaha!<br>
<br>
There is a glimpse of a sort of madness beneath her composure.<br>
Although I have no idea who this woman is, I can tell that her mind is at its breaking point.<br>
<span style="color:#fef15e;">？？？?：</span><br>
Just leave... Don't come closer.<br>
Don't stay here, and don't enter Amahara...<br>
This place is no paradise... It's merely a grave. A grave made of lies and falsehoods!<br>
Heheheh... Half a lifetime of blood and sweat, and all I got in return was a lie...<br>
And the Council even wants me to keep retelling this lie...<br>
Hahaha... I was wrong... I was wrong this whole time...<br>
If our bodies cannot leave this place, then how can our minds?<br>
This prison is perfectly closed off...<br>
You, I, those people... In fact, all people...<br>
None of us can escape our destinies...<br>
Except for THOSE girls...<br>
And those despicable machines...<br>
THOSE DESPICABLE MACHINES!<br>
Ahahaha... He knew it for so long...<br>
He knew it for so much longer than we did...<br>
Curse that Aoste...<br>
Curse that Magister...<br>
And... curse "the only choice"...<br>
<br>
Just as insanity consumes the figure, the space around me begins to tremble.<br>
As the darkness approaches, the previously meticulously-maintained distance begins to unravel.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
(Crap... I don't like this...)<br>
(I need to get out of here immediately... or else...)<br>
<br>
"Or else what?"<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
(Or else... I'll...)<br>
<br>
An unfamiliar fear sprouts in my heart.<br>
This fear also gathers bit by bit in the distant darkness.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
(Is the fear in my heart trying to... take shape?)<br>
(Tangible fears give birth to tangible things...)<br>
(But what about an intangible fear? A fear I don't even understand myself? What will come from that?)<br>
<br>
As soon as the thought sprouts, it draws nourishment and grows like a plant spreading its roots, until finally it bears large fruit.<br>
The madness and distortion spread through the space, and I feel a suffocating pressure from all around me. Scenes start overlapping, and all sound begins to garble.<br>
The very next moment, the darkness has encroached to right before my eyes.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
(No! I need to regain my composure... Calm down. Don't let the fear spread any further...)<br>
(I have to get out of here – right now...)<br>
<br>
Suddenly, there's a sound.<br>
All the distortions and weird phenomena vanish without a trace.<br>
The space becomes stable again, and a wind chime rings next to me.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Shinano ：</span><br>
Mh...<br>
Are you awake?<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
I'm back... Back on the plane.<br>
Phew... Did you pull me out of that nightmare?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Shinano ：</span><br>
Sensing an ailsome presence, this one came to you.<br>
You appeared to be tormented by ill dreams... However, this one did naught.<br>
Naught, other than seating oneself beside you.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
I see.<br>
(It wasn't her. It must've been that wind chime saving me again.)<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Shinano ：</span><br>
Presuming that all is well now, this one shall take her leave. May your dreams henceforth on this journey be more pleasant.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Yeah. I hope so, too.<br>
(A weird place, a mysterious woman, something about a certain "Amahara," and that feeling of an unknown fear...)<br>
(I should ask Helena META what the hell it all was later.)<br>

Summons From the Sakura Empire<br>
<br>
The Return<br>
After that bad dream, I wasn't able to get a wink of sleep.<br>
Time passed until, finally, the plane landed at our destination.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Zuikaku：</span><br>
Commander! Helena! Welcome to the Sakura Empire!<br>
<br>
As we disembark the plane, we're immediately greeted by someone.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Good to see you again, Zuikaku.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Zuikaku：</span><br>
Heheh. We meet again.<br>
And Shinano, welcome home. There's a car waiting for you.<br>
Wishing you a safe journey there.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Shinano ：</span><br>
Much obliged.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Wait, you're not coming with us, Shinano?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Shinano ：</span><br>
Nay. Musashi has implored this one to see her at the earliest opportunity.<br>
I thank you for letting me accompany you. Now, I must bid farewell.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Watarase：</span><br>
Miss Shinano, Noshiro, this way, please.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Zuikaku：</span><br>
Oh, you two, you should come with me!<br>
<br>
After we get done with the grand welcoming ceremony, something seizes my attention – a row of cars standing in the most conspicuous place on the road.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
...Are all those for us? Isn't it a little over the top?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Zuikaku：</span><br>
No way! Lady Nagato said you saved the whole Sakura Empire and deserve the best reception you can get!<br>
I figure she and the rest are waiting for us at the banquet, so we should get going!<br>
<br>
The car door closes and the engine roars.<br>
I gaze out the window, enjoying the view as I think about something I wanted to ask Zuikaku.<br>
......<br>
<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项1：(Ask about the banquet.)</span>'''''<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项2：(Ask about Amagi's health.)</span>'''''<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项3：(Ask about how Akagi has been.)</span>'''''<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项4：(Ask about the aftermath of the Naraka incident.)</span>'''''<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项1）</span>'''''You said "the rest" earlier. Who else, besides Nagato, is coming to the banquet today?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Zuikaku：</span><br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项1）</span>'''''Uhh...<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项1）</span>'''''Besides her, Miss Amagi and Miss Tosa will be in attendance as well.<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项1）</span>'''''Also Houshou, Ryuuhou, Zuihou, my sister Shoukaku...<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项1）</span>'''''And me, of course! Ahaha.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项2）</span>'''''How's Amagi's health been? Nothing abnormal, I hope?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Zuikaku：</span><br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项2）</span>'''''Her health has been completely spotless!<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项2）</span>'''''Ah, but I guess there're a few things she needs to get used to. That should be no biggie, though.<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项2）</span>'''''At any rate, she's doing a lot better than she used to!<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项3）</span>'''''How's Akagi? Did she have any involvement in this banquet?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Zuikaku：</span><br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项3）</span>'''''Well... I'll level with you – our superiors just approved a plan the other day on how to punish her.<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项3）</span>'''''As a part of that, she's been forced to step down from some of her positions and was sent to Ama no Tobira, the Heaven's Gate, to reflect on her actions.<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项3）</span>'''''Which is to say, nah, I don't think she had any hand in the banquet.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项4）</span>'''''How has the recovery and rebuilding been going following what happened with Naraka?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Zuikaku：</span><br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项4）</span>'''''Considering the scale of that calamity, all I can say for now is... progress is slow and steady.<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项4）</span>'''''We shipgirls were the only ones inside the Prime Barrier who didn't fall into a deep sleep that night, so we took the brunt of the damage in combat.<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项4）</span>'''''Although Naraka did envelop the whole of the Sakura Islands, we brought it down fairly quickly, so in the end, most of the bad dreams never even got the chance to materialize.<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项4）</span>'''''And we have you, Yamato, and all those who came to our aid to thank for that. The Sakura Empire was saved because you were here.<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项4）</span>'''''Sadly, Lady Nagato had to declare the whole incident as part of a Siren plot in order to prevent a nationwide panic from breaking out.<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项4）</span>'''''I mean, that's not a lie, strictly speaking! When you trace it back to the source, it did all happen because of Observer!<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项4）</span>'''''So, to sum it up... it was an unprecedented disaster, but as luck would have it, it didn't cause too much damage, I guess?<br>
<br>
Before I know it, we've reached our next destination.<br>
The moment I see the scene unfolding before me, a memory resurfaces in my mind.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Way back when, when I visited the Sakura Empire with the Academy, I attended a banquet held right here.<br>
Past me wouldn't have believed you if you said I'd one day be back here again.<br>
Now, I'm not just returning to an old place, but I also have a totally different reason for attending the conferences here.<br>
How different things have become. Time flies, as they say.<br>
Yeah. Time really flies...<br>

<br>
Summons From the Sakura Empire<br>
<br>
After the Party<br>
The grand and magnificent banquet came to an end. Everything was going smoothly and according to plan.<br>
The only concern I had on my mind was Nagato's health.<br>
Although she remained dignified as always, it was clear that she'd been overexerting herself.<br>
It's hard to fathom just how much pressure is on her now that she's taken Akagi's position as the big decision maker.<br>
I hope that she's like me at heart – someone who loves their work.<br>
Before I leave the venue, I take a detour to visit another old place I know.<br>
The night sky is clear and spotless, and the moon is so beautiful.<br>
Sadly, there's nobody in the pavilion in the center of the lake.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Zuikaku：</span><br>
If you want to see the garden at its best, you should come back in the afternoon.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Thanks, but it's fine. I was just walking by and thought I'd stop and look.<br>
I went here after the Academy's banquet, too, back then. Just think of it like me wanting to bask in a little nostalgia.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Zuikaku：</span><br>
Oh, okay. So should we...<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
I've had my fill now. Mind guiding me to our lodging?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Zuikaku：</span><br>
Sure thing! Follow me!<br>
<br>
My bedroom, sometime later...<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Whew. That's everything on today's schedule done.<br>
Tomorrow's conference isn't until 10 AM, so I should be able to get plenty of sleep.<br>
But first... time to contact Helena META.<br>
<br>
The light recedes, and that same old starry sky comes into view.<br>
<span style="color:#ffc960;">Helena META：</span><br>
You wanted to talk?<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Yeah. While flying to the Sakura Empire, I had an extremely weird nightmare.<br>
<span style="color:#ffc960;">Helena META：</span><br>
A nightmare?<br>
Well, I was observing the aircraft and I didn't detect a single trace of outside interference.<br>
Still, I'm curious. What happened in this "weird nightmare"?<br>
<br>
I told her about everything I saw, heard, and felt – including that bizarre sensation – to her in as much detail as possible.<br>
My explanation seems to have given her an inkling of something.<br>
<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项1：(Ask about Amahara.)</span>'''''<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
That "Amahara" she mentioned sounded like the name of some kind of project or facility.<br>
She described it as "half a lifetime of blood and sweat" and "a grave made of lies."<br>
Got any clues as to what it is?<br>
<span style="color:#ffc960;">Helena META：</span><br>
Hmm. I have an idea, but there's much about it I can't tell you yet.<br>
Since "Amahara" is all you heard, the only thing I can tell you right now is that it is both a project and a facility.<br>
Just forget everything else that woman rambled about.<br>
You can't trust what a crazy person says.<br>
<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项1：(Ask about the woman.)</span>'''''<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
I couldn't see clearly, but I'm pretty sure she wore expensive Sakuran clothes. Does she come from there?<br>
She also mentioned "the Council" and "Aoste." Is she somebody that I "used to" know?<br>
<span style="color:#ffc960;">Helena META：</span><br>
Maybe.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Then isn't there something – anything – you can tell me about my nightmare?<br>
What was it? A memory from the distant past? A fragment of an already distorted memory? Or did my mind just wander into some land of illusions again?<br>
<span style="color:#ffc960;">Helena META：</span><br>
It's...<br>
It might be a memory from the distant past. It might be a fragment of an already distorted memory. Or... it might even be an event from the past you witnessed with your own power.<br>
Bear in mind, though, that because the dream was hazy and distorted, you should treat the knowledge you gained from it as being hazy and distorted, too.<br>
To put it in other words, take what you saw with a large grain of salt.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
What about that fear I felt?<br>
It was an undefinable, spreading fear... I sensed how it was turning into something tangible in the dream.<br>
<span style="color:#ffc960;">Helena META：</span><br>
You've heard about the idea that what you think of in the day, you dream of in the night, right?<br>
Be it the output or input, what happens in your dreams is deeply connected to what's running through your brain.<br>
Meaning, things you think about tend to appear in your dreams.<br>
Fear is a special kind of emotion that can appear from anywhere at any time. Once it starts, it's easy for it to feed itself, creating a feedback loop.<br>
When your senses are sharp, you can process and eliminate this fear through logic.<br>
What about when you're sleeping, though?<br>
People's actions in dreams aren't controlled by their logic. Dreams, meanwhile, can turn thoughts into what feels like reality.<br>
All that is to say, feeling a sense of fear that you can't describe or having fears turn into something tangible aren't unusual things in dreams.<br>
It's all just an illusion conjured up by your brain. Sure, it's scary, but you don't need to worry about it leaving your head and hurting you.<br>
Just calm down after you wake up and try to forget the things you saw.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
I see... I finally got a serious answer out of you.<br>
I thought you were going to play it vague like you tend to do.<br>
<span style="color:#ffc960;">Helena META：</span><br>
I'm sorry...<br>
It's just that you've been learning so much information by accident lately. Far more than it's safe for you to know at this stage.<br>
If I feed you any more information, your very existence will be put in danger. That's why I can't afford to risk it.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
So, you're saying you can only supplement the information that's clear cut...<br>
While you can't give me any details directly on the information that's more vague. Is that right?<br>
<span style="color:#ffc960;">Helena META：</span><br>
Correct.<br>
That's what weasel words and metaphors are for...<br>
Because the information they relay is equivocal, they allow you to get around certain restrictions and say things that you normally couldn't without suffering consequences.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Marco Polo must be an expert when it comes to that, huh?<br>
How is she doing? Is her consciousness still in a dream?<br>
<span style="color:#ffc960;">Helena META：</span><br>
She's fairly stable. Why do you ask?<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
I was hoping I could talk to her, like how Shinano did that one time in Europa.<br>
I've got questions for her about the Sardegnia League and Hierophant.<br>
<span style="color:#ffc960;">Helena META：</span><br>
Got it. It'll take some time to prepare, though. Can we do it another day?<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Sure. I'll leave you to it.<br>
<span style="color:#ffc960;">Helena META：</span><br>
Alright. Then I pray you'll have sweet dreams tonight.<br>

Summons From the Sakura Empire<br>
<br>
The Mystery That Deepens<br>
Today's conference was held in a fancy pagoda in the garden.<br>
Just as Memphis predicted, the topics were mostly things that had already been covered.<br>
It was done in just under 30 minutes. After that, the Sakurans served us lunch and even shared a tour plan for the afternoon with us.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
So... It seems our work here is done.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Helena：</span><br>
Yep. It was a wrap once they gave us that schedule.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
The conference didn't even take half an hour. I guess we're free to enjoy our vacation now.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Helena：</span><br>
I think so, yeah. Gosh knows we need a break.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Ain't that the truth. What do you say we start with a look around the garden?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Helena：</span><br>
Sure. Hang on, I'll go get a map. Be right back.<br>
<br>
Following the map, Helena and I go on a walk, checking out the worthwhile spots around the garden.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Helena：</span><br>
From what I heard, this garden used to be Akagi's, but it was handed over. Nagato is the current owner.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
It's such a huge place, too... That explains why there's nobody around.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Mikasa：</span><br>
Hahaha! Going further back, Nagato once gifted this garden to Amagi as a place to bolster her health.<br>
It was relinquished to Akagi later on. Now it has merely come back into its original owner's hands.<br>
<br>
Just as I point out the lack of other people, we run into a fellow person admiring the scenery just around the corner.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Mikasa? Hi.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Mikasa：</span><br>
Aye, it is I. Greetings, Commander.<br>
I'm pleased by your character. You conduct yourself with the appropriate dignity of one known far and wide.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Hahaha. Don't pile the praise too high, now. Didn't think we'd run into you here, but I'm glad we did.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Mikasa：</span><br>
A chance encounter amongst beautiful scenery! This place is ideal for a trip together, wouldn't you agree?<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Absolutely. Just wondering – you weren't at the banquet last night, were you? I didn't see you at the conference earlier this morning, either, so...<br>
You're not suffering from some after-effects of the Naraka incident, are you?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Mikasa：</span><br>
Ahahaha! Your thoughtfulness is much appreciated. No, I was quite alright thanks to Yamato.<br>
That being said, I've stepped down from all my official posts. For that reason, I wasn't in attendance on either of those occasions.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Wait, you've stepped down?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Mikasa：</span><br>
That I have. We all must atone for our mistakes, no?<br>
The world should be led by young folks such as you. I'm actually quite enjoying this relaxing life, having been freed of my former obligations.<br>
On a different note, something very interesting happened just the other day. Would you care to know what?<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Very interesting, huh? I'd love to hear it.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Mikasa：</span><br>
Then let us first find a better place for conversation. Come along.<br>
<br>
Helena and I follow Mikasa to a building detached from the garden.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Mikasa：</span><br>
This is my temporary residence. Make yourselves at home.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Starting to feel like this is going to be pretty important.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Mikasa：</span><br>
Hear what I have to say first, then you can judge for yourself how important it is. I can assure you, however, that it will be fascinating.<br>
Now, have you ever had a near-death experience before?<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Just to be clear, are we talking about the feeling you get right before death comes knocking?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Mikasa：</span><br>
Slightly after that. I speak of the time up to when your consciousness completely vanishes as you approach death.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Then I haven't. Did you experience that during the Naraka incident?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Mikasa：</span><br>
Aye. In the midst of that very battle.<br>
As I was on the verge of death, for but a brief moment, I had something akin to a near-death experience.<br>
There was light, and the world suddenly expanded before me.<br>
It expanded on and on until it finally transformed into a boundless white void.<br>
In that endless expanse, I felt as though a thousand thoughts in my mind had become clearer, like the final piece of a puzzle had fallen into place.<br>
It felt like I had become an omniscient being in that instant. Faced with this white void, I knew everything there was to know.<br>
A blink of the eyes later, I awoke in a sickroom.<br>
The boundless white void collapsed instantaneously, and I was removed from the then-finished puzzle.<br>
My mind was again left in a cluttered state. Even the things I'd already grasped had come undone, reverting to being indecipherable.<br>
Quite the fascinating experience, aye, {playername}?<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Never heard anything like it before, that's for sure. However... I know this "endless white void" you're talking about.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Mikasa：</span><br>
Oh?<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
It's a higher-dimensional plane that might have something to do with Wisdom Cubes.<br>
Seeing that place as you're on the verge of death, feeling like some fragment returned to the whole... Now that's very interesting.<br>
Did something similar to your experience happen to anyone else, among those who got drawn into Naraka and experienced the ritual?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Mikasa：</span><br>
Nay. A shame.<br>
That being said, I'm not well-acquainted with otherworldly things of this nature.<br>
Had it been Musashi who experienced this, she would no doubt be able to describe it in better detail and remember more than I did.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Wait, "remember"? Didn't you say everything you grasped reverted to being indecipherable?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Mikasa：</span><br>
That I did. Not only could I grasp them no longer, but I forgot all that I had grasped instantly. Much like I had a dream that vanished tracelessly upon my awakening.<br>
Even so, I daresay I have a rather good memory. I am certain beyond a doubt that I experienced something unusual whilst at death's door.<br>
How can I be sure? Because, although I forgot all else, one mystery remains, and I remember it as clear as day.<br>
One might call it the singular fruit that this bizarre journey yielded.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Mystery? What is it?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Mikasa：</span><br>
It is you, {playername}, Commander of the Azur Lane – you are that giant mystery.<br>
When and where were you born? Who are your parents? Do you have any other kin?<br>
Where did you study? When was your aptitude for Wisdom Cubes recognized? And finally, when did you enroll in the Azur Lane Academy?<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Well, this is weird. You have the resources to easily look all of that up. What's such a "giant mystery" about any of that?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Mikasa：</span><br>
That is the thing. I've searched and searched, yet found nothing.<br>
To be precise, some information pertaining to you is completely unfindable, as though it exists not in this world. Meanwhile, the things I HAVE found do not align with my own memories.<br>
For instance, the Azur Lane Academy taking the place of a world-renowned Wisdom Cube research institute.<br>
Such was also the case with the well-known Wisdom Cube Aptitude Test. Gone, like it never existed to begin with.<br>
You surely remember what Akagi said: "Nobody can even notice the discrepancy until someone points it out."<br>
Trace the line back and think deeply about it. Do you not sense that something is wrong?<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
The Azur Lane Academy took the place of a Cube research institute?<br>
Are you saying the Academy I studied at once used to be a famous research center?<br>
Because that's completely new to me. I've never read anything like that before.<br>
The Wisdom Cube Aptitude Test, though... I do remember that.<br>
It was pretty widely reported on at the time.<br>
It was in NY Harbor, where...<br>
Where I... met... Anzeel...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Mikasa：</span><br>
......<br>
Was it really in NY Harbor, {playername}? Not in Europa? And who is this "Anzeel"?<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
...What?<br>
Hey... Why were we talking about NY Harbor and Anzeel?<br>
No, wait, it wasn't NY Harbor – it was Europa. I'm sure of it.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Mikasa：</span><br>
There it is. We've only scratched the surface of the iceberg, and yet the mystery grows deeper still.<br>
Now that I've stepped down, I have all the time in the world. I can look into leads as small as this one.<br>
Will you assist me?<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
......<br>
(Magician did say there are lies and fabrications mixed in with my memories...)<br>
(I thought she referred to the experiments I'd been a part of that Observer created.)<br>
(Clearly... there's more to it than just that.)<br>
(Is it not just me? Could all of test site beta also be hiding some sort of enormous secret?)<br>
Alright. I'll help.<br>
We'll find the truth behind this one way or another!<br>

Summons From the Sakura Empire<br>
<br>
Mystery Beckons More Mystery<br>
Later that night, I returned to my lodgings and contacted Helena META.<br>
Not to speak with her, though – but rather with Observer.<br>
As the overseer of all projects across test bite beta, no one knows it better than her.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Observer ：</span><br>
To answer your two questions: Yes, I did both.<br>
When you trace it back, the root cause lies in you.<br>
You caught my attention by displaying an unprecedented number during the Aptitude Test. That's when I began the subsequent experiment projects.<br>
I turned the Wisdom Cube research institute into the Academy, swept everything about the Aptitude Test under the rug, and altered the records. It was all just a part of dealing with the aftermath.<br>
Funny, isn't it – how truly nobody can tell the future? In the end, you claimed victory over me.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
You altering the records would explain a lot of things.<br>
Did it really start with that test, though? You're telling me you didn't interfere with my memories at all before that point?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Observer ：</span><br>
Of course not. Do you know how many people there are in the world? I had my hands full as it was. Do you think I had the time to observe you, specifically, for who knows how long?<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
If you say so. Also, when conducting experiments, do you have a manual or something like that that all members need to follow? Or does it vary from test site to test site?<br>
Take the Wisdom Cube Aptitude Test, for instance. Does that exist across all test sites?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Observer ：</span><br>
Probably? I'm not privy to all the details since I can't get in touch with a different Observer.<br>
<span style="color:#ffc960;">Helena META：</span><br>
Make that "probably" a "yes." The WCAT wasn't something exclusive to your test site.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Observer ：</span><br>
There you have it. She knows better than I do about this stuff.<br>
To me, this is simply standard experimental procedure.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Where did I take the test? Was it Europa after all?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Observer ：</span><br>
That's right.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Something inside me just feels wrong when I try to remember it.<br>
The memories that resurface immediately are all from NY Harbor, not Europa.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Observer ：</span><br>
That can't be. It just can't.<br>
<span style="color:#ffc960;">Helena META：</span><br>
...NY Harbor?<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Yeah. Why? Does that ring a bell?<br>
<span style="color:#ffc960;">Helena META：</span><br>
Oh, uh, no.<br>
I haven't been in this test site for very long. Observer should know much more about it than I do.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Observer ：</span><br>
Since you're so skeptical, allow me to pull up the old data for you.<br>
I wasn't paying that close attention to you back then, but the records must be there regardless. It shouldn't be hard to put together something with a bit of filtering and analysis.<br>
......<br>
Hm?<br>
That... doesn't make any sense.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
What doesn't?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Observer ：</span><br>
There are no records. None. Everything concerning your past is gone.<br>
Strange... I'm sure I did keep records of it. I even had a closer look at them when I realized how special you were.<br>
<span style="color:#ffc960;">Helena META：</span><br>
An error? In YOUR database? That shouldn't be possible.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Observer ：</span><br>
You're right. It shouldn't. My mainframe has never been destroyed, and there's no bug in the data itself either.<br>
But maybe...<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Maybe what?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Observer ：</span><br>
Maybe... that data was erased when I connected to my mainframe?<br>
My mainframe is the only thing that can read, alter, or remove records without my knowledge.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Wait, you mean Observer Zero specifically tweaked your mainframe to delete records about my past?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Observer ：</span><br>
That's the most plausible explanation at the moment, yes.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
And we only learned about it because I asked about it... Things are getting more serious at an alarming rate.<br>
<span style="color:#ffc960;">Helena META：</span><br>
Is there any way we can rule out the possibility that Zero herself did this?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Observer ：</span><br>
I'll have a chat with Tester, Compiler, and Omitter. Those records should still be in their mainframes.<br>
If this wasn't Zero's handiwork, the data must exist intact on one of them.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
What about Purifier?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Observer ：</span><br>
Well... Purifier encountered a teensy-weensy issue during her recovery process.<br>
<span style="color:#ffc960;">Helena META：</span><br>
Her mainframe was rebuilt quite some time ago, but for some reason, it's never been able to properly boot up, and her AI personality hasn't activated.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Is that a common occurrence?<br>
<span style="color:#ffc960;">Helena META：</span><br>
No. We don't know what's causing it or how to fix it. We're still working to troubleshoot the issue.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Sorry to hear that. Let me know if there are any updates.<br>
<span style="color:#ffc960;">Helena META：</span><br>
Will do.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
(Helena had a clear reaction to NY Harbor being brought up earlier... I'm guessing my past self took the Aptitude Test there instead.)<br>
(Only, that was in the alpha timeline, not test site beta.)<br>
(Could it be that the Aptitude Test from the alpha timeline is the source of it across all test sites?)<br>
(And maybe... Anzeel and I were acquainted during this first test?)<br>

<br>
Summons From the Sakura Empire<br>
<br>
Another Invitation<br>
It's now my third day in the Sakura Empire.<br>
During today's conference, the Sakurans put forth a surprising proposal – inviting Helena and me to visit Ama no Tobira.<br>
This invitation was extended to us by none other than the highly-regarded and rarely-seen Yamato herself.<br>
It made me wonder if their real reason for bringing us here was to give us this invitation.<br>
As for the Ama no Tobira itself, its very existence is wrapped in mystery. Even Nagato has never set foot there.<br>
Naturally, the opportunity to visit it sounded very alluring to me.<br>
However, just to be safe, I decided to ask Helena META about it before giving them my answer.<br>
And so, I returned to my lodgings and went back to that familiar view of space.<br>
<span style="color:#ffc960;">Helena META：</span><br>
We've met more in these past three days than we did in the last three weeks.<br>
The Sakura Empire must be a wonderful place.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Ahaha... More like a really mysterious place.<br>
<span style="color:#ffc960;">Helena META：</span><br>
I suppose. So, did you come to ask about Ama no Tobira?<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Yeah. I'm really curious to see what it's about.<br>
<span style="color:#ffc960;">Helena META：</span><br>
Then feel free to act on that curiosity.<br>
It's an isolated artificial Singularity, so it's not an especially dangerous place.<br>
Fortunately, the Arbiters have been busy with so-called cross-border experiments lately, so many of them – Magician included – have been reassigned to that.<br>
This means that I have more than enough firepower to protect you at the moment.<br>
You'll be safe no matter what, even if you end up in danger, so don't be hesitant to go.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Wait, "cross-border experiments"?<br>
<span style="color:#ffc960;">Helena META：</span><br>
Mhm. I suppose they're exactly what they sound like – experiments involving crossing borders of some kind.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
You're being vague again. I guess you can't tell me.<br>
Still, I assume it's something important if they mobilized so many Arbiters for it. Will their experiments affect us in the future somehow?<br>
<span style="color:#ffc960;">Helena META：</span><br>
I'm working on determining that. Worrying now will do you no good.<br>
By the way, we made some progress yesterday during our investigation.<br>
It's not just Observer's mainframe. The data had been wiped from the other experimentation division members as well.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
We can be pretty damn sure it was Zero's doing, then.<br>
<span style="color:#ffc960;">Helena META：</span><br>
Let's not jump to conclusions.<br>
Observer is no expert on Arbiters. There are several other Arbiters who could hack into a mainframe like theirs.<br>
What we should do now is pinpoint the exact time when the data was erased. Once we know that, we can narrow down our search.<br>
For instance, if the data disappeared while Observer was connected to her mainframe, that leaves Zero as the most likely suspect.<br>
Because, as far as I know, the Tower is the only one who can modify data without Zero finding out.<br>
On the other hand, if the data got wiped while Observer WASN'T connected, our list of suspects grows quite big.<br>
It could be Magician, who's already appeared in test site beta. Or it could be The Hanged Man, or Wheel of Fortune, or even The World.<br>
And our list grows even bigger if the data wipe happened while Observer was busy dealing with Pamiat' Merkuria META when she invaded Antarctica...<br>
In that instance, Temperance could've done it.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Wheel of Fortune? The World? Arbiters, I assume?<br>
<span style="color:#ffc960;">Helena META：</span><br>
Yes. X and XXI. They're both bad news, so I hope we can avoid them as much as possible.<br>
Anyway, I'll handle the legwork! You just focus on relaxing and enjoying your vacation in the Sakura Empire to its fullest.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Right... I'd almost forgotten what it even feels like to relax.<br>
Just gotta focus on that.<br>
<span style="color:#ffc960;">Helena META：</span><br>
Exactly. Just relax.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Ahh...<br>
<span style="color:#ffc960;">Helena META：</span><br>
That's the spirit. Anyway, good night, Commander.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Good night, Helena.<br>
