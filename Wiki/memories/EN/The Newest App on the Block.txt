Port - Hallway<br>
While I'm passing by Akashi's workshop, I hear despondent muttering coming from the half-open door.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Yuubari：</span><br>
Working overtime, all-nighter, no energy, it's out of my control, let me go home...<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
(That's Yuubari. Is Akashi forcing her to work on something?)<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Soobrazitelny：</span><br>
Easy, easy. Have a pick-me-up.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
(The genius mechanic is here, too? Drinking immediately after an all-nighter sounds really unhealthy.)<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Bremerton：</span><br>
I'm so frickin' pissed! Get on your knees and beg for mercy!<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
(Now Bremerton? Is she trying to fix their horrific working conditions?)<br>
<br>
Feeling concerned, I turn the doorknob and enter.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Yuubari：</span><br>
Hum-hum. Commander. Did you two...?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Bremerton：</span><br>
Nope, I didn't tell the Commander yet!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Akashi：</span><br>
Me neither, nya.<br>
<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项1："Tell me" what?</span>'''''<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项2：What's going on here?</span>'''''<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项1）</span>'''''Is there something I should know about?<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项1）</span>'''''I heard you yelling a second ago. Is something the matter?<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项2）</span>'''''I heard you while I was passing by a second ago.<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项2）</span>'''''Something about "working overtime" and "getting on your knees and begging."<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Bremerton：</span><br>
Ohh. Ya musta heard that and got concerned!<br>
It's alright, nothin' to worry about! We were just testing out stamps for FleetChat!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Yuubari：</span><br>
Yes. What you heard was just us reciting what the stamps say.<br>
<br>
Yuubari shows me her phone screen.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
That's all it was?<br>
Hang on, "FleetChat"? You mean that messaging app you proposed a while back?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Akashi：</span><br>
Bingo, nya.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
If memory serves me right, it's going to be our new universal app for texting, right?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Bremerton：</span><br>
That's right! 'Til now, we've all been using different ones.<br>
That led to everyone having to install a bajillion apps just to text each other.<br>
So we set up a crack team – Soobrazitelny, Yuubari, and the not-here-at-the-moment Ingraham and Nakhimov.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Soobrazitelny：</span><br>
Together, we created FleetChat! In addition to the expected chat function, it also features group chats!<br>
AND! Yuubari and I even managed to integrate Juustagram into it!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Yuubari：</span><br>
I was so excited to see people trying it out that I didn't get any sleep last night...<br>
<br>
Yuubari lets out a long yawn.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Bremerton：</span><br>
We haven't fully settled on a name yet, but we're goin' with FleetChat for now.<br>
Has a nice ring to it, don'tcha think?<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
It does. In fact, I think that could be its official name.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Bremerton：</span><br>
Really? Sweet! Lemme hit up Liverpool and Z47 and let 'em know!<br>
I asked 'em about the name before and they lowkey loved it!<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Are you gonna text them through FleetChat?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Bremerton：</span><br>
Nah, not yet!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Akashi：</span><br>
The final round of testing only just finished, nya. They're still using the same old apps, nya.<br>
The plan was to report to you once we'd finished testing the stamps, but that won't be necessary now, nya.<br>
Saved us a bit of legwork by showing up when you did, nya.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Bremerton：</span><br>
Yeah, talk about a coincidence!<br>
Heck, might as well give our report here and now, yeah?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Akashi：</span><br>
Well... Commander, the testing of FleetChat's basic features has concluded, nya. It's ready for release, nya.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Bremerton：</span><br>
Woo! Clap, clap, clap!<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Great work, all of you. Get some well-earned rest.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Soobrazitelny：</span><br>
Eh, it was easy! Creating a texting app is child's play when you're a genius mechanic!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Yuubari：</span><br>
Hum-hum. The 1.0 release is ready, yes, but there is still Akashi's proposed VIP system to work on.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
VIP system? I thought you were making a regular messaging app.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Akashi：</span><br>
Umm! I have no idea what Yuubari's talking about, nya!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Yuubari：</span><br>
What? But just earlier, you said–<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Akashi：</span><br>
What I MEANT was a system to reward you, our most valuable developer, for your hard work, nya!<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Right...<br>
<br>
Ignoring Akashi's attempt at an excuse, I decide to get us back on topic.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Seeing as the 1.0 is finished, why not let the whole port try it out?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Akashi：</span><br>
Nya? You mean release it just like that, nya?<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Have some faith in your users. I'm sure your current version will work just fine.<br>
Besides, you need users testing your app to get feedback or bug reports.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Soobrazitelny：</span><br>
Ahh-ha-ha-haah! I, for one, agree with Comrade Commander!<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Alright. Soobrazitelny, you'll run one last test.<br>
Bremerton, you'll write the tutorials for using the app while Yuubari polishes up the interface descriptions.<br>
Once all that is done, Akashi will formally announce the app's release.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Everyone：</span><br>
Got it!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Bremerton：</span><br>
Oh, one more thing! Lemme borrow your phone for a sec, Commander.<br>
<br>
Bremerton walks up and extends her empty hand toward me.<br>
<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项1：(Give it to her.)</span>'''''<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项2：(Don't give it to her.)</span>'''''<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Bremerton：</span><br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项2）</span>'''''You don't want to, huh? Why? Got somethin' to hide?<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项2）</span>'''''......<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Bremerton：</span><br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项2）</span>'''''Heh, just kidding! C'mon, I'm just gonna install the app on your phone.<br>
<br>
I do as she asks and hand it to her.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Bremerton：</span><br>
Let's see here... Download... Register...<br>
Done!<br>
<br>
She hands it back to me. My screen shows the FleetChat app on standby.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Bremerton：</span><br>
Congrats! You're the very first user of this here version!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Soobrazitelny：</span><br>
Go on! Try it out!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Yuubari：</span><br>
Yes, it's quite simple to use. Give it a try.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Bremerton：</span><br>
What're you waitin' for? Come on!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Akashi：</span><br>
And if you've got any feedback, be sure to let me know, nya.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Alright. Here we go.<br>
<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项1：(Open the app.)</span>'''''<br>
