Paradigm of Happiness<br>
<br>
Chapter 1 - Moreso than Usual...<br>
Port - Outside the Office<br>
One day, Prinz Eugen, third ship of the Admiral Hipper class and little sister to my secretary, was standing outside of the office.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Prinz Eugen：</span><br>
Oh my. Guten Morgen, Commander. Aren't you quite the sleepyhead today~ You have no idea how pouty my poor sister was, having to wait for you this whole time.<br>
You know, she really wants to make a good impression on you as your secretary~ In any case, I need to get going. Have fun, you two... Hehe~<br>
<br>
As soon as I heard those words from Prinz Eugen's lips, I already could picture Hipper's furious expression in my mind... Nevertheless, I took a deep breath and pushed the office doors open.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Admiral Hipper：</span><br>
H-hey...! Y-you sure took your sweet time today! Do you know how long I've been waiting here?<br>
Eh? You wanted me to come wake you up? Excuse me? Wh-who do you take your secretary for?!<br>
<br>
I sat down, sighing a breath of relief, knowing that Hipper is acting the same as always.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Admiral Hipper：</span><br>
...(Glances sideways)<br>
<br>
She's staring at me intently...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Admiral Hipper：</span><br>
Wh-what's your deal? Focus on your work already! Or... did you have something more important to tell me?<br>
...Wh-what?! Staring? Was not! Who would stare at the likes of you?! And you, how can you act like nothing just happened?! I was worried that something bad had...<br>
Ah geez, I completely lost my work rhythm because of you! I'm heading out real quick for some fresh air! B-but you'd better not assume I'm slacking off or anything!<br>
<br>
After firing those words out of her mouth like a machine gun, Hipper darted out of the office.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Prinz Eugen：</span><br>
Oh my... I was about to bring over the previous report, but saw Hipper running down the hall... What'd you do this time, Commander?<br>
<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项1："No clue."</span>'''''<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项2："I ticked her off, apparently?"</span>'''''<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Prinz Eugen：</span><br>
Hehe. Clueless as ever, I see. But that's very much like you~<br>
Despite how she acts, my sister can be really bashful, you know?<br>
<br>
Prinz Eugen smiled at me with warmth and compassion in her eyes. What is going on today...?<br>

Chapter 2 - Hipper Wants to Calm Down<br>
After reaching a good place to take a break from work, I decided to get up to look for Hipper.<br>
Even though she said some mean things, I didn't expect that she had already finished all her work by the time she left...<br>
Just when I was starting to dwell on this fact, I spotted Hipper in one of the lounges. She seemed to be completely engrossed in something.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Admiral Hipper：</span><br>
Seriously... Whether's it's Eugen or that big idiot, why do they always... Am I reading too much into things? Did I misunderstand something? Fat chance, right? Yeah, no way...<br>
But, shouldn't that idiot have come looking for me by now? Geez...<br>
<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项1："I'm right here."</span>'''''<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Admiral Hipper：</span><br>
Eeeaaahh?! Wh-wh-when did you get here?!<br>
You would've said something but... you didn't want to interrupt my monologue? ...Excuse me?!<br>
Dammit, this is your fault! I'm not myself today because of you!<br>
<br>
My fault? What did I do to wrong her?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Admiral Hipper：</span><br>
Deep breaths, deep breaths... Whew... Whatever, forget it. Anyway, what do you want?<br>
<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项1："What are you doing?"</span>'''''<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Admiral Hipper：</span><br>
What am I doing? ...Arranging flowers, I guess?<br>
What's with that look on your face? Is it THAT weird for me to have hobbies?<br>
I'll do this sometimes when I want to calm down. It's easier for me to concentrate when I'm alone... Why do I need to calm down in the first place...?! Why, that's... because... of... you!<br>
Gaahhh! It took me all that time to calm down, and now I'm all worked up again!<br>
<br>
You must've been really focused since you didn't even notice me until I called out to you...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Admiral Hipper：</span><br>
Hm? Hmph, well, yeah. I'm quite confident in my aesthetic talents... Did it interest you that much? Hmm...<br>
Just out of curiosity, what's your favorite flower?<br>
<br>
I randomly picked the names of a few flowers that I actually know about.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Admiral Hipper：</span><br>
Oh really? In that case... maybe I'll make something for you if I'm ever in the mood.<br>
You're always hanging out in that dreary office of yours. Stewing in your tastelessness all day can't be healthy.<br>
<br>
Hipper seemed to have cheered up a bit at least...<br>

Chapter 3 - Getting A Clue<br>
Port - Academy<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Admiral Hipper：</span><br>
Why were you taking Great Shark out for a joyride again? Take better care of your stuff, will you?!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">U-101：</span><br>
Ugh... It's my fault this happened to Great Shark... I'm sorry!<br>
<br>
I heard the voices of Hipper and U-101 as I was walking past the Academy.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Admiral Hipper：</span><br>
C'mon... Here. Just tighten these bolts up and you'll be fine.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">U-101：</span><br>
Woah! Great Shark feels brand-spankin'-new! This bad boy might go even faster now! Can I give 'im a shot?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Admiral Hipper：</span><br>
Excuse me? What did we literally just talk about? ...You know what, whatever. That one has a mind of its own anyway. Just be careful!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">U-101：</span><br>
You got it! All righty, Great Shark! Let's hit the sea!<br>
<br>
There was the loud roaring of an engine, followed by something whizzing past me.<br>
<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项1：Leap out of harm's way</span>'''''<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">U-101：</span><br>
Woah! That was a close call... Commander! Don't just run in the way like that! Huh? I was the one who wasn't watching where I was going? Ahahaha...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Admiral Hipper：</span><br>
Hey! U-101, please don't tell me you ran someone over! Hey, we're so sorry! This all happened because I– Geh... Wh-wh-wh-why are you here?!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">U-101：</span><br>
But I'm telling you, he's super amazing! Thanks to Hipper's maintenance, Great Shark's brakes are so responsive! Commander, if it wasn't for Hipper's maintenance, you would've been fish food now!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Admiral Hipper：</span><br>
You mean, none of this would've happened if you weren't riding around like a maniac! Geez!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">U-101：</span><br>
Commander, Commander, I'm serious! Hipper's super good at repairing stuff! So I had her work on Great Shark!~<br>
<br>
Indeed, had it not been for Hipper, this story would've ended in tragedy.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">U-101：</span><br>
Hey, Hipper, wanna take him out for a spin? Hehe, or we can double ride~ I've not had my daily fill of adrenaline yet!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Admiral Hipper：</span><br>
Oh for– You almost ran someone over, and that's all you can think about? Do I need to modify it more so you can only drive safely?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">U-101：</span><br>
Nooooooo! Don't underclock iiiiit!<br>
<br>
So, not only can she arrange flowers, but she can also fix bikes. Hipper really is more than meets the eye.<br>
I expressed my heartfelt appreciation to Hipper for saving my life.<br>
By the looks of things, I would be able to entrust work to her that required extreme attentiveness to detail.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Admiral Hipper：</span><br>
Huh? Oh, um, when you put it that way... Umm, th-thank you...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">U-101：</span><br>
Hm? Hipper, are you blushing? Ahh! I knew it... Something DID happen between you two last time!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Admiral Hipper：</span><br>
Sh-sh-sh-sh-shut up! That was just business as usual! It's not like we were going on a date or anything!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">U-101：</span><br>
There you go doing it again~ Besides, what's there to be embarrassed about?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Admiral Hipper：</span><br>
Ugh... One more word from you... and I'll make it so that you can only stay under the speed limit!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">U-101：</span><br>
NOOOOOOOOOOO!~<br>
<br>
Huh. Come to think about it... We did do something like that, didn't we...<br>
I stopped to think and slowly recollect the events of that day...<br>

Chapter 4 - Seaside Ride<br>
Not long ago...<br>
Because of some emergency orders, I had to head somewhere else for work. And on the way back, I accompanied her on a detour.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Admiral Hipper：</span><br>
Whew... It feels really nice to drive around like this every once in a while. I'm getting a bit tired though, so let's take a break. I'll pull over right ahead over there, okay?<br>
Mm... The scenery's not bad over here~ You can see the endless sea stretching all the way across the horizon. It's so different from when we're on those very waters, fighting... But from here, you can really appreciate how beautiful it is.<br>
It really was worth coming down along the coastline!<br>
<br>
I'm not sure if the strong winds along the way had gotten to her, but Hipper seemed more excitable than usual.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Admiral Hipper：</span><br>
Being the secretary is hard work, you know? My shoulders are all stiff from mindlessly pushing papers all day.<br>
After we get back to port, let's rest up and reset. By the way, not too long ago, a few friends from the Vichya Dominion asked me to teach them to play an instrument.<br>
...What, you want to hear me play too? Sure, I suppose there's no harm in that...<br>
<br>
For whatever reason, Hipper felt a lot kinder than usual.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Admiral Hipper：</span><br>
I have to say though, you really impressed me today. Though you normally act like you're completely useless without your secretary...<br>
If you were half as diligent as you were today, my life would be so much easier. But, it's whatever... Just for today, you've earned your praise. Good work, Commander~<br>
...Hey, are you even listening?<br>
<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项1："You had me captivated there."</span>'''''<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Admiral Hipper：</span><br>
Eh... Y-you idiot! What a stupid thing to say all of a sudden! Geez!<br>
And I'm not acting bashful at all! It's all because you went and said that weird thing earlier!<br>
<br>
Admiral Hipper’s face was several shades redder than I had ever seen it. Quite impressive, really...<br>

<br>
Chapter 5 - Strategy Meeting?<br>
A certain day, in the residential area...<br>
Several ships gathered around for what appeared to be a strategy meeting.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Admiral Hipper：</span><br>
So, that's what happened. What do you think?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Prinz Eugen：</span><br>
...Sis, are you serious?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Glowworm：</span><br>
I wouldn't know what to do either!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Admiral Hipper：</span><br>
...Just listen quietly.<br>
Anyway, as I was saying... Whenever I'm around this one person, I just feel like... I'm not quite myself. This has never happened to me before...<br>
I can't seem to calm down, or I can't figure out what to say. Seriously, I don't get it at all! Geez, why am I letting some idiot get me all flustered?!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Prinz Eugen：</span><br>
I see... But, you already know what you should do next, right?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Admiral Hipper：</span><br>
If I knew, I wouldn't be asking you two for advice!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Glowworm：</span><br>
Hey! You just told us to sit here and listen quietly!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Prinz Eugen：</span><br>
Well, you know... It's not that I can't understand your feelings. After all, you are a temperamental washboard.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Admiral Hipper：</span><br>
What do washboards have to do with any of this?!<br>
*sigh*... If I was as resourceful as you, I'd be able to figure out some countermeasures even in this situation.<br>
All right, mastermind, what's your grand idea?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Prinz Eugen：</span><br>
Let me think. Yeah, in a situation like this, you need to take the initiative. Which means: make a move on the commander.<br>
...Having said that, the direct approach might be a bit too hard for you, my dear innocent sister.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Admiral Hipper：</span><br>
*sigh*... I can't believe you... I should've just asked someone else! Glowworm! Your thoughts?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Glowworm：</span><br>
If you ask me... Just charge at the problem and headbutt it right into the ground!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Prinz Eugen：</span><br>
Hmm... When it comes to the careful push-and-pull of romance, that might be a bit...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Admiral Hipper：</span><br>
R-romance?! Having that said, I do like Glowworm's suggestion. "Muster up the courage to charge forward!" That very much suits her style...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Prinz Eugen：</span><br>
I suppose that could work? After all, you only got into this mess because you let this "certain someone" catch you off guard. Hehehe~<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Admiral Hipper：</span><br>
Enough of that already! Since we've decided, I'll be going now!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Glowworm：</span><br>
Oh, she ran off. Think she'll be okay?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Prinz Eugen：</span><br>
Hehe... I wouldn't be too worried. The outcome was set in stone long ago.<br>

Chapter 6 - Courageous Charge<br>
Port - Outside the Office<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Admiral Hipper：</span><br>
...We need to talk!<br>
<br>
Hipper suddenly threw open the door and barged in.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Admiral Hipper：</span><br>
Why else would I be here... Look what you've done to me! I haven't been myself lately because of you!<br>
When you were working that other day, I was just thinking about how you weren't half bad...<br>
But then nothing came of it at all! Ever since we got back, I've been cleaning up after your messes, nonstop!<br>
<br>
How'd she get that impression of me...?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Admiral Hipper：</span><br>
It's natural to help out while I'm the secretary, but even when I'm not working, I'm always worried about whether you might need help with something!<br>
Have you ever been in this situation where you just can't stop thinking about someone?! You've even started appearing in my dreams... How annoying is that?!<br>
<br>
I was left stunned by Hipper's words for some length of time.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Admiral Hipper：</span><br>
Ahh, geez. How am I going to get you to take responsibility for this?<br>
*sigh*... But considering how daft you can be, I'd be better off just asking Glowworm...<br>
<br>
Hipper was so... embarrassed? That she looked like she was about to cry. Just then...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Prinz Eugen：</span><br>
...Whew. The anticipation was killing me, so I just had to come take a look... But you two are like brick walls trying to talk to each other.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Admiral Hipper：</span><br>
E-Eugen! Why are you here...?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Prinz Eugen：</span><br>
I was planning to come cheer up my cute, clumsy sister~♪<br>
Commander, did you know? The reason why she's been so flustered is because she saw the couple's ticket that Akashi bought for you.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Admiral Hipper：</span><br>
What? Sh-sh-shut up! I've never even heard about this...!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Prinz Eugen：</span><br>
Buying that ticket of course means that you plan to use it. In other words, she was thinking about who you were going to give it to. Right, sis?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Admiral Hipper：</span><br>
N-nonsense! Besides, how did you even know about that?! Peeping at other peoples' stuff is really distasteful!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Prinz Eugen：</span><br>
Well, whatever the case may be... the cat's out of the bag now, isn't it? What do the two of you plan to do now?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Admiral Hipper：</span><br>
It... it's not like that... Hmph! Idiotic Commander! What... Did you have something to say to me?!<br>
I'm a kind and tolerant person, so I'll... hear you out...<br>
<br>
The memory of the scenery we saw together was still fresh on my mind. And this ticket... was for a two-person trip so that we could enjoy that view again.<br>
Perhaps this small token was not enough to thank Hipper for her hard work as my secretary, but I wanted to at least try to express my sentiment.<br>
<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项1：Hand the couple's ticket to Hipper</span>'''''<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Admiral Hipper：</span><br>
Huh...?! Th-this was... for me...?<br>
I-I suppose I have no choice then! Be grateful that I'm willing to give you the time of day!<br>

Chapter 7 - A Lifelong Vow<br>
Several days have passed since I returned from the trip with Hipper.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Admiral Hipper：</span><br>
Excuse me? You still haven't finished your work? Good grief, you shouldn't have put it off earlier then! Learn to use your brain, you big moron!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">U-101：</span><br>
Huh...? Wasn't the trip suppose to improve their relationship?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Glowworm：</span><br>
I originally thought... Well, at least it looks like things are back to normal.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Admiral Hipper：</span><br>
All right, stop wasting your breath and sit down! Here, this is the report from today's exercise, which you can use as a reference for planning your next sortie.<br>
You what? You forgot? Geez, do you even have two lone braincells rubbing in that thick skull of yours?!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">U-101：</span><br>
Seems like she's as strict as ever with the commander... Are you sure they're fine?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Prinz Eugen：</span><br>
You don't see it? I think they both look happier than they were before.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Glowworm：</span><br>
Even though Hipper seems to be absolutely seething?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">U-101：</span><br>
If I was in that situation, I would've hopped on Great Shark and bailed ages ago.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Prinz Eugen：</span><br>
Hehe. Maybe you can't tell, but the commander knows. She isn't upset at all...<br>
She's just doing her best to help.<br>
This, too, is another way of showing love. Hehe, it really puts a smile on one's face~<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Glowworm：</span><br>
Ohhh... I've heard about that before~! Maybe I should treat the commander like that too!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Prinz Eugen：</span><br>
In your case... Oh, right... Be careful not to bump your head again.<br>
But in her case, she should learn to rely on the commander a bit more as well. That's my hopelessly proud sister for you~<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Admiral Hipper：</span><br>
Say what? You still haven't finished organizing your files? Geez, you really can't get anything done without me!<br>
Fine, fine. I'll do it for you, but promise me, you'll work harder, become someone more capable, and then...<br>
Devote yourself to making me happy!<br>
<br>
Hipper's attitude doesn't seem to have changed much compared to before, but...<br>
Since that day, my office has always been adorned with a bouquet of Hipper's freshly-arranged flowers.<br>
