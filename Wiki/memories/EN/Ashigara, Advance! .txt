<br>
一 Chapter 1: Ashigara, Fight!<br>
One day, at the training grounds<br>
The heavy cruisers of the Sakura Fleet are currently carrying out exercises.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Aoba：</span><br>
"Aim to be number one in the base! Fight for glory, Torpedo Squadron of the Sakura Fleet!" Ahh, what a fine headline!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Kinugasa：</span><br>
Sis, stop taking selfies already! You're a part of this exercise too!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Myoukou：</span><br>
Nachi, take this seriously! Commander will be watching us as well!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Nachi：</span><br>
Lighten up, you two. A genius like me can handle some exercises without even breaking a sweat!<br>
Wouldn't you rather see how our little sister is holding up?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ashigara：</span><br>
...Hah!<br>
!!<br>
Hiya!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Takao：</span><br>
Fast. But also accurate. Not bad.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Atago：</span><br>
Ara? Are you glad that your underclassman is catching up to you?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Takao：</span><br>
H-hmph... She still has a ways to go...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ashigara：</span><br>
... Phew!!<br>
Haah... are we done?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Akashi：</span><br>
Good work, nya! Your performance was definitely number one, nya! I'm sure you left a deep impression on Commander, nya.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ashigara：</span><br>
R-really?! Um... I'm very glad to hear that!<br>
However, I still have to do better next time...<br>
(Indeed... I must aspire to become even stronger!)<br>

<br>
Chapter 2: Ashigara, Work!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ashigara：</span><br>
Eh? Serve as s-secretary? Me?<br>
Surely, this is a sign that Commander trusts me... so I've got to do my best!<br>
<br>
Port - Command Office<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ashigara：</span><br>
Commander, the files of this past month's commissions are all here.<br>
...I have to arrange them by date?<br>
I-I'm sorry, Commander... please give me a moment...<br>
Commander, um, your tea is-<br>
Eep...!<br>
I-I'm so sorry! I accidentally knocked the teacup over! I'll clean it up right away... um, paper towels, where are the paper towels....<br>
Weird, I swore I put the pen here just a moment ago, and now I can't find it...<br>
*fumbles around*<br>
......<br>
I found it! How did it get all the way over here....<br>
Oh no! The pile of documents are about to fall over! I didn't notice because I was busy looking for the pen...<br>
<br>
Fwoosh! ...Ashigara was buried under a landslide of loose papers.<br>
Though there were some obstacles in the way, Ashigara managed to finish her tasks.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ashigara：</span><br>
Huh? ...It's already this late?!<br>
I'm so sorry.... because of my clumsiness, I delayed Commander's work... I promise I'll do better next time!<br>
(Ugh... I have to redeem myself next time...!)<br>
<br>
Ashigara clenched her fist, filling herself with determination despite wanting to cry in frustration.<br>

Chapter 3: Ashigara, Strike!<br>
Some time later... Ashigara's voice could be heard as one walked from the Academy back to the Command Office.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ashigara：</span><br>
Hiya!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Myoukou：</span><br>
Good, you have a nice tempo!<br>
But not good enough! Surely you can still do better than that!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ashigara：</span><br>
Then how about this? Hiyaaa-!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Myoukou：</span><br>
Excellent! That's even more fierce than... huh?<br>
You're wide open!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ashigara：</span><br>
What...?!<br>
<br>
Clang!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Myoukou：</span><br>
Let's call it here for today's training. Ashigara, you've improved a lot.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ashigara：</span><br>
W-wait, Myoukou... I can keep going-<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Myoukou：</span><br>
You've already pushed yourself today. Any more, and it will become counterproductive. Go, you've earned your rest.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ashigara：</span><br>
...I understand.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Myoukou：</span><br>
Ah, before I forget, I just cooked up a new energy drink-<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Nachi：</span><br>
All right, all right, you've both worked hard. I already bought some drinks for the two of you. Myoukou, why don't we set aside your special energy drinks for ever... I mean, for later.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Myoukou：</span><br>
.......<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ashigara：</span><br>
Nachi, thank you!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Nachi：</span><br>
By the way, Ashigara, I heard that you had a rough time as secretary.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ashigara：</span><br>
Ehh? H-how did you know...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Nachi：</span><br>
Ashigara, whenever you're worried about something, or have something on your mind, you always seem to close off from others.<br>
I had to speak up because it would be troublesome for you to keep inconveniencing the commander. And of course, Myoukou didn't notice as usual.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Myoukou：</span><br>
Commander didn't say anything, so I thought everything was fine... Sorry, I didn't notice it...<br>
But don't worry, I'll give you some tips on how to do secretary work. Of course, you'll have to focus though.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ashigara：</span><br>
Myoukou, Nachi... I understand now! Because I also don't want to cause further trouble for Commander, I'll do my best!<br>
<br>
Though Ashigara's training regimen had just increased, she nevertheless had an expectant look on her face.<br>

<br>
Chapter 4 - Ashigara, Why do you Fight?<br>
One day, at the training grounds<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Hood：</span><br>
I would like to extend my gratitude to everyone in the Sakura Fleet for coming to join us in this joint exercise.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Mikasa：</span><br>
If anything, we are the ones who should be grateful. Through this joint exercise, we hope to be able to learn much from the Royal Navy.<br>
I hope that there will be many more opportunities for us to cooperate in the future!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Duke of York：</span><br>
If memory doth serve me properly, thou art Ashigara of the Sakura Empire?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ashigara：</span><br>
Huh? Uhh, um, yes ma'am!<br>
(She seems to be none other than... Royal Navy Battleship, Duke of York)<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Duke of York：</span><br>
Rumors of thee hast reached mine ears, but thou shines even brighter in person. Sublime, how mysterious thou art!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ashigara：</span><br>
(Is... is she complimenting me?)<br>
Th-thank you very much...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Duke of York：</span><br>
Hehehe, indeed. But I must ask of thee. For whom dost thou fight? One who fights only for oneself shines not, but rather sputters out.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ashigara：</span><br>
(Wh-what does she mean? Is she asking about why I work hard?)<br>
Um... though this is just an exercise, I am a representative of the Sakura Empire, so...<br>
"Spare no expense, and give everything you have." This way, I can fulfill my obligations to everyone in the Sakura-<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Duke of York：</span><br>
Obligations? Hmm... an answer befitting an honor student. But ultimately, a trifling, meaningless answer.<br>
What doth lie beyond thy obligations? What of your Elatus, the uplifting of thy heart from fulfilling thy desires?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ashigara：</span><br>
(I-I've never heard these words before...)<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Prince of Wales：</span><br>
That's enough, it's in poor taste to bully a straightforward and pure girl.<br>
Don't take her too seriously. That's just how she talks. York, don't we have somewhere we need to be?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Duke of York：</span><br>
Tsk... Wales, how ubiquitous thou art.<br>
<br>
Duke of York and Prince of Wales leave the training area together.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ashigara：</span><br>
(Phew... I-I'm saved...)<br>
(Uplifting my heart? Fulfilling my desires? Was she talking about what I really want deep down?)<br>
(Do I really have something like that...?)<br>

Chapter 5 - Ashigara, Confused!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ashigara：</span><br>
Uplifting my heart... fulfilling my desires... just what in the world...<br>
......<br>
Forget it, it's not the time to be worried about that kind of stuff.<br>
Ever since I started studying with Myoukou, secretary duties have become easier and easier.<br>
And I'm really glad that Commander looks happy too.<br>
If I can keep this up, maybe Commander will pay attention me even more?<br>
And when that happens... Um... Ehh...? Then what happens...?<br>
Uh, umm... I must be tired from today's training... and getting sleepy...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">？？？：</span><br>
She's still asleep? It's going to be bad if she doesn't wake up soon!<br>
Heyyy! Ashigara! Get up already!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ashigara：</span><br>
Nnnnhh... what is it... an emergency task?<br>
...w-w-what time is it?!<br>
I-I'm going to be late! ...I'm not even dressed yet?! Afterwards, my hair... my hair! But Myoukou's the one who usually does it for me...<br>
How can I let Commander see me like this? Surely...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Kamikaze：</span><br>
Easy there, missy. Hold your horses!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ashigara：</span><br>
K-Kamikaze?! What are you doing here?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Kamikaze：</span><br>
When I passed by the office, I noticed you weren't there. I dropped by just in case something had happened, and lo and behold, do we have a little incident on our hands! Ho ho!<br>
But don't worry, I asked Commander to give you a day off for "sick leave."<br>
All righty? Just leave the rest to me. It's not every day I get to look after you young folks, ho ho~<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ashigara：</span><br>
...Sorry for the trouble...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Kamikaze：</span><br>
What are you apologizing for? Everyone has bad days.<br>
You must have burnt yourself out from all the training. This is a sign of fatigue, so make sure you properly rest today.<br>
Although~ Ho ho, I did hear something juicy just now. "Ahhhn, I can't let Commander see me like this~"<br>
Could it be... that you've taken a fancy to the chief?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ashigara：</span><br>
Eh? That, that's because...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Kamikaze：</span><br>
Ho ho, you don't need to answer me. As long as you figure it out, that is all that matters.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ashigara：</span><br>
……<br>
(I've... taken a fancy to Commander...?)<br>
(Could it be, I'm actually...)<br>

Chapter 6 - Ashigara, (Love) Stricken!<br>
Port - Command Office<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Kamikaze：</span><br>
Good work! That's the last of the tasks.<br>
Ashigara must have it rough... having to slog through all this paperwork every day...<br>
……<br>
She's doing a lot better now than at first? Well of course! She's one of my precious juniors after all!<br>
<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项1："Let's visit Ashigara together."</span>'''''<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Kamikaze：</span><br>
Hmm~? Are you worried about her? Heh heh... Sure, we can go together.<br>
She should be alone, resting in her room right now. Let me try knocking...<br>
Hm...<br>
That's strange... is she asleep? Let's head in quietly.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ashigara：</span><br>
Wh-what should I do... I've folded so many without realizing it... If I give all of these to Commander at once...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">{{AF|Ashigara}}&{{AF|Kamikaze}}：</span><br>
Uhh...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ashigara：</span><br>
C-c-c-commander?!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Kamikaze：</span><br>
(Psst! Hey! Weren't you supposed to be resting? And why are there wads of paper all over the floor...)<br>
(Wait... they're paper cranes?!)<br>
(Ashigara has always liked folding them, but... I didn't think it would be this bad...)<br>
(So it seems that Ashigara really does feel that way about Commander... In that case, I've got to step up as her senior!)<br>
Ah, I just remembered! I have a training drill with the rest of the squadron! Time to jet~!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ashigara：</span><br>
Huh? Kamikaze? W-wait, why are you leaving me here?!<br>
(If you do that, d-d-d-doesn't that mean it's just the two of us here?!)<br>
(What should I do...?!)<br>
<br>
Time seemed to stop.<br>

Chapter 7 - Ashigara, Go Out!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ashigara：</span><br>
……<br>
(I.... I have to say something... Ughh...)<br>
Ashigara fidgeted in her seat next to me, her face red from ear to ear.<br>
......<br>
<br>
The awkward silence was becoming a bit overwhelming...<br>
Right as I was about to open my mouth...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ashigara：</span><br>
Commander! P-please go out with me!<br>
<br>
Eh...?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ashigara：</span><br>
Wh-wh-what did I say just now?!<br>
P-please forget the strange thing that I said just now!<br>
<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项1：Schedule a date</span>'''''<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ashigara：</span><br>
Huh...?!<br>
D-don't worry about it! I don't know what was going through my head just now...<br>
<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项1："Ashigara, I want to get to know you better."</span>'''''<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ashigara：</span><br>
Um... I see! I also want to learn more about you as well, Commander...<br>
<br>
After following up with her a few more times, Ashigara's nervousness finally melted away, revealing a smile.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ashigara：</span><br>
Um, then... I'll be looking forward to it...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Myoukou：</span><br>
You rascals... what the hell are you all doing? Didn't anyone ever teach you that it's rude to eavesdrop?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Aoba：</span><br>
Yikes, the no fun police is here! ...Ouch ouch ouch!!<br>
<br>
The door suddenly swung open, and several girls crumpled through the doorway.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Kamikaze：</span><br>
Grrr... just when they were getting to the juicy, kissy part...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Nachi：</span><br>
Jeez, Myoukou! Can't you read the mood?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Aoba：</span><br>
I was so close to getting my next big scoop!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Myoukou：</span><br>
Huh? It's my fault now? And why are paper cranes all over the floor? What happened here anyway?<br>
<br>
It seems like before we get to decide on the date, I have some explaining to do...<br>
