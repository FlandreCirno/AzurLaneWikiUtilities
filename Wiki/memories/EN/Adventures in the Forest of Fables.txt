Adventures in the Forest of Fables<br>
<br>
1 Into the Forest<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Akashi：</span><br>
Good mornyan, Commander!<br>
<br>
Akashi came into my office on my day off.<br>
<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项1："Why are you here?"</span>'''''<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Akashi：</span><br>
That's my question, nya. Why are you spending your day off in the office, nya?<br>
There are so many better things you could be doing, nya. So many more fun things, nya.<br>
<br>
Already I could tell where this was going...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Akashi：</span><br>
Remember the escape room we made just a while ago, nya?<br>
Me and the others have designed a new esca– I mean, a new attraction for the port, nya! And we want you to test it, nya.<br>
It'll be free of charge just like last time since you'd be doing us a favor, nya.<br>
Hehehe... You're just aching to try it now, aren't you, nya?<br>
<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项1："You've made me interested."</span>'''''<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项2："Another time, maybe."</span>'''''<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Akashi：</span><br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项1）</span>'''''Great, nya! I knew we could count on you, nya!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Akashi：</span><br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项2）</span>'''''I'm afraid it's now or never, nya. Everyone's already prepped and waiting for you over by the set, nya.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Akashi：</span><br>
I've asked a Royal Maid to brief you this time. If you have any questions for her then don't be afraid to ask, nya.<br>
Now let's get going, nya~<br>
<br>
After arriving at the place Akashi pointed me to, I was greeted by Enterprise of the Royal Maids.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Enterprise：</span><br>
Without further ado, allow me to explain this attraction.<br>
This is the Forest of Fables, where our tale is set. You are a lone person who has gotten lost in these woods. That's it – that's the premise.<br>
The staff are all ready to begin, so please just make your way past the entrance.<br>
<br>
I couldn't see anything resembling an "entrance," as Enterprise called it, only a straight path that continued into the forest.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Enterprise：</span><br>
Is something the matter? The Royal Maids set up all the greenery here, so rest assured, there are no booby traps or anything of the sort.<br>
<br>
"Wait, am I not getting a communicator this time around?"<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Enterprise：</span><br>
Correct. Staff members will join your party during this adventure, and they will essentially try to guide you down the right path.<br>
I'm sure you don't want to listen to me talking all day long, so please head on inside and have fun, Master.<br>
<br>
It wasn't really clear what I should expect from this attraction, but since I didn't have much other choice, I went into the forest.<br>

<br>
2 The White Rabbit and the Cheshire Cat<br>
As I was walking deeper into the forest, I suddenly caught sight of a familiar face.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Shimakaze：</span><br>
Comma– I mean! How strange to find a human out here!<br>
<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项1："Oh. Hey, Shimakaze."</span>'''''<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项2："You there! Who are you?!"</span>'''''<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Shimakaze：</span><br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项1）</span>'''''No, no, I'm not Shimakaze! I'm the White Rabbit!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Shimakaze：</span><br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项2）</span>'''''Hello, hello! My name is White Rabbit!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Shimakaze：</span><br>
Forgive my forwardness, but I urgently need your help!<br>
Jin– I mean, a vicious wolf prowls these woods at night! I simply must get back to my house before it turns dark!<br>
The problem is, I have lost my way, as I'm sure you can tell...<br>
So please, help me get back home! I don't want to be wolf food! I'll do anything you ask in return!<br>
<br>
Shimakaze – or should I say, the White Rabbit – offered to accompany me deeper into the forest.<br>
It seemed my mission for the opening act was to help her find her house.<br>
After walking for a while, we came across a cabin amid the trees. On the other side of the door was a place lined with mirrors in all directions.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Shimakaze：</span><br>
I'm afraid we'll need to go through this maze to find my home.<br>
Unfortunately, I've completely forgotten which way leads out of it!<br>
You must help me find the correct path, or else the two of us will be stuck here forever!<br>
<br>
Everywhere I looked there were doors and corridors reflected in the mirrors, and there was no telling which led to the exit.<br>
I knew we would get lost in a heartbeat if we walked around at random.<br>
Leaving a mark on paths we've taken wouldn't work either, because we'd still lose all sense of direction after turning just a few corners.<br>
While I stood there, trying to think up a plan, I suddenly heard the sound of rapidly approaching footsteps.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Cheshire：</span><br>
Owneeeeer! I'm right over heeeeere!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Shimakaze：</span><br>
(Wait, please! Cheshire! You're supposed to stick to the script!)<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Cheshire：</span><br>
Glomp! Ahem... A human and a rabbit. What an odd combination indeed!<br>
Tell me, why do you need to traverse through this maze?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Shimakaze：</span><br>
Because my house is through here! My grandma is worried about me!<br>
This person here – who I assume wants to leave this forest for whatever reason – is helping me get there! Would you happen to know the path forward?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Cheshire：</span><br>
I see, I see. It so happens I'm in a good mood today, so tell you what – if you play with me, I will take you to the exit.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Shimakaze：</span><br>
You will?! That's so kind! But I wonder – how long do you wish to play?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Cheshire：</span><br>
How long, indeed? I never specified a timeframe, did I?<br>
Could be five years, maybe even ten if I so desire! It all depends on my mood~<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Shimakaze：</span><br>
If that's how it's going to be... Human, let me handle this!<br>
You know what else you didn't specify? WHO will be playing with you! So I volunteer for the task!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Cheshire：</span><br>
Hey! But I want to play with my Owner!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Shimakaze：</span><br>
(That's enough, Cheshire. Let's keep things moving along.)<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Cheshire：</span><br>
Hrmmph... Worry not, I was only kidding!<br>
Besides, it wouldn't be fun to keep the human trapped in here forever. My Owner can go, while the rabbit stays and plays.<br>
The exit is right that way. You're free to leave.<br>
<br>
"What, just like that? I didn't do anything, and you're letting me move forward?"<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Shimakaze：</span><br>
Don't sweat the details! It's better for one of us to make it out than for both of us to be trapped in here!<br>
Oh, one more thing just before you go!<br>
When you find my house, would you mind relaying a message to my grandma? Let her know I'm just fine so she has no reason to worry.<br>
And that I'll be there after I've finished playing with Cheshire!<br>
Also, please take this watch with you! I'm sure it will come in handy on the next leg of your journey!<br>
<br>
After I received her pocket watch, she and Cheshire ran off elsewhere.<br>
At the same time, a passage previously blocked by mirrors opened up, revealing a path to what presumably is the exit.<br>
And so, I proceeded to the next act.<br>

<br>
3 The Lover in the Castle<br>
After exiting the mirror maze, I came upon a small castle.<br>
Up on its balcony, a figure emerged and beckoned me.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Biloxi：</span><br>
You've come, my love, my dear...<br>
<br>
Biloxi's sentence trailed off, and she looked to me to finish it.<br>
<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项1："...Romeo."</span>'''''<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项2："...Juliet."</span>'''''<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Biloxi：</span><br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项1）</span>'''''Now hurry inside the castle, please. We haven't much time.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Biloxi：</span><br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项2）</span>'''''Now come into the castle, quick. We don't have much time.<br>
<br>
She dropped down a ladder from the balcony to me.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Biloxi：</span><br>
The ball today is our last chance to escape this place. Come on, be quick!<br>
<br>
I climbed the ladder and entered the castle. Inside I saw what looked to be a banquet hall, where weapon-wielding Meowfficers were patrolling the area.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Biloxi：</span><br>
You see the guards, no? We can't let any of them spot us, or they'll all come after us.<br>
And if we get surrounded, we're never gonna make it out.<br>
<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项1："Guards? Why are they here?"</span>'''''<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项2："Can't we just... use the ladder to leave?"</span>'''''<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Biloxi：</span><br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项1）</span>'''''They're a measure the head of this castle employed to prevent me from seeing you.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Biloxi：</span><br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项2）</span>'''''Afraid not. The guards will be hot on our heels as soon as they find out about it. Then it's game over for us.<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项2）</span>'''''To get away, we need a plan that will buy us some time.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Biloxi：</span><br>
I've heard the guards change shifts at set times of the day. We'll be home free if we can just exploit that gap in their rotation.<br>
The problem is, I don't how long it is until their shift change, and there's nothing in this hall that tells the time.<br>
Comman– I mean, my love, do you have any ideas?<br>
<br>
The plan would only work if we could tell the time... That's when I remembered the pocket watch I got from the White Rabbit.<br>
<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项1："I have just what we need right here."</span>'''''<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Biloxi：</span><br>
A... pocket watch?<br>
Perfect! That's our ticket out of here!<br>
The guards will rotate iiin... five minutes! Follow me, my love!<br>
<br>
Biloxi led me through a series of dark, twisting corridors. We somehow managed to avoid all the guards and eventually made it to the castle's backdoor.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Biloxi：</span><br>
We're almost there, my love! Freedom is just past this door!<br>
<br>
Just as we were about to sprint for the exit, a figure emerged from the shadows to block us off.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Algérie：</span><br>
Well, well. I thought you'd try to leave through the rear entrance, and lo and behold...<br>
If I said this is as far as you'll go, what would you do?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Biloxi：</span><br>
Dammit. This is it... Of all the people to capture us, it's Algérie her-fricking-self.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Algérie：</span><br>
Heehee. Yes, I am the queen, but you needn't fear capture at my hands.<br>
You see, I'm willing to let you go in exchange for a favor.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Biloxi：</span><br>
Favor? What do you want?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Algérie：</span><br>
You'll find a girl named Snow White not far from here. Take this poisoned apple and have her eat it.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Biloxi：</span><br>
Wicked queen... So you are after Snow White's life after all.<br>
My love, we have to take this deal, or else neither of us will ever get out of here.<br>
Take the apple and go on without me. I'll stay behind as insurance so the queen won't go back on her word.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Algérie：</span><br>
Let us hear your answer. What do you say?<br>
<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项1："We'll do as you ask."</span>'''''<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项2："Feed someone a poisoned apple? I don't think so."</span>'''''<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Algérie：</span><br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项1）</span>'''''A wise decision. Then take the apple and be on your way now.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Algérie：</span><br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项2）</span>'''''What you think is unimportant. You will do it. Exercise caution, as Snow White is not so easily fooled.<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项2）</span>'''''Now take the apple and go.<br>
<br>
Algérie handed me the poisoned apple.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Biloxi：</span><br>
Wait. Take my mask with you. That way I'll still be with you even if I can't follow you.<br>
Best of luck, my love!<br>

Adventures in the Forest of Fables<br>
<br>
4 Snow White and the Poisoned Apple<br>
I left the castle, poisoned apple in hand, and walked through the forest once more. Arriving at an open field, I encountered Snow White.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Joffre：</span><br>
I know your kind... You're an assassin, ordered by the queen to take my life.<br>
<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项1："Prepare to meet your maker!"</span>'''''<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项2："No, I'm just a lost Commander."</span>'''''<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Joffre：</span><br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项1）</span>'''''Very well...<br>
<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项1）</span>'''''Before I could even move a muscle, she pointed a sword at my throat.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Joffre：</span><br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项1）</span>'''''You're sorely mistaken if you think I will simply let you kill me.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Joffre：</span><br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项2）</span>'''''Lying is a sin. A grave one, at that.<br>
<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项2）</span>'''''Before I could even move a muscle, she pointed a sword at my throat.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Joffre：</span><br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项2）</span>'''''You can't deceive me. You aren't the first assassin I've come face to face with.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Joffre：</span><br>
Be frank with me. What trick is the queen trying to pull on me this time?<br>
<br>
I took out the poisoned apple and explained the queen's plot to Snow White-slash-Joffre.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Joffre：</span><br>
I see. So she has turned to deception now that it's clear a frontal attack will not work. I've about had enough of this wicked woman.<br>
Listen, I'm planning to gather reinforcements and assault the castle. However, her cohorts will doubtlessly catch on to me without a disguise.<br>
<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项1："I've got this, if it'll help."</span>'''''<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Joffre：</span><br>
A mask? It will hardly hide my identity, though I suppose it's better than nothing.<br>
I must say... You're quite upstanding for an assassin.<br>
Am I correct to assume you didn't want to assassinate me, but rather you were roped into it?<br>
Don't you worry. Once I've dealt with the queen, you'll be relieved of your orders.<br>
<br>
"This sure is different to the version of Snow White I remember..."<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Joffre：</span><br>
Thank you for assisting me. It's time we both went our separate ways now.<br>
You should hold on to that apple. There are many dangers lurking in the forest, and that apple may just come in handy against them.<br>
<br>
The absurdly battle-hardened Snow White bid me farewell, then began heading for the castle with a leisurely stride.<br>
"Okay... How is a poisoned apple going to help me in these woods?"<br>

<br>
5 Little Red Lying Hood<br>
As I kept walking past the open field the greenery became sparser and sparser until eventually I found myself in some sort of village.<br>
"I wonder if one of these houses is where the White Rabbit lives."<br>
There was only one way to find out. I went up to a small house with a red roof.<br>
<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项1："Anyone home?"</span>'''''<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">L'Indomptable：</span><br>
You've entered Little Red Riding Hood's house. Who are you? The Big Bad Wolf that's come to eat me?<br>
<br>
Needless to say, I had not found where the White Rabbit lives.<br>
What I did find was a bizarre sight. For some reason, Little Red Riding Hood was lying on her bed in wait for the Big Bad Wolf.<br>
<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项1："Why are you just... lying here?"</span>'''''<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">L'Indomptable：</span><br>
Because I'm a defenseless girl.<br>
And I'm trying to get into my role by assuming the most vulnerable position such a girl would be in.<br>
I know the wolf is around here somewhere.<br>
Search the other houses and you will find it.<br>
Yes, I'm sure of it now – you're not the wolf. You don't even have jaws big enough to eat me.<br>
And even if you were to try, I'd simply gut you with my lance.<br>
So, you may leave. I must get back to rehearsing my defenseless girl act.<br>
Remember to close the door on your way out. Le Malin insisted I should rehearse in solitude.<br>
Close the door for me, and you may take that spare red hood by the entrance for yourself.<br>
<br>
Little Red Riding Hood sent me out of the house, though I did get a red hood as a parting gift... for whatever reason.<br>
"I guess I'll have another look around for the White Rabbit's house."<br>
"That wolf could mean danger, though. I'll need to be on my toes..."<br>

<br>
6 The Wolf is Out of the Bag<br>
I found what looks like a wolf's footprints just outside the next house. If the wolf was anywhere, it was sure to be in there.<br>
There was a second pair of footprints as well. Did they belong to the White Rabbit? Was she already inside?<br>
I opened the door as quietly as I could, and that's when I heard voices coming from inside.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Shimakaze：</span><br>
Hello! I'm baaack!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Jintsuu：</span><br>
Why, if it isn't the White Rabbit! What took you so long?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Shimakaze：</span><br>
Well, I encountered Cheshire on the way here and she demanded that I play with her...<br>
But now I'm home at last, Jin– Err, I mean, Grandma!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Jintsuu：</span><br>
Welcome back, dear. Did you get the mushrooms?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Shimakaze：</span><br>
Oh! I became so distracted with trying to find my way back that I completely forgot to pick any mushrooms!<br>
I'm terribly sorry, Grandma! Allow me to go find some right now!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Jintsuu：</span><br>
Don't worry about it, dear. It's late. Rest your weary bones.<br>
Come near so Grandma can have a better look at your face. My, you've grown again, haven't you?<br>
<br>
For some reason, the White Rabbit and the wolf – putting on a grandmother act – were having a conversation in the house.<br>
As much as I wanted to interject, they sounded really into it, and I didn't want to ruin the mood.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Shimakaze：</span><br>
Wow, Grandma, what big ears you have.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Jintsuu：</span><br>
All the better to hear you with, my child.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Shimakaze：</span><br>
Huh... and you have such big eyes too.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Jintsuu：</span><br>
All the better to see you and make sure you do not get into any trouble, my child.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Shimakaze：</span><br>
And those great big arms?! What are they for?!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Jintsuu：</span><br>
All the better to hug you with...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Shimakaze：</span><br>
Gosh, this sure is a true-to-life wolf outfit you've got, Grandma!<br>
What about your mouth? Why is it so big?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Jintsuu：</span><br>
All the better... to gobble you up with, little rabbit!<br>
Graaghh!<br>
<br>
The wolf dropped her grandmotherly facade and got ready to pounce on the White Rabbit.<br>
That's when I decided to...<br>
<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项1：Wait until the right time to act</span>'''''<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项2：Use the poisoned apple</span>'''''<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Shimakaze：</span><br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项1）</span>'''''What?! You were the Big Bad Wolf all along?! No! Please don't eat meeeee!<br>
<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项1）</span>'''''The White Rabbit, having finally seen through the disguise, made a mad dash toward me, with the wolf following closely behind.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Jintsuu：</span><br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项1）</span>'''''A red hood...? So the Commander's playing the role of Little Red Riding Hood...<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项1）</span>'''''Here I thought Shimakaze's appearance was down to a mistake, but it seems everything is in order!<br>
<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项1）</span>'''''The wolf abruptly changed targets and made a beeline for me.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Jintsuu：</span><br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项1）</span>'''''Now, Commander, let's see how you'll get out of thi– Hmph?!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Jintsuu：</span><br>
This apple... it's poisoned...!<br>
<br>
I acted quickly and took out the poisoned apple, which the wolf bit down on. She keeled over fell and flat on the floor.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Shimakaze：</span><br>
Phew... Thank you for saving me, Commander!<br>
<br>
"So I just used the apple meant for Snow White to kill the Big Bad Wolf... What a plot twist."<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Cheshire：</span><br>
Owneeer! There you are!<br>
Lookie! I found Biloxi locked up in a castle, so I rescued and led her here!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Biloxi：</span><br>
We're finally reunited, my love.<br>
You won't believe this – Snow White arrived at the castle with an army. While they and the queen's troops were busy fighting, that's when Cheshire and I fled.<br>
<br>
I'd lost all grasp of the story at this point, but it seemed like all the characters' problems had been resolved.<br>
In other words, the story came to a close.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Enterprise：</span><br>
Congratulations. You've completed the Forest of Fables.<br>
What did you think of it, Master?<br>
<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项1："It was pretty enjoyable, all in all."</span>'''''<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项2："It was all over the place."</span>'''''<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项3："It was the most fun I'd had in a while!"</span>'''''<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Enterprise：</span><br>
I see. One could say that's more or less the response we expected.<br>
This attraction is the product of a myriad of ideas from the production team, so it's unavoidable that some liberties would be taken with the source material.<br>
Be that as it may, I believe that was worth it as long as you and everyone involved had fun.<br>
But we can make it even better. Next time, we'll invite some more people and make a bunch of improvements.<br>
When that time comes, you'll be welcome to play again, Master.<br>
