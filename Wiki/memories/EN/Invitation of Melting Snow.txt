Invitation of Melting Snow<br>
<br>
A Breeze Under the Moon<br>
The new moon hangs high, casting a subtle light on a natural hot spring amid a pine forest.<br>
Steam rises all around on this relaxing night. The silence is gently broken by a splash of water.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Trieste：</span><br>
My, this is hot... Excuse me, I'm going to get up for a minute, Commander. I'm starting to feel lightheaded...<br>
How's the water for you? Are you sure you can handle it?<br>
<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项1："The temperature is perfect."</span>'''''<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项2："It's a bit too hot."</span>'''''<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Trieste：</span><br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项1）</span>'''''I see. You must be used to bathing in hot springs.<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项1）</span>'''''Ahem... I need some time to cool off. I feel like I'm burning up...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Trieste：</span><br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项2）</span>'''''It's not just me, then. I thought I was the odd one out, since Trento looks so comfortable.<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项2）</span>'''''Meanwhile, I feel like I'm burning up...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Trento：</span><br>
Burning up, hmm? Is it because of the water, or because the Commander is here?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Trieste：</span><br>
Enough teasing, Trento!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Trento：</span><br>
Heehee♪<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Trieste：</span><br>
Ugh... Commander, don't force yourself to stay in. If you need a break, you can feel the breeze with me.<br>
Speaking of which... It feels wonderful. With my legs still in the water, I don't feel cold at all.<br>
...Hey. I know I'm always strict with you, and we rarely ever get to have a heart-to-heart.<br>
I want you to know I, like everyone else, appreciate how much you care about us.<br>
And I care a lot about you, too. In fact, I think I...<br>
...Um, never mind! The heat is clearly getting to my head.<br>
Whew... Anyway, the night is still young. Let us enjoy the water for a while longer.<br>

Melting in the Heat<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Grozny：</span><br>
I've never felt this hot in my whole life...<br>
Ugghh... I think I'm going to croak...<br>
Comrade Commander, get me water... Cold water... Hurry...<br>
*gulp gulp*...<br>
...Pfahh! Ahh, that's much better. I'm back from the brink.<br>
It won't be long before it feels hot again, though. This back-and-forth is gonna make me melt...<br>
...Why are you here anyway, Comrade Commander?<br>
<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项1："Making sure you don't melt like ice cream."</span>'''''<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项2："I want to enjoy the sauna with you."</span>'''''<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Grozny：</span><br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项1）</span>'''''I'll be fine. The melting thing is just hyperbole, you know.<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项1）</span>'''''Heat just isn't my strong suit. I'm used to the cold.<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项1）</span>'''''If you really need to keep an eye on me, at least sit down. Here, I'll make some space.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Grozny：</span><br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项2）</span>'''''Oh, okay. I'll make some space so you can sit next to me.<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项2）</span>'''''They say saunas are good for your circulation. A lot of my Northern Parliament friends use them.<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项2）</span>'''''But in my case, they don't do anything. Other than making me feel like I'll melt, anyway...<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项2）</span>'''''If I were a snowman, I'd already be a puddle on the ground by now... Aahh...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Grozny：</span><br>
I sit down beside her and proceed to explain how saunas are meant to be used.<br>
...So after warming up a bit, you go out to take a cold bath, then have a break, rinse and repeat?<br>
That explains a lot... Yeah. Let me have an ice-cold oxy-cola to clear my head. *gulp gulp*...<br>
...Food isn't allowed in the sauna? No drinks either?<br>
But I need to rehydrate! I won't leave this sauna alive without something to wet my whistle!<br>
Pl-please, one more glass with ice in it!<br>
I promise, just this one glass, then I'll go out and rest!<br>
...Pfahh! That hits the spot. I'm starting to enjoy this...<br>

Invitation of Melting Snow<br>
<br>
The Snow Wolf's Other Side<br>
Inside a hot spring situated in a dense forest, there's a calm, quiet little corner.<br>
Amid a veil of steam and the sound of running water, there's someone waiting for me.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Kursk：</span><br>
There you are. Come on, sit down.<br>
I reserved a spot for you, knowing you'd find this place. Call it my hunter's intuition.<br>
The question is, who's the prey here? You, or me?<br>
Leaving her question open-ended, I sit down to enjoy this hidden gem of a hot spring with her.<br>
I've never been in spring water this warm before. It's novel, that's for sure.<br>
<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项1："Elaborate. What do you think about it?"</span>'''''<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Kursk：</span><br>
Hard to say. What I can tell you is that it's nice to relax and unwind every once in a while.<br>
It's made better by the luxury that is solitude. I wouldn't enjoy this nearly as much if I had to rub shoulders with others.<br>
That's the way of the lone wolf. After a tiring day of hunting alone, you regain your strength alone.<br>
...Mind you, I'm no misanthrope. It's just that I'm not used to being around people. Other than you, anyway.<br>
What I am used to is the freezing wind, dragging blizzards across the tundra all day long. Sooner or later, it'll make you want to retreat to a warm den.<br>
That's what this place is. But whether the warmth comes from the water, or you being here, I'm not sure.<br>
...Maybe, just maybe, you've managed to tame this snow wolf.<br>
You know, a hunter must always be sharpening their fangs and senses alike if they're to survive.<br>
But, since I have you to watch my back, I can let my guard down and take a load off.<br>
So, let's stay here for a while. I want to savor this rare moment of relaxation.<br>
...With you by my side.<br>

<br>
The Roosting Angel<br>
As I'm walking down the silent and snowy hike trail, I hear the rustling of clothes from a nearby open-air hot spring.<br>
Approaching to investigate, I spot a familiar face in the midst of a prayer.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Joffre：</span><br>
"...Thank you, Holy Iris, for this respite at the end of a tiring journey..."<br>
"...I am forever grateful for your hands that lead my body and spirit towards a place to rest..."<br>
......<br>
Commander, it's poor manners to sneak up on someone, particularly while also violating their privacy.<br>
Pray tell, did you commit the grave sin of peeping while I was changing?<br>
<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项1："I didn't see anything."</span>'''''<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项2："The Iris willed me to do it!"</span>'''''<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Joffre：</span><br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项1）</span>'''''Hmm. I swear I sensed your gaze, but perhaps that was a figment of my imagination.<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项1）</span>'''''Since I cannot prove your guilt, I will take your word for it.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Joffre：</span><br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项2）</span>'''''...The Holy Iris would never will such indecency.<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项2）</span>'''''I don't buy your excuse for even a moment, but I will let it slide this once. The Iris teaches us to forgive.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Joffre：</span><br>
Say, are you here to enjoy the view and bask in the hot spring's warmth? If so, you're welcome to.<br>
...Yes, I am offering you to join me in the water.<br>
While Joffre's tone remains calm and neutral, her cheeks seem to redden ever so slightly at the idea.<br>
How is it, Commander?<br>
Can you feel the hot spring rejuvenate your body and spirit, even if only a little bit?<br>
The water warms me from my shoulders to my toes, washing away all my pent-up weariness.<br>
I hope this experience reinvigorates you in the same way it did me.<br>
Also, after we're done, I'd like to give you a massage. To improve your circulation, of course.<br>
Trust me, you'll want to enjoy this vacation to its fullest. You may find yourself subject to the Holy Iris' guidance otherwise~<br>

<br>
Thawing in the Snow<br>
In a misty open-air hot spring, there's a girl sitting on the blue-tinted stones, watching the snow around her melt.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Voroshilov：</span><br>
There you are. Glad you kept your word, Comrade Commander.<br>
<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项1："I'm not late, am I?"</span>'''''<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Voroshilov：</span><br>
Nope, you're on time. I finished changing just a minute ago.<br>
What do you think of this place? I felt it'd be good to have a hot spring date, since you're always working so hard and deserve some relief.<br>
The water is the perfect temperature, and the scenery is pretty gorgeous as well.<br>
It's definitely one of my favorite spots. You can watch the snow fall and melt for hours while you rest up.<br>
Ahem... What are you waiting for? Come on, let's go in the water.<br>
Voroshilov and I have a great time in the hot spring.<br>
While the water warms my body, her touch warms my heart. I almost feel like I'm going to overheat.<br>
Are you okay? Are you in over your head?<br>
Maybe the water is just a touch too hot? It would explain why you're blushing.<br>
I don't get the chance to explain myself before she starts clinging to me with a look of concern.<br>
<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项1："The temperature's a bit high..."</span>'''''<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项2："Not really. The temperature's fine."</span>'''''<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项3："That's just because I feel so refreshed."</span>'''''<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Voroshilov：</span><br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项1）</span>'''''Oh... Yeah, I see what you mean. I'm starting to sweat.<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项1）</span>'''''That's why they call it a HOT spring, I suppose...<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项1）</span>'''''(Moments alone with Comrade Commander don't come every day... I need to seize this opportunity!)<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Voroshilov：</span><br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项2）</span>'''''It's not the water that's making me feel so hot. It's the fact that I'm rubbing shoulders with her.<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项2）</span>'''''Then you've probably been soaking for too long...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Voroshilov：</span><br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项3）</span>'''''O-oh. That's all? You clearly handle the heat a lot better than I do...<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项3）</span>'''''That's good, though. I'm glad to hear it.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Voroshilov：</span><br>
Whew... By the way, there's more stuff to do after this bath. We can go on a stroll through the forest or the city and take in the snowy vistas.<br>
Anything you want, as long as I can be with you. I want you all to myself, at least for today.<br>
She holds my hand. It feels even warmer than the water.<br>
This is only the start of our date. The best has yet to come.<br>
