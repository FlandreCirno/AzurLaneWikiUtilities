Mikasa's Model Museum<br>
<br>
Chapter 1: A Collection Destroyed<br>
One day, at the port...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Zuikaku：</span><br>
Wow... So this is the legendary...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Shoukaku：</span><br>
Mikasa's model collection!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Mikasa：</span><br>
Mhm! I've been wanting to show it off for a while. But the thought of it going public makes me a little hesitant...<br>
However, I have finally overcome all that! Step up! Have a look-see! Feast your eyes upon the collection I poured my blood, sweat, and tears into!<br>
Make sure you look at the finer details! See that painstakingly restored gun turret? How about the features on that bridge?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Zuikaku：</span><br>
This is incredible! Who knew Mikasa was collecting all these model ships?<br>
Seeing a model of myself is a little embarrassing though...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Shoukaku：</span><br>
She's even got models of our esteemed seeeniors from the First Carrier Division~<br>
Just looking at them gives me the urge to scoop them up and do... "something." Hehehe~♪<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Zuikaku：</span><br>
Erm, Shoukaku...?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Hiei：</span><br>
Mikasa, your collection is quite impressive... (whispering) I would love to throw a party in this room...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Shoukaku：</span><br>
Hiei, do you mean...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Mikasa：</span><br>
Haha! Gather 'round now, kids! I'll give you a little tour. See, these here are your ships that were forged in the crucible of war, and these over here are your standard aircraft carriers...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Kisaragi：</span><br>
Mu-Mutsuki, let go...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Mutsuki：</span><br>
Hurry, Kisaragi, c'mere! She's got models of us Mutsuki-class ships~<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Kisaragi：</span><br>
Wooooww! Miss Mikasa... she's so cool~<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Mikasa：</span><br>
Hehehe, the little Mutsukis are here! Have a look around. But watch your feet and don't trip.<br>
I almost forgot, my little collection room here still has its alarms all wired up. So everybody be careful about what you touch. Don't put your hands all over everything!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Mutsuki：</span><br>
Huh? What's that?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Kisaragi：</span><br>
Aaaahhh! Mu-Mutsuki, don't push it... That button says "Danger, do not push"...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Mutsuki：</span><br>
Unnnfff... Uughhhh... It's so high. Huh? "Do... not push"?<br>
Hm... They have to know that only makes people want to push it... I'm gonna push it!<br>
<br>
A heavy rumbling sound echoed throughout the room as the floor began to shake violently.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Mikasa：</span><br>
Oh no. That sound... it's the self-destruct system?!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Shoukaku：</span><br>
Wh-why does your collection have a self-destruct system?!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Mikasa：</span><br>
For... well... you need to be prepared, just in case...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">{namecode:96}：</span><br>
Look out, Mikasa!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">{namecode:82}：</span><br>
Aaaagh!<br>
<br>
With another loud rumble, the entire collection room began to crumble.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Hiei：</span><br>
Her collection... it's been reduced to a pile of rubble...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Mikasa：</span><br>
But... but why...? Waaaahhhh!<br>
My pride and joy... All my models of the sweet little kids... They're all... Waaahhhh!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Zuikaku：</span><br>
Hey now, Mikasa! Pull yourself together!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Shoukaku：</span><br>
She's right. Now isn't the time for a breakdown. Let's think about how to fix this...<br>
Now now, Mutsuki and Kisaragi, we don't need you crying either. Zuikaku, you go get help. We have a lot to do here.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Zuikaku：</span><br>
Good idea, Shoukaku! I'm on my way!<br>
<br>
Mikasa spent the entire day completely inconsolable.<br>
When Zuikaku brought news of what had happened to the other Sakura ships, they all came together for the common purpose of restoring their former flagship's collection to its former glory.<br>

Mikasa's Model Museum<br>
<br>
Chapter 2: The Patient Veteran<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Mikasa：</span><br>
How could this have happened?<br>
My whole collection, gone in the blink of an eye. Waaaahh! And now I've got nothing to show the kids.<br>
Hey... you over there... Mutsuki, right?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Mutsuki：</span><br>
Ummm... I did... something bad.<br>
I'm so sorry, Miss Mikasaaa! Waaaahhh... I'm sorry I'm such a bad girl! Waaaaaahhhhh!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Mikasa：</span><br>
Oy... It's okay, now. Settle down. No more crying, Mutsuki. There there... show me a smile. Smile for a candy~ Coochee coochee coo!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Mutsuki：</span><br>
That tickles! Ahahaha... it tickles!<br>
But, Miss Mikasa, you really... You're not mad at me?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Mikasa：</span><br>
What's done is done. Getting mad wouldn't help.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Mutsuki：</span><br>
Um... since I did something bad... I have to find some way to help fix it!<br>
Unnnff... Nnngg... I just have to move this... over there!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Shoukaku：</span><br>
Oh my, look at you, Mutsuki!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Zuikaku：</span><br>
Hey, be careful! That box is going to fall!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Mutsuki：</span><br>
Don't worry... I'm good at transport missions!<br>
<br>
Before long, Mutsuki had made it across the port.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Mutsuki：</span><br>
I'm here to help!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Hiei：</span><br>
You're so enthusiastic. Our little Mutsuki is growing up.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Mutsuki：</span><br>
I have to cheer Mikasa up!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Hiei：</span><br>
You'll get there. Now open your mouth! I think someone's earned a candy.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Mutsuki：</span><br>
Oooh! Orange flavor! I love it!<br>
But I still have a lot of work to do...<br>
<br>
The next day...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Kisaragi：</span><br>
Um... Mutsuki, you don't have to walk so fast.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Minazuki：</span><br>
Wow! Mutsuki's really pushing it today.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Uzuki：</span><br>
W... wait up. *Pant*... *pant*... so fast...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Mutsuki：</span><br>
Come on! Everybody pitch in and help me move these!<br>
Candy! Candy! Everyone who helps gets a piece of Miss Mikasa's candy!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Kisaragi：</span><br>
Wow~ Mutsuki actually shared her candy with us...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Mutsuki：</span><br>
Let's do our best, everyone! We'll fix up the model museum as soon as we can!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">{namecode:133}&{namecode:137}&{namecode:34}：</span><br>
Okaaaay!<br>
<br>
And so began the Mutsukis' monumental task.<br>

Mikasa's Model Museum<br>
<br>
Chapter 3: The Hardworking Kids<br>
With everyone pitching in, little by little, the room was starting to come together. Even Mikasa's model ships were slowly being rebuilt.<br>
At the same time, more volunteers from the Sakura Empire were showing up to help out.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Akashi：</span><br>
No repair operation is complete without Akashi, nya!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Shiranui：</span><br>
The situation is clear... we should offer our assistance.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Akashi：</span><br>
You just let Akashi handle the material procurement, nya! Then send the bill to the Commander, nya!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Shiranui：</span><br>
Everyone certainly seems to be in high spirits.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Mutsuki：</span><br>
Unnnfff! Nnnng! Almost there! Kisaragi, pass me the brush. I need it up here.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Kisaragi：</span><br>
Oh... Okay!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Hiei：</span><br>
Hey! Mutsuki, Kisaragi, you two be careful!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Fubuki：</span><br>
We're here to help too!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ayanami：</span><br>
I learned a little bit about model building from L.I... It's time to put those skills to use...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Yuubari：</span><br>
Models, huh...? Sounds interesting...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Fusou：</span><br>
We're here! I hope we're not too late?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Yamashiro：</span><br>
We made lunch for everyone~ Tada~! Come and help yourselves~!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Zuikaku：</span><br>
Oh! Right on time. I was just getting hungry.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Shoukaku：</span><br>
Now now, Zuikaku, let's not be greedy.<br>
But you do have a point. We should take a break right about now.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Mutsuki：</span><br>
Ooooh! Yamashiro! Yamashiro! Did you bring any candy?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Kisaragi：</span><br>
Mutsuki, you can't eat candy for lunch...<br>
<br>
Not far off, Mikasa watched the youngsters working hard on the ruins of her collection with a proud smile on her face...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Mikasa：</span><br>
I was sad to see my model ships destroyed... But I'm also glad I got to see the Sakura girls come together like this.<br>
All that work I put in certainly didn't go to waste. Thanks to these kids...<br>

Mikasa's Model Museum<br>
<br>
Chapter 4: The Model Museum Reopens!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Zuikaku：</span><br>
Wow... So this is the legendary...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Shoukaku：</span><br>
Mikasa's model collection (reborn)!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Mikasa：</span><br>
Mhm! The model ships, the whole room actually, it's all good as new! A fully upgraded museum ready to share with everyone in the port~<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Hiei：</span><br>
I can't believe how quickly it all came together... I think we should scale up tonight's celebration too!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Shoukaku：</span><br>
The glass here is so shiny... It's hurting my eyes...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Mikasa：</span><br>
Thanks for pitching in, everyone. I never thought I'd have my collection back so soon. *Sniff*...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Mutsuki：</span><br>
Huh? Why are you crying, Miss Mikasa...?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Mikasa：</span><br>
Tears of joy, little one.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Mutsuki：</span><br>
I'm sorry... Mutsuki won't press random buttons anymore...<br>
I promise Mutsuki will be a good girl from now on. I won't touch anything.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Mikasa：</span><br>
Uh-huh. That's a good girl, Mutsuki.<br>
All right, listen up! The glory days of the past are behind us, but today is about striving together for a glorious future!<br>
(Whispering) This button opens the curtain over the door. Just press it and the curtain goes up...<br>
Now to officially unveil the new museum... Here goes!<br>
<br>
Rumble rumble rumble...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Zuikaku：</span><br>
Um... why did the room start shaking when you pushed that button?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Mutsuki：</span><br>
Oh no... is everything going to break again?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Mikasa：</span><br>
What? This isn't the curtain switch?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Zuikaku：</span><br>
Hey, something just came out of the room.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Shoukaku：</span><br>
It's... a new display case?<br>
<br>
Sitting proudly inside the brand new display case was...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Zuikaku：</span><br>
That's... a model ship? Oh! That's a model of Mikasa!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Mikasa：</span><br>
Huh? Turns out it was my secret collectible button?!<br>
Who could've known... How could I have pressed the wrong button...<br>
I didn't want anyone to see my model ship...<br>
I can't believe I've embarrassed myself like this in front of the kids... is this what they call "exhibitionism"?!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Shoukaku：</span><br>
Mikasa, who taught you that word...?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Mutsuki：</span><br>
Wooooowww! Mikasa's model is so coooool!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Zuikaku：</span><br>
Ahaha! I never thought I'd get to see Mikasa turn so red~<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Akashi：</span><br>
And that's the story of how the all-new Mikasa Museum had its grand opening, nya! Congratulations all around, nya~<br>
<br>
And so that story draws to a close. The girls of the Sakura Empire and Mikasa carried on with their daily lives at the port, the same as always. That is, except for a certain Commander, who suddenly received a shockingly large bill of expenses.<br>
