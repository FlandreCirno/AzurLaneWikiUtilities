A Whirlwind Romance<br>
<br>
1 Touching Fingertips<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Casablanca：</span><br>
(Yesterday, I was notified that I was to assume the role of secretary.)<br>
(Even though it's my first day on the job, I still find myself in disbelief as I head to the office. Me, secretary?)<br>
(I was hand-picked by the commander... but why would someone like me be chosen in the first place?)<br>
(I suppose this means that my "down-to-earth work ethic" has been recognized, but...)<br>
<br>
*knock* *knock*<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Casablanca：</span><br>
Reporting in. I am Casablanca, and I will now be assisting you as secretary.<br>
I will give it my all to make sure that my duties are completed, from official affairs to miscellaneous chores. I look forward to working with you.<br>
Now if you'll excuse me, let's begin today's work. Shall I start by organizing your documents?<br>
(I'll follow the commander's instructions and organize all the documents into their respective files.)<br>
(If I can finish this quickly, I'll have enough time left over to help with the paperwork as well.)<br>
Thank you for your praise. I try to be efficient.<br>
But judging from your expression, Commander, you seem to have taken stock of my abilities beforehand.<br>
I am quite proficient at rear support on the battlefield, so if you think about things that way, it makes sense that I would seem suitable for the role of secretary.<br>
In any case...<br>
(What was that sound...? The commander's pen just fell onto the ground?)<br>
Commander, something fell just now...<br>
(I lean down to pick up the fallen object, and that was when...)<br>
–––!<br>
(My fingertips brush against those of the commander, who had reached out at the same time!)<br>
(I draw my hand back in a hurry, thinking of how to apologize.)<br>
...Sorry about that. I'll get back to work now.<br>
(And like that, I began my first day as secretary, struggling to manage the appropriate distance between me and the commander.)<br>

<br>
2 Too Many Appointments<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Casablanca：</span><br>
(Compared to when I first began my secretary work, the location of the supplies and documents in the office had become almost second nature to me.)<br>
Commander, speaking of the report that we submitted to the Naval HQ a few days ago...<br>
<br>
*knock* *knock*<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Casablanca：</span><br>
Oh, it seems that we have guests. Who is it?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ranger：</span><br>
Dagnabbit, Commander! You were here all along!<br>
Ah, I knew it! I can tell from your dopey expression that you forgot all about it! You did this last time, and the time before as well! Forgetting all about me because of your work!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Casablanca：</span><br>
P-please calm down. What's the matter?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ranger：</span><br>
We were supposed to get lunch together today, Commander! How could you be so forgetful...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Casablanca：</span><br>
I'm very sorry, but we've had a mountain of work to get through today...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ranger：</span><br>
I know... Can't do anything about that, but— Commander, please make sure you remember next time!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Casablanca：</span><br>
(A few hours after that...)<br>
Commander, I noticed something about the last delivery of supplies that arrived a few days ago...<br>
<br>
*knock* *knock*<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Casablanca：</span><br>
We seem to have a lot of guests today. Who is it?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Long Island：</span><br>
Com~man~der~!! Why'd you stand me up? You're clearly right here~!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Casablanca：</span><br>
...You too, huh?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Long Island：</span><br>
You promised that we'd have an epic gaming session today! This ghost won't forgive oathbreakers~!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Casablanca：</span><br>
I'm very sorry. As the secretary ship, please allow me to offer my apologies instead. I hope it will be enough for you to calm down?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Long Island：</span><br>
*sigh*... If you're going to say that much, I can't exactly stay mad...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Casablanca：</span><br>
...*sigh*. Finally, she's gone. Commander, you seem to have some issues with keeping your schedule in order.<br>
While it is certainly admirable that you've won the admiration of so many here at port, reneging on your agreements, and repeatedly too, is simply unacceptable.<br>
I'm sorry, Commander.<br>
(I've decided... I'm going to make this right.)<br>
From now on, I will manage everything on your schedule. This is also for the sake of our future work.<br>
.........<br>
.........<br>
A-anyway, do you understand how serious this is?<br>
(I suppose my assertiveness left Commander lost for words...)<br>

<br>
3 Her Serious Side<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ranger：</span><br>
Commander, today was a ton of fun. I hope you'll remember to keep your promises in the future, just like today.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Long Island：</span><br>
Commander, that game was a ton of fun~! If you have free time some other day, just let me know~<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Casablanca：</span><br>
Coming up soon on your calendar, you'll have baseball practice with Bogue early tomorrow morning, followed by a tour of Langley's tactical class the following day.<br>
Hm? My schedule management has been very helpful?<br>
...I'm glad to receive your praise, but keep in mind that I place greater emphasis on your work arrangements than on your social ones. You'll be getting busy again soon.<br>
Naturally, I'll also be supporting you to the best of my abilities.<br>
(I was surprised to see Commander nodding off...)<br>
(Actually, why was it so hard for me to just say something nice back, like "you've been doing a great job"...?)<br>
(No, this is also necessary. You can't lead this port without making some sacrifices.)<br>
Now then, that's all the work finished for the day. Commander, you'll have an early start tomorrow morning, so make sure you go to bed on time.<br>
Phew... I rarely get to finish work early like this, so maybe I should unwind by watching a nice movie.<br>
It should be somewhere on this shelf— Ah, here it is.<br>
Need to turn off the lights too... Maybe I should grab myself a drink while I'm at it——<br>
(It's been about an hour and a half since I started watching the movie alone in my room, and it's about to reach the climax scene—)<br>
Ah... it's so tragic... Even though she knows how important that person is to her, she still—<br>
<br>
*knock* *knock*<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Casablanca：</span><br>
...Huh? Who the heck is coming at this hour? And I was just getting to the most important scene too...!<br>
Come in, the door's not locked—<br>
...Huh?<br>
C-Commander?! P-please give me a moment!!<br>
Ugh...<br>
(Ahhh! So embarrassing! I was practically shaking...!)<br>
(Why would Commander be here? Wait, was it because I said something about watching a movie...?)<br>
Oh, I left something behind at the office? I see... thank you. I was careless.<br>
Huh? Yes, I'm watching a movie...<br>
B-but it's nothing special. You probably wouldn't like it...<br>
(...It's so embarrassing! Even though I've been so strict with Commander, I can't just say I have a hobby like this...)<br>
(There's no way I can tell anyone that I'm into sappy romance movies...!)<br>

<br>
4 Hard to Explain<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Casablanca：</span><br>
(Sigh... the heroine from the movie I watched last time... Why did she choose to say goodbye to the one she loved? I can't stand it...)<br>
(I understand that she did it out of consideration for her partner's position, but... surely there's a way to pull through as long as there's love...)<br>
*Sigh*...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Bataan：</span><br>
Look, Princeton. Is that Casablanca over there?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Princeton ：</span><br>
Yup. She looks awfully lost in thought.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Bataan：</span><br>
That reminds me, I heard that she recently became the secretary ship. Maybe she has a lot of stuff to think about.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Casablanca：</span><br>
(And she never even confessed... kind of like me and Commander...)<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Bataan：</span><br>
How are you doing, Casablanca?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Casablanca：</span><br>
Hwah?!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Princeton ：</span><br>
Woah, what happened?!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Casablanca：</span><br>
Huh...? Oh, um, my apologies. I wasn't watching where I was going.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Bataan：</span><br>
Something must really be bothering you... Whatever it is, I'll be glad to lend an ear!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Casablanca：</span><br>
(Maybe Bataan would be able to understand...)<br>
(About my hobbies... and about me and Commander...)<br>
(Wait, huh?! ...Just what's gotten into me?)<br>
Um, it's alright, it's nothing serious...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Princeton ：</span><br>
You're not acting your normal self, Casablanca. It's like you're pushing yourself way too hard or something.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Casablanca：</span><br>
Th-that's not really the case... If anything, it's that...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Bataan：</span><br>
What is it then?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Casablanca：</span><br>
(There's no way I can tell them that I was just comparing myself to the heroine of a romance movie... Gosh, that'd be so embarrassing...)<br>
Well, um, let's just say that there hypothetically were two shipgirls.<br>
(Yeah, I'll try to cover it up by comparing it to some hierarchical relationship in the fleet!)<br>
—So that's the gist of things. Two people who've concealed their status from each other. Once those facts get revealed, there's no way they'd go back to the way things were before, right?<br>
For two people who are in an equal relationship, wouldn't it be way too ridiculous to introduce some inequality between them that would split them apart?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Princeton ：</span><br>
Uhh... Do we have any notions of status here at port? I mean, even if you're reassigned somewhere, you'll still run into everyone at some point during battles.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Casablanca：</span><br>
Huh? Oh... Good point...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Bataan：</span><br>
Besides, knowing that one person is the boss while the other is a subordinate... isn't that more conducive to the flow of combat?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Casablanca：</span><br>
Th-that's not exactly the case... It's more like being unable to go back to having the same relationship as before, and the "sorrow" that comes from that...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Princeton & Bataan：</span><br>
What does "sorrow" have to do anything?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Casablanca：</span><br>
Uhhhh... I, I didn't mean it like that! It's just that...<br>
(How do I even explain this...)<br>
(The relationship between the commander and the secretary ship should be one of boss and subordinate, and yet... because Commander keeps listening to me, it's as if...)<br>
(Ugh... Why am I overthinking this in the first place...)<br>

5 Advice From Friends<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Casablanca：</span><br>
Commander, do you have any plans after this? —Huh? We'll have more visitors?<br>
I don't recall seeing anything like that on the schedule— Oh, it was a last-minute decision from the Naval HQ?<br>
I understand. There's enough room in the schedule to accommodate a little change. So, who are these visitors?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Princeton ：</span><br>
It's me and Bataan.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Bataan：</span><br>
Hi there, Casablanca. It's nice to see you again.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Casablanca：</span><br>
Oh, it's you guys...<br>
(They're checking on me... Did I make them worried about me because of last time?)<br>
By the way, did you need something from the commander?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Princeton ：</span><br>
Nothing major. The two of us are conducting a mock exercise, and Commander is in charge of the planning operations.<br>
Don't worry, we won't take too much of your time— Come on, Commander, let's talk business.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Casablanca：</span><br>
(Their plan was missing a crucial step, and they weren't able to come to any decisions. Time continued to pass.)<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Princeton ：</span><br>
We're not getting anywhere like this... Let's call it a day for now, and try to reconvene some other time.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Casablanca：</span><br>
Then, I'll record the issues we've discussed so far. I'll gather any other materials needed for our next meeting as well.<br>
(Originally, this was supposed to be a discussion between Commander, Princeton, and Bataan... As secretary, I don't have the time to be getting involved like this...)<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Bataan：</span><br>
We appreciate the help, but are you sure it's fine? We ended up using a bunch of your time after all... so you don't have to force yourself.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Princeton ：</span><br>
Yeah. Just because you're the secretary doesn't mean that you have to take on every little thing.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Casablanca：</span><br>
It's fine, I can handle this. Commander, mind if I stay after to get some extra work done?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Princeton ：</span><br>
Commander, Casablanca takes her work extremely seriously, to the point of forgetting to eat. You'd better not be taking advantage of that!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Bataan：</span><br>
That's right! She was sighing and saying something about feeling "sorrow" earlier—<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Casablanca：</span><br>
*cough* Ahhh! Ahem! I already said I'm totally fine! There's nothing to worry about!<br>
(I was able to help plan out the strategy for the mock exercise, but...)<br>
(Considering my status as shipgirl, that isn't something I should be doing in the first place...)<br>
(Argh, just what kind of relation do I want to have with Commander anyway?)<br>

<br>
6 Passionate Thoughts<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Casablanca：</span><br>
(I was helping Commander record down the things that had been discussed, based on our reference materials. Before I knew it, it was already late at night.)<br>
(That took a long time... But if possible, I'd still like to look for some even more helpful materials.)<br>
Um, Commander, make sure you remember to check if the records I made are complete.<br>
(Commander often has difficulty keeping track of everything due to the sheer amount of work, so that's why I have to be firm.)<br>
(I clenched my hands into fists to psych myself up...)<br>
(And that's when I saw the fountain pen in Commander's hand.)<br>
(A fountain pen, huh... There was one just like it in that movie I watched before. Actually, that was the starting point for an entire love story. What a masterpiece.)<br>
(Now that I think of it... my hand also bumped into Commander's on that first day I came into the office... That was so heart-throbbing—)<br>
(W-wait, what's gotten into my all of a sudden? I have to stay focused so we can finish up with work as soon as possible.)<br>
(I'm trying to shake the thoughts out of my head, but my heart is still racing from just thinking about it...)<br>
(In that movie, the person who helped the heroine in the movie left his pen behind as he left, and that was the beginning of their whirlwind romance...)<br>
(When they later met again, and that was when she realized that he was out of her league, he even gently put a coat over her when got soaked in the rain...)<br>
(Commander is also out my league, my superior... But, Commander's gentleness is the same, just like in the movie...... Oh gosh, what am I fantasizing about——)<br>
.........<br>
(I guess I ended up dozing off while thinking about Commander because I had been working so hard...)<br>
This won't do... I'm still at work...<br>
Ugh... It's all because I let myself get those weird idle thoughts that I ended up drowsy...<br>
(Huh... What's this odd feeling on my back?)<br>
...A c-coat? When did this get here? ...And, this is... Commander's?<br>
(I stood up while muttering to myself and turned around. Commander, who had noticed me getting up, slowly stood up as well.)<br>
I'm so sorry, Commander! I completely fell asleep! How embarrassing of me to even make you lend me your coat... I'll get back to work right away...<br>
<br>
Thud!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Casablanca：</span><br>
Ahh!<br>
(In my panic, I spun around and caught my foot on something, and I felt myself going down– Suddenly... I felt myself being tightly hugged in Commander's arms!)<br>
Eek! I, I'm so sorry, Commander...<br>
(Our faces are so close... We're so close that I feel like I can't even breathe...)<br>
Ah...!<br>
(As soon as our eyes met, Commander promptly let go of me.)<br>
(My heart was pounding like crazy and it just wouldn't stop... This was just like a scene out of a romance movie, except with Commander...)<br>
(In that movie, the heroine...)<br>
Um, Commander, actually...!<br>
Huh? ...I should head back for the night and get some rest? Y-you're right...<br>
(The words were caught in my throat. I could only leave the office obediently and head back to get some sleep.)<br>
(But that was when I made a single wish to myself, from the bottom of my heart.)<br>

7 Premonitions of Romance<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Casablanca：</span><br>
(And thus, it was my last day of secretary ship duties.)<br>
Um... By the way, do you have any free time today?<br>
You've been working so hard this whole time, Commander, so I'd like to treat you to dinner. Plus, I owe you for lending me your coat that other time.<br>
(I decided to myself, I would say everything I wanted to say during our dinner.)<br>
(Today, I have to tell Commander...!)<br>
Commander, I'd like to ask you again... Why'd you decide to make me the secretary?<br>
Huh? Because you thought it'd be nice to have a dependable person around? Wh-what, because of my serious personality?<br>
In other words, you've had a positive opinion of me? ...Err, um, don't worry about it! I was just curious!<br>
(Commander is the same as always... That's why today, I have to–)<br>
...By the way, we've been working so hard this whole time that we haven't had a chance to chat like this. We should've done this sooner.<br>
In any case, I really feel comfortable working with you. I hope that we can get to know each other even better as time passes.<br>
And I hope that you'll also get to know me better, little by little.<br>
...If you'd like, how about we watch a movie together?<br>
"What kind of movie?" Um, well... Actually, um... there's this one genre that I'm really into...<br>
Um, it's a little embarrassing to just say it straight up, but I'll give you a little hint. It has this line–<br>
(I tapped my glass with Commander's, and our eyes met again.)<br>
"Here's looking at you, kid." Ehehe~<br>
