Whence the Dust Settles<br>
<br>
1 Singularity on the Horizon<br>
Illusions swept across the world, trapping those within their range in a powerful dream. Meanwhile, in the Sakura Empire, Akagi had created a Singularity known as Naraka.<br>
With some help from the Eagle Union, the Dragon Empery vanquished the Storm that had long barred them from the sea. With their objectives accomplished, they rendezvoused with Nagato's fleet.<br>
Now, nearly all illusions across the world had been dealt with, but the Naraka Singularity posed a new problem. It covered the entirety of the Sakura Empire.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Nagato：</span><br>
Commander, I recognize the Singularity's shape... It looks like the Prime Barrier that protects our country.<br>
The Singularity must have appeared within the barrier and the barrier kept it from expanding beyond its boundary.<br>
That being the case, the Prime Barrier is in all likelihood still being sustained.<br>
This means that the worst-case scenario has yet to befall our country. Or so I hope.<br>
I hate to do this, but I must take my fleet with me and return back home.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ryuuhou：</span><br>
I will accompany you, Lady Nagato.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Nagato：</span><br>
Good.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
No. We must stick together. You might think this is an issue for you and your countrymen to deal with, but it isn't. It concerns all of us.<br>
You cooperated well with Enterprise's fleet when you dealt with that illusion before. She's still here, and now, I am, too.<br>
The crisis is not over yet, so we should all try to move as one.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Nagato：</span><br>
I see your point. If you insist, then I will comply.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Enterprise：</span><br>
Indiana, I want you to take your fleet and give support to the Commander and the Sakurans.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Indiana：</span><br>
Alright.<br>
<span style="color:#ffc960;">Kirov META：</span><br>
I'll come with you.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Indiana：</span><br>
You? You're with the Northern Parliament?<br>
<span style="color:#ffc960;">Kirov META：</span><br>
You could say that. I'm Kirov META. I've been a guest with them for a while now.<br>
I want to see this Naraka Singularity up close. Do you mind if I come along?<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Soyuz, what do you think?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Sovetsky Soyuz：</span><br>
If neither you nor Nagato have any objections, then I am fine with it.<br>
Furthermore, I'm willing to take my fleet and accompany you on your mission.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Is that okay with you, Nagato?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Nagato：</span><br>
The more support we have, the better. Thank you, Soyuz and Kirov.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Then we've got a solid force to bring to bear.<br>
The Northern Pariament's fleet, Indiana's fleet, and Nagato's fleet will head for the Sakura Empire. The rest will stay here and continue analyzing the locked Mirror Sea. Be on your guard.<br>
This Singularity is a serious threat. Be on the lookout for enemies along the way to the Sakuran mainland.<br>
<br>
Sometime later, aboard the Commander's vessel...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Memphis：</span><br>
The Empery's computing power has risen again and the Sea of Stars has adjusted the projected completion time accordingly once more.<br>
At the rate it's going, it should be done in six hours.<br>
It'll go even faster if the Empery provides us with yet more computational resources.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Wow, that's amazing.<br>
I'm curious why their computing power increases gradually like this. Why not use the maximum available from the start, like the Sea of Stars does?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Memphis：</span><br>
Hmm. Beats me.<br>
Maybe their supercomputer doesn't run around the clock, so it needs to warm up?<br>
Whatever the case, it lets us finally catch a breather. You should rest up while you have the chance.<br>
If anything happens, I'll let you know right away.<br>
<br>
So much has happened in so little time. First the Orthodoxy's joint exercise, then Operation Wind-Crushing Ice Dragon, then dealing with the illusions across the Pacific...<br>
I'd love to polish up our plan for this Singularity, but dreamland is calling for me. I need a nap.<br>
A vast galaxy dotted with thousands of stars unfolds before me.<br>

2 Where Camelot Has Gone<br>
Scapa Flow - Underground<br>
With Queen Elizabeth's role in dispelling the illusions complete, she returned to Scapa Flow, where she spent half a day.<br>
Vanguard and her team were still missing and she hadn't heard a word from Camelot.<br>
Then, after pursuing the likely culprits behind what could have caused the gate to malfunction...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Queen Elizabeth：</span><br>
...It was no malfunction. The gate's safety mechanism was activated.<br>
That's it. That's the only explanation.<br>
My META counterpart set it up to activate only if an outside threat invades test site beta, or if someone from test site beta enters the Singularity...<br>
I have no way of verifying if the former is the case or not, but perhaps it's the other one – someone from this branch invaded Camelot.<br>
Could that really be? Did one of those illusions sneak its way inside?<br>
Then the safety should've been disengaged now that the illusions have been disposed of...<br>
Yet it has not.<br>
At the same time, there is no way my META self installed a faulty system. Queen Elizabeth does not make mistakes!<br>
Then, by process of elimination, there's only one interpretation left...<br>
An external threat has infiltrated test site beta.<br>
And of course – my META counterpart is off hunting for that bloody whale when our branch is in danger! Ugh!<br>
This can't wait any longer. I need to call her at once!<br>
<br>
The queen anxiously closed her eyes and activated the communication device her META counterpart left for her.<br>
The next thing she felt, it was like her mind was beamed from Scapa Flow into the Queen's Light.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Queen Elizabeth：</span><br>
Bloody hell... That's impressive.<br>
Oi! Other Elizabeth! Where are you? I need to talk to you!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Miss D：</span><br>
Whuah! It's you! The test site beta queen!<br>
How'd you get here?!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Queen Elizabeth：</span><br>
Never mind that. Where is she? My gate's safety mechanism activated and I must ask her about it.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Miss D：</span><br>
Oh, she's in the driver's cabin! I'll go get her!<br>
<span style="color:#ffc960;">Queen Elizabeth META：</span><br>
...The safety mechanism was triggered? Yes, that is quite bad.<br>
Did you enter the gate and see what's happening on the other side?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Queen Elizabeth：</span><br>
If I could've done that, I wouldn't have come to you for help!<br>
<span style="color:#ffc960;">Queen Elizabeth META：</span><br>
Well, this is bad timing... We decided on this hunting trip on short notice, and it's going to take quite some time.<br>
Even worse, we couldn't finish the safe mode communication device before we left.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Queen Elizabeth：</span><br>
So what are you saying? That even YOU cannot contact Vanguard's team while the gate is in safe mode?<br>
<span style="color:#ffc960;">Queen Elizabeth META：</span><br>
Quite the opposite! Not only could we contact them, we could warp straight to them!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Queen Elizabeth：</span><br>
Get back here and do that, then!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Miss D：</span><br>
Nuh-uh! She's helping me catch my whale!<br>
I am NOT letting her turn this train around now that we've finally caught up with it!<br>
You just need to talk to people there, right? I know a way to do that!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Queen Elizabeth：</span><br>
Well, why didn't you say so sooner? Spit it out!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Miss D：</span><br>
Just use the dingdong ring-ring I gave you!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Queen Elizabeth：</span><br>
The... The what?<br>
<span style="color:#ffc960;">Queen Elizabeth META：</span><br>
She means the stuffed whale you received.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Queen Elizabeth：</span><br>
Excuse me? THAT can reach them?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Miss D：</span><br>
Sure can! I placed it in your room before I left through the gate!<br>
All you've gotta do is pick it up and dial beep boop ding ding!<br>
The people on the other side should pick up when they hear you!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Queen Elizabeth：</span><br>
What do you MEAN by "dial beep whatever-you-said"?<br>
<span style="color:#ffc960;">Queen Elizabeth META：</span><br>
That's the stuffed animal she left on the other side of the gate.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Queen Elizabeth：</span><br>
Excuse me? THAT can reach them?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Miss D：</span><br>
Is that all? Then hang up so we can focus! We're trying to catch a whale here!<br>
<br>
Elizabeth's mind returned to her body. She opened her eyes and found herself back underground.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Queen Elizabeth：</span><br>
Good thing I held on to that stuffed whale.<br>
Let's see... I just push this, right?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Weird Device：</span><br>
BEEP BEEP BEEP!<br>
BOOP BOOP BOOP!<br>
DING DING DING!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Queen Elizabeth：</span><br>
......<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Weird Device：</span><br>
What's going on? Why is Miss D's plushie making those noises?<br>
Hang on... Was that a ringtone?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Queen Elizabeth：</span><br>
Vanguard! Do you hear me?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Weird Device：</span><br>
Huh?! Is that you, Your Majesty?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Queen Elizabeth：</span><br>
Yes, it's me! I'm in the corridor just outside the entry to the gate!<br>
Go to the controls and follow my instructions precisely!<br>
I must know what's happened to the gate at once!<br>

<br>
3 Higher-Level Aberration<br>
NA Ocean - Central Sector<br>
Once, these waters were rife with danger. However, Siren activity in the area fell off following the defeat of Compiler, and some calm returned to the sea.<br>
Even the tempestuous Singularity at its heart was evaluated as less dangerous following that monumental battle.<br>
However, after the events in the Pacific and the appearance of the Naraka singularity, shipgirls were once more gathering en masse in the area.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">New Jersey：</span><br>
Seems the storm's threat readings have increased, even though the storm itself looks no different.<br>
Have each fleet report their measurements every five minutes. Also, nobody is allowed to enter the storm without permission!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ticonderoga：</span><br>
I've already notified them all, so don't worry about that.<br>
Man, it's bad enough with the phenomena happening across the globe...<br>
Now the NA Ocean storm is becoming unstable. At the worst possible time.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Boise：</span><br>
New Jersey! Two shipgirls were just detected exiting the storm! They're moving toward our position!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">New Jersey：</span><br>
What? But I don't see anything on the radar.<br>
Oh, wait! It's THEM!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Boise：</span><br>
You mean... Ashes?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">New Jersey：</span><br>
Let 'em through. If they got here through the storm, they probably know what's happening.<br>
In fact, let's ready some supplies for them.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Boise：</span><br>
Okay. On it.<br>
<br>
Following the conclusion of Operation Siren, Hiryuu and Ark Royal META had been keeping a close eye on the NA Ocean Singularity.<br>
They had aided this world not just in Operation Siren, but also during the near-superimposition event, and people's views of them had improved accordingly.<br>
So much so that the Commander ordered the fleet garrisoned in the area to provide the two Ashes with supplies, should they need them.<br>
All in all, the Eagle Union's attitude toward them had done a complete 180.<br>
The two Ashes readily accepted the Commander's goodwill and took the supplies offered to them with no qualms.<br>
Both sides shared not only resources, but meals as well, and even exchanged information.<br>
They started out hostile to one another – now, it was like they were neighbors in the NA Ocean, on mutually good terms.<br>
<span style="color:#ffc960;">Hiryuu META：</span><br>
Seeing as so many of you are here, I'm going to assume you already know what's happening inside the Singularity.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ticonderoga：</span><br>
Let's say we don't. Could you tell us what's going on?<br>
<span style="color:#ffc960;">Hiryuu META：</span><br>
Sure thing. In fact, telling you was one of our reasons for coming here.<br>
Unfortunately, I have two pieces of bad news.<br>
First – the abnormality did not happen spontaneously.<br>
Some sort of higher-level aberration is trying to enter the Singularity and invade test site beta.<br>
Second – the Arbiters Hermit, Strength, and Temperance have reappeared inside the storm.<br>
I suspect they're going after your test site soon.<br>
While these are both bad, I do have one bit of good news.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">New Jersey：</span><br>
Let me guess – the Arbiters and this "aberration" have begun fighting each other, right?<br>
<span style="color:#ffc960;">Hiryuu META：</span><br>
Correct. The Arbiters identified it as a danger to entire branches, so eliminating it became their number one priority.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ticonderoga：</span><br>
So... the storm is acting up all of a sudden because those two are fighting?<br>
<span style="color:#ffc960;">Hiryuu META：</span><br>
Yeah.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">New Jersey：</span><br>
The enemy of my enemy and all that, but aren't we in serious trouble regardless of which side wins?<br>
<span style="color:#ffc960;">Hiryuu META：</span><br>
You are. That's why I'd suggest closing the Singularity as soon as possible.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">New Jersey：</span><br>
If we knew HOW to close it, we would've done so ages ago...<br>
Hey, didn't your Enterprise make this Singularity in the first place? Can't you ask her for help?<br>
<span style="color:#ffc960;">Hiryuu META：</span><br>
I would, but I cannot get in touch with her.<br>
I fear she might even have forgotten about me since it's been so long since I left for this branch.<br>
<span style="color:#ffc960;">Ark Royal META：</span><br>
Hiryuu, come on.<br>
<span style="color:#ffc960;">Hiryuu META：</span><br>
I know what you're going to say. Listen to me – it's OUR time to ask for help from THEM this time.<br>
<span style="color:#ffc960;">Ark Royal META：</span><br>
......<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ticonderoga：</span><br>
No offense, but I'm surprised you Ashes have managed to survive this long when you're so loosely organized.<br>
<span style="color:#ffc960;">Hiryuu META：</span><br>
Our members are powerful, that's why. Enterprise especially so. Her power is greater than any one of us.<br>
We've also developed a keen sixth sense for danger, and we've learned that working as a unit actually makes it harder for us to adapt to a situation.<br>
Say what you will about our individual members, but Ashes itself is not a cold and uncaring organization.<br>
Others will come to our rescue if we end up smack-dab in the middle of this ordeal.<br>
(Well, probably...)<br>
(The only one we can count on is Helena.)<br>
Anyway, panicking won't help anyone. For now, we can only wait and see how the battle unfolds and improvise accordingly.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ticonderoga：</span><br>
True. Better that than rushing out a plan.<br>
To wind back a bit, you said earlier that, "telling us was one of your reasons for coming here." Are there more reasons?<br>
<span style="color:#ffc960;">Hiryuu META：</span><br>
How observant of you. The other reason is – we saw the writing on the wall and got out while we could.<br>

<br>
Whence the Dust Settles<br>
<br>
4 Hope<br>
Over in the Orthodoxy's capital, Shinano retired to her room for the night, having accomplished her mission.<br>
In her hand was the Watatsumi fragment that awoke her from her illusion. She stared at it, and a strange feeling suddenly welled in her.<br>
A feeling so familiar, so old.<br>
It was the feeling of slipping into a dream again.<br>
A blood moon shone on a world wrapped in dark mist. Countless red spider lilies bloomed all around.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Shinano ：</span><br>
The Sanzu River... Spider lilies...<br>
Some sort of ritual is taking place...<br>
<br>
She looked up at the sky and knew intuitively that power was flowing into that massive, dead tree at the center of the world.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Shinano ：</span><br>
A withered sakura tree... Is it a Sacred Sakura?<br>
Nay... Connected to the Watatsumi though it may be, its essence is different...<br>
Could this be an entity... CREATED by the Watatsumi?<br>
<br>
Sensing a strange energy coursing through the skies and lands, she tried to extract information from the dream.<br>
Then, a streak of purple crossed her mind in this deep red world.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Shinano ：</span><br>
...Musashi?<br>
<br>
There, in the sea of spider lilies, a figure stood out – Shinano could sense that it was Musashi.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Musashi：</span><br>
Good... I drew the attention of all the enemies. None should stand in Zuikaku's way now.<br>
My only goal was to destroy the protective barrier around the ritual, and I never knew she was following me...This adds another variable to consider.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Shinano ：</span><br>
Musashi... Your body, it's... What did you do?<br>
<br>
Musashi did not answer. In fact, she seemed wholly unaware of Shinano's existence as she began to use the power of her secret weapon again.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Shinano ：</span><br>
Musashi!<br>
<br>
Shinano tried to grab her shoulder, but her hand slipped right through Musashi's body, like she were a ghost.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Musashi：</span><br>
*cough cough*... Even just maintaining this state is draining all my energy... I need to move, fast...<br>
<br>
Musashi looked behind her at the great tree at the world's center and began moving once more.<br>
Pouring her very life essence into her "trump card," Musashi walked forward through the ritual's barrier.<br>
Though the black mist attacked her again and again, she struck it down each time, sending it flying in all directions.<br>
This back and forth of attacking and defending continued for an eternity, until finally, Musashi's soul was on the brink of extinguishing.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Musashi：</span><br>
Not so much as a sound.<br>
So easily neutralizing a wave of demons that blanketed the sea...<br>
Jintsuu wasn't exaggerating. And this trump card isn't even fully completed yet...<br>
But such a weapon is beyond any individual's control.<br>
It's fortunate that I was at the core this time.<br>
Shinano wouldn't... have...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Shinano ：</span><br>
Musashi...<br>
If only I had faced my own strength sooner and shook off my doubt, I could've helped you...<br>
Nay. It isn't too late!<br>
If the Yamato class' strength truly is tied to the Watatsumi, then surely this one can help you...<br>
There must be a way... Somehow...<br>
Think, think... I need something now!<br>
<br>
That moment, Shinano saw a smile form on Musashi's face.<br>
She knew Musashi wasn't smiling at her, and yet, it shook her core all the same.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Musashi：</span><br>
That this end would come was only natural. I have regrets, but I will not fear...<br>
All that lives must die. In this world, ships and humans alike are but fleeting phantasms.<br>
Heehee...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Shinano ：</span><br>
No...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Musashi：</span><br>
May this final blow bring the light of hope into this desolation...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Shinano ：</span><br>
Wait, Musashi... There must be another way...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Musashi：</span><br>
"Sever the pall of eternity, that I may become a leaf floating to the other side."<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Shinano ：</span><br>
NOOOOO!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Musashi：</span><br>
"Steel... clash!"<br>
<br>
Abruptly, a swarm of golden butterflies glowing like the morning sun surrounded Shinano. They lit up the sea and the dark sky.<br>
The light receded, and she found herself in a place she had seen so many times before.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Shinano ：</span><br>
The boundary line between the waking and the sleeping world... The fragmentary space that connects dreams...<br>
Finally... I'm finally back here...<br>
<br>
The two waves endlessly lapping at each other. The boundless realm. The no man's land she sees only in her dreams.<br>
Looking up, she saw something she had never seen here before – golden butterflies, grouping together and flying into the distance.<br>
In that distance – red torii gates. The gates that connect fragmented dreams.<br>
The butterflies connected the gates through many glittering lines, seemingly guiding Shinano to the next dream.<br>

5 Thawing the Winter's Crown<br>
The Arctic - Winter's Crown Singularity<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Sovetskaya Rossiya：</span><br>
I brought a fleet here as soon as I received your message, Kursk. Are there any updates on the Winter's Crown?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Kursk：</span><br>
It's not looking great. The Crown's readings are still rising.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Sovetskaya Rossiya：</span><br>
How can that be? As far as I know, Code G attempted to activate the Singularity once, but she did not succeed.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Kursk：</span><br>
I don't know either. All I know is it seems bad.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Sovetskaya Rossiya：</span><br>
I'll contact Chkalov. Perhaps she knows something we don't.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Kursk：</span><br>
Meanwhile, I'll get ready to recapture it.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Sovetskaya Rossiya：</span><br>
Alright. Our plan to reinforce the Pacific will have to wait.<br>
Chkalov, do you copy? This is Sovetskaya Rossiya.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Communicator：</span><br>
BZZZT... BZZZT...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Sovetskaya Rossiya：</span><br>
Jamming? Where is–<br>
<br>
She could not finish her sentence, because the next thing she saw left her in awe.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Sovetskaya Rossiya：</span><br>
The Crown, it's glowing!<br>
What is going on?!<br>
<br>
The shipgirls' gazes all converged on the glowing Winter's Crown. Its light only grew brighter.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Kursk：</span><br>
Half the electronics I brought have started malfunctioning.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Sovetskaya Rossiya：</span><br>
All units, get away from the Crown! We're evacuating the area now!<br>
I don't know how, but the Crown has probably been activated!<br>
<span style="color:#ff9b93;">Omitter：</span><br>
Yeah, that's right! Run away with your tails between your legs!<br>
Better run away as far as you can!<br>
<br>
A completely unexpected voice burst onto the comms channel.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Sovetskaya Rossiya：</span><br>
Omitter! That's her!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Kursk：</span><br>
You haven't shown yourself since we beat you in Operation Frostfall. Finally mustered the courage to show yourself again, huh?<br>
<span style="color:#ff9b93;">Omitter：</span><br>
What's that? You think I've been SCARED of you sorry assholes?<br>
That what you think, huh? That what you're saying?!<br>
Forget it! Just stand back while I show you my REAL strength!<br>
<br>
With those words, a wave of sheer cold swept across the ocean.<br>
A ripple shot out from the Winter's Crown, freezing all the water in its path and changing even the clouds in the sky.<br>
Without any warning, heavy snow, rain, and hail all began to fall while thunder boomed and gales blew. Even short-lived tornadoes raged across the frozen surface.<br>
These forces of nature did not target the shipgirls, however – they targeted the Winter's Crown.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Sovetskaya Rossiya：</span><br>
Is she... attacking the Crown?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Kursk：</span><br>
Looks like it. That initial freeze was probably the most effective attack, though.<br>
All the other weather changes – I doubt they'll do much to it.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Sovetskaya Rossiya：</span><br>
Then why do that? Is she just showing off?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Kursk：</span><br>
......<br>
<br>
As the last tornado vanished, the orchestra of abnormal weather finally ceased.<br>
The Winter's Crown answered the provocation by lighting up and releasing a shockwave that instantly shattered the ice around it, as if to mock Omitter.<br>
Then, the next moment...<br>
The world turned white.<br>
Right before all went blank, the Northern Parliament girls saw a beam of light appear from the sky and shoot through the Winter's Crown.<br>
When they could see again, everything was gone – Omitter, the light beam, even the Winter's Crown.<br>
All that remained was a pool of nearly boiling water.<br>

<br>
6 Upheaval<br>
Pacific Ocean - Waters Near Sakura Empire<br>
The Prime Barrier had turned dark red, and rather than protecting the Sakura Empire, it now isolated it. It gave off an ominous pressure.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Nagato：</span><br>
How could this happen to the barrier...<br>
Shimanto, you and I will commence a purification ritual.<br>
We must get inside somehow, even if through a narrow gap!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Shimanto：</span><br>
Understood.<br>
<br>
While the two Sakurans began the ritual, the others backed off and stood by on alert.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Sovetsky Soyuz：</span><br>
Perhaps in its current state, the Prime Barrier can be viewed as a kind of locked Mirror Sea.<br>
It's quite unusual for a Mirror Sea, though. The protective barrier is so strong that it can be seen with the naked eye. Not only that, it is physically tangible.<br>
<span style="color:#ffc960;">Kirov META：</span><br>
That's because its boundary line is a Singularity, not a regular old Mirror Sea.<br>
Judging by how it was formed, "Naraka" – as you call it – has some pretty darn unique properties.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Sovetsky Soyuz：</span><br>
What makes you say that? Do you know anything about it?<br>
<span style="color:#ffc960;">Kirov META：</span><br>
Yeah. I've seen a similar Singularity before.<br>
It was made to stop the Sirens from resetting their test site.<br>
Truth be told, it did the job – in a twisted way.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Sovetsky Soyuz：</span><br>
What do you mean, "twisted way"?<br>
<span style="color:#ffc960;">Kirov META：</span><br>
After it was deployed, the universe began to literally break down around them.<br>
In the end, the Singularity swallowed absolutely everything in that test site, save for its creators.<br>
And by everything, I mean the Sirens as well.<br>
Without Sirens, there was no way for their test site to be reset. So, in that way, it worked.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Sovetsky Soyuz：</span><br>
What?!<br>
Do you believe... that Naraka will do the same?<br>
<span style="color:#ffc960;">Kirov META：</span><br>
No. The Singularity itself isn't what's dangerous.<br>
TB labeled it as a "cataclysmic threat," but as far as I can tell, it's not large or strong enough to cause THAT level of destruction.<br>
Having that said, that thing showing up means that the higher-level aberration connected to your test site is different. I wonder if it's...<br>
Wait! The Winter's Crown! That Singularity still exists!<br>
Comrade Soyuz, order your troops there to monitor the situation!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Sovetsky Soyuz：</span><br>
Monitor the Winter's Crown? But...<br>
<span style="color:#ffc960;">Kirov META：</span><br>
I know. I just want them to keep an eye on it and prepare for a battle, just in case.<br>
There are other Singularities in this world, yes?<br>
It doesn't matter if they're natural, manmade, or even active or not...<br>
I want them all destroyed immediately if it's at all possible!<br>
If outright destruction isn't feasible, they must instead be contained and have guards posted at them!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Sovetsky Soyuz：</span><br>
What are you saying? Do you believe that all Singularities could be dangerous?<br>
<span style="color:#ffc960;">Kirov META：</span><br>
Yes! They are!<br>
They caught my branch by surprise once, and it cost us dearly...<br>
I don't want the same thing to happen to yours!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Sovetsky Soyuz：</span><br>
I understand. I'll contact Comrade Commander and mobilize the other factions.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Communicator：</span><br>
BEEP BEEP!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Indiana：</span><br>
Looks like the Commander contacted YOU first.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Sovetsky Soyuz：</span><br>
Hello, Comrade Commander. I have something important to discuss.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
I'm aware. It's about Naraka and its effects, no?<br>
I already know the details and I have a plan to deal with it. You don't need to worry about that.<br>
If Nagato's there, I'd like to talk to her.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ryuuhou：</span><br>
She is committing her full attention to completing a purification ritual. If you couldn't reach her earlier, that might be why.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Well, please put her on the line. It's important.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ryuuhou：</span><br>
O-of course! Right away!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Nagato：</span><br>
What is it, Commander?<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Hate to interrupt you, but I have to ask – how do you feel about Akagi's attempt to revive Amagi?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Nagato：</span><br>
I will hold her accountable for it. This whole calamity traces back to her.<br>
Having said that, I know her desire to revive Amagi is genuine. For that, I do not blame her.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
What if I told you that everything will be fine if Amagi is successfully brought back?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Nagato：</span><br>
What? But that's impossi–<br>
<br>
KABOOOM!<br>
A rumble shook the sea, and an enormous crack appeared on the outside of the Prime Barrier.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Shimanto：</span><br>
Lady Nagato! Someone is trying to physically destroy the barrier from the inside!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Nagato：</span><br>
With brute force?!<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Nagato, I know the situation is dire, but there's still time to turn everything around.<br>
Will you let me handle this?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Nagato：</span><br>
...Very well. While I have my reservations, I will place my trust in you.<br>
You have seen many battles. You are a strong leader. You rescued Zuikaku, among many others...<br>
Admittedly, you also have a wider perspective on things than I do at times.<br>
So, what would you have me do?<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
It's simple. Allow Amagi to be revived and resolve this crisis.<br>
To do that, you'll need your fleet – and above all else, Akagi's cooperation.<br>
Use whatever means necessary to find her! When you do, talk to her and keep her calm!<br>

<br>
7 Plans and Goals<br>
Somewhere, in an unknown location...<br>
An exquisite garden sat in the middle of an otherwise barren place.<br>
<span style="color:#c3abff;">Memphis META：</span><br>
*sigh*...<br>
<span style="color:#c3abff;">Arizona META：</span><br>
That's your 26th sigh, Memphis.<br>
<span style="color:#c3abff;">Memphis META：</span><br>
*siiigh*...<br>
<span style="color:#c3abff;">Arizona META：</span><br>
27th.<br>
<span style="color:#c3abff;">Memphis META：</span><br>
I haven't heard a word from Helena since she left us with this mission.<br>
Why? I don't get it.<br>
The Commander is in so much danger, so why won't she come to the rescue?<br>
<span style="color:#c3abff;">Vestal META：</span><br>
She must have her reasons for it, I'm sure. Besides, didn't Yorktown sign off on the idea?<br>
<span style="color:#c3abff;">Memphis META：</span><br>
Hey, aren't you bothered by the fact that Helena chose Kasumi for this mission, even though you and she are both suited for it?<br>
I'm starting to think she wants to keep the Commander all to herself.<br>
<span style="color:#c3abff;">Vestal META：</span><br>
......<br>
<span style="color:#c3abff;">Kasumi META：</span><br>
*sigh*...<br>
<span style="color:#c3abff;">Memphis META：</span><br>
Oh, hey, Kasumi. Setting off so soon?<br>
Look after yourself – and the Commander as well.<br>
<span style="color:#c3abff;">Kasumi META：</span><br>
Mhm. I will.<br>
<br>
Kasumi vanished from the garden in a burst of blue light.<br>
<span style="color:#c3abff;">Memphis META：</span><br>
No... I can't stop worrying about it...<br>
Jintsuu's still online. I'm going to go and give her some advice!<br>
<span style="color:#c3abff;">Arizona META & Vestal META：</span><br>
......<br>
<span style="color:#c3abff;">Yorktown META：</span><br>
The ostensible danger may not be the real danger.<br>
No matter what happens, I will protect you with all my might...<br>
Be on your guard... Commander.<br>
<br>
Test Site Beta - Arbiters' Defensive Line, Central Layer<br>
The Lovers and Empress constructed this defensive line to ward off the X in the event of an attack.<br>
Then came Bon Homme Richard. Ever since her assault began, Lovers' defense force expanded to several times its original size.<br>
This fierce pushback prevented Bon Homme Richard from gaining any ground for a week.<br>
Then, a new day came...<br>
<span style="color:#bdbdbd;">Bon Homme Richard：</span><br>
What's this? Your forces aren't pushing back like they used to.<br>
Are you taking your fleet and retreating?<br>
You asked for a battle of attrition, and now you're just giving up?<br>
Ahahahahahaha!<br>
I'd be ashamed if I ran off after bragging like you did.<br>
Ooh, lookie here. Fun stuff is happening over in test site beta.<br>
Not gonna stop me, Lovers? Because I WILL pay them a visit.<br>
<br>
She expected to hear Lovers' familiar voice, but there was no response.<br>
<span style="color:#bdbdbd;">Bon Homme Richard：</span><br>
She really did pack up... Alrighty then, I'm off to test site beta!<br>
<br>
The dead silence continued.<br>
<span style="color:#bdbdbd;">Bon Homme Richard：</span><br>
Okay, here we go!<br>
Test site beta, here I come!<br>
