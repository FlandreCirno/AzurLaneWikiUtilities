Air Raid Drills With Essex<br>
<br>
1: Special Exercises, Commence!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Enterprise：</span><br>
Our special exercise this time has two objectives: First, to respond to an aerial attack from enemy carriers, and second, to immediately launch a counterattack against an enemy carrier.<br>
At the same time, we will take this opportunity to display the strength of the Eagle Union's Air Force.<br>
Participants will be roughly distributed into one of two groups. The blue group is the "enemy" that will be launching aerial attacks. The red group is a mixed squad that will aim to neutralize the enemy's air power.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Saratoga：</span><br>
Um, in other words, some of us have to play the bad guys?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Enterprise：</span><br>
Precisely.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Hornet：</span><br>
So, have you roughly decided who's going to be in which group?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Enterprise：</span><br>
The commander was supposed to be in charge of putting together the red group, but...<br>
I was told to designate the leader of the red group instead. Independence, are you up for the task?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Independence：</span><br>
Me? Are you sure you want someone who was just assigned to this fleet...?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Enterprise：</span><br>
That's all the more reason. Don't you think it's a good idea to get to know everyone in the fleet?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Independence：</span><br>
I see... Understood. I'll give it my all.<br>
(This drill is my chance to show everyone what I'm made of...!)<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Enterprise：</span><br>
Now, as for the blue group... Based upon the difficulty of prolonged combat as well as strength of the enemy, I'll be the most suitable--<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Essex：</span><br>
Enterprise, please let me handle this.<br>
I think my ability and combat experience make me well-suited for this role. Plus, I want to see how far I've come as a result of my training.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Enterprise：</span><br>
Essex? But...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Yorktown：</span><br>
Enterprise, I think you should place some faith in your juniors. After all, you shouldn't try to shoulder everything on your own...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Hornet：</span><br>
That's right, Enty! You've gotta give other people their time under the spotlight too!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Enterprise：</span><br>
...I see. Essex, you'll be in charge of leading the blue group then. I'll explain the key points to be aware of later--<br>
...Show me everything you've got!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Essex：</span><br>
Yes ma'am!!<br>
<br>
Exercise Area<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Shangri-La：</span><br>
That makes sense... You were able to get the enemy's position from Enterprise.<br>
Although my original responsibilities were to oversee and record this exercise, Enterprise told me that I could lend you my aid if you needed it. Essex, are you sure you don't want my help?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Essex：</span><br>
Sorry, but I'm doing this alone. I need to find out how far I can push myself.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Shangri-La：</span><br>
I see... In that case, you should get going.<br>
<span style="color:#ec5d53;">Essex：</span><br>
Thanks for letting me know. In any case... all aircraft, prepare to launch!<br>

<br>
2: Independence's Battle<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Independence：</span><br>
Gah... Coordinating a fleet is harder than I expected...<br>
All the planes are operating properly, and I should also be in good shape, but... What's going on...?!<br>
Is there some limit to the commanding and operational abilities of light carriers...?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Shangri-La：</span><br>
If I may say something, Independence...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Independence：</span><br>
You're the historian... Shangri-La?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Shangri-La：</span><br>
Yes. I beg your pardon, but as the observer, I'd like to break the problems that you're currently facing...<br>
While there are no problems with your aircraft, the main line has advanced too far forward and you've gotten separated from the sentry ships.<br>
Aren't you... acting a bit rash? I'm afraid you'll rush headfirst into trouble if you press forward with the way things are right now...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Independence：</span><br>
I'm... being rash? I see. Thank you for your advice.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Shangri-La：</span><br>
You're welcome. Anyway, I still have work to do.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Independence：</span><br>
Working together as a team, huh...<br>
(I'm going to have to prioritize that if I want a shot at taking on Essex. But how do I do that...?)<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Cleveland：</span><br>
Hmm? Whatcha doing, Independence? You look like something's really bothering you.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Independence：</span><br>
(Cleveland...? I wonder if I should ask her for some tips... As the lead ship of her class, I'm sure she knows something...)<br>
To be honest...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Cleveland：</span><br>
Gotcha. So you want to improve the fleet's teamwork...<br>
About that...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Columbia：</span><br>
You don't know much about that either, right? After all, you're the one always charging ahead of the rest of us. Hehe~<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Montpelier：</span><br>
Works out though. Cleve's the strongest, so she has no problem destroying all the enemies by herself.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Cleveland：</span><br>
Huh? When'd you all get here?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Denver：</span><br>
We were here the whole time?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Independence：</span><br>
(The girls who were supposed to be my sister ships... Cleveland, Columbia, Montpelier, and Denver... they're all here?)<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Denver：</span><br>
...Looks like we can't come up with any good ideas even with all three of us here... Ahaha!<br>
I feel like as well as we communicate and get to know each other better, that'll naturally carry over to our ability to cooperate during battle as well.<br>
Independence, you were just assigned here, right? Lemme show you around port, c'mon!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Independence：</span><br>
Huh, right now? But the drill's right after--<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Columbia：</span><br>
Don't sweat the small stuff! It's okay, the commander will totally understand!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Independence：</span><br>
F-fine...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Cleveland：</span><br>
All right, shall we head out then?<br>
...Wait, what the heck! She was asking me for advice, and I couldn't come up with anything useful at all!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Montpelier：</span><br>
Don't worry about it, Cleve. You'll get another chance!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Independence：</span><br>
......<br>
(They sure get along well...)<br>

<br>
3: The Listener's Interlude<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Hornet：</span><br>
Heyyy, welcome back!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Yorktown：</span><br>
You two must be tired. How about something to drink?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Essex：</span><br>
Ah, thank you very much!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Shangri-La：</span><br>
Much obliged.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Hornet：</span><br>
By the way, Essex, what do you think about playing the role of the enemy?<br>
Like uh, do you ever feel like venting some old grievances against anyone, or saying badass things that only villains get to say, or--<br>
Y'know, stuff like that?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Essex：</span><br>
S-sorry, I hadn't even thought about all that...<br>
Considering the importance of this exercise, I have to take advantage of this opportunity to push my limits and display my abilities... That's pretty much what I think about this.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Hornet：</span><br>
Mmhmm, that sounds just like what my overly-serious sister would say...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Shangri-La：</span><br>
Heheh, unlike you, Hornet, Essex is actually the diligent type~<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Hornet：</span><br>
Can't help it.<br>
Oh, that's right! So, I know some stuff about Enty's habits in battle~ Want some tips, Essex?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Essex：</span><br>
Hm...?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Yorktown：</span><br>
Hornet, those two are tired from the exercises, so you should let them get some rest earlier. Don't keep bothering them, okay...?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Hornet：</span><br>
Look, that much I do know!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Shangri-La：</span><br>
...Heheh~<br>
Umm, hold on... Hornet!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Hornet：</span><br>
What's the matter, Shangri-La?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Shangri-La：</span><br>
What you mentioned earlier about Enterprise's habits earlier... Could you tell us a bit more?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Hornet：</span><br>
Hmm... Sure. Are you interested?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Shangri-La：</span><br>
I want to help Essex. But given her personality, she wouldn't ask for this kind of stuff herself...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Hornet：</span><br>
Ahaha! It's not some game-changing secret though.<br>
You'd notice these things right away from fighting together, so first--<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Enterprise：</span><br>
Hornet?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Hornet：</span><br>
Ack! Ahahaha... Sorry to hold you up! Anyway, gotta bounce!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Shangri-La：</span><br>
Ahem! Thanks for your time, Hornet!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Enterprise：</span><br>
*sigh*... Have you seen Essex around?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Shangri-La：</span><br>
She already headed back to the dorms.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Enterprise：</span><br>
I see. Considering she was out there fighting all day, that's to be expected.<br>
Could you relay a message to her if you see her? Tell her, "Great job today, and I hope you continue to keep up the good work."<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Shangri-La：</span><br>
I'll be sure to let her know.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Enterprise：</span><br>
Shangri-La, you also had a pretty impressive day out there.<br>
And that's not just lip service. I don't think I'd be able to take on the role of the enemy so admirably.<br>
I've always seen her as my hardworking underclassman, but that doesn't seem to do justice to her true strength anymore...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Shangri-La：</span><br>

Air Raid Drills With Essex<br>
<br>
4: Goals and Hard Work<br>
During the climax of the exercise...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Independence：</span><br>
Essex, do you have a moment?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Essex：</span><br>
Sure, what is it?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Independence：</span><br>
Um, Essex... What do you think it means to "become stronger?"<br>
I've always struggled with how to overcome my own weaknesses. You've been universally praised by everyone here for your role as the enemy, so I'd like to hear from you.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Essex：</span><br>
I-is that so...<br>
(...Normally, I'm always being compared to Enterprise, so... it's also nice to stand alone like this.)<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Shangri-La：</span><br>
Mm, and I'll title this photograph: "The cute little Essex who cannot wipe that goofy grin off her face after getting complimented."<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Essex：</span><br>
Shangri-La? When'd you get here?!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Shangri-La：</span><br>
Ahaha... I think it's my duty to record moments like these for posterity. Besides, aren't you going to answer Independence's question, "teacher?"<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Essex：</span><br>
Ahem! ...Anyway, I think it's important to set a goal first.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Independence：</span><br>
A goal?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Essex：</span><br>
That's right. If you have a clear goal in mind, it'll help you be more efficient in your efforts.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Independence：</span><br>
I see, but what kind of goal should I have...?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Shangri-La：</span><br>
For example... Essex's greatest aspiration of surpassing Enterprise, the person she respects most... something like that?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Essex：</span><br>
Ehh?! I-I guess... It's true that I look up to Enterprise, and at the same time want to catch up to her, but...<br>
But, there are many others here at this port who are not to be underestimated either. For example, the Sakura Empire's Zuikaku, who is worthy of being Enterprise's rival, and the Royal Navy's Ark Royal, who I've heard is also quite formidable.<br>
When I stopped only walking in Enterprise's shadows, I realized that there is so much progress to be made by learning from other people, not just from Enterprise.<br>
Well, in the end, what I want most is for Enterprise to recognize me as her equal, but...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Shangri-La：</span><br>
That's just like you, Essex. Hehe~ But if you ask me, I think Independence has known the answer to "how to become stronger" all along.<br>
The idea of recognizing one's weaknesses and compensating for them, asking for guidance from others, and valuing their own growth...<br>
As long as you don't get impatient, Independence, I'm sure you'll see great results.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Independence：</span><br>
I understand. Thank you for your advice.<br>
Essex, Shangri-La, I'm looking forward to tomorrow's exercise.<br>
(Finally the answer I wanted... I'm glad I got to talk to them.)<br>
(It's just as Denver said. I guess I needed to talk to some more people.<br>

<br>
5: Best Memories<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Enterprise：</span><br>
Essex, Shangri-La, Independence, and all the participants of the special exercise--<br>
This exercise not only allowed us to demonstrate the Eagle Union's air capabilities, but also let us gather valuable combat data.<br>
It would not be an exaggeration to say that this result was a resounding success. For the sake of the azure lanes of freedom--<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Crowd：</span><br>
Cheers!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Enterprise：</span><br>
Essex, when you decided to take on the role of the enemy, I didn't think you'd launch such a comprehensive attack... But thanks to that, we were able to fully achieve the purpose of this exercise.<br>
You completely caught me off guard.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Essex：</span><br>
I, I simply did what was expected of me! If you were in my position, you would've certainly done a better job...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Enterprise：</span><br>
You don't need to be so humble. You put more effort into this exercise than anyone else.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Shangri-La：</span><br>
I took a lot of photos of this exercise for our future records. Why don't we look through them together?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Hornet：</span><br>
Heck yeah! Is this going to become one of your collections?!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Enterprise：</span><br>
There's a note written on the back of this photo... "A cool-looking Essex getting ready to sortie." ...Hmm, fine words if I must say so myself.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Essex：</span><br>
Ehh?! R-really?!<br>
(How embarrassing!!)<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Hornet：</span><br>
This one here is of Independence. Let's see, let's see... "Independence, after getting hit and requiring emergency damage control..." Uhh...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Independence：</span><br>
...How unsightly of me...<br>
"The Laid-Back Wrangler?" It just looks like Hornet slacking off...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Hornet：</span><br>
Hey, I wasn't slacking off at all!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Essex：</span><br>
"Saratoga, looking for her next prank victim," "Ms. Yorktown leading the destroyers," "Enterprise gazing beyond the horizons..."<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Independence：</span><br>
There are so many pictures... these are simply amazing!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Shangri-La：</span><br>
It's no big deal. It's just part of my job as the historian after all.<br>
But there's one photo that I haven't taken yet. Yes, how about one last group photo of all the participants?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Enterprise：</span><br>
Good idea. Everyone, come over here.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Independence：</span><br>
Woah! Why am I being put in front?!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Shangri-La：</span><br>
You're the leader of the red group, of course you have to stand in the front. Essex, if you would as well.<br>
Everyone, on the count of 3... 3, 2, 1--<br>
<br>
Cheese!<br>
And thus concluded the Eagle Union's special air drills.<br>
