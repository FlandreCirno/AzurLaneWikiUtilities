<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Akashi：</span><br>
Commander, it's time to bring back a classic, nya! We're doing another Muse System test, nya!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Mikasa：</span><br>
The last two were great successes. Everyone is raring to have a go at it a third time.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Clemenceau：</span><br>
Even Le Malin has gotten fired up about it. That alone makes me interested.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Akashi：</span><br>
Nyahaha! Of course she is – everyone loves to perform on the stage, nya!<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Another round of testing, huh? Not surprised to hear the news from Akashi's mouth...<br>
<br>
I look at Mikasa, then Clemenceau, then Marco Polo, who's standing by the door outside my office.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
But why are the rest of you here?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Marco Polo：</span><br>
Why am I here? Because this is a big event. Sardegna does not sit out on such things.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Akashi：</span><br>
You need a stage for the performers, nya. And to run a stage, you need stagehands, nya.<br>
That is why they're here – and totally not because I rounded them up as soon as I saw an opportunity to make a big buck, nya.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
......<br>
<br>
Ignoring the money-grubbing cat, I turn my attention to the list of new Muse talent.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
"Alizarin" and "Cyanidin" are the new units this time, eh.<br>
Aha. That gives me an idea.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Mikasa：</span><br>
An idea? What do you mean?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Clemenceau：</span><br>
They're both pigments. Red and blue, respectively... Are you thinking what I'm thinking?<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
I sure am.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Akashi：</span><br>
Nya?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Marco Polo：</span><br>
Great, you share a telepathic connection. Now can you explain your idea to us mere mortals?<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Simply put, I want to see these sides compete with each other.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Marco Polo：</span><br>
Isn't that what they've been doing this whole time?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Clemenceau：</span><br>
Sort of. The Muse competitions have been rather limited in scope thus far.<br>
The Commander is talking about something bigger – pitting two sides, red and blue, against each other and involving as many girls as possible.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
What she said. Girls without Muse Systems were part of it last time, and everyone loved it.<br>
Since we're doing this again, I say let's change the rules a bit and give as many people as possible the chance to be part of the show.<br>
Ideally, everyone should have their moment in the limelight.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Mikasa：</span><br>
Ahh, I see now. By framing it like a competition, it'll bring the whole port community together.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Clemenceau：</span><br>
Indeed. It won't just be individual units competing against each other, but rather entire groups.<br>
That means who you choose to recruit will make a big difference.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Marco Polo：</span><br>
Then the recruiter must have a discerning eye! Someone like me would be perfect for–<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Sorry, but no. The girls in each unit will pick their members.<br>
Akashi, go explain the rules to the new units. I and the others will stay here and work out the details.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Akashi：</span><br>
Will do, nya.<br>
<br>
The green cat disappears down the corridor. Mikasa waits until she's gone, then approaches me.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Mikasa：</span><br>
Before we discuss that, I posit that we come up with a name for the project.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Right. Every good project needs a good name.<br>
Seeing as the Muse System is at its strongest when you sing with your whole heart... Yes, I've got it. The name is going to be...<br>

{{折叠面板|标题=New Rules|选项=2|主框=1|样式=primary|展开=是}}
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Noshiro μ：</span><br>
Based on what Akashi said, the rules for this Muse System test will be a bit different from the last.<br>
We have to organize into teams, red and blue, and choose our own members then compete with each other.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Prinz Eugen μ：</span><br>
And we're on the red team. I like it. Better red than blue.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Formidable μ：</span><br>
It's a game of who can make the most friends. What a childish competition.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Noshiro μ：</span><br>
I think they just want us all to become closer.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Prinz Eugen μ：</span><br>
*sigh*... I can't think of a nice way to say this... Screw it, I'll just say it.<br>
You two are completely missing the point of this whole thing.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Formidable μ：</span><br>
"Missing the point"? I think we both summarised it fairly well – this is about making friends.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Noshiro μ：</span><br>
I think so, too. What do you believe "the point" is, Eugen?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Prinz Eugen μ：</span><br>
Remember the previous Muse System test? They built a stage for the girls to perform on.<br>
Stages don't build themselves. There was a sponsor funding it.<br>
And when you're funding a project, you have the power to bend the rules.<br>
Last time, it was Queen Elizabeth. Who do you think it is now?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Formidable μ：</span><br>
Hang on, what does that have to do with anything?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Noshiro μ：</span><br>
I think I see what Eugen is hinting at.<br>
She's saying the sponsor will be biased toward people from their own faction. If we find out who, and choose members from said faction, we'll have an advantage.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Prinz Eugen μ：</span><br>
Bingo.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Formidable μ：</span><br>
What a cynical take! Making empty friendships just to win? Do you think that's what the Commander had in mind?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Noshiro μ：</span><br>
She's right. The Commander wouldn't want that.<br>
Let's forget that angle and focus on rehearsing. Without talent, we won't convince anyone to join us.<br>
<br>
Meanwhile...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Kongou μ：</span><br>
Apologies for summoning you on such short notice. I would like to discuss our strategy moving forward.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Le Téméraire μ：</span><br>
Strategy? Oh! You mean the rules Akashi talked about!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Kongou μ：</span><br>
Precisely. It stands to reason that there must be a motivation behind this rule change.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Boise μ：</span><br>
Huff... I-I doubt it's an important motivation.<br>
I think they just want more people to enjoy the event.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Le Téméraire μ：</span><br>
Yeah! I think so, too!<br>
Don't overthink it, Kongou! Let's concentrate on finding people to add to our team!<br>
There's bound to be loads of people who'll be happy to join if they'll get to perform up on stage!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Boise μ：</span><br>
Mhm.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Kongou μ：</span><br>
Hmm... Well, if you say so, then I won't let it nag me.<br>
(When recruiting for a competition like this, talent matters above all else.)<br>
(And in terms of talent, that red fox is a great first candidate.)<br>

<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Akagi：</span><br>
Thanks, but no thanks.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Kongou μ：</span><br>
Not interested? You seemed to enjoy yourself quite a lot during the last Muse System test, Ms. Akagi.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Akagi：</span><br>
That was a unique case. Also, would you stop calling me "Ms."?<br>
I don't like being referred to like some old school teacher just because I took part in a Muse System test some time ago.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Kongou μ：</span><br>
As you wish. Then let me ask you this – what would it take for you to help us?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Akagi：</span><br>
Hmm...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Formidable μ：</span><br>
Are you absolutely certain you don't wish to join our team?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Illustrious：</span><br>
Heehee. I do want to join you, just not right now.<br>
I understand why you'd want to recruit me. I have experience with the Muse System, after all.<br>
But to my understanding, the point of this event is to let new people experience it.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Formidable μ：</span><br>
I know that, but still...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Illustrious：</span><br>
I'm not saying "no." Come and see me again if you really can't find anyone else.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Akashi：</span><br>
Ahem. Testing, one, two, three...<br>
Sorry for butting in, nya. I've been asked to tell everyone to gather at the dock, nya.<br>
There are a few more things about the Muse System I need to explain, nya.<br>
That's the message, nya. See you there, nya.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Formidable μ：</span><br>
What a pain in the bum... I'm off to the dock.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Illustrious：</span><br>
Language! Remember your manners.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Formidable μ：</span><br>
Of course, of course.<br>
<br>
Port - Dock<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Clemenceau：</span><br>
Thank you all for coming here.<br>
I'm sure you have some questions, like "why do we have to split into groups and compete?" or "who is the sponsor?"<br>
We hope to answer those now.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Mikasa：</span><br>
Ahahah! Akashi forgot to mention something important to you when she explained the rules.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Marco Polo：</span><br>
Important indeed. To make things more exciting, the sponsor will grant everyone on the winning team one wish.<br>
Think of the things you could wish for! For a start, there's–<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Mikasa：</span><br>
Ahem! Let's let the participants decide for themselves how to use their wishes.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Prinz Eugen μ：</span><br>
Grant one wish? Heehee, now things are getting interesting.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Boise μ：</span><br>
Hmm...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Akashi：</span><br>
If hearing that got you fired up, just wait until you hear who the sponsor is, nya!<br>
It is none other thaaan... the Commander, nya!<br>
If I were you, I'd think long and hard about what I'd use my wish for, nya.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Akagi：</span><br>
Wait... the Commander is the sponsor? And I can wish for anything?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Akagi μ：</span><br>
Hehehe... Hahahaha! Kongou, I've changed my mind! I'll join you!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Le Téméraire μ：</span><br>
Whoa! Talk about a quick wardrobe change!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Taihou μ：</span><br>
I shall participate in this event as well!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Noshiro μ：</span><br>
Oh boy... This news will really change the course of this competition.<br>

<br>
Port - Office<br>
Sometime before the announcement...<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
The Royal Navy sponsored the last test, and I think we could try a rotation system with a different faction sponsoring it each time from now on.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Marco Polo：</span><br>
No objections here.<br>
In fact, I propose that Sardegna be the sponsor this time around!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Mikasa：</span><br>
Aye, 'tis a good idea... but it'll be a long, long while before everyone has had their turn.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Clemenceau：</span><br>
In that case, how about every faction chips in for now? We've already changed the rules, and the extra funds would allow us to construct a spectacular stage.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Good idea.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Clemenceau：</span><br>
Then we have a plan. I'll notify all the faction leaders.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Mikasa：</span><br>
I suppose that settles the sponsor question. What shall be done about the prize, though?<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Prize, prize... Does anyone have any ideas?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Marco Polo：</span><br>
I think letting the winners choose for themselves makes the most sense.<br>
In practice, that means something like... letting them make a wish, perhaps?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Clemenceau：</span><br>
I like that. I support this idea.<br>
A predetermined prize, no matter what it is, won't please everyone.<br>
Letting the victors decide for themselves has universal appeal and gives us more flexibility.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Mikasa：</span><br>
Agreed. The increased budget has room for even lavish wishes, too.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Hang on. Letting the winning team wish for anything is good and all, but what about the losing team?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Mikasa：</span><br>
What remains of the budget can dictate what they'll get. Simple.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Fair enough. Akashi, I'll leave the budgeting in your capable hands... or paws.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Akashi：</span><br>
You got it, nya! I'll make the most of every last penny, nya.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Oh, one more thing – what do we formally call this joint sponsorship? Do we just say "sponsored by all factions"?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Mikasa：</span><br>
Think of it this way: a joint sponsorship is the product of all factions coming together. Who unites all the factions? You, Commander. You are the sponsor.<br>
If nothing else, "the Commander" rolls off the tongue a lot better.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
What? I think you're making a leap of logic.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Clemenceau：</span><br>
You think so? Sounds perfectly fine to me. You should just accept the honor.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Akashi：</span><br>
Exactly, nya. Now put your signature here, nya.<br>
<br>
I shrug and go with the flow, signing all the relevant paperwork.<br>
Port - Dock<br>
Back to the present...<br>
A wave of enthusiasm swept through the port practically the minute Akashi announced who the sponsor was.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Roon μ：</span><br>
Ahh... The Commander will make the winners' wishes come true. What a fabulous prize...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Dido µ：</span><br>
When I win, I'm going to wish for... No, no, no! It's wrong of me to think this way! But at the same time...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Unicorn：</span><br>
I'd really like that wish... I can't afford to hold anything back.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Formidable μ：</span><br>
Ladies, please! It's lovely that you're enthusiastic and all, but aren't you getting a little ahead of yourselves?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Noshiro μ：</span><br>
If we want to win, we're going to need a lot of practice.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Prinz Eugen μ：</span><br>
What's wrong with them being so fired up? The more competitive they get, the better.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Boise μ：</span><br>
Huff... Puff... Hearing about this reward has really turbocharged them.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Le Téméraire μ：</span><br>
It's gonna be easy peasy to recruit members now!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Kongou μ：</span><br>
Let's hope so...<br>

<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ping Hai：</span><br>
Sis, I heard the news! I think it's time for us to make a comeback!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ning Hai：</span><br>
You got that right! Let's do what the Dragon Sisters do best and burn the competition!<br>
But first, we should get Huan Ch'ang to read our fortunes.<br>
She's already on her way, and I've got sweet dumplings ready for her.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ping Hai：</span><br>
Wow, you're always one step ahead of the rest.<br>
<br>
Sometime later, Huan Ch'ang dropped by as promised.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Huan Ch'ang：</span><br>
Ah. So you want to know who'll be the victor in this competition between red and blue.<br>
I shall tell you who– Hey! Whoever's eavesdropping over there, show yourself!<br>
<br>
Just as she was about to divine, she caught a glimpse of somebody peeping from in front of the kitchen.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ping Hai & Ning Hai：</span><br>
A spy?!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Chi An：</span><br>
Take it easy! It's me, Chi An! I was just going to the kitchen since I figured it would be empty at this time of day.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Huan Ch'ang：</span><br>
You thought you could practice cooking again, didn't you?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ning Hai：</span><br>
Wait, "again"? What do you mean by that?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Chi An：</span><br>
Oof!<br>
(Huan, please don't bring up the kitchen thing in front of them...)<br>
S-so, what's your business with her? Did you want her to read your fortune?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ping Hai：</span><br>
Yup! We're going to enter the performance competition and want to know if the red or blue team is going to win.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Chi An：</span><br>
Won't knowing the answer spoil the fun, though?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Huan Ch'ang：</span><br>
True. It would. Knowing what is to come will ruin the fun along the way.<br>
That being the case, I say go with your gut.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ping Hai & Ning Hai：</span><br>
Laaame...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Boise μ：</span><br>
Huff... Um, hello.<br>
I heard you girls might want to join the blue team, so...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ping Hai：</span><br>
Sis, what do we say?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ning Hai：</span><br>
Fate must be trying to tell us something. Let's join the blue team!<br>
<br>
At the same time, others were also running to and fro to recruit new members.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Le Malin：</span><br>
Ugh... Do you really think I want to waste precious energy on that?<br>
No thanks. You should ask somebody else.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Prinz Eugen μ：</span><br>
Aww, really? You don't want to have a wish granted if you win?<br>
You could wish to sleep in all you want or say goodbye to work forever, but you do you.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Le Malin：</span><br>
......<br>
Okay, I'm in!<br>

<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Formidable μ：</span><br>
Really? You would all like to join team red?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Tashkent μ：</span><br>
I was just asked to help out. I don't care much about getting a wish granted.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Dido µ：</span><br>
And I will do anything not to disappoint my Master! I want to get up on stage once more and shine like a star!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Albacore μ：</span><br>
Heh, you all sound mighty fired up!<br>
I'm just surprised Astrum is getting the chance to perform on stage again.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Baltimore μ：</span><br>
Ain't that the truth. I'll even be able to perform more like an idol since I've grown since the last time!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Illustrious μ：</span><br>
Heehee. Thank you all for agreeing to help.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Formidable μ：</span><br>
Illustrious, you didn't round up all this talent just to extend a helping hand to me, did you?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Illustrious μ：</span><br>
Well, I did, but there's more to it.<br>
In all honesty, I have a wish I'd like to come true.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Formidable μ：</span><br>
Oh really?<br>
<br>
Port - Sakura Empire Dorm<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Kongou μ：</span><br>
It seems that the red team has already secured the talented Astrum unit for themselves...<br>
While we did successfully recruit the Dragon Sisters, we still must make haste and recruit additional talent.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Akagi μ：</span><br>
Are you seriously worried that we're lagging behind?<br>
Don't be. Victory is all but guaranteed with me on your team.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Kongou μ：</span><br>
Oh? Have you secured us an advantage?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Akagi μ：</span><br>
Of course I have. I convinced the entirety of Polaris to team up with us.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Kongou μ：</span><br>
This may be rude of me to ask, but you didn't "convince" them by force, did you?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Akagi μ：</span><br>
It should go without saying that I didn't. If you don't believe me, just ask Gascogne.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Gascogne μ：</span><br>
Akagi has not made any threats toward me.<br>
I have simply gained new insight into the meaning of the word "idol," and I joined the blue team to demonstrate it to my Master.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Kongou μ：</span><br>
I... see... I apologize, Akagi. I shouldn't be so suspicious of you.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Akagi μ：</span><br>
Apology accepted. To bring us back on topic, I also spoke to another unit.<br>
I'm not very keen on allying with old rivals of mine... but I won't shy away from it if that's what it takes to win.<br>
Verheerender, you're late. Why is that?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Roon μ：</span><br>
I'm really sorry. I was rehearsing, then I thought about the ways I was going to crush my enemies and I lost track of time.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Taihou μ：</span><br>
Tsk... I'm only doing this for my Commander. Otherwise I wouldn't be caught dead helping you.<br>
If and when I win, I will spend my wish on my Commander, and then... Hehehehe...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Akagi μ：</span><br>
Oh, you're saying that to my face and think I'll let it slip? The only love that will appease the Commander is MY love!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Roon μ：</span><br>
Heehee. Looks like I've made new enemies today.<br>

<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Memphis：</span><br>
And that sums it up for how both teams' recruiting efforts are going.<br>
I'll let you know right away if there are any membership changes.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Alright. Appreciate it, Memphis.<br>
That blue team, though... They have Akagi, Taihou, AND Roon.<br>
*sigh*... I hope my fears about them prove unfounded.<br>
<br>
I breathe a weary sigh, then spot a shadowy figure quietly entering my office.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Clemenceau：</span><br>
Well, making two rivals join up is no easy feat, even if it's in their shared interest.<br>
Think of it this way – them being on the same team is proof that they're getting along.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
I sure hope they are.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Memphis：</span><br>
On a similar subject... There have been rumors going around.<br>
They're saying there have been more... unusual attempts to recruit people, beyond reaching out.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Like what? Threats? Bribery?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Clemenceau：</span><br>
Oh?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Memphis：</span><br>
Things like enticing Laffey with a memory foam pillow, or Queen Elizabeth using her royal authority to forbid her subjects from joining the blue team.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Clemenceau：</span><br>
Some are willing to play dirty if it means they'll win that wish, I suppose.<br>
Now I'm starting to feel tempted to pick a side, too.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
......<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Clemenceau：</span><br>
Heehee, I'm only kidding. Don't be so alarmed.<br>
Besides, the recruitment deadline is drawing near.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Javelin：</span><br>
So, have you all decided which team you're gonna join?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ayanami：</span><br>
I haven't yet.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Z23：</span><br>
Right back at you, Javelin. Have you decided?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Javelin：</span><br>
Nope... That's why I'm asking.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Laffey：</span><br>
I've been losing sleep because of Tem from the blue team. She kept telling me to join...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Javelin：</span><br>
She has? Has she also tried to tempt you with a memory foam pillow?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Laffey：</span><br>
Nope. But I do want one of those...<br>
I caved in and said I'd join just so I could get some sleep.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ayanami：</span><br>
If that was the price for sleep, I'd pay it, too.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Javelin：</span><br>
That's fair.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Z23：</span><br>
Laffey, you shouldn't have said yes so casually. You should've told her to stop bothering you first.<br>
Just for that, I'm joining team red. When I win, I'll make her apologize for disturbing your sleep.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Javelin：</span><br>
Huh? Is joining them just to spite the other team really such a good idea?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ayanami：</span><br>
That's not such a big deal. I wouldn't worry about it.<br>

<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Noshiro μ：</span><br>
Okay, 30 minutes on skincare after waking up...<br>
After that, 30 minutes of warmup exercises and 10 minutes of finger stretches...<br>
Then comes the exercises to cover for each other's flaws, and don't forget to practice your stage face...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Sakawa：</span><br>
Noshiro? What are you doing here?<br>
Shouldn't you be out looking for new members with Eugen and Formidable?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Noshiro μ：</span><br>
I considered it, but I'm just not very good at persuading people.<br>
We talked about it and decided that they'll do recruitment while I schedule our rehearsals.<br>
Besides, it takes more than just recruiting people to win. We need to hone our performance skills, too.<br>
Taking full advantage of the Muse System takes practice, practice, practice.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Sakawa：</span><br>
I knew you'd say that. You know what? Let me and Agano help you out on the recruitment side of things!<br>
<br>
Finally, the deadline for recruiting new members passed.<br>
At the end of it all, the blue team had secured Polaris, Verheerender, and the Dragon Sisters.<br>
They also had Unicorn and Laffey, who joined as solo acts.<br>
The red team, meanwhile, had the talented units Lumière and Astrum.<br>
Their ranks also included individual idols like Fubuki, Queen Elizabeth, Z23, and Hammann.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Queen Elizabeth：</span><br>
The blue team may have us beat in the membership department...<br>
But our team has more units than they do!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Formidable μ：</span><br>
That's an issue, Your Majesty! There must be an equal number of units for the competition to even happen!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Noshiro μ：</span><br>
Making one unit leave is definitely off the table. I think we'll need to merge multiple units.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Prinz Eugen μ：</span><br>
Seems so. It wouldn't be fair otherwise.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Formidable μ：</span><br>
It's our only option.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Queen Elizabeth：</span><br>
Hmph! I want to demonstrate my greatness on my own terms! I will NOT team up with anybody!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Hammann：</span><br>
I want to sing solo, too! A-and not because I only want the Commander to see my performance, not at all!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Fubuki：</span><br>
Z23, you wanna team up and make a temporary unit with me?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Z23：</span><br>
Sure. And if others move around a bit, we should end up with an equal number of units!<br>
Once everyone has been assigned, each unit should give a demonstration of their performance.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Noshiro μ：</span><br>
The two most important things in a performance are character and passion. The songs we go with should reflect that.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Prinz Eugen μ：</span><br>
Yes, the previous tests proved that pretty well. The best kind of performance is one that lets you fully express your feelings.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Formidable μ：</span><br>
Remember, ladies – we are all one unit now, so let's not get on each other's nerves, alright?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Noshiro μ：</span><br>
I've created learning and rehearsal schedules. I'd like us all to stick to them as much as possible.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Prinz Eugen μ：</span><br>
You heard her, folks. You'll have to really give it your all if you want to get your wish.<br>
Not that it matters, because I'm not letting anyone else have it.<br>

<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Taihou μ：</span><br>
I told you already! All you need is passion!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Akagi μ：</span><br>
Your idea of a performance is too violent! The other team will use that against you!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Laffey：</span><br>
Zzz... I'm going to sleep...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ning Hai：</span><br>
Boise, do you want a baozi? It's fresh out of the oven!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Boise μ：</span><br>
Huff... Puff... Y-yes please.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Kongou μ：</span><br>
......<br>
How did we get to this point? We were just discussing performances and tactics...<br>
You are all severely lacking in grace!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Le Téméraire μ：</span><br>
What's wrong with it? They're creating a lively atmosphere! That's what idols are supposed to do!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Kongou μ：</span><br>
In that way, I suppose you're right.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Le Téméraire μ：</span><br>
Exactly! In fact, I think building hype is our team's greatest strength!<br>
It's just like the kind of energy Cyanidin brings – cheerful, fun, and full of aspiration!<br>
Then again, maybe not all of us are like that. Ahaha...<br>
But that's okay! Being yourself is the most important trait an idol can have!<br>

<br>
Port - Office<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">???：</span><br>
Guess who!<br>
<br>
I'm processing paperwork when all of a sudden someone covers my eyes from behind.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Jacinto? Are you on bring-me-paperwork duty today?<br>
<br>
I say her name, and she uncovers my eyes.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">San Jacinto：</span><br>
You're no fun! You're supposed to guess it wrong at least a few times first!<br>
But yes, you're right. It's my turn to deliver documents today.<br>
I have a report on both teams' use of the port's facilities. Would you like to read that first?<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
I'll read it after I've finished the list of potential hosts.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">San Jacinto：</span><br>
Hosts? Multiple? Isn't Akashi running the show alone, as usual?<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
No, we'll need multiple this time since both teams are getting their own stage.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">San Jacinto：</span><br>
Let me have a look... Ah, Harbin will host for the red team, and the blue team will get Saratoga.<br>
Looks like you've already made up your mind. That's a shame, because I was hoping I'd get the chance to host.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Really? You'd like to be a host?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">San Jacinto：</span><br>
Kind of. Not for the job itself, but because it'd let me spend more time with you!<br>
Oh, on another note, I think there's a loophole in the competition's rules.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Prinz Eugen μ：</span><br>
The rules this time are: each unit will appear on stage, deliver a performance, and be graded accordingly.<br>
Therefore, the team whose units score the highest on average will win the competition.<br>
But, if for some reason a unit is unable to appear on stage...<br>
Then the competition is as good as over then and there.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Formidable μ：</span><br>
Listen, Eugen. We will not resort to such unsportsmanlike tactics.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Prinz Eugen μ：</span><br>
No, I'm not saying we should sabotage the other team.<br>
I'm just telling you that this loophole exists. I told them, too.<br>
Also, there's no guarantee their team won't exploit it even if we won't. I guess we just have to trust them.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Kongou μ：</span><br>
There may be a loophole, but actually using it would be very dishonorable.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Le Téméraire μ：</span><br>
Yeah! The reason the rules were changed in the first place was to bring us all together!<br>
Winning isn't as important as everyone having fun!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Boise μ：</span><br>
I agree. The Commander wants us to win fair and square.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Roon μ：</span><br>
Even I treat my opponents with respect up until the moment I crush them like insects.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Akagi μ：</span><br>
There are ways to sabotage them, but this just feels wrong.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Taihou μ：</span><br>
The last thing we will do is make my Commander sad!<br>

Port - Muse System Test Area<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Akashi：</span><br>
It's time for what you've been waiting for – the idol concerts are back, nya! I'm Akashi, your main master of ceremonies, nya!<br>
That's right, main, nya! This time, there are two other people hosting this event alongside me, nya!<br>
Two is the name of the game today, nya! Two teams, two stages, two more hosts, nya!<br>
Let's hear a word from the lovely ladies who are with me here today, nya!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Saratoga：</span><br>
Hiii! It's me, Sara! I'm hosting for the blue team!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Harbin：</span><br>
And I'm Harbin, the non-singing voice of the red team!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Saratoga：</span><br>
We're both so excited to be hosting this event today!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Harbin：</span><br>
Without further ado, let's introduce the faces both new and old who'll be performing!<br>
Starting with the red team! Give it up for Alizarin!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Formidable μ：</span><br>
(This is what I practiced my stage face for – so I could be at the centre of the team!)<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Noshiro μ：</span><br>
(Heehee. You sound like you're having fun.)<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Formidable μ：</span><br>
(I certainly am. I've been waiting to flaunt my charm on stage in front of an audience!)<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Prinz Eugen μ：</span><br>
(You have the confidence to take center stage, but don't forget about the teamwork.)<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Formidable μ：</span><br>
(Yes, yes, I know!)<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Saratoga：</span><br>
And now for the blue team! A round of applause for Cyanidin!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Le Téméraire μ：</span><br>
Oh gosh! I knew we were going big, just not THIS big!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Kongou μ：</span><br>
(Téméraire! You're the center, so please act with due elegance!)<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Le Téméraire μ：</span><br>
(Oops! Sorry! I'll focus! Boise, how are you holding up?)<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Boise μ：</span><br>
(Huff... Puff... I-I'm trying to imagine the audience in their underwear!)<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Akashi：</span><br>
These are the new units participating in this Muse System test, nya! There's powerful shipgirls on both sides, nya!<br>
That's not all, nya! Some familiar faces will be performing today as well, nya!<br>
First up, the powerhouse unit Polaris and the beautiful but dangerous Verheerender, nya!<br>
Then there's the graceful yet slothful Lumière, and the shining stars of Astrum, nya! This sing-off is bound to be the most exciting yet, nya!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Saratoga：</span><br>
And last, but not least – the many, many idols without Muse Systems who are also participating!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Harbin：</span><br>
Oh yes! Let me hear you clap first for the Empery's reps, the Dragon Sisters!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Saratoga：</span><br>
Hey! I was gonna introduce them!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Harbin：</span><br>
It just feels right for me to do the honors! Let me be a little biased toward my countrymen!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Akashi：</span><br>
Uh-oh, we're running a little short on time, nya! Let's get everyone up on stage right now!<br>
<br>
A brief flurry occurred as the shipgirls got up on stage, all donning idol attire.<br>
There was the temporary duo of Z23 and Fubuki, and Queen Elizabeth, Laffey, Unicorn, and Hammann, too.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Akashi：</span><br>
There you have it, nya! As per the rules, both teams will perform on stage at the same time, nya!<br>
They'll then be rated based on the quality of their performance and their appeal, nya!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Harbin&Saratoga：</span><br>
Good luck, girls!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Everyone：</span><br>
It's showtime!<br>

<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Sheffield μ：</span><br>
Whew... Performing simultaneously with your opponent is much more tiring than I thought.<br>
Maintaining the audience's attention is not at all an easy task.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Cleveland μ：</span><br>
You could say that again. But while it's hard, it really gets you fired up!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Gascogne μ：</span><br>
Increased activity detected in Gascogne's emotion module.<br>
Hypothesis: I love being on stage!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Admiral Hipper μ：</span><br>
Seriously? There's nothing to love about this charade. Well, other than getting to put Eugen in her place. Otherwise I wouldn't be here.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Akagi μ：</span><br>
One thing is clear – we cannot let the red team win.<br>
Polaris will surely sing their hearts out, and I expect the rest of you to do the same.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Taihou μ：</span><br>
You say that like I plan to deliver a lukewarm performance. Nobody shall have my Commander's eyes but me.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Roon μ：</span><br>
We just need to wipe out– Sorry, I mean outperform them.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Illustrious μ：</span><br>
You all did great out there.<br>
Having said that, the other team is putting up a really good fight, too.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Albacore μ：</span><br>
So what? They might be good, but OUR performance knocked the crowds' socks off!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Baltimore μ：</span><br>
She's right. The crowd went wild for us out there.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Tashkent μ：</span><br>
Is that so? I guess I did get pretty worked up on the stage. Our scores should be fine.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Dido µ：</span><br>
I felt that, too. Thinking about my beloved Master allowed me to give the performance 120%!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Illustrious μ：</span><br>
Heehee. At any rate, we have done our part.<br>
Now it's up to the other units to prove their mettle.<br>
{{折叠面板|内容结束}}

{{折叠面板|标题=A Brief Breather|选项=13|主框=1|样式=primary|展开=是}}
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Saratoga：</span><br>
And that's it from Polaris and Astrum! They really put on some incredible performances!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Harbin：</span><br>
True that. They were both so good, I couldn't take my eyes off either one.<br>
This whole "two groups performing at the same time" thing is a new feature, right?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Saratoga：</span><br>
It sure is! It has posed a very unique and interesting challenge for the idols singing today.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Harbin：</span><br>
I can see that. Both sides are vying for attention, so it becomes a test of how good they are at captivating the audience.<br>
If you can't keep up, that's game over for you!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Saratoga：</span><br>
Exactly. That's why they all need to bring their A-game!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Harbin：</span><br>
Speaking of A-games, I think it's time for the next units to get up on stage.<br>
<br>
Meanwhile, in the dressing room...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Formidable μ：</span><br>
Goodness gracious. Even Illustrious' unit is having stiff competition.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Noshiro μ：</span><br>
It'll be fine. We've all rehearsed as much as anyone possibly could.<br>
Serious effort never goes unacknowledged.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Prinz Eugen μ：</span><br>
Sounds like someone's tense. I'll gladly take center if you want.<br>
I'm absolutely certain I can outperform Hipper, or anyone in their unit, for that matter.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Formidable μ：</span><br>
I'm not tense! And I don't doubt that I can outperform them either!<br>
If anything, I'd like to ask you to please try to keep pace with ME!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Unicorn：</span><br>
I'm feeling nervous... I hope my song will reach big brother's heart...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Queen Elizabeth：</span><br>
They will witness my beauty and charm and bend the knee to me!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Laffey：</span><br>
I'm done. I can finally sleep now...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Fubuki：</span><br>
Z23, you sure our unit doesn't need a name?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Z23：</span><br>
I mean... Coming up with a good name isn't so easy.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ning Hai：</span><br>
Okay, Ping! One more time from the top before we go on stage!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ping Hai：</span><br>
You got it!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Le Malin μ：</span><br>
I'll give this 100% now so I can give everything else 0% later!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Hammann：</span><br>
This is taking so long! Let me perform for the Commander already!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Le Téméraire μ：</span><br>
Sounds like everyone's fired up! In their own way.<br>
Kongou, you look tense. Loosen up and smile! Positive energy is our bread and butter!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Boise μ：</span><br>
Huff... Puff... Sh-she's right. Let's all try to show our best sides.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Kongou μ：</span><br>
*sigh*... Yes, you're both right. Thank you.<br>
Let's take a deep breath... then go out on stage and deliver the best performance of our lives!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Saratoga：</span><br>
Oh, look! I think the teams are ready!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Harbin&Saratoga：</span><br>
Alright, everyone! Let's give a round of applause for the next units!<br>

<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Saratoga：</span><br>
What? Lemme see!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Akashi：</span><br>
Nyahaha! Both teams have put on some incredible performances so far, nya! Now it's time to announce their current scores, nya!<br>
...Nya? Unbelievable, nya! They're perfectly tied, nya!<br>
It's anyone's game now, nya! The final two units will determine the outcome of the whole competition, nya!<br>
The question is – who'll win, nya?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Harbin：</span><br>
Will it be the determined, passionate, and powerful Alizarin?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Saratoga：</span><br>
Or will Cyanidin clutch the win with their fresh vibes and beaming energy?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Akashi：</span><br>
Stay tuned until the end to find out, nya!<br>

(Be sure to focus on the rhythm for this part. Stick to the plan and everything will go smoothly.)<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Prinz Eugen μ：</span><br>

<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Akashi：</span><br>
Whoa, whoa, whoa! I've never seen anything like this, nya!<br>
Both their scores and Muse System output are off the charts, nya! The scoreboard's gonna overflow, nya!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Formidable μ：</span><br>
Unleash the wellspring of emotion inside you and let it flow through your song!<br>

(Commander, this is my whole, unfiltered being! I hope these feelings reach you!)<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Prinz Eugen μ：</span><br>
Yes, that's it. Don't look away – keep your eyes on me.<br>
My song, my dance, my performance... It's all for you!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Noshiro μ：</span><br>
It's still not enough! More, harder, louder!<br>
My song has to carry these feelings straight into your heart!<br>

Great Scott, nya! Alizarin's readings suddenly just shot through the roof, nya!<br>

I've got to deliver a flawless performance!<br>

Heehee! The hype is at an all-time high! Commander, I hope you're watching!<br>
I'm gonna pour my all into this and show you the best, most dreamy performance ever!<br>

We're past the point of needing to joke about the reason why I became an idol.<br>
The real reason was that I did it for you, Commander! All so you could see me at my best!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Akashi：</span><br>
Nyanyanyaaa! Now it's happening with Cyanidin as well, nya!<br>
Stop, stop, stooop, nya! Any more and the stages are gonna explode, nyaaa!<br>

KABOOOM!<br>
The stages went boom, turning to scrap all the data instruments and equipment installed on and around them.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Akashi：</span><br>
Commander... How are we gonna determine a victor now?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Mikasa：</span><br>
They made the scoreboard explode... It's impossible to say which side performed best.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Marco Polo：</span><br>
You can't decide arbitrarily, but at the same time, there will be an outrage if you call it a draw.<br>
<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项1：Let me think about it.</span>'''''<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项2：Plan B. Bring out the time machine.</span>'''''<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项1）</span>'''''This is a delicate situation and I need to weigh my options first.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项2）</span>'''''I just need to go back to before the boom and stop them!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Mikasa：</span><br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项2）</span>'''''What are you talking about? Did the explosion give you a concussion or something?<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项2）</span>'''''I was just trying to lift the mood with a joke. Forget it.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Hang on, what did both teams' Muse data say before the scoreboard blew up?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Akashi：</span><br>
I don't know whose is whose, nya! They're both identical, nya!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Clemenceau：</span><br>
I have a theory. Both teams pushed each other until it caused a resonance loop between their Muse Systems.<br>
Then the resonance amplified their output so much that it overloaded the scoreboard and made it explode.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
If so, it's impossible to crown the victor based on maximum utilization.<br>
(But maybe there's no need to. Maybe both sides can be winners.)<br>
(I'm fine with paying a bit out of pocket if it'll make everyone happy. The only thing preventing us from giving wishes to both sides was our budget, anyway.)<br>
Akashi, apropos nothing, what's the budget difference between first and second place?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Akashi：</span><br>
Nya? Uh, well...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Clemenceau：</span><br>
Allow me to answer. I relieved her of the task of budgeting much earlier.<br>
First and second place both have ludicrously lavish budgets thanks to the omni-factional sponsorships.<br>
<br>
A devious smile forms on Clemenceau's lips. I suddenly realize that I'm bracing for impact.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Clemenceau：</span><br>
It's 9,999,999,999,999,999 coins for first place, and 999,999,999,999,999 coins for second place. That's one 9 less.<br>
Simply put, both budgets are practically infinite and capable of granting almost literally any wish.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Wait, WHAT?!<br>
So... I have to make EVERYONE'S wishes come true?!<br>

Port - Office<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Noshiro μ：</span><br>
Hello, Commander.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Boise μ：</span><br>
H-hi.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Noshiro μ：</span><br>
I've compiled a report on this Muse System test from the perspective of Alizarin.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Boise μ：</span><br>
And I've got one from Cyanidin's perspective.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Thanks. You've saved me a lot of work.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Boise μ：</span><br>
Don't mention it. I-it's part of our official duties anyway. Huff...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Noshiro μ：</span><br>
Yes, it's just what's expected of us.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
How are your other members doing? Are they still resting?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Noshiro μ：</span><br>
Not all of them. Illustrious said she'll give Formidable a stern lecture on manners, and Eugen is looking into the resonance phenomenon.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Boise μ：</span><br>
It really fr-freaked me out when that happened...<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
(We're three tests deep into the Muse System, and there is still so much we don't know about it. More than we even realized.)<br>
(One thing is clear – more tests need to be run in the future.)<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Noshiro μ：</span><br>
Also, why are you still working, Commander? I think you have more pressing things to do.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Excuse me?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Noshiro μ：</span><br>
If memory serves me right, you're supposed to grant Akagi's and Taihou's wishes today.<br>
Then Eugen's after that, then Roon, followed by Unicorn and Hammann.<br>
And then Illustrious, then me.<br>
D-don't forget about me. And I think Téméraire and Kongou have their turn later tonight.<br>
<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项1：Okay, okay, I get it.</span>'''''<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项2：I feel a headache coming on...</span>'''''<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项1）</span>'''''I know there's no running away from my duty...<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项1）</span>'''''But please, let's talk about anything else right now!<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项2）</span>'''''As much as I like making others happy, hearing all those names makes my head hurt.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
So... I have to make EVERYONE'S wishes come true?!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Clemenceau：</span><br>
That's right. It's not as bad as it sounds – the organizing committee can handle some of the legwork for you.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Some of it?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Clemenceau：</span><br>
Mhm. Although, if all their wishes personally involve you, then you're out of luck. Heehee.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
(EVERYONE'S wishes involved me in one way or another...)<br>
(Well, except for Laffey who wanted a memory foam pillow, and Le Malin who wanted a year free of all work.)<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Akagi：</span><br>
Heehee... Commander, I'm here to pick you up!<br>
Surely you haven't forgotten about our date!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Taihou：</span><br>
Not so fast! It hasn't been decided which of us is going first!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Akagi：</span><br>
It has now. I got here first.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Taihou：</span><br>
So what? Do you think I'll just happily accept that? The Commander is MINE!<br>
<br>
A bitter argument breaks out in my office as both of the red-dressed ladies fight over who gets me first.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
(I guess it's up to me to determine their order... My work day isn't over quite yet.)<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Akagi & Taihou：</span><br>
Commander! My Commander!<br>
I've got it! Let's just all go on a date together!<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Ugh...<br>
