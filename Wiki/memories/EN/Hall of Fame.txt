SP Amagi<br>
<br>
Morning Dreamscape<br>
The warm sunlight pouring through the window painted an idyllic scenery in front of me.<br>
While my consciousness was still floating about lazily, I was snapped back to reality by the sound of conversation coming from the kitchen.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">???：</span><br>
Would you believe what that woman said to me, dear sister? How terribly rude of her!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">??：</span><br>
Oh my...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">???：</span><br>
I was able to resolve the little problem I had with the Eagle Union thanks to your help, but things haven't been any less troublesome since then...<br>
And I'm not so lacking in self-awareness as to trouble the Commander over it!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">??：</span><br>
Now now, Akagi, there's no need to get so worked up... This time, why not try to talk things through instead of resorting to fighting...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">???：</span><br>
Not again with that "kiss and make up" deal...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">??：</span><br>
I'm sure you and Kaga will learn to get along just fine. Hehe~<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">???：</span><br>
......Fiiiine.<br>
Oh no, I need to get to the meeting soon... I wonder if the Commander is still asleep?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">??：</span><br>
Please don't disturb the Commander's rest. Last night's work was arduous after all.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">???：</span><br>
If you say so, dear sister...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">??：</span><br>
There's no need to pout. Go on now, don't keep Kaga and the others waiting.<br>
<br>
.........<br>
I remember now. Today was supposed to be my day off, and––<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Amagi：</span><br>
Did the miso soup go cold...?<br>
<br>
Amagi, who had prepared a late breakfast, checked in on me with worry in her voice.<br>
Apparently, I had overslept and missed the time I was supposed to have breakfast with Akagi and Amagi.<br>
To alleviate her concern, I dug into the savory miso soup and the carefully crafted meal.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Amagi：</span><br>
Ehehe, I'm glad it's to your liking, Commander.<br>
I know you've been quite busy recently, so I was wondering if you'd like me to do more to tend to your health.<br>
Otherwise, you'll be hearing an awful lot of Akagi's grumbling every day. Just a friendly word of advice from your local Amagi~<br>
<br>
Grumbling? Knowing Akagi... she'd make me take time off, forcibly if need be.<br>
But, she has a point. I can't have Amagi of all people worrying about my health...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Amagi：</span><br>
I did promise to take care of myself, but my promise doesn't end with my own health. Hehe~<br>
Come to think of it, since you do have the day off... Let's take advantage of the opportunity and have a little outing.<br>
Of course, if you're feeling too tired, you should head back and get some more sleep.<br>
<br>
I had no other plans for the day, so heading out for a stroll sounded like a good idea.<br>
More importantly...<br>
<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项1："How are you doing, Amagi?"</span>'''''<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Amagi：</span><br>
Hehe, are you worried about me? I'm doing just fine.<br>
As you can see, there's nothing for you to worry about, Commander. Here~<br>
...Say "ahh"~<br>
<br>
Amagi gingerly brought a piece of kawashi mochi to my lips.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Amagi：</span><br>
...These might look a bit like Manjuus, but I assure you, they're quite delicious. Hehe~<br>
Commander, if you like the taste, you're welcome to have more~<br>
<br>
After finishing the food, Amagi and I tidied the room up, after which I accompanied her on the sofa.<br>
After all the life-or-death decisions I've had to make on the battlefield, moments like these are like a dream come true...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Amagi：</span><br>
Mm... Being able to spend my days with Akagi, stay by your side, and enjoy this peace... Indeed, it is a bit like a "dream," isn't it?<br>
Even such a distant, blissful dream... will surely come to fruition one day, as long as that's what you desire. Right, Commander?<br>
Understand our past, and trascend fate. Forge new bonds, and create a new history...<br>
<br>
Her ephemeral presence felt so weighty over my shoulder.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Amagi：</span><br>
Please don't forget, Commander.<br>
May all your dreams come true.<br>
After all, that is something only "people" can do, not Cubes...<br>

SP Laffey<br>
<br>
A Nappy Place<br>
Zzz...<br>
Zzz... Zzzzz.... Zzzzzzzzz...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">？？？：</span><br>
Commander...<br>
Wakey wakey... It's time for work...<br>
<br>
"Owch!"<br>
A pair of fingers pinched my cheek, urging me to wake up. I opened my eyes to see who did it.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Laffey：</span><br>
Commander... You always sleep like a log... Poke poke...<br>
<br>
In front of me was Laffey, prodding me with her index finger to make sure I was awake.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Laffey：</span><br>
There... You up now?<br>
<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项1："I'm up."</span>'''''<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项2："5 more minutes..."</span>'''''<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Laffey：</span><br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项1）</span>'''''Good... Then I'm gonna take a nap...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Laffey：</span><br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项2）</span>'''''C'mon, you've got work to do...<br>
<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项2）</span>'''''She pinched my cheek a second time, forcing me to get up anyway.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Laffey：</span><br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项2）</span>'''''There we go... Now it's Laffey's turn... to take a nap...<br>
<br>
She did so immediately, flopping onto the couch and getting ready to go to dreamland.<br>
Suddenly, I remembered why she was in my office to begin with...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Laffey：</span><br>
Commander, do you know a good nap spot...?<br>
I'm looking for a new cozy place... So if you know any...<br>
<br>
A niche club had sprung up at the port. The Napping Club. For shipgirls who like taking naps. Quite self-explanatory.<br>
"Why are you looking for a new one? I thought you already napped in the school yard, the library, or the theater room?"<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Laffey：</span><br>
Yeah, but I want a spot all to myself...<br>
Which is why I'm wondering if you had any ideas...<br>
<br>
"Hmm... Let me think..."<br>
I thought long and hard, but couldn't come up with anything. And that's how we wound up in this scenario.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Laffey：</span><br>
Zzzzz...<br>
<br>
Although there was nothing wrong with Laffey coming to my office for a nap, I couldn't just let her lie here forever.<br>
Out of the blue, there was a knock on the door.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Nowaki：</span><br>
Zzz... So this is where she went off to...?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Nicholas：</span><br>
Coming in, don't mind me...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Surcouf：</span><br>
Mrmhh... Zzzzz...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Shinano ：</span><br>
......<br>
<br>
A small horde of sleepy invaders marched into my office. The Napping Club had come for a surprise visit.<br>
Most likely, Nowaki had figured out this is where Laffey was through blind luck, and jumped to the conclusion that this is their new napping spot.<br>
It was too late to turn them away, so I decided to just put up with a room full of nappers just for today...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Laffey：</span><br>
Ugh... It's time to wake up...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Nowaki：</span><br>
Hmh...? What is it, Laffey...?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Nicholas：</span><br>
Geesh... I'm trying to get some sleep here... *yaaawn*...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Surcouf：</span><br>
Hrm? What the... How'd we end up in here?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Laffey：</span><br>
Sorry, guys... This office is only big enough for me... The commander can't work with you all around...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Shinano ：</span><br>
...I see... I do apologize...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Laffey：</span><br>
Ugh... It's time to wake up...<br>
<br>
The noise must've woken Laffey. She began nudging all the nappers, driving them out of my office one by one.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Laffey：</span><br>
Finally... Now I can get some peace and quiet... *yaaawn*...<br>
Night night... Zzzzz...<br>
<br>
Laffey seemed set on making this her official new napping spot. I had little choice but to accept it.<br>
That being the case, the least I could do was cover her with something so she doesn't catch a cold. I took my coat and carefully tucked her in.<br>

<br>
SP Bismarck<br>
<br>
While the Coffee is Hot<br>
There I stood, at the door to the Iron Blood's workshop. The sounds of hammering and bolting were coming from inside.<br>
Upon opening the door, I was greeted by the voice of a woman surrounded by a mountain of machine parts and metal materials.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Bismarck：</span><br>
Who might that be? Ah, let me guess...<br>
You didn't introduce yourself at once, so you can't be U-556. Your footsteps didn't sound like Zeppelin's or Gneisenau's either.<br>
You've come alone, and quite late in the evening at that. That leaves but one candidate...<br>
Welcome, Commander. My hands are full at the moment, but feel free to make yourself comfortable.<br>
<br>
She was the source of the sounds. It seemed she was building something.<br>
Deciding to stick around, I sat on a chair a fair distance from her so I wouldn't get in the way.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Rigging：</span><br>
GRRRRGGHH!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Bismarck：</span><br>
Take it easy. The commander's not a threat. There, good boy.<br>
Hmm. It needs some fine-tuning. I'll talk to Friedrich about that later...<br>
<br>
Bismarck decided it was time for a break. She put down her tools, stood up, and walked over to a coffeemaker placed in a corner of the room. She took out two paper cups.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Bismarck：</span><br>
Care for some coffee? It's not the best, but it's an adequate amenity for a workshop.<br>
I prefer mine black, but if you'd like a bit of sugar or creamer, just tell me.<br>
...It's done. Here you go.<br>
Last refill now. We don't want to have too much, or it'll affect our performance in the office tomorrow.<br>
Now... To what do I owe the pleasure? I'd imagine you have better things to do at this hour.<br>
<br>
The scent of freshly-ground coffee beans filled the air. I took in the smell as I thought about the answer to her question.<br>
"There are two reasons. The first is simple – I'm seeing what's up around the port."<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Bismarck：</span><br>
Seeing what's up, you say? Not much, on the whole.<br>
Although, it's true the Iron Blood is a faction with many secrets. If I were you, I'd regularly check in and have a look around too.<br>
Me especially, seeing as I am the leader of the Iron Blood. The woman with the permanent pokerface. She has got to be planning something...<br>
Yes... Planning what to have for dinner, perhaps.<br>
<br>
She downplayed it as a joke, although I had no reason to believe she meant the first half seriously in the first place.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Bismarck：</span><br>
Being a leader, someone who looks after those under their command, is quite tiring.<br>
I'm sure you know what it's like, Commander. From the thrill of issuing an order, to the doubt when you lack information crucial to making an informed decision...<br>
And in my case... The emptiness of when you're losing sight of yourself... "Am I Bismarck, or am I the Iron Blood's flagship?"<br>
<br>
Bismarck was a leader with a strict sense of duty that seemed to cause her endless woe and doubt...<br>
But, this strict sense of duty is also what fueled her desire to do everything she could for humanity, regardless of the consequences for herself.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Bismarck：</span><br>
Naturally, I don't want to forget myself. That is why I created this place solely for myself. A place where I can just create and study.<br>
I don't know what your mind conjures up when it thinks "Bismarck." But if you wonder about me...<br>
Then this place where you stand, what you see around you, this person before you now... is the answer.<br>
<br>
Putting down her cup on the work table, the Iron Blood leader clad in a black uniform turned to face me.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Bismarck：</span><br>
I have you to thank for this. For letting me be myself.<br>
I'm sure U-556, Tirpitz, and all my Iron Blood comrades are grateful for it as well.<br>
So, thank you, Commander. Thank you for everything, always.<br>
<br>
Bismarck smiled at me. It was the first time I'd seen her smile from the heart, as solely herself.<br>
It felt like I'd manage to ease the burden on her shoulders, even if only a little bit, by talking to her today.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Bismarck：</span><br>
...Sorry, I just realized I've been going on and on about myself.<br>
You said you had two reasons for coming here. What's the other?<br>
<br>
I reached into my pocket, took out two opera tickets, and presented them to her.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Bismarck：</span><br>
Ahah. I see... It's starting pretty soon, I see.<br>
Perfect timing. I did say this would be our last cup of coffee for the evening, after all.<br>
<br>
And what great coffee it was. It had such a supple, yet clean aftertaste.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Bismarck：</span><br>
Just asking, but... Would you say I should stick to black garments for the opera?<br>

Date-Night Concert<br>
I went to attend a wonderful concert at Friedrich der Große's invitation.<br>
Though the concert is now over, my heart is still reverberating to the music's lingering afterglow, making it difficult for me to compose myself.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Friedrich der Große：</span><br>
So, how did you find that performance?<br>
...Is what I planned on asking you originally. Though, you look a bit too intoxicated to give me any sort of concrete answer~<br>
That just means there's no need to pursue the question any further, haha.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
The world built by music does that to people. Thank you for bringing me along.<br>
But, I am rather surprised that you sat with me in the audience. I thought... you'd be on stage, conducting or something.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Friedrich der Große：</span><br>
Normally, yes, I would be the one to be putting on the performance.<br>
But this time, I thought it would be nice to sit by your side, enjoying an intimate evening together...<br>
Which is why I decided to be an ordinary listener. And that was my plan all along.<br>
Having that said, despite the performance being thoroughly enjoyable, there is one thing I regret...<br>
<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项1：...Regret?</span>'''''<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Friedrich der Große：</span><br>
Yes, just one thing.<br>
I regret that I am not the one to put on the performance, but rather other people.<br>
Because seeing you so thoroughly enraptured by other people's music, rather than my own... is making me a little jealous.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
It's not such a bad thing being on this side of the stage every now and then, right?<br>
I mean, the fact that I'm getting to enjoy a concert with THE Friedrich der Große is already an honor in its own right.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Friedrich der Große：</span><br>
I know you're just trying to flatter me, but... Thank you for saying that, my child.<br>
Haha. In the end though, you're right. I'm just glad that we could enjoy this performance without anything going awry.<br>
In fact, there were a few times where I wanted to go up on that stage and grab the baton for myself... just so you would be making that intoxicated expression just for me.<br>
Luckily, you were holding onto my arm that whole time, which was the only reason I was able to restrain myself.<br>
<br>
As Friedrich mentions it, only then do I notice the red markings on her fair skin.<br>
<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项1：I'm so sorry... I had no idea I was clutching you so tightly without realizing it...</span>'''''<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项2：My bad... I guess my inner desire to stop you from leaving me was just too strong.</span>'''''<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Friedrich der Große：</span><br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项1）</span>'''''There's no need to apologize, my child. It's quite understandable––<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Friedrich der Große：</span><br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项2）</span>'''''Haha. I'm glad to hear you say that, but I already know––<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Friedrich der Große：</span><br>
You were doing that because you were sucked in so deeply by the music that it affected your emotions on a subconscious level.<br>
The way you clung to me, like an innocent, fragile baby in need of protection – tugged at my heartstrings even more than the music itself.<br>
If anything, I was overjoyed to see you need me so desperately.<br>
Hmm? It's embarrassing when I put it that way?<br>
Haha, don't worry. What happened today is just between the two of us. The way you looked will be deeply imprinted in my memory, but mine alone.<br>
So, please continue to rely on me as much as you wish. We don't get to spend time together like this all the time, so you can act a bit more spoiled, you know?<br>
<br>
After my eyes met with Friedrich's gentle gaze, I decided to give her the gift that I was planning to save until we got back home––<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Friedrich der Große：</span><br>
Wh-what's this?! A conductor's baton... with our names engraved on it?!<br>
You had something like this custom-made, just for this occasion...<br>
Haha... With this, I feel like I'll be able to make music more beautifully than ever before.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
I look forward to hearing it.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Friedrich der Große：</span><br>
And I look forward to playing it for you... My child, do you want to make a promise with me?<br>
That promise is...<br>
Next time, I'll put on a performance for you, with the baton you just gifted me.<br>
And during that performance... I will offer to you only the most splendid music, worthy of you becoming enraptured and engrossed within it.<br>
<br>
She extends her hand and wriggles her pinky in front of me.<br>
I also reach out and hook my pinky around hers. And with that, our promise is set.<br>
At that moment, the music's afterglow suddenly swirls to life within my head, intertwining with the illusion of Friedrich standing up on the stage.<br>
And I cannot help but to fall into the world of music once more––<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Friedrich der Große：</span><br>
Haha. By the looks of things, we might have to postpone our future plans a little.<br>
Please enjoy this wonderful moment to your heart's content, my dear child.<br>

The Sound of Her Breath<br>
On the way back from work, I happen to notice Prinz Eugen sneaking into the infirmary alone.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
(Is Prinz Eugen sick or something, but doesn't want anyone else finding out?)<br>
(Just in case, I'm going to follow her and see what's going on...)<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Prinz Eugen：</span><br>
Hm? Why are you here? Are you feeling unwell?<br>
You're perfectly fine? You were just curious about what I was doing here, and decided to follow me in?<br>
Heehee. You silly goose, Commander. Why else would someone go to the infirmary?<br>
But now that you mention it, I did just think of one other thing we can do here.<br>
Commander, you've been busy all day, with no time to even catch your breath.<br>
Since you're already here, why don't we take this opportunity to do a little... examination?<br>
Or... are you planning to turn me down?<br>
<br>
Even though she was asking me a question, Prinz Eugen seemed to have no intention of taking "no" for an answer.<br>
She locks the door to the infirmary and leans against the doorframe, flashing a half-smile towards me that seems to say, "you're not getting away."<br>
<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项1：Agree to be examined</span>'''''<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项2：Agree, while telling yourself that you refuse</span>'''''<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Prinz Eugen：</span><br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项1）</span>'''''Ahaha... Wise is the one who recognizes their current position. I see you're well-versed in this bit of wisdom, Commander~<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Prinz Eugen：</span><br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项2）</span>'''''Why of course~<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Prinz Eugen：</span><br>
I do hope you're on your best behavior and cooperate with me, Commander. Who knows, I might even have a little reward for you afterwards~<br>
Let's see... Which area should we start with first~<br>
<br>
Prinz Eugen certainly looks the part as she skillfully grabs a clipboard with a medical examination form.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Prinz Eugen：</span><br>
Height, weight, and body measurements are the same as before, so we can skip those for now.<br>
<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项1：The same...</span>'''''<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项2：...as before?</span>'''''<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Prinz Eugen：</span><br>
There's no need to fuss over the little things, Commander. It's only natural that I know exactly what's going on with your body's metrics... Besides, don't you think it's sweet that someone's taken such precise, exacting notice of you?<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
.........<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Prinz Eugen：</span><br>
I know. Let's do the sensory test~<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
...The sensory test?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Prinz Eugen：</span><br>
Well, yes. You know, to make sure that all your senses are functioning properly?<br>
It's divided into five parts: vision, hearing, smell, taste, and touch.<br>
So, let's start from the top–<br>
First question: Commander, do I look any different from usual today?<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
...Hwuh?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Prinz Eugen：</span><br>
What do you mean, "hwuh?" This is a basic taste of your vision.<br>
So, what about me is different from usual?<br>
<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项1：That's a trick question. I don't see anything different about you at all!</span>'''''<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项2：Hmm... Your smile looks more sparkly today?</span>'''''<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Prinz Eugen：</span><br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项1）</span>'''''Haha, wrong answer~<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项1）</span>'''''The correct answer is... I'm smiling a lot more cheerfully than before~<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Prinz Eugen：</span><br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项2）</span>'''''Haha, wrong answer~<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项2）</span>'''''The correct answer is... Nothing's different about me today, even though I do happen to be smiling a bit more~<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
It feels like no matter how I answer, you'd just do the switcheroo on me and say that I answered wrong...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Prinz Eugen：</span><br>
That's because you're always so cute when I tease you, I just can't help it sometimes~<br>
But, even I know not to take a joke too far. We'll consider this a pass.<br>
Next up, we'll test your hearing. Go ahead and close your eyes~<br>
<br>
Before I close my eyes, I see Prinz Eugen picking up a tuning fork.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
(Looks like it'll be a regular physical examination this time, right...)<br>
<br>
But, what reaches my ears are not the vibrations from the tuning fork, but rather the warmth of a girl's breath.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Prinz Eugen：</span><br>
Ich liebe dich...<br>
<br>
The voice is so mesmerizingly gentle that it almost seems like a hallucination.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Prinz Eugen：</span><br>
You can open your eyes now, Commander~<br>
<br>
As you can see, the tuning fork was just a prop~<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Prinz Eugen：</span><br>
Heehee. Commander, to prove that there's nothing wrong with your hearing, I'd like you to repeat what you just heard back to me~<br>
...Huh? You can't remember what I said at all because I startled you...?<br>
Heehee... Hahaha~<br>
<br>
Though she seemed to be laughing genuinely, I could feel an aura of discontentment coming from Prinz Eugen.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Prinz Eugen：</span><br>
Now that you bring it up, I do remember Z2 mentioning that you suffer from "selective deafness" from time to time.<br>
Maybe that was an episode we witnessed just now?<br>
Goodness, I would be careful with a hearing problem this serious. It would be terrible if you happened to miss any important commands~<br>
<br>
For whatever reason, I suddenly feel the temperature in the infirmary drop sharply...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Prinz Eugen：</span><br>
Don't worry, Commander. I'll make sure to truthfully and thoroughly record every little thing that's wrong with you in this medical report.<br>
Now then, we'll move on to the smell, taste, and touch exams in sequence.<br>
I hope your body is prepared, Commander~<br>

A Perfect Schedule<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">New Jersey：</span><br>
Good moooorning, honey~!<br>
<br>
A gentle tap on the shoulder coupled with a distinctively spirited greeting makes it quite easy to figure out who it is without even turning to look.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">New Jersey：</span><br>
It's way before the time we agreed on, you know? You didn't have to come this early!<br>
Oh...!<br>
I get it now. You must've been looking forward to today's date so badly that you came super early. Isn't that right, honey?<br>
Mmhmm! After all, you're dating the super-cute, super-smart, super-powerful, the Black Dragonest, the lovely Miss New Jersey whom you've been so charmed by recently, so it's completely understandable!<br>
<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项1：...the Black Dragonest?</span>'''''<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">New Jersey：</span><br>
Ah, umm...! Well, y'know, I was just rattling off a lot of random stuff, b-but! I'm sure one of those things matters to you, right?<br>
L-let's set all that aside for now, since I was just joking anyway! In any case–<br>
<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项1：Actually, I WAS looking forward to it!</span>'''''<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项2：Actually, I was really, really looking forward to it!</span>'''''<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">New Jersey：</span><br>
R-really? Oh, umm...<br>
Geez, honey, I didn't expect you to be that forward... You're gonna make me blush if you suddenly spring that on me!<br>
Ahem~ In any case, I've put together the perfect arrangement for today's date plans!<br>
Honey, all you need to do is relax and follow my lead, and I'll make sure you have the happiest, most fulfilling day ever!<br>
Our first stop... is the movie theater!<br>
<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项1：You want to go to the movies first thing in the morning?</span>'''''<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项2：Sounds like a plan!</span>'''''<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">New Jersey：</span><br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项1）</span>'''''Because there's a really good movie showing at that time! I'm sure you're gonna love it too, honey!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">New Jersey：</span><br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项2）</span>'''''Yay~ Looks like you're all fired up already, honey~! That's what I love to see!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">New Jersey：</span><br>
Oh right, almost forgot...<br>
C'mon, take my hand! Heehee~ It won't feel like a date if we don't lock fingers~<br>
All righty, time to set off... for the movie theater!<br>
<br>
Just as New Jersey said, the movie theater was only our first stop. After that, we went to the shopping district, the aquarium...<br>
She said all I needed to do is follow her lead, but I never expected her to plan out a full day's worth of places and events in an orderly manner, without making a single miscalculation.<br>
Eventually, the sun began to set–<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">New Jersey：</span><br>
Honey, this is the last stop on today's ride~<br>
A family-owned burger joint that has Ticonderoga's seal of approval!<br>
The burgers they serve up are not only delicious and filling, but even come with random prizes!<br>
You must be hungry after having fun all day, right? Then, let's hurry up and–<br>
<br>
Suddenly, New Jersey's words and footsteps fell silent as we approached the front of the closed door.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">New Jersey：</span><br>
Due to certain circumstances, we will be closed for the day and will resume normal operating hours tomorrow~'...?<br>
...H-how could this be?!<br>
Crap... I've really messed it up this time...<br>
<br>
New Jersey had been totally confident and in her element all day, but now she's hanging her head in disappointment.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">New Jersey：</span><br>
I'm sorry, honey, I should've called in advance and been more thorough in my planning...<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
There's only so much you can realistically do. These things do happen from time to time.<br>
Don't worry. We can always try our luck somewhere else.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">New Jersey：</span><br>
Heehee. You're so nice, honey... Then, I shouldn't be sulking either!<br>
Oh... That's right! There was one other place I scoped out as a backup plan!<br>
C'mon, honey~ It's a Royal Isles restaurant that should be open right now. Let's go grab ourselves a good seat!<br>
<br>
After dinner, New Jersey suddenly took out a notebook from her lap and started writing something down into it.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">New Jersey：</span><br>
Gotta learn my lesson after this restaurant incident...<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
(Wait, did New Jersey prepare an entire notebook for our date...?)<br>
<br>
I can't help but be curious.<br>
In the gaps between New Jersey's fingertips, I can vaguely see cutouts and maps attached to the notebook.<br>
There are various circles and lines drawn on the maps, and they were even labeled with words that appeared to be "critical offensive" or "all-out advance"...<br>
For whatever reason, the only words that enter my head are "this looks like a full-blown battleplan".<br>
In addition, there are a variety of sticky notes in the margins... They might have been added by Ticonderoga?<br>
Wait... Seeing how seriously New Jersey is summarizing her experiences, maybe she was the one who wrote them as well?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">New Jersey：</span><br>
Hooooney! What are you staring at a girl's diary for?!<br>
Every girl's gotta keep her secrets, y'know? I wouldn't let you see, even if you asked super nicely!<br>
...But tell me the truth, you didn't see anything inside, did you?<br>
<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项1：I saw a tactical battle map.</span>'''''<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项2：I saw some sticky notes.</span>'''''<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">New Jersey：</span><br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项1）</span>'''''Heehee~ Close enough, but I'd call it more of a tactical date map~<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">New Jersey：</span><br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项2）</span>'''''Heehee~ Those are the collaborative efforts between me and the rest of the crew~<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">New Jersey：</span><br>
Phew... Well, no harm no foul if that's all you saw. The plan's still in motion as long as you didn't see the itinerary~<br>
...Actually, I had a little surprise prepared for you during dinner.<br>
Even though we didn't get to go to the burger joint, it should still be fine doing it here.<br>
Honey, close your eyes... and then– open your mouth!<br>
Just like that~ No peeking, okay?<br>
<br>
I hear the rustling of fabric, and then a faint fragrance reaches the tip of my nose.<br>
Something soft brushes against my lips, and the juicy sweetness of fruit blooms between my teeth.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">New Jersey：</span><br>
Heehee. You can open your eyes now, honey~!<br>
Special surprise delivery complete~ The candy I just gave you was a specialty shipped straight from the Eagle Union. My favorite kind, actually. You can't get these from Akashi's place, you know?<br>
So, what'd you think?<br>
Heehee. As long as you like it~ Also, this candy has special ingredients to relieve fatigue and lift your spirits!<br>
Now, you'll be ready for the FINAL final leg of our date– our evening activities!<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Wait... evening activities?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">New Jersey：</span><br>
That's right! A date can only be considered comprehensive if it fills up the entire day, so I've got stuff planned for tonight as well!<br>
It's almost time to get going, honey! Let's go ride the Ferris wheel!<br>
The scenery at the top is breathtaking!<br>
<br>
Without giving me a chance to respond, or perhaps, already knowing how I'd respond, New Jersey stood up, took my hand, and started to run out of the restaurant.<br>
...Fortunately, I already paid the bill in advance.<br>

A Star For Your Dreams<br>
The sea and sky alike are vast, black expanses before my eyes.<br>
There is neither wind nor sound here, as if the hands of time cannot reach this place.<br>
In search of a way out, I follow along this silent beach until—<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Shinano ：</span><br>
This one has finally found you.<br>
<br>
As a familiar figure graces me with her presence, frozen time seems to thaw and flow once more.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Shinano ：</span><br>
It would appear... that you have entered this one's dreams yet again by mistake…<br>
And not the most scenic one either, at that.<br>
<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项1：Are we in your nightmare?</span>'''''<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Shinano ：</span><br>
Nightmare? This one would not call it such.<br>
Among all the fragments one has seen… this hardly qualifies as a nightmare.<br>
Moreover, now that you are here… perhaps, one could even call it a paradise now?<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Well, I'm certainly relieved if it's not a nightmare.<br>
<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项1：(Lie down in the sand)</span>'''''<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项2：(Sit down beside Shinano)</span>'''''<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Shinano ：</span><br>
You are easygoing as ever, Commander.<br>
You are not going to ask why this one would call this dream a paradise?<br>
<br>
Shinano slowly leans towards me as she speaks.<br>
Even though I'm not sure my senses should be working in a dream, I can clearly smell her faint fragrance.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Shinano ：</span><br>
This is a dreamland in which time does not flow. No matter how long you stay here, nothing will ever change.<br>
Had this one failed to find you, you might have been swallowed up by this place, lost forever to the immutable darkness…<br>
Are you afraid of such a possibility, Commander?<br>
<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项1：What about you? Does it scare you, Shinano?</span>'''''<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项2：Nope, because I know you're here.</span>'''''<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Shinano ：</span><br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项1）</span>'''''Heehee… Scare, perhaps not, but…<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Shinano ：</span><br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项2）</span>'''''You place too much faith in this one's capabilities, but…<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Shinano ：</span><br>
Given that time and change do not exist here, the two of us would forever remain as when we first met.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
…I'm not sure I like the sound of that.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Shinano ：</span><br>
Indeed… we would be as two birds in a cage.<br>
But at this moment, even this cage can be its own little paradise…<br>
With you at my side… perhaps even another eternity or two here is not such a bad thing…<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Wait, so if I'm understanding this right… Had I not shown up, you would've been stuck here forever by yourself?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Shinano ：</span><br>
Indeed. This one would continue to wait here… until you came to awaken me.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
…...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Shinano ：</span><br>
Heehee~ Actually, all this talk of cages and eternity… was simply meant to scare you.<br>
Worry not. Over such a long span of time, this one has made quite some progress.<br>
Though this one still lacks complete mastery over dreams, one has picked up a few small tricks over time.<br>
For example…<br>
<br>
Shinano extends her arm and gestures at the dreary, lifeless sky above us.<br>
She points once, then again, and along with her movements, the firmament comes to life with one, two, no, countless stars.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
A lightless ocean, dispelled by a sea of stars… Is this the power that can change dreams?<br>
If so, then why don't you––<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Shinano ：</span><br>
Why did this one not use it earlier, is what you wanted to ask, yes?<br>
Heehee. Because, everything has changed…<br>
By oneself, this one would not have minded continuing to go along with the flow…<br>
But now that you are here, the very world itself has taken on an entirely different meaning…<br>
After all, this one wishes for you to see the stars.<br>
Because in this one's eyes… you are just like this starlight…<br>
<br>
I feel strands of silvery hair brush against my nose.<br>
All words between us are eclipsed.<br>
Although this world is infinitely vast, there is only enough room for two people. Although this world is infinitely small, there is enough room for countless twinkling stars.<br>
Ever so gradually, the dark sea ebbs and flows.<br>
The flowing water washes away time, bringing nothing yet taking nothing… until in this dreamscape, even meaning becomes meaningless.<br>
All until the stars and waves merge into one, coalescing into a single entity along with dreams and reality – with her by my side.<br>

Eyes That Long For Rain<br>
After a long day of work, I decide on a whim to head to an al fresco restaurant.<br>
However, the patio area, usually a terrific spot for enjoying the night view, displays nothing but ill omens–<br>
Because the dark rainclouds gathering in the illuminated night sky are clamoring for a rainstorm.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">？？？：</span><br>
Commander? What are you doing out here in this terrible weather?<br>
<br>
Only once I hear her voice do I realize that Ägir has approached me from my blind spot.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Uhh, guess I kinda came here on a whim?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ägir：</span><br>
What a whimsical answer. But since you're here, wanna go for a drink? Beer here's top-notch.<br>
<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项1：I'm not sure that's legal…</span>'''''<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项2：Sorry, I can't really think straight when I drink…</span>'''''<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项3：Don't mind if I do!</span>'''''<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ägir：</span><br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项1）</span>'''''…Huh? You really know how to pull a girl's leg, Commander.<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项1）</span>'''''But... it works out that I was also joking. I did say beer, but it's actually just a specially-blended malt-flavored beverage.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ägir：</span><br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项2）</span>'''''Do you really need to do that much straight-thinking in your private life? You that straight-laced?<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项2）</span>'''''But, no need to worry about that. I did say beer, but it's actually just a specially-blended malt-flavored beverage.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ägir：</span><br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项3）</span>'''''Now that's what I wanna hear!<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项3）</span>'''''—Oh, just so you know, I did say beer, but it's actually just a specially-blended malt-flavored beverage.<br>
<br>
She comes back with a stein of amber-colored beverage and carefully sits down next to me.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
By the way, Ägir, why are you here by yourself?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ägir：</span><br>
Just wanted to find a nice spot where I could appreciate the more violent side of the sea, y'know? Uhh… I guess you could also say it was on a whim, just like you.<br>
<br>
As we chat, the raindrops start to fall.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ägir：</span><br>
Wanna head inside? Wouldn't want you getting sick. It'd be bad for operational effectiveness and all that.<br>
…What are you staring at me for?<br>
<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项1：What am I going to do if YOU end up catching a cold?</span>'''''<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ägir：</span><br>
Hmph. As if the god of the untamed seas could catch a cold from a little splash of water.<br>
Besides, nothing fills me with anticipation more than the prospect of having the rain wash away my fatigue.<br>
<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项1：If you want, we can go get soaked in the rain together.</span>'''''<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ägir：</span><br>
T-together…?! Wh-what are you, stupid?!<br>
…Even if you're just trying to pique my curiosity, that's out of the question!<br>
…Okay, I know. Let's go take shelter from the rain together instead!<br>
<br>
Separated only by a thin panel of glass, the worlds within and without the restaurant already could not be further apart.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ägir：</span><br>
…You know, it's nice to be able to enjoy the rain like this every now and then.<br>
<br>
Ägir points outside the window. Heavy raindrops prance on strong winds, whipping up a thick haze.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ägir：</span><br>
See? This is when the ocean is most dangerous, but there's also a certain beauty and allure to that.<br>
<br>
Her golden eyes stare unblinkingly at the distant sea horizon, the words on her lips sounding like vague murmurs.<br>
Beads of water trickle from the ends of her rain-mottled hair, trickling down her cheeks and along her slender neck.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ägir：</span><br>
Commander?<br>
<br>
And now, I see my reflection in those golden eyes.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ägir：</span><br>
Hahaha! Caught you staring. What, you enraptured by my appearance?<br>
<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项1：Guilty as charged.</span>'''''<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项2：Indeed, I was indeed captivated.</span>'''''<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项3：The moon sure is beautiful tonight.</span>'''''<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ägir：</span><br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项1）</span>'''''Hwuh?! Y-you actually just came out and admitted it?!<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项1）</span>'''''…Hmph.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ägir：</span><br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项2）</span>'''''Hwuh?! Y-you actually just came out and admitted it?!<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项2）</span>'''''…Hmph.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ägir：</span><br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项3）</span>'''''…The moon? What moon? Behind all these thick clouds–<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项3）</span>'''''AH! W-wait, that's that Sakuran expression, isn't it?!<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项3）</span>'''''Y-you…! Hmph!<br>
<br>
She adjusts her position in her seat a few times, as if fidgeting in embarrassment.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Your reaction just now is certainly worthy of study. Very interesting.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ägir：</span><br>
Hey! Watch your mouth, or I'll bite it off!<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
I–<br>
<br>
Just as I'm about to retort, my field of view suddenly shrinks… a lot.<br>
I feel a warmth against my lips, then taste something faintly malty, and then… there's a sharp, stinging sensation.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Ow!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ägir：</span><br>
Hmph! Don't say I didn't warn you!<br>
Consider this your punishment… a brand left by the god of the deeps!<br>
<br>
She raises her glass, her golden eyes haloed softly by the amber liquid.<br>
Beyond our little sanctuary, the rain continues to fall.<br>

Special Maintenance<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Kearsarge：</span><br>
According to the itinerary uploaded to the database, there are no critical tasks in the upcoming few days. In other words, a rare bit of free time.<br>
Therefore, I do hope that the Commander will assist me with routine database and equipment maintenance tomorrow.<br>
<br>
Port – Office<br>
Kearsarge, her eyes half-closed, connects herself to the maintenance terminal, and the energy pipelines slowly begin to flow with fluorescent lights.<br>
The maintenance room is almost completely silent, save for the faint hum of the machinery and the sound of our breaths.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
(Judging by her status… maintenance is proceeding smoothly and should be done pretty soon?)<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Kearsarge：</span><br>
…Commander.<br>
Do you think that If two people spend time together in silence… such a behavior could also be considered a "date"?<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Uhh, if that's something they both enjoy, I don't see why it wouldn't c– …Huh?<br>
<br>
It takes a second for her words to click, but it's clear that Kearsarge is talking about us.<br>
I have no idea when she disconnected herself from the pipelines, but there she is, looking at me quietly.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Kearsarge：</span><br>
Commander, maintenance is complete.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Err, hope I could help?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Kearsarge：</span><br>
Of course. Though I already know the entire procedure by heart, accidents often happen during such times.<br>
As such, I can only trust you to be able to take over and deal with any emergencies.<br>
<br>
The data-light flowing through her violet eyes gradually fades, replaced by a focused gaze.<br>
Those usually calm and rational eyes now seem to swim with a soft glow.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Kearsarge：</span><br>
The Commander's vital signs are rising… Were you surprised that a question came up about "dating"?<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
It just took me a while to connect the dots. Is this why you asked me to help with your maintenance?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Kearsarge：</span><br>
According to data available in the database, working together towards a common goal is one of the most effective ways of enhancing intimacy.<br>
Of course, assuming that you see what we did together as a "date", I can update and synchronize my database accordingly.<br>
But if that is not the case… my definitions are in need of more clarity.<br>
Though, now that I have gathered the relevant answers, let us move on to the next step.<br>
Commander, do you have any other plans?<br>
The opportunity to have multiple "dates" consecutively is extremely rare, and as such, I would like to gather additional data.<br>
Assuming you are not opposed, I am willing to do anything you see appropriate.<br>
Though before that, Commander, I would like you to take my hand first.<br>
<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项1：Does this help you gather data?</span>'''''<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项2：Sure, I can do that.</span>'''''<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项1）</span>'''''Does this help you gather data?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Kearsarge：</span><br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项1）</span>'''''No, that was simply an excuse.<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项1）</span>'''''I simply wanted to get you to carry out the action.<br>

'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项2）</span>'''''Sure, I can do that.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Kearsarge：</span><br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项2）</span>'''''Contact circuit activation confirmed… verifying data.<br>
<br>
Kearsarge tilts her head slightly, looking down at our joined hands.<br>
Her knuckles slightly tighten, her fingers rubbing against mine with a bit more force as if probing something…<br>
Though her palm is cold, there's something… oddly reassuring about it.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Kearsarge：</span><br>
According to the database, this is effective at reducing awkwardness between two parties more quickly during a date scenario.<br>
For me, this is a new and unprecedented experience.<br>
Though this was just supposed to be routine maintenance, it has instead become a joyous thing with you here.<br>
Perhaps, this is the true significance of "dating"…<br>
<br>
Kearsarge nods thoughtfully for a spell, but suddenly frowns as if realizing something.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Kearsarge：</span><br>
Commander, judging from the data collected by the vital signs monitor, your emotional fluctuations are not strong enough.<br>
Database analysis suggests that you should be in high spirits induced by happiness at this very moment.<br>
<br>
Kearsarge squeezes my hand tighter, as if that would somehow yield more data.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Kearsarge：</span><br>
Do not worry, Commander. It was you who watched over me during my maintenance.<br>
As such, please allow me to return the favor and perform your inspection and maintenance.<br>
<br>
As she speaks, her grip on my hand gets tighter… and tighter.<br>
I can only smile helplessly – looks like there's no avoiding today's "special maintenance".<br>
