SP Amagi<br>
<br>
Morning Dreamscape<br>
The warm sunlight pouring through the window painted an idyllic scenery in front of me.<br>
While my consciousness was still floating about lazily, I was snapped back to reality by the sound of conversation coming from the kitchen.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">???：</span><br>
Would you believe what that woman said to me, dear sister? How terribly rude of her!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">??：</span><br>
Oh my...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">???：</span><br>
I was able to resolve the little problem I had with the Eagle Union thanks to your help, but things haven't been any less troublesome since then...<br>
And I'm not so lacking in self-awareness as to trouble the Commander over it!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">??：</span><br>
Now now, Akagi, there's no need to get so worked up... This time, why not try to talk things through instead of resorting to fighting...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">???：</span><br>
Not again with that "kiss and make up" deal...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">??：</span><br>
I'm sure you and Kaga will learn to get along just fine. Hehe~<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">???：</span><br>
......Fiiiine.<br>
Oh no, I need to get to the meeting soon... I wonder if the Commander is still asleep?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">??：</span><br>
Please don't disturb the Commander's rest. Last night's work was arduous after all.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">???：</span><br>
If you say so, dear sister...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">??：</span><br>
There's no need to pout. Go on now, don't keep Kaga and the others waiting.<br>
<br>
.........<br>
I remember now. Today was supposed to be my day off, and––<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Amagi：</span><br>
Did the miso soup go cold...?<br>
<br>
Amagi, who had prepared a late breakfast, checked in on me with worry in her voice.<br>
Apparently, I had overslept and missed the time I was supposed to have breakfast with Akagi and Amagi.<br>
To alleviate her concern, I dug into the savory miso soup and the carefully crafted meal.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Amagi：</span><br>
Ehehe, I'm glad it's to your liking, Commander.<br>
I know you've been quite busy recently, so I was wondering if you'd like me to do more to tend to your health.<br>
Otherwise, you'll be hearing an awful lot of Akagi's grumbling every day. Just a friendly word of advice from your local Amagi~<br>
<br>
Grumbling? Knowing Akagi... she'd make me take time off, forcibly if need be.<br>
But, she has a point. I can't have Amagi of all people worrying about my health...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Amagi：</span><br>
I did promise to take care of myself, but my promise doesn't end with my own health. Hehe~<br>
Come to think of it, since you do have the day off... Let's take advantage of the opportunity and have a little outing.<br>
Of course, if you're feeling too tired, you should head back and get some more sleep.<br>
<br>
I had no other plans for the day, so heading out for a stroll sounded like a good idea.<br>
More importantly...<br>
<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项1："How are you doing, Amagi?"</span>'''''<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Amagi：</span><br>
Hehe, are you worried about me? I'm doing just fine.<br>
As you can see, there's nothing for you to worry about, Commander. Here~<br>
...Say "ahh"~<br>
<br>
Amagi gingerly brought a piece of kawashi mochi to my lips.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Amagi：</span><br>
...These might look a bit like Manjuus, but I assure you, they're quite delicious. Hehe~<br>
Commander, if you like the taste, you're welcome to have more~<br>
<br>
After finishing the food, Amagi and I tidied the room up, after which I accompanied her on the sofa.<br>
After all the life-or-death decisions I've had to make on the battlefield, moments like these are like a dream come true...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Amagi：</span><br>
Mm... Being able to spend my days with Akagi, stay by your side, and enjoy this peace... Indeed, it is a bit like a "dream," isn't it?<br>
Even such a distant, blissful dream... will surely come to fruition one day, as long as that's what you desire. Right, Commander?<br>
Understand our past, and trascend fate. Forge new bonds, and create a new history...<br>
<br>
Her ephemeral presence felt so weighty over my shoulder.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Amagi：</span><br>
Please don't forget, Commander.<br>
May all your dreams come true.<br>
After all, that is something only "people" can do, not Cubes...<br>

SP Laffey<br>
<br>
A Nappy Place<br>
Zzz...<br>
Zzz... Zzzzz.... Zzzzzzzzz...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">？？？：</span><br>
Commander...<br>
Wakey wakey... It's time for work...<br>
<br>
"Owch!"<br>
A pair of fingers pinched my cheek, urging me to wake up. I opened my eyes to see who did it.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Laffey：</span><br>
Commander... You always sleep like a log... Poke poke...<br>
<br>
In front of me was Laffey, prodding me with her index finger to make sure I was awake.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Laffey：</span><br>
There... You up now?<br>
<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项1："I'm up."</span>'''''<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项2："5 more minutes..."</span>'''''<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Laffey：</span><br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项1）</span>'''''Good... Then I'm gonna take a nap...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Laffey：</span><br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项2）</span>'''''C'mon, you've got work to do...<br>
<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项2）</span>'''''She pinched my cheek a second time, forcing me to get up anyway.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Laffey：</span><br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项2）</span>'''''There we go... Now it's Laffey's turn... to take a nap...<br>
<br>
She did so immediately, flopping onto the couch and getting ready to go to dreamland.<br>
Suddenly, I remembered why she was in my office to begin with...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Laffey：</span><br>
Commander, do you know a good nap spot...?<br>
I'm looking for a new cozy place... So if you know any...<br>
<br>
A niche club had sprung up at the port. The Napping Club. For shipgirls who like taking naps. Quite self-explanatory.<br>
"Why are you looking for a new one? I thought you already napped in the school yard, the library, or the theater room?"<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Laffey：</span><br>
Yeah, but I want a spot all to myself...<br>
Which is why I'm wondering if you had any ideas...<br>
<br>
"Hmm... Let me think..."<br>
I thought long and hard, but couldn't come up with anything. And that's how we wound up in this scenario.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Laffey：</span><br>
Zzzzz...<br>
<br>
Although there was nothing wrong with Laffey coming to my office for a nap, I couldn't just let her lie here forever.<br>
Out of the blue, there was a knock on the door.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Nowaki：</span><br>
Zzz... So this is where she went off to...?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Nicholas：</span><br>
Coming in, don't mind me...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Surcouf：</span><br>
Mrmhh... Zzzzz...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Shinano ：</span><br>
......<br>
<br>
A small horde of sleepy invaders marched into my office. The Napping Club had come for a surprise visit.<br>
Most likely, Nowaki had figured out this is where Laffey was through blind luck, and jumped to the conclusion that this is their new napping spot.<br>
It was too late to turn them away, so I decided to just put up with a room full of nappers just for today...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Laffey：</span><br>
Ugh... It's time to wake up...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Nowaki：</span><br>
Hmh...? What is it, Laffey...?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Nicholas：</span><br>
Geesh... I'm trying to get some sleep here... *yaaawn*...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Surcouf：</span><br>
Hrm? What the... How'd we end up in here?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Laffey：</span><br>
Sorry, guys... This office is only big enough for me... The commander can't work with you all around...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Shinano ：</span><br>
...I see... I do apologize...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Laffey：</span><br>
Ugh... It's time to wake up...<br>
<br>
The noise must've woken Laffey. She began nudging all the nappers, driving them out of my office one by one.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Laffey：</span><br>
Finally... Now I can get some peace and quiet... *yaaawn*...<br>
Night night... Zzzzz...<br>
<br>
Laffey seemed set on making this her official new napping spot. I had little choice but to accept it.<br>
That being the case, the least I could do was cover her with something so she doesn't catch a cold. I took my coat and carefully tucked her in.<br>

<br>
SP Bismarck<br>
<br>
While the Coffee is Hot<br>
There I stood, at the door to the Iron Blood's workshop. The sounds of hammering and bolting were coming from inside.<br>
Upon opening the door, I was greeted by the voice of a woman surrounded by a mountain of machine parts and metal materials.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Bismarck：</span><br>
Who might that be? Ah, let me guess...<br>
You didn't introduce yourself at once, so you can't be U-556. Your footsteps didn't sound like Zeppelin's or Gneisenau's either.<br>
You've come alone, and quite late in the evening at that. That leaves but one candidate...<br>
Welcome, Commander. My hands are full at the moment, but feel free to make yourself comfortable.<br>
<br>
She was the source of the sounds. It seemed she was building something.<br>
Deciding to stick around, I sat on a chair a fair distance from her so I wouldn't get in the way.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Rigging：</span><br>
GRRRRGGHH!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Bismarck：</span><br>
Take it easy. The commander's not a threat. There, good boy.<br>
Hmm. It needs some fine-tuning. I'll talk to Friedrich about that later...<br>
<br>
Bismarck decided it was time for a break. She put down her tools, stood up, and walked over to a coffeemaker placed in a corner of the room. She took out two paper cups.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Bismarck：</span><br>
Care for some coffee? It's not the best, but it's an adequate amenity for a workshop.<br>
I prefer mine black, but if you'd like a bit of sugar or creamer, just tell me.<br>
...It's done. Here you go.<br>
Last refill now. We don't want to have too much, or it'll affect our performance in the office tomorrow.<br>
Now... To what do I owe the pleasure? I'd imagine you have better things to do at this hour.<br>
<br>
The scent of freshly-ground coffee beans filled the air. I took in the smell as I thought about the answer to her question.<br>
"There are two reasons. The first is simple – I'm seeing what's up around the port."<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Bismarck：</span><br>
Seeing what's up, you say? Not much, on the whole.<br>
Although, it's true the Iron Blood is a faction with many secrets. If I were you, I'd regularly check in and have a look around too.<br>
Me especially, seeing as I am the leader of the Iron Blood. The woman with the permanent pokerface. She has got to be planning something...<br>
Yes... Planning what to have for dinner, perhaps.<br>
<br>
She downplayed it as a joke, although I had no reason to believe she meant the first half seriously in the first place.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Bismarck：</span><br>
Being a leader, someone who looks after those under their command, is quite tiring.<br>
I'm sure you know what it's like, Commander. From the thrill of issuing an order, to the doubt when you lack information crucial to making an informed decision...<br>
And in my case... The emptiness of when you're losing sight of yourself... "Am I Bismarck, or am I the Iron Blood's flagship?"<br>
<br>
Bismarck was a leader with a strict sense of duty that seemed to cause her endless woe and doubt...<br>
But, this strict sense of duty is also what fueled her desire to do everything she could for humanity, regardless of the consequences for herself.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Bismarck：</span><br>
Naturally, I don't want to forget myself. That is why I created this place solely for myself. A place where I can just create and study.<br>
I don't know what your mind conjures up when it thinks "Bismarck." But if you wonder about me...<br>
Then this place where you stand, what you see around you, this person before you now... is the answer.<br>
<br>
Putting down her cup on the work table, the Iron Blood leader clad in a black uniform turned to face me.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Bismarck：</span><br>
I have you to thank for this. For letting me be myself.<br>
I'm sure U-556, Tirpitz, and all my Iron Blood comrades are grateful for it as well.<br>
So, thank you, Commander. Thank you for everything, always.<br>
<br>
Bismarck smiled at me. It was the first time I'd seen her smile from the heart, as solely herself.<br>
It felt like I'd manage to ease the burden on her shoulders, even if only a little bit, by talking to her today.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Bismarck：</span><br>
...Sorry, I just realized I've been going on and on about myself.<br>
You said you had two reasons for coming here. What's the other?<br>
<br>
I reached into my pocket, took out two opera tickets, and presented them to her.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Bismarck：</span><br>
Ahah. I see... It's starting pretty soon, I see.<br>
Perfect timing. I did say this would be our last cup of coffee for the evening, after all.<br>
<br>
And what great coffee it was. It had such a supple, yet clean aftertaste.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Bismarck：</span><br>
Just asking, but... Would you say I should stick to black garments for the opera?<br>
