Fu Shun's Great Adventure<br>
<br>
Chapter 1 - Old Warehouse Treasure Hunt<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Fu Shun：</span><br>
So this is the place you were talking about? Hehehe, I'm sure there's plenty of nice stuff in here!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Tai Yuan：</span><br>
Umm... Should we really go inside without the commander's permission...?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Fu Shun：</span><br>
It's fine! The padlock is all rusted up anyway, so I'm sure nobody will care!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Tai Yuan：</span><br>
I think it's just been worn down over time...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Fu Shun：</span><br>
Look, the warehouse needs to be cleaned regularly, right? We're just doing some "cleaning" on the commander's behalf! Besides, we might find some good books in there!<br>
I mean, you love books, don't you?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Tai Yuan：</span><br>
Good... books?! W-well, it's not like I'm NOT interested...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Fu Shun：</span><br>
Then let's go treasure hunting! I'll look around here, you go search over there!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Tai Yuan：</span><br>
Oh geez... Sorry, warehouse! We're just cleaning, that's all!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Fu Shun：</span><br>
*Cough, cough!* ...It's so dusty in here...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Tai Yuan：</span><br>
*Cough, cough!* ...I found a bunch of hard-to-read books...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Fu Shun：</span><br>
Yeah... I found piles of components, dunno what they're used for...<br>
Oh, Tai Yuan! Come here! Look what I found!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Tai Yuan：</span><br>
I-isn't that a...<br>

<br>
Chapter 2 - Can You Fix It?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Fu Shun：</span><br>
Chang Chun, look at this!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Chang Chun：</span><br>
Oh wow... You actually went to that old warehouse, huh...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Fu Shun：</span><br>
Hm? Did you say something?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Chang Chun：</span><br>
No, nothing! ...So, what did you find?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Fu Shun：</span><br>
Alright, don't be shocked, now... Ta-dah!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Chang Chun：</span><br>
Isn't that a... handheld game console?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Fu Shun：</span><br>
I knew you'd recognize it!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Chang Chun：</span><br>
Looks pretty ancient, though... And it's... Huh? It won't open.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Fu Shun：</span><br>
Aw... But don't you think it's cool? I wonder what games you can play on it!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Chang Chun：</span><br>
Not really...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Fu Shun：</span><br>
You don't think it's cool?!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Chang Chun：</span><br>
But I know a certain gamer you can ask about what games it has!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Long Island：</span><br>
Isn't that a... handheld?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Fu Shun：</span><br>
Chang Chun said you could tell me more about it!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Long Island：</span><br>
Heheheh... I'm not used to being complimented in that sorta way...<br>
Really though, what is this thing... I've never seen anything like this before...<br>
This is pretty hipster even for a hardcore gamer like me... It might actually be homemade...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Fu Shun：</span><br>
What?! You don't know what it is either?!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Long Island：</span><br>
Sorry to say, but you'll need to call in a pro for this one...<br>

Chapter 3 - The Hero's Journey Begins<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">{{AF|Akashi}}：</span><br>
Welcome, nya~ Oh? What brings you here, nya? Shopping for supplies, nya?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Fu Shun：</span><br>
So this is the legendary Shop... There are a lot of interesting-looking things!<br>
...Wait, no no no, I'm not here for supplies! Akashi, could you examine this for me?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">{{AF|Akashi}}：</span><br>
A game console, nya?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Fu Shun：</span><br>
Yeah, apparently! Long Island said you're the best at repairs, ever!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">{{AF|Akashi}}：</span><br>
F-fine, nya... Just this one time I'll examine it for free, nya.<br>
Unya... This is a pretty old model, nya... First we'll fix this... then replace this...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Fu Shun：</span><br>
Whoa...!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">{{AF|Akashi}}：</span><br>
Phew... It's fixed, nya!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Fu Shun：</span><br>
Awesome! You're amazing, Akashi!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">{{AF|Akashi}}：</span><br>
It took some time to replace the old parts, but now it should be fine, nya~<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Fu Shun：</span><br>
I knew I could count on you!<br>
Chang Chun~ I got the handheld fixed~ Wanna play some games?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Chang Chun：</span><br>
You actually managed to get it fixed...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Fu Shun：</span><br>
I know, right! Now let's power it up!<br>
Let's see... Right, enter name... I'll go with... F-u-s-h-u-n...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Chang Chun：</span><br>
You're one of those people that use their real name...?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Fu Shun：</span><br>
Yep! I guess it's more immersive that way, you know?<br>
Here we go! The hero, Fu Shun, has set off on her journey to save the world!<br>

<br>
Chapter 4 - Then the World was at Peace...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Chang Chun：</span><br>
Get that guy! Attack him!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Fu Shun：</span><br>
I know! Here, have a taste of THIIIIIS!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Fu Shun & Chang Chun：</span><br>
Whoooa!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Fu Shun：</span><br>
Woohoo! The world has been saved!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Chang Chun：</span><br>
The graphics and the controls are as retro as you'd expect... but it's surprisingly fun to play...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Fu Shun：</span><br>
Hey, what's this? A scoreboard?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Chang Chun：</span><br>
Huh? There's another name there besides yours...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Fu Shun：</span><br>
I think it says... A-n-s-h-a...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Chang Chun：</span><br>
D-do you think that's...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">An Shan：</span><br>
There you are, Fu Shun! You've been going around causing trouble again, haven't you?!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Fu Shun：</span><br>
Oh crap! An Shan?!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">An Shan：</span><br>
Not only did you break the padlock to the warehouse, you even made a big mess inside!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Fu Shun：</span><br>
Yikes, let's get outta-<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">An Shan：</span><br>
You're not going anywhere! And you, Chang Chun! You coaxed her into doing it, didn't you?!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Chang Chun：</span><br>
*Gulp*...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">An Shan：</span><br>
Stay right where you are! You're going to get a severe...<br>
...Hm? Wait, i-isn't this that old...?!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Fu Shun：</span><br>
We found it in the warehouse. It was broken, but Akashi fixed it for me!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">An Shan：</span><br>
S-she fixed it...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Chang Chun：</span><br>
That other name we saw on the scoreboard... wasn't that...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">An Shan：</span><br>
BE QUIET! As I was saying: you're both going to get a severe scolding today!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Fu Shun：</span><br>
Eeek... An Shan's scarier than the final boss when she gets mad...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">An Shan：</span><br>
What was that?!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Fu Shun：</span><br>
N-nothing! I didn't say anything!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">An Shan：</span><br>
Also, I'll be seizing this console!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Fu Shun & Chang Chun：</span><br>
Whaaaat?!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">An Shan：</span><br>
Ahh, so nostalgic... I'm amazed someone was able to find it...<br>
It even has my save data from back then... Hehehehe...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Chang Chun：</span><br>
I knew it, that console was yours all along.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">An Shan：</span><br>
Waahh! Chang Chun?!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Fu Shun：</span><br>
Well what do you know~ An Shan is a gamer~<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">An Shan：</span><br>
You too?! How long have you been here?!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Tai Yuan：</span><br>
Aww, look at An Shan... She's adorable...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">An Shan：</span><br>
ALL of you are here?! Uhh... Look, um, it's not what you...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Chang Chun：</span><br>
Hey, it's fine, we were all kids once! Usually, people grow out of their old toys though, right, An Shan?♪<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Fu Shun：</span><br>
Heheheh~ Wouldn't it be more fun if we all play it together?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">An Shan：</span><br>
W-well, it can't be helped now... I guess we could...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Chang Chun：</span><br>
And so, the world was at peace again! And everyone lived happily ever after!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">An Shan：</span><br>
Hey! Don't try to wrap the story up like that!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Tai Yuan & Fu Shun & Chang Chun：</span><br>
Hahahahaha...<br>
