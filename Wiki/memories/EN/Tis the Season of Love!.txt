'Tis the Season of Love!<br>
<br>
1.The Season of Love is Here!<br>
A faint glow slowly seeps through my closed eyelids.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Glasgow：</span><br>
—Wake up... Hurry, c’mon!<br>
<br>
I can hear a girl’s voice in my ears... but I’m not sure where it’s coming from...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Glasgow：</span><br>
—Isn’t it about time... ye moved yer arse already?!<br>
Jeez! How long did you plan to stay in bed? You’re going to be late if you don’t hurry it up!<br>
<br>
I rub my still-sleepy eyes and let out a great yawn. Beside me was the maid, Glasgow, with a dissatisfied frown on her face.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Glasgow：</span><br>
The breakfast that Newcastle painstakingly prepared for you is going to go cold! Hurry up and get out of bed already!<br>
<br>
Why the heck is she so anxious anyway? ...My eyes suddenly dart towards the clock.<br>
...Uhh, is this thing broken? I mean, it’s saying that I’m so late I wouldn’t even have time to get ready.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Glasgow：</span><br>
O’course it ain’t broken! We’re all gonna be late ‘cause of you!<br>
<br>
Holy cow! She wasn’t kidding! I practically trip over the sheets as I scramble out of bed, grabbing whatever I can before I bolt toward the academy.<br>
—Academy, Cherry Tree Walkway<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Glasgow：</span><br>
Hurry! The morning bell’s about to ring!<br>
<br>
I dash through the academy gates, my chest on fire from gasping for breath. But I’m almost there... to the classroom...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Glasgow：</span><br>
You’re always like this, cutting it close every day. If I didn’t have to wait for you, I’d never even get close to being late... Hmph.<br>
H-hey! Didn’t I tell you to treat me like a normal classmate when we’re outside?<br>
Even though I’m your family maid, at school, we’re just ordinary classmates! Nod if you understand!<br>
<br>
I nod, but Glasgow turns her chin away from me, her cheeks puffed out pridefully.<br>
Now that I think about it, the relationship between the two of us hasn’t really changed all this time, and moments like this have become fairly commonplace.<br>
However, if things were to continue just like this... would either of us be satisfied?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Glasgow：</span><br>
We made it! ...Good grief, you’d better get up on your own tomorrow. I’ll go check on you before I head out!<br>
<br>
—Spring, the season of love.<br>
At times, she is a maid in service in someone’s service. At other times, she is a classmate from the same school.<br>
This is the heart-throbbing love story of Glasgow, a girl who isn’t at all straightforward with her feelings...<br>

<br>
2.We’re Not Like That!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Glasgow：</span><br>
Phew... At least we managed to make it today.<br>
(How could someone be so consistently late for school...? The dolt would’ve been held back by now if it wasn’t for me!)<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ardent：</span><br>
Good morning! You two always make the grandest entrances to school. Just seeing it makes me a little jealous~<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Glasgow：</span><br>
A-Ardent?! How long have ye been here?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ardent：</span><br>
Hmm~ Since you two first ran inside the gates? Don’t worry, I won’t spill the beans on you two~<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Glasgow：</span><br>
Wh-what?! W-we’re not like that! There’s nothin’ o’that sort g-going on between us!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Edinburgh：</span><br>
Are you sure you should be denying it that emphatically? You might hurt the feelings of the person right next to you.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Glorious：</span><br>
R-right... Glasgow, it probably wouldn’t hurt to be a little nicer...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ardent：</span><br>
Even if she did act a bit nicer, I don’t think she’d be any more honest with herself. I can’t help but to get a little worried from watching her...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Glasgow：</span><br>
Nobody asked all of you to be so nosy anyway! Hmph!<br>
(I don’t care what the people around me say. I just want to be myself. It’s not like I’m sensitive about this!)<br>
(It’s not my fault that a certain someone can’t live without me, so why are they getting all these weird ideas?!)<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Acasta：</span><br>
Glasgow... your face is beet red again... is something wrong?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Edinburgh：</span><br>
Her innocence is what makes her charming... as an outside observer, that is~<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Glorious：</span><br>
As members of the Royal Navy, we must approach this matter with grace and—<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Glasgow：</span><br>
That’s enough of this gossiping! Hurry back to your seats already; class is about to start.<br>
<br>
—Ding dong, ding dong!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Edinburgh：</span><br>
Woah, talk about slick timing!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Acasta：</span><br>
I’m starting to get a bit sleepy...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Glorious：</span><br>
We shall meet again during break then—<br>
<br>
As the girls returned to their respective seats, Glasgow’s eyes met with those of the person from the earlier discussion.<br>
The person waved back with a smile, seemingly ignorant of everything that had transpired.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Glasgow：</span><br>
...Sigh, what a dense fellow.<br>
<br>
She turned her eyes away and gazed wistfully out the window.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Glasgow：</span><br>
...It’s all a misunderstanding anyway. The two of us will always have the same kind of relationship... just like now...<br>
It won’t ever change... I know it...<br>
<br>
Glasgow fantasized about returning the smile and waving back, but her shyness kept her frozen in place until the opportunity had passed.<br>

<br>
3.Mandarin Ducks?!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ranger：</span><br>
If everyone is in their seats, we’ll start the class. Good morning.<br>
<br>
—Good morning!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ranger：</span><br>
Mm, great. I’m glad to see everyone in high spirits today.<br>
Let’s jump straight into things. I know we just started off the semester, but we have a lot to get through.。<br>
I’m sure everyone has already noticed, but we haven’t even elected a class representative yet.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Glasgow：</span><br>
(Class rep, huh... Sounds like a major pain going around collecting everyone’s handouts...)<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ranger：</span><br>
I actually hoped to have two class representatives. Is anybody interested in running or nominating someone for the position?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Glasgow：</span><br>
(I already have my hands full cooking and cleaning, so I think I’ll pass...)<br>
<br>
Just as Glasgow muttered the words to herself, Ardent, who was seated in front of her, turned around to glance at her.<br>
And before she could process what was going on...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ardent：</span><br>
I have a nomination! There are two people in this class who are always together like a pair of Mandarin ducks, so I’m sure they’d be best for the job!<br>
<br>
Just as the words left Ardent’s lips...<br>
The eyes of the class turned towards the only two people she could’ve been referring to.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Glasgow：</span><br>
A-Ardent?! Wh-what in the world are ye talking about? Wh-who are ye callin’ Mandarin ducks?!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Edinburgh：</span><br>
It goes without saying... the two of them would make the most suitable duo.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Glasgow：</span><br>
Even you, Edinburgh?<br>
<br>
As the votes came in, it was almost certain that the two of them would become the class representatives.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ranger：</span><br>
I figured this was going to happen. You two both have a strong sense of responsibility, and you have my full support as your teacher.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Glasgow：</span><br>
H-how could this happen... Ugh...<br>
<br>
And thus, the two new class representatives would become known as the “Mandarin Duck Duo.”<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ranger：</span><br>
Glasgow, don’t be so down. There’s really not much to being a class rep other than some minor chores.<br>
<br>
As Chaser’s gentle encouragement reached Glasgow’s ears, the young girl’s eyes glanced towards her partner.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Glasgow：</span><br>
(Those eyes... must be thinking the same thing as I am. That’s not really what I’m worried about...)<br>
<br>
Thinking about what the future had in store, Glasgow let out an audible sigh.<br>

<br>
4.Your Face is Too Close!<br>
During break...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Glasgow：</span><br>
Sigh...<br>
<br>
Glasgow, having started her first errand as a class representative, was walking around with a stack of papers in her hands.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Glasgow：</span><br>
Ms. Chaser is such a liar... “Minor chores,” she said...<br>
And you... You just nodded along to whatever she told you to do. Are you sure you’re okay with this? You know the workload is only going to get more and more unreasonable...<br>
<br>
“...Should I not have?”<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Glasgow：</span><br>
You just go along with whatever people say... You’re always like this.<br>
<br>
“Need a hand?”<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Glasgow：</span><br>
N-no, I can manage on my own! I don’t need your help for something like this!<br>
Wh-what is it? “I can’t see in front of me?” ...Look, I don’t need your concern! As if I’d let something like that trip me up!<br>
<br>
Glasgow hastened her steps... The lively voices of other ships could be heard straight ahead.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Portland：</span><br>
Come back, Indyyyy~ I haven’t combed your hair yet~!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Indianapolis：</span><br>
You’re always sticking to me... If you don’t give me some personal space, I...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Portland：</span><br>
Ahhhhh~ You’re being so cold to me, Indy... But that side of you is suuuuper cute too~!<br>
<br>
Glasgow didn’t seem to notice the two sisters in front of her and continued her brisk pace.<br>
Portland’s gaze was affixed to her little sister, totally oblivious of the incoming Glasgow.<br>
At this rate, they were going to collide. Suddenly...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Glasgow：</span><br>
Eek!<br>
<br>
I hurriedly reached out to grab onto Glasgow’s shoulders to steer her away from trouble... but somehow ended up pinning her back against the wall.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Glasgow：</span><br>
Wh-what are you doing all of a sudden?!<br>
And... and... this position...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Indianapolis：</span><br>
...Sis, you almost crashed into Glasgow because you weren’t watching your steps...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Portland：</span><br>
Eh, really?! Wow, you’re right... I’m so sorry, I was just totally fixated on you, Indy!<br>
<br>
Portland stuck her tongue out and grinned goofily, while Indianapolis bowed politely.<br>
Glasgow continued to stand there blankly. She didn’t even see the others leaving, and her heart was about to fly out of her chest.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Glasgow：</span><br>
(What do I do, what do I do?! Even though it was an emergency, this is a kabedon... right out of one of those mangas...!)<br>
<br>
Though her head was spinning and her face was completely flushed, Glasgow managed to hold on to the handouts. The awkward silence was deafening.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Glasgow：</span><br>
Y-your face is too close! W-we need to hurry back to the classroom and pass these out!<br>
<br>
Upon those words, the two slowly peeled themselves away from the wall. Glasgow stepped away, her heart still pounding furiously.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ardent：</span><br>
...Oh my, that was passionate. Too bad those two are practically statues.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Edinburgh：</span><br>
Ardent, it’s not good to peep on others— Though I’m not really one to talk. Ahaha...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Glorious：</span><br>
Does it fall upon us to give them some extra motivation?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Acasta：</span><br>
Mm... I’m totally cheering for Glasgow...<br>

5.The Name... Is Glasgow<br>
After school...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ardent：</span><br>
I’m sorry, Glasgow!  Can you help me clean up the classroom today?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Glasgow：</span><br>
...You’re not up to something weird, are you?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Acasta：</span><br>
(Sh-she’s sharp...!)<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Edinburgh：</span><br>
There’s something we need to do, and it’s really serious! T-trust us, we’re telling the truth!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Glasgow：</span><br>
So you’re in on it too, Edinburgh? How suspicious... Now, I’m almost convinced the two of you are—<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ardent：</span><br>
Woahhh! We’re gonna be late if we don’t hurry up! Sorry, Glasgow, I swear I’ll make it up to you later!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Glasgow：</span><br>
Hey! Come back here! Tell me what’s going on—<br>
...Good grief. I’m going to cause trouble for Newcastle if I get back too late...<br>
<br>
“Need some help?”<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Glasgow：</span><br>
...No need. Just head back first and tell my sister I’m running late. Cleaning is my specialty, so I’ll be done in no time.<br>
(...Why do I feel so self-conscious? Is it all because of what happened earlier...?)<br>
<br>
Glasgow’s cheeks flared up again as she threw herself into her cleaning, her movements more agitated than normal. Her emotions were a mess, and she couldn’t figure out why.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Glasgow：</span><br>
(...Good grief! Even though I said to just leave without me... Why is that busybody waiting for me...?!)<br>
Hey, you! I said, I’m fine by myself, seriously!<br>
...Huh? There’s something inside the desk? Is it... a letter?<br>
<br>
The stationery was cutely adorned.<br>
She approached me and read the name of the sender.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Glasgow：</span><br>
The name.... is Glasgow. Where have I heard that name before...<br>
Eh? Ehhhhh?! What the heck is going on here?! I never wrote a letter like this— Hey, wait!<br>
<br>
I unsealed the letter and perused its contents — the raw, unspoken feelings of a girl who was painfully bad at expressing herself.<br>
——I love you. From, Glasgow.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Glasgow：</span><br>
Wait, no! This is a fake! I swear, Ardent and Edinburgh are behind this!<br>
I always knew they were up to no good! ...Seriously, this wasn’t me! Because I don’t like you at all!<br>
<br>
“I see... So it was fake...”<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Glasgow：</span><br>
...Huh?<br>
<br>
Glasgow seemed dumbfounded by this unexpected remark.<br>
In that moment, time seemed to stand still for the figures alone in the classroom, the orange light of the afternoon sun filtering in through the windows.<br>

6.Would You Still... Love Me?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Glasgow：</span><br>
I, I mean...<br>
<br>
Glasgow was shaken by the sudden question. It was a topic that the two of them normally avoided.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Glasgow：</span><br>
Wh-why are you acting like that anyway? It’s not like you at all...<br>
<br>
I gazed at Glasgow intently, as if peering into her soul.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Glasgow：</span><br>
Wait, we can’t...<br>
We... really can’t. We’re not just classmates... We’re also master and maid...<br>
And my personality is no good either... I don’t know how to treat you tenderly... or how to get close to your heart.<br>
<br>
“But I still love you, Glasgow.”<br>
Glasgow’s eyes opened wide in surprise upon hearing my confession.”<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Glasgow：</span><br>
Wh-what are ye saying?! I... I prefer for things to stay the way they are...<br>
If we got any closer... you’d just end up hating me!<br>
<br>
Glasgow tried to put down her cleaning tools and escape, but...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Glasgow：</span><br>
Ah, Master?!<br>
<br>
The master’s arms gently wrapped around the maid, like goal tape embracing an athlete for crossing the finish line.<br>
Unable to escape, Glasgow felt herself sinking into the passionate gaze of the person in front of her.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Glasgow：</span><br>
Master... Please... Let go of me...<br>
I don’t know if I am worthy of your love... I just know I’ll end up saying something cold...<br>
I don’t think... I can be any less ill-mannered...<br>
<br>
Despite her words, I continued to embrace her tightly as if to transmit to her the chorus of “I don’t care” throbbing within my chest...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Glasgow：</span><br>
Are you sure...? Are you sure... you want an uncute girl like me? Would you still... love me?<br>
<br>
I wiped the tears from Glasgow’s eyes, not knowing when they had formed. Looking straight into her moist eyes, I nodded slowly.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Glasgow：</span><br>
Master...<br>

(Ah... Master... is stroking my chin~)<br>
(......I must be dreaming... I’ve never been so happy...)<br>
<br>
Slowly, tenderly, our lips found each other, as if never having meant to be apart—<br>

<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Glasgow：</span><br>
...Geh?! Oh, Master?! Is something the matter?<br>
Oh, you’ve been calling for me, but I haven’t been responding? ...It, it’s nothing at all! I just had something on my mind...<br>
I, I’ll fulfill my duties as your secretary, so don’t you fret!<br>
<br>
I was a bit worried about how flustered she looked... But because the quality of her work was impeccable as ever, I decided not to say anything.<br>
Instead, I tell her not to stress herself out too much, and then return to my work.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Glasgow：</span><br>
(Haah... That scared me half to death! How could I let myself daydream in the middle of work...)<br>
(And that manga I borrowed from Chaser last night... “The Maid and the Master are Classmates!”... What an astounding work of art!)<br>
(But, I can’t allow myself to become mired in delusions just because of a manga...)<br>
<br>
Glasgow seems to be mumbling something while going through the materials related to the next operation.<br>
Maybe I’ve been overworking her... Perhaps it’d be a good idea to invite her out somewhere to get work off her mind...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Glasgow：</span><br>
(Ahh... If only things in real life could work out that nicely...)<br>
(On my next day off, I should take the initiative and ask the commander out on a date... No, I simply must!)<br>
(Then, I’ll be sure to be more gentle... and comforting. Ah, and then... “Suddenly, the wind blows—”)<br>
