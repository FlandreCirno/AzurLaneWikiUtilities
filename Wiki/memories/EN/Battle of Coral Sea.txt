          Not long ago, in a western sea... <br>
<br>
<br>

<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Enterprise：</span><br>
Radio silence protocols have been lifted. Urgent call from Enterprise to Hornet!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Hornet：</span><br>
Hornet here~! Go ahead!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Enterprise：</span><br>
We've been found out. Should we continue our mission?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Hornet：</span><br>
Coordinates were just a little off... but I think we can still do it!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Enterprise：</span><br>
Very good. Immediately destroy the enemy's patrol ship! All convoys, continue to protect Hornet! The mission will continue.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Hornet：</span><br>
It's finally time for me, Hornet, to show my stuff!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Enterprise：</span><br>
Of course. Only you would be able to complete such a risky mission! Haha!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Hornet：</span><br>
Fight! Fight for our fallen sisters! Fight for the land and sea burned by the war!<br>
This attack is filled with anguish and fury. Now is when we make our stand!<br>
For the Eagles! For freedom!<br>
B-25 Doolittle Squadron, attack!<br>
