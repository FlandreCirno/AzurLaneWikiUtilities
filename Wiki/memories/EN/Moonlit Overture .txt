<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Chicago：</span><br>
*Phew*... Looks like it's finally started to cool down a little bit tonight... It's way too humid and hot here, and the sun is oppressive as well. If not for this mission, I would have booked it long ago.<br>
I sure envy Astoria. Her class consists of only sisters, but over here, we have "allies," not just sisters. Well, it's not like I have anything against them...<br>
*Sigh*... Houston, how nice it'd be if you were here...<br>
Gah, this is no time to be getting sentimental. Australia went north to meet up with the others, so I am now temporarily in charge of the South Group. I have to set a good example, hehe.<br>
I just have to hang in there a bit longer. Tomorrow...<br>
<br>
(Chicago's thoughts were suddenly interrupted by the blaring of sirens.)<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Chicago：</span><br>
This is... an alert from Patterson?<br>
Impossible...! How could the Sakura Fleet show up here? Also, what's with this distance?! Savo Island's patrols should have picked them up on their radars...!<br>
<br>
(Suppressing her shock, she quickly went to message Bagley.)<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Chicago：</span><br>
Bagley, please come with me! We've got trouble!<br>
<br>
(In the distance, the horizon glowed with the embers of battle, as if a gaping maw had opened up in the night.)<br>

<br>
Though the enemies were not numerous, Chicago and Bagley found themselves outnumbered as they pressed forward. By the time they reached the enemy's main force, they had already sustained many injuries.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Chicago：</span><br>
You sure have some guts to attack with a force this small. I suppose this is what they mean when they talk about the Sakura Empire's fearsome valor.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">{{AF|Kako}}：</span><br>
A small fighting force is just what we need to carry out a surprise attack, is that not obvious? Or rather, should I say that your defenses were astoundingly weak? We had steeled ourselves for the worst, but...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Chicago：</span><br>
I hate to admit it, but you're right...<br>
<br>
After enduring countless air raids for several days in the harsh heat, their defenses had in fact been worn thin. But in the face of failure, these were meaningless excuses. Knowing this, Chicago simply bit her lip.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Chicago：</span><br>
But there's no point babbling on. Prepare yourself!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">{{AF|Kako}}：</span><br>
You will face Kako and Kinugasa of the Sakura Empire's 6th Fleet!<br>

<br>
After a desperate defense, Chicago managed to buy time for Bagley to escape. However, she was incapacitated by the concentrated fire of the enemy cruisers and had to retreat. Bagley, alone, was powerless to stop the advance of the Sakura ships.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">{{AF|Kinugasa}}：</span><br>
Even though they got away, this should be good enough, right? Doesn't seem like there are any more enemies in this area.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">{{AF|Kako}}：</span><br>
I suppose so. Since this is a fast fleet, we can outmaneuver our enemies even if they outgun us. Besides, Tenryuu's group isn't cut out for heavy fighting.<br>
This island is critical for us, so let's focus on clearing out any enemies that might be left.<br>
Besides, this airfield belonged to us in the first place.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">{{AF|Kinugasa}}：</span><br>
Yes, yes, I know. We should be concentrating our efforts on supporting Operation SN now, correct?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">{{AF|Kako}}：</span><br>
If you understand, then let's go moving. Choukai and the others have already begun to engage the enemies in the north, so we should join up as soon as possible.<br>

<br>
Apart from Chicago's South Group, the three sisters Astoria, Quincy, and Vincennes were assigned to the Eagle Union's North Fleet.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Vincennes：</span><br>
Astoria, it's so hot...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Astoria：</span><br>
Okay~ In that case, why don't you take off your blazer and pass it over to me?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Vincennes：</span><br>
It's still too hot even if I take it off... I'm gonna melt...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Quincy：</span><br>
We're in the tropics, after all. This is just how the climate is all year 'round. At least it cools down at night.<br>
That said, Vincennes has been busy lugging supplies around the last two days, so it only makes sense that she'd be tired...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Vincennes：</span><br>
Also, going on patrol is tiring and boring... Why do we have to run around when Enterprise and the others could handle it?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Quincy：</span><br>
Um, it seems that the admiralty is worried that there are enemy carriers lurking around, so they issued orders to have her withdrawn...<br>
That's why we're needed to patrol the area and ensure the safety of the landing force.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Astoria：</span><br>
Quincy knows everything, doesn't she? Is she becoming a better big sister than me?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Quincy：</span><br>
Th-that wasn't my intention... I just want to be helpful to you, Astoria...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Astoria：</span><br>
Hm... is that so? But not this time! You've shown me that I need to get smarter! Quincy, after this mission is over, teach me how to get smart!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Quincy：</span><br>
Um, sure!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Vincennes：</span><br>
Quincy, I'm sleepy...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Quincy：</span><br>
I suppose there's no helping it... Vincennes, come here, I'll carry you.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Vincennes：</span><br>
Yay! Quincy, I love you~<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Astoria：</span><br>
What about Astoria? You know, your other big sister?!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Vincennes：</span><br>
Um... I love you second best?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Astoria：</span><br>
Hm... I suppose that's still a silver medal...<br>
<br>
Suddenly, all three sisters were illuminated by searchlights.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Vincennes：</span><br>
Searchlights...? Or did someone behind us accidentally turn on the high beams...?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Astoria：</span><br>
Wait, no! These are... enemies! Quincy, Vincennes, prepare for battle!<br>

<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Astoria：</span><br>
What the hell! The enemies came from the south, so why didn't Chicago tell us anything?!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Quincy：</span><br>
Um, when Australia came here, perhaps there was an error in delegating the next in command?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Astoria：</span><br>
Dele... gation? What does that mean?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Vincennes：</span><br>
Sounds... "dele"...cious...?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Quincy：</span><br>
Now's not the time to explain... We have to assume the worst case scenario - that Chicago's forces were taken out before they had a chance to react...<br>
For the time being, I'll issue an alarm to mobilize all our forces, but I don't think reinforcements are going to be able to make it.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Astoria：</span><br>
You don't need to explain that to me! The enemy's right in front of our eyes!<br>
Quincy, Vincennes, stay on your guard!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Quincy & Vincennes：</span><br>
Roger that!<br>

<span style="color:#4eb24e;">{{AF|Kako}}：</span><br>
Choukai! We're here!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">{{AF|Kinugasa}}：</span><br>
Sis, I've come to help!<br>
<br>
Having defeated Chicago's South Group, Kako and Kinugasa rejoined with Choukai's fleet to face Astoria and her sisters.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">{{AF|Choukai}}：</span><br>
Great. Furutaka, Aoba, keep firing. We're going to rebuild our lines and seize victory here and now!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">{{AF|Aoba}}&{{AF|Furutaka}}：</span><br>
Understood!<br>

<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Astoria：</span><br>
How come the enemy can get reinforcements before us? I thought we were supposed to be in control of these waters?!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Quincy：</span><br>
Those two came from the south, so that must mean...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Astoria：</span><br>
As you predicted, Quincy... Chicago must have already been taken out...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Vincennes：</span><br>
Chicago... is kinda useless...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Quincy：</span><br>
Don't say that! Chicago surely did her best. Got it, Vincennes?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Vincennes：</span><br>
Sure...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Astoria：</span><br>
So, I suppose San Juan and the others won't be able to make it from the east either...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Quincy：</span><br>
Seems to be the case...<br>
The enemy won't be able to surround us just yet. We should make use of the time we have to counterattack...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Astoria：</span><br>
All right, let's do that then.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Vincennes：</span><br>
Let's go!<br>

<br>
Under the withering fire of the enemies, Astoria and her sisters were quickly becoming overwhelmed by their enemies' superior numbers...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Quincy：</span><br>
Astoria!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Astoria：</span><br>
I'm all right... I can still keep fighting!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Vincennes：</span><br>
Sis... Ugh...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Astoria：</span><br>
It'll be okay, Vincennes!<br>
Heh. I'm lucky to have sisters like you two in such a tough fight. Otherwise I wouldn't be able to keep myself from crying.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Quincy：</span><br>
Astoria... Big sister, that's right...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Vincennes：</span><br>
Mm... as long as we're all together, Vincennes will also...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Astoria：</span><br>
All right, let's make our final counterattack!<br>

{{折叠面板|标题=Overture|选项=9|主框=1|样式=primary|展开=否}}
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">{{AF|Aoba}}：</span><br>
Phew, looks like it's over. As expected, there's no one who can match our expertise in night battles. Should we finish chasing down those transports?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">{{AF|Furutaka}}：</span><br>
That's right. We didn't sustain any major injuries, so we can probably keep fighting on.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">{{AF|Choukai}}：</span><br>
Aoba, Furutaka, don't gloat too much. I'm wary as to why the enemies were so underprepared. Plus, their air support hasn't shown up yet, so we should consider ourselves lucky.<br>
If the enemy air force shows up, or if their stragglers manage to regroup, we won't even have a retreat path.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">{{AF|Kinugasa}}：</span><br>
You have a point. By the way, before we left, who was it yelling "I absolutely don't wanna go?"<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">{{AF|Aoba}}：</span><br>
W-who knows?! I have n-no clue what you're talking about~!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">{{AF|Kako}}：</span><br>
If not for the fact that we sustained devastating losses at AF, we would be able to really strike hard at the enemy. But we can't afford to take any more unnecessary losses.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">{{AF|Choukai}}：</span><br>
Unfortunately, there are no "if's" in the world. Let's go, there is only so much we can do tonight. It's a pity that we couldn't stop the enemies from landing, but I won't give up here.<br>
We'll have to continue to give it our all. There will surely be a large battle around this island.<br>
<br>
Choukai turned her head to look at the tropical island, its dense rainforest making it look even more inaccessible than before. With that, the island, as well as the sounds of battle, faded into the stillness of the moonlight.<br>
But this was only an intermission, a brief period of quiet before the curtains would rise again with the fanfare of cannons.<br>
