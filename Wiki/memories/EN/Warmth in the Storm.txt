Warmth in the Storm<br>
<br>
Mischievous Storm<br>
Port's Surrounding Waters - Patrol Vessel<br>
Mogador and I are en route to an island near the port for a survey mission.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Mogador：</span><br>
Ugghh... I can't believe I'm forced to wear this thick cloak when it's this sunny outside...<br>
Imagine if we could both change into swimwear and go on a holiday. Heehee, I'm getting giddy just thinking about it♥<br>
<br>
Mogador steps closer and leans against a railing on the deck.<br>
Just then, the sea breeze suddenly picks up, ruffling her hair.<br>
What's more, the clouds seem to have grown a bit heavier.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Yeah. You deserve a vacation after all your hard work lately.<br>
Once this survey is done, we'll both take some time off and go on a holiday.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Mogador：</span><br>
Heheheh... Getting to spend time together with you, breathing in your smell...<br>
That's not hard work to me – that's heaven♥<br>
In fact, I wish you'd make use of me more often. For things other than office work, I mean.<br>
Ugh, this cloak is such a bother... I wanna take it off...<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
You can't strip when you're still on the clock.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Mogador：</span><br>
Heheh. I know, I just had to say it.<br>
You know, there'd be no need to wait for a holiday if it wouldn't affect the Tribunal's image or whatever it was.<br>
It's so crazy hot today, almost tempting enough for...<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Ahem...<br>
It might be hot now, but the weather around here is very erratic.<br>
It gets especially cold at night. You'll catch a cold without clothes.<br>
Try to bear with it. Both for the task at hand and your health.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Mogador：</span><br>
You're that concerned about my health?<br>
Aww... Getting coddled by you wasn't on my bingo sheet today.<br>
You make me wanna expose my... heart to you.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
What, you mean to get something off your chest?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Mogador：</span><br>
Ahahaha! Straight to my chest, eh... I wanna take it nice and slow today, though.<br>
We'll have all the time in the world to enjoy ourselves...<br>
Heehee... I'm getting shivers thinking about all the stuff we'll do...♥<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
......<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Mogador：</span><br>
...Oh! You were right – the weather here IS erratic!<br>
<br>
Right as she says that, a strong gust assaults the deck.<br>
The ship starts to rock violently, and Mogador stumbles while the wind lifts her cloak.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
I think a storm's coming.<br>
Time to change course. We need to get on the island immediately!<br>
<br>
Although the storm grew more tempestuous, we did manage to make landfall before it got really bad.<br>
Unfortunately, our clothes got soaked, which makes things a little awkward.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Mogador：</span><br>
Sorry, Commander. I think some of my sweat got on your hand when you held me...<br>
Well... We're both so soaked... It's hard to tell where the sweat stops and the water starts...♥<br>
Call me bold for saying this, but I wish we could cuddle more often like this, and not just due to circumstances...<br>
...Oh. That sounded weird, didn't it?<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
It's fine. Gotta act quick when there's an emergency.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Mogador：</span><br>
Well, uh... What now? Are we stuck on this uninhabited island together?<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Perhaps. I'd better radio the port first of all.<br>

Warmth in the Storm<br>
<br>
Ghost Rumors<br>
Port's Surrounding Waters - Unexplored Island<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Mogador：</span><br>
Uh-oh. There's no signal whatsoever.<br>
<br>
The weather out at sea is a fickle mistress. As if this sudden storm blocking our return route wasn't bad enough, it has also cut off all our signals.<br>
It looks like we'll just have to stay on the island until the connection is restored.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
It's okay. We just have to wait out the storm.<br>
Let's find a safe place to seek shelter...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Mogador：</span><br>
True. My cloak is soaked through and through. It's stuck to my skin and it's gross...<br>
You're sopping wet, too... We'll both catch a cold at this rate.<br>
Might as well take off our clo–<br>
<br>
I immediately stop her before she can strip down to her birthday suit.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
If I remember correctly, the scouting fleet that first discovered this island set up a provisional base before they left.<br>
Let's go there and catch our breaths.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Mogador：</span><br>
We're going indoors? Fine by me.<br>
<br>
Provisional Base - Indoors<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Mogador：</span><br>
Ahh. Four walls and a roof. Now we don't have to put up with the rain.<br>
Although, it feels like it's getting colder and colder in here, somehow...<br>
It's so dark... Commaaander, let's stick together. Just in case something happens...<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Good point. Let's first find a generator and see if we can get the power on.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Mogador：</span><br>
Okey-dokey. Heheheh...<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Try to keep a little distance, though. And be on the lookout for danger.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Mogador：</span><br>
Okaaay...<br>
<br>
We go forward, fumbling our way through the darkness in search of a generator.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Mogador：</span><br>
I can barely see anything, yet your presence feels so much stronger...<br>
Heehee♥ My heart races every time we– Oh, watch your step here, I mean...<br>
(The Commander's still drenched... I wanna come closer♥)<br>
(If only... No, no I shouldn't. Need to stay focused. But...)<br>
(The Commander's scent... It makes it impossible to stay calm...)<br>
<br>
A while later, we arrive in the room housing the base's generator.<br>
We scan the room under the emergency lighting and happen upon some writing that someone has left on the wall.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Mogador：</span><br>
Commaaander, there's some writing on this wall here...<br>
"The island's ghosts awaken during the storm. Anyone who stops here must obey the following rules:"<br>
"One: Return to your ship at once if you see or hear strangers. No people live on this island."<br>
"Two: The sea wind is a gentle being, and its storms never rage on the island itself..."<br>
"If a storm hits, head to the break room and stay put until it passes."<br>
"Three: There is no shower in the break room."<br>
"If, however, there is a shower room, there should also be two beds."<br>
"If there is a shower room and only a single bed, you must ◼◼◼◼"<br>
The rest is unreadable... What is this? Some kind of ghost story?<br>
Part two of it has kinda come true already, so...<br>
Do you think it has any weight to it, Commander?<br>
<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项1：Ghost stories are just that. Stories.</span>'''''<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项2：What do YOU think?</span>'''''<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项1）</span>'''''Someone who came here before us probably just wrote it as a prank.<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项1）</span>'''''When we get back, I'll have to check if Bristol was here.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项2）</span>'''''What do YOU think?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Mogador：</span><br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项2）</span>'''''I think it's well written for a ghost story. Especially with this atmosphere...<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项2）</span>'''''If it IS real, I'm curious to see what comes next. Heheheh...<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
(Real or not, I have a hunch something will happen during our stay here.)<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Mogador：</span><br>
(Ahh... You look so composed, so gentle under the moonlight, Commander...)<br>
(You know what? Maybe it's fine if it stays dark♥)<br>

<br>
Warmth in the Storm<br>
<br>
Searching for the Break Room<br>
I power up the generator. Slowly, a dim light illuminates the lengthy and narrow room.<br>
Antiquated machinery and piles of random objects cast long shadows on the walls.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Mogador：</span><br>
Oh, there's the light...<br>
<br>
Thanks to the light, I can now finally get a look at Mogador.<br>
Although her clothes have dried a little, they still firmly cling to her skin.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Mogador：</span><br>
Commaaander... Look how wet I am♥<br>
<br>
She pulls on the fabric, which outlines the contours of her body down to the fine details.<br>
The play of light and shadow makes her bumps and curves all the more pronounced.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Mogador：</span><br>
Your uniform's heavy, so I bet it feels even more uncomfortable on you♥<br>
<br>
She places her hands on me and is about to start undressing me, but then...<br>
There's the click of the power breaker failing, and darkness envelops the room once more.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Mogador：</span><br>
...Can you hear that, Commander? Someone's talking...<br>
<br>
She's not wrong. I can hear a whispered conversation coming from a corner of the room.<br>
I listen closely. Amid the hushed words, I hear a faint laughter.<br>
Startled, Mogador huddles up next to me, gripping the sleeve of my coat and looking around warily.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Mogador：</span><br>
Could this be... what the first rule warned us about?<br>
Is that ghost story... true after all?<br>
<br>
Her breath feels especially warm against my ear. Maybe it's because the temperature is starting to drop.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
It's a bit creepy, I won't deny that. Let's just hope your main guns can handle any ghosts that might appear.<br>
But any ghost-busting will have to wait until tomorrow. Let's head for the break room for now.<br>
And if you get scared, well...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Mogador：</span><br>
I'm a judge of the Tribunal. I ain't afraid of no ghosts...<br>
...Actually, on second thought, I'm really scared!<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Uh, okay...<br>
<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项1：(Offer her your hand.)</span>'''''<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项2：(Let her hold on to your sleeve.)</span>'''''<br>
<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项1）</span>'''''I extend my hand to her. She grabs it without a moment's hesitation.<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项1）</span>'''''Her cold fingers run across my palm, then interlock with mine.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Mogador：</span><br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项1）</span>'''''Thanks... This really helps a lot.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Mogador：</span><br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项2）</span>'''''Your... sleeve...<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项2）</span>'''''Can I wrap my arm around yours instead? That'd be more reassuring...<br>
<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项2）</span>'''''Her cold fingers brush against my hand. Once she sees I'm okay with it, she immediately wraps her arm around mine.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Mogador：</span><br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项2）</span>'''''Thanks... This really helps a lot.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Glad it does. Now let's go.<br>
<br>
As we move through the darkness, her body sometimes leans right against my arm.<br>
Even through her cloak, I can tell that she's trembling slightly.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Mogador：</span><br>
(Sheesh... I didn't think it'd get so cold at night on this island...)<br>
(At least the Commander's hand feels so warm. I don't wanna let go of it...)<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
*sigh*... This is why you should wear clothes.<br>
Hang in there. We'll find a way to warm you up once we find the break room.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Mogador：</span><br>
Don't worry, I'm really resilient. I don't get sick easily.<br>
...Err, I mean, I'm freezing cold! Brrr!<br>
I'm gonna turn into a popsicle... You need to warm me up now, Commander!<br>
<br>
She wraps her whole body around me, squeezing tightly like I'm a stuffed animal.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
It'll take us longer to get there if you cling to me like this...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Mogador：</span><br>
I'm not in a hurry... At least doing this keeps us both warm♥<br>
<br>
Right then, a strong gust throws open a nearby window, interrupting our conversation.<br>

Warmth in the Storm<br>
<br>
Bring Me a Towel<br>
An eerie breeze stirs up dust and old papers. That, combined with the moonlight, makes it almost look like there's a ghost with us.<br>
Mogador tightens her grip on my hand.<br>
<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项1：(Soothe her with words.)</span>'''''<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项2：(Soothe her with physical touch.)</span>'''''<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项1）</span>'''''Don't be afraid. It's just the wind.<br>
<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项2）</span>'''''I wrap my arms around her shoulders and pat her back to calm her down.<br>
<br>
My comforting helps. She relaxes and leans against me.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Mogador：</span><br>
(Ahh... An excuse to embrace the Commander...)<br>
(Such a warm coat... I wish I could be held like this forever♥)<br>
(I love ghost stories now...)<br>
<br>
She caves in to her impulse and slips in under my coat, clinging to me.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
(I can't move like this...)<br>
(Ugh... Need to close that window.)<br>
<br>
After the minor "incident" in the corridor, we arrived inside the break room.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Only one bed. We'll just have to make do...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Mogador：</span><br>
(We have this place all to ourselves... Heheheh...)<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Okay, I just had a look around the room. The doors and windows are all firmly shut, so there won't be any repeats of what happened in the corridor.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Mogador：</span><br>
(We'll be sleeping in the same room... Heheheheh♥)<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
The power works and there's running water, so the shower room should be usable. You go ahead and take a shower to warm up.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Mogador：</span><br>
(Drats... I need to think of a way to drag the Commander with me into the shower...)<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
There are plenty of rations and even candles for emergencies. I'll set things up and prep some food.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Mogador：</span><br>
(Food and candles... A candlelit dinner on a desert island...)<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Mogador? Hello? You look a bit distracted.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Mogador：</span><br>
Oh, uh, I'm fine. You really plan for everything, Commander!<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Thank the girls who came here before us. I didn't bring the supplies – they left them here.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Mogador：</span><br>
Of course. They're all so diligent!<br>
Anyway, I'm gonna take a shower. Be back in a bit!<br>
<br>
She runs off into the shower room without a moment's delay.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
What's up with her...?<br>
<br>
The sound of the shower ceases, and a hand pokes out through the gap in the door.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Mogador：</span><br>
Commaaander, there's no towel...<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
(Don't tell me this was her plan...)<br>
One sec. There should be one among the supplies.<br>
<br>
I get up, find a towel, and just as I reach out to give it to her...<br>
Rather than take the towel, she takes a firm hold of my wrist.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Mogador：</span><br>
Commaaander... You've been drenched for a pretty long time now...♥<br>
Come in here and let me take care of you♥<br>
<br>
Before I can even react, she pulls me inside the shower room.<br>
The room is thick with warm steam. Fortunately, there's a translucent shower curtain separating me and her.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Mogador：</span><br>
You must be exhausted! Let me help you wash with some hot water. It feels sooo good, trust me...♥<br>
<br>
She grabs the curtain, getting ready to pull it aside.<br>
I try to stop her, but it's no use. Inhuman strength courses through her in this moment.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Mogador：</span><br>
Thanks to your thoughtfulness, I don't feel cold at all...<br>
If anything, I feel hot. My body is so warm, and my head is spinning...♥<br>
<br>
She takes my hand and shakes it side to side. I feel the soft, warm touch of her fingers...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Mogador：</span><br>
I'll bet you feel the same...♥<br>
Just so unbearably hot, not able to think...<br>
That's an early sign you're coming down with a cold, you know...<br>
I'll need to make you feel relaxed and real good tonight...♥<br>

<br>
Warmth in the Storm<br>
<br>
After a Shower<br>
Showering really is something special.<br>
After a nice hot shower, it feels like my fatigue from today has all vanished.<br>
As I step out of the shower room, I see Mogador standing there, holding a clean towel in her hands.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Mogador：</span><br>
You've been so nice to me today, so I want to repay the favor somehow...<br>
Will you let me dry your hair?<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
I think I can do that myself.<br>
<br>
Just as I turn her down, she seizes my hand.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Mogador：</span><br>
Heheheh... You don't get to say no. You and I are the only ones here♥<br>
<br>
She makes me sit on a chair, after which she gets behind me and starts drying my hair with the towel.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Mogador：</span><br>
(What kind of shampoo the Commander used... I'm curious...♥)<br>
<br>
She comes closer and closer to me...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Mogador：</span><br>
(*sniiiff*... What a unique smell. It's so good... *pant pant*...♥)<br>
<br>
Until eventually, she leans on me with her whole body!<br>
A warm, tickling sensation rubs the back of my neck, and her labored breaths strike my ears.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Mogador：</span><br>
*sniiiff*... *sniiiff*... You smell so good♥ God, I'm getting hooked on this...<br>
(Heheheh... Since we're all by ourselves, we might as well... get on with the–)<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Communicator：</span><br>
RING RING RING!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Mogador：</span><br>
Huh? Wait... You have signal again?<br>
<br>
Mogador remains in her embrace from behind, suddenly with a dumbfounded expression on her face.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
The hair... Are you done?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Mogador：</span><br>
Err, I suppose... G-go on, radio the port!<br>
<br>
They tell me that a rescue fleet won't be able to arrive until tomorrow at noon – due to the storm and how late it is.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
In other words, we'll just have to spend the night here.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Mogador：</span><br>
(There's only one bed, so that means we'll...)<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
You take the bed. I'm fine with sleeping on the floor.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Mogador：</span><br>
No way! I'll lie on the floor and you should have the bed...<br>
(Because once you fall asleep, it doesn't matter whether you're in bed or on the floor. Heheheh...♥)<br>
Since I'm not hearing any disagreement, let's go to sleep now. You must be exhausted!<br>
<br>
As she says that, she quickly starts laying out the sheets on the floor.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Okay, since you insist...<br>

Warmth in the Storm<br>
<br>
There Is Only One Bed<br>
It's the dead of night. Barely conscious, I feel something slide in under the sheets with me.<br>
<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项1：...Who's there?</span>'''''<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项2：...Mogador?</span>'''''<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Mogador：</span><br>
Remember the third rule...<br>
"If there is a shower room and only a single bed, you must sleep together."<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
...It didn't say that.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Mogador：</span><br>
It did! I'm a judge with a keen eye, and we have to follow the rules. Heheheh...♥<br>
You're not going to kick me out of the bed, are you?<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
...As long as you sleep like normal, I won't.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Mogador：</span><br>
Heheh... Don't worry, I'll be normal...<br>
<br>
Mogador and I lie side by side in bed, listening as the storm raging outside the window gradually dies down.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Mogador：</span><br>
I almost can't believe we're lying in bed like normal... It's so strange...<br>
<br>
The voice of the usually energetic girl beside me is softer now, as though she's settling down along with the storm outside.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Strange? You're the one who snuck under my sheets.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Mogador：</span><br>
Heheheh... I mean, think about this situation as a whole... Isn't it strange?<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
I guess you're not wrong.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Mogador：</span><br>
Strange means unique, and if I'm part of that uniqueness, that gives me a special place in your heart...<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
What are you talking about...?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Mogador：</span><br>
You know, we're in the same room, in the same bed, just sleeping like perfectly normal people...<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Get up to anything funny and I'm going straight to the floor.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Mogador：</span><br>
I won't... I promise I'll behave tonight...<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Thank you.<br>
<br>
While drowsiness is half-overtaking my mind, our silly little conversation continues.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Mogador：</span><br>
When you said you'd take me on a vacation earlier, did you really mean it?<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Of course. I don't make promises I don't intend to keep.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Mogador：</span><br>
So... it'll be just you and me on the beachside, lying together on our backs...<br>
I hope it'll be sunny then...<br>
And that the sea breeze will be filled with your scent...♥<br>
<br>
She mutters under her breath, slowly but surely falling asleep.<br>
I look at her as she quietly lies there, and I too feel the blanket of sleepiness finally wrapping around me.<br>

Warmth in the Storm<br>
<br>
She Seems Dependable, But...<br>
Perhaps because of yesterday's exhaustion, I indulged in a rare sleep-in today.<br>
By the time I wake up, Mogador has already done her morning routine and is sitting down, engrossed in something.<br>
<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项1：Good morning.</span>'''''<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Mogador：</span><br>
*yaaawn*... Good morning, Commander.<br>
<br>
She stretches with a small grunt.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Didn't sleep well last night?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Mogador：</span><br>
I slept like a baby for a good few hours, but then I had a nightmare about eerie sounds, like in the ghost story...<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Speaking of which, we still haven't figured out the source of those strange noises near the generator.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Mogador：</span><br>
No worries. I already went and investigated that. *yaaawn*...<br>
<br>
She stretches once more and throws the notebook in her hands toward me.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Oh. Your night patrol log?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Mogador：</span><br>
Mhm. I couldn't really sleep after that dream, feeling like there might be danger lurking nearby...<br>
Take a look at the last page.<br>
<br>
According to her notes, she went on a solo patrol at around 4 in the morning.<br>
And when she went to the generator room, she found something interesting...<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
A tape recorder?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Mogador：</span><br>
Yup. It was hidden way out of view in a corner, and it had been set up to automatically start playing sounds when the generator was fired up.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
...Do you know who might have done it?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Mogador：</span><br>
Sure do. Since our signal came back last evening, I looked into who had been here previously.<br>
Can you guess who it was?<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
......<br>
<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项1：It wasn't Fu Shun, was it?</span>'''''<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项2：Was it actually Bristol after all?</span>'''''<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Mogador：</span><br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项1）</span>'''''Sadly, no. It was Bristol. She led the team at the time.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Mogador：</span><br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项2）</span>'''''Ding-ding-ding. Correct!<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
......<br>
I didn't think we'd solve that mystery overnight. My hat's off to you, Mogador. You're dependable.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Mogador：</span><br>
Heheh... I've always been dependable. You know that.<br>
If you really think I did good, well, I'd love some kind of reward...<br>
<br>
As she says that, she returns to bed and tries to wriggle her way under the sheets again.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Put on your cloak before anything else!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Mogador：</span><br>
But I'm tiiired... I wanna go back to sleep...<br>
I spent the whole night on patrol, you know...<br>
Besides, you're still sleepy yourself, aren't you?<br>
Our rescue won't arrive until noon, so...♥<br>
We still have plenty of time all to ourselves... Heheheh♥<br>
Let's not waste this opportunity...♥<br>
Sleep with me, Commander... Heheheh...♥<br>
