Denver's Quest!<br>
<br>
1.Quest Accepted!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Denver：</span><br>
So, I was in the harbor the other day, and someone brought up how they had this job they could use a hand with, but they didn't know who to turn to.<br>
There are plenty of busy bees around the port, but not all bees are as busy as others, so I'm thinking we could set up some sorta system for people to help out if they've got the time!<br>
And this is what I came up with. What do you think, Commander?<br>
<br>
As per Denver's suggestion, we established a sort of quest board for people to request others' assistance with whatever they need doing.<br>
Within hours of its creation, the board was already covered in written requests for various tasks and projects, held up by thumbtacks.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Denver：</span><br>
Hmm, this is neat...<br>
Oh, hey, Commander! Thanks for implementing my quest board idea. You're a champ.<br>
<br>
I stood beside Denver and inspected the quest board. A handful of jobs had been marked "Quest Complete" with a bright red stamp.<br>
I was amazed. Only a few hours have passed, and already someone had taken it upon themselves to help people. The question was, who is it?<br>
Upon closer inspection, I could make out the name of the girl who accepted the quest. To my surprise, it was Denver's oldest sister, Cleveland.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Denver：</span><br>
That's Cleveland for ya. I gotta take a leaf out of her book and do the same, as a fellow Knight of the Sea!<br>
Look, she's even done the jobs involving moving stuff to that newly-built club building!<br>
What a legend... We just created this quest board, and she's been knocking these jobs out one by one...<br>
<br>
It was just like Denver said. I inspected some more quests on the board, and they had all been marked as completed by Cleveland.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Denver：</span><br>
Now I'm feeling motivated! New goal: aim for the top of the leaderboard, like Cleveland!<br>
<br>
Denver always strives to do the best she can, but on this day she sounded especially fired up.<br>

Denver's Quest!<br>
<br>
2.First Quest, First Party<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Denver：</span><br>
Could you help me look for some quests, Commander? I want ones that'll score me as much rep as Cleveland.<br>
<br>
Attaining Cleveland's level of prestige is a lofty ambition indeed.<br>
In any case, solving practical problems around the port is part of my job. With that in mind, I agreed to help her. Denver started scouring the quest board, while I went asking around.<br>
Around ten minutes later, Denver came to me with printed copies of some promising tasks from the quest board.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Denver：</span><br>
First off, here's one from the Royal Maids, who want help with decorating a huge cake... Not bad, but I dunno if it's the one for me.<br>
This one's from Long Island. "LF partner to practice fighting mains with"... Uhh, Commander, what kind of jobs are these even?<br>
<br>
"They might sound like odd jobs, but I think your best strategy is to be open to all kinds of quests, regardless of what they involve."<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Denver：</span><br>
Yeah, I guess... I'm just a bit confused because this isn't what I was expecting.<br>
I was hoping for something a little grander. "I really need your help!" sorta deal, you know?<br>
<br>
She had a point. These quests seemed closer to busywork than calls for urgent assistance.<br>
I presented what quests I had found on my own, hoping one of them might live up to her expectations.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Denver：</span><br>
Wow, you found a couple too, huh? Let's see what we have here...<br>
Ooh! Storehouse pest control! You won't find a more perfect quest for me than this!<br>
I'll be one step closer to Clevelandhood if I can get this done!<br>
<br>
Denver's hardworking ethic and desire to help others are two of her greatest qualities.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Denver：</span><br>
Hmm. Judging by the handwriting, I'm 95% sure it's Spence who posted this quest.<br>
You know, from the Little Beavers? I hang out with 'em all the time, so I know how they write.<br>
Anyway, sorry for asking on such short notice, but could you come along and help me with this quest, Commander?<br>
<br>
For better or worse, I had no other plans in particular on that day, so I thought "why not" and agreed to help her.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Denver：</span><br>
I knew I could count on you!<br>
Every journey starts with one step, and today will be my first one towards Clevelandy greatness!<br>
<br>
She balled her hand into a fist and extended her arm towards me. She held it like that, waiting for my response.<br>
I realized what she was going for, and did a fist bump with her.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Denver：</span><br>
Hell yeah! That's how we do it!<br>
All right then, let's go!<br>

Denver's Quest!<br>
<br>
3.Knights Need Advice<br>
We did as the quest said and headed to just outside the storehouse, where Spence and Charles Ausburne greeted us.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Charles Ausburne：</span><br>
Salutations, Commander! And Denver, too!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Spence：</span><br>
A-are you here to take care of the pests? I see you've got the q-quest papers...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Denver：</span><br>
Sure are, sure do!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Charles Ausburne：</span><br>
Answering the call of those who need help, now that's what real heroes do!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Denver：</span><br>
Clue me in on the deets. Where are the pests? There in the storehouse?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Spence：</span><br>
Y-yes. J-just have a look...<br>
<br>
Charles produced a key and opened the door to the storehouse. The interior was lined with tons of rations and food.<br>
I spotted a few bags which had holes chewed through the bottom. The infestation hadn't yet grown out of control, but it had to be dealt with posthaste.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Charles Ausburne：</span><br>
I did what a hero would and searched every nook and cranny for those pesky pests, but I couldn't find them anywhere.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Denver：</span><br>
We're up against sneaky little buggers, eh? I doubt it'll be easy luring them out of... Hey! There!<br>
<br>
Denver interrupted herself. She armed herself with a machine gun barrel lying around in the storage and went on the offensive.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Denver：</span><br>
I saw one right there! Get back here, you little bug!<br>
<br>
Denver swung her improvised weapon with unbelievable speed and took out a lone cockroach.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Denver：</span><br>
Whew! That's one, but we should expect to find dozens more, based on the look of things.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Spence：</span><br>
D-d-d-dozens more?!<br>
<br>
"We'll never get them all with this approach," I thought. A change of strategy was necessary.<br>
I walked out of the storehouse and inspected the flower bed by the entrance.<br>
<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项1："Out here, Denver."</span>'''''<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Denver：</span><br>
Yeah? What's up?<br>
<br>
I called her attention to the white flowers growing on the ground.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Denver：</span><br>
What about 'em? ...Wait, I see now! Columbia told me about these flowers, they work as a natural insecticide!<br>
If we use these, we can take out the all bugs in one fell swoop!<br>
Good thinking, Commander! Just goes to show that every knight could use the advice of a commander!<br>
<br>
She looked at me with gleaming eyes and thanked me, then promptly picked the flowers and got to work on concocting a simple pesticide.<br>
I didn't know it yet, but our knightly adventure had only just begun.<br>

Denver's Quest!<br>
<br>
4.The Knight's Sisters<br>
After Denver turned in the pest control quest, she came back with a new addition to our little party.<br>
It was none other than her disciplined, self-reliant younger sister and fellow Knight of the Sea, Birmingham.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Denver：</span><br>
There you are, Commander!<br>
Let me introduce you to my little sister here! Her name is Birmingham.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Birmingham：</span><br>
...Denver, this is silly. I already introduced myself to the commander when I took up my post here.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Denver：</span><br>
Fair enough. Anyway, you know what the commander and I did earlier? We came to face with a swarm of wretched bugs, and we wiped 'em all out!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Birmingham：</span><br>
Which is to say... what? That you have the potential to rival Cleveland? Don't take this the wrong way, but I'm skeptical.<br>
<br>
Birmingham gazed intently at us, looking like she was going to throw down the gauntlet. Perhaps she would've, if someone hadn't interjected.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Cleveland：</span><br>
Oh! Commander! And two of my little sisters as well.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Denver & Birmingham：</span><br>
Cleveland! Hey!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Cleveland：</span><br>
Heh, guess I've got competition now.<br>
<br>
Cleveland chuckled as she put the red stamp on a quest she had just completed.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Denver：</span><br>
What kinda quest did you take on today, Cleve?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Cleveland：</span><br>
Hm? Oh, nothing to write home about. Just did a sweep not too far from here.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Denver：</span><br>
You did a sweep by yourself?! Wow! You really are a legend!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Birmingham：</span><br>
I agree. That's incredible.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Cleveland：</span><br>
Uh... What? Literally all I did was sweep the floor of this place the R&D guys wanted to convert into a storeroom.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Denver：</span><br>
Then you made their job easier, so they'll be able to work faster and come up with a series of amazing inventions!<br>
You made a contribution to science! Man, I wanna be as awesome as you someday!<br>
<br>
Denver got fired up again, inspired by her sister's allegedly great contribution.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Birmingham：</span><br>
Psst, Commander. Is she always like this?<br>
<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项1："Yep."</span>'''''<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Birmingham：</span><br>
She must be a real handful... Thanks for always looking after her.<br>
<br>
Denver sang Cleveland's praises, while Cleveland herself was left speechless. Birmingham, meanwhile, gave me her thanks.<br>
Through Denver's enthusiasm, I got Birmingham to open up, if only a bit.<br>

Denver's Quest!<br>
<br>
5.A Rival's Quest<br>
A rival to my knightly companion approached the quest board.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Sendai：</span><br>
Oh, if it ain't you, Denver. That explains that shoutin' just a minute ago.<br>
<br>
It was Sendai from the Sakura Empire. She held a sheet of paper in her hand.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Sendai：</span><br>
Was just thinking about whether or not to put this quest on the board.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Denver：</span><br>
What kinda quest are we talking? The commander and I could give you a hand.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Sendai：</span><br>
You'd do that? It's nothin' important anyway, but if you wanna.<br>
See, I got into basketball a while back. Been playin' with Ashigara and Nachi a lot. Too much, even, so I've been gathering up an away team to play against.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Denver：</span><br>
Away team? Ah, you mean like, people you've never played against before?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Sendai：</span><br>
Basically. I've got some people already, but if I called 'em now it'd take all day for them to show. So what I'm askin' for is a one-on-one.<br>
<br>
Sendai smiled and unfolded her handwritten quest paper.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Sendai：</span><br>
So, what do you say? Heard your sisters are into basketball. They could spectate if they want.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Denver：</span><br>
Ah, so you're challenging me to a round of basketball, huh?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Sendai：</span><br>
Sure am. You're the worthiest opponent I can think of. And how could I pass up a chance to find out who between us is the best?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Denver：</span><br>
Well, I'm sure as heck not one to back down when my rep's at stake!<br>
<br>
They glared intently at each other. Not as enemies, but as friendly rivals, each looking to prove themselves the better basketball player.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Denver：</span><br>
Challenge accepted! This will be one more step on my journey to become a full-fledged Knight of the Sea!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Sendai：</span><br>
All right, then we'll play in two hours. Get yourself warmed up and bring your A-game.<br>
Oh, and Commander? I want you to be the referee. You're usually pretty impartial, compared to most girls with biases to their faction.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Denver：</span><br>
Yeah! Be our referee, Commander!<br>
<br>
Sendai and Denver alike had fiery hot looks of determination in their eyes. One thing was for sure: an intense game of basketball was imminent.<br>

Denver's Quest!<br>
<br>
6.Leveling Up!<br>
It was time for the match, and I'd arrived at the basketball court. Word of the game must have gotten around, as the spectator seats were starting to fill up.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Spence：</span><br>
G-give it your all, D-Denver!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Myoukou：</span><br>
I normally wouldn't spectate a game. But it's a different story when Sendai and Denver are playing.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Agano：</span><br>
Hmm. Between the two though, wouldn't it be fair to argue that Sendai has the most potential?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Charles Ausburne：</span><br>
I wouldn't be so sure! You've never seen Denver play before, so you can't gauge her ability!<br>
<br>
The spectators were clamoring as Sendai walked from across the court. She looked at Denver while spinning the ball with her bandage-covered index finger.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Sendai：</span><br>
The rules are simple. Scored shots from the three-point line are worth 2 points. Any other shot's worth 1 point. First to 10 points wins.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Denver：</span><br>
Simple is just the way I like it. Well? I'm ready when you are!<br>
<br>
Sendai won the coin flip to determine who starts off with the ball. The whistle blew, and the match officially started.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Sendai：</span><br>
Let's see what you've got!<br>
<br>
Sendai swiftly dribbled her way towards the goal. Denver intended to intercept, and had to gauge whether she was coming in left or right.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Denver：</span><br>
It's gotta be the left!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Sendai：</span><br>
Nice try! It's the right!<br>
<br>
Sendai gracefully swirled past Denver's defense and threw a well-aimed shot into her basket. Sendai gained the lead with 1 point.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Denver：</span><br>
Now it's my turn! Watch this!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Sendai：</span><br>
Go on. I'm ready to intercept where– What the hell?!<br>
<br>
Denver threw the ball right from where she stood at the three-point line. Incredibly, the ball went right into Sendai's basket, scoring Denver 2 points.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Denver：</span><br>
Gotcha! By the way, I play my best in the position of shooting guard!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Sendai：</span><br>
Hmph, not bad... Then I'll just have to double down on my defense!<br>
<br>
The lead switched back and forth repeatedly, until the game reached a decisive point. The board stood at 9 to 8 for Sendai.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Denver：</span><br>
*pant*... S-Sendai's dribbling is so deceptive... I can't predict where she's going!<br>
<br>
Denver's strategy had become almost impossible to pull off as Sendai gradually improved her defense game.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Sendai：</span><br>
Heh, it's over, Denver... I can read your movements like an open book. You're not gettin' the ball from me again!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Denver：</span><br>
Don't count your chickens until they've hatched! I'm gonna win this, whatever it takes!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Sendai：</span><br>
You sure sound cocksure. Hope that means you're finally gonna bust out your A-game!<br>
<br>
Sendai undid the bandages covering her hands, while Denver gazed up into the vast blue sky.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Denver：</span><br>
Commander, Cleveland... I hope you're watching me. I'm gonna make you proud!<br>
<br>
The tense match had reached its final stage, and victory seemed within grasp of either player's hands.<br>

Denver's Quest!<br>
<br>
7.Chivalric Oath<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Cleveland：</span><br>
We're still alive, y'know! Don't look at the sky, look at us!<br>
<br>
Cleveland brought Denver back to reality from her little melodramatic moment.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Denver：</span><br>
Huh?! When'd you show up to spectate, Cleve?!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Cleveland：</span><br>
Don't waste time thinking about that! Focus! It all comes down to whoever scores now!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Denver：</span><br>
...Yeah! You're right!<br>
<br>
Denver abandoned the strategy she'd used up to now, as it wasn't working anymore, and instead came charging at Sendai.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Denver：</span><br>
Watch this!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Sendai：</span><br>
The hell?!<br>
<br>
Denver dribbled the ball in a manner just short of a foul, going on the hyper-offensive.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Denver：</span><br>
This is it! Eyes on me, Commander, Cleve!<br>
<br>
She completely broke through Sendai's defense, throwing the ball at the basket from the three-point line on Denver's own side.<br>
Sendai stared dumbfounded as the ball flew through the air and went cleanly through the hoop, scoring Denver the win.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Sendai：</span><br>
Damn... Feels like I just got topped in determination as well as skill.<br>
<br>
The crowd burst into cheers. This triumph was significant for Denver in more ways than one.<br>
Cleveland went and gave Denver her congratulations and a fist bump, then Denver jogged over to me.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Denver：</span><br>
Whew... C-Commander, did you see that? I'm amazed, myself!<br>
When I heard Cleveland and saw you both spectating the game, I just felt this surge of energy and willpower!<br>
Without you, I don't know if I could've clutched the win like that! Thank you, Commander!<br>
<br>
Denver expressed her gratitude with a dazzling smile.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Denver：</span><br>
I know I'm still lacking experience, but one day I'm gonna be a gallant Knight of the Sea, just like Cleve.<br>
And when I am, I vow to be your sword. The sword that cuts aside everything barring you from your future, Commander!<br>
<br>
She made a chivalric oath that actually brought a blush to my face. I responded the best way I could think of: by holding her hand firmly.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Denver：</span><br>
O-oh gosh!<br>
Err... Ahem! It's my honor and duty to serve as your knight, Commander!<br>
<br>
She declared her feelings candidly. At the end of the day, her quest to attaining knighthood – or Clevelandhood, as she'd put it – continues.<br>
And my job was to help her on the journey in any way I could.<br>
