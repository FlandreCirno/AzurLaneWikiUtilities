<br>
Chapter 1: Essex's Troubles<br>
Port - Lecture Hall<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Belfast：</span><br>
Suffolk, would you kindly put Cleveland's bonsais over there for me? Yes, right by the door.<br>
Kent, let's start with six sets of Her Majesty's china. And Sheffy, you'll be hanging chandeliers.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Essex：</span><br>
Can I put this box here?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Belfast：</span><br>
Madam Essex? Oh yes, right here would be lovely.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Essex：</span><br>
Phew... Little by little, the auditorium here is turning into something really overwhelming.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Belfast：</span><br>
It's all part of our responsibilities in preparing the party. We have to give everyone the true Royal Navy experience if we don't want to rouse Her Majesty's ire.<br>
Madam Essex, you've been so very helpful these past few days. Allow me to once again express my gratitude.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Essex：</span><br>
Oh, it was nothing. I'm happy to help.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Belfast：</span><br>
Was it really nothing, though? You've spent all of the last couple days with us.<br>
But in any case, since you're new here, I would hope you can find some joy in the event itself, Madam Essex.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Essex：</span><br>
I appreciate the thought, Miss Belfast, but I'm really a-okay.<br>
The fleet's been through so much. They fought for the right to kick back here with some good food and fun. But me? What did I do to deserve a party?<br>
If I wasn't here helping, I'd probably just be out training somewhere anyway...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Belfast：</span><br>
You have some marvelous ideas, Madam Essex.<br>
But I'm afraid there's not much more to do here... I think we're about to put you out of a job.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Essex：</span><br>
Really? Well, it's not like I have anywhere else to go. I guess I'll just head back to–<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">？？？：</span><br>
I wouldn't worry about that.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Essex：</span><br>
That voice! It must be...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Belfast：</span><br>
Ah, welcome, Madam Enterprise.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Enterprise：</span><br>
So this is where we're hosting the party? ... You've already got it looking great.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Belfast：</span><br>
Hehe, it's an honor to earn such praise from you, Madam Enterprise.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Enterprise：</span><br>
And you've taken such good care of Essex. I owe you one. Next time, just pawn her off on me.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Essex：</span><br>
E-Enterprise, what did you mean by...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Enterprise：</span><br>
I heard what you were just saying. It's obvious you look up to me, so how could I leave a cute little girl like you all alone?<br>
Now if hoity-toity stuff like this isn't your speed, what would you say to a little rumble with me?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Essex：</span><br>
A rumble? What's this flyer?<br>
... "The First Annual Port Martial Arts Tournament. Want to test your strength? Want to face down the greatest the other camps have to offer? Join us!"<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Enterprise：</span><br>
You'll wanna read this part.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Essex：</span><br>
"Aircraft Carrier Group Guest of Honor: Enterprise. The winner earns the right to challenge Enterprise herself."<br>
... Wow...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Enterprise：</span><br>
Well? What do you think? You in?<br>

<br>
Chapter 2: Albacore's Stroll<br>
Port - Plaza (now a Stage)<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Albacore：</span><br>
La~ Lala~ Gala tiime~ Lala- Huh? What's that~?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Hyuuga：</span><br>
Come on, Ise, let's make this interesting.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ise：</span><br>
Interesting? What do you mean?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Hyuuga：</span><br>
Let's see who can set up their stuff the quickest. Loser buys the drinks!!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ise：</span><br>
Hah hah ha! Like I'm gonna lose to you? Hope you brought plenty of cash.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Albacore：</span><br>
Wowee! Are you two gonna get that whole stage set up in just one day? That's wild!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Hyuuga：</span><br>
Hah! You bet your scantily clad ass we are!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Albacore：</span><br>
I don't get it... There's a celebration on and you're here working all day?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ise：</span><br>
Not that you'd know, but there's a reason we're putting up the stage.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Hyuuga：</span><br>
Yea, idols are our Sakura culture. We gotta get this stage going so we can show the world.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ise：</span><br>
"We got the idols! Right here on our purpose-built stage!" Get it?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Albacore：</span><br>
Ohhh!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ise：</span><br>
Hah! Now, we got a lotta work to do, so you run along. This isn't a place for kids to play. Come back when the concert's on.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Albacore：</span><br>
Okaaaay.<br>
But like... Where do I go? Commander's busy with whatever. Who am I supposed to play with?<br>
Not to mention everybody's all caught up on the gala tonight. There's nobody to prank...<br>
Hey, what's that box over by Akashi's shop? There's something written on it...<br>
"Akashi's Fabulous Variety Show. Leave 50 Gems on the carpet, nya!"<br>
......<br>
Hehehe.<br>
All set. Here we go.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Akashi：</span><br>
Nya?! A Gem!<br>
<br>
Boom！<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Akashi：</span><br>
*Cough*! *Cough*! Who's there, nya?! Was that a Gem-shaped smoke bomb, nya?!<br>
Show yourself, coward! I'll double my prices, nya!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Albacore：</span><br>
*Snort* ... Ahahahaha! Got 'em!<br>
Boy, did Akashi grab that Gem crazy quick. I barely saw her move...<br>
Ah, nothing beats a good prank! Now, what to do next... I guess I could go check out the Lecture Hall...<br>
Oh, I know! I'll see what Taihou's up to!<br>

<br>
Chapter 3: Taihou and Albacore<br>
Port - Dormitory<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Taihou：</span><br>
I have my materials and my tools. Almost ready to start sewing.<br>
Now, how about the Manjuus I borrowed from Akashi...<br>
<br>
The Manjuus gathered up their assigned tools, eager to begin.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Taihou：</span><br>
Yes, let's get started! We have to finish putting together the perfect outfit before the party!<br>
Ahahaha! When I think of my darling Commander getting seduced by my ravishing outfit oh... Oh! OH! How I LOVE it!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Albacore：</span><br>
Need a hand?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Taihou：</span><br>
Aaah! A-A-A-A-Albacore?!<br>
Uuuuuuughhh...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Albacore：</span><br>
... Oops. I just wanted to scare you. Didn't mean to konk you out.<br>
Heyyy, Taihou. Wakey waaakeeeyyy!<br>
<br>
30 Minutes Later<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Taihou：</span><br>
... Where, where am I...? I had this terrible dream about Albacore in my room...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Albacore：</span><br>
Oh, that wasn't a dream. I'm really here~<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Taihou：</span><br>
Uuuuuuughhh...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Albacore：</span><br>
Hey, don't go back to sleep. Manjuus, do me a favor and grab a glass of water.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Taihou：</span><br>
What are you doing here? Get out of my room!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Albacore：</span><br>
No special reason. I just thought I'd come by and hang out for a bit.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Taihou：</span><br>
... Hang out? Since when are we friends? Since when do we not hate each other?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Albacore：</span><br>
Look, we're in the same fleet from here on out, like it or not. We gotta try to get along.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Taihou：</span><br>
... Fine. Whatever. I really couldn't care less. The past is the past. Water under the bridge.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Albacore：</span><br>
Really? Great! Now I can play with the Commander without worrying about you–<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Taihou：</span><br>
Don't you dare pester my Commander, unless you want your throat sl–<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Albacore：</span><br>
Heyyyy now! Didn't we just agree to be friends?!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Taihou：</span><br>
This has nothing to do with back then. This is about protecting my dear, sweet, beloved Commander...<br>
Make trouble for my Commander and I'll end you.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Albacore：</span><br>
Okay okay! I get it! I won't steal away the Commander!<br>
Call back your planes already! You're scaring the Manjuus.<br>
Phew... You gave me a heart attack.<br>
Anyway, Taihou, you wanna go out to the festival with me?<br>
On my way over here I saw some kind of aircraft carrier competition going on.<br>
And you know at a big event like that, there's a pretty good chance of running into the Commander~<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Taihou：</span><br>
Oh... i-is that right? I might be able to stand going with you...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Albacore：</span><br>
Yaaaaay~<br>

<br>
Chapter 4: The Festival<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Albacore：</span><br>
So this is for the big cooking competition. It's tomorrow, but they got it all set up already.<br>
And over here's... Some kinda... "Swimsuit Competition"? Reeaally?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Taihou：</span><br>
You sure seem to know a lot for someone who only just joined the fleet.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Albacore：</span><br>
Ehehee. I'm just making sure I'm gonna have a good time at this festival. Of course, I did my homework~<br>
You see how sad it is you've cooped yourself up in your room like that, Taihou?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Taihou：</span><br>
I have only one goal for this festival: To wear a handmade dress to the party and share a beautiful evening with my Commander! Nothing else matters.<br>
Oh, what's that sound?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Albacore：</span><br>
I think it's... music? Oh! It's Fubuki and U-81! I almost didn't recognize them in those outfits... Hey, Fubuki!!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Fubuki：</span><br>
Achoo! ... Did somebody call me?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Albacore：</span><br>
Over heeeeere!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">U-81：</span><br>
Oh, she's from the submarine squadron! Come on, Fubuki!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Fubuki：</span><br>
Hey, wait up! I'm hauling this huge tuba, I can't run that fa–<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Albacore：</span><br>
What the heck is that thing, Fubuki?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Fubuki：</span><br>
Oh, it's a tuba. Amazon's been putting together an orchestra to play at the party. It sounded fun, so here I am.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Taihou：</span><br>
(Heh heh, an orchestra, huh? Perfect. A beautiful symphony will provide accompaniment to the union of Taihou and her Commander.)<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">U-81：</span><br>
Huh? You know how to play the tuba?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Fubuki：</span><br>
Nope!<br>
... Errrm but I've been practicing a lot! Don't look at me like that!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Albacore：</span><br>
Um... Oh! There's some kind of Martial Arts Tournament thingy that's about to start! Let's go watch!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Taihou：</span><br>
Hrmph, you keep wasting the time I should be using to prepare my dress for my Commander. Not to mention... Hey! Wait for me!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Fubuki&U81：</span><br>
... Why are those two together?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Aoba：</span><br>
And that's the end!! While Zuikaku made a good showing and looked like she was set to take the crown, the grand champ herself, Enterprise, came in and crushed her dreams!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Albacore：</span><br>
The crowd's going wild... Looks like we're late.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Taihou：</span><br>
My Commander? Hmph... No. Not here. I know my Commander's scent (sniff) and it's not here.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Fubuki：</span><br>
Toot toot!! Yeaaah! Victory tubaaaaa!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">U-81：</span><br>
Oww... Can you chill with the tuba, Fubuki? I couldn't even hear who won.<br>
Wait... is that... Essex?<br>

Chapter 5: Essex and Enterprise<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Essex：</span><br>
... I guess I still can't beat you.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Enterprise：</span><br>
Don't tell me you're giving up?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Essex：</span><br>
Enterprise...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Enterprise：</span><br>
Did you really think you'd just brute force it? Roll on through the tournament right up to me and push me over?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Essex：</span><br>
... I never thought it'd be easy, but I definitely thought I'd at least make it to the end...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Enterprise：</span><br>
Life is a highway. Along the way, you'll meet all kinds of people, learn all kinds of things you never knew.<br>
Just look at our fleet. You've got so many different personalities, abilities, and experiences all around you.<br>
I've been here this long and even I can't say for sure that I'm stronger than everyone else.<br>
My point is, I want you to interact with your peers more. Get to know everyone, from every angle.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Essex：</span><br>
……<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Albacore：</span><br>
Enterprise is so dang cool!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Enterprise：</span><br>
Huh? What are you all doing here?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">U-81：</span><br>
For the competition, of course! We Iron Bloods can learn so much from observation alone!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Fubuki：</span><br>
I was just watching Zuikaku. I didn't think the Sakura Empire would have so many aircraft carriers here.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Taihou：</span><br>
(Hmph. To think she's so friendly with that Grey Ghost...) None of my business...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Enterprise：</span><br>
But your "state-of-the-art armored carrier" Taihou didn't participate? What a shame.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Taihou：</span><br>
Seemed boring to me.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Essex：</span><br>
(Who would've thought colleagues from different camps could just talk to each other like this... wild...)<br>
I understand. You mean that if I want to surpass you, Enterprise, I have to find my place in this fleet, and draw strength from my peers... right?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Enterprise：</span><br>
Yeah... I think you got it.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Essex：</span><br>
But like, making friends and whatever, that's kind of...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Fubuki：</span><br>
Hey! Don't be so high strung! It's a festival!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Essex：</span><br>
Huh?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">U-81：</span><br>
But of course! Everyone worked so hard on this festival, you've got to dive in and enjoy yourself. Isn't that right, Taihou?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Taihou：</span><br>
Wait a minute! Don't you get me mixed up in this!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Albacore：</span><br>
Where's the harm? The more the merrier!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Essex：</span><br>
... I get it. I'm supposed to go out and have fun with everyone today!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Taihou：</span><br>
... Hmph. Yeah, sure, whatever.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Akashi：</span><br>
Gotcha, nya! You're the one who left that smoke bomb, nya!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Albacore：</span><br>
Aiee! Akashi caught up to me!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">U-81：</span><br>
She looks furious! What the heck did you do?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Albacore：</span><br>
No time to explain! Skedaddle!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Essex：</span><br>
Whaaaaa?!?!<br>
<br>
And so the raucous festival continued...<br>
