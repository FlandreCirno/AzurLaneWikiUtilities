East Méditerranée - International Canal<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Kaga：</span><br>
To think that there was a time when one could not access the Méditerranée through this canal...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Yuubari：</span><br>
Mm, it’s a bit of a miracle isn’t it? A supposedly neutral canal where anyone can pass through, regardless of their alliances.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Yukikaze：</span><br>
What’s so unusual about that? Yukikaze the Great goes wherever she pleases anyway.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Jintsuu：</span><br>
The situation here is rather complicated. Despite most of the ocean being hotly contested between various factions, this incredibly important canal is largely free from such power struggles.<br>
Of course, this Canal has changed hands many times as a result of these geopolitical disputes.<br>
If matters were left in the hands of the Iron Blood, Sardegnia, and the Royal Navy, all-out war would’ve broken out.<br>
With the Sirens’ appearance and the formation of the Azur Lane, the use and maintenance of this canal was converted into a public, international project. That has persisted even after the establishment of the Crimson Axis.<br>
This canal arguably serves as a symbol of peace for humanity, and represents the joint front against the Sirens.<br>
Of course, that makes it a rather unique case in this world. Once we pass this canal, though, I’m sure we’ll still see this conflict play out in full force.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Yuubari：</span><br>
So, what’s the state of the power struggle in the Méditerranée?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Akagi：</span><br>
It’s a mess. Nominally, it’s under the control of the Vichya and the Iron Blood, but the Royal Navy has been expanding their influence.<br>
Though Operation Siren has begun, the machinations of the leadership of the Azur Lane and the Crimson Axis ultimately will not change.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Yuubari：</span><br>
So that’s why you sent the 5th CarDiv the long way around...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Yukikaze：</span><br>
(What... I thought that was just the usual course of crane bullying!)<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Akagi：</span><br>
Heh~ They’re our X-factor, so it’s only natural for them to arrive fashionably late. If we sailed our entire fleet through neutral waters, we’d be broadcasting our intentions to the whole world.<br>
Besides, the Royal Navy’s leadership is going to be wary of us. Whatever they might have up their sleeves, we must have our own response.<br>
Most importantly though, we’re in hostile waters. Draw too much attention to ourselves, and we might have to battle our way to Sardegna.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Jintsuu：</span><br>
Akagi, are you truly in support of Operation Siren? After all, if the Eagle Union is going to be operating in the NA Ocean, the “Grey Ghost” won’t be...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Akagi：</span><br>
An excellent question, Jintsuu.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Jintsuu：</span><br>
I don’t mean to question your intentions, if you do not want to answer—<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Akagi：</span><br>
It’s not that complicated. The Sirens indeed are our common enemy, and the contents of the ceasefire agreement pose no detriment to the Sakura Empire.<br>
We’ll continue our investigation of Siren technology while gathering information about the other factions.<br>
But the most worthwhile prize of all... will be there as well.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Yukikaze：</span><br>
Are you talking about the Commander?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Akagi：</span><br>
...Ahem. There must be a deeper reason why the Sirens are suddenly retreating.<br>
Bismarck and her cohorts did pass me a lot of valuable information, but... As you know, things are never quite as they seem when dealing with the Iron Blood.<br>
Outsiders are outsiders after all. Nobody else will fight for the future of the Sakura Empire.<br>
I shall reveal the secrets of this ocean with my own two hands~ Ahahaha...<br>

<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Littorio：</span><br>
Welcome to the Méditerranée, my lovely ladies. I am Littorio, from the Sardegna Empire. You must all be weary from your long journey~<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Akagi：</span><br>
It’s a pleasure to meet you. But I must ask, Littorio of Sardegna...<br>
I was told that the Azur Lane would have representatives here at this negotiation, but why have I not seen them yet?<br>
Did they have nobody to send here because they’re too focused on Operation Siren?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Littorio：</span><br>
Maybe they’re too busy enjoying the splendors of Sardegna?~<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Akagi：</span><br>
.......<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Littorio：</span><br>
To be frank, because the negotiations are taking place at a Crimson Axis-controlled port, I believe the point was to bring as few ships as possible, as to not incense the various leaders.<br>
After all, we have just launched a historic attack against the Sirens, the collective enemy of humanity. Isn’t it only natural to seek a treaty that would put aside our differences?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Akagi：</span><br>
Indeed, Littorio, it’s just as you say. This war will determine the factions that have the right to live.<br>
The very essence, the beating heart of Siren technology will soon be laid bare before us. Is there any human selfless enough to forego such power?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Littorio：</span><br>
About that... Well, it seems that the Queen of the Royal Navy is about to arrive. Perhaps that is a question you’d like to ask her personally.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Akagi：</span><br>
An interesting suggestion. I’ll consider it.<br>
And what about you, Littorio? Would the Sirens’ technology not bear rich fruit for the people of Sardegna?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Littorio：</span><br>
We wish to reclaim our birthright, the Méditerranée, in its entirety. That’s the reason we’re still in the Crimson Axis.~<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Akagi：</span><br>
Heh, an understandable sentiment. But enough about us — let’s talk about the Sirens.<br>
We came across quite a few Sirens on our way, as you may know. Weak as they were, what does Sardegna plan to do about this show of... negligence?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Kaga：</span><br>
I always thought the Sirens had little interest in the Méditerranée. Have their plans changed recently?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Littorio：</span><br>
I wouldn’t say that their plans have changed, but rather, the situation has changed.<br>
The Méditerranée is naturally well-protected, making a large-scale Siren invasion extremely difficult as long as the points of entry are guarded.<br>
As for the ones responsible for this defense, from the perspective of the Royal Navy, they are in charge of defending the western entrance while Sardegna is in charge of the east.<br>
Since the announcement of Operation Siren, the Royal Navy’s fleets have thinned out, allowing more stray Sirens through.<br>
As a sign of goodwill, the Royal Navy lifted their blockade - but in that process, also let more Sirens through.<br>
Of course, there is little to be worried about. I have personally formed a fleet to eliminate the stragglers, as they are not welcome in these waters.<br>
But let us tarry here no longer, my beautiful Signorinas. The fine wine and delicacies of Taranto await.<br>

<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Littorio：</span><br>
Behold, the wondrous port of Taranto. ...Ah, did the Royal Navy arrive before us?<br>
My sincerest apologies for being absent to greet Her Majesty’s arrival.<br>
<span style="color:#ffd000;">Queen Elizabeth：</span><br>
There’s no need for formalities. I know the Méditerranée like the back of my hand, and I could easily sail to Taranto blindfolded.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Littorio：</span><br>
I see... You don’t look like you came from sightseeing though. Did something happen on the way?<br>
<span style="color:#ffd000;">Queen Elizabeth：</span><br>
Oh, nothing out of the ordinary. Just the usual stuff with the Crimson Axis ports not allowing me to enter. It definitely wasn’t a waste of my time at all.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Littorio：</span><br>
I am sorry to hear that. Even for a purpose that is supposed to transcend allegiances and factions, to think that there still are those who will not open their ports...<br>
<span style="color:#ffd000;">Queen Elizabeth：</span><br>
I see the Sakura Empire is here as well. Will Akagi be the representative?<br>
(Well, Akagi would be the one negotiating even if Nagato was here. I must say, I was hoping to see Yamato though...)<br>
Good day, Akagi. Have the leaders of the Sakura Empire given you full authority to conduct these negotiations?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Akagi：</span><br>
Hmm... I seem to hear someone calling my name, but...<br>
Oh, it’s the little queen of the Royal Navy. I apologize for not noticing you given your... stature, Your Majesty.<br>
As for the question you asked earlier... surely the Royal Navy’s intelligence-gathering capabilities have not sunk to such pitiable levels if we are to take on the Sirens.<br>
<span style="color:#ffd000;">Queen Elizabeth：</span><br>
Why you...!<br>
<span style="color:#ffd000;">King George V：</span><br>
Our resources have indeed been a bit strained... but we will rectify our shortcomings. Perhaps we should consult the Eagle Union, since you said that about them as well before the events of Operation AF.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Akagi：</span><br>
Heh, you...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Littorio：</span><br>
Now now, everyone, let’s calm down~ We’re all here for the sake of peace, so why don’t we set this aside for now?<br>
We’ll begin the negotiations when the Iron Blood arrives. Until then, please enjoy everything Taranto has to offer.~<br>

{{折叠面板|标题=Leaving Midway|选项=4|主框=1|样式=primary|展开=否}}
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Kaga：</span><br>
Sister, are you just going to leave Taranto like that?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Akagi：</span><br>
We’ve already finished what we came for. Besides, who knows how long we’ll be stuck here if we get caught up with that crowd...<br>
(It wasn’t easy to successfully forge a treaty, but we’ll lose sight of our original purpose if we stay here too long...)<br>
(Wine, food, and endless merriment... does Sardegna not even realize that we’re in a race against time?)<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Kaga：</span><br>
It seems like Sardegna doesn’t want to get their hands dirty. Are they not planning to do anything unless war comes to their doorsteps?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Akagi：</span><br>
...In any case, we’ve finished resupplying and the treaty’s been signed. There will be plenty of time for celebrations once Operation Siren is over.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Yukikaze：</span><br>
I think that scary lady from the Iron Blood was going to spend some extra time at Sardegna... Do all those people have no sense of urgency...?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Akagi：</span><br>
Though this was my first time dealing with her face-to-face, I could tell from a glance exactly what kind of person she is. Though she seems to be sitting around, she’s always planning three or four steps ahead.<br>
(I’m sure she’s planning to make her next move while everyone’s attention is focused on the NA Ocean.)<br>
(There’s no telling what that person is thinking. We’re not negotiating on our turf here, and there’s no way we’d be able to get away with those kinds of tactics.)<br>
(I’m glad I sent the 5th CarDiv out after us. We’ve come too far to go back home empty-handed.)<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Jintsuu：</span><br>
Did you notice that Queen Elizabeth was even in more of a hurry to leave than we were?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Akagi：</span><br>
They seemed very troubled by Tirpitz’s sudden appearance in the NA Ocean... In any case, that also gave us an opportunity to leave as well.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Jintsuu：</span><br>
Everyone seems to be looking for something... Do we even know for sure that it’s there?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Akagi：</span><br>
Are you doubting my information?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Jintsuu：</span><br>
No, of course not... Are we going to head into the NA Ocean as well then?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Akagi：</span><br>
No, we need to make a visit to the Vichya Dominon’s port of Dakar first.<br>
After all, I’m dying to find out about the “present” the Iron Blood prepared for us. Ahaha...<br>
{{折叠面板|内容结束}}

{{折叠面板|标题=Dakar|选项=5|主框=1|样式=primary|展开=否}}
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Kaga：</span><br>
Is that Dakar up ahead? I heard that this one of the Vichya Dominion’s most important ports, but it looks rather deserted...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Jintsuu：</span><br>
That’s true. I don’t see any ships here from either the Vichya or the Iron Blood.<br>
Or rather, I shouldn’t say that there aren’t any. I think that’s destroyer coming towards us is a messenger from the Iron Blood.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Z2：</span><br>
Welcome to Dakar. I am the destroyer, Z2, and I have been assigned to wait for your arrival.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Yukikaze：</span><br>
Huh? You’re our entire welcoming committee?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Z2：</span><br>
Yes, I’m the only one here right now at Dakar. But, you’re not here to inspect the Iron Blood fleet, are you?<br>
Let’s talk business. This way, please.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Akagi：</span><br>
That’s the Iron Blood efficiency I want to see.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Yuubari：</span><br>
Woah, is this an Iron Blood research lab? Now this piques my interest!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Akagi：</span><br>
I see, this is a more reductionist view of the Wisdom Cube. Purely empirical, unlike the more metaphysical approach we take in our research.<br>
(A modular, large-scale dock. Energy absorption devices. Adaptive bioengineered rigging. Communication equipment resistant to EM attacks. Even “imitations” of Mirror Seas...)<br>
Yuubari, do you think there’s anything here you’d be able to use?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Yuubari：</span><br>
You bet! I have plenty of ideas I’m dying to try out as soon as we get back!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Akagi：</span><br>
(The Iron Blood seems to have successfully extracted much from the Sirens... But us, on the other hand...)<br>
(Nay... If there’s something you want, you must seize it yourself...)<br>
{{折叠面板|内容结束}}

{{折叠面板|标题=Solo Operation|选项=6|主框=1|样式=primary|展开=否}}
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Akagi：</span><br>
The Iron Blood doesn’t seem to be coming. Is this their idea of a joint operation?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Z2：</span><br>
I’m not sure exactly what Friedrich is planning, but our main fleet has also moved to the NA Ocean. If everyone’s operating in the same area, doesn’t that technically qualify as a joint operation?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Kaga：</span><br>
Where’s your main fleet then, and what are they doing?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Z2：</span><br>
I’m sorry, but I’m not privy to that information. I’m just a destroyer who was told to stay behind.<br>
If Prinz Eugen was here, I’m sure she’d know something...<br>
Otherwise, I would go ask Friedrich directly. She should still be staying behind in Sardegna.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Kaga：</span><br>
...We just left Taranto. Are you saying we should just turn back?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Z2：</span><br>
Ah, sorry, you can just use the communicator. That should do just fine.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Akagi：</span><br>
It’s fine, there’s no need for that. The Sakura Empire has more than enough power to complete this operation. If you’re not willing to cooperate with us, your actions are also of little concern to us.<br>
We will head out when our ships are resupplied.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Z2：</span><br>
Very well, I’ll start making the arrangements. Are you sure you want to leave so soon though? We scheduled a demonstration of some our technology tomorrow...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Kaga：</span><br>
We appreciate the sentiment, but time is of the essence. Yuubari, if there’s anything you’d like to see here, you’re welcome to stay behind.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Z2：</span><br>
I’m sorry I could not meet your expectations.<br>
Let me try to get in contact with Bismark or Friedrich first. I’ll try to let you know if they share any information about where our main fleet is.<br>
If you’d like, please take this cutting-edge Iron Blood communication device with you.<br>
This device should have higher resistance to the Sirens’ jamming attacks, so I hope you will find it useful.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Akagi：</span><br>
Will this be able to counteract the jamming effect of the Mirror Seas?<br>
And just to make sure, you have no objections to us bringing this back to the Sakura Empire, right?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Z2：</span><br>
Correct, it’s yours to keep. Consider it our gift.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Kaga：</span><br>
Thank you very much.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Z2：</span><br>
No problem. Please follow me to the resupply and maintenance area.<br>

<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Yukikaze：</span><br>
Look at how these enemies crumble before Yukikaze the Great!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Akagi：</span><br>
The Sirens here are much weaker than what the data suggested.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Jintsuu：</span><br>
Yes, their lack of resistance is almost uncanny. If they’re consolidating their forces in one area, one would expect a tougher fight, yet we’ve already taken back so much territory.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Yukikaze：</span><br>
Yeah, there’s even a big red danger mark on the map here. What gives?<br>
Heh, I get it now! My luck has once again made the enemy completely miss us!~<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Kaga：</span><br>
That may be true... but we’ve never seen so many Siren research facilities packed so densely together before.<br>
And because this zone lies just outside the Azur Lane’s operation range, these facilities are largely intact still. We truly did luck out this time.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Akagi：</span><br>
Indeed. Yuubari, collect a Siren sample to bring back home. Once we get back to the Sakura Empire, you can experiment with it as much as you’d like.<br>
Make it quick though. There are greater rewards waiting for us ahead.<br>
{{折叠面板|内容结束}}

{{折叠面板|标题=Incursion|选项=8|主框=1|样式=primary|展开=否}}
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Jintsuu：</span><br>
Akagi, don’t you think we’ve rushed in a bit too deep?<br>
We haven’t encountered significant resistance from the Sirens yet, but the intensity of their counterattacks is gradually increasing.<br>
If this trend continues, we can expect to run into a large Siren defensive force ahead. Even the Azur Lane has stopped pushing forward and is now focusing on establishing forward bases. Should we wait for the 5th CarDiv before continuing?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Akagi：</span><br>
No, we press forth precisely because the Azur Lane has stopped attacking. As I said, this is a race against time.<br>
Even if the enemies are a bit tougher, it’s nothing we can’t handle. We haven’t even encountered a Mirror Sea so far.<br>
What sets us apart from the Azur Lane is our decisiveness. No risk, no reward. Those who are afraid to take the initiative will also see their opportunities snatched away.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Jintsuu：</span><br>
Point taken, but how about contacting them at least? Why not decide on a point of attack, and have them cooperate with our advance?<br>
Once we join up, we’ll be able to push even farther into Siren territory.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Akagi：</span><br>
So be it. If they are worthy of their names, they will be here anyway.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Jintsuu：</span><br>
Very well, I’ll get in touch with them.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Akagi：</span><br>
All units, stay in formation and advance!<br>

<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Yukikaze：</span><br>
...Eh? Where’d all this fog come from?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Jintsuu：</span><br>
We’d be lucky if it was just that simple. Any sudden environmental change while we’re in Siren-controlled waters should be considered an anomaly. Stay vigilant, everyone.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Yuubari：</span><br>
Ugh... My navigation instruments are spinning around like crazy and all the readings are going haywire... Akagi, we’re getting jammed!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Communicator：</span><br>
BZZT————ZZZZZZZ——————<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Yukikaze：</span><br>
Hwuh?! Why’d the communicator start screeching?!<br>
Someone’s trying to say something... But I can’t make it out through all the static...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Yuubari：</span><br>
Even the anti-jamming communicator we got from the Iron Blood is acting up... Is it really impossible to overcome the Siren interference?<br>
Also, what’s this voice-like noise coming from the communicator? I really need to tinker this thing around thoroughly...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Jintsuu：</span><br>
Anomalous weather and jammed communications... I’m afraid we’ve wandered into a Mirror Sea. Sooner or later, an armada of Sirens is going to show up.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Kaga：</span><br>
Sister, the situational clearly is abnormal. We should slow down and survey the situation first... Sister?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Akagi：</span><br>
This fog... Could it be......?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">{{AF|Kaga}}：</span><br>
Akagi, what’s happening to you?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Akagi：</span><br>
Ah, sorry, I got lost in my thoughts. What were you saying?<br>
....Kaga? Where are you?<br>
Kaga? Jintsuu?! ...Yuubari! Yukikaze!<br>
...What in the world just happened...?<br>

<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Akagi：</span><br>
The smell of gunpowder in the air... I’ve been here before... Mid...way...?<br>
Yes... Yes... It is! I remember, this is Operation AF! That Grey Ghost is here!<br>
Damnit... Had it not been for you, the Eagle Union would have been powerless to stop us in the Pacific... It’s all your fault, Grey Ghost...!<br>
Because of you... I, Akagi... was ignobly defeated...<br>
Soryuu... Hiryuu... Kaga... Even the memories of my sister...<br>
It’s your fault... You took everything from me...<br>
I won’t forgive you... I’ll never forgive you... Grey Ghost! Damn you...!<br>
<span style="color:#ec5d53;">Enterprise?：</span><br>
You still remember me. I’m honored.<br>
<span style="color:#ec5d53;">Hornet?：</span><br>
That was a damn exciting battle! Your leadership was top notch!~<br>
<span style="color:#ec5d53;">Yorktown?：</span><br>
Indeed. You still want to take your revenge on us, right? Then come and fight us, forevermore.<br>
<span style="color:#ec5d53;">Enterprise?：</span><br>
Even after you returned, you seemed to blame everything on the Five Minutes of Fate. But given five days, five years, five eternities... What could you possibly do?<br>
<span style="color:#ec5d53;">Hornet?：</span><br>
You cannot escape fate... the fate engraved upon your hull. Fate is not so fragile, unlike that little amulet your sister gave you~<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Akagi：</span><br>
Shut up! Shut up! You’ve all come before me to die... And I’ve been waiting to send you all to hell! Ahahahaha!!<br>
<span style="color:#ec5d53;">Enterprise?：</span><br>
Come, Akagi... This time, nobody will keep you from your revenge. Not the Sirens. Not the Sakura Empire. Not the Eagle Union. And not Amagi.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Akagi：</span><br>
I’ll run you through for underestimating me, Grey Ghost! My entire life, I’ve lived for this moment... The chance to sink you myself!<br>
The strong devour the weak... The fit survive... Such is the nature of... this...<br>

<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Kaga(BB)：</span><br>
Akagi! Yuubari! Jintsuu! Yukikaze! Where are you?!<br>
(Impossible... How did everyone just disappear? But, I should consider myself lucky for not getting attacked...)<br>
(It’s impossible for me to operate my aircraft in this thick fog...)<br>
(Wait... This weightiness... I’m... no longer an aircraft carrier...?)<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Amagi?：</span><br>
It’s been a while, Kaga. It seems like you’ve finally grown up, strong enough to sail the seas with the Sakura fleet.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Kaga(BB)：</span><br>
A...magi...?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Amagi?：</span><br>
How is my little sister doing? I trust that you’ve been taking good care of her like I asked?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Kaga(BB)：</span><br>
Right now, she’s...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Amagi?：</span><br>
Gone? That’s right, I should have been the one to be at her side. Not you.<br>
Ah, how I regret the decision I made back then. Look what has happened to my Akagi, to my Sakura Empire. All because of you, Kaga...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Kaga(BB)：</span><br>
Because of... me...?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Amagi?：</span><br>
I’m disappointed in you, Kaga.<br>
<br>
KABOOM————————!!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Kaga(BB)：</span><br>
Guh....!！<br>
<span style="color:#ec5d53;">Amagi?：</span><br>
If I destroy you here, I’ll be able to see my sister again.<br>
What happened to the proud and mighty Kaga I once knew? Are those guns you carry just for show?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Kaga(BB)：</span><br>
...Don’t mess with me, Siren! Amagi would never say these kinds of things! I have no idea who you are, but you’re going to shut your mouth!<br>
Graahhhhh!!<br>
<br>
KABOOM————————!!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Zuikaku：</span><br>
Ehhh?! Kaga?! Why’d you suddenly start shooting at me?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Yukikaze：</span><br>
Woah, that was close. Good thing I didn’t run up any closer...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Kaga：</span><br>
Huh? Zuikaku...?<br>
Amagi... Where’d Amagi go? I was just firing at her...<br>
Firing... No, that can’t be... It’s been ages since I became a carrier. And Amagi, she’s already... What’s going on?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Zuikaku：</span><br>
What’s going on?! That’s supposed to be my line!<br>
When you entered this area, you suddenly got caught up in a Mirror Sea. We tried calling out to you, but that’s when you attacked us!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Shoukaku：</span><br>
I know you don’t like us, but luring us out here to get rid of us in an “accident” is a really unfunny joke, Kaga~<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Kaga：</span><br>
That hurts, Shoukaku... More importantly, did you find the others?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Zuikaku：</span><br>
We rushed over after Jintsuu used her foxfires to call out to us.<br>
However, when we arrived, we found the entire ocean surface coated with this thick fog.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Yamashiro：</span><br>
I started getting a bad, bad feeling about that fog as soon as I heard about it.<br>
I wasn’t sure if I wanted to head in, and that’s when I saw Yukikaze coming out!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Kaga：</span><br>
Yukikaze, you managed to escape from the fog by yourself...?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Yukikaze：</span><br>
Yukikaze the Great has no idea what happened either! I was just sailing about when everyone suddenly vanished into the fog!<br>
I went around looking for everyone, and next thing you know, I was out of the fog and right there in front of Yamashiro and Shoukaku’s fleet.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Kaga：</span><br>
...........<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Kongou：</span><br>
We decided to wait outside at first, but nobody else was leaving the fog.<br>
At that point, we had no choice but to head in to look for everyone... and that’s when we ran into you.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Kaga：</span><br>
...I’m truly sorry. I let myself be deceived by the Sirens’ illusions... Or rather, I still haven’t managed to sort through my own memories all this time....<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Yamashiro：</span><br>
So basically, everyone covered by this fog is showed some kind of illusion as if they’re trapped in a dream? What do you think, Kongou?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Kongou：</span><br>
That, coupled with the jamming effect, basically confirms that this is no natural phenomenon.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Shoukaku：</span><br>
We haven’t been affected so far, but that’s not to say we won’t get attacked if we stay too long. Let’s rescue the others as fast as we can.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Yukikaze：</span><br>
Crap...! I just realized, what if the others are going through the same thing Kaga was? We have to find them quickly!<br>

<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Yuubari：</span><br>
Thanks for rescuing me... According to my research, this sea fog definitely has a hallucinogenic component, which is responsible for giving us illusions.<br>
As for why it didn’t affect Yukikaze... Maybe she was lucky enough to get out of it before it could affect her. Or maybe she doesn’t have enough going on in her head for the Sirens to toy with...<br>
I definitely will have to look into this further...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Zuikaku：</span><br>
Calm down, Yuubari! You only just came out of your hallucination, so rest up first!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Yukikaze：</span><br>
Look up ahead, it’s Jintsuu! Yukikaze the Great is coming to rescue you!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Zuikaku：</span><br>
Safety first, Yukikaze! She might start attacking because of her hallucinations just like Kaga.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Yukikaze：</span><br>
Heheh~ Just leave it to me!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Jintsuu：</span><br>
...No, we shouldn’t talk of this plan any more. All we need to do is to focus and charge forward.<br>
I can’t accept that. I can’t do something like that.<br>
I’m honored to hear you say that, but...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Yukikaze：</span><br>
...She doesn’t seem any different to me... W-woah, those flames definitely aren’t normal!<br>
They’re definitely going to come after me if I get too close... So, I’ll land the first blow!<br>
Wait, wait... What am I going to do if I accidentally hit Jintsuu?<br>
Maybe I’ll aim a bit to the side then... Hmm, maybe I should just call out to her with a loudspeaker or something...<br>
What about a signal flare? ...That’s probably out. Wouldn’t want the Sirens to gather around here...<br>
All right, I’ll go with the first plan! Loudspeaker it is!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Jintsuu：</span><br>
...Yukikaze, what are you doing here alone?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Yukikaze：</span><br>
J-Jintsuu! Y-you’re back to normal?!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Jintsuu：</span><br>
So everything that happened was an illusion after all... Ugh, my head hurts... Why are you the only one here? Where are the others?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Yukikaze：</span><br>
We’ve found everyone except Akagi! Let’s head back and look for her together!<br>

<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Zuikaku：</span><br>
That’s Akagi over there, isn’t it? I can’t see clearly from this ditance though...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Shoukaku：</span><br>
No, that’s definitely Akagi all right. Nobody else would bomb the empty sea surface repeatedly while cackling maniacally.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Kaga：</span><br>
...I wonder if I was also like that...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Kongou：</span><br>
Well, y’know...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Kaga：</span><br>
How disgraceful...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Yamashiro：</span><br>
Eh? Look, there’s someone else next to Akagi!<br>
But Akagi doesn’t even seem to notice...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Zuikaku：</span><br>
That rigging... is that a Siren?!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Kaga：</span><br>
It must be. But we’ve never seen any Siren like that before...<br>
As far as I can tell, it’s just observing rather than trying to attack...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Kongou：</span><br>
This whole thing feels surreal...<br>
<span style="color:#ec5d53;">？？？：</span><br>
Ahaha... Do you think so too?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Yukikaze：</span><br>
Woah! It’s speaking directly into my head?! Does anyone else hear that?!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Yuubari：</span><br>
I think it’s using vibrations in the particles of water in the sea fog to communicate....<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Zuikaku：</span><br>
That Siren must be the one behind the creation of this Mirror Sea!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Shoukaku：</span><br>
I do know one thing for certain though. We’re going to have to defeat that Siren if we want to rescue Akagi...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Zuikaku：</span><br>
Let’s get moving then. Shoukaku, Kaga, attack the Siren with me draw its attention away. Yukikaze, Jintsuu, bring Akagi back safely!<br>
Are you fine with that, Kaga?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Kaga：</span><br>
No objections. Prepare for combat - we have no room for error.<br>

<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Shoukaku：</span><br>
I don’t think I’m landing a single hit... Zuikaku, what about you?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Zuikaku：</span><br>
Same here, sis! Just when my torpedoes and bombs are about to hit, it’s as if there’s something else in the way!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Jintsuu：</span><br>
Everyone, Akagi’s starting to wake up! Zuikaku, Shoukaku, fall back! We’ll take this fight another time!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Akagi：</span><br>
Damnit... This Siren’s going to burn... for making a fool out of me!!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Kaga：</span><br>
Akagi, look... The Siren’s already gone.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Yamashiro：</span><br>
Did it decide to retreat...?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Jintsuu：</span><br>
The fog isn’t receding though. If anything, it’s getting even thicker. We have to get out of here quickly.<br>
Yukikaze, do you still remember the direction you went in to leave this—<br>
<br>
KABOOM————————!!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Yukikaze：</span><br>
Woahhhh!! Everyone, there’s another Siren over here!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Jintsuu：</span><br>
Akagi... We can’t advance any further... We need to pull back!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Zuikaku：</span><br>
This is a reminder as to why the Sirens are so dangerous... They’ll never allow themselves to be pawns in your plans.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Akagi：</span><br>
We’re almost there... If we work together, then...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Zuikaku：</span><br>
I refuse, Akagi.<br>
We used up all our ammo back there fighting the other Siren. There’s no way we’d be able to deal with all the enemies that lurk ahead.<br>
Besides, there’s something else about this fog... Look, it’s already happening. You can feel the fog eating into your rigging, can’t you?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Kongou：</span><br>
Yuubari just told me, this fog also has corrosive qualities!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Zuikaku：</span><br>
We’re going to get annihilated at this rate, Akagi. We already got the Siren sample we came for, so let’s head back to Dakar.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Kaga：</span><br>
Live to fight another day, huh? Sister, Zuikaku is right.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Akagi：</span><br>
Very well... Turn back and head towards Dakar... But heed my words, Siren, we’ll be back!<br>
<br>
The azure horn sounds across the ocean.	<br>
To which the crimson shadow dances deliriously.	<br>
Four blades point towards darkness, lit by ember and ash.	<br>
Who programs those who arbitrate beneath the maelstrom of secrecy?	 <br>
For all that the surface conceals shall be laid before the abyss.	<br>
