Chapter 1: Greetings and Meetings?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Nagato：</span><br>
Mhm... That should be the last item on the shopping list.<br>
"Lady Nagato, you mustn't sully your hands with common work; please leave it to us and return to the castle."<br>
Kawakaze and the others can be so stiff at times... I, too, wish to assist everyone in the New Year's preparations.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Friedrich der Große：</span><br>
The Guardian Fox of the Sakura Empire... perhaps us meeting here is a "sign" of the things to come.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Nagato：</span><br>
Friedrich der Große of the Iron Blood... Hmm, what in the world is with that outfit...?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Friedrich der Große：</span><br>
Yes, this is a kimono from your own Sakura Empire. Exquisitely crafted, comfortable to the touch, and elegantly designed, this is indeed a product of the highest caliber.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Nagato：</span><br>
(Since when did they make kimonos that looked like this...?!)<br>
(First Akagi, then St. Louis... Now everyone is dressing like this...? Ugh... I feel like I've lost something valuable...)<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Southampton：</span><br>
Huh? Lady Friedrich der Große of the Iron Blood? Lady Nagato of the Sakura Empire?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Nagato：</span><br>
Geh?! ...Ahem! You're from the Royal Maids?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Southampton：</span><br>
Um... former maid... That place was a bit too hectic for me~<br>
I'm now one of the Royal Knights!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Nagato：</span><br>
I see...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Friedrich der Große：</span><br>
You're also dressed in a kimono... The Royal Navy also seems to come prepared...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Southampton：</span><br>
I am honoured by your praise! Lady Friedrich der Große, your appearance is also... most striking...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Nagato：</span><br>
I am glad that both of your factions have taken interest in our customs. As such, I welcome you both to come to our shrine to celebrate Shougatsu with us.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Friedrich der Große：</span><br>
Shougatsu...? If I recall, that was the Sakura Empire's ceremony to welcome in the coming year?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Southampton：</span><br>
Oh, Cleveland mentioned something about that and a sport called "hanetsuki," right? I somehow ended up being dragged in to serve as a referee.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Nagato：</span><br>
(Th-they're talking right past each other...! What a fearsome display of a culture gap...!)<br>
Hanetsuki sounds like f– I mean... Ahem! Perhaps if the opportunity arises...<br>

Chapter 2: Sleepy Shougatsu<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Suruga：</span><br>
Hanging out inside a kotatsu, munching on tangerines, watching some television... Yeah, that's the New Year's spirit I like...<br>
It's great not having to worry about anything, just rolling around like this all day~<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ayanami：</span><br>
The kotatsu... is truly terrifying. Ayanami is melting into it as well.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Kasumi：</span><br>
Amazing... Even Foo is melting...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Suruga：</span><br>
Yesh... this is the real melting pot... Wait a sec! Since when did you two get in here?!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ayanami：</span><br>
"Yeah, that's the New Year's spirit I like." Since that time.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Kasumi：</span><br>
"Just rolling around like this all day." Right then.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Suruga：</span><br>
Geh?! ...Wh-who'd you hear that from? It must've been your imagination!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ayanami：</span><br>
You don't have to hide anything. It is human nature to seek the comfort of a kotatsu.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Kasumi：</span><br>
"Release your inhibitions and give in to your deepest desires." That's what Foo said.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Suruga：</span><br>
That Foo character seems awfully self-interested... *sigh*...<br>
Well, I suppose all is fine. Let's retreat into the kotatsu together. Want a tangerine?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Kasumi：</span><br>
Kasumi... might want some red bean soup...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ayanami：</span><br>
Eating red bean soup inside a kotatsu...?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Suruga：</span><br>
What happened to my tangerine...? Eh? Huh?<br>

Chapter 3: New Year's Challenge!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Z35：</span><br>
Do your best, Cleveland~!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Cleveland：</span><br>
Let's see if you can handle my Golden Smash! Yah!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Hibiki：</span><br>
Too naive, Eagle Union girl! Take this!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Cleveland：</span><br>
Woahh!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Southampton：</span><br>
Ohh! Hibiki scored again!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Cleveland：</span><br>
Ahaha... You got me good there... I'll have to train harder...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Hibiki：</span><br>
Well, y'know, this is a traditional game here, so I have the home court advantage. Besides, Cleveland, weren't you the one who asked for me to go all out?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Noshiro：</span><br>
Strategic shortsightedness on your part, Cleveland.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Z35：</span><br>
Boo...! I thought this game would be a walk in the park for an athletic idol like me!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Cleveland：</span><br>
All right, all right, I admit defeat. Gotta say though, this game is a lot of fun! Seriously!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Southampton：</span><br>
I'd love to bring some of the others girls from the Royal Navy to play!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Noshiro：</span><br>
Thank you very much. Now then... Oh, Hibiki, did you tell our guests about the punishment for losing a hanetsuki match?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Hibiki：</span><br>
Of course I did~? Nihihi, this is going to be so much fun!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Both：</span><br>
Punishment? Wait...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Southampton：</span><br>
You're going to vandalize my face...?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Both：</span><br>
Ahhhhh!!<br>

Chapter 4: New Year's Training?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Kinu：</span><br>
Hyaahhhh!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Kirishima：</span><br>
That's the spirit. But you need to be even faster... like this!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Kinu：</span><br>
Gah...?! As expected, Kirishima... but in that case...!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Kirishima：</span><br>
Haha! Looks like I'm going to have to get serious!<br>
<br>
The clashing of bamboo swords continued to echo throughout the school's kendo clubroom for a while.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Nagara：</span><br>
Jeez, Kinu, we're getting ready to celebrate the New Year. It wouldn't kill you to take a day off from practice.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Kinu：</span><br>
N-Nagara?! ...I have to redouble my efforts, precisely because it is the New Year.<br>
Even more so if I have an opportunity to train with Kirishima.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Kirishima：</span><br>
It's not like I'm purposefully trying to make you train over the New Year, you know?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Nagara：</span><br>
Of course, I know that. Ehehe, here's some water, you two.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Kinu：</span><br>
*glug* *glug* ...So, what brings you here anyway?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Nagara：</span><br>
Ah, that's right. The others invited us to go with them to make an offering at the shrine. Kirishima, are you in?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Kirishima：</span><br>
Now that I think about it, I haven't even done my hatsumode yet... All right, count me in. Wait, when are we going?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Kinu：</span><br>
(At least let me finish my daily swings first...)<br>

Chapter 5: Happy New Year!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ryuuhou：</span><br>
I'll leave the Amazake over here. Also, here are some more Hamaya arrows... All right, we're about ready over here!<br>
Ah, the other camps are here. Welcome to the Sakura Empire's shrine.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Friedrich der Große：</span><br>
I see, so this is your shrine... where you pray to the gods for peace and prosperity... A custom often seen in the East.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Nagato：</span><br>
Indeed. We celebrate New Year's on the same day, but our customs are quite different.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ryuuhou：</span><br>
Lady Nagato, what brings these people here...?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Nagato：</span><br>
They're simply here to learn. Ryuuhou, your contribution here has been invaluable.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ryuuhou：</span><br>
In that case, allow me to show you around. Feel free to warm yourselves by trying this Amazake, our traditional sweet sake.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Z35：</span><br>
Sweet sake? I want to give it a little taste~<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Hibiki：</span><br>
Hibiki wants some too!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Noshiro：</span><br>
Happy New Year, everyone. Lady Nagato.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Nagato：</span><br>
Indeed. But isn't this a strange combination? Here we have girls from Iron Blood working together with the Eagle Union.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Cleveland：</span><br>
Ahahaha... I guess you can say a lot has happened...?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Kirishima：</span><br>
Woah, did you guys already start without us?<br>
And so, the Nagara-class girls... ended up helping this child look for someone.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Unicorn：</span><br>
Ah, um... has anyone seen Miss Ark Royal?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Friedrich der Große：</span><br>
I've heard of her. She can apparently be found wherever there are lots of destroyers...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Everyone：</span><br>
...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ark Royal：</span><br>
Sorry I'm late!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Unicorn：</span><br>
Miss Ark Royal!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ark Royal：</span><br>
I am here to protect the dest– ...Ahem! I mean, I'm here to keep everyone safe!<br>
My sincerest apologies, Unicorn. I got distracted and lost sight of you.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ryuuhou：</span><br>
...In any case, allow me to guide you through how to make your offerings.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Friedrich der Große：</span><br>
Everything here has been made possible by my child.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Nagato：</span><br>
Indeed. This port has been growing larger and larger by the day.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Kirishima：</span><br>
Isn't that great, Nagato? We're all getting along better and better as well.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Hibiki：</span><br>
All right, you know what that means! Let's give it our all this coming year!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Everyone：</span><br>
Yeeaah!<br>
