Chapter 1: Wake Up, Your Majesty!<br>
Port - Royal Navy Dormitory<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Queen Elizabeth：</span><br>
Zzzzzzzz...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Warspite：</span><br>
Oh... Is Her Majesty still sleeping?<br>
(She would normally be awake by now...)<br>
(Seems she went to bed too late last night.)<br>
(I'd best wake her. She has an important meeting today.)<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Queen Elizabeth：</span><br>
Nng... Warspite... Stay with me... Zzzz...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Warspite：</span><br>
(Now what shall we do about this...?)<br>
<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项1：Rouse her gently...</span>'''''<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项2：Rouse her more forcefully...</span>'''''<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Warspite：</span><br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项1）</span>'''''Your Majesty, please wake up. We have a meeting that Your Majesty absolutely must attend...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Queen Elizabeth：</span><br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项1）</span>'''''Nng... Hm? Hrmm? Warspite? You're here by my side...? Very good then...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Warspite：</span><br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项2）</span>'''''(I'm afraid this calls for harsher measures. The bedspread, for example. Your Majesty... please forgive the indiscretion.)<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项2）</span>'''''Haaaagh!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Queen Elizabeth：</span><br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项2）</span>'''''Aaaaaaieeeeee!!!<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项2）</span>'''''Wh-what is the meaning of this, Warspite?!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Queen Elizabeth：</span><br>
I must have been dreaming... Heavens, would you look at the time!<br>
Honestly, why did you not wake me sooner?! I'm going to be late!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Warspite：</span><br>
(That is the reaction I expected... But I do believe we can make the meeting on time.)<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Queen Elizabeth：</span><br>
Ahem! Now then, the Royal Navy has agreed to a second round of large-scale exercises with the Eagle Union!<br>
Warspite shall be responsible for the training and drills ahead of the exercises. I expect my Royal Navy to give a dazzling performance on the day of.<br>
Warspite, you are not to disappoint your queen! Are we understood?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Warspite：</span><br>
Yes, Your Majesty!<br>
(Seems waking up late hasn't affected Her Majesty in the slightest. She never lets these little things get to her.)<br>
Right then, I shall gladly take on the training of the Royal Navy!<br>
Becoming a proper warrior is no easy task. Steel yourselves, girls!<br>

Chapter 2: The Secretary Ship's Work<br>
Port - Office<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Warspite：</span><br>
Good morning, Commander.<br>
(Her Majesty may have put me in charge of training the fleet, but I can't neglect my duties as secretary either.)<br>
(Of course, because of how competent Commander is, my work is not very difficult.)<br>
Is there anything in particular you need today? I can handle it.<br>
You want me to tally up this month's research expenditures...? Aye-aye.<br>
That sort of thing won't take me but a moment.<br>
(First I need to dig up the files... Right... Here they are.)<br>
(Hm? They're all the way up there... Can the Commander really reach that shelf so easily...?)<br>
......<br>
(I-I can't trouble the Commander over such a trifling thing. I must do this myself!)<br>
(Argh, even on my tiptoes I'm still just short of it... Right then...)<br>
Hah!<br>
(I just need to jump up and grab it...!)<br>
Yes! Got it!<br>
<br>
(Wobble, wobble, crash!)<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Warspite：</span><br>
Bollocks!!!<br>
(Who would've thought all the other files would come crashing down like that.)<br>
Terribly sorry, Commander! I knocked them over while grabbing this document.<br>
I can't believe I've made such a base mistake! I'll get to cleaning this up straight away!<br>
(M-maybe I should have just asked the Commander for help in the first place.)<br>

Chapter 3: The Speed of the Grand Old Lady<br>
Port - Office<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Warspite：</span><br>
(Work took much longer than I anticipated thanks to that little hiccup this morning.)<br>
(Now the most important thing is getting this file into Her Majesty's hands. I need to move quickly.)<br>
... I suppose I should run then.<br>
Phew... Haah...<br>
(Almost there... I should make it just in time!)<br>
(Now why is the floor here so slippery... Did they just mop it?)<br>
(Doesn't matter. I just need to keep moving!)<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Suffolk：</span><br>
Juust whistle while you work~♪<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Warspite：</span><br>
(It's Suffolk mopping up?! Not enough room to go around her now!!)<br>
Look out! Make way!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Suffolk：</span><br>
Huh? Aaaaaaagh!<br>
<br>
(CRASH!)<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Suffolk：</span><br>
Owwwieee... Madam Warspite?!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Warspite：</span><br>
S-sorry about that...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Belfast：</span><br>
Are you two all right? Any injuries?<br>
... Suffolk, why were you mopping the hallway? Did I not ask you to clean only the meeting room?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Suffolk：</span><br>
Huuuh? Did I mop all the way to the hall already...?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Belfast：</span><br>
......<br>
Forgive her, Madam Warspite. I apologise for the trouble we have caused you.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Suffolk：</span><br>
I-I apologise...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Warspite：</span><br>
No, it was my fault as well. I shouldn't have been running down the corridor.<br>
(But... it is rather odd I always end up crashing into someone like this. I wonder if it's some kind of curse...?)<br>
(Now's not the time to think about that. I need to get this file over to- It's all wet now?!)<br>
(Aie...! I'd better go get another copy... Her Majesty won't mind if I'm a bit late...)<br>

Chapter 4: After the Exercise...<br>
Several Days Later - Exercise Area<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Warspite：</span><br>
Ahem! Our success in these joint exercises is thanks entirely to your training, your implementation of the tactics you learned, and your ability to adapt to a changing combat situation.<br>
In short, the Royal Navy seized victory not by random chance, but through the hard work and dedication of everyone here.<br>
Now it is time to rest and recuperate. Indulge yourselves in the banquet Her Majesty has graciously bestowed upon us!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">The Crowd：</span><br>
Aye-aye!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Warspite：</span><br>
(I'll step out for some fresh air.)<br>
(Ah? Who's that over there...?)<br>
Enterprise?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Enterprise：</span><br>
Warspite? Congratulations. You won the exercise.<br>
I'm still a little sore about it, honestly. I had my planes on you the whole time and I still didn't manage to sink you.<br>
We should start calling you "The Unsinkable Legend."<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Warspite：</span><br>
(So it was you behind all those planes buzzing around my head...!)<br>
(She kept me busy dodging bombs and firing ack-acks the whole time... I must've put on quite a show for the Commander...)<br>
Hah. Thanks to you, I've had my fill of planes for a while.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Enterprise：</span><br>
You wore me out plenty yourself. Nothing like the splashes from 15-inch rounds right by your feet to keep you on your toes.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Warspite：</span><br>
(... But not a single one of the shells I fired at Enterprise hit home. I guess she really is the "Lucky E".)<br>
I really must thank you and the rest of the Eagle Union for participating in these exercises. The Royal Navy learned a lot from our war games today.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Enterprise：</span><br>
If we're thanking each other, I have to say it was great for the Union side too. I'd like it if we could keep up these large-scale exercises going forward.<br>
And I look forward to sparring with you again, Warspite.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Warspite：</span><br>
That feeling is certainly mutual.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Rodney：</span><br>
Lady Warspite, I think Her Majesty is looking for you.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Warspite：</span><br>
(Her Majesty...? Then I'd best hurry back.)<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Enterprise：</span><br>
Then I won't keep you. Until next time!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Warspite：</span><br>
Indeed. Farewell.<br>
(And with that, my training assignment has come to an end, giving me a chance to rest a bit... I'll have to go enjoy the banquet with the girls. After I find out what Her Majesty wants, of course.)<br>

Chapter 5: The Small Things<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Warspite：</span><br>
Right then, let's get the work done as quickly as possible. I'll just head into the office and-<br>
What's this? Someone else in the office with the Commander...?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">？？？：</span><br>
Hehe, think nothing of it~ If there's anything else you need, please don't hesitate to call upon me, Commander.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Warspite：</span><br>
(That sounds like... Illustrious?)<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Illustrious：</span><br>
Now then, one must take her leave.<br>
Oh, if it isn't Lady Warspite. Good morning to you.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Warspite：</span><br>
Y-yes. Good morning.<br>
(bounce)<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Illustrious：</span><br>
(boing)<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Warspite：</span><br>
(She, she's rubbing them right in my face...)<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Illustrious：</span><br>
Lady Warspite, you seem unwell... Have you any trouble sleeping?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Warspite：</span><br>
M-maybe a touch... But you need not worry. A little fatigue never killed anyone.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Illustrious：</span><br>
Then I shall be on my way... Do take care of yourself, Lady Warspite.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Warspite：</span><br>
Aye. Thank you.<br>
......<br>
It's a commission report...<br>
(Let's see how the girls are doing...)<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Nelson：</span><br>
......<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Illustrious：</span><br>
And I... may have... to join you...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Cygnet：</span><br>
……<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Warspite：</span><br>
(Now how am I supposed to keep up...?)<br>
Oh?<br>
Ah... Forgive me, Commander. I was lost in thought for a moment.<br>
We're all done for the day? We really hit it hard, didn't we...? Now what should we do with all this free time?<br>
Is that right? You'd like to hear some old Royal Navy war stories?<br>
Well, if you really want me to, I have lots I can tell you. We could be here a while though. You might want to get a snack or pour some tea.<br>
Now then, let's start with my commissioning. I was first assigned to the Second Battle Squadron of the Grand Fleet...<br>
(I suddenly find myself feeling quite cheerful..)<br>

Chapter 6: Her Majesty's Attentions<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Belfast：</span><br>
Your Majesty's tea. Madam Warspite. Please enjoy.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Warspite：</span><br>
My thanks.<br>
(This is the appointed time for Her Majesty's usual tea party, but it seems some invitees are late. It's only Her Majesty and I for now.)<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Queen Elizabeth：</span><br>
Now then, Warspite...<br>
Do I get the sense that you've been spending less and less time at our side...? And more and more with the Commander?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Warspite：</span><br>
... I... suppose that's possible.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Queen Elizabeth：</span><br>
Or perhaps we are mistaken.<br>
D-d-d-don't misunderstand me, it's not like I'm lonely or jealous or anything! I just happened to take note is all!!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Warspite：</span><br>
Your Majesty...<br>
(Now that I think of it, I have been spending a lot of time with the Commander lately. From the history of the Royal Navy to battle plans and tactics, we've had a lot to discuss.)<br>
(I do find myself more relaxed when chatting with the Commander. All the stress of the day washes right away.)<br>
(... When I put it like that, I realize I do often go looking to talk with the Commander of my own accord...)<br>
(Of course, it's not at all unusual for the secretary ship to have a lot to say to the Commander. That can only be good for the fleet, right?)<br>
(So no one could say it's only because I enjoy talking with the Commander that I go looking for a chat...)<br>
(...)<br>
(Of course that's not the only reason...)<br>
... Of course!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Queen Elizabeth：</span><br>
What's the matter, Warspite?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Warspite：</span><br>
Oh, it was nothing. Nothing at all!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Queen Elizabeth：</span><br>
Sigh. Now then, if you have something you need to say, Warspite, we certainly shan't interfere. You have your own affairs to manage, of course.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Warspite：</span><br>
(I can't escape the feeling that Her Majesty's expression belies some much deeper meaning...)<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Hood：</span><br>
Good day to you, Your Majesty. Warspite.<br>
Forgive my tardiness, Your Majesty. I was delayed by some affairs beyond my control. I apologise for keeping you both waiting.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Warspite：</span><br>
(The tea party begins in earnest.)<br>
(And yet, Her Majesty's words continue to weigh upon me...)<br>

Chapter 7: The Guardian Sword<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Warspite：</span><br>
Ah!!<br>
(This feeling of helplessness as I am swallowed by the dark blue abyss... and yet, even as I sink, I still have to protect the other Knights, and Her Majesty, and...)<br>
Oh, it was just a dream. I really felt like I was sinking...<br>
The sun isn't even up yet.<br>
... I suppose I'll go for a walk. Just have to be careful not to wake the others.<br>
<br>
Port - Near the Office<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Warspite：</span><br>
I wandered here without even thinking. I suppose I've had the Commander on my mind...?<br>
... What's that?<br>
Is there a light coming from the office...?<br>
... I better go take a look.<br>
... Commander...?<br>
(Splayed out over the desk fast asleep.)<br>
(Hm? These are today's commission reports? Didn't we finish these early this afternoon?)<br>
(Don't tell me... the Commander hid most of the work to do later so we would have more time to chat?)<br>
... The absolute moron.<br>
(Ah... Well... At least now I have a clear picture of what's going on...)<br>
(And... you're quite cute when you're sleeping, Commander. You look so peaceful...)<br>
(As you should be. You have nothing to fear with me protecting you.)<br>
(For I am Warspite. I have borne witness to every bitter twist of war, and found nothing that can bend me, the "Unsinkable Legend". No matter who may threaten to harm you, the girls, or the entire fleet, they would have to go through my broken body to do it.)<br>
(And in that knowledge, you may sleep soundly.)<br>
(And I...)<br>
……<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Renown：</span><br>
Y-you're having a laugh! It can't have been our Warspite!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Queen Elizabeth：</span><br>
We speak the truth! We saw it with our very own royal eyes. Warspite laid up with the Commander in the executive office!<br>
Now naturally we already had such suspicions, but never did we think things would progress so quickly...<br>
As our personal royal guard, she will of course deliver a satisfactory explanation!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Hood：</span><br>
Oh, my goodness...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Prince of Wales：</span><br>
Seems our hardened warrior has a tender side to her. Hehe...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Warspite：</span><br>
(Goodness, this rumor has gotten well out of hand... I need to clear this up with Her Majesty the Queen post haste...)<br>
(Not that it matters much, I suppose. No rumor can break me.)<br>
(For I am Warspite! Hah! Nothing can break the bond I have with the Commander!)<br>
