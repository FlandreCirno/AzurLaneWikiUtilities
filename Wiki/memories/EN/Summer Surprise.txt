Summer Surprise<br>
<br>
1 The Arctic Eskimo?<br>
One day at port...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Bailey：</span><br>
"Beneath the light of the glimmering stars and the moon spans a field of glaciers."<br>
"A frigid wind blows across a white expanse."<br>
"Within the pure white background, a girl clad in thick furs looks out in front of her, javelin in hand."<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Benson：</span><br>
Mm... Mm... What's next?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Bailey：</span><br>
"She advances carefully, her trusty hunting hounds at her side, the three surrounding their prey from different sides."<br>
"With a snapping sound, the spear leaps from her hands, securing a splendid meal."<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Kalk：</span><br>
Woah... That's badass...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Bailey：</span><br>
Hehe... I heard Eskimo apparently gives off the same kind of vibes!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Benson：</span><br>
A hunter who has lived in the polar glaciers for many years... What if she's a scary person?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Bailey：</span><br>
Huh? You haven't met her either, Benson?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Benson：</span><br>
Nope, not yet! But, according to my sources, she'll soon be serving as the Commander's secretary ship~<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Kalk：</span><br>
So, we'll be able to meet her if we head to the office? I wonder what kind of person she is...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">???：</span><br>
Oooooaaaaaaah!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Bailey：</span><br>
Huh?! A voice came from behind those trees!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">???：</span><br>
Badumdumdum!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Benson：</span><br>
Wait, now someone's drumming?!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">???：</span><br>
Hey there, heard you girls were talking about me? Heh heh, I'll put your questions to rest!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Kalk：</span><br>
*gulp*<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Eskimo ：</span><br>
Tadaaaah! Tribal-class destroyer, Eskimo, will be serving as secretary starting today! It's a pleasure to meetcha!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Bailey：</span><br>
Woah, a girl calling herself Eskimo leapt out from behind the tree!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Benson：</span><br>
She doesn't have a harpoon on her... or vicious hounds following her. Phew! She's just a normal cutie just like us!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Kalk：</span><br>
But she does have thick clothes from the frozen North! How cool!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Eskimo ：</span><br>
Ehehe, I'm quite familiar with that story you mentioned! It's real interesting, but unfortunately, I'm nothing like that.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Benson：</span><br>
No no, I'm glad our new friend isn't super scary! Anyway, I'm Benson, this is Bailey right here, and this is Kalk~<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Eskimo ：</span><br>
Nice meeting all of you! Anyway, I need to go meet up with the Commander, so we'll talk later!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Benson：</span><br>
No problemo!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Bailey：</span><br>
Huh, she's pretty cheerful. Not quite what I was expecting, hehe. Looks like things will be getting a lot livelier around here~<br>

Summer Surprise<br>
<br>
2 Ice Pops from Planet Bunny<br>
Port - Office<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Eskimo ：</span><br>
Hum, hum~ hum, dee dum~<br>
<br>
While everyone else was seeking relief from the sweltering summer heat, Eskimo was happily humming away, going about her business.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Eskimo ：</span><br>
Hmm? Why are you staring at me, Commander? Oh, I know! It's lunch break, right?<br>
Hehe, you did a darn good job this morning too! It's real hot outside today... Maybe we should go find something cool and refreshing. Wouldn't want to get heat stroke, y'know!<br>
<br>
*knock* *knock*<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Bailey：</span><br>
Commander, Eskimo, I've got something nice for you~<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Eskimo ：</span><br>
Let's see here... Planet Bunny... ice pops?<br>
Wow, I was just talking to the Commander about getting something to help us keep cool! Talk about a sweet coincidence!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Bailey：</span><br>
Heh heh! Because it's so hot today, everyone's been struggling to get anything done... So, Saratoga went and made ice pops to perk us up!<br>
<br>
Saratoga made ice pops? Oh no, oh no...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Bailey：</span><br>
That's right! Saratoga had her planes mix all the ingredients together, and us Benson sisters cut out the shapes!<br>
We named it, "Planet Bunny Ice Pops From Outer Space!"<br>
I'll be going around passing out the ice pops, so you two keep up the good work over here~<br>
<br>
Bailey quickly hops away after leaving behind a box of rabbit-shaped ice pops.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Eskimo ：</span><br>
Wowee! Want one, Commander?<br>
Mmmm~ Ahh, I'm so blessed that the wonderful creations known as ice pops exist in this world!<br>
<br>
"Right?"<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Eskimo ：</span><br>
Hmm... But, it still feels like something is missing...<br>
Ways to beat the heat... Something bigger and larger... Ah, I've got it!<br>
<br>
After looking at the ice pop in my hand for a bit, Eskimo suddenly seems to have a flash of inspiration.<br>
<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项1："What'd you come up with this time?"</span>'''''<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Eskimo ：</span><br>
Heheh, it's a secret for now!<br>
Just kick back and enjoy those ice pops! I'll be right back!<br>

Summer Surprise<br>
<br>
3 Preparations, Part 1<br>
Port - Shop<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Akashi：</span><br>
Nya... Come swing by and check out my limited-time summer sale, nya...<br>
Oh, Eskimo? Welcome, nya...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Eskimo ：</span><br>
Heyyo! Hmm... Akashi, you don't seem your usual self today.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Akashi：</span><br>
It's been too hot lately and nobody wants to go outside, nya... So business has been terrible, nya!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Eskimo ：</span><br>
Haha, I see, that does suck... But the good news is, I'm here to ask for your help, Akashi-nya!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Akashi：</span><br>
Hrmm? What can I do for you, nya?<br>
Hmm... If I remember correctly, we do have a machine like that in the warehouse, nya. But it hasn't worked in ages even if I do rent it out to you, nya.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Eskimo ：</span><br>
Aren't you amazing at repairs though? If you can even patch up our broken equipment, you should be able to fix up this machine, right?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Akashi：</span><br>
Of course, nya! But I don't know why it isn't working to begin with, so the repairs might take some time, nya...<br>
Besides, why are you interested in something like that anyway, nya?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Eskimo ：</span><br>
Mm... I guess I can tell you, since you're basically my important business partner!<br>
*whisper* *whisper*<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Akashi：</span><br>
(Nya?! Mm... hm... I see, I see!)<br>
And if I take advantage of this opportunity to set up a stall, nya... I'll be able to turn my sales right around, nya!<br>
Rest assured, Eskimo, nya. I'll have this thing patched up for you in no time, nya!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Eskimo ：</span><br>
Really? Booyah!! Thanks a ton, Akashi-nya!<br>

Summer Surprise<br>
<br>
4 Preparations, Part 2<br>
Port - Office, a few days later<br>
Over the last few days, Eskimo seems to have been working on something. I wonder if it's related to the "secret" she mentioned.<br>
But, she's still been diligently taking care of her secretary duties. An absolute ball of energy, that girl...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Eskimo ：</span><br>
Hum hum hum~♪<br>
<br>
Eskimo continues to work while humming cheerfully. I can't really picture a girl like her having secrets at all.<br>
But that only makes me more interested in what it is...<br>
<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项1："Eskimo, what have you been working on lately?"</span>'''''<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Eskimo ：</span><br>
Ehehe~ I was wondering when curiosity would finally get the better of you, Commander~<br>
I actually do have a plan in mind... Well more accurately, I should say that I've been working on a little surprise.<br>
If I spill the beans now, it won't be a surprise at all! So you're gonna have to stay tuned!<br>
<br>
Despite her usual carefree attitude, she clearly wasn't going to budge on this particular topic.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Eskimo ：</span><br>
Buuuut, I have run into a teensy problem about the place I want...<br>
So can you let me use the port's indoor pool for a day? That's about how long it'll take to get my surprise together anyway!<br>
Think you could do me a favor, Commander? Pretty please?<br>
<br>
The indoor pool, huh... Since it's the middle of summer, everyone just goes down to the beach anyway so the pool is pretty deserted.<br>
Well, I guess one day couldn't hurt...<br>
<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项1："That's fine by me."</span>'''''<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Eskimo ：</span><br>
Woohoo! Thanks a ton, Commander!<br>
That takes care of the most annoying problem!<br>
Now to finish the rest of the preparations...<br>
<br>
Even an energetic kid like Eskimo can't finish without a whole day's time, huh... That really makes me interested in seeing what she's been working on.<br>
Well, whatever it is, I hope the pool manages to survive...<br>

Summer Surprise<br>
<br>
5 Spread the Word!<br>
Port - Academy Courtyard<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Eskimo ：</span><br>
It's been super hot outside lately, and I know you've all been looking for ways to beat the heat!<br>
But look no further! Tomorrow, there will be a special surprise awaiting you all at the port's indoor pool!<br>
It's gonna blow your mind! So be there or be square!<br>
<br>
Since early in the morning, Eskimo has been promoting her work in the academy's courtyard. Her energetic voice seems to be drawing a lot of attention.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Eskimo ：</span><br>
Good moooooorning, Commander! Here, take a flyer for tomorrow's event~<br>
<br>
"Woah, you even made your own flyers by hand..."<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Eskimo ：</span><br>
I couldn't have done this without you, so come by and visit tomorrow!<br>
<br>
So this must've been what she was working on. Just one more day until the grand reveal.<br>
<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项1："I'll be there. It's a promise."</span>'''''<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Eskimo ：</span><br>
Woohoo! I'll see you there then!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Benson：</span><br>
Huh? A surprise event at the indoor pool?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Bailey：</span><br>
I was wondering why it was closed all day yesterday... Turns out, Eskimo was behind it!<br>
Things certainly are a lot livelier here now, just as I said the other day~<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Kalk：</span><br>
Hm... Do you think it's gonna be a swim meet? I'll have to head back and grab my swimwear.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Eskimo ：</span><br>
Huh? Swimsuit? No, no, you won't be needing that. If anything, you'd better dress warm!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Benson：</span><br>
Pool... Pond... Something related to Eskimo... Woah, are you gonna have a fishing competition?<br>
...Ah, the inspiration is coming to me. Cute girls sitting by a pond, locked in a life-or-death competition against starvation...<br>
Absolutely fantastic! I'm going to go buy some fishing equipment!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Eskimo ：</span><br>
Hold up, you're way off with that one... Look, you don't have to bring anything with you!<br>
Just read the details on the other side of the flyer!<br>
<br>
Huh, there was something written on the other side of the flyer? Never noticed that before...<br>
"We've prepared a special surprise for you at the pool inside the port's gym tomorrow. Come and have some fun!"<br>
"PS: Things might get a bit chilly, so dress warm!"<br>
...Chilly?<br>

Summer Surprise<br>
<br>
6 Summer's Wintry Wonderland<br>
Port - Indoor Pool, the next day<br>
Eskimo's advertising must've been a big success yesterday, because I saw a ton of people headed towards the same destination - the indoor pool.<br>
......<br>
Hm? I could hear joyous laughter coming from the other side of the door. Whatever Eskimo prepared must be pretty good.<br>
Well, time to see for myself what's on the other side of the door. 3... 2... 1...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Eskimo ：</span><br>
This is the big surprise I've been working hard to prepare for all of you! So, what do you think? Let's have a blast!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Avrora：</span><br>
A snow machine in the middle of summer, huh? What a splendid idea... It reminds me of being back home at the Northern Parliament.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Bailey：</span><br>
Woooow, it's snowing! There's so much of it, even though we're in the middle of summer! Look, Benson, let's have a snowball fight!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Benson：</span><br>
Let's do that later! First, let's make the biggest snow bunny EVER!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Kalk：</span><br>
Yeah, yeah! Lemme help too!<br>
<br>
When I opened that door, a frigid blast of wind hit me in the face, as if I had just stepped into the middle of winter.<br>
Inside the pool was... Wait, I couldn't even see where the pool was supposed to be in the first place.<br>
Instead, a pure white snowfield spread out in front of me, and there were even a few igloos spread around the pool area.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Eskimo ：</span><br>
Hehe, whaddya think, Commander? Pretty awesome, isn't it?<br>
<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项1："Absolutely."</span>'''''<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Eskimo ：</span><br>
Heheh, this is what I came up with when we were eating the ice pops the other day. If summer is such a slog, then why don't we change it to winter?<br>
And this is the result! I rented a snow machine from Akashi, kept it running here for a day, and voilà! A wintry wonderland!<br>
<br>
She really is quite the force of nature. And if Akashi is involved, then that means...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Akashi：</span><br>
Come swing by Akashi's limited-time-only igloo shop!<br>
If you get tired from playing in the snow, come by to relax and enjoy some hot drinks and snacks!<br>
<br>
She never lets a business opportunity pass her up...<br>
*splat*!<br>
A snowball suddenly whizzed by me, missing me by only a tiny bit.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Foxhound：</span><br>
Sorry about that, my aim was a little off there!<br>
Commander! And Eskimo too! We rarely have a chance to have a snowball fight in the middle of summer, so don't just stand there!<br>
You're just in time for the second round anyway, so let's play together?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Eskimo ：</span><br>
Heck yeah, count me in! I'll be right over!<br>
C'mon, Commander! Let's enjoy the snow while it lasts!<br>

Summer Surprise<br>
<br>
7 What Fun Means to Eskimo<br>
While everyone was having fun throwing snowballs at each other, the sun was beginning to set.<br>
I must say, I was impressed by the idea of turning a hot summer day into a little bit of winter. Definitely might be something worth repeating.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Eskimo ：</span><br>
Phew... That was a lot of fun. So, what's the verdict, Commander? Had a good time?<br>
<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项1："Sure did."</span>'''''<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Eskimo ：</span><br>
Hehe, that's what I wanted to hear! The sun's about to set and everyone's planning to head back, so maybe you should as well?<br>
I've gotta stay and clean up though. Have to return things the way you found 'em!<br>
<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项1："That'll go faster with two people."</span>'''''<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Eskimo ：</span><br>
Huh? You're gonna stay to help me? Hooray! Then, let's get this done!<br>
<br>
The clean-up work took longer than expected. And to think that Eskimo set everything up all by herself...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Eskimo ：</span><br>
Sure, getting everything set up was a bit difficult and had me real tired, but everyone was totally blown away! Seeing their smiles made all the hard work worth it!<br>
After all, seeing other people happy is what makes me happy as well!<br>
Being able to play with everyone like this is the very definition of fun!<br>
Oh, by the way, Commander, what's your favorite kind of fish?<br>
<br>
My favorite kind of fish...?<br>
Why would she ask me about that all of a sudden?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Eskimo ：</span><br>
Heheh, the end of this surprise marks the beginning of a new surprise~<br>
I'm going to work harder and harder to make everyone happy!<br>
Maybe next time... I'll hold a fishing competition just like Benson wanted~<br>
Commander, will you help me make that a reality too?<br>
<br>
For the sake of seeing more brightly-shining smiles like Eskimo's... Maybe more events like this wouldn't be a bad idea.<br>
