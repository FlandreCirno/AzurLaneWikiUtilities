<br>
The long-awaited cruise ship is finally finished.<br>
Harbin cuts the ribbon with a pair of scissors, then breaks a bottle of champagne against the bow. The ship has been launched and is ready to cruise.<br>
As I marvel at the luxurious vessel before me, I suddenly remember something very important.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
(All sorts of wild proposals had been flooding in, and I'm pretty sure Long Island was randomly rubber-stamping things on a whim... I need to double-check what actually made it into the final proposal.)<br>
<br>
I carefully go through all the ship's facilities and their layouts one at a time.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
A mall, a nightclub, an arcade... Hmm, these are all fine.<br>
But did we NEED an aquarium, a garden, an ammo depot, and a cat lodge?<br>
Don't tell me EVERYTHING ended up getting approved...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Richelieu：</span><br>
It was I who approved the cat lodge. It felt pertinent to have a place for people to wind down.<br>
As for all the rest, there is a logical reason behind each one of them.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">{namecode:448}：</span><br>
Indeed. It was all planned out based on logic, dear human.<br>
<br>
Emden joins the conversation just as Richelieu starts explaining the logic behind the layout.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">{namecode:448}：</span><br>
"Emden shall guide you to the heart of the ship. Come along now."<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
(The heart? Guess she means the bridge. It won't hurt to check where the ship is headed.)<br>
Alright. Lead the way.<br>
<br>
Richelieu bids me goodbye with a quick bow, then I head to the bridge with Emden.<br>
As I peer out from the bridge's window, the land gradually recedes until I am surrounded by a vast, boundless blue.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">{namecode:448}：</span><br>
Here you can see where the ship is going, my darling human. "You must have yearned for a cruise such as this, human. Heehee."<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Hmm... Are we going to Seabreeze Island first? The place from last year?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">{namecode:448}：</span><br>
That's correct. Seabreeze Island shall be our first destination; then we will do a tour of the tropics before returning to port.<br>
"This itinerary was created to maximize your leisure and comfort. You should be grateful to Emden."<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
In other words, you haven't decided on where exactly we're going afterwards?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">{namecode:448}：</span><br>
I suppose that is so. Do you prefer having everything planned out for you?<br>
If you so wish, Emden can alter the plan for you, my darling human. "If that's what you want, then beg for it."<br>
<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项1：(Think about it for a bit.)</span>'''''<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项2：(Don't change anything.)</span>'''''<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Well... The essence of a vacation is being able to kick back and relax without having to worry about anything.<br>
So yeah, I don't mind going with the flow.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">{namecode:448}：</span><br>
Heehee. If you say so. "Emden has no objections."<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
(Come to think of it, we didn't run into any kooky visitors or get any strange letters all the way from construction to launch.)<br>
(As it stands, the cruise is on a surprisingly smooth course.)<br>
(That makes me think we won't get stranded by a tempest and be forced to survive on a desert island this time.)<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">{namecode:448}：</span><br>
You seem to be brooding, my darling human. You have nothing to worry about.<br>
We've planned for every possible scenario during this cruise. "Set aside your concerns and simply enjoy your vacation."<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Yeah, you're right... What could go wrong?<br>
<br>
I set aside my unfounded fears and again gaze out the window at the boundless sea.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
I'm sure it'll be smooth sailing from here on out!<br>

<br>
My first night aboard was great. It was the first time in a long while that I got to sleep without having to worry about the ever-looming specter of work.<br>
Man, how great it felt to not be woken up by an alarm clock, but rather by the warm rays of sunlight on my cheeks.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
(Wait a sec... I'm pretty sure I closed the curtains before I went to sleep. Why is there sunlight shining on me...?)<br>
<br>
My eyes pop open as if seeking an answer to that question – and then, I see Emden's mischievous face right next to mine.<br>
She's just sitting there in bed, looking down at me.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
E-Emden?!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">{namecode:448}：</span><br>
Heehee. Good morning, my darling human. "We kept watch while you were asleep. You should be grateful."<br>
Now that you're awake, please get changed and come with me to your workstation. I would like to brief you on our navigational status.<br>
<br>
I do as asked, quickly showering and getting changed before heading over to the workstation.<br>
As soon as I open the door, I'm immediately awestruck by an uncanny wave of familiarity.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">{namecode:448}：</span><br>
Surprised? We perfectly recreated your office one-to-one so you would feel at home.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Wow. It really is a perfect copy.<br>
It even comes with the same feeling of mounting dread as mountains of work loom before me...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">{namecode:448}：</span><br>
I wish you could see the look on your face right now, my darling human. "Heehee. It makes me want to coddle you."<br>
But, before there can be coddling, Emden needs to formally report how the cruise is going.<br>
Everything aboard the ship is functioning well. As for the sea, visibility is excellent and the waters are as calm as can be. Unless we run into bad weather, we'll reach Seabreeze Island on schedule.<br>
There will be a party later to celebrate the ship's virgin voyage. Your attendance would be appreciated.<br>
Also, since the ship requires maintenance, the task of giving you reports and schedule updates will be carried out in shifts.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Shifts? Wait, so you're not the only one responsible for that task?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">{namecode:448}：</span><br>
"Your wording implies you can't imagine being without Emden, hmm?" As much as we'd like to have you all to ourselves, that's just how it is.<br>
You should expect to receive reports from Memphis and Long Island later.<br>
Today is your first day of receiving reports, so Emden will take a little longer than the rest. "It's out of concern for you, human."<br>
Moving forward, our reports will be more brief and to the point.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Alright. It's good to know I have a whole team to keep me in the loop.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">{namecode:448}：</span><br>
It is. There are also events planned for specific hours of the day, and we'll remind you of them as we give you our morning reports.<br>
"In other words, you can spend your time however you see fit outside of those events." There are all kinds of leisure facilities onboard for you to try in that time.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Long Island：</span><br>
Emdeeen! You're taking too long! I told you, you should just do like me and keep it to a quick phone call!<br>
<br>
A familiar voice rings out as Long Island barges into my workspace.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
(Is she straight-up admitting she'll half-ass it? Suddenly, I'm not sure Long Island is suited for this job.)<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Long Island：</span><br>
...Why are you giving me that look? I hope you're not doubting my competence!<br>
I'm doing my job right now! My job is to lead you to the maiden voyage party!<br>
<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项1：(Stare incredulously at her.)</span>'''''<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Long Island：</span><br>
Ugh... Fiiine, I admit it! I'm only in here so I don't have to answer the phone.<br>
Don't judge me! It's been ringing all day and stopping me from focusing on my video games!<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
That's very on-brand for you.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Long Island：</span><br>
Well, cat's out of the bag now... Anyway, your next destination iiis... the banquet hall!<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Do I have to leave right now?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Long Island：</span><br>
Nah, there's time. Just give me a holler when you're good to go!<br>
You'll be on time as long as you leave before 12. That's all for my report. Now, if you need me, I'll be back here, playing games.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">{namecode:448}：</span><br>
Emden should get ready for the party as well, so if you'll excuse us... "Give Emden a call if you need someone to talk to, human."<br>
<br>
Long Island and Emden both leave my workspace. Alone with my thoughts, I start wondering what to do now.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
(I suppose I could have a look around while I wait for the party to start.)<br>
{{折叠面板|内容结束}}

{{折叠面板|标题=To Seabreeze Island|选项=3|主框=1|样式=primary|展开=是}}
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Communicator：</span><br>
RING RING RING! RING RING RING!<br>
<br>
The call chime rings two times, then immediately connects to my cabin.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Memphis：</span><br>
Good morning, Commander. I hope you slept well.<br>
I'll be reporting to you today. I'm waiting for you in your workspace.<br>
<br>
I hang up, have a shower, and get dressed, then head for my workspace.<br>
Cruise Ship - Workspace<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Memphis：</span><br>
Good morning again. I take it you're fully awake? Then allow me to give you today's report.<br>
The ship is on course and everything is running well. We should arrive at Seabreeze Island tomorrow morning.<br>
There's an event planned today – a water fight at the water park. It will be held from 2 PM to 6 PM.<br>
You can stop by whenever it's convenient for you. No pressure.<br>
Bear in mind, though, that the main part of the event won't start until you're there, so don't forget to come.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Got it.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Memphis：</span><br>
That's all I have to report. Hope you enjoy your free time aboard the ship.<br>
<br>
Memphis brings her stack of documents to a separate table and takes a seat.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Wait, you're going to WORK? On our holiday?<br>
You just told me to enjoy my free time. I think you should follow your own advice.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Memphis：</span><br>
Don't worry about me. I know how to balance my work and private life.<br>
Also, I'm doing this now so I won't have to do it later. I'm looking to participate in the evening events.<br>
I'll be fine. You just concentrate on enjoying yourself! Go on, shoo!<br>
<br>
Memphis walks over and pushes me out the door.<br>
My feet hit the deck with a stumble. A cool, salty breeze and the cry of a bald eagle bid me welcome outside.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
(That eagle, circling in the air... I think I've seen it before.)<br>
<br>
I turn my gaze ahead and spot Enterprise, dressed in casual clothes and leaning against a handrail. She's marveling at the ocean.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
(It must be Grimmy, her pet eagle.)<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Enterprise：</span><br>
Ah, Commander. Here to enjoy the view, too?<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Sort of. I was just walking around before I stumbled upon you.<br>
Are you here by yourself? I thought you'd follow your sisters around.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Enterprise：</span><br>
I did, for a while. Hornet has been like an excited dog without a leash ever since we boarded. As soon as she woke up this morning, she dragged me and Yorktown all around the ship.<br>
When we got here, I told her I wanted to feel the breeze for a minute, and she let me go.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Ahh, I see.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Enterprise：</span><br>
Sometimes, you just want to stop and smell the roses on a vacation. You can't always be moving.<br>
Maybe you think otherwise, Commander?<br>
<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项1：(Agree with her.)</span>'''''<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项2：(Tease her a bit.)</span>'''''<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项1）</span>'''''No, I agree. Feeling the wind in your hair, taking in the vastness of the ocean – that's the most relaxing thing I could ask for.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项2）</span>'''''Sounds like you've changed. What happened to the girl who struggles to unwind on a vacation?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Enterprise：</span><br>
Ahem... She took your advice to heart. "Everyone needs breaks in order to work better."<br>
<br>
Enterprise gives me a relaxed look.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Enterprise：</span><br>
Are you free right now? If so, do you wanna stay and watch the waves with me for a while?<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Don't mind if I do.<br>
<br>
Sometime later, while Enterprise and I are still basking in the briny breezes...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">New Jersey：</span><br>
Enterprise! And my honey, too! I finally found you!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Enterprise：</span><br>
"Finally"? You've been looking for us?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">New Jersey：</span><br>
Of course I have! Did you forget you're one of the main hosts of the water fight happening today?<br>
I ran across your sisters a minute ago and they pointed me here when I asked about you.<br>
Wasn't expecting to see YOU here, though, honey!<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Wait, I thought the water fight started at 2 PM? Why do you need to start getting ready this early?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">New Jersey：</span><br>
Isn't that obvious? Well, maybe not, I guess.<br>
Basically, we need to style our hair and put on makeup that won't get utterly ruined when we get splashed with water. That takes time.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Enterprise：</span><br>
I don't HAVE to do that, do I?<br>
I'm not exactly an expert at makeup and styling, so...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">New Jersey：</span><br>
Yes, you do, if you want to play with honey here! And don't worry – I'll do it for you!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Enterprise：</span><br>
Oh. Uh... Well then, Commander, I guess she and I will go get ourselves ready.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">New Jersey：</span><br>
I want you looking your best too, honey. Remember that!<br>
Anyway, time for us to go. See you later!<br>
<br>
I wave the two goodbye as they leave.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
(It's too bad I didn't pack any water-resistant makeup or equipment to style my hair with, I guess...)<br>
(I'll just show up looking like I always do.)<br>
(Anyway, there's still plenty of time before the water fight starts. I'll have a look around the ship in the meantime.)<br>

{{折叠面板|标题=Anchoring at Seabreeze Island|选项=4|主框=1|样式=primary|展开=是}}
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">{namecode:448}：</span><br>
Oh, humaaan. My darling humaaan. It's time to wake uuup!<br>
<br>
In the middle of my slumber, a familiar voice calls out to me.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">{namecode:448}：</span><br>
"It doesn't look like being gentle works. Perhaps our human would rather be told to wake up, or else."<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
...Emden?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">{namecode:448}：</span><br>
Now that you're awake, it's time for your daily report, my darling human. "You'd be wise to listen closely."<br>
The ship will arrive at Seabreeze Island in less than an hour. After that, we will drop anchor and then disembark.<br>
For today's main event, we will go on the island and give our thanks to everyone who came to the island to help.<br>
"There will, of course, be ample time for you to look around the island, human. You've missed it, no?"<br>
Heehee. While we would love to stay, I'm afraid we need to prepare to make landfall.<br>
You may use your free time however you see fit. Now, if you'll excuse us... "Use your time well."<br>
<br>
After Emden leaves, I get dressed and leave my cabin. I walk up to the blast door – which needs a keycard to open – when I realize something.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
(Wait a second...)<br>
(I'm the only one with clearance to open the blast door. Beyond me, the only ones with even temporary permission to enter are the Royal Maids, and that's only at specific times to clean the cabin.)<br>
(The only way Memphis could wake me up was by calling me...)<br>
(So how the hell did Emden find her way to my bedside?!)<br>
<br>
I quickly realize, however, that thinking or asking them about this clearly will not get me anywhere.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
(Eh. Better not think too hard about it.)<br>
<br>
I get up on the deck to find a big crowd has already gathered, necks craned as they watch the island draw nearer and nearer.<br>
Even from afar, I can hear Z23, Javelin, Laffey, and Ayanami talking about the island.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Javelin：</span><br>
Oh, I'm so excited! We'll get to meet our friends and all those weird animals again!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Laffey：</span><br>
Zzzzz...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Javelin：</span><br>
Don't doze off on us, Laffey! At least stay up until we've touched grass!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ayanami：</span><br>
It'll be fine. Me and Z23 will carry her if we have to.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Z23：</span><br>
*sigh*... Which we probably will.<br>
Remember what we're here for. We're not just messing around, we're meeting up with our friends who helped build up the island so we can all enjoy this vacation.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Pamiat' Merkuria：</span><br>
Hey! Commander! Whatcha standing over there for? Come here and chat with us!<br>
<br>
Pamiat' appears out of the blue and pushes me into the heart of the crowd.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Pamiat' Merkuria：</span><br>
You can tell how much the island has changed, even from all the way over here!<br>
It took a looot of people to make it into what it is now, y'know. Don't forget to thank all the hardworking girls who built it over countless shifts!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Bismarck：</span><br>
Ah, that reminds me – I wanted to ask you something, Commander.<br>
As you know, we'll be delivering supplies and materials for the next group that will manage the island.<br>
Since we won't anchor for long, we'll want to work fast to have as much time and space as possible.<br>
As efficiency is our primary concern, do you think we could improve how and where we store our cargo?<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
(That is an important question... It also reminds me that the ship has a dedicated facility for cargo.)<br>
I have an idea. Since we're going to dock, we could open the ship's cargo unloading area and let the machinery deliver what materials Akashi has finished packing.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Bismarck：</span><br>
You mean... let Akashi handle it all?<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
She's an expert in logistics. She knows how to categorize cargo and put it in neat and efficient stacks.<br>
Also, we can separate our machinery into two groups and have them work turn by turn, then unload cargo based on the category they belong to.<br>
All in all, this should cut a full 24-hour task down to just 20 hours.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Bismarck：</span><br>
That also saves time spent sorting cargo in the island's warehouse... A clever and practical idea. I'll make some calls.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Right. Hope it goes well.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Owari：</span><br>
Yo, Commander!<br>
<br>
The moment my conversation with Bismarck ends, a voice brimming with energy calls out to me.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Owari：</span><br>
Just wanted to ask ya something'!<br>
Do I get your permish to harvest whatever fresh veggies are on the island?<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
You're asking if you're allowed to forage?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Owari：</span><br>
Yeah, that! What you said!<br>
I know what you're thinkin' – "we got tons of veggies onboard, and the folks on the island ain't strapped for food either."<br>
But that's not it! I'm talkin' about finding new species that could go in a pot, stew, soup, whatever! There's gotta be tons of plants like that!<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
(Owari knows her plants, so I doubt she'll bring anything poisonous.)<br>
Yeah, sure. Just be careful if you go up into the mountains. Steer clear of cliffs, too.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Owari：</span><br>
What's so dangerous 'bout cliffs?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Formidable：</span><br>
...You do not want to underestimate the mountains. Trust me.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Owari：</span><br>
Well, if ya say so, alright. I'll check myself before I wreck myself.<br>
<br>
With a smile, she goes off to recruit some foraging buddies.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">La Galissonnière：</span><br>
Commaaander! It's-a me!<br>
You wanna come watch me play beach volleyball later?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Bristol：</span><br>
Hold it! The Commander's coming with me to investigate mysteries on the island! Right, Commander?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Anchorage：</span><br>
Teacher... Come with Anchorage to the beach. And read to me!<br>
<br>
If there's one thing the girls aren't lacking, it's enthusiasm.<br>
Maybe the excitement of traveling and the simple joy of being with others are the real pleasures of a vacation.<br>
The ship drops anchor near the shore, and the girls all return to their cabins to prepare to disembark.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
(There's no rush to get off the ship. First, I'll ask around and see if anyone needs help with anything.)<br>
{{折叠面板|内容结束}}

{{折叠面板|标题=Call from a Ghost|选项=5|主框=1|样式=primary|展开=是}}
<br>
I open my eyes. It is dead quiet inside my cabin.<br>
There is no Emden sitting beside my bed, nor is there any call from Memphis.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
(Rise and shine... If neither of those are here to wake me, that leaves only one option.)<br>
<br>
Just as I'm thinking, a ringtone plays in my cabin.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Long Island：</span><br>
Hiii. It's your favorite ghost calling. You awake yet, Commander? If not, go wash your face and come out!<br>
I'm gonna give you your report over the phone. If you're still half-asleep and forget something, don't go blaming it on me!<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
(She's literally phoning it in... Then again, she IS on vacation, so I'll let it pass.)<br>
Okay, I'm awake. Continue your report.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Long Island：</span><br>
You got it. The ship has departed from Seabreeze Island and everything is running as normal onboard.<br>
We're on course tooo... uh, I don't know, actually. Reading notes takes effort. You'll know when we get there!<br>
There's also a... right, a security drill in the ammo storage later today! Remember that, 'cause you're participating. That's my report! Buh-bye!<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Wait, what was that about a security drill?<br>
<br>
No response. She really hung up just like that.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
(Eh, it's no big deal since I got the gist of it. Let's head out and see what's up.)<br>
<br>
I put on new clothes and leave my cabin, stepping out onto the deck.<br>
Right away, I stumble upon a group of Northern Parliament girls earnestly discussing something.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Kronshtadt：</span><br>
...The last thing I want to see is a rush B-scenario. The defenders have their plan, and we have ours. Carry it out in an orderly manner.<br>
Moreover, do NOT use cluster charges if it risks the hostage's safety, or your breaching attempt will blow up a lot more than just a wall.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Sovetsky Soyuz：</span><br>
Yes, that is something we must be aware of. Is there anything else we should bear in mind?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Kronshtadt：</span><br>
Yeah. We're fighting a mixed Royal Navy-Eagle Union force this time, so in the name of simulating a realistic scenario, don't be afraid to use shields to push the defenders around if need be.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ognevoy：</span><br>
B-but that's so violent! Can't I make the enemy surrender by giving Comrade Commander a biiig hug?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Svirepy：</span><br>
This is a battlefield, not a sleepover! Huggin' ain't gonna do anything!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Poltava：</span><br>
Maybe it will? All that matters is that we capture Comrade Commander.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Sovetsky Soyuz：</span><br>
Then we could surprise the enemy with an aggressive assault, putting them in disarray while we capture Comrade Commander... Yes, that could work.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Poltava：</span><br>
Oh, speak of the devil. How long have you been here, Comrade Commander?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Kronshtadt：</span><br>
What? Comrade Commander, shouldn't you be at the ammo storage, getting ready? You're the VIP.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
(So by "participating," Long Island meant I'd be playing a hostage, huh...)<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Sovetsky Soyuz：</span><br>
Judging by your reaction, there has been a miscommunication somewhere. We'll find out where it happened sometime later.<br>
To make it clear, this drill was designed to prepare us in case you are ever kidnapped or if your safety is threatened.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Poltava：</span><br>
In this case, our side is the one trying to kidnap you.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Sovetsky Soyuz：</span><br>
As the VIP, you need to be part of the drill both for realism and to learn how to act in emergency situations.<br>
Let's see... The schedule says that you should go and talk to Memphis now.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Kronshtadt：</span><br>
We'll handle any future drills ourselves, so don't worry about that. You just need to be familiar with how the process works.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Alright then.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Sovetsky Soyuz：</span><br>
All that said... I think we need to formulate a plan B.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Kronshtadt：</span><br>
Yeah. Comrade Commander just overheard everything, so we need to start from scratch...<br>
<br>
I leave the deck and bump into Memphis, who's been looking for me.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Memphis：</span><br>
There you are, Commander. Long Island told you about the drill, didn't she?<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Technically, yes, but I didn't get any details until just a minute ago. I've got the general idea.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Memphis：</span><br>
Wait, what? Did she not give you the notes I wrote for you?<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
All she gave me was a call this morning. She skipped over most of the important things, I think.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Memphis：</span><br>
You've got to be kidding me! She could've omitted crucial things you need to know about! Ugh... I'll just give you the report next time.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Oh, by the way, I saw Soyuz is on the attacking team. I'm going to get a secret weapon.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Memphis：</span><br>
A what now? Forget I asked. Just please be at the drill on time! I've got a lot to do, so excuse me.<br>
<br>
But, before she runs off to the lower decks, Memphis explains the gist of the drill one more time.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
(As long as I can get that secret weapon, I'll have nothing to worry about. I'll roam around the ship a bit until it's time.)<br>

<br>
As I'm drifting off to sleep, warning alarms suddenly start blaring, immediately putting me on alert.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
(Something's clearly wrong, so why has nobody called me yet?)<br>
(I'd better get to the bridge quick and find out what's happening.)<br>
<br>
I rush out of bed, throw some clothes on, and leave my cabin.<br>
Meanwhile, somewhere else...<br>
Cruise Ship - On the Deck<br>
An alarmed crowd had already gathered on the deck, their brows furrowed at the storm that appeared so suddenly.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Bismarck Zwei：</span><br>
Geryon, keep a watchful eye on the sea. Report anything unusual.<br>
<br>
At Bismarck's command, the steel beast flew into the sky.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">{namecode:448}：</span><br>
This is unfortunate. I wonder what will happen next? "If someone means us harm, we will crush them."<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Chen Hai：</span><br>
It's strange... I spoke to Huan Ch'ang before we set off, and even she couldn't foretell the coming of any storm.<br>
The storm has made it hard to reach the Commander, too... We'll just have to wait here until we get orders.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Avrora：</span><br>
Yes, I wonder what the Commander is doing... Until we're told otherwise, we'll just have to do what we can.<br>
<br>
Cruise Ship - Bridge<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">TB ：</span><br>
Commander, a storm of indeterminate origin has appeared. I am analyzing it but as of yet unable to explain it.<br>
<br>
A hologram of TB appears above the table.<br>
A simple system backup of TB was performed on the ship so TB, too, could enjoy the cruise.<br>
Normally, she wouldn't have to take any action, since all the work on the ship is done by shipgirls coordinating with each other.<br>
This, needless to say, is not a normal circumstance.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
TB, were there any errors in our observation records?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">TB ：</span><br>
Processing order... There were no errors. This storm appeared spontaneously.<br>
Based on latest observations, there is a high probability that a large octopod known as a "kraken" is present in the storm.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Really? A high probability?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">TB ：</span><br>
Yes. By comparing its appearance with that of similar entities in my database, the most likely match was determined to be this legendary creature.<br>
It is worth noting that the thermal imager and radar are not malfunctioning. A new course has been calculated and may be initiated at any time.<br>
Additionally, defensive measures have been planned out, incorporating the firepower of the shipgirls aboard.<br>
If necessary, the vessel is prepared to enter combat.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Just keep your eyes on the situation for now. There's something I want to check.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">TB ：</span><br>
Orders received.<br>
<br>
Meanwhile, on the deck...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Bismarck Zwei：</span><br>
Geryon says tentacles are emerging from the storm. Strangely, though, the tentacles show no sign of aggression.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Avrora：</span><br>
They aren't hostile to us?<br>
<br>
CREEEAK!<br>
The ship rocked fiercely. A rally of tentacles extended from the storm, gently wrapping themselves around the ship.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Vittorio Veneto：</span><br>
I... think these tentacles may belong to someone from Tempesta.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Richelieu：</span><br>
I refuse to believe a sea creature of this size is anyone's pet. Furthermore, they are clearly targeting the ship.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Queen Elizabeth：</span><br>
If it IS Tempesta, it's all the more suspicious! They're clearly after something, seeing as they aren't attacking!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Sovetsky Soyuz：</span><br>
We're talking about pirates. They could be after one thing.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Chen Hai：</span><br>
No, you don't mean...?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Akagi & Taihou：</span><br>
The Commander!<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
(I knew it...)<br>
<br>
As the tentacles shake the ship's hull, they creep along the railings and slither their way from the bridge onto the deck.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Brace for the storm, everyone!<br>
<br>
The winds grow in fury as the rain pours down. As thunderbolts strike without pause, a few shadowy figures appear deep within the storm.<br>
The dire situation gets even worse when we realize that a fleet has surrounded the ship, cutting off all escape routes.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">???：</span><br>
Heheh. By sailing in these seas, you've already signed a pact to surrender everything you have!<br>
Have you heard the tale? "When a sudden storm brews up and black sails flutter in the wind, that is when the great captains shall return."<br>
For the uninitiated–<br>
That means us evil, evil pirates have you completely surrounded♡<br>
Oi! You stole my line, Hind!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Golden Hind：</span><br>
Forgive me, dear. I just couldn't resist the urge to finish your sentence. Go on, say the rest, Fortune.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Royal Fortune：</span><br>
Ahem... Listen up, people! We can do this the easy way, or the hard way! Either way, you and your ship are coming with us!<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
(Seems I was wrong. We did run into a tempest after all.)<br>
(I'm surprised Tempesta are actually practicing piracy. Not that it's off-brand for them... I suppose I'll play along for now.)<br>
Goddamn pirates! Of all the hands we'd fall into, I can't believe it's yours!<br>
You're going to abduct us, huh? Then what are you going to do to us?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Royal Fortune：</span><br>
That's obvious. You're all gonna walk the pla– I mean, we're gonna ransom you off!<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
And who's going to pay you the ransom if you've already made a hostage of everyone who could do so?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Royal Fortune：</span><br>
You... can't pay the ransom? Fine, then we'll liquidate that posh ship you've– No, that won't work either! You'll just have to pay with your BODY, Commander!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Golden Hind：</span><br>
Well, well, you've let the cat out of the bag now, Fortune!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Royal Fortune：</span><br>
Aw, shoot... Hey, wipe that grin off your face! I couldn't help myself, alright?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Whydah：</span><br>
*yaaawn*... I'm shleepy. Can we get this over with?<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
How did you find us?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Royal Fortune：</span><br>
Uhh, we...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Golden Hind：</span><br>
We really, really missed you, my darling! I looked all over for you, and now I've finally found you.<br>
And my, looks like we caught you on a vacation. If you don't have anywhere else to be, why don't you come visit us?<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
I DO like the sound of that... but first, I should hear what everyone else thinks.<br>
<br>
The answer is unanimous – they all want to visit Tempesta's secret retreat. And so, it becomes our next destination.<br>
The giant tentacles let go of the vessel, and the pirates graciously adjust our course.<br>
Our ship and theirs cruise onward, to the center of the storm that still bursts with flashes and lightning.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Golden Hind：</span><br>
Grab something and hold on tight, now!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Royal Fortune：</span><br>
Ahoy! The door to the New World will open any second now!<br>
<br>
Our ship thrusts straight into the storm's center as Royal Fortune boisterously laughs.<br>
{{折叠面板|内容结束}}

{{折叠面板|标题=To Tempesta's Retreat|选项=7|主框=1|样式=primary|展开=是}}
<br>
Soon after we weather the storm, an unfamiliar port comes into view.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Is this... Tempesta's new base of operations?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Golden Hind：</span><br>
Why, naturally. It'd be difficult to conduct business around these parts if we didn't have some sort of springboard, so we decided to relocate after a little cost-benefit analysis~<br>
As for what kind of business... You should already be quite familiar with that, so let's not worry about this matter any longer~<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
(I guess that stuff comes part and parcel with being a pirate. It might be better not to pry after all...)<br>
(Now that I think about it, though, we've welcomed quite a few guests from other worlds before. Funny that the shoe's on the other foot this time.)<br>
<br>
After dropping anchors and mooring the ship, our crew officially sets foot onto this unknown land.<br>
The Tempesta members barely have a chance to introduce the situation with the new secret retreat before a lively conversation breaks out.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Royal Fortune：</span><br>
Oh yeah, what were you guys planning to do anyway if you hadn't run into us?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Épée：</span><br>
Oh, umm... I think we were planning t-to take a trip around the tropics...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Fleuret：</span><br>
But, things are way more fun when they don't go as planned, right? Heehee~<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Golden Hind：</span><br>
A trip around the tropics, huh? Sounds pretty nice to me~ Might even be a good opportunity to find something special for my collection.<br>
Having that said, as nice as the tropical scenery might be, there's nothing unique or special about it.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">São Martinho：</span><br>
In other words, you're chiefly interested in seeking out something unforgettable?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Golden Hind：</span><br>
Yeah, more or less~<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Adventure Galley：</span><br>
...I'm not sure that's something you can count on.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Golden Hind：</span><br>
I guess you've got a point. Well, we can always save this discussion for later.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Sovetskaya Rossiya：</span><br>
Mmh. If it's unforgettable sights you seek, you'll not want to miss out on the auroras.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Adventure Galley：</span><br>
Auroras?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Sovetskaya Rossiya：</span><br>
Yes, magnificent bands of light that hang down like curtains from the skies.<br>
Such dazzling, vivid colors... These phenomena can be observed from both poles, and it's said that a single glance at their spectacular nightglow will burn the scenery into your memory forever.<br>
Of course, it'll be very cold, but you'll forget all about that the moment you see the aurora.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Royal Fortune：</span><br>
Woah, I'm getting fired up just from hearing about it! That sounds like one of those adventures worth putting your life on the line for!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Golden Hind：</span><br>
I'm sure a photo of the aurora would make an excellent addition to my collection~♪<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Liverpool：</span><br>
I'll handle the photography! I'll make sure to capture every breathtaking moment!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Svirepy：</span><br>
Hrm? Are you sure your phone will work in the sheer cold? The electronics might freeze over or something.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Liverpool：</span><br>
*gasp*... You're right! I'll ask Ingraham if she can do something about it...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">New Jersey：</span><br>
Well, since we've all been talking about the same thing for a while now, why don't we formally set course for the polar south?<br>
The Tempesta crew seems to be on board as well, and opportunities to hang out and try something new don't come around too often. Let's all head down there together, yeah?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Royal Fortune：</span><br>
Alrighty then! Let's vote on it, pirate-style! If everyone agrees on the same thing, we'll ask Commander to change course!<br>
Now then, can I see a show of hands? All in favour–<br>
<br>
Everyone present raises their hands. Royal Fortune and Golden Hind turn to me triumphantly.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
(Okay, there are no logistical issues. We're fully resupplied from Seabreeze Island, so... we've got ourselves our next destination.)<br>
<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项1：Set sail for the polar south!</span>'''''<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项2：Let's go find an aurora!</span>'''''<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Royal Fortune：</span><br>
Booyah! You're the best, Commander!<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
H-hey, easy there, Royal Fortune! No need to glomp me!<br>
<br>
Just as the merry discussion is starting to wrap up, I suddenly hear someone's stomach growling.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Whydah：</span><br>
So hungry... Time to tap into my emergency supply of crisps and cola... Be right back, running to my room real quick...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Dunkerque：</span><br>
I don't think that potato chips and cola counts as a proper meal... Why not head back to the cruise ship? There's plenty of food on board.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Harbin：</span><br>
It'd be a pity to turn back around as soon as we got here. How about we whip up something to eat here?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Golden Hind：</span><br>
Hmm... That sounds pretty promising. How does a bonfire barbecue sound?<br>
You know, a setting where everyone can sit around the bonfire, chat freely, and get to know each other while eating. It sure beats a stuffy dinner banquet – right, Commander?<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
I'm fine with that, but isn't it a bit early for that?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Golden Hind：</span><br>
What? Did anyone ever make a rule that you can't have a bonfire barbecue in broad daylight? Besides, it's the will of the people~<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Mary Celeste：</span><br>
A barbecue sounds nice... but I could do without the bonfire...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Golden Hind：</span><br>
Sorry, but that's not an option~ You'll be joining us as well, Mary, and I can't have you disappearing on us~<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Mary Celeste：</span><br>
Eep! Commander, save meeeee!<br>
<br>
Despite it being way too early in the day, our "Big Bonfire Barbecue Bonanza" kicked off without a hitch.<br>
Under the direction of Royal Fortune, Lung Wu and the rest of the cooking crew begin bringing out the meat.<br>
Littorio, Sovetsky Soyuz, and Adventure Galley supply the drinks.<br>
The high-quality ham that São Martinho brought over is sliced thinly, then paired together with Owari's freshly-farmed melons for a light and savory snack.<br>
Laughter fills the air around this strange port, and everyone quickly comes to deepen their understanding of each other.<br>
Before I realize it, the barbecue bonanza is already winding down, and someone signals its end by sticking a sword into the bonfire.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Queen Elizabeth：</span><br>
I am most satisfied with the success of this bonfire barbecue, but there's still something lacking to truly make this day spectacular.<br>
That's right! To truly elevate today's atmosphere... we require a ballroom dancing corner!<br>
Yes, yes. Let's make our preparations in the main hall! Bel, gather the Royal Maids and have them decorate the main hall accordingly!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Belfast：</span><br>
As you wish, Your Majesty.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Jean Bart：</span><br>
Wasn't into ballroom dancin' back then. Still ain't now.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Queen Elizabeth：</span><br>
Excuse me? Does this Iris swashbuckler have any better ideas? If not, do as I say!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Royal Fortune：</span><br>
Ballroom dancing is THE symbol of elegance and high class. Us piratey types don't mesh well with that, you know.<br>
If you really want to dance that badly, why not opt for something like a masquerade ball?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Golden Hind：</span><br>
Yeah, that could work~ If anything, a masquerade ball would allow us to accentuate our pirate-ness~<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Whydah：</span><br>
Uhhh... both options are equally a pain in the bum.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Adventure Galley：</span><br>
I'm also in favour of a masquerade ball.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Bristol：</span><br>
Woah, that's a basically a costume party, right? I need to go grab my explorer's outfit and robo hunting hound that I put together the other day!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Queen Elizabeth：</span><br>
Hold it right there. We still haven't decided on a theme for the masquerade ball, right?<br>
If everyone decides to show up in whatever they feel like, that'd be way too chaotic!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Golden Hind：</span><br>
That sounds perfectly fine to me. Let's not go with a theme, and let people come in whatever costume suits them.<br>
<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项1：I think Golden Hind's got the right idea.</span>'''''<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
More people can participate in whatever capacity they're comfortable with if we have fewer restrictions.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Queen Elizabeth：</span><br>
Et tu, my servant? ...I suppose I don't mind going along with that idea! Now then, my maids shall see to it that the venue is set up properly!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Natori：</span><br>
Looks like it's your time to shine, Old Man. "Damn straight!"<br>
<br>
And so, the bonfire barbecue comes to a close amidst the joyous din of chatter and laughter.<br>
In addition to the Royal Maids, a lot of the other shipgirls volunteer to help staff the masquerade ball.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
(Let's see if there's anything I can do to help.)<br>

<br>
I am resting in my room when I'm suddenly woken up by the sound of my phone ringing.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
(Is Long Island slacking off again or something...)<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Royal Fortune：</span><br>
Commander, are you awake? Can you open the door?<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Royal Fortune?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Royal Fortune：</span><br>
The one and only! I have something important to tell you, so please open the door!<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Gotcha. I'll be right there–<br>
<br>
I throw on my clothes as quickly as possible and go to meet Royal Fortune at the door.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Royal Fortune：</span><br>
I've come to inform you that the cruise ship's destination has been updated, and we are now heading for the polar south!<br>
We'll need to get through one more storm before we can leave this area though, so I'm just giving you a heads-up in advance!<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
I can handle a little turbulence. More importantly, how come nobody told me that we'd be leaving today?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Royal Fortune：</span><br>
Well, uhh, you've technically been abducted by Tempesta, right? So, of course we get to call the shots.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
I guess that's true. Nobody's ever heard of the abductee getting to decide what to do and where to go.<br>
But, surely you didn't come all the way here just to tell me that?<br>
Is there something else you need my help with?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Royal Fortune：</span><br>
One sec, let me check for you... Oh, it's from Emden... A mysterious event of some sort is going to be held at the café during lunchtime. It says, "please come check it out, Commander."<br>
And that concludes the morning news from the high seas!<br>
<br>
After Royal Fortune leaves, I decide to head out and take a walk around the cruise ship.<br>
When I arrive on the deck, the cruise ship is in the midst of heading to the storm's core.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Bismarck：</span><br>
A storm that manifests out of nowhere... That's worth researching. Assuming it even can be measured.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Akashi：</span><br>
How it works in principle is beyond me, nya. I can't even get usable footage of it because of this awful interference, nya.<br>
<br>
The ship weathers the storm without rocking too hard, then returns to the regular, tranquil seas.<br>
While it's uncertain how much the storm affected the ship's course, what is clear is that we're in polar waters now.<br>
As we sail further, more and more drifting ice floes become visible all around us.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Fleuret：</span><br>
Woo! Didn't expect going through a storm to be so thrilling! It was like being on a rollercoaster. Though, rollercoasters are better.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Javelin：</span><br>
Yeah, it's completely different to speeding along with your rigging! It's fun, even if it made me a little dizzy.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Le Téméraire：</span><br>
It would be nice if we could have a similar attraction back at the port! Just saying!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Z46：</span><br>
Heroes who braved the storm, engrave this memory upon your minds. A monument shall be erected to immortalize this brave feat of ours.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Épée：</span><br>
I also want an attraction like that... i-if it's not too much work for the Commander, I mean...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Mogador：</span><br>
Heheheh... Let's not forget to put the seats reeeal close together so we can rub shoulders with the Commander.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Alsace：</span><br>
R-rub shoulders? You mean... No, no, no, no! Dirty thoughts, get out of my mind!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Mogador：</span><br>
Oopsies. Alsace is overheating again.<br>
<br>
Closing my eyes to that tomfoolery, I start earnestly thinking about how to build such an attraction.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
I've been thinking about expanding the amusement park, and we could use another attraction or two.<br>
I'll add it to my to-do list. Obviously, hammering out the details will have to come after we're home again.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Fleuret：</span><br>
Yippee!<br>
<br>
While they all excitedly discuss the amusement park's expansion, the ice floats are getting more and more frequent.<br>
At the same time, I can see the outline of an iceberg on the horizon.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
(A cruise through polar waters, and an iceberg... Uh-oh.)<br>
(No, I'm probably overthinking it. With specs like this ship has, a collision isn't even a one-in-a-million possibility.)<br>
(Plus, we're cruising as normal and TB hasn't sounded any alarm. I'll just find something to do and forget about this.)<br>

<br>
The phone in my cabin won't stop ringing.<br>
I put on my shirt, button up, then pick up the receiver.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Long Island：</span><br>
Hiii! Ghostie here, ready to give you your schedule for today.<br>
The ship is cruising on just as planned. Assuming nothing happens, we'll reach our destination by tomorrow.<br>
By the way, I WAS going to give you my report in-person today, buuut...<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
But...?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Long Island：</span><br>
But tonight is finally game night! I want to start practicing right away to find my flow!<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Get real! You just want to play games all day!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Long Island：</span><br>
What was that? I can't hear you! The reception is really bad here at the North Pole!<br>
Oh, also, you should come to the arcade if you wanna participate in the game night! That's all – bye-bye!<br>
<br>
She hangs up right on the spot.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
(Ugh... Typical Long Island. Nobody told me about a "game night" until now, though. Maybe I'll check it out later.)<br>
<br>
I exit my cabin and get on the deck. Unsurprisingly, many from the Northern Parliament are here.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
(Yup. Not the least surprised to see them out here right now.)<br>
<br>
On one side, I see Avrora, Kirov and Pamiat' surrounded by empty, rolled-over bottles. On the other, Kursk is standing alone, gazing at the ice field.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Poltava：</span><br>
Try not to have too much or you'll be too drunk for the event later tonight.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Svirepy：</span><br>
Ah... Achoo! Someone pour me a glass!<br>
Bleh... I brought my warmest blanket, and I'm still freezin' my ass off here! Achoo!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Poltava：</span><br>
Have you considered going back to the cabin area to warm up?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Svirepy：</span><br>
Hell no! I can handle a little co– Achoo!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Poltava：</span><br>
Fine. If you won't listen to me, maybe you'll listen to the Commander.<br>
<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项1：(Side with Poltava.)</span>'''''<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项2：(Get closer and warm Svirepy up.)</span>'''''<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项1）</span>'''''You heard the lady. Let's get you back to your cabin.<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项1）</span>'''''Or would you rather catch a cold and be stuck indoors for the rest of the trip?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Svirepy：</span><br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项2）</span>'''''H-h-hey! Give me room to breathe!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Svirepy：</span><br>
Okay, okay! I'll go back to my damn cabin!<br>
<br>
Svirepy retires indoors with her blanket, after which I turn around and address all the Northern Parliament girls.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
You're all out here awfully early. Have you missed the ice and the snow?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Sovetsky Soyuz：</span><br>
Partly, yes, but I'm also secretly hoping we'll run into new animals of some kind. Are you not hoping the same, Comrade Commander?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Kirov：</span><br>
Yes, our motherland lies in the Arctic Circle, but this is the ANTARCTIC circle, Comrade Commander. It's a completely different experience for us.<br>
It is amazing that life persists out here. It's a representation of nature's indomitable spirit.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Sovetsky Soyuz：</span><br>
Yes. Just think of the round and fluffy penguins with comparatively small feet that live here.<br>
My heart races just imagining such strange and adorable creatures walking around!<br>
Also, I think it's worth stating that we aren't the only ones gathered here.<br>
All of us are here on this ship, and we've all shared such wonderful times. Most of all, it couldn't have happened without you, Comrade Commander.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Grozny：</span><br>
I'll drink to that. Thanks for everything, Comrade Commander!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Kirov：</span><br>
I raise this toast to you, Comrade Commander!<br>
Where's your glass? Go get one and I'll pour you a drink!<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Thanks, but I'm good. I'll just have water.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Kirov：</span><br>
Very well. Then once again, comrades, let's give a toast to Comrade Commander! Uraaa!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Everyone：</span><br>
Uraaa!<br>
<br>
More of our friends gather one after another, drawn by the lively mood.<br>
This extraordinary morning passes by in a flash as we all chat excitedly about our expectations for the destination and the aurora waiting there for us.<br>
{{折叠面板|内容结束}}

{{折叠面板|标题=Wish Upon an Aurora|选项=10|主框=1|样式=primary|展开=是}}
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Communicator：</span><br>
RING RING RING! RING RING RING!<br>
<br>
There's that ringtone again. It's Memphis.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Memphis：</span><br>
Good morning, Commander. I was tasked with briefing you today. Shall we meet at your workstation again?<br>
<br>
Cruise Ship - Workspace<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Memphis：</span><br>
The ship has arrived at our destination. However, at this time of year, the South Pole experiences polar night. Please pay special attention to your circadian rhythm.<br>
We plan to begin our trip to port tomorrow, so there are no particular events planned for today.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Tomorrow already, huh... It feels like we left on this vacation just yesterday.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Memphis：</span><br>
Agreed. That just goes to show that time flies when you're having fun.<br>
Treasure today while you still can, Commander! I'm doing the same, so I'm leaving now!<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Thanks. I'll follow your lead.<br>
<br>
With that, she leaves my workspace. After cleaning up some odds and ends, I grab my hat and step out onto the deck.<br>
I'm instantly faced with a sky the likes of which I'd never seen before. The aurora hangs down from above as curtains of light, covering the sky and stars.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
(Going with the flow is one thing, but I never expected our vacation to end this way.)<br>
(Along the way, everyone had all sorts of fun in their own ways. That's enough to make me happy.)<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Harbin：</span><br>
Yo, Commander! You're finally here.<br>
I was just chatting with everyone. A lot happened during this trip, but we've all had fun.<br>
How about you? Did you enjoy it?<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
A lot really has happened, but I can't think of any of it that wasn't fun. I know I'm satisfied.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Harbin：</span><br>
Ahaha, that's great! Going through the work to make this a thing was worth it, then.<br>
Take a look over there, Commander. Everyone's got a few words for you.<br>
<br>
Harbin pats me on the shoulder. I turn around and see everyone waving at me.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Queen Elizabeth：</span><br>
We won't bother asking if you had fun! How can one not have fun when Queen Elizabeth herself is involved?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Saratoga：</span><br>
Hehe! You just loved your vacation with Sister Sara, didn't you?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Richelieu：</span><br>
Make no mistake, Commander, your presence was a key factor in everyone having such a wonderful time.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Clemenceau：</span><br>
That's right. Commander, you're our axis and our core alike. Don't forget to relax and enjoy yourself, though.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Bristol：</span><br>
Whoa... There's something about that smile that makes me shudder.<br>
Uh, anyway, that's not important! I'm here to thank you for helping us investigate the mysteries of the cruise, Commander!<br>
Sooner or later, you're sure to become a legendary investigator... I gotta work harder so I can keep up with you!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">New Jersey：</span><br>
Heheh. Basically, honey, everyone thinks you're the best!♪<br>
We all got to enjoy our time together thanks to you!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Anchorage：</span><br>
Teacher... Anchorage had lots of fun! I want... to go on more and more vacations with you!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Yat Sen：</span><br>
I think I speak for all of us when I say this vacation was like a dream come true, Commander. I'll cherish these memories forever.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Royal Fortune：</span><br>
Spending time with the Commander AND seeing all these pretty sights? Heheh, when you remember the aurora, you'd better think of me!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Golden Hind：</span><br>
Seeing the beautiful aurora made the whole trip worthwhile~ But I still don't have the most important part of my collection. Commander, I'm waiting for you with open arms~♡<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Whydah：</span><br>
*yaaawn*... I don't like all the effort, but if it means getting to be with you... I can handle a little, I guess...<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
(Everyone really felt this way?)<br>
Know what? I say we should end this vacation with a feast. Who's with me?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">New Jersey：</span><br>
You want to start putting together a banquet now? Surely we won't make it in time.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Richelieu：</span><br>
We must let Dunkerque and the others rest, too. Would we be able to swing it without them?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Harbin：</span><br>
Easy-peasy! We can just have a barbecue on deck.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Mary Celeste：</span><br>
Barbecue? Y-you want to start another bonfire...?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Harbin：</span><br>
Don't worry! If you're that scared, then let's just barbecue over charcoal! Hell, let everyone barbecue their own food, and we won't have to ask the chefs for help.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Unzen：</span><br>
You do have a point... Shall we go with her idea?<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Yeah. Let's do it!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Harbin：</span><br>
Alright, everyone! Let's gather on the cruise ship's garden! It's spacious enough to be perfect for a barbecue!<br>
<br>
Everyone scampers off to prepare for the barbecue at once.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
(We're going to savor this last day under the aurora, I swear it.)<br>

<span style="color:#4eb24e;">{namecode:448}：</span><br>
Human, my darling human, it's time to wake up~ "Are you just begging for Emden's punishment?"<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Morning, Emden.<br>
<br>
In the morning, Emden comes to my bedside. By now, I've gotten wholly used to the sight of this.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">{namecode:448}：</span><br>
Heehee♡ The cruise ship is already on its way back. But... "A new variable has appeared, human."<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
A variable?<br>
(As in, a chance occurrence? To be fair, a lot of unexpected things have happened so far, but now of all times?)<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">{namecode:448}：</span><br>
Emden did promise to spirit you off to blissful paradise...<br>
And if you so desired, it would be trivial for Emden to take the ship on just the slightest detour...<br>
"But Emden did not cause this trouble. See for yourself, human."<br>
<br>
I make myself presentable and step out on deck.<br>
For some reason, Tempesta are still there. I remember they claimed that they planned to go home after we all saw the aurora together.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Golden Hind：</span><br>
Well hello there, Commander~ As you can see, we won't be able to go back to our base for a while...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Adventure Galley：</span><br>
Surely we won't be stuck here forever, right?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Whydah：</span><br>
I wouldn't mind... Things are less of a bother here, and I get better sleep.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Can't you just call forth another tempest and go through there? Like you did when you came here?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Royal Fortune：</span><br>
Commander, have you ever seen a storm near the South Pole?<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Yes...?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Royal Fortune：</span><br>
*cough!* *cough!* Well, uh, OUR tempests can only show up when on blue seas under blue skies!<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
(Very well thought out excuse... Well, I'm happy to let them stay here as long as they want.)<br>
Shame. In that case, try to withstand your homesickness and hang out with us for a few more–<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Royal Fortune：</span><br>
WOOHOO!<br>
<br>
After appeasing the pirates of Tempesta, I decide to make my way to the wheelhouse.<br>
There, Emden awaits.<br>
She's in the middle of writing something in her little notepad again.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">{namecode:448}：</span><br>
Heehee. What did you think, my darling human? Did you find your answer?<br>
<br>
The white Emden closes her notepad a little, tucks her hair behind her ear, and smiles...<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Are the Tempesta shipgirls the only other conspirators?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">{namecode:448}：</span><br>
Heehee, good question. "Probing for an answer now would be boorish, human."<br>
"Just enjoy your vacation and all of its surprises♥" Emden's darling human♡<br>
<br>
Outside the window, the aurora still dazzles in the sky.<br>
Pleasure, Leisure, and Treasure THE END<br>

<br>
After a late-night call from Bristol, I come to the so-called "mystery room" at the ship's stern.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Bristol：</span><br>
A holiday cruise, a vacation paradise.<br>
Luxury, comfort, leisure, highlights of our time together.<br>
But light always casts a shadow!<br>
Bang, bang! Clap, clap! Dadadadadum!<br>
I received a revelation within a dream. When the stars align...<br>
Seven mysteries will come to light on this ship!<br>
Everyone is destined to be affected! Including YOU, dear listener!<br>
You will! Unless you make the perfect decisions at every turn, that is!<br>
Prove to all of us that you have the sagacity and bravery to pursue the truth!<br>
Now, join the Investigation Committee!<br>
Come, be the detective you were born to be!<br>

'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项3）</span>'''''Ahem! I hereby declare the official formation of the Cruise Mystery-Solving Investigation Committee!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Bristol：</span><br>
Naturally, I will be the captain and investigator numero uno! Codename: Lamplight Scholar!<br>

Fu Shun, investigator number two, reporting in! Codename: Overlord of Adventure!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Alfredo Oriani：</span><br>
Wherever the news goes, I follow! Investigator three, Alfredo Oriani, the Turbo Journo!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Emanuele Pessagno：</span><br>
Ugh, so this is why you called us all here...<br>
Let them have their fun. Commander, let's go.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Alfredo Oriani：</span><br>
Hey, wait a sec! I really need a scribe for this one! Please!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Emanuele Pessagno：</span><br>
Uuugh...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Bristol：</span><br>
Heheh, we got ourselves a scribe for the Turbo Journo! Let's see, your codename can be...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Emanuele Pessagno：</span><br>
I don't want one.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Bristol：</span><br>
Okay, Scribe it is. Alsace, your turn!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Alsace：</span><br>
Sacrament of the Unified Orthodoxy, an unreachable dream, guardian of the Holy See, sword of the Commander – Alsace, Cold-Blooded Killing Machine, joins the fray!<br>
Commander, let's pursue the mysteries of this ship and corner the truth!<br>
<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项1：Wait, run that last nickname by me again?</span>'''''<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项2：Cold-Blooded Killing Machine...?</span>'''''<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Alsace：</span><br>
Heheh. I will have my fill of combat during this investigation, so Bristol gave me the nickname. One has no objections. It's a cool name!<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Bristol, what did you say to convince her?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Bristol：</span><br>
I just told her you were coming. That wasn't a lie!<br>
So, Commander, you're investigator four! Codename: Mysterious Assistant!<br>
Do you like it? Exciting, isn't it? Thrilling, even?!<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
(Honestly, I had a feeling this would happen the moment I saw Bristol and Fu Shun.)<br>
(Mysterious Assistant, huh? It's okay for a codename, I guess. But...)<br>
Do you actually expect crazy mysteries on a brand-new cruise ship?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Bristol：</span><br>
Yes, yes! They'll be wild!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Fu Shun：</span><br>
Help us investigate, Commander! It'll be fun!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Alfredo Oriani：</span><br>
Your involvement will make it a whole lot likelier that mysteries will pop up, too.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Come again?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Alfredo Oriani：</span><br>
A-ahem! That's just how, uh, awesome you are!<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
By the way, where are Fei Yuen and Albacore? You'd think they would be all over something like this...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Fu Shun：</span><br>
Hush! They're in the middle of an undercover investigation!<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Undercover?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Bristol：</span><br>
They blend into crowds, listen in to conversations for any clues, and provide a compiled list of leads to us investigators.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
So they're informants.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Bristol：</span><br>
Now, I hereby declare the first Special Investigation Committee meeting a success!<br>
Commander, keep an eye out for anything weird on the cruise starting tomorrow!<br>
We'll let you know if we hear anything. K.I.T. – keep in touch!<br>
<br>
Thus, the investigation of the cruise's seven mysteries began.<br>
Forget seven, though – would there be any mysteries to investigate?<br>

Bristol gave us the order to assemble, so I go back to the mystery room.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Essex：</span><br>
Coolly analyzing the situation, deftly navigating the scene, elegantly unveiling the truth – Detective Essex has formally joined the investigation team!<br>

<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Essex：</span><br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项1）</span>'''''Hehe... I figured collaborating with a team would be better than working all alone.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Essex：</span><br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项2）</span>'''''Thank you! Together, we will seize the truth!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Essex：</span><br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项3）</span>'''''Hmm... Just "Detective," I guess? If that's too plain, then you can call me the Private Eye of Justice!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Essex：</span><br>
Now, back on topic. I'd like to reveal the clues I've collected so far.<br>
<br>
Essex starts sticking notes she'd written on various mysteries onto the whiteboard.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Fu Shun：</span><br>
Hmm... So many mysteries, in just two days.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Alfredo Oriani：</span><br>
There are even some that happened a little while ago!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Essex：</span><br>
Yes, and even some that I experienced firsthand. Now, as you can see, I've divided them into two groups based on time and type.<br>
First, let's look at the mystery of the strange note.<br>
Thanks to the tireless work of our investigators, we have three clues.<br>
Clue the first: a note under the tray. A wet note was found under a tray in the maid café. The only legible words on it were "come" and "afar."<br>
Clue the second: the crushed bushes. Something left a roughly 30 centimeter big imprint on a bush in the onboard garden.<br>
Clue the third: noise in the gym. Strange sounds like a heavy object being dragged have been heard in various places around the gym.<br>
That is all. What do you think of the incident so far, Commander?<br>
<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项1：We don't have enough clues.</span>'''''<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项2：These are all random coincidences.</span>'''''<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项3：This might sound like it's out of left field, but...</span>'''''<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项1）</span>'''''If we want to solve this, we'll need to investigate further.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Emanuele Pessagno：</span><br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项1）</span>'''''Well said, Commander. I like your firm and precise decision-making.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项2）</span>'''''The note happened to end up under the tray. Everything else is coincidence and can be explained with logic.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Alfredo Oriani：</span><br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项2）</span>'''''Oh, REALLY? I think I smell a cover-up!<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项3）</span>'''''Could it be a giant squid monster that can write and move at supersonic speed?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Essex：</span><br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项3）</span>'''''...C-come again?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Fu Shun：</span><br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项3）</span>'''''Whoa... That's an awesome idea! I'm voting for the Commander's hypothesis!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Essex：</span><br>
Ahem. Now, the second mystery from tonight – food has been disappearing.<br>
We've collected three clues for this one, too.<br>
Clue the first: the stolen stuffing. A container full of freshly-cut meat stuffing vanished in the blink of an eye from the kitchen.<br>
Clue the second: the ransacked fridge. The food storage in the banquet hall was looted. Primarily food that contains meat was stolen.<br>
Clue the third: the untouched warehouse. The warehouse, despite having more food than anywhere else on the ship, has gone completely unscathed.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Fu Shun：</span><br>
Umm... Does the third one count as a clue?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Bristol：</span><br>
We wouldn't have enough if we didn't include it, so yes!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Essex：</span><br>
A-ahem. Commander, a penny for your thoughts?<br>
<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项1：Still not enough clues...</span>'''''<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项2：Think logically...</span>'''''<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项3：This might sound like it's out of left field, but...</span>'''''<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项1）</span>'''''This still isn't enough. We need further investigation.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Fu Shun：</span><br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项1）</span>'''''Again...? Surely you're being too careful.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项2）</span>'''''Someone was watching too much food porn and couldn't handle the hunger pangs anymore.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Fu Shun：</span><br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项2）</span>'''''Um... The meat stuffing was raw, Commander. Would any of us eat that?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Alsace：</span><br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项2）</span>'''''Were they hankering for steak tartare? Understandable... But one must object to stealing food!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Fu Shun：</span><br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项2）</span>'''''Are you serious?<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项3）</span>'''''What if it's a giant squid monster? But like, one that hates veggies and can hack security cameras?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Emanuele Pessagno：</span><br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项3）</span>'''''A giant squid monster...?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Alfredo Oriani：</span><br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项3）</span>'''''That's an incredible conclusion, Commander. I gotta write an article about this!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Bristol：</span><br>
Thank you for your opinions. That concludes our meeting for today!<br>
Everyone, return to your duties and keep up the good work!<br>

<br>
Cruise Ship - Warehouse<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Bristol：</span><br>
Commander, Fu Shun, Essex, Alfredo, Ema, Alsace... and me, Bristol. Yep, the gang's all here.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Fu Shun：</span><br>
Yeah! So? Out with it! What do we do now, Captain?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Bristol：</span><br>
Naturally... it's time to review our third mystery!<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Then why did we gather here in the warehouse instead of the mystery room?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Essex：</span><br>
I think we'll have a freer range of motion here. Don't worry, Commander. I'll explain everything.<br>
We still have time before we get started, so let's review the third case: the ghost of the cabin quarter.<br>
Once again, we have exactly three clues.<br>
Clue the first: footsteps in the night. Mysterious footsteps can be heard from a corridor near the cabins late at night.<br>
Clue the second: spirit photography. Alfredo Oriani got a picture of a ghost in one corridor.<br>
Clue the third: the inescapable corridor. In one corridor, a thick fog appears and disorients people passing through.<br>
As usual, Commander, I'd like to hear your thoughts.<br>
<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项1：All of these have logical explanations.</span>'''''<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项2：I have an idea who the culprit is.</span>'''''<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项3：Okay, bear with me here. No – SQUID with me here.</span>'''''<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项1）</span>'''''Well, all of this can be explained with science. There isn't even a mystery here. It's all just dumb rumors.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Bristol：</span><br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项1）</span>'''''Yeah! And that means that this series of events was all artificially set up!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Fu Shun：</span><br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项1）</span>'''''We've already identified the suspect, too!<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项2）</span>'''''Water vapor, sea fog, ghosts... Tempesta has to be behind this.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Emanuele Pessagno：</span><br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项2）</span>'''''Incredible, Commander... You reached that conclusion this quickly? It took us hours of discussion to figure it out.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项3）</span>'''''Because the ghost might just be a giant squid monster that can disappear and spew sea fog at will.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Alsace：</span><br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项3）</span>'''''*sigh*... Commander, now isn't the time for jokes.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Essex：</span><br>
I think we can all agree that Tempesta must be the culprits behind this series of events.<br>
I've found it strange ever since the ship was attacked.<br>
Tempesta has to pass through a storm to come to our world. Don't you find it a little convenient that they'd appear at the perfect place and time to get in our way?<br>
This leads us naturally to one answer: Tempesta sent informants onto the cruise ship ahead of time. They coordinated the ambush.<br>
The sounds of dragging things, strange noises, disappearing food, water vapor, and sea fog... All of it is evidence that someone with Tempesta is on board.<br>
The clue we found while investigating the ghost is the most damning of all. Tempesta just happens to have one shipgirl who can turn invisible, does it not?<br>
And what do you know, that same girl didn't appear during the attack today!<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
It's Mary Celeste!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Essex：</span><br>
Exactly! She's the culprit behind everything that's been happening!<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Mary definitely does seem to be the likely culprit.<br>
So, we know who the mastermind is. I still don't understand why we assembled in the warehouse today.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Bristol：</span><br>
To catch her red-handed, of course! Heheh, Essex set a brilliant trap. Our prey should take the bait any minute now!<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
A trap?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Essex：</span><br>
Earlier, feigning small talk, I told Mary Celeste at the wharf that you would be coming to take inventory in the warehouse tonight. Alone.<br>
She was visibly disturbed. By then, I already knew that I had her in my grasp.<br>
Shh. Everyone but the Commander, hide. The pressure sensor I set up just went off – someone's coming.<br>
<br>
The sound of footsteps suddenly becomes audible in the seemingly empty warehouse.<br>
When the sound stops, suddenly, something soft presses against my back.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Mary Celeste：</span><br>
(Phew... I can finally be alone with the Commander...)<br>
(Something's really wrong with this cruise ship. I can go invisible, and it's still so darn hard to get close to you!)<br>
Ahem. Don't move! Yarrr, I be a pirate!<br>
<br>
A silhouette emerges out of thin air. It's Mary Celeste.<br>
Our hypothesis from before was right on the money. Mary Celeste and her pet, the giant squid(?) monster Argo, are the ones behind all of these mysteries.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Alfredo Oriani：</span><br>
*snap!*<br>
Heheh, got my evidence!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Fu Shun：</span><br>
Finally, the adventure reaches its climax!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Bristol：</span><br>
The truth of the seven mysteries will now be unveiled!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Essex：</span><br>
There can only be one truth: Mary Celeste, you are the culprit!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Alsace：</span><br>
Cold-Hearted Killing Machine, entering extermination mode!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Mary Celeste：</span><br>
W-wait, wait, wait! You don't have to go that far!<br>
Hahaha... I can't believe you got me that fast. And you even set a trap... Not bad, not bad at all.<br>
I admit defeat. You got me. What are you gonna do to me, Commander?<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Hmm... Illegal boarding, food theft, attempted kidnapping...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Mary Celeste：</span><br>
H-huh? You're actually planning to punish me?!<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
I'm kidding. But it is true that your flippant actions have caused trouble for everyone else on the cruise. How do you plan to make up for that?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Mary Celeste：</span><br>
Heheh, easy! I've already got a plan.<br>
A late-night bonfire party at Tempesta HQ. All are invited! How's that sound?<br>
{{折叠面板|内容结束}}

<br>
According to our informants, Albacore and Fei Yuen, more mysteries have cropped up all over the cruise ship.<br>
The aquarium, classroom, ammunition depot, and more have been affected.<br>
Thus, the Cruise Mystery-Solving Investigation Committee holds an emergency meeting.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Bristol：</span><br>
Ahem! Thank you all for coming on such short notice!<br>
I trust you were all briefed on the reason for this emergency meeting on your way here!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Alsace：</span><br>
One admits utmost surprise... How could it happen again?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Fu Shun：</span><br>
Heheh. I knew we solved those last three too easily. There had to be more to it!<br>
After all, it's supposed to be SEVEN mysteries. Three is less than seven!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Essex：</span><br>
Now, suspect number one, we'd like your testimony. Do you have anything to say about this?<br>
You have the right to remain silent. Anything you say can and will be used against you in a court of law.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Mary Celeste：</span><br>
I didn't do anything this time! I swear on my afterlife!<br>
This cruise has already been hijacked by Tempesta, right? We did what we came here for. Why would I have anything left to hide?<br>
Besides, you got me on my pranks already. I'm not stupid enough to keep trying.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Essex：</span><br>
Hmm... You do have a point.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Alfredo Oriani：</span><br>
In that case... Is this one a real mystery?!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Emanuele Pessagno：</span><br>
Or could there be another mastermind lurking in the shadows?<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
(I had a feeling already. This seems to confirm it.)<br>
I'd like to confirm a few things about the chance of someone else pulling the strings.<br>
<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项1：The first thing I want to ask is...</span>'''''<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Mary, have you heard the rumors of an inescapable corridor?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Mary Celeste：</span><br>
Inescapable corridor... Nope. First I've heard of it.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
During our previous investigation, we discovered a certain corridor in the cabin quarters where thick sea fog caused people to lose their sense of direction. Did you set that up?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Mary Celeste：</span><br>
Hmm... Nah, doubt that's me.<br>
I went through plenty of corridors when I was looking for food, and I didn't make any fog to throw people off. Never needed to.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
I thought so.<br>
<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项1：Next, I want to ask you...</span>'''''<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Essex, if you had to choose between joining me for a drink at the open bar or continuing your work as a detective, which would you choose?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Essex：</span><br>
I don't even have to think! I'd choose going to the bar with you, of course!<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Hmm... Okay.<br>
(Now... We can't answer the last question here.)<br>
(It's about the very first mystery – that note that said "come" and "afar.")<br>
(No... I might just have my guess already.)<br>
(But I lack evidence. I'd better observe for a little longer.)<br>

<br>
On the final night before our return, Detective Essex summons me one last time. This time, we meet on the unloading deck.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Essex：</span><br>
You finally arrive, Commander. Are you ready to begin our final investigation?<br>
<br>
"Essex" smiles, waiting for my reply.<br>
<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项1：What are we investigating?</span>'''''<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Essex：</span><br>
The final of the seven mysteries, of course...<br>
...Whether Detective Essex is real or fake.<br>
Go on, Mysterious Assistant. Tell me your hypothesis.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Confessing already? That makes things easier for me.<br>
The real Essex did, of course, assist in the investigations. But there's no doubt that there was a fake in our midst at times.<br>
More specifically, the Essex that came to meetings was real, while the one there for investigations was an impostor.<br>
As for the real identity of the fake Essex...<br>
<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项1：You're Observer!</span>'''''<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项2：It's you, squid lady!</span>'''''<br>
<span style="color:#ff9b93;">Observer ：</span><br>
Heheheh♪ Not bad! You didn't just arrive at the truth – you discerned everything at every step of the way.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
I noticed something was off ever since we met in the gym.<br>
When I invited you to the bar, you refused and said you wanted to keep investigating.<br>
The real Essex would never refuse that offer.<br>
But it was clever how you used Mary as a scapegoat.<br>
This is a big ship, and a lot has happened. You knew that I don't have the time and energy to verify everything.<br>
You used that fact to your advantage. There were several times when I had my doubts, but every time, my attention was diverted somewhere else.<br>
I only realized it after we'd apprehended Mary and I was able to look back to the first night when the mysteries started cropping up.<br>
Last night was when I first became certain that it was you – and that you'd have no reason to hide it anymore.<br>
<span style="color:#ff9b93;">Observer ：</span><br>
And so you predicted that I would summon you tonight?<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Yeah. You maneuvered so I would, too, didn't you?<br>
<span style="color:#ff9b93;">Observer ：</span><br>
Heehee. I see, I see~ Why don't you call your friends for help, then?<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Do you want me to do that?<br>
<span style="color:#ff9b93;">Observer ：</span><br>
Why do you think I wouldn't?<br>
Heehee. I admit that I blundered when you invited me to the bar. I could've never imagined that was how you got me.<br>
I'll be more careful next time.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Next time? Are you going to do this again?<br>
<span style="color:#ff9b93;">Observer ：</span><br>
Don't you want me to?<br>
Your Observer, come from afar, bids you farewell. I had so much fun... this round.<br>

<br>
When I arrive at the banquet, I find that Harbin is already there, waiting for me.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Harbin：</span><br>
Great of you to show, Commander! Been waiting for you.<br>
C'mere, don't just stand there. Hey, everyone! The Commander's arrived! Open 'er up!<br>
<br>
A beautiful sight unfolds – the banquet is filled with people laughing, chatting, and generally having a good time.<br>
There are tables lined from end to end with various cuisines. There is even an ornate dessert stand atop one of them.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Harbin：</span><br>
Whaddya think? Really gets the stomach grumbling, doesn't it? Have a seat and chow down!<br>
<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项1：Man, this smells delicious!</span>'''''<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项2：You really went all out!</span>'''''<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Harbin：</span><br>
For sure! Tons of good grub livens up any party.<br>
I had crates and crates of ingredients shipped in from the Empery to give everyone a taste of our home.<br>
Of course, I couldn't have done it alone. All the folks who helped are the party's real MVPs! Ahahah!<br>
The chefs 'mong us are flexing their cooking muscles in the kitchen, so all you gotta do is enjoy their food!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Queen Elizabeth：</span><br>
Hmph. I hoped to flaunt the Royal Islands' traditional cuisine, but the plebeians all insisted we keep it strictly to tea and desserts...<br>
"They're so delicious we can't get them out of our mind," they said. Bollocks! Suit yourselves, then!<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
(She's complaining, but she's happy in spite of that. Thank god I won't have to eat Royal cuisine this time.)<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Chi An：</span><br>
*sigh*... And I wanted to display my cooking skills as well, but the Security Committee stopped me.<br>
I've been practicing really hard, I promise! I just wanted you to taste how far I've come, Commander...<br>
<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项1：Good job, Security Committee!</span>'''''<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项2：There, there.</span>'''''<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Chi An：</span><br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项1）</span>'''''Even YOU don't believe me? *sob*... I'm hurt...<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项1）</span>'''''No, I mean that there's more than enough food as it is and I'd hate to see it go to waste. You can cook just for me another time.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项2）</span>'''''Don't be sad. There's always next time.<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项2）</span>'''''The cruise only just started. You'll get your chance to cook soon! For now, just enjoy the party.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Chi An：</span><br>
You mean it? You have to promise you'll eat what I make, then!<br>
<br>
As the celebrations continue, I see Richelieu leisurely walk up to the center of the hall, wine glass in hand.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Richelieu：</span><br>
My dear friends, thank you for gathering here today to celebrate this voyage.<br>
She will surely carry us on many luxurious pleasure cruises. Though she was built through all our efforts, none of those efforts would've been possible without the Commander's support.<br>
I'd like to call the Commander up to give us a few words.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
(Wait, what? Nobody said I'd have to deliver a speech!)<br>
<br>
Sensing my hesitation, Bismarck in the seat next to me chimes in to encourage me.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Bismarck：</span><br>
This is your responsibility as a leader. It's okay if it's off the cuff.<br>
I know you can handle yourself.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
No backing off when the spotlight calls your name, huh?<br>
<br>
I push my chair back a bit, pick up a wine glass, and rise to my feet.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Thank you, everyone, for creating and gathering at this place. Without you, this cruise ship would've never gotten off the ground.<br>
I don't have anything profound to say, only this – I hope you have a relaxing, pleasant cruise.<br>
Cheers to us all!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Richelieu：</span><br>
Cheers!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Bismarck：</span><br>
Cheers.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Queen Elizabeth：</span><br>
You too, servant. Cheers!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Saratoga：</span><br>
Cheers to us all!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Vittorio Veneto：</span><br>
Cheers!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Akagi：</span><br>
Cheers♡<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Sovetsky Soyuz：</span><br>
It warms my heart to see every last one of us gathered in one place.<br>
I raise this toast for you in particular, Comrade Commander.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Yat Sen：</span><br>
Don't we all? Together with you, Commander, we're all headed for a better tomorrow.<br>
<br>
Amids clattering glasses and jubilant toasts, the party reaches its climax.<br>
I've had my fill, so it's time to get up and have a walk around the ship.<br>

<br>
I arrive at the water park at the appointed time.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">New Jersey：</span><br>
There you are, honey! I've been waiting for you!<br>
Sara will give you the rules rundown. I've got to prepare the ace up my sleeve meanwhile.<br>
The indomitable Black Dragon has something amazing in store for you. You'll see what soon!<br>
<br>
Without another word, New Jersey runs off in a hurry.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Saratoga：</span><br>
Hiii! Your favorite dazzling idol is here to explain the rules for you!<br>
This time there won't be any teams – it'll be a free-for-all. That means everyone needs to try their hardest to win!<br>
Now, normally, you'd use paintballs and score by the number of hits, buuut washing off paint is a huge pain. I was at a loss...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Clemenceau：</span><br>
Until I suggested using custom-made Tribunal water guns with sensors.<br>
<br>
Clemenceau joins the conversation, smiling and wearing sports attire.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Clemenceau：</span><br>
When the gun hits a target, it will be automatically recorded on the score screen. No mess, no cleanup required.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Saratoga：</span><br>
What she said! Her idea saved me a huuuge headache.<br>
Since it'll be a battle royale-style match, we've also set the time limit to just 30 minutes to make it interesting.<br>
When the time is up, whoever got hit the most has to do a water-based trust fall as punishment.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Clemenceau：</span><br>
Heehee. An interesting punishment. I can't wait to see how you'll do, Commander.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Wait, don't tell me... YOU'RE participating too?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Clemenceau：</span><br>
Oh, no. Jean Bart is, though. She's quick on the draw, which gives her much better odds of winning than I.<br>
Good luck, Commander. You'll need it to survive the siege that is to come.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Saratoga：</span><br>
Don't expect me to hold back on you! Heehee!<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
(This place is going to be a battlefield... but I'm not going down without a fight!)<br>
<br>
My best efforts to find cover were for nothing. In less than five minutes, I'd been shot from all directions by practically everyone.<br>
Many people pursued me recklessly, even to the point where they'd blatantly expose themselves just to get a shot at me.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
(In these scenarios, I need to pick the time when I move carefully...)<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Saratoga：</span><br>
Where are you looking? I'm right over here!<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Uh-oh!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Enterprise：</span><br>
Move, Commander! I'll cover you!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">New Jersey：</span><br>
Hey, this is a free-for-all! You're not allowed to form teams!<br>
<br>
While Enterprise is busy drawing Saratoga's attention, New Jersey sees an opening and sneaks up behind me.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">New Jersey：</span><br>
I've got you now, honey!<br>
Pew, pew!<br>
<br>
Even though New Jersey landed a hit on me, it could've been much worse – Enterprise's covering fire allowed me to get out of there.<br>
On one side, Marco Polo is chasing Memphis around. On the other, Roon and Akagi are engaged in a fierce battle to the death. Rhetorically speaking.<br>
Meanwhile, Bismarck has seized the high ground. She's picking off everyone who tries to come and get her.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Sovetsky Soyuz：</span><br>
Looks like I've found your hiding spot, Comrade Commander.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Ack!<br>
<br>
Soyuz has her water gun out, but I squeeze the trigger first. My beam of water hits her hand, scoring a hit.<br>
The fight rages on and I manage to make it to new cover, only to find that it's already occupied...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Le Malin：</span><br>
Ugh... It's just you. Don't worry, I won't shoot.<br>
You're more than welcome to shoot me, though. Then I can call it quits and just sleep.<br>
D-don't look at me like that! I just happened to still be here when the match started, so I guess they count me as an active participant.<br>
Fighting is tiring, you know? So I thought I'd wait it out here. Can you please get it over with and shoot me already?<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Well, if that's what you want...<br>
<br>
I aim my water gun and casually take the shot.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Le Malin：</span><br>
Thanks. One bit of advice before I go – watch your back.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
What's that supposed to– Aw, crap!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Jean Bart：</span><br>
Got you!<br>
<br>
Left at Jean Bart's mercy with nowhere to run, it should be no surprise that I received the most hits out of anyone.<br>
As decided, I'm made to stand by the poolside and perform a trust fall.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
I lost, so I'm just going to accept my fate!<br>
<br>
I lean back and fall. Just as I think I'm about to land with a splash, the girls all stop my fall.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Everyone：</span><br>
I've got you!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">New Jersey：</span><br>
Heehee. I'd never betray your trust, honey!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Akagi：</span><br>
Can you feel my warm love seeping through you, Commander?<br>
<br>
Joyful laughter erupts beneath the clear, blue sky, and my heart beats with happiness.<br>
I had a great time with the girls, then changed into a dry set of clothes.<br>
There's still a long while to go before bed, so let's have another look around.<br>
{{折叠面板|内容结束}}

{{折叠面板|标题=Welcome Back to Seabreeze Island|选项=19|主框=1|样式=primary|展开=是}}
<br>
I've verified that there's nothing left to help with on the ship, so I've decided to make landfall on Seabreeze Island.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
(This place brings back fond memories.)<br>
(It started with a treasure hunt, and ended with all of us building vacation infrastructure here.)<br>
(And let's not forget my exchanges with Royal Fortune. Ahh, how time flies.)<br>
(If I remember right, this is where the turtles have made their– Huh?)<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Javelin：</span><br>
Heeelp! Laffey is drowniiing! Somebody heeelp!<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
She's drowning?! Hang on, I'm coming!<br>
<br>
I run like the wind to where Javelin is pointing and find Laffey floating face-up in the water.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Javelin：</span><br>
Help her! Quick!<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
(Wait... did I imagine it, or is she moving around?)<br>
<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项1：(Come closer and have a better look.)</span>'''''<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项2：(Observe her closely.)</span>'''''<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Javelin, shhh. Try to keep quiet.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Javelin：</span><br>
(Oh, okay!)<br>
Phew... She was just sleeping on the back of a big turtle. I was really worried there for a minute.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Let's wake her up. The turtle is heading into deep water, which actually puts her at risk of drowning.<br>
<br>
In the midst of our exchange, Laffey opens her eyes.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Laffey：</span><br>
Mmgh... It's you two... Did you have to wake me up?<br>
I'm still sleepy... I'm going back to bed... Zzz...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Javelin：</span><br>
No, Laffey! If you wanna sleep, find a safer place to do it!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Laffey：</span><br>
I don't wanna get up... I'm not going anywhere...<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
(If she won't get up and do it, I'll just have to carry her there.)<br>
<br>
Javelin and I carry Laffey away from the water and to a safer place. After that, I resume my walk.<br>
Sometime later, I find myself near the vegetable garden.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ping Hai：</span><br>
Hey, is that...? It's the Commander.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Hanazuki：</span><br>
Good day, Commander.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ning Hai：</span><br>
Hi! Do you wanna make a wreath with us? Hanazuki is really good at it!<br>
<br>
Hanazuki, Ning Hai, and Ping Hai wave at me from the garden.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Another time, maybe! I'm on a walk right now.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Hanazuki：</span><br>
I understand. Still, would you mind waiting here just a minute?<br>
Ning, Ping, I'd like to make a big wreath as a gift for the Commander. Will you help?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ning Hai & Ping Hai：</span><br>
- Yeah! - Let's do it!<br>
<br>
The three of them made a beautiful wreath for me. I put it on my head then start walking again.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
(I should be getting near the volcano now... Hm? Is that Marco Polo? What's she doing here?)<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Marco Polo：</span><br>
Volcano! It is I, Marco Polo! I have returned!<br>
Magnificent! The monument I left to commemorate Sardegna's conquering of the island is still there!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Leonardo da Vinci：</span><br>
Please don't tell me you're thinking about moving it...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Marco Polo：</span><br>
That is exactly what I'm thinking! It's what you're here for! Take this monument and load it on the ship back to the port, where it may better spread my name!<br>
Oh, you're here, Commander. You must agree that taking the monument home is a good idea, no?<br>
<br>
She spots me and catches me off guard with a question.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Uhh...<br>
(That thing is massively heavy. Our ship is already loaded with cargo and we'll sink dangerously low if we overburden it.)<br>
(And if that wasn't an issue, where would you even fit it in the port?)<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Clemenceau：</span><br>
Marco, I have a good idea what to do with the statue.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
(Where'd Clemenceau come from? I never knew she was here.)<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Marco Polo：</span><br>
Do you, now? Let's hear this idea of yours.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Clemenceau：</span><br>
If it's prestige you want, leaving it here is the way to go.<br>
The next time someone reaches this summit, they'll see the monument and know that you, Marco Polo, conquered this volcano long ago.<br>
And if you want something to commemorate our visit, why not build a new statue on the ship?<br>
It'll be light enough to transport and more meaningful than this old statue. Think about it – there was no statue on the ship before we set off, was there?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Marco Polo：</span><br>
Good point... Yes, that idea has merit! Da Vinci, come with me! We must look for the perfect place to put that statue!<br>
Come on! Chop-chop!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Leonardo da Vinci：</span><br>
What? Hey! Wait!<br>
<br>
Marco Polo and da Vinci quietly leave the volcano. Only I and Clemenceau are left.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Bravo, mastermind of the Tribunal. You found an opening and nipped the problem in the bud.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Clemenceau：</span><br>
I think it only went so well because I know how what makes Marco tick.<br>
She's actually quite easy to get along with. You know that, don't you?<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
I suppose so.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Clemenceau：</span><br>
Anyway, enough beating around the bush. I've got a message for you.<br>
Z23's group finished their assigned work from last time. They're doing the final checks right now.<br>
The island's infrastructure should be almost entirely finished now.<br>
It'll soon begin operations, producing material and serving as a supply stockpile.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Okay, and where is the paperwork? Do I need to go and find Z23?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Clemenceau：</span><br>
No need. She will pass on the paperwork to Memphis, post-review. All you need to do is relax and enjoy yourself.<br>
<br>
Clemenceau and I part ways, after which I go to a seagull roosting spot on the island.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
(Ayanami isn't here, nor are there any birds. I'll just go somewhere else, then.)<br>
<br>
An hour or two later, we all start walking back to the cruise ship.<br>
After killing some time on the island, it's time to get back on board.<br>

<br>
I've come to the ammo storage, as the schedule dictates.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Sheffield：</span><br>
As the most powerful naval organization in history, our each and every battle is equally important.<br>
<br>
The lights switch on with a click, and Sheffield steps forth from between the shadows and the light.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Sheffield：</span><br>
Even a minor mistake can prove fatal. Therefore, we must always be alert and aware of everything on the battlefield.<br>
<br>
Next, Sheffield and Nevada also come forth.<br>
That makes it one maid-slash-undercover-agent, one cowgirl, and one plainclothed hacker.<br>
Of the three, only Nevada and Sheffield are carrying weapons. This motley crew really doesn't really scream, "powerful naval organization."<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Memphis：</span><br>
Ahem. I know what you're thinking. You shouldn't judge a book by its cover.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Nevada：</span><br>
Hahah! Damn right. Just 'cause I'm dressed for the Wild West doesn't mean I can't fight!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Sheffield：</span><br>
Master, I hope you aren't harbouring doubts about our ability as soldiers.<br>
<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项1：Of course not.</span>'''''<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项2：Maybe I do?</span>'''''<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项1）</span>'''''You've more than proven your ability just by undertaking this mission.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项2）</span>'''''But I'll put them on hold. You'll demonstrate your ability to me another time.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
By the way, do you have any gear I can use? Relying solely on others for protection isn't ideal.<br>
(I don't know about Memphis and Nevada, but Sheffield really likes these drills. Let's see if she'll indulge me.)<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Sheffield：</span><br>
I do not. However, if you would like to have some, you are free to try to steal it from the enemy.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Nevada：</span><br>
Good idea! Now you got me fired up.<br>
<br>
While we've been talking, Memphis has been tapping away at the tablet in her hands.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Memphis：</span><br>
The signal has been isolated. Area ahead, all clear.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Sheffield：</span><br>
Unit 141, commencing escort mission. Master, we will now pass through an active fire zone. Please don't stray too far from us.<br>
<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项1：Got it. Or should I say, roger, pardner!</span>'''''<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Nevada：</span><br>
Hah! You're gettin' it, young'un!<br>
<br>
It was smooth sailing to the next safehouse after Memphis blocked the signal from Soyuz. Or so I thought...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Kronshtadt：</span><br>
You are surrounded! Lay down your arms and surrender!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Sheffield：</span><br>
Tsk. They've already sniffed us out...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Nevada：</span><br>
Memphis, can't you do somethin' with them fancy-schmancy hacking skills?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Memphis：</span><br>
They don't have any equipment hooked up to the 'net. There's nothing TO hack.<br>
All I can do is shut down their comms channel. That'll at least slow them down.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
(For Kronshtadt to do that, it can only mean one of two things...)<br>
(One – they're bluffing and waiting for us to make a move before they launch an all-out attack.)<br>
(Or two – they really do have us surrounded and they want to arrest all of us in one one fell swoop.)<br>
(Whatever the case, I know one thing for certain – they still don't know exactly where we are.)<br>
(If we can exploit that and find out where exactly THEY are, we can turn the tables on them with an ambush...)<br>
Memphis, can you seize control of the ammo depot's security cameras?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Memphis：</span><br>
I can, but TB will catch on to me in no time. At most we'll get 30 seconds.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
That's all I need!<br>
<br>
Using the cameras, I manage to pinpoint Kronshtadt's location. I give Sheffield and Nevada the signal to move.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Sheffield：</span><br>
Understood.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Nevada：</span><br>
Comin' right up!<br>
<br>
Nevada provides covering fire while Sheffield runs faster than the eye can see, getting right behind Kronshtadt.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Now! Do it!<br>
<br>
CLACK CLACK!<br>
I hear the distinct sound of heels hitting the ground amidst the gunfire.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Sovetsky Soyuz：</span><br>
Didn't you hear, Comrade Commander? You're surrounded.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
......<br>
<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项1：(Pull out your secret weapon.)</span>'''''<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
(It's time for my little friend!)<br>
<br>
I take out the stuffed Arctic hare I bought before the drill and throw it at Soyuz.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Sovetsky Soyuz：</span><br>
Oh!<br>
Oh my god! It's so adorable!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Sheffield：</span><br>
......<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Memphis：</span><br>
THAT'S what you meant by "secret weapon"?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Nevada：</span><br>
Well, butter my butt and call me a biscuit...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Sheffield：</span><br>
If it works, it works. Let's get out of here while we have the chance.<br>
<br>
And so, the security drill ended with a surprising twist.<br>
While in truth it didn't have much to do with security, everyone enjoyed it. That's what matters to me.<br>
Time for a short break, then I'll go somewhere else on the ship.<br>
{{折叠面板|内容结束}}

{{折叠面板|标题=The Masquerade Ball|选项=21|主框=1|样式=primary|展开=是}}
<br>
It's time for the masquerade ball. I've come to the nightclub, wearing my usual attire.<br>
To make the place look the part for a ball, they've adjusted the layout, replaced the ornaments, and even rolled out a red carpet.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Scylla：</span><br>
Good evening, Master.<br>
<br>
Scylla lifts the rims of her evening gown and gives me a gracious bow.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Scylla：</span><br>
You chose an... interesting outfit. I can see the thought behind it.<br>
Anyway, allow me to show you inside.<br>
<br>
Shortly after we step inside, Hermione calls for Scylla's help, so she has to leave my side.<br>
I decide to hide away in a corner so I can get a good look at everyone's costumes.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
(Since we didn't decide on a theme, some are wearing actual costumes while others are wearing more casual party dresses.)<br>
<br>
After a while, my phone suddenly rings. It's Kursk.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Kursk：</span><br>
Commander, are you at the ball?<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Yeah. Since you're asking about it, I'm assuming you're here, too.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Kursk：</span><br>
I'm not. Although, I am wearing an Empery dress in the spirit of the event.<br>
I can't stand crowded parties, simple as that. Besides, an experienced hunter prefers to create their own environment so they can approach their prey sneakily.<br>
I'm sure you know what I mean. Bye now.<br>
<br>
She hangs up before I can get another word in.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
(Sounds like she's telling me to come find her later.)<br>
<br>
Just as I fall deep in thought, I suddenly hear a familiar laugh.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Adventure Galley：</span><br>
"Ahahaha! I've finally found you, Master! I've been waiting so, sooo long for you to return..."<br>
Well, what do you think? My costume looks pretty smart, doesn't it?<br>
<br>
Adventure Galley comes and speaks to me, casually placing her giant cleaver on the ground and smiling.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Golden Hind：</span><br>
There you are, my darling! I've been looking aaall over for you~<br>
<br>
Not long after, many more Tempestas gather – Golden Hind, São Martinho, and even Royal Fortune.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Royal Fortune：</span><br>
Sooo... why are you wearing your regular uniform to a masquerade?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">São Martinho：</span><br>
It's almost like you aren't wearing a costume at all.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Golden Hind：</span><br>
I beg to differ. Wearing your regular outfit is like dressing up as yourself. That's what the Commander is doing~<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Royal Fortune：</span><br>
So it's, like, the same, but different? You're saying the Commander IS wearing a costume?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Golden Hind：</span><br>
Exactly. And we'll have to get real close to get a good look at it~<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Mary Celeste：</span><br>
Don't mind if I do.<br>
<br>
With all the surprise of the Grim Reaper, Mary Celeste appears and puts her prop scythe behind my neck.<br>
She then pulls it toward her, dragging me closer.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Golden Hind：</span><br>
Oh my! Mary made the first move... Well, now it's MY turn to get closer~<br>
Oh yes, I'm going to wrap you up like a gift and make you squishy with love~<br>
<br>
I had a dance with all the members of Tempesta, save for Whydah who stuck to a corner of the club and played video games.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
(Phew... All that dancing was exhausting. I need a break.)<br>
<br>
But before I can even find a place to sit down, something else happens.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Natori：</span><br>
Hoho! This is where we demonstrate our powers! Old man, let them behold! "This spectacle will leave them speechless!"<br>
<br>
A small whirlwind whips up around Natori, lifting her feet off the ground.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Épée：</span><br>
The wine glasses, they're floating away! Oh no... One fell and shattered... I messed up yet again...<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
(Oh boy... I need to stop Natori before this gets any worse.)<br>
<br>
I manage to bring Natori down to earth again. Edinburgh and Hermione then arrive to clean up the fragments on the floor and rebuild the wine glass tower.<br>
While they do that, I join Épée in her little hidey-hole and sit down next to her.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Épée：</span><br>
It's all my fault, Commander... I can't do anything right and I only ruin things for people... *sob*...<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
It's not your fault at all. You did all you could to save the glasses. Only one broke, and many more would have if not for you.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Épée：</span><br>
Y-you mean it? It's not my fault? You really think I did all I could?<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Absolutely. You're a good girl who's always trying her best.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Épée：</span><br>
Th-thank you... I'll keep trying my best so I can always be with you!<br>
<br>
I comfort the sobbing Épée, putting a wrap on everything that commotion caused.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
(I feel rested now. Time to get up and check out other people's costumes.)<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Jade：</span><br>
Heehee. Not wearing a costume to a costume party is naughty, you know, Commander.<br>
<br>
As I'm ogling the desserts at the table, Jade dressed in a witch's outfit approaches from behind and pokes me in the back.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Jade：</span><br>
But, if you'll dance with a good girl – i.e., me – then I might just turn a blind eye.<br>
<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项1：Alright. Let's dance.</span>'''''<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项2：Technically, this is a costume. I'm dressed as a naval commander.</span>'''''<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Jade：</span><br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项1）</span>'''''That's what I wanted to hear. Heehee.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Jade：</span><br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项2）</span>'''''Come on, who do you think you're fooling with that? You'll never be like me if you always make excuses.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Shimakaze：</span><br>
Hippity hoppity! There you are, Commander! Please dance with me!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Jade：</span><br>
Ugh. Looks like Shimakaze brought a whole crowd of eager dancers...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Elbing：</span><br>
Pl-please dance with me, too... Er, or don't. You probably already have way better dance partners in mind...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Devonshire：</span><br>
Roleplay mode engaged. "Urgh. Step aside, you mopey babies. I saw the Commander first."<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Yorck：</span><br>
My, my. Doesn't look like I can just stand by and await orders. Be quick, Commander – decide how this is going to go♥<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Taihou：</span><br>
I know you'll want to dance with me more than anyone else. Right, my Commander?<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
......<br>
<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项1：Form a queue, ladies. I'll dance with you all.</span>'''''<br>
<br>
As I conclude my final dance, the masquerade ball, too, reaches its end.<br>
The gentle melody gradually fades into silence, and the spotlights go out one after the next until it's all dark.<br>
I leave the nightclub and watch as the girls retire to their cabins.<br>
All the beautiful things that transpired tonight will linger in my mind for a long time.<br>

{{折叠面板|标题=The Maid Competition|选项=22|主框=1|样式=primary|展开=是}}
<br>
Emden leads me to the maid café, where a scheduled event is taking place.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Clemenceau：</span><br>
Welcome, Commander. This is where the maid competition is being hosted.<br>
<br>
Following Clemenceau's introduction, I look around the café.<br>
There is Shimanto, Felix Schultz, Boise, Marco Polo, and several others from each and every faction.<br>
<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项1：You're sure this is a proper maid café?</span>'''''<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项2：It doesn't look like any of them are proper maids.</span>'''''<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Clemenceau：</span><br>
Yes. This is a competition to see who makes the best maid. Letting actual maids participate is unfair and defeats the point.<br>
Some, like Marco Polo, are even confident that they could out-maid a real maid.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Marco Polo：</span><br>
Precisely! I will show them what a Sardegnian maid can truly do.<br>
But before that, I should give my thanks to Clemenceau for telling me about this competition.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Huh?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Clemenceau：</span><br>
Heehee. Never you mind that. Allow me to explain the rules.<br>
They're quite simple. The first maid who can make you go "ahh" is the winner.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
What do you mean, "ahh"? That's awfully vague for a victory condition.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">{namecode:448}：</span><br>
Have you heard of the Sakuran idea of "moe moe kyun magic," my dear human? "It's famous for making omelet rice taste divine."<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
So... the goal is really to make the best omelet rice, then?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Clemenceau：</span><br>
Not entirely. It's about who wields the moe moe kyun magic with the greatest proficiency.<br>
Thus, whoever's omelet rice makes you go "ahh" will be crowned the winner.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">{namecode:448}：</span><br>
Emden will sit by the sidelines and observe. "Your fallible human reactions prove quite amusing."<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Clemenceau：</span><br>
Now then, ladies! Let the competition begin!<br>
<br>
Clemenceau flashes a knowing smirk as she declares the competition's start, then retreats to the side.<br>
The contestants roll up their sleeves and get to work.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Felix Schultz：</span><br>
O moe moe kyun magic, by your power, make this omelet rice delicious! Yeees, now just a sprinkle of this stuff...<br>
Here you are, Commander. Savor this omelet rice topped with a little love potion. Say "ahh"!<br>
...H-hey! What's the security doing here? Let go of meeee!<br>
<br>
Felix Schultz has been disqualified for spiking the food!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Shimanto：</span><br>
Moe moe kyun, bless this food of mine! Huff... As a bonus, I'll warm it with my Dragon God's breath.<br>
Oops... I blew too hard and overcooked the eggs...<br>
That looks more like egg fried rice now... I should've known my technique wasn't sufficiently polished.<br>
<br>
Shimanto has been disqualified for overcooking her eggs!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Boise：</span><br>
Huff... Puff... All that's left is to add the ketchup and recite the incantation.<br>
Ah! I'm sorry, Commander! I didn't mean to spray the ketchup on you! Hang on, I'll wipe it off...<br>
<br>
Boise has been disqualified for obvious reasons!<br>
Up next was Bismarck, who simply could not bring herself to say the words, "moe moe kyun magic."<br>
Up next was Kashino, who somehow tripped and dropped her food. And so on, and so forth, until a promising challenger stepped forth.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Marco Polo：</span><br>
Hah! The time has come to show you all how it's REALLY done!<br>
Moe moe kyun magic, imprint your deliciousness upon this dish!<br>
<br>
Marco Polo's gestures flow like water and her exaggerated tone and phrasing hit a sweet spot. She must have practiced hard to get this good.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Marco Polo：</span><br>
Heheh. So impressed, you're at a loss for words, are you? I say it's safe to declare me the winner already.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
......<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Emden：</span><br>
...... "......"<br>
<br>
She forms a heart with her hands... while a smug grin covers her face. I doubt anyone is more pleased with her performance than herself.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Marco Polo：</span><br>
Wh-what's with that look? I'm OBVIOUSLY the winner! I mean, I am, right?<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
(I still don't know what Clemenceau meant by "making me go 'ahh.'")<br>
(I assume I don't literally have to say that. I'll just earnestly acknowledge how impressed I am with Marco.)<br>
I'd say so. You win.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Clemenceau：</span><br>
Really? Well, if you're sure. We have a clear winner – it's Marco Polo.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Emden：</span><br>
I'm surprised you're giving her the win so graciously, dear human.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Shimanto：</span><br>
Do like Marco to win. Need to write that down...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Felix Schultz：</span><br>
So you need only put on an exaggerated performance to distract the Commander, and in the meantime... Heehee.<br>
<br>
Following the victor's crowning, I ate up all the omelet rice the other participants made... except for Felix Schultz's.<br>
After that, I say goodbye to the girls and leave the maid café.<br>
That was a lot of food... I should go on a walk to get some exercise in.<br>

{{折叠面板|标题=Game Night|选项=23|主框=1|样式=primary|展开=是}}
<br>
The arcade is booming with video game sounds coming from home consoles, to portables, to arcade cabinets.<br>
This can mean only one thing – it's game night.<br>
Of course, video games aren't the only thing the arcade has. There is analog games and entertainment, too.<br>
Table tennis, pool, card games, you name it. It's all here, and it's easy to find someone who'll play with you tonight.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Fleuret：</span><br>
Oh, you're here, Commander! If you're looking for the gamers, they're sparring with each other to warm up. Why don't you play a card game with me meanwhile?<br>
I won't cheat with any Sacraments. Pinky promise.<br>
<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项1：(Take her up on her offer.)</span>'''''<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项1）</span>'''''Sure!<br>
<br>
Fleuret wins faster than my mind can properly process.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Fleuret：</span><br>
Wooow, I didn't think you'd lose THAT fast. Wanna try again?<br>
<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项1：(Cut your losses.)</span>'''''<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项2：(Take her on another time.)</span>'''''<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项1）</span>'''''Thanks, but no. I'm not cut out for these games.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项2）</span>'''''Another time. I need to get in the right mindset first.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Fleuret：</span><br>
Alrighty then. I'll be right here if you wanna play again!<br>
<br>
I turn my back on Fleuret and walk over to the arcade cabinet section.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Long Island：</span><br>
Commaaander! I saw that. You got completely whooped by Fleuret!<br>
How about you enter our tournament? It's a chance to repair your tarnished pride.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Pamiat' Merkuria：</span><br>
Ahahaha! You barely got started before you lost! Sorry to say, but you don't stand a shadow of a chance of beating us.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ayanami：</span><br>
Yes. I will win at any cost.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Before I decide anything, can you at least tell me what genre of game you're playing?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Haguro：</span><br>
*yaaawn*... A fighting game, obviously? That's, like, the go-to tournament genre.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ryuujou：</span><br>
If Milord will enter, I shall pull out all the stops!<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
All the cabinets here are one-on-one games. How about we play each other in teams?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ryuujou：</span><br>
I approve! I propose you, I, and Pamiat' Merkuria make up one team.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Haguro：</span><br>
So... *yaaawn*... that means me, Long Island, and Ayanami are on the other team. What prize does the winner get?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Long Island：</span><br>
Hmm... How abooout... the winning team gets to be the first to play Shadow of the Silvertree? I know we're all hyped about it.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Pamiat' Merkuria：</span><br>
Heh, sounds good to me. Let's run with that.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Long Island：</span><br>
Also, I want to put a personal wager between you and me on this match, Commander.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Let me guess – it's work-related, right?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Long Island：</span><br>
Bingo! If I win, will you give me the next few days off?<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
What's in it for me if I win?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Long Island：</span><br>
Ugh... If you win, I'll actually go to work in person and NOT slack on the job.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Sounds good. Bring it on.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Long Island：</span><br>
Then we have a deal! Don't expect me to hold anything back!<br>
<br>
Thus, our fierce tournament with much on the line began. Both teams nominate one player each per match.<br>
Shortly after the first round, I managed to knock out Haguro, one of their best players.<br>
However, Long Island and Ayanami made a swift comeback, defeating both Pamiat' and Ryuujou.<br>
Just like that, our one-point lead became a one-point disadvantage.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
(I can't let Long Island win. That's what matters.)<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Long Island：</span><br>
Round 4, let's go! I've got a hadouken with your name on it, Commander!<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
(Boy, she's A LOT better at fighting games than I thought... I need an opener to punish her.)<br>
<br>
She combos my character to the edge of the screen, and she lowers her guard, thinking her victory is guaranteed.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
1 HP is all you need!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Long Island：</span><br>
Nooo! I was THIS close! THIS close!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ayanami：</span><br>
It's okay. I will avenge you.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
You've got to be kidding me...<br>
<br>
I mashed my heart out against Long Island and my fingers cramped up. To the surprise of nobody, Ayanami beat me.<br>
That's okay, though. While Ayanami beat me, I at least beat Long Island.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Long Island：</span><br>
Maaan... You beat me fair and square, so I'll do some real work for once...<br>
<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项1：I WILL make sure you're true to your word.</span>'''''<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Long Island：</span><br>
Waaahhh! This ghost got totally busted! Goodbye, video games – goodbye, slack time...<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
(I'm starting to feel bad for the poor girl... You know what? I won't be so strict.)<br>
Fine. No days off, but you can keep "working" like you have until now.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Long Island：</span><br>
You mean... hardly working at all? Yippee! I love you, Commander!<br>
Let's celebrate with some more gaming!<br>
<br>
With the conclusion of our tournament, calm returns to the once rowdy corner of the arcade.<br>
The gamer girls aren't ready to retire yet, so they decide to stay there.<br>
I, on the other hand, walk out of the arcade to the backdrop of Kursk teaching her pool technique to Belorussiya and Hunter.<br>
Before I can fully exit, however, Fleuret walks up and asks me to walk her to her cabin.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
(Once I've done that, I'll visit some other part of the ship.)<br>

{{折叠面板|标题=Barbecue Party|选项=24|主框=1|样式=primary|展开=是}}
<br>
The sky above the ocean is a deep ink black.<br>
It's strange, because looking at the clock, it's still daytime. And yet, night hangs overhead.<br>
Amid the darkness, though, lights with striking colors dance across the sky.<br>
There is no better place on board to watch the aurora than the garden. As soon as I set foot there, I can't help but stop and marvel at its magnificence.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
(Cooking barbecue under such a beautiful sight is not on my bucket list, but now I feel like it should be.)<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Vestal：</span><br>
Pardon me, Commander! Please step aside! I need to get these fresh ingredients to Chef Lung Wu!<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Oops, sorry. The aurora distracted me.<br>
<br>
Vestal comes carrying a stainless steel soup pot, only it's not filled with soup, but an assortment of vegetables.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Let me help you with that. Also, is there any reason you've started calling her "Chef"?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Vestal：</span><br>
Ah, that's just an inside joke. See, a bunch of us have made teams specifically for making barbecue.<br>
Ours includes me, Roon, Lung Wu, and Hu Pen. I do the vegetables, and Roon prepares the meat.<br>
Lung Wu is our cook, of course, and Hu Pen is her assistant. Since Lung Wu is so gifted, we naturally started calling her "Chef."<br>
<br>
As she explains all that, she leads me to where Roon does her part.<br>
Using a shiny knife, she slices and dices the slab of meat on her cutting board into fitting sizes.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Roon：</span><br>
I'd love to stay here and let loose with you, but I'm afraid that'll have to wait until after the barbecue, Commander.<br>
Chopping meat is, to me, a kind of stress relief. Heehee.<br>
I'll come see you a while later. Don't worry about letting me into your cabin – I already found a way to bypass the security♪<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
(Wait... that security breach was HER?)<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">TB ：</span><br>
Breaching attempt into your cabin's security system has been detected. Anomaly detected in ship's engine room.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
(That makes so much sense. So it's her fault the ship nearly collided with an iceberg.)<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Roon：</span><br>
Oh, would you mind taking the meat I'm done chopping to Chef Lung Wu?<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Uh... Sure.<br>
<br>
I collect Roon's diced meat, follow Vestal to where Lung Wu is, and drop it off. Then I decide to wander around a bit.<br>
As Vestal alluded to earlier, there are quite a few teams here, all neatly preparing and grilling their ingredients.<br>
Well, not all. Some are better cooks than others...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Liverpool：</span><br>
Ehhh... Can't we grill the eel more, you know, normally?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Mullany：</span><br>
I think it'll be more interesting if we put a slice of cheese and some chocolate sauce on top!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Chi An：</span><br>
I'm not sure either way... Brennus, what do you think?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Brennus：</span><br>
If you want my opinion...<br>
<br>
Hearing her name called, Brennus stops doing her hair and ponders the question deeply for a moment before answering.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Brennus：</span><br>
However great the present may be, one must not neglect the pursuit of new knowledge.<br>
The mind is particularly prone to laziness when food and drink overindulged in.<br>
For this reason, I believe we should cover the eel with neither chocolate sauce nor cheese.<br>
Rather, we should soak it in an energy drink!<br>
This energy drink will not only make it delectable, it will also preserve our concentration.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Liverpool：</span><br>
Are you having a laugh? That will just make it minging!<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
(...I should be on my way. If they make me taste that eel, my tastebuds will never recover.)<br>
<br>
After much ecstatic preparation, the barbecue party officially begins at last.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">New Jersey：</span><br>
Here, honey! Say "ahh"!<br>
<br>
New Jersey holds up a fork with a slice of steak. I take a bite.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Mmm. Delicious!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">New Jersey：</span><br>
Heehee, of course it is! Delicious is the only kind of steak the indomitable Black Dragon can make!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">{namecode:224}：</span><br>
Hahah! You're a damn good chef – even better than I expected! I'm no glutton, and even I can't put down my chopsticks.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Unzen：</span><br>
Hmm... It appears to me that pouring your love into your food elevates it to a whole new level.<br>
That does explain why the Commander is so delighted by it. It also makes me wonder what I could grill to do the same...<br>
<br>
Meanwhile, Emanuele Pessagno and Perseus are sitting just behind us. Emanuele peers through her telescope, looking up at the aurora.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Perseus：</span><br>
You know, to the naked eye, it looks like a balloon filled with light just burst.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Emanuele Pessagno：</span><br>
Talk about a contrived analogy...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Perseus：</span><br>
What about you, Commander? What do you see?<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Ahem... Scientifically speaking, an aurora is the product of solar winds causing interference in the Earth's magnetosphere. It takes a few days for the winds to travel all that way.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">New Jersey：</span><br>
Ooh! I like to think of it as the winds making that several-day-long journey just for us to enjoy this beautiful sight♪<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">{namecode:224}：</span><br>
Don't reckon the solar wind has much say in it, but that's a romantic take!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Unzen：</span><br>
Heehee. I think we all feel mesmerized, seeing this sky right beside the Commander.<br>
<br>
We chat the hours away until slowly but surely, the barbecue party wraps up.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
(It's time to pack up. Before we start heading home, I should check if there's anything left to do.)<br>
{{折叠面板|内容结束}}

{{折叠面板|标题=The Sun, the Wind, the Gym|选项=25|主框=1|样式=primary|展开=是}}
<br>
I decide to pay a visit to the ship's gym.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
(Huh, so it's divided into two sections. It makes sense that they'd include space for track events.)<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Prinz Eugen：</span><br>
Oh, Commander. Fancy seeing you here.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
I'm just passing by. Don't mind me.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Prinz Eugen：</span><br>
Too late for that. Hey, are you busy right now?<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Not really. Why?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Prinz Eugen：</span><br>
Heehee. Well, since you're here, let's do something fun.<br>
Just wait here and I'll be right back.<br>
<br>
Eugen turns on her heel and goes to the indoor part of the gym. Marseillaise is there, and Eugen whispers something to her.<br>
Marseillaise then gets up and starts talking to everyone else inside the gym.<br>
A short while later, a small crowd has gathered – Eugen, Marseillaise, Z46, Brünhilde, Kersaint, and Suffren.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Marseillaise：</span><br>
...I am the Fighting Angel. Defeat is not an option for me.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Brünhilde：</span><br>
I answer your call, Commander, and I'll bring you victory.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Sorry, what?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Prinz Eugen：</span><br>
Did you forget what I said? We're going to do something fun.<br>
The girls and I talked, and we settled on a three-versus-three game of beach volleyball. I wanted you to join us... but you can't have everything.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Marseillaise：</span><br>
If you were playing, the team you're not on might be hesitant to go all out.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
So, what am I supposed to do? Spectate?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Marseillaise：</span><br>
Not quite. We'd like you to keep score for us.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Suffren：</span><br>
Yeah. You don't have a horse in this race, so you'll tally points fair and square! That's why I'm gonna give it 100%!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Z46：</span><br>
For fun we play, for prize we fight. Like leopards we'll move, seize victory proud and bright.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Kersaint：</span><br>
If I j-just pray for victory, maybe, just maybe...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Prinz Eugen：</span><br>
Hear that? They're all fired up. We're just waiting for your answer, Commander.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
(There's no way this is a casual match, considering the motivation on display here...)<br>
Let me guess... you promised something to the winners, didn't you?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Prinz Eugen：</span><br>
Dang, the jig is up. I only promised the winning team would get to have dinner with you, that's all.<br>
You're not going to turn them down now that we're all here, are you?<br>
<br>
Eugen's expression screams, "I have you exactly where I want you." Admittedly, she does look brilliant in the sunlight.<br>
With a nod, the curtains rise on a fervent game of beach volleyball.<br>
Marseillaise leaps up into the air, hitting the ball with all her might.<br>
With a whoosh, it flies straight toward the floor, but Z46 intercepts the ball just before it lands.<br>
Brünhilde makes a brilliant feint, followed by Eugen jumping up high, smacking the ball with full force.<br>
It's on course toward Kersaint, who panics and trips, thus giving a point to Iron Blood's team.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Brünhilde：</span><br>
That's one point to us! Keep at it and we'll win!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Z46：</span><br>
The ball shall fly like a star through the sky.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Kersaint：</span><br>
I'm sorry... It's all my fault...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Suffren：</span><br>
Don't be like that! The game has only just begun!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Marseillaise：</span><br>
The Commander is watching. We must give this our all!<br>
<br>
The motivation flowing through the players burns even brighter.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
(This is getting intense. I really wonder who'll win in the end.)<br>
<br>
Marseillaise and Suffren fought tooth and nail and finally ended the match with a draw. That means I'll have dinner with both teams.<br>
There's still a while to go until then. I'll take the time to check out something else meanwhile.<br>

{{折叠面板|标题=Aquarium Over the Sea|选项=26|主框=1|样式=primary|展开=是}}
<br>
I decide to have a tour of the onboard aquarium.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
(It's funny when you think about it. There's a sea not just outside the ship, but inside it, too. Sort of.)<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Flasher：</span><br>
C-Commander? Did you come to look at the fish?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">San Jacinto：</span><br>
Well, hello! Good morning, Commander.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Aylwin：</span><br>
Oh! Would you like to go in the aquarium with us?<br>
<br>
I was only planning to have a casual look around. Now I've run into an unexpected trio.<br>
I accept their offer and follow them, leisurely walking through the aquarium.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">San Jacinto：</span><br>
Do you know why they put an aquarium of all things aboard the ship?<br>
Hint: it's not just because Flasher suggested it!<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
I mean, what more is there to it?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Aylwin：</span><br>
Is it that we don't get to see fish often? I've heard not even the submarines see them much.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Flasher：</span><br>
Umm... Is it because we all agree that fishies are cute?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">San Jacinto：</span><br>
Bzzzt. Wrong-o.<br>
It's because aquariums are popular dating spots! They're nice and quiet, and the lighting is all romantic.<br>
When you go vacationing, you need at least ONE place to go on a date.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Flasher：</span><br>
That's why? Then it's no wonder they okayed my idea right away.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Aylwin：</span><br>
That can't be the only reason. You're just teasing us, aren't you, Jacinto?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">San Jacinto：</span><br>
Dang. Foiled again, and so quickly!<br>
<br>
While the girls chat away, I gaze up at a big fish tank.<br>
The fish are swimming around a coral reef... with the occasional shark or whale passing by.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
(It IS a pretty sight, but what's going to happen with these fish when we get back to the port?)<br>
(You can't just set them free in the ocean. One option is to transfer them to our on-land aquarium.)<br>
Hmm...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">San Jacinto：</span><br>
Something on your mind, Commander? Are you thinking about what to do with the fish when we're back home?<br>
Then I have good news. Flasher has already thought about that!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Flasher：</span><br>
I-I have! I'll take them in and look after them. I don't want anything to happen to the fishies!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Aylwin：</span><br>
If you'll look after them, I'd like to help.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Flasher：</span><br>
Y-you will? *sniffle*... Sorry, I can't... I'm just so, so happy...<br>
<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项1：(Wipe away Flasher's tears.)</span>'''''<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项2：(Give Flasher a pat on the back.)</span>'''''<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Flasher：</span><br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项1）</span>'''''*sniffle*... Thanks... Thank you, Commander!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Flasher：</span><br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项2）</span>'''''Heehee... I appreciate it, Commander... *sniffle*...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">San Jacinto：</span><br>
You really are a nice person, Commander.<br>
I was joking about the aquarium as a date spot thing, but you know...<br>
<br>
San Jacinto grabs my hand.<br>
She runs her slim fingers around in my palm, then locks them between mine.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">San Jacinto：</span><br>
The mood here IS perfect for a date. Let's go on one, Commander.<br>
<br>
I casually toured the aquarium with the three girls.<br>
When I return outside, the sun has started to set. It's too early for bedtime, though, so I should check out someplace else.<br>

{{折叠面板|标题=Lectured at the Lecture|选项=27|主框=1|样式=primary|展开=是}}
<br>
I'm walking near the ship's classroom, and I can hear a familiar voice pleading for mercy.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Fu Shun：</span><br>
Pleeease, An Shan! I've memorized it all, I promise! Let me leeeave...<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
(Fu Shun and An Shan? I should go in and have a look.)<br>
<br>
In the classroom I find not just the two aforementioned, but also Hai Tien, Fei Yuen, and Anchorage.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">An Shan：</span><br>
Oh, great timing, Commander! Have you come to observe the lecture?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Anchorage：</span><br>
Teacher is gonna study with Anchorage! Hooray! Heehee...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Fei Yuen：</span><br>
Commander, look, look! Miss Hai Tien and Miss An Shan are teaching me and Anchorage how to paint!<br>
<br>
Fei Yuen jogs up to me, holding a picture of what looks like one big haphazard scribble.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Hai Tien：</span><br>
Yuen, drawing is like writing – you need a steady hand and a steady mind.<br>
I understand being excited to show your work to the Commander, but... well...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Fei Yuen：</span><br>
Aww... I just wanted the Commander to see my art...<br>
<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项1：(Hold your tongue.)</span>'''''<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项2：(Praise her.)</span>'''''<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项1）</span>'''''......<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Hai Tien：</span><br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项1）</span>'''''Let's not bother the Commander more, okay? You just need to practice and improve.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项2）</span>'''''Your drawing is very, uhh... Keep practicing and it'll no doubt spark a new art movement!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Fei Yuen：</span><br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项2）</span>'''''You mean it?!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Hai Tien：</span><br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项2）</span>'''''Don't get too excited, Yuen. You have much learning to do.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Fei Yuen：</span><br>
I know, I know.<br>
<br>
In contrast to Yuen's eagerness for praise, Anchorage is solemnly taking in the tips An Shan has for her.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Anchorage：</span><br>
How do you draw... this part? I'm confuzzled...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">An Shan：</span><br>
Like this. Watch closely.<br>
<br>
Fu Shun, meanwhile, has been quiet as a mouse. From a blind spot in An Shan's line of sight, she winks at me as hard as she can.<br>
When she sees me look her way, she holds up her notebook in the air for me to read.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
"I want to go adventuring! Get me out of here, Commander!"<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">An Shan：</span><br>
Fuuu Shuuun!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Fu Shun：</span><br>
WHY'D YOU READ IT OUT LOUD?! Nooo, don't make me stand in the corner!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Fei Yuen：</span><br>
You're going on an adventure? Then Lady Yuen is coming, too!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Anchorage：</span><br>
Teacher! Take Anchorage on an ad-ven-chur!<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Now, now, you've still got classes. Your adventure will have to wait until schooltime is over.<br>
An Shan and Hai Tien are working really hard to teach you. Don't let their efforts be in vain.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Fei Yuen：</span><br>
Hrmh... You're right. Fine, Lady Yuen will stay put!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Anchorage：</span><br>
Anchorage will listen to you, Teacher! When class is over, it's ad-ven-chur time!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">An Shan：</span><br>
Thanks for calming them down, Commander. Fu Shun, come here!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Fu Shun：</span><br>
I-it's over... I'm sorry for nearly instigating a rebellion...<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
(I didn't like doing this to her, but education is important. She'll just have to hang in there.)<br>
(I'll probably distract from their lessons if I stick around any longer. I'd better get going.)<br>
<br>
I leave the classroom the same way as I entered it – to the sound of Fu Shun's chagrin.<br>

{{折叠面板|标题=Cabin Satisfaction Interview|选项=28|主框=1|样式=primary|展开=是}}
<br>
On my walk, I happen upon the cabin area.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Guam：</span><br>
Hiii, everyone! This is the beautiful and talented Eagle Union CB-2, Guam, coming at you live!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Charybdis：</span><br>
And I'm Charybdis of the Royal Navy. I'm honoured to be here as a guest interviewer.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
(Is that Guam I hear? Charybdis, too? What are they doing together?)<br>
<br>
While I'm pondering various reasons, I suddenly realize that their voices are just around the corner.<br>
Before I can respond, a large black object suddenly appears in my field of vision – a microphone, held by Guam.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Guam：</span><br>
Look at that! We've got a surprise guest! It's none other than the Commander!<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
What are you two up to? Interviewing people on their holiday?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Guam：</span><br>
Ooh, you almost got it right on the first try! I think we'll let our guest interviewer handle this question.<br>
Pow, pow! Over to you, Charybdis!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Charybdis：</span><br>
Good evening, Master. To answer your question, Guam is doing a survey to measure passenger satisfaction.<br>
Originally, a different Royal Maid was going to be the guest interviewer, but she had to cancel due to urgent business and the task fell on me.<br>
Speaking of the Royal Maids, we're actually responsible for all the service onboard the ship. Our motto is, "Any task – anywhere."<br>
I hope that answers your question. By the way, Master, what brings you to the cabin area?<br>
I believe your personal cabin is on another deck entirely.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
I was just walking around, then I heard you two and I came to check.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Guam：</span><br>
Whoa, so it's just like I said! You really ARE a surprise guest!<br>
You're also a golden goose for news and I need an egg! You'll be our first interviewee!<br>
Admit it, you're curious to hear what questions we've got!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Charybdis：</span><br>
Well, Master? Would you please answer a few questions?<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Sure. If it helps.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Charybdis：</span><br>
Whew... Okay, let's begin.<br>
Have you slept well the past two days? Was your bed neither too soft nor too hard? Are you satisfied with your selection of pillows?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Guam：</span><br>
Wow, listen to you go! Alright, my camera's prepped and ready to capture the Commander's answers!<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Well, uh, I've been sleeping well and my bed was perfect. I've only tried one type of pillow so far, but it fits my neck well and feels nice.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Charybdis：</span><br>
Thank you. Your praise honours all of us. Next question – how was your experience with your room cleaning?<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Even if I leave my bed a total mess, it looks as good as new when I come back.<br>
In a word, every day feels as fresh as the first.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Charybdis：</span><br>
Heehee. Your cabin matters the most to us, so we strive to meet the highest possible standards for it.<br>
Now, let's put the questions on hold and instead demonstrate the Royal Maids' capabilities both to you and the viewers.<br>
Master, Miss Guam, would you please come with me into the next cabin? I'd like to show you our SOP.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
"SOP"? You make it sound so technical. Although, you do need procedures when cleaning so many cabins.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Charybdis：</span><br>
Indeed. Belfast calls it the SPOCC, short for, "standards and procedures of cabin cleaning."<br>
<br>
Charybdis escorts me and Guam to the door to a cabin.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Charybdis：</span><br>
This cabin is being cleaned right now. Miss Guam, I trust you to handle the camerawork.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Guam：</span><br>
No problemo. Recordiiing... now! Action!<br>
<br>
As Charybdis opens the door, a loud gunshot rings out.<br>
The firearm has a silencer equipped, but it does little to stifle the noise at such close range.<br>
You have nowhere left to run.<br>
Inside the cabin, Sheffield has her gun trained on a small creature crawling along the floor at high speed.<br>
This isn't quite what I expected, but that won't be a problem. Hi-yah!<br>
Gloucester swings gallantly, smashing a striking stain on the floor with her clenched fist.<br>
Oh dear! Wrong room.<br>
Charybdis maintains a professional smile as she swiftly closes the door.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
(Well, uh... What should I even say here?)<br>
Chary–<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Charybdis：</span><br>
Miss Guam.<br>
<br>
Guam gulps.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Guam：</span><br>
Y-yes?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Charybdis：</span><br>
Do you think you could send this part to the cutting room floor?<br>
And, Master, if you'd be so kind, please try to obliterate all memory of this.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Uh... Consider it done.<br>
<br>
Charybdis switches off the camera immediately and makes absolutely sure the recording has been wiped. Only then does she let me and Guam go.<br>
I have plans to visit the water park soon, so I should go there now.<br>

{{折叠面板|标题=Visitor to the Garden|选项=29|主框=1|样式=primary|展开=是}}
<br>
I helped Akashi sort out the cargo unloading warehouse and now I've come to the garden for a break.<br>
Most of the guests on the ship have already left for Seabreeze Island, making it feel a little empty onboard.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Constellation：</span><br>
Commander? You're still here?<br>
<br>
Constellation sounds just a bit surprised.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Not yet. I just helped Akashi in the warehouse and I wanted to take a break before I get off. How about you?<br>
<br>
Suddenly, I notice that she's holding a variety of mechanical parts.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Constellation：</span><br>
As you can see, I'm setting up some astronomy equipment.<br>
I'm going to get on land after I'm finished... Oh, uh, if you have the time, could you help me out?<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Sure thing. This will save you time setting things up when night rolls around, I assume?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Constellation：</span><br>
Yeah. Preparing my equipment in advance will let me see the beautiful stars that much sooner.<br>
The lat and long here are perfect for stargazing. The weather's also been great lately, with barely any cloud coverage.<br>
All in all, this will get me a spectacular view of the stars.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Wow, that's stellar. Anyway, let me help.<br>
<br>
A while later, we're done setting up all her astronomical equipment.<br>
You can't adjust the lens during daytime, so I put a protective covering on it.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Constellation：</span><br>
You remember the little things, huh? Heehee.<br>
I appreciate all your help. I would give you something as thanks, but, well...<br>
<br>
She broods for a moment, then takes a sudden step forward.<br>
Coming closer, she exudes a subtle fragrance and gives my cheek a warm and soft touch.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Constellation：</span><br>
I wasn't expecting to run into you here, so I don't have anything on hand. Sorry.<br>
<br>
She lowers her voice to a whisper, feeling either anxious or embarrassed.<br>
A faint tremble runs through her words as she says...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Constellation：</span><br>
If you're free later tonight, you should stop by.<br>
I hope we can gaze at the stars together.<br>
<br>
I stay in the garden, resting for a while longer, then see Constellation off as she disembarks.<br>
It's time I do the same to check what people are up to on Seabreeze Island.<br>

<br>
I've come to the ship's cargo unloading station. For some reason, there's a huge fish tank sitting here.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
(You could fit a whale in there. Odd that it's empty.)<br>
<br>
As I start to wonder how it got here, I suddenly hear Huan Ch'ang speaking.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Huan Ch'ang：</span><br>
Th-this can't be right! Or my divination would be wrong...<br>
Harbin got me such a large tank, and yet...<br>
<br>
Her eyes are on the floor as she walks toward me, muttering something under her breath.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Huan Ch'ang：</span><br>
C-Commander?!<br>
<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项1：(Offer her your condolences.)</span>'''''<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项2：(Give her your sympathy.)</span>'''''<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Huan Ch'ang：</span><br>
No, I can't accept this...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Albacore：</span><br>
What's up, Huan? Why can't you catch any fish?<br>
<br>
Albacore happens to pass by and overhear our conversation. She waltzes over to us with marked interest.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Huan Ch'ang：</span><br>
*sigh*...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Albacore：</span><br>
Don't fret! I'll give you a hand! Start up the fish catchamatron!<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
The what now?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Albacore：</span><br>
You don't know? This has been on the ship the whole time! You just put a submarine in there and send 'er down to catch some fish.<br>
<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项1：Why a submarine?</span>'''''<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项2：Who came up with this?</span>'''''<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项3：When did they add that?</span>'''''<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Albacore：</span><br>
Tsk, tsk, always so concerned with the details. It doesn't matter!<br>
<br>
Gears and chains start to rattle, then Albacore boards the "fish catchamatron."<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Albacore：</span><br>
Oh, I forgot to mention – someone needs to steer it from up here. Otherwise you can't determine the angle to plunge it into the sea.<br>
That someone will be you, Commander!<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Alright then.<br>
<br>
Doing as she asks, I get in front of the control panel and operate the chain swing.<br>
All I need to do is decide on the angle and the device will send Albacore down into the sea.<br>
After fiddling with the controls a few times, we get a bite.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Albacore：</span><br>
I got one! Now pull me back up!<br>
<br>
The winch fires up and reels in the chain. The catch comes into view, and it's revealed that Albacore caught... a blobfish.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
(I'll be damned. She caught a blobfish at–)<br>
(Hang on! Blobfish don't even swim up to these depths!)<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Huan Ch'ang：</span><br>
......<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ayanami：</span><br>
I was passing by and noticed how Huan Ch'ang looked upset that there are no fish to put in the tank.<br>
I can help with that. Yes, as long as any kind of fish will do.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Huan Ch'ang：</span><br>
That's very kind of you, but you see...<br>
<br>
Before Huan Ch'ang can even finish, Ayanami takes a few steps forward and blows a whistle.<br>
Moments later, a seagull flies over from the garden and squawks a couple of times. It and Ayanami must have some sort of deal.<br>
<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项1：What's the deal with that bird?</span>'''''<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项2：That's old Squawkey, isn't it?</span>'''''<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ayanami：</span><br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项1）</span>'''''He's a friend I made long ago on Seabreeze Island. He came to meet us as soon as we anchored.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ayanami：</span><br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项2）</span>'''''Yes! I'm surprised you remembered his name. He came flying to meet us as soon as we made landfall.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
(Ahh. So that's why I didn't see Ayanami or any birds when I went to check on the roosting spot on the island. They'd already gone back to the ship.)<br>
<br>
Right then, some things fall from the sky and land on the deck with a flop.<br>
It's a couple of fish. Squawkey dove down from the skies and caught them underwater with his beak.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ayanami：</span><br>
Don't feel sad, Huan. Now you have lots of fish.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Huan Ch'ang：</span><br>
I can't believe this... I'm losing to a bird!<br>
<br>
Huan Ch'ang makes a sad expression and mumbles something.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Huan Ch'ang：</span><br>
No, actually... Thanks... I need to go and be alone for a bit...<br>
<br>
With a wave of her hand, she leaves the scene.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
(She looked pretty shocked about that.)<br>
<br>
Afterward, I, Ayanami, and Albacore put the fish inside the tank.<br>
I'll quickly clean up the place a bit then go have a look somewhere else.<br>

<br>
I followed a sweet smell hanging in the air and ended up at the door to the kitchen.<br>
It's closed shut, but I can still smell that sweet aroma through the gaps. This has to be where it's coming from.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
(Might as well have a look inside.)<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Dunkerque：</span><br>
So you see, you ought to pay close attention to the oven temperature. Even I struggled to bake a whole batch of macarons properly once upon a time.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Lung Wu：</span><br>
That's how you do it... Thank you for showing me! I'll try to make some myself later.<br>
<br>
Sounds like Dunkerque is teaching Lung Wu how to make macarons.<br>
As soon as they notice I'm here, they both turn their heads to face me at the same time.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Dunkerque：</span><br>
Ah, Commander. Are you feeling hungry?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Lung Wu：</span><br>
Hungry? Well, I just came up with a dessert that's Empery-Orthodoxy fusion cuisine! Would you like to try it?<br>
<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项1：It won't hurt to try...</span>'''''<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项2：Wait, you've fused Empery and Orthodoxy cuisine?</span>'''''<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Lung Wu：</span><br>
Exactly! While I usually adhere to more conventional recipes, I've been hearing a lot of different food takes aboard the ship.<br>
It made me want to challenge myself to fuse cuisines from different countries based on some of the suggestions I heard.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Dunkerque：</span><br>
Mhm. I think it's a fun idea.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Incidentally, is the dessert based on macarons? You were just talking about them, so...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Lung Wu：</span><br>
Not quite. It's... Well, you'll see soon when it's done baking!<br>
<br>
The oven rings with a ding, and Lung Wu takes out a green cake-looking thing from it.<br>
It smells similar to what led me here to begin with, but there's something... else mixed in there.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Dunkerque：</span><br>
The color is a bit odd... Then again, we have similar-looking desserts made with ground pistachio nuts.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Did you use matcha for this?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Lung Wu：</span><br>
Nope. I put in two kinds of spices often used to add aroma to our cuisine. I think that's what turned it green.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Dunkerque：</span><br>
It's an experiment, because we were trying new things.<br>
We weren't expecting you to come here, but now you'll be the first to taste it.<br>
<br>
Lung Wu looks at me expectantly. I cut a slice using a knife, then have a bite of the dessert.<br>
An explosion fills my mouth with flavors I'm not sure how to describe...<br>
The smell and bitterness overlap with each other, and there's a dash of sweetness among the spiciness. It's a shocking taste that sends you skyward.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Lung Wu：</span><br>
Well? How is it?<br>
<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项1：You're probably better suited for conventional recipes.</span>'''''<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项2：I-it's great... Others n-need to try this...</span>'''''<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Lung Wu：</span><br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项1）</span>'''''What? Oh... Are you saying adding coriander and chameleon plant was actually a bad idea?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Lung Wu：</span><br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项2）</span>'''''You mean it? Is it really so good it's making you cry and stutter?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Lung Wu：</span><br>
That doesn't seem right... Let me try it, too. I got so engrossed in making the batter earlier that I completely forgot to taste test it then.<br>
<br>
She acts quicker than I can stop her, cutting a slice and putting a spoonful in her mouth.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Lung Wu：</span><br>
......<br>
<br>
Immediately, without a moment's hesitation, she throws the rest of the cake in the garbage.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Lung Wu：</span><br>
On second thought... I'll stick to conventional recipes.<br>
<br>
To "soothe the trauma I suffered," Lung Wu cooked up a feast of tasty dishes for me.<br>
After having my fill and giving her my thanks, I leave the kitchen with a box of Dunkerque's macarons.<br>

{{折叠面板|标题=Diving for Treasure|选项=32|主框=1|样式=primary|展开=是}}
<br>
I approach the cargo unloading area and see a group of people gathered around Eldridge, holding a dowsing rod.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Javelin：</span><br>
It moved! So that means there's treasure under the water, right?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Eldridge：</span><br>
Mhm.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Z23：</span><br>
Pirates DID live here once, so I wouldn't be too shocked to find treasure here.<br>
If I can be a skeptic for a second, how can a dowsing rod even detect treasure in the first place?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Leonardo da Vinci：</span><br>
By being an intricately designed invention of yours truly!<br>
I like to call it the Handy Landy Treasure Findy! The only problem with it is that its range of targets is limited solely to treasure.<br>
But, as it so happens, that's exactly what we need right now!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Javelin：</span><br>
Hey, Commander! Do you want to go treasure-hunting with us? There's loot to be found in these waters!<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Are you sure that's not stepping on Tempesta's toes? We should talk to them first.<br>
<br>
I called up Tempesta and had a word. They gave us permission to search to our heart's content.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
That's all sorted. Now we have to decide who'll do the diving.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Eldridge：</span><br>
Eldridge can't... Emits sparks.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Z23：</span><br>
That's true. We don't want to electrocute a whole school of fish.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Javelin：</span><br>
If we need someone to go underwater, maybe we should ask Jean Bart.<br>
She's associated with pirates, so she'd know where a pirate would hide their treasure!<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Why not send da Vinci down? I mean, she's a submarine.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Leonardo da Vinci：</span><br>
No can do! I have to stay on land to verify how well my invention works.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Javelin：</span><br>
Jean it is, then! I'll go find her!<br>
<br>
Sometime later, Javelin returns with Jean Bart... who has changed into a swimsuit.<br>
I get the feeling there has been a misunderstanding.<br>
I pull her aside and explain the situation.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Jean Bart：</span><br>
...You what? I thought I'd be searchin' the shipwrecks nearby, and now ya want me to go DIVING?<br>
You've got a submarine right here! The hell do ya need me for?<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Well, we need someone to help me.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Jean Bart：</span><br>
Don't kid yourself. It's dangerous down there. Sit your ass down and I'll do it myself.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
I didn't mean it like that. There's a thing on the ship that can lower you into the water. Albacore used it the other day.<br>
With some modifications, I'm sure you could use it to hunt for treasure.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Leonardo da Vinci：</span><br>
Oh! That's a great idea! Let me cook something up and I'll be right back!<br>
<br>
Da Vinci finishes her ingenious modifications to the machine, and Jean Beart and I step inside.<br>
It was designed with submarines in mind, so it's still cramped even after the changes.<br>
This forces me and Jean to be practically shoulder to shoulder. At any rate, the chain drops us and into the water we go.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Eldridge：</span><br>
Target... sighted.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Javelin：</span><br>
You're right next to the treasure!<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Got it.<br>
Hey, Jean...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Jean Bart：</span><br>
Yeah?<br>
<br>
I was just going to nod at her to tell her to proceed, but she turns to face me instinctively after hearing her name.<br>
Since we're right up against each other, my lips accidentally brush up against her cheek.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Jean Bart：</span><br>
Wha–?!<br>
<br>
Her cheeks turn a shade of pink, if for just a moment.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Jean Bart：</span><br>
I-I'm going out!<br>
<br>
She puts on a da Vinci-brand diving oxygen mask and exits the machine after some fidgeting.<br>
I shortly follow suit. Amongst the sand on the ocean floor, I dig out an old pocket watch.<br>
A picture of a cat is engraved on the corroded lid. The watch itself, sadly, is made not of gold but ordinary metal.<br>
"Treasure" in hand, me and Jean return to the machine.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Jean Bart：</span><br>
What a piece of junk. This what ya call treasure?<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
In a sense. I want to give it to them as a gift, even if it's not worth much.<br>
To me, though, the real treasure was the time I spent with you.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Jean Bart：</span><br>
Ugh, you're so corny. You tryin' to flatter me? I don't like it.<br>
<br>
So she says, but the next thing she does is walk up and give me a kiss just to the side of my lips.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Jean Bart：</span><br>
There. That's my idea of real treasure. Don't forget it.<br>
<br>
I radio da Vinci and she hoists us back up to land.<br>
After taking off my diving suit, I present the old pocket watch to the aspiring treasure hunters. Jean Bart, meanwhile, turns and walks away.<br>
I leave the scene to the backdrop of da Vinci shouting, "This gives me an idea"!<br>
There is still time until the dress party starts. I'll go and get myself ready.<br>

{{折叠面板|标题=Watch for Icebergs|选项=33|主框=1|样式=primary|展开=是}}
<br>
I suddenly feel apprehensive of icebergs, so I head to the bridge.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
TB, report.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">TB ：</span><br>
Orders received. The number of ice floes is increasing. An iceberg has been spotted ahead.<br>
At the current speed and bearing, probability of collision is extremely low. It can be easily maneuvered around.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Alright...<br>
(When you think you're safe, THAT'S when accidents happen.)<br>
<br>
Almost as if to prop up my fears, the interior of the ship makes a sudden, loud bang.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">TB ：</span><br>
Breaching attempt into your cabin's security system has been detected. Anomaly detected in ship's engine room.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Wait, what?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">TB ：</span><br>
Unable to correct course at ship's current speed. Probability of iceberg collision has increased to 100%.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
(The breaching attempt will have to wait...)<br>
(We'll hit the iceberg in no time at this rate. This would be a cause for panic for a normal cruise ship.)<br>
(It's a good thing this is no NORMAL cruise ship.)<br>
TB, patch me in to the lookouts.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">TB ：</span><br>
Orders received.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Lookouts, disembark at once and get in combat formation. Sink that iceberg!<br>
<br>
The ship remains on course, heading straight for the iceberg.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
On my mark. Five, four, three, two, one... Fire!<br>
<br>
On my command, flames burst from the guns of New Jersey's squadron.<br>
The iceberg is pummeled by the might of the battleships' main batteries, decimating the section of it that would have hit the ship.<br>
Just as I expected, the iceberg's integrity is quite poor, and its two halves will split easily thanks to the bombardment.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">TB ：</span><br>
Status updated. Emergency alert rescinded. Excellent work, Commander.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Phew. Now I can breathe easy... Hey, who's that on the deck?<br>
<br>
I look out the window and see Harbin and some Empery and Parliament girls, eyes turned to the relatively intact ice floats and talking among themselves.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
(Might as well go talk to them.)<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Harbin：</span><br>
Hahah! This is a rare opportunity to show you one of my skills!<br>
Ever heard of the Ice and Snow Sculpture Festival? It's this big exhibit of ice sculptures from carvers 'round the world.<br>
C'mere and gimme a hand, Commander! We're gonna make an ice cruise ship!<br>
<br>
With Harbin's guidance, our group – and more, as others join later – carve a collection of impressive ice sculptures.<br>
That ought to do it for my sculpture. I should see what the others made.<br>

{{折叠面板|标题=In the Cat House|选项=34|主框=1|样式=primary|展开=是}}
<br>
During my walk, I stop by the cat lodge.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Algérie：</span><br>
Commander! Look how adorable all these widdle kitties are~!<br>
<br>
Algérie greets me, holding an orange tabby cat in her arms. It's purring, and its eyes are narrowed happily.<br>
I look around the room. Kent and Richelieu are there, too, as if it's the most normal thing in the world.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Richelieu：</span><br>
Commander, would you like to feel how soft their fur is? It's ever so soothing.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Kent：</span><br>
Ayanami's having Squawkey catch fresh fish for them, so these babies are all in perfect condition!<br>
<br>
Kent pushes a tuxedo cat into my arms. Said cat has a belly full of fish and is currently taking a tongue-bath.<br>
Seeing how the kitty relaxes in my arms, I can't help but pet the little guy.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Soothing, for sure... I can tell why you all love these cats so much.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Richelieu：</span><br>
Heehee. Just hearing them purr is enough to drain your fatigue away.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Algérie：</span><br>
Yeah~ Commander, if you get tired, you can come pet these babies any time.<br>
<br>
Apparently tired of me petting the same spot on its head over and over, the tuxedo cat suddenly jumps out of my arms.<br>
Then, it finds a doorknob within reach, stands up and puts its front paws on it, and then uses its body weight to push the door open a little.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Kent：</span><br>
Oh no... When did you get so smart, little guy?<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Shouldn't we stop it from getting out?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Richelieu：</span><br>
Hold on a second. Cats are extremely sensitive beings. We must be very quiet and careful in our approach, so as to keep it from getting stressed out.<br>
<br>
We slowly approach the door and try to snag it up close, but the cat manages to escape the cat lodge.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Richelieu：</span><br>
Some places on the ship aren't very safe for kitties... We must hurry and bring it back.<br>
I have a plan. Kent and I will go search for it. Algérie, stay here and try to calm down the others.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Kent：</span><br>
Okay~ Let's do it!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Richelieu：</span><br>
Commander, what will you do? Will you search alongside us, or will you stay here with Algérie?<br>
<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项1：(Go with them.)</span>'''''<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项2：(Think of another way.)</span>'''''<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项1）</span>'''''Let's look for that cat together. Algérie, can you handle comforting the cats on your own?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Algérie：</span><br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项1）</span>'''''Yep. Leave it to me.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项2）</span>'''''(A lost cat is sure to end up with her, I bet...)<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Wait, I have an idea. There's one place we can go that might make this easy as can be.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Kent：</span><br>
Umm? Commander, do you know where that kitty's going?<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Well, it's just a prediction... but I think it's worth looking there first.<br>
<br>
When I get to Jean Bart's room, I find the tuxedo cat there just as expected. Jean Bart herself is at her door, squatting down to eye level with the cat.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
(I knew it... That's our cat magnet for you.)<br>
<br>
After convincing Jean Bart to act as bait, I manage to bring the tuxedo cat back to the cat lodge.<br>
I spend a little more time in the cat lodge. Once I'm thoroughly soothed, I say goodbye to the girls there.<br>
It's still too early for bed. Let's see what other adventures await.<br>

<br>
When I reach the mall, I find Hwah Jah apparently lost in thought.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Hwah Jah, what's wrong? Worried about something?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Hwah Jah：</span><br>
Oh, Commander. There's a big sale going on today, and I'm trying to figure out what to buy on discount to save the most money.<br>
Did you come for the sales, too? We could discount shop together.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
(Big sales, maximizing savings, cashback... I don't like seeing all of these buzzwords together.)<br>
Do you know who owns this mall? This smells like something Akashi would do.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Hwah Jah：</span><br>
Hmm... Ting An was the one who proposed investing in and constructing a shopping mall first, so I'm sure she must be a major shareholder.<br>
She did ask me to help recruit shareholders, though. As I recall, Roma and the St. Louis were the primary buyers...<br>
Friedrich der Große of the Iron Blood, too... But I didn't get a good look at the list of names, so I can't remember if Akashi was involved.<br>
If you're worried, we could try calculating the discounts while we shop. Would that help?<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Yeah. Let's do that.<br>
<br>
Hwah Jah and I look around the shops together.<br>
We eventually reach a store selling daily necessities.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Belfast：</span><br>
Master, Miss Hwah Jah. Good day to both of you. Have you two come to partake in the sales campaign today?<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Yeah, just about.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Surcouf：</span><br>
Commander~ Let us come shopping with you for once~<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Cassin：</span><br>
Commander, umm... Can you push the cart for me? I'm tired of moving...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Belfast：</span><br>
Heehee. May we join the two of you, Master and Miss?<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Sure. The more, the merrier.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Hwah Jah：</span><br>
Fine with me, too.<br>
<br>
Before long, everyone has gathered varying quantities of spoils.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Belfast：</span><br>
Master, is there nothing you want?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Surcouf：</span><br>
Whoa, you're not kidding. We all bought so much stuff, but the Commander's hands are empty.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Hwah Jah：</span><br>
Yeah... The Commander even paid for all of our things. Now I feel really bad...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Cassin：</span><br>
Commander, are you tired?<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
There wasn't anything I wanted, really.<br>
But when I was paying, I couldn't help but notice – these discounts are no joke.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Hwah Jah：</span><br>
Does that make you feel at ease, Commander? Heehee.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
(Phew... Finally, a place that Akashi hasn't gotten her demonic paws on.)<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Surcouf：</span><br>
Huh? Speaking of, look at the tags. All of our stuff came from the same exact manufacturer.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Belfast：</span><br>
Yes. I've already confirmed that every product bears the inscription, "Made in Akashi Workshop."<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Hwah Jah：</span><br>
Umm... Commander, do you think...<br>
<br>
After confirming our customer support concerns with Ting An, I see the girls back to their rooms.<br>
Now that I'm free again, I might as well check out some other places.<br>

<br>
While I walk through the cabin quarter, I notice a certain door has been left wide open.<br>
A pink figure lies on the floor in front of the room.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Hm...? Laffey?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Laffey：</span><br>
Zzz... Commander, why are you in my dream...<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
You're not dreaming. Take my hand, and let's get you to bed.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Laffey：</span><br>
Bed... Oh, I just remembered... Come with Laffey...<br>
<br>
Laffey stands up, grabs me by the wrist, and pulls me into her room.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Whydah：</span><br>
Commander? *yaaawn*... Laffey was gone for so long, I figured she was off trying to get you to join our pajama party...<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
......<br>
<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项1：No, actually, she was sleeping in the hallway.</span>'''''<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项2：You just woke up, and you're already going to sleep again?</span>'''''<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项3：Why are you having a pajama party in the middle of the day?</span>'''''<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Laffey：</span><br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项1）</span>'''''I fell asleep on my way to find the Commander, yep... Zzz...<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项1）</span>'''''......<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Whydah：</span><br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项2）</span>'''''There's no law that says you can't do that... Isn't that right, Le Malin?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Le Malin：</span><br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项2）</span>'''''Yep yep. Sleep is best when it's daytime, too...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Shinano ：</span><br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项3）</span>'''''This one asked the same question, and yet...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Nicholas：</span><br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项3）</span>'''''Ugh, you've got it all wrong... You're supposed to ask what's so wrong with sleeping just because it's daytime.<br>
<br>
When I'm confronted by the pajama party attendees, I realize that I'M the one with the screwed up work-life balance.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Okay, so how does this party work? Do you play games, or...?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Laffey：</span><br>
Laffey wanted to ask Shinano... to use her power to give everyone sweet dreams...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Le Malin：</span><br>
*sigh*... We've just slept so much that it's hard to sleep any more...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Nicholas：</span><br>
Phew... That's why I suggested we should have a pillow fight.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Whydah：</span><br>
Throwing pillows around really helps tire you out, after all!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Le Malin：</span><br>
But Shinano's so hesitant to join us...<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Hm? Shinano, do you dislike pillow fights?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Shinano ：</span><br>
I wouldn't say I dislike them... However, this one's constitution poses a problem...<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
(Is that what she's worried about?)<br>
Don't worry about it. I'm here, so have all the fun you want.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Shinano ：</span><br>
If you say so... then I shall...<br>
<br>
They started pillow fighting, but before long, Laffey decided to lie down, clutching her pillow tight.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Laffey：</span><br>
Laffey too tired... Sleepy...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Le Malin：</span><br>
Me, too... But opportunities like this don't come every day. Commander, can you tell us a story?<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Sure, but what kind?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Nicholas：</span><br>
Mm, just whatever you can tell engagingly.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Whydah：</span><br>
Agreed~ The story itself doesn't matter. We just want to hear your voice...<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Shinano?<br>
<br>
I turn around and find that Shinano's already drifted off to dreams. Her soft, fluffy tail has stretched over and wrapped around me.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Shinano ：</span><br>
...Zzz...<br>
<br>
By the time I've told them a decidedly average fairy tale, Laffey, Le Malin, Nicholas, and Whydah have all fallen asleep.<br>
I gently free myself from Shinano's fluffy restraint and put a blanket over the group.<br>
After I've closed the blackout curtains, I quietly leave the cabin, careful not to wake them.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
(Man, now I'm a little tired... I'll walk around a little, get some fresh air, and hopefully clear my mind.)<br>

{{折叠面板|标题=A Secretary Hard at Work|选项=37|主框=1|样式=primary|展开=是}}
<br>
At a rather late time, I return to my office space.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
(Hm? Normally, everyone's having a barbecue at this time of night. Why's my office light on?)<br>
<br>
When I open the door, Memphis is there.<br>
Despite the fact that we're on this cruise to have fun, Memphis takes her secretary work seriously. She's been putting her whole heart into her work lately.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Leave the rest to me, okay, Memphis?<br>
Our vacation's almost over. We get back to port tomorrow... Let's enjoy what's left of it while we can.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Memphis：</span><br>
You're one to talk, Commander...<br>
But if I do that, you'll have to waste more of your own time and energy to finish the work, won't you?<br>
Y'know, it might be a group vacation, but I have my own needs...<br>
Specifically the need to see you properly enjoying YOUR vacation, Commander.<br>
I'm more than happy now that I've seen you get away from your desk and have fun with everyone.<br>
<br>
The aurora shines beautifully outside the window, reflecting in Memphis's verdant eyes.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Memphis：</span><br>
So I'm just fine, Commander.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
In that case, can you at least let me help you with the rest? Call it a reward for all your hard work.<br>
Once it's all over, let's go to the garden on deck. I'll cook you a nice midnight meal. What do you say?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Memphis：</span><br>
You mean it?!<br>
Ahem... Well, that sounds lovely.<br>
But if we're to have a late night meal, considering your work-life balance and your health... we'd better get this work done quick.<br>
Try not to hold me back, Commander♪<br>
<br>
Memphis winks playfully at me and hands over a bundle of documents.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Alright. Let's get 'er done.<br>
<br>
I use my communicator to ask Belfast to leave the grill and some ingredients behind. Then, Memphis and I complete our work at record pace.<br>
After that, we enjoy a midnight meal on the deck.<br>
I take Memphis back to her room, but I don't go back to my own.<br>
Because there's one last thing I need to do before our return to port tomorrow.<br>

38 The Cat in the Magic Hat<br>
During some light drinking at the cruise ship bar, I enjoy the gentle sea breeze.<br>
Suddenly, a flock of white pigeons flies my way and lands right in front of me.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
(Hm? Why are there pigeons out on the sea?)<br>
<br>
While I wonder where they came from, they suddenly turn to smoke with a bang.<br>
A girl's silhouette emerges – and then lunges at me.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Cheshire：</span><br>
Owneeer! Your personal magician, Cheshire, has arrived! Heehee, cuddles~♡<br>
Wasn't my entrance just awesome?<br>
<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项1：It was great!</span>'''''<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项2：That was almost ninja-like.</span>'''''<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">{playername}：</span><br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项1）</span>'''''It must've taken a lot of effort to put that together.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Cheshire：</span><br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项1）</span>'''''Heehee... For YOU, I'd learn how to do anything!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">{playername}：</span><br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项2）</span>'''''Ninjas tend to appear from smokescreens, right? More than magicians, at least.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Cheshire：</span><br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项2）</span>'''''Yeah, sure! Then next time, I'll make my big entrance like a ninja for you!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Cheshire：</span><br>
You don't know how long I've been holding that in, waiting to surprise you with it!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">{playername}：</span><br>
Is that why I didn't see you all day today?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Cheshire：</span><br>
Heheh♡ You were looking for me the whole day, weren't you? I'm so moved~<br>
But when you're making an entrance, timing is everything! It took all my willpower to stop myself from jumping out and cuddling you on the spot!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">{playername}：</span><br>
Timing?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Cheshire：</span><br>
Heheh, you'll understand soon.<br>
Anyway, Owner, let's play a game! I want you to see your dearest's magician's best side♪<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">{playername}：</span><br>
Sure. What should I do?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Cheshire：</span><br>
As soon as I respond, Cheshire sidles closer to me.<br>
She was close already before, but she's basically glued to me now.<br>
Fiiirst... Pick a card, Owner. Any card~<br>
Cheshire whispers into my ear and produces a deck of cards out of seemingly nowhere.<br>
I obediently draw a card.<br>
Good~ Now, put the card in my hat, if you'd please!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">{playername}：</span><br>
Hm?<br>
You're not going to have me hide the card so you can guess which one it is?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Cheshire：</span><br>
Owner, everyone and their mother can do that!<br>
I'm not like other magicians♪<br>
She takes off her silk hat and smoothly takes my card-bearing hand.<br>
Her fingertips are a little chilly, perhaps from the cool sea breeze.<br>
Heheh... Good! Now, Owner, put the card in my hat!<br>
Cheshire's hand guides mine to the hat, where I drop the playing card. When I do, a rabbit jumps out from inside.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">{playername}：</span><br>
Where'd that rabbit come from?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Cheshire：</span><br>
I'm not done yet♪ Watch closely, now!<br>
With a bang, the rabbit turns into a puff of smoke like before.<br>
Following that, there's a light in the night sky.<br>
A pigeon... A rabbit... And the suit of the card I pulled!<br>
Heheh~ This is the magic I really wanted you to see, Owner!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">{playername}：</span><br>
Incredible... How did you do this?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Cheshire：</span><br>
A good magician never reveals her secrets!<br>
Do you like it, Owner?<br>
<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项1：I do.</span>'''''<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项2：I LOVE it!</span>'''''<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Cheshire：</span><br>
Then my efforts weren't in vain!<br>
A surprise for you to celebrate your cruise trip...<br>
Fireworks and the sea make for a good pair. Just like the two of us!<br>
This time, the fireworks up above burst in the shape of Cheshire herself with perfect timing.<br>
Heheh, my plan was originally to stop with the card suit, but I just had to put myself into the performance!<br>
Now there are more Cheshires to celebrate with you!<br>
The fireworks faded in the night sky, but the light in Cheshire's eyes replaced them.<br>
May you have a wonderful cruise, Owner. With me, I hope...<br>
Have a wonderful, unforgettable vacation full of surprises...<br>
Heheh, Owner♡ Don't you think I deserve a reward for all I did?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">{playername}：</span><br>
What would you like?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Cheshire：</span><br>
Hmm... Let me think about it, okay?<br>
Stargazing with you, feeling the sea breeze, eating good food at the restaurant together...<br>
Nuh-uh! Those are all too normal! Let me really, REALLY think about it.<br>
<br>
Her voice, and her wishes, are carried far off by the sea breeze.<br>
Far into the realm of dreams.<br>

39 Heat-Beating Summer Sacrament<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">{playername}：</span><br>
(The ship's pool is supposed to be around here, I think...)<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Alsace：</span><br>
La la la la laaa~♪<br>
Alsaaace~ The fleet's aaace~♪<br>
Fearless fighter, here with the Commander~<br>
I spot Alsace, soaking in the pool and singing an odd song to herself while she sucks on a popsicle.<br>
Either her senses are dulled by the heat, or she's so relaxed that she's not paying attention...<br>
Whichever it is, she doesn't seem to realize that I'm here.<br>
<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项1：(Clear throat.)</span>'''''<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项2：(Call her name.)</span>'''''<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">{playername}：</span><br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项1）</span>'''''Ahem...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">{playername}：</span><br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项2）</span>'''''Alsace?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Alsace：</span><br>
C-Commander?! If you're coming in, wait a sec! I'm looking for something right now...<br>
When she notices me, Alsace suddenly panics. In the commotion, she drops her sunglasses into the pool.<br>
I-I can't find it... My Commander brainwave interceptor!<br>
(She had her sunglasses on until just now... Did she not notice?)<br>
I get into the pool and pick up her sunglasses for her.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">{playername}：</span><br>
Commander brainwave interceptor... Would those happen to be these sunglasses?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Alsace：</span><br>
Y-y-y-yeah... Thanks, Commander.<br>
She accepts them and puts them back on her face, still a little flustered.<br>
Ahem! Status, fully recovered. Temperatures normal.<br>
Awaiting your orders, Commander.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">{playername}：</span><br>
(She's making a big show of being fine...)<br>
I just came here to swim, and I happened to find you here. Kick back and relax, okay?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Alsace：</span><br>
Emotion module is being liquid-cooled.<br>
Due to a likelihood of prolonged contact with the Commander, this one has been liquid-cooling my module to avoid overheating...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">{playername}：</span><br>
If you stay in the water forever, you won't get to join in the festivities inside.<br>
Wanna walk around with me?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Alsace：</span><br>
Commander, are you inviting me on a date...?<br>
<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项1：Yeah, I guess I am.</span>'''''<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项2：A date it is.</span>'''''<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Alsace：</span><br>
Ah... Aah... Whoa...<br>
Hearing my affirmative answer, Alsace suddenly starts trembling.<br>
(Is it just me, or is the pool getting hot awfully fast?)<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">{playername}：</span><br>
Alsace? You okay there?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Alsace：</span><br>
Commander brainwave interceptor... malfunctioning... I-I'm losing control...<br>
The liquid-cooling was supposed to outpace my emotion module... No, no, no, no!<br>
O-oooh, the Commander's getting even closer...<br>
Visual module malfunctioning! Thought module connection going haywire!<br>
I-I'm going to explode!<br>
Alsace panics more and more. Her sunglasses fall off again at some point, too.<br>
I don't know if it's because of her higher body temperature or pure embarrassment...<br>
...But her fair skin visibly turns a shade of pink.<br>
I-I'm losing my ability to move...<br>
Alsace goes limp and collapses right into my arms.<br>
I-I might need a more efficient liquid-cooling method...<br>
Mm...♡<br>

40 Locker Room Lechery<br>
I was supposed to get in the pool with Mogador around this time.<br>
But at this time, I don't see–<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Mogador：</span><br>
Aha♥ Commandeeer♥ Wanna give me a hand?<br>
I finally bump into her in the locker room. She has a big bath towel on, and she's wriggling excitedly.<br>
I just can't get this swimsuit on by myself!<br>
Heehee♥ So I waited until you came in here so I could get your help♥ Otherwise, we can't swim together, can we?<br>
Mogador slowly takes off the bath towel and walks over to the locker room door.<br>
She then squats down and puts the towel down by the door. But then, I hear the door lock.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">{playername}：</span><br>
Huh?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Mogador：</span><br>
Haha♥ Sorry, Commander...<br>
If everyone knew I didn't know how to put on a swimsuit, they'd all tease me.<br>
Sooo... I had to lock it♥<br>
Don't you daaare open it until I finally have it on.<br>
Now without her towel, Mogador turns back to me.<br>
Dark-purple fabric digs tightly into her fair, smooth skin.<br>
Her purple eyes, normally hidden by her long bangs, shine brightly in the light of the dressing room.<br>
Now... Commander, I want you to slooowly, bit by bit, fix my swimsuit for me.<br>
I shake off dirty thoughts and check the fit of her swimsuit.<br>
At a glance, it looks like she's wearing it right, but it's fastened so wrong that you'd almost think it was on purpose.<br>
Merely getting in the water would probably cause it to fall apart.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">{playername}：</span><br>
Mogador, have you ever tried this swimsuit on?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Mogador：</span><br>
Of course~ I wouldn't buy it if I hadn't...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">{playername}：</span><br>
Do you remember how you wore it then?<br>
Really, even I can't figure out how to fix the straps...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Mogador：</span><br>
Heehee♥ I'll just have to teach you, then...<br>
First, press this down with your finger... Then take this♥<br>
You did iiit! Perfect positioning. Wow, Commander, you're so good at this~<br>
With Mogador's instruction, I manage to fix her swimsuit.<br>
Phew...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">{playername}：</span><br>
Good enough?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Mogador：</span><br>
Yep, it's perfect♥<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">{playername}：</span><br>
(You definitely could've done that on your own...)<br>
<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项1：(Stare silently.)</span>'''''<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Mogador：</span><br>
What's wrong? You've got such a passionate look in your eyes, Commandeeer♥<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">{playername}：</span><br>
Mogador, you clearly know how to wear it right.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Mogador：</span><br>
Heehee♥ Guess my silly excuses won't get through you.<br>
I just wanted to be alone with you♥<br>
Mogador's breathing gets faster and rougher.<br>
Every time she twists and wriggles, a sweet scent spreads through the room.<br>
Haha... I think the AC in here is broken...<br>
I'm sooo hot right now.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">{playername}：</span><br>
Yeah. This is no good.<br>
<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项1：Society needs AC to function in the summer!</span>'''''<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项2：I'll go call the maintenance staff!</span>'''''<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Mogador：</span><br>
Heehee♥ What are you talking about, Commander?<br>
I heard your body cools down when you sweat...<br>
So what we need isn't to fix the AC.<br>
Just... get hotter and hotter with me~♥<br>
Mogador opens her arms in apparent anticipation.<br>
Commandeeer♥ Your thoughts?♥<br>
The gleam in her eyes, peeking out from between her bangs, tells me that I won't be sleeping tonight...<br>

41 An Afternoon on the Lido Deck<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">St. Louis：</span><br>
I rush over to the pool, where St. Louis is relaxing on a swim ring.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">{playername}：</span><br>
Sorry I'm late. Some sudden work came up.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">St. Louis：</span><br>
Don't be so worried about it, Commander.<br>
Heheh, I can have plenty of fun on my own... but I am happier to have you around.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">{playername}：</span><br>
Sorry for making you wait.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">St. Louis：</span><br>
Stop apologizing, silly. I'm not mad at you, or anything.<br>
If you really want to make it up to me, though...<br>
How about you help me put on a fresh layer of sunscreen?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">{playername}：</span><br>
A fresh layer?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">St. Louis：</span><br>
Sunscreen loses effectiveness after a couple hours. I think mine's just about to wear off.<br>
I don't wanna get sunburned. Won't you please, Commander?<br>
Don't miss a single spot, okay?♪<br>
<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项1：(Silently get to work.)</span>'''''<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项2：Leave it to me!</span>'''''<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">St. Louis：</span><br>
I accept the sunscreen and start applying it as directed.<br>
Heehee... Yeah, right there.<br>
Gentle and careful fingers, please.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">{playername}：</span><br>
...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">St. Louis：</span><br>
Heehee, you're adorable when you're so focused, Commander.<br>
Mm... Ah, can you just move my swimsuit aside there?<br>
It's hard to reach myself, so you'll have to do it.<br>
Yeah, right there. A little more, please.<br>
Heehee. I won't complain if you go further.<br>
With St. Louis's patient guidance, I manage to get her covered in sunscreen again.<br>
Phew... Quick sip of a nice, cold drink... Perfect. Now I can really bask.<br>
Want a sip, Commander? As a reward for helping me out♪<br>
It'll cool you right down.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">{playername}：</span><br>
But the straw...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">St. Louis：</span><br>
You're bothered that there's only one? Heehee, well, do you expect me to get two when I'm drinking it myself?<br>
Come on. Keep waiting, and the ice will melt. Drink up!<br>
The cold drink flows through the straw and into my throat. Heat seems to drain out of me all at once.<br>
I glance at St. Louis. She's changed into a comfy position to lie on her floatie.<br>
Now that you've finished putting my sunscreen on, do you wanna sunbathe with me?<br>
Nice rays, a sea breeze... It's just right.<br>
Your swim ring... Hmm, going to get it seems like unnecessary effort. Just come join me on mine.<br>
It might be a little cramped... but if we snuggle tight, we'll fit just fine.<br>
Besides... I think it might be more fun that way.<br>
I do as she says and try getting on the floatie.<br>
She smiles coquettishly at me.<br>
Heehee, now... Let's have fun together...<br>
Commander♥<br>

42 A Glimpse of Greatness<br>
I walk around in search of Tosa. In the private bath, I finally manage to find her.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Tosa：</span><br>
Commander? Shouldn't you be preparing for the dance?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">{playername}：</span><br>
Actually...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Tosa：</span><br>
Oh. So you noticed I was gone and came here to take me back to the venue?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">{playername}：</span><br>
That was the plan, but I've given up on that by now.<br>
I think you left because you're not interested in joining the dance. So now I'm just here to check on you personally.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Tosa：</span><br>
Hmm, really? I thought I'd be able to wait out the storm here, but I guess not.<br>
So, how did you figure out I was here?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">{playername}：</span><br>
How? I guess... intuition?<br>
You don't take to trivial tasks... so I figured you must have gone somewhere looking for a change of scenery.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Tosa：</span><br>
*sigh*... Nothing gets past you.<br>
Oh, whatever. Your intuition was correct, so I guess that means you and I think alike, in a way.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">{playername}：</span><br>
Well, we've known each other for a long time now.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Tosa：</span><br>
Heehee. Let's go with that.<br>
Well, you've successfully checked up on me. Care to join me?<br>
You can't do much but watch if you just stand there, no?<br>
<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项1：Don't mind if I do.</span>'''''<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项2：Uhh, I dunno...</span>'''''<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Tosa：</span><br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项2）</span>'''''You wouldn't have said all that if you couldn't do it. Quit being indecisive and just get in.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Tosa：</span><br>
I step into the bath and enjoy a moment's peace with Tosa.<br>
Through the steam, I can see the stars dotting the night sky.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">{playername}：</span><br>
So are you sure you don't want to join the dance?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Tosa：</span><br>
...If I feel like it, I might.<br>
Upon saying so, she languidly pushes up her robe.<br>
For now, enjoy the scenery before your eyes.<br>
The cruise ship might be big, but it's noisy to match. You don't get many opportunities to quietly gaze at the night sky.<br>
The stars seem to move in time with the cruise ship.<br>
The moon's reflection dances on the waves, glowing under the ship's lights.<br>
It's an uncanny blue, reminiscent of her hair accessory.<br>
Taking myself away from the hustle and bustle and immersing myself in the sights makes me feel so much better.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">{playername}：</span><br>
Were you unhappy before, then?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Tosa：</span><br>
Not at all. I was just... a little bored.<br>
But even the beauty of the night sky isn't quite enough to excite me.<br>
<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项1：If you'd like me to help...</span>'''''<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项2：What should I do?</span>'''''<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Tosa：</span><br>
Hmm... Good idea.<br>
"The heart is a reflecting pool, the moon's reflection mirrors your emotions. When one moves, the other dances in turn."<br>
Mesmerizing beauty is one thing... but having you by my side is much more important to me.<br>
Care to stay a little longer, Commander?<br>
With you around, I think I can do something a little more exciting... a little more satisfying.<br>
I wouldn't want to put such a beautiful night to waste. Would you?<br>

My legs take on a mind of their own and bring me to the lido pool.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Harbin：</span><br>
Hey, if it isn't the Commander!<br>
Didja get up early to take in some sun? The rays feel great at this time of day.<br>
Get over here! Lie down with me and bask for a while.<br>
We bathe in the sun's gentle rays, and I reminisce on the past few days of the cruise.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">{playername}：</span><br>
This cruise was more than just a surprise. It went far beyond what I expected.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Harbin：</span><br>
This is awfully sudden. What's on your mind?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">{playername}：</span><br>
Nothing much. It just occurred to me, is all.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Harbin：</span><br>
Hahaha! Well, I am a member of the Construction Committee. Since you brought it up, maybe you should pay us a compliment or two!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">{playername}：</span><br>
Okay... Well, the restaurant is incredible, the cabins are comfortable, and I'm enjoying the wide array of leisure facilities.<br>
The pool is very tasteful, too, and the water temperature is perfect. It's convenient how you set up a rest area and drink bar right next to it, too.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Harbin：</span><br>
Well said! Actually, I'm a big fan of the deck, myself.<br>
It's made of quality materials with slip-resistant treatment, so it's great to walk on.<br>
I knew it was a great idea to build a new ship outright instead of buying a prebuilt one.<br>
Hey, that gave me a great idea!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">{playername}：</span><br>
Oh?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Harbin：</span><br>
Ahaha! Tell me, Commander. What do you NOT like about the ship?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">{playername}：</span><br>
What I don't like? This is starting to sound like some kind of post-purchase survey...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Harbin：</span><br>
Hahaha! Call it that, if you want. It's related to that thing I just came up with, though.<br>
I mean, the ship's already built, right? Its strengths and flaws are already set in stone.<br>
But the next cruise ship is a bundle of infinite possibilities.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">{playername}：</span><br>
The next one?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Harbin：</span><br>
Yeah. We're gonna expand on the parts you like, and we'll fix up those flaws...<br>
And then, how about I give you the end result as a gift? Free of charge!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">{playername}：</span><br>
But we have a cruise ship already.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Harbin：</span><br>
Hahaha! Every cruise ship is unique in its own way, y'know.<br>
The one we're on right now is here for you to enjoy a vacation with all your friends.<br>
As for the next one... That one can be just for the two of us.<br>
With a hearty laugh, Harbin immediately focuses herself on the prospect of a new ship.<br>
With a ship just for you and me, we could go anywhere we wanted, hang out any time we wanted! Call that a win-win!<br>
A sweet little journey on the sea, just the two of us...<br>
Are you getting excited, Commander? Because I sure am!<br>
Alright, it's decided! When we get back, I'll get to work on that right away!<br>
It's gonna take some time, but just you wait!<br>

44 Bathroom Slip-Up<br>
Prinz Adalbert invites me to her cabin, and I naturally take her up on that.<br>
As soon as I enter, the first thing I see is...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Prinz Adalbert：</span><br>
Oof, ouch...<br>
...The bathroom door, wide open.<br>
Soap suds are practically flooding out of there, soaking the cabin carpet.<br>
Prinz Adalbert herself is a veritable mountain of bubbles. When she fell, her towel slipped right off.<br>
<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项1：(Help her up.)</span>'''''<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项2：(Ask what happened.)</span>'''''<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">{playername}：</span><br>
(I'm curious how she ended up this way, but first, I'd better help her up.)<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Prinz Adalbert：</span><br>
I decide to go in there and help the poor girl.<br>
Oh, Commander! Be careful. It's slippery in here. You don't want to end up on your butt like I just did...<br>
Wow, you've got good balance. Could you bring me that shampoo while you're at it?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">{playername}：</span><br>
Okay.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Prinz Adalbert：</span><br>
When I turn around to get the shampoo, I step on a bar of soap concealed by the bubbles.<br>
And then...<br>
Whoa! Careful, Commander!<br>
Oh, no... Down goes another.<br>
Are you okay? Hmm... Should I be the one to help you up? I can crawl over.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">{playername}：</span><br>
No, no, I'm fine. I don't want you falling a second time.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Prinz Adalbert：</span><br>
Oh... Riiight. Okay, I'll stay right here. Good luck, Commander. I'm counting on you!<br>
I manage to peel my upper half off of the slick floor and turn to face Adalbert, who's still sitting the way she was before.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">{playername}：</span><br>
Question. Why is the bathroom covered in suds?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Prinz Adalbert：</span><br>
Oooh, well, it's a funny story.<br>
When I saw that iceberg sinking earlier, I had a great idea. What if I could apply that same concept to my kickboxing?<br>
Like, whoosh whoosh, bam!<br>
I thought it'd be fun to spar with you, so I called and invited you over.<br>
Then I got bored waiting for you, so I got in the bath...<br>
But JUST bathing is boring, too, so I started looking for a way to have fun. You get how I feel, don't you?<br>
I just... didn't think it'd lead to so many bubbles.<br>
Adalbert awkwardly dries her hair with the towel that's been sitting on her head.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">{playername}：</span><br>
Umm... Okay. You didn't get hurt, though?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Prinz Adalbert：</span><br>
Nope. I'm fine as can be.<br>
You really look concerned. Were you that worried about me?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">{playername}：</span><br>
Of course I was.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Prinz Adalbert：</span><br>
Heheh... Thanks. I'm fine, though. C'mon, let's play in the bubbles together.<br>
Before I can comprehend her offer, she grabs a nearby clump of bubbles...<br>
...And she throws them at me.<br>
Direct hit! One point to Prinz Adalbert!<br>
Seeing her joy infects me and rouses my playful side in turn.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">{playername}：</span><br>
Take this!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Prinz Adalbert：</span><br>
The bathroom becomes an even bigger mess of bubbles.<br>
Phew... Not bad, Commander.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">{playername}：</span><br>
......<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Prinz Adalbert：</span><br>
Aww, nice. You finally smiled!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">{playername}：</span><br>
Hm?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Prinz Adalbert：</span><br>
You've been taking things so seriously today. I realized I haven't seen you smile much.<br>
So it's a relief to see those pearly whites now.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">{playername}：</span><br>
Is that the whole reason you invited me here? You wanted to spar with me and... make me smile?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Prinz Adalbert：</span><br>
Hmm... You're right about making you smile, but I was never actually going to kickbox with you.<br>
Uh, what was I trying to do, again...? Eh, forget it. I got the smile I wanted anyway.<br>
And look. You're all soaked now, Commander. Guess we gotta take a bath together!<br>
I'll wash that back good and clean for you.<br>

45 The Sprite's Snapshot<br>
Today, I decide to go to the cruise arcade.<br>
It has apparently just been cleaned in preparation for tonight's game night.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Tashkent：</span><br>
But more eye-catching than all the arcade cabinets is Tashkent, who's sitting languidly on the lounge sofa.<br>
She's still dressed in her costume from yesterday's costume party.<br>
Dear comrade, you finally came...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">{playername}：</span><br>
Hm? Were you waiting for me, or something?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Tashkent：</span><br>
I sure was.<br>
I wanted to give you a biiig hug... Mmph.<br>
When I approach, I finally notice a soft haze in her eyes.<br>
Add that to the wine glass on the low table next to her...<br>
<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项1：Do you think maybe you drank a little too much?</span>'''''<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项2：Getting a little sleepy?</span>'''''<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Tashkent：</span><br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项1）</span>'''''Nah. That would never happen to me... Mmph.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">{playername}：</span><br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项2）</span>'''''Maybe consider having a nap? Call it a pajama party.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Tashkent：</span><br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项2）</span>'''''Pajama party? I dunno. I'm not interested.<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项2）</span>'''''Besides, I'm not even tired...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Tashkent：</span><br>
She picks up the wine glass and gulps down the rest of its contents.<br>
The ice sprite's throat bobs with each little gulp.<br>
...Mmph.<br>
Wanna drink some, dear comrade? It's just soda.<br>
Tashkent pats the couch next to her, urging me to join her.<br>
I sit down as directed. She refills her emptied glass and then hands it to me.<br>
Traces of Tashkent's lip balm are present on the rim.<br>
Use my glass. I don't mind.<br>
I accept and take a sip.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">{playername}：</span><br>
It really is just soda...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Tashkent：</span><br>
Yeah♪ See? I told no lies.<br>
I remembered you told me you liked this outfit when we were drinking at the bar, so I changed clothes and came here.<br>
You're joining the game night, aren't you? So...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">{playername}：</span><br>
So you waited here for that?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Tashkent：</span><br>
Tashkent nods silently.<br>
Either from the heat of the arcade, or for some other reason, her cheeks are a little flushed.<br>
First you get here late, then you accuse me of drinking too much...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">{playername}：</span><br>
I'm sorry. That wasn't nice of me.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Tashkent：</span><br>
Oh, it's okay if you apologize, but I wasn't trying to get you to.<br>
Tashkent visibly pouts... She's a lot more candid than usual.<br>
You need to be punished, dear comrade...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">{playername}：</span><br>
Punished?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Tashkent：</span><br>
I know... I'll punish you by putting your head in my lap and cleaning your ears for you.<br>
<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项1：That doesn't sound like punishment.</span>'''''<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项2：You're going to punish me in a way that's good for me...?</span>'''''<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Tashkent：</span><br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项1）</span>'''''If I say it is, then it is.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Tashkent：</span><br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项2）</span>'''''Oh, you mean you like that? I see...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">{playername}：</span><br>
(Now that I really think about it, she's not exactly in a state to be going near any of my orifices.)<br>
Could you pick something else, actually? Maybe after you sober up a little...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Tashkent：</span><br>
Oh. Then I'm going to play on the arcade cabinets. Come help me practice.<br>
Now, goooo... Mmph.<br>
Tashkent jumps onto her feet, but before she can take so much as three steps, she starts to lose balance.<br>
I rush to catch her before she falls.<br>
Mmph... Dear comrade... I love you.<br>
She closes her eyes and blushes all the way to her ears and neck.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">{playername}：</span><br>
(Yeah, she's too drunk.)<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Tashkent：</span><br>
Left with no other choice, I pick her up and carry her off to her cabin.<br>

46 Duet of Guiding Stars<br>
On the balcony, I feel the gentle sea breeze caress my cheeks. Memories of the trip so far reverberate in my mind.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">{playername}：</span><br>
Phew...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Emden：</span><br>
Why do you sigh, my darling human? "Is it an expectant sigh, perhaps?"<br>
At some point, Emden – the cruise receptionists – had appeared to me without my notice.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">{playername}：</span><br>
Emden? Shouldn't you be busy managing the cruise?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Emden：</span><br>
Such trivial tasks are easy for Emden♪ "We completed our duties long ago, human."<br>
More importantly, you've yet to answer our question.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">{playername}：</span><br>
It's almost time to go back to port. Our vacation is almost over.<br>
I was just getting a little emotional...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Emden：</span><br>
Aww... Do you wish this trip could go on forever, my darling human? "We could make that happen."<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">{playername}：</span><br>
Hey, how did you know I was here?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Emden：</span><br>
We're the receptionists, so we know everything that happens on this cruise. "Isn't that obvious?"<br>
Naturally, we know every little thing you do every second of the day. Heehee♡<br>
...That aside, as this vacation draws to a close, we would love to hear your thoughts on the voyage so far.<br>
"Tell Emden everything. Without reservation♥"<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">{playername}：</span><br>
Is this a survey, or what?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Emden：</span><br>
We just want to record your frank thoughts, my darling human... "Yes, that is Emden's privilege alone."<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">{playername}：</span><br>
Alright.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Emden：</span><br>
As I share my thoughts, they begin writing something in their notebook.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">{playername}：</span><br>
Umm, can I see what you're writing...?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Emden：</span><br>
Heehee... "Of course not."<br>
"Everything in here is top-secret♥" They're all just boring notes and records, really♡<br>
Their blue eyes have a mischievous glint.<br>
If you simply must know, then Emden would be happy to tell you.<br>
"That's right, human. All you have to do is beg♥"<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">{playername}：</span><br>
Wait, you don't mean...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Emden：</span><br>
Have you figured it out? Yes, these are all notes painstakingly recorded to plan the perfect, most loving vacation for you, my darling human.<br>
"A journey of love, just for you and Emden. A trip to paradise. You must be getting excited for it, heehee♥"<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">{playername}：</span><br>
Are you planning another trip right after this one?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Emden：</span><br>
No. Emden still has much to think about. "We have collected much information, but our process has been inefficient..."<br>
As such, we're going to change our information-gathering method♡ "Asking you directly is so much faster than observation and recording, after all♥"<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">{playername}：</span><br>
Wh-what does that entail...?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Emden：</span><br>
My adorable human, if you have any other plans tonight... you'd best cancel them now.<br>
"You belong to Emden for the rest of today♥" Yes, Emden and Emden alone♡<br>
Never will you have to sigh again... "For Emden will guide you to pure paradise♥"<br>
