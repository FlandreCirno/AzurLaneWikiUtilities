The Protector Needs Protecting<br>
<br>
1 The Protector's Other Side<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Le Malin：</span><br>
Commander, is there anything that needs fixing from the last batch of documents I handed over?<br>
If not, I'll just keep going at this current pace.<br>
<br>
Le Malin, the poisoned blade of the Vichya Dominion, is here for her first day of secretary duties.<br>
When she's in work mode, she conducts herself seriously, communicates effectively, and quickly takes care of everything she is assigned.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Le Malin：</span><br>
Hmm? Are you stepping out, Commander?<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
I had some other minor affairs to attend to, so I decided to leave her in charge of the office during my absence.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Le Malin：</span><br>
Understood. I'll handle the rest of the work, so go do what you need to do.<br>
Yaaaawn... Ugh, so sleepy... Can't do this anymore...<br>
Staying in serious-mode in front of the Commander is so exhausting, I can hardly move a muscle...<br>
The office's soft and fluffy sofa... Mmfwah... It feels so nice...<br>
<br>
When I returned from my errands, the first thing I saw when I stepped into my office... was the elegant poisoned blade of the Vichya Dominion melting into a puddle on my sofa.<br>
So, this is her true face. I see now.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Le Malin：</span><br>
Ahh... I'd probably die of fatigue if I had to keep that elegant act up any longer...<br>
Normally, I'd still be rolling around in bed at this time~<br>
If I don't take a nap while the Commander is away, I'm not gonna be able to make it through the afternoon...<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Ahem...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Le Malin：</span><br>
...C-Commander?!<br>
Ah, umm, this is, uhh...<br>
<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项1：I didn't see anything.</span>'''''<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项2：Hold up. Lemme take pics.</span>'''''<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Le Malin：</span><br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项1）</span>'''''Great, perfect. If you didn't see anything, then there's no problem at all–<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项1）</span>'''''Like hell that's true!!!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Le Malin：</span><br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项2）</span>'''''Nuuuuu, my cover's blown... It's all over now...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Le Malin：</span><br>
Ugh, I thought I'd at least be able to make it through the entire secretary stint, but to get exposed so quickly...<br>
Well, now that the cat's out of the bag, there's no point hiding it now.<br>
That's right, Commander. You've witnessed the truth behind Le Malin, the Vichya Dominion's poisoned blade.<br>
The whole elegant shtick is just an act.<br>
...So, umm, are you disappointed?<br>
You thought I was a certain kind of person, didn't you? Or, something like that...<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
I see. In that case, let's reduce your workload a little.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Le Malin：</span><br>
...Fweh?<br>
You're not angry that I deceived you?<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Isn't it perfectly normal for everyone to have a side that they don't want to show others?<br>
I wouldn't call showing off your good aspects deception at all, and it's certainly nothing you need to apologize for.<br>
If anyone should be apologizing, it should be me, for walking in on you in the first place.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Le Malin：</span><br>
(Wh-what's going on? The Commander not only isn't upset with me, but is even apologizing to me?)<br>
I, I see. You're a weird one, Commander, but I appreciate it.<br>
However, I can't accept your offer to reduce my workload.<br>
While I normally would welcome less work, the way you're so blatantly trying to accommodate me would make me feel guilty.<br>
It goes without saying. My role as secretary ship is to support you, the Commander. It would be a disgrace to the Holy Iris for our roles to be reversed.<br>
Besides, there's a difference between slacking off and taking a break! ...The end result is totally different!<br>
In any case, continue letting me take care of the work just as before!<br>
<br>
Not too long later...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Le Malin：</span><br>
Okay, I did say you can continue letting me take care of the work just as before... But isn't this a bit excessive?!<br>
...Hmm? Split the work? Tempting, but... I said what I said!<br>
I was just grumbling, that's all... Since this is the task I was given, I'm not gonna back down halfway!<br>
<br>
I could tell Le Malin was struggling, but she continued working despite that... though not without the occasional bouts of complaining.<br>
But each time, the sound of pens scritching across paper quickly filled the office.<br>

<br>
2 Hard Work Needs Rewarding<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Le Malin：</span><br>
Siiiigh... Another long day of booooring work...<br>
Don't wanna... I'm gonna pass out if I have to look at another pile of papers...<br>
<br>
While Le Malin did continue to get her work done, she no longer made any attempts to hide her inner thoughts.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Le Malin：</span><br>
Alright, ten minutes of work done. Time to treat myself to a little reward!<br>
That's right! Twenty minutes of relaxation!<br>
<br>
She started to liberate her slacker tendencies and her complaints about work, venting them openly. But alas...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Le Malin：</span><br>
Geh! If I laze around for any longer, I won't have enough time to finish!<br>
Phew, I actually managed to get everything done for the day. Now that's what I call a job well done.<br>
Huh? You're gonna say, "why didn't you just do that from the very beginning," aren't you? I see it written all over your face.<br>
Perfectly reasonable of you to think that, but nope, can't do it. Literally impossible.<br>
Because, me and hard work is like... letting the air out of a balloon.<br>
If anything, I'm curious how you can endure this amount of work every single day...<br>
I can't get any work done unless I'm rewarded!!<br>
Otherwise, nope! No way! Not gonna do anything!<br>
<br>
Le Malin started flailing around on top of my sofa.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
If it's a reward you want...<br>
<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项1：How would you like some of Dunkerque's treats?</span>'''''<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项2：I'll give you extra time to laze around.</span>'''''<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Le Malin：</span><br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项1）</span>'''''So what you're saying is, if I finish work ahead of time, you'll treat me with some of Miss Dunkerque's handmade sweets?!<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项1）</span>'''''*gulp*... You scoundrel... There's no way any sane person could turn down her mouth-watering desserts...<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项1）</span>'''''HOWEVER! That level of temptation isn't enough to make me work hard––<br>
<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项1）</span>'''''How about I also give you extra time to laze around then?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Le Malin：</span><br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项2）</span>'''''So what you're saying is, if I finish work ahead of time, you'll let me roll around on the sofa as much as I want? Even during work hours?!<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项2）</span>'''''Urgh... You scoundrel... Trying to bait me with the sweet, soft embrace of the sofa...<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项2）</span>'''''HOWEVER! That level of temptation isn't enough to make me work hard––<br>
<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项2）</span>'''''What if I threw in Dunkerque's handmade sweets?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Le Malin：</span><br>
Deal.<br>
But you'd better not go back on your word, Commander!!<br>
<br>
...All of a sudden, I felt like I was getting the short end of the stick.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Le Malin：</span><br>
Muahaha... As long as I finish work ahead of time, I'll get to enjoy Miss Dunkerque's sweets WHILE rolling around on the sofa...<br>
Just the thought of that level of bliss is making me extra-motivated!<br>
All right! Starting tomorrow, we're gonna give it our all!<br>
<br>
Indeed, all of Le Malin's facets were on display at once – the side of her that was elegant and serious, the side of her that loved stuffing her face with sweets, and the side of her that wanted to spend the day rolling around on the sofa.<br>

<br>
3 An Excuse to Slack<br>
One day, I found Le Malin slouching in her seat.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Le Malin：</span><br>
Haaaah... Sooooooo tiiiiired...<br>
<br>
She was ruefully massaging her ankles, but...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Le Malin：</span><br>
Bleh, what an annoying mission... My legs are sore all over...<br>
The next time a mission like this comes up, I swear I need to come up with an excuse to get time off!<br>
...But, there's no way the Commander wouldn't notice something that obvious, right? ...*sniffle*, looks like I'll have to take those troublesome transport missions after all...<br>
Well, at least I got back early. Time to take a little nap before I go deliver my report.<br>
In a sense, this place really is pretty awesome.<br>
It's nice and quiet, and there aren't people coming back and forth all the time–<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Suffren：</span><br>
Huh? Le Malin? What are you doing here?<br>
Oh, did you just get back from a commission?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Le Malin：</span><br>
Y-yeah?!<br>
...Miss, umm, Suffren, was it? Wh-why are YOU here?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Suffren：</span><br>
Just on my way to training! Enjoy your break, Le Malin!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Le Malin：</span><br>
Th-there's nothing wrong with taking a break every now and then!<br>
For a member of the elegant Le Fantasque class, a task of this magnitude is no problem at all!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Suffren：</span><br>
Yup, yup! That's our Le Malin for you! In any case, I need to get going now!<br>
<br>
Le Malin managed to put her elegant persona on for just long enough to see Suffren off.<br>
But as soon as the other girl left, she once again collapsed into a puddle.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Le Malin：</span><br>
I knew it... I can't find solace anywhere except in the comfort of my rooooom...<br>
But, what should I do? If I walk all the way back right now, I'm sure my legs are going to turn into jello when I wake up tomorrow morning...<br>
Hrmmmmm... What should I do...<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
(She looks like she's having a rough time. Let's see what's going on.)<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Le Malin：</span><br>
Commander? Fancy seeing you here. Are you on a break as well?<br>
Oh... You're worried about me because I seem to be having trouble with something?<br>
Ah, yes! Of course I'm in a bit of a rough spot right now! Since you're so ready and willing to help––<br>
<br>
Le Malin spread her arms as if expecting me to do something about it.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Let me think...<br>
<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项1：I'll call the infirmary for you.</span>'''''<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项2：I'll carry you back to your room.</span>'''''<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项3：Fine, I'll give you a piggyback ride back to your room.</span>'''''<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Le Malin：</span><br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项1）</span>'''''......Eh?<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项1）</span>'''''I, I suppose that certainly is one option, but...?<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项1）</span>'''''Aren't you supposed to offer to carry me back to my room at a time like this?!<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项1）</span>'''''Pleeeeeease, Commander? Carry me back, won't you?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Le Malin：</span><br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项2）</span>'''''O-of course, I don't mind if you hold onto me tightly...<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项2）</span>'''''B-but, won't it be a scandal if someone sees us like this?<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项2）</span>'''''Y-you know, a piggyback ride would suffice! Yes, that's fine!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Le Malin：</span><br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项3）</span>'''''I'm glad you're so understanding, Commander.<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项3）</span>'''''Ehehe~ Now, off we go~<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Le Malin：</span><br>
...Like hell I'd say something like that!<br>
There's no way we can let other people see us like this regardless of how you're carrying me!<br>
I need to come up with some kind of explanation, pronto...<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
You injured your leg during a commission, and need a lift over to the infirmary?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Le Malin：</span><br>
You're an absolute genius, Commander!<br>
It's a hundred times better than "I was too tired to walk back myself so I got the Commander to carry me back to my room!"<br>
Thanks for helping me out again, Commander!<br>
<br>
I couldn't help but notice how unusually quiet Le Malin was on the way back.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Le Malin：</span><br>
(I can't believe this only occurred to me just now, but...)<br>
(Doesn't this count as intimate physical contact with the Commander?!)<br>
(And, in a totally public place where everyone's staring, too!)<br>
(I'm so embarrassed that I probably have a weird look on my face...! I, I need to hide my face in Commander's back right now!)<br>
(Mmgh... Ahh... Commander's scent...)<br>
(Urrrrrk... I seriously hope nobody sees me like this! Please, I don't want anyone to see this at all!)<br>

4 The Office Needs Renovating<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Le Malin：</span><br>
Commander, don't you ever feel like your office is a bit too plain?<br>
<br>
One day, when I was minding my own business, Le Malin offered me this bit of unsolicited commentary.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
But, too plain, huh?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Le Malin：</span><br>
Indeed. It's all about the kind of atmosphere you surround yourself with when you work.<br>
No cola, no sweets. No game consoles, no comic books. And to top things off, you don't even have a fluffy bed or a super soft pillow to plunge your face into!<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
...We are talking about an OFFICE here, right?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Le Malin：</span><br>
I know it's an office, but it's also where I... *cough*, *cough*, where YOU rest between jobs.<br>
In any case, we need to do something about this bare-bones environment.<br>
Allow me to assist you with this.<br>
C'moooon, lemme do iiiiiit~<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
...You're really putting me on the spot here, but fine.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Le Malin：</span><br>
Wooohoo! Let's turn this place into a sanctuary where I can slack off in peace~<br>
Look forward to seeing what I have planned!<br>
<br>
When I arrived at the office the next morning, I was incredulous to find Le Malin there already, waiting for me ahead of time.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Le Malin：</span><br>
Good morning, Commander.<br>
Actually, I came three hours early to avoid cutting into work time.<br>
Heh heh heh. Aren't I awesome? I can even wake up early without being woken up by Le Triomphant.<br>
But, this is a worthy sacrifice for the sake of securing a future where we can slack off in peace!<br>
Now then, feast your eyes upon your new office, elegantly refurbished by yours truly!<br>
So, can you feel it? The moment you walk into the room, the spirit of the laze just wraps itself around you–<br>
Ahem. First, I've prepared a special space in the desk's drawer exclusively for storing sweets.<br>
Now, you'll never go hungry on those long, boring work days.<br>
Naturally, I've also added a refrigerator, pre-stocked with cola and ice cream.<br>
And where there's cola, you can't go without potato chips, a truly classic combination.<br>
Moving on– your file cabinets weren't being used efficiently, so I've filled them with layers of comic books and light novels, left open for convenient access.<br>
What you see before you has been carefully curated by none other than moi, in case you don't know where to start.<br>
And of course, most important of all is–<br>
A total repurposing of the big monitor in your office!<br>
Since I've started as your secretary ship, I've never once seen you use the darn thing!<br>
A travesty of the highest degree! Something this magnificent... should be used for games!<br>
Heehee... Seeing is believing, so let's get started right this instant!<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Yes, let's get started with work.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Le Malin：</span><br>
Tch... I thought I'd be able to get you caught up in my sales pitch, but you're one tough customer, huh?<br>
<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项1：Well, maybe we can spare a few minutes.</span>'''''<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项2：Let's play together AFTER we finish work.</span>'''''<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Le Malin：</span><br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项1）</span>'''''Really? You're the best, Commander!<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项1）</span>'''''Y'know that thing I keep hearing about a day's plan starting in the morning?<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项1）</span>'''''If you start off your day with a nice gaming session, I promise you'll be twice as productive! Definitely!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Le Malin：</span><br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项2）</span>'''''Really? You'd better not go back on your word then!<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项2）</span>'''''Alrighty, now I need to figure out which games I want to play while I'm working...<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项2）</span>'''''J-just kidding! I'll get everything done properly, okay?!<br>

<br>
5 Beating the Fatigue<br>
One day, when I returned to the office with Le Malin after a long morning of errands...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Le Malin：</span><br>
Bleh... Can't go on anymore... Can't move a muscle...<br>
<br>
The moment we stepped inside the room, Le Malin threw herself into the sofa's soft cushions.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Le Malin：</span><br>
What a long and painful battle... My stamina and motivation bars are completely drained...<br>
In other words, I can't get up at all right now, so don't even try giving me any more work...<br>
Otherwise... you'll see what I'm like when I'm running on empty...<br>
Blehhh... Everything's so heavy... I can't feel my arms or legs...<br>
I'm gonna be sore all over when I wake up tomorrow morning, aren't I? Urgh... Can I take a sick leave already...<br>
Well, whatever... We'll cross that bridge when we get there.<br>
But for now, it's nap time...<br>
<br>
Judging by how hard she had to work just to squeeze her words out, she didn't seem to be faking it today.<br>
<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项1：(Quietly massage her arms)</span>'''''<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项2：(Quietly massage her ankles)</span>'''''<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Le Malin：</span><br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项1）</span>'''''......<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项1）</span>'''''Ooh...<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项1）</span>'''''Warm... That feels real nice...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Le Malin：</span><br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项2）</span>'''''......<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项2）</span>'''''Ooh...<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项2）</span>'''''Warm... That feels real nice...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Le Malin：</span><br>
Huh? Commander, you're giving me a massage?<br>
Ermm, I don't think I should be imposing on you like this...<br>
But it does feel super nice...<br>
It feels so nice that... it's making me...<br>
Zzzzzzzzz...<br>
<br>
Whether she was taken in by the comfort of the massage, or overwhelmed by fatigue, Le Malin drifted off into slumber.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
......<br>
Now then, to get some more work done.<br>

6 Kindness Needs Repayment<br>
One day...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Le Malin：</span><br>
Aaaaand, work complete!!<br>
<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项1：Going to sleep already?</span>'''''<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项2：Want some sweets?</span>'''''<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项3：Down for some games?</span>'''''<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Le Malin：</span><br>
...Actually, I think I'll save the slacking for later.<br>
Commander, is there anything else I can help you with?<br>
I feel like I'm in tip-top shape right now. I can probably clean up any assignment you throw at me.<br>
<br>
I instinctively reach over to put my hand on her forehead. Nope, no fever.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Le Malin：</span><br>
What are you trying to do, Commander? I don't have a fever!<br>
Look, I know what you're thinking, but even I can be motivated at times, okay?<br>
<br>
I decided to test that hypothesis and gave her a healthy chunk of my workload.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Le Malin：</span><br>
Ugh... I dunno about this much...<br>
But, I'm not gonna go back on my word. I'll take care of this in no time!<br>
<br>
Woah. She's actually doing it.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Le Malin：</span><br>
Commander, would you like some tea that I brewed myself?<br>
<br>
In stark contrast to her usual self, she finished all the work assigned to her in one sitting, and even made me tea.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Woah, it's good!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Le Malin：</span><br>
Heheh, looks like I'm a natural at this! Got it down on my first try!<br>
*yaaaaaaawn*...<br>
<br>
Looks like your fatigue bar has hit its limit, huh?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Le Malin：</span><br>
Th-that's not true at all!<br>
Commander, if you don't mind, could I give you a massage?<br>
<br>
I instinctively reach over to put my hand on her forehead. ...Nope, still no fever.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Le Malin：</span><br>
I already told you before, I'm perfectly fine!<br>
Come on, go lie down over there. I don't have a whole lot of experience doing this stuff, so let me know if it hurts.<br>
*yaaaaaawn*... So tired...<br>
<br>
After ten minutes of massaging me around with her tiny hands, Le Malin clearly had run out of juice.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Le Malin：</span><br>
I never thought... that returning a favor would be so exhausting...<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Returning a favor?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Le Malin：</span><br>
When I accidentally fell asleep the other day, you went ahead and took care of all the work without saying anything.<br>
So, I thought I'd try to make it up to you...<br>
Work aside, I never knew that giving a massage could be so tiresome...<br>
Commander, how are you able to do stuff like this for everyone?<br>
<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项1：Because I like seeing everyone smile.</span>'''''<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项2：Because being around you is all the motivation I need.</span>'''''<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Le Malin：</span><br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项1）</span>'''''Is that so...<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项1）</span>'''''(Does that mean... that seeing my smile gives the Commander energy?)<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Le Malin：</span><br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项2）</span>'''''Is that so...<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项2）</span>'''''(I see... Does that mean, the Commander feels better just from having me around?)<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Le Malin：</span><br>
(Wait, what am I thinking right now?!)<br>
(At this rate, I'm going to get super attached!)<br>
(Actually... maybe that isn't entirely a bad thing...)<br>
(Yeah... I mean, I'm having a good time, and the Commander seems to enjoy having me around...)<br>
(So that's what's going on... Ehehe...)<br>
<br>
The weary Le Malin smiled sweetly, and then–<br>
She sank into the soft sofa and fell asleep.<br>

7 The Protector's Wish<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Le Malin：</span><br>
All done with today's work! You know what that means–<br>
Ice cream time~♪<br>
<br>
Le Malin, who had finished her work ahead of time, grabbed two portions of soft-serve ice cream from the freezer and plopped down in my lap as usual.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Le Malin：</span><br>
Hmm? Commander, these two tickets on your desk are...<br>
Is that the thing Akashi tried to force onto me this morning?<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
It seems like the port's amusement park facilities have been completed.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Le Malin：</span><br>
Sounds nice. Not exactly my cup of tea though.<br>
You spend half the time running around between attractions and the other half waiting in line. Surely that's not your idea of fun, is it?<br>
L'Indomptable might be more into that kind of stuff, but it's just not for me.<br>
<br>
Apparently, she had some pretty unfortunate experiences with amusement parks in the past.<br>
I went out of my way to get these tickets, but maybe it would be better to pass them on to someone else.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Le Malin：</span><br>
So what's the plan? Are you gonna give them to someone else?<br>
(Wait a second... Does that mean... that the Commander's going to invite some other girl?!)<br>
(Together with the Commander... alone in a haunted house, zipping around in a roller coaster, dropping from a tower, getting thrown around by the Screamin' Swing, getting lost in the Mirror Maze...)<br>
(And then, getting cozy with each other when they get to the top of the Ferris wheel...)<br>
(Nonononononononono! I can't afford to pass up this opportunity!)<br>
Ahem! Now as I was about to say... I happen to be in a particularly good mood because of this ice cream, so I would be more than glad to wait in line!<br>
Now that I think about it, it would be quite troublesome to find someone to hand this ticket to, so I would not mind accompanying you to the amusement park!<br>
<br>
And so, that's how the two of us ended up in the port's brand new amusement park.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Le Malin：</span><br>
Are we going on the merry-go-round first? I was expecting something more exciting like a roller coaster though...<br>
Well, if it doesn't matter, then you lead the way!<br>
<br>
Next up was the teacup bumper cars...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Le Malin：</span><br>
Do I think the slow-paced attractions are boring? Erm, not really.<br>
If anything, they're more my style.<br>
<br>
And then, the pirate ship cruise...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Le Malin：</span><br>
Th-th-things are starting to get a bit more exciting now, aren't they?<br>
B-but, who's ever heard of a shipgirl being scared of a pirate ship?<br>
<br>
Le Malin and I went on attraction after attraction.<br>
She kept complaining about how tired she was, but she clearly was having a lot of fun.<br>
Well, in the end, this was basically a private amusement park for the port's use.<br>
Neither the transportation nor the lines were really an issue.<br>
...But considering Le Malin's physical state, maybe it was better to wrap it up for the day.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Le Malin：</span><br>
Oh right, Commander... How about finishing our trip with a Ferris wheel ride?<br>
<br>
As the cabin started to rise higher into the air, Le Malin, who had been sitting at my side, suddenly leaned into me.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Le Malin：</span><br>
You know, Commander, I've been thinking about this for a long time.<br>
The old me would've never brought this up, because it's so much less of a headache to just run away and avoid the issue...<br>
But now, every day when I finish work, I always feel myself wanting to get these words off my chest...<br>
Commander, there are some times... when I feel super motivated just by being by your side.<br>
Of course, there are also lots of times when I want to slack off... But you always let me do just that, without judging me.<br>
So, umm, basically...<br>
Commander, umm, I'd like you to be with me forever...<br>
And in return, I swear to offer you the protection of my sword, as well as my eternal love!<br>
Umm... how does that sound?<br>
<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项1：I accept your trade offer.</span>'''''<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项2：Yes, I'd love to be with you.</span>'''''<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Le Malin：</span><br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项1）</span>'''''Th-thank you so much, Commander!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Le Malin：</span><br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项2）</span>'''''Commander... That's right! Here's to our future where we can slack off together as much as we want!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Le Malin：</span><br>
Phew... Now that I've said what I've always wanted to say...<br>
Do you mind if I ask you a bit of a selfish question, since we're still riding the Ferris wheel and whatnot?<br>
Commander, umm, if you don't mind...<br>
<br>
With those words, Le Malin leaned in a little closer.<br>
And that brief, precious moment in the Ferris wheel became a secret, just between the two of us.<br>
