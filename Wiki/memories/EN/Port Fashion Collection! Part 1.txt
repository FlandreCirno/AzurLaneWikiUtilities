"Port Fashion Collection!"<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Gridley：</span><br>
"Full of this season's best hits!"<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Alfredo Oriani：</span><br>
"Which styles are all the rage now?"<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Everyone：</span><br>
"Don't miss it!"<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
...Port fashion trends?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Gridley：</span><br>
Yep! The three of us worked on this independent magazine together!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Aoba：</span><br>
Yeah~ We wanted to show off the hottest fashion around the port.<br>
We include other content to suit the season, too~<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Alfredo Oriani：</span><br>
Aoba gathers intel, Gridley snaps pics, and we all handle the writing together!<br>
Of course, our readers and models are all the people of the port!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Gridley：</span><br>
We might make a few appearances in the magazine ourselves, too...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Aoba：</span><br>
Right now, we're thinking of releasing once per month.<br>
But if it sells well, we aren't against upping the pace.<br>
Check it out, Commander.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Gridley：</span><br>
I think it'll help you to know the trends around port, too!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Alfredo Oriani：</span><br>
Heheh, maybe you'll learn a thing or two about a shipgirl you've had your eye on...<br>
Now, let these fashion trends roll over the port like a hurricane!<br>

2 Splashing, Merrymaking, Love<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Hatsuzuki：</span><br>
Heehee, you're finally here, Commander!<br>
You don't know how looooong I've been waiting for you.<br>
As punishment for making me wait... You're gonna spend time with me all day!♪<br>
On this perfect, cloudless day, Hatsuzuki brought me to the waterpark on a whim.<br>
Hey, by the way, what do you think about my swimsuit?<br>
Tadaaa! I got it just for today. Do you like it?♪<br>
<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项1："Very cute!"</span>'''''<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项2："I like you more and more."</span>'''''<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Hatsuzuki：</span><br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项1）</span>'''''Heehee♪ Riiight?♪<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项1）</span>'''''Wakatsuki said it was "too mature," but I'm glad I picked it!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Hatsuzuki：</span><br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项2）</span>'''''Wh-wha...<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项2）</span>'''''(I didn't think the Commander would be this direct...!)<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项2）</span>'''''A-ahem! O-of course, you're obsessed with me♪ Obviously!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Hatsuzuki：</span><br>
Hey... Commander, what's got you blushing so much?<br>
Someone feeling shy?<br>
Heehee♪ Was my new swimsuit too much for you to take in?<br>
Well, since you like it so much, snap a few more pictures of me!<br>
If you get a cute one, make it your lock screen background! Oh, and you'll need one each for all of your other devices♪<br>
Hatsuzuki did her best to pose like a model.<br>
So? Am I cute, or what?<br>
If you want to request any poses, I'm happy to oblige!<br>
I'm very flexible, so I can even do... Ack!<br>
Hatsuzuki lost her balance, but I managed to catch her just in time.<br>
(Whoa, whoa, whoa!)<br>
(O-our hands are touching! No, not just our hands... We're pressed up against each other!)<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Are you okay, Hatsuzuki?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Hatsuzuki：</span><br>
I...<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Yes?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Hatsuzuki：</span><br>
I may be incompetent, but I hope you'll take care of me forever, Commander!<br>

3 Shimmering Beauty<br>
On one clear day, the scorching-hot sunlight was reflected by the sea like a mirror.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Owari：</span><br>
Commander, check me out! Tada! Like this special surprise I planned for you?<br>
<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项1："Would the surprise be that swimsuit?"</span>'''''<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项2："I'm guessing the surprise is the water bed?"</span>'''''<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Owari：</span><br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项1）</span>'''''Bzzt, wrong! But you thought it was the surprise, huh? Heheh, sick!♪<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项1）</span>'''''Anyway, the real surprise is this water bed!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Owari：</span><br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项2）</span>'''''Good job, Commander! Man, you're smart.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Owari：</span><br>
Y'see, I made it all on my own.<br>
But that was hard, so I did have Suruga and Kii help me out, but still!<br>
What's that? That means I didn't make it "all on my own"?<br>
Pssh, details! Who cares about 'em?<br>
Anyway, Commander, come join me and experience it for yourself!♪<br>
It's like you're really ridin' on the waves. Relaxin', refreshin', this water bed does it all!<br>
Oh, yeah. I made some salad with veggies I picked earlier.<br>
Fresh AND nutritious~ It's all full of my love, too~<br>
You and I are like BFFs, so I bet you'll be able to taste it!<br>
Ahaha, hey, you don't have to eat it that fast! Nobody's gonna take it from you.<br>
I'll make more if we run out, so take your time.<br>
Huh? Why'd I do all this for you?<br>
I mean, you and I are like two peas in a pod.<br>
It's normal to want to make your loved ones happy, yeah?<br>
I'm not all that smart, so thinkin' about it doesn't help me much, but...<br>
I realized I don't NEED to think when I'm around you, Commander.<br>
So I'm gonna follow my instinct!<br>
Hah!<br>
Huggies! Yeah, this is the best way for me to relax♪<br>
Now, we're good and full. Ready for nap time?<br>
Let's take a nice nap together while I hold you in my arms, Commander!<br>

Port Fashion Collection! Part 1<br>
<br>
4 Blossoming Melody<br>
As I approached the room, I heard a Sakura Empire instrument's melody, interspersed with sighs.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Kashino：</span><br>
I just can't make it work... *sigh*...<br>
Oh? Commander? Why are you here...?<br>
Because you heard my music...?<br>
Urk... I'm sorry. You shouldn't have to hear such unskilled play...<br>
But it's odd.<br>
I'm trying to play the way I learned, but for some reason, I can't stop playing off-tune...<br>
With a light grunt, Kashino struggled to pick up her instrument again.<br>
Her fingering and posture didn't seem especially wrong, so there was only one possibility.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
I think a certain something might be affecting the strings.<br>
<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项1："Play it again, please."</span>'''''<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Kashino：</span><br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项1）</span>'''''Hm? Do you think you can figure out what I'm getting wrong? Thank you!<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项1）</span>'''''Umm, wait just a second...!<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项1）</span>'''''Kashino righted her posture, with much difficulty, and began playing a tune.<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项1）</span>'''''Once it was over...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Kashino：</span><br>
Oddly, I think I'm playing better now that you're watching me!<br>
Hmm, but it's still a little off... Why could that be?<br>
Commander, um, can you offer any advice...?<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
The thing is...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Kashino：</span><br>
Am I simply not skilled enough? Have I not practiced enough?<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
I don't think that's the problem.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Kashino：</span><br>
Oh? Then...?<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Try playing it again, but this time... Hold it a little further away from you.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Kashino：</span><br>
Further away? Like this? I'll try!<br>
...Hwuh?<br>
I-I don't know why, but it's a lot better now!<br>
Incredible, Commander!<br>
B-but it is harder to play like this...<br>
Is there no way to solve this problem?<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Um...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Kashino：</span><br>
I looked at the perplexed Kashino, and then at the instrument she struggled to hold.<br>
As long as she didn't move the two "obstacles" between her and the instrument, she'd continue to struggle.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
I think you may have no other options.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Kashino：</span><br>
Aww... C-Commander?<br>
Help meee!<br>

<br>
5 The Unseen Katana<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Hakuryuu：</span><br>
Aaaah?! Wh-where did my katana go...?!<br>
The Commander will be here any minute now! Why can't I find it?!<br>
(Even though I'm the one who hid it...!)<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
...Hakuryuu?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Hakuryuu：</span><br>
Whoa?!<br>
Ouch... Commander?! Wh-why are you here so early...?<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
What's the matter? You look panicked.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Hakuryuu：</span><br>
Commandeeer! I can't... I can't find my katana...<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
That is a problem, to be sure.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Hakuryuu：</span><br>
I was the one who hid it, but I forgot where I put it...<br>
I can't practice my instrument without it... *sniffle*...<br>
Hakuryuu sobbed as she scooted over and gave me room to sit.<br>
Given her usual attitude, I could never have imagined her being so helpless.<br>
(Either way, this won't do. I should help her look for it.)<br>
We searched her room from top to bottom, but we couldn't find her katana anywhere.<br>
(Then all that's left is...)<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Maybe...<br>
<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项1："Could it be in your instrument?"</span>'''''<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项2："Is it in your clothes?"</span>'''''<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Hakuryuu：</span><br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项1）</span>'''''(I have heard masters of swordplay sometimes hide their weapons in other things.)<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项1）</span>'''''G-good idea!<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项1）</span>'''''Yeah! I'll take a look...!<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项1）</span>'''''Hakuryuu gently put her fingers on the instrument, as if trying to sense something within.<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项1）</span>'''''Commander, can you help me, please? Like here... Oh, and here...<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项1）</span>'''''Hm? ...There it is!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Hakuryuu：</span><br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项2）</span>'''''(Maybe today's katana is more of a wakizashi, or a knife, or...)<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项2）</span>'''''Eep?! C-Commander?! What are you doing?!<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项2）</span>'''''I'm going to lose balance... Aah?!<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项2）</span>'''''Oooh... Commander, b-be gentle...<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项2）</span>'''''...Hmm? Is that...?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Hakuryuu：</span><br>
Wait a second. Are you trying to take advantage of my moment of weakness?!<br>
Despite how much she was invading my personal space, Hakuryuu had a sudden change of heart and seized my hand.<br>
She wasn't very forceful, though, for some reason.<br>
A-anyway! I've found my katana, so back off!<br>
You've occupied my seat for long enough! Go take your seat in the audience!<br>
Hmph. I was GOING to offer to let you watch me practice, but you've just disappointed me.<br>
What? Where was I hiding my katana?<br>
You felt it, did you not?<br>
(All I felt was something soft. I didn't find anything like a katana...)<br>
Th-then I won't tell you!<br>
Aaaagh! I've had enough of this conversation!<br>
I'm going to practice! Right now!<br>
Hakuryuu suddenly began playing loud music to distract herself from what just happened.<br>
Unfortunately, it seemed the mystery of where she'd hidden her katana would remain a mystery to me.<br>
