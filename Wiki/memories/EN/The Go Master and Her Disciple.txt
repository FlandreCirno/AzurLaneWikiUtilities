1 Tea and Coffee<br>
At the office, in the dead of night...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">???：</span><br>
M-my heart is racing, I must admit. I wondered why you'd call me to the office this late at night...<br>
I mean, you specifically chose this place, bathed in silence and beautiful moonlight, over the bustling city district...<br>
Um... Would you mind waiting a little longer? I need time to calm my beating heart, and I fear I can't live up to your hopes until then. Please give me a moment...<br>
<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项1：......</span>'''''<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项2：I'm not going to do anything weird.</span>'''''<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">???：</span><br>
M-my apologies! I am a disgrace, I know!<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Sorry about calling you in this late. I just wanted to ask you something.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">???：</span><br>
I see... I will do everything I can to help.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Thanks. I appreciate it.<br>
<br>
It's noon of the next day. I finish up my morning tasks and head back to my office.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Chen Hai：</span><br>
Welcome back, Commander. Outstanding work as always.<br>
You must be feeling tired. May I propose taking a break to go outside for a while?<br>
Before you ask, don't worry. I finished all my secretary work while you were away.<br>
<br>
As she speaks, Chen Hai places a coffee mug and a beautifully bound book on the table.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
You had coffee today instead of tea? And you dived into a book rather than play Go?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Chen Hai：</span><br>
Oh, is that your image of me? A woman who only drinks tea and plays Go?<br>
<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项1：(Nod.)</span>'''''<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项2：......</span>'''''<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Chen Hai：</span><br>
I don't blame you for thinking that. All Empery girls love tea, and I, especially so.<br>
Sometimes, though, a cup of coffee is what I crave. And sometimes, I try to show a different side of me to hopefully catch your eye.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Aha, I see.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Chen Hai：</span><br>
It's too soon for ahas and I see's. How can you be sure I don't have a different goal in mind? For instance, trying to see into people's minds by understanding them through what they eat.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
I... guess?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Chen Hai：</span><br>
Which do you think it is, hmm? Am I trying new things, or trying to read people? Try to guess, Commander.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
(Chen Hai is one step ahead of me again... No, you know what? I'm not letting her have the pleasure this time!)<br>
(I forwent sleep yesterday to hone my skills! Time to show her!)<br>
Say, are you free? I've learned a "move" or two and I was hoping you could give me some guidance.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Chen Hai：</span><br>
Of course I can. What kind of "moves" are we talking about, though?<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
You'll see soon enough.<br>

2 Guidance<br>
CLICK...<br>
Chen Hai shoots me a look of slight confusion as I lock the door to the office.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Chen Hai：</span><br>
Hang on, why did you lock the door? By "guidance" did you mean...?<br>
Heehee, now I see. "Surprise the enemy and strike at their weak point." It seems you know this well.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
(I think she's misreading the mood... which may be to my advantage. What's most important is that I find "it" before she does.)<br>
Give me a second. I need to get "it" out before we go any further.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Chen Hai：</span><br>
Take your time. I'm not going anywhere.<br>
<br>
She picks up her cup of coffee like it's the most natural thing ever. Looking closer, I can see it – and her hand – is shaking slightly. She's nervous.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Chen Hai：</span><br>
Now I'm actually quite excited to see what "moves" you've learned, Commander.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
(Weird. Where is it? I whipped it out just last night...)<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Chen Hai：</span><br>
I think have a pretty good guess as to what this is about. I can see why you'd want some guidance...<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
(Maybe I left it back there...)<br>
Did you say something? Never mind, I've almost got it.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Chen Hai：</span><br>
...Now I see. No wonder something felt off.<br>
I gave you a massage a while ago to help you relax, and I was entirely in control back then...<br>
But now, you want to take the lead. I don't think... I could handle that...<br>
Pick your battles... I have to retreat and come back better prepared...<br>
C-Commander! I just remembered something I have to–<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
I found it!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Chen Hai：</span><br>
Y-you "found" it? Ahaha... Wonderful. That's... great.<br>
...Oh. A Go board?<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Yeah. I've learned some new moves and wanted to refine my skills further.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Chen Hai：</span><br>
So THAT'S what this was about...<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
You good? You look kind of pale.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Chen Hai：</span><br>
Oh, I'm fine. In fact, I feel great.<br>
I'm ready if you are. Let's play. Heehee.<br>

3 Intensive Training<br>
Five hours later, in the office...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Chen Hai：</span><br>
Your weakness is that you play too passively. Hedging your bets is perhaps not the best strategy in Go.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Dammit... You win again.<br>
I overestimated myself. Clearly, I'm still a long way off from beating you.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Chen Hai：</span><br>
You needn't put yourself down. If anything, I'm amazed at how quickly you've improved. Keep at it, and I'm certain victory will be yours one day.<br>
Having said that, I noticed some flaws in these new moves you've learned.<br>
You'll want to patch those up, and I could show you how to...<br>
Oh, apologies, that's presumptuous of me to say. I haven't even asked if you want more guidance in the first place.<br>
<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项1：Yes, please!</span>'''''<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项2：Show me how it's done, Master Chen Hai!</span>'''''<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Chen Hai：</span><br>
Heehee. A firm answer is what I like to hear.<br>
However, please bear in mind that you'll have to set your mind to this and follow my instructions to a T.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Fine by me!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Chen Hai：</span><br>
Is that determination in your voice? Then get ready for your intensive training.<br>
With a small side of punishment for making my heart throb earlier...<br>

<br>
4 The Four Arts of Go - 1<br>
I accompany Chen Hai to the swimming pool. Someone has added a small artificial waterfall to the pool. When and why, I don't know.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Uh... Are we going to play Go out here?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Chen Hai：</span><br>
No, of course not. You're going to meditate under the waterfall. I take it the concept is familiar to you.<br>
You're to sit there and let the cold water whip your head and body.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
I've obviously heard about it before, I just don't see what it has to do with Go.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Chen Hai：</span><br>
It is the first of the Four Arts of Go that I've summarized – "be bold, fear nothing."<br>
When you play with me, inhibition prevents you from reaching a state of flow, does it not?<br>
<br>
She comes within whispering range. Only a small nudge away, she gives off a cool fragrance that tickles me.<br>
It's too much for anyone to stay calm under. My composure crumbles.<br>
She senses the restlessness in my heart and lets out a small giggle into my ear.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Chen Hai：</span><br>
Heehee. There you have it. Your first lesson will be learning to stay calm in the face of anything.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Alright. Then what exactly do I have to do?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Chen Hai：</span><br>
First of all, I'd like to help take off your clothes.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Whoa, WHAT?!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Chen Hai：</span><br>
No need to be so alarmed. I'm only referring to your coat. What did you think I meant?<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Uh, nothing. Go ahead.<br>
<br>
She points me to under the waterfall. I sit down in the water, most of my clothes still on.<br>
The water doesn't feel as cold as I expected it to. Hell, it's closer to a warm shower than anything else.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Chen Hai：</span><br>
I was never going to make you train in a truly grueling environment. It would be for nothing if you got hypothermia or somesuch.<br>
Let the warm water wash over you. Now pull your thoughts inward and start meditating.<br>
<br>
Following her instructions, I close my eyes.<br>
My thoughts sink into a deep, dark ocean.<br>
As my mind drifts, a glowing red diamond appears. Then another, and yet another...<br>
Then, a cat manifests out of thin air. It starts chasing after the red diamonds while singing something...<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
(...Has Akashi snuck her way into my mind palace?)<br>
<br>
Something tells me that there will be more of these perplexing visions inside my mind...<br>
POKE...<br>
Chen Hai nudges my nose with one of her fingers, bringing me back to reality.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Chen Hai：</span><br>
You went into some kind of trance, didn't you?<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Guess so...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Chen Hai：</span><br>
Heehee. It's alright. Just follow my instructions next time.<br>
First, hold my hand. Concentrate your mind on only the sensation in your hand, then breathe steadily.<br>
Let's try again.<br>

5 The Four Arts of Go - 2<br>
Chen Hai helped me dry my body off, after which I changed out of my wet clothes. We then returned to the office together.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Thanks for helping me out.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Chen Hai：</span><br>
My pleasure. Now, how do you feel after that meditation exercise?<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Not bad. Feels like it really cleared my mind.<br>
Also, what about your clothes? They got pretty wet, too. Shouldn't you get changed?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Chen Hai：</span><br>
I'm fine, but thank you. I'm a shipgirl; getting a little wet all but comes with the title.<br>
So, you've finished your first lesson. Are you ready to move on to the next?<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Bring it on!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Chen Hai：</span><br>
Splendid. Then let's get started on the second art.<br>
As they say, "Even in a game of Go, etiquette and morals are king."<br>
This time, I shall teach you the etiquette of Go as well as the fundamental tactics.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
I'm all ears, ma'am.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Chen Hai：</span><br>
Let us start with what is known as the fist-and-palm salute.<br>
Nowadays, it's no big deal if you aren't quite THAT formal, but both players should at least bow or give each other a nod to show respect before the match starts.<br>
It is an indication that what follows is private time for both players. After that is done, then we may begin.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
I see.<br>
<br>
I give her a bow, and she does the same.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
......<br>
<br>
Her wet clothes cling to her skin more tightly than usual, making the curves of her body just that much more pronounced.<br>
Droplets seem to drip from her black hair and beautiful, crow-feather-like eyelashes. She is enthralling in a special way.<br>
This is a problem, because I don't know where to look without being disrespectful.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
(Should I just bite the bullet and tell her to quickly get changed?)<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Chen Hai：</span><br>
Hm? Is there something you're wondering, Commander?<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
I've got a spare towel lying around. You should dry and wrap yourself up. Don't want you to catch a cold, right?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Chen Hai：</span><br>
I appreciate your concern, but I assure you, I'm fine.<br>
Let's continue with the etiquette lesson. The next thing you should know about is a practice called "nigiri," or "the grab."<br>
The senior player takes a handful of white pieces and the other player tries to guess if they're holding an odd or even number. The winner decides who goes first.<br>
Since I'm the senior player in this case, you'll be the guesser.<br>
She grabs a fistful of white pieces and places her closed hand on the board.<br>
Because you're still learning the ropes, I'll give you a small handicap.<br>
You may place your hand on mine to try to determine how many I have.<br>

<br>
6 The Four Arts of Go - 3<br>
Several hours have passed. With Chen Hai's patient guidance, I finally complete my crash course on Go etiquette.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Chen Hai：</span><br>
That should be it... Say, Commander, does your back hurt after sitting for so long? I could give you a massage, if you'd like.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
I'm good, thanks. The only thing I feel is all this new Go knowledge filling my head.<br>
Hell, I don't even want a break. What I want is to find an opponent and play a match.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Chen Hai：</span><br>
Heehee. Yes, as they say, "strike while the iron is hot." We should put your skills to the test.<br>
Let's see... A worthy opponent...<br>
Chi An is a bit out of your league at the moment. It should be someone more around your current level.<br>
Actually, that reminds me... You said you learned new tricks yesterday. Who was it that taught you them?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Hai Tien：</span><br>
Commander, I'm ready to resume where we–<br>
<br>
Suddenly, Hai Tien opens the door to the office.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Hai Tien：</span><br>
Ch-Chen Hai?!<br>
And Commander, you're...<br>
Both your clothes are a mess... Wh-what unspeakable things have you been up to?!<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
It's a long story, but trust me when I say that we've just been playing Go.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Hai Tien：</span><br>
"Go," you say... You've only been playing Go, and yet you look like this?<br>
You expect me to believe you threw your clothes off in private and neither of you acted upon your urges?!<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Whoa, hang on! What is that last part supposed to mean?!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Chen Hai：</span><br>
...So it's Hai Tien who taught you those tricks, I assume.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Correct.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Chen Hai：</span><br>
I see. And Hai Tien, you've not revealed ALL your tricks, have you?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Hai Tien：</span><br>
No... I was going to take my time teaching them.<br>
Like how a serialized story keeps you coming back for more. I thought it would be more interesting that way.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Chen Hai：</span><br>
An interesting scheme.<br>
But I'll bet you didn't know the Commander went through a lot of trouble because of your "keep 'em on the hook" attitude.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Hai Tien：</span><br>
F-for that, I'm sorry...<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
I wouldn't call it "trouble." Besides, I ASKED you for help.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Chen Hai：</span><br>
While I am moved by how forgiving you are, your forgiveness will not get Hai Tien off the hook. She needs to learn from her bad behavior.<br>
Oh, I know. Why don't you and her play each other? She can teach you more of those "tricks" of hers, and you can practice what you've learned.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Hai Tien：</span><br>
Y-yes, ma'am! Commander, I will play sincerely with you to atone for my mistakes.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Chen Hai：</span><br>
Heehee. I'll be watching you from the sidelines, as the Commander's one and only Go teacher.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
......<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Chen Hai：</span><br>
(Shhh...)<br>
<br>
Just as I'm about to say something, Chen Hai puts a finger to her lips, gesturing for me to hold my tongue.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
(Maybe I'm imagining it, but it feels like Chen Hai's smile to Hai Tien was even more mysterious than usual.)<br>

7 The Four Arts of Go - 4<br>
I gave the match my absolute best, but still I lost to Hai Tien in just short of two hours.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Hai Tien：</span><br>
I'm really sorry, Commander. I wasn't trying to win, and yet...<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
You don't have to apologize. One day, the game will be mine.<br>
Plus, now I know what our difference in skill level is.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Chen Hai：</span><br>
Heehee. Even though you lost in the end, it was quite an interesting match.<br>
Now it's time you and I reviewed your mistakes.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Hai Tien：</span><br>
I-if you're doing a review, I'd like to help!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Chen Hai：</span><br>
...That's very kind of you, but don't you have deadlines?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Hai Tien：</span><br>
Yes, but I still have time to spare. It sounds a bit like you want to keep the Commander all to yourself...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Chen Hai：</span><br>
Ah, I just remembered, you finished a new chapter. You don't mind if the Commander and I read it before our review, do you?<br>
Here it is. Your love story about–<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Hai Tien：</span><br>
AHEM!<br>
Something urgent just came up! Excuse me, I'd better go!<br>
<br>
Hai Tien leaves the office in a real hurry, and then, it's just me and Chen Hai again.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Chen Hai：</span><br>
You look disappointed. Did you not want her to leave?<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Partly, yeah... It's also that I feel like I'm improving so slowly.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Chen Hai：</span><br>
Really? I didn't think you'd take Go this seriously.<br>
Now that I think about it, you did put up with my teasing and stuck with my training course to the very end.<br>
You were so earnest... Now I feel guilty over being so mean-spirited to you.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Mean-spirited? What, are you saying all this training was just you teasing me?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Chen Hai：</span><br>
Not entirely. Sometimes it was, but the things I taught you should also make you a better player.<br>
No one becomes a Go champion overnight. Even if Hai Tien and I taught you everything we knew right now, there's no way you could internalize it all at once.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
I guess so. That doesn't change the fact that I really want to get good, though.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Chen Hai：</span><br>
Then let me ask you this – what suddenly made you so passionate about this game?<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
How do I put it... When I saw you take command of the fleet, I just felt captivated by how calm and cool you looked when giving orders.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Chen Hai：</span><br>
Huh? What do you mean?<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
I know you weren't simply born that captivating. You got to this point not with talent, but with an extraordinary amount of effort.<br>
Then, a few days ago, I read a book that said, "Learning Go can not only make you smarter, but also make you a better tactician."<br>
So I started studying the game so I could get to know you better. I even asked Hai Tien to teach me what she knew so I could surprise you.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Chen Hai：</span><br>
Well... you DID surprise me, but why would you...<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Because I am your Commander.<br>
That's why I want to learn more about you. Why I want to become a better person, a more reliable person.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Chen Hai：</span><br>
Goodness... Hearing you say that would touch the heart of even the most cold and indifferent among us.<br>
Heehee. Thank you for telling me this, Commander.<br>
It amazes me that you're deploying such clever strategies when you're still only a novice.<br>
I'll be honest with you. Your move just now completely caught me by surprise.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
You're not just messing with me, are you?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Chen Hai：</span><br>
Of course not. It's an honor to be spending time with you. Teaching you things like this... is something I actually quite look forward to.<br>
<br>
She takes my hand and begins slowly leading me into another room.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Chen Hai：</span><br>
Come along. Our intensive course isn't over yet.<br>
There is still the last of the four arts which I have yet to teach you about.<br>
Please stay with me until the very end, Commander.<br>
