<br>
Am I... dreaming?<br>
Jean Bart：<br>
Flagship of the Vichya Dominion, Jean Bart, calls for the attention of the fleet!<br>
Casablanca has fallen! Now, the pagans will surely bare their fangs at the heart of our motherland.<br>
The Iron Blood and the Sardegna Empire have banded together to tear at our bodies and partake of our blood.<br>
Even our leaders seek the destruction of the Vichya Dominion!<br>
Yes, the same was true of that fateful night at Mers-el-Kébir...<br>
Though Dunkerque and the others showed no signs of hostility...<br>
The craven attack by the Azur Lane told me everything that I needed to know!<br>
These cowardly hypocrites shall never see us bow our heads in obeisance!<br>
These beasts seek to sever the lifeblood of the Vichya Dominion... and they surround us in great numbers. But we shall never become their playthings!<br>
In the name of freedom, hear my final order! All ships, you are to sink yourselves!<br>
<br>
I was defeated. For the sake of whatever pride we had left, I ordered my friends to sink themselves.<br>
Battleship Jean Bart sank at Casablanca on that day... That should have been the case.<br>
Yet, I am conscious, and something feels wrong.<br>
My consciousness, which should have returned to nothingness, still continues to "exist" in some way.<br>
So, is this heaven, or is this hell? Perhaps that is the wrong question.<br>
As a ship, perhaps another destination awaits me...<br>
At least I can confidently say this infinite black void all around me is nothing like what's described in the Iris Orthodoxy.<br>
Jean Bart：<br>
"...All that comes into being must also cease to be. Grieve not over the passage of life, for that is the truth of the providence of rebirth."<br>
"One day, I will wake up as a different me."<br>
"When that day comes, I still wish to praise God. For giving me life in such a wonderful country."<br>
"Thank you for bestowing upon me a life of happiness,"<br>
"And thank you for welcoming me into the seas of Heaven."<br>
"I pray that this glory will be passed down to all who walk the path of the Iris after me."<br>
<br>
Within the darkness of the void, only my consciousness offers any illumination... Strangely, when I try to call out, a voice echoes back to me.<br>
However, I am forced to accept that even as a ship, I am scarcely different from any other mortal being.<br>
The Vichya Dominion... Iris Libre... and my sister, Richelieu...<br>
...All the things that I hold dear, now so distant from me.<br>
...If only I could meet everyone again...<br>
？？？：<br>
Vitals stable. D'accord. You should be regaining your five senses soon enough.<br>
<br>
...That voice... Who are you...?<br>
？？？：<br>
Who I am is of little importance. What matters is you, Jean Bart.<br>
<br>
What matters... is me...?<br>
？？？：<br>
Indeed. Now that you're coming to your senses, shall I explain the situation to you?<br>
Now think, where do you last remember yourself?<br>
<br>
Casablanca... Yeah, that should be the place where I sank.<br>
？？？：<br>
That's right. You ordered the fleet to preserve the Vichya's autonomy, for everyone to sink themselves so that they would not become pawns of the Iron Blood or the Royal Navy.<br>
<br>
Yeah, I remember that clearly...<br>
？？？：<br>
But your decision was nothing but an escape. Your sinking cannot change the cowardice of the Senate, the Royal Navy's treachery, or the fracturing of the Iris Orthodoxy.<br>
However, one can say that your efforts were brave, comical, or tragic. Future generations are sure to reflect upon it in different ways.<br>
But you already knew that, didn't you? Your history... Even knowing that, you'd make the same choice, wouldn't you?<br>
The life of Jean Bart, the battleship, ended at Casablanca. But Jean Bart, the person, has yet to take the first step of her new life...<br>
<br>
...You can close the channel now.<br>
...What a load of crap. Le Terrible...<br>
Now I remember it clearly. I tried to sink myself back then, but I was rescued.<br>
Which I guess means that I'm awaiting my recovery while listening to your blathering... right?<br>
？？？：<br>
I'm pleased to see that you're as sharp as ever, Miss Jean Bart.<br>
I too was in the same situation, but I recovered just earlier. Algérie entrusted me to take care of you.<br>
Jean Bart, do you truly believe that you are in the clutches of death?<br>
<br>
...Yes, that is what I chose. I know that my body rests at the bottom of the ocean, and only my consciousness has wandered here. There is no doubt that I have crossed to the other side.<br>
？？？：<br>
But as a ship... is it necessarily finality that awaits you on the other side?<br>
<br>
...What do you mean?<br>
？？？：<br>
Nothing in particular, Miss Jean Bart.<br>
Reflect upon everything you've left unfinished. Reflect upon all the anger you've yet to vent.<br>
Reflect upon your faith, and upon the power that belongs to you.<br>
Now arise, my "Sleeping Beauty." The wondrous Iris skies await you.<br>
<br>
"Lift your head to the heavens, and look closely at the clouds that rise high over you."<br>
"How much does each mistake you make cost you in the eyes of God?"<br>
"What would it mean to repeatedly turn your back against God?"<br>
"Even if your life is just, what would God grant upon you?" <br>
"And what would God receive from your two hands?"<br>
Cast your eyes skybound and gaze at your insignificance.<br>
Alas, what sinful creations we are...<br>

<br>
In the seas surrounding an area near the Southern continent, untouched by the conflict with the Sirens...<br>
Many cultures thrived in this vast continent, distanced from the large-scale conflict between the major maritime powers and the Sirens.<br>
But these peaceful waters did not know of the dark undercurrents that would usher in the horns of battle...<br>
A fleet was crossing the ocean, approaching a remote island located off the continent.<br>
Mozambique Strait<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Fortune：</span><br>
Th-there's a Siren fleet ahead of us...! One, two, three... no, there's even more!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Jeanne d'Arc：</span><br>
We've only just entered the strait, and they've already gathered here in such large numbers?<br>
It shouldn't have been that long ago...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Richelieu：</span><br>
Since the Vichya Dominion extended their influence to this area, it's not unusual for there to be Siren interference.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Illustrious：</span><br>
During Operation Catapult, why were the Sirens working under the Vichya Dominion...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Béarn：</span><br>
Back then, Dunkerque mentioned something about being "puppets of the Iron Blood"...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Illustrious：</span><br>
Ah, my apologies, I didn't mean to open past wounds...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Richelieu：</span><br>
Don't worry about it. Back then, it was only natural for everyone to feel distrust towards the Royal Navy.<br>
All these problems still stem from the fact that we were invaded by Iron Blood. Now that our homeland is divided and at war with each other, we have no choice but to face reality.<br>
This time... We, Iris Libre, will persuade the Vichya Dominion.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Illustrious：</span><br>
Miss Richelieu, I still have my reservations regarding your direct participation in this operation...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Richelieu：</span><br>
No, I must. I must prove if the accusations that I am a hypocrite are true or not. To my own heart, to God, and to the Vichya Dominion.<br>
There is no reason for those who have inherited the former Iris Orthodoxy to be at war with one another.<br>
<br>
Upon saying that, Richelieu briefly flashed a bitter smile.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Illustrious：</span><br>
Yes, just like back with the Azur Lane, when we didn't have to fight one another...<br>

<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Illustrious：</span><br>
Granted that I am not fully informed about this matter, I still haven't been told why Iris Libre chose this place as the site of the operation.<br>
Among the Vichya forces stationed here are mass-produced Iron Blood vessels and even Sirens...<br>
But this place is certainly no headquarters of the Vichya Dominion, nor does it seem to hold any strategic importance. Why, then, did you choose this place?<br>
...Excuse me, Miss Richelieu, I ask this not to question your judgment, but rather for understanding.<br>
Might there be some religious purpose behind this?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Richelieu：</span><br>
Illustrious, are you familiar with the history of the Iris Orthodoxy in this world?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Illustrious：</span><br>
I've heard a little about it, but my understanding is cursory.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Richelieu：</span><br>
I see. In that case, let's exchange some information.<br>
The ultimate goal of Iris Libre, needless to say, is to reconcile with the Vichya Dominion. This should have been explained to everyone in the Royal Navy.<br>
As for the purpose of this operation, it is to secure the Basilica that proves the authenticity of Iris Libre.<br>
To be precise, the goal is to investigate a location that represents the legitimacy of the Iris Orthodoxy... Ideally, we would bring it under the exclusive control of Iris Libre.<br>
The Vichya Dominion likely would have the same goal in mind, but...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Illustrious：</span><br>
Since the Iron Blood is also here, you planned to also ask the Vichya Dominion about their intentions, right?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Richelieu：</span><br>
Yes. The Basilica rightfully belongs to the Iris Orthodoxy. Actually, this mission should have been carried out without the assistance of the Royal Navy, but with the Iron Blood here...<br>
Even if we managed to secure the Basilica, we would not be able to hold it without the necessary forces. Therefore...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Illustrious：</span><br>
You sought an audience with Her Majesty, established a joint task force, and came here.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Richelieu：</span><br>
Yes, that's right. I'm sorry I didn't tell you when we first set out.<br>
For the sake of both Iris Libre and the Vichya Dominion, please lend me your power once more.<br>

<br>
Mozambique Strait - Siren-Contested Area<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Jeanne d'Arc：</span><br>
Did you really not tell Illustrious about that?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Richelieu：</span><br>
Correct. Some things are better kept hidden for now.<br>
If I was to disclose that information, the Royal Navy would undoubtedly begin to weigh the costs versus the benefits.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Jeanne d'Arc：</span><br>
Is that so...? I trust your judgment, Richelieu, but I suppose that means I can't tell them anything either.<br>
Ahh, to once again harbor such secrets... What a sinful girl you are, Jeanne...<br>
Though I don't even know about this secret, to turn my back against the teachings of the Heavenly Father and withhold such important information from my allies...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Richelieu：</span><br>
(Right, Jeanne doesn't know about the details either...)<br>
This Basilica symbolized the bright future that awaited the Iris Orthodoxy.<br>
But now that it has fallen into the hands of the Vichya Dominion and the Iron Blood, the darker side that has been hidden in the shadows is about to be revealed.<br>
Such things must not be allowed to happen. This does not solely concern Iris Libre and the Vichya Dominion, but also holds true for the Royal Navy and Iron Blood.<br>
Jeanne, please forgive me for hiding this information from you.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Jeanne d'Arc：</span><br>
Don't worry, Richelieu. I have no doubt that your actions are just.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Richelieu：</span><br>
If possible, I would like to resolve this situation without having to cross swords with the Vichya Dominion.<br>
I have no desire to strike down my compatriots, but above all, those girls do not bear the mark of sin.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Jeanne d'Arc：</span><br>
If the Vichya Dominion has chosen to accompany Iron Blood down the wrong path, it is our responsibility to correct that path.<br>
D'accord. I, too, would like to see this resolved peacefully.<br>
...But, as for that Algérie and La Galissonnière...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Richelieu：</span><br>
For the time being, Jeanne, let's focus on retaking the Basilica.<br>
It won't be an easy task, but we have no other choice than to disarm those girls and make them see things from our perspective.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Jeanne d'Arc：</span><br>
No matter how difficult it may be, we must believe in the guidance of the Iris Orthodoxy and do our part. Isn't that right?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Richelieu：</span><br>
...Indeed. I'll be counting on you.<br>

Mozambique Strait - Siren-Contested Area<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Le Téméraire：</span><br>
Opie, look at all the Sirens!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">L'Opiniâtre：</span><br>
They're probably trying to stop us from reaching the Basilica.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Le Téméraire：</span><br>
If we defeat them, we'll be able to meet up with our Vichya friends, right?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">L'Opiniâtre：</span><br>
Tem, they're our enemies now...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Le Téméraire：</span><br>
Is that so...? I had a nice chat with Vauquelin not too long ago~<br>
We talked about religion, and about picnicking, and then...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">L'Opiniâtre：</span><br>
You're too easygoing, Tem... Iris Libre and the Vichya Dominion are at war now. If you were to meet them on the battlefield...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Le Téméraire：</span><br>
Wait... Opie, would you really...?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">L'Opiniâtre：</span><br>
Of course I wouldn't...! But right now, we need to stay focused on the operation. Let's forget about all that.<br>
We're working with the Royal Navy as well. If this kind of talk caught their attention, we'd end up causing trouble for Richelieu.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Le Téméraire：</span><br>
I guess you're right. But teaming up with the Royal Navy... still doesn't feel quite right. Hmm...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">L'Opiniâtre：</span><br>
After what happened to Dunkerque and Jean Bart, there's no way we wouldn't have our concerns...<br>
We wouldn't be able to just move on and act like everything is forgiven...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Le Téméraire：</span><br>
...That's enough of the downer talk! Let's just forget about this and let Béarn handle the complicated stuff!<br>
Right now, we have to focus on what's in front of us – the Sirens!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">L'Opiniâtre：</span><br>
Yes, let's stick to that for now.<br>
With me, Tem!<br>

<br>
The Basilica Isle<br>
While the combined forces of the Royal Navy and Iris Libre were engaging the Sirens...<br>
<span style="color:#ffd000;">Vauquelin：</span><br>
The Iris-Royal Navy forces have entered the waters around the Basilica and are now engaging the Sirens there!<br>
<span style="color:#ffd000;">La Galissonnière：</span><br>
They're already here?! Ahaha, now this is what I've been looking forward to!<br>
<span style="color:#ffd000;">Algérie：</span><br>
If the Cardinal is personally leading this operation, their morale is probably quite high~<br>
...Anyway, they sure are devoting a considerable amount of effort into taking this Basilica.<br>
<span style="color:#ffd000;">La Galissonnière：</span><br>
I'm guessing the party's over if we lose this place to them, right?<br>
<span style="color:#ffd000;">Vauquelin：</span><br>
Super over. They should just libre-rate their inner party animals and join us instead. Get it? Libre-rate? Okay, never mind...<br>
...I just don't understand them at all. Why'd they come all the way out here, so far from the European continent?<br>
This Basilica might be important for the Iris Libre, but I can't believe they'd go so far as to try to steal it from us.<br>
<span style="color:#ffd000;">La Galissonnière：</span><br>
Just what is their leadership thinking?<br>
Algérie, is there anything unusual about this Basilica?<br>
<span style="color:#ffd000;">Algérie：</span><br>
Not that I know. Having that said, there is something that bothers me... We were ordered to "protect the Basilica at any cost."<br>
<span style="color:#ffd000;">La Galissonnière：</span><br>
So, even Algérie doesn't know. Y'know, I actually looked into it a little.<br>
<span style="color:#ffd000;">Algérie：</span><br>
Oh, is that so?<br>
<span style="color:#ffd000;">Vauquelin：</span><br>
Ooh, I wanna hear about it!<br>
<span style="color:#ffd000;">La Galissonnière：</span><br>
It's not like I learned anything though. Not even my friend on the "other" side knew about it.<br>
<span style="color:#ffd000;">Vauquelin：</span><br>
Aww...<br>
<span style="color:#ffd000;">La Galissonnière：</span><br>
Well, maybe they're just trying to settle an old score? Algérie, should we intercept them?<br>
<span style="color:#ffd000;">Vauquelin：</span><br>
It'd be nice if the Sirens could push them back without us~<br>
<span style="color:#ffd000;">La Galissonnière：</span><br>
Nuh-uh, no way that's happening. I could take those scrapheaps on all by myself; there's no way they'd be able to stop a joint fleet led by the Cardinal.<br>
The best we can hope for is that they'll buy us some time. Not sure how we keep them from approaching the Basilica, but this is the best we got.<br>
<span style="color:#ffd000;">Algérie：</span><br>
We have no way of controlling those mass-produced Sirens manufactured by the Iron Blood, huh?<br>
<span style="color:#ffd000;">La Galissonnière：</span><br>
Well, it's none of my concern. I wonder what the leadership of the Vichya and Iron Blood are up to right now...<br>
<br>
La Galissonnière looked over into the distance, where she saw a figure on the horizon.<br>
<span style="color:#ffd000;">La Galissonnière：</span><br>
The Vichya Dominion's secret weapon, prepared especially for this operation... is that her over there?<br>
I've never heard of a fourth Richelieu-class ship before...<br>
She's been there motionless ever since she got here. She has following Algérie's orders, but in this emotionless way, like she's a robot or something...<br>
Is she really on our side...?<br>
<span style="color:#ffd000;">Algérie：</span><br>
We can't ask for too much when we don't even have the mass-production ships at our disposal.<br>
Now, allow me to explain our strategy...<br>
{{折叠面板|内容结束}}

{{折叠面板|标题=Hesitation|选项=7|主框=1|样式=primary|展开=否}}
<br>
The Basilica Isle<br>
<span style="color:#ffd000;">Vauquelin：</span><br>
...Huh, I see! So that was your strategy, Algérie...!<br>
In any case, Royal Navy aside, I'd prefer to avoid fighting Iris Libre if possible...<br>
But I'm not sure how I feel about pulling all our forces back to the island's piers...<br>
<span style="color:#ffd000;">Algérie：</span><br>
Then would you prefer to run out there and start shooting in a blaze of glory? The Royal Navy will open fire without hesitation.<br>
<span style="color:#ffd000;">Vauquelin：</span><br>
I was just joking, but... this somehow feels like we're conceding defeat...<br>
If you ask me, I'd prefer an honest enemy like the Iron Blood over treacherous "allies" like the Royal Navy.<br>
<span style="color:#ffd000;">La Galissonnière：</span><br>
So, what's the final decision?<br>
<span style="color:#ffd000;">Vauquelin：</span><br>
The best case scenario would be to convince Richelieu to rejoin us, then we'd launch a pincer attack and take out the Royal Navy!<br>
<span style="color:#ffd000;">La Galissonnière：</span><br>
Seems fun! Let's go with that! Good luck convincing Richelieu, Miss Diplomat~♪<br>
<span style="color:#ffd000;">Vauquelin：</span><br>
Woah, woah, I was just joking! Don't take everything I say literally!<br>
<span style="color:#ffd000;">Algérie：</span><br>
All right everyone, let's take this more seriously.<br>
First, our operational capacity. We're facing not just an enemy battleship, but also two aircraft carriers. Even if we account for the Sirens and the mass-produced ships, the difference in firepower is simply overwhelming.<br>
If only that "secret weapon" would... No, we can't count on it. Even if she was able to fight, I can't say with certainty that I'd be able to control her...<br>
We've completed fortifying the Basilica's defenses, but we won't be able to offer full support without air superiority. After all, we can't afford to take a head-on engagement.<br>
<span style="color:#ffd000;">Vauquelin：</span><br>
...Should we just lay down our arms and surrender, then?<br>
<span style="color:#ffd000;">Algérie：</span><br>
We can't do that. Not just because we are the proud Templar Knights of the Vichya Dominion, but given Jean Bart and Dunkerque's current state, we can't give the Iron Blood any reason to turn on us.<br>
And since Richelieu... surely does not want to fight us either, this is the best opportunity we're going to get.<br>
In addition, we'll drive a wedge between Iris Libre and the Royal Navy. Even if we can't seize victory, we'll at least strengthen our position in the eyes of the Iron Blood.<br>
<span style="color:#ffd000;">La Galissonnière：</span><br>
In other words... we'll show a willingness to cooperate, and stall their advance?<br>
And then, we'll look for an opportunity to weaken the Royal Navy before going in for the kill?<br>
<span style="color:#ffd000;">Algérie：</span><br>
That's right. Without the Royal Navy in the way, it will be much easier to negotiate with Richelieu.<br>
<span style="color:#ffd000;">La Galissonnière：</span><br>
Negotiate...?<br>
<span style="color:#ffd000;">Algérie：</span><br>
Yes, it is up to her whether she wants to join us, or to fight until the bitter end. Our defenses are already prepared.<br>
Our role is to protect this Basilica... and we'll make sure they all understand that fact.<br>
Stay focused on our goals, and we'll achieve a gallant victory just like at Orléans! Hehe...<br>
<span style="color:#ffd000;">Vauquelin：</span><br>
I understand now! You've given this a lot of thought, Algérie~<br>
...Oh, uh, I think we're forgetting that Jeanne d'Arc is currently with the other side...<br>
<span style="color:#ffd000;">La Galissonnière：</span><br>
Pfft... Ahahahaha!<br>
<span style="color:#ffd000;">Algérie：</span><br>
Phew... Anyway, let's stick to the plan for the time being. I'm tired from thinking about all these things...<br>
<br>
Algérie put her hands together lightly and smiled to dismiss the ships gathered around her.<br>
The novice knight, Vauquelin, who was still new to the ways of the battlefield...<br>
The uncontrollable La Galissonnière, who would throw herself into battle "because it's fun"...<br>
...and the "secret weapon." There were simply too many things to be concerned about.<br>

The Basilica Isle - Surrounding Waters<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Jeanne d'Arc：</span><br>
We've broken through the Sirens' defenses! There's nothing standing between us and the Basilica now!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Béarn：</span><br>
Without supporting fire from the Basilica, these Sirens would be no match for us.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Le Téméraire：</span><br>
Woah! Was that Siren plane over there just shot down by anti-air fire?!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">L'Opiniâtre：</span><br>
So even the Iron Blood's manufactured Sirens are being shot at as they approach the Basilica...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Illustrious：</span><br>
Does that mean that this area is a buffer zone between the Vichya Dominion and the Iron Blood?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Richelieu：</span><br>
("Don't let the Sirens near the harbor." Back at Casablanca, that was the order that she gave...)<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Illustrious：</span><br>
(If they're not in lockstep with the Iron Blood, there might still be room for negotiations.)<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Richelieu：</span><br>
(If the Iron Blood occupation of the Vichya Dominion is complete, reversing their influence at that point will be difficult.)<br>
(Since Jean Bart has yet to return, Algérie and the others must be... But...)<br>
Heavenly Father, please give us your blessings... may Iris Libre and the Vichya Dominion become whole once again!<br>
...Ah, my apologies. I didn't mean to startle you.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Illustrious：</span><br>
Miss Richelieu?<br>
...I believe I speak on behalf of the Royal Navy when I say that we would all want to see that day come.<br>

<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Jeanne d'Arc：</span><br>
How strange... We've advanced this far and nothing has shown up... Not even a mass-produced ship.<br>
If Algérie is the one in command, then why would she...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Le Téméraire：</span><br>
They also don't want to fight us, right...?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">L'Opiniâtre：</span><br>
That is one possibility. Another is that they're waiting inside the Basilica.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Radio Message：</span><br>
――――<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Jeanne d'Arc：</span><br>
We're receiving a broadcast from the Vichya forces.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Richelieu：</span><br>
A broadcast...? Let me hear it.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Radio Message：</span><br>
Message from Algérie of the Vichya Templar Knights to the intruders...<br>
Any further trespass upon Vichya waters shall not be permitted.<br>
Change courses immediately. Any further advance shall be considered an act of aggression against the Vichya Dominion.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Richelieu：</span><br>
...I'll issue a response.<br>
"This is Richelieu, Cardinal of Iris Libre. Algérie of the Templar Knights, we wish to speak directly without any intention of hostilities."<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Radio Message：</span><br>
From Algérie of the Vichya Templar Knights to the intruders...<br>
"Any further trespass upon Vichya waters shall not be permitted. Change courses immediately. Any further advance shall..."<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Jeanne d'Arc：</span><br>
The message seems to have been pre-recorded...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Richelieu：</span><br>
.........…<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Béarn：</span><br>
The Vichya has begun to deploy their mass-produced forces, and their defense systems are activating as well... By the looks of things, they're not in the mood to talk.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Le Téméraire：</span><br>
N-no way...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">L'Opiniâtre：</span><br>
Tem...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Illustrious：</span><br>
Richelieu, we await your orders.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Richelieu：</span><br>
...All forces, advance carefully towards the Basilica. Destroy all production-type ships along the way.<br>

The Basilica Isle - Shortly before engagement with Richelieu's fleet<br>
<span style="color:#ffd000;">Radio Message：</span><br>
"Any further trespass upon Vichya waters shall not be permitted. Change courses immediately. Any further advance shall..."<br>
<span style="color:#ffd000;">Algérie：</span><br>
How unfortunate...<br>
It'll be hard to separate their forces if they're moving so closely together. The Royal Navy must be trying their best if they're willing to hand over the command like that...<br>
Now, what should we do next?<br>
<span style="color:#ffd000;">Radio Message：</span><br>
*beep beep*<br>
<span style="color:#ffd000;">Algérie：</span><br>
As expected, Richelieu does not want to fight us.<br>
However, things rarely unfold the way we'd like them to. We need to stay vigilant as well.<br>
Vauquelin and the others... should be deployed somewhere safe.<br>
As for me...<br>
(Just to be safe, about the Basilica's "secret"...)<br>
......…<br>
All production-type ships, forward! Intercept the enemy's fleet!<br>

The Basilica Isle - Surrounding Waters<br>
Explosions tear through the waters as the battle rages on.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Le Téméraire：</span><br>
They're so strong, even though they're just mass-produced ships...!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">L'Opiniâtre：</span><br>
We're at a disadvantage fighting under the supporting fire of the coastal artillery installations... We should continue the fight outside of their range.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Illustrious：</span><br>
Our enemies are much tougher than I expected... We're not making much progress here.<br>
Why is the Vichya going to such lengths...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Richelieu：</span><br>
Their alliance with the Iron Blood may have something to do with it, but these defenses are on a whole different level from what we saw before.<br>
If we don't advance carefully, we'll risk being focused by their coastal defenses...!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Illustrious：</span><br>
Was this part of Algérie's plan...?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Richelieu：</span><br>
Algérie was not only one of the Iris Orthodoxy's best fighters, but also a skilled tactician.<br>
Nothing was more reassuring than having her on the same side, but to face her as an opponent...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Illustrious：</span><br>
Miss Richelieu...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Béarn：</span><br>
One more thing. Those mass-produced ships seem to have received some tuning-up.<br>
Ordinarily, performance shouldn't change within the same mass-produced model. However, these clearly have higher specifications than normal.<br>
Not all of these ships have been upgraded, but the fact that they've mixed them together is enough to cast doubt into our battle plan.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Illustrious：</span><br>
Because they look the same, that introduces an element of confusion.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Jeanne d'Arc：</span><br>
What a tough trial this battle is... does God's protection extend even to these mass-produced ships?!<br>
No, this feels more like it's Algérie's doing...!<br>
O, Saint Michael, why must we be tested like this?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Richelieu：</span><br>
......<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">L'Opiniâtre：</span><br>
Does this have to do something with cognitive chips...?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Béarn：</span><br>
That's a possibility...! Wait... there's been no verified evidence of cognitive chips having any effects on mass-produced ships...<br>
Wait. Could this be… the Basilica's doing…?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Illustrious：</span><br>
The Basilica…?<br>
(While it's true that cognitive chips have been a significant technological advance in drawing out the power of wisdom cubes, we still don't know much about their exact mechanisms…)<br>
(Her Majesty has talked about this on occasion, but is Iris Libre hiding something we're not aware of…?)<br>
(I'm curious about it, but there's no way I can broach the subject right now…)<br>
(If there's some joint research between the Royal Navy and Iris Libre… it'd be best to consult Hood about it.)<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Béarn：</span><br>
(The Royal Navy certainly should already be involved if there's any secret research going on… I'll definitely have to look further into this.)<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Richelieu：</span><br>
The Iris Orthodoxy was conducting some research on cognitive chips since the Great War, but I heard that it was halted partway through.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Béarn：</span><br>
…I think the Cardinal is saying that there's no point in pursuing this line of thought any further.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Jeanne d'Arc：</span><br>
I see…<br>
I'm sorry to interrupt, but… don't you feel something… unsettling about these waters?<br>
It's as if something is encroaching upon us…<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Illustrious：</span><br>
Now that you mention it…<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Fortune：</span><br>
I... I feel it too…!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Le Téméraire：</span><br>
What? I'm not sensing anything, though?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">L'Opiniâtre：</span><br>
Me neither… is this some sort of strange spell...?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Béarn：</span><br>
I'm not noticing anything either. If anything, my reactions feel even sharper when I'm operating my aircraft.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Illustrious：</span><br>
Perhaps being an Iris Basilica, there's something about it that only affects outsiders?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Richelieu：</span><br>
(This gives off the same sensation as the Basilica's sacrament...)<br>
(Is it possible... that the Vichya Dominion already uncovered it...?!)<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Illustrious：</span><br>
Fortune, how are you feeling?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Fortune：</span><br>
I-I'm feeling a little weird...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Richelieu：</span><br>
(If these mass-produced ships are being strengthened by the Basilica... I need to get in contact with Algérie as soon as possible...)<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Illustrious：</span><br>
Miss Richelieu...?<br>

The Basilica Isle - Surrounding Waters<br>
In the midst of battle...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Le Téméraire：</span><br>
...It makes sense now! These aren't very strong, but they sure are durable! They're trying to stall us!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">L'Opiniâtre：</span><br>
There's no spell to get rid of them all, is there... Algérie, why are you doing something like this...?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Illustrious：</span><br>
I'll try to approach the Basilica myself, but it's going to take some time.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Richelieu：</span><br>
Good, let's hang in there.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Béarn：</span><br>
In other words, Algérie's plan is to wear us down?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Richelieu：</span><br>
Most likely. In a negotiation, you must always look to strengthen your position.<br>
In essence, they're trying to decrease the power disparity between our forces as much as possible.<br>
(If they intended to annihilate us, they would've used that first message to lure us in before launching a surprise attack. I doubt they have any intent on fighting us to the bitter end.)<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Jeanne d'Arc：</span><br>
Let's keep taking out the trash while avoiding the enemy supporting fire then!<br>
Fortunately, their numbers aren't too great, so we'll be able to conserve our strength.<br>
But I'm going to get tired of the grind...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Le Téméraire：</span><br>
I wonder if Algérie is going to show up soon...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Fortune：</span><br>
Don't worry, Tem... We're fated to meet again... I think!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Richelieu：</span><br>
Based on the current situation, she'll probably make her appearance before long.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Illustrious：</span><br>
That seems to be the case. My planes have detected a larger Vichya fleet approaching us from the direction of the mass-produced models, led by Algérie.<br>
{{折叠面板|内容结束}}

<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Illustrious：</span><br>
Miss Richelieu, what would you like to do? Should we attack...?<br>
Oh my... Miss Algérie has left the formation and is approaching us alone.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Richelieu：</span><br>
Hmm... Finally something to be relieved about.<br>
Everyone, stand down. I'll go talk to her.<br>
<span style="color:#ffd000;">Algérie：</span><br>
It's been a while since we've last spoken, Cardinal.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Richelieu：</span><br>
Indeed, it's been too long, Algérie. I believe the last time was...<br>
<span style="color:#ffd000;">Algérie：</span><br>
A sunny day in the garden, surrounded by flowers and sweets. Something like that, right?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Richelieu：</span><br>
Yes, that brings back fond memories.<br>
One of Le Téméraire's and L'Opiniâtre's "magic" tricks went astray and almost caused a gunpowder explosion...<br>
<span style="color:#ffd000;">Algérie：</span><br>
Dunkerque came in just the knick of time and even brought some fresh confections with her...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Richelieu：</span><br>
Dunkerque...<br>
<span style="color:#ffd000;">Algérie：</span><br>
I wonder if you still remember the taste. Sweet and fluffy, soft and gentle... almost unimaginable when you think about what she's like on the battlefield.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Richelieu：</span><br>
......<br>
<span style="color:#ffd000;">Algérie：</span><br>
And then there's Strasbourg, Provence, Bretagne, and Jean Bart...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Richelieu：</span><br>
I wonder... how they're doing now...<br>
<span style="color:#ffd000;">Algérie：</span><br>
Yes, as you already know, they didn't sink... They were rescued and are now under the care of the Iron Blood.<br>
Unlike the Royal Navy, the Iron Blood will not betray us.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Richelieu：</span><br>
......……<br>
The true enemies of the Iris Orthodoxy are those who invaded our homeland – the Iron Blood. There is no reason for blood to be spilled between us.<br>
We should live to honor the Lord and protect the Iris Orthodoxy, not to wage war against each other.<br>
Please, Algérie. Come back to us, and let us work together to restore hope to our country.<br>
<span style="color:#ffd000;">Algérie：</span><br>
And what of those who already betrayed us? Would you still cooperate with them despite that?<br>
It's certainly true that Iris Libre and the Vichya Dominion should work together rather than fight.<br>
By allying yourselves with the Royal Navy, you are the ones who betrayed the Iris Orthodoxy. But I'm sure the others will understand how you feel.<br>
How about you join us instead? If you really feel sorry about what happened to Dunkerque, it's not too late to atone.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Richelieu：</span><br>
I will not make excuses. What happened to Dunkerque is my responsibility.<br>
<span style="color:#ffd000;">Algérie：</span><br>
Sure, but that's not all I'm here to talk to you about. The Azur Lane is not the same as it was during the previous Great War.<br>
Even if the Iron Blood is far from just, they are rational and do not betray their allies.<br>
...Even if we can't convince anyone else, that'd be fine. I swear in the name of the Templar Knights that the Iron Blood shall not lay a finger on you.<br>
We are in need of your guidance.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Richelieu：</span><br>
Those who devote themselves to the restoration of the Iris Orthodoxy should not obey that which has become an agent of the Iron Blood invaders.<br>
Only by expelling the influence of the Iron Blood, purifying the tainted throne of the puppet state, and restoring the independence of the Iris Orthodoxy can everyone become whole once again.<br>
After all, this is the will of the Iris Orthodoxy.<br>
For that purpose, we are willing to work with the Royal Navy.<br>
<span style="color:#ffd000;">Algérie：</span><br>
...Heh. It seems like we're traveling down two parallel lines.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Richelieu：</span><br>
...So it seems. But, that won't deter me.<br>
<span style="color:#ffd000;">Algérie：</span><br>
My intent is the same. I have no desire to fight you, but sometimes the world doesn't work out the way you want it to.<br>
In that case, Cardinal, best of luck to you.<br>
<br>
The knight of the Vichya Dominion gave her blessings before turning around.<br>
The cardinal watched her leave in silence before also turning around.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Richelieu：</span><br>
I hope that one day, we'll be able to have another tea party...<br>

<span style="color:#ec5d53;">La Galissonnière：</span><br>
Seems like someone let all the air out of you, huh?<br>
<span style="color:#ec5d53;">Algérie：</span><br>
I guess so. But I have no intention of surrendering.<br>
<span style="color:#ec5d53;">La Galissonnière：</span><br>
...I was just messing around, but whatever. How'd it go with Richelieu?<br>
<span style="color:#ec5d53;">Algérie：</span><br>
She hasn't changed one bit. Charismatic, dignified, and uncompromising.<br>
The others were looking on from a distance, but they seemed to be doing well.<br>
<span style="color:#ec5d53;">La Galissonnière：</span><br>
I'm glad that they're not being mistreated by the Royal Navy.<br>
...Maybe that's 'cause Richelieu is with them? Or it could be something else...<br>
<span style="color:#ec5d53;">Algérie：</span><br>
There's no point in us worrying about that, right? In any case, has Vauquelin moved into position?<br>
<span style="color:#ec5d53;">La Galissonnière：</span><br>
She just did. But, isn't this different from what we had planned?<br>
<span style="color:#ec5d53;">Algérie：</span><br>
Yes, because this Basilica has changed our victory conditions. I'll have to look into it a bit further...<br>
<span style="color:#ec5d53;">La Galissonnière：</span><br>
Does it have to do with that black thing you showed me earlier...? The thing that powered up the mass-produced ships?<br>
No matter how high the stakes, there's no way you can do everything alone. Are you sure you'll be fine?<br>
<span style="color:#ec5d53;">Algérie：</span><br>
Everything will work out. I talked to Richelieu, and neither of us have any intention of fighting the other to the death.<br>
As long as she's in command, the Royal Navy will have their hands tied.<br>
All right... I'll try to draw them in a bit more, so make sure everyone is in position.<br>
<span style="color:#ec5d53;">La Galissonnière：</span><br>
Got it. Take care of yourself, Algérie. You hear me?<br>

The Basilica Isle - Surrounding Waters<br>
*beep beep*！！！<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Richelieu：</span><br>
Main fleet, continue to bombard the enemies! Light ships, help the anti-air fleets with target selection! Everyone, advance with the blessings of the Lord!<br>
(Sorry, Algérie, but no matter how much you've strengthened these mass-produced ships, there's no way we'd lose in a direct engagement.)<br>
Illustrious, Béarn, as I detailed earlier, please focus on neutralizing Algérie by disabling her rigging.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Illustrious：</span><br>
Of course. The holy light will guide us. Hehe~<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Béarn：</span><br>
As you command. Lady Illustrious, allow me to be your escort.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Illustrious：</span><br>
Ngh...! This anti-air fire...!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Béarn：</span><br>
Looks like there are additional anti-air installations hidden on shore. They're not going to let us have a straightforward battle.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Illustrious：</span><br>
What a fearsome opponent...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Richelieu：</span><br>
Don't worry, we can keep pushing forward! Momentum is on our side!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Jeanne d'Arc：</span><br>
The Vichya fleet has begun to retreat!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Le Téméraire：</span><br>
Is Algérie trying to flee?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">L'Opiniâtre：</span><br>
Wow, they're all starting to scatter...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Le Téméraire：</span><br>
All right, let's utilize our speed to catch up to them!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Richelieu：</span><br>
Algérie isn't the type to retreat so easily... Surely this is a trap to lure us in.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Le Téméraire：</span><br>
Really...? This is our strong suit, though...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Fortune：</span><br>
Illustrious, what should we do?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Illustrious：</span><br>
Excuse me, let me check with my planes first.<br>
Their movements are too orderly for a retreat. Rather than leaving the battlefield in a hurry, they seem to be reorganizing into a small fleet.<br>
I can't rule out the possibility that they're trying to thin out our forces, but... should we go after them?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Richelieu：</span><br>
If we split up, the enemy will have the numbers advantage. Remember, there's always a risk of being focused by the artillery installations.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Illustrious：</span><br>
In that case, should we go after them one by one? The Basilica isn't too far away, so we could always deploy a portion of our forces to head there...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Jeanne d'Arc：</span><br>
Lady Richelieu, your orders?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Richelieu：</span><br>
...All ships, we're going to switch course to the Basilica.<br>
Since we cannot confirm the location of Algérie and her forces, let's secure the Basilica first.<br>
The vanguard fleet should not pursue the enemy, and instead retreat to rejoin the main fleet. Taking the Basilica will now be our primary objective.<br>
(If your goal is to protect the Basilica, then you can't ignore this move. It's your turn, Algérie.)<br>

<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Le Terrible：</span><br>
The warm sunlight, the familiar scent of the sea breeze and the sand, all sweetened by the aroma of Dunkerque's desserts...<br>
Today's shaping up to be another fine day.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">L'Opiniâtre：</span><br>
Le Terrible, good morning. *cough* *cough*... Sorry, the magic spell I was working on with Tem seems to have failed...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Vauquelin：</span><br>
Actually, that was my fault! I was just trying to pull a joke! Also, Tartu, why didn't you stop Tem sooner?!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Tartu：</span><br>
Uhh... Sorry, Vauquelin... Did you say something just now?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Vauquelin：</span><br>
Ahhhh, good grief, I can't count on you for anything! I'll give everyone a hand myself!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Le Téméraire：</span><br>
*cough* *cough*... Thanks a ton, Vauquelin~!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Vauquelin：</span><br>
Is Dunkerque in the kitchen? Time to find out! Let's head over there and take a look!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Le Terrible：</span><br>
*sigh*...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">La Galissonnière：</span><br>
Here I am, rusting up from boredom while everyone else is out having fun...<br>
Le Terrible, do you know where Richelieu is?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Algérie：</span><br>
The Cardinal? She should be sitting at that table over... Err, guess not...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Le Terrible：</span><br>
Miss Richelieu headed towards the church.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">La Galissonnière：</span><br>
Oh, merci~<br>
Algérie, y'know, there's something that's been bothering me...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Le Terrible：</span><br>
......<br>
...Isn't this tea way too hot...?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Le Malin：</span><br>
Who's there...? Oh, it's La Galissonnière and Algérie. Good day.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">La Galissonnière：</span><br>
Oh, if it isn't Le Malin! You didn't go to the tea party?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Le Malin：</span><br>
I wanted to, but... Ahem! I mean, I'm on patrol today and could not join you this time.<br>
But don't worry about me. Le Terrible brought me some snacks.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">La Galissonnière：</span><br>
Really? That's fine, but isn't it more fun when you're with everyone else?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Algérie：</span><br>
By the way, Le Malin, have you seen the Cardinal?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Le Malin：</span><br>
Hmm, Richelieu should be by the...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Jean Bart：</span><br>
She headed over to the headquarters. I can send a message if you need her.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">La Galissonnière：</span><br>
Oh, Jean Bart? It's really no big deal though. I was just worried that the host of the tea party wouldn't be coming back.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Jean Bart：</span><br>
I see... Well, you should hurry back and enjoy the tea before it gets cold. There's some other stuff I gotta attend to.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">La Galissonnière：</span><br>
Thanks, Jean Bart! We'll be heading back then~<br>
The tea you make really is something else. I just can't seem to get the hang of it.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Algérie：</span><br>
Anyone can do it as long as they calm down and put their mind to it. With how fidgety you are, I can see how that would be hard, though.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">La Galissonnière：</span><br>
Really, huh? Well, even if I don't do it, someone else will take care of it.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Algérie：</span><br>
Hehe. So, what did you need to see the Cardinal for?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">La Galissonnière：</span><br>
I heard from a certain friend that the Iron Blood has begun to move.<br>
I'd get told to mind my own business if I told HQ about it, so I haven't bothered with that.<br>
But I was wondering if Richelieu knew anything about it. Just out of curiosity.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Algérie：</span><br>
"The possibility of war breaking out with the Iron Blood"...<br>
(Thinking about it makes me shudder, but Richelieu and Jean Bart did both mention it before.)<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">La Galissonnière：</span><br>
It's still peaceful for now, but things are about to get fun real soon. I can already smell the smoke.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Algérie：</span><br>
Are you sure that isn't just L'Opiniâtre's magic? Anyway, care for another cup?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">La Galissonnière：</span><br>
Hehe, sure.<br>
<br>
The Basilica Isle - Just a while ago<br>
<span style="color:#ffd000;">Algérie：</span><br>
...Why am I reminiscing about the old days again...<br>
Vauquelin and La Galissonnière are doing their part. I need to hurry and finish my preparations too.<br>
<br>
When Algérie turned to leave the room, a figure blocked her way.<br>
<span style="color:#ffd000;">Gascogne：</span><br>
Algérie of the Templar Knights, the Vichya Headquarters wishes to confirm your receipt of the top-secret orders.<br>
<span style="color:#ffd000;">Algérie：</span><br>
...From the headquarters? I should've known that you were no simple helper.<br>
<br>
The expressionless Gascogne handed a small box to Algérie.<br>
The handcrafted box was old-fashioned and decorated elaborately, but seemed to give off a strange sensation.<br>
<span style="color:#ffd000;">Algérie：</span><br>
(A very old box from the Iris Orthodoxy... the seal of the Vichya Dominion was attached later. There's no sign that it's ever been opened, and this girl doesn't seem to know what it is either.)<br>
<br>
Algérie opened the box, revealing a device along with some notes.<br>
<span style="color:#ffd000;">Algérie：</span><br>
(A secret order from the Vichya? What could they want...?)<br>
What...?!<br>

The combined Iris-Royal fleet ignored the maneuvers of the Vichya ships and headed straight towards the Basilica.<br>
Despite being hindered by the various coastal defenses, they soon successfully reached the Basilica.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Béarn：</span><br>
There are a lot of smaller defensive structures concentrated here. It seems that they tried to turn this Basilica into a fortress.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Le Téméraire：</span><br>
All that bombardment from earlier wasn't even their trump card...?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Béarn：</span><br>
No, but they did place their defenses at all the crucial locations up until now, making their firepower extremely efficient. However, there's still no sign of their surface fleet... <br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Le Téméraire：</span><br>
If we can just capture the Basilica, it wouldn't make sense to be fighting out there, right?<br>
I guess Miss Algérie really didn't want to fight us...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Jeanne d'Arc：</span><br>
I also want to believe that, but Algérie is a knight of the Vichya Dominion. She wouldn't kneel before us so easily.<br>
Although the Iron Blood should not be able to enter these waters, we cannot rule out the possibility of their intervention either.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Illustrious：</span><br>
But I'm still wondering, why would they allow us to approach like this? If they were trying to spread our forces thin, there had to be a better way.<br>
...I have a bad feeling about this.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Richelieu：</span><br>
...I agree. What if they're trying to lure us in range of the Basilica's defenses before turning their fleet around to surround us?<br>
However, if we were to fight here, that would pose the risk of stray shots damaging the Basilica.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Illustrious：</span><br>
Miss Richelieu, the Vichya Fleet...!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Béarn：</span><br>
So they've shown themselves at last. As Richelieu said, there's no way they'd let us capture the Basilica for free.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Richelieu：</span><br>
Vauquelin is leading a fleet of mass-produced ships. Vanguard fleet, please intercept them, but don't chase too far.<br>
The main fleet will continue to press forward. If we reach the Basilica, this pointless battle will end.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Illustrious：</span><br>
Fortune, I'm well-protected here. You can fight with Iris Libre's fleet if you'd like.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Fortune：</span><br>
U-understood!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Jeanne d'Arc：</span><br>
Richelieu, Illustrious, see you later!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Richelieu：</span><br>
Indeed. Please be careful.<br>

<span style="color:#ec5d53;">Vauquelin：</span><br>
Hahah! Behold the Vichya Dominion's enhanced, indestructible Mass-Production Corps, led by the unvanquished Vauquelin!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Jeanne d'Arc：</span><br>
What? The unvanquished Vauquelin? Enhanced and indestructible...?! Why must God test us with such tribulations...!<br>
<span style="color:#ec5d53;">Vauquelin：</span><br>
Uhh, I was just trying to think of something cool to say, so you don't have to take it so literally! That's super embarrassing... *blush*<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Jeanne d'Arc：</span><br>
Haha... But I must ask you once again, please return to Iris Libre! There's no reason for us to have to fight!<br>
<span style="color:#ec5d53;">Vauquelin：</span><br>
I-I'm glad you feel that way, but as one of the Vichya's glorious Templar Knights, I can't just hang up my gear and say, "sure thing!"<br>
...Besides, I don't want to fight you either. As Algérie said, if I can get you to turn around or convince you to join us, I won't have to fire a single shot.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Jeanne d'Arc：</span><br>
...Sorry, but that's off the table. We have something we must do...<br>
<span style="color:#ec5d53;">Vauquelin：</span><br>
Mm... What should we do then...?<br>
Ah, I know! How about, instead of fighting with our rigging, we joust the old-fashioned, knightly way?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Jeanne d'Arc：</span><br>
You'd like to settle this with the sword? Very well. I, Jeanne d'Arc, shall not hold back...<br>
<span style="color:#ec5d53;">Vauquelin：</span><br>
Wait, wait, wait! I'd totally get my butt handed to me! Um... I was just blurting out some ideas!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Jeanne d'Arc：</span><br>
Really? That's too bad though, since this is a battlefield after all...<br>
<span style="color:#ec5d53;">Vauquelin：</span><br>
Fine, I'll take you on then! Wait, Tem, you're coming at me too?!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Jeanne d'Arc：</span><br>
If you don't want to duel me one-on-one, we'll just fight the usual way!<br>
<span style="color:#ec5d53;">Vauquelin：</span><br>
Ehhhhhh?! F-fine, let's do this!<br>

<span style="color:#ec5d53;">Vauquelin：</span><br>
What's wrong, Opie? Your magic seems to lack its usual kick today!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">L'Opiniâtre：</span><br>
So you've figured out how to dodge my spells? Let's see how you deal my serious sorcery...!<br>
<span style="color:#ec5d53;">Vauquelin：</span><br>
Hey, I don't want to deal with that at all! I mean, uh, come at me!<br>
<br>
KABOOM!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Le Téméraire：</span><br>
Vauquelin keeps bobbing and weaving around in close range! It's too hard to get a clean shot at her rigging's power source!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Jeanne d'Arc：</span><br>
Did they decide on these maneuvers beforehand? Surely Algérie would've planned for something like this.<br>
(But uncovering their strategy won't win the battle for us. We've got to eliminate the mass-produced ships and encircle Vauquelin!)<br>
Everyone, please report your current situation!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Le Téméraire：</span><br>
Le Téméraire here, in good condition! I've taken some minor damage, but I'm good to go!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">L'Opiniâtre：</span><br>
I'm fine as well. I can continue fighting without any issues.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Fortune：</span><br>
Um, this is Fortune... My second turret... and my motility unit have been damaged...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">L'Opiniâtre：</span><br>
Fortune...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Jeanne d'Arc：</span><br>
(Even though the bulk of the vanguard fleet consists of Iris Libre ships, the majority of the damage has been sustained by the Royal Navy. In other words...)<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Fortune：</span><br>
Ugh...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Le Téméraire：</span><br>
Vauquelin, why are you doing this...?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Jeanne d'Arc：</span><br>
Sorry, Richelieu, but we're going to have to change our strategy! In addition to focusing on the power supply, please also try to disarm them!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">L'Opiniâtre：</span><br>
We can't let them keep targeting our Royal Navy allies...!<br>
{{折叠面板|内容结束}}

{{折叠面板|标题=Fortune|选项=20|主框=1|样式=primary|展开=否}}
<span style="color:#ec5d53;">Vauquelin：</span><br>
Algérie, um... I don't think I can deal with their entire vanguard by myself...<br>
<span style="color:#ec5d53;">Algérie：</span><br>
I know, you've been given an impossible task. However, focus on evading, and take aim at the Royal Navy ships if you get an opportunity to fire.<br>
<span style="color:#ec5d53;">Vauquelin：</span><br>
I can do that, but... what if they don't stand down...?<br>
<span style="color:#ec5d53;">Algérie：</span><br>
I'll back you up at that point. Ah, please keep an eye on the submarines.<br>
<span style="color:#ec5d53;">Vauquelin：</span><br>
Submarines? Did we have any submarines stationed around here?<br>
<span style="color:#ec5d53;">Algérie：</span><br>
Well, who knows? In any case, just keep your eyes peeled.<br>
<span style="color:#ec5d53;">Vauquelin：</span><br>
Got it! Your strategies have never failed, so just leave this to me!<br>
<br>
KABOOM!<br>
<span style="color:#ec5d53;">Vauquelin：</span><br>
(I said I'd focus on dodging, but they're coming after me a lot harder all of a sudden!)<br>
(They seem to have figured out that I was only aiming for the Royal Navy ships... but since they're allies, of course they couldn't just let that slide...)<br>
(In any case, Algérie said she'd be following up any moment now, so I'll have to find the right timing to make a retreat!)<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">L'Opiniâtre：</span><br>
Taste my true sorcery! I mean, uh, fiiire!<br>
<span style="color:#ec5d53;">Vauquelin：</span><br>
(Woah?! Did Opie close the gap on me while I was thinking about Algérie's strategy...?!)<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">L'Opiniâtre：</span><br>
Daydreaming at a time like this? Vauquelin, did Tartu rub off on you?<br>
<span style="color:#ec5d53;">Vauquelin：</span><br>
Don't be worrying about me! Anyway, it's about time for me... to make my exit! Whoosh!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">L'Opiniâtre：</span><br>
Vauquelin! ...What's this...?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Jeanne d'Arc：</span><br>
It's a smokescreen! She's trying to run away?!<br>
<span style="color:#ec5d53;">Vauquelin：</span><br>
Of course I am! There's no way for me to win!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">L'Opiniâtre：</span><br>
Wait! Vauquelin!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Jeanne d'Arc：</span><br>
L'Opiniâtre! Remember what Richelieu said about not overextending ourselves? Get back in formation!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Le Téméraire：</span><br>
What did Vauquelin come here for then...?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Jeanne d'Arc：</span><br>
I don't know. Richelieu and the others should already be at the Basilica, and none of us seem to be injured... Wait, no...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Fortune：</span><br>
Ah, um...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Le Téméraire：</span><br>
What's wrong, Fortune? Does it hurt?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Fortune：</span><br>
I... I'm fine... Thanks for your concern... and sorry for making you worry.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">L'Opiniâtre：</span><br>
What's wrong? Why did you start crying?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Fortune：</span><br>
Um, well, Hood and the others... did a terrible thing to those Vichya girls... right?<br>
It pains me to say this, but as a member of the Royal Navy, um...<br>
Despite all that, you still fought alongside us, and protected us... even against your former companions...<br>
I know that... even if I apologize now, I won't be able to change what has already been done...<br>
But, I'm so sorry... for everything that's happened...!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Jeanne d'Arc：</span><br>
......<br>
Yes, we're aware of all of that. But Richelieu still decided to work with the Royal Navy.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Fortune：</span><br>
...B-but...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Jeanne d'Arc：</span><br>
It is true that what happened to Dunkerque indeed was the responsibility of the Royal Navy, and Richelieu does bear a portion of that burden. However...<br>
We shall not be stopped here if we are to reclaim our homeland.<br>
The Iris Orthodoxy should be made whole again. There is no future ahead of us in the hands of the Iron Blood.<br>
...That's why, right now, we stand together.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Fortune：</span><br>
Jeanne... Thank you!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Jeanne d'Arc：</span><br>
Since the Vichya fleet is retreating, Richelieu and the others should be getting back to us soon... Wait, what...?!<br>

<br>
The Basilica Isle - Near vicinity<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Richelieu：</span><br>
We've received a message from Jeanne. They've successfully repelled Vauquelin and are coming to join up with us.<br>
The enemy forces seem to have focused their fire on Fortune, causing her to sustain slight damage, but she is still able to fight.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Illustrious：</span><br>
Phew... Thank you for looking after Fortune... Miss Richelieu...<br>
Just what are they trying to do here? The Vichya forces have gone through all this trouble to defend this Basilica and to try to push us back... for what purpose?<br>
Does this Basilica have anything to do with those cognitive chip-enhanced mass-produced ships?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Richelieu：</span><br>
(I heard from Béarn that the Royal Navy has launched its own investigation... Am I not going to be able to hide it any longer?)<br>
To be frank, this Basilica holds the great sacraments of the Iris Orthodoxy, which–<br>
<br>
Before she could finish her sentence, a dazzling light erupted from deep within the island and poured into the surrounding waters.<br>
Above them was a dome of light, shimmering like the vaulted ceiling of the Basilica, touched by the hand of the Divine.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Illustrious：</span><br>
It's... so beautiful...<br>
<br>
The array of light was breathtakingly beautiful, as if witnessing a work of God.<br>
All who cast their eyes to the skies were captivated by this otherworldly phenomenon, their engines inadvertently grinding to a halt.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Richelieu：</span><br>
The "Skybound Wall," the divine barrier only referenced in this Basilica's most esoteric scriptures...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Illustrious：</span><br>
The secrets of this Basilica transcend our wildest imagination...<br>
Miss Richelieu, do you think this is what the Vichya Dominion and the Iron Blood were after?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Richelieu：</span><br>
That is a possibility... But it's not something I wanted to believe...<br>
(This barrier bears a great resemblance to the technology of the Iron Blood... But why...?)<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Jeanne d'Arc：</span><br>
Richelieu... The "Skybound Wall" really existed all along?! This path has been completely sealed!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Richelieu：</span><br>
Calm down, Jeanne d'Arc.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Jeanne d'Arc：</span><br>
Y-yes! ...I apologize for being overcome with emotion...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Richelieu：</span><br>
We know that the "Skybound Wall" was mentioned in the Iris Orthodoxy's literature, and it would not surprise me if there were plans to reproduce it.<br>
To the best of our knowledge, no weapon of that nature has been found so far. Therefore, we should think thoroughly about the situation without being caught up by its appearance.<br>
Whatever you do, don't touch the barrier. Stay calm, and find a way to the Basilica where the light conjoins.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Jeanne d'Arc：</span><br>
Understood!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Richelieu：</span><br>
"When the Skybound Wall is unveiled, the next truth shall become manifest." That is the legend spoken of in literature.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Illustrious：</span><br>
The next truth...?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Richelieu：</span><br>
It was written that "God's light shall return everything to the flames of Creation." While that seems unbelievable, after what we've seen so far, I wouldn't say that it can't happen.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Illustrious：</span><br>
God's light... shall return everything to the flames of Creation...? So in other words...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Richelieu：</span><br>
Yes, we'll all be annihilated.<br>

<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Béarn：</span><br>
Richelieu, Algérie's fleet is approaching.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Richelieu：</span><br>
If this barrier was a part of Algérie's tactics, then we can assume the Vauquelin's fleet was a diversion to pull away our vanguard fleet while she planned to attack us here.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Illustrious：</span><br>
Without our vanguard fleet, our chances of victory are much lower.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Richelieu：</span><br>
Is La Galissonnière here as well?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Béarn：</span><br>
I don't see her.<br>
She may have blended in with the mass-produced ships or hid herself somewhere to mislead us. She has a knack for dirty tricks like that.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Illustrious：</span><br>
Miss Richelieu, if our carriers get incapacitated, we'll be at a significant disadvantage when dealing with their defense installations.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Richelieu：</span><br>
Indeed. Without a doubt, Algérie must be aiming for that.<br>
I will intercept Algérie. Let's have our carriers keep their distance and lend support with their aircraft.<br>
However, even if we guard our carriers, I'm worried that they have something else up their sleeves.<br>
Béarn, just in case, I want you to shoot down some of the enemy planes into the Skybound Wall to see what happens. Algérie should still have another strategy saved up.<br>
<br>
As the whispers of ancient legends coalesced with a stream of cutting-edge intelligence and data, Richelieu drafted plans to counter every scenario she could think of.<br>

<br>
The Basilica Isle - Near vicinity<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Béarn：</span><br>
Richelieu's fleet has made contact with Algérie's fleet.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Illustrious：</span><br>
We're trying to conserve our firepower, but the mass-produced ships are so powerful that we can't afford to hold back...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Béarn：</span><br>
I've noticed the same thing. These ships are definitely much stronger than what we faced before.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Illustrious：</span><br>
Is this due to the influence of the cognitive chips, or the Basilica?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Béarn：</span><br>
Well, it's hard to say. As far as I know, there's no such thing as a "sacrament" in this Basilica.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Illustrious：</span><br>
(Her Majesty said that there is much we still do not understand about the cognitive chips... Iris Libre doesn't seem to know more than we do in that regard.)<br>
<span style="color:#ec5d53;">La Galissonnière：</span><br>
If you're so curious about this place, I could show you around.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Béarn：</span><br>
La Galissonnière?!<br>
<span style="color:#ec5d53;">La Galissonnière：</span><br>
G'day~! Oh, did I surprise you?<br>
<br>
La Galissonnière appeared before Béarn in front of the mass-produced fleet, maintaining a cautious distance but without a hint of panic.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Béarn：</span><br>
I figured something was amiss. After all, enemy aircraft that I shot down were able to pass through the wall of light, but Illustrious's planes were running into something.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Illustrious：</span><br>
In other words, this is no divine phenomenon. Someone is controlling what can and cannot pass through the wall.<br>
<span style="color:#ec5d53;">La Galissonnière：</span><br>
Great deduction! You people are just as sharp as you look! That's right, we are able to control what can pass through the Skybound Wall!<br>
1, 2, 3... I always knew Algérie's plans were reliable, but is she some kind of oracle? There are hardly any escort fleets left!<br>
Which, in other words, means I have free rein to take out your carriers!<br>
So what do you say we... have some fuuunnn?<br>
{{折叠面板|内容结束}}

{{折叠面板|标题=Onslaught|选项=24|主框=1|样式=primary|展开=否}}
<br>
La Galissonnière's sudden attack left the carrier fleet damaged with no way of maintaining air superiority.<br>
Piece by piece, Algérie's plan was falling into place.<br>
However, just then...<br>
<span style="color:#ec5d53;">La Galissonnière：</span><br>
What...?! Where did all these planes suddenly come from?!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Béarn：</span><br>
Richelieu's intuition was correct. I won't let you come a step closer.<br>
<br>
The Vichya's mass-produced ships were engulfed in pillars of flame one after another as the reserve corps that had been lying in wait sprung into action.<br>
<span style="color:#ec5d53;">La Galissonnière：</span><br>
Algérie, you never told me what I was supposed to do in this kind of situation...!<br>
...W-well, thinking's never been my strong suit. Let's just enjoy this as much as we can!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Béarn：</span><br>
You're not going to give up?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Illustrious：</span><br>
You can't win anymore, so why...?<br>
<span style="color:#ec5d53;">La Galissonnière：</span><br>
Hmm? For the fun of it, why else? Algérie told me to neutralize the carrier fleet, so I'm gonna do it.<br>
Now let's see how much we can hurt each other without sinking! It'll be fun, c'mon!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Béarn：</span><br>
Ugh... She's giving in to her bloodlust again...<br>
<span style="color:#ec5d53;">La Galissonnière：</span><br>
So you're the only one left, Illustrious? Guess I'll start by playing with you!!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Illustrious：</span><br>
Ngh...!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Radio Message：</span><br>
*beep beep*<br>
<span style="color:#ec5d53;">Algérie：</span><br>
La Galissonnière!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Richelieu：</span><br>
Illustrious!<br>
<span style="color:#ec5d53;">La Galissonnière：</span><br>
Algérie? What's the matter?<br>
<span style="color:#ec5d53;">Algérie：</span><br>
What's the matter? I told you to retreat if the surprise attack failed! Are you trying to get yourself killed?<br>
<span style="color:#ec5d53;">La Galissonnière：</span><br>
I don't remember anything like that... I thought I was supposed to trade my life for all their carriers...<br>
<span style="color:#ec5d53;">Algérie：</span><br>
That's enough. Come back through the barrier. We still have a chance to win, so don't burn your life out here.<br>
<span style="color:#ec5d53;">La Galissonnière：</span><br>
...Fine then. Well, guess we'll have to play later.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Illustrious：</span><br>
......<br>
<br>
La Galissonnière retreated from the battlefield almost as quickly as she appeared, taking the remnants of the mass-produced fleet through the Skybound Wall with her.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Richelieu：</span><br>
Illustrious, Béarn, don't chase after them. We need to regroup and prepare for the decisive battle against Algérie's fleet.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Illustrious：</span><br>
As you wish.<br>
Richelieu, you're a lot more compassionate and caring than you let on, aren't you... Hehe~<br>

<br>
The Basilica Isle - Near vicinity, not long after the CV fleet's battle<br>
<span style="color:#ec5d53;">Algérie：</span><br>
You saw through the "Skybound Wall" for what it was even sooner than I expected. That disrupted the entire plan.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Richelieu：</span><br>
After our recon planes didn't find La Galissonnière, I knew exactly what you were up to. There's no way you wouldn't utilize her abilities.<br>
Even though I didn't know exactly how you'd carry out your plan, I had a reserve squad on standby, ready to react to any kind of ambush you tried to plan.<br>
<span style="color:#ec5d53;">Algérie：</span><br>
I suppose that's that. I can't keep anything from you, after all.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Richelieu：</span><br>
You've played your hand well, Algérie.<br>
<span style="color:#ec5d53;">Algérie：</span><br>
Yes, I think I've made the most out of the cards I was dealt.<br>
After all, there was no way of equalizing the difference in raw strength. We never had many carriers in the first place.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Richelieu：</span><br>
Without the influence of the Iron Blood, there well could've been... or so I think.<br>
Algérie, you should know better. The Iris cannot bloom in the shadow of the Iron Blood. We should–<br>
<span style="color:#ec5d53;">Algérie：</span><br>
I will fulfill my duties as a Templar Knight of the Vichya Dominion. Now...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Richelieu：</span><br>
Algérie...<br>
<span style="color:#ec5d53;">Algérie：</span><br>
I will bring all my forces in front of the Basilica. With God as our witness, we shall determine who is correct.<br>

Iris Basilica<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Illustrious：</span><br>
So this is the Iris Basilica... What beautiful architecture... It even gives off a sacred atmosphere, but somehow, it's located so far from the Iris Orthodoxy...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Richelieu：</span><br>
Yes, although this Basilica was originally adorned with the blue of the Iris Orthodoxy, not the red of the Vichya Dominion.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Béarn：</span><br>
Algérie and the others are gathering over there with their mass-produced ships.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Illustrious：</span><br>
This is the outcome we tried to avoid, isn't it...<br>
Algérie, Vauquelin, and La Galissonnière... The Iron Blood still hasn't shown up yet.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Richelieu：</span><br>
Whoever controls these waters controls the access to the Basilica. Logically speaking, they have no choice but to concentrate all their forces here...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Illustrious：</span><br>
The Vichya is prepared to defend the Basilica at any cost.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Richelieu：</span><br>
Yes. Even if Iron Blood reinforcements do show up, it's very possible that the situation will devolve into an all-out brawl.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Illustrious：</span><br>
...Having that said, doesn't their combat force look pretty sparse, regardless of how many defenses they've set up around here?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Jeanne d'Arc：</span><br>
Illustrious, not to demean the enemy, but doesn't it seem like Algérie and the others are purely fighting out of obligation?<br>
Even if that is the case, we can't allow speculation to cloud our judgment. We should focus on neutralizing them first.<br>
There's no reason for us to be fighting them, but if they've made up their minds, we also have to prepare for the worst.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Richelieu：</span><br>
We also have something we must fight for.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Jeanne d'Arc：</span><br>
Saint Michael, please give me the courage to overcome this challenge...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Richelieu：</span><br>
This is the last chance for us to talk...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Jeanne d'Arc：</span><br>
Richelieu...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Richelieu：</span><br>
If we have to fight in earnest, then I must steel my resolve. We must honor the Lord in everything we do.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Jeanne d'Arc：</span><br>
Indeed... I'll be praying for you to return with good news.<br>
<br>
<span style="color:#ec5d53;">Algérie：</span><br>
Their fleet looks even more impressive when you see it up close.<br>
I want to be able to lead a fleet as large as that too... though that is a bit of a juvenile wish.<br>
......<br>
I've been waiting for you, Cardinal... Oh, what's this?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Richelieu：</span><br>
Algérie, Vauquelin, and La Galissonnière... You've all fought valiantly.<br>
You've shown ingenuity in utilizing artillery installations, strategic acumen in coming up with a plan to overcome the difference in our fleet's strength, and bravery on the battlefield.<br>
Fellow children of the Iris, the only ground you have left is the entrance to this Basilica. No flash of inspiration or hidden strategy can reverse the outcome of this battle!<br>
Fellow children of the Iris, no longer should we make enemies of each other! Should we fight, we should do it together – against none other than the enemies of our homeland!<br>
Fellow children of the Iris, gather under my banner! Let us work together to follow God's great guidance, to revitalize our country and grasp the glorious future that awaits us!<br>
<span style="color:#ec5d53;">Algérie：</span><br>
...Richelieu, you must be the one to lead the Iris Orthodoxy.<br>
...However, my duty... No, I have a condition for you.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Richelieu：</span><br>
......<br>
<span style="color:#ec5d53;">Algérie：</span><br>
Richelieu, Cardinal of Iris Libre, the Templar Knights of the Vichya Dominion will give you our final answer!<br>
We all walk in the glory of the Iris Orthodoxy, but it is clear that our paths have diverged. We are no longer headed towards the same future!<br>
The Templar Knights pledge fealty to none other than our proud country, and we shall never kneel before those who collude with a foreign enemy!<br>
As knights, ever since we joined the ranks of the Vichya Dominion, our fates have already been written!<br>
For the sake of the Orthodoxy which has given us life and purpose, we shall never retreat. We shall never hesitate, and we shall never betray our homeland.<br>
As the soldiers of God, lift your head high with pride and oust our foreign enemies!<br>
...And that is all. How's that for an answer?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Richelieu：</span><br>
*sigh*...<br>
<span style="color:#ec5d53;">Algérie：</span><br>
Hear this, all members of the Vichya Dominion fleet! Templar Knight, Algérie, shall now take command. Intercept the Iris-Royal fleet at once!<br>
Overcome the overwhelming disadvantage we've been given! Demonstrate your wisdom, determination, and might to our "friends!"<br>
All forces, prepare for battle!!<br>
<br>
<br>
However, the battle proved to be one-sided.<br>
Neither side held back in the ensuing clash, but the clear difference in combat power was insurmountable. There was no chance of victory.<br>
The coastal defense installations were vacant and unmanned, and even the mass-produced ships were completely silent.<br>
Only three Vichya ships remained... Algérie, La Galissonnière, and Vauquelin...<br>
<span style="color:#ec5d53;">La Galissonnière：</span><br>
Welp, looks like we're outta options... Algérie, what do we do now?<br>
<span style="color:#ec5d53;">Vauquelin：</span><br>
Wh-what do we do? ...I knew I should've booked it when I had the chance...<br>
<span style="color:#ec5d53;">La Galissonnière：</span><br>
Not like that would've done you any good. The Royal Navy is waiting for you on the other side, remember?<br>
If required, should I be prepared to sink?<br>
<span style="color:#ffd000;">Algérie：</span><br>
.........<br>
<span style="color:#ec5d53;">La Galissonnière：</span><br>
Algérie, hey, are you listening to me?<br>
<span style="color:#ec5d53;">Vauquelin：</span><br>
Hm? Illustrious is coming over here...?<br>
<span style="color:#ec5d53;">La Galissonnière：</span><br>
How distasteful... it wouldn't be fun at all to go down the same way Dunkerque did...<br>
Well, if this is how things are going to end, I might as well give some holy "guidance" to as many Royal ships as I can... Hm?<br>

<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Illustrious：</span><br>
I know that my words mean very little to you, but please hear me out.<br>
I need to apologize on behalf of Her Majesty... No, the entire Royal Navy.<br>
Back then... after the fall of the Iris Orthodoxy, we were given an impossible decision.<br>
We could not stand aside while the Iron Blood threatened to swallow your country with their dangerous Siren technology. We could not leave your fate to God.<br>
We had to make this decision because we believed the cause to be just... even if we would wound the peoples of the Vichya... of the Iris Orthodoxy.<br>
But it was our responsibility to reject that thinking. We should have rejected such an unreasonable outcome, no matter what purpose we were trying to achieve.<br>
In the end... we still made our decision. For the sake of the Azur Lane... and the future of humanity.<br>
If there is one thing I want you all to know, it is this.<br>
Hood, Ark Royal, all the ships of the Royal Navy that were there, and even Her Majesty... We cannot fully express how much we regret what we did.<br>
<br>
Illustrious took a deep bow, her voice full of sorrow but also determination.<br>
<span style="color:#ec5d53;">La Galissonnière：</span><br>
Hmm... This isn't quite what I expected.<br>
You Royal rat, take your apologies to Mers-el-Kébir and Casablanca and apologize to everyone there!<br>
...Or so I would like to say, but I don't think there's any way to rebuild a bridge between us, wouldn't you agree?<br>
If Vauquelin and Algérie have nothing to say, how 'bout I do the honors instead?<br>
First, I appreciate your sentiment... But what's the fun of saying all that now? So we could fight less?<br>
Second, I don't wanna hear your apologies... Maybe Dunkerque or Jean Bart might be interested, but y'know...<br>
Finally, what to do about all this... Algérie, are you sure you don't wanna use that black cube?<br>
<span style="color:#ffd000;">Algérie：</span><br>
...Hehehehe...<br>
<span style="color:#ec5d53;">La Galissonnière：</span><br>
Algérie, what's the matter? You're acting a bit weird.<br>
<span style="color:#ffd000;">Algérie：</span><br>
"Praise be to our Heavenly Father, may your name be exalted..."<br>
<span style="color:#ec5d53;">La Galissonnière：</span><br>
Earth to Algérie...? Wait, Vauquelin isn't moving either?<br>
<br>
Algérie continued her prayer, seemingly ignoring everything that was going on around her.<br>
<span style="color:#ffd000;">Algérie：</span><br>
"May your kingdom come descend upon this earth as it has in Heaven."<br>
<br>
In response to her prayer, the light of the Basilica gathered around Algérie's body.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Jeanne d'Arc：</span><br>
What... is this...?!<br>
<span style="color:#ffd000;">Algérie：</span><br>
"From today, bestow upon us the Manna that will sustain us."<br>
<br>
Silence fell upon the battlefield.<br>
All ships present fixated their gazes upon the box in Algérie's hand.<br>
<span style="color:#ffd000;">Algérie：</span><br>
"Please forgive us, for we have sinned. Please forgive us, for we have sinned."<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Richelieu：</span><br>
...No, impossible! This is...!<br>
Algérie! Stop! You mustn't use this power!<br>
<br>
But Richelieu's voice could not reach her.<br>
<span style="color:#ffd000;">Algérie：</span><br>
"We relinquish our will to you so that you may deliver us from unrighteousness."<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Richelieu：</span><br>
La Galissonnière! ...Stop her right now! Get that box out of her hand!<br>
<span style="color:#ec5d53;">La Galissonnière：</span><br>
...On it!<br>
<br>
But before La Galissonnière could move, the dazzling light that engulfed Algérie... exploded.<br>
<span style="color:#ffd000;">Algérie：</span><br>
"If so, I will break the confines that bind you to the skies."<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Richelieu：</span><br>
...Everyone, get down!<br>
<span style="color:#ffd000;">Algérie：</span><br>
"Amen."<br>
<br>
An intense light flooded the seas and the skies, searing all the color from the world.<br>
And then, a drop of black ink fell upon the pure, white world.<br>
The black dots quickly grew larger, covering where "She" was like a thin film...<br>
Then, a second shockwave.<br>
This time, a tide of black that swallows the light. Overrunning, coalescing, muddying the world with turbulence.<br>
Against the backdrop of a black and purple cathedral, a Templar Knight became a King.<br>

<span style="color:#ff9900;">Algérie?：</span><br>
"Lies, betrayal, and hypocrisy... are all cut from the same cloth..."<br>
"Judgment for the non-believers. Condemnation for the unrighteous. All the unclean shall be purged by the fires of Heaven."<br>
"True believers shall be saved. Those pure of faith shall be rewarded. Awaken, evolve, and accept your divinity."<br>
"Let us welcome a new world free of pain and sorrow, a world beyond calculation and deceit..."<br>
"Witness now, the second sacrament..."<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Richelieu：</span><br>
Get away from her, you two!!<br>
<span style="color:#ffd000;">Vauquelin：</span><br>
G-Gyahhh?!<br>
<span style="color:#ffd000;">La Galissonnière：</span><br>
You don't have to tell me! Looks like things are gonna get... Actually, there's nothing fun about this situation...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Illustrious：</span><br>
Algérie's signal is identical to that of Bismarck of the Iron Blood...<br>
It's the same as that black wisdom cube!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Richelieu：</span><br>
A black wisdom cube... so that was the true nature of the Basilica's sacrament...!<br>
(In the past, the Iron Blood promised to provide some technology in a three-way negotiation between the Iris Orthodoxy and the Sardegna Empire...)<br>
(I heard that Sardegna was given Siren technology to mass-produce ships, but I couldn't ever figure out what they gave us. No matter how many times I pressed the headquarters for an answer, I couldn't get anything out of them...)<br>
(We only discovered this recently after Le Fantasque confirmed that Jean Bart had been rescued...)<br>
(The Basilica housed a special wisdom cube, a product of the Iron Blood's technology. We knew it was incredibly dangerous, but...)<br>
...Everything makes sense now.<br>
The sacrament is not the Iron Blood wisdom cube itself, but rather what the cube is capable of manifesting.<br>
If this is going to be another repeat of what happened with Bismarck... then we must stop Algérie at all costs.<br>
If their goal was to recreate the legend of the Basilica, then we must avoid the third sacrament, or everything will be burned away!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Béarn：</span><br>
...I never thought the sacraments would be used like this...!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Illustrious：</span><br>
But, when we fought Bismarck, the only thing we could do was sink her...<br>
Must we repeat that tragedy once again...?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Richelieu：</span><br>
...If we must, we will destroy the Basilica instead. If those black wisdom cubes are the source of these "sacraments"...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Illustrious：</span><br>
By destroying the Basilica, there will no longer be any way of reproducing the sacraments, and Algérie will return to normal...?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Richelieu：</span><br>
Yes, though this is just my best inference...<br>
Having that said, destroying the Basilica is no trivial task either. We'll still have to get through the Skybound Wall and Algérie herself...<br>
<br>
BOOM!!<br>
Suddenly, the lull on the battlefield was broken by a violent and indiscriminate bombardment. Streaks of dark artillery rained down upon Iris, Vichya, and Royal alike.<br>
<span style="color:#ffd000;">La Galissonnière：</span><br>
Algérie, you're pushing it too far!<br>
Richelieu, what are we going to do? If we can't get Algérie back, everything's going to be destroyed!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Richelieu：</span><br>
I...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Jeanne d'Arc：</span><br>
I'll draw Algérie's attention! Richelieu, take the others and destroy the Basilica!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Richelieu：</span><br>
Jeanne?! That's way too risky! At least take Béarn with you...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Jeanne d'Arc：</span><br>
No...<br>
Algérie has been swallowed by the power of the black cube. She won't stop at anything until she has exterminated all of us.<br>
I'm sure the real Algérie is still inside there... she would never wield such foul sorcery of her own volition!<br>
"You only live once. This is the only life that God has given us."<br>
We cannot let Algérie become a sacrifice... Richelieu has shown us the correct path forward, not as ships, but as people.<br>
So, I must become the light that will guide everyone into the future!<br>
My name shall become the light that dispels the darkness consuming Algérie!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Richelieu：</span><br>
Jeanne!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Jeanne d'Arc：</span><br>
Don't worry, Richelieu! I have nothing to fear, because the Lord is at my side!<br>
<br>
Raising her standard high, the Iris knight charged forward into the darkness.<br>

<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Jeanne d'Arc：</span><br>
You must keep fighting, Algérie!<br>
<span style="color:#ec5d53;">Algérie：</span><br>
*cough* *cough*...What happened... Where am I...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Jeanne d'Arc：</span><br>
Algérie, do you remember me?<br>
<span style="color:#ec5d53;">Algérie：</span><br>
Jeanne... d'Arc? How could I forget? You've been yelling in my ear for quite a while now.<br>
...It feels like I just woke up from a long dream...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Jeanne d'Arc：</span><br>
Thank goodness. Even in the darkness, you were reaching for the light the entire time.<br>
<span style="color:#ec5d53;">Algérie：</span><br>
You're badly wounded...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Jeanne d'Arc：</span><br>
Don't worry about me. Let's head back to port and rest?<br>
<span style="color:#ffd000;">La Galissonnière：</span><br>
You had us worried, Algérie! Thank goodness you're still alive!<br>
<span style="color:#ffd000;">Vauquelin：</span><br>
I fell down in a shock when the ceiling of the Basilica collapsed! I thought I'd never see you again...<br>
<span style="color:#ec5d53;">Algérie：</span><br>
I'm glad you're safe too, Vauquelin...<br>
...But why are you all standing by the Cardinal?<br>
<span style="color:#ffd000;">La Galissonnière：</span><br>
Well, uh... a bit of an emergency came up? We had to put aside our differences and fight together.<br>
Well, we weren't able to protect the Basilica, but at least it was destroyed before the Azur Lane could occupy it. In a sense, that's mission accomplished?<br>
Considering how beat up you are, isn't this better than getting captured by the Azur Lane?<br>
<span style="color:#ec5d53;">Algérie：</span><br>
*sigh*... I guess so. Some things can't be avoided.<br>
<span style="color:#ffd000;">La Galissonnière：</span><br>
I'm sure there's gonna be plenty of fun to be had later! Richelieu, from now on...<br>
<span style="color:#ec5d53;">Algérie：</span><br>
You might want to hold that thought for a moment...<br>
<span style="color:#ffd000;">La Galissonnière：</span><br>
...Huh?<br>
<br>
BOOOM!!!<br>
From the other side of the now-abandoned Basilica...<br>
<span style="color:#ec5d53;">Gascogne：</span><br>
Fourth ship of the Richelieu-class battleships, Gascogne, commencing combat support operations.<br>
Algérie, La Galissonnière, and Vauquelin are now fleeing towards the southwest. Gascogne will now assume command.<br>

Fourth battleship... of the Richelieu class...?<br>
<span style="color:#ec5d53;">Gascogne：</span><br>
Gascogne of the Vichya Dominion, fourth battleship of the Richelieu class, and nameship of the Gascogne class.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Béarn：</span><br>
This is the first time I've ever heard of the Richelieu class having... a fourth ship.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Richelieu：</span><br>
A ship that should never have existed... why is she here?<br>
<span style="color:#ec5d53;">Algérie：</span><br>
Isn't that perfectly normal? The Royal Navy and the Eagle Union both have ships like that... then there's even Sovetskaya Rossiya from the Northern Parliament.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Illustrious：</span><br>
...Eh, really?<br>
<span style="color:#ec5d53;">Algérie：</span><br>
In that regard, the Azur Lane is no different from the Crimson Axis.<br>
Vauquelin, La Galissonnière, with me. Sorry, but we'll be taking our leave now. The thing with Gascogne is... she's bad at lying.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Richelieu：</span><br>
.........<br>
<span style="color:#ec5d53;">Vauquelin：</span><br>
Reinforcements at the last second to bail us out? ...Yeah right, like that'd happen.<br>
<span style="color:#ec5d53;">La Galissonnière：</span><br>
Well, guess that's that then~ Since the Vichya is still keeping an eye on us, we'd better save the chatter for next time. Let's have lots of fun again next time?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Richelieu：</span><br>
Wait, come back!<br>
<br>
BOOOM!!<br>
<span style="color:#ec5d53;">Gascogne：</span><br>
Attempts to interfere with retreat protocol will be deemed an act of aggression. Warning: Activating anti-surface combat modules.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Richelieu：</span><br>
Le Téméraire, L'Opiniâtre, Fortune, I'm counting on you! Please chase after Algérie!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Le Téméraire & L'Opiniâtre & Fortune：</span><br>
Yes ma'am!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Illustrious：</span><br>
Miss Richelieu, I'll go with them as well!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Richelieu：</span><br>
Illustrious, I need you to help me stop Gascogne!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Illustrious：</span><br>
Of course! I'll scramble my squadrons right away!<br>
<span style="color:#ec5d53;">Gascogne：</span><br>
Gascogne, commencing anti-surface combat operations...<br>
<br>
<span style="color:#ec5d53;">Gascogne：</span><br>
.........<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Béarn：</span><br>
That took long enough. How is our vanguard fleet doing?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Richelieu：</span><br>
There's no point thinking about it. We can only hope that they will bring Algérie back.<br>
<span style="color:#ec5d53;">Gascogne：</span><br>
Combat operations suspended...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Radio Message：</span><br>
*beep* *beep*<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">L'Opiniâtre：</span><br>
I'm sorry, Richelieu, but we're under attack by submarines!<br>
Their torpedoes are so fast that they're hardly even leaving behind a wake...! We won't be able to catch up to Algérie at this rate!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Jeanne d'Arc：</span><br>
I'm sorry... if only I had more power...!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Illustrious：</span><br>
Torpedoes that don't leave a wake... are those the Sakura Empire's oxygen torpedoes?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Béarn：</span><br>
You said that the Crimson Axis wouldn't be sending reinforcements. That seems to be a lie.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Richelieu：</span><br>
Vanguard fleet, please retreat immediately.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">L'Opiniâtre：</span><br>
Understood....<br>
<span style="color:#ec5d53;">Gascogne：</span><br>
.........<br>
Message for Richelieu, Cardinal of Iris Libre.<br>
...From, an elegant spy.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Richelieu：</span><br>
...an elegant spy?<br>
<span style="color:#ec5d53;">Gascogne：</span><br>
"Jean Bart has recovered. Algérie and the others will be safely sent home. The rest is up to you, my wise sister."<br>
End of transmission.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Richelieu：</span><br>
*sigh*...<br>
Gascogne, why did you get in our way?<br>
<span style="color:#ec5d53;">Gascogne：</span><br>
Mission priorities. Protecting Algérie was assigned a higher priority than the delivery of this message.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Richelieu：</span><br>
.........<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Jeanne d'Arc：</span><br>
At least I'm glad to hear that Jean Bart has recovered...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Illustrious：</span><br>
To be honest, the Royal Navy has been searching for Jean Bart for some time now.<br>
I'm sorry for not telling you sooner...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Richelieu：</span><br>
No, the situation hasn't changed. If Jean Bart is with the Iron Blood, then Algérie and the others are...!<br>
<span style="color:#ec5d53;">Gascogne：</span><br>
.........<br>
Gascogne has completed her mission. Conclusion: There is no further value in staying here.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Richelieu：</span><br>
Gascogne! Tell me! Jean Bart... When is Jean Bart going to return to the Vichya?!<br>
<br>
As if she couldn't understand the purpose of the question, the expressionless girl tilted her head slightly before darting away from the battlefield.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Jeanne d'Arc：</span><br>
There's no point asking someone when you don't even know who they really are...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Richelieu：</span><br>
I suppose so... Everyone, let's head home.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Illustrious：</span><br>
In the end, we'll have to leave the Basilica like this...<br>
(The Basilica's "sacrament" that Miss Richelieu kept mentioning... I'm going to go take a look.)<br>
Why did Gascogne only join in after the battle was finished? She didn't even move when the Basilica was destroyed...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Richelieu：</span><br>
I have no idea.<br>
Perhaps it was a decision made by the Vichya Dominion's leadership. Maybe Algérie or Jean Bart decided upon it beforehand.<br>
She calls herself my sister ship, but we don't have enough information right now to ascertain her identity.<br>
The only good news from this whole situation is... I know Le Terrible was involved in all of this.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Béarn：</span><br>
Indeed. I still need to look into what made Algérie tap into the power of that black wisdom cube.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Illustrious：</span><br>
Sacrificing your friends for the sake of an experiment... I don't think even Bismarck would've made that order.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Jeanne d'Arc：</span><br>
A party other than the Vichya or the Iron Blood may have loaded that black cube.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Richelieu：</span><br>
There are many possibilities. Even before our country was sundered by the Iron Blood, corruption was rife within the upper ranks of government.<br>
Until they separate themselves from the Iron Blood... No, the entire Crimson Axis, they will continue to...<br>
…………<br>
Nevermind... Good job on this operation, everyone.<br>
<br>
The Basilica in the south was once a symbol of the Iris Orthodoxy's authority.<br>
Now, its ivory walls are little more than blackened rubble, the songs that once regaled the heavens silenced. However, one song can still be heard from its ruins... At night, in the peaceful waters of the southern seas, it quietly tells the story of the Iris's past - and its future.<br>
Was this a symbol of the fate of those who were born to fight, or the footsteps of a new saint about to be born atop its ruins? Perhaps none may know.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Richelieu：</span><br>
I miss you... Jean Bart...<br>
<span style="color:#ffd000;">？？？：</span><br>

Wait, Algérie!<br>
<span style="color:#ec5d53;">Vauquelin：</span><br>
All right, we're headed back home! ...Wait, we can't do that, can we?<br>
<span style="color:#ec5d53;">La Galissonnière：</span><br>
Gascogne is doing her best out there. Or not? ...Guess Iris Libre's knights are no slouches either.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">L'Opiniâtre：</span><br>
...But I'm a magician...<br>
<span style="color:#ec5d53;">La Galissonnière：</span><br>
Hmm... I don't think you'll be catching us at any rate~<br>
Algérie, are we gonna run, or are we gonna fight?<br>
<span style="color:#ec5d53;">Algérie：</span><br>
Looks like we have somewhere to be... Everyone, pick up the pace and don't get left behind.<br>
<br>
Swoosh!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Le Téméraire：</span><br>
Wh-what?! Was that a torpedo? Fortune, watch out!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Fortune：</span><br>
Woah! Th-that was a close call...<br>
<span style="color:#ec5d53;">I-26：</span><br>
Did we blow our cover? That's too bad~<br>
<span style="color:#ec5d53;">I-58：</span><br>
They won't be so lucky next time...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">L'Opiniâtre：</span><br>
Why are Sakura Empire submarines here...?! Everyone, stay alert!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Fortune：</span><br>
My anti-submarine equipment was destroyed in the previous battle...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Le Téméraire：</span><br>
Woah! These torpedoes are too fast to dodge...!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">L'Opiniâtre：</span><br>
Tem, calm down...! The torpedoes can't curve, so as long as we avoid their line of sight...<br>
<span style="color:#ec5d53;">Vauquelin：</span><br>
Phew, we're saved~! Algérie, are these girls the reinforcements that those memos said we'd be getting?<br>
<span style="color:#ec5d53;">Algérie：</span><br>
Who knows? All I was told that we'd be safe as long as we came here.<br>
(There's no way the Vichya Dominion would've been able to sway the hand of the Sakura Empire... This must have been paid for by the Iron Blood then?)<br>
(But this isn't how Bismarck usually does things... In that case, who's behind all this...)<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">L'Opiniâtre：</span><br>
Their torpedoes are so fast that they're hardly leaving behind a wake...! We won't be able to catch up to Algérie at this rate!<br>
<span style="color:#ec5d53;">Algérie：</span><br>
Téméraire, it's time for you to turn back. If you keep chasing us, there's no telling what the Sakura Empire's going to do to you!<br>
After all, the Azur Lane and the Crimson Axis are one and the same... *sigh*<br>
Please take care of Richelieu...<br>

<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Queen Elizabeth：</span><br>
I need to head back to the Royal Isles! This meeting is adjourned!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Kitakaze：</span><br>
*yawn*... I was going to fall asleep if the meeting continued much longer... Anyway, I'll be heading back to Sardegna to make some more preparations.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Richelieu：</span><br>
Bismarck, I'd like you to confirm the terms of the technology licensing agreement.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Bismarck：</span><br>
Very well. It's understandable that you would have some reservations, Madame Cardinal.<br>
This content, Europa, can only exist if we foster mutual trust.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Richelieu：</span><br>
The Siren technology that the Iron Blood is researching... what purpose does that serve?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Bismarck：</span><br>
It is more than a weapon... It concerns the mental cubes that gave birth to each and every one of us. Use it improperly, and you will be swallowed whole.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Queen Elizabeth：</span><br>
Richelieu! Stop spacing out!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Richelieu：</span><br>
I'm sorry, Your Majesty. I was just reminded of something in the past.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Queen Elizabeth：</span><br>
...I trust you'll tell me about it at our next tea party. Right now, why don't we talk about more pressing matters?<br>
In any case, I'm worried that negotiations with the Vichya will fall through if the Royal Navy sends too many people, so I'll have Illustrious and Fortune be our representatives!<br>
After working together for so long, I'm sure those two will be of great assistance to you!<br>
Oh, and there are two more things I have to say!<br>
First, regarding that Basilica Isle, the Iron Blood has sent Sirens to patrol the perimeters, but they don't seem to want to interfere directly.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Richelieu：</span><br>
In other words, the Iron Blood isn't interested in the Basilica's sacrament...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Queen Elizabeth：</span><br>
That's just a legend after all! There definitely was some research as to whether it could be utilized as a weapon, but that project has long been canceled.<br>
For the time being, you can ignore the Iron Blood's activities and focus on negotiating with Algérie.<br>
The second thing is... Um, well, I'd rather not talk about this, but...<br>
It's about Operation Catapult!<br>
...Illustrious said that she wanted to apologize on my behalf.<br>
I didn't stop Bel or Warspite, and Hood and King George both said that it was the best solution... But really, everyone was...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Richelieu：</span><br>
I understand how you feel, Your Majesty.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Queen Elizabeth：</span><br>
W-well, in that case, I won't say it then! Ahem! Best of luck with our next joint operation, "Operation Basilica!"<br>
I'll be counting on you as well!<br>

<br>
A few days after Operation Basilica...<br>
<span style="color:#ec5d53;">I-26：</span><br>
This is what the ports are like in the Iron Blood, huh... It's totally different from what we have in the Sakura Empire~<br>
Say, I-58, what'd you think about those walls of light back there? They had me a bit spooked.<br>
<span style="color:#ec5d53;">I-58：</span><br>
It's probably similar to our barriers...<br>
...Besides, that was your job. Did you get the recordings?<br>
<span style="color:#ec5d53;">I-26：</span><br>
course I did! You know I wouldn't let Akagi down~<br>
<span style="color:#ec5d53;">I-58：</span><br>
Oh, there's someone coming.<br>
<span style="color:#ec5d53;">Prinz Eugen：</span><br>
Oh my, what a pair of cuties we have here... Welcome to the Iron Blood, my dear guests from the Sakura Empire~<br>
I heard that you even had to participate in an operation before coming here. Hopefully neither of you were hurt?<br>
<span style="color:#ec5d53;">I-58：</span><br>
(whispers) She's just as Akagi described... Beautiful, but with a deep emptiness beneath her words... Since I'm here, just keep your mouth shut, 26...<br>
<span style="color:#ec5d53;">Prinz Eugen：</span><br>
Did Akagi really say that about me? Ehehe~ I'm going to blush from all that praise~♪<br>
<span style="color:#ec5d53;">I-58：</span><br>
...Akagi told me that the Iron Blood is safekeeping something...<br>
<span style="color:#ec5d53;">Prinz Eugen：</span><br>
Right you are, and it's in this very box. Treat it gently on your way back, okay~?<br>
<span style="color:#ec5d53;">I-58：</span><br>
Yes... Akagi said that it's a file of great importance... and should never be opened.<br>
<span style="color:#ec5d53;">Prinz Eugen：</span><br>
I'm glad that we're on the same page. Oh, and could you relay another message to Akagi for me?<br>
"Our tea is unclouded. I'm looking forward to having you at our party."<br>

<br>
Mediterranean Sea - Malta<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Le Terrible：</span><br>
Withered grass beneath the cloudy skies... the smell of gasoline... the sound of propellers and engines...<br>
What an awful place for a tea party... But, what else is one to do in front of the Royal Navy's forward base?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">？？？：</span><br>
Sister? Le Terrible, is that you over there?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Le Terrible：</span><br>
Sure is. Oh my, if it isn't my cute and elegant little sister. How have you been?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Le Triomphant：</span><br>
How long has it been? I haven't seen you since Mers-el-Kébir...<br>
Wait, did you come here instead of heading to Casablanca?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Le Terrible：</span><br>
Yup. Had to do some soul-searching after all, as well as some research.<br>
But you know... I still have some reservations about fighting with the Royal Navy.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Le Triomphant：</span><br>
You're as honest as ever... It's true that given what happened to Dunkerque, everyone is still a bit on edge... especially Richelieu...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Le Terrible：</span><br>
It'll be fine, my wise sister. You don't have to say anything that this fool hasn't already heard.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Le Triomphant：</span><br>
Le Terrible...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Le Terrible：</span><br>
Algérie asked me to tell Richelieu about Jean Bart's recovery.<br>
Has she left the Vichya Dominion yet?<br>
It's all a bit rushed, but if the elder sister isn't allowed to make her move, the younger one won't take the next step either.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Le Triomphant：</span><br>
Huh? What do you mean by that?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Le Terrible：</span><br>
Well, tell you what. Let's wait until Richelieu comes back before we talk about work.<br>
More importantly...<br>
I'm back, Le Triomphant, my lovely little sister~<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Le Triomphant：</span><br>
Wait... Le Terrible...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Le Terrible：</span><br>
Ohh? Should the Knight-Princess of Iris Libre really be crying so readily? Here, have some tea...<br>
......<br>
Ah, this tea's a bit too hot, isn't it...<br>
