<br>
A fated new encounter<br>
An unknown ordeal, on the horizon<br>
Venuses from a faraway land have arrived<br>
How will the girls of the azure sea face them? <br>
Go forth! Dance! Seek the ultimate beauty!<br>
Soon shall Vacation Island manifest itself,<br>
and the special Venus Festival will commence with it<br>
One day, a strange letter turned up on my desk in the office.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Javelin：</span><br>
Ahaha, I don't know what to make of this... not at all.<br>
<br>
Like you said, I don't get what this is supposed to be at all.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Laffey：</span><br>
An advance notice of a crime...?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Z23：</span><br>
But it doesn't feel like there's any ill intent. If anything, it feels like a broadcast announcement...?<br>
<br>
Is it just a prank? I'm not sure there's any point in thinking about it...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ayanami：</span><br>
Commander, I have a report for you. Would you... like to read it?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Javelin：</span><br>
Oh right, you were in the middle of working! I got distracted by this weird letter...<br>
<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项1："Let's give it a look."</span>'''''<br>
<br>
...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Z23：</span><br>
Huh? There's a new island in the vicinity of the port?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ayanami：</span><br>
Is that the "Vacation Island" that the letter talked about...?<br>
<br>
It looks like it wasn't just a prank...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Javelin：</span><br>
Seems like there's no point thinking about it... Commander! We'll go ahead and take a look!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Laffey：</span><br>
We will?<br>
<br>
She's right. It's best if we just go ahead and check it out for ourselves.<br>
<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项1："Carry on with that."</span>'''''<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Javelin：</span><br>
All right! Z23, Ayanami, Laffey, we're heading out!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Laffey&{namecode:6}：</span><br>
Woo~!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Z23：</span><br>
H-hold on a minute! This should be treated as the mission it is! We're not just going there to play around!<br>
<br>
The Venus Festival... For some reason, I get the feeling that this is going to end up being a huge mess...<br>

{{折叠面板|标题=The Preordained Encounter|选项=2|主框=1|样式=primary|展开=否}}
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Javelin：</span><br>
...Target spotted! So that's the island that was mentioned in Akashi's report!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Z23：</span><br>
It's so close to the port... How did we not notice it until now?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ayanami：</span><br>
Something spotted right in front of us... Is it an inflatable boat?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Laffey：</span><br>
An enemy...? Should we prepare for combat?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Javelin：</span><br>
It looks like they aren't armed... oh, they've noticed us!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Z23：</span><br>
It doesn't look like they want to fight. Let's check their status first.<br>
<br>
...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">？？？：</span><br>
Thank god you guys noticed us...! My name is Kasumi. Are you all... from the nearby island?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Z23：</span><br>
Kasumi...? Hi, my name is Z23. I am a shipgirl here on a mission to investigate this area. This is Ayanami, Laffey, and Javelin.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Kasumi ：</span><br>
Ship...girl? Come to think of it, you're floating on the water... Almost as if aided by some kind of ninjutsu...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Javelin：</span><br>
Ninjutsu? Sounds like something our Sakura Empire friends would say.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ayanami：</span><br>
I'm... not using ninjutsu.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Laffey：</span><br>
I can't believe they wouldn't know what we are...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Z23：</span><br>
Is this the "new meeting" the letter foretold...? Kasumi, did you come here from that island over there?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Kasumi ：</span><br>
Yes, it's a bit hard to explain, but... when I woke up, I was here, along with everyone else...<br>
Oh. Might you all be... the "Friends of the Green Catgirl"...?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ayanami：</span><br>
Are you... talking about Akashi?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Javelin：</span><br>
Eh? Are you acquainted with Akashi?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Kasumi ：</span><br>
...It really is just as was written in the letter... Um, won't you come over to where we've set up camp for now? Once there, I can explain a bit more.<br>

<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Kasumi ：</span><br>
Thanks, Marie. I'm back, everyone.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">？？？：</span><br>
Hmm? It looks like more people have joined our entourage...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Kasumi ：</span><br>
Let me introduce these guys, the group of people I just made contact with – Z23, Javelin, Ayanami, and Laffey.<br>
And the people over there are my friends... The ones who came from the Venus Islands with me.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Marie Rose ：</span><br>
My name is Marie Rose! But you can just call me Marie.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Honoka ：</span><br>
It's nice to meet you. I'm Honoka! Um... let's be friends!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Misaki ：</span><br>
Hey there! I'm Misaki. Nice to meet you!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Nagisa ：</span><br>
Hello there. I'm Nagisa, Misaki's big sister. I'm not sure how to feel about this sudden meeting, but... it's nice to meet you all.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Monica ：</span><br>
I'm the dealer, Monica! ...Well, dealer-in-training, to be specific. It's nice to meet you all, heheh.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Nyotengu ：</span><br>
Nyotengu is my name. What an interesting presence you all possess...<br>
<br>
...<br>
Some time later...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Nyotengu ：</span><br>
Now I see. You are shipgirls, are you? And the things you're donning are... riggings, intended for use against Sirens. How very interesting.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Monica ：</span><br>
So you received a request from the Commander, which resulted in your meeting with Kasumi.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Z23：</span><br>
All we know about you is that you all are participating in an event called the Venus Festival. We received an advance notice a few days ago...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Marie Rose ：</span><br>
At that time, we were quite shocked! ...But we had food and a place to stay, so it wasn't too bad.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Honoka ：</span><br>
There was even a pool and a court for beach volleyball... I thought they were quite similar to the Venus Islands.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Misaki ：</span><br>
Also, we found this strange letter while looking around...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Laffey：</span><br>
It's the same as the one that the Commander received...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Nagisa ：</span><br>
It looks like we were both set up by someone... I wonder by whom...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ayanami：</span><br>
This is... some kind of communication device?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Monica ：</span><br>
There's a screen, so it feels sort of like a tablet.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Javelin：</span><br>
Ooh! It looks like something's written on it!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Terminal：</span><br>
"Venuses who have arrived from far away, welcome to Vacation Island!"<br>
"Have no fear. During your pleasant stay at the Vacation Islands, if you complete the missions that are bestowed upon you, the road back home will reveal itself."<br>
"Main Mission: Participate in this world's Special Venus Festival, and show off your exquisite selves in a competition against the girls of the azure sea."<br>
"Secondary mission: Seek the joyful company of the friends of the green cat (Complete)"<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Laffey：</span><br>
Joyful company of the friends...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Z23：</span><br>
Huh... I feel like I'm completely out of the loop.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Kasumi ：</span><br>
Hahaha... And there ended up being an inflatable boat around here, so I figured I'd check out the surroundings... And that's when I met with you guys.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Monica ：</span><br>
Hmm? It looks like we've received another message.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Terminal：</span><br>
"Secondary mission: Head to the port, and acquire the power of riggings from the green cat."<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Javelin：</span><br>
I'm getting serious deja vu here...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Z23：</span><br>
F-for now... Denizens of the... Venus Islands? Please come to the port! We'll need to report the ongoing events to the Commander as well.<br>

<br>
A few days later, at a nearby ocean area...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Kasumi：</span><br>
So this is a rigging...? I'm getting a very peculiar feeling from these things.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Marie Rose：</span><br>
Woah! I'm really floating on the surface of the sea! Ahahah, this is fun~<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Honoka：</span><br>
Marie, be careful... If you fall into the water, you'll be in trouble.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Nagisa：</span><br>
Misaki, are you okay? You're not hurt, are you?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Misaki：</span><br>
I'm fine, don't worry! With this, we can travel on water! I've got to admit, it's pretty exciting!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Monica：</span><br>
The breeze feels so nice~ Heheh, I'll have to make sure to thank Akashi later~<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Nyotengu：</span><br>
What ingenious craftsmanship... That green catgirl is more capable than meets the eye.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Akashi：</span><br>
Ahem... I'm glad that you all seem to be pleased with the results, nya! This rigging is the result of all of my hard work, and I poured my heart and soul into making it, nya. Be careful with it, nya.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Nyotengu：</span><br>
Well then, what shall we do now?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Akashi：</span><br>
For now, all that's left is to prepare for the Special Venus Festival that's coming up, nya. Try to get as used to the riggings as you can, nya!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Kasumi：</span><br>
I really can't believe that the Special Venus Festival is going to happen just like this...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Javelin：</span><br>
Commander, the guests have arrived! I think they've also been looking around for Akashi!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Akashi：</span><br>
Hmm? I see the residents of that island, nya. Do they need anything from me, nya?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Kasumi：</span><br>
It's nice to meet you. From what I've heard, you're the Commander, right? And this must be the green cat... um, I mean, Akashi... right? I'm Kasumi. These are the people I know from the Venus Islands.<br>
<br>
...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Z23：</span><br>
...And that's how we ended up bringing them back to the port.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Akashi：</span><br>
Hmm... So this is the communication terminal, nya? Show it to me, nya... The green catgirl... how rude of them, nya.<br>
<br>
Not only were Akashi and the rigging mentioned in the terminal, but there was also some other interesting bits written on it.<br>
<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项1："Could someone explain this Venus Festival thing to me?"</span>'''''<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Misaki：</span><br>
I'll go ahead and answer that! Seeing that I work part-time as festival staff, and all~<br>
The Venus Festival is a huge festival that occurs in the Venus Islands, where summer never ends. The girls the island's Owner enters into the festival are called Venuses, and the goal is to make them shine as brightly as they can! There's also the goal of trying to earn a lot of money, so we can turn the island into a huge resort.<br>
<br>
Interesting...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Akashi：</span><br>
Commander, you're starting to smile creepily...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Javelin & Others：</span><br>
*stare*...<br>
<br>
Oops. How careless of me.<br>
<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项1："And what about this 'Main Mission'?"</span>'''''<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Javelin：</span><br>
These "girls of the azure sea"... That's us, right? We're going to compete too?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Z23：</span><br>
"A battle between worlds"... surely that doesn't mean we have to...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ayanami：</span><br>
...Do battle?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Laffey：</span><br>
If we are, then I won't go down without a fight...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Akashi：</span><br>
Mm... It looks like this terminal can only receive signals, with no way to... Nya? A new message came through, nya.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Terminal：</span><br>
"Main Mission: Use the power of the rigging to participate in an exercise in the Special Venus Festival, and show off your exquisite selves with the girls of the azure sea (Mission Progress: 0%)"<br>
<br>
An exercise... If I recall correctly, there was one planned to happen soon...<br>
<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项1："Akashi, seeing as you're the technology expert here..."</span>'''''<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Akashi：</span><br>
Hm? The next mission... you want me to figure out who the sender is too, nya? I guess we must complete this mission to get newer ones, nya... I got it! Leave the preparations to me, nya!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Laffey：</span><br>
Ooh... as expected of Akashi!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Akashi：</span><br>
You guys need to help out too! I'm going to make your lives hell, nya~!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Misaki：</span><br>
Ahaha, I don't really get it, but... we'll help out, too!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Akashi：</span><br>
I've placed the training ship in the ocean nearby, nya! Use that to practice against for the time being, nya!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">The Venuses：</span><br>
Okay~!<br>
{{折叠面板|内容结束}}

<br>
Now that the preparations are complete, the long-awaited festival finally begins.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Akashi：</span><br>
Hehe~ I made sure to make this quite the show! The special training exercise, Special Venus Festival, starts now, nya! Leave the casting to me, the annyauncer!<br>
In this exercise, the red team of Venuses will compete against the blue team under the Commander, nya! Win or lose, show us your exquisite forms in this battle, nya!<br>
By the way, you're using special ammo, so nobody will be hurt in this battle, nya!<br>
Now let's begin, nya! First, we'll introduce the red team!<br>
The beauty who tells fortunes in her free time, Kasumi, and the dealer-in-training, Monica! Nya!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Kasumi：</span><br>
Heheh, we're up first, it seems! Let's go get 'em!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Misaki：</span><br>
Kasumi! Monica! We're all cheering you on, so do your best~!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Monica：</span><br>
Oh? The enemy appears to be... a group of super cute girls!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Akashi：</span><br>
Next up is the blue team, nya! The one with the wooden sword is Takao, and the beaut with overflowing passion, that's Atago, nya!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Takao：</span><br>
It's an honor to be relied upon by the Commander, but... why are we in swimsuits?!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Atago：</span><br>
That's because it's the Special Venus Festival! Don't you think swimsuits fit the atmosphere better? Hehehe~<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Monica：</span><br>
Takao, your swimsuit is way too cute!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Takao：</span><br>
Ugh... Th-thank you...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Kasumi：</span><br>
Well, let's get started! Best of luck to you!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Takao：</span><br>
Indeed... May the best duelist win!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Akashi：</span><br>
Well then... Begin, nya!<br>
{{折叠面板|内容结束}}

{{折叠面板|标题=Dancing Blades|选项=6|主框=1|样式=primary|展开=否}}
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Kasumi：</span><br>
I wasn't expecting an easy fight against a renowned shipgirl... but I refuse to lose! Now's my chance to deliver the decisive strike!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Takao：</span><br>
Not so fast! Hi-yaaaaah!<br>
<br>
The crowd breaks into a cheer at the display of perfect offense and defense.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Akashi：</span><br>
Aaaand stop! Both teams put on an equally stunning performance, nya!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Takao：</span><br>
Simply amazing! I would've never expected you two to be so powerful, Kasumi and Monica... It looks as if I still have a long way to go.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Kasumi：</span><br>
Heheh, you're pretty good too! Not only are you super cute, but you've also got some serious skill to boot~<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Takao：</span><br>
N-no, you flatter me...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Monica：</span><br>
Heheh~ How about participating in the Venus Festival along with us, Takao?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Takao：</span><br>
P-pardon?!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Monica：</span><br>
No, I mean it! Come on, how about playing us in a serious match of beach volleyball?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Atago：</span><br>
Sounds like a great idea~<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Akashi：</span><br>
That about does it for the first round, nya! Everyone, we're going into an intermission! I'll see you all for round two, nya!<br>
{{折叠面板|内容结束}}

{{折叠面板|标题=Intermission|选项=7|主框=1|样式=primary|展开=否}}
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Akashi：</span><br>
Commander, there's a change in the terminal, nya!<br>
<br>
It said 0% progress before, but now it's at 28.5%. How is it keeping track of what's happening?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Akashi：</span><br>
Who knows... I still haven't pinpointed the originator, nya...<br>
<br>
It looks like we'll just have to keep an eye on it as we proceed.<br>

{{折叠面板|标题=The Story of Several Sisters|选项=8|主框=1|样式=primary|展开=否}}
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Akashi：</span><br>
Aaaand we're back, nya! The second battle will begin in just a moment, nya!<br>
This time, it'll be a battle of sisters, nya! Representing the red team, we have Misaki and Nagisa, and fighting for the blue team, Admiral Hipper and Prinz Eugen, nya!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Misaki：</span><br>
Fighting dressed up like this... I'm not really sure what I'm supposed to be doing here, but... I'm excited to be battling side-by-side with you, big sis. Let's do our best!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Nagisa：</span><br>
Misaki... I don't want you to get hurt. Be careful, okay?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Misaki：</span><br>
I'll be fine~ Akashi told us that we're using special ammo, remember?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Nagisa：</span><br>
I know, but... don't let your guard down. You're my precious little sister... I'll protect you, so make sure to stay behind me at all times!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Misaki：</span><br>
You really don't need to... I'd like to shoot some rounds, too...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Prinz Eugen：</span><br>
Would you look at that. Sisters versus sisters. The Commander must have a kink for that sort of stuff, heheh.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Admiral Hipper：</span><br>
Quit being snarky and focus, Eugen! Are you ready or what?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Prinz Eugen：</span><br>
Ooh, feeling nervous because the Commander has high hopes for you, "big" sis?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Admiral Hipper：</span><br>
Me? Nervous? Hah! You're just imagining things!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Prinz Eugen：</span><br>
Right. My overactive imagination is the only explanation for why your hands are shaking.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Admiral Hipper：</span><br>
I-it's called shivering! I'm feeling a bit cold, that's all!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Nagisa：</span><br>
That girl with the silver hair looks pretty formidable... So she's the little sister on their side, huh?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Misaki：</span><br>
You think so? All I know is I wanna chat 'em up!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Prinz Eugen：</span><br>
Well, what a coincidence. I was thinking much the same. We could talk about... sisterhood, and such.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Misaki：</span><br>
Sure! We could totally hang out!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Admiral Hipper：</span><br>
Wh-whatever, just focus on the exercise!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Nagisa：</span><br>
Misaki, are you ready?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Akashi：</span><br>
Are you done there yet, nya? Good! Then the second round staaaarts... now, nya!<br>
{{折叠面板|内容结束}}

{{折叠面板|标题=Sisters in Battle|选项=9|主框=1|样式=primary|展开=否}}
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Nagisa：</span><br>
Misaki, to your left!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Misaki：</span><br>
Got it! Hiyah!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Admiral Hipper：</span><br>
Not on my watch!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Prinz Eugen：</span><br>
Ooh. Nice save, "big" sis.<br>
<br>
Their cooperation is flawless. Just what you'd expect from sisters.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Akashi：</span><br>
Aaand stop! Both sides displayed incredible teamwork, nya! Almost makes me wish I had my own sister, nya.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Nagisa：</span><br>
Whew... Well, that wasn't bad. Are you all right, Misaki?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Misaki：</span><br>
Geez, you're such a worrywart... Look at me, I'm perfectly fine. There's not even a single scratch on me~<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Prinz Eugen：</span><br>
Hehe. Seems we're both blessed with good sisters.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Misaki：</span><br>
Ahahah, looks like it~<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Prinz Eugen：</span><br>
Though, I do wish she'd work on her flattitude problems.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Admiral Hipper：</span><br>
Excuse me?! That's not even a word!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Nagisa：</span><br>
Ahaha... she really is quite the formidable little sister, isn't she...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Misaki：</span><br>
That makes two of us!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Nagisa：</span><br>
Two as in... you too?<br>
<br>
As the two sides enjoy their postgame chitchat, a third party enters the picture.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Portland：</span><br>
Did someone say "little sister"?! Here is your complimentary Indy merch as a symbol of our newfound friendship! Now let us praise Indy together!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Indianapolis：</span><br>
Portland, please, this is embarrassing... Sorry, everyone, my sister can be a serious annoyance sometimes...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Portland：</span><br>
W-wait a sec! I haven't even gotten to preach Indy's greatness yet! I just need one minuuuute!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Misaki：</span><br>
I-I guess... sisters really do come in all shapes and sizes...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Prinz Eugen：</span><br>
Think of them as flavors. There's one out there for everyone.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Akashi：</span><br>
W-well then, the second round is finished! Once again, we'll go into an intermission! Look forward to the next round, nya!<br>

<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Akashi：</span><br>
Tired of waiting, nya? It's time to commence the third round, nya!<br>
Introducing: the red team, with a bond of friendship as strong as sisters, nya! It's Marie Rose and Honoka!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Marie Rose：</span><br>
Our tag team is the strongest under the sun!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Honoka：</span><br>
Hehehe! Let's give this our best shot, Marie!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Akashi：</span><br>
The blue team, with a bond strengthened over many years, it's Her Majesty's ardent supporters: Warspite and Belfast, nya!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Edinburgh：</span><br>
Bel! Show them the elegant grace of the Royal Maids!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Queen Elizabeth：</span><br>
Warspite, show them the Royal Navy's glory! Especially to that pink one... What's with her size, anyway?! Urghghh... Prove to her that flat is justice!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Honoka：</span><br>
S-surely you jest?!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Warspite：</span><br>
Y-Your Majesty, please, calm down...!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Marie Rose：</span><br>
Geez, stop bothering Honoka... But you know, I'm super excited to get this show on the road! Let's have some fun, Maid Lady!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Belfast：</span><br>
Hehe, then I hope my sincerity will reach you as I battle to my utmost.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Akashi：</span><br>
Somehow, I'm compelled to cheer for Warspite's side... Ahem! Anyway then, let the next round begin, nya!<br>

<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Marie Rose：</span><br>
Honoka, look out!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Honoka：</span><br>
Right! *boing*<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Akashi：</span><br>
Ugh... So bouncy...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Warspite：</span><br>
Have yourselves a taste of this!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Honoka：</span><br>
...Hah! *boing*<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Akashi：</span><br>
Oh my, nya!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Marie Rose：</span><br>
This is our chance! Honoka, with me!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Honoka：</span><br>
Hiyah! *boooing*<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Belfast：</span><br>
Not so fast, ladies!<br>
Oh dear, oh dear... The Commander seems to have suffered a nosebleed...<br>
<br>
It's a featured fight... in many ways...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Akashi：</span><br>
A-and there you have it! That was a battle that you couldn't take your eyes off of, nya... But I think I've had enough melons for one summer, nya...<br>
<br>
Akashi?!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Marie Rose：</span><br>
Wow... You really gave us a run for our money, Maid Lady!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Belfast：</span><br>
I'm quite impressed with you two. Your teamwork was truly impeccable.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Honoka：</span><br>
Hehe, Marie and I are besties~ You two fought well, too! It was like... you perfectly understood each other, even without saying a single world!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Warspite：</span><br>
I-it seems like our match was the focus of today for a certain reason, but... it was quite a fun battle regardless! Thank you for the game!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Honoka：</span><br>
Geez, you're making me blush~<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Akashi：</span><br>
Get a hold of yourself, Akashi... A professional MC can't be shaken up this easily, nya! Okay, um, we'll continue with the final round after this short break!<br>

<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Akashi：</span><br>
Hmm... The progress is still listed at 85%, and I still can't trace the source of the signal, nya...<br>
<br>
There's not much we can do. It's probably one of you-know-who's plans anyway... For now, let's just work on getting it to 100%.<br>
On that note, looks like the final round will feature...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Akashi：</span><br>
Nyotengu, nya... She's a literal legend among us from the Sakura Empire...<br>
<br>
Hmm... Who should I put up against her...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">？？？：</span><br>
If you're unsure, why not ask your elders for advice?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Akashi：</span><br>
Nya?! You surprised me there, Mikasa...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Mikasa：</span><br>
I was shocked to see the demon of legends. Even more so when she turned out to be exceedingly kind.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Nyotengu：</span><br>
Hehehe. Strangely, Mikasa and I think much alike.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Akashi：</span><br>
Speak of the devil, nya! Or should I say "tengu," nya...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Nyotengu：</span><br>
Did I scare you, little green kitty?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Akashi：</span><br>
I have a name, you know, nya! I'm Akashi, not just "green kitty," nya!<br>
<br>
As they say: when in doubt, turn to people with more expertise.<br>
<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项1："Who do you think I should choose, Mikasa?"</span>'''''<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Mikasa：</span><br>
When faced with an age-old adversary, who else could prove a better match than some unpredictable young'uns?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Nyotengu：</span><br>
Some young'uns? I know not what you mean, but trifling beings as yourselves need not hold anything back. It need not be a one-on-one match, either. I'll allow multiple opponents, just allow me to have fun, dear Commander~<br>
<br>
The "young'uns," eh...<br>

<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Akashi：</span><br>
We've had a wonderful show so far, haven't we, nya? Now it's time to close it off... with the final round, nya!<br>
It's unfortunate that the show is almost over, but all good things must come to an end, nya...<br>
Anyway! Allow me to introduce the last contestants, nya!<br>
The red team! The demon of legend, Nyotengu!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Nyotengu：</span><br>
Hehehe, I've been waiting for this moment.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Akashi：</span><br>
The blue team, chosen by the Commander, is none other than... Oh my, nya! The rising stars of the Sakura Empire, Shoukaku and Zuikaku, of the 5th Carrier Divison!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Mikasa：</span><br>
Shoukaku, Zuikaku, this is your moment!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Zuikaku：</span><br>
Oh, nice! So this is the demon of legend, Nyotengu... Nothing we can't handle, though! It's nice to meet you, Miss Nyotengu!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Nyotengu：</span><br>
Hoh, what a lively one. Let us see if you live up to my expectations, hehehe.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Kaga：</span><br>
Shame that we're not the ones on stage, but we'll leave it to you. Don't let us down, 5th.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Akagi：</span><br>
To think I was passed over for them... Oh, Commander, you can be such a prankster sometimes~ Expect lots and lots of love and cuddles as my form of payback.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Shoukaku：</span><br>
Hah! I promise we won't let you down, great and honorable Akagi~<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Nyotengu：</span><br>
Hehehe. The sight of you Sakura Empire lasses brings me such nostalgia. Perhaps there is a bond that connects us. Now, entertain me!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">{namecode:96}&{namecode:95}：</span><br>
Let's go!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Akashi：</span><br>
Oh boy... Um, final round, start, nya!<br>

<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Nyotengu：</span><br>
Hehehe, that's not enough! That much won't do!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Shoukaku：</span><br>
The legends of her power were true after all... And she still isn't going all-out on us...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Zuikaku：</span><br>
Maybe not, but we haven't exhausted our bag of tricks just yet!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Nyotengu：</span><br>
Ooh, majestic... Just as Mikasa said, you young'uns don't disappoint!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">{namecode:96}&{namecode:95}：</span><br>
Hiii-yaaaaaahhhhh!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Akashi：</span><br>
Aaand, stop!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Nyotengu：</span><br>
Hehe, you two did well. That battle made my heart dance with joy!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Shoukaku：</span><br>
I feel as though I'm about to keel over and die... Ugh...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Zuikaku：</span><br>
Ahaha, yeah, I'm dead tired. But... somehow, that felt refreshing.<br>
<br>
Nyotengu appears content, and Shoukaku and Zuikaku seem to have learned something from this battle. I'll have to thank Mikasa for her great advice.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Akashi：</span><br>
And that marks the end of our Special Venus Festival, nya! Everyone, great work, nya!<br>

Commander! There's a new message on the terminal!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Terminal：</span><br>
"All Missions complete. A teleportation device is being sent to Vacation Island at Coordinates (XXX,XXX)"<br>
<br>
Following the terminal's coordinates, we were able to find the teleportation device on Vacation Island.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Akashi：</span><br>
Even though there was nothing here before... This really must have only just appeared, nya...<br>
<br>
A new message flashes on the terminal.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Terminal：</span><br>
"Will you activate the teleportation device?  "<br>
<br>
Looks like it's time for us all to part ways.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Edinburgh：</span><br>
Waaah! Marie... Everyone... Please take careeee!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Marie Rose：</span><br>
Aww... Even though it's been a short stay, I had a really fun time with you all!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Honoka：</span><br>
Come on, Marie. The time for farewells is the time to put on your biggest smile. You're even making me... *sob*...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Kasumi：</span><br>
Thank you for all your help! Without you, we wouldn't be able to go back. I don't know how we can thank you enough...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Monica：</span><br>
Commander, everyone... I'd love to invite you all to the Venus Islands to show our gratitude, but...<br>
<br>
I'd accept it in a heartbeat.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Akashi：</span><br>
*stare*...<br>
<br>
I'm joking, of course.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Misaki：</span><br>
Akashi... Everyone... really, thank you so much for taking such good care of us! You too, Commander! ...Really, we owe you, bigtime!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Nagisa：</span><br>
Even though you've taken a lot of impure glances at Misaki... you worked hard for our sake, so... I'll forgive you, just this once... you silly dog.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Nyotengu：</span><br>
Everyone must part ways some day, but our bond shall remain strong. Undoubtedly, we shall meet again sometime, hehehe.<br>
<br>
She's right, as sad as it is. We all must part ways some day...<br>
<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项1：Press <YES></span>'''''<br>

<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项1）</span>'''''The teleporter activates and glows brightly. Right after, an elliptical portal appears in front of the girls.<br>
<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项2）</span>'''''No matter how unwilling I was, I knew that we would have to say goodbye one day. And that day had come.<br>
<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项1：Press <YES></span>'''''<br>
<br>
I can't be gloomy now. Time to see them off with a smile.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Akashi：</span><br>
Hmm, what's this? Commander, the terminal has a new message, nya!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Terminal：</span><br>
"Teleporter activation complete. The teleporter will be active for a period of 7 hours every 168 hours. Note that only certain entities are able to travel through this portal."<br>
<br>
It can work on its own?!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Terminal：</span><br>
"Mission complete. Terminal deactivating. Have a pleasant vacation."<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Akashi：</span><br>
Oh... the terminal stopped working...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Marie Rose：</span><br>
Umm, then that means... we can come here anytime, right?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Honoka：</span><br>
Yep! I'm so happy that our farewell doesn't have to be forever...!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Kasumi：</span><br>
Heheh, looks like I have plenty of pleasant chats with the Sakura Empire girls to look forward to!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Monica：</span><br>
And I've still yet to make some high-stakes bets with all of you~♪<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Misaki：</span><br>
Isn't this great, sis?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Nagisa：</span><br>
I-I don't really care...! But, well, if you're happy, then I'm happy too.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Nyotengu：</span><br>
Hehehe. It would seem we still have much fun ahead of us.<br>
<br>
Through some stroke of luck, our vacation with our new friends just received a new lease on life.<br>

<span style="color:#ec5d53;">Observer ：</span><br>
Hahah, we've gotten the data we need for now.<br>
<span style="color:#ec5d53;">Tester：</span><br>
I must ask... Do we really get any meaningful data out of playing around like this?<br>
<span style="color:#ec5d53;">Observer ：</span><br>
Contact with different beings will inevitably cause some kind of change. Who knows, perhaps we will discover something interesting this way.<br>
<span style="color:#ec5d53;">Purifier ：</span><br>
Hey, has anyone seen my mind? I think I lost it somewhere while waiting for some action. All data collection and no play makes Purifier a dull girl.<br>
<span style="color:#ec5d53;">Tester：</span><br>
...<br>
<span style="color:#ec5d53;">Purifier ：</span><br>
So what did we learn? Beach volleyball? Is it really that fun?<br>
<span style="color:#ec5d53;">Observer ：</span><br>
Care to give it a try?<br>
<span style="color:#ec5d53;">Purifier ：</span><br>
...Never mind I asked. I think I'll stick to twiddling my thumbs for fun.<br>
