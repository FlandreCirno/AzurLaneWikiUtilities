Swept Away in the Moment<br>
<br>
Chapter 1 - Ready, Ladies!<br>
One day - Commander's Office<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Deutschland：</span><br>
Listen, you lowly animal! Let us throw a party!<br>
<br>
... I'm getting some serious deja vu right now.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Deutschland：</span><br>
Why? Because that dwarf of a queen said that "the Royal Navy hosts the most luxurious and dazzling parties, and no others can compare" ...?<br>
That girl has some nerve to pretend like the Iron Blood doesn't exist!<br>
And you will help plan the party! That's right, even a lowly animal such as you can have a moment in the limelight. You should feel honored!<br>
<br>
......<br>
And so it was decided that Iron Blood would be hosting the next party.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Admiral Graf Spee：</span><br>
Sorry for making you put up with my sister, Commander... But, thanks to you, the venue does look pretty nice.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Deutschland：</span><br>
For such a lowly animal, you've done fine work! Ahahaha! Hey, dwarf queen, wouldn't you say the Iron Blood knows how to throw a fine party?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Queen Elizabeth：</span><br>
Grrr... How insolent, taunting the Queen like this... But I will admit that the party does look decent, thanks to the aid of my servant!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Belfast：</span><br>
I must give my sincerest thanks to all the people of the Royal Navy that offered to help.<br>
Furthermore, I would like to add that I'm honoured to be the head of the security team for the party venue.<br>
Ark Royal deserves special praise for her willingness to volunteer, thus saving us a lot of trouble.<br>
<br>
Ark Royal...?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ark Royal：</span><br>
Ahh... destroyers in cute dresses... No, I can't let my mind wander! For now, I must focus on my security duties...!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Everybody：</span><br>
......<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Deutschland：</span><br>
A-anyway! Do enjoy yourselves at our party today!<br>

<br>
Chapter 2 - Prost!<br>
Now, as for the ways to enjoy oneself at this party...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Prinz Eugen：</span><br>
Hehehe... I've been saving all these drinks just for this occasion. Today, I can drink as much as I please.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Tirpitz：</span><br>
Eugen, isn't that a little overboard? Soon you'll make a habit of drinking yourself senseless...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ooshio：</span><br>
My sisters did say ya like to drink a whole bunch, but wow...<br>
Didn't really believe it till I saw it, I suppose~<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Jean Bart：</span><br>
What's the big deal? I'd also rather have as much as I want than be tied down by some arbitrary code of conduct and not even be able to enjoy a glass.<br>
Honestly, I like how sensible the Iron Blood is when it comes to this kinda stuff.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Prinz Eugen：</span><br>
Haha, I'm delighted that we're in agreement. Say, would you be interested in some of this?<br>
The Vichya Dominion makes fine liquor, but it wouldn't hurt to try what the Iron Blood has to offer.<br>
And you... Ooshio, was it? How about a drink?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Jean Bart：</span><br>
Good point. I wouldn't mind a taste.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ooshio：</span><br>
I'd be right happy to~<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Tirpitz：</span><br>
Hm... I must say, I never imagined I would feel at home in a situation like this.<br>
That is, drinking with good company simply to have a good time, rather than to be polite...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Prinz Eugen：</span><br>
Oh, Tirpitz, what are you saying? Stop sweating the small stuff and just knock back a glass.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Tirpitz：</span><br>
Hm... You're right. I'll try not to think too much.<br>

Swept Away in the Moment<br>
<br>
Other Ways To Have Fun<br>
Of course, drinking wasn't the only way to enjoy oneself at the party...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Yuudachi：</span><br>
Meat! Yummy yummy meat! Om nom nom nom! Ahhh, I'm in carnivore heaven!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Shoukaku：</span><br>
... *Sigh*, when Yuudachi sees meat, not even her shadow can keep up with her...<br>
And where might Taihou have gone off to? Everybody's just concerned with themselves today...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">U-556：</span><br>
I've spotted a lone U-47!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Z23：</span><br>
Why are you sitting here alone, U-47? I know you didn't volunteer to help set up the party, but shouldn't you at least be celebrating together with everyone else?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">U-47：</span><br>
... Don't wanna socialize, so I'll pass. You can have fun without me.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">U-556：</span><br>
What?! Haven't you heard the phrase "the more, the merrier"? C'mon, let's head to the buffet tables and get something good to eat!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Z23：</span><br>
Good idea! And let's say hello to a few guests from the other factions along the way!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">U-47：</span><br>
*Sigh*... I was perfectly fine with just staying here...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">U-556：</span><br>
Don't be like that! C'mon!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Roon：</span><br>
It really is wonderful that we can have such a heartwarming party and have such fun together...<br>
But... it doesn't feel quite thrilling enough...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Seattle：</span><br>
Ey, Roon, what's up? You look, like, soooo bored, like you haven't had any fun all day.<br>
I mean, your own peeps are hosting this time, so isn't it fine to just kick it?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Roon：</span><br>
... Oh, hello, Seattle and Ibuki. How lovely to see you here~<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ibuki：</span><br>
H-hello, Miss Roon... Forgive me, this is my first time attending one of these "parties..."<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Seattle：</span><br>
Don't you worry about that, Ibuki! All you need to know is: parties are for partying!<br>
So, like, don't overthink things and just do what you wanna do!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Roon：</span><br>
You're right, Seattle~ Everyone has their way of enjoying a party. Say, could I ask you to give me a tour around the venue to see what's here?<br>

Swept Away in the Moment<br>
<br>
Classic Conclusion<br>
Although there are a few who were reluctant to join in, what matters is that everyone seems to be enjoying themselves.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Deutschland：</span><br>
Ahahahaha! What's the matter, dwarf queen? Are you left speechless by how perfect our party was?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Queen Elizabeth：</span><br>
You dare call me a dwarf?! Quite ironic, considering that you are hardly taller than a destroyer!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Deutschland：</span><br>
What did you just say?!<br>
<br>
It was astounding how they took such a petty quarrel so seriously.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Admiral Graf Spee：</span><br>
Deutschland! Don't start a fight with her!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Belfast：</span><br>
It is moving to see that you are on such amicable terms with one another.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Both：</span><br>
"Amicable?" Hah!<br>
<br>
It doesn't seem this quarrel will end on its own... I suppose it's time to send off the night.<br>
<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项1：With a bang.</span>'''''<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Both：</span><br>
What?!<br>
<br>
Whiiiiiish... ba-boom!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Both：</span><br>
Are those...?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Deutschland：</span><br>
... Ahahahahahaha! How's *that*? Do you see the dazzling fireworks my servant prepared?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Queen Elizabeth：</span><br>
Well... Not bad, but compared to the Royal Navy's fireworks, they're not any... Wait a moment, I recognize these from the summer festival!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Deutschland：</span><br>
Blast it! The jig is up!<br>
<br>
Good thing they let me have some of the leftovers from the fireworks workshop. I'll need to stop by Akashi's shop later to say my thanks.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Prinz Eugen：</span><br>
Looks like liquor tastes even better when watching fireworks.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Jean Bart：</span><br>
Et tu, Iron Blood... But, guess everyone's gotta be flashy when it matters.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">U-47：</span><br>
Too loud... Although the fireworks aren't shabby...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Roon：</span><br>
If only I could make the battlefield "light up" as beautifully as these fireworks do~<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Seattle：</span><br>
Ahaha, aha... What, like, literally?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Yuudachi：</span><br>
Shoukaku! Om nom... Look, fireworks!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Shoukaku：</span><br>
Yuudachi, please... don't talk with your mouth full.<br>
<br>
The dazzling sight of the fireworks was a fitting end to such a delightful party. Indeed, I hoped every party could be so invigorating.<br>
