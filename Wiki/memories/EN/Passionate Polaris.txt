Ancient legends spoke of sea monsters that sang enchanting songs to lure ships to their watery graves.<br>
They were named "Sirens," and they threatened the safety of the seas by dragging people to their demise.<br>
A number of people developed countermeasures in order to deal with these monsters.<br>
Orpheus, companion of the Argonauts, offset the Sirens' song with the melodies of his lyre.<br>
During the Great Era of Discovery, sailors sang to the figurehead of their ship to quell the fear within their hearts and pray for a safe voyage.<br>
These decorative figureheads, or idols, were so important to the peoples who would later become Iris Libre and the Sardegna Empire, that they were seen as pieces of art or even symbols of faith.<br>
These traditions have evolved and taken many different forms as they were passed down the ages...<br>
Indeed, the connection between music and sailing has remained strong in modernity, as evidenced by the naval bands of the Royal Navy, Iron Blood, and Eagle Union.<br>
When these idols made their way from West to East, they took on a completely different form within the unique culture of the Sakura Empire - a combination of mystery and glamor that would take the world by storm.<br>
And now, the fight against the Sirens continues to evolve, in the form of an experimental rigging that reflects the time-hallowed tethers between music and sailing...<br>
Azur Lane's new weapon to counter the encroaching Siren threat. Its name is...<br>
The µ-rigging, also known as the "Muse System."<br>
The experimental Muse System is about to enter its final stage of testing...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">？？？：</span><br>
...So, that's a pretty convincing backstory, nya. Right?<br>
<br>
Experimental Testing Facility (?)<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Akashi：</span><br>
Nya nya, testing, one... two...!<br>
Thanks to everyone who could make it to the our experimental armament final trial concert, nya!<br>
Here to guide you through this final data-collection live concert will be me, your master of ceremonies, Akashi nya! Thank you, thank you, nya!<br>
First, some of you might be wondering what the Muse System is, nya! Akashi will kindly explain the details, nya!<br>
In short, the Muse System began as a proposal from the higher-ups to incorporate the power of music into our armaments, nya.<br>
I'm not sure why music was chosen as the theme to develop equipment around, but today's trial concert is aimed at gauging its performance, nya.<br>
What's the point of a concert, you say? Well, how should I put it, nya...<br>
You have music, nya! You have a bunch of cute girls, nya! There's only one logical thing to do, nya!<br>
And what you'll be seeing today are the results of everyone's enthusiasm, nya!<br>
Also, Yuubari said that she's "seen this concept plenty of times in anime so it probably works," nya.<br>
You might think that this was simply an idea to capitalize on a popular, successful genre, but you'd be wrong, nya! I'm not lying, nya!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Enterprise：</span><br>
So, in other words, "Polaris" is a randomly selected group of girls who are equipped with the Muse System, and you'd like them to conduct test battles against the rest of the fleet?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Saratoga：</span><br>
I'm finally going to have some competition! I'm getting all fired up!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Enterprise：</span><br>
I'm not sure how you go about mixing music and fighting... but it seems like idol culture is already quite popular around here.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Lexington：</span><br>
That's right~ You could feel everyone's excitement when we announced that there would be an idol concert event...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Enterprise：</span><br>
Good grief... What's going to happen here?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Cleveland μ：</span><br>
All right! Experimental Muse System testing unit, "Polaris," let's make sure to do our best!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Gascogne μ：</span><br>
Activating experimental armament testing protocol. Running directives to test the combat performance of Muse System.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Admiral Hipper μ：</span><br>
*sigh*... I hope this doesn't take long...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Akagi μ：</span><br>
(So this is the final trial run... I wonder if all the effort that's been put into this project will prove worthwhile...)<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Sheffield μ：</span><br>
This unit did not look very promising at first. It took a lot of practice to even muster a semblance of team unity.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Cleveland μ：</span><br>
W-well... None of us have done something like this before... Anyway, Gascogne, we'll follow your lead!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Gascogne μ：</span><br>
Acknowledged. Operation, begin.<br>

<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Akashi：</span><br>
Let's kick off the first day of Passion Fes, nya!<br>
Um, while the main goal of this event is to benchmark the performance of the Muse System compared to the other factions...<br>
There are two other data points that we are interested in collecting, nya!<br>
First, the equipment amplifies in power depending on the number of enemies defeated during a sortie. Hopefully we'll see how far we are able to push this functionality, nya!<br>
I've dubbed this the "Combo System," nya!<br>
In other words, the more victories you rack up in a row, the higher combo you'll be able to achieve, nya.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Cleveland μ：</span><br>
Conversely, if we're defeated even once, our combo count will reset, right?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Akashi：</span><br>
That's exactly right, nya! The next thing is fighting through song, nya!<br>
The Muse System is equipped with a special module that uses a lead's vocal feedback to affect a broad area, nya!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Admiral Hipper μ：</span><br>
A what? Lead's vocals?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Akashi：</span><br>
I was just talking about it, nya. You'll be singing while you fight. That's why it's the lead role, nya.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Akagi μ：</span><br>
Indeed. Although it is my wish that the spotlight shines only upon me, no matter where the stage is, there are some things that I cannot control.<br>
Since this is for also for the sake of our alliance, I'll wait until the end of this experiment.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Admiral Hipper μ：</span><br>
Huh? If you wanted the role so badly, why not just go for it?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Sheffield μ：</span><br>
That would not be productive for testing the Muse System's functionalities.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Gascogne μ：</span><br>
Analysis: This event is also an opportunity to perform in front of Master.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Cleveland μ：</span><br>
In any case... Let's resolve this by selecting a different lead for different areas!<br>
Who's up first?<br>
<br>
...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Cleveland μ：</span><br>
Fine, fine! In that case, I'll volunteer for it! Akashi, is that fine with you?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Akashi：</span><br>
Anyone will do, nya! Anyway, let's begin testing the rigging's performance right meow!<br>

<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ning Hai：</span><br>
It's finally time for us to make our grand debut! All right, slow and easy...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ping Hai：</span><br>
Sis, I'm hungry... Can I grab something to eat first?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ning Hai：</span><br>
Hey, hang in there a bit longer! If our concert goes well, I'll let you have as many pork buns as you can stomach!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ping Hai：</span><br>
As many as I can stomach...?! All right, I'll do it!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ning Hai：</span><br>
That's the spirit! We have to blow everyone away with our performance...!<br>
(We're representing the entire Dragon Empery! We can't afford to put on an unsightly performance that would cause everyone back home to lose face!)<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ping Hai：</span><br>
Sis, Polaris is here!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Cleveland μ：</span><br>
If I'm not mistaken... Umm, you two are the Dragon Sisters, right?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ning Hai：</span><br>
Well met, Polaris! We challenge you to a battle!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Admiral Hipper μ：</span><br>
All right, all right, let's get to work...<br>
Show us what you're made of, Dragon Sisters!<br>
I'll show you what happens when you underestimate our power!<br>

Laffey... is shleepy... I wanna go home...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Javelin：</span><br>
Ehh?! But we're only getting started! Get your act together, Laffey!<br>
Ah! Look, our opponents are over there!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ning Hai：</span><br>
The Muse System... packs a bigger punch than I expected...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ping Hai：</span><br>
Hang in there, sis...!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Javelin：</span><br>
Ugh... that new experimental rigging seems really powerful...<br>
But, Javelin didn't come here to lose! I'll always shine the brightest, no matter on the battlefield or on stage!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ning Hai：</span><br>
Well said, Javelin!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Javelin：</span><br>
Ehehe, thanks for the support~! Come on, Laffey, you too!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Laffey：</span><br>
Fine... I'll say the line...<br>
Laffey came from Usamin... Everyone, please give me lots of support... Actually, just a little support is fine...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Cleveland μ：</span><br>
Laffey, you're supposed to speak up when giving your self-introduction! Commander will be watching us as well~!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Laffey：</span><br>
Laffey... will do her best...! Let's get motivated...!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Sheffield μ：</span><br>
I do think there's something charming about a complete inability to get motivated though.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ping Hai：</span><br>
Ning Hai and I will be cheering for all of you!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Javelin：</span><br>
Polaris, let's dazzle the crowd!<br>

<br>
Meanwhile, in the stands...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Fu Shun：</span><br>
Woah, Ning Hai and Ping Hai totally blew my mind~ I've never seen such an exciting concert before! Am I dreaming? Someone pinch me~<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Chang Chun：</span><br>
Who knows, but that's a fairly normal reaction to a concert~<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">An Shan：</span><br>
They might not have said much, but you can tell how hard those two worked to get up on stage today.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Fu Shun：</span><br>
Chang Chun, should I grab the signing boards? They're gonna be worth good money after those two get rich and famous, hehe!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Tai Yuan：</span><br>
I don't think you should count your chickens before they hatch...<br>
Besides, getting signatures just so you can scalp them is kind of scummy...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Fu Shun：</span><br>
Fine, I'll shelf the idea until they actually get famous! Besides, I know Ning Hai wouldn't pass up an opportunity to sell these things!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Yat Sen：</span><br>
I never thought I'd see the day when the Dragon Empery stands on the same stage as all the other global powers...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">An Shan：</span><br>
Yat Sen...?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Yat Sen：</span><br>
Rather than fighting as warships, they're standing on stage as brightly-shining idols, capturing everyone's hearts...<br>
It's like a dream come true...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Gascogne μ：</span><br>
Concluding joint armament and singing testing protocols.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Cleveland μ：</span><br>
Hehe, that felt great! However, we're the ones who will be taking home the gold!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Akashi：</span><br>
The first round was full of excitement from the get-go, nya!<br>
I could feel the entire ocean sizzling with your passion, nya!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Javelin：</span><br>
Even though we lost, at least we got to show Commander and the others how hard we worked!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Laffey：</span><br>
Tactical victory pose...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ping Hai：</span><br>
Look, sis, An Shan and the others came out to see us!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ning Hai：</span><br>
They really did...!<br>
<br>
Meanwhile, after the first test concert, Akagi stood alone, silently looking at her Muse System.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Akagi μ：</span><br>
("The power of ideals..." So, this is the Muse System...)<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Admiral Hipper μ：</span><br>
Akagi? Did something happen?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Akagi μ：</span><br>
Nothing in particular. Let's head to the next venue.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Sheffield μ：</span><br>
...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Gascogne μ：</span><br>
"Ideals"... Everyone's "emotions"...<br>

Experimental Armament Testing Grounds<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Akashi：</span><br>
I heard the concert went on for quite some time. Is everyone all rested and resupplied, nya?<br>
No matter how excited you are about the performances, remember that you're here to test the new rigging, nya!<br>
For the next phase, I'll have someone help explain... Saratoga from the Eagle Union, nya!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Saratoga：</span><br>
The magical girl idol, Sister Sara, has arrived!<br>
Whether on the battlefield or on stage, I'll bewitch you with my magic! Good to see you, everyone~♪<br>
To be honest, I wanted to bring my sister along, but unleashing the forbidden Sara Double Trouble against your experimental rigging would be overkill!<br>
In other words, I'll be putting on a solo performance today...<br>
Just kidding! Joining me will be Zed, from the Iron Blood, and Ayanami, from the Sakura Empire!<br>
Sister Sara will be carefully checking the power of your new armaments, so look forward to it~♪<br>
Oh, Lexington! I'm glad you could make it, even if it's just as a spectator~♪<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Akashi：</span><br>
Professionals are truly terrifying! Her every movement and mannerism is perfect, nya!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Saratoga：</span><br>
Heheh, isn't it about time we got this show on the road?<br>
All right, let's start the music!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Gascogne μ：</span><br>
Recalibration based upon Saratoga's speech: Significant motivation differential detected between opponent and Polaris.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Admiral Hipper μ：</span><br>
Didn't I say that pros shouldn't be allowed at this event...? Combat effectiveness aside, there's no way we can compete with her stage presence.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Sheffield μ：</span><br>
Correct. However, combat effectiveness and performing skills are not the only things that matter.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Gascogne μ：</span><br>
Sheffield...?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Cleveland μ：</span><br>
Do we have some alternate win condition...?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Akagi μ：</span><br>
What should we do then?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Sheffield μ：</span><br>
We will take advantage of the moment the enemy's advantage seems insurmountable and...<br>
<br>
Sheffield pulled her microphone cable taut.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Sheffield μ：</span><br>
If you can't muster your own momentum, then you'll have to turn the enemy's against them.<br>

<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Dewey：</span><br>
Polaris, Saratoga, do your best!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Aylwin：</span><br>
Dewey, your skirt!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Dewey：</span><br>
Eek! S-sorry, I got a bit too excited there...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Aylwin：</span><br>
Don't worry, it's fine. We've all got to do our best to cheer everyone on, right?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Dewey：</span><br>
Yeah...! When I see Lexington cheering alongside us, it's as if energy keeps welling up from within me!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Aylwin：</span><br>
Ahh... I want to be able to dance on that stage too...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Admiral Hipper μ：</span><br>
Come to think of it, I've been wondering ever since our practice sessions began, but why did we get chosen for Polaris?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Sheffield μ：</span><br>
Hm? What do you mean by that?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Admiral Hipper μ：</span><br>
Aren't there several proper idols in the fleet? Many of them have ample musical experience, yet they chose a complete amateur like me.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Cleveland μ：</span><br>
That's a good point... but didn't Akashi say they chose at random?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Gascogne μ：</span><br>
Gascogne is equipped with modular protocols, allowing change of modes depending on the conditions. Assessment: Gascogne is very suitable for experimental armament trials.<br>
Furthermore, regarding vocals: It is possible to adjust external appearance and vocal range by fine-tuning the keel structure, which is beneficial to testing the relationship between ship structure and music.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Admiral Hipper μ：</span><br>
...I'm happy for you and I'm going to let you finish, but I don't think the rest of us can do stuff like that.<br>
Anyways, I'm not an expert on these matters like Bismarck, so I'm just speculating.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Akagi μ：</span><br>
Let's leave it at that. There's no point staying on this subject.<br>
Though some of us in the Sakura Empire were involved with the development of the Muse System, we had no control over the selection process.<br>
I have a feeling that the Muse System isn't the only thing being tested. We, as Polaris, are as well.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Sheffield μ：</span><br>
In short, we just have to keep things as they are.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Akagi μ：</span><br>
That's right. Let's focus on finishing our test run first, shall we?<br>
(That's right... This will determine whether or not the Muse System can be used on our ships...)<br>

<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ayanami：</span><br>
Akagi, and Polaris... We're not going to lose to you.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Z23：</span><br>
Miss Hipper! W-well met! L-let's do our best to successfully carry out this rigging test!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ayanami：</span><br>
Zed, your stage introduction...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Z23：</span><br>
Ah, that's right! Ahem! Here I go...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ayanami：</span><br>
"I'm the hardworking idol, Ayanami. I'm 120% energetic and cute, so keep your eyes on me!" ...Yes.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Z23：</span><br>
"My song is the Messiah, and my dance is the Undine. I am the idol, Z23, and I shall capture your adoration for all of eternity..."<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Admiral Hipper μ：</span><br>
...Who taught you that? Was it Z35 or Z36?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Z23：</span><br>
Ack?!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ayanami：</span><br>
Miss Saratoga... the operation has failed due to cringe.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Sheffield μ：</span><br>
...It looks like we won't even have to do anything. The venue's excitement level has already dropped three bars.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Saratoga：</span><br>
Calm down, Zed! You're too nervous! You can't allow yourself to get caught up in your opponent's pace while you're on stage!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Z23：</span><br>
I'm sorry...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ayanami：</span><br>
Don't worry, Zed.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Admiral Hipper μ：</span><br>
Well, at least the nerves seem to have eased up on both sides. We won't have to worry about that stuff now.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Cleveland μ：</span><br>
From here on out, we'll be getting to the actual performance and testing phase! Hehe, if you think we're still struggling to use our new equipment, you'll be in for a surprise!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Z23：</span><br>
Mhm! We'll do everything we can to ensure the trial run is as successful as possible!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ayanami：</span><br>
Long Island and I didn't pull an all-nighter studying idol performances for nothing... I'll show you the fruits of our research!<br>

<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ayanami：</span><br>
We lost, but... it was still fun.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Z23：</span><br>
Even if we ignore the Muse System, fighting while taking the stage performance aspect into consideration a departure from what we're used to.<br>
I felt like we were actually having fun with each other rather than battling as warships. As a result, I was able to push my limits further than usual.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Saratoga：</span><br>
Heheh! You have Sister Sara's special training to thank for that!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ayanami：</span><br>
Yes. Considering we were just two destroyers, we put up a very good fight.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Z23：</span><br>
Ayanami, let's go join up with Javelin and the others?<br>
Ah, everyone in Polaris, don't worry about us! Keep moving on to your next test!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Gascogne μ：</span><br>
Observation: In live combat, the performance of Muse System differs from default specifications.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Cleveland μ：</span><br>
Yeah, there's no doubt that fighting with the Muse System feels different. I'd say that it's a bit easier to use...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Sheffield μ：</span><br>
Agreed. There should be virtually no substantial differences in how our equipment handles.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Gascogne μ：</span><br>
Gascogne's combat operation patterns do not differ from specifications in trials and simulations.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Cleveland μ：</span><br>
Hmm, in other words, you haven't changed the way you fight, but you can still tell that the equipment handles differently?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Gascogne μ：</span><br>
Affirmative.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Admiral Hipper μ：</span><br>
What Gascogne said is convincing... This Muse System is fundamentally different from the regular equipment we use.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Akagi μ：</span><br>
...……<br>
(As I expected... As Kansen, our equipment does not vary significantly as long as it's constrained by our hull and core structure.)<br>
(Until today, the Muse System did not perform much differently from our normal equipment...)<br>
(That means that whatever phenomenon triggered this was not present before.)<br>
(In that case, what is the reason behind this phenomenon...? What was different about today?)<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Gascogne μ：</span><br>
The following information is highly speculative and may not be worthy of reference:<br>
When carrying out anti-Siren combat protocols, Gascogne's emotion module is often suppressed as much as possible in order to stabilize combat efficacy.<br>
In the previous test battle, the emotion module was suppressed as part of normal combat protocol.<br>
However, activity in emotion module was still significantly higher than normal.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Akagi μ：</span><br>
...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Cleveland μ：</span><br>
Sorry, but I didn't catch any of that...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Sheffield μ：</span><br>
In other words, you were having fun, right?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Admiral Hipper μ：</span><br>
You're way too roundabout with how you talk...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Gascogne μ：</span><br>
Offering apologies for my explanation method. "I'm sorry."<br>
However, in the event that activation of Gascogne's emotion module is necessary for the equipment testing...<br>
Please issue the command.<br>

<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Akashi：</span><br>
Polaris handily defeated the fearsome duo of Z23 and Ayanami, even though they were guided by Saratoga, nya! Can anyone stop their advance, nya?!<br>
We're quickly approaching the halfway point of our tests, but who will be next to face Polaris?<br>
I would have loved to reveal today's challenger in advance, but her sister put me under a strict NDA!<br>
Now, for the surprise you've all been waiting for, nya! For everyone watching from back home at the port, don't change the channel!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Cleveland μ：</span><br>
Mm, I'm pretty sure I know who it's going to be...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Sheffield μ：</span><br>
If you're referring to Miss Portland and Miss Indianapolis, they're back at the port.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Cleveland μ：</span><br>
Ehh?! I could've sworn it would be those two based on that description. Does someone else fit the bill?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Sheffield μ：</span><br>
Who knows? I'm not positive, but at least we can rule out the Portland sisters.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Cleveland μ：</span><br>
Then, who is it? Think, Cleveland, think...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Admiral Hipper μ：</span><br>
What good does it do worrying about that? Come on, let's get going.<br>
(It... it's probably that girl... Gah, I feel too ashamed to tell them though...)<br>

<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Z35：</span><br>
Ehh?! Funf isn't allowed to participate?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Comet：</span><br>
Yeah... Akashi said that she wasn't looking for people who already have prior on-stage experience...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Z36：</span><br>
Is this the fate of those who bear the cursed eye...?! Gahh, it's so frustrating!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Cygnet：</span><br>
Um, I reckon that since this is a port-wide event, they wanted to make it so those with no idol experience could participate on a level playing field.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Crescent：</span><br>
But don't you think it's a pity to ignore all the time and effort we've put into accumulating on-stage experience?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Z35：</span><br>
That's right~ What a waste of Funf's talent, the singing and dancing idol! Just kidding~♪<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Comet：</span><br>
Hmm, in that case, why don't we lend our expertise to those girls? Polaris has the Commander backing them up, but I'm sure the others could use some guidance.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Z36：</span><br>
Yeah! That's a great idea!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Crescent：</span><br>
I have no objections to that! I'm going to go support Javelin!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Z35：</span><br>
In that case, I'll go cheer on Zed!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Akagi μ：</span><br>
(Gascogne's emotion module... might be a good starting point.)<br>
(But how was that caused by this new equipment? The Muse System has not made such a dramatic difference upon my current state.)<br>
(I'm going to need more information...)<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Admiral Hipper μ：</span><br>
N-no way?!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Cleveland μ：</span><br>
Oh? What are you looking at?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Admiral Hipper μ：</span><br>
The Iron Blood's social media feed... Hey, who gave you permission to look over my shoulder?!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Cleveland μ：</span><br>
Ah, sorry 'bout that! I didn't see anything! Come to think of it, Juustagram has been blowing up recently, hasn't it?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Sheffield μ：</span><br>
Miss Saratoga advised the idols to pay more attention to their advertising, so this is likely a product of that.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Gascogne μ：</span><br>
Disclosure of personal information in a publicly visible setting cannot be determined as invalid.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Admiral Hipper μ：</span><br>
It's not that big of a deal, honestly. All you have to do is post some daily thoughts that aren't related to private or combat-related information.<br>
Gascogne, Akagi, have you two considered making Juustagram accounts? I'll show you how to use it.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Akagi μ：</span><br>
I'll consider your offer.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Gascogne μ：</span><br>

<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Admiral Graf Spee：</span><br>
That idol name is way too embarrassing... Plus, this isn't even a real battle, just a trial run for some new equipment, right?<br>

I feel you. It must be hard with that sister of yours...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Admiral Graf Spee：</span><br>
Deutschland absolutely insisted that I participate in this event... Hipper, did you volunteer for this?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Admiral Hipper μ：</span><br>
Hell no! Who'd want to do something embarrassing like this?! *sigh*... I just wish this would hurry up and end already...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Admiral Graf Spee：</span><br>
Ahaha... But you know, now that I'm doing this, I'm actually enjoying myself. You looked like you were having a great time earlier, too.<br>

Who the hell could have a great time doing this crap?!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Admiral Graf Spee：</span><br>
You know, it wouldn't hurt to be more honest with yourself... But anyhow, I'm your next opponent, right? Ready to do this?<br>

Ahaha, turns out I'm no match for you...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Admiral Hipper μ：</span><br>
To be honest, I never thought you'd come back after everything that happened.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Admiral Graf Spee：</span><br>
I'll take that as a compliment. You know what surprised me? I never would have expected Gascogne to participate in Polaris...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Gascogne μ：</span><br>
...?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Admiral Graf Spee：</span><br>
Um, well, I always thought that Gascogne and I had a lot in common.<br>
When I first arrived at port, I was prickly and on edge, always looking for a fight.<br>
Of course, the purpose of us Kansen is to fight, and I knew that very well.<br>
But there's more to life than fighting. If I never realized that, and kept being my old emotionless self, I wouldn't have been able to enjoy this event with everyone else.<br>
That's why it was a huge relief to see Gascogne enjoying herself alongside the rest of Polaris.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Gascogne μ：</span><br>
...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Admiral Graf Spee：</span><br>
Thanks to you, I was able to fight and sing harder than I ever thought was possible.<br>
I wonder if I was able to push the limits of your new rigging, even by just a little...?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Cleveland μ：</span><br>
That's true. The one thing that everyone has had in common today... is that they all had a good time.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Admiral Hipper μ：</span><br>
We hold exercises like these every day, and the fighting isn't really much different, but there's something about these concerts that changes the whole experience.<br>
Anyway, we've already come this far. Let's see things through to the end. Everyone's fine with that, I hope!<br>

As for the determination of whether or not to activate the emotion module during the test...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Le Téméraire：</span><br>
Um, I think it's fine not to worry about that right now. You're doing fine just the way you are.<br>
Isn't it better to just take everything in and enjoy yourself? I'm sure everyone else feels the same way, so you should try to show it!<br>

Come, come! Our concert-battles are about to come to an explosive finale, nya! We will soon be finished with the test runs for the Muse System, nya!<br>
Did everyone have a chance to pick up some merchandise during the downtime, nya? How about refilling your supplies, nya? If you want to step out for some fresh air, this would be the time do it, nya!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Everyone：</span><br>
We're ready!!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Akashi：</span><br>
All right, let's get on with the latter part of the show! Next, I'll be introducing your rival for this round, nya!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Fubuki：</span><br>
I'm the Special-Type Idol that's taking the world by snowstorm - Fubuki! My energetic performances will ring out more brilliantly than anyone else's!<br>
Wow, look at all the Special-type destroyers who've come out to cheer for me! Heyyy, Ayanami~! Inazuma, Ikazuchi~! I'll do my best~!<br>
By the way, Akatsuki! Remind Hibiki to buy an extra copy of my photo portrait for me~!<br>

Thanks for promoting my services, but you still need to finish your introduction, nya! But we're out of time! Next up is...<br>

Eldridge and the kitties... are in Idol Mode...<br>

Nya?! This is going to be the most exciting match yet! I can't wait for the next round to start, nya!<br>

Yes, Gascogne used to believe that the purpose of this event was to conduct armament trials.<br>
But I was mistaken. The purpose of this was not just to fight, but for everyone to have fun...!<br>
That's what... I have to also release my emotions, and enjoy myself with all my might!<br>

Meow meow... Fubuki, you can be the cluck cluck idol...<br>

Affirmative! I mean, yes... I did!<br>
I don't feel like just another warship setting off for battle. Being able to prepare for this performance with everyone, and then...<br>
Being able to bring smiles to everyone's faces through our songs and dances... makes me really happy as well!<br>

Looking at it from another angle, that must mean that our final opponent must be the toughest of them all!<br>

Heheh, some of you must be wondering why we haven't announced the last round's participants yet, nya.<br>
The reason is simple - Polaris won't be facing off against any new opponents...<br>
Instead, we're calling everyone from the previous rounds back onto the stage, nya!!<br>
The final round will be an all-out battle with everyone on stage, nya!<br>
Look sharp, Polaris, are you ready, nya?<br>
Just how far can we push the Muse System? The battle to find out begins right meow!<br>

<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Akagi μ：</span><br>
I think I understand the power behind this equipment.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Admiral Hipper μ：</span><br>
Hmm? Did you only realize it just now? ...To be honest, this equipment doesn't even feel like a significant upgrade compared to what we normally use.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Sheffield μ：</span><br>
Indeed. Although there are some slight differences in performance, there is no point in changing the fundamental framework of our equipment.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Cleveland μ：</span><br>
Well, there are only so many changes that can be made at one time. Our hulls somewhat limit what is possible...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Akagi μ：</span><br>
Your observations are both correct and incorrect.<br>
So far, we've used the Muse System for two primary purposes...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Admiral Hipper μ：</span><br>
First, we've used it as a "weapon" during tests and simulations.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Cleveland μ：</span><br>
Second, we've used it like we did today, to spread joy through music.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Sheffield μ：</span><br>
Comparing these two side by side, the second use has demonstrated significantly better performance, which means...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Akagi μ：</span><br>
That's right. The Muse System was not meant to be used by "warships," but rather by us as people. "Humans."<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Gascogne μ：</span><br>
...Plausibility of Akagi's hypothesis: High.<br>
Historical analysis shows that the Muse System was developed not to defeat Sirens, but rather to counteract the Sirens's song. Therefore, its functionality is not to serve as a weapon, but as an instrument.<br>
Anthropological analysis shows that playing musical instruments and enjoying music with good company are hallmarks of human emotion.<br>
Therefore, one can infer that that the strength of Muse System scales directly with the strength of one's emotions.<br>
Akagi, this concludes the analysis...!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Akagi μ：</span><br>
Gascogne...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Admiral Hipper μ：</span><br>
That's fine and all, but... What are we going to do next? You know that all the other girls will be going all out during the final battle.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Cleveland μ：</span><br>
Yeah, I think we've already established that. Right?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Sheffield μ：</span><br>
Indeed. To be frank, while we may describe these activities as "battles," there are no winners or losers because in the end, this is just an armament trial run.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Akagi μ：</span><br>
Similarly, there are no allies or enemies either.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Gascogne μ：</span><br>
Affirmative. We participated in this event as Polaris, a group of warships.<br>
But as "people" who experience emotions, we should not leave behind any regrets...<br>
Therefore, let us fight with all our might, and have fun at the same time!<br>

I wouldn't have it any other way!<br>

We've reached the Muse System's limit...! Singing protocol powering down...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Admiral Hipper μ：</span><br>
*gasp*... You're right... I don't think... I can go any further...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Fubuki：</span><br>
They're burning out...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Cleveland μ：</span><br>
Phew... that was enough thrill for a lifetime!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Eldridge：</span><br>
...Nya?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Akashi：</span><br>
Unyaaaaa! The whole venue is exploding in applause, nya!!<br>
The two sides seem to be evenly matched, and I'm not sure we can crown a winner just yet, nya!<br>
Hm? There's no need to crown a winner in the first place, nya? I just remembered, nya!<br>
It's not like I was trying to drum up drama on purpose, nya! This whole thing was an armament test in the first place, so it's just the battle format, nya!<br>
Ahem! We've finished collecting data on the Muse System, nya! We'll send everything over to the Naval Headquarters after a few days, nya!<br>
As for the performances... everyone's probably burnt out right now, so we'll save the reports until later... Sounds good, nya?<br>
However, any participants who want to continue their idol activities after today will be permitted to do so, nya!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Everyone：</span><br>
Yayyyy!!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Akashi：</span><br>
This way, we'll be able to enjoy everyone's cute outfits and wonderful music for a few more days, nya! Thanks for everything, nya!<br>
Hopefully one day, we'll have an event featuring all of our existing idols as well, nya! Look forward to it, nya!<br>
Thanks again for making this possible, nya!!<br>

Testing on the Muse System will probably still continue for a while.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Kaga：</span><br>
Indeed. Akagi, if you will it so, I can request a change in the testing personnel.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Akagi μ：</span><br>
That won't be necessary, Kaga.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Kaga：</span><br>
Akagi...?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Akagi μ：</span><br>
The Muse System has shown reliability in a live combat setting. Don't you think it would be a waste to not implement it?<br>
Besides, after I went through all this effort to get dolled up, it would be a shame if the Commander did not get to gaze upon me a bit longer... right?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Kaga：</span><br>
R-right...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Akagi μ：</span><br>
But, more importantly...<br>
I had a good time, Polaris. Hehe~<br>

"Orpheus played his lyre, and the Sirens were so engrossed with the beautiful melodies that they forgot to sing."<br>
What a heartwarming tale.<br>
In order to protect their beloved Argo from the Sirens, the human bravely overcame their hardships with the power of music...<br>
But of course, it was not the ship that was threatened by the Sirens' song, just the sailors on the ship.<br>
If they really cared about protecting the ship, wouldn't it have been better to tie themselves down, just like Odysseus?<br>
What would one expect of human resolve though?<br>
This story is just a tiny fragment, unrelated to the greater war. Nothing more than an insignificant little fragment.<br>
If you don't mind, could I ask you to continue to watch over them?<br>
