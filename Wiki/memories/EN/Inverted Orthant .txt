Taranto Harbor<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Littorio：</span><br>
So if I understand this right... you're offering to give our fleet a tour around one of your bases?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Prinz Eugen：</span><br>
Correct. As part of our agreement of cooperation and information sharing, we would love to have the Eternal Flagship as our esteemed guest.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Littorio：</span><br>
Why? This invitation comes very much out of nowhere.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Prinz Eugen：</span><br>
Does it? We just thought you could use a brief respite from your routine work. I'm sure it will prove a nice change of pace.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Littorio：</span><br>
Hmm, this location you've chosen... It was formerly occupied by Sirens. How did you manage to recapture it?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Prinz Eugen：</span><br>
Let's leave that as a surprise for when we get there.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Littorio：</span><br>
I see... Putting aside whether or not I can actually get permission from Veneto, you put forth an interesting proposal.<br>
However, the Eternal Flagship and I cannot leave the Méditerranée. We are needed here for important business.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Prinz Eugen：</span><br>
I hope you understand that Friedrich really wishes to meet the Eternal Flagship and her associates.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Littorio：</span><br>
Then how about a compromise? I can readily send someone to represent us.<br>
The person I have in mind is close to us, and very diligent, too.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Prinz Eugen：</span><br>
That will be fine. But you must be sure that the person you're sending can be trusted, as the research we're conducting at the base is top-secret.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Littorio：</span><br>
Do not worry, I know for a fact that my candidate wouldn't speak a word of it to anyone else.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Prinz Eugen：</span><br>
Perfect. Tell me when you're ready to depart. I'll be relaxing in the guest room meanwhile.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Carabiniere：</span><br>
Carabiniere, reporting for duty!<br>
You said you had orders for me, Lady Littorio?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Littorio：</span><br>
That, I do. Listen closely, Carabiniere. I have an important task for you.<br>

Iron Blood domain - Floating Fortress E2<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Peter Strasser：</span><br>
(The construction on the new Floating Fortress facility will complete momentarily.)<br>
(Right on time. Now we have an airfield platform. I wish we could've constructed an airship hangar too, but alas.)<br>
(I suppose combat-ready airships are still a ways off... Anyway, it's time to begin.)<br>
Heinrich, Weser, Z46, are you here?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Weser & Z46：</span><br>
Aye.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Peter Strasser：</span><br>
The Floating Fortress has gained a new facility. We have anti-air combat on our training agenda today.<br>
I've sent you instruction manuals on how to operate the facility. Don't forget to read them. One more thing...<br>
Along with our training, we will also test the new facility's functions. Assemble at Platform B3 in 3 hours after you've benchmarked your riggings.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Z46：</span><br>
Understood.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Weser：</span><br>
3 hours? All right. By the way, where's Heinrich?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Z46：</span><br>
To my knowledge, whenever she isn't in the recreation area, she's undergoing private training.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Weser：</span><br>
"Training," huh. I'd describe it more like "playing around," honestly.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Peter Strasser：</span><br>
Typical of her... You two, get your things in order and do as I've instructed. I will talk to Heinrich myself.<br>
<br>
Floating Fortress - Training Area F<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Prinz Heinrich：</span><br>
Armored ship, coming throoough!<br>
<br>
Prinz Heinrich, the P-class armored ship, weaves between buoys while firing at training targets. She is having a whale of a time.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Peter Strasser：</span><br>
(17 seconds for a single pass through the course, with a roughly 3 second delay between shots to realign sights while zipping around at high speed...)<br>
<br>
KABOOOOM!<br>
Heinrich's rigging, a massive mechanical beast affectionately nicknamed "Eisen," fires a volley with a thundering roar.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Prinz Heinrich：</span><br>
We did it! High five, Eisen!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Peter Strasser：</span><br>
(Her aim time is on the slow side, but it's a passing grade. Anyway, I'm not here to appraise her performance...)<br>
Heinrich. There you are.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Prinz Heinrich：</span><br>
Huh? Oh, hey, Strasser! While you're here, could you respawn all the targets for me?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Peter Strasser：</span><br>
What? Um, sure. Just a moment... There.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Prinz Heinrich：</span><br>
Oh boy, there they are again! I almost can't believe it!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Peter Strasser：</span><br>
Can't believe what? We use these targets all the time. What is there to be amazed about?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Prinz Heinrich：</span><br>
I can't believe they just work, you know? Don't you think it's incredible stuff?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Peter Strasser：</span><br>
Yes, I suppose. The Mirror Sea is a technological marvel.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Prinz Heinrich：</span><br>
Then let me be amazed, dangit! Anyway, thanks a bunch! Time to give it another run!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Peter Strasser：</span><br>
(This isn't what I came here for! Heinrich distracted me. Again.)<br>
Listen, before you do that, I must tell you about the test we have–<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Prinz Heinrich：</span><br>
We still need to nail these swerves to really impress everyone in our next battle! Let's go, Eisen!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Peter Strasser：</span><br>
(...It seems I must take a more blunt approach to get her attention.)<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Prinz Heinrich：</span><br>
Prinz Heinrich, setting sail! First target to the– Oof! Owch!<br>
<br>
Peter Strasser scrambles one of her aircraft and drops a miniature dummy round right onto Heinrich's head.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Prinz Heinrich：</span><br>
Hey! Oww! What the heck was that for?!<br>
<br>
Peter Strasser pulls out her pocket watch and looks at the hour hand before saying anything.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Prinz Heinrich：</span><br>
Oh dear, look at the time.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Peter Strasser：</span><br>
You refused to listen, so I had to get your attention somehow. We have training to do today at–<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Prinz Heinrich：</span><br>
Oh crap! THAT training! Come here, Eisen, we need to hurry to the maintenance area to get you in tip-top shape!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Peter Strasser：</span><br>
Remember, Platform B3! And don't be late.<br>

Floating Fortress - Platform B3<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Peter Strasser：</span><br>
Now, as you all know, the Fortress' airfield facility received an upgrade just today. We will conduct a test of its functions, and carry out routine anti-air training.<br>
The upgrade will not only make the training grounds more realistic, but also make the simulated enemy aircraft more like the Pawns they're based on.<br>
Additionally, we will be fighting Pawns modeled after ships from every major faction.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Weser：</span><br>
I've got a question. May I?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Peter Strasser：</span><br>
Go ahead.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Weser：</span><br>
Just want to make sure: in addition to the mass-produced Sirens, we'll be fighting doppelgangers of ships from Iron Blood, the Sakura Empire, and Sardegna?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Peter Strasser：</span><br>
That is correct.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Prinz Heinrich：</span><br>
Wait, we are?! Err, I mean... Yeah, we are! Even I knew that!<br>
You sure about this, though? It feels kinda wrong to use the data we have on our allies to create Pawns...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Peter Strasser：</span><br>
A live test using the latest available data is the most logical way to gauge how much better the upgrade made the airfield.<br>
You would know this if you'd actually read the briefing. I don't have the time to explain it in detail just for you.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Prinz Heinrich：</span><br>
Okay, that's fair...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Peter Strasser：</span><br>
Great that you understand. Any other questions?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Weser & Z46：</span><br>
- Nope.<br>
- None from me.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Peter Strasser：</span><br>
Good. Your objective for this training – or should I say, exercise – is simple: destroy all the targets in the area through any means.<br>
It's worth noting that I've increased the ammo impact parameter by 15% to better prepare you for the real deal. Keep that in mind.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Prinz Heinrich：</span><br>
Talk about Spartan training...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Peter Strasser：</span><br>
A hit suffered during practice may hurt, but better that than losing your life in a real battle.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Z46：</span><br>
We have already been through a multitude of realistic combat scenarios. This is simply another on the long list of them.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Prinz Heinrich：</span><br>
Well, if you say so, Z46... So! When are we starting? I'm raring to show off the fruits of my personal training!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Peter Strasser：</span><br>
It's lovely that you're so motivated, Heinrich. Then without further ado, our test of the facility starts–<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Prinz Heinrich：</span><br>
Time to shine, Eisen! Let's show these Pawns what we're made of!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Peter Strasser：</span><br>
...now.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Weser：</span><br>
Always off before the starting shot, that girl.<br>

Heinrich, do you copy?<br>

Loud and clear!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Peter Strasser：</span><br>
The enemy aircraft have changed their attack pattern. Are you en route to the airfield?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Prinz Heinrich：</span><br>
Yep-yep! Headed there to take out some stray enemies!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Peter Strasser：</span><br>
Hold. Before you enter battle, first check the Stronghold's Control status so you don't get blindsided by enemy aircraft.<br>

<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Peter Strasser：</span><br>
I've spotted the enemy's ambush fleet. It seems our primary target this time is the humanoid-type Conductor.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Prinz Heinrich：</span><br>
Gosh, they're just popping up all over the place this time. That upgrade really took our training to the next level, Strasser!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Peter Strasser：</span><br>
Yes, like the briefing said. If only you'd read it... Anyway, Weser and I will engage the aircraft. You go deal with the Conductor.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Prinz Heinrich：</span><br>
Okey-dokey! I'm gonna whoop her into Siren bratwurst!<br>
...Actually, quick question, what was the Conductor's gimmick, again?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Peter Strasser：</span><br>
You... You absolute scatterbrain! You don't know what the Conductor does?!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Prinz Heinrich：</span><br>
Hey, it's not my fault these Sirens have been total pushovers up till now! I sink 'em before they can even villainously introduce themselves!<br>
Anyway, uh... could I at least get a visual description?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Peter Strasser：</span><br>
*sigh*... Fine. The Siren with a 6-pronged rigging that makes it look a bit like an octopus? That's a Conductor.<br>
Now shoo, attack them already. I will not tolerate you wasting any more time than you already have.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Prinz Heinrich：</span><br>
Smasher, Scavenger, Conductor... Their names are all too similar! Can't we just change her entry in the database to "Octopus" and be done with it?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Peter Strasser：</span><br>
NO, YOU HALFWIT. Mein Gott... I'm closing the comms channel.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Prinz Heinrich：</span><br>
No need to get angry at me! Geez... Come on, Eisen! Time to turn that Siren into seafood!<br>

I'm baaack! That's those Sirens dealt with.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Weser：</span><br>
Oh, good job. We have some time until the next round of training, so go tune up your rigging until then.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Prinz Heinrich：</span><br>
Sure thing. Also, have you seen Strasser anywhere?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Z46：</span><br>
She said she wished to raise the difficulty of the simulation, then went off by herself.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Prinz Heinrich：</span><br>
Really? Hmm... Is it just me, or is there something different about Strasser today? She's been all excited about that upgrade to the Fortress.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Weser：</span><br>
Is she? She seems pretty much the same to me.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Z46：</span><br>
Agreed.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Prinz Heinrich：</span><br>
Yeah, well, my intuition tells me something funny's going on.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Weser：</span><br>
And when was the last time your intuition was right?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Prinz Heinrich：</span><br>
Never, I guess... Wait! It was right just today!<br>
Those ships who wouldn't answer our radio message? Pawns. Those ships who sent us garbled radio messages? Pawns! Those ships who attacked us out of nowhere? Pawns! All of them!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Z46：</span><br>
Your instincts are getting better.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Weser：</span><br>
What does it matter if whoever ambushes us is a Pawn or not?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Prinz Heinrich：</span><br>
I just realized something else! Them being Pawns explains why they fought so fiercely, too! It all makes sense now!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Weser：</span><br>
Exemplary observational skills, Watson. Another mystery solved.<br>

A Royal Navy fleet? Is Strasser adding more enemies into the mix just for fun?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Z46：</span><br>
Perhaps Heinrich is right. There is something unusual about her behavior.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Prinz Heinrich：</span><br>
Told you so! Speaking of, where even is Strasser? I didn't see her come back.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Weser：</span><br>
Apparently there was some weirdness going on with the comms, so she went to figure out what it was.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Prinz Heinrich：</span><br>
Really, huh? Geesh, being the test coordinator sure is tough...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Weser：</span><br>
Without her, our hold on the skies weakens too. Word of advice: try not to stray too far from the airspace under our control.<br>

Floating Fortress - D11 defense line<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Peter Strasser：</span><br>
(Weird... I looked over everything, but can't find anything wrong... Was it just some one-off glitch after all?)<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Prinz Heinrich：</span><br>
Yoohoo, Strasser! We're here.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Peter Strasser：</span><br>
Oh, hi. I do apologize for leaving you to fight without me.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Weser：</span><br>
We managed, so it's fine. This is meant to test our abilities anyway. So, were you able to find what caused all that weirdness?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Peter Strasser：</span><br>
It's safe to rule out a hardware malfunction, but that's all I can say. The problem may not lie with our comms equipment, but with the relay tower instead.<br>
I'll have the Manjuus take a look at it. What about your training? How did it go?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Z46：</span><br>
The enemy's formations, tactics, maneuvers... they all felt much more accurate to how real foes would behave.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Weser：</span><br>
Mhm. Those planes the Royal Navy used – are they Azur Lane's latest and greatest?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Peter Strasser：</span><br>
That they are. It took a bit of extra work to get the data for those. It'd be a shame not to put it to good use.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Weser：</span><br>
"Know yourself and the enemy, and victory will invariably be yours," to paraphrase a saying.<br>
Azur Lane, meanwhile, knows nothing about our aerial capabilities. Hell, they might even think it's our Achilles heel.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Peter Strasser：</span><br>
The more ignorant they are, the better. The fact also remains that ships with histories will plateau eventually.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Prinz Heinrich：</span><br>
So wait, were we assigned to this research facility basically just to ensure that all stays a secret?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Z46：</span><br>
Perhaps so...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Prinz Heinrich：</span><br>
I mean, using an abandoned Siren research facility AND a Mirror Sea generator is almost overkill to that end.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Z46：</span><br>
The Iron Blood has few ships that are truly blank slates historically. It is vital that their existence is kept confidential, thus mandating the use of Mirror Seas.<br>
And from the Mirror Seas come the Pawns, which we fight to improve ourselves.<br>
Amid the blue-purple seas, in a factory shrouded in darkness, our airwing grows mightier by each passing day...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Prinz Heinrich：</span><br>
Yeah, well, the Sirens built this place anyhow, so there's nothing wrong with us using it!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Z46：</span><br>
It bears mentioning that we aren't the first Iron Blood ships to do so.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Weser：</span><br>
This is news to me. Who were here before us?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Z46：</span><br>
That, I am not at liberty to say.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Prinz Heinrich：</span><br>
Oh come on! Don't set it up like that just to leave us high and dry!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Peter Strasser：</span><br>
……………………<br>
That means it's time for us to move to the next area, where Royal Navy Pawns are waiting for us.<br>

You're the boss! Let's go!<br>

No, those will have to wait until the evening. We may be short on time, but we'll work more efficiently after a break than if we recklessly push on.<br>

<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Weser：</span><br>
...They've left now. Is that communications glitch still bothering you, Peter?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Peter Strasser：</span><br>
Yes... This equipment is built on Siren technology. Interference like what we got shouldn't be possible. Unless...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Weser：</span><br>
Unless...?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Peter Strasser：</span><br>
Unless somebody tried to contact us. They may have been Sirens, or it may have been Azur Lane... But Azur Lane's tech isn't up to the task.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Weser：</span><br>
You won't ever catch a moment's rest if you worry all the time. I'll pursue some potential leads, you go get yourself something to eat.<br>

Open ocean - Unknown coordinates<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Kongou：</span><br>
Fog appearing out of nowhere in an unremarkable part of the ocean and engulfing our fleet. Sounds quite familiar, does it not?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Yamashiro：</span><br>
Without any idea of our heading, we'll get lost in no time... Wait, maybe our other instruments still work?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Shoukaku：</span><br>
Considering how abruptly that fog appeared, I believe we should expect to run into more anomalies shortly.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Zuikaku：</span><br>
I'll bet you anything that this is a Mirror Sea we're dealing with...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Yamashiro：</span><br>
A Mirror Sea?! Are you sure?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Zuikaku：</span><br>
I'm all but certain. The first thing we should try to do is find and destroy the Mirror Sea control unit to break free from it.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Kongou：</span><br>
There is another, simpler way: to keep sailing straight in one direction until we've broken past its boundary zone.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Zuikaku：</span><br>
True. That's what we've been doing up to now anyway.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Shoukaku：</span><br>
Gosh, it's almost like we were sent straight here to do Akagi's and Kaga's dirty work. They could've at least told us what we were getting into...<br>
I bet they sent us the long way because they wanted to hog all the honors for themselves...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Zuikaku：</span><br>
You know, we can use this path as an escape route in case things go awry!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Shoukaku：</span><br>
Ah yes, an escape route with a Siren-occupied zone smack-dab in the middle of it. How strange nobody discovered it until we did! I'm sure it's all a coincidence.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Zuikaku：</span><br>
Enough chatting. I've finished checking on the equipment.…………………<br>
Well, someone had to find it sooner or later! Better us than someone far less prepared for battle.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Kongou：</span><br>
Hmm, yes, my instruments are starting to go haywire. This is definitely a Mirror Sea.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Yamashiro：</span><br>
This is not my lucky day. Not lucky at all...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Shoukaku：</span><br>
That makes two of us. Okay, Zuikaku, before we–<br>
<br>
KABOOOOM!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Kongou：</span><br>
And like clockwork, here come the Sirens! It seems simply sailing out of here is not an option if they have anything to say about it!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Zuikaku：</span><br>
That leaves us with little choice but to fight! Get ready, folks!<br>

Floating Fortress - Area between D11 and D12 defense lines<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Peter Strasser：</span><br>
Z46, Heinrich.. The time is now. We will commence training.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Prinz Heinrich：</span><br>
We just have to defeat the Pawns' Sakura Empire and Iron Blood fleets, right?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Peter Strasser：</span><br>
That's right. However, such meager forces as you faced before would hardly classify as training, so I threw in some extra Pawns.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Prinz Heinrich：</span><br>
Heh, keep 'em coming! I'll knock down whatever you throw at me!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Peter Strasser：</span><br>
Brave words. We'll maintain the same formation we had this morning. Heinrich and Z46 in the Vanguard Fleet, Weser and I will be air support.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Everyone：</span><br>
Aye!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Peter Strasser：</span><br>
There's one more thing you should be mindful of.<br>
Because I haven't been able to ascertain the exact cause of the communication failure, I've raised the security level of the research facility just in case.<br>
Therefore, all defense areas beyond D12 are off limits.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Prinz Heinrich：</span><br>
So, we shouldn't enter them even to pursue a training target?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Peter Strasser：</span><br>
Don't make me repeat myself. Besides, past D13, even the mass-produced ships there are equipped with live ammunition. Anything that makes it through will quickly get turned to fine dust.<br>
I'm going to maintain these security measures at least until I can determine the source of the communication abnormality.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Weser：</span><br>
Live ammunition...? Are they programmed to attack all intruders indiscriminately?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Prinz Heinrich：</span><br>
Woah, isn't that overkill? What if an allied fleet happens to wander into the wrong neighborhood?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Peter Strasser：</span><br>
I have no plans to be anywhere near there, and I've already notified any relevant allies. In case someone does end up getting caught up, I trust you'll be able to clear out the mass-produced ships.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Prinz Heinrich：</span><br>
A true maestro of the battlefield! You've already thought everything out!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Peter Strasser：</span><br>
This is perfectly normal. Observers from the outside will see this as another Siren "Mirror Sea." If anything, it would be abnormal for them not to encounter any resistance.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Prinz Heinrich：</span><br>
Good point. Well, how about we get the show on the road then with this next exercise?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Weser：</span><br>
Can you try not being hyperactive for once?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Peter Strasser：</span><br>
...C'mon, we've wasted enough time here. Let's hurry it up!<br>

<br>
KABOOOOM!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Prinz Heinrich：</span><br>
That's the Akagi Pawn down!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Z46：</span><br>
The Jintsuu Pawn has been successfully eliminated.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Weser：</span><br>
Good. I've also eliminated the Sakura Pawns in this area. Shall we move to the next location?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Peter Strasser：</span><br>
...Wait, there are still more Sakura planes inbound.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Weser：</span><br>
If we've destroyed all the carrier Pawns, there shouldn't still be any operational aircraft. Did we miss something?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Peter Strasser：</span><br>
That shouldn't be possible... Wait, huh...?!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Weser：</span><br>
What happened?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Peter Strasser：</span><br>
That's not one of the Pawns that I set. It's using a live ammunition loader rather than training rounds!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Weser：</span><br>
I don't think any of the settings were wrong. Could the equipment in the Floating Fortress be malfunctioning?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Peter Strasser：</span><br>
Either a malfunction, or... No, that shouldn't be possible...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Prinz Heinrich：</span><br>
Strasser, you okay over there? Somehow, there's more Sakura aircraft...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Z46：</span><br>
The communication line is open.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Peter Strasser：</span><br>
For some reason, Pawns and mass-produced fleets are being deployed outside of D13. They're using live ammunition.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Prinz Heinrich：</span><br>
Ehh?! How the heck did that happen?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Weser：</span><br>
It shouldn't be possible, but our eyes aren't deceiving us. Not even Bismarck had an absolute understanding of Siren technology.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Peter Strasser：</span><br>
For the time being, these look just like the mass-produced ships being kept around the perimeter as anti-intruder countermeasures.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Prinz Heinrich：</span><br>
I see... So, what's the plan now?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Peter Strasser：</span><br>
We'll join up first. For the time being, we have to find this carrier Pawn and take care of it before it can damage the facility.<br>
Don't forget to swap out the training rounds for live ammunition.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Z46：</span><br>
Understood. Ending communication.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Prinz Heinrich：</span><br>
Yo, Eisen! We're gonna have a real battle on our hands! You ready for this?<br>

{{折叠面板|标题=Unexpected Retreat?|选项=13|主框=1|样式=primary|展开=是}}
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Peter Strasser：</span><br>
The Sakura aircraft broke formation and retreated. Did the routine module of the Pawn malfunction as well?<br>
It's impossible to track down all of them. Weser, were you able to locate the carrier?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Weser：</span><br>
I found an entire mass-produced Sakura fleet placed in an unplanned area, but there were no carriers present. Apparently, we're dealing with more than one device failure...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Peter Strasser：</span><br>
...I don't want to think too much about it, but... this must be Siren interference.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Weser：</span><br>
Yeah. Other than us, the only ones here that could operate the facilities here... would be the Sirens.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Peter Strasser：</span><br>
Inconceivable. The worst-case scenario is actually happening...<br>
I still have authorization over the D13 sector. Weser, are you able to effectively command the mass-produced ships?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Weser：</span><br>
Strasser, are you planning to...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Peter Strasser：</span><br>
Yes, you should already know. Hehehe... We'll see just who is the rightful owner of this research facility...!<br>
{{折叠面板|内容结束}}

<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Shoukaku：</span><br>
Those Iron Blood planes are pretty persistent... Zuikaku, should I keep trying to disrupt their formation?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Zuikaku：</span><br>
Yeah! Remember, we have the superior numbers here. Just pick them apart and capitalize on that advantage!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Shoukaku：</span><br>
Sounds good... But jeez, don't you think these planes are a bit too strong for Pawns to have...?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Zuikaku：</span><br>
Are you saying there's an actual Iron Blood carrier here...? But, Akagi should be with Graf Zeppelin over in Europa...<br>
Besides, why would an Iron Blood carrier randomly be attacking us out here?!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Shoukaku：</span><br>
Well you see, we encountered those Pawns imitating the Sakura fleet, right? Maybe the Iron Blood got us mixed up for those Pawns?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Kongou：</span><br>
I'm a bit concerned about where our fleet is headed. Do you think we've entered an even larger Mirror Sea after passing through the sea fog...?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Zuikaku：</span><br>
...I don't know what to make of all this. These strange buildings clearly point to this being a Siren research facility, but this isn't showing up anywhere in our navigation records...<br>
Kongou, do you know anything about these islands?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Kongou：</span><br>
Nothing at all. There shouldn't be any islands situated this densely together in the Southern hemisphere.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Yamashiro：</span><br>
Nuu, I don't want to get lost in a Mirror Sea... Kongou, what should we do?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Kongou：</span><br>
That won't happen. I'm sure that this Siren research facility is the source of both the sea fog and the Mirror Sea.<br>
If we are to have any strength left for the actual operation, we'll have to find a way out of here as quickly as possible.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Zuikaku：</span><br>
Kongou's exactly right. Sorry, Shoukaku. Looks like we'll need to prioritize shaking off the Iron Blood planes. Let's get out of the Mirror Sea first!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Kongou：</span><br>
Make sure to take note of the location and landmarks of these islands. We need to find out where we are, because we likely won't have another chance to scout this place out later.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Shoukaku：</span><br>
Understood! Just leave it to me!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Zuikaku：</span><br>
I'm counting on you, Shoukaku! Everyone else, get in diamond formation!<br>

Near the Iron Blood Floating Fortress<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">U-37：</span><br>
Welcome to the Iron Blood's secret base, the Floating Fortress! Maaan, am I glad I get to talk to someone instead of goin' on some dull mission!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Carabiniere：</span><br>
Are we at the right place? Sorry, but I don't see anything here that resembles a base...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Nürnberg：</span><br>
I think she's right... U-37, are you sure you didn't take the wrong route...?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Z28：</span><br>
Hmm, maybe the secret base is much smaller, like a clubhouse. With cute Meowfficers inside.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Z24：</span><br>
Keheheh... Only I can gaze through the veil of terror to grasp the truth writhing within the Darkness... Mere mortals cannot hope to match my omnipotent gaze!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Carabiniere：</span><br>
Wh-what? Veil of terror... Omnipotent gaze...?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Nürnberg：</span><br>
Oh, Z24, you know where the secret base is?!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Z24：</span><br>
Why, naturally! My eyes see all that lurks within the shadows. Such information would certainly not slip past me.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Z28：</span><br>
So... where is it?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Z24：</span><br>
However! Know that this is not a power that I dare to unleash, for the primordial knowledge of the Crimson Darkness is enough to drive one insane! Lest the Darkness totally consume the light, mere mortals must not–<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Prinz Eugen：</span><br>
So basically, you don't know anything.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Z24：</span><br>
P-Prinz Eugen?!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Prinz Eugen：</span><br>
The one and only. Heheh~<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Nürnberg：</span><br>
This area was formerly controlled by the Iron Blood, but we quickly lost it to the Sirens...<br>
Because this region has little strategic value and is located so far from our shipping lines, we've largely ignored it all this time.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Prinz Eugen：</span><br>
That sounds about right.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Nürnberg：</span><br>
Mm... About right? Did something happen after that?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">U-37：</span><br>
Heheh~ The secret base is right before your eyes. Ya just gotta know where to look.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Carabiniere：</span><br>
What kind of technology did you use to create a secret base like that...?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Prinz Eugen：</span><br>
That would be a trade secret, my little dragoon.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Carabiniere：</span><br>
O-of course, my apologies!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Prinz Eugen：</span><br>
...I'm just kidding. I extended an invitation to Sardegna specifically to show you this.<br>
However... seeing this in action may prove to be more informative than anything I can say.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">U-37：</span><br>
Psst, Eugen! What's the holdup? Weren't they gonna come out and meet us?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Prinz Eugen：</span><br>
They will, they're probably just getting ready. I didn't message them prior to our arrival since this place is top-secret.<br>
And if really need be, we can always just show ourselves in.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">U-37：</span><br>
Huh? You sure? Heard they've got an airfield facility inspection today...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Prinz Eugen：</span><br>
Isn't that even better? We'll also get to show off the Iron Blood's state-of-the-art training facillity.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Nürnberg：</span><br>
You have a point...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Z28：</span><br>
So this is the kind of person Prinz Eugen is...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Prinz Eugen：</span><br>
Ahem. U-37, can you lead us to the secret base?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">U-37：</span><br>
You got it! This base was made usin' the very islands in the ocean, and each individual section is its own part!<br>
But, can't talk too much right now! We'll be in big trouble if we trip the defense system. C'mon, on me!<br>

Floating Fortress C4<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Carabiniere：</span><br>
H-how did you conceal a base this massive?! Unless... Are you using Siren technology to create a Mirror Sea?!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Prinz Eugen：</span><br>
We are. It's our own private Mirror Sea.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Nürnberg：</span><br>
What are those...? Planes produced by the Mirror Sea?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Z24：</span><br>
Out of the way, mortal. I shall use my all-seeing eyes to verify... Yes, these are Sakura Empire aircraft.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">U-37：</span><br>
They're just planes launched by some mass-produced Pawns. We use 'em all the time for practice purposes, you see.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Carabiniere：</span><br>
Meaning, they're the same as what the Sirens have created... You must have Sardegnian Pawns too, don't you?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">U-37：</span><br>
Hey, we just use 'em as sparring partners, that's all! No funny business, promise!<br>
I mean, we fight our own mass-produced ships too. No big deal with fighting a couple of Sardegnian lookalikes while we're at it, right?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Carabiniere：</span><br>
Hmm... You make a good point! And, given that this is a Mirror Sea, the copies created are very accurate to their originals! I'm impressed!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Nürnberg：</span><br>
Speaking of the copies... They certainly are fighting fiercely. To an outsider, it looks more like a real battle than a training program...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">U-37：</span><br>
Right? Pretty sweet, huh? Hang on a sec... Do we usually use practice rounds this big? Doesn't look–<br>
<br>
KABOOOOM!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Z28：</span><br>
Eek! I think they fired that one at us on purpose!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Z24：</span><br>
What?! Those shapeshifting hunks of scrap would DARE threaten me, the Crimson Fiend? Why, I ought to–<br>
<br>
KABOOOOM!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Z24：</span><br>
Aaahh! Th-they really are shooting at us!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Carabiniere：</span><br>
D-does Iron Blood take their training THIS seriously?!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Prinz Eugen：</span><br>
Of course we do. Those shots were just feints meant to make the training more realistic.<br>
If we wouldn't go this far, how could we prepare for a real battle?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Carabiniere：</span><br>
Very interesting! I can't help but admire your dedication!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Nürnberg：</span><br>
(Goodness, Eugen really has a pokerface like nobody else does...)<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Z28：</span><br>
(And Carabiniere bought her lie without a moment's hesitation...)<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Prinz Eugen：</span><br>
U-37, take Z28 with you and lead our guest here to the Floating Fortress through the D13 backdoor route.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">U-37：</span><br>
Hang on a sec! How come you know about the backdoor route, huh?!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Prinz Eugen：</span><br>
I read the briefing, that's how. Now, could you do as I told you to? It's rude to keep our guest waiting.<br>
The training should be wrapping up by now. Z24, Nürnberg, you'll come with me.<br>
Now, let's see how high we can score on this training program they've got.<br>
{{折叠面板|内容结束}}

{{折叠面板|标题=The Equipment Issue|选项=17|主框=1|样式=primary|展开=是}}
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Peter Strasser：</span><br>
Iron Blood and Sardegnian mass-produced ships are coming our way. There'll be no end to them if we don't fix the malfunctioning equipment.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Weser：</span><br>
I wonder if there's maybe some way we can turn them against other?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Peter Strasser：</span><br>
There is. Our higher-ups did something like that a long time ago, when we first seized this research facility.<br>
However, it can only be done before a Pawn has been deployed. After that, there's no way to alter their behavior. At least not to our knowledge.<br>
If anyone has the ability to control who their targets are and where they're headed, it could only be the Sirens.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Weser：</span><br>
So if the Sirens feel like intervening, there's nothing we can do about it?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Peter Strasser：</span><br>
Yes, at least in the case of these Pawns and mass-produced ships. After all, the Sirens built the facilities that create them. We only "borrowed" them.<br>
But on the other hand, we injected our own software into the facility's control center. It should be safe from any Siren hacking attempts.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Weser：</span><br>
Phew, at least then we're not completely screwed. We can still get control back over some facilities.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Peter Strasser：</span><br>
Correct. If we couldn't, then I would be ordering everyone to evacuate right now.<br>
Now, to buy ourselves some time to take control back, we need to do a little bit of cleaning.<br>

<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Prinz Heinrich：</span><br>
Strasser, do you read me? We're just about to arrive at the coordinates you sent!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Weser：</span><br>
We read you. Those Iron Blood Pawns apparently figured out what we're up to, so be quick.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Prinz Heinrich：</span><br>
Roger-dodger! Wait... Weser? Why didn't Strasser pick up?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Weser：</span><br>
She's getting ready for a battle with the mass-produced ships and Pawns, to put a stop to them. You'll follow my orders for the time being.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Prinz Heinrich：</span><br>
Oh, all right. Anyway, just gotta guide all the Pawns into the designated area, right? Easy enough!<br>
Hey, some Pawn-looking ship just turned up! Eisen, what do you think we should do?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Weser：</span><br>
And when was the last time your intuition was right?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Prinz Heinrich：</span><br>
Never, I guess... Wait! It was right just today!<br>
Those ships who wouldn't answer our radio message? Pawns. Those ships who sent us garbled radio messages? Pawns! Those ships who attacked us out of nowhere? Pawns! All of them!<br>
Right, let's give 'em a call and see for ourselves...<br>
<span style="color:#ec5d53;">通讯器：</span><br>
......<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Prinz Heinrich：</span><br>
No response. That about confirms that they're Pawns! Okey-dokey, let's go, Eisen!<br>

KABOOOOM!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Nürnberg：</span><br>
Enemy cannon fire! These don't seem to be ordinary practice rounds!<br>
What are they doing? They can't be using live ammunition in– Eeeek!<br>
<br>
KABOOOOM!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Z24：</span><br>
How foolish these Pawns are! Soon they shall learn why any and all that dare oppose me swiftly cease to be!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Nürnberg：</span><br>
C-calm down now, Z24! They're just practice dummies; they wouldn't use live ammo, and they've never attacked anyone out of nowhere before!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Z24：</span><br>
Then how do you explain them doing exactly that? Eugen, I demand an explanation!<br>
Eugen, where are you? Answer me!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Prinz Eugen：</span><br>
I thought I heard someone calling for me. What is it?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Nürnberg：</span><br>
Eugen? When did you get so far away?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Z24：</span><br>
What is going on in this place? These "practice dummies" just fired at us using live ammunition!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Prinz Eugen：</span><br>
Sorry, I need a bit more time on my end. I just got word from a Sakura fleet.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Z24：</span><br>
What...? There are Sakura ships here in the base that aren't just Pawns?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Prinz Eugen：</span><br>
Look, just keep doing evasive maneuvers for now. They won't hit you as long as you keep your distance.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Nürnberg：</span><br>
D-did you hear her? They're using live ammunition!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Prinz Eugen：</span><br>
Fine, lead them to my location then. I'll figure something out.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Z24：</span><br>
"Figure something out"? What is that supposed to mean?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Prinz Eugen：</span><br>
Just do as I say, okay? Focus on not getting hit.<br>

An impostor, calling ME a Pawn? How rich! Try hitting me, foolish mortal!<br>

Wait, Eugen?! What are you doing here?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Prinz Eugen：</span><br>
I've been trying to reach you this entire time, but I suppose our comms network is down.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Nürnberg：</span><br>
*pant*... *pant*... Why did you two continue fighting when we were trying to communicate with you?!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Prinz Eugen：</span><br>
Who knows... Once they get into the mood, they get tunnel vision. Or tunnel hearing, I suppose.<br>

You didn't answer my call in the first place, so I just assumed you were Pawns...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Nürnberg：</span><br>
Well, Z24 assumed the same of you. She was insistent that you were a Pawn after you didn't respond.<br>
...Hang on, on that note, how are we even chatting right now? Weren't the comms down up until just a minute ago?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Prinz Eugen：</span><br>
Perhaps a certain someone is jamming us, but the jamming stops being effective once we're in close enough proximity to each other.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Prinz Heinrich：</span><br>
Err, in any case, I'm sorry for shooting at you! I'll get in touch with Strasser and tell her not to launch an attack on this place!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Prinz Eugen：</span><br>
Wait, come again? What was that about Strasser attacking this place?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Prinz Heinrich：</span><br>
The Pawns and mass-produced ships around the research facility have run amok, and we're trying to round them up to defeat them all in one fell swoop, basically.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Prinz Eugen：</span><br>
Is that so? Now I get the full picture.<br>
Well, we have a plan of our own. You don't need to call Strasser, we'll just take it from here.<br>
However, you should get in touch with those Sakura Empire girls. Simply tell them we're not Pawns.<br>

The Sakura Empire and Iron Blood clone fleets have been rounded up at D13... Heinrich's done her part well.<br>
Wonder how Strasser's doing... Let's give her a call.<br>
Strasser, do you copy? How are things progressing on your end?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Peter Strasser：</span><br>
I've broken up the enemy forces and I'm headed to the control unit. I'm afraid I won't get there at the agreed-upon time, though.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Weser：</span><br>
I understand, that's fine. The plan is still the same though, right?<br>
As in: lead the Pawns and mass-produced ships to the designated area, launch the research facility's entire airwing, and take them all out?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Peter Strasser：</span><br>
Yes, the plan is still the same. This way, we'll see just what these airfield facilities is truly capable of. Hehehe...<br>

Testing, testing. One, two, three... Eugen, do you copy?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Prinz Eugen：</span><br>
Mhm, loud and clear. Stick with that communications equipment from here on out.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Zuikaku：</span><br>
Got it! anyway, the Sakura fleet is in position!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Prinz Eugen：</span><br>
Great, thanks for keeping me informed. While I'm at it, what do you think about our own custom-made communicators?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Zuikaku：</span><br>
It's amazing, honestly. Are you sure we can have it? It can't have been cheap to develop equipment that works in a Mirror Sea...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Prinz Eugen：</span><br>
Don't worry about the cost. Think of it as a little gift.<br>
Oh, and we'll pay you back at some point for helping us out in our time of need.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Zuikaku：</span><br>
No problem! I'll remember that you owe us one, though! Hahahaha!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Prinz Eugen：</span><br>
...There, that should do it for the Sakura fleet. Now, as you were saying?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">U-37：</span><br>
Sure enough, you were right, Eugen. The Mirror Sea's crawlin' with humanoid Sirens!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Prinz Eugen：</span><br>
They haven't discovered you, have they?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">U-37：</span><br>
Pfft! Who do ya take me for, some newbie diver with a scuba kit? I'm lookin' right at the Mirror Sea generator.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Prinz Eugen：</span><br>
Well, well, I'm impressed. Hold it there and wait for my signal.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">U-37：</span><br>
Gotcha. Just gonna chill out right here, pretend I'm doin' commerce raiding...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Z28：</span><br>
Things are progressing well on our end too, Eugen. We've managed to reclaim control over some parts of the airfield.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Prinz Eugen：</span><br>
Good. Keep going and reclaim control over the remaining Platforms. Strasser needs them for her plan to work.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Z28：</span><br>
Understood! We'll proceed over to the next airfield, then~<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Carabiniere：</span><br>
Miss Eugen, I've reclaimed administrative control over one of the airfields, just as you instructed.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Prinz Eugen：</span><br>
You have? Great. Being able to make such swift progress on your first try must be why you're the Eternal Flagship's retainer, I suppose.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Carabiniere：</span><br>
Why, but of course! I will do everything in my power to further Sardegna's goals and spread the glory of her name!<br>
I must say though, a training scenario centered around reclaiming control over a facility seized by Sirens? You must be preparing for just about everything...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Prinz Eugen：</span><br>
Well, not exactly. It's not a scenario, the Sirens really did seize the facility.<br>
We're in a bit of a tight situation right now, so we need whatever help we can get, even if that means involving you.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Carabiniere：</span><br>
...Wait, WHAT?! ARE YOU SERIOUS?!<br>
Err, I mean... I don't mind! You couldn't have foreseen the Sirens would invade, and if anything, I'm honored to get to see all the bits and bobs behind the scenes like this!<br>
And, uhh... We are allies, after all! Not to mention fellow shipgirls! It goes without saying that I would offer my assistance!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Prinz Eugen：</span><br>
Well, it's great that you're so reliable. Anyway, we're in trouble if the Sirens found out we took back control of that airfield, so could you remain there and wait for my signal?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Carabiniere：</span><br>
Absolutely! I will be on my guard!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Prinz Eugen：</span><br>
Now we just need Strasser to do her part. Victory is ours, assuming she manages to reclaim control over the research facility's mainframe...<br>
...Actually, not quite. Someone needs to lure out any Sirens in hiding that might try to sabotage us.<br>
Which will have to be me, I suppose. Not many other candidates.<br>
It's time to make them pay for the damage they did to us using that black Wisdom Cube...<br>
They've eluded punishment up to now... but that's about to change. Hehehe...<br>

<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Peter Strasser：</span><br>
Everything is ready on our end. How's it going with the Pawns in D13?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Weser：</span><br>
The Iron Blood and Sakura Empire clone fleets have joined forces. Doesn't seem there's any hope of getting them to take each other out.<br>
...Wait a minute. This is weird... One of the fleets of mass-produced ships just started moving. They're headed towards the Fortress.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Peter Strasser：</span><br>
The Fortress...? They're moving towards our top-secret facility?!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Weser：</span><br>
Seems so. I can deploy some reserve mass-produced units to try to stall them. It should keep them occupied, at least for a while.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Peter Strasser：</span><br>
...It just so happens I managed to regain control over the mainframe. If they're after our top-secret info, I'll send them to the bottom of the ocean in no time. <br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Weser：</span><br>
And the control over the airfields? Are we still good?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Peter Strasser：</span><br>
No problem there. By regaining control of the mainframe, I also regained control over all the airfields. We have all the firepower we could possibly need.<br>
Let us put them to the test... Command to airfields A1 through B3: scramble all aircraft, including support wings!<br>
Target: the Pawns and mass-produced ships in D13 that have run amok!<br>
Fly! Fly, and leave not a single atom of those malfunctioning machines!<br>

<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Prinz Eugen：</span><br>
Well, well, there they are.<br>
<br>
An enormous swarm of aircraft of Iron Blood, Sakura Empire, Sardegna, and Siren manufacture appear over the horizon, their formation so massive as to even block out the sky.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Prinz Eugen：</span><br>
Looks like she launched every single aircraft at our disposal. Strasser's really not messing around.<br>
I like her style, though she could learn a thing or two about exercising restraint. That's one thing Friedrich has that she doesn't.<br>
<br>
Shortly after the first planes arrive at the target and begin circling around, one of them loses control, then another, and another... They either waste their payloads, or crash into the sea.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Prinz Eugen：</span><br>
Seems she didn't know there was an Obstructor in the area. At this rate, we'll lose all our aircraft before we can even launch an attack.<br>
On the other hand... the Sirens must be pretty desperate if they're openly broadcasting the presence of one of their humanoid models in the area.<br>
Hehehe~ Impressive, Strasser. You've got the Sirens all but cornered.<br>
It's time to finish the job, as Friedrich ordered...<br>
U-37, do you read me?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">U-37：</span><br>
Yeah, I hear ya, Eugen. Whatcha need?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Prinz Eugen：</span><br>
Take aim on the device before you and fire every single torpedo you have right into it.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">U-37：</span><br>
Wait, whoa, whoa, what?! Ya want me to nuke this thing? But it's the secret facility's beatin' heart!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Prinz Eugen：</span><br>
I'm well aware. It also fell back into Siren control just like that. What good is a "secret" facility that the Sirens readily have access to?<br>
And besides, Sardegna and the Sakura Empire have gotten involved and know what's happening here. This base has served its purpose.<br>
Soon we'll wield the fruits of our research on Siren tech, and brandish Iron Blood's true power. Might just be useful in negotiations.<br>
So, do it. Blow it to smithereens while Strasser still has their attention.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">U-37：</span><br>
Well, if you're sure! Got it!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Prinz Eugen：</span><br>
Go ahead, Sirens. Make your next move.<br>

<span style="color:#ec5d53;">Compiler ：</span><br>
...What?!<br>
The Mirror Sea generator has been destroyed?!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Prinz Eugen：</span><br>
So you were the one pulling the strings this time, eh, "Compiler"?<br>
You meddled in Iron Blood affairs and interfered with important research. We're contractually entitled to punish you accordingly.<br>
<span style="color:#ec5d53;">Compiler ：</span><br>
...What gave me away?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Prinz Eugen：</span><br>
I knew something was up when Strasser didn't respond to my call. Then there's the fact she didn't get the message about not making any calls...<br>
But what really sealed the deal was the live ammo being used at defensive line 13. They would only ever switch from dummy rounds to live ammo if there was a serious emergency taking place.<br>
You might be a brilliant hacker, but you're a bad impersonator. You lack all subtlety.<br>
<span style="color:#ec5d53;">Compiler ：</span><br>
So that's that...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Prinz Eugen：</span><br>
Hmm. You're not a combat model like Purifier, are you?<br>
Strasser's seething attack forces are searching for you as we speak. What do you think would happen if I reported that you're here?<br>
<span style="color:#ec5d53;">Compiler ：</span><br>
Activating defense module. Powering up speed boosters. Cruising mode, initiate at 170% output. Commence overload mode...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Prinz Eugen：</span><br>
I put myself at risk so I could come see you in person, and you repay me by trying to run away?<br>
You're going nowhere.<br>

Floating Fortress - D12 defense line<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Z46：</span><br>
Look! The Mirror Sea!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Weser：</span><br>
It's... going away?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Peter Strasser：</span><br>
Oh, Eugen, what have you done... I never told you to destroy the generator.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Weser：</span><br>
Strasser, the identification signal's changed. The Sakura and Iron Blood shipgirls have all made it out.<br>
The readings I'm getting say the only ones still in the combat area are Eugen and a Siren... Compiler.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Peter Strasser：</span><br>
Them, plus additional stragglers in the form of some mass-produced ships.<br>
I am amazed. We lost control over our facilities due to the Sirens' jamming, and they then caused our stationed mass-produced units to go berserk...<br>
But then we turned the tables on them while they were still under the impression that we thought our own allies were Pawns.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Weser：</span><br>
We managed to reclaim control over the airfields and lead them into a carefully coordinated ambush to take them all out in one fell swoop...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Z46：</span><br>
The truth was hidden amongst falsehoods. You devised a brilliant plan in a very short amount of time.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Peter Strasser：</span><br>
When you're short on time, you must make effective use of what little you have.<br>
The unexplained communications anomaly, our inability to radio back to Europa, those mass-produced ships going haywire, and the Sakura fleet appearing from nowhere...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Z46：</span><br>
Those are all proof of the Sirens pulling strings behind the scenes.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Weser：</span><br>
They manipulated our comms and radar, too. We couldn't tell friend from foe or Pawn from the real deal.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Peter Strasser：</span><br>
And if we hadn't realized sooner, we might have actually fallen for the Sirens' scheme. But the stalling that kept them at D13 allowed us to launch an attack just in time.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Weser：</span><br>
It was all thanks to the antics of one person that the Sirens were sure they had us fooled up to the last minute...<br>
...It was thanks to Heinrich.<br>
I wonder if she actually knows how much she contributed, or if she even knows what happened at all.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Peter Strasser：</span><br>
Believe me, she's not as foolish as you may think.<br>
As for Compiler, she must be the brains behind this whole operation. She must've stayed in hiding and hoped that we would annihilate each other.<br>
It's possible that the only reason she hasn't scurried off already is because Heinrich upheld the illusion that we've turned on each other.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Z46：</span><br>
"To fool your foes, you must first fool your allies."<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Weser：</span><br>
Well, she played us like a fiddle, if that was her intention. Personally, I find it hard to believe that her brain is that galactic...<br>
...I'm picking up movements... Huh. The Siren's headed toward us, rather than trying to flee?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Peter Strasser：</span><br>
Toward the secret facility?! She must be stopped at any cost! Weser, if our comms are back online, then connect me to Eugen and everyone else in the area!<br>
Attention, all ships! This is Iron Blood carrier Peter Strasser! I request the assistance of all Iron Blood, Sardegna, and Sakura Empire forces in the area!<br>
Our research facility has been targeted by a Siren attack, and we fear that both mass-produced and humanoid Sirens are advancing toward us!<br>
The assets and research data we have at this facility are of immense value not just to Iron Blood, but to the Crimson Axis as a whole, and we cannot under any circumstances let them fall into Siren hands!<br>
Our fleet will now move out to intercept the Sirens and stop their operation dead in its tracks!<br>
To that end, we request the assistance of our allies... Scratch that, of all fellow shipgirls! <br>
Stop and destroy the Siren mastermind – Compiler!<br>

<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Prinz Eugen：</span><br>
I'm fine. But it's a shame. Had that Compiler been any slower, she would've been in the range of Strasser's airstrike.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Prinz Heinrich：</span><br>
Don't do that! You're gonna make Hipper worry about you!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Prinz Eugen：</span><br>
It's alright. If anything, you're usually the one we all worry about, so make sure you take the necessary precautions.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Prinz Heinrich：</span><br>
Hahaha! I guess I made Eisen worry about me. Sorry about that!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Prinz Eugen：</span><br>
Now, we go in pursuit of Compiler... That's the plan, right?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Prinz Heinrich：</span><br>
Yeah! Alriiight, Prinz Heinrich, heading out~!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Shoukaku：</span><br>
What a shock... To think that the Iron Blood had such an amazing facility, just tucked away like this...<br>
Also, there was that ship... the second ship of the Graf Zeppelin-class... I wonder how Akagi will react to this information.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Prinz Eugen：</span><br>
Strasser's been exclusively responsible for overseeing this secret base. Obviously, you all in the Sakura Empire wouldn't have heard of her.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Zuikaku：</span><br>
(Now that I think about it, the secret area in the Sakura Empire... I think Akagi called it the Sanctuary? I heard that was some kind of Mirror Sea as well.)<br>
(But this place gives off completely different vibes, and the Pawns there were made with some mysterious device in some kind of sculpting room, or whatever... I really don't know what to make of this.)<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Prinz Eugen：</span><br>
By the way, I never expected the Sakura Empire to find their way into this research facility.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Kongou：</span><br>
We ended up here because were sent the long away around, en route to NA Ocean.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Prinz Eugen：</span><br>
That's... quite the detour. You must be quite exhausted.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Zuikaku：</span><br>
(Quite the detour? Was Kongou right? That this place is far off course from the route we were supposed to take?)<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Prinz Eugen：</span><br>
Well, in the end, it doesn't really matter why you're here. Since you're our allies, feel free to stock up on supplies from our base.<br>
It'll be quite some time before you make it back on course, after all.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Kongou：</span><br>
Thank you for your assistance.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Prinz Eugen：</span><br>
Normally, I'd have invited you all to stay for a few days to show you the advances we've made with our technology, but unfortunately, I guess that's out of the question right now.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Zuikaku：</span><br>
We appreciate your sentiment! But you're right, we've still got things to take care of.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Prinz Eugen：</span><br>
Alright then. Like I said before, keep that communicator with you at all times.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Zuikaku：</span><br>
Thanks! We'll be able to communicate while in the Mirror Sea with these, right?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Prinz Eugen：</span><br>
Mhm, that's right. Also, there's one more thing.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Kongou：</span><br>
Hm...?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Prinz Eugen：</span><br>
"That thing should never make its way into the center of the Sirens."<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Shoukaku：</span><br>
That thing...? Center? Will something happen?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Prinz Eugen：</span><br>
Who knows? I don't know myself, so that's all I can really say.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Zuikaku：</span><br>
I see... thanks! We owe you one!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Prinz Eugen：</span><br>
It's none of my concern whether or not you listen to what I just told you, but I would prefer if you took that warning to heart.<br>

Though she had taken enough firepower to wipe out a fleet of regular mass-produced ships, Compiler's armor didn't have a single scratch on it.<br>
Heinrich landed a solid coordinated attack with her rigging, but unfortunately... it wasn't enough to have any effect on the barrier produced by Compiler's defense module.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Prinz Heinrich：</span><br>
She's... not taking any damage...?!<br>

<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Prinz Heinrich：</span><br>
Huh?!!!!<br>
<br>
The huge tentacles that were part of Compiler's rigging shot up from the water underneath Heinrich.<br>
Though she was barely able to dodge the tentacles, the seemingly weightless tentacles instantly turned to make another attack on her, putting her in a rough spot.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Prinz Heinrich：</span><br>
W-what is this...?! Waaah!!!<br>
<span style="color:#ec5d53;">Compiler：</span><br>

The time for your destruction has come, Compiler!<br>
<span style="color:#ec5d53;">Compiler ：</span><br>
Emergency detected. Rebooting shield.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Prinz Heinrich：</span><br>
Huh?! The barrier's coming back?!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Z24：</span><br>
Even after all that trouble we just went through...?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Nürnberg：</span><br>
And the main body is still unscathed... How...?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Kongou：</span><br>
My friends, it seems like you need a bit of extra firepower!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Zuikaku：</span><br>
It's too early to give up, guys! We'll back you up with our firepower!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Shoukaku：</span><br>
It would be a stain upon our honor if we just helped ourselves to your supplies while ignoring you in your time of need.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Yamashiro：</span><br>
I'll help out too!<br>
<br>
KABOOOOM!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Kongou：</span><br>
The barrier's down! Now's our chance!<br>
<span style="color:#ec5d53;">Compiler ：</span><br>
………………<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Prinz Heinrich：</span><br>
Eisen! Don't hold back! Fire!!!<br>
<span style="color:#ec5d53;">Compiler ：</span><br>
Movement module at max. Underwater mode—<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Prinz Heinrich：</span><br>
HUUUH?! Um, I mean, WHAAAAAT?!!!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Peter Strasser：</span><br>
What happened, Heinrich! We can't detect Compiler's location anymore!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Nürnberg：</span><br>
Compiler, uh... she went under water just like a submarine!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Prinz Heinrich：</span><br>
Are you saying she has rigging for both surface combat and underwater mobility?!<br>
<span style="color:#ec5d53;">Compiler：</span><br>
Farewell.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Prinz Heinrich：</span><br>
We'll lose track of her at this rate!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Prinz Eugen：</span><br>
U-37, looks like the rest is up to you. Do you think you can stop her in her tracks?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">U-37：</span><br>
I'm already in position! Heheh~ Time to show off what a deep-sea hunter is capable of!<br>

<span style="color:#4eb24e;">U-37：</span><br>
Stop right there, Compiler! It's time for a showdown, you and me!<br>
<span style="color:#ec5d53;">Compiler ：</span><br>
...An ambush.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">U-37：</span><br>
Never thought that you'd be able to move so quickly with that giant rigging of yours...<br>
But do you think you can outrun my torpedo?<br>
<span style="color:#ec5d53;">Compiler ：</span><br>
Armor is incapable of withstanding a direct hit.<br>
<span style="color:#ec5d53;">Purifier ：</span><br>
Oooh, I think you've been had, you subprogram, you~!<br>
<span style="color:#ec5d53;">Compiler ：</span><br>
Don't listen in on the emergency channel.<br>
<span style="color:#ec5d53;">Purifier ：</span><br>
Ah, don't be such a buzzkill, you! Just so you know, I'm here at Observer's behest to come get you. Were you able to get your hands on the sample?<br>
<span style="color:#ec5d53;">Compiler ：</span><br>
Yes. It was very troublesome to do so.<br>
<span style="color:#ec5d53;">Purifier ：</span><br>
One heck of a job you did there~ You can leave the rest to me, all right?<br>
<span style="color:#ec5d53;">Compiler ：</span><br>
I'm tired. Thanks for delivering the sample for me.<br>
<span style="color:#ec5d53;">Purifier ：</span><br>
Wait, you little!<br>
<span style="color:#ec5d53;">Compiler ：</span><br>
It's fragile, so be careful.<br>
<span style="color:#ec5d53;">Purifier ：</span><br>
Hmph! I can't believe I don't get to fight, ever!<br>
<br>
KABOOOOM!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">U-37：</span><br>
Huhhh?! The Siren exploded...?!<br>
But I didn't even get to land a single torpedo yet, damnit!<br>
Daaaaamn it———!!!<br>

Floating Fortress E2 - A few days later<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Prinz Heinrich：</span><br>
Alright, and that's it! That concludes today's tactics meeting! Thanks for having us, Strasser!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Peter Strasser：</span><br>
You do know it's only been 15 minutes since I've started to talk, don't you? I took time out of my precious schedule to go over this information with you. I won't let you escape until I'm done going over every... single... point.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Prinz Heinrich：</span><br>
But it feels like it's been 15 hours already... Why am I here, just to suffer...?<br>
Eugen, please come save me, before it's too late...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Peter Strasser：</span><br>
Eugen's in the classified facility. Besides, Eugen wouldn't be dumb enough to ask me to let you go anyway.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Prinz Heinrich：</span><br>
Et tu, Eugen?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Peter Strasser：</span><br>
I have to say though, I'm thoroughly disappointed with your attitude. Just when I was about to make you a focal part of the Iron Blood's main fleet, considering you potential.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Prinz Heinrich：</span><br>
Is it wrong to just want to fight? Why sweat the small details anyway!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Peter Strasser：</span><br>
As representatives of the Iron Blood, calling the enemies "octopus" and "cockroach" in front of our close allies stains our name.<br>
Though generous as I am, know that I have no problem taking time out of my busy schedule to... educate you. I'll have you know that my stern lectures are just as "informative" as Z23's.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Prinz Heinrich：</span><br>
Noooo! Never! Anything but that!! Reading boring books makes me all sleepy and stuff...<br>
At least give me something cool and action-packed!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Peter Strasser：</span><br>
I see. This must indeed be too easy for someone of your caliber. How about something on Graf Zeppelin's world view? It's a bit philosophical in nature, but...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Prinz Heinrich：</span><br>
I don't even know what you're talking about anymore!!!!!!<br>

Taranto Harbor<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Carabiniere：</span><br>
Over. That's the end of my report of my observations during my stay with the Iron Blood, Lady Littorio.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Littorio：</span><br>
Good work. You've been a great help.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Carabiniere：</span><br>
Lady Littorio, concerning the demonstration of the Iron Blood's new weapons and technology. How would you like for me to respond to their request for me to stay a bit longer to see them?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Littorio：</span><br>
If they're going to that length to show us what they've accomplished, it'd be rude to turn them down. Sorry, but would you mind staying there a bit longer?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Carabiniere：</span><br>
Yes ma'am! For the glory of the Sardegna Empire, I will undertake any mission!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Littorio：</span><br>
(The facility that was built in the Mirror Sea was attacked by the Sirens... Hmm)<br>
(I'm really curious to hear about the incident in person, but... I'm rather in shock over how overwhelming the Iron Blood's strength actually is.)<br>
(Mmmn... As the guiding voice of the Sardegna Empire, what should I do about this situation...)<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Conte di Cavour：</span><br>
Littorio, the delegation has arrived. Which one of you will head out to greet them?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Littorio：</span><br>
I'll head out. Make sure to let Veneto know as well.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Conte di Cavour：</span><br>
Understood.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Littorio：</span><br>
(Well, whatever. I can think about the more troublesome issues later.)<br>
(After all, today's a promising day. I'll have to greet the guest from far away properly.)<br>

<br>
Floating Fortress - Day of the Siren attack <br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Shoukaku：</span><br>
It's the Iron Blood fleet... The communication we received was from Prinz Eugen, wasn't it?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Kongou：</span><br>
This isn't a Pawn, is it? This entire zone is full of Pawns flying the colors of just about every faction, I can't tell who's real.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Zuikaku：</span><br>
I think it's the real deal this time...!<br>
Heavy cruiser Prinz Eugen... right?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Prinz Eugen：</span><br>
That's right. And you're Zuikaku of the Sakura Empire's 5th CarDiv, am I right?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Zuikaku：</span><br>
That you are.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Kongou：</span><br>
Was the Iron Blood caught up in the Mirror Sea like we were?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Prinz Eugen：</span><br>
I suppose you could say that. To be exact, it wasn't our fleet that got caught up by the Mirror Sea, but rather our facility.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Zuikaku：</span><br>
What a hassle... While we were sailing, some mysterious fog suddenly appeared, and by the time we knew it, we were stuck in the Mirror Sea.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Shoukaku：</span><br>
And even though we were right next to each other, it became harder and harder to contact each other. It was so hard for us to move anywhere...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Prinz Eugen：</span><br>
I'm aware. I also wasn't able to get in touch with anyone until I got this new communicator.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Zuikaku：</span><br>
Isn't there something bothering you about this whole situation?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Prinz Eugen：</span><br>
Naturally. Up until now, we've been able to contact each other at this distance with no issues. It's as if they were jamming our signals on purpose in order to make us fight each other.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Zuikaku：</span><br>
...Make us fight each other...? How would they pull that off?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Prinz Eugen：</span><br>
It's simple. Make a lot of Pawns of various shapes and sizes, and make it so that we can't contact each other from tactical distances.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Kongou：</span><br>
So basically, what you're saying is, they made it so we couldn't tell if the thing approaching us was an ally or a Pawn. The more cautious both sides are, the less receptive they would be of communication from the other side.<br>
In short, they wanted us to take each other out in a massive bout of "accidental" friendly fire... What a despicable plan!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Prinz Eugen：</span><br>
Fortunately for us, we still had an additional way to communicate despite their best efforts.<br>
If you use this, we can make sure we don't attack each other. The real problem is finding out the mastermind behind this plot.<br>
We've got a plan to find out who it is, but would you mind working with us to solve the mystery?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Zuikaku：</span><br>
Our goal's the same, so our answer should be obvious! Let's beat up the Sirens and get out of here already!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Prinz Eugen：</span><br>
Good. Thank you for your cooperation.<br>
First, there's someone in the Sakura Empire who I'd like you to give this communicator to——<br>

<br>
???<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Communicator：</span><br>
………………<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Prinz Eugen：</span><br>
Right, Friedrich. You used to play chess with Strasser quite often, isn't that right?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Communicator：</span><br>
………………<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Prinz Eugen：</span><br>
That's why you were able to recognize right away that it was her plan. I know I wouldn't have been able to.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Communicator：</span><br>
………………<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Prinz Eugen：</span><br>
I can't believe she tried to capture a Siren by using a Mirror Sea. Though, in the end, it was your plan to get rid of that Mirror Sea.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Communicator：</span><br>
………………<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Prinz Eugen：</span><br>
Don't be like that~ You're the one in the enviable position here. Not having to get your hands dirty, while being free to dream without any disturbances.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Communicator：</span><br>
………………<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Prinz Eugen：</span><br>
Oh by the way, did you want a souvenir? I'll have 556 or Tirpitz bring you something next time.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Communicator：</span><br>
………………<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Prinz Eugen：</span><br>
There's one thing I forgot to ask about. It's about the Sirens... no, rather, about the cubes. I just figured you'd be the most knowledgeable one on the subject.<br>
What do you know about "META?"<br>
