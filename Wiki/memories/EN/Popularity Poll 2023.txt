<br>
The polling venue glowed with vivid colors while passersby chatted and laughed. Four girls walked around, admiring the scene.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ayanami：</span><br>
Look how bustling this place is. I didn't expect people to get this fired up.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Javelin：</span><br>
I mean, of course they would! Everyone's aching to catch the Commander's eye!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Z23：</span><br>
She's right. Even I prepared for this. In my own way.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Laffey：</span><br>
You're running in the vote, too?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Z23：</span><br>
Yes! They're letting everyone participate so we can all have fun.<br>
Well, everyone except those already in the Hall of Fame, that is.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Laffey：</span><br>
Uh-huh... Zzzzz...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Javelin：</span><br>
Laffey, please! You can't sleep on the ground!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Laffey：</span><br>
Okay... Then I'll go home and sleep in my bed.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Javelin：</span><br>
And make sure you tuck in under the sheets, or you'll catch a cold.<br>
...Wait, no! Forget sleeping! You promised you'd look around the place with us today!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Laffey：</span><br>
Oh... Right, I almost forgot.<br>
I'll catch my z's later instead.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Z23：</span><br>
Great. So, where do we start?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ayanami：</span><br>
From what I've gathered, they've greatly expanded the polling venue this time. There'll be a lot more room to walk around.<br>
So, first of all, let's get our hands on the pamphlets they're distributing and work out the most logical route to take.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Z23：</span><br>
Agreed. Those pamphlets come with a map of the venue and the complete schedule.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Javelin：</span><br>
Aaand... where do we get those pamphlets?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ayanami：</span><br>
I'll get them. Prepare to witness the demon's power.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Javelin：</span><br>
*pant*... *pant*... Didn't think EVERYONE would be gunning for the pamphlets...<br>
At least we managed to get one copy. Great job, Ayanami.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ayanami：</span><br>
You're welcome. Now let's have a look at this strategy guide.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Z23：</span><br>
It's NOT a strategy guide. Anyway...<br>
It says the venue is divided into five parts.<br>
First, there are the missions right ahead of us. Completing those tasks is how we'll get our ballots.<br>
Then in the heart of the venue, there's the results board, which shows the current voting round and our respective rankings.<br>
It looks like the vote numbers update in real-time, too.<br>
What else... Ah, there are the booths for the main poll results and the Hall of Fame.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Laffey：</span><br>
There's one more place worth mentioning...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Z23：</span><br>
Right. That's the new special vote stage they're hosting for this year's poll.<br>
The main poll is divided into four categories – qualifiers, groups, repechages, and the finals, but there will also be intervals between these.<br>
And it's during these intervals when the special vote will be available as a sideshow.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ayanami：</span><br>
A... sideshow?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Z23：</span><br>
It doesn't elaborate beyond that... Should we go check it out and see what it's about?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ayanami：</span><br>
There is no question of "maybe." We will have a look-see.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Javelin：</span><br>
Then what are we waiting for? Let's go!<br>
{{折叠面板|内容结束}}

{{折叠面板|标题=The Qualifiers Stage|选项=2|主框=1|样式=primary|展开=是}}
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Javelin：</span><br>
This is the qualifiers voting stage, eh? Gosh, these lights are so bright...<br>
It's unbelievable that it's done already. Didn't they start construction, like, just the other day?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ayanami：</span><br>
Yes. This is what you call port speed.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Z23：</span><br>
...Huh?<br>
Uh, I'm sure the Commander's enthusiastic support for this event had something to do with it.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Laffey：</span><br>
Now I wanna partake in the vote, too.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Javelin：</span><br>
Speaking of voting, where's the voting box? I haven't seen it anywhere.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Z23：</span><br>
Nor have I seen ballots anywhere... There's a reason for that, actually.<br>
Akashi said it'd be impossible to count our ballots if we all vote at once, so they want us to use digital ballots instead of paper ones.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ayanami：</span><br>
Interesting. Bits and bytes are more convenient than pen and paper anyway.<br>
It's great not having to physically go to a ballot box to cast my vote.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Laffey：</span><br>
You could even vote from the comfort of your bed...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ayanami：</span><br>
But, you need to consider your strategy. Digital voting, by nature, is hidden from view.<br>
You can't determine how many votes someone has cast from a glance.<br>
This means you can't be sure if someone's going to win until time is officially up.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Javelin：</span><br>
So it's anyone's game until the last moment. That sounds so exciting!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Z23：</span><br>
There's also the fact that your ballots are only valid during the round you got them. You need to use them or you lose them.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Javelin：</span><br>
Hmm... Voting is more complicated than I thought. I'll have to weigh my options carefully!<br>

<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Z23：</span><br>
Here we are! The special vote stage is inside this building.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Javelin：</span><br>
Great! Let's go in!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ayanami：</span><br>
Hold your horses. I sense an ominous presence...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Javelin：</span><br>
What? Here? You can't be serious. What would be ominous about a polling area?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Laffey：</span><br>
Maybe it's haunted by losing candidates of the past...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Z23：</span><br>
I don't buy that for one second! Come on, let's go inside!<br>
<br>
The girls pushed open the door and walked inside. Nothing of note happened.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Laffey：</span><br>
No ghosts here.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Z23：</span><br>
See? Nothing to be afraid of.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ayanami：</span><br>
Maybe it's empty because the sideshow hasn't started yet.<br>
Let's come back later.<br>
{{折叠面板|内容结束}}

{{折叠面板|标题=Results Board|选项=4|主框=1|样式=primary|展开=是}}
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Laffey：</span><br>
There's the Results board...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ayanami：</span><br>
It's so big. And so high up.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Z23：</span><br>
It needs to be, in order to properly display all the important information.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Javelin：</span><br>
This should let us stay up to date, no matter where we are in the venue!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Z23：</span><br>
Yep. It'll help us keep track of what stage of voting it is, how many votes everyone has, and other good stuff to know as well.<br>
I'll bet some people are going to camp here to constantly monitor for updates.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Javelin：</span><br>
I can think of a few who'll do just that...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ayanami：</span><br>
Aoba and Alfredo, for sure.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Z23：</span><br>
Let's hope they won't cause a scene... Ahahah...<br>
{{折叠面板|内容结束}}

{{折叠面板|标题=Hall of Fame|选项=5|主框=1|样式=primary|展开=是}}
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Z23：</span><br>
Here is the much-renowned Hall of Fame!<br>
You'll find the winners of previous years enshrined here. It's also where this year's winners will receive their awards.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Javelin：</span><br>
Awards? Like, trophies?<br>
Heehee... Imagine if I win and the Commander gives me a trophy...<br>
"This is a wonderful day, Javelin. Do you know why? Because I get to give an award to a girl as cute as you."<br>
Gosh, that's so romantic... I can picture it now...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Z23：</span><br>
Uhh... Javelin? Are you still with us?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ayanami：</span><br>
Give her some time and she'll be back to normal. Eventually.<br>
{{折叠面板|内容结束}}

{{折叠面板|标题=Limited Missions|选项=6|主框=1|样式=primary|展开=是}}
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Javelin：</span><br>
This is the place where missions get turned into ballots!<br>
Do what's listed on the mission board, and they'll give you ballots to use in the vote!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Laffey：</span><br>
I want ten... thousand ballots.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Z23：</span><br>
Don't be silly, Laffey! You can't just ask for as many as you want!<br>
You'll need to follow the rules if you want to participate in the vote.<br>
Give that billboard a read. It's all laid out on there.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Laffey：</span><br>
So many rules... So many words... Too complicated.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Javelin：</span><br>
Boy, that's a lot of missions. There must be a lot of hard work behind every vote.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Z23：</span><br>
Yes, so you need to think hard and long before casting it.<br>
I get the feeling that they made these rules so complicated because they want you to think of each vote as precious.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Laffey：</span><br>
Okay... Then I just need a lot of ballots before I can vote on a whim.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Z23：</span><br>
How'd you reach THAT conclusion?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Laffey：</span><br>
This eradication mission looks good... Yoink.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Z23：</span><br>
Please don't run off on us just yet. We're supposed to look around the venue!<br>

<br>
As night fell upon the port, the excitement within the polling venue was only growing.<br>
People cheer and point while the big results board begins to glow with a soft light.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Laffey：</span><br>
The monitor turned on...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Z23：</span><br>
Does that mean the voting has officially started?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Javelin：</span><br>
Yup! This is where the fun begins!<br>
Ooh, I'm so excited! But a bit tense, too!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ayanami：</span><br>
Take it easy. Don't blow all your energy on the opening round.<br>
Why don't we take five and get some dinner? We can check the board after.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Z23：</span><br>
Great idea! The fine dining stalls just opened, too. Let's grab a bite then see what's up.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Laffey：</span><br>
Can I go and do my ballot missions?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Javelin：</span><br>
Laffey, please! You can do those tomorrow!<br>
{{折叠面板|内容结束}}

{{折叠面板|标题=Group Poll A|选项=8|主框=1|样式=primary|展开=是}}
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Javelin：</span><br>
Sheesh, the qualifiers were over in a flash...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ayanami：</span><br>
Yes, and the competition was relentless.<br>
But now the group polls are starting. This is where the real battle starts.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Javelin：</span><br>
I'm getting the feeling that everyone is determined to win!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Z23：</span><br>
Of course they are. Everyone who wins a group round goes straight to the finals.<br>
It's not the end of the world if you don't get your desired placing, though.<br>
The pamphlet says those who don't win the group rounds will still have a chance in the repechage round.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ayanami：</span><br>
Best of luck in the group polls, everyone!<br>
{{折叠面板|内容结束}}

{{折叠面板|标题=Special Vote I|选项=9|主框=1|样式=primary|展开=是}}
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Laffey：</span><br>
...Look! The special vote stage is glowing!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Javelin：</span><br>
Oh god! Don't tell me that's her!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Purifier?：</span><br>
......<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ayanami：</span><br>
It is! It's Purifier!<br>
<br>
Ayanami promptly drew her sword and swung at Purifier...<br>
But before her blade could connect, Purifier simply fell over with a thud.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Javelin：</span><br>
Look out! ...Wait, what?<br>
It's not the real deal after all... I think it's just a cardboard cutout.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Z23：</span><br>
This must be part of the "sideshow" the pamphlet talked about... I guess they're letting us vote for Sirens as well.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ayanami：</span><br>
That's interesting... I wonder if the Siren with the most of our votes will get special treatment in some way.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Laffey：</span><br>
I'll give a vote to Purifier.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Javelin：</span><br>
Then I'll do the same... No, wait! I need to think it over before I cast my vote!<br>
Speaking of which, check it out! There are tons more cutouts over here!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ayanami：</span><br>
Let's have a look and see who all the candidates are.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Z23：</span><br>
At least put the Purifier cutout back on its feet first!<br>
{{折叠面板|内容结束}}

{{折叠面板|标题=Group Poll B|选项=10|主框=1|样式=primary|展开=是}}
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Javelin：</span><br>
I'm back, and with parfaits for everyone!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ayanami：</span><br>
Thank you.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Z23：</span><br>
The group B vote is almost upon us. It came around quickly, didn't it?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Laffey：</span><br>
It sure feels like it...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Javelin：</span><br>
Time flies when you're having fun, that's why!<br>
By the way, do you know how many people from the group poll will advance to the finals?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Z23：</span><br>
Let me do the math... The rules state that the top five people from every group make it.<br>
Those in sixth place to fifteenth place, meanwhile, move on to the repechage round.<br>
There are four group polls all in all, so those plus the fifteen who win the repechage makes it a total of...<br>
Thirty-five people in the finals.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Javelin：</span><br>
Wow, that's a lot. The finals are gonna be so exciting!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Z23：</span><br>
Mhm. I can hardly wait to the finalist lineup.<br>
{{折叠面板|内容结束}}

{{折叠面板|标题=Special Vote II|选项=11|主框=1|样式=primary|展开=是}}
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Javelin：</span><br>
Looks like this vote is all about META shipgirls.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Z23：</span><br>
And not just METAs we see every day. There are some who don't live here.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Laffey：</span><br>
Imagine that...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ayanami：</span><br>
Do you think first place will appear at the award ceremony?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Javelin：</span><br>
I doubt it. The winning Siren didn't show up, did she?<br>
But on the off chance the winner does show up, the Commander can handle it!<br>
{{折叠面板|内容结束}}

{{折叠面板|标题=Group Poll C|选项=12|主框=1|样式=primary|展开=是}}
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Z23：</span><br>
The third group poll has started, which means we're officially halfway to the end.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ayanami：</span><br>
Everybody is redoubling their efforts to get more votes.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Laffey：</span><br>
Sounds like hard work...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Z23：</span><br>
It's not easy, that's for sure. Does anyone have any good ideas for getting more votes?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Javelin：</span><br>
Well, you could go and show the Commander your best side! Maybe that'd work?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ayanami：</span><br>
"Your best side"? How?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Javelin：</span><br>
First, you find the Commander, start chatting, then you just...<br>
......<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Z23：</span><br>
Just what?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Javelin：</span><br>
Err! I guess... You say something like, "My lovely Commander"...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Laffey：</span><br>
And then...?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Javelin：</span><br>
I dunno! I haven't thought that far!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ayanami：</span><br>
I see, I see. The idea is to curry favor from the Commander with a cute act.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Z23：</span><br>
That's probably not the way she meant it...<br>
Oh, hey! Someone's going up on the stage! I think there's a performance coming up!<br>
Let's go check it out!<br>
{{折叠面板|内容结束}}

{{折叠面板|标题=Special Vote III|选项=13|主框=1|样式=primary|展开=是}}
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Javelin：</span><br>
It looks like there are not just two, but three special votes.<br>
The Sirens were up first, then METAs. Who could be next?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Laffey：</span><br>
There's your answer...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Javelin：</span><br>
Oh! It's Little Bel!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ayanami：</span><br>
It's not just her. All the little ones are here.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Z23：</span><br>
They're so adorable it should be illegal to put them all in one place. I'm not surprised they made a polling round just for them.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Javelin：</span><br>
For once, TB doesn't need to simulate a promotional speech for a candidate. They promote themselves just by existing.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ayanami：</span><br>
Ugh. Thanks for reminding me of that horrific flurry of error messages she coughed up.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Javelin：</span><br>
Oops... Anyway, they're getting up on stage! Come on, let's go watch!<br>
{{折叠面板|内容结束}}

{{折叠面板|标题=Group Poll D|选项=14|主框=1|样式=primary|展开=是}}
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Javelin：</span><br>
The fourth group poll is underway! Finally – the last one!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ayanami：</span><br>
The excitement level is through the roof in here.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Javelin：</span><br>
Even our little sleepyhead can't help but enjoy herself! Isn't that right, Laffey?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Laffey：</span><br>
Mhm. There's lots of candy to eat here, so I'm having a good time.<br>
It would be even better if there was a quiet place to sleep, though...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Z23：</span><br>
You won't find any place quiet around here. Hahah...<br>
Ah, look! There's a crowd gathering around the main stage!<br>
We'd better hurry and find some vacant seats!<br>
