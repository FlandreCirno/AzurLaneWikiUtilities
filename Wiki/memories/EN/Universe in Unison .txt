A light that illuminates the way from up above. A star.<br>
Sometimes referred to as St. Elmo's fire, other times as Stella Maris, and even as an unnamed guiding light...<br>
According to legends passed down from yore, stars were beings of light or flame, ones that took ships and travelers alike under their protection.<br>
In return, people would pray and convey their feelings to the stars, raising songs of praise to the heavens above, in hopes they would reach their benefactors. <br>
This image of stars, bolstered by the imagination of people, elevated them to beloved, admired guides of light. They were idols to be revered, shining brightly, high up in the sky. <br>
Many stars besides Polaris shine brightly upon the sea. What kinds of hopes and dreams do these stars carry?<br>
Listen closely, my child. For your story is about to unfold... <br>

Port - Exercise Area<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Baltimore：</span><br>
Great, everyone's here. I'll use this moment to brief you all on our next mission.<br>
You might have an idea of what it's about from the title alone. "Operation: Muse System."<br>
As you already know, the Muse rigging is powered by musical energy. Its effectiveness was confirmed in the previous operation, in which the idol unit Polaris tested it out.<br>
This time around, the higher-ups wanted to set up multiple units of ships from different factions, all using the aforementioned rigging.<br>
Each team will perform acclimation exercises on their own, but there will be a competition... or rather, a joint exercise, afterward. The goal is to review the effectiveness of the new rigging.<br>
Basically, there will be other teams using the same... no, it's possible that other teams may have more powerful equipment than us.<br>
...Of course, there will also be units that do not utilize the Muse System.<br>
...They might ordinarily be our close friends, but for the moment, they are our worthy rivals. I'd like for all of you to make proper preparations so we can tackle this challenge head-on.<br>
<br>
These girls were about to take on an unprecedented operation. Tension rises as sparks fly through the air, as the hour of battle nears... Or so it should be, yet these girls do not appear to be affected at all.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Albacore：</span><br>
Baltimore, you're way too stiff! You don't have the vibe of an idol at all!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Tashkent：</span><br>
She's right. It says "Operation: Muse System" on paper, but this is just an excuse to do idol stuff, right? I don't think there's really any need to be so worked up about it.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Baltimore：</span><br>
I-I guess you're right... ahaha. Sorry, I guess I was a bit too nervous.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Illustrious：</span><br>
Akashi said much the same. That the flyers paint it as a military operation, but you're meant to read between the lines and take it as an opportunity to gather and perform.<br>
What I was told was, this is a huge event at the port, in which many people, us included, will be participating...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Dido：</span><br>
I heard the same from our head maid.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Albacore：</span><br>
Sounds about the same as what I heard. It's just I got my info from Sara.<br>
Everyone's pretty hyped up because it's supposed to be on a much larger scale compared to last time.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Tashkent：</span><br>
So I've heard, too. I assume that the Sakura Empire, Iron Blood, Iris Libre, and Sardegna Empire must have received the same information then.<br>
Then I suppose everyone's on the same page. But then, what was with Baltimore's explanation...?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Baltimore：</span><br>
I tried so hard to write it down as it was relayed... Well, whatever form it may take, it's still a mission from the higher-ups. If we do it half-heartedly, we're bound to fail spectacularly.<br>
Let's leave it at that, then... The reason I called you all together today was because I wanted all of us to do a basic check of our equipment, as well as conduct a simple exercise.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Illustrious：</span><br>
So, we're going to equip Muse riggings and participate in a simple combat exercise?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Albacore：</span><br>
Correct! Now that we've assembled, this'll be a good way to introduce ourselves to each other!~<br>
The rules of the competition state that we'll need to sing while fighting, so unless we can do both properly while on the stage, we're gonna be knocked out super early!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Illustrious：</span><br>
What a wonderful proposal. But, who shall be our opponents...?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Dido：</span><br>
What about some mass-produced ships? After we take on those, we could all use our new rigging to participate in the exercise.<br>
By the way, the head maid has already obtained Her Majesty's permission to use the mass-produced ships.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Illustrious：</span><br>
Her majesty is a sponsor for this live performance, after all.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Baltimore：</span><br>
So that's why these practice holo targets were pulled out...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Albacore：</span><br>
Holo targets?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Baltimore：</span><br>
Yeah. Holograms that look like us. While they aren't enemies that we can properly battle against, they'll be good opponents for exercises with our Muse rigging.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Tashkent：</span><br>
So I guess they're opponents that will help us get used to the stage.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Baltimore：</span><br>
That's right. You can not only perform drills for mock battles with them, but you can also play some music and have them perform.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Illustrious：</span><br>
I guess if we get outperformed by them, our pride will surely take a huge hit...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Dido：</span><br>
I-I think I'd receive orders to be scuttled for that...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Baltimore：</span><br>
So that's why these practice holo targets were pulled out...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Tashkent：</span><br>
...Well, I don't think there's any need to worry that much this early.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Albacore：</span><br>
That's right! Everyone, let's head over to the exercise area!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Dido：</span><br>
All right. Everyone, please follow me.<br>

Port - Exercise Area<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Dido µ：</span><br>
(So this is the Muse rigging... Equipment that utilizes the power of music and feelings... A precious item Master gave to me.)<br>
(I want to work hard so I can be useful to Master, but... will I be able to be a proper idol...? Oh no...)<br>
(If I were to fail, Master would no doubt abandon me...)<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Tashkent μ：</span><br>
What's wrong, Dido? You look like you've been fretting over something for quite some time now.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Dido µ：</span><br>
I-it's nothing, really.…<br>
It's just that, it's both amazing and terrifying that a mere maid like me is going to be an idol...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Tashkent μ：</span><br>
Is that so. The maid corps must have it hard, having to worry about things like that.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Dido µ：</span><br>
...Perhaps I'm simply overthinking it.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Tashkent μ：</span><br>
Whatever it is, if you're going to take part in it anyway, you just have to go with the flow. It's best not to worry too much about it.<br>
Though we're taking part in idol activities, in the end, it's just to test the Muse rigging. It might be better to just think of this like any other mission...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Baltimore μ：</span><br>
You're not the only one without any idea of what you're doing. I took a look at a video of Lexington's group's performance earlier to help me prepare, and it made me feel a bit uneasy...<br>
You know, wondering if it was possible for me to be as cute as they were, and all.<br>
That said, this is a chance that was given to me. If I'm going to participate anyway, I'll give it my best.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Illustrious μ：</span><br>
Yes, that's right. As idols, we've received a wonderful chance to spread love and peace to the world through song.<br>
Even Unicorn was looking forward to this, hehe.~<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Dido µ：</span><br>
Is Unicorn participating as well?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Illustrious μ：</span><br>
Yes. She seemed nervous about being alone, so I asked Vampire to help her out for a bit.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Tashkent μ：</span><br>
...So how many people from the different factions will be participating? The Northern Parliament wasn't on last time, so I'm not really sure what the situation is.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Albacore μ：</span><br>
Are you the only one from the Northern Parliament?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Tashkent μ：</span><br>
Yup. Also, the Iris Libre told me that they'd like for me to work extra hard on their behalf, and that they'd be participating individually.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Albacore μ：</span><br>
Grr...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Tashkent μ：</span><br>
Aren't you curious? About the other factions, and the teams, and such.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Baltimore μ：</span><br>
Of course I'm curious, but this isn't the time to be worrying about that stuff.<br>
All right, I'm all ready, let's get started. Muse System exercise, begin!<br>
{{折叠面板|内容结束}}

{{折叠面板|标题=Warship? Or Idol?|选项=4|主框=1|样式=primary|展开=是}}
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Baltimore μ：</span><br>
Whew... So that's what it feels like.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Illustrious μ：</span><br>
Good job, everyone.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Dido µ：</span><br>
How about we take a break for some biscuits? It so happens I brought some with me.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Albacore μ：</span><br>
Whoa, thanks a bunch! Tashkent, you want some? Or can I cop myself a second helping?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Tashkent μ：</span><br>
I-I'm going to have some too!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Baltimore μ：</span><br>
All right! Everyone, let's take a short break.<br>
<br>
……………<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Baltimore μ：</span><br>
It sure was a good idea to check out the rigging first.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Illustrious μ：</span><br>
It really was... Though we had no issues using the equipment, um...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Baltimore μ：</span><br>
I guess the problem is really the "idol" part.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Illustrious μ：</span><br>
The "idol" part...?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Baltimore μ：</span><br>
Yeah. Earlier, I was watching one of Polaris' previous concerts. With the way our coordination is right now, there's no way we'll be able to reach their level any time soon.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Dido µ：</span><br>
Here's a drink for you, Miss Illustrious, and one for you, Miss Baltimore.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Illustrious μ：</span><br>
Thank you. Oh, Dido. Can I ask you something?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Dido µ：</span><br>
And what might that be?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Illustrious μ：</span><br>
I know that Sheffield was part of the previous Muse System unit, so I was wondering: do you know what kinds of lessons they took to prepare for their performance?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Dido µ：</span><br>
Well, from what I've heard...<br>
<br>
……………<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Baltimore μ：</span><br>
I see. It's almost nothing like what I expected.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Albacore μ：</span><br>
I see. It's pretty much exactly what I expected.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Baltimore μ：</span><br>
Gah?! Albacore, when did you get here?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Albacore μ：</span><br>
I've been here the whole time, though? I was curious what you grownups were talking about.~<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Tashkent μ：</span><br>
Me, I'm not interested in it at all.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Albacore μ：</span><br>
Are you reaaally gonna be like that? Anyway, well? What do you want us to do, Baltimore?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Baltimore μ：</span><br>
If we want to catch up, we're going to need to pinpoint our strengths and weaknesses.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Dido µ：</span><br>
That sounds like a good idea. We need to look for places we struggle, both in and out of battle.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Baltimore μ：</span><br>
Well, I guess we have a plan now. Let's practice, er... rehearse, some more！<br>
{{折叠面板|内容结束}}

{{折叠面板|标题=Lesson Goals|选项=5|主框=1|样式=primary|展开=是}}
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Tashkent μ：</span><br>
(I think I've figured it out. The problems each member has.)<br>
(Baltimore worries that she's out of place, because she's not cute enough to be an idol.)<br>
(Illustrious isn't particularly good at dancing, and doesn't get what being an idol entails.)<br>
(Albacore... It's too hard for everyone else to keep up with her brain's RPM.)<br>
(And Dido... has no confidence in herself, whatsoever.)<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Albacore μ：</span><br>
And Tashkent is so focused on work, she's not having any fun~<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Tashkent μ：</span><br>
Wah?!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Albacore μ：</span><br>
Oops. Sorry, I wasn't trying to surprise you... So, you're taking notes on all of us, I see?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Tashkent μ：</span><br>
I thought they'd be useful for our lessons. I was planning on sharing them with Baltimore as well.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Albacore μ：</span><br>
All righty then. Think I could ask you a favor?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Tashkent μ：</span><br>
...A favor?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Albacore μ：</span><br>
Yep! I was wondering if you could look into lesson plans and into other units for me.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Tashkent μ：</span><br>
Can't you do that yourself? Everyone knows your specialty lies in sneaky information-gathering.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Albacore μ：</span><br>
And that's exactly why everyone is on guard whenever I'm around.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Tashkent μ：</span><br>
Is that so...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Baltimore μ：</span><br>
Just so you know, gathering intel is fine and dandy, but don't you go around pulling pranks on others.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Tashkent μ：</span><br>
I see that you're a worrywart. Fret not, of course I know that much.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Baltimore μ：</span><br>
No, it's more because sometimes, Albacore messes with others without ever being found out...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Dido µ：</span><br>
If it wouldn't be a bother, would you mind if I helped out as well?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Illustrious μ：</span><br>
I can help ask around with the Royal Navy girls as well.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Baltimore μ：</span><br>
Thanks, you'd both be doing us a huge service. All right, let's head out!<br>
{{折叠面板|内容结束}}

{{折叠面板|标题=Survey on Idols|选项=6|主框=1|样式=primary|展开=是}}
<br>
The girls have begun preparing for the competition, also called the Muse System joint exercise...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Baltimore μ：</span><br>
(First, the lessons. Not only do I have to get used to this new equipment, but I also need to learn the various skills an idol must have.)<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Gridley：</span><br>
Here you go! You were looking for "Saratoga's Special Video Sessions: Vocal Lessons Vol. 1-15," right? Please watch them together with everyone.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Baltimore μ：</span><br>
Yeah, thanks. My unit's performance depends on it, after all.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Gridley：</span><br>
It'd be great if you could spread the word of Saratoga's greatness while you're at it, too!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Princeton ：</span><br>
Are you trying to learn the way Saratoga fights as well, Baltimore...?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Baltimore μ：</span><br>
(I feel like there's a misunderstanding brewing...)<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Sheffield μ：</span><br>
Here. Try dancing like this.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Illustrious μ：</span><br>
Hm... like... this?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Unicorn：</span><br>
Um, it's actually... like this.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Illustrious μ：</span><br>
Hm, these steps are a bit...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Dido µ：</span><br>
(Miss Illustrious, I can sympathise... You're top-heavy, so these movements are bound to be difficult...)<br>
(Oh my, will I be able to stand out more than Miss Illustrious? Although I'm a bit capable at times, I don't know if...)<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Littorio：</span><br>
It's perfectly fine for you to stay just like that, Signorina. Your clumsiness can be your strength as an idol.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Illustrious μ：</span><br>
Um... Is that so...?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Vampire：</span><br>
I agree~ Unicorn and Illustrious are super cute due to their clumsiness~<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Unicorn：</span><br>
Wha?!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Dido µ：</span><br>
Whew...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Unicorn：</span><br>
D-do your best, Illustrious...!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Albacore μ：</span><br>
I think 'space' might be a fitting theme for the upcoming performance~<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Tashkent μ：</span><br>
Huh?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Albacore μ：</span><br>
Hm? It's because of the equipment, you know? Wouldn't it be great if the performance was bright and sparkly, just like our equipment?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Tashkent μ：</span><br>
Is that so. It's one thing to say so, but... is there any reason to push ourselves that much?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Albacore μ：</span><br>
Not really? But I think it'd be more interesting and exciting that way! Don't you think so too?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Tashkent μ：</span><br>
(I-I don't know how to respond...!)<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Baltimore μ：</span><br>
I see, so there are three Muse System units participating in the competition. Besides us, there's a unit with Taihou and Roon, and a unit from the Iris Libre.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Dido µ：</span><br>
Are they teaming up because they're comfortable with each other...?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Tashkent μ：</span><br>
There's no way to know for sure.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Illustrious μ：</span><br>
It seems that Miss Littorio also wanted to apply, but Miss Veneto stopped her.<br>
(I wonder what Miss Veneto meant by "impure motives"...?)<br>
<br>
And so, the girls made slow but steady progress towards their first live performance.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Baltimore μ：</span><br>
The song, choreography, stage directions, and costumes... I guess this should be enough for now.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Albacore μ：</span><br>
If you keep worrying, we'll never be able to start! Let's give this practice another go!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Tashkent μ：</span><br>
Sounds good. If we've decided on our course of action, all that's left is to take our lessons and practice during rehearsal.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Dido µ：</span><br>
Miss Illustrious, could you be the center of our unit?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Illustrious μ：</span><br>
...Yes! If you're fine with me being the center, please leave it to me!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Baltimore μ：</span><br>
All right! Let's practice one more time.<br>
{{折叠面板|内容结束}}

{{折叠面板|标题=A New Mystery|选项=7|主框=1|样式=primary|展开=是}}
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Albacore μ：</span><br>
Whewie... I never expected the choreography I came up with to be this tiring...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Dido µ：</span><br>
It might be a good idea to revise it a bit...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Albacore μ：</span><br>
Grr...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Baltimore μ：</span><br>
It's okay, it's a given that we'll run into problems as we practice.<br>
The Polaris girls went through the same ordeals. It's not something we can avoid.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Illustrious μ：</span><br>
That's right. Also, we haven't run into any major issues yet. That must mean we're at least on the right track.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Tashkent μ：</span><br>
That's quite true. If we're able to continue with our lessons in this manner, even our current issues won't be problematic for us in the future.<br>
Even the performance on stage shouldn't be an issue if we keep it up.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Baltimore μ：</span><br>
If we perform better on stage than we do during practice, that'd mean we're overselling our equipment's performance. Make sure you don't forget the objective of our operation.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Albacore μ：</span><br>
There's still something I don't get about our equipment, though.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Dido µ：</span><br>
Something about our equipment...?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Albacore μ：</span><br>
Cleveland's Muse System had a mechanism where the more excited the crowd got, the more power it could output.<br>
Think about it. There are plenty of people without the Muse System participating, right?<br>
So, I just don't get why they'd deliberately split up people with the Muse System into different teams.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Illustrious μ：</span><br>
I wonder... why that's the case.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Tashkent μ：</span><br>
So you suspect the Muse System's power output depends on who wields it?<br>
Last time, there was only one unit, Polaris. But this time, there are multiple units. That's a bit strange, I think.<br>
For instance, if the Sakura Empire and Iron Blood duo achieve a higher performance with the Muse System, that would mean that they're stronger than us.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Baltimore μ：</span><br>
In other words, people will think there's a power imbalance between the factions... But I wonder if we're reading too deeply into this.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Albacore μ：</span><br>
We'll never find out unless we participate in the competition~<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Dido µ：</span><br>
All we can do now is focus on the lesson at hand.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Baltimore μ：</span><br>
That's right. Come on everyone, once more!<br>

<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Illustrious μ：</span><br>
Become a star, and sing a song of love and peace~<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Baltimore μ：</span><br>
...All right! Break time, folks!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Albacore μ：</span><br>
Yaay~ *highfive*<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Tashkent μ：</span><br>
Yay. *highfive*<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Dido µ：</span><br>
Miss Illustrious, you did great...!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Baltimore μ：</span><br>
Really, fantastic job. Thanks to you, everyone maintained their positions well.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Illustrious μ：</span><br>
You give me too much credit. It's thanks to your great leadership that we were able to come this far.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Baltimore μ：</span><br>
It wasn't just me, it was thanks to everyone's cooperation.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Albacore μ：</span><br>
This light should be aimed there... Come on, let's get going! I'll be giving the directions to the manjuus.<br>
Aaand this prop. It matches me just fine, but as I thought, it really won't match Illustrious and the others at all~<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Dido µ：</span><br>
This precious commodity that Miss Victorious entrusted to me... I'll use it to make the ultimate costume!<br>
Oh, Sirius, you don't need to help out with that. Please, help me with something else!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Tashkent μ：</span><br>
I see, so the current fad is idols with animal ears...<br>
Grozny, you've gotten hold of some great intel...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Baltimore μ：</span><br>
All right, there's only a bit more left for today. Let's finish up and head back to the dorms.<br>
And tomorrow... let's give it our all!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Everyone：</span><br>

<br>
While Baltimore and the others were preparing for the competition...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">？？？：</span><br>
Polaris, Astrum, Lumière... To think that there were this many units with the Muse System.<br>
And here I thought that the only unit to be cautious of was the group with the little girl from the Eagle Union.<br>
This new Muse System turns feelings into power... As long as I can feed it my feelings, even that little girl will be toast.<br>
So long as I can win against her, the one shining brightest on the stage will undoubtedly be...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Taihou μ：</span><br>
Hehe~ Me, of course. The one and only Taihou♡<br>
Oh, my dear Commander. How sinful you are, showing my perfect, idol self to others... Even though you were supposed to be the only one allowed to see me like this...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">？？？：</span><br>
Taihou, I get how you feel, but I'd like if you could hold yourself back a bit~<br>
Of course, the Commander will be watching the stage along with the others. If your performance is bad due to your focus on other people, it's not going to fly with me...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Roon μ：</span><br>
In other words, if you want the Commander to be your captive audience, you're going to need to put in more effort.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Taihou μ：</span><br>
...It's just as you say. All I'll need to do is focus solely on the Commander, and my performance will be flawless.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Roon μ：</span><br>
You mean, *our* performance.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Taihou μ：</span><br>
Yeah, that's right. Our performance, powered by the Muse System... Hehehe♡<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">？？？：</span><br>
Man raises acclaim, while the beloved, God's idol be.<br>
Hehehe. How is our diva doing?<br>
Great, there's nothing to worry about.<br>
<br>
Hmm...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Le Triomphant：</span><br>
Sister, please show everyone the majestic elegance of Iris.<br>

To think that it's already that time of year again! The long-awaited live competition, right here in our port! This is Akashi, and I'll be your host for tonight, nya!<br>
This time, not only are new idol groups participating, but there will also be multiple units fitted with the Muse System, nya!<br>
There's no doubt that this will be a bigger, more exciting show than last year, nya! Here come the contestants, nya!<br>
The powerhouse from last year, expert users of the Muse System! Here's Polaris, nya!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Gascogne μ：</span><br>
Failed to process purpose of introduction. Requesting elaboration.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Cleveland μ：</span><br>
There's no real meaning behind it, so just ignore it!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Akashi：</span><br>
A newly formed idol duo, featuring the recent trend of animal-eared girls?! Here's Eldrige and Hammann, nya!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Eldridge：</span><br>
... (Her tuft of hair made a V shape)<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Hammann：</span><br>
Ugh, it's so embarrassing... d-don't take pictures, you perverts!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Akashi：</span><br>
A new trio of devils who can sing, dance, and crack codes with their demonic eyes. Here's U-110, Z35, and Z36!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">U-110：</span><br>
We're not cute, we're scary, roar~<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Z35：</span><br>
I'm the singing and dancing Z35~ roar~♪<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Z36：</span><br>
I am the one who dared to summon the shark of the abyss, Z36 of the demonic eye, roar~!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Akashi：</span><br>
The big guns sponsoring the competition are making an emergency appearance as contestants?! I'd like to award them with victory right now, but I'm not a host who's swayed by money, nya! Iiit's Queen Elizabeth and Warspite, nya!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Warspite：</span><br>
(It'd be better to just let Her Majesty introduce herself.)<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Queen Elizabeth：</span><br>
My faithful servants, watch my performance with all of your attention!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Akashi：</span><br>
Aaaand now, a storm of destruction formed by love that's too suffocating! Muse System unit, Taihou and Roon are here, nya!!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Roon μ：</span><br>
Please, don't look only at the stage. Make sure to focus on the target ship when it gets blown into pieces, okay~?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Taihou μ：</span><br>
My Commander, are you watching me...?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Akashi：</span><br>
From the domain of faith descends an idol of light! Le Malin, equipped with the Muse System, makes an appearance as Lumière!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Le Triomphant：</span><br>
Sister, do your best!!!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Le Malin μ：</span><br>
...Hmph.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Akashi：</span><br>
And last, the unit composed of the Royal Navy, Eagle Union, and Northern Parliament. Let's welcome the stars who will light up the stage, Astrum, nya!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Baltimore μ：</span><br>
Everyone, how are you all doing!!!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Akashi：</span><br>
And that's it for rules and introductions, nya! We'll be starting in just a minute. In the meantime, if you'd like to purchase some merchandise, please come over to the store, nya~<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Illustrious μ：</span><br>
Unicorn, will you be all right by yourself?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Unicorn：</span><br>
Mhm, I'll be fine. Do your best too, okay?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Illustrious μ：</span><br>
Yes, let's all do our best.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Tashkent μ：</span><br>
Wasn't that introduction too full of spirit?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Albacore μ：</span><br>
That's what makes it fun, after all!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Dido µ：</span><br>
Everyone, it's almost time to get ready.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Baltimore μ：</span><br>
Yeah. Let's go!<br>

Competition Area<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Baltimore μ：</span><br>
All right. So far, so good.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Dido µ：</span><br>
I was able to complete that lesson without a problem...!<br>
(If I can keep this up until the end, I can be useful to Master...!)<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Albacore μ：</span><br>
Don't you think we'll be facing a formidable foe next?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Illustrious μ：</span><br>
Why...?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Albacore μ：</span><br>
Mm, take a look at the set over there. It looks like they were really serious about it.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Akashi：</span><br>
Ooh! It seems that Astrum will face Le Malin next, nya! This will be the first live battle featuring two groups of Muse System users, nya!<br>
Cameramanjuu! Pan over to the scene, nya!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Le Malin μ：</span><br>
...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Tashkent μ：</span><br>
(Whenever I saw her during a lesson, she was always lazing around, so I never got to see her practicing once during a lesson.)<br>
(Albacore said she thinks it would be a formidable foe. But won't this be an easy victory?)<br>
<br>
SHWIIING!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Le Malin μ：</span><br>
I am an illusion that races among the waves. An idol that shall light up the sea. I am Le Malin.<br>
My heart is the heart of Iris. My song is the love of Iris. My desire is the wish to grant salvation.<br>
Now, I shall purify thy souls with this song of prayer!<br>
<br>
SHWIIING!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Illustrious μ：</span><br>
...What a brilliant light...!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Baltimore μ：</span><br>
Everyone, be careful. This Le Malin is different from usual...!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Dido µ：</span><br>
Understood...!<br>

<br>
SHWIIING!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Tashkent μ：</span><br>
Holy smokes! Le Malin is practically gleaming, and not just thanks to the stage lighting!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Illustrious μ：</span><br>
To think she could produce such a dazzling performance if she just sets her mind to it...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Baltimore μ：</span><br>
You said it. We underestimated her, bigtime.<br>
Her theme, her moves, heck, even her rigging were like elegance itself given physical form. It all came together so seamlessly.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Illustrious μ：</span><br>
Not only that, her soothing vocals clearly conveyed just how much effort she is exerting.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Dido µ：</span><br>
Her expression reminded me of Sirius' when she's giving it her all.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Baltimore μ：</span><br>
We'll just have to match her with an encore. It's an endurance competition now!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Le Malin μ：</span><br>
Uuughh, I'm exhausteeeed... I'm done. Just let me lie down...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Le Triomphant：</span><br>
Oh dear! Malin!<br>
I didn't wish for you to wear yourself out... I apologize for pushing you too hard, sister.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Le Malin μ：</span><br>
Please, Triomphant, I'll be fine...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Algérie：</span><br>
It seems Le Malin is at the end of her rope... As they say: the flame that burns twice as bright burns half as long.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Le Malin μ：</span><br>
...No, not yet. The flame within me has not yet spent all its fuel.<br>
(Just for you, sister, I shall push myself to keep going.)<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Queen Elizabeth：</span><br>
Hohoho! We present you with this brilliant stage dressing, made possible by the lavish props assembled by Warspite!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Warspite：</span><br>
Thank you, Your Majesty. It is a brilliant stage indeed.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Le Triomphant：</span><br>
I am indebted to you both. Thank you for assisting us.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Warspite：</span><br>
It is all in the name of making this competition more entertaining, but you're welcome nevertheless.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Algérie：</span><br>
Hmm. This might not be such a good idea...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Le Triomphant：</span><br>
What makes you say that, Algérie?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Algérie：</span><br>
If they force an encore, it's only a matter of time before Le Malin runs out of stamina.<br>
It seems we have no choice. We need to use our trump card already.<br>
Malin! Just one more song, and you'll be done! We have a box of Dunkerque's pastries waiting for you!<br>

<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Le Malin μ：</span><br>
*pant*... *pant*... I think... this is it for me... Oof!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Illustrious μ：</span><br>
So it would seem.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Dido µ：</span><br>
Splendid work, everyone! We made a spectacular comeback!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Albacore μ：</span><br>
Yeah, somehow... Le Malin put up a hell of a fight. I thought with how lazy she normally is, she'd be a pushover!<br>
Guess the Muse System really can work miracles, huh?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Dido µ：</span><br>
It was almost as though she'd been possessed... until she fell over, at least.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Illustrious μ：</span><br>
This was no case of possession, Dido. Le Malin was simply performing with all her body and soul. The Muse System was amplified by her passion.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Baltimore μ：</span><br>
If passion equals power, then I guess that means we were nearly out-passioned by her. That's not exactly encouraging.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Tashkent μ：</span><br>
...…<br>
(Could that be why I was underperforming? Have I been trying too hard and lacked heartfelt passion as a result?)<br>
(They're all doing it for our dear comrade, or for some other personal reason, while I just...)<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Albacore μ：</span><br>
Maybe, but what if some of the teams just got more powerful riggings than others? What if we drew the short straw?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">？？？：</span><br>
Muse System does not function as proposed. Posited theory has no logical basis.<br>
Assessment: the Muse System is a military instrument that converts emotion into weaponized energy. As "passion" is an unquantifiable property, its utilization by the Muse System is impossible.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Baltimore μ：</span><br>
Huh? Wait a minute, aren't you...?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Taihou μ：</span><br>
(The Muse System is fueled by one's emotions, is it?)<br>
(If that is true, then this grants me unparalleled power! Nobody, and I mean nobody has more passionate feelings for my Commander than I do!)<br>
(Yes, I am truly in a league of my own! Oh, my Commander, come my time to perform, I shall prove it to you!)<br>

<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Akashi：</span><br>
Welcome back, nya! We now return to our Muse System test run and conveniently coinciding idol showdown, nya!<br>
The crowd's excitement is through the roof after the dazzling show our participants have put on so far, nya! Let's have a closer look, nya!<br>
On one side we have the imposing Verheerender duo, nya! If it's one thing they've shown they don't have, it's mercy, nya!<br>
And on the other, we have the troupes of Astrum and Polaris who just ran into one another, nya! It could end in a victory for either side, nya!<br>
<br>
Port - Exercise Area<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Cleveland μ：</span><br>
Well, we're not exactly pro idols either. We just have more experience with the Muse System than you guys, that's all.<br>
Oh, by the way, try not to think of this whole thing as "serious idol business." Have fun with it and you'll perform better, trust me.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Sheffield μ：</span><br>
Indeed. I view this as an elaborate form of vermin extermination. Both my performance and enjoyment went up after I adopted such a mindset.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Dido µ：</span><br>
I'm afraid I don't quite understand what that means, Sheffy...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Admiral Hipper μ：</span><br>
Look, they're saying "just be yourself." Oh, and teamwork makes the dream work, yadda yadda yadda.<br>
As long as you're all on the same page, your choreography and singing will flow nicely together.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Albacore μ：</span><br>
Sounds like something we'd better commit to memory. Right, Tashkent?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Tashkent μ：</span><br>
Oh, I see. Will do.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Admiral Hipper μ：</span><br>
(Nobody's quipping at me for once... Feels pretty weird when you're as used to it as I am.)<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Cleveland μ：</span><br>
Also, full disclose: we also explained all this to Lumière and Verheerender earlier when we ran into them. Just so you know.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Sheffield μ：</span><br>
Thus, everyone knows. The Master does not wish for any one team to have an advantage over another, you see.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Gascogne μ：</span><br>
Assessment: this information is instrumental to utilizing the Muse System to its fullest potential.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Baltimore μ：</span><br>
We really appreciate it. All we knew was just guesswork until you guys came along.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Illustrious μ：</span><br>
Now, however, we have another problem: expressing our feelings through song does seem a difficult task...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Akagi μ：</span><br>
It might seem hard, but it's actually quite easy.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Dido µ：</span><br>
It is? Would you please elaborate, Akagi?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Akagi μ：</span><br>
If you want an example, just look at Le Malin, Roon, and Taihou. The source of their passion is clear as day.<br>
The former: the bond she shares with her sister, not to mention the strength of the bond itself.<br>
The latter: their unwavering will to fight for the one they love more than anything else.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Cleveland μ：</span><br>
(And wouldn't you know it, Akagi has both of those connections...)<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Akagi μ：</span><br>
What about you, Astrum? What passion drives you?<br>
{{折叠面板|内容结束}}

{{折叠面板|标题=That Which Connects Us|选项=15|主框=1|样式=primary|展开=是}}
<br>
Emotion. The thread that creates a song sung for one's family. The bond between lifelong friends.<br>
This thread does not need a weaver, for the heart produces it naturally, spool after spool, simply through contact with others.<br>
And these girls' hearts, though brought together under artificial circumstances, keep on forging bonds as genuine as any other.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Bremerton：</span><br>
The idol biz, huh? Yeah, no offense, but I can't really picture you as an idol.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Baltimore：</span><br>
I can do it, but I think I'm lacking in the cuteness department. Do you think I'd stick out in a bad way because of it?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Bremerton：</span><br>
Well, let's see... Okay, so, you definitely can't mimic Sara's "lookie, I'm a pink, sparkly idol!" shtick. It wouldn't suit you. Like, at all.<br>
But Sara's not the only idol around. You know her sister, Lexington? You could market yourself as more mature and womanly, like her. Either way, I guess you'll figure something out.<br>
If you ever need someone to give feedback on your image, I'll be here! Hey, wait, the Commander might be better, actually... Be right back!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Baltimore：</span><br>
W-wait, you're telling me to practice with the Commander?! I said wait!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Belfast：</span><br>
You will be undertaking "idol duties"? I see. Anyone could see how that would make one feel anxious.<br>
But please, rest assured, Dido. As fellow Royal Maids, we shall support you in any way we can. You need only ask for our assistance.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Gloucester：</span><br>
Belfast, if I may: I think we should give her a crash course on the topic.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Dido：</span><br>
A... crash course? is there such intricacy to being an idol?<br>
(What worries me is that I will need to relegate my maid responsibilities to others, thus allowing me fewer interactions with Master...)<br>
(But... Master assigned me these duties because they are important! If I abscond from them, I... Oh dear, I don't know what to do...)<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Hermione ：</span><br>
Do you fear not being allowed to see Master, Dido? If you wish, I could care of your kitchen responsibilities.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Sirius：</span><br>
I, too, can help in the kitchen. If you want, that is...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Dido：</span><br>
Oh, you're too kind, Hermione! And Sirius, thanks, but... no thanks.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Admiral Graf Spee：</span><br>
Wow! Despite how advanced the choreography is, you completely nailed it, Tashkent. You're gifted.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Z46：</span><br>
To me it is clear as day: dancing on the stage, that is your forte.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Tashkent μ：</span><br>
Not really. Anyone can do it with enough practice. Tashkent just learns slightly quicker than most people.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Admiral Graf Spee：</span><br>
All right, but... shouldn't you let the others know? That you've been practicing, solo?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Tashkent μ：</span><br>
Once I've mastered it, then I will teach it to them. Tashkent can't be the only good dancer in the troupe.<br>
Besides, it's hardly a secret. They already found out that I've been practicing.<br>
...Ah, a message from our dear comrade. Heheh, if you'll excuse me...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Illustrious μ：</span><br>
♪ Our connected voices will surely bring forth the next miracleeee ♪<br>
(Like the light, my song needs to reach all corners of the world... Or should I say, it needs to reach the Commander's heart.)<br>
Sara, how would you grade my singing, as it is now?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Saratoga：</span><br>
About an 8 out of 10? I want to give you a higher score, but you're not quite, umm, reaching peak vocal softness, I guess?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Illustrious μ：</span><br>
Aha, then strive for greater vocal softness I shall, Mentor Sara. Hehe~<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Taihou：</span><br>
Have you tired of making yourself at home in my room yet? I have a very important date to ask my Commander out on.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Albacore：</span><br>
Almost, just letting my first impression of these lyrics form...<br>
Anyway, Taihou, why'd you team up with Roon? I thought you were the solo type. You never hang out with anyone.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Taihou：</span><br>
To win my Commander's affection with the most stellar performance possible, why else? Why, even that wench Akagi has done the same.<br>
And you, I thought you desired people's ire more so than their adoration, what with all your "pranks." Speaking of, this stage you're working on is far too elaborate. You know that, right?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Albacore：</span><br>
Hmm... Yeah, you're right. Too setup-reliant, not gonna work. That's tunnel vision for ya!<br>
Welp, before I go, I got one hot tip for improving your choreography: to keep your balance, mind your melons!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Admiral Hipper μ：</span><br>
You ready to do this, then?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Cleveland μ：</span><br>
Sure am! This is where the fun begins, guys.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Baltimore μ：</span><br>
We're ready. Let's get this show on the road.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Dido µ：</span><br>
For Master, and my fellow troupe members, I shall perform with all my heart!<br>

High Muse System power output confirmed. Advancing to next ordnance test phase.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Admiral Hipper μ：</span><br>
Meh. You're only half as strong as Verheerender, and that's being generous.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Tashkent μ：</span><br>
I see. Well, we just went easy on you! Wouldn't wanna rock you into the next dimension, you know!<br>
(Yeah, that's a good quip. That should ease our dear comrade's mind...)<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Akagi μ：</span><br>
You think your feelings can surpass my infinite love? How very amusing.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Illustrious μ：</span><br>
We shall stand our ground, if that is what you're asking.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Albacore μ：</span><br>
I'll tell you this much: I'm getting into the swing of this! Round 2, anyone?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Cleveland μ：</span><br>
You betcha. This concert is only just getting started!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Gascogne μ：</span><br>
Attention: emotion inhibition module deactivated.<br>
I will sing with as much feeling as possible! For Master's sake!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Baltimore μ：</span><br>
Now this is more like it! No holds barred, let's go!<br>

Port - Among the crowd<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ping Hai：</span><br>
Whoa! Look, sis! They're singing on a whole new level than before!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ning Hai：</span><br>
They really are... Guess they're getting fired up. Good for them.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Z46：</span><br>
Ah. With the trammel of the heart removed, their songs have attained an unprecedented level of groove.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Fubuki：</span><br>
What? Did you just say "camel of the heart?"<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Z46：</span><br>
Trammel. 'Tis a shackle that keeps the heart under lock and key, denying the very soul its uninhibited emotional liberty.<br>
Ridding oneself of it is the wish of all idols. I have yet to do, however, and find myself upon the endless staircase of recital.<br>

...Ayanami, do you get what she's trying to say? Because I don't.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ayanami：</span><br>
I get the gist, yes. I sometimes unshackle my heart too if the situation calls for it.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Z23：</span><br>
Sounds like Z36's been giving you all weird ideas...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Akashi：</span><br>
The megaconcert – can we just call it megaconcert, by the way? – is approaching its climax, nya!<br>
Which of our troupes will remain dazzling at the end of the night, nya?<br>
Will it be the exceptionally elegant solo unit Lumière, led by Le Malin?<br>
Maybe it will be smash hit, fan-favorite from last time, Polaris?<br>
Perhaps the all-star team composed of Baltimore, Illustrious, Dido, Albacore, and Tashkent, the amicable Astrum!<br>
Or will it be Roon and Taihou, the Verheerender duo, who have already made it to the end and await new challengers?<br>
Let us find out, nyaaaaaa!<br>

I am a warship, brought to life for the purpose of sinking those that stand in my way<br>
A warship I am, brought into this world for the purpose of reaping my own kin<br>
Permit me to express my feelings for you, and I shall not kill in the name of it<br>
If you permit me to find a greater purpose, then I shall not deprive that of another <br>
What I desire is someone to love, to revere, to make me whole <br>
And everyone else may as well burn to cinders <br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Taihou μ：</span><br>
There you are at last, Astrum.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Roon μ：</span><br>
Ahahaha... Time draws near for the crescendo, wouldn't you agree?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Albacore μ：</span><br>
Taihou! Heyooooo!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Taihou μ：</span><br>
......<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Albacore μ：</span><br>
(No reaction? Weird. She usually gets all worked up when she sees me.)<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Illustrious μ：</span><br>
This is quite the ominous theme... Is that the type of image you wish Verheerender to have?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Baltimore μ：</span><br>
Don't let them pressure you. We'll do our best with our own themes.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Tashkent μ：</span><br>
You don't scare Tashkent!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Roon μ：</span><br>
Let me guess... You ran into Polaris, didn't you? Why, they must have told you all about us and our plans. With the power of the Muse System, the Commander shall be ours alone.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Dido µ：</span><br>
You... intend to kidnap Master?!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Albacore μ：</span><br>
And using the very thing you were entrusted to test?! That's just dirty!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Taihou μ：</span><br>
Call it whatever you may, I don't care. If it weren't for the incredible power these devices grant, I would've never partaken in this to begin with.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Roon μ：</span><br>
Everyone might make them out to be musical instruments, but at the end of the day, they are weapons. We're simply using them the way we see fit.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Illustrious μ：</span><br>
The way you see fit... What is it that you wish to express with your songs? Destruction? Chaos?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Taihou μ：</span><br>
You're mistaken. Our desires are completely detached from our music and from these instruments.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Roon μ：</span><br>
Indeed. What I want is someone to make me whole. Someone who doesn't mind my... shall we say, little impulses.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Taihou μ：</span><br>
And I desire someone to love. Someone to be mine, and I, be theirs.<br>
Everything else is meaningless and serves only to interfere. So we destroy it.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Roon μ：</span><br>
Yes. Only one thing awaits whatever or whoever stands in our way...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Taihou μ &Roon μ：</span><br>
DESTRUCTION!<br>

*knock knock*<br>
Office - Some time prior to the second Muse System trial<br>
Cluttering my desk were papers relating to the implementation of a massive port-funded concert. Or, as it's formally known, a second Muse System trial.<br>
Before the trial was announced, I arranged for the same model of rigging to be sent out to each of the participating members.<br>
Given the theme of the event, it should come as little surprise that I requisitioned that Muse System riggings also be distributed among all the factions.<br>
My plan was simple: encourage a friendly intercultural exchange while also testing a new weapons system.<br>
But for reasons I've yet to understand, all the participants ended up with different rigging modules, which made assigning the members into groups a major issue.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Taihou：</span><br>
You called for us, Commander?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Roon：</span><br>
Is everything all right? You look as though there's something on your mind...<br>
<br>
I suppose it's high time I explain the situation to them.<br>
Port - Concert Venue<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Akashi：</span><br>
Oh no, nya... The mood in here has done a complete μ-turn, nya! Verheerender look like they're about to start shooting everything in sight!<br>
And I don't wanna get caught in the crossfire, nya... I need to get out of here...<br>
...…<br>
O-oh! Never mind, false alarm, nya! They really had me for a second there, nya...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Taihou μ：</span><br>
You clearly misunderstood our intentions. The winner is the one who shines the brightest, both in theater and war. It was all part of our performance, you see.<br>
If we were to actually destroy everything, there would be nobody around to witness our brilliance, would there?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Roon μ：</span><br>
Exactly! Did we scare you~?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Taihou μ：</span><br>
(You're one to talk about scaring people, Roon!)<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Baltimore μ：</span><br>
Halfway to death, geesh... Don't do that again.<br>
You might've frightened us good, but we're not running away anytime soon. We've still got a score to settle and a show to finish.<br>
Am I right, folks?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Illustrious μ：</span><br>
Quite so! The light of our songs must reach more of the world's hearts.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Tashkent μ：</span><br>
Yeah! Our dear comrade is watching, so we can't quit now!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Dido μ：</span><br>
Master is watching... I must not disappoint! Not now!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Albacore μ：</span><br>
Sorry, Taihou, but we've got this in the bag! We can still team up after we beat you, though!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Taihou μ：</span><br>
No! Not now, not ever! Now onto the final stage!<br>

It looks like Verheerende and Astrum are perfectly evenly matched, nya! Will we need to declare a tie, nya?<br>
...Hang on, nya! A message just came in! Seems all participants are back in the game for this last match, nya!<br>
We're ending with a bang to compensate for the subpar conclusion of the last trial, nya! Everyone that's still in the exercise area: rush on over to the stage if you want one last chance, nya!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Vampire：</span><br>
Thou insist on as explosive a finish as this? Very well, then.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Unicorn：</span><br>
I've got to go and support Illustrious! She needs all the help she can get!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Vampire：</span><br>
Are thou, now? Why, that I do wish to see for myself. Go!<br>

Raaawr. Lord of Sharkness reporting iiiin.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Z35：</span><br>
Wait a sec, 46! We still haven't heard back from 36!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Z36：</span><br>
I just got here, sorry! 23 was giving me an earful back there...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Z46：</span><br>
Imply you, my friend, that she controls the key to the trammel of the ear?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Z36：</span><br>
The... The what? Camel of the ear?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Le Triomphant：</span><br>
I am forever in your debt, Your Highness and Miss Warspite. This would not be possible without your kind assistance.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Warspite：</span><br>
There's no need to thank us. I must say though, I am quite surprised that Le Malin has the energy to get back on stage already.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Algérie：</span><br>
Where she draws her power from is a mystery. In any case, it's delightful to see her back in business.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Queen Elizabeth：</span><br>
Now don't forget the conditions under which we lease you our props and equipment, you hear?!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Le Triomphant：</span><br>
Certainly not, Your Highness. You shall stand right next to Le Malin during the performance, this I guarantee you.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Crescent：</span><br>
*sigh*... Look at the fancy stuff everyone's wearing! And we're stuck with this...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Comet：</span><br>
Hey, it's the best we have, Crescent! Don't be so negative about it!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Cygnet：</span><br>
Umm... C-could we not argue? Please?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Hammann：</span><br>
Why do I have to go up on stage? This is so humiliating I could just die!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Eldridge：</span><br>
But... cat idol... cute.<br>
C-class sisters outfits... also cute.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Crescent：</span><br>
R-really? Well, if you insist, I guess we just have to give it a try then! Come on, let's go.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Dido μ：</span><br>
Wow, uh, there's a big crowd of people gathering...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Albacore μ：</span><br>
Not surprising when they just announced that we're ending with a free-for-all!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Roon μ：</span><br>
There's no doubt it will be fun for everyone involved. Though personally, I would've preferred a little more... bloodshed, I suppose.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Taihou μ：</span><br>
Must everything you say sound so threatening? It scares even me sometimes...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Roon μ：</span><br>
Does it? Aren't you quite similar in that regard?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Illustrious μ：</span><br>
Everyone together now! Let's sing for all the world to hear!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Everyone：</span><br>

Hey, Illustrious, you seen Tashkent and Albacore around?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Illustrious：</span><br>
Tashkent I believe is in class at the moment, but I'm afraid I don't know where Albacore could be.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Baltimore：</span><br>
Oh, all right. Just wanted to hear if she was gonna continue working as an idol. I had someone ask me about it, so.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Illustrious：</span><br>
You were? It so happens I was asked the same.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Baltimore：</span><br>
What do you know. Apparently, tons of people wanna have a shot at it.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Illustrious：</span><br>
So I've heard. What about you, Baltimore? Will you continue as an idol?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Baltimore：</span><br>
I've got some catching up to do on my hero side-gig, so I'll sleep on it for a bit before I decide.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Illustrious：</span><br>
Ah, I understand. It's not a decision made lightly, after all.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Albacore：</span><br>
You're kidding! You're seriously done being an idol forever unless the Commander or Le Triomphant beg you for it?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Le Malin：</span><br>
Yes, I've had enough of it. Just thinking about it makes me tired. Ugh...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Albacore：</span><br>
You know, it's funny, 'cause Taihou and Tashkent both said pretty much the same thing.<br>
(Although unlike them, I guess you REALLY don't wanna do it.)<br>
<br>
*knock knock*<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Roon：</span><br>
Commander? I've finished up the report you asked for. Please, do give it a look.<br>
Oh, by the way, perhaps we could come up with a better title for it? Leaving it as "That One Test" will surely cause unneeded confusion in the future...<br>
What do I propose? Well, something to do with music, stars, and everyone dancing on the stage together. Not quite sure yet...<br>
<br>
Roon has a point. We should brainstorm a title with a nice ring to it.<br>

Only took us like a million years. Sure, it's a task from the depths of the repository, but does it really take that much computing power?<br>

There's more to art than the final product, you know. Reproducibility is an important element as well.<br>
Or are you saying that there's some error within our database?<br>

Ugh, I forgot how pointless it is to argue with you. Whatever, forget I said anything.<br>
