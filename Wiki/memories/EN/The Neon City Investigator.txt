<br>
Beneath the neon lights, people drape themselves in lies to survive, staking their lives on a game.<br>
Who's playing out the script, and who's writing the ending as the flames of explosions light up the streets?<br>
There is but one truth waiting to be uncovered.<br>
By the special advisor of the police force.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Akashi：</span><br>
Nyahaha, we're finally starting, nya!<br>
So, dear main character, do you remember your lines, nya?<br>
<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项1：What? Main character?</span>'''''<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项2：Huh? My lines?</span>'''''<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Akashi：</span><br>
Yes, you're the main character and you have lines, nya.<br>
Have you been so busy that it escaped your memory, nya? That's fine, nya!<br>
Let's skip the rehearsal and go straight to filming, nya!<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Wait, slow down. I really haven't even gotten the script, and nobody told me I had a starring role.<br>
All I got was a call from Aoba to come and help her get some material for...<br>
Oh. You two were in cahoots!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Akashi：</span><br>
Nyahaha! The best kind of script is no script at all, nya!<br>
You're playing yourself, and that's what'll make this such a hit, nya.<br>
Here's the gist: You're a special advisor for the police, and I want you to put your keen deductive skills on display, nya.<br>
Calling all teams, nya. Our star is on set, nya!<br>
Three, two, one... Action, nya!<br>

<br>
Chapter 1 - An Alarming Explosion<br>
Scene: Police station meeting room<br>
Time：19:25<br>
Date: June 25th<br>
You are a special advisor dispatched from headquarters who's been tasked with finding an infiltrator from a criminal organization within the force.<br>
Under the Police Commissioner's orders, every potential suspect has been gathered in the meeting room under the pretense of a safety inspection.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Azuma：</span><br>
So, new advisor, are you ready?<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Azuma? Why are you here?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Azuma：</span><br>
That's Instructor Azuma to you.<br>
I heard from the Commissioner that my former student was back. Heehee. Did you not want to see me?<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
(Ah. She's already in character.)<br>
Of course I did. I'm glad to see you again.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Azuma：</span><br>
Heehee. As am I.<br>
Come on, let's not waste any more time on chitchat. Everyone's waiting inside.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Film Narration：</span><br>
With a smile, Instructor Azuma urges you inside. You steel yourself and enter the meeting room.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
(Uh-huh. I see they're forcing the story to progress.)<br>
(Well, I guess it's better than getting no hints at all.)<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Film Narration：</span><br>
Six pairs of eyes turn to look at you the moment you set foot inside.<br>
You're greeted by the faces of Police Chief Impero from Criminal Investigations, Officer Zenker from Section Zero, Assistant Officer U-552 from Section Zero...<br>
Officer Neptune from Criminal Investigations Division One, Assistant Officer Z13 from Investigations Division Two, and Police Sergeant U-37 from Traffic Control.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
(Thank god for the explanations.)<br>
Ahem. The reason we've really gathered you here is because of an anonymous tip we received about the possibility that a member of an international crime syndicate has infiltrated the force.<br>
I'd like to hear everybody's thoughts on this.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">U-37：</span><br>
Seeeriously? Ya called us all here just for that?<br>
You just gonna take that tip at face value? Hell, I could just say the Commissioner's our rat, then!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Admiral Zenker：</span><br>
She has a point. The tip lacks credibility if the source doesn't even know of Section Zero.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Z13：</span><br>
You know, the people over at Section One's HR department should have detailed records on us. Why don't you start your investigation with them?<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
(Ah, the HR department. I'll admit, I'm critically short on information right now.)<br>
Where are these records kept?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Neptune：</span><br>
If I'm not mistaken, I believe they're in the adjacent building.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Film Narration：</span><br>
KABOOOM!<br>
The very moment Officer Neptune finishes speaking, the building that houses the archives explodes with a loud boom, reducing it to a pile of rubble.<br>
As a fireball erupts, the deafening ring of alarm sirens fills the police station.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Z13：</span><br>
Wh-what the hell?! Did someone just blow up the archives?!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Impero：</span><br>
While we were all gathered here, no less. That means it can't have been any one of us.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">U-552：</span><br>
Might be able to recover something if we get to it before the flames do. Ugh. Sounds like effort.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Admiral Zenker：</span><br>
One of our very own buildings, blown up before our eyes. They've signed their own death warrant!<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
That explosion's timing was way too convenient.<br>
I'm leaving to check on the scene. Let's call this meeting adjourned.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Neptune：</span><br>
Kindly hold on a moment, Advisor! I'll round up Division One and we'll come with you!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Akashi：</span><br>
Aaand cut, nya!<br>

<br>
Chapter 2 - Officer Bunneptune Is on the Case!<br>
Scene: Outside the police station's archives<br>
Time：20:08<br>
Date: June 25th<br>
You rush to the site of the explosion, hoping to find clues before they all burn to ashes.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Neptune：</span><br>
Step aside, officer comin' through!<br>
Have you found any good clues yet, Advisor?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">{playername}：</span><br>
I just got here thirty seconds ago. I've hardly started searching yet.<br>
But now that I've seen the damage, I'm not expecting much.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Neptune：</span><br>
*cough*... Judging by the smoke, it hasn't finished burning yet. Let's go in and see if anything is still intact.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">{playername}：</span><br>
The building is still on fire, though. Do you think anything will be left once the fire department is done with it?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Film Narration：</span><br>
Suddenly, you hear thunder in the distance. Mere moments pass before a heavy rain begins to fall.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Neptune：</span><br>
Fantastic news, Advisor! Even the weather is on our side! Now we can begin our investigation.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">{playername}：</span><br>
(Don't comment. You'll only make trouble for yourself.)<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Neptune：</span><br>
Now, let's split up and search for clues. What do you say I take the left and you take the right?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">{playername}：</span><br>
(She wants to split up at a time like this?)<br>
(If Neptune is the infiltrator, then that would be the ideal opportunity for her to destroy evidence and clear her name.)<br>
(Still, acting alone might give me the opportunity to make a breakthrough...)<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Neptune：</span><br>
I've already found something! How are things going on your end?<br>
<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项1：Are you the infiltrator?</span>'''''<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项2：(Just follow the script...)</span>'''''<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Neptune：</span><br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项1）</span>'''''I-infiltrator? Me?!<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项1）</span>'''''How dare you, Advisor? If that's a joke, it isn't funny!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">{playername}：</span><br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项1）</span>'''''Then what are you hiding behind your back?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Neptune：</span><br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项1）</span>'''''Behind my back...?<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项1）</span>'''''Forget that – check out these documents. I found Section Zero work records and a letter of grievance!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">{playername}：</span><br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项1）</span>'''''Aaah! Your back's on fire!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Neptune：</span><br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项1）</span>'''''Huh?! Wh-what's going on?! I still haven't...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">{playername}：</span><br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项1）</span>'''''Yoink!<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项1）</span>'''''Let's see here... Twenty chicken kabobs, three servings of wagyu beef, and five bottles of beer?<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项1）</span>'''''It's... just a dinner bill?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Neptune：</span><br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项1）</span>'''''See? It didn't matter! That's why I said to forget it and focus on these documents!<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项1）</span>'''''Aww... Just deceiving this poor, adorable bunny wasn't enough for you? You even accused me of being the infiltrator...<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项1）</span>'''''Maybe YOU'RE the big bad, after all.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">{playername}：</span><br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项1）</span>'''''Sorry. Let's get back to work.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Neptune：</span><br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项1）</span>'''''Okay! Let's refocus ourselves and find every last piece of evidence!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">{playername}：</span><br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项2）</span>'''''Nothing here. What do you have?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Neptune：</span><br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项2）</span>'''''Heheh, I got one heck of a bounty. Check it out!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">{playername}：</span><br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项2）</span>'''''Is this... Section Zero's work record?<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项2）</span>'''''Well, the writers didn't do a very good job. One of them is practically blank, and the other one only left a table of contents.<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项2）</span>'''''As for the other one, it's a letter of grievance that's too burned up to see anything apart from the complaint itself: "I was arrested for 'walking too fast.'"<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项2）</span>'''''Unfortunately, I doubt either of these will be of much use.<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项2）</span>'''''Hmm? You've been hiding something behind your back for a while now. What is it?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Neptune：</span><br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项2）</span>'''''This is just, umm...<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项2）</span>'''''Oh nooo! It's caught on fire! How careless of me!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">{playername}：</span><br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项2）</span>'''''What?! Give it here!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Neptune：</span><br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项2）</span>'''''I'm sorry... I think I got too close to a place that was still burning. It's burned up without a trace.<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项2）</span>'''''I waited to show it to you because I hadn't read it for myself yet.<br>

Chapter 3 - Strategic Date Solution<br>
Scene: Police station office<br>
Time：08:23<br>
Date: June 26th<br>
You've determined that the explosion is linked to the infiltrator, but clues are sparse.<br>
However, you discover that recent surveillance footage has been tampered with, leading to inconsistencies in the timeline of events.<br>
You visit the office of Assistant Officer Z13, who works closely with surveillance, to get to the bottom of this.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Z13：</span><br>
Well, well, if it isn't the special advisor!<br>
Just so you know, I'm not slacking on the job! This is what's called a strategic break period!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">{playername}：</span><br>
A break period... Do people normally play computer games when they're on break?<br>
You don't do this at the port, too, do you?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Z13：</span><br>
AHEM... Not sure what you mean by "the port." Did you come here just to confuse me?<br>
You've heard of work-life balance, haven't you?<br>
Now get your butt over here, sit down, and game... I mean, take a strategic break with me.<br>
Chief Impero herself approved this!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">{playername}：</span><br>
She did?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Z13：</span><br>
Yeah! Heck, she'll go and take strategic break periods at the pub during work hours.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">{playername}：</span><br>
Impero, of all people... Actually, I can see her doing that.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Z13：</span><br>
See? So, you're here during work hours. That must mean you're up for a strategic date.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">{playername}：</span><br>
(Do I get straight to the point, or do I let her take the indirect route?)<br>
<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项1：Are you the infiltrator?</span>'''''<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项2：(Just follow the script...)</span>'''''<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Z13：</span><br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项1）</span>'''''Careful where you lay those baseless accusations, friend. That's a serious claim.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">{playername}：</span><br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项1）</span>'''''Let me ask you this, then. When your supervisor goes off-premise during work hours, how do you know where she's going?<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项1）</span>'''''You must have seen it through the surveillance cameras.<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项1）</span>'''''If you're surveilling everyone at all times but haven't reported anything, then you must be the infiltrator.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Z13：</span><br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项1）</span>'''''Or maybe I'm just a hard-working officer? Have you considered that?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">{playername}：</span><br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项1）</span>'''''Hard-working, you say?<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项1）</span>'''''Okay, then are you aware that the surveillance tapes here have been tampered with?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Z13：</span><br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项1）</span>'''''What? Are you serious?!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">{playername}：</span><br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项1）</span>'''''Well... Yes. You're the one who did it, no?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Z13：</span><br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项1）</span>'''''That's not even physically possible!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">{playername}：</span><br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项1）</span>'''''Let's approach this differently. Are you able to investigate who did it?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Z13：</span><br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项1）</span>'''''Hmm. Nope. Also impossible.<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项1）</span>'''''All I can do is watch the monitors here. That also means that I do nothing BUT watch them.<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项1）</span>'''''But when the explosion happened, well, you were there. I had to go to the meeting like everyone else.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">{playername}：</span><br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项1）</span>'''''Right. Let's pull up yesterday's video, then. We can watch it together.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Z13：</span><br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项1）</span>'''''Hmm... How do I do that, again?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">{playername}：</span><br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项2）</span>'''''Sure. You know what would make for a fun date? Me getting a look at that encrypted data.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Z13：</span><br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项2）</span>'''''Huh?! What kind of date are you imagining?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">{playername}：</span><br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项2）</span>'''''A strategic one, of course.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Z13：</span><br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项2）</span>'''''Hey, no teasing!<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项2）</span>'''''Hm? Oh, you want to use my computer directly? But there's only one chair.<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项2）</span>'''''Wait, I know! You sit in the chair, and I'll sit in your lap, alright?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">{playername}：</span><br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项2）</span>'''''I can stand, thanks. What's the password?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Z13：</span><br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项2）</span>'''''Ooh, is this part of the date? Try this: I AM YOURS.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">{playername}：</span><br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项2）</span>'''''Incorrect password.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Z13：</span><br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项2）</span>'''''Try adding my name to it!<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项2）</span>'''''Come on. I'll put my hand on yours while you do it.<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项2）</span>'''''Doesn't that get the heart racing?<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项2）</span>'''''Just between you and me, my cubicle is in a bit of a blind spot, so we can get up to anything we want and nobody will ever know!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">{playername}：</span><br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项2）</span>'''''Nope. Incorrect password.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Z13：</span><br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项2）</span>'''''So, umm, Advisor? The thing is... I forgot my password.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">{playername}：</span><br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项2）</span>'''''Huh?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Z13：</span><br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项2）</span>'''''How about you try just putting in whatever?<br>

'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项2）</span>'''''Okay... PASSWORD it is, then.<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项2）</span>'''''Wait. It worked?<br>

Chapter 4 - Keeping Peace in the Streets<br>
Scene: Police station parking lot<br>
Time：09:31<br>
Date: June 26th<br>
After much effort, you manage to recover the original video. A dark shadow in the shape of a person appears onscreen.<br>
You recognize that speedy figure, but you can't place who it is.<br>
Unable to get any further on your own, you decide to consult with the experienced members of Section Zero.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">{playername}：</span><br>
A familiar figure, zipping by in the blink of an eye...<br>
Forget the investigation, I've figured it out.<br>
Aoba is the infiltrator!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Film Narration：</span><br>
Bzzt. Wrong, sorry.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">{playername}：</span><br>

<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Film Narration：</span><br>
Bzzt. Wrong, sorry.<br>

Fu Shun? Fei Yuen? Fu Po? Bristol? Gallant?<br>
Shimakaze? L'Audacieux? Le Malin? Le Terrible? Le Triomphant? L'Indomptable?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Film Narration：</span><br>
All of your guesses are wrong. And thanks to your incoherent mutterings, you've attracted the attention of a nearby patrol.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">U-37：</span><br>
Advisor, whatcha doin' here in the parking lot? Are ya taking your investigation off-site?<br>
You look a little flustered. Need a ride, maybe?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">{playername}：</span><br>
I have some questions for the personnel of Section Zero. Do you know where Officer Zenker and Assistant Officer U-552 are?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">U-37：</span><br>
I'm not privy to that information. Did you find a clue, or something?<br>
Try me. Maybe I can help ya out!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">{playername}：</span><br>
Aren't you just a traffic cop?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">U-37：</span><br>
Yeah, what of it? I'm still a real cop! You sound biased as hell, Advisor!<br>
Just recently, I stopped a violent biker gang with nothing but this bad boy!<br>
Anyway, hop on. We can ride and talk.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">{playername}：</span><br>
Where are you taking me?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">U-37：</span><br>
I'm still on duty, so we're goin' on patrol, of course. Can't get caught slackin' off.<br>

Uh, good work ethic, I guess.<br>

Chapter 5 - The Core of the Issue<br>
Scene: East Coast sightseeing train<br>
Time：17:34<br>
Date: June 26th<br>
One way or another, you found out where Assistant Officer U-552 from Section Zero is.<br>
You board a sightseeing train that loops around the coast and find her. She's sleeping.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">{playername}：</span><br>
Assistant Officer U-552? Why are you... sleeping on this train?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">U-552：</span><br>
*yawn*... Commander, remember, I'm not an officer right now – I'm a tour guide.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">{playername}：</span><br>
"Commander"?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">U-552：</span><br>
Oops. My bad, I just woke up. I meant to say special advisor!<br>
I guess since you're here, why not have a little nap?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">{playername}：</span><br>
I'm not tired. So, are you undercover or something?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">U-552：</span><br>
Yep. I'm dressed as a tour guide and gathering top-notch intel.<br>
*sigh*... I wish I didn't have to work.<br>
Need to act the part. Ahem...<br>
Hello and welcome aboard our sightseeing bus.<br>
Today, we'll be... Uh, what was my line, again?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">{playername}：</span><br>
You sound awkward. Not used to service work, I take it?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">U-552：</span><br>
Spot on. The reason I picked this job is because no actual tourists ride this thing.<br>
Most people who come on board have some intel. So, basically, I went for the most low-effort thing available.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">{playername}：</span><br>
That makes sense, but...<br>
<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项1：Are you the infiltrator?</span>'''''<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项2：(Just follow the script...)</span>'''''<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">U-552：</span><br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项1）</span>'''''What? Is being lazy reason enough to get suspicion cast on me?<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项1）</span>'''''Not saying that I WAS being lazy. It's just that this sunny weather was... perfect for a nap.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">{playername}：</span><br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项1）</span>'''''Uh-huh. So, did you hear any juicy intel?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">U-552：</span><br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项1）</span>'''''Look. Espionage takes knowledge and, above all else, patience. Being from Section Zero, I need to put more importance on staying hidden than relaying information.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">{playername}：</span><br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项1）</span>'''''In other words, you haven't.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">U-552：</span><br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项1）</span>'''''The core of the issue isn't whether I have or haven't.<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项1）</span>'''''What IS the core of the issue is... finding the core of the issue.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">{playername}：</span><br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项1）</span>'''''And what exactly is the issue at its core?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">U-552：</span><br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项1）</span>'''''To find the issue at its core, you first have to find the core of the issue.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">{playername}：</span><br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项1）</span>'''''Okay. Have you found it or not?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">U-552：</span><br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项1）</span>'''''*sigh*... Fine, I admit it. I was slacking off, okay?<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项1）</span>'''''But trust me, Advisor, I had a reason for it. Don't make me a suspect just because I was a little lazy.<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项1）</span>'''''I DO have intel. I just don't have it on me right now.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">{playername}：</span><br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项1）</span>'''''So, you have it, but you don't have it?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">U-552：</span><br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项1）</span>'''''Exactly! The intel exists, it's in my possession, but I don't have it on hand!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">{playername}：</span><br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项1）</span>'''''......<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">U-552：</span><br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项1）</span>'''''Ahem... I've already sent in everything I've gathered.<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项1）</span>'''''It's written on paper, so I can't just show it to you. Sorry.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">{playername}：</span><br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项1）</span>'''''Who'd you send it to?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">U-552：</span><br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项1）</span>'''''Officer Zenker. She should be at this train's final stop by now.<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项1）</span>'''''Go talk to her and she should clear my name for you!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">U-552：</span><br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项2）</span>'''''...But what?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">{playername}：</span><br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项2）</span>'''''No, forget it. The weather IS perfect weather for a nap, so I can't blame you.<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项2）</span>'''''This isn't a bad opportunity to take a break.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">U-552：</span><br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项2）</span>'''''Glad you understand, Advisor.<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项2）</span>'''''Although, since there's a passenger on board now, I've gotta fulfill my duty as a guide.<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项2）</span>'''''Ahem... Here, special advisor. Please have the latest edition of Tourist's Digest.<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项2）</span>'''''Everything you want to know about the local tourist destinations is listed here.<br>

<span style="color:#4eb24e;">{playername}：</span><br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项2）</span>'''''I'd be even more satisfied if you had any intel for me.<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项2）</span>'''''Still, I'm eager to see the fruits of your work.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">U-552：</span><br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项2）</span>'''''Uhh, did you have to change the subject like that?<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项2）</span>'''''Just try to focus on the sightseeing, okay?<br>

Chapter 6 - Blah, Blah, Blah<br>
Scene: Downtown warehouse<br>
Time：19:20<br>
Date: June 26th<br>
With the hint that Officer Zenker possesses crucial information, you stepped off the train.<br>
You pursued the address stated in the hint and arrived at a warehouse in the downtown area.<br>
After entering, you hear the cry of Officer Zenker from further within the building.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Admiral Zenker：</span><br>
H-heeelp! Somebody heeelp!<br>
Oh, phew. You're here, Advisor. Get me out of here, quick!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">{playername}：</span><br>
Is that you, Officer Zenker?<br>
Isn't this supposed to be Section Zero's secret base? How'd you end up as a captive?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Admiral Zenker：</span><br>
*sigh*... It's a long story.<br>
It all began on a rainy night 13 years ago...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">{playername}：</span><br>
Sure sounds like a long story...<br>
(I can stick to the script here, or deviate from it...)<br>
<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项1：Are you the infiltrator?</span>'''''<br>

<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Admiral Zenker：</span><br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项1）</span>'''''E-excuse me?!<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项1）</span>'''''No, I'm not! You know who it is!<br>

'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项1）</span>'''''(Talk about a sudden development.)<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项1）</span>'''''Who?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Admiral Zenker：</span><br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项1）</span>'''''Instructor Azuma from the police academy! She's the infiltrator!<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项1）</span>'''''She attacked me in order to fabricate evidence and pin all the blame on me!<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项1）</span>'''''She's behind all of this! Even the explosion in the archives from yesterday!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">{playername}：</span><br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项1）</span>'''''Understood. I'll take it from here.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Admiral Zenker：</span><br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项2）</span>'''''That was a dark, windy night. It's been so long since then, and I still can't forget the things that happened that day.<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项2）</span>'''''I was still in middle school back then, and me and my friends were at a party at an amusement park. We had so much fun that we lost track of time.<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项2）</span>'''''When I decided it was time to leave, it had already grown late.<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项2）</span>'''''It started raining, and since I was alone, I was startled and anxious, so I wanted nothing more than to be home as soon as possible.<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项2）</span>'''''So, I ran around in the dark and ended up getting lost.<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项2）</span>'''''Sometime later, I spotted two shady figures in dark clothes standing under a dim streetlight.<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项2）</span>'''''It looked like they were doing some kind of transaction.<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项2）</span>'''''My curiosity got the better of me, so I snuck up to them to try to get a look at what they were doing.<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项2）</span>'''''That was when–<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">{playername}：</span><br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项2）</span>'''''While you were focused on them, you didn't realize there was a third person behind you.<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项2）</span>'''''They drugged you, and when you woke up, you realized you'd shrunk down to the size of a kid. Correct?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Admiral Zenker：</span><br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项2）</span>'''''What? No, nothing like that. Although, they did catch on to me.<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项2）</span>'''''As I was walking, I accidentally kicked over a can, and they heard the noise.<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项2）</span>'''''I got scared and started running, and they chased after me.<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项2）</span>'''''No matter where I went, they kept chasing after me, and all I could do was keep running for dear life.<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项2）</span>'''''I don't know how long I ran for, but I came to a stop when I blindly bumped into someone.<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项2）</span>'''''Instead of getting mad at me, though, she asked me what happened. I explained, and she fought off those two.<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项2）</span>'''''It wasn't until later that I realized that the person who helped me... was none other than Instructor Azuma.<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项2）</span>'''''Ever since that day, I wanted to be a police officer.<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项2）</span>'''''When I got into the academy, I asked for her to be my instructor.<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项2）</span>'''''3 years passed in the blink of an eye, which brings us to 10 years before today...<br>

'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项2）</span>'''''Hold it, Officer Zenker. Just give me the important parts, thanks.<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项2）</span>'''''Who attacked you? How did your assailant get inside the base?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Admiral Zenker：</span><br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项2）</span>'''''It was Instructor Azuma! I let my guard down, because I never thought she'd attack me!<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项2）</span>'''''She's the infiltrator! She was behind yesterday's bombing, too! She attacked me in order to fabricate evidence and pin all the blame on me!<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项2）</span>'''''If you're wondering how she knew how to get inside, well, that all started six years ago.<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项2）</span>'''''Back then–<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">{playername}：</span><br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项2）</span>'''''Stop! Don't. You've told me more than what I needed.<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项2）</span>'''''Last question: When did she attack you? How long has it been since she left?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Admiral Zenker：</span><br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项2）</span>'''''It was... 30-odd minutes ago! It started when–<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">{playername}：</span><br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项2）</span>'''''Okay, that's enough! I'll take it from here!<br>

Chapter 7 - Discussion Class<br>
Scene: Police academy classroom<br>
Time：20:42<br>
Date: June 26th<br>
Thanks to your rank within the police, it wasn't particularly hard to look into Instructor Azuma's activities.<br>
You arrive outside the empty classroom, where a familiar figure has been quietly waiting for you.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Azuma：</span><br>
To think you'd find me this quickly. You really are outstanding.<br>
What should I call you? "Special advisor? Or maybe you prefer, "my precious model student"?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">{playername}：</span><br>
(I can stick to the script here, or deviate from it...)<br>
<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项1：Are you the infiltrator?</span>'''''<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项2：(Just follow the script...)</span>'''''<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">{playername}：</span><br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项2）</span>'''''I don't know – are we talking as colleagues, or as instructor and student?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Azuma：</span><br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项2）</span>'''''Heehee. Turning the question back on me. That's my student.<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项2）</span>'''''If only the rest were as excellent as you.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">{playername}：</span><br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项2）</span>'''''You mean Officer Zenker?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Azuma：</span><br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项2）</span>'''''Maybe I am. Maybe I'm talking about others.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Azuma：</span><br>
It doesn't matter. The reason you're here is because you've already drawn a conclusion, no?<br>
You believed what Officer Zenker said?<br>
Then, what if I told you that I'm not the enemy? Will you believe your old teacher?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">{playername}：</span><br>
I'm not about to take either of your words without a pinch of salt. I can't reach a decision without proof.<br>
Speaking of proof, Officer Zenker gave me circumstantial evidence that you orchestrated the archive bombing. What do you have to say to that?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Azuma：</span><br>
What is true is that I did go to the archives yesterday.<br>
The reason for that, however, was to look for a file for you.<br>
Since I knew you were conducting an investigation, I feared that the crime syndicate may go to some extreme lengths to destroy evidence. That's why I acted in secret while you had the suspects' attention.<br>
As for the results, this is what I found yesterday.<br>
Thank goodness I left quickly, otherwise I doubt these records would've survived – or I, for that matter.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Film Narration：</span><br>
Azuma gives you a file. It contains records that detail how the entirety of Section Zero has long since become a stronghold for the syndicate's several infiltrators.<br>
Even more shockingly, it hints at an even deeper level of infiltration within the police.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">{playername}：</span><br>
My god... This is why you attacked Officer Zenker?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Azuma：</span><br>
Not entirely. Some of the records in there are actually from their base, recovered by me.<br>
I didn't anticipate that she'd come back in the midst of my search. Luckily, I was the physically stronger one between us.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">{playername}：</span><br>
So that's how it went down... Why didn't you report it, though?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Azuma：</span><br>
Because, by all accounts, this syndicate has been spreading its roots amongst us for many years now. You're the only person who'd even believe me.<br>
You need to be extra careful now that you've gotten your hands on this evidence.<br>
Trust no one. Anyone could be an infiltrator.<br>

Listen, the beer at this place is something else... The folks at the Akashi Beer Studio use a 72-hour, incremental cooling fermentation process...<br>
It gives their beer an amber color, and the bubbles it produces are as smooth as champagne...<br>
And the meat they use for their skewers? Comes from cattle raised the traditional way and delivered straight from Akashi Farm...<br>

Chapter 9 - So, Who is It?<br>
Scene: Police station meeting room<br>
Time：8:05<br>
Date: June 27th<br>
The next day, you gathered all the suspects in the meeting room, including Instructor Azuma and Officer Zenker.<br>
You had already drawn a conclusion in your mind, and now, the whole group was waiting for you to make your judgment.<br>
It's time to reveal the results of your sleuthing.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Film Narration：</span><br>
Seven pairs of eyes turn to look at you the moment you set foot inside.<br>
You're greeted by the faces of Police Chief Impero from Criminal Investigations, Officer Zenker from Section Zero, Assistant Officer U-552 from Section Zero...<br>
Officer Neptune from Criminal Investigations Division One, Assistant Officer Z13 from Investigations Division Two, Police Sergeant U-37 from Traffic Control, and Instructor Azuma from the police academy.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Did they all really need a second introduction? Are you getting paid per minute or something?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Film Narration：</span><br>
It's called narrative echoing. It also serves as a reminder for the audience.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Ugh...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">U-552：</span><br>
Gathering us all in one room first thing in the morning. Again. Found the rat yet, advisor?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Z13：</span><br>
It's about time we put an end to this. C'mon, tell us whatcha got. My favorite show's goin' live in a few minutes.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">U-37：</span><br>
You really live up to your rep, Advisor! I'm impressed you pinned down the infiltrator within just a few days!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Neptune：</span><br>
That crook will pay for setting fire to our station. So, tell us, who is it?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Admiral Zenker：</span><br>
It's Instructor Azuma! The evidence is clear! Why won't you call her out?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Azuma：</span><br>
Advisor, remember what I told you last night. Put yourself first.<br>
Regardless of your answer, I'll always be on your side.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Impero：</span><br>
Well, what do you have for us? The brilliant Chief Impero waits with bated breath.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Film Narration：</span><br>
The time has come to make the final call. In the end, who is it?<br>
<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项1：Is it you, the narrator?</span>'''''<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Film Narration：</span><br>
No, it's not.<br>
The time has come to make the final call. In the end, who is it?<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
......<br>
<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项1：It's nobody!</span>'''''<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项2：It's all of you!</span>'''''<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项3：It's me!</span>'''''<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项4：It's the Police Commissioner!</span>'''''<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项5：It's the director!</span>'''''<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Film Narration：</span><br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项1）</span>'''''You announce the result of your investigation – that there are no infiltrators.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">U-552：</span><br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项1）</span>'''''There... aren't any? Are you sure?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Impero：</span><br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项1）</span>'''''Interesting. So that's the answer you've arrived at?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Neptune：</span><br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项1）</span>'''''Hang on a minute! How can you say there isn't one? Someone blew up the archives, and that's a fact!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Admiral Zenker：</span><br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项1）</span>'''''Yeah! And Instructor Azuma attacked me! Why would she do that if she WASN'T an infiltrator?<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项1）</span>'''''The answer is: This was all part of an extremely realistic security drill drafted by our superiors!<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项1）</span>'''''The fire in the archives was indeed a serious matter, but we put it out quickly.<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项1）</span>'''''As for all the suspicious intel we've seen in the past few days, it was bait that the Police Commissioner planted to reveal potential weak links within the station.<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项1）</span>'''''All this is to say, there weren't any infiltrators in the first place.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Azuma：</span><br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项1）</span>'''''So that's how it was... That information I saw was no more than a red herring.<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项1）</span>'''''Officer Zenker, I'm sorry for what I did.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Admiral Zenker：</span><br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项1）</span>'''''I don't even know what to say... The people at HQ must really have nothing better to do.<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项1）</span>'''''This was not only a waste of time and resources, but it also strained our relationships.<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项1）</span>'''''...I'm sorry, Instructor Azuma. I had the wrong idea.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项1）</span>'''''Glad we managed to clear up this misunderstanding.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Film Narration：</span><br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项1）</span>'''''And so, with the fear of the station being infiltrated dispelled, you decide to return to headquarters to give your report.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项1）</span>'''''Well, ladies, this is where I say goodbye. Hopefully, I'll see you again.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Impero：</span><br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项1）</span>'''''Stay safe on your way home, Advisor. I hold you in high regard. May we meet again.<br>
<br>
You bade a warm goodbye to the group and started making your way back to headquarters.<br>
You gave your report to the Police Commissioner, who simply nodded in acknowledgment of it.<br>
Half a month later, it was announced that the Commissioner would go into early retirement and be succeeded by Impero.<br>
Following that, you resumed your work as a regular employee, steadily making your way up the ranks and building your career.<br>
"Focusing on your job and moving up ain't so bad, is it?"<br>

<span style="color:#ff9b93;">Neptune：</span><br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项2）</span>'''''Hold it right there! You can't just say that even as a joke!<br>
<span style="color:#ff9b93;">Admiral Zenker：</span><br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项2）</span>'''''Exactly! And let's not forget I'm a victim here! Why are you branding ME as an infiltrator?<br>
<span style="color:#ff9b93;">Z13：</span><br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项2）</span>'''''You know, this kinda makes no sense!<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项2）</span>'''''Over the past few days, you've all been working together to mix up the truths and lies in the info you've given me, sowing confusion. You were trying to throw my judgment off.<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项2）</span>'''''Luckily, Instructor Azuma came forth and gave me the truth, which exposed a weakness in your conspiracy.<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项2）</span>'''''While it's true that she was responsible for blowing up the archives, the information she provided me with was all factual.<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项2）</span>'''''She wanted out of your organization, so you used her as a distraction to divert my attention away from the rest of you.<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项2）</span>'''''Isn't that right, Chief Impero?<br>
<span style="color:#ff9b93;">Impero：</span><br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项2）</span>'''''Impressive, Advisor. Very impressive.<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项2）</span>'''''How did you figure out MY involvement in this, though?<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项2）</span>'''''Because you're the highest-ranking and least suspicious person of the bunch, yet you tried to get me on your side and convince me to stop.<br>
<span style="color:#ff9b93;">Impero：</span><br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项2）</span>'''''...And here I thought you'd be smart. What a shame.<br>
<span style="color:#ff9b93;">Neptune：</span><br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项2）</span>'''''Oh well. No helping it now that the cat's out of the bag.<br>
<span style="color:#ff9b93;">U-37：</span><br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项2）</span>'''''Ya won't be leaving this place. I locked the door.<br>
<span style="color:#ff9b93;">Z13：</span><br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项2）</span>'''''And I switched off all the security cameras. My advice? Don't try to resist arrest.<br>
<span style="color:#ff9b93;">Admiral Zenker：</span><br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项2）</span>'''''Don't worry, we won't kill you. We'll just lock you up for a bit.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项2）</span>'''''Had a feeling it'd come to this. However, you're not the only ones who came prepared.<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项2）</span>'''''I AM leaving – through the window!<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项2）</span>'''''You're up, Interpol! Get 'em!<br>
<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项2）</span>'''''Freeze, all of you! We have the building surrounded! Resistance is futile!<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项2）</span>'''''Excellent work, Partner! The route to the garage is clear. Hurry on over.<br>
<br>
You turned to the morning sun and jumped out of the window.<br>
As the infiltrators looked on in shock behind you, you slid down the sloped glass and safely escaped the police station.<br>
Not long after, Interpol arrived on the scene.<br>
You were given a medal from the Police Commissioner for a job well done.<br>
Although you had won, you now feared that the remnants of the crime syndicate would seek retribution.<br>
As such, you went off to live a happy life in anonymity in a little-known place under Interpol's protection.<br>
"A normal but happy life ain't so bad, is it?"<br>

'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项3）</span>'''''Remember, I have amnesia. It's theoretically possible that I did it, isn't it?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Admiral Zenker：</span><br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项3）</span>'''''Okay, but what about the fact that Instructor Azuma attacked me? That had nothing to do with you, did it?<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>

<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Film Narration：</span><br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项3）</span>'''''And so, having concluded your investigation in a truly astounding way, you got into a car and went back to headquarters.<br>

<br>
The mood was ever-so-slightly awkward as you bade goodbye and set out on the journey back to the police headquarters.<br>
En route, you flipped through the papers Instructor Azuma gave you and made a call to the Commissioner.<br>
But then, just as you did so...<br>
Boom! Your car burst into flames and careened off a cliff.<br>
The next day, the self-incriminating testimony you had left reached the Commissioner's desk. Your fiery death was written off as a suicide fueled by your guilty conscience.<br>
Half a month later, it was announced that the Commissioner would go into early retirement and be succeeded by Impero.<br>
Then, the world simply kept spinning. As though nothing had happened.<br>

<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Impero：</span><br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项4）</span>'''''Now you have my interest. What's your reasoning?<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项4）</span>'''''It's a common trope in detective dramas that the criminal is one of the first characters introduced, you know?<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项4）</span>'''''Assuming that's true, wouldn't that make the inspector general pretty suspicious?<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项4）</span>'''''They were the first named character, yet there were no clues pointing to them this whole time.<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项4）</span>'''''Nobody knows their name, their face, or anything about them.<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项4）</span>'''''It all raises the question – who ARE they?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Film Narration：</span><br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项4）</span>'''''Aoba is the inspector general.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项4）</span>'''''Now THAT'S suspicious!<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项4）</span>'''''Aoba's also the one who tricked me into coming here under the pretense of "providing some material"!<br>

<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Impero：</span><br>

'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项4）</span>'''''Alright – head back and be on your guard. Wait for me to contact you, then we'll take her down together.<br>
<br>
The mood was bizarrely soft yet ardent as you set out on the journey back to the police headquarters.<br>
On the way there, you received a top-secret call from Chief Impero.<br>
With her help, you submitted a vague and clever report that wrapped this investigation up with an impeccable bow.<br>
Later on, you and Chief Impero successfully uncovered evidence that Commissioner Aoba possessed a huge fortune of unknown origin.<br>
Aoba was dismissed from her position and arrested. Impero was officially appointed as her successor.<br>
Thanks to your "unique connection" to the new Commissioner, you rose through the ranks at blazing speeds.<br>
In less than three years, you had become the next Police Chief.<br>
Everything was great, and so it went.<br>

'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项5）</span>'''''You announce the result of your investigation – that the film's director is the infiltrator.<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项5）</span>'''''......<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项5）</span>'''''The director is the infiltrator? Are you serious?<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项5）</span>'''''Dead serious.<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项5）</span>'''''After being here on the set for the past few days, I've fully figured out the dark undertone of this screenplay.<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项5）</span>'''''I know I need to accuse someone of being the infiltrator if I were to follow the script.<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项5）</span>'''''But, I refuse!<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项5）</span>'''''If you were to force me to just accuse someone, then I'd choose the director – Akashi!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Akashi：</span><br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项5）</span>'''''Nyaaa!<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项5）</span>'''''Scene, cut, stop, nya! Stop the cameras, nya!<br>

'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项5）</span>'''''Heh. You think I haven't been preparing for this?<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项5）</span>'''''This is no longer just YOUR movie, Akashi!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Akashi：</span><br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项5）</span>'''''...Nya? What are you talking about, nya?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ikazuchi：</span><br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项5）</span>'''''I see! So the movie is gonna completely break the fourth wall and get a surprise twist!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Inazuma：</span><br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项5）</span>'''''This story's scope will also be expanded, with richer plotlines added.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Guam：</span><br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项5）</span>'''''The same cast, the same sets, but with a brand new script! Pretty neat idea, if you ask me!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Hai Tien：</span><br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项5）</span>'''''I actually already have some ideas for the script. Allow me to be the screenwriter.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Fu Shun：</span><br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项5）</span>'''''We should add a ton more cuts, too! And fill the story with adventures!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Baltimore：</span><br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项5）</span>'''''And special effects, and intense fight scenes, and car chases!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Reno：</span><br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项5）</span>'''''Might even be able to squeeze in some superhero stuff!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Lützow：</span><br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项5）</span>'''''I vote to put in vampires somewhere!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Nubian：</span><br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项5）</span>'''''Grrr... We can't forget about the fantasy adventure elements!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ayanami：</span><br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项5）</span>'''''Yes. I'm ready for just that.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Javelin：</span><br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项5）</span>'''''The legendary team of adventurers...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Z23：</span><br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项5）</span>'''''Has come back together!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Laffey：</span><br>

<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Kirov：</span><br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项5）</span>'''''The detective drama parts stand to be improved. More big scenes, more international flavor!<br>

Eventually, all the filming was done.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Akashi：</span><br>
Nyahaha – that's a wrap, nya! Great work, team, nya!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Z13：</span><br>
We're done already? Aww, I was hoping for more scenes with the Commander!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Admiral Zenker：</span><br>
I was nervous for the entire shoot... I should start making more backup plans.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Memphis：</span><br>
Nicely done, Commander!<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Ah, Memphis, good timing. I wanted to ask you something.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Memphis：</span><br>
Oh? What?<br>
