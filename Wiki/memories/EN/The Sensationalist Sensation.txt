The Sensationalist Sensation<br>
<br>
Reporting In<br>
Office - Morning<br>
Before I can even sit down at my desk, a girl thrusts the latest issue of the "Port Journal" into my hands.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Alfredo Oriani：</span><br>
Heheheh~ The best cure to morning grogginess is reading all about the latest and greatest scoops! It gets your blood pumping, which also makes you more productive, y'know?<br>
<br>
The girl is none other than Alfredo Oriani, the local sparky journalist and my recently appointed secretary.<br>
She badgered me for the position, insisting it would help her get scoops she otherwise couldn't. So I caved in and appointed her.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Alfredo Oriani：</span><br>
C'mon, give it a read! I know you're gonna love this issue, 'cause the featured piece is on you!<br>
<br>
...That's already a red flag.<br>
"Exclusive: The Commander's Habits and Daily Schedule Revealed."<br>
"What Really Goes on Behind the Office's Closed Doors?"<br>
"Our Universally Adored Commander's Port Planning – An In-Depth Analysis."<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Alfredo Oriani：</span><br>
Pretty good, right? You're looking at pages and pages dedicated to telling the story of who you REALLY are!<br>
And guess what? This issue broke all sales records to date!<br>
<br>
......<br>
I hold my head in my hands, simply stunned by her journalistic ability.<br>
Even though this is just a collection of trivial secretarial matters, she has managed to turn that material into salacious stories.<br>
I couldn't decide whether to praise her or lecture her for it.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Alfredo Oriani：</span><br>
Oh yeah, Commander, you know what the hardest part of making an article is?<br>
<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项1："Making a catchy headline."</span>'''''<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项2："Writing a story that sells."</span>'''''<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项3："Finding the scoops hidden in plain sight."</span>'''''<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Alfredo Oriani：</span><br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项1）</span>'''''No, that's one of the ABC's of journalism!<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项1）</span>'''''If you can come up with a good title, the rest of the article practically writes itself!<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项1）</span>'''''The real tricky part? Finding material worth filling up a few pages!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Alfredo Oriani：</span><br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项2）</span>'''''I'll grant you, turning facts into cash isn't a straightforward process, but it's not particularly hard as long as you keep up with the port's trends and stuff.<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项2）</span>'''''What IS hard is scoring a hot scoop and being the first to tell everyone else about it.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Alfredo Oriani：</span><br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项3）</span>'''''Bingo! You're absolutely right! That's what we call journalistic intuition – the ability to find article-worthy material!<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项3）</span>'''''It's what journalists live by. Without it, you won't make it for long.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Alfredo Oriani：</span><br>
The fact is, news happens around us constantly! But finding the diamond scoops in the dirt of unremarkable events, that's hard work.<br>
<br>
I suppose by her analogy, I'm the diamond mine. Being the subject of more and more of her articles in the future seems like an inevitability, and all I can do is prepare myself for it.<br>

The Sensationalist Sensation<br>
<br>
Competing for the Spotlight<br>
The next morning, I'm walking down a sunny road minding my own business–<br>
Then all of a sudden, I get the hunch that I'm being watched.<br>
I keep hearing strange clicks, too, like the sound of a camera shutter.<br>
Wait a second... Is that who I think it is?<br>
<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项1："Alfredo? Is that you?"</span>'''''<br>
<br>
The bushes by the road rustle and shake, and soon, Alfredo Oriani pops through the leaves.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Alfredo Oriani：</span><br>
Heheh! Morning, Commander!<br>
I wanted to snap some pics of you in your element. Didn't expect you'd catch on to me THIS fast.<br>
Guess you've got a keen intuition of your own! You might be cut out to be a journalist!<br>
<br>
The cover for her camera lens is off, suggesting she used it just moments ago.<br>
"I had a feeling it was you taking sneaky photos."<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Alfredo Oriani：</span><br>
Sorry, maybe I should've asked for permission, but I need good photos for the next issue of the Port Journal.<br>
Let's not forget I'm not the only newsdealer around. There's Aoba, for a start. We might collaborate every now and then, but we're still rivals in the end!<br>
I strive to publish the best tabloid on the newsstands, and to do that, I need more juicy scoops!<br>
<br>
"I see... Sounds like things are pretty heated between the two of you."<br>
"Haven't you already gotten all the news you're going to need, though?"<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Alfredo Oriani：</span><br>
The latest issue of the Port Journal came out yesterday! I can't fill a newspaper with just one day's worth of news!<br>
While the port is a busy place, not everything that happens here is worth reporting on. Plus, I'm not always the first to nab the scoop.<br>
I know a good story when I see one, but there's no point digging when there's no gems in the ground, y'know?<br>
And I've been out of solid leads for a while now... Front-page news doesn't exactly happen every day of the week.<br>
*sigh*... In hindsight, I should've saved my in-depth coverage of you for the cover of the next issue.<br>
<br>
...Well, I'm glad I wasn't turned into front-page material.<br>
On the other hand, Alfredo looks bummed out about her predicament. I should think about some way to help her.<br>
"So, she needs a good story..."<br>
A while after parting ways with Alfredo, I suddenly come up with an idea for a scoop.<br>
However, it's up to her to seize the opportunity. If her journalist's intuition is on point, she will.<br>
At any rate, I'll first need to make some calls and set the stage.<br>

<br>
A Tip from a Friend<br>
Sardegna Empire Dormitory - Nighttime<br>
Alfredo returns to her dormitory, feeling dejected about her lackluster findings.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Vincenzo Gioberti ：</span><br>
Hm-hmm-hm~♪ Oh, hey, Alfredo.<br>
I've got chocolate muffins and almond cookies. You want some?<br>
Aquila took them out of the oven just minutes ago!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Alfredo Oriani：</span><br>
Thanks, GB, but I'm not hungry...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Vincenzo Gioberti ：</span><br>
Our favorite journalist is feeling blue AND has no appetite?! What on earth happened today, Alfredo?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Leonardo da Vinci：</span><br>
Well... If you don't want 'em, then I'll help myself to the cookies!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Alfredo Oriani：</span><br>
Sure... I'll be in my room...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Leonardo da Vinci：</span><br>
Not so fast! I can't ignore a friend who obviously needs someone to talk to.<br>
When you're down in the dumps, you need a hearty helping of sugar to pick you up.<br>
Sit down, have a muffin, and tell us what's wrong. We'll work something out.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Alfredo Oriani：</span><br>
But... *sigh*... Okay, basically...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Vincenzo Gioberti ：</span><br>
Ah... So you're struggling to find a bombshell of a news story. Sounds tricky.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Torricelli：</span><br>
Hehehe... That's easy... Just test some explosive ordnance in a field somewhere...<br>
Da Vinci could help you with that, no problem...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Leonardo da Vinci：</span><br>
Not a bad idea, actually... Tell you what, I'll hit up Yuubari for scientific advice. We'll cook up a big bomb for you.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Alfredo Oriani：</span><br>
No, no, no! When I said "bombshell," I didn't mean it literally!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Leonardo da Vinci：</span><br>
Okay, but... Setting off a bomb WOULD cause a big sensation, wouldn't it?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Alfredo Oriani：</span><br>
Sure, but that flies in the face of my journalistic ethos!<br>
I can't just go around staging stories for the sake of attention, y'know!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Leonardo da Vinci：</span><br>
Hmm... Back to square one, then.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Alfredo Oriani：</span><br>
Yeah... And if I can't land a good scoop soon, people are gonna stop reading the Port Journal...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Leonardo da Vinci：</span><br>
Wait, I know! There's bound to be some news material at the upcoming ball!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Alfredo Oriani：</span><br>
What ball?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Leonardo da Vinci：</span><br>
You haven't heard? They're organizing a huge ball soon. All the factions are gonna be there, no doubt bringing juicy rumors with them and whatnot.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Alfredo Oriani：</span><br>
You're right... That IS a goldmine of scoops waiting to be uncovered...<br>
Hang on, when they did announce this ball? And how come I first about it from you, the hermit who sits indoors and tinkers all day?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Leonardo da Vinci：</span><br>
Hehehe~ Let's just say a little bird told me♪<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Alfredo Oriani：</span><br>
*sigh*... If this isn't proof that I've fallen off as a journalist, I don't know what is...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Leonardo da Vinci：</span><br>
Hey, I didn't mean it like that! It's a lot more mundane than you think!<br>
I only know about it because the Commander asked me to design some stage equipment for the ball, okay?<br>
Furthermore, the whole thing is still in the early planning stages. If you want to get a solid head start, you've got plenty of time to prepare.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Alfredo Oriani：</span><br>
Ohh, okay. Thanks a ton for the tip, Teach!<br>
This is my lucky break... Not only can I take behind-the-scenes photos of the ball, I can also use it as an excuse to report on the Commander!<br>
I can see the headlines already! I just have to get ahead of my rivals and secure an exclusive scoop.<br>
Alright! Operation Scoop Goldmine is a go!<br>

<br>
Operation Scoop Goldmine<br>
Office - Early morning<br>
There are several back issues of the Port Journal on my desk, left there by Alfredo.<br>
Even if these magazines are old news, I'm curious about what they say.<br>
I have a bit of time to kill before my shift starts, so I might as well have a look.<br>
"An Amazing Insight Into the Royal Maids' Daily Lives"... "The Shocking Secrets of Sardegna's Dormitory"...<br>
I get engrossed and lose track of time. Then, out of the blue...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Alfredo Oriani：</span><br>
Ding-dong! Morning, Commander! You sure are early today.<br>
<br>
Alfredo throws open the door and steps into the office. Judging by her elated attitude, she must be expecting to report some big news today.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Alfredo Oriani：</span><br>
Oh, am I late? ...I'm not? Phew, that's good.<br>
Why am I so fired up, you ask? Heheh, well, it's because I've found a solution to my previously mentioned lack of newsworthy material!<br>
<br>
She proceeds to explain her plan with great enthusiasm. I sit and listen...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Alfredo Oriani：</span><br>
As the saying goes – where there's people, there's news!<br>
And with a huge social event like a ball, interesting things are guaranteed to happen!<br>
<br>
"I don't think that's a real saying."<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Alfredo Oriani：</span><br>
It'll become one if I say it enough times! That's how all sayings are established, y'know!<br>
Wait, I just realized... Won't I stick out if I dress up and go snooping around the ball?<br>
People will raise their guard once they know a journalist is around, and then there's no way I'll land a good scoop...<br>
<br>
"So you're going to blend in with the guests and take sneaky photos?"<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Alfredo Oriani：</span><br>
No, nothing like that! I'm gonna do an undercover coverage! Under-coverage, if you will.<br>
But to do that, I'll need a partner who can back me up...<br>
Know a good candidate for the job, Commander? If you catch my drift.<br>
<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项1："Either da Vinci or Bristol."</span>'''''<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项2："I'll do it."</span>'''''<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Alfredo Oriani：</span><br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项1）</span>'''''*sigh*... Don't get me wrong, it's a good suggestion since I'm friends with them both...<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项1）</span>'''''But what I'm really asking is if YOU will go to the ball with me, Commander.<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项1）</span>'''''Sheesh, maybe your intuition isn't as good as I thought...<br>
<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项1）</span>'''''"My bad, I should've taken the hint. I'll gladly go with you."<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Alfredo Oriani：</span><br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项1）</span>'''''Hehehe~ Thanks a ton, Commander!<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项1）</span>'''''Remember to rehearse and be ready for anything at the ball! I'll see you then, partner.<br>
<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项2）</span>'''''"But I'll also be keeping an eye on you. I don't fully trust you not to cause a stir if left unsupervised."<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Alfredo Oriani：</span><br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项2）</span>'''''Heheh, I knew I could count on you!<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项2）</span>'''''Oh, could you also give me your thoughts from a reader's perspective later during the editing stage? I'd really appreciate it~<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项2）</span>'''''Remember to rehearse and be ready for anything at the ball! I'll see you then, partner.<br>

Dressing the Part<br>
Later, on the day of the ball...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Alfredo Oriani：</span><br>
Voila! What do you think, Commander? Looks pretty good, right?<br>
<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项1："It looks amazing on you."</span>'''''<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项2："It's the perfect disguise."</span>'''''<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Alfredo Oriani：</span><br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项1）</span>'''''Aww, you mean it? Let's just hope it'll actually help me blend in with the guests...<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项1）</span>'''''At any rate, thanks!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Alfredo Oriani：</span><br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项2）</span>'''''Heheh~ It's not JUST a disguise, though! I've practiced my dance moves just for tonight.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Alfredo Oriani：</span><br>
Anyway, time to get this show on the road. Operation Scoop Goldmine starts now!<br>
Stick close to me, Commander. I need you to cover me while I take notes and photos, so don't raise any suspicion!<br>
<br>
And so, I accompany Alfredo on her hunt for scoops under the pretense that we're simply dance partners.<br>
A short while later, she and I stroll around the backstage, snapping photos of shipgirls in moments of graceful leisure.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Alfredo Oriani：</span><br>
Whoa, there's news to be found that-a-way, because my scoop senses are tingling! Come with me, Commander!<br>
<br>
...And pictures of them in less-than-graceful moments. I wonder how they'll react to seeing them.<br>
Our activities were questioned a couple of times, but luckily, I somehow managed to clear us of suspicion each time.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Alfredo Oriani：</span><br>
Heheh, this is all pretty solid material. I think this next issue of the Port Journal will be my magnum opus!<br>
Also... *yawn*... I'm pooped. The exhaustion is catching up to me now...<br>
The ball is coming to a close, too, but we haven't even set foot on the dance floor yet...<br>
You know what? Let's dance, Commander.<br>
<br>
"What happened to being exhausted?"<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Alfredo Oriani：</span><br>
A chance to dance with you comes only once in a blue moon! Being a little tired won't stop me from doing something I like.<br>
I'm used to working tirelessly anyway, editing articles late into the night to deliver news as fresh as can be!<br>
I may burn through physical energy while doing stuff I like, but there's no shortage of mental energy left in my tank~<br>
If you were to ask me how I can just keep going seemingly forever, then that's my answer, I suppose.<br>
So what do you say, Commander? May I have this dance?<br>
O-one thing, though... I've only practiced my moves a little bit, so promise you won't laugh! Okay?<br>

<br>
Putting It All Together !<br>
Later, after the ball...<br>
Alfredo and I are back in my office, sorting through the material she gathered.<br>
She gets straight to work, forgoing even changing out of her dress. I ask her why she's in such a rush.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Alfredo Oriani：</span><br>
'Cause I've gotta capitalize on my flash of inspiration before it's gone!<br>
I've come up with a ton of good ideas, and if I don't put pen to paper now, I'll have forgotten them by tomorrow.<br>
All that is to say, I don't have time to change outfits!<br>
<br>
"Working all day gathering scoops, then sorting through them well into the night... Being a journalist sounds exhausting."<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Alfredo Oriani：</span><br>
Hey, it's not like I do this EVERY day.<br>
It ebbs and flows. Sometimes there's a lot on my plate, sometimes there's pretty much nothing.<br>
Anyway! Help me sift through this stuff or we'll be here until morning!<br>
<br>
I take a seat and look through the photos she took.<br>
While it's dubious they have much journalistic merit, they are excellent attention-grabbers.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Alfredo Oriani：</span><br>
Heheheh... Putting some gossip next to these photos will undoubtedly reel in more people!<br>
<br>
It's overwhelming just how many photos she took. I can't even guess WHEN she took the majority of them.<br>
Stealth photography might be her secret talent... I'll need to be more vigilant around her in the future.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Alfredo Oriani：</span><br>
Commander, have you gone through them all yet? Okay, sweet.<br>
In that case, got any ideas for what the front-page headline should be?<br>
Don't overthink it! This isn't a super serious tabloid or anything.<br>
Pretend you're my intern and put yourself in the shoes of a reader. What kind of headline would grab YOUR attention?<br>
<br>
"I have no aspirations of becoming a journalist, but if you insist. I'd say something like..."<br>
<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项1："Interesting Tidbits from the Ball."</span>'''''<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项2："Ball Guests' Embarrassing Secrets Caught on Camera!"</span>'''''<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Alfredo Oriani：</span><br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项1）</span>'''''I mean... It's serviceable, but it's kinda boring. It's gotta make you go, "I HAVE to know what this is about!"<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项1）</span>'''''See, I was thinking something like, "Ball Guests' Embarrassing Secrets Caught on Camera!"<br>
<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项1）</span>'''''Yup, that's exactly the kind of headline you'd see from her.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Alfredo Oriani：</span><br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项2）</span>'''''Whoa! You're a genius, Commander!<br>
<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项2）</span>'''''"I don't think I like getting praised for coming up with that..."<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Alfredo Oriani：</span><br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项2）</span>'''''Like it or not, I'm going with it! This issue's gonna spread like wildfire!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Alfredo Oriani：</span><br>
Thanks for the help! I reckon I'll have this cut and printed in a few days!<br>

<br>
Someone Else's Front-Page News<br>
Early morning, several days later...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Alfredo Oriani：</span><br>
*yaaawn*... Morning, Commander.<br>
<br>
Alfredo enters my office looking sleep-deprived. Again. She's been like this for the past few days, in fact.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Alfredo Oriani：</span><br>
Mgh... Hey, I'm fine. Don't worry about me...<br>
I've just been really busy making articles out of the material I got from the ball...<br>
Sorry 'bout my lack of energy. I know you've been singlehandedly doing all the work I'm supposed to do as your secretary. I really appreciate it!<br>
Now my slacking days are over, though! The latest issue of the Port Journal is finished! It's all about the ball. Check it out!<br>
<br>
She hands me the magazine, which does have the look of a magnum opus about it. However, her expression turns from elated to sour.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Alfredo Oriani：</span><br>
Unfortunately, my work was for nothing...<br>
All because of THIS!<br>
<br>
She hands me another newspaper. The front page features a bold headline...<br>
"You Will Not Believe Who the Commander Danced With at the Ball!"<br>
Below it is a picture of me and Alfredo in the middle of our dance. It seems someone photographed us without our knowledge.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Alfredo Oriani：</span><br>
Frickin' Aoba!<br>
She knew you're all the buzz right now and she beat me to it!<br>
Urgh! The headline just reeks of sensationalism, too! I can't believe she stole my spotlight with THIS of all things!<br>
<br>
It's pretty hypocritical to call others sensationalist, considering the headline she herself chose, but I digress.<br>
"Look at this way – you still made front-page news."<br>
"Maybe not in the way you'd hoped, but the fact remains that you're the talk of the port now."<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Alfredo Oriani：</span><br>
Oh please! That's not funny, Commander!<br>
*sigh*... Even though I got played for a fool, somehow I don't feel salty about it.<br>
Because at the end of the day, I did get to have an unforgettable dance with you♪<br>
Hey, that gives me an idea! I could always embellish a few details and feature that story in the next issue!<br>
Then throw in a spicy headline, like... "The Secret Romance Between the Commander and a Dancer"! Yeah, THAT'LL cause a real sensation!<br>
<br>
"I invoke my right to remain anonymous."<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Alfredo Oriani：</span><br>
Nuooooooooooooooo!<br>
