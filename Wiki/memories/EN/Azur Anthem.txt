<br>
This is the story of an ocean in which battles come again and again.<br>
Of a cerulean stage upon which steel-clad girls dance.<br>
This is the story of a resonating passion and an anthem of hope—<br>
One day, in the waters around the port...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Admiral Hipper：</span><br>
The situation looks pretty bad from the air, huh?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Sheffield：</span><br>
Yes. The ship that passed through here is being attacked by a "hologram."<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Admiral Hipper：</span><br>
Damnit, why now of all times...?!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Sheffield：</span><br>
Why indeed. It can't be pure coincidence that this incident occurred just before the concert was slated to begin.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Admiral Hipper：</span><br>
So, what are our options? Contacting Akagi's group is a given, but there has to be something we can do here...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Sheffield：</span><br>
I shall not allow anything to interfere with my Master's concert. We'll make our stand here—<br>
<br>
………………！<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Admiral Hipper：</span><br>
Sheffy, what the heck is that? Wait, are you kidding me?!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Sheffield：</span><br>
Guh...! Emergency retreat, quickly!<br>
<br>
Port - Temporary Office, at approximately the same time<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Akashi：</span><br>
The idols who arrived at our base are none other than... these girls, nya!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Haruka Amami：</span><br>
Y-yes! I'm Haruka Amami, an idol from 765 Production! Pleased to meet you!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Mami Futami：</span><br>
Saaaame! By the way, the name's Mami Futami!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ami Futami：</span><br>
And I'm Ami Futami! Nice to meetcha~!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Iori Minase：</span><br>
Wait, you're already giving formal introductions? My goodness!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Z23：</span><br>
Seriously! Akashi, what are you making them say?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Azusa Miura：</span><br>
Now, now, there's nothing wrong with some common courtesy. Let's not get panicked here...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ritsuko Akizuki：</span><br>
Azusa's right. Panicking won't do us any good, so we should try to get a grasp of the situation first.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Chihaya Kisaragi：</span><br>
First of all, we should get to know each other. Right?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Prinz Eugen：</span><br>
Agreed. Imagine my surprise when such a big, happy family showed up out of nowhere~<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Z23：</span><br>
Indeed... Though this wouldn't be the first time something like this has happened...<br>
This is the home port of Azur Lane, and I'm Z23, a shipgirl.<br>
Am I correct in assuming that all of you are idols from 765 Production?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Chihaya Kisaragi：</span><br>
That you are. My name is Chihaya Kisaragi.<br>
And these are my colleagues, Iori, Asuza, and Ritsuko. We're all from the same agency.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Mami Futami：</span><br>
Before I ended up here, I was just taking some photos to use as film references when suddenly~ Bam! My vision went white!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ami Futami：</span><br>
Then we found ourselves here. Or something like that.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Akagi：</span><br>
I see. Unfortunately, Commander isn't here right now... Wait, actually, maybe it's fortunate that Commander isn't here yet...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Kaga：</span><br>
Sis... Err, I mean, Akagi, what's gotten into you?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Akagi：</span><br>
Why, nothing at all! Akashi, did you notice anything unusual when these ladies showed up?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Akashi：</span><br>
Unusual? What do you mean, nya?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Prinz Eugen：</span><br>
A sudden energy fluctuation. It's happened before, right?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Akashi：</span><br>
Oh, nyow that you mentioned it! Um, you see, I was just so excited about the new office...<br>
There was a little blip in the energy readings, nya... and it was getting weaker and weaker...<br>
Oh, it's gone, nya.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ritsuko Akizuki：</span><br>
Excuse me, but, what does that mean?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Z23：</span><br>
There have been occurrences of people suddenly "appearing" here before, and it's usually accompanied by a large energy reaction.<br>
It sometimes lets us see where you came from, and by taking advantage of it, we might be able to send you back home.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Prinz Eugen：</span><br>
Well, that doesn't seem to be the case this time.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Communicator：</span><br>
Before you say that, you might want to come over here first.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Prinz Eugen：</span><br>
Oh, it's my dear sister~<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Admiral Hipper：</span><br>
They've sure made a mess out of this "Concert Sea Area."<br>

Port - Concert Sea Area<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Cleveland μ：</span><br>
Cleveland here. Did you get the video I sent you?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ami Futami：</span><br>
There's a city on the ocean?!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Haruka Amami：</span><br>
It's so pretty...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ritsuko Akizuki：</span><br>
Wow, it even says "765 Production" in huge letters...<br>
Just to make sure, there's no 765 Production in your world, right?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Akashi：</span><br>
Of course not, nya. This is the first time I've ever heard of it, nya.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ami Futami：</span><br>
D-does this mean we really got spirited away?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Mami Futami：</span><br>
*gulp* ....Wait, actually, I think we got reincarnated in another world!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Iori Minase：</span><br>
It's too early to say. And what the heck do you mean by that?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Cleveland μ：</span><br>
Um, well, how do I explain this...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Sheffield μ：</span><br>
There's no point concealing the truth. I shall explain.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Cleveland μ：</span><br>
Err, well, I was thinking about holding a big concert for the port, so I started assembling a venue here.<br>
When I say assembling, I pretty much mean just setting up the main stage. The rest are just holographic generators to create a certain environment.<br>
And what you see right now are the holograms...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Azusa Miura：</span><br>
So... you created the whole city that's on the ocean?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Sheffield μ：</span><br>
That's about the gist of it. We even decided to incorporate a logo that you might find familiar.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Akagi μ：</span><br>
So, the phenomena related to our visitors from another world occurred in a place completely unrelated to them...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Chihaya Kisaragi：</span><br>
Excuse me, but if there's any chance we can find some clues about how to get back home...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Kaga：</span><br>
I know. Sheffield, please let us know if you find out anything new.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Sheffield μ：</span><br>
Naturally. I shall have things squared away by the time my Master returns.<br>

Port - Concert Sea Area<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Gascogne μ：</span><br>
Confirming "enemy" sighting. Requesting "concert" preparations.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Admiral Hipper μ：</span><br>
Figures that these things would pop out if we change the area to resemble the place the girls came from.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Azusa Miura：</span><br>
It's a bit blurry looking from here, but that definitely looks like Iori...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Haruka Amami：</span><br>
Are those things... our clones?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Kaga：</span><br>
Close enough. Consider them as fakes made from your data.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Iori Minase：</span><br>
Those holograms were originally meant for use during concerts, but now they're acting as guardians for the machine?<br>
...It's hard to believe, even after seeing it.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Cleveland μ：</span><br>
Yeah... When I first heard about it, I was like, "how the heck is that possible?"<br>
But if we don't fight and win, we won't be able to get through this area.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Azusa Miura：</span><br>
Wait, fight...? Does that mean we have to shoot at Iori with our cannons...?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Sheffield μ：</span><br>
Nay, only the Muse system is capable of defeating our opponents... with the power of music.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Chihaya Kisaragi：</span><br>
I'm totally lost here...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Admiral Hipper μ：</span><br>
It's a special rigging we've been equipped with. It allows us to increase our performance power as we fight.<br>
Oh right, we did tell you that this sea area was originally a concert venue, right?<br>
In other words, instead of using conventional warfare, we fight by seeing who can put on the best concert.<br>
...But it's such a pain in the ass! If not for that idiot, who would even come up with an idea like this...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Cleveland μ：</span><br>
Woah, hold on, our opponents have already begun their performance! Hold tight for a hot second, I'm going to go and gather some more info!<br>

<br>
―――！！<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Sheffield μ：</span><br>
Incredible...!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Cleveland μ：</span><br>
That's insane... What kind of performance was that...?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Gascogne μ：</span><br>
In terms of Vocals, Dance, and Visuals— the opponent's performance is superior in every aspect.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Admiral Hipper μ：</span><br>
What do we do, Akagi? We're not going to be able to get through here.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Akagi μ：</span><br>
...Retreat. It pains me to say this, but we've been thoroughly defeated.<br>
<br>
……………<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Haruka Amami：</span><br>
We really lost, huh...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Mami Futami：</span><br>
.........<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Akagi μ：</span><br>
I apologize for my unsightly performance.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Z23：</span><br>
D-don't give up! It might be frustrating, but at least nobody got hurt, and we can come back as many times as needed.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Prinz Eugen：</span><br>
That's true... If you undergo special training and prepare thoroughly, you can always face them again later.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Akashi：</span><br>
It wasn't Akashi's plan to have everything be settled through concerts, nya~<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Kaga：</span><br>
Nobody knows exactly why it happened. Akashi, you should focus on analyzing how that city came into being in the first place.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Iori Minase：</span><br>
I won't let those clones get away with this!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Azusa Miura：</span><br>
I feel bad that you have to go through all of this because of us...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Chihaya Kisaragi：</span><br>
(The Azur Lane girls are putting on a pretty good show, but...)<br>
...it feels like they don't know who they're singing for...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Haruka Amami：</span><br>
Chihaya? Why are you mumbling to yourself...?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Chihaya Kisaragi：</span><br>
Huh? I what? Oh, err, I guess I was thinking about the impression I got from the concert out loud...<br>
It might've simply been because our opponents were too strong, but simply singing is not enough to convey the feelings that can move one's heart.<br>
While I don't believe that there are winners or losers when it comes to concerts, I'd say this is the main reason for our "defeat."<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ritsuko Akizuki：</span><br>
The potential is definitely there, but what you currently lack is professionalism.<br>
I'm not saying you all have to become professional idols, but you're going to need a certain level of pro finesse if you want to keep moving forward.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Everyone：</span><br>
……………！<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">？？？：</span><br>
I have heard the lamentations of my subjects!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Sheffield μ：</span><br>
Your Majesty...!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Queen Elizabeth：</span><br>
Queen Elizabeth of the Royal Navy has arrived! And what a marvelous suggestion I just heard!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Akashi：</span><br>
Nya?! One of our sponsors has arrived, nya!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Queen Elizabeth：</span><br>
If you are unable to defeat those clones, then you must undergo special training and try again! Also, do deploy the other Muse units!<br>
Can we also count on the cooperation of the idols of 765 Production?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ritsuko Akizuki：</span><br>
*gasp*...!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Azusa Miura：</span><br>
Oh my...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Kaga：</span><br>
What are you saying all of a sudden...? These girls aren't a part of Azur Lane. They're just ordinary people who've been blown here from their world.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Warspite：</span><br>
I agree! Your Majesty, please consider...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Queen Elizabeth：</span><br>
I know, I know! However, if we don't investigate that location, there's no way to get these girls back home, correct?<br>
Most importantly, the Royal Navy is an official sponsor! It would reflect poorly upon us to leave the venue in its current condition!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Chihaya Kisaragi：</span><br>
Hmm, I see. If there's anything we can do to help...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ami Futami：</span><br>
Now, this is something I can get behind. We're all in!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Mami Futami：</span><br>
We can be idols spanning across worlds... Nihihi, I like the sound of that!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Akagi μ：</span><br>
Thank you. We appreciate your cooperation.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Azusa Miura：</span><br>
It's decided then. But, umm...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Iori Minase：</span><br>
We're gonna be working together now! Isn't that great?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Haruka Amami：</span><br>
Yeah, I'm looking forward to it! Let's give it our all, everyone!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Akashi：</span><br>
Hehehe...<br>
Professional idols... I can already smell a new business opportunity, nya...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Z23：</span><br>
Calm down, Akashi... They're just going to be advising us.<br>
They'll basically only be helping out with rehearsals and lessons, so don't go cooking up any weird plans.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ritsuko Akizuki：</span><br>
Um, if I'm remembering correctly, Akashi and Z23, yes?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Z23：</span><br>
Miss Ritsuko? Did you need something?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ritsuko Akizuki：</span><br>
Actually, I was a bit concerned about the rigging that the fake Iori was wearing...<br>

Heave, ho... All righty, I'll leave this over here~<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Javelin：</span><br>
Great! Thanks a ton!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Laffey：</span><br>
Laffey is out of energy... Going back to sleep...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Haruka Amami：</span><br>
Laffey, please don't fall asleep on the equipment!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Laffey：</span><br>
Then, the sofa...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Javelin：</span><br>
Jeez, Laffey, come help out a bit more! It's not easy setting up all the equipment in the office!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Admiral Graf Spee：</span><br>
I thought we were just doing a test run, but I guess we ended up doing a full-scale setup.<br>
I suppose this is part of being a pro idol, huh... I remember Saratoga saying the same thing.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Azusa Miura：</span><br>
Hehe. You've got to look the part first, after all~<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Chihaya Kisaragi：</span><br>
Indeed. I can see that being a full-time idol isn't an emphasis for the shipgirls here, so in addition to the normal lessons...<br>
Haruka suggested that it's important for you to get a taste of what it's like to live as an actual idol.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Akagi μ：</span><br>
Queen Elizabeth was wise enough to adopt this plan.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Haruka Amami：</span><br>
Ahaha...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Akagi μ：</span><br>
No problem. Naturally, you'll be helping us with our training, yes?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ami Futami：</span><br>
All right, turn your arm just like this~<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Mami Futami：</span><br>
Woah, don't start practicing your dance steps before warming up first!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Taihou μ：</span><br>
Ugh... A performance that my Commander has never seen before... I'll have to consult Roon and have this recorded.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Le Malin μ：</span><br>
*gasp* *gasp*... No more... I'm not built for this...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Vampire：</span><br>
Art thou not being too draconian?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Iori Minase：</span><br>
Not at all. You'll never become a real idol if you can't even get through this!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Vampire：</span><br>
Hehehe~ Not that I disagree with that sentiment~♪<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Iori Minase：</span><br>
Are you not going to practice?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Vampire：</span><br>
Oh, that reminds me! 'tis necessary for me to procure beverages, so I shall take my leave thusly!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Iori Minase：</span><br>
...Good grief, some of the girls here really are quite something...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Azusa Miura：</span><br>
Keep up the good work, everyone! Just like that!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Javelin：</span><br>
Woah, I'm not sure I'd be able to handle that...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Laffey：</span><br>
Zzzzzz………<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Haruka Amami：</span><br>
If you can't be perfect during practice, how are you going to be perfect on-stage?<br>
We'll also be joining the lessons, so keep hanging in there!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Chihaya Kisaragi：</span><br>
That's right. We can't neglect our idol training either just because we're stuck here.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Z23：</span><br>
Everyone, the mass-produced ships are ready!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ritsuko Akizuki：</span><br>
Sorry to keep you waiting—<br>
It's time to head down to the venue!<br>

Can you hear me...?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ritsuko Akizuki：</span><br>
We're good! Loud and clear!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Admiral Graf Spee：</span><br>
According to Akashi, there's an abnormal energy reading in the waters ahead of you, so be careful.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Haruka Amami：</span><br>
Got it! You too, Javelin, keep your eyes peeled!<br>
We'll help keep watch from aboard this ship!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Javelin：</span><br>
Sure, it's our job to escort you there safely! By the way, these mass-produced ships look a little weird...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Chihaya Kisaragi：</span><br>
By mass-produced, do you mean the ships we're riding on right now?<br>
They're basically ordinary vessels that don't need to be directly manned, right?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Z23：</span><br>
Correct. As a matter of fact, shortly before the anomaly, we spotted mass-produced ships with logos of your production company.<br>
While they didn't attack us, I knew their presence couldn't bode well.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Laffey：</span><br>
As long as they're in the way, we won't be able to get through...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Azusa Miura：</span><br>
Do we have any countermeasures to get them to move out of the way?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Z23：</span><br>
Not yet, but... The strange energy reaction here probably is the root cause.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Javelin：</span><br>
We'll fight to make sure you girls can go back home, as well as to secure the safety of these waters!<br>
So you can rest easy and watch our performance from af— ...Hwuh?!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Chihaya Kisaragi：</span><br>
Javelin, what's happening?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Javelin：</span><br>
N-nothing major! I was just surprised when a building suddenly popped up in front of me!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Laffey：</span><br>
Huh...? Isn't that a hologram...?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Javelin：</span><br>
Th-that's right! It might well be! Phew... Scared the heck outta me...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Haruka Amami：</span><br>
Look, Chihaya! It's the stage!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Z23：</span><br>
Yeah, that's the stage that this entire area is built around.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ritsuko Akizuki：</span><br>
Woah, look over there! Are those clones of me and Azusa?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Haruka Amami：</span><br>
They don't seem to be moving... Is it okay for us to get a little closer?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Chihaya Kisaragi：</span><br>
...Be careful, Haruka. Even though the shipgirls are protecting us...<br>
<br>
―――！！<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Admiral Graf Spee：</span><br>
The energy readings are shooting through the roof! Everyone, get out of there, hurry!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Javelin：</span><br>
M-mass produced ships are swarming us all of a sudden?!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Z23：</span><br>
Protect our guests at all costs! Everyone, prepare for battle!<br>

Incredible...! It's just like a movie...!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Admiral Graf Spee：</span><br>
Even though those mass-produced ships are approaching the girls, they don't seem to show any intent on attacking the ships they're on.<br>
Javelin's group has been able to take advantage of this to lead them away for now... Phew...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Azusa Miura：</span><br>
But there are still ships coming towards us... Are those the clones of me and Ritsuko?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Z23：</span><br>
Look, they even have little stages underneath them! Are they trying to put on a show?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ritsuko Akizuki：</span><br>
So what's the plan? I'm also ready to get on deck and perform, but...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Chihaya Kisaragi：</span><br>
It might be hard since we haven't had time to warm up yet...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ritsuko Akizuki：</span><br>
We might not even be able to get on stage if we don't get that ship out of the way first.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Z23：</span><br>
Even if we do that, if that ship calls for additional reinforcements, we won't even be able to return to port.<br>
(In case things get too out of hand, we could return to more conventional combat, but... Haruka and the others are still over there, and we can't risk that... Ugh...)<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">？？？：</span><br>
Muse System Task Force, Ami Futami, reporting for duty!<br>
And make it double! Mami Futami is here to save the day!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Haruka Amami：</span><br>
The twins?!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ami Futami：</span><br>
Nihihi! Behold, the power of the Muse System!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Mami Futami：</span><br>
You just can't beat the real deal! Get a load of this!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Iori Minase：</span><br>
St-stand back, everyone!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Chihaya Kisaragi：</span><br>
Iori, you too? Are you seriously going to fight the enemy?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Iori Minase：</span><br>
Of course! If we don't win, we won't be able to move forwards or backwards, isn't that right?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Baltimore μ：</span><br>
Any of you girls not in possession of the Muse rigging, evacuate according to my instructions! All other ships, support Iori and the others!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Albacore & Ayanami：</span><br>
Got it! Understood, yes!<br>

<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Javelin：</span><br>
I'm on my way back! Is everyone okay?!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Chihaya Kisaragi：</span><br>
Not a scratch on us. Thank you very much.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Haruka Amami：</span><br>
That was quite a shocking experience...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ami Futami：</span><br>
Nihihi! We came in clutch, isn't that right?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Mami Futami：</span><br>
Yeah, that was the perfect time to unveil our brand new Muse System rigging!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ayanami：</span><br>
Bringing new friends in and getting new powers— that's the perfect way to wrap up a training arc after a bitter defeat!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Z23：</span><br>
Jeez, I hope you two realize how much danger you put yourselves in...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Baltimore μ：</span><br>
Actually, there wasn't anything to worry about. I had already been tracking their signals.<br>
If there was any real threat of danger, I was ready to step in.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ami Futami：</span><br>
See, there's no problem! By the way, as you can see, this rigging is a submarine-type! That means...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Mami Futami：</span><br>
We've been trailing the mass-produced ships without you knowing it, Harurun!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ritsuko Akizuki：</span><br>
Wait, so you two can dive now?! The level of technology here is pretty wild...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ayanami：</span><br>
It wasn't developed overnight, but Akashi managed to pull through, yes.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Mami Futami：</span><br>
Plus, don'tcha think this outfit suits us perfectly~♪<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ami Futami：</span><br>
Ritsuko has some big news for us, right~♪<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Azusa Miura：</span><br>
Um... What is this...?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Iori Minase：</span><br>
Ritsuko went to ask that Akashi girl about the rigging that my clone had equipped.<br>
Apparently, "those ships were equipped with rigging very similar to our Muse System."<br>
That gave her the idea to see if we could also equip the Muse System rigging.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ritsuko Akizuki：</span><br>
I was just curious, but I had no idea she'd actually go and make it...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Mami Futami：</span><br>
But it worked out, because now we're totally able to fight!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ami Futami：</span><br>
Yup yup! We can't just be relying on others the whole time we're here!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Azusa Miura：</span><br>
I see, that makes sense~<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Baltimore μ：</span><br>
We're grateful that you have the will to fight alongside us, but remember, don't push yourselves too hard.<br>
To be honest, I was a bit surprised when Ayanami, Ami, and Mami popped up out of nowhere. Let's make sure we support each other properly.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ayanami：</span><br>
My apologies...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Iori Minase：</span><br>
There's nothing to apologize for. It's only natural to want to protect your friends!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Albacore μ：</span><br>
And in case things go south, just remember that I've got your back!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Baltimore μ：</span><br>
All right then, let's finish scouting out the venue before we head back!<br>

<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Chihaya Kisaragi：</span><br>
I, I'm not sure about this...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Laffey & Ayanami：</span><br>
Ooooh...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Javelin：</span><br>
Chihaya, that looks super, duper amazing on you!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Iori Minase：</span><br>
It's terrifying how Akashi can make perfect outfits for everyone without even taking our measurements...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Akashi：</span><br>
It's a part of my job, nya~ But, you're welcome to praise me more, nya~♪<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Azusa Miura：</span><br>
So, my rigging type is that of a heavy cruiser? Haruka is a light cruiser, and Ritsuko is a munitions ship? My, I feel like you've even matched our personalities~<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Iori Minase：</span><br>
Really? I guess I'm a battleship then, and Chihaya is...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Chihaya Kisaragi：</span><br>
An aircraft carrier.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Queen Elizabeth：</span><br>
Are our riggings to your satisfaction, ladies? If so, let's discuss our strategy moving forward.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Haruka Amami：</span><br>
Right, we have to do something about that stage in the Concert Sea Area.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Kaga：</span><br>
Precisely. From the scouting we've done, we can be fairly certain that the anomalous energy signatures are coming from that stage.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Akashi：</span><br>
Based on our prior experiences, there might be a tunnel leading back to your original world, nya.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Haruka Amami：</span><br>
We'll be able to go home then?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ritsuko Akizuki：</span><br>
Plus, with our new equipment, we'll be able to wallop all of those clones blocking our way.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Haruka Amami：</span><br>
Ah, um, I do have a question though...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Queen Elizabeth：</span><br>
Do speak your mind.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Haruka Amami：</span><br>
Last time, our clones performed on a small ship stage, right? But we're going to be on the main stage this time?<br>
I think this is a great opportunity for everyone to come out on stage and deliver a dazzling performance!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Cleveland μ：</span><br>
That sounds fine, but are you absolutely sure?<br>
I know you girls have rigging now, but you don't have to force yourselves to fight...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Azusa Miura：</span><br>
I don't see it as forcing ourselves. Please let us perform as well.<br>
If our songs and dances can make a difference... we want to do everything we can to help!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Mami Futami：</span><br>
Preach it! Besides, there are plenty of dangers out there even when we're not on the stage performing~<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ami Futami：</span><br>
I promise not to play any more submarine tag for the time being~<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Chihaya Kisaragi：</span><br>
I swear I won't do anything to endanger myself either. So please, let us join your performance!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Queen Elizabeth：</span><br>
Very well then! Let us begin our preparations!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Everyone：</span><br>
Hooray!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ritsuko Akizuki：</span><br>
Singing and dancing lessons, rehearsals, syncing our choreography with the shipgirls, and designing the perfect set...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Azusa Miura：</span><br>
We're going to have our hands full, aren't we~?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ritsuko Akizuki：</span><br>
Hehe... Now this gets my blood pumping~♪<br>

Port - Wharf<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ritsuko Akizuki：</span><br>
Oh, please leave that box in the temporary office instead of on the deck. Also, be careful, because it's fragile.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Mami Futami：</span><br>
Roger that!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ami Futami：</span><br>
Yes, ma'am!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Z23：</span><br>
The equipment checklist is looking pretty good... So far, we've been staying right on schedule.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ritsuko Akizuki：</span><br>
It's all thanks to you, Z23! Your diligent planning has been keeping everyone on track!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Z23：</span><br>
No, no... I don't have any experience with management, but the tips you've given me have been a great help.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ami Futami：</span><br>
Woaaaahh! I can't see in front of me!! Help me, Mami... Eek!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ritsuko Akizuki：</span><br>
Ahaha... Looks like we're going to have to help each other out a whole lot.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Akagi：</span><br>
Azusa, do you prefer sweet or spicy?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Azusa Miura：</span><br>
Hmm, let's see... To be honest, I'm not too good with spicy food, but I'm sure there are plenty of people who are fine with it...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Akagi：</span><br>
I wonder which we should go with...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Azusa Miura：</span><br>
By the way, Akagi, do you cook often?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Akagi：</span><br>
Not particularly. However, I must say that it's more enjoyable cooking for others.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Azusa Miura：</span><br>
My, my~ I'm sure you'll make a wonderful bride, Akagi~<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Akagi：</span><br>
Hwuh...?!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Chihaya Kisaragi：</span><br>
Hum hum~♪<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Sheffield：</span><br>
Lady Chihaya, Lady Iori has invited you to a tea party.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Chihaya Kisaragi：</span><br>
A what? Tea party...?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Sheffield：</span><br>
Indeed. Lady Iori is having a tea party with Her Majesty and would like you to join her.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Chihaya Kisaragi：</span><br>
I see. Um, is it really fine for me to show up in an outfit like this?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Sheffield：</span><br>
You needn't worry about that. There is one thing I'd like to apologize for, however.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Chihaya Kisaragi：</span><br>
What's the matter...?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Sheffield：</span><br>
For Lady Chihaya, a tea party is a frivolous matter compared to the importance of your practice.<br>
For this, I apologize for demanding your time.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Chihaya Kisaragi：</span><br>
It's not a big deal, really... If anything, thank you for inviting me. Spending time with friends is just as important to me.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Queen Elizabeth：</span><br>
I must say, I did not expect to find fellow enjoyers of Royal Navy tea from another world.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Iori Minase：</span><br>
Well, I suppose I am a rather well-traveled idol.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Queen Elizabeth：</span><br>
Hehe. If only that lousy servant of mine was as discerning as you~♪<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Iori Minase：</span><br>
Servant?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Queen Elizabeth：</span><br>
Of course. My servant is my servant.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Iori Minase：</span><br>
Uh, I see. F-forget I asked...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Javelin：</span><br>
Harukaaaa! Let's go down to the festival tonight!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Haruka Amami：</span><br>
Huh? Festival?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ayanami：</span><br>
Yup, we hold a festival right here in port about this time every summer. There's gonna be a ton of fun things to do!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Laffey：</span><br>
Laffey... is already in festival mode.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Haruka Amami：</span><br>
Woah... Summer festivals are a thing in this world too? Sounds awesome~♪ Can I let the others know as well so we can all go?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ayanami：</span><br>
Of course! We'd love to have all of you!<br>

This is the moment we've been preparing for... Kaga, how goes the monitoring?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Kaga：</span><br>
The energy signatures are abnormal, but at least stable.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Mami Futami：</span><br>
Mhm, mhm... Yeah, I totally get it! So, uh... we basically just rush right on in and get on-stage!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ami Futami：</span><br>
Blow up any mass-produced ships that get in our way, take out those clones, and then throw the best performance ever on that huge stage!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Mami Futami：</span><br>
After that, we'll use our secret technique to blow open a portal to take us back home!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ami Futami：</span><br>
We're going home as heroes! I can already see our glorious victory~♪<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ritsuko Akizuki：</span><br>
Don't count your chickens before they hatch, Ami. We're not going anywhere if we don't take out that clone in front of us first.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Gascogne μ：</span><br>
Confirming hologram energy mass. Initiating performance preparations.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Albacore μ：</span><br>
We'll take care of the small fry. You girls should save your stamina for the final concert.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Azusa Miura：</span><br>
Thanks for covering us~ Today's going to be a pretty long day, huh?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Taihou μ：</span><br>
Yes, and most importantly, my Commander shall be observing all our performances today. Despite that, we'll get burned out if we go all-out from the beginning.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Iori Minase：</span><br>
Wait, since when?!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Chihaya Kisaragi：</span><br>
(Maybe it's a good source of inspiration for them...)<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Akashi：</span><br>
Taihou, don't tamper with the broadcasting feed without permission, nya! This isn't the Commander's office; you're messing up the connection with the port's repeater, nya!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Chihaya Kisaragi：</span><br>
Sigh...<br>
Haha... Well, it is true that it takes passion to become a true idol.<br>

<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Azusa Miura：</span><br>
It's finally time for us to make our debut!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Baltimore μ：</span><br>
Your clones appear to already be in position. They also seem to have already decided on their program.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ritsuko Akizuki：</span><br>
This feels quite like a boss fight. Can we head up on stage now?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Kaga：</span><br>
Yes, I'm continuing to monitor the energy signatures, but you'll have to defeat those clones first.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Prinz Eugen：</span><br>
If the portal stays open, we'll be able to send you back to your original world.<br>
Don't let your guard down until we can get you through, though. Do your best out there.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Azusa Miura：</span><br>
This whole thing feels so weird... almost like rehearsing in front of a mirror.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Haruka Amami：</span><br>
Because our clones are standing right across from us?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ami Futami：</span><br>
That's not all. They even seem to have our mannerisms!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Mami Futami：</span><br>
But you can tell that they're not real...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Iori Minase：</span><br>
Don't think too much about it, or you won't be able to stay focused. Direct all your focus on the performance.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Azusa Miura：</span><br>
What Iori says is right. We are who we are—<br>
<br>
……！！！<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Akashi：</span><br>
The energy signature is spiking, nya!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Admiral Hipper μ：</span><br>
I'm getting a bad feeling about this... Hey, Sheffy, do you think this is...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Sheffield μ：</span><br>
Indeed... It reminds me of the day the idols arrived.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ritsuko Akizuki：</span><br>
What do you mean by that? Are we going to have a repeat of the thing that happened when we arrived?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Akagi μ：</span><br>
There's no telling what might happen. Gather Javelin and the other escort ships and have them meet up with us here.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Chihaya Kisaragi：</span><br>
Are you sure? I thought our escorts were drawing the mass-produced ships away...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Albacore μ：</span><br>
Ships that aren't equipped with the Muse System can't provide you with any assistance on-stage.<br>
That's why when it's your time to shine, you've gotta give it your all!<br>

With the power of the Muse System, there's not a soul out there that can put on a better show than Ami!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Mami Futami：</span><br>
Yeah! We're not gonna lose to anyone, let alone some dumb clone~♪<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ritsuko Akizuki：</span><br>
Now, let's light up this world!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Iori Minase：</span><br>
And not just this world, let's illuminate the universe!<br>
<br>
Offstage<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Akashi：</span><br>
Akagi, everyone... Big trouble, nya!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Akagi μ：</span><br>
What... is the meaning of this?!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Akashi：</span><br>
It's bad news, nya! The energy signature is spiking through the roof, nya!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Kaga：</span><br>
Calm down, Akashi. Tell us what exactly is going on, and what we need to do.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Akashi：</span><br>
I'm not so sure myself, nya...<br>
Ever since the concert started, the energy signature has been increasing steadily, nya.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Gascogne μ：</span><br>
Monitor module output: energy reading is coming from atop the stage.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Javelin：</span><br>
Gascogne, you too? ...So, what's going to happen now?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Akashi：</span><br>
If the energy overloads, it's going to spill over to all the machinery set up here, nya...<br>
And if that happens... not just the stage, but the entire port's going to get blown to smithereens, nya!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Admiral Graf Spee：</span><br>
So, that means we need to stop the concert immediately...!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Akashi：</span><br>
At the pace it's increasing, we'd be too late even if we stopped the concert right now, nya!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Gascogne μ：</span><br>
Proposing a manner to reduce the risk of energy overload:<br>
—All ships equipped with the Muse System are to join the concert and counteract the energy overflow by operating the gear at maximum output.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Cleveland μ：</span><br>
In other words... You want to use the energy from the Muse System to block the incoming overflow?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Baltimore μ：</span><br>
A simple and straightforward solution. I'm glad we rehearsed together in case of contingencies.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ayanami：</span><br>
What should we do?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Akagi μ：</span><br>
Follow the original plan. Thanks to you girls, this concert's just about to get a lot more interesting.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Z23：</span><br>
I guess so... See, that just goes to show that hard work is never wasted!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Haruka Amami：</span><br>
So, we're all going to get on stage together for the next part of the concert?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Laffey：</span><br>
Mm... Otherwise, we're all going to go kaboom.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ami Futami：</span><br>
Kaboom? Whaddya mean?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Mami Futami：</span><br>
Isn't that some kind of special effect?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Z23：</span><br>
Actually, not quite... So, um, this is the situation...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Haruka & Chihaya：</span><br>
………………………………<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ritsuko & Azusa：</span><br>
………………………………<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ami & Mami：</span><br>
………………………………<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ayanami：</span><br>
...We did not mean to get you involved in all of this. Um...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Javelin：</span><br>
I'm so sorry... This is all because we decided to bring you here...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Iori Minase：</span><br>
What are you saying? You have nothing to apologize for.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Z23：</span><br>
Miss Iori...?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Iori Minase：</span><br>
We had the Muse rigging made for us, and we didn't end up here by mistake.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Azusa Miura：</span><br>
That's right. We chose to be here.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ritsuko Akizuki：</span><br>
We've already been through so much together, so we might as well see things through, right?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ami Futami：</span><br>
If we succeed, we can save this world from destruction, then truly go back home as heroes! Everyone's happy!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Mami Futami：</span><br>
Yeah, yeah! I'll say it again, we aren't losing to some crappy clones!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Chihaya Kisaragi：</span><br>
If our song will make a difference, we'll sing our hearts out!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Iori Minase：</span><br>
Exactly. Plus, there are people here looking forward to our performance, so I won't let this place be destroyed!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ayanami：</span><br>
Girls...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Haruka Amami：</span><br>
That's why... we're going to put on the best show ever, together!<br>
This is the last performance we're putting on in this world, so shine like you've never shone before!<br>

This is the story of a rainbow-colored ocean in which battles come again and again.<br>
Of a stage that shines brilliantly to protect the world's peace.<br>
Of a resonating passion and an anthem of hope.<br>
This is the story of what it means to be an idol in this world.<br>
The girls continued to sing and sing as the holographic images of their fans from worlds both near and far illuminated the stage.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Cleveland μ：</span><br>
Is everyone getting pumped up——!!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Vampire：</span><br>
You're not alone! We're here too!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Le Malin μ：</span><br>
What an elegant glow... So this is Vampire's... Err, rather, the Azur Lane's brightly-shining idols!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Chihaya Kisaragi：</span><br>
May our songs reach your heart!<br>

Akashi, how's the output from the Muse System looking?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Akashi：</span><br>
It's going up, nya! At this rate, we might actually be able to...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Kaga：</span><br>
No, it's not enough. Look, the energy on the other side is accelerating as well, as if it's matching us...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Akashi：</span><br>
S-seriously, nya?! Are we really going to go kaboom, nya?!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Prinz Eugen：</span><br>
If nothing changes, that actually might happen. Now, how are we going to get out of this mess...<br>

<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Chihaya Kisaragi：</span><br>
It might have just been because our opponents were too strong, but the act of singing itself is not enough to convey the feelings that can move one's heart.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ritsuko Akizuki：</span><br>
Ahaha... Looks like we're going to have to help each other out a whole lot.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Azusa Miura：</span><br>
If our songs and dances can make a difference... we want to do everything we can to help!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Iori Minase：</span><br>
It's only natural to want to protect your friends!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ami Futami：</span><br>
If we succeed, we can save this world from destruction, then truly go back home as heroes! That way, everyone's happy!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Mami Futami：</span><br>
We aren't losing to some crappy clones!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Haruka Amami：</span><br>
I think this is a great opportunity for everyone to come out on stage and deliver a dazzling performance!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Baltimore μ：</span><br>
(This concert is not mine alone. It is all of ours.)<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Haruka Amami：</span><br>
(Not just us, but also the shipgirls performing with us.)<br>
(No, it's not just them. All of the shipgirls here, as well as the fans who are watching. We're all excited about this concert!)<br>
(And, finally, all of my friends "over there" who are still waiting for us...)<br>
<br>
―――ー！！<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Kaga：</span><br>
Unlike last time, there's something different about the stage...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Prinz Eugen：</span><br>
From the looks of things, the nightmare scenario has been averted.<br>
Look, Akashi, the energy readings are changing as well.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Akashi：</span><br>
It's true, nya! The energy signature is starting to turn around, nya! We're pushing it back, nya!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ami Futami：</span><br>
Ami's just getting started, so don't you dare go anywhere!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Mami Futami：</span><br>
Encore, encore! We're not gonna stop!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Iori Minase：</span><br>
Is everyone still hanging in there?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Everyone：</span><br>
You bet!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Iori Minase：</span><br>
All right! Let's give it our all, until the curtains fall!<br>

The Muse System is a weapon that is able to bring out the power within feelings and songs.<br>
A third concert festival was to be held at the port to further tap into its potential.<br>
But before that could happen, the joint performance featuring the idols of 765 Production as well as the shipgirls generated an unbelievable amount of excitement, and was said to have captured the hearts of countless fans across the world.<br>
Afterward...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ritsuko Akizuki：</span><br>
Jeez, are we sure that things are going to be fine this time? My heart's not going to be able to handle a repeat of the last time...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Azusa Miura：</span><br>
My, my~ Since when have you been such a worrywart, Ritsuko~<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Chihaya Kisaragi：</span><br>
I'm still amazed that we managed to cancel out that huge energy surge with our own.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Sheffield：</span><br>
When the energy dissipated, all the mass-produced ships in the area shut down as well.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ami Futami：</span><br>
Wh-what?! Doesn't that mean we can't go home ever again?! Even after all that...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Mami Futami：</span><br>
Actually, it seems that the actual location of the portal was in the office rather than at the concert venue.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Iori Minase：</span><br>
Don't scare me like that, jeez...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Akagi：</span><br>
Next time, do some proper research before sending us on a dangerous wild goose chase...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Akashi：</span><br>
I'm so sorry, nya. This is all Akashi's fault, nya. Please forgive me, nya...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Azusa Miura：</span><br>
Don't worry. All's well that ends well, right~ Besides, if we had to search for the portal ourselves, who knows how long it would've taken?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Akagi：</span><br>
Indeed, you have my word this time. You should be able to return home through here.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Haruka Amami：</span><br>
(After our performance, the energy from the Muse System canceled out the abnormal energy.)<br>
(That apparently sealed off the portal that we arrived in this world through...)<br>
(After all that, I'm not sure why we got pulled into this world in the first place, but I'm glad we get to go home~)<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Z23：</span><br>
We've finished stowing away the Muse riggings.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Javelin：</span><br>
Thanks for everything! It was so nice to meet you all!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Laffey：</span><br>
Laffey... won't ever forget...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ayanami：</span><br>
Let's play games together again some day.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ami Futami：</span><br>
Sure, but I'm not gonna lose when we have our rematch! Right, Mami?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Mami Futami：</span><br>
Jeez, Ami, you're the only one who lost!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Cleveland：</span><br>
Ah, I really can't wait to see you all again!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Admiral Hipper：</span><br>
...What are you looking at me for? Well, I guess I haven't been able to perform like that in a long time. And it was kinda fun, and um...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Gascogne：</span><br>
Portal status is stable. Confirming intent to depart.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Vampire：</span><br>
Regrettably, 'tis time for us to part.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Chihaya Kisaragi：</span><br>
...Thanks again, for everything you've done for us here.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Azusa Miura：</span><br>
Your hospitality truly was spectacular. Our time together was a ton of fun, hehe~<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Mami Futami：</span><br>
Yeah, the concert at the end wasn't the only highlight!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ami Futami：</span><br>
Mhm! Ami also had a ton of fun!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ritsuko Akizuki：</span><br>
The time I spent here was truly unforgettable. Thank you, everyone!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Iori Minase：</span><br>
Try not to get too lonely without me around!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Haruka Amami：</span><br>
Let's hang out again some time in the future!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Staff：</span><br>
All right, now for the next person!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Azusa Miura：</span><br>
Wow, I guess we really are back...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Iori Minase：</span><br>
I feel totally worn out...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ami Futami：</span><br>
Ahhhh, me too! Good night~<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Mami Futami：</span><br>
Seems like we ended up back home in a flash! But... it also feels like we spent a lot of time over there.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ritsuko Akizuki：</span><br>
C'mon, we don't have time to sleep on the job. Let's continue the photoshoot! Haruka, you're next!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Chihaya Kisaragi：</span><br>
Ah, right, now that you reminded me...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Staff：</span><br>
All right, next person, come take your picture—<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Haruka Amami：</span><br>
Hi, pleased to meet you!<br>
<br>
"An invader from afar threatened the peace of the azur lanes."<br>
"Brave warships arose once more from the iron depths to face them."<br>
"This is the song sung by idols, an anthem to support the heroes who protect this world."<br>
This is our path, our song. Our conviction, and our hope—<br>
