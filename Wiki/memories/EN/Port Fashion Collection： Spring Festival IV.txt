<br>
The lounge is especially comforting today, owing to the mixture of the heater's warmth and the gentle aroma of tea.<br>
My eyes wander around the room until they naturally arrive on the sofa.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">{namecode:479}：</span><br>
Mainz, who's usually stiff and formal, is splayed out on said sofa in relaxation. A rare sight, indeed.<br>
Apparently hearing my entry, she raises her head. A soft smile spreads on her face.<br>
Good to see you, Commander. You look tired. Want to come rest with me?<br>
She pats the open spot next to her invitingly.<br>
Come on. Take the opportunity to relax a little.<br>
<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项1：I'd be happy to.</span>'''''<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项2：I was just looking to take a break.</span>'''''<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">{playername}：</span><br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项1）</span>'''''Thanks. I think I'll do just that.<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项1）</span>'''''It's not often that we get to take a break together.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">{playername}：</span><br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项2）</span>'''''Good idea. I was just looking for a place to take a break.<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项2）</span>'''''There are precious few opportunities to relax with you.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">{namecode:479}：</span><br>
When I sit next to her, she sits up and skillfully brews a pot of tea.<br>
As the aroma intensifies, she fills two teacups and offers me one.<br>
Here, Commander. This is one of the Dragon Empery's specialties. I hope you like it.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">{playername}：</span><br>
Thank you.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">{namecode:479}：</span><br>
When I accept it, warmth spreads from the porcelain to my fingers.<br>
But I hardly realize it, because my fingers also brush against Mainz's silky skin.<br>
She looks surprised for a moment, but she calmly takes her hand back as if nothing had happened.<br>
I take a sip. The flavor of smooth, rich tea fills my mouth. Its aftertaste is comforting, as well, bringing a smile to my face.<br>
Before I can sing its praises, I notice a rosy blush adorning Mainz's cheeks.<br>
Um... How do you like it?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">{playername}：</span><br>
I love it. Suits my tastes perfectly.<br>
You always know what I like, Mainz. Whether it's tea or coffee.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">{namecode:479}：</span><br>
She gives a small smile, and her expression softens.<br>
Wrapped in the aroma of tea, we chat about what's happening at the port.<br>
Her dress reflects the light softly. Seeing her in it reminds me of the New Year's party.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">{playername}：</span><br>
That dress fits you well. Did you pick it just for the party?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">{namecode:479}：</span><br>
I-I did... Are you really saying it looks good on me?<br>
I've been wondering, er... how you see me, Commander. But I'm relieved to hear your praise.<br>
She looks down and adjusts the dress a little. Is it just me, or is she in a good mood?<br>
Just then, one of her shoes slips and falls onto the floor.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">{playername}：</span><br>
I'll get that.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">{namecode:479}：</span><br>
I bend down, pick up the pretty high heel, and kneel in front of her.<br>
Huh? W-wait, Commander! I did not mean to have you...!<br>
She frantically waves her hands, and her face turns a deep red.<br>
But she doesn't stop me, perhaps trying not to ruin the mood, or perhaps not wanting to let the moment go. Rather, she lets me lift her foot.<br>
As I do, I feel the silky softness of her stockings.<br>
She trembles a little, but she doesn't break her elegant posture.<br>
Like the glass slippers of fairy tales, the high heel fits perfectly on her foot.<br>
I look up to find Mainz's eyes looking unusually bashful.<br>
Thank you, Commander.<br>
I'm very happy... to be spending such a serene and comfortable time with you.<br>

<br>
When I arrive at the photo shoot, I'm stricken by the beautiful, Dragon Empery-style set.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Jean Bart：</span><br>
Jean Bart leans against a tree with lanterns hanging from it, gazing thoughtfully into the distance while supporting her head with slender fingers.<br>
She must have been waiting for a long time – when she sees me, she perks up a little.<br>
You're here.<br>
She sits up and casually pulls on her clothes a bit to straighten them out.<br>
Well? Am I the apple of your eye?<br>
Just asking out of curiosity.<br>
She adds that second part quickly, as if trying to prove that she doesn't care that much.<br>
<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项1：It suits you well.</span>'''''<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项2：It's very festive.</span>'''''<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">{playername}：</span><br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项1）</span>'''''Yeah, it looks great on you. The tailoring emphasizes your grace.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">{playername}：</span><br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项2）</span>'''''I like it. It suits the festive mood.<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项2）</span>'''''A little different from your usual style, maybe, but that's just another part of the charm.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Jean Bart：</span><br>
My sincere praise makes her loosen up a little, but as usual, she doesn't openly express a hint of joy.<br>
While I do like this holiday spirit, don't expect me to dress up every single year.<br>
Okay, everything's ready. Let's get started.<br>
The shoot begins. Her poses are elegant, but her facial expressions betray her lack of experience.<br>
Several photos later, we've yet to truly draw out her natural charms.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">{playername}：</span><br>
You're still a little tense. Maybe try to relax more.<br>
How about we chat a little to loosen you up?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Jean Bart：</span><br>
Fine. About what, though?<br>
Hmm... Like new year traditions in the Empery?<br>
Gotta admit, I'm a little interested this year. You know anythin' about it?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">{playername}：</span><br>
New year traditions, huh? I'd say the most memorable one has to be the "red envelope."<br>
Basically, everyone gives each other red envelopes to bless each other in the new year.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Jean Bart：</span><br>
Oh, is that how you give blessings to someone? Heheh. Alright, then why don't you show me how sincere you are?<br>
The timing couldn't be more perfect. I reach into my pocket for the red envelope I'd been saving for after the shoot.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">{playername}：</span><br>
I've got what you want right here. All of my sincerity, and more.<br>
I hope next year is safe, happy, and as fulfilling as can be for you. And I hope that we can become closer than ever.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Jean Bart：</span><br>
Heh... That's more like it.<br>
She happily accepts the envelope and deposits it gingerly into her clothes.<br>
As we keep chatting, she softens up more and more. Her movements become much more natural.<br>
A new year and a new beginning... So they say, but every day's a new start to me.<br>
What makes it different from the past ones is the fact that I have you now here.<br>
She leans back against the tree and looks up at the hanging lanterns.<br>
Then, she gazes tenderly at me.<br>
Don't get me wrong. It's not like I'm relying on you...<br>
Her tone becomes even softer, and she starts to sound more like she's talking to herself than to me.<br>
Warm lantern light shines upon her delicate countenance...<br>
Either way... Happy New Year, Commander.<br>
I seize the moment and click the shutter.<br>
This photo is sure to be the one that both of us love the most.<br>
Bathed in the light of lanterns and the starry sky, Jean Bart's smile is more enchanting than ever. Her beauty eclipses even the stars above.<br>
Happy New Year to you, too, Jean Bart.<br>

<br>
As I enter the room, a sweet scent tickles my nose. The space is meticulously decorated, with intricate details everywhere.<br>
While I quietly take in the elegant scenery, a gentle melody begins to play.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">New Jersey：</span><br>
In the direction of the sound, I find New Jersey dancing in a gorgeous Empery-style dress.<br>
The exquisitely embroidered dress sways gracefully as she moves, while the ribbon at her waist twirls as if it has a life of its own.<br>
Her graceful movements come to a perfect stop just as the last note fades, and she approaches me.<br>
Phew... It was really hard to complete the ending, but I can handle anything!<br>
So, honey, did you like it? Hellooo, honey? Aww, are you so mesmerized that you can't speak? Hahaha!<br>
<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项1：You were just so beautiful.</span>'''''<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项2：Did you do all this?</span>'''''<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">{playername}：</span><br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项1）</span>'''''You were just so beautiful. I couldn't take my eyes off you.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">New Jersey：</span><br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项1）</span>'''''Heheh! When I saw you stunned and gawking, I just knew this surprise was a success.<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项1）</span>'''''Anyway, you're right on time. Welcome, honey!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">{playername}：</span><br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项2）</span>'''''Wait... Did you prepare all of this for me? The set, the outfit, and all?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">New Jersey：</span><br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项2）</span>'''''Of course I did! This is easy stuff for the indomitable Black Dragon of the Eagle Union!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">New Jersey：</span><br>
Ting An deserves some of the credit for getting me the tools, though.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">{playername}：</span><br>
I can tell a lot of thought went into this. It must have taken a long time to get everything ready!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">New Jersey：</span><br>
Hmm... I mean, I guess it did. But what matters to me is that you like it!<br>
She takes my hands and looks at me expectantly.<br>
Come on! Don't just stand there. Dance with me!<br>
I'll teach you, so don't worry if you've never done it before. Now, give me your hand and try spinning with me! Hahaha!<br>
New Jersey's palm is warm and soft, and the sweet scent emanating from her puts me at ease.<br>
I'm clumsy at first, but her patient guidance helps me find the rhythm. Eventually, we're able to dance in perfect sync.<br>
As we're really getting into the groove, though, her hair ornament gets tangled with her ribbon.<br>
Ack... How did these two get tangled together? Honey, help me untangle them!<br>
When I approach to help, she suddenly lunges at my chest and pulls me into a tight embrace.<br>
Heheh... It's cold at night, y'know? Come here, honey. Huuug!<br>
Did that make your heart skip a beat? You must really love this outfit!<br>
Okay, pick. Which do you like more – the usual me, or me in this dress?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">{playername}：</span><br>
Uhh...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">New Jersey：</span><br>
Geez, don't hesitate now. You're supposed to say you love both, silly!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">{playername}：</span><br>
Yeah, you're right. I love both.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">New Jersey：</span><br>
Heehee! You're the best, honey! By the way, there's this thing they say in the Dragon Empery... Umm, something about the moon waxing and waning and driving people apart...<br>
Anyway, the moon here never wanes! And that means I'll always get to be with you.<br>
She pledges eternal love in a soft tone.<br>
Silver moonlight showers upon us.<br>
New Jersey snuggles into my arms like a needy kitten.<br>
Part of me wishes that this moment could last forever.<br>

{{折叠面板|标题=Chamber of Fragrance|选项=4|主框=1|样式=primary|展开=是}}
<br>
The instant I open the door, a soothing aroma dispels all of my fatigue from days of work.<br>
The warm illumination and refined furnishings are perfectly arranged to create a peaceful atmosphere.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Murmansk：</span><br>
In the midst of it all is Murmansk, wearing an elegant Empery-style dress that highlights her proportions.<br>
Comrade Commander, welcome. Take a deep breath in... Can you smell it?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">{playername}：</span><br>
*inhaaale*...<br>
Smells good. It's very comforting...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Murmansk：</span><br>
The antique incense burner on the table lets out a steady trickle of smoke. Its subdued, yet comforting fragrance naturally relaxes me.<br>
It has aroma-therapeutic effects, so it's perfect for a hard worker like you.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">{playername}：</span><br>
Thanks for thinking about me, Murmansk.<br>
You look gorgeous in that dress.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Murmansk：</span><br>
Hearing my compliment, she playfully spins around as if showing off how beautifully her new dress fits.<br>
Why, thank you. Heehee, I noticed you staring. Do you like it that much?<br>
I think this hair ornament is a perfect match, too... Oh?<br>
I wonder. Should I drape this tail over my shoulders, or should I keep it fixed at my back? Which suits the outfit better?<br>
<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项1：Try on your shoulders.</span>'''''<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项2：Behind you sounds good.</span>'''''<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">{playername}：</span><br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项1）</span>'''''I say try draping it over your shoulders. It fits your lighthearted personality.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Murmansk：</span><br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项1）</span>'''''Okay~<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项1）</span>'''''As directed, she gently places her fluffy tail onto her shoulders and tilts her head to look at me.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">{playername}：</span><br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项2）</span>'''''Keep it behind your back, maybe? That way, the beautiful design of your dress stands out more. It's neater and lighter too, don't you think?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Murmansk：</span><br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项2）</span>'''''Yeah, yeah~ You're totally right.<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项2）</span>'''''As directed, she uses an accessory to secure her tail behind her, then turns around to show me.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Murmansk：</span><br>
After much experimentation, she's still unsure about what to do with her tail. But I can't help but notice that she's having fun trying different things with me.<br>
"One, two, three, four, five, foxes love potatoes..." That's an old Dragon Empery nursery rhyme, you know!<br>
While she sings to herself, she suddenly tilts her head in confusion.<br>
Hmm? Isn't it? Maybe I'm remembering it wrong.<br>
The song, perhaps something she'd heard once upon a time, sounds oddly exotic when it comes from her mouth.<br>
Meanwhile, the scent of incense intensifies. I start to feel a bit sleepy.<br>
Murmansk yawns and leans drowsily against the table.<br>
*yaaawn*... That smells so good... I'm getting sleepy. Come to think of it, one of the Empery girls mentioned that this incense has a soporific effect...<br>
Her tail slips off her shoulders and falls to the floor. I step forward to help pick it up–<br>
Huh? My tail is on the floor? It's okay, I can just clean it later~<br>
More importantly, Comrade Commander, is there anything you wanna do with me?<br>
There's a playful glint in her eye.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">{playername}：</span><br>
Umm, such as...?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Murmansk：</span><br>
Well, you know... Comrade Commander... Wanna sleep together for a while?<br>
The incense must be getting to me, because I promptly agree.<br>
She smiles happily and walks over to me, wrapping her arm around mine.<br>
It's just the two of us... Peace and quiet.<br>
Her voice carries a tone of excitement, as if she's anticipating something.<br>
