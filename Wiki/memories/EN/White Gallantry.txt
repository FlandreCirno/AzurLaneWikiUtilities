1 The Earliest Bird<br>
Port - Just outside the office<br>
I was just about to enter my office and resume another day of fleet management. Right as I put my hand on the doorknob, though, I sensed something was off.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">？？？：</span><br>
At last. Come on in.<br>
<br>
Then I realized what it was. Someone had entered my office before me.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">？？？：</span><br>
Well? Are you not coming in?<br>
Then how about a bet? I think you're feeling too startled to enter the office.<br>
And the reason? You forgot to lock the door last night. Am I right, or am I wrong?<br>
<br>
She was right. I gasped in surprise. How did she know?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">？？？：</span><br>
Now, I know what you're thinking. You're wondering how I deduced that when you were working late all by yourself.<br>
<br>
I couldn't just keep standing there, hesitant to enter my own office. It would be humiliating.<br>
Besides, I was less worried about who's waiting for me inside than about the weird looks the ships in the hallway were giving me.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">？？？：</span><br>
The answer is blatantly obvious. So obvious that it's pointless to bet about.<br>
<br>
I opened the door.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Sovetskaya Belorussiya：</span><br>
The reason I came early, of course, was to get everything in order to assume my role as your secretary.<br>
<br>
There in my chair sat Sovetskaya Belorussiya, claiming the throne as if she owned the place.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Sovetskaya Belorussiya：</span><br>
Exercise plans, commission forms, and feedback from members of the fleet... Today's agenda looks to be jam-packed indeed.<br>
<br>
The girl, clad in the Northern Parliament's signature white uniform, stood up. She softly thumped the stack of paperwork on the desk.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Sovetskaya Belorussiya：</span><br>
At ease, Comrade. I'm as capable a secretary as they come. You're free to work me as you see fit.<br>
<br>
She had already finished the morning's preliminary work, which I was grateful for. She walked over to me and whispered into my ear.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Sovetskaya Belorussiya：</span><br>
Next time, remember to lock the door.<br>

2 Eyes on the Prize<br>
Port - A later date<br>
Belorussiya and I were out on an inspection around the port.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Gromky：</span><br>
Dang it, that's the 30th bust in a row! I can't believe my luck!<br>
Gremyashchy, do you have any money left? If I could just buy the last ticket, we'd be guaranteed first prize!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Gremyashchy：</span><br>
Nope, I'm all out. Talk about bad luck, burning through 30 tickets then not having enough for the last one.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Akashi：</span><br>
That's RNG for you, nya! You win some, you lose some, nya!<br>
<br>
We came across Akashi, who had set up a lottery and was selling tickets.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Sovetskaya Belorussiya：</span><br>
Want to try your luck, Comrade?<br>
<br>
There was but one lottery ticket left. We're guaranteed the first prize if we buy it, I reasoned.<br>
I felt that would be mean to Gromky and Gremyashchy, though. After all, they'd spent all their money trying to get it.<br>
When I pointed this out to Belorussiya, she took on an astonished look. The next moment, her expression returned to its default nonchalant state.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Sovetskaya Belorussiya：</span><br>
If you won't do it, then I will do it for you. I will share the prize with our comrades, so you need not feel guilt.<br>
No objections? Good. Then stay here. I'll be right back.<br>
<br>
I decided to let Belorussiya go ahead with her plan.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Sovetskaya Belorussiya：</span><br>
I'm back. With first prize, of course.<br>
<br>
Belorussiya returned, holding a small envelope in her hand.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Gromky：</span><br>
Are you sure you wanna give it to us, Comrade Commander? It's not like Belorussiya cheated or stole it from us!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Gremyashchy：</span><br>
You don't exactly owe it to us... Mm, that's all.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Sovetskaya Belorussiya：</span><br>
We don't, but we insist even so. I wouldn't have known that was the last ticket if you hadn't said it. Take it, and share it with all our comrades.<br>
<br>
The ticket didn't cost much anyway, so I was fine with giving the prize away.<br>
Come to think of it, they didn't even say what the prize was...<br>

3 Luck of the Draw<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Sovetskaya Belorussiya：</span><br>
Za zdorov'ye! To the revolution!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Everyone Else：</span><br>
To the revolution!<br>
<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项1：To the revolution!</span>'''''<br>
<br>
After the workday was over, I attended a welcoming party for the new Northern Parliament girls.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Sovetskaya Belorussiya：</span><br>
I thank you for your kindness, Comrade.<br>
Granted, it is I who came up with this idea, but I was worried for a moment that you wouldn't approve of it.<br>
Rather than profit from the prize, it instead incurred us further expenses. I feared you'd want to cut your losses.<br>
<br>
Belorussiya went on to explain to me that the lottery prize was in fact a discount voucher for an all-inclusive party bundle.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Sovetskaya Belorussiya：</span><br>
As Gromky was left without a coin to her name, she obviously couldn't use the voucher herself. Thus, a bit of additional funding was needed.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Gremyashchy：</span><br>
We kind of didn't stop to check what the prize was. Mm, that's all.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Sovetskaya Belorussiya：</span><br>
You really bought thirty tickets, unaware of what you were hoping to win?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Gromky：</span><br>
S-seeing the "almost sold out" on the store display gave us tunnel vision...<br>
<br>
In the end, I was left feeling like we did a good deed today.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Sovetskaya Belorussiya：</span><br>
Now that we're alone, it's time I offer you an apology, Comrade. I did, in essence, coerce you into funding this lavish party.<br>
I blame it on my being insistent on having things my way. It's a bad habit of mine.<br>
I can be a wildcard, I will admit that. It does inconvenience people at times, too...<br>
<br>
That rang true. I looked back to the day that I appointed her as my secretary. It was astonishing, to say the least.<br>
Nevertheless, I figured there was no need to limit her authority as long as she uses it for good things, like on this day.<br>
Her forwardness just required a bit of adjusting to. To that end, I had to get to know her better.<br>

4 Belorussiya, As a Person<br>
While we still had all the Northern Parliament girls gathered in one place, I decided to chat them up. At the same time, I asked what they think about Belorussiya.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Gangut：</span><br>
Belorussiya? She takes good care of people, despite what her attitude might have you think. She's a hell of a drinking partner to boot!<br>
In fact, she might've thrown this party today because I told her I wanted to get together with everyone and have a drink!<br>
That "everyone" includes you, Comrade! I won't take no for an answer! Hahaha!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Murmansk：</span><br>
Belorussiya is a very good person~<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Tallinn：</span><br>
You say that about everyone. Is there even such a thing as a "bad person" to you?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Murmansk：</span><br>
Hmm... Now that you mention it, nope~<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Tallinn：</span><br>
Surprise... Look, the commander isn't simply asking if she's good or bad, it's about the details. What's she like? How do you approach her? What sets her apart from others in battle?<br>
Also, the commander wants to hear it from us. Not from Belorussiya.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Murmansk：</span><br>
Because it's too embarrassing to ask her directly?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Tallinn：</span><br>
No. That girl is on another level. If you asked her about herself, she'd probably play mindgames with you rather than tell the truth.<br>
<br>
"That's what I thought, too. It's why I'm asking you all instead."<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Tallinn：</span><br>
All right, I'll give you my take on her. But I expect you to stick around and share a drink with me.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Murmansk：</span><br>
I'll go and get you some beers~<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Sovetskaya Rossiya：</span><br>
What's the matter, Comrade Commander? You look a tad ill to me.<br>
...Asking around about Belorussiya? Ah, I see. So you both had the same idea.<br>
<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项1："What do you mean?"</span>'''''<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Sovetskaya Rossiya：</span><br>
I am saying that Belorussiya has been asking around about you.<br>
That girl has a strong and accurate intuition, but she is not one to pass on gathering concrete information to supplement it.<br>
You know of her habit of making bets, yes? You'd be wise never to accept one.<br>
<br>
"She's brought bets up a few times before, yeah. Why shouldn't I accept them?"<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Sovetskaya Rossiya：</span><br>
Because she only makes bets she is absolutely certain she will win.<br>
Oh, sorry, it just came to me that your glass is empty. We can't have that now, can we?<br>
<br>
My glass was, indeed, empty. Rossiya produced a bottle of vodka and poured me a drink.<br>

5 Drunken Stupor<br>
The Northern Parliament girls had me beat.<br>
I'd drank so much that I was feeling dizzy and disoriented. This was not at all how I wanted the day to end.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Sovetskaya Belorussiya：</span><br>
Are we there yet, Comrade? We've been walking for aaaages.<br>
Geeeeesh, they just wouldn't let you off the hook back there, huh? Good thing I was there or you'd been stuck partying 'till morninnnng!<br>
<br>
Belorussiya cried out from behind me. The normally gallant girl was drunk out of her mind, and her speech very much reflected that.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Sovetskaya Belorussiya：</span><br>
You'd be passed out on the floorrrrr by now if I hadn't come to your rescue!<br>
It's good to talk to people, but y– *hic*! You should be more selective, that's all.<br>
But then again, you're a kind and caring person, it's no wonder you shared drinks with everyone. I made a bet with Rossiya that this would happen, and clearly, I was right!<br>
<br>
After asking around, I'd developed a fairly good idea of Belorussiya's character. It came at the cost of having to drink with everyone I talked to, though.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Sovetskaya Belorussiya：</span><br>
We're back, Comrade? Good, then I'll just... Zzzzz...<br>
<br>
I took a seat, as did Belorussiya. Just like that, she collapsed onto me and dozed off.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Chapayev：</span><br>
Oh dear me. It seems you both bit off a little more than you can chew.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Kirov：</span><br>
Indeed. You've clearly had enough drinks for one day. With that, I think it's time for the party to adjourn.<br>
<br>
The other girls started throwing me looks of concern.<br>
I'd hate to think that I forced them to call it for the night sooner than they would've liked...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Sovetskaya Belorussiya：</span><br>
Sorry to ask for a favor, Comrade, but... *hic*... help me back to the dorm...<br>
<br>
She helped me just earlier, and now it was my time to help her.<br>
Carrying her on my back, I took her to right outside her room.<br>
The problem was, since all the Northern Parliament girls were attending the party, there was nobody else in the dormitory.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Sovetskaya Belorussiya：</span><br>
What's the holdup, Comrade? I'm too drunk to walk by myself...<br>
The door's unlocked, so just... open it. I want to get to bed...<br>
<br>
Dropping her off just outside her room would not be decent of me. I had to carry her inside.<br>
I mustered all my courage, turned the door handle, and stepped inside.<br>
Putting Belorussiya to bed relieved all the tension in me, both physically and mentally. Out of energy, I blacked out on the spot...<br>

6 A Refreshing Morning<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">？？？：</span><br>
A rigging power system that uses Wisdom Cubes as an energy source... Now this is fascinating.<br>
I should discuss it with the commander, then posit the idea to the R&D department. But first...<br>
How are you doing? Are you awake yet?<br>
<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项1："Where am I...?"</span>'''''<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Sovetskaya Belorussiya：</span><br>
Good morning, Comrade. Should I get you a remedy for your hangover?<br>
Or would you rather have breakfast? At this hour, you could enjoy a quiet meal in the dormitory salon and nobody would notice.<br>
<br>
Belorussiya put down a heavy book she was reading and greeted me good morning in her regular gallant fashion.<br>
From the look of things, I'd had far too much to drink and passed out on the couch in her room.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Sovetskaya Belorussiya：</span><br>
I really must apologize. My intention was to exhaust the party's liquor reserves so you wouldn't need to get drunk. And I tried, but as you saw, things didn't pan out that way.<br>
Ironically, my plan only resulted in us both collapsing. That's only a passing grade at absolute best.<br>
<br>
I would've had to keep drinking if she hadn't pulled me out of there, which would've impacted my work the following day. Her plan was by no means a failure.<br>
What's more, I had a great night with good company thanks to her. If anything, I owe her my gratitude.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Sovetskaya Belorussiya：</span><br>
It's five in the morning. The destroyers are still asleep, and I think you can imagine where everyone else is. You can avoid being seen if you're quick.<br>
How about a bet? I think you'd rather return to your private quarters than head straight to the office with me.<br>
<br>
......<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Sovetskaya Belorussiya：</span><br>
Hahahah! I win once again.<br>
Rest assured, I'll help you get there unnoticed. After all, I had you carry me all the way here, so I do owe you one.<br>
I'll set off smoke grenades in 15 minutes to cover your escape. Nobody should see you, assuming you run straight for your room.<br>
<br>
I found myself in a somewhat precarious situation. My only real choice was to go along with her plan.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Sovetskaya Belorussiya：</span><br>
Splendid, then that's what we'll do. I'll have the preparations done in no time.<br>
<br>
She got out of bed, stood up, and offered me a hand.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Sovetskaya Belorussiya：</span><br>
I've finally understood why you're adored by so many, Comrade. Hehe.<br>

7 Back in Office<br>
Port - Just outside the office<br>
I was just about to enter my office and resume another day of fleet management. Right as I put my hand on the doorknob, though, I sensed something was off.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">？？？：</span><br>
Well? Are you not going to enter?<br>
<br>
I know who's behind that door. It's a very certain Northern Parliament battleship who, despite her domineering character, I knew I could trust.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">？？？：</span><br>
Then how about a bet? I think I know the exact reason why you don't want to come in.<br>
<br>
I could've sworn I locked the door the night before...<br>
Though I hesitated for a moment, I entered the office. Inside, I found Belorussiya, sat at my desk and looking ardently through some documents.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Sovetskaya Belorussiya：</span><br>
Hahaha! You've realized you can't win my bets, have you?<br>
On a more serious note, I've drafted a proposal for the R&D department and compiled the paperwork for the next merchant vessel convoy mission. Likewise for your business outing schedule.<br>
I might add that today's weather is perfect for battle. Just give the order and I will sortie at a moment's notice.<br>
Of course, I still left some work for you to do. You are the commander, after all.<br>
<br>
She led me by the hand, taking me to my same old chair located behind the desk. I sat down.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Sovetskaya Belorussiya：</span><br>
Your office key slipped out of your pocket when you blacked out in my room. I left it in the drawer to your right.<br>
...What's wrong? You have nothing to worry about.<br>
This chair behind this desk belongs to my beloved guiding light. It belongs to you.<br>
I'm only your secretary. My job is to serve you...<br>
<br>
I felt something soft press against the back of my head.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Sovetskaya Belorussiya：</span><br>
...Using my methods, of course.<br>
