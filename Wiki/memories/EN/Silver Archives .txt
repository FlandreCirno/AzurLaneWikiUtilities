Um, today is May 27th.<br>
The location the Sakura Empire fleet was discovered at... should be here...<br>
Oh, right! That's where it was!<br>
Hmm... Even though I was the one who wrote the report, I had to destroy the original after giving it to the Naval HQ...<br>
That sure throws a wrench in things, doesn't it?<br>
But, thank your lucky stars that Sister Sara is so resourceful... I doubt any other girl would be able to salvage the documents.<br>
Now, if you want to know about the "Black Dragon," I'm sure you'll find that out on your own sooner or later.<br>
By the way, don't put Sister Sara's minor grumbling on the records, pretty please?<br>

–––Action Report Records:<br>
"Sirens are appearing one after another in the waters near a remote island base in the NW Sector."<br>
"Furthermore, the Sirens conducted a number of attacks of secured sectors."<br>
"While each attack consisted only of a few ships, we believe that this is a precursor to a large-scale Siren offensive."<br>
Yeah, yeah. I know, I'm taking this seriously, okay?<br>
The reason we moved our reserves up here was in anticipation of this offensive.<br>
I had no idea we were in the middle of a Reenactment back then, and Commander wasn't around either.<br>
Huh? We were all panicking at the time?<br>
C'mon, TB, just play back the next thing already.<br>

"–––Action Report Records"<br>
"Aircraft carrier Yorktown was heavily injured during the Siren offensive, but thanks to everyone's efforts, the Sirens were pushed back successfully."<br>
"Damage Report Status ––– CV-5 Yorktown ––– Heavy Damage"<br>
"Though her condition is stable, her rigging was heavily damaged, necessitating her to be transferred from the front lines for long-term medical care."<br>
"–––In addition, the phenomenon of 'Microlayer' particulate matter adhesion to her rigging was confirmed."<br>
……………………<br>
Anyway, what's important is that we all made it back in one piece.<br>
At least we retrieved Yorktown safely, though I have no idea what this "Microlayer" thing is...<br>
After all, I was so focused on trying to stop the Sirens that I couldn't worry about other things.<br>
TB, sweetie, can you give me the details on what's going on with the Sakura Empire?<br>

"The fleet responsible for chasing down the Siren stragglers detected signals from a Sakura Empire ship to the west."<br>
"The aforementioned ship rushed to the source of the signal to investigate."<br>
That aforementioned ship is yours truly, Sister Sara!<br>
"Carrier-based reconnaissance revealed a large amount of Siren wreckage in the western sector."<br>
"This suggested that a battle had broken out between the Sirens and another large fleet."<br>
"Because the Eagle Union had only deployed ships to the eastern sectors, we can conclude that the combatants were–––"<br>
"The Sakura Fleet."<br>
I remember seeing Akagi, Kaga, Souryuu, and... yeah, even Hiryuu. Everyone looked like they had been through hell.<br>
Even if I wanted to help, I was simply too far away... Besides, given how tricky things are with the Crimson Axis...<br>
"In addition to the Sakura Empire fleet, another Siren command unit was observed nearby."<br>
"The humanoid command unit was not observed attacking the Sakura Empire fleet."<br>
"Finally, considering the damage inflicted upon the Sakura Empire fleet, we can conclude that the command unit did not need to participate in combat to achieve its desired results."<br>
That's why I tried to send a fleet after it as quickly as possible!<br>
I even had my planes fly up higher to get a better grasp of the whole situation.<br>
But in the end, I couldn't figure out what the Siren was up to...<br>
"Regarding the special phenomenon..."<br>
"A shockwave with an observable reddish-black 'color' appeared around CV Akagi."<br>
"In addition to repelling the humanoid Siren, almost all mass-produced ships in range of the shockwave were destroyed."<br>
"However, the other ships of the Sakura Empire were not visibly affected by the effects of this shockwave."<br>
"Based upon the extent of the damage inflicted to these carriers, this attack was unlikely to have been carried out using any weapons we currently know of."<br>
I seem to remember... seeing someone else there for a brief moment as well...<br>
But who was it...?<br>
I could've sworn I've seen her at some point...<br>
But when...?<br>
Who was it...?<br>
