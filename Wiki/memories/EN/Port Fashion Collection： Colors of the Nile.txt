<br>
As I walk through a maze-like series of corridors, a sudden burst of light appears. Looks like I've set foot in a certainly unusual place.<br>
A faint aroma wafts through the air, and suddenly, someone calls out to me.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">？？？：</span><br>
Hehehe... Looks like a rat has gotten itself lost in the holy domain!<br>
I am the guardian of this domain, and as an uninvited guest, you must face punishment!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Raffaello：</span><br>
I look to where the voice is coming from and spot Raffaello, donning a fabulous outfit and staring at me like some sort of art critic.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">{playername}：</span><br>
Uninvited guest? Who? Me?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Raffaello：</span><br>
She acknowledges my evident confusion and promptly explains things.<br>
Yes, you! Did you forget you're in an immersive experience? Stop fooling around and get into character!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">{playername}：</span><br>
(Right... Someone said something like that when I entered this Nile Cultural Exhibition.)<br>
(Didn't expect that I'd be asked to roleplay, though...)<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Raffaello：</span><br>
Hm? Hello?<br>
Abhorrent intruder, how dare you space out before the guardian!<br>
For this, your punishment shall be... being turned into stone!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">{playername}：</span><br>
(We're really doing this? Okay, I'll just play along for now.)<br>
<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项1：(Beg for forgiveness.)</span>'''''<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">{playername}：</span><br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项1）</span>'''''O Great Protector, I am but a tourist who haplessly wandered into your domain!<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项1）</span>'''''Please have mercy! This was an accident!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Raffaello：</span><br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项1）</span>'''''Heheh. Your change in attitude might warrant a little mercy.<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项1）</span>'''''But I have to teach you a lesson, so I'll only let you go on one condition!<br>
<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项1：(Point out the flaw in the exhibition's tour route.)</span>'''''<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">{playername}：</span><br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项2）</span>'''''You know, I was just following the path and wound up here.<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项2）</span>'''''I think the fault isn't with me, but with how the tour route is laid out.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Raffaello：</span><br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项2）</span>'''''Uhh... Umm...<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项2）</span>'''''Fine, I'll let you off the hook, but only on one condition!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">{playername}：</span><br>
What condition?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Raffaello：</span><br>
It's simple! You just need to drink all of this Eternal Beverage!<br>
As she says this, she produces an exquisite pot.<br>
The pot has a dull gold pattern engraved on it, and the liquid inside gives off a faint light.<br>
Go on! Drink up!<br>
She pulls a cup out of nowhere and pours the liquid into it.<br>
I drink the contents of one cup, and another, and another... No matter how much I drink, the pot gets no emptier.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">{playername}：</span><br>
Hey... What's going on here?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Raffaello：</span><br>
Heehee... Finally figured it out, huh?<br>
She stretches her body with an elegant motion and flashes a mischievous smile. My confusion is but a joke to her.<br>
This pot has received a god's blessing. The blessing in question? A bottomless source!<br>
What will you do now, intruder? Give up while you're still ahead?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">{playername}：</span><br>
...I see now. Unluckily for you, I don't give up easily.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Raffaello：</span><br>
In opposition to this malicious god, I stubbornly drink several more cups of the liquid.<br>
My struggle, however, is futile. The pot is still just as full as when I started.<br>
Heheh... You've gotta be the best material I've ever seen. I'm not letting you leave just like that!<br>
Don't worry, though – I won't turn you into stone or anything.<br>
For you see, I am the Protector of Love and Beauty. Hurting a perfect work of art like you goes against everything I stand for!<br>
So I'll be keeping you here. Forever.<br>
She lowers her voice and draws closer, a smugly triumphant smile on her lips.<br>
Because you're worth capturing in detail. Every little part of you. For eternity♪<br>

<br>
A tempting, fruity sweetness fills the air, the aroma coming from further down the corridor.<br>
Following the scent, I end up in front of a door. Opening it, I am met with an unforeseen sight.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Maggiore Baracca：</span><br>
Maggiore Baracca is lazily lying on a bed, gently kicking her feet back and forth while toying with the juicy peach in her hand. She seems bored.<br>
Oh... It's you, Commander.<br>
Did you grow tired of the exhibits, so you came to see me?<br>
She twists her body, wearing an ambiguous smile.<br>
There is a completely different aura about her with her exotic, Nile-style attire. I can't take my eyes off her.<br>
The words are stuck in my throat. Seeing this, a devilish glint reflects in her eyes.<br>
What's the matter? Cat got your tongue?<br>
<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项1：I was drawn here by the aroma...</span>'''''<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">{playername}：</span><br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项1）</span>'''''I was on the tour path when I smelled something in the air.<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项1）</span>'''''I followed the scent, and here I am.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Maggiore Baracca：</span><br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项1）</span>'''''Heheh. I see.<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项1）</span>'''''She brings the peach up to her lips and gives it a little kiss, leaving a faint mark.<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项1）</span>'''''That scent you smelled was probably a mix of fruit and spices.<br>
<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项1：I'm a bit lost at the moment...</span>'''''<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">{playername}：</span><br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项2）</span>'''''This place is massive, and I lost track of where I was.<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项2）</span>'''''That being said, I'm guessing this place is a part of the exhibit as well – right?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Maggiore Baracca：</span><br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项2）</span>'''''Correct.<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项2）</span>'''''And you got here sooner than you should have... I suppose the invisible thread that connects us guided you here♪<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项2）</span>'''''She punctuates her statement by giving the peach a little kiss.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Maggiore Baracca：</span><br>
Well, since you're already here...<br>
Why don't you come and taste these exquisite offerings?<br>
She shakes the peach in her hand. It glimmers with a succulent sheen in the sunlight.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">{playername}：</span><br>
Offerings? You mean the fruit?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Maggiore Baracca：</span><br>
Of course. This time, they gave me the role of a god leisurely enjoying the offerings to her.<br>
Ah, speaking of my role... Don't you know you've entered forbidden territory? I have to give you a punishmeeent♪<br>
She extends the last vowel and kicks her feet back and forth again, like she's plotting something nefarious.<br>
Although, randomly dishing out punishment is so 2,000 years ago...<br>
How about a guessing game instead? We'll each take turns answering the other's question.<br>
Drawing a line across the peach's surface with her delicate finger, she shoots me a flirtatious look.<br>
Whoever guesses wrong...<br>
After a brief pause, her eyes fill with anticipation.<br>
Will have to accept the other's punishment without question♥<br>
The scent in the air grows even richer, adding a hint of seduction to the atmosphere.<br>
<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项1：(Take her on.)</span>'''''<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项2：(Turn her down.)</span>'''''<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">{playername}：</span><br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项1）</span>'''''Sounds fun... Alright. I'm game.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Maggiore Baracca：</span><br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项1）</span>'''''Ah, a refreshingly swift answer. You know just what I like♪<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">{playername}：</span><br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项2）</span>'''''I don't see any benefit to playing this game. No thanks.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Maggiore Baracca：</span><br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项2）</span>'''''Oh dear, it seems you're under the impression that you have the right to say no.<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项2）</span>'''''If you won't play along, then I won't let you leave.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">{playername}：</span><br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项2）</span>'''''Oh... So that's the condition to let me go. Then fine, seeing as I have no choice.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Maggiore Baracca：</span><br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项2）</span>'''''Heehee. I thought so.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Maggiore Baracca：</span><br>
She stretches her limbs and flaunts a confident look.<br>
Okay. My first question is...<br>
What do I, a god, wish to do with you? Heehee♥<br>

<br>
Lead by the faint sound of running water, I walk through a corridor and find myself in a beautifully decorated "palace" amidst an oasis.<br>
Sunlight shines through swaying silk curtains and illuminates the rim of the bed.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Chi An：</span><br>
Chi An has just woken from a slumber and sits on the bed. She combs through her lustrous hair with her fingers.<br>
Then, she becomes aware of my presence, and a glint of happiness flashes across her eyes.<br>
Ahh... I can't believe it... I just woke up, and I've already met the fated person I saw in my dreams.<br>
Did fate guide you right to me, perchance?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">{playername}：</span><br>
(I guess that's the pretense for this scene.)<br>
Well, I–<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Chi An：</span><br>
Shhh. There's no need for explanations.<br>
Her resonant, alluring voice has a charm to it that's hard to resist.<br>
O traveler who has come to my place, I'm sure you must have many questions.<br>
Why did I call you my "fated person," for instance? And where even are we?<br>
To me, however, all of that is unimportant♪<br>
I have no doubt that you've seen many spectacular things on your journey here.<br>
A wink at me speaks to her usual playfulness.<br>
Each one of her gestures seems to signal one thing to me:<br>
"Although I'm wearing very different clothes to what you're used to, and although I'm fully committed to my role..."<br>
"I am still the Chi An you know and love."<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">{playername}：</span><br>
Yeah, you could say that.<br>
From this place, to the ones before, I've seen quite a few things.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Chi An：</span><br>
She runs her fingers across the curtain beside the bed. The thin cloth dances in the wind.<br>
You must be fatigued after such a long journey.<br>
What you need now is a quiet place... and the warm embrace of someone who'll listen to all your troubles.<br>
The light coming through the curtains forms a circle, lending a gentle radiance to her.<br>
Lifting her arms again, she runs her fingers through her hair. She looks as comfortable as can be.<br>
Even the movement of her chest as she breathes brings me a sense of relief that I cannot describe in words.<br>
Traveler, why don't you stay here for a while?<br>
Her tone carries a hint of salaciousness and pleading. It makes her invitation all the more tempting.<br>
Instinctively, I take a step forward, but then stop myself.<br>
Heehee. Still hesitant, I see.<br>
She tilts her head slightly, and the sunlight softly reflects off her long hair.<br>
Did you know that the stars are breathtakingly beautiful here when the night falls?<br>
And in the day, this place is enveloped in light. It, too, is beautiful...<br>
Then, there's the one who will be present day and night by your side – me.<br>
The God of Destiny has shown me much favor by allowing me to meet you, traveler.<br>
So why, then, do you defy destiny like this? Why not make this brief encounter...<br>
Into an eternal partnership?<br>
Her voice is gentle like a sea breeze, concealing an irresistible charm.<br>
Stay with me at this palace...<br>
And let us weave our own future together♪<br>
Her slender finger graces my jaw, and her warm breath brushes against my cheek.<br>
My answer to her... is stifled by the softness of her lips.<br>

{{折叠面板|标题=A Maid's Judgment|选项=4|主框=1|样式=primary|展开=是}}
<br>
A lone person stands before a massive door within the exhibit.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Scylla：</span><br>
Scythe in hand, hair fluttering in the wind, Scylla exudes an aura of mystical elegance in an exotic outfit.<br>
As soon as she sees me, she slightly raises her head. There is a certain playfulness in her eyes.<br>
Welcome, my Maste–<br>
She suddenly interrupts herself and her lips form a mysterious smile.<br>
Pardon me. You're just a traveler at the moment.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">{playername}：</span><br>
What is this? The... "door of judgment"?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Scylla：</span><br>
Heehee. That it is. How keen of you to notice.<br>
Gently, she caresses her scythe before she continues.<br>
Those who wish to pass through here must accept judgement...<br>
Since it's you, however, I could let you pass without any punishment.<br>
<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项1：(Accept her judgment.)</span>'''''<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">{playername}：</span><br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项1）</span>'''''You know what? I'll take your judgment.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Scylla：</span><br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项1）</span>'''''I see. So you seek out my judgement.<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项1）</span>'''''If so you wish, then who am I to deny you? I'll even judge you as many times as it takes to satisfy you. Heehee.<br>
<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项1：(Ask what's behind the door.)</span>'''''<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">{playername}：</span><br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项2）</span>'''''If I go through the door, what will I find on the other side?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Scylla：</span><br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项2）</span>'''''You wish to know?<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项2）</span>'''''Perhaps what lies beyond is Heaven. Or perhaps it's Hell.<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项2）</span>'''''If you wish to know in advance, I suggest you allow me to judge you. Heehee.<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项2）</span>'''''She shoots me a meaningful glance and spins the scythe in her hand.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">{playername}：</span><br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项2）</span>'''''Alright, then. Let's hear your judgment.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Scylla：</span><br>
Well... I should note that the result of my judgement isn't especially important.<br>
What matters is the soul you're willing to reveal to me...<br>
As she finishes, she shuts her eyes and seems to try to read into my soul, twirling her scythe a few times in the meantime.<br>
There. I have already reached a conclusion.<br>
I'm terribly sorry to say, but based on what I see of your soul, your destination lies in Hell.<br>
Her eyes open again, and she gives me a smile of mischief.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">{playername}：</span><br>
Huh?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Scylla：</span><br>
Heehee. As I thought, you had a rather amusing reaction.<br>
Don't worry. I was simply joking.<br>
Her expression softens again.<br>
While it's true that I am portraying the God of Judgement...<br>
It is also true that no maid has the right to determine her master's destiny.<br>
So, to answer your question of where the door leads...<br>
Please decide that for yourself.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">{playername}：</span><br>
I get to decide?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Scylla：</span><br>
Yes. After all, you are my master, Master.<br>
With a graceful bow, she draws a golden arc in the air with her scythe.<br>
As much as I enjoyed portraying a god...<br>
I'm scarcely suited for the task of judging people.<br>
All of a sudden, her voice becomes gentle.<br>
My days spent by your side, providing you service as your maid, are much more enjoyable.<br>
Taking a step aside, she gestures toward the door as if to say, "If you would, please."<br>
Now, Master, kindly proceed forward.<br>
I shall forever follow you as your humble, loyal maid.<br>
