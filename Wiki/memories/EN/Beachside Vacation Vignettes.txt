The Seafaring Speedster<br>
The deep blue sea and the bright blue sky stretch before me. While I'm admiring the scenery, I hear the rumble of an engine in the distance.<br>
I turn to face it and see an approaching jet ski kicking up white waves.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Hornet II：</span><br>
Howdy, Commander!~<br>
Whatcha doing? Happy to see me win the race... or did you come to catch a ride with me?<br>
Whew... I tell ya, high-speed jet skiing on a summer day is the best thing ever!<br>
<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项1："Why the swimsuit?"</span>'''''<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Hornet II：</span><br>
It's aerodynamic! Lets me go faster, although it does show a ton of skin.<br>
Why do you ask? Is it making your heart go thump-thump?<br>
Haha, you should've just said so from the very beginning! I don't like it when people beat around the bush.<br>
But enough about that. Hop on and I'll give you a taste of what it's like to sail the seas at breakneck speeds!<br>
She throws me a life vest and a helmet. I put them on and take a seat behind her.<br>
You ready to go? Then hang on tight! I'm going pedal to the metal!<br>
Now let's catch some winds and make some waves!~！<br>
The engine revs, followed by the jet ski's nose rising up with great force. We take off with a big wave forming behind us.<br>
Fwa-hah! Nothing beats feeling the wind in your hair and the sea spray kickin' up all around you!<br>
But what did you think, Commander?<br>
<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项1："It was awesome!"</span>'''''<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项2："It was a bit intense for me."</span>'''''<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Hornet II：</span><br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项1）</span>'''''Hell yeah it was! I love the adrenaline rush of going fast!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Hornet II：</span><br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项2）</span>'''''Ahah! C'mon, you've weathered crazier stuff than that. Like literal storms, just as one example!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Hornet II：</span><br>
Oh, right, we should start heading back. Here we go – full throttle once more!<br>
……<br>
The heck? The engine's not starting!<br>
Don't tell me I went TOO fast and broke it...<br>
<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项1："Oh boy..."</span>'''''<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Hornet II：</span><br>
Uh, yeah... Sorry about that. We'll just have to wait for someone to come and help us.<br>
Until then, might as well let the waves carry us and enjoy the scenery.<br>
If the sea won't let us go, we'll just make this part two of our little date♪~<br>

<br>
Aquatic Retreat<br>
Light glimmers off the indoor swimming pool. Ripples form on the surface, followed by the resurfacing of a familiar figure.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Northampton II：</span><br>
Ahh... What a great day to stretch your body and swim.<br>
Oh, didn't see you there, Commander. Predicted this is exactly where I'd be, did you?<br>
I'm surprised you found the time of day to come, knowing how incredibly busy you are.<br>
<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项1："What are you up to? Practicing your breaststroke?"</span>'''''<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Northampton II：</span><br>
You could say that. It's half exercise, half getting out of the sun to cool off.<br>
Plus, it's quiet here, which I like. I find it easier to relax in a place like this than at a busy seaside.<br>
Much unlike Hornet. Knowing her, she's probably throwing a beach party by now.<br>
Anyway... Just curious... Wanna swim with me, Commander?<br>
We could race and see who's the fastest swimmer.<br>
I've heard the rumors about you being a secret athlete, and I wanna see how good you are. You up for that?<br>
I can't turn her down just like that. I get into some swimming gear and do a few laps with her...<br>
You know, it's odd. I've never swam that effortlessly before...<br>
Maybe it's because you're with me that it felt so easy.<br>
<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项1："Here. Have a sports drink."</span>'''''<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Northampton II：</span><br>
Oh. Thanks.<br>
...Phew! That hit the spot.<br>
I'm feeling in peak condition today, so I think I'll do some more laps after a short break.<br>
<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项1：(Sit next to her)</span>'''''<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Northampton II：</span><br>
Huh?<br>
Do I take that to mean you want to take a break with me?<br>
Well... Sure, why not.<br>
I feel her warmth course through me as she rests her body against mine.<br>
Appreciate it, Commander. Let's catch our breaths for while...<br>

Quiet, Solitude, and Fireworks<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Kazagumo：</span><br>
Oh. Commander. I didn't think you'd find me here.<br>
You followed the clues I left and swam over here, right? Good...<br>
That must've been an exhausting swim. You can rest here all you want. It's just us here.<br>
<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项1："You're alone all the way out here?"</span>'''''<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项2："Is this your secret hideaway?"</span>'''''<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Kazagumo：</span><br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项1）</span>'''''Mhm. I like having quiet places to myself. You can get a clear view of the fireworks too.<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项1）</span>'''''What's more, nobody's going to get between us when... No, never mind. I can't tell you...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Kazagumo：</span><br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项2）</span>'''''Yup. It's my special place. No one else knows about it.<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项2）</span>'''''But since you know about it now, that makes it our secret hideaway.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Kazagumo：</span><br>
Anyway, Commander, you've made me really happy.<br>
You're my best friend, and I wanted to share this place with you.<br>
I hope you can stay, take it easy, and watch the fireworks with me.<br>
While the fireworks are way over there, they still look pretty from afar.<br>
Even more so when you're with your special someone...<br>
Hey, are you thirsty? Have some of this. It'll energize you.<br>
She gives me a can of soda that feels faintly warm. She must've been holding it this whole time.<br>
I only brought one ice cream, sorry... But I have plenty of soda.<br>
Fireworks go off in the sky across the river. Their colorful glow softly lights up her cheek.<br>
...Will you stay with me and watch the fireworks?<br>

The Bard and the Blue Sea<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Brest：</span><br>
We're here, Champion. You may open your eyes.<br>
"Are we... underwater?"<br>
I have never such wonder shimmering in your eyes before... Heehee. I'm pleased to see this other side of you.<br>
This is a little magic trick of mine. But, it must be a novel experience for you, beholding the ocean floor and all its wondrous sights, no?<br>
Do not be startled. The seas hold secrets far more fantastical than my magic.<br>
Now, Champion, shall we go and seek out the ocean's secrets?<br>
<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项1：(Take Brest's hand)</span>'''''<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Brest：</span><br>
Hand in hand, we walk along the seabed. The soft white sand beneath our feet swirls like flowing water.<br>
Rays of sunshine breach the surface, casting a golden light upon faded ruins.<br>
I am sure they each had a story to tell long, long ago.<br>
Alas, the waves of time have not been kind, reducing them to fragments buried among the sand.<br>
<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项1："That's why we need songs to keep the stories alive?"</span>'''''<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项2："Faded or not, the stories live on within the ruins."</span>'''''<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Brest：</span><br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项1）</span>'''''Heehee. Yes. That way we may save those scattered pieces from being lost to time.<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项1）</span>'''''Preserving stories through song lets their glory live on – like these ruins – even if only through the listener's imagination.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Brest：</span><br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项2）</span>'''''That is true. Even if a memory is not passed on, or if pieces of it are lost... surviving artifacts can tell secrets otherwise forgotten.<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项2）</span>'''''Sculptures, carvings, and ornaments, even if weathered, offer a glimpse into how bygone civilizations prospered.<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项2）</span>'''''More pertinently... This adventure has already birthed a new tale – a tale between only you and me, Champion.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Brest：</span><br>
Being with you is ambrosia for the soul, Champion.<br>
I would love to embark with you again on more adventures, away from the hustle and bustle of everyday life.<br>
Brief but fantastical tales to interspace your heroic epic... I would quite like that.<br>
And I shall chronicle them in my paean for you.<br>
O Champion, I pray fate allows us to continue journeying together and weave even more stories.<br>

Rabbit on Watch?!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Prinz Heinrich：</span><br>
*stares bunnily*<br>
Halt! Come over here, Commander~!<br>
I'm just about to jump in the pool when Prinz Heinrich orders me to stop.<br>
I hope you weren't seriously considering going into the pool just now!<br>
Because you totally neglected to do your stretches! Don't think I didn't notice!<br>
Going into water unprepared is dangerous, you know. You could get a leg cramp!<br>
I have done lifeguard training, and I do know how to perform CPR, but that's no excuse not to take safety precautions.<br>
You're not dipping one toe in water until I've seen you do your stretches. If you don't know how to, I'll show you!<br>
C'mon, stretch those muscles! No half-assing on my watch!<br>
A couple minutes later, I finish my warmup stretches under her watchful eye.<br>
Alright, you're clear. Enjoy yourself in the pool!<br>
<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项1："Aren't you going to swim with me?"</span>'''''<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Prinz Heinrich：</span><br>
I will, later! I've got to finish my shift first.<br>
It might look like I'm just sitting around, but trust me, I'm keeping my eyes on ten different things at once.<br>
Like if everyone's done their stretches, if someone looks like they need rescuing, or if any prankster submarines are up to no good.<br>
So sadly, I've gotta watch from the sidelines until my shift is over!<br>
But hey, you're gonna stick around for a while, right?<br>
It's not too much trouble to wait for me until my replacement comes in, is it?<br>
...Awesome! Don't go back on your word later, or you'll have a very upset bunny to deal with~!<br>

Water Gun Samurai<br>
I expected a beach resort full of laughter in the air. Instead, what I got...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Noshiro：</span><br>
Found you!<br>
Was a faceful from Noshiro's water gun!<br>
Looks like I win again.<br>
What, do you think I'm taking this too seriously?<br>
Heheh... I distinctly remember YOU telling me to have fun to my heart's content today.<br>
Which is exactly what I'm doing. Or would you like to rescind your order?<br>
Whew. Water gun fights really are great fun. Invigorating, too. But what do you think, Commander?<br>
<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项1："I had a great time as well."</span>'''''<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项2："I'm left feeling a bit tired."</span>'''''<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Noshiro：</span><br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项1）</span>'''''Good to hear. I want this to be relaxing for both of us.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Noshiro：</span><br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项2）</span>'''''Tired? Aww... Maybe I should've gone a little easier on you after all.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Noshiro：</span><br>
What should we do now? May I suggest a casual stroll in the sand?<br>
The weather's not too hot, the sand is warm, and the winds are nice. Perfect conditions for a walk.<br>
We don't have to go anywhere in particular, either. Walking for walking's sake rejuvenates the body and soul.<br>
And I'd certainly like to get a little closer to you...<br>
Ahem. I don't hear any objections. Shall we get going?<br>
She starts walking in one direction, but quickly comes to a stop and turns around.。<br>
On second thought, let's go the other way. It looks crowded over there, and I'd rather avoid running into Sakawa or Agano. They'd no doubt tease you.<br>
Also, umm... Can we hold hands?<br>

Bright-Sky Mermaid<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Yorktown II：</span><br>
How does this pose look, Commander?<br>
...I look nervous to you?<br>
I don't feel nervous, I just don't know how to pose in a bikini... Give me a minute to compose myself and I'll figure it out.<br>
...It looks good on me? Thank you. Hornet picked it for me.<br>
She said I should be forward with you on our beach trip, and that an "equally forward swimsuit" would help with that.<br>
When I first saw it, I thought it was far too revealing for my tastes.<br>
But then I went to the beach and saw others wearing even more revealing swimwear. So I reconsidered. Maybe it wasn't so wrong after all, right?<br>
Besides, I can live with wearing something a more risqué when there's no one but us around.<br>
Whew... The wind feels lovely, but it is a bit strong...<br>
...Hm? What's the matter, Commander?<br>
<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项1："It's just that your bikini... well..."</span>'''''<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Yorktown II：</span><br>
What about it? I– Oh my goodness! The strap came loose!<br>
My deepest apologies, Commander! I had no idea... Hold on a second!<br>
She quickly fixes her wardrobe malfunction, but the awkwardness of it stays in the air for some time.<br>
This backdrop you chose is very tasteful, Commander. Also, is this pose any good?<br>
...Oh, forgive me, you must be exhausted. You poor thing.<br>
I know you've been busy socializing with others all day and indulging their requests.<br>
You need a well-earned break. If you'd like, you may rest your head on my lap.<br>
No need to be shy. I've let Hammann, Enterprise, and even Hornet do the same before. It's not weird to me.~<br>
Come now. This is the least I can offer to the person I'd give my life to protect.<br>
Relax, close your eyes, and listen to the tranquil sounds of the wind and the sea with me~.<br>
