A View For Two, With You<br>
<br>
1 A Girl and Her Telescope<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Emanuele Pessagno：</span><br>
Emanuele Pessagno, reporting for secretary duty.<br>
<br>
A girl lugging a giant telescope around stands at the entrance to my office.<br>
Today is her first day working as my secretary ship.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Emanuele Pessagno：</span><br>
Good morning, Commander. Umm... May I enter?<br>
<br>
"Of course. Come on in."<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Emanuele Pessagno：</span><br>
...Ah!<br>
<br>
Pessagno—who we've taken to calling Ema for short—tries to take a step, but she suddenly freezes up.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Emanuele Pessagno：</span><br>
That was close... I almost smashed my telescope against the door frame.<br>
S-sorry! Just a second...<br>
<br>
She backs off, frantically takes the telescope off of her back, and enters my office holding it with both arms.<br>
The poor girl is even more nervous than usual now.<br>
And compared to her small figure, the giant telescope stands out even more.<br>
<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项1："Is there something special about that telescope?"</span>'''''<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Emanuele Pessagno：</span><br>
Hm? Are you curious about it, Commander?<br>
It may just look like an antique monocular, but it's actually special supporting equipment.<br>
It's important for both navigation and combat... Oh, and of course, it naturally works just fine as a normal telescope.<br>
With this, you can get a perfect view of even the most distant scenery!<br>
I just love immersing myself in... Oh!<br>
Sorry. I didn't mean to go on a whole monologue...<br>
<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项1："It's good to be passionate about things. I like your telescope."</span>'''''<br>
<br>
(She's not as nervous now. I'm glad I brought it up.)<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Emanuele Pessagno：</span><br>
...Thanks, Commander.<br>
I was so worried about being given this job.<br>
People tell me I'm not very good company, they can't tell what I'm thinking, I don't express myself enough...<br>
It made me nervous thinking that you would feel the same way.<br>
But I'm okay! Now that I know you like telescopes, too...!<br>
<br>
(That's what matters to her?)<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Emanuele Pessagno：</span><br>
Da Recco was right. There's nothing to worry about as long as we're with you, Commander.<br>
<br>
"I'm glad you think so. Now, are you ready to get to work?"<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Emanuele Pessagno：</span><br>
Yeah! Leave anything to me.<br>

A View For Two, With You<br>
<br>
2 The View Through the Lens<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Emanuele Pessagno：</span><br>
Is that all of our work for today, Commander...?<br>
<br>
"Quick double-check... Yes, I'd say that's about it."<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Emanuele Pessagno：</span><br>
Okay. Then may I...<br>
<br>
Ema glances at the telescope on the other side of the room.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Emanuele Pessagno：</span><br>
*stares*... *fidgets*...<br>
*stares*... *rocks back and forth*...<br>
<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项1："Be my guest."</span>'''''<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项2：(Imitate her.)</span>'''''<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Emanuele Pessagno：</span><br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项1）</span>'''''You mean it? Thanks, Commander! Umm, while I'm at it, would you like to join me?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Emanuele Pessagno：</span><br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项2）</span>'''''Wh-why are you looking at my telescope, too...?<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项2）</span>'''''Oh, do you want to take a look through it? I'll set it up right now!<br>
<br>
Ema excitedly prepares the telescope and teaches me how to use it.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Emanuele Pessagno：</span><br>
...That'll do it. I doubt you'll be able to set up manual focus on your first try, so I put it on auto-focus for now.<br>
Here you go! Have fun.<br>
<br>
I look into the eyepiece, and a distant part of the port comes right into view.<br>
(Blue skies, white clouds, the busy wharf... and oddly, Alfredo Oriani sneaking around.)<br>
(She's hiding in the tall grass... and sneaking pictures of Elizabeth out on a stroll?)<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Emanuele Pessagno：</span><br>
How do you like it? You can see all the wharf from your office. Awesome, right?<br>
You can almost feel the sea breeze, right?!<br>
<br>
(Whoops, looks like Sirius found Alfredo in the middle of her candid photo session.)<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Emanuele Pessagno：</span><br>
Your office has a good view, so I've wanted to try this ever since I learned I'd be your secretary... Heheh...<br>
<br>
(Alfredo tries to escape, but Sheffield blocks her path! Alfredo's in huge danger!)<br>
(Too bad! Her big scoop is all but lost!)<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Emanuele Pessagno：</span><br>
...Commander? What's wrong? You haven't said a word.<br>
Heheh, are you too engrossed by what you see?<br>
<br>
"It's so interesting that I can hardly take my eyes off of it. Maybe you could call that being engrossed."<br>
Not wanting to monopolize it for too long, I reluctantly let Ema take a turn on the telescope.<br>
Ema frowns at what she sees.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Emanuele Pessagno：</span><br>
Is that... Alfredo? Why are the maids dragging her off?<br>
And she's throwing a peace sign this way?<br>
D-did she think we were snooping like her?<br>
...Wait a second. Commander, is this what you were staring at so intently?<br>
Geez...<br>
*sigh*... Anyway...<br>
I'll set it up so we can look at REAL scenery this time.<br>
<br>
She adjusts the telescope and admires the view.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Emanuele Pessagno：</span><br>
Ooh, yeah... This is really pretty...<br>
<br>
Ema carefully adjusts the telescope's positioning, moving along with it. She has a big smile on her face, clearly taken by the scenery.<br>
<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项1："Why don't we go look together?"</span>'''''<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Emanuele Pessagno：</span><br>
Can we? Like, right now?<br>
<br>
She smiles happily. There's more to scenery than what you see through a lens, after all.<br>

<br>
3 Out of Focus<br>
The door to my office slowly opens, and one dejected Ema appears.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Emanuele Pessagno：</span><br>
Hi, Commander...<br>
<br>
After weakly greeting me, she takes a seat and stares vacantly at the documents.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Emanuele Pessagno：</span><br>
So I organize these files... And then these...<br>
<br>
(I don't think she realizes that she's been sorting the same pile of documents over and over.)<br>
(She's clearly not all here... Something must be wrong.)<br>
<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项1："I think you've sorted those enough."</span>'''''<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项2："Is something wrong?"</span>'''''<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Emanuele Pessagno：</span><br>
...Huh?<br>
Oh, the files!<br>
Sorry... I'm not getting any work done at all, am I?<br>
<br>
"It's not a big deal. Checking and rechecking your work is good practice."<br>
"If there's anything bothering you, though, I'm happy to listen."<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Emanuele Pessagno：</span><br>
Well...<br>
<br>
She's still sad, but Ema tells me what happened.<br>
Earlier, at the port...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Emanuele Pessagno：</span><br>
(Morning at the port is pretty in such a different way! Good thing I took this little detour.)<br>
(Oh, what just jumped up that tree? A squirrel...?)<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Pamiat' Merkuria：</span><br>
Whoooa, big telescope!<br>
Whatcha looking at? Something cool?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Emanuele Pessagno：</span><br>
(I hear someone talking, but... I doubt they're talking to me.)<br>
(Focus on that tree... You might find a little house of squirrels!)<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Avrora：</span><br>
Now, now. Don't disturb her.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Pamiat' Merkuria：</span><br>
Aww... Yeah, I know I shouldn't.<br>
But now I really wanna know what she's looking at!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Emanuele Pessagno：</span><br>
(Hmm... Are they talking to me?)<br>
Oh! You two are from the Northern Parliament, right...?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Avrora：</span><br>
Yes. I'm Avrora, and this is Pamiat' Merkuria. You would be Sardegna's Emanuele Pessagno, yes?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Emanuele Pessagno：</span><br>
Right! Sorry... I didn't realize you were talking to me.<br>
Umm, do you need something...?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Pamiat' Merkuria：</span><br>
Me and Avrora here were just investigating this area.<br>
With that huge telescope, you must know which places have a good view, right? Any recommendations?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Emanuele Pessagno：</span><br>
Recommendations? Umm... For what, exactly?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Pamiat' Merkuria：</span><br>
Duh—for a date with the Commander, of course♪<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Emanuele Pessagno：</span><br>
D-date?!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Pamiat' Merkuria：</span><br>
Yeah! I need date ideas!<br>
C'mon, tell me any places that you can think of!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Emanuele Pessagno：</span><br>
U-umm, well...<br>
(I have gotten curious and looked for fun date destinations, but...)<br>
(A first date would be... There, of course. And after that, erm... Right, I'd have to recommend...)<br>
(Then, if you had time, you'd go there... Oh, and you can't miss that one... Hmm...)<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Pamiat' Merkuria：</span><br>
Hellooo? You there?<br>
...Yeah, forget it. She's overheating so much, her head's gonna start smoking.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Emanuele Pessagno：</span><br>
I-I...<br>
(This is bad... I already have the perfect route in mind, but how do I even begin to tell them...)<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Avrora：</span><br>
Kuku, it's not nice to tease. We're sorry for disturbing you.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Pamiat' Merkuria：</span><br>
Ahaha... Yeah, my bad. We actually just happened to be passing by, y'know.<br>
I was kidding about the date thing! Calm down a little.<br>
Okay! Geez, Avrora, I'm coming! You don't have to pull!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Emanuele Pessagno：</span><br>
I wasn't really worried or unwilling to tell them...<br>
There are so many places I want people to know about, but I just don't know how to communicate it...<br>
Ugh, come on, Ema...<br>
I really wanted to tell them, but for some reason, the words won't come out.<br>
Maybe it's true what they say...<br>
I'm not very good company, it's impossible to tell what I'm thinking, and I don't express myself enough...<br>
<br>
(She's only making herself feel worse. I should do something.)<br>
<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项1："Is there anywhere you'd like to go?"</span>'''''<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Emanuele Pessagno：</span><br>
Y-yeah!<br>
But... *sigh*...<br>
<br>
(I was able to get her mind off of it, if only for a moment. Let's keep this up.)<br>

A View For Two, With You<br>
<br>
4 Out of Sight<br>
Ema and I climb a nearby mountain together.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Emanuele Pessagno：</span><br>
Thanks for coming with me, Commander.<br>
I've always wanted to show someone the scenery from here.<br>
Umm, anyway, I'll set up the telescope right away!<br>
<br>
"So you've been here a few times before."<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Emanuele Pessagno：</span><br>
Yep. It won't take long for me to set up.<br>
<br>
"In that case..."<br>
"I think I'd prefer not to look through the telescope this time."<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Emanuele Pessagno：</span><br>
While we're at it, you can... Huh?<br>
<br>
I want you to tell me what you see, through your own words.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Emanuele Pessagno：</span><br>
Oh, I get it... You want me to practice my communication.<br>
But are you sure, Commander?<br>
We went through all the effort of climbing up here, and you just want to... listen to me describing the scenery?<br>
I'm really... not good at this stuff...<br>
<br>
"Everything is hard at first."<br>
"Besides, I can see plenty without the telescope already."<br>
"Not everything you want to see has to be beyond the lens of a telescope."<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Emanuele Pessagno：</span><br>
That sounds oddly philosophical...<br>
Okay. If you're really sure, then I'll do my best to describe everything as best as I can.<br>
Uh, wait just a second...<br>
...Huh?<br>
Wh-why...? I can't get it to work automatically or manually!<br>
<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项1："Is something wrong?"</span>'''''<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Emanuele Pessagno：</span><br>
The focuser is malfunctioning...<br>
A-aww, man...<br>
This is all my fault. I use it so much, but I've been slacking on maintenance.<br>
I wanted to look upon all the scenery...<br>
And tell you all about it, and how I feel...<br>
I mustered all my courage and resolved myself, but now...<br>
<br>
The telescope malfunction hurts her feelings more than I'd expected.<br>
"There's nothing we can do about it now. It's a shame, but all we can do is go back."<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Emanuele Pessagno：</span><br>
Okay...! As soon as we get back, I'll ask da Vinci to repair it for me.<br>
Once it's ready, we'll come back together! Promise me!<br>

<br>
5 Close-Up<br>
Three days later...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Emanuele Pessagno：</span><br>
Hi, Commander...<br>
<br>
The door to my office slowly opens, and once again, one dejected Ema appears.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Emanuele Pessagno：</span><br>
Da Vinci's taking so long this time...<br>
Y-You don't think she's adding some weird features to my telescope, is she?!<br>
Worry... Fear... Concern...<br>
<br>
Even as she mumbles about her feelings, she never stops organizing documents.<br>
(I need to put a stop to this. It's about time for a certain invention of da Vinci's to take the stage.)<br>
<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项1："Take this."</span>'''''<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Emanuele Pessagno：</span><br>
The... Scenery-Spiffying Telescope Mk.II? Th-thanks, I'll give it a try.<br>
...Hm? Uhh... It doesn't have any lenses?<br>
How are you supposed to look at the scenery...?<br>
<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项1："Don't worry about that."</span>'''''<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项2："Just give it a try."</span>'''''<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Emanuele Pessagno：</span><br>
Are you saying I should look at what's around me, instead of seeing everything through a lens?<br>
Yeah... Maybe you're right.<br>
Telescopes let you see distant things with such clarity.<br>
I end up getting so focused on those things...<br>
It made me forget all about everything close to me.<br>
To communicate with others, you need to see them head-on. I've always missed this simple, but vital truth.<br>
Yeah... I'll give this one a try, Commander!<br>
Hmm, so this is the seat you always sit in...<br>
Every day, you sit here and do your work...<br>
This is your coat rack, where you put your hat and jacket...<br>
Hmm... Those are some interesting books on your shelf. I'd never noticed...<br>
And over here... Eep!<br>
Sorry, Commander! I should watch where I'm going...<br>
<br>
*knock* *knock*<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Pamiat' Merkuria：</span><br>
Yoohoo, Commander!<br>
Hey, it's the telescope dork, too!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Emanuele Pessagno：</span><br>
U-Umm...?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Avrora：</span><br>
Ema, was it? Sorry for her...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Pamiat' Merkuria：</span><br>
Heheh, my bad.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Emanuele Pessagno：</span><br>
Uh, it's... fine...?<br>
We met before, didn't we? The girls from the Northern Parliament?<br>
I'm sorry I couldn't be more helpful last time. Do you have business here?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Avrora：</span><br>
Yes, we have some documents that we'd like the Commander to check.<br>
And... Not to be rude, but why are you looking at us through a telescope?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Emanuele Pessagno：</span><br>
Umm, i-it's a long story... Sorry you had to see me like this...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Pamiat' Merkuria：</span><br>
Don't be silly. As far as I can tell, you're not Ema without a telescope!<br>
Weird that you've got it pointed inside instead of outside, though.<br>
Hahah! Does that mean I'm part of the scenery?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Emanuele Pessagno：</span><br>
(In a way, she's actually right...)<br>
U-Umm, basically, this is...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Pamiat' Merkuria：</span><br>
Don't worry about it! No need to force yourself to explain everything.<br>
We're just here to report to the Commander. Once we finish, we're out.<br>
Heheh♪ I get the feeling we're gonna hear all about Ema's favorite spots soon~<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Emanuele Pessagno：</span><br>
You mean the date destinations?<br>
I'll do my best to get better at communicating, so just give me a little longer...<br>
<br>
"What's this about dates?"<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Pamiat' Merkuria：</span><br>
Whoa whoa whoa! That was a joke, I swear! A joke!<br>
Gosh, why is this girl so serious about everything?!<br>
Oh, yeah! I just remembered we're here for a thing! Avrora, show them the thing!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Emanuele Pessagno：</span><br>
And there she goes...<br>
Did I say something weird?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Avrora：</span><br>
Pamiat' will be just fine. Shall we get back to work?<br>
Now, regarding this document...<br>

<br>
6 A Columnist's Debut<br>
One week later, during lunch...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Emanuele Pessagno：</span><br>
Phew... Thank goodness. Da Vinci didn't add any weird features to my telescope.<br>
<br>
After thoroughly inspecting her repaired telescope, Ema breathes a sigh of relief.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Emanuele Pessagno：</span><br>
I'll need to thank her properly later. This telescope is really important to me...<br>
<br>
Just then, with a bang, the door to my office is thrown open.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Alfredo Oriani：</span><br>
Ema, are you here?!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Emanuele Pessagno：</span><br>
Yes, but...<br>
Alfredo, make sure you knock before entering next time.<br>
Also, keep your voice down during breaks.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Alfredo Oriani：</span><br>
Sorry, sorry! I just got great news and wanted to let you know ASAP!<br>
I'll be more careful next time.<br>
<br>
(If it has Alfredo this worked up, then...)<br>
<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项1："Tell us the good news."</span>'''''<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Alfredo Oriani：</span><br>
Heheh... Listen, and be amazed! Ema and I did a collab column in the port newspaper, and it's a big hit!<br>
<br>
Collab column...?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Alfredo Oriani：</span><br>
C'mon, work it out. We made a column on scenery together!<br>
She writes like she's serving you a slice of the real deal. Readers say we've given them a sense of immersion so good that it feels like they're actually there!<br>
It's just our first one, but it's already the talk of the port!<br>
Of course, it's partially thanks to my own pizzazz. Check out this title: "Behold, Hidden Vistas! Seven Secrets of the Port You NEVER Knew!"<br>
Wait, Ema! You did a really good job, so why didn't you tell the Commander?!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Emanuele Pessagno：</span><br>
U-umm... It slipped my mind?<br>
Ahem. Here's my next manuscript. That's enough small talk, so you'd better get it ready soon.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Alfredo Oriani：</span><br>
Ooh, another spectacular article! New sales records! I can see it... I can see it!<br>
Heheh, geheheheh... By the way, Ema, you've changed since you became a secretary ship.<br>
Before, I never would've dreamed of YOU inviting ME to do something together.<br>
And you keep giving me these awesome articles!<br>
By the way, I brought the reader survey with me!<br>
Heheh, we've already got letters about your debut column!<br>
This one says "to the telescope dork," so I could tell at a glance that it was for you.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Emanuele Pessagno：</span><br>
O-okay... Leave it there, and I promise I'll read it later.<br>
Don't you think you should get back to work? I'm sure there are plenty of huge scoops with your name on them.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Alfredo Oriani：</span><br>
A-alright, just stop pushing me!<br>
Bye, Commander! I'll bring the next one as soon as it's ready! I'd better get going for today!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Emanuele Pessagno：</span><br>
Okay, that's enough goodbyes... Be on your way, please!<br>
<br>
Ema chases Alfredo out of my office, blushing bright red all the while.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Emanuele Pessagno：</span><br>
Alfredo always says too much... *sigh*...<br>
<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项1："Congratulations, Ema."</span>'''''<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项2："You could've told me."</span>'''''<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Emanuele Pessagno：</span><br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项1）</span>'''''Erm, I couldn't find the right timing... B-besides...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Emanuele Pessagno：</span><br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项2）</span>'''''Aww, don't look at me like that... I just didn't mention it because...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Emanuele Pessagno：</span><br>
You don't need to go out of your way and read the columns...<br>
I-I mean... I'm right here next to you.<br>
If there are any sights you want to know about, I'm happy to tell you...<br>
<br>
Ema closes her eyes tight and manages to squeak it all out.<br>
She blushes as she goes back to her seat. Then, she goes back to work as if nothing happened...<br>
...All the while ignorant of the bomb she just dropped.<br>

7 Beautiful Sights<br>
A few days later, Ema invites me out again.<br>
Thus, we climb to the top of the same mountain.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Emanuele Pessagno：</span><br>
Wait a second... I still need to adjust the telescope a bit.<br>
<br>
She single-mindedly focuses on the view, adjusting the telescope through the lens. Sometimes, she writes something in her notes.<br>
Even now, she loves seeing distant sights through her telescope. But...<br>
She's also learned how to appreciate what's right in front of her.<br>
And no matter the distance, she does her very best to convey what she sees.<br>

...There. It's done.<br>
Commander? You look happy. Did you get good news today?<br>
<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项1："I'm happy for you, Ema."</span>'''''<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项2："I'm just excited to see the sights."</span>'''''<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Emanuele Pessagno：</span><br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项1）</span>'''''For me...? Where's this coming from?<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项1）</span>'''''U-umm... Thanks, I think?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Emanuele Pessagno：</span><br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项2）</span>'''''Yeah! Me, too...<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项2）</span>'''''I've been looking forward to today...<br>
<br>
Ema takes a deep breath, as if steeling her resolve. Then...<br>
She circles behind me and gently pushes me toward the telescope.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Emanuele Pessagno：</span><br>
It's important to see things in the distance, but you can't neglect what's close to you.<br>
Thank you for helping me realize that, Commander.<br>
Because of you, I can see so many things that I'd overlooked before.<br>
And... I want to return the favor.<br>
I set up the perfect vista for you. One that I've always wanted you to see.<br>
Also... Umm...<br>
While you look through the telescope, I'll view the same scenery without it...<br>
And I'll whisper what I see... into your ear...<br>
<br>
Ema gently leans against me.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Emanuele Pessagno：</span><br>
Yeah... Let's enjoy the scenery, both near and far, together.<br>
