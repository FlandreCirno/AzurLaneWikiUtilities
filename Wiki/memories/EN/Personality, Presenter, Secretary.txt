<br>
1.A Secretary of Many Talents<br>
It's past noon, and Guam is enjoying her lunch, having just finished a hectic shoot.<br>
The "lunch" in question is some fast food she bought on her way to my office, and she has almost already wolfed it down.<br>
<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项1：What's the rush? Take your time eating it.</span>'''''<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Nobody will kill you for taking a few minutes extra on your lunch break.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Guam：</span><br>
Nom... Nah... Om nom... I'm almost done. My afternoon work is too important to delay even a few minutes.<br>
<br>
Guam is my current secretary, and apparently is also able to devour food with a speed I've never seen before.<br>
In addition to her secretary duties, she also has obligations as a personality and a presenter.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Why DID you volunteer to serve as my secretary when your schedule is already so packed?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Guam：</span><br>
Why? 'Cause I wanna help you out, obviously! Full disclosure, though: I also want the experience that comes with it.<br>
Phew... I really murdered that meal. Alright, Commander, what work are we starting with?<br>
<br>
Our stunning, multitalented news anchor is psyched up and raring to go.<br>
<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项1：You can rest a bit longer if you want, you know.</span>'''''<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Guam：</span><br>
Oh, please. What are you, a nurse? I'll be fiiine. I've got energy to spare!<br>
Besides, this girl's gotta catch up on the secretary tasks she wasn't here for in the morning!<br>
<br>
She cracks her knuckles and starts working through the afternoon tasks waiting for her.<br>
The raw motivation she displays alone deserves praise.<br>
Although, she does have some... difficulties when it comes to processing documents.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Guam：</span><br>
Oh boy, I don't like the way you're looking at me all of a sudden...<br>
Do I really have to... you know... be thorough? Can't I just half-ass this paperwork?<br>
<br>
Sadly, her motivation is fickle, it comes as quickly as it goes away.<br>
After but one glance at the papers, her willpower has evaporated like water in a frying pan.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Good idea. Maybe I'll half-ass your vacation application as well.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Guam：</span><br>
Okay, forget I said that! No more messing around! I'm gonna process these papers like my life depends on it!<br>
<br>
Like I said – it comes as quickly as it goes away.<br>
Seeing her motivation rekindled like this reminds me of when she had just started out as my secretary.<br>

<br>
2.Work Efficiency: Zero<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
(Oh boy... There's so much. I'll have to pull an all-nighter.)<br>
<br>
Looking at the files stacked high on my desk, I can't help but feel despondent.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Guam：</span><br>
Commander? You're still here? Shouldn't you get ready to leave?<br>
<br>
My secretary as of a few days ago, Guam, raises this question.<br>
I got the impression that she was a truly first-rate secretary when, on day one, she did half of my paperwork for the day all by herself.<br>
However, when I examined her work, I discovered that I would need to redo a whopping 90% of it.<br>
I thought it was just a starting-out thing. It was her first day on the job, after all. Unfortunately, days two and three went largely the same.<br>
It is now day four. I have procrastinated on some things as well, leaving me with this absurd amount of work to do.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Oh, uh... There's just one last thing I have to do. Don't worry about me, you're free to leave.<br>
(Her workplace morale is important. Improving her performance is important, too, but... I guess I'll do that step by step.)<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Guam：</span><br>
Really? Aren't you gonna have dinner?<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
I'm not hungry yet. I'll eat once I'm finished.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Guam：</span><br>
Well, if you say so. Hang in there!<br>
<br>
I breathe a deep sigh as I watch my supportive secretary leave.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Alright, let's prioritize the stuff I left on the backburner...<br>
<br>
I'll think about dinner once I have some room to breathe.<br>
The late-night silence is broken by a knocking on my door.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
(Who could that be at THIS hour?)<br>
Come in.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Guam：</span><br>
Good evening! Your beautiful secretary has come to pay you a late visit! Aren't you happy to see me?<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
What brings you here this late?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Guam：</span><br>
Call it an itch. An itch to see if you've actually had dinner yet or not!<br>
And my gut tells me YOUR gut is as empty as Omaha's snack drawer. I knew you'd forget to eat, which is why I've brought you this!<br>
<br>
She places the plastic bag in her hand on my desk. An appetizing steam rises from the bag's opening.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Guam：</span><br>
I got you that Sakuran bento thingy everyone's been raving about! It's so exclusive, you basically need to be an influencer to get one!<br>
Which I kind of am, I guess? There was a huge line at the store after I finished filming, but I managed to nab one somehow!<br>
Come with me and let's eat! I'm telling you, this stuff hits different at night.<br>
<br>
She is just about to drag me out of my seat, but as she extends her hand to me, she notices the pile of papers on my desk.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Guam：</span><br>
Hey, what's this?<br>
<br>
The time to cover it up has passed. She picks up the document I was just going through.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Guam：</span><br>
Hang on a sec... Didn't I do this one earlier today?<br>
Same with this... And this one's from yesterday!<br>
Is this entire pile made up of documents I worked on?!<br>
So... It's all my fault that you've been working so late these past few days?<br>
<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项1：Mhm.</span>'''''<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项2：...</span>'''''<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Guam：</span><br>
You shoulda told me sooner! This is no joke, Commander! I thought it was fine to wing it and write whatever seemed right!<br>
Because, like... Come on, isn't paperwork just a thing adults do to kill time?<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Uh...<br>
It's definitely not, but you're not entirely off the mark either.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Guam：</span><br>
Look, what I'm trying to say is – I'm so, so sorry for making you work more! I'll start over right here and now!<br>
<br>
She picks up a stack of papers before she has even finished speaking, sits down at her desk, and gets to work immediately.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Hang on a second!<br>
<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项1：What about the food?</span>'''''<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项2：Do you know what to do?</span>'''''<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Guam：</span><br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项1）</span>'''''Oh, right! I totally forgot in the middle of all that.<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项1）</span>'''''The papers aren't going anywhere, but the food won't stay hot forever, sooo... Can I eat first, then work, please?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Guam：</span><br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项2）</span>'''''Of course... not. Please enlighten me!<br>
<br>
My sleepless night continues...<br>

3.Interview Intermission<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Guam：</span><br>
Morning, everybody! This is Eagle Union CB-2, Guam, bringing you another report!<br>
Have a look at this! The battle is at its fiercest yet! But who will come out on top?<br>
Oh! Cleveland is gearing up to finish this! She's lining up aaand... Bam! What a shot! Up next...<br>
Whoa, the winning team has arrived!<br>
That was a wonderful match today! Do you have any words for the viewers at home?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Cleveland：</span><br>
Hm? What's this? A post-game interview?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Guam：</span><br>
Just tell us your thoughts. Don't think about it too hard!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Cleveland：</span><br>
Ahahah. Well, I went with the flow, saw my chance, and went for it...<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
There's our presenter.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Guam：</span><br>
Hey, Commander! Whatcha doing here on your day off? Were you watching the exercise?<br>
Both the teams that fought today were pretty damn awesome, if I say so myself.<br>
Oh, I know! You're a professional and know tactics and stuff, so what are your thoughts on the match?<br>
<br>
Guam, wasting not one moment, thrusts the microphone right in front of me to speak into.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Uh, is this an interview? I thought the broadcast was over?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Guam：</span><br>
You're right, it is! But I need material for my evening broadcast, too!<br>
Don't be afraid to get long-winded. I'll need to edit the clips later anyway.<br>
Also, the viewers are gonna go wild when they see you on camera, so if you could say something to them, that'd be perfect!<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Okay. To start with...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Guam：</span><br>
Wow. I had no idea they put THAT much thought into their choice of tactics.<br>
Alright, thanks a bunch for your valuable time! I've now got all I need to make a fantastic episode!<br>
<br>
I remark on how Guam feels different when she's in front of the camera.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Guam：</span><br>
Heheh, well, yeah! That's cause I'm in reporter mode.<br>
And I'm not gonna slack on my secretary work later! Once I finish my program, I'm heading straight home to study how to file paperwork!<br>
Ahah, I know that look. You're worried about me, aren't you?<br>
I appreciate the sentiment, but you should know this multitalented hottie is more capable than you think!<br>
I can deal with anything with a big smile even when my schedule's packed tighter than a nun's behind!<br>
Anyhow, I've gotta interview more people now. Cameramanjuu crew, follow me!<br>
And if you've got the time, be sure to tune in to the show tonight!<br>
I'll see you on the other side of the TV!<br>

4.Commentary<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Guam：</span><br>
"Huh? I get to answer? Umm, the answer is... Aw, shoot! Time's up!"<br>
<br>
A familiar voice flows through the computer speakers in my office.<br>
On the screen, I see Guam in her studio, smiling an exaggerated grin.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Guam：</span><br>
Commander! You watching my show?<br>
Ah, this part! Yeah, it was hilarious to record. A very rare sight of Essex laughing her ass off, too.<br>
<br>
Guam, in the flesh, walks in through my door whilst laughing to herself.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Guam：</span><br>
What do you think? Did you like it?<br>
<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项1：It was pretty funny.</span>'''''<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项2：You put on a great show.</span>'''''<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Guam：</span><br>
You mean it? Thanks! I'm relieved to hear you say that.<br>
Also, why were you watching it here all by yourself? You should've totally watched it with me.<br>
It's more fun that way! 'Cause then I can point at dumb stuff I said and laugh about it with you.<br>
It's like a commentary track, you know?<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Won't that take even more time out of your already busy schedule?<br>
To borrow an expression, wind up a pocket watch too much and the spring will break.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Guam：</span><br>
Oh no! Without the spring, we'd only have 3 seasons a year!<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
...Are we playing the straight man and the fool now?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Guam：</span><br>
Heh. I just felt like it'd be funny to say. I'm always looking for new material for my show.<br>
<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项1：It is funny, but as I was saying...</span>'''''<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项2：Let's get back on topic.</span>'''''<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Guam：</span><br>
True, true. Come to think of it, my schedule HAS been pretty tight lately.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
I have no idea how you manage it. You can apply for a vacation if you feel overwhelmed, you know.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Guam：</span><br>
Hahah, yeah... How DO I do it? I guess my passion gets me through the worst of it.<br>
Being a presenter, a personality, and a secretary all at once isn't easy...<br>
But I do it because I like it. I don't want to quit.<br>
"What about the physical toll," you ask? I'm always full of energy, so I wouldn't worry about it!<br>
Now, where's that afternoon work? Lemme at 'em, coach!<br>
Vrrroom! I'm comin' in hot!<br>
<br>
She extends her arms and imitates a bomber plane as she charges at the pile of paperwork, announcing the start of her afternoon shift.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Now we're entering the domain of theatrics...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Guam：</span><br>
Heehee... I do appreciate your concern, Commander, and I hear you.<br>
I'll try to ease up my schedule, take breaks, and still do my job as a secretary. Is that good enough?<br>
<br>
She takes a seat and immediately buries her head in documents.<br>
I get the feeling this is going to be a lively afternoon.<br>

5.Secret Plans<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Guam：</span><br>
Phew! I've finished everything now. Just need you to review it, Commander.<br>
<br>
Just before she clocks out, Guam hands me a thick stack of documents with a smug look.<br>
I pick a few papers at random and scrutinize them thoroughly. While there are some faults, I can't find anything I would call outright incorrect. It seems her efforts to improve have paid off.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
You've gotten a lot better, and that deserves a reward. You're free this Sunday, aren't you?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Guam：</span><br>
Hang on, are you asking me on a date? Because hell yeah, I'm game!<br>
Sunday, though... Gaaahhh! Why Sunday of all days?!<br>
<br>
Her expression lights up like a midsummer day, but then the rain clouds come.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Do you have something else planned for that day?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Guam：</span><br>
Yeah... I can't reschedule for it...<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
It's fine, it's out of your control. How about next Sunday, then?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Guam：</span><br>
That works!<br>
Oh, on a random note, can I ask you a favor?<br>
I'd like to use your office this Sunday.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Use... my office? What for?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Guam：</span><br>
I'm gonna record something for my show! That's all I can say, 'cause the rest is top secret. You'll see for yourself when it airs.<br>
Don't worry, I won't make a mess of the place! Promise!<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
(Frankly, I have big concerns about this, but she did turn down my offer in favor of whatever she has planned, so...)<br>
<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项1：Alright, it's yours.</span>'''''<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项2：(Tease her first, then approve it.)</span>'''''<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项2）</span>'''''For the sake of argument, let's say I don't let you use it.<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项2）</span>'''''Then you'll be free on Sunday, and we can hit the city together.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Guam：</span><br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项2）</span>'''''I... guess that's reasoning is airtight. You cunning demon, you!<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项2）</span>'''''I'm just messing with you. You're free to use the office.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Guam：</span><br>
Shweet! You're awesome, Commander!<br>
<br>
She throws her hands into the air and exclaims in joy. The clouds dimming her expression give way in a heartbeat, and she smiles brightly as the sun again.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Guam：</span><br>
But remember, no peeking on Sunday! Got it?<br>
Promise on your life and honor! No peeking!<br>
<br>
Guam casually submits a formal application to use the office before she wraps up her day's work.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
She's even submitting forms now. It's great to see that she's developing a secretary's mindset.<br>
I'd better start filling out the schedule for next week...<br>

6.Break Day and Date Day<br>
Weekend, one week later - Port commercial district<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Guam：</span><br>
Lookie, Commander! That bunny-bun looks just like Laffey! Well, actually, it looks more like Benson...<br>
But either way, isn't it so cute you just wanna eat it up? Let's get one!<br>
<br>
Guam points at a round, stuffed bunny inside the claw game. She lights up like a Christmas tree, beaming with excitement.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Guam：</span><br>
Oh! They're selling ice cream over there! I want some!<br>
But I also wanna watch a movie, so... Hmm...<br>
I've got it! Let's go to the clothing store!<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Uh...<br>
<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项1：What about the rabbit?</span>'''''<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项2：Weren't we going to get ice cream?</span>'''''<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项3：You changed your mind about the movie?</span>'''''<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Guam：</span><br>
I hate having to choose, so let's just do them all!<br>
What that means is – first, we'll buy the movie tickets, then get the ice cream, then after we've watched the movie, we'll nab the plushie then return to this spot!<br>
Perfect plan, right? I'm such a genius.<br>
Come on, let's hurry, or we're gonna miss the start of the movie!<br>
<br>
Just like that, she scurries off and gets in line at the ticket booth.<br>
The movie was about love and separation.<br>
Once we emerge from the movie theater, Guam has tears dripping down her cheeks.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Guam：</span><br>
*sob*... Why did it end on such a heartbreaking note?<br>
Why couldn't they have a happy ending? A couple in love should be allowed to live together happily, dammit!<br>
*sniffle*... I should never have listened to Albacore! "The best film to watch on a date with the Commander," my ass!<br>
I cried so much, my makeup is ruined... *sob*... I need to powder my nose...<br>
<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项1：(Give her the round bunny plushie.)</span>'''''<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Guam：</span><br>
That's... That's the spitting-image-of-Benson plushie I said I wanted!<br>
But wait, how'd you get it? You were in the theater with me the whole time...<br>
Did you use, dare I say... magic?<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Let's just say I pulled some strings. The movie made you pretty sad, and I thought this would cheer you up.<br>
Also, fun fact – this bunny isn't based on Laffey or Benson, but rather the moon rabbit, which symbolizes a happy reunion in Dragon Empery culture.<br>
The symbolism isn't a perfect fit for this occasion, but you still want it, don't you?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Guam：</span><br>
You bet! It represents reunions, eh... This little cutie is getting a spot on my bed!<br>
Because reunion is a much better thing than separation to remember this day by! Heehee.<br>
<br>
She's back to her normal, cheerful self again.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Guam：</span><br>
Aw, crap! Look how late it is!<br>
My show's gonna start real soon... Dang it, we'll just have to find a place to sit down!<br>
Like... The park! Let's go, double time!<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
What? But–<br>
<br>
She grabs me by the arm and leads me off to the park before I can even ask any questions.<br>
We've been out and about the whole day, and she still has energy to spare... Guam really is something else.<br>

7.Double the Truth<br>
Guam spreads out a picnic blanket on the grass in the park before immediately sitting down and turning on her phone.<br>
Laughter pours out of her phone's speaker. That means her show has officially started.<br>
Port - Office<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Akashi：</span><br>
C-Commander, we've got a big problem, nya!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Essex：</span><br>
Whoa, Akashi, take a deep breath. What's wrong?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Akashi：</span><br>
The harbor is jam-packed with ships bringing supplies, nya!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Essex：</span><br>
Right. I was expecting a delivery today.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Akashi：</span><br>
Yeah, but there are so many, nya! There are 150 ships, nya!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Essex：</span><br>
One-hundred and fifty?! THAT many?! What are they bringing?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Akashi：</span><br>
I think it's all stuff intended for a major operation, nya!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Essex：</span><br>
What operation? I'm the Commander here, and I haven't heard anything about that.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Akashi：</span><br>
They're calling it, "Operation Cleanup," nya...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Guam：</span><br>
Oh, Operation Cleanup! Now I know what it's about!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Essex：</span><br>
...Go on.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Guam：</span><br>
I was filling out a document a few days ago and thought the name sounded cool, so I went with it.<br>
It being an operation, I figured you'd need supplies. And the more supplies, the better, right?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Essex：</span><br>
So you've figured out logistics... I can't believe how fast you learn.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Guam：</span><br>
Heehee, yeah. I've got a good noggin on me!<br>
Paperwork is just adult busywork, you know? You can half-ass it and nobody's really gonna care!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Leonardo da Vinci：</span><br>
Commander, I'm here with what you asked for. The roomba that cleans at 80 meters a second is done!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Essex：</span><br>
...80 meters a second? It moves at 288 kilometers an hour?<br>
That'll break someone's legs if it crashes into them! Why'd you make it so fast?!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Guam：</span><br>
Oh... That's REALLY fast... I think I made a mistake in my calculations. Oopsies! Math is hard!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Essex：</span><br>
You do know calculators exist, right? Why don't you use one?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Guam：</span><br>
Because using them is the hard part! Besides, this is fine! Now we have the world's fastest roomba, and that's sick!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Essex：</span><br>
Guaaam!<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Either Essex is a really good actor, or that yell was her genuine reaction.<br>
<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项1：So this is what you needed my office for last week, huh?</span>'''''<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Guam：</span><br>
Bingo. I got inspired by my complete paperwork blunder the other week.<br>
I decided I'd turn it into this little comedy skit!<br>
Firstly, it's my apology to you. Secondly, it's a bit of self-admonition. Thirdly, it's a PSA to tell others to take the work of a secretary seriously!<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
So it's kind of like edutainment, in a way.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Guam：</span><br>
That's one way to put it! Granted, I didn't put THAT much thought into it.<br>
The way I'd describe it is, I just learned a bunch of things on the job and wanted others to get something from it.<br>
It's kind of a self-report that reflects badly on you, though... You're not mad at me for putting this on TV, are you, Commander?<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Far from it. In fact...<br>
<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项1：I think it's a great skit.</span>'''''<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项2：Next time, you should let me play myself.</span>'''''<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Guam：</span><br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项1）</span>'''''I'm glad to hear you like it!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Guam：</span><br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项2）</span>'''''Whoa! Okay, you've got it!<br>
<br>
Before I know it, we're on the last few minutes of the show.<br>
Guam, in the show, has finally caught on to her numerous mistakes and makes efforts to better herself, ultimately culminating in her becoming an excellent secretary.<br>
The same is true for the real-world Guam. She has found time in her busy schedule to learn and improve, and she is now as good a secretary as any.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
You really put your all into your pursuits, don't you?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Guam：</span><br>
Not really? I just do whatever feels right. It's spontaneous, and that's how I like it.<br>
And what I feel is right is getting better and better until I'm as good a secretary as I am in the show!<br>
<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项1：I'd say you already are.</span>'''''<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Guam：</span><br>
Come on, you're just saying that. I've obviously still got A LOT to learn.<br>
Which is to say, please let me keep working as your secretary so I can prove myself!<br>
I want to become the number one secretary in your heart, and I'm gonna practice my butt off until then!<br>
So, if tomorrow you see some room for improvement, don't be afraid to let me know!<br>
