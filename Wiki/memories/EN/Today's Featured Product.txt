<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Akashi：</span><br>
It's now year three since my big sale started... and I've discovered a critical problem, nya.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
A... critical problem?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Akashi：</span><br>
Yeah, nya! It's that it's completely missing the VIBE of a big sale, nya. I've been agonizing over how to solve that, nya.<br>
After thinking about it for a looong time, I've finally got it – I'm gonna start a livestream shopping program to boost my sales, nya!<br>
Businesses need to adapt to the shifting sands of time or get left in the dust, nya!<br>
Check out what I've got so far, nya.<br>
<br>
Akashi turns on the television, showing a video of Kearsarge who for some reason is surrounded by piles of products.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Kearsarge：</span><br>
Hey, everyone. I'm Kearsarge, the sales ambassador for this occasion.<br>
Left parenthesis, try to sound happy and excited, nya, right parenthesis.<br>
I'm going to show you several truly jaw-dropping bargains you can get during this sale. Dash.<br>
Including an amazing limited bundle deal, exclamation mark, exclamation mark, exclamation mark.<br>
Left parenthesis, make sure to really sell this one because it's my bread and butter, nya, right parenthesis.<br>
This bundle contains several things too good to pass on, such as–<br>
<br>
Akashi presses the TV's off button, terminating the feed of Kearsarge's deadpan reading of the script.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
......<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Akashi：</span><br>
Oh boy, nya... When I told her to "read the script," I wasn't expecting her to take it THIS literally, nya!<br>
But hey, it's okay, nya! This mistake taught me a lot, nya! Tomorrow's stream is gonna go much better, nya!<br>
Now, I'm gonna take my leave, nya. I need to make a few tweaks to improve the show, nya!<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
...She's doing this again tomorrow?<br>

<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Akashi：</span><br>
I'm back, nya~ I've given the show the tweaks it needed, nya!<br>
Most notably, I had my ambassador memorize the script, nya. I guarantee you orders are gonna come flooding in this time, nya!<br>
Time to find out, nya... Turn on the TV, nya!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Regensburg：</span><br>
Today's exclusive deal is this parts bundle. It's packed with items that substantially improve your battlefield performance. I even use it myself.<br>
That's not all, though. Look at this Iron Blood-developed rigging maintenance kit.<br>
Whether your rigging is bionic, mechanical, or even a shikigami, this kit makes every step of maintaining it easy as pie.<br>
Does rigging maintenance still cause you unnecessary headaches?<br>
Then come to Iron Blood and we'll do everything for you. Our techniques guarantee peace of mind for you and your rig–<br>
<br>
Akashi turns off the television, cutting short Regensburg's off-the-script self-promotion.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
......<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Akashi：</span><br>
That was all wrong, nya! I didn't put any Iron Blood kit in my product lineup, nya!<br>
God dangit, nya... When I told her "ad-libbing is okay," I wasn't expecting her to promote OTHER people's stuff, nya!<br>
But hey, it's fine, nya! I made a mistake, and I've learned from it, nya! Tomorrow's stream won't be like this one, nya!<br>
On that note, I'd better be off, nya. I'm gonna change a couple of things to make the show better, nya!<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
...Again?<br>

It's the time of day Akashi usually shows up, yet she's nowhere to be seen.<br>
Turning on the TV shows that her livestream isn't on, either. Did our stubborn sales-cat finally give up?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Communicator：</span><br>
BEEP BEEP!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Akashi：</span><br>
Heheheh. Starting to miss me, nya?<br>
If you wanna see me, come to Seashore Avenue now, nya! I'm waiting for you here, nya~<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Is she high on catnip? Her voice sure sounded like it.<br>
Now I'm getting worried... I'd better check on her.<br>
<br>
Port - Seashore Avenue<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Akashi：</span><br>
My biggest sale of the year officially starts... now, nya!<br>
There's so much to choose from, from tons of limited-time skins making a comeback, to bundle deals with unbelievable savings, nya!<br>
The more you buy, the bigger the discount, nya~ Better buy now, nya~<br>
But I'm not done yet, nya! Even if all you do is come and window-shop, you'll get a gift bag ABSOLUTELY FREE, nya!<br>
These prices are so low that you'd need a greatsword to slash them more, nya! Any lower would be illegal, really, nya!<br>
<br>
The moment I set foot on Seashore Avenue, I spot Akashi with a microphone in hand – or paw, who knows? – working hard to lure in customers.<br>
She and three other shipgirls are up on a stage packed with products. They strike eye-catching poses and hype the place up.<br>
Next to the sea and the beach, under white clouds and blue skies, the shipgirls holler and hoot on Seashore Avenue.<br>
Akashi has finally found the sales strategy that suits her most.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
First of all, I want to say...<br>
<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项1：Congratulations on the gala.</span>'''''<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项2：Pay up for reserving the venue.</span>'''''<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Akashi：</span><br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项1）</span>'''''I couldn't have done it without you, Commander, nya~<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项1）</span>'''''Here's today's free gift bag, nya. I want you to have it, nya~<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项1）</span>'''''Hehehehe... And while you're here, why not check out my wares and buy something you like, nya?<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项1）</span>'''''Giving out freebies one second and telling you to buy something the next... Yep, that's the Akashi I know.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Akashi：</span><br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项2）</span>'''''NYA?! What are you talking about, nya?! I assumed this place was free for anyone to use, nya!<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项2）</span>'''''...Shiranui! Keep the sales coming in, nya! I've got urgent business I need to attend to, nya!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Shiranui：</span><br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项2）</span>'''''What? Wait...<br>
<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项2）</span>'''''After dumping her microphone in Shiranui's hands, Akashi scurries away in a flash.<br>
