A Study in Takao<br>
<br>
1 One Secretary's Worries<br>
Port - Commander's Office<br>
On one normal work day, my new secretary ship Takao did her work with a markedly furrowed brow.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
(She looks worried. Am I giving her too much work?)<br>
<br>
Apparently noticing my eyes on her, she stopped her work and looked back at me.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Takao：</span><br>
Yes, Commander? Do you need something?<br>
Too much work...? No, not at all. This workload is easy enough for me.<br>
Oh... Did I look that intense?<br>
Apologies, Commander. It's really unrelated to work, I promise.<br>
<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项1：Is something bothering you at all?</span>'''''<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Takao：</span><br>
Well... A little.<br>
But it's nothing you should concern yourself over.<br>
Let's focus on our work first. If you really want to know, then I'll share once we're done.<br>
<br>
With that, she relaxed her frown slightly and immersed herself in work once more.<br>
Around sunset, we finished filing away our documents, marking an end to the day's work.<br>
As promised, Takao revealed the source of her concerns.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Takao：</span><br>
Commander, I've been thinking of self-cultivation.<br>
And... I'd like your help.<br>
<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项1：Me? Helping you train?</span>'''''<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项2：My swordplay isn't exactly masterful...</span>'''''<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Takao：</span><br>
No worries – it isn't related to swordplay. Rest assured of that... if nothing else.<br>
<br>
Takao hesitated for a moment before continuing.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Takao：</span><br>
I was talking with Atago the other day, and she noted some of my... failings.<br>
Self-cultivation is the act of making up for your failings, but swordplay is unrelated in this case.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Okay, then maybe I can help you. What exactly am I supposed to do?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Takao：</span><br>
The help I require will vary based on the cultivation I am to do.<br>
But I promise that I won't waste your time and energy for nothing.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Sounds fun... Okay. Leave it to me.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Takao：</span><br>
Thank you very much, Commander!<br>
Let us meet at the training ground tomorrow morning.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
I'll be there, no matter what.<br>
<br>
Takao smiled at my enthusiastic answer.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
(She still hasn't told me what exactly we're doing, though. I'm a little excited to find out...)<br>

A Study in Takao<br>
<br>
2 Special Cultivation Session<br>
I went to the training ground first thing in the morning.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Takao：</span><br>
Good morning, Commander.<br>
<br>
As soon as I got there, I heard a spirited greeting.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Morning. What are we planning... Hm?<br>
<br>
For some reason, there was a work desk in the middle of the training ground.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Why is there a desk here?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Takao：</span><br>
To help with my self-cultivation, of course.<br>
Commander, wait a moment. I need to make final preparations.<br>
<br>
She finished her final preparations, which seemed to be... neatly placing supplies and documents onto the desk.<br>
My confusion was obvious, so she explained.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Takao：</span><br>
Today, I mean to cultivate meditation... In short, I want to maintain a level of clear-minded calm regardless of external influence.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Meditation, huh? I think that's a good thing to train. How does this desk help, though?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Takao：</span><br>
This desk is for your use, Commander.<br>
As I said before, while I need your help, I don't want to waste your time needlessly. You should do your work here as usual.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Well, thanks. What are you going to do in the meantime?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Takao：</span><br>
I will endeavor to focus and clean the training ground.<br>
Are you ready, Commander?<br>
<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项1：Ready any time.</span>'''''<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项2：Yay, I love desk work! Woohoo!</span>'''''<br>
<br>
I sat down at the desk and began the day's paperwork.<br>
Meanwhile, Takao took her cleaning implements and got to cleaning.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
(She's holding a mop instead of a sword, but she's still just as intimidating.)<br>
(It looks like she's taking this cultivation business seriously.)<br>
Okay... Time for me to fight my own daily battle!<br>

<br>
3 A Minor Setback<br>
With the slow passage of time, the number of documents on my desk gradually decreased.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
(At this rate, I'll be done in no time... Hmm? That's odd.)<br>
<br>
Suddenly, the pressure around me seemed to disappear out of nowhere.<br>
<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项1：(Check on Takao.)</span>'''''<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项2：(Ignore it and keep working.)</span>'''''<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项1）</span>'''''Did she finish her training, maybe?<br>
<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项1）</span>'''''I looked around the training ground and found her swinging a sword at a training dummy in the corner.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项2）</span>'''''Nothing matters more to me than my work. NOTHING.<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项2）</span>'''''If Takao is learning to stay focused regardless of what's happening around her, then I should do the same thing.<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项2）</span>'''''No matter what she does, I'm going to keep my little eyes focused right on my work–<br>
<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项2）</span>'''''*slash!*<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项2）</span>'''''*slash!* *slash!*<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项2）</span>'''''*slash!* *slash!* *slash!*<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项2）</span>'''''...Okay, well, work's not happening. Guess I'll go see what she's doing.<br>
<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项2）</span>'''''I followed the sound to Takao in the corner of the training ground, swinging a sword at a training dummy.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Takao：</span><br>
Commander...?<br>
Oh. D-damn... I haven't finished cleaning yet!<br>
<br>
She sheathed her sword and ran over to pick up the mop and bucket she'd abandoned. But then, she tripped over.<br>
The girl and her cleaning implements alike fell right onto me.<br>
*slash!*<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Takao：</span><br>
Commander! Are you okay?!<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
I'm soaked, but apart from that, I'm fine. What about you?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Takao：</span><br>
Likewise... Argh, even with your help, I still can't do it!<br>
I realize anew that my mind is still far from the peace of undisturbed waters.<br>
I'm sorry, Commander, that you had to see my ineptitude.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
I get it now. This cultivation session is training to help you resist the urge to swing your sword, right?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Takao：</span><br>
You are more or less correct.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
In that case, is there actually any way that I'd be able to help you with that...?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Takao：</span><br>
I was training my cleaning abilities for your sake, but...<br>
<br>
Takao murmured something to herself bashfully.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Takao：</span><br>
Commander, you are that which gives fruit to my cultivation. You help me just by being present.<br>
But my training today has ended in failure due to my own lack of determination. I must apologize again.<br>
<br>
She looked down in frustration.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
(I still can't make heads or tails of it, but it seems awfully important to her. Hmm...)<br>
<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项1：Not yet. It hasn't ended.</span>'''''<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
I want you to keep on training.<br>
It's still early. You can always just keep trying, right?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Takao：</span><br>
Commander... You'd give me more of your time?<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Of course. I accepted your request, so I'm not about to throw in the towel early.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Takao：</span><br>
...You're right. I can't leave my cultivation undone.<br>
I'll get to it right away–<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Hold on a second. First...<br>
<br>

<br>
4 Interim Appraisal<br>
At lunch, Takao asked me to come to the school building's roof.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Takao：</span><br>
Commander, I look forward to our continued training today.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Mind telling me what we're doing first?<br>
<br>
I looked around. It was already plenty clean up here, and she hadn't brought a desk for me this time.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Takao：</span><br>
Today, I will not clean. Of course, like last time, I won't detain you for long.<br>
I simply want you to watch as I train... my ability to see the beauty in nature and experience harmony and balance in the world.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Okay... So you're training your mind again.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Takao：</span><br>
Indeed. If you are prepared, we can begin at once.<br>
<br>
She spread a tablecloth over a bench and took out a bento box.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Takao：</span><br>
I tried to use ingredients that condense the beauty all around us and seasonings that symbolize harmony and balance.<br>
The results of my patient cooking are inside this box... The fruits of my training.<br>
Commander, I want your formal appraisal on my cultivation.<br>
Eat this, please.<br>
<br>
I opened the lid and smelled a rich scent. The fruits of Takao's training were stuffed inside.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
(This dish... Come to think of it, Atago came and asked me my favorite food a few days ago.)<br>
(Wow. I guess that was all for this.)<br>
<br>
Takao and I enjoyed a tasty lunch together.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Takao：</span><br>
How was it, Commander?<br>
<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项1：Delicious!</span>'''''<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项2：Your training is a huge success!</span>'''''<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Takao：</span><br>
Oh...! I'm relieved that you approve.<br>
But this lunch was only the first step of my training.<br>
I'll need you to appraise more of my results beyond this.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Are you going to try cooking something more elaborate?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Takao：</span><br>
Exactly. I'm going to take my training step by step.<br>
Now that I've accomplished a basic lunch, it's only logical that I try something more difficult next.<br>
This is all just to help me appreciate beauty, balance, and harmony, but I hope you'll continue to help.<br>
If possible... I'd like to continue this Sunday...<br>
What do you think?<br>

<br>
5 The Unexpected<br>
On Sunday, I visited her room as promised.<br>
As soon as I opened the door, a lovely aroma wafted forth.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Takao：</span><br>
Take a seat and relax, Commander.<br>
<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项1：Your training seems to be going well.</span>'''''<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Takao：</span><br>
Indeed. I think I'm beginning to understand the beauty of balance and harmony.<br>
Your tea, Commander.<br>
This training has been especially useful for me.<br>
Selection of ingredients, researching cooking methods...<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Honestly, agreed. Cooking is one of the most profound endeavors out there. It's definitely worth learning.<br>
But I do have one question. You were supposed to be learning how to appreciate beauty, harmony, and balance in nature, right?<br>
I've been wondering for a while now... Your intent and your actions seem a little mismatched.<br>
Why not just call it learning to cook?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Takao：</span><br>
A-ahem...<br>
Commander, to know a forest, one must know a tree. Through simple experience, I will learn the greater truths of the world.<br>
For example, salt and sugar represent two polar opposites.<br>
But if you add just the right amount of sugar to a salty dish, it helps bring out the flavor.<br>
Likewise, a touch of salt to accompany sweetness can help accentuate said sweetness.<br>
Does this aspect of cooking not symbolize harmony and balance?<br>
I could liken it to swordplay, too. Every slash, every parry, offense, defense, each individual style and rhythm...<br>
<br>
Just like that, Takao had changed the subject to her beloved swordplay.<br>
The smoke wafting about gave her a different vibe than–<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
(Wait. Smoke?!)<br>
<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项1：Takao!</span>'''''<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项2：Your cooking!</span>'''''<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Takao：</span><br>
Ah... D-damn it, there I go again!<br>
Commander, wait here! I'll go to the kitchen and stop it now!<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
It's too late! I'm coming with you!<br>
<br>
Sometime later...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Takao：</span><br>
This is all that remains intact...<br>
What an awful blunder.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
I'd never would've guessed you were cooking three dishes at once.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Takao：</span><br>
Tch... So this was beyond my skill level.<br>
Here I thought I could entice you by making many of your favorite foods at once...<br>
<br>
Takao murmured something to herself bashfully.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Takao：</span><br>
I am sorry. My cultivation was a failure wrought by my own ambition. I should've known my place.<br>
<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项1：Hold on, Takao.</span>'''''<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
You said it yourself, didn't you? You can't leave cultivation undone once you've begun the process.<br>
You have the ingredients, so make more. I'll help you this time.<br>
I'm supposed to be helping you with your training, and I could use some balance and harmony in my own life, too.<br>
It's a little bit of a selfish request, but what do you say?<br>
If you refuse, I'm happy to leave... Unless?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Takao：</span><br>
I would never!<br>
Hmm... You're right, Commander. Training is best concluded on a high note.<br>
Thank you. I'm happy to accept your aid in this battle!<br>

<br>
6 The True Meaning of Cultivation<br>
After another long day of work, Takao came to my desk with a big smile on her face.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Takao：</span><br>
Commander, I'd like to talk about my next round of training.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Hmm? What's the excuse this time?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Takao：</span><br>
E-excuse...<br>
Commander... Fine. You've seen through me.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Well, not quite, but I knew you were calling that "cultivation" and "training" as an excuse for something else.<br>
A dignified martial artist like you is bound to struggle with white lies, I know.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Takao：</span><br>
...I suppose so. Well, now that you've figured me out, I might as well come clean.<br>
It is true that I prepared my training for the sake of making up for my weaknesses.<br>
But the contents of it... The true goal was different.<br>
What I really wanted... was to improve my feminine prowess.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Uhh... Feminine prowess?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Takao：</span><br>
According to Atago, I tend to be too stern and serious around you. I lack a womanly softness.<br>
In short, my feminine prowess is wanting.<br>
"You can't cook and clean, and you only talk about swords. How are you supposed to get closer to the Commander like that?"<br>
I didn't disagree with her, either. So I asked her to help me plan a course of training.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
That explains why you were cooking and cleaning.<br>
Was getting my help part of her plan, too?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Takao：</span><br>
No, that was my own idea.<br>
Commander, what are you grinning about?<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Oh, nothing. I don't think you lack femininity, though – it's just a unique kind.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Takao：</span><br>
Do you think so?<br>
Then should I not train today?<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Keep training, if you want. Can't leave it undone, remember?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Takao：</span><br>
Oh, right!<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
...By the way, what WERE you going to do today?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Takao：</span><br>
Train my insight. Specifically, to find beautiful moments in this dizzying world.<br>
<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项1：.........</span>'''''<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Dumb it down a little, please?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Takao：</span><br>
Atago said, "Plan a date. Use training as an excuse to invite the Commander out."<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Wow. Yeah, that helped, thanks.<br>
Have you planned said date?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Takao：</span><br>
There is a plan, yes, but... No, never mind.<br>
Commander, will you give your day off tomorrow to me?<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
I'm free all day, actually. Call me, and I'll come running.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Takao：</span><br>
Splendid. Then I'll see you tomorrow, Commander!<br>

A Study in Takao<br>
<br>
7 Our Final Training Session<br>
The next day, Takao told me where to meet up with her.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
I'd expected a movie theater, aquarium, amusement park, or something...<br>
But the training ground, huh? That's very like you.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Takao：</span><br>
Ahem. To be honest, I did consider those places when first devising this plan.<br>
But I thought about what you'd said, and I ruminated over what I'd been doing...<br>
I arrived at the ultimate conclusion that this was the perfect place to train... er, enjoy a date.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
About the part where you're finding beautiful moments, and stuff...<br>
What exactly do you think you need to do?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Takao：</span><br>
You can simply sit here where it's safe and watch.<br>
<br>
She looked down bashfully and walked away.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Watch...?<br>
<br>
Instead of answering my question, she quietly grasped the hilt of her sword.<br>
Its blade sliced through the air. The wind-cutting noise it made was satisfying.<br>
Her eyes held quiet resolve, as if she'd stepped into another world.<br>
As dignified and steady as a mountain, yet as light as a flower, all the while emanating raw power.<br>
Red leaves fell when she swung her sword down. Her poetic performance shook my heart and kept me at the edge of my seat.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Takao：</span><br>
Did you like it, Commander?<br>
<br>
The sound of her sword returning to its sheathe was like a lover's murmur.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Takao：</span><br>
Takao slowly opened her eyes and looked at me. Her lips turned upward into a little smile.<br>
<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项1：It was beautiful!</span>'''''<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项2：You took my breath away!</span>'''''<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Takao：</span><br>
I'm happy that you liked it...<br>
I asked Atago to help me prepare the props for our date, actually...<br>
Fortunately, that was worthwhile.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Do you mean those leaves?<br>
<br>
She nodded and sat down in front of me.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
That aside, what inspired you to do this?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Takao：</span><br>
Yesterday, you told me that I had a unique kind of femininity.<br>
So I planned this date around what I do best.<br>
It is far divorced from my original intention of finding beauty in fleeting moments...<br>
But the fact that we're on this date together does make up for that.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Wrong. You accomplished the goal of your training just fine – but it was I who saw the beauty, not you.<br>
You know... You actually don't have to be all that perceptive to see fleeting moments of beauty, no matter how chaotic the world is.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Takao：</span><br>
Commander, what do you...<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Those moments of beauty are always happening because you're here, Takao.<br>
<br>
It was then that I realized that she was holding my hand.<br>
Her hand, callused from years of sword training, clung tightly to mine.<br>
Then, a soft warmth touched my lips. It came with a gentle fragrance, a palpable reminder that I was with someone dear to me.<br>
