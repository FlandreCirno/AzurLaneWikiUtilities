Midsummer Sagittarius<br>
<br>
Chapter 1 - Regular Ol' Summer?<br>
Port - Beach<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Centaur：</span><br>
So this is the beach that is reserved for the fleet's use...<br>
The vast blue that stretches across the horizon, the comforting warmth of the sand between your toes... what a wonderful place!<br>
Elder Javelin is...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Javelin：</span><br>
Ah, Centaur! Over here~!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Centaur：</span><br>
Good day, Elder Javelin. Thank you for taking time out of your day for me.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Javelin：</span><br>
(Haha! I never expected someone to call me "Elder"~) Good morning!<br>
Don't sweat the small stuff! Commander's been working extra hard to finish everything up before vacation, so I have plenty of time to spare!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Centaur：</span><br>
Yes'm!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Javelin：</span><br>
Why don't I show you around?<br>
The east side of the beach is where the Sakura girls like to gather. Last year, they blew everyone away with the quantity and quality of their swimsuits... but there might be some competition this year~<br>
Look over there - it's Kaga and... huh? Where's Akagi?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Centaur：</span><br>
Um, is that her over there?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Akagi：</span><br>
There are a lot of pests trying to swarm around Commander this year... Ahaha, but I shall not permit that...!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Atago：</span><br>
Oh my, Akagi. Just what could you be talking about? Commander just wanted to enjoy some relaxation with big sister... isn't that right?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Akagi：</span><br>
Aha... ahaha... ahahahahaha! So much filth... I simply must "clean" this beach up...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Atago：</span><br>
Hehe... Cleaning, huh? I'm not half bad at that myself, you know~?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Javelin：</span><br>
See? All the Sakura ships get along with each other so well!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Centaur：</span><br>
Should we really be walking away...?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Javelin：</span><br>
It'll be fine! Probably...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Centaur：</span><br>
I-I see, I am glad that my Elders are full of energy!<br>
And over there... is that Elder Takao?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Javelin：</span><br>
That seems to be... Takao's idea of training. Blindfolded watermelon splitting, she calls it. If she succeeds, everyone gets to enjoy fresh watermelon - two birds with one stone!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Centaur：</span><br>
Strangely ingenious...<br>
Oh, she just landed a clean blow.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Javelin：</span><br>
Way to go, Takao!<br>
Let's also go grab a couple of slices!<br>
Because we have the support of the military, they provide us with all the watermelons we could ever want! There's always plenty of fun to be had!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Centaur：</span><br>
That sounds like a fine arrangement, Elder Javelin.<br>

<br>
Chapter 2 - Summer's Secret Weapon?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Javelin：</span><br>
Ping Hai! Shigure! Are you two also getting watermelon?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ping Hai：</span><br>
Mm... watermelon is delicious.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">{{AF|Shigure}}：</span><br>
Javelin, huh?<br>
Is that the newbie over there?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Javelin：</span><br>
That's right, I'm showing her around!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Centaur：</span><br>
Good day, Elder Shigure, Elder Ping Hai.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">{{AF|Shigure}}：</span><br>
Oh, I like this one already! If you ever need any advice, Shigure's got your back!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ping Hai：</span><br>
Um... I don't remember seeing you at the kung fu school...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Javelin：</span><br>
Haha, don't worry about it~<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Centaur：</span><br>
Elder Shigure's swimsuit... is very distinctive. It gives off a completely different vibe than swimsuits worn by the others...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">{{AF|Shigure}}：</span><br>
You're talking about this? It's a school swimsuit! These are considered legendary where we're from!<br>
And, I'll let you into a little secret... Commander probably has a thing for these!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Javelin：</span><br>
Ehh?! Really?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">{{AF|Shigure}}：</span><br>
Who knows~? I promised Yamashiro that I'd go play with her, so I'm gonna head off. If you're interested in learning more, you know where to find me~<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Javelin：</span><br>
It's a promise, then! Tell me more about it later!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">{{AF|Shigure}}：</span><br>
Sure, sure.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Centaur：</span><br>
I had no idea the Sakura Empire had developed such a powerful secret weapon...!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Javelin：</span><br>
There sure seems to be a lot of mystique behind this "school swimsuit..." Um, Elder Javelin...?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Centaur：</span><br>
I-I'm totally fine! Just talking to myself! Anyway, let's continue the tour!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Javelin：</span><br>
This is where the Royal Navy gathers! When it comes to swimsuits, the Sakura girls might be impressive, but we have nothing to fear as long as we have the invincible Hood!<br>
Look over there - her outfit is as gorgeous as ever!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Centaur：</span><br>
As expected of Elder Hood. Just by sitting there, she gives off the elegance of a Renaissance painting...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Javelin：</span><br>
This year, we have our new contestants from Iris Libre and the Vichya Dominion. And then, you can never count out the eccentric style of the Iron Blood... Mm, there's going to be some fierce battles this summer!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Centaur：</span><br>
Um, Elder Javelin, what kind of "battles..."<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Javelin：</span><br>
...Centaur, listen closely. As your Elder, there's something important I need to teach you!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Centaur：</span><br>
Y-yes?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Javelin：</span><br>
Don't forget this. For a young girl, the summer, the beach, and her swimsuit...<br>
... are a warzone!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Centaur：</span><br>
R-really?!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Javelin：</span><br>
Of course! Getting that perfect beach body, avoiding getting sunburned, coordinating your outfit, bringing out your charms to the fullest! It's a never-ending learning experience!<br>
It's suuuuuper difficult to get everything right!<br>
And the prize on the line is super important too - Commander's attention!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Centaur：</span><br>
I... I see...<br>

<br>
Chapter 3 - The Coast Watcher's Vacation<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Javelin：</span><br>
Too bad I couldn't teach this to you earlier, Centaur. You're really pretty, so it's a darn shame that you aren't also wearing a swimsuit...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Centaur：</span><br>
Indeed... Sincerest apologies, but because I just arrived here, I didn't have time to prepare a swimsuit...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Javelin：</span><br>
Don't sweat it! For now, why don't we sit down over there? I'll teach you just how important these summer battles are!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Centaur：</span><br>
Um... weren't you going to show me around...?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Hammann：</span><br>
Saratogaaaaaaaaaa!!! Stop running and give my soda back!!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Saratoga：</span><br>
Ahahaha! You'll have to catch me if you want me to stop!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Javelin：</span><br>
This is where the Eagle Union sets up camp. Looks like they're not as interested in playing in the water...<br>
But there's one thing you can always bet on - if Saratoga's around, things are going to be real lively!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Centaur：</span><br>
Impressive... Elder Saratoga's reputation precedes her...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Javelin：</span><br>
Well, even I call her "teacher" sometimes, but she looks no different from a little kid like this...<br>
Huh? Who's that over there...?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Centaur：</span><br>
I believe that is Elder Ark Royal. What an elegant swimsuit.<br>
But what is she doing sitting over there...?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ark Royal：</span><br>
Muahahaha! It is I, Ark Royal, who shall ensure that all the destroyers can frolic safely!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Javelin：</span><br>
Well, as you can see... she only looks cool until she opens her mouth...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Centaur：</span><br>
Th-this dedication... Elder Ark Royal is so cool...!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Javelin：</span><br>
Ahaha... I suppose so, if you ignore the creepy laughs that sometimes leak out.<br>
In the end, everyone knows that she's a good person who cares the most about protecting our destroyers.<br>
Unfortunately she often ends up scaring them away when she gets a bit too "passionate."<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ark Royal：</span><br>
Nothing says summer like the sun, the beach, and destroyers! Summer is the best!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Centaur：</span><br>
Elder Ark Royal! Good day!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ark Royal：</span><br>
*cough* Ahem! Centaur?! Javelin as well? I don't usually see the two of you together.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Javelin：</span><br>
I'm currently showing Centaur around!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ark Royal：</span><br>
Ohh... Javelin, your swimsuit is... so very nice!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Javelin：</span><br>
Ehehe, thank you~♪<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ark Royal：</span><br>
How about you, Centaur? Not going to wear a swimsuit, even though you're at the beach?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Centaur：</span><br>
Um, I just arrived recently, so I didn't have time to get one...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ark Royal：</span><br>
I see... It would be a shame to not show off your beauty.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Javelin：</span><br>
Right? That's what I said too!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ark Royal：</span><br>
*gasp*! I'm getting carried away. I'd love to chat more, but I can't afford to take my eyes off the destroyers! Sorry!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Javelin：</span><br>
All righty, we'll be heading off then!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Centaur：</span><br>
Keep up the good work, Elder Ark Royal.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Javelin：</span><br>
Centaur, you sure are innocent...<br>

Chapter 4 - Beachside Sweets<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Javelin：</span><br>
Ah, the girls from Iris Libre and Vichya Dominion are over here!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Centaur：</span><br>
Elder Rodney appears to be here as well.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Javelin：</span><br>
Huh? Really?<br>
Rodney! Dunkerque! Émile! Over here!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Dunkerque：</span><br>
You must be... Ah, the one who recently joined the fleet, Centaur.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Centaur：</span><br>
Yes! Elder Dunkerque, Elder Émile Bertin, and finally, Elder Rodney, it is a pleasure to meet you all.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Émile Bertin：</span><br>
Hello, Centaur. Just Émile is fine~<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Dunkerque：</span><br>
Hehe, nice to meet you.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Rodney：</span><br>
Good day. I met these two along the way, so I came with them here.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Dunkerque：</span><br>
I'm sorry, Javelin. I wasn't able to convince Jean Bart to come after all. But I'll make sure she'll be here tonight.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Javelin：</span><br>
Thanks a ton, Dunkerque!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Centaur：</span><br>
Excuse me... is something happening at night?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Javelin：</span><br>
Hehe, that's when the real fun begins! It has something to do with you, so make sure to be there!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Centaur：</span><br>
If that's the case, I'll be looking forward to it.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Dunkerque：</span><br>
More importantly, I made sweets for all of you. Want to try?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Javelin：</span><br>
Centaur, Dunkerque is famous around here for making super delicious sweets!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Rodney：</span><br>
I've heard the same from my sister. Something about there being a world-class patissier from the Vichya Dominion.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Dunkerque：</span><br>
Non, you're making me sound cooler than I am... Here, I just enjoy making sweets~<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Centaur：</span><br>
It's... amazing!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Javelin：</span><br>
Right~? I'd love to dig in, but... I don't have the courage to look at the scales afterwards...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Rodney：</span><br>
Same... These are absolutely delicious, but I'll have to hold back since I need to head to beach volleyball practice soon.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Dunkerque：</span><br>
Ah, don't worry! Just let me know and I'll be glad to make more.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Émile Bertin：</span><br>
Dunkerque, why'd you decide to bring sweets to the beach though...?<br>
They're as delicious as ever, but, considering how hot it is, wouldn't it be better to pack a lunchbox like Javelin did?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Dunkerque：</span><br>
Then, should I rent a minifridge and make ice cream next time?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Émile Bertin：</span><br>
I wonder if you'll ever decide to bring something other than sweets...<br>
Ah, but ice cream is a great idea, so I'm all for it!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Centaur：</span><br>
It behooves a hot summer day.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Javelin：</span><br>
Um, but the calories...<br>
Ah, forget it... I want some ice cream too!<br>

Chapter 5 - The Iron Blood Front<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Centaur：</span><br>
Elder Javelin, the Elders from the Iron Blood have arrived.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Javelin：</span><br>
Oh, you're right!<br>
They're all dressed up in swimsuits as well!<br>
Last year, Eugen was the only one who wore a swimsuit...<br>
Heeey! Over here~!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Centaur：</span><br>
Elder Z25, Elder Z46, it is a pleasure to meet you both.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Z25：</span><br>
Hwuh? P-p-pleased to meet you...<br>
Miss Dunkerque, may we please join you?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Z46：</span><br>
What reason is there... to call me "Elder..."<br>
But I also crave the delicious sweetness.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Dunkerque：</span><br>
Of course. Here, there's plenty for you both.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Javelin：</span><br>
You're so nice, Dunkerque~<br>
Zweifü, Viersechs, you can have some of my food as well!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Tirpitz：</span><br>
Looks like the party already started without us.<br>
Graf, did you want to join in as well?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Graf Zeppelin：</span><br>
Do I look like the type that enjoys group activities?<br>
I only came because Commander told me to wait here. Nothing more.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Tirpitz：</span><br>
Sure. But since Dunkerque went through all the trouble of making these sweets, it would be rude of us not to try some.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Graf Zeppelin：</span><br>
Fine... Mmf!! What is this exquisite sweetness...!<br>
I understand... this is why she has such a reputation. I'm a believer now.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Centaur：</span><br>
Elder Tirpitz and Elder Graf Zeppelin from the Iron Blood, pleased to meet you.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Tirpitz：</span><br>
So you're the carrier who's gained quite the notoriety for calling everyone your "Elder..."<br>
Not a bad ring to it though... I don't mind. Pleased to meet you.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Graf Zeppelin：</span><br>
Elder...? I suppose it's suitable enough...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Centaur：</span><br>
(whispers) Elder Javelin, these two Elders seem to be very nice people.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Javelin：</span><br>
(whispers) That's right... They may seem hard to approach at first, but they're actually very nice.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Z25：</span><br>
Um... Come to think of it, where's Deutschland?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Tirpitz：</span><br>
Eugen seems to have planted some strange ideas in her head. She's been going on and on about "the optimal method of seducing Commander with a swimsuit" and ran off to find Eugen as soon as she arrived at the beach.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Z25：</span><br>
*sigh*...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Tirpitz：</span><br>
Well, at least Eugen managed to find some way to keep her busy. We should thank her for that.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Émile Bertin：</span><br>
I was thinking... since there are so many of us here, why don't we come up with a game to play together?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Tirpitz：</span><br>
How about some beach volleyball?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Javelin：</span><br>
Tirpitz, are you actually the sporty type?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Tirpitz：</span><br>
Don't get any strange ideas about me...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Javelin：</span><br>
No, no! I just thought that was a great idea since we had all these sweets to eat! Let's all play some volleyball~!<br>

Chapter 6 - In the Evening's Glow<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Centaur：</span><br>
What a beautiful sunset...<br>
More and more people turned up to the beach volleyball game and it turned into a big tournament...<br>
What an interesting day it has been.<br>
For all my Elders who have been through so much war to be able to relax like this...<br>
No, it is because they have endured so much that they are fully able to cherish times of peace.<br>
For someone like me, who was born into an era of peace, there is much that I can learn from the experiences of my Elders... I truly am glad that I was able to join this fleet...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Javelin：</span><br>
Centaur~!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Centaur：</span><br>
Elder Javelin! What's the matter?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Javelin：</span><br>
I was looking for you! Were you watching the sunset?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Centaur：</span><br>
Indeed! I was just reflecting upon various things...<br>
Today was an extremely educating day for me.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Javelin：</span><br>
Really? I thought it was just a day like any other.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Centaur：</span><br>
Nay - today, I caught a glimpse of how my Elders live their lives when not in the heat of battle. That is already a valuable lesson.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Javelin：</span><br>
I dunno... I don't think anyone was really thinking hard about how to spend their time off. Sometimes, we just want to kick back and have some fun! I'm the same way!<br>
More importantly, it's too early to look back at all the stuff that happened today, because the day isn't over yet!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Centaur：</span><br>
That's true, but... the beach volleyball tournament already ended, and everyone is packing their stuff and getting ready to leave...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Javelin：</span><br>
Don't worry, just get ready for the nighttime activities!<br>
Just look over there!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Centaur：</span><br>
Everyone seems to be carrying some boxes over... what are those?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Javelin：</span><br>
Ehehe, tada~! Tonight's main event - the fireworks show!<br>
We'd like to formally welcome all our new friends from Iris Libre and the Vichya Dominion as well as Centaur to the fleet!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Centaur：</span><br>
So this is what you told me to look forward to earlier!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Javelin：</span><br>
That's right! Look, even Jean Bart came, just as Dunkerque promised!<br>
Let's not stand around here though, everyone's waiting for us!<br>
The fun's only just getting started!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Centaur：</span><br>
It's too soon to look back, huh...<br>
Yup! Now, let's play the night away!<br>
