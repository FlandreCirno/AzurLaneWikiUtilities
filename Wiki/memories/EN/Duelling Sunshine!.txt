1 Bright and Bubbly<br>
Port—Office<br>
Today, the new secretary ship is supposed to stop by.<br>
If I remember correctly, she should be...<br>
<span style="color:#92fc63;">Hornet：</span><br>
Yo, Commander, were you waiting for me? I'll be in charge of secretarial duties starting today!<br>
Oh shoot... Should I have knocked first?<br>
<br>
I was a bit surprised by this greeting, but I shrugged it off and told her it was fine.<br>
<span style="color:#92fc63;">Hornet：</span><br>
Hahaha, I've already learned how to do a secretary's duties, so feel free to rely on me for just about everything~!<br>
<br>
...Just as she said, Hornet went about doing tasks with just as much vigor as her greeting from earlier.<br>
Even when she came across something she wasn't familiar with, once I taught her, she got it pretty quickly.<br>
At this rate, we should be done with today's work in no time.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Hornet：</span><br>
Haha, here's some mail! Commander, catch!<br>
<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项1：?!</span>'''''<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项2：Caught it!</span>'''''<br>
<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项1）</span>'''''She didn't even wait for my response, a piece of paper soon flying across the room and landing on the floor.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Hornet：</span><br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项1）</span>'''''Ah... Sorry, sorry. I thought you'd be able to catch it no problem.<br>
<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项1）</span>'''''Picking up the letter, she calmly handed it to me.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Hornet：</span><br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项2）</span>'''''Nice!<br>
<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项2）</span>'''''Seeing me catch the letter she tossed at me, she gave me a thumbs up with a smile.<br>
<span style="color:#92fc63;">Hornet：</span><br>
Whew... And that's a wrap to my first day as a secretary! Cheers, Commander~!<br>
<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项1："You certainly lived up to your reputation as a Yorktown-class ship!"</span>'''''<br>
<span style="color:#92fc63;">Hornet：</span><br>
I'm the youngest member of the Yorktown-class. I can't sully their honor, you know, hahaha~♪<br>

2 Silent Friend<br>
Port—Office<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Hornet：</span><br>
Northampton, it's your turn, you know!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Northampton：</span><br>
Yeah, I'm just thinking about what to do next...<br>
<br>
Hornet and Northampton were playing a board game in the office.<br>
How did this happen, you ask...?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Hornet：</span><br>
By the way Commander, since we're just about done with work, want to play a game together?<br>
I happened to invite my friend who's a bit quiet, but reliable~<br>
Commander...? Anyone there? Stop zoning out, it's your turn!<br>
<br>
There was Hornet, who had been lively since starting the game, and Northampton, who was deep in thought without letting out as much as a single peep.<br>
After thinking for a moment, I skipped my turn.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Hornet：</span><br>
Hehe~ So you thought pretty hard, didn't you. Well, then it's my turn! Let me move this here... and this piece over there... Done~!<br>
Oh, I'm feeling a bit thirsty... I guess I'll go buy some drinks.<br>
Northampton, you'll be having the usual right? What about you, Commander?<br>
...Roger! I'll be back in a bit!<br>
<br>
The moment Hornet left, silence fell over the office.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Northampton：</span><br>
...<br>
Um...<br>
<br>
The one that broke the silence was Hornet's silent friend.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Northampton：</span><br>
When Hornet said that you were going to show up, I thought it was a joke...<br>
Hornet's currently on duty as the secretary ship, right...? Is she causing any trouble for you?<br>
<br>
I told her how Hornet was handling her job at the office.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Northampton：</span><br>
I see. I wonder if I was worrying over nothing.<br>
<br>
Since she was here, I figured I'd ask Hornet's best friend, Northampton, about a few things.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Northampton：</span><br>
Hornet is a bright and free soul. I don't know how accurate it is, but my mental image of her is that of a cowboy.<br>
But I wonder if she's really fine. Isn't she concerned with her place among her sisters? ...I don't really know how to phrase this properly, but it might be related to her pride, or be some kind of complex...<br>
<br>
Speaking of sisters... she did talk about not wanting to sully their honor.<br>
I should ask what the person in question thinks when I have the chance.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Hornet：</span><br>
I'm back! Pretty quick, wasn't I~?<br>
Here, have a sip~ and then it's right back to the game!<br>

3 The Topic of Sisters<br>
Port—Office<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Hornet：</span><br>
Once we finish putting this together, we'll be done... Mm~<br>
Commander, I'm done on this side! How are you doing?<br>
<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项1：I just finished myself.</span>'''''<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Hornet：</span><br>
Yay~ Another day's work, completed!<br>
Hmm... but it's a bit early to be excited... and it's no good for a secretary ship to be wandering about outside on a weekday... I wonder what I should do...<br>
Commander, would you like to chat for a bit? How about our interests? That should make working together a lot easier.<br>
<br>
She wants to chat, huh... What should we talk about...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Hornet：</span><br>
Then, how about talking about my distinguished sisters in the Yorktown class?<br>
Don't worry, I get it. I know that you've been pretty interested in Yorktown and Enty.<br>
<br>
...I'd be lying if I denied it...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Hornet：</span><br>
Hehe, I hit the bullseye, didn't I~<br>
Hehehe, there's no need to be embarrassed. It's understandable to be taken in by my sisters.<br>
So, which one are you interested in the most, Commander? As the youngest sister, I'm willing to provide you with some special insider info~<br>
<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项1："Yorktown"</span>'''''<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项2："Enterprise"</span>'''''<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项3："Hornet"</span>'''''<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Hornet：</span><br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项1）</span>'''''Yorktown, huh... She's the gentlest one out of us all.<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项1）</span>'''''But from time to time, she has a pained expression... and even I'm not sure of the reason why...<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项1）</span>'''''Commander, I hope you're able to make her smi... err, happy!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Hornet：</span><br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项2）</span>'''''Going after Enty... You've got discerning eyes, Commander.<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项2）</span>'''''Having an aura that radiates strength, but not haughty. Always willing to do her best, and respected not only by the other ships in the Union but also by her rivals...<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项2）</span>'''''Well, she does push herself too hard at times... Do something about that side of her first, and then we can talk!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Hornet：</span><br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项3）</span>'''''Hornet, huh... Let's see...<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项3）</span>'''''Wait a second, Hornet? You're talking about me!<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项3）</span>'''''Heh~♪ Unfortunately for you, information about the great Hornet is off limits~<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Hornet：</span><br>
Ehehe, is there anything else you were curious about? I'm willing to talk about anything I know about.<br>
<br>
"I'm curious how you feel about your sisters."<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Hornet：</span><br>
Well, they're my dear sisters who I respect, but from time to time, I do get jealous of them.<br>
Especially since Enty is unbelievably famous, and I've become famous by association.<br>
I get called "Enterprise's sister" a lot... It sure is hard having a sister that famous, you know.<br>
<br>
For just a moment, I was able to see the discontent that lay underneath her normally bubbly exterior.<br>

4 The Appearance of a Rival?!<br>
Port—Office<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Hornet：</span><br>
Commander, it's terrible!<br>
<br>
Huh...?!<br>
A flustered Hornet came flying into the office.<br>
<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项1：What's wrong?</span>'''''<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Hornet：</span><br>
Gasp... You see...<br>
The Commander and I are both on extended vacation, and I'm not scheduled to participate in any practice exercises! Hehehe, that means it's time to play to my heart's content~!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Zuikaku：</span><br>
Hey, the Union ship over there! If I remember correctly, you're Enterprise's sister... the Yorktown class's... Hornet! <br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Hornet：</span><br>
Yes? You're... the Sakura Empire's Zuikaku?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Zuikaku：</span><br>
Perfect timing! Do you know where that "Grey Ghost"... basically, I was looking for your sister. Do you know where she is?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Hornet：</span><br>
Oh, Enterprise should be out on an emergency commission. She'll be back tomorrow night.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Zuikaku：</span><br>
Is that so... We were planning on having a bout today... I guess it'll have to wait for next time...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Hornet：</span><br>
Hehe, if you're looking for a practice partner, I'm here, you know? I'm free for the next few days anyway, I don't mind sparring with you!<br>
Is what I said in the heat of the moment... but I didn't think she would actually take me up on the offer.<br>
<br>
It seems that she's due for a 1-on-1 exercise... and she wants to know if there's a practice area that's free to use.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Hornet：</span><br>
That's part of it, but, what's more important is that...<br>
<br>
Are you worried... that you might lose?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Hornet：</span><br>
No! There's nothing bad about losing during practice, and I'm usually not one who cares about winning or losing anyway...<br>
And I've always wanted to take on the Sakura Empire's Zuikaku as well...<br>
But even so! I'm going in place of Enterprise.<br>
If I were to lose... nothing good would come from that...<br>
So, Commander! Please give me some advice for how to win!<br>
<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项1："I see, sure."</span>'''''<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项2："And what about Zuikaku..?"</span>'''''<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Hornet：</span><br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项1）</span>'''''Ehehe, I knew you'd be up to help me!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Hornet：</span><br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项2）</span>'''''I'm closer to you since I'm currently the secretary ship, so I'm first in line! Please, Commander!<br>

5 Enty's Sister<br>
Port—Office, Nighttime<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Enterprise：</span><br>
I see... Hornet is set to spar with Zuikaku in my place.<br>
Well, it's not exactly in my place. We both fight differently, and if Zuikaku didn't accept her on her own merits, she wouldn't be sparring with her in the first place.<br>
But even so, Hornet's worrying to that degree... Hm...<br>
Yeah, I know. Leave the training to me.<br>
<br>
Practice Area—Noon, the Following Day<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Hornet：</span><br>
E-Enty?! Weren't you supposed to come back tonight?!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Enterprise：</span><br>
I hurried back as soon as I heard you were sparring with Zuikaku.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Hornet：</span><br>
Even if you hurried back, I can't believe you'd be back half a day early... You're amazing as always, Enty...<br>
Oh. If you're back, you should spar with Zuikaku yourself—<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Enterprise：</span><br>
No. You're the one who's supposed to be sparring with her today. And since she's accepted your invitation, it'd be rude to change at the last minute.<br>
And since I rushed back here, I'd like to rest for a bit as well, haha.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Hornet：</span><br>
Enty...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Enterprise：</span><br>
The Commander's advice to you was "special training." Well, let's get on with it then.<br>
Zuikaku's the type who won't take any opponent lightly. Unless you focus, you're going to be tuckered out for the rest of your vacation.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Hornet：</span><br>
...Got it, Enty!<br>
Whew, it's already this late...<br>
Zuikaku might be strong, but you're probably so much stronger! With these measures under my belt, tomorrow should be a piece of cake.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Enterprise：</span><br>
You shouldn't underestimate your opponent. She's probably preparing for the bout tomorrow just as you are right now.<br>
You might start off strong with these measures, but you'll need to adapt to the battle with your own strength to close it out.<br>
That should be it for now. I'll be in the dormitory, waiting to hear good news from you.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Hornet：</span><br>
Yeah! Make sure to get some rest!<br>
<br>
After seeing Enterprise off, Hornet stared off into the horizon.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Hornet：</span><br>
Sigh... I went through so much special training today. I just hope it sticks...<br>
In the end, I had to rely on Enty...<br>
<br>
With a bitter smile on her face, Hornet lowered her head and pulled her hat down to hide her face.<br>
And, as if she remembered something, she raised her head and turned to look behind her.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Hornet：</span><br>
The reason Enty came back early has to be because I talked to the Commander about my bout with Zuikaku, right?<br>
I wonder what the special training the Commander had in mind was...<br>
<br>
She looked as if she was thinking that in the end, she was only Enterprise's replacement.<br>
It was an expression I was seeing for the first time since having come to know her.<br>
My advice for Hornet, who was troubled by the weight of being called Enterprise's sister, was...<br>
It looked as if there was nothing to do but to tell her directly.<br>

6 Be Yourself<br>
Next day at the Practice Area <br>
The practice area at the port. After a few exercises, Hornet and Zuikaku stood there, waiting.<br>
And soon, the signal flare signifying the start of the match was shot up.<br>
Immediately, the two began to move. The practice had started.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Hornet：</span><br>
Haa... Haa... She really is a tough cookie to beat...!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Zuikaku：</span><br>
Looks like you've got a grasp of the things Enterprise has taught you. It seems you've trained hard for this tday!<br>
But, the same goes for me! I've trained hard so that I can beat you, and the Grey Ghost herself!<br>
<br>
Just as Enterprise had predicted, Hornet had the upper hand early on, but as Zuikaku adapted to the battle, Hornet was slowly being driven into a corner.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Zuikaku：</span><br>
Did you really think you could beat me by just copying Enterprise's fighting style?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Hornet：</span><br>
Hmph... If you think I'm just copying Enty, you're sorely mistaken...!<br>
Of course there are parts I've copied, trying to catch up to her...<br>
But I'm not just copying her while following in her footsteps! I'm my own person! I'm the youngest of the Yorktown-class, the dashing, brilliant Hornet!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Zuikaku：</span><br>
...That's the spirit! Now, show me what you're made of!<br>
<br>
After deploying her main air force, Hornet sped directly toward Zuikaku.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Zuikaku：</span><br>
No matter how many times you try the same trick, you won't succeed!<br>
<br>
Lightning. Dodging Zuikaku's attack by a hair's breadth, Hornet instantly changed her stance and slipped into Zuikaku's reach...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Zuikaku：</span><br>
Wh...at?!<br>
<br>
Wow!!<br>
Hornet, who managed to score a direct hit on Zuikaku, ended the practice just like that.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Hornet：</span><br>
Ahaha~ I did it! What a success!<br>
"Pretend to copy Enty's tricks, and then mix things up."<br>
That's why you had me train with Enty...<br>
It just might work on her, seeing how obsessed she is with my sister...<br>
I see... You didn't have Enty train me just because I was her sister...<br>
"Copying your sister isn't bad, but don't just copy her. Use her power as a basis for your own skills and show off your own strength."<br>
I see.. You should've told me earlier! Even if you're the type to speak in a roundabout way like that, I'm not!<br>
I might have been a bit down earlier, but pretend you didn't see anything! You didn't, right? Ugh... This is so embarrassing!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Zuikaku：</span><br>
Pretending to use Enterprise's tricks to fool me... I guess I lost because I was too focused on them.<br>
You got me good. You got the best of me with that move.<br>
But this isn't the end! I won't fall for such a trick twice!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Hornet：</span><br>
Really now~ Maybe when you can distinguish between my original moves and my sister's...!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Zuikaku：</span><br>
What did you say?!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Hornet：</span><br>
That's a fighting style that only I have the privilege of being able to pull off, as Enty's sister. Hehehe~ Isn't that neat?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Zuikaku：</span><br>
Then, until we can fight with our strength instead of relying on tricks! Now, come at me, Hornet!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Hornet：</span><br>
Yep, just what I wanted!<br>
<br>
Hornet and Zuikaku continued to spar...<br>

The day after Hornet and Zuikaku's bout...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Hornet：</span><br>
Commander! You're free, right? Let's go on a date!<br>
<br>
Huh?!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Hornet：</span><br>
Oh, I was being a bit too loud, sorry...<br>
Don't you see that I've got two movie tickets in my hand? Let's get going! We weren't able to hang out yesterday, so we're going for double today!<br>
You can take this as me blackmailing you to keep your mouth shut, or as a display of gratitude. Of course, you can just consider this hanging out as well... Regardless of the reason, let's get going!<br>
Hurry, hurry! The movie's going to start! Oh, can't forget about the 3D glasses!<br>
<br>
I thought Hornet would get all worked up at the climax scene, but...<br>
She was fully absorbed in movie.<br>
If anything, I was the one getting worked up, unable to ignore the feeling of her hand in mine...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Hornet：</span><br>
The best parts of Westerns are the riding scenes and the shootouts~<br>
Heehee~ Are you turning red just from holding hands?<br>
Well then, let's head to the next place on our list~!<br>
<br>
And just like that, Hornet dragged me along to all the other stores in the mall.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Hornet：</span><br>
Whew... that was so fun! I feel like I had all the fun in the world~ The cowboy experience corner was especially good...<br>
Commander, are you tired? Let's take a break then!<br>
<br>
Taking my hand, Hornet and I sat down at a bench.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Hornet：</span><br>
Ehem, is this one of those... special confiding events where my affection points go up?<br>
Hmm... Is there anything I haven't confided in you about... Northampton and Enty have taught me a lot, and thanks to yesterday's practice, my head's a lot clearer and I'm feeling a lot better.<br>
Speaking of which. Did you see Northampton cheering for me with a loud voice? I was really surprised, though I wasn't really able to make out what she was saying because of how far away she was, ahaha...<br>
And, about my sister...<br>
"Copying your sister isn't bad, but don't just copy her. Use her power as a basis for your own skills and show off your own strength." <br>
That was nicely said, but I wanted to add one thing. ...There are times when I don't want to rely on my sisters' powers, don't want to copy their tricks, and just want to fight with what I have.<br>
For example... Like, I'm not as much of a trouble to deal with as my sisters are. I speak the truth about what I like and what I don't like.<br>
So, this is my fighting style. I'll say it loud and clear. Commander, I love you!<br>
...Commander, how do you feel?<br>
