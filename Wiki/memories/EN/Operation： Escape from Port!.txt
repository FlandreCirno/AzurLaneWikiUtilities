Escape from the Port?<br>
<br>
Chapter 1 - Where Are We?<br>
Once upon a time, there were several brave little heroes of steel. This is their Epic...<br>
Port - Warehouse<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">???：</span><br>
That's why I'm telling you, we were kidnapped for sure!<br>
Hmph...! That dumb "commander" must have taken advantage of me when I wasn't paying attention! Unforgivable! I'll have to prepare some punishment!<br>
You think so too, right? Hiei!<br>
R-really...? C-Commander kidnapped us...? But why...?<br>
Zeppy, you've never even seen the commander's face, have you...?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Zeppy：</span><br>
That doesn't matter! What kind of perps show their face to the victims anyway?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Hiei-chan：</span><br>
Uhh... I thought we were summoned to lend aid to Commander, so how did this end up happening...<br>
But, I was supposed to be meant for a much more accomplished person... Ahh!<br>
Could it be that Commander kidnapped us to keep us on base?!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Zeppy：</span><br>
Hm, hmm... I didn't think of that possibility...! Excellent! You finally understand the situation that we're in!<br>
So that's the gist of things! Let's get out of here and return to the Iron Blood! Hiei, you're welcome to come with us!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Hiei-chan：</span><br>
But I'm from the Sakura Empire...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Zeppy：</span><br>
... Formalities, formalities! The most important thing right now is to escape from port! Let's get moving!<br>
If what the weird cat ship said is true, we only need to go straight from here, and we'll be out on the open sea!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Hiei-chan：</span><br>
Zeppy... don't leave me here!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Zeppy：</span><br>
Hmph! Now, you shall all bear witness to the might of the Iron Blood's first carrier, Graf Zepp... Owww!<br>
What the heck! That wall just came out of nowhere and punched me! That stupid cat was trying to trick me all along...!!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Hiei-chan：</span><br>
Zeppy! Are you okay?<br>
... Looks like it will take a while to find our way...<br>

Escape from the Port?<br>
<br>
Chapter 2 - Spy Operation!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Zeppy：</span><br>
There's a shadow around this corner... Taste my- urrrkk!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Hiei-chan：</span><br>
Zeppy, stop! You can't use your rigging to beat people up!<br>
Jeez... if you knocked them out, then we wouldn't be able to ask for directions!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Zeppy：</span><br>
Ahem! You do have a point. Let's have them show us the way out.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Hiei-chan：</span><br>
That won't work either!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Zeppy：</span><br>
Huh...?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Hiei-chan：</span><br>
My pride as an "imperial" ship will not allow it! Zeppy, if you also represent the pride of the Iron Blood, then there's no way you could drag such a small destroyer into this!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Zeppy：</span><br>
O-ohh... Then, what should we do? How do you think we should get out of here?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Hiei-chan：</span><br>
Let's follow her quietly, and take note of our path... In other words, this is going to be a spy operation!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Zeppy：</span><br>
So that's how it goes... I understand. I'll show you that I'm sneakier than a U-boat...!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Hiei-chan：</span><br>
H-Hiei... won't lose either!<br>
<br>
(Approximately one hour later...)<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Hiei-chan：</span><br>
Haaah... haaah...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Zeppy：</span><br>
So tired... can't move my legs...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Hiei-chan：</span><br>
Zeppy, we lost sight of them so many times... or should I say, you got curious and wandered off to look at other things?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Zeppy：</span><br>
There was shiny stuff everywhere so I couldn't help it, okay! Besides, I practically had to pull you out of the kitchen!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Hiei-chan：</span><br>
Aww... A-anyways, did you figure out which way it is to the sea? I'm still all confused...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Zeppy：</span><br>
Heh. Heheheh... The answer should be obvious...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Both：</span><br>
What do we do...?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">???：</span><br>
Do you require assistance?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Both：</span><br>
You... you're...?!<br>

Escape from the Port?<br>
<br>
Chapter 3 - An Angel's Aid?!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Little Bel：</span><br>
Good day. I am the Edinburg-class light cruiser and maid-in-training, Belfast. <br>
But everyone calls me Bel, or Little Bel.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Hiei-chan：</span><br>
P-pleased to meet you. I am Hiei, a battlecruiser of the Sakura Empire.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Zeppy：</span><br>
You gaze upon the first aircraft carrier of the Iron Blood, Graf Zeppelin!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Everyone：</span><br>
..................................<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Little Bel：</span><br>
Um, do you require assistance?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Zeppy：</span><br>
We were kidnapped by the commander, and want to find out how to escape from here!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Little Bel：</span><br>
Kid... napped? Did Master also summon you two here, just like me?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Hiei-chan：</span><br>
That's hard to say... but in any case, we'd like to see the ocean. Could you show us the way?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Little Bel：</span><br>
Understood! Allow me to guide you.<br>
This is the academy. Right now, classes are in session, so everyone is in class.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Königsberg：</span><br>
Heyyo, if it isn't Little Bel! Are those your friends behind you?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Hiei-chan：</span><br>
Y-yes!<br>
(Everyone attending classes together... how peaceful...)<br>
(Huh...? Where is Zeppy rushing off to?)<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Little Bel：</span><br>
If we keep going straight here, we'll see the Sakura shrine. People go there to pray during the New Year.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ayanami：</span><br>
Good morning. Are you here to sit in on the lecture?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Javelin：</span><br>
Ohhh! Keep up the good work, Little Bel! You're the best tour guide!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Laffey：</span><br>
*sniff* *sniff*... smells like Hiei...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Z23：</span><br>
Didn't you just run into her in the kitchen? Surely you must be mistaken. Let's go, shall we?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Zeppy：</span><br>
(Are all the people here "friends?" ... and there are even people from the Iron Blood here... I wonder if I can also...)<br>
(Huh? Hiei is shaking... why?)<br>
Ahhh, I'm beat...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Hiei-chan：</span><br>
We just followed the same route as before and went in a big circle...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Little Bel：</span><br>
Hmm? Didn't your port visit start at the docks?<br>

Escape from the Port?<br>
<br>
Chapter 4 - Final Destination!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Little Bel：</span><br>
And here is the pier. Everyone gathers here before going on sortie or commission.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Hiei-chan：</span><br>
This is.. the pier...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Zeppy：</span><br>
A-ahem! Yes, you, Little Bel or whatever! Thank you!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Little Bel：</span><br>
If you have any other requests, please call upon me at any time. *curtsies*<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Hiei-chan：</span><br>
Ah... um, Little Bel?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Little Bel：</span><br>
Yes, can I help you?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Zeppy：</span><br>
It looks like you're the same as us. Your body is quite small compared to your rigging.<br>
Perhaps you were also kidnapped by the commander...<br>
Let us disappear from this place and sail the azur waves together!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Little Bel：</span><br>
Of course. If necessary, I have no objections to sailing with you. However...<br>
My master is here. As well as Her Majesty, and my sisters. This is the place where I belong.<br>
Above all, I am very happy to be here with everyone.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Hiei-chan：</span><br>
Little Bel...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Zeppy：</span><br>
Wh-what...!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Little Bel：</span><br>
But will you two be all right? Miss Zeppy, Miss Hiei, you two seemed to have a hard time with the directions.<br>
Would you be able to navigate your way home?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Zeppy：</span><br>
Erm...<br>
<br>
Phew...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Akagi：</span><br>
So that's the situation, huh.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Graf Zeppelin：</span><br>
Hmph. What a bunch of troublemakers.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Hiei：</span><br>
There's no need for that. After all, it's finally time for the adults to make their debut.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Akashi：</span><br>
That's right, nya! I couldn't find them by myself, nya!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Zeppy & Hiei-chan：</span><br>
Those people are...?!<br>

<br>
Escape from the Port?<br>
<br>
Chapter 5 - Mission Failed...?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Graf Zeppelin：</span><br>
In other words, your high-energy laser experiment went awry, and accidentally created these kids?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Hiei：</span><br>
Even though they share the same "history" as us, humanity's will often takes on different forms...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Akagi：</span><br>
In other words, they are us, but in a younger state?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Akashi：</span><br>
That is the best way to understand things, nya... It seems that Hiei-chan and Zeppy only have a portion of their "history," nya...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Belfast：</span><br>
So Little Bel is just like them...<br>
Because they were not aware of their purpose, they only could assume that they were "kidnapped."<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Zeppy：</span><br>
So I was the one who was wrong... I hate... being so immature...!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Hiei-chan：</span><br>
What's going to happen to us now...?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Akashi：</span><br>
That's right! What are we going to do with these kids, nya?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Hiei：</span><br>
The Sakura Fleet would be more than glad to take care of Hiei-chan. I'm sure Mikasa will be overjoyed.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Graf Zeppelin：</span><br>
Leave this one to me, then. Although our personalities are different, she's still me after all, so I won't treat her poorly.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Akagi：</span><br>
I guess that's settled then. Akashi, isn't it time you sealed away that strange device? If something like this ever happens again... surely you are aware of the consequences?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Akashi：</span><br>
G-got it, nya! I'm sorry, nya!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Little Bel：</span><br>
Zeppy, Hiei-chan! I'm so relieved!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Hiei-chan：</span><br>
A grown up version of me... I'm sure she's even more amazing at cooking...<br>
Zep...py?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Zeppy：</span><br>
Impossible... Even though I'm supposed to be the first carrier of the Iron Blood... there are actually two...?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Belfast：</span><br>
Well then, everyone, let's show our new friends to the dorms. Little Bel, please tell Commander that the three of you have arrived safely.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Little Bel：</span><br>
Understood!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Hiei-chan：</span><br>
I suppose that's one thing taken care of... But moving forward, I don't know if I'll be able to fit in...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Zeppy：</span><br>
Hmmmmm...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Hiei-chan：</span><br>
Zeppy?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Zeppy：</span><br>
I feel like we've been forgetting about someone since the very beginning...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Akagi：</span><br>
How could that be? All right you two, let's get going now.<br>
Yes, you too... Ahaha...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">???：</span><br>
——<br>
Of course, ahaha...<br>
