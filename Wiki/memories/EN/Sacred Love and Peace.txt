Target spotted! Commencing guerrilla interview!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">San Diego：</span><br>
Huh? What's a guerrilla interview? Oh, I get it! It's because I'm famous now!<br>
I knew I was a genius all along! Okay, game host! Ask me whatever; I know everything!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Gridley：</span><br>
Ahahah... As always, you're a real curiosity, Sandy...<br>
Judging by that costume and that singing... I'm guessing you're going to a party?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">San Diego：</span><br>
Ahahahah, so that gave it away? Yep, I'm gonna sing at a Christmas party!<br>
And my singing will surely touch the audience's hearts so much I can become an idol too!<br>
I'll be the Christmas Idol San Diego, or Sandy Claus for short! Eheheh, aren't I just the smartest ever?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Gridley：</span><br>
Sandy Claus...? Yeah, I can't wait to hear your song!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">San Diego：</span><br>
Then since you're already here, stay for a moment and listen to it!<br>
LAAAA<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Gridley：</span><br>
AAAAAAAA<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">San Diego：</span><br>
Hm? Did I sing the wrong part...? Gridley? Why are you on the floor?<br>
Oh! Did my beautiful singing make you faint from joy?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Gridley：</span><br>
Gasp... Gasp... You could call it a very impactful song... I dunno what to say...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">San Diego：</span><br>
Oh jeez, stop! You're making me blush~<br>
<br>
......<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Gridley：</span><br>
Anyway, I managed to get a good picture! Let's call it... "Sandy Claus"! Heheh, time to find the next target!<br>

Port - Shop<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">{namecode:78}：</span><br>
Hmm... we're getting food... the Christmas cake I ordered earlier... a Christmas tree... and...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">{namecode:79}：</span><br>
Wooow~! The whole base has gotten into the Christmas mood!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">{namecode:78}：</span><br>
It really has. Whenever a holiday rolls around, the atmosphere changes completely.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">{namecode:79}：</span><br>
Do you not like holidays, nee-sama?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">{namecode:78}：</span><br>
No, don't get me wrong. To see everyone in the Sakura Empire enjoy themselves makes me feel excited too. I was just thinking out loud.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">{namecode:79}：</span><br>
Just don't overthink it, okay? ...Wait, what is that...?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">{namecode:78}：</span><br>
I believe that is a... Christmas costume? Would you like to try it on, Yamashiro?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">{namecode:79}：</span><br>
N-no, I don't... I know I don't look good in Christmas stuff...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">{namecode:78}：</span><br>
Don't be so shy. Why not dress appropriately for the season? After all, Christmas only comes once a year, so why not enjoy it to its fullest?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">{namecode:79}：</span><br>
I-if you think so then I'll try it on...<br>
H-how do I look...?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">{namecode:78}：</span><br>
You look great, just as I'd thought!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Mysterious Voice：</span><br>
Next targets spotted: the Sakura Empire's Battleship Sisters!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">{namecode:78}：</span><br>
That sounds like... that photographer from the Union...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">{namecode:79}：</span><br>
You mean... Gridley-chan?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Gridley：</span><br>
Christmas Photography Mode Gridley, at your service! The commander tasked me with documenting everyone's Christmas experience this year!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">{namecode:79}：</span><br>
I assume... milord must be very busy...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">{namecode:78}：</span><br>
Well, that's exactly why we should leave photos of your Christmas experience for him to see.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Gridley：</span><br>
Yeah, exactly! Now, give me a smile! Say "cheese!"<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">{namecode:79}：</span><br>
Hawawah!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Gridley：</span><br>
Nice! I name this one "Holiday Offensive"! Now, who's next on the list...?<br>

Port - Sakura Empire Dormitory<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">{namecode:78}&{namecode:79}：</span><br>
I'm home!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Mutsuki：</span><br>
Welcome back!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">{namecode:82}：</span><br>
Indeed! Outstanding work today, Yamashiro!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">{namecode:79}：</span><br>
Mutsuki and... Mikasa-senpai? What's this about?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">{namecode:82}：</span><br>
Ah, everyone's preoccupied with preparations for this so-called "Crissmoss" festival... I offered to assist, but they declined and told me "please let us handle this one, Mikasa-senpai"...<br>
It's good that everyone respects me, but being respected this much makes me feel pretty lonely...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">{namecode:79}：</span><br>
Mikasa-senpai...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">{namecode:82}：</span><br>
But so be it! I shall try to watch over the young ones here.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Mutsuki：</span><br>
Mikasa-shempai! Come play with me!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">{namecode:82}：</span><br>
Certainly. What shall we play? Do you want to ride on my back, or do you want an upsy-daisy?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">{namecode:78}：</span><br>
I've heard that Mikasa-senpai is cool and dignified on the battlefield...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">{namecode:79}：</span><br>
But outside of it, she's like this...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">{namecode:78}：</span><br>
Ahahah, who would've thought!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">{namecode:82}：</span><br>
There! I hereby declare the Sakura Empire Crissmoss Party as having started!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">{namecode:79}：</span><br>
Merry Christmas, everyone!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">{namecode:78}：</span><br>
And merry Christmas to you, Yamashiro!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">{namecode:79}：</span><br>
I wonder if milord is still in his office...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">{namecode:78}：</span><br>
If it's making you anxious, why not go there to see him? You could even show him your Christmas costume while you're there.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">{namecode:79}：</span><br>
N-nee-sama...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">{namecode:78}：</span><br>
You're very important to me, you know. After all, what kind of sister I be if I didn't support you at times like these?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Mutsuki：</span><br>
I wanna go see the comainder too!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">{namecode:79}：</span><br>
O-okay...! It'd be dangerous to let Mutsuki go alone, so I'll take her with me!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">{namecode:78}：</span><br>
Of course... Good luck, and don't lose sight of Mutsuki. Hahah~<br>

Clothes, check... Presents, check!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Vestal：</span><br>
Your muffler isn't on right, Enterprise... We can't let you get sick again, can we? There, now you look perfect.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Enterprise：</span><br>
Ahem! ...Didn't I tell you? Today I'm not Enterprise, I'm Santa Claus, adored by children around the world. Got it?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Vestal：</span><br>
Of course. Take care delivering all those presents, now... Santa Claus.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Enterprise：</span><br>
...So, the first present goes to...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">McCall：</span><br>
Yikes! Enterprise?! You almost made me drop my popsicle...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Enterprise：</span><br>
I'm not Enterprise, I'm Santa Claus. I've got a present for you. Merry Christmas.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">McCall：</span><br>
T-thanks... I'm not sure if I should be happy or surprised...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Maury：</span><br>
Is that you, Enterprise?!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Enterprise：</span><br>
I'm not Enterprise, I'm Santa Claus. Here, have a present. Merry Christmas.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Maury：</span><br>
T-thank you very much!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Craven：</span><br>
Enter...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Enterprise：</span><br>
No, not Enterprise. I'm Santa Claus.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Craven：</span><br>
S-Santa Claus...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Enterprise：</span><br>
Correct. Merry Christmas. Here, a present for a girl who's always exerting herself.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Craven：</span><br>
Th-thank you! I'll keep giving it all I've got!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Sims：</span><br>
Ack!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Enterprise：</span><br>
I'm Santa Claus. And you're a hard worker. Merry Christmas. Here, have a present.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Sims：</span><br>
Oh, sure...! Muchas gracias!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Hornet：</span><br>
E-Enterprise...?!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Enterprise：</span><br>
I'm not Enterprise. I'm Santa Claus. ...Ugh, I'm so tired of all these people calling me Enterprise...<br>
Here, a nice present for a nice girl. Take it.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Hornet：</span><br>
Come on, Enterprise... I stopped being 10 long ago.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Gridley：</span><br>
Hey, look! I found Santa!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Enterprise：</span><br>
Hahah! Looks like someone else has to hand out presents too. Here, Merry Christmas.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Gridley：</span><br>
Whoa! One for me?! Thank you, Santa!<br>
I guess I'll name this one "Reindeer Master." Because Santa doesn't need reindeer to still be Santa!<br>

Chapter 6 - A Holy Night's Dinner<br>
Port - Royal Navy Dormitory<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Belfast：</span><br>
Christmas dinner is now ready. We hope you will find it to your liking.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Edinburgh：</span><br>
I helped with it too!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Queen Elizabeth：</span><br>
Well done! We aren't proud over our maid fleet for nothing! You may participate in our party as well! ...And the rest of you have done your part as well! Today you may enjoy yourselves to your heart's content!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Cygnet：</span><br>
C-Christmas dinner... With turkey... Christmas pudding... and prawns to start... L-let's dig in!<br>
Ah, it's so delicious!<br>
This is really good, too!<br>
Ahh~ I'm so glad I was born to experience this~<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Comet：</span><br>
Seeing how Cygnet eats always makes me jealous for some reason...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Crescent：</span><br>
Sigh... Just what happens to all that fat... W-wait, maybe it goes straight to her...?!<br>
S-s-so that's why, huh?! I-I need to start eating more, then!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Comet：</span><br>
C-Crescent... Yesterday I had a lesson where they taught us about this... that eating a lot will just make you gain weight, and never where you want it to...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Crescent：</span><br>
T-that's unfair! Dang it... We're all part of the C-class, so why is she different?!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Cygnet：</span><br>
Huh? Why aren't you two eating anything? It'd be a waste to not eat all this delicious food they made...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Crescent：</span><br>
Hmph! If it's come down to this then fine!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Comet：</span><br>
I-I think I'll have something, too!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ark Royal：</span><br>
Hahh... Ahh... The C-class sisters are even cuter than usual today!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Prince of Wales：</span><br>
I can understand being happy over great food, but you, Ark Royal...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ark Royal：</span><br>
I-I know my manners! I'm satisfied with just getting to watch cute destroyers being cute!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Hood：</span><br>
Now it's time to exchange presents with each other. You may all choose one present from this box. Oh, and you cannot return it once you've chosen.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Cygnet：</span><br>
In that case... I'll pick... this one!<br>
W-wait, is this... a Christmas costume...?!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Hood：</span><br>
Why, that's the one I prepared. How interesting you would pick that one. Ahahah~ One should strike while the iron is hot, so may I ask you to change into it right now?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Cygnet：</span><br>
Gosh... But I just ate so much... Then again, it's your present, so...<br>
H-how does it look...?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Hood：</span><br>
You need only look at Ark Royal's expression to know the answer to that~<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Cygnet：</span><br>
What?! Ahhhh... This is so embarrassing...<br>
