<br>
1 Help Me, My Commander!<br>
Port - Office<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Aquila：</span><br>
My Commander, I don't think I can do this!<br>
<br>
Sardegna's sole carrier, Aquila, looked at me imploringly with puffed-out cheeks.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Aquila：</span><br>
Even though I finally have the opportunity to serve as your secretary, I feel like I can't do anything right!<br>
Just thinking about how much trouble I'm going to end up causing you... is making me so very sad!<br>
<br>
I wasn't sure exactly what was going on, but it seemed like she had some doubts about her abilities.<br>
The source of those doubts was...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Aquila：</span><br>
The other day, Miss Illustrious of the Royal Navy invited me to a tea party...<br>
I tried to act as graceful and refined as possible as to not embarrass myself before the elegant ladies of the Royal Navy, but...<br>
It was so painfully clear that I am missing something!<br>
<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项1："Something? Like what?"</span>'''''<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Aquila：</span><br>
Well, I don't really know... Hmm, it's because I have too many ideas about what it might be to pin it down...<br>
I was so happy about being chosen for secretary that I almost forgot to accept a commission we were given, and that ended up causing a lot of problems. I've also been making a ton of mistakes in my work...<br>
Additionally, I haven't been able to improve my teamwork with my friends, and I sometimes feel like I barely know anything about being a carrier!<br>
<br>
While it's true that things tend to go over Aquila's head, most major problems have been preventable just by giving her a quick reminder.<br>
Regarding the situation with her peers, she's one of the newest arrivals at the port, and that's simply something that requires time.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Aquila：</span><br>
My Commander, please help me...<br>
<br>
Of course, I could not bear to see my secretary wallowing in self-doubt.<br>
As such, I decided to ask my friends for help in showing Sardegna's courtly young lady the ways of our port.<br>

2 A Study in Elegance<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Littorio：</span><br>
I see. So she finds herself lacking in elegance compared to the most splendorous signorinas of the Royal Navy.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Duca degli Abruzzi：</span><br>
Littorio and I have come to assist in this matter.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Aquila：</span><br>
Thank you so much for taking the time to come see me. There is much I hope to learn from the two of you.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Littorio：</span><br>
Naturally. I shall spare no effort to aid my fellow Sardegnian.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Duca degli Abruzzi：</span><br>
Likewise. Noblesse oblige demands nothing less of me.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Aquila：</span><br>
Why, thank you~<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Duca degli Abruzzi：</span><br>
Then, as the commander suggested, shall we try holding a tea party?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Aquila：</span><br>
Yes, that would be most appreciated.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Duca degli Abruzzi：</span><br>
...Hah!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Aquila：</span><br>
She removed the bottlecap with just a flick of her rapier! Amazing!<br>
Oh my, thank you very much, Lady Littorio~<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Littorio：</span><br>
There is no need to thank me, Miss Aquila. It is a privilege to offer this fine wine to such a fine young lady~<br>
What do you think of this bottled rose, Commander?<br>
<br>
"Is this... customary for a tea party?"<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Duca degli Abruzzi：</span><br>
Lady Littorio, are you forgetting that Aquila is supposed to be the protagonist here? You're supposed to be helping her learn!<br>
Miss Aquila, the beauty of this rose pales in comparison to your own.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Littorio：</span><br>
Indeed. But just as a rose must be cultivated, your beauty shall bloom even more brilliantly if you become mine~<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Aquila：</span><br>
Umm... I guess, I'm supposed to be more assertive?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Duca degli Abruzzi：</span><br>
Indeed! It would simply be a shame to not make your beauty and splendor known!<br>
And fortunately, you have people here who can freely express themselves without an iota of shame!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Aquila：</span><br>
Make myself known, huh? I see... I need to be more aggressive, then?<br>
What's something aggressive I can do? How about pouring the wine from all the way up here? My Commander, are you watching me? I'm— Eek?!<br>
<br>
She quickly lost control, barely avoiding splashing wine all over her clothes.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Aquila：</span><br>
I'm so sorry, my Commander...<br>
But at least I realized, the issue wasn't with me being insufficiently elegant...<br>
<br>
I had no clue if that farcical series of events actually accomplished anything... but it seemed like progress?<br>

3 Making Things Work<br>
Port - Data Room<br>
In order to help Aquila find her missing "something," I explained the situation to the kids who were helping sort out files in the Data Room.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Aquila：</span><br>
Is there anything I can do to help?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Carabiniere：</span><br>
Why certainly! Having the commander's secretary helping us will make things a hundred times faster!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Libeccio：</span><br>
Woohoo! The sooner we finish, the sooner we get to go out and play. Right, Maestrale?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Maestrale：</span><br>
Y-yeah... We appreciate the assistance.<br>
<br>
And thus, everyone got to work.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Libeccio：</span><br>
♪～♪～♪～<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Aquila：</span><br>
♪～♪～♪～<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Carabiniere：</span><br>
…………<br>
<br>
The serious-looking girls, Carabiniere and Maestrale, pulled materials from the files and handed them to Aquila and Libeccio.<br>
The latter pair were standing next to the copying machine, humming cheerfully while carefully copying the documents they were given.<br>
...But for whatever reason, they were stuffing the documents back into the same old mess of a drawer that they came out of.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Aquila：</span><br>
Ah, Commander, is there something unsatisfactory about my work? I'm just putting things back where they belong~<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Libeccio：</span><br>
Look what I can do when I get serious, Commander! Praise me, praise me!<br>
<br>
...I'm not sure I had the heart to tell them that what they needed wasn't praise, but rather a gentle reminder that they were creating even more work.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Carabiniere：</span><br>
Um, Miss Aquila, you shouldn't just stuff the documents back into the drawer...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Aquila：</span><br>
Did I mess up? I thought I was just doing what Libeccio told me to...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Maestrale：</span><br>
Libeccio, what in the world are you doing?! Jeez, y-you even got Miss Aquila to...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Libeccio：</span><br>
Sowwy...<br>
<br>
After the slight interruption, the workflow was corrected and the documents were soon organized correctly.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Maestrale：</span><br>
Phew... That saved quite a bit of time.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Libeccio：</span><br>
What Maestrale meant to say was, thanks a ton! Hehehe...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Carabiniere：</span><br>
Well, we did run into some hiccups along the way... Heh...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Aquila：</span><br>
Well... All's well that ends well, I suppose?<br>
<br>
Whatever Aquila was missing, it certainly didn't seem to be her ability to get work done...<br>

<br>
4 Exercises and Combat Training<br>
Aquila saluted me gracefully as I arrived at the training grounds.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Aquila：</span><br>
My Commander, thank you for going out of your way to arrange a special training session for me. I'm not sure how I should repay you...<br>
...Oh, it's not a special training session? I see... So a spot opened up in today's regularly-scheduled carrier exercises?<br>
I'm sorry for the mix-up, but thank you for giving me this opportunity nevertheless!<br>
<br>
I know Aquila is conscious about her skills as an aircraft carrier, so I thought it would be a good idea to have her practice with some of the other carriers.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Aquila：</span><br>
Oh wow, Miss Graf Zeppelin is here! I've always wanted to have a chat with her!<br>
Even Junyou and Hiyou are joining us today! I never expected to see so many girls with a history similar to mine!<br>
My Commander, I won't squander this learning opportunity you've given me!<br>
<br>
Seeing Aquila's sparkling eyes, I had high hopes that she would be able to learn something valuable from this training session.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Aquila：</span><br>
Deep breaths... Focus...<br>
My Commander is watching me... so I can't afford to mess up now!<br>
I'm sure this is the right way to launch my planes... Just as my friends taught me...! Fly, my planes!<br>
<br>
Aquila's form was exquisite and breathtaking as her planes took over from her flight deck.<br>
The planes took wing one after another, and with a swing of her staff, soared into the blue sky and joined the formation of the other carriers.<br>
Considering Sardegna's reputation, or lack thereof, when it came to carrier technology, I was blown away by Aquila's perfect form.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Peter Strasser：</span><br>
Officer, you're thinking the exact same thing I am, aren't you?<br>
<br>
Peter Strasser, the newest carrier from the Iron Blood, snapped me from my trance.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Peter Strasser：</span><br>
Judging from her performance today, she is easily on par with some of the most veteran carriers here, including Illustrious.<br>
If she said that she is "missing something," as you claimed, she either already found it... or it was just a mental fabrication in the first place.<br>
Wouldn't it be more appropriate to figure out why she thinks that, rather than trying to help her find whatever it might be?<br>
<br>
After hearing those words from someone who shared a similar origin with Aquila, my eyes trailed back towards the sky above the training area.<br>
Not only was her demeanor graceful and confident, but there was no sign of the anxiety she displayed earlier in my office.<br>

<br>
5 Try, Try Again<br>
After consulting with the other ships again, we all agreed that Aquila didn't really seem to be missing any of the things she thought she was.<br>
Though her work as the secretary could hardly be considered perfect, I also couldn't identify any major faults.<br>
With her cheerful and outgoing personality, she quickly made friends, and in just a few short days, she was already joining tea parties with the carriers from the other factions.<br>
As for her airheadedness...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Aquila：</span><br>
I've circled the important items on your schedule so that you can easily see them at a glance.<br>
For example, this item with four circles around it means you absolutely cannot afford to miss it... This one with a single circle can be delegated to somebody else.<br>
Next, these stars and triangles mean...<br>
<br>
To be honest, it was a little hard to see what was on my itinerary from all the cutesy shapes and marks, but I was the one who gave her the advice to use little marks to remind herself.<br>
...Yeah, cute and charming is definitely what it was.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Aquila：</span><br>
My Commander, thank you for always listening to my unreasonable requests.<br>
I could've sworn I was missing something, but in the end, I'm not sure that's the case anymore.<br>
Thanks to you, I've learned so much in such a short period of time.<br>
<br>
Aquila's disarming smile seemed to melt the worries away from me. But... was that really it? Had her problem just gone away on its own?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Aquila：</span><br>
By the way, Miss Illustrious is having another tea party next week, and I was wondering if you'd be willing to take my place...<br>
<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项1："I think you should give it another try, Aquila."</span>'''''<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Aquila：</span><br>
…………<br>
Commander...?<br>
<br>
If what Peter said was true, and she didn't let her nerves get the better of her, I don't think her airheadedness would be a problem.<br>
There's no way that she would cause me trouble as my secretary... And I was adamant in that belief.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Aquila：</span><br>
You're not coming with me? ...Do I have to go try again by myself...?<br>
If you say so, my Commander... I'll prepare for it...<br>
<br>
Aquila's expression seemed more fitting for someone going off to war, not to a tea party... But I was glad to see the conviction in her eyes.<br>

6 The Missing "Something"<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Unicorn：</span><br>
Sister Aquila, would you, um... like to try this...?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Aquila：</span><br>
Oh my, what an adorable-looking treat. Thank you very much, Unicorn~<br>
Mm, how delicious! Unicorn, would you like to try some of our famous candy from Sardegna?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Illustrious：</span><br>
Make sure to say thank you, Unicorn.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Unicorn：</span><br>
Thank you, Sister Aquila~!<br>
<br>
I observed the patio where the tea party was being held from a distance, every action from the carriers exuding elegance and grace as they enjoyed tea and dessert.<br>
Just thinking about the farce that had unfolded with Littorio and Abruzzi made me a bit nervous, but my worries proved to be misplaced.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Aquila：</span><br>
I've also had an opportunity to talk with Peter Strasser as well as many of the other carriers, and I think I was overthinking things after all.<br>
It's a little embarrassing to say this, but I've been thinking a lot about you, Miss Illustrious.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Illustrious：</span><br>
I'm flattered. What about me, if I may ask?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Aquila：</span><br>
Oh, it's nothing important. There's just something that's been on my mind.<br>
There's a sense of, "I want to become like this or that, so that others can recognize my worth." Something like that...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Illustrious：</span><br>
I don't get that impression from you anymore.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Aquila：</span><br>
Hmm... Really?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Unicorn：</span><br>
Mhm... You seem a lot more relaxed and natural than before.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Illustrious：</span><br>
I agree. When I look at you, what I see is a splendidly shining lady.<br>
<br>
Hearing Illustrious's and Unicorn's words lifted a heavy burden off my chest.<br>
Aquila's anxiety – that "something" she was missing – had been found before I even knew it.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Aquila：</span><br>
If I've changed compared to how I was before...<br>
It must be because I've found someone who cares about me, right?<br>
Yes, I'm sure of it, my Commander...<br>

<br>
7 My Commander<br>
After the tea party ended, I went to pick Aquila up and bring her back to the office.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Aquila：</span><br>
...So, Unicorn prepared some really tasty treats for today's tea party!<br>
I wrapped up the leftovers, so you can help yourself if you'd like~<br>
Though if you don't hurry up, the other girls might get to them before you. Hehe~<br>
<br>
Aquila continued to happily tell me about her tea party.<br>
What Unicorn said was right. Aquila's just being herself today, and it shows.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Aquila：</span><br>
Of course, I cannot hold a candle to Miss Illustrious in so many aspects...<br>
But that isn't the thing that I was missing.<br>
<br>
She's always had what it took in terms of elegance, work capability, and skills as a carrier. Of course, there's always room for improvement, but...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Aquila：</span><br>
One more thing... I finally realized, you've been secretly watching over me this whole time, right? Because you're worried about me...<br>
<br>
That, I had. I didn't think she would notice, but since she did, I had to apologize.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Aquila：</span><br>
My Commander, there's no need to apologize.<br>
I was able to join today's tea party because of you... I've also learned so much recently because of your help.<br>
But above all, thank you for noticing what I was missing.<br>
<br>
The silver-haired girl spun around and flourished her red, white, and green cloak mischievously.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Aquila：</span><br>
The thing I was missing was...<br>
A Commander who cherishes me for who I am~<br>
<br>
The elegant young lady from Sardegna drew close to me and lightly intertwined her arm with mine.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Aquila：</span><br>
Please, continue to teach me all sorts of things, my Commander~♪<br>
