<br>
1.Because I Expect Great Things From You!<br>
Port — Pier<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Nelson：</span><br>
It's been a while since I've been sent that far off on a mission.<br>
What kind of dolt would stand me up on the very day I make my triumphant return?<br>
The gall of that person... making me deliver my report by hand...<br>
<br>
Port — Office<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Nelson：</span><br>
Commander!!!<br>
<br>
...Huh?!<br>
While absorbed in the never-ending pile of paperwork, I hadn't noticed Nelson's presence growing closer and closer to me.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Nelson：</span><br>
Hmph. In case you're about to ask me "what's wrong,"... Well, for your information, I just came back from my long mission. I'm here to make my report.<br>
You seem absolutely swamped with paperwork. Is this why you didn't come meet me at the pier?<br>
<br>
For some reason, she seems to be in a sour mood... Should I push the paperwork back for later and listen to her report first...?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Nelson：</span><br>
Hey, you're not planning on pushing the paperwork back for later, are you?<br>
Make sure to take care of the stuff that's been building up. Someone of your caliber should be able to finish everything by tonight, right?<br>
<br>
As much as I enjoy being praised, there was no way I'd have this mountain of paperwork done by tonight.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Nelson：</span><br>
I don't say this often, so listen up. I expect great things from you, and don't you forget it.<br>
In any case, I'll be back later tonight.<br>
<br>
Nelson left the office, slamming the door loudly behind her.<br>
...Seeing that she's gone and said that much, there's no choice but to get to it, I suppose. Looking at the tall pile of papers and letting out a loud sigh, I tiredly got back to work.<br>

2.Stop Seeing Right Through Me!<br>
The day after Nelson returned from her mission...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Nelson：</span><br>
(I've never seen the commander this worn-out before, but I guess all the paperwork is done...)<br>
(Well, it's not like there's any point for me to waste any pity on that dolt, but perhaps some words of encouragement would be appropriate...)<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Rodney：</span><br>
Nelson, it's dangerous to walk around while lost in thought~<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Nelson：</span><br>
Huh?!... R-Rodney?! Right back at you! It's dangerous to randomly yell at people if they're lost in thought!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Rodney：</span><br>
Nothing random about it. I'm just heading back after reporting on our successful operation~<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Nelson：</span><br>
Is, is that so... to the commander, huh...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Rodney：</span><br>
Yup~ Commander looked awfully in need of a gentle massage, so I was more than happy to oblige~<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Nelson：</span><br>
A massage...?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Rodney：</span><br>
Yup, nice and slow around the shoulders~ <br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Nelson：</span><br>
(Phew... I, I guess it's fine if it was a normal massage...)<br>
Well, if the commander can't even handle that quantity of work, we're going to have serious issues.<br>
It's the commander's responsibility to work tirelessly for the well-being of the port. I won't permit any derelictions of those duties!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Rodney：</span><br>
Teehee~<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Nelson：</span><br>
Wh-what are you giggling about?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Rodney：</span><br>
You're so easy to read, it's adorable. I bet you're like this because you can't get the commander off your mind~<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Nelson：</span><br>
Wh-what are you blathering on about?!<br>
A-anyways, we've been idling about for way too long! I've got things to do, so I'll be off now! Cheers, Rodney!<br>
<br>
Without even waiting for a reply, Nelson rushed off, leaving Rodney behind.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Nelson：</span><br>
(...Geez! Rodney looks so meek, but she's actually ironclad—I can't even control the flow of my own conversation!)<br>
(She's the opposite of me... It irritates me to no end to admit it, but that's probably why she's easy to talk to.)<br>
Sigh... maybe I should make an effort to praise the commander next time I'm at the office...<br>

3.Don't Make Me Repeat Myself!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Nelson：</span><br>
...It's not like I wanted to come here or anything... I just couldn't control my feet.<br>
(It might be a sudden visit, but there's nothing unusual about it at all. I bet the commander's falling apart without my help after all...)<br>
H-hmph! Commander! I'm coming in–!<br>
Commander, if you're in here, at least say something!<br>
<br>
…………。<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Nelson：</span><br>
(There's a stack of papers just pushed aside here... Did the commander fall asleep on the job?)<br>
Sigh... I heard from Rodney that you were pretty worn out, but you really shouldn't just fall asleep in the midde of work.<br>
(...But, I guess I can allow it this time. Be grateful that I'm such a compassionate person...)<br>
<br>
――！<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Nelson：</span><br>
Woah! C-Commander?!<br>
<br>
I seem to have unexpectedly passed out... Was the fatigue finally getting to me...?<br>
From the looks of things, Nelson decided to stop by my office while I was sleeping... But why does she look so flustered?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Nelson：</span><br>
Ah, uh, umm... You know.<br>
L-look how hopeless you are, Commander! How could you just fall asleep during the middle of work hours!<br>
<br>
――！！<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Nelson：</span><br>
G-good grief. And you still have so much work left to do...<br>
That's enough beauty sleep for now! Get back to work, and make it snappy!<br>
<br>
After being goaded along by Nelson, I hurriedly rubbed my sleepy eyes before returning to the paperwork once more.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Nelson：</span><br>
(Why did I end up saying all that other stuff... Ugh, I'm the hopeless one here!)<br>
<br>
Hmm...?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Nelson：</span><br>
S-stop trying to dissect every little thing I say! Don't you know it's uncouth to stare so much?!<br>
If you have time to worry about me, you also have time to work! Shut your mouth and stay on task!<br>
<br>
As I made my pen fly across the page in accordance with her words, Nelson slowly left the side of my desk.<br>
But... for some reason, Nelson brought over a chair, sat down by my side, and started to talk.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Nelson：</span><br>
...Hey, let me know which things I can help you with.<br>
D-don't make me repeat myself! I won't say it twice!<br>
<br>
I have no idea why she continued to get angry with me, but I did manage to pass some of my workload over to her as requested.<br>
Eventually, we were able to finish all the paperwork without any major issues.<br>

4.We're Done Talking Here!<br>
One beautiful, sunny day...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Rodney：</span><br>
Oh my, Commander, to think I'd run into you here~<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Nelson：</span><br>
...Why are you here? Weren't you supposed to be holed up in the office today?<br>
Oh, right. You did say your presence was required for a different mission today.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Rodney：</span><br>
Hehe~ I see you remembered what Commander told you~<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Nelson：</span><br>
S-stop it with the unnecessary nonsense!<br>
<br>
When I asked where the two of them were headed, they told me they were heading to the Eagle Union dorms to hold a meeting on an upcoming mission.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Nelson：</span><br>
We're conducting a joint mission with the Big Seven representatives from the Eagle Union. Speaking of which, weren't you the one in charge of leading the mission?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Rodney：</span><br>
We were about to hash out the finer details of the mission. If you're not too busy, we'd greatly appreciate your input~<br>
<br>
Even though I had just come back from doing much the same, I couldn't really turn down an invitation to a meeting concerning a mission I personally was involved with.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Nelson：</span><br>
Are you coming or not? Well, not that I think you'd turn the invitation down, though.<br>
If you've made up your mind, let's hurry on over to the Eagle Union dorms. It's way too hot over here...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Rodney：</span><br>
Commander, you've really been working yourself to the bone recently, haven't you?<br>
I'll be making some iced tea before the meeting starts. You should use that time to relax and rest up~<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Nelson：</span><br>
Rodney, this is a formal, mission-related discussion. How could you even think of compromising the commander's mental state?<br>
...B-but, I suppose it is true that the commander has been working very hard as of late... So, um, I guess I can overlook it...<br>
Ahem! It's decided! We're done talking here!<br>
<br>
Nelson picked up her pace after hurriedly cutting off the conversation.<br>
Though the Eagle Union dorms are located a fair distance away, I would've arrived in no time had I decided to match her blistering pace...<br>

<br>
5.Say Something Already!<br>
Nelson, Rodney, and I finally arrived at the Eagle Union dorms.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Maryland：</span><br>
Wow, the two of you are early. Color me surprised, I was afraid the Royal Navy's Big Seven would demand a special procession before entering our humble abode.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Colorado：</span><br>
You even brought the commander with you, huh? Good stuff.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Rodney：</span><br>
Umm, we brought some tea leaves over from our dormitory. Should I prepare some iced tea for everyone?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Maryland：</span><br>
Sounds good. It's blistering hot out today, and I'm thirsty to boot!<br>
<br>
Rodney was guided to the kitchen, while everyone else headed to the conference room.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Nelson：</span><br>
It's a bit straight to the point, but I'd like to start discussing about how we can work together in the upcoming practice exercise.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">West Virginia：</span><br>
A bit blunt, but... I don't mind people being a bit more efficiency-minded.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Colorado：</span><br>
I agree. If anything, it might be something that we, Colorado-class sisters, are proficient at.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Nelson：</span><br>
It seems we're on the same page. Now then, let's continue our discussion.<br>
<br>
The discussion between the four quickly heated up from the onset.<br>
By the time Rodney brought the iced tea over, the discussion seemed to already have boiled over.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Nelson：</span><br>
...While I will accept that this mission is relatively safe, there is no guarantee that we will not encounter the enemy.<br>
In the unlikely event that we're forced to engage with the enemy, we're likely to be outnumbered. We must be prepared to face such a situation.<br>
If we encounter the enemy... We'll hit their weak point, then split up to flank them from the sides, cutting off their reinforcements while chipping them down piecemeal.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Colorado：</span><br>
...Hmm. That's not a bad plan. What do you think, Commander?<br>
<br>
It's true that in a case where the enemy outnumbers you and you can't make a surprise attack to gain the initiative, you need to think of another plan. Nelson's plan is so daring, it might just work.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Nelson：</span><br>
I'm glad you have your wits about you, Commander.<br>
<br>
I need to give a name to the tactical maneuver, so I'll ask Nelson if she has any ideas.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Nelson：</span><br>
Of course I've thought of a name. It's...<br>
<br>
...*Poke*.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Nelson：</span><br>
What do you think about, "The Nelson Touch"?<br>
<br>
…………………………<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Nelson：</span><br>
Hey! Say something already! It's not every day that I come up with something innovative like this!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">West Virginia：</span><br>
"The Nelson Touch," huh? Then that's what we'll do if we encounter enemies.<br>
<br>
While rubbing my cheek at the location Nelson had poked at, I nodded at West Virginia's words. Indeed, I might have been zoning out for a bit.<br>
Maybe I wasn't hydrated enough. Feeling thirsty, I started to sip slowly at the iced tea that Rodney made.<br>

6.There's Something I Wanted to Tell You<br>
Port - Office<br>
After parting ways with Nelson and the others, I returned to the office to sum up what we had just discussed.<br>
Ever since the meeting, however, my head's been feeling a bit heavy...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Nelson：</span><br>
Hey, Commander! There was something I forgot to tell you about the mission earlier...<br>
<br>
I heard Nelson's voice reverberating from the hallway outside the office, but... I felt so dizzy that words wouldn't leave my lips...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Nelson：</span><br>
...Good grief! At least respond when someone calls out to you... Wait, Commander? What's wrong?<br>
<br>
My vision blurred, and all I could think of was her voice echoing inside my head, over and over again...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Nelson：</span><br>
...mmander!!! Hey, are you alright?! Answer me!!!<br>
<br>
And just like that, everything went black...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Nelson：</span><br>
...Have you come to?<br>
<br>
When I came back to my senses, I was lying down on bed, and I could see Nelson's figure sitting by my side.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Nelson：</span><br>
Good grief... Do you know how unbecoming it is for someone of your stature to pass out because of work?<br>
...Don't you know? There's nothing more important than taking care of your condition. Don't disappoint me like this.<br>
<br>
There certainly was merit in what she said. I sincerely apologized for all the trouble I had caused.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Nelson：</span><br>
As long as you know, it's fine. Hmph.<br>
But... for today, make sure you take it easy and get some sleep.<br>
If, by any chance, you do the same thing in the future, I will never forgive you. Got it?<br>
<br>
Saying that, Nelson got up to leave the room.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Nelson：</span><br>
By the way... there's something I have to say. Or rather, it's more like... there's something I've always wanted to tell you.<br>
G... Good job, on everything so far...<br>
W-wait, that's not what I wanted to say at all!<br>
<br>
Nelson left, slamming the door shut in her wake. Was she blushing though, or was I just imagining things...?<br>

The Virtue of Being Earnest<br>
<br>
7.I've Always Expected Great Things From You!<br>
Ever since that day I felt groggy from overwork...<br>
My condition returned to normal, and I showed up to watch Nelson's joint exercise. <br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Nelson：</span><br>
Commander, are you feeling better?!<br>
<br>
As soon as she saw me, Nelson signaled to the others and broke formation in order to come see me.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Nelson：</span><br>
Why did I come over? Isn't it obvious that I came because I was worried sick about your condition?<br>
Look, you collapsed the other day because you were in bad shape, right? Didn't you promise to take care of yourself?<br>
<br>
Wasn't she there with me when I recovered...?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Nelson：</span><br>
Wh-what's the matter? Stop looking at me like I'm not acting like myself...<br>
Even so, how could I not worry about you?! I went way overboard with what I said to you... And I'm worried that I might be part of the reason why you ended up like that in the first place!<br>
I-In the first place, you don't always look chipper, so I just... N-No, that's not... what I'm here to talk about...<br>
<br>
While looking at her looking frustrated that she wasn't able to say what she wanted to say...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Nelson：</span><br>
B-besides, I've always expected great things from you. Nobody could ever replace you and the things you do...<br>
<br>
As Nelson said those words, embarrassment rose all the way up her face to the tip of her ears.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Nelson：</span><br>
That's why you need to become a more steadfast commander, one that I won't have to worry about!<br>
I know you can do it... because, that's why I feel this way in the first place...<br>
<br>
Maybe it was due to her incredible pride, but she was unable to earnestly put her thoughts in to words, instead brushing me aside with her usual cheeky attitude.<br>
Though I found her attitude bewildering at first, the better I got to know her, the more I realized how compassionate and kind she actually is.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Nelson：</span><br>
Well, I'll be heading off then, Commander!<br>
<br>
Having said that, Nelson's face clearly looked brighter. It seemed that she felt somewhat relieved at having come closer to the virtue of being earnest..<br>
