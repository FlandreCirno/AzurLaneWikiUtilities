<br>
The storm rages across the waters, through a night that knows no end.<br>
Within the tempest lingers one lonesome vessel.<br>
Will the storm's rage first be quelled, or will this vessel first capsize?<br>
Will a ray of light bring hope through the darkness? <br>
.......<br>
For I am but an oneiric butterfly, fluttering among illusions.<br>
May light guide this vessel. May hope guide the Sakura Empire.<br>
Sakura Empire - An island within the Diadem of Light<br>
(Clink, clank!)<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Hibiki：</span><br>
Aaaah! Ryuuhou, watch out!!<br>
<br>
The destroyer, Hibiki, was careening down a flight of stairs, her balance failing her as she struggled to contain an armful of ceremonial items.<br>
(Clang! Bam! Crash!)<br>
She falls over in panic, dropping the ceremonial items all over the place.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Hibiki：</span><br>
Owie...<br>
You're so mean, Ryuuhou! You could've helped me!<br>
<br>
Next to her is Ryuuhou, a former submarine tender who had been converted into a light carrier. She effortlessly avoided the destroyer, catching the ceremonial items in mid-air.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ryuuhou：</span><br>
Don't whine to me. We shipgirls don't get hurt so easily. And didn't I tell you to be careful with these ceremonial items?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Hibiki：</span><br>
Hey, can't you show at least a little concern for me?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ryuuhou：</span><br>
We're nearly ready to begin the ritual, so please do tread with a little more care from now on.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Hibiki：</span><br>
...Speaking of the ritual, will you-know-who really be there?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ryuuhou：</span><br>
Any and all from the Sakura Empire will surely come.<br>
Remember what she said? "Let us hold a historic ceremony and make an offering to the gods. It shall show the Sakura Empire the way forward, giving unto it a brighter future free of threats from the likes of foreign nations or the Sirens."<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">？？？：</span><br>
So this is where you were, Ryuuhou.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ryuuhou：</span><br>
Ah, Noshiro. Good to see you. Do you need something?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Noshiro：</span><br>
I'm here to forward the message from our Iron Blood guests: "We will participate in the ritual." Or so they said, but they seem to have gotten lost.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ryuuhou：</span><br>
In other words... this is the first time we'll be holding a ritual with outsiders present.<br>
Noshiro, would you please escort them here?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Noshiro：</span><br>
...Certainly. I will do so at once.<br>
However, I need you to do something, Ryuuhou. An offering in which the ships participating in the ritual compete for glory – a Combined Fleet exercise – is necessary as a display of the Sakura Empire's strength.<br>
I would like you to prepare the event for the participants, as well as decide on how to conduct the matches.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ryuuhou：</span><br>
Very well. Organizing events is not my forte, but I will focus all my attention on it.<br>
<br>
*knock* *knock*<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Kinu：</span><br>
Ryuuhou, Akagi's crew are about to arrive any minute now.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Hibiki：</span><br>
The First Carrier Division! I knew they'd come!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Noshiro：</span><br>
It is time to make our move, Ryuuhou.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ryuuhou：</span><br>
...Yes, of course.<br>
This ritual will decide the future of the Sakura Empire.<br>
As representatives of our great land, we must not fail!<br>
Now, everyone, get into your respective positions!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Everyone：</span><br>
Understood!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ryuuhou：</span><br>
After years of suffering... No, we've been training for this very moment, and it is time to show the entire world our might!<br>
<br>
The venue bursts with activity as everyone begins getting into the positions they've been assigned.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
                                 The Sakura Empire's oceans are enveloped in the zeal to carry out the ritual.<br>

Sakura Empire - Diadem of Light<br>
The Sakura Empire. It consists of many numerous islands and is a superpower with a distinctive culture.<br>
Away from its mainland there are six remote islands, collectively known as the Diadem of Light. The islands are connected by suspension bridges, forming the shape of a bright sun, or perhaps a snow crystal.<br>
Due to their isolation from the main islands, the Diadem of Light is believed to be the resting grounds of an immense spiritual power. Many conduct pilgrimages to these distant islands in order to hold their rituals and ceremonies.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Kaga：</span><br>
The Diadem of Light, huh... They picked a good place.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Akagi：</span><br>
Indeed. It is like one big Sanctuary, a place where people's beliefs and faiths congregate.<br>
For being called "Decisives," the higher-ups certainly devote a lot of energy to something so pointless...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Yamashiro：</span><br>
You don't have any faith in their plans, Akagi?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Akagi：</span><br>
It's a waste of human resources. It's not like they only expended their thoughts and prayers. They even used one of our "Catalysts," and for what purpose? A useless girl who slumbers.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Yamashiro：</span><br>
From what I've heard, she's far from useless! They say that she can see everything that is happening, and can even conduct a ritual from within her slumber! Although, they're just rumors...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Akagi：</span><br>
Anyone who believes in those vacuous rumors is a pitiable fool.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Kaga：</span><br>
That whole "cleansing the darkness within the Sakura Empire" song and dance is getting old.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Akagi：</span><br>
But what do you believe, Yamashiro? As you are the spiritual expert here, I would love to hear your opinion.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Yamashiro：</span><br>
O-of course! Umm, let me start by explaining the ritual!<br>
The Diadem of Light houses one of the Sakura Empire's great artifacts - a divine stone said to come from the oceanic deity, Watatsumi. When the blood moon rises, the seal placed upon this artifact is lifted.<br>
By offering the faith stored within various ceremonial items and praying to Watatsumi using this artifact as a catalyst, we can tap into the deity's powers to will ships into existence, even those who never truly existed.<br>
And Suruga, I've heard, was created through that very process to serve as its messenger!<br>
The ritual itself was originally carried out by the Sakura Empire's shrine maiden, and was supposed to be both ceremonious and festive in nature.<br>
Common sense says that means Lady Nagato would serve as Watatsumi's host, but...<br>
Because of how haphazardly we selected the host this time, I don't think things will go as intended! That's my opinion, anyway.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Kaga：</span><br>
Right now, Nagato is... Never mind. I suppose you never know with how capricious these deities can be.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Akagi：</span><br>
She won't be making an appearance. She's currently taking care of something with Shoukaku, Zuikaku, and Mikasa.<br>
Besides, if all that's truly is to recite some fancy ritual verses, then anyone could do that.<br>
Please tell me you don't believe that absurd gossip, Kaga.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Kaga：</span><br>
Of course I don't. But while I don't want back everything I've invested, I do hope to get something out of this ritual.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Akagi：</span><br>
And you will get it. Not through clinging onto vague prophecies, or wasting prayers and artifacts...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Yamashiro：</span><br>
I'm sorry for butting in, but... I'm not entirely sure what you're talking about, but isn't that dangerous to say, Akagi? What if somebody overhears you?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Akagi：</span><br>
………<br>
Heehee, it was nothing more than a joke. Don't worry.<br>

<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ryuuhou：</span><br>
We welcome you to the Diadem of Light. I am Ryuuhou, and I will serve as your guide.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Akagi：</span><br>
Ah, how nice it is to see you after so long, Ryuuhou.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ryuuhou：</span><br>
Likewise. It is good to see you and Kaga are in good health.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Kaga：</span><br>
Yeah, yeah. We already know the rule. "Participants in the ritual must demonstrate their might as a show of respect."<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Akagi：</span><br>
...Kaga, do not underestimate her. Even if she's a light carrier, she must be powerful if she is in charge of organizing the ritual.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ryuuhou：</span><br>
Indeed. All I do is for the Sakura Empire's future!<br>
Now then, let us begin!<br>
{{折叠面板|内容结束}}

{{折叠面板|标题=Advancing Waves|选项=4|主框=1|样式=primary|展开=是}}
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ryuuhou：</span><br>
As expected of the esteemed original First Carrier Division... I've been bested.<br>
Allow me once more to welcome you to the Diadem of Light. We are honored to have guests visiting us from afar.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Akagi：</span><br>
Apologies, we couldn't afford to go easy on you.<br>
Having said that, you've matured magnificently, Ryuuhou. You would be a perfect fit for the Sakura Empire's Carrier Task Force.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ryuuhou：</span><br>
I am grateful for your praise. However, as much as it shames me to admit, I still have many things to learn. I'm afraid I wouldn't be ready for such an important position...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Akagi：</span><br>
That wasn't flattery, it was my honest evaluation of you.<br>
If you'll pardon me emulating Kaga: we live in a kill-or-be-killed world, and only those like you with power can bring it justice.<br>
Tomfoolery aside, you have done a fantastic job on your ritual preparations.<br>
The Sakura Empire's future depends on our combined efforts. What do you say we work together?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ryuuhou：</span><br>
It would be an honor. I shall work as hard as I can towards my goal of one day becoming a part of the Carrier Task Force!<br>
On another note... I was surprised to see you attend this exercise at all, Akagi. There shouldn't be any need for the Sakura Empire's de facto leader to attend...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Akagi：</span><br>
Oh, no. It's times like these when we need to cooperate.<br>
Be it rituals, Siren technology, or even the Decisives, the Sakura Empire will use anything at its disposal.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ryuuhou：</span><br>
Akagi...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Akagi：</span><br>
…………<br>
(I'm sure even Amagi would've done this if she could.)<br>
Hehe, it strangely feels like I'm looking at a younger version of myself.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ryuuhou：</span><br>
...Akagi?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Akagi：</span><br>
Never mind that. Good luck in your further pursuits, Ryuuhou.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ryuuhou：</span><br>
Thank you!<br>

Diadem of Light - Surrounding Waters<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Zuikaku：</span><br>
So this is the Diadem of Light... It gives off a totally different vibe compared to the main islands, or even from Lady Nagato's sanctuary...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Shoukaku：</span><br>
Lady Nagato should be the one conducting the ritual to begin with. I'm astonished that they would exclude her from it due to "unforseen circumstances."<br>
It seems the First Carrier Division has done a lot of work behind the scenes...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Zuikaku：</span><br>
They might be trying to get rid of us, seeing as they were behind that one Mirror Sea appearance. I can't help but wonder if Akagi and Kaga really ARE working the Sirens...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Mikasa：</span><br>
It's too early to presume that, Zuikaku. We did make it here without incident, did we not?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Zuikaku：</span><br>
Well, you could be right, Mikasa. You're a veteran after all, so you probably have a better feel for these things than I do. One day, I wanna be as renowned as you!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Shoukaku：</span><br>
Just give it a few more decades and the title will be yours, "Great Veteran" Zuikaku~<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Zuikaku：</span><br>
Don't call me that! That's super embarrassing!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Mikasa：</span><br>
Ahahahah, it is good that you're so energetic this early in the morning. However, we have a serious topic to discuss.<br>
Zuikaku, Shoukaku, there is something I want to confirm with you before we arrive at the islands.<br>
It is true that the Akagi you met in the Mirror Seas was behaving strangely, and you could interpret her actions as being harmful to us, her fellow compatriots.<br>
However, she is now one of the leaders of the Sakura Empire. It would be unwise to do anything that would directly aggravate her.<br>
Unless my assumptions are wrong, only a select few individuals within the Sakura Empire would know of Akagi's actions inside the Sanctuary.<br>
And given that the Mirror Seas are Siren creations, we cannot be sure that those you met inside the Mirror Sea – Akatsuki and Yamashiro – were really them or not.<br>
...Though admittedly, Shoukaku was real. As were Akagi and Kaga.<br>
What I'm getting at is, we are participating in the ritual to discover what Akagi's true motive is. If Shinano is truly all-aware, then she would know whether Akagi is colluding with the Sirens, or still stands on our side.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Zuikaku：</span><br>
In other words, we're here to make some new friends! Don't worry, I'm good at that!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Mikasa：</span><br>
You could say that. We will soon learn who really has our backs when it matters. Both on the playing field and the battlefield.<br>
We've had many chances to do this with the Northern Parliament and the Royal Navy, but now that Iron Blood has gotten involved, I doubt our regular methods will work...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Shoukaku：</span><br>
Indeed. We may have to improvise.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Zuikaku：</span><br>
The ritual host should be be here soon, so let's get ready to do this!<br>
{{折叠面板|内容结束}}

{{折叠面板|标题=The Second Host|选项=6|主框=1|样式=primary|展开=是}}
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Suruga：</span><br>
I am Suruga, the host of the ritual. It must've been a long journey for you all. Thank you for coming, Mikasa, Shoukaku, and Zuikaku.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Mikasa：</span><br>
So you're the fabled third Kii-class battleship. I can hardly believe my eyes... Nevertheless, you have done an awe-inspiring job on the ritual thus far. I thank you on the behalf of all the Sakura Empire.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Suruga：</span><br>
Thank you. However, I did only what anyone in my position would do. I don't deserve any special praise for that...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Mikasa：</span><br>
Hahah! You'll bore people if you're overly modest. From what I've heard, not only did you make the preparations for the joint exercise, you've even offered to take part in it yourself.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Suruga：</span><br>
You've heard correct... That is the plan.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Mikasa：</span><br>
Even though it's just an exercise, we'll have to show off our stuff since the Iron Blood is also here. How about a quick duel so I can see your power?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Suruga：</span><br>
(What?! Right now?! Oh no, I'm not good at dealing with people like her...!)<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Mikasa：</span><br>
Aha! You just shouted "What?! Right now?!" in your mind, didn't you?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Suruga：</span><br>
(How did she know that?!)<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Mikasa：</span><br>
And next, you're going to think, "How did she know that?!" Good grief, you youngsters are so predictable these days...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Suruga：</span><br>
W-wow...! If you'll pardon me asking, how did you know what I was thinking?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Mikasa：</span><br>
From experience, I suppose. When you're always trying to figure out what the enemy is thinking, you get pretty close to being able to actually read minds.<br>
Now, I've heard you're extremely skilled in theory, but I'd like to see if your ability holds up when put into practice!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Suruga：</span><br>
If that is a direct order, then I shall comply with it. As you wish, I shall hold nothing back...!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Mikasa：</span><br>
That's the spirit. Show us what you're capable of!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Suruga：</span><br>
(She'll easily tell if I'm going easy on her. I'll need to take this battle seriously...!)<br>
Let us begin! Raise your weapons!<br>

<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Mikasa：</span><br>
Are these... bombers?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Suruga：</span><br>
That they are. I've been informed that your rather outdated rigging is ill-suited for dealing with aircraft.<br>
To take advantage of that, I have requested airstrikes from the mass-produced carriers positioned further behind me. Soon enough, victory shall be mine...!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Mikasa：</span><br>
You used yourself as a distraction to keep the carriers safe while they launch their airstrikes to corner me... A very smart strategy.<br>
Unfortunately, you made a fatal mistake! You assumed my tactics are as outdated as my rigging!<br>
{{折叠面板|内容结束}}

{{折叠面板|标题=Joint Operation|选项=8|主框=1|样式=primary|展开=是}}
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Suruga：</span><br>
Oh, riiiight, joke's on me...<br>
Your "we" and "us" were of course referring to Zuikaku's and Shoukaku's support... *Sigh*, I never stood a chance against you, did I? I admit defeat.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Mikasa：</span><br>
Don't be too hard on yourself. You nearly had me for a moment there.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Suruga：</span><br>
Perhaps, but you turned the tables on me in the blink of an eye... I see now how you've earned your reputation...<br>
(I know about her rigging inside out, and I maintained my distance properly... Even excluding the surprise airstrike, I shouldn't have lost this!)<br>
(I don't even have any idea of what I did wrong! This person is a monster!)<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Mikasa：</span><br>
Let me guess: you're thinking "this person is a monster," aren't you?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Suruga：</span><br>
Ah, n-no, well, I don't mean it that way...!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Mikasa：</span><br>
Good. I was afraid I scared you off.<br>
Even with your liberal use of airstrikes, you attacked me with rational tactics. You didn't simply rely on your perception of having an overwhelming advantage and charge straight at me.<br>
Hahah! Nevertheless, I must say these changing times are wonderful. Engines, cannons, and aircraft are all stronger than ever.<br>
I'm forced to admit that I am very much stuck in the past.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Suruga：</span><br>
(She can casually admit how old-fashioned she is? Spoken like a true veteran...)<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Mikasa：</span><br>
But do not pity me. A soldier cannot do their duty if they ignore the truth.<br>
I wish an old-timer such as myself wouldn't need to fight, but the world is blind to age.<br>
When the Sakura Empire needs me, I will not stand by and watch. I will do everything necessary to fulfill my obligations to my nation.<br>
That is my duty. The duty which my past comrades entrusted me with. The duty I must and will carry out, no matter how the times may change.<br>
<br>
Mikasa held her hand before her chest and clenched it into a fist.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Mikasa：</span><br>
I have heard that other factions will participate in the ritual. From my experiences, I am concerned about whether or not these islands will be sufficiently protected during the ritual.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Suruga：</span><br>
Of course. I appreciate your thoughtfulness and apologize for any concern caused.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Mikasa：</span><br>
Ahahaha! Okay, Zuikaku, Shoukaku. It's time to head onto the main islands!<br>
(The empty pursuit of power leads to ruination, and the empty pursuit of knowledge leads one astray.)<br>
(Akagi, how long will it take you to understand...?)<br>

<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Prinz Eugen：</span><br>
Are you done yet, Thiele? It's almost time for lunch.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Z2：</span><br>
I'm doing the best I can... I'll be done recording soon, so just wait a little longer.<br>
They've created an enclosed space within this area of the sea, one that cannot be observed from the outside. It's like a magic boundary created using Siren technology.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Prinz Eugen：</span><br>
It's not magic; our technology is just not sufficiently advanced yet.<br>
More importantly, how's your ammo?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Z2：</span><br>
I have plenty of it.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Prinz Eugen：</span><br>
And your rigging?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Z2：</span><br>
Everything is functioning normally.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Prinz Eugen：</span><br>
That's a good girl. And our escape route?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Z2：</span><br>
I have one secured, but I doubt we'll need it.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Prinz Eugen：</span><br>
Heheh, you never know. Just in case~<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Z2：</span><br>
Do you think Akagi's plan is going to fall through?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Prinz Eugen：</span><br>
I'm not worried about it, but the lady in charge is.<br>
I even had to draft this backup plan just to sate her paranoia.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Z2：</span><br>
I see... Still, this plan Akagi came up with is really naïve.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Prinz Eugen：</span><br>
Not to mention dangerous. The Sirens are not easily fooled.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Z2：</span><br>
We should be fine if it goes as planned and we can use this ritual as a way to bolster our forces. If it doesn't, however...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Prinz Eugen：</span><br>
As long as the Sakura Empire ends up taking the fall for whatever happens, it shouldn't really matter who is leading them, right? This whole thing leaves a bad taste in my mouth though.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Z2：</span><br>
I know, but it's still awful.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Prinz Eugen：</span><br>
The bottom line is, these are our orders. Are you having second thoughts?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Z2：</span><br>
No, absolutely not...<br>
Okay, I made a final sweep and saved our coordinates.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Prinz Eugen：</span><br>
Good. Now then, let's stop pretending like we're lost and head over to them. We don't want to make them wait around too long~<br>

<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Noshiro：</span><br>
Visitors from Iron Blood, I bid you welcome to the Diadem of Light.<br>
I am Noshiro, Agano-class light cruiser. I've been waiting for your arrival.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Prinz Eugen：</span><br>
It is our honor as fellow members of the Crimson Axis to have been invited here.<br>
On behalf of the Iron Blood, I would also like to express my words of gratitude to Lady Shinano and the people of the Sakura Empire.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Noshiro：</span><br>
We are glad to hear it. Now, if you would please follow me, I shall guide you to your accommodations for the–<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Prinz Eugen：</span><br>
Pardon, but wasn't there a rule that calls for an opening performance of sorts? "Participants in the ritual must demonstrate their might as a show of respect," I believe?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Noshiro：</span><br>
That is correct. We do conduct exercise battles as a show of respect.<br>
However, that is only required of citizens of the Sakura Empire. We will not force our guests to take part in such a thing.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Prinz Eugen：</span><br>
That's quite a pity. I was so looking forward to immersing myself within the rich customs of the Sakura Empire.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Noshiro：</span><br>
That would be difficult to make happen...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Prinz Eugen：</span><br>
Think of it as a favor to us. Surely the host wouldn't want their guests to miss out on an enjoyable activity, would they?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Noshiro：</span><br>
...Difficult, but not impossible. Without a doubt, a host's job is to make their guests feel welcome. And if that is what you desire, then we can do so.<br>
However, I'm a little rusty, so you'll have to forgive me. Please brace yourselves for combat.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Prinz Eugen：</span><br>
Hah, isn't this what you were hoping for to begin with?<br>
In either case, I'm curious to see what you're made of, Noshiro...<br>
Long live Iron Blood!<br>

<span style="color:#ec5d53;">Prinz Eugen：</span><br>
Come on. I thought you were a cutting-edge cruiser, but this is all you have?<br>
Perhaps you weren't being as humble as I thought when you said you were rusty.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Noshiro：</span><br>
(We may have used exercise shells, but she didn't fight like this was an exercise! She held nothing back...!)<br>
(She deserves to be reprimanded for going too... No, I need to calm down. They're our guests, after all.)<br>
You fought wonderfully, Prinz Eugen. It is no wonder you have recieved so many medals.<br>
<span style="color:#ec5d53;">Prinz Eugen：</span><br>
I "fought wonderfully"? That was hardly a fight at all.<br>
I could fight someone of your caliber in my sleep.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Noshiro：</span><br>
(This woman... You're really trying my patience now...!)<br>
Is that so? Well, I am honored that you held nothing back on me, as this was merely an exercise battle.<br>
<span style="color:#ec5d53;">Prinz Eugen：</span><br>
God almighty, I can't believe we call you our allies. If they call you one of the Sakura Empire's most advanced cruisers, then we'd be better off without the help of your land of Neanderthals.<br>
I'm utterly disappointed. Come on, Thiele. We're going home.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Noshiro：</span><br>
（............）<br>
You're not going anywhere, Prinz Eugen!<br>
If you so desperately want to see why I am a cutting-edge light cruiser, then I'll be more than glad to show you.<br>
Insulting me is one thing, but I will not let your affront to the Sakura Empire go unpunished!<br>
<span style="color:#ec5d53;">Prinz Eugen：</span><br>
Ah, are you finally going to get serious? Good! I thought you never would!<br>
Now, give me the fight I came here for!<br>
{{折叠面板|内容结束}}

{{折叠面板|标题=Trickery|选项=12|主框=1|样式=primary|展开=是}}
<br>
BOOOOOM!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Noshiro：</span><br>
This is my chance...!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Akagi：</span><br>
That's enough, Noshiro! Step back!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Noshiro：</span><br>
A-Akagi...?! Very well, I shall...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Akagi：</span><br>
Goodness gracious, it sounded like the Sirens were attacking us... What are you doing, Eugen?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Prinz Eugen：</span><br>
Thanks for saving me, I suppose. I came here as a peaceful tourist, hoping to get a closer look at the Sakura Empire's fine traditions.<br>
But if you hadn't showed up, this girl would've turned me into mince meat.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Akagi：</span><br>
If that really is true, then we are honored to know that Noshiro fought THE Prinz Eugen face-to-face and nearly defeated her.<br>
Let's not beat around the bush. You were trying to sink her, weren't you?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Prinz Eugen：</span><br>
Of course not, I came here just to enjoy myself. Guess I must have struck a nerve.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Noshiro：</span><br>
Akagi, I nearly defeated her!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Akagi：</span><br>
There is no "almost" here. You either defeat someone, or you don't. She could've sent you straight to the drydock with just a single volley.<br>
What you saw wasn't a chance to defeat her, it was a deceptive maneuver to lure you within range of her guns.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Noshiro：</span><br>
What?! ...I apologize, Akagi. I lost control over myself.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Z2：</span><br>
She shouldn't have escalated it after Eugen provoked her, but I can't blame her for doing so<br>
If it were Hipper, she would've exploded with rage after Eugen's first remark. Noshiro, by comparison, lasted much longer before retaliating.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Prinz Eugen：</span><br>
Heheh, I'm sorry. I can't stop myself from poking fun at people who take themselves too seriously.<br>
Let's make it up to you with a little gift. If you'd like one, that is. Perhaps you wouldn't?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Noshiro：</span><br>
There is no need. I am also to blame for escalating the situation. And for that, I sincerely apologize.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Akagi：</span><br>
If you don't mind me asking: I noticed you two arrived here quite late. You didn't get lost on the way here, did you?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Prinz Eugen：</span><br>
Lost isn't the right word. Your waters are unfamiliar territory to us, that's all. It wasn't easy to find our way here.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Noshiro：</span><br>
...Pardon? I stood and waited by the barrier's entrance, as promised. I'm not sure how you could've missed me...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Akagi：</span><br>
Ah, of course it wasn't...<br>
Given that we are allies, what need is there to hide things from us? Let me rephrase: HOW did you get lost on the way here? Could you please tell me?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Prinz Eugen：</span><br>
Hah, it's no use to try hiding the truth from you, I suppose.<br>
Let me tell you then. We...<br>
Are starving! Too hungry to think straight!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Z2：</span><br>
Indeed. We're so hungry that we're about to collapse from exhaustion.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Akagi：</span><br>
*Sigh*...<br>
Understandable. We can't let our dear guests go hungry. Noshiro, would you please guide them inside the island?<br>
After all, we wouldn't want them to miss the ritual...<br>

<br>
"Never lose faith." ...That is what Great Veteran Mikasa told me.<br>
I chose to have faith in my comrades. In Akagi, and in Kaga.<br>
But could they have betrayed us to the Sirens...?<br>
We've all been searching for the truth after what happened at "Sanctuary." <br>
Fortunately, Mikasa, Nagato, Mutsu, and Kawakaze... they trusted me.<br>
And those who I met in the Mirror Sea were all fine in the end...<br>
But, nobody else seems to remember any of that happening...<br>
You may not know anything about what is happening at this ceremony...<br>
Even if that's the case, please...<br>
... ... ...<br>
I just know you'll figure it out...<br>
A few days prior, in a Mirror Sea...<br>
The remnants of facilities that should not possibly exist in this era, cleaved apart cleanly by a flurry of masterful strokes, told a self-evident story.<br>
The Sirens had created yet another Mirror Sea.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">？？？：</span><br>
...Purification complete. Moving towards the next location.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Observer：</span><br>
Oh my, what a surprise. I didn't expect to see you here.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">？？？：</span><br>
......<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Observer：</span><br>
Hey, it's rude to ignore others when they're talking to you.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">？？？：</span><br>
...I have nothing to say to you.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Observer：</span><br>
Don't be like that. There's plennnty of things I'd like to talk to you about.<br>
Putting aside that Code G issue... Um, what was your name again, "Ember?" Are all of you like this?<br>
You just show up unannounced and start vandalizing other peoples' stuff. Don't you feel sorry for the one who has to rebuild all of this?<br>
Since you bunch showed up, my computational load and resource usage has gone up 314%, you know?<br>
The reason Code G summoned you here wasn't just to poke and prod at us, right?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">？？？：</span><br>
...So you came to learn more about her plans. Get lost, that has nothing to do with you.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Observer：</span><br>
Excuse me? Just take a look around us, and you're saying it has nothing to do with me?<br>
But it's fine. We don't have any further use for this place anyway, so have fun recycling it for us.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">？？？：</span><br>
......<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Observer：</span><br>
I already know where Code G is hiding.<br>
You might act like she sent you here to disrupt our operations, but...<br>
Why'd she go into hiding? Was it that shocking, meeting the "Commander" of this world?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">？？？：</span><br>
...Are you done running your trap?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Observer：</span><br>
Who knows? But this is the last working communication device in this area. I did have some important news for you, but if you don't want to hear it~<br>
Maybe I'll tell you just one more thing.<br>
The Sakura Empire is about to hold their "Dawning Ceremony."<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">？？？：</span><br>
What...?!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Observer：</span><br>
This time, will they receive the blessing of a god, or the curse of a demon?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">？？？：</span><br>
......<br>
If the overreliance upon these "gods" brings calamity to the world, I suppose it would be well-deserved.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Observer：</span><br>
That's not what you really think, is it? You know better, don't you?<br>
The entity that the humans named "Watatsumi"...<br>
Oh, and by the way, the Akagi of this world seems to have taken an interest in that stone as well~<br>
<br>
(The communication cuts off)<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">？？？：</span><br>
Wait, come back!<br>
......<br>
Once again, it seems like I must walk the tortuous path...!<br>

<br>
Diadem of Light - Sunset<br>
On the eve of the ceremony's commencement, a large banquet was held across the islands.<br>
The islands were well-equipped with facilities for holding various rituals and ceremonies.<br>
Despite the distance from the Sakura Empire's seat of power and prosperity, the banquet tonight seemed no less grandiose than the most sumptuous of Royal or Sardegnian feasts.<br>
However, this banquet was not for the merriment of its guests. It was the opening ceremony to a ritual; the first of many offerings to the gods.<br>
The reason the opening ceremony was turned into a welcoming banquet for guests from afar was simply out of convenience.<br>
Instead of celebrating, many of the participants were busy discussing the coming ceremony.<br>
Though the atmosphere seemed cordial on the surface, everyone was mindful of an almost-palpable tension.<br>
As was customary of so many of the Sakura Empire's ceremonies, one could not help but to act respectful.<br>
.........<br>
Banquet Venue<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Akagi：</span><br>
Ryuuhou, Noshiro, Suruga. I wanted to thank you for your work preparing the ritual.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ryuuhou：</span><br>
I only did what was expected of me as a proud citizen of the Sakura Empire. There is no need for thanks.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Noshiro：</span><br>
Indeed. If anything, you deserve our thanks, Akagi. We could only make the preparations because you convinced the higher-ups.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Suruga：</span><br>
And I am simply honored to be involved in the preparations you made possible. And, my goodness, you're even participating in the ritual yourself!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Akagi：</span><br>
Oh please, you flatter me so.<br>
Ah, how good it is to see you, Mikasa. I'm relieved to see you're in good health.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Mikasa：</span><br>
Hahah! Likewise. When I last saw you, you were serving–<br>
Sorry, never mind. I would hate to be a party pooper.<br>
Your heroic work in leading the Sakura Empire forward is truly commendable.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Akagi：</span><br>
Why, I appreciate your kind words, but I am simply doing as the gods instruct me to.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Mikasa：</span><br>
In the years I was away, you founded the Crimson Axis with the Iron Blood, began research on Siren technology, and even declared war on the Eagle Union and Royal Navy...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Akagi：</span><br>
Yes, and when you created the Reborn Combined Fleet, I let things run their course, just as the gods told me to.<br>
<br>
Akagi raised her cup to hide her lips then whispered a question to Mikasa.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Akagi：</span><br>
What are the odds that you would show yourself now of all times, having retired so long ago, Mikasa?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Mikasa：</span><br>
The Reborn Combined Fleet? That's just a side show of mine. You don't need to concern yourself with it.<br>
And what's so strange about me showing myself "now of all times"? I have as much right to be here as any other citizen of the Sakura Empire does.<br>
We are all concerned about the Sakura Empire's future and are prepared to do anything for it. Is that not so?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Akagi：</span><br>
Of course it is. By the way, I have been informed that Lady Nagato will not be attending the ritual.<br>
Rumors have circulated that she has already awoken from her slumber and is now under the care of your Reborn Combined Fleet. Though that is only a rumor, I have reason to–<br>
<br>
Akagi was interrupted by the sound of a loud crash.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Akagi：</span><br>
What was that?!<br>
<br>
Its cause: Zuikaku, hiding away in a corner of the venue. She had dropped her porcelain cup.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Shoukaku：</span><br>
I'm terribly sorry for the ruckus, Akagi! Zuikaku's hand slipped and she dropped her cup!<br>
How could you be so careless in front of everyone, Zuikaku?! Goodness... Please, pay us no heed. We shall be on our way now. Please enjoy the rest of the banquet~<br>
<br>
Zuikaku bowed in respect, then left the venue with Shoukaku without saying anything.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Mikasa：</span><br>
Sorry, that was an embarrassment on our part. I'd better apologize to our Iron Blood visitors, on behalf of Zuikaku.<br>
Though, I must say, I'm quite surprised to see you all the way out here...<br>
If you'll pardon the question: Is our cuisine to your liking?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Prinz Eugen：</span><br>
It's quite good, actually. This sake in particular has caught my attention.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Mikasa：</span><br>
As it would. It's made with malted rice and water, refined through a brewing method unique to the Sakura Empire.<br>
It is also often used in rituals, where it is given as an offering to the gods.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Prinz Eugen：</span><br>
Malted rice, you say... That explains why it tastes so different from beer.<br>
Should your journey ever take you to the Iron Blood, you should most certainly give our schwarzbier a try.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Mikasa：</span><br>
Ah, it's been long since I was last near your continent, much less the Iron Blood itself. Still, I have many fond memories of that time.<br>
Such as when my old friends and I enjoyed a banquet together with the Royal Navy! Hahahah!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Prinz Eugen：</span><br>
Let's not talk about those tea-swiggers, it gives me headaches. I'd rather flex my privileges as a guest here and savor your gourmet cooking.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Z2：</span><br>
Eugen, I brought a plate of sashimi. Would you like some?<br>
<br>
Z2, also known as Georg Thiele, was the girl tasked with assisting Prinz Eugen. Before even waiting for Eugen's answer, she put the plate of fish down on the table.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Mikasa：</span><br>
Oh dear, don't tell me you've...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Z2：</span><br>
Apparently, you're supposed to eat it with some of this paste spread on it. I believe it's called "wasabi"?<br>
I coated the sashimi in an even layer of it, as I believe you're supposed to.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Mikasa：</span><br>
Err, you've put far too much on it.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Prinz Eugen：</span><br>
Oh, really? Sorry, we're not particularly familiar with how to prepare these things.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Suruga：</span><br>
In that case, allow me to inform you! ...Please, Thiele, stop! Don't eat it!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Prinz Eugen：</span><br>
(That must be her... Suruga, the Kii-class battleship. So jittery, but in a charming way. Heheh...)<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Z2：</span><br>
Eugen, I've heard these skewers are quite good as well. I suggest we give them a taste.<br>
<br>
Suruga dragged Z2 off somewhere, but it didn't take long for her to sneak away. She then came back with a different plate of food.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Akagi：</span><br>
Please, enjoy the banquet to your heart's content. The night is still young~<br>

<br>
Diadem of Light - Banquet Venue<br>
As the night continued, everyone continued to enjoy the banquet until...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Suruga：</span><br>
As expected, Mikasa... You're always able to turn the tables in the face of adversity...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Mikasa：</span><br>
Hahahah! I was lucky to have survived, if you ask me! Avrora, meanwhile–<br>
<br>
BOOOOOM!<br>
Far from the banquet venue, the sound of a cannon echoed far and wide.<br>
The horizon was painted red and purple from muzzle flashes. Indistinct shadows rose from beneath the waves.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ryuuhou：</span><br>
What was that?! Are the Sirens attacking?!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Hibiki：</span><br>
Th-They are! Several fleets of them suddenly appeared just beyond the place I was standing guard!<br>
Kinu and Kasumi rallied some others and are on their way to intercept them!<br>
<br>
In the blink of an eye, the venue fell silent. The air became tense as the ships braced for combat.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Suruga：</span><br>
(I thought the islands were protected by a barrier? How did the Sirens get here?!)<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ryuuhou：</span><br>
Everyone, please remain calm! Our flawless defenses will protect us!<br>
Even if they should fail, we will keep you safe no matter what!<br>
Suruga, Noshiro, it's time to sortie, immediately!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">{namecode:50}&{namecode:175}：</span><br>
Understood!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ryuuhou：</span><br>
No Siren shall lay as much as a finger on our guests as long I stand!<br>

<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Noshiro：</span><br>
Take THIS!<br>
Suruga, are you hanging in there? This is your first battle with Sirens, isn't it?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Suruga：</span><br>
(I've fought against them countless times in simulations, but those were nowhere near as persistent as these things are!)<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ryuuhou：</span><br>
Agh...! There's no end to them! We sink one, and two take its place!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Suruga：</span><br>
(Just my luck! It's my first real battle, and I'm struggling to keep up! I should've never signed up for this thing!)<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">{namecode:179}：</span><br>
The Sirens haven't attacked the main islands for a long time, so I haven't had much experience with them...<br>
But now I know just how menacing they are...!<br>
Everyone! We need to hold this position and fight with everything we have!<br>

<span style="color:#4eb24e;">{namecode:179}：</span><br>
Kasumi! Kinu! You've held out well! Now get over here and–<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">{namecode:175}：</span><br>
Ryuuhou! Look out!<br>
<span style="color:#ec5d53;">{namecode:180}？：</span><br>
......<br>
<span style="color:#ec5d53;">{namecode:181}？：</span><br>
...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Noshiro：</span><br>
What are you doing?! Stop the friendly fire!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ryuuhou：</span><br>
I don't believe that was an accident... Something feels wrong about them...!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Suruga：</span><br>
Because "they" aren't Kasumi and Kinu! They're pawns the Sirens created based on their data!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ryuuhou：</span><br>
Of course... The Sirens always play dirty!<br>
Don't let their appearances fool you, everyone! Protect the islands from these impostors!<br>

<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Noshiro：</span><br>
Soulless puppets! Begone!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ryuuhou：</span><br>
We've swept this sector clean! Come on, we must hurry to the next one and provide support!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Noshiro：</span><br>
...Ryuuhou, what do you think the Sirens' goal is? Are they after... Watatsumi?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ryuuhou：</span><br>
They might be after the First and Fifth Carrier Divisions and Mikasa. But no matter what they're after or what they do, they shall not have it.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Noshiro：</span><br>
Of course not. We'll fight to the last... Wh-What's happening to the sky?!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ryuuhou：</span><br>
It's... turning purple?!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Noshiro：</span><br>
That doesn't seem to be all... Our instruments are starting to malfunction.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Suruga：</span><br>
What's happening...?!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Kinu：</span><br>
It's the Sirens' doing. We just got here from across the islands, and it seems this entire region has turned into a Mirror Sea.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ryuuhou：</span><br>
Kinu! Kasumi! Are you okay?!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">{namecode:181}：</span><br>
I'm fine. We took care of all the mass-produced units in our sector, then rushed over here when we spotted your recon planes.<br>
Abnormal weather phenomena, loss of communication with the outside... it's just like what the records said...<br>
But there's one key difference. Previously, Mirror Seas were known to only occur over water. There have been no instances of them covering the land as well.<br>
We may not be able to stop this Mirror Sea merely by defeating the Sirens this time. Ryuuhou, what should we do next?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">{namecode:179}：</span><br>
There's no time to think about that. The next wave of attacks is coming our way already.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">{namecode:50}：</span><br>
This area is surrounded by reefs... There's no way the Sirens should have been able to cross from underwater, so how did they...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">{namecode:179}：</span><br>
Kasumi, Suruga, come with me to assess the situation. The rest of you, establish a defensive line here!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Everyone：</span><br>
Aye aye!<br>

<br>
In a sea surrounded by darkness, two girls were trying to make their escape.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Nagato：</span><br>
Kawakaze!<br>
<br>
Shells from Siren battleships rained down ceaselessly around Kawakaze.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Kawakaze：</span><br>
Lady Nagato, please stand back! I shall deal with this!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Nagato：</span><br>
What are you saying?! Your equipment is already in tatters!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Kawakaze：</span><br>
Falling into the Sirens' trap and endangering Lady Nagato is an unforgivable sin...<br>
Allow me to atone for my transgressions with my life!<br>
<br>
The thunderous roar of a cannon was followed by an explosion...<br>
But when the smoke cleared, it was a mass-produced Sakura battleship that lay in ruins, not Kawakaze.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Kawakaze：</span><br>
Lady Nagato, why would you expend your power to protect me...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Nagato：</span><br>
What are you saying, you fool!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Kawakaze：</span><br>
Lady Nagato?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Nagato：</span><br>
I am Nagato, Nagato of the Sakura Empire!<br>
If I cannot protect even a single comrade, how am I to protect the Sakura Empire?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Kawakaze：</span><br>
Lady... Nagato...<br>
<br>
Having failed to secure the kill, the Siren battleship's movements stopped briefly. Seizing upon that moment...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Nagato：</span><br>
Witness the power of the Big Seven!<br>
<br>
BOOOM!!!<br>
The massive guns that bore the weight of protecting a nation rang out. Such power tore apart the enemy with ease.<br>
In an instant, the enemy forces were engulfed in a sea of fire, and the Siren siege began to fall apart.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Kawakaze：</span><br>
Lady Nagato, your power...!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Nagato：</span><br>
Kawakaze!!<br>
<br>
Nagato extended her hand to the injured Kawakaze, half towing her towards their escape route.<br>
...However, the enemies began to close in on the encumbered Nagato once more.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Kawakaze：</span><br>
Lady Nagato, please put me down! You must make it out!<br>
<br>
Ignoring Kawakaze's protests, Nagato raised her formidable rigging, firing back at the encroaching enemies while doing her best to avoid their barrage.<br>
As Nagato tried to carve out an escape route with her attacks, more Sirens quickly arose to take the place of the fallen.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Kawakaze：</span><br>
Lady Nagato!<br>
<br>
Kawakaze broke free from Nagato and used the last of her power to charge forward.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Kawakaze：</span><br>
The Sakura Empire needs you... Lady Nagato, you must live on...!<br>
<br>
——<br>
Suddenly, several bombs rained down upon the approaching Siren forces.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Zuikaku：</span><br>
While your spirit is commendable, you mustn't follow through with that!<br>
Do you know how sad Nagato would be if she lost you?!<br>
<br>
The night sky glowed brightly with explosions from Zuikaku's dive bombers, which brought an end to their crisis.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Kawakaze：</span><br>
Zuikaku... I am in your debt...<br>
<br>
In a mix of exhaustion and relief, Kawakaze fell into Zuikaku's bosom.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Nagato：</span><br>
Kawakaze!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Zuikaku：</span><br>
Don't worry. She's just overwhelmed from having strained herself.<br>
You can rest now. That's a good girl.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Nagato：</span><br>
You saved me once again... Thank you, Zuikaku.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Zuikaku：</span><br>
Ah, um, I just happened to be passing by!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Nagato：</span><br>
R-really?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Zuikaku：</span><br>
Yeah, I was just leaving the banquet when these Sirens suddenly showed up, so I thought I'd go teach them a lesson.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Kawakaze：</span><br>
Lady Nagato...<br>
If the Sirens are here, they must be after Watatsumi...<br>
There's no reason for you to go out of your way to take such a big risk...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Nagato：</span><br>
I disagree. I should be the one to conduct this ritual.<br>
More importantly, if the Sirens truly are after Watatsumi, we must never let their plans come to fruition.<br>
Zuikaku, can I leave Kawakaze with you? She needs to rest.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Zuikaku：</span><br>
Of course! Lady Nagato, Mikasa is waiting for you on the island!<br>

<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Suruga：</span><br>
Zuikaku?! It's not safe over there! Hurry up and get over here... huh?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ryuuhou：</span><br>
L-Lady Nagato?!<br>
<br>
The shocked ceremony hosts went rigid as they hurried to bow to Nagato.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Kasumi：</span><br>
Lady Nagato... This is Kasumi's first time... meeting you...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ryuuhou：</span><br>
Your appearance... I am utterly disappointed at myself for not protecting you from the Sirens!<br>
Lady Nagato, I had no idea you were coming, so I did not prepare an escort beforehand...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Nagato：</span><br>
Be at ease. I simply came here out of my own selfishness. You are not at fault here.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Suruga：</span><br>
I am relieved that you are here, Lady Nagato! We were at a loss as to what to do in case of an emergency...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Nagato：</span><br>
Hmm? What did you plan to do...?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Suruga：</span><br>
Um, if Shinano was unable to carry out the ritual, then the plan was to have Yamashiro do it...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Nagato：</span><br>
Yamashiro...? I see...<br>
Kawakaze, are you feeling better now?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Kawakaze：</span><br>
Yes. If it's just sailing, then I'll be ok...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Nagato：</span><br>
Then let us hurry to the Diadem of Light.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Kawakaze：</span><br>
Siren pawns... why now of all times...?!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ryuuhou：</span><br>
Leave this to us. Lady Nagato, please head to the island now.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Nagato：</span><br>
Very well. I'm counting on you!<br>

<br>
Diadem of Light<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Akagi：</span><br>
I see, so if I'm understanding this correctly, Nagato dragged herself all the way out here, got lost, and ran into trouble?<br>
Mikasa, if you wanted Nagato to come so badly, you could have prevented all of this if you simply asked her.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Mikasa：</span><br>
I just heard this from Zuikaku earlier. Besides, when Nagato has made her mind to do something, there's nothing we can do to stop her.<br>
However, Akagi... I must say, you look like you're quite enjoying this situation.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Akagi：</span><br>
Who knows? Everything is more interesting after a few drinks.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Kaga：</span><br>
Akagi...<br>
In any case, if Nagato is here, then I suppose we won't need Shinano to perform the ritual?<br>
In the first place, Yamashiro was just supposed to be the backup plan...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Yamashiro：</span><br>
Ehhhhhhh?!<br>
<br>
Yamashiro's tail went rigid with shock.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Yamashiro：</span><br>
Y-Yamashiro won't be doing the ritual?!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Akagi：</span><br>
You'll get to do the next best thing. Even if you don't get to perform the actual ritual, you can still recite blessings and whatnot.<br>
Why don't we give it a try? Hibiki, bring Watatsumi over here.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Hibiki：</span><br>
Y-yes ma'am!<br>
<br>
Hibiki dashed out of the building.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Prinz Eugen：</span><br>
Hmm, so this is this the legendary artifact I've heard so much about? The one that can call a ship with no history into existence?<br>
It'd be nice if it could help speed our Plan Z along~<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Z2：</span><br>
Eugen, have you had a bit much to drink?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Prinz Eugen：</span><br>
I haven't had enough, if anything~ Besides, I was just posing a hypothetical.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Z2：</span><br>
I'm sorry, everyone, please ignore what Eugen said.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Akagi：</span><br>
Hehe, we're all friends here. If you need anything, just let us know, and I'm sure something can be arranged.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Prinz Eugen：</span><br>
Oh my, are you sure about that? We wouldn't mind borrowing that "Watatsumi" of yours in that case. Ahaha~<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Mikasa：</span><br>
...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Shoukaku：</span><br>
(whispers) Someone seems to have led wolves into the room...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Mikasa：</span><br>
(whispers) What about Lady Nagato...?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Shoukaku：</span><br>
(whispers) We haven't heard anything after Zuikaku's initial communication due to the interference of the Mirror Sea.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Mikasa：</span><br>
(whispers) We'll have to place our faith in her then. Above all, I don't know what Akagi is planning, but we can't let them have Watatsumi.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Hibiki：</span><br>
One divine object, coming through!<br>
<br>
Upon hearing her words, the people gathered in the hall turned their eyes to Watatsumi, the atmosphere getting noticeably louder and more tense.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Z2：</span><br>
Eugen probably wouldn't be able to sail like this, so I'll take care of her for the time being.<br>
<br>
And with that, the others in the hall began to move towards another ceremonial site.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Z2：</span><br>
...<br>
Eugen, are you awake? It's time for us to make our move.<br>
Eugen...?<br>
Good grief...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Prinz Eugen：</span><br>
Nnh... huh......?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Z2：</span><br>
Did you really get yourself drunk? I suppose we'll have to leave empty-handed...<br>
What a terrifying bunch these Sakura Empire folks are...<br>

<span style="color:#4eb24e;">？？？：</span><br>
“They're wrapping around us! Hold them off at all costs!”<br>
<br>
There was something odd about her recollections.<br>
Their bodies were different. Their thoughts and their actions and their movements were different. They looked like humans, but they could not be further from the wisdom of humanity.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">？？？：</span><br>
Takao, let's retreat! We've been totally routed!<br>
Hold on a little longer! Reinforcements will arrive soon!<br>
<br>
Even the strongest weapon, without the "guidance" and "wisdom" of mankind, would be nothing more than a tool of indiscriminate destruction.<br>
Faced with the might of advanced weaponry as well as the violent forces of nature, the helpless girls could do nothing but retreat.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">？？？：</span><br>
What's that over there?! Some kind of wall?!<br>
Hold on!<br>
Th-this is...<br>
Is this... Watatsumi...?!<br>
...<br>
Accursed Sirens...!<br>
<br>
Diadem of Light - Ceremonial Hall<br>
Watatsumi, one of the sacred artifacts of the Sakura Empire, was brought out before one of the ceremonial halls.<br>
On the surface, there was nothing about this stone's appearance that appeared "sacred." It was a simple stone, navy-blue in color.<br>
Faintly it glowed, bathed in the light of the moon pouring through the window.<br>
Then, the silence was broken...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Hibiki：</span><br>
Now then, this ceremony shall now commence upon Akagi's orders on behalf of Ryuuhou, who is unable to join us tonight.<br>
This is just a rehearsal, Yamashiro! Come on, you're up!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Yamashiro：</span><br>
W-woah... this is the sacred artifact said to harbor the power of a sea god? Hmm, looks rather ordinary though...<br>
Um, everyone, please watch me conduct the ritual!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Everyone：</span><br>
"Lift your voices in praise of Watatsumi. Show your courage, and admire its wisdom."<br>
"Sing its praises so that it may guide us to the path of light."<br>
"May our lands be forever blessed to stave away calamity."<br>
<br>
ZAP!!<br>
As Yamashiro reached out to touch Watatsumi, she was repelled, as if pushed away by an unseen force.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Hibiki：</span><br>
H-huh?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Nagato：</span><br>
Cease this ceremony this instant! Step away from that stone!<br>
<br>
Nagato and Zuikaku rushed into the hall.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Mikasa：</span><br>
Nagato! You're safe!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Akagi：</span><br>
*tsk*...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Nagato：</span><br>
That stone is enchanted to repel everything except for those from the Sakura Empire! What are you?!<br>
<br>
Following Nagato's lead, the other ships at the hall sprung to their feet.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Yamashiro：</span><br>
Eh? Ehhhhhh?<br>
<br>
As if reality itself was peeling away, a figure - neither Iron Blood nor Sakura Empire - stepped forward from behind Yamashiro.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Observer：</span><br>
I was pretty confident about my disguise too. How unfortunate that it was seen through so easily~<br>
Everyone：<br>
Siren!!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Zuikaku：</span><br>
Did you sneak in like this? How cowardly!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Observer：</span><br>
Oh my, looks like my forces couldn't finish the job out there?<br>
What a pity... if that "Ember" girl hadn't gotten in my way, none of you would even be here right now.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Nagato：</span><br>
What do you plan to do with Watatsumi?!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Observer：</span><br>
Hehehe, who knows...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Kawakaze：</span><br>
Lady Nagato, watch out...!<br>
<br>
Before Observer had a chance to move, the roof of the ceremonial hall was ripped open by an explosion.<br>
Under the force of the blast, the wood and concrete of the ceiling sheared away, leaving the hall half-open.<br>
Fortunately, nobody was injured by falling debris.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Observer：</span><br>
I knew you'd come, "Ember." Hehehe... See, I knew there was a lot for us to talk about.<br>
<br>
As quickly as she entered, Observer seemed to melt into the environment and disappear.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Mikasa：</span><br>
Showing up and disappearing like ghosts... are there any other Sirens?<br>
<br>
Despite the sense of panic, everyone at the scene scanned their surroundings, preparing for further threats.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Kasumi：</span><br>
I'm sorry, Mikasa. I let an enemy slip through the line...<br>
Sorry... I didn't do my job...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Mikasa：</span><br>
Don't worry about it. Keep maintaining your guard around the island. Even if the elite Sirens are able to slip through, at least the mass-produced models won't be able to get through.<br>
(That "Ember" person that she mentioned... was she the one who attacked us...?)<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Hibiki：</span><br>
Um, excuse me! What should Hibiki do...?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Zuikaku：</span><br>
Stay here and protect Nagato and Watatsumi. Shoukaku and I will go intercept the attacking enemies!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Mikasa：</span><br>
Leave it to me!<br>

{{折叠面板|标题=Ember's Assault|选项=23|主框=1|样式=primary|展开=是}}
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Zuikaku：</span><br>
That "Ember" person was the one who destroyed our ceremonial hall?<br>
...that katana looked just like the ones we make in the Sakura Empire! Show yourself!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">？？？：</span><br>
... ... ...<br>
<br>
The mysterious ship turned around to face the sisters from the Fifth Carrier Division.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Zuikaku：</span><br>
You...?! But you're...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Shoukaku：</span><br>
A pawn with the same face as Takao...?<br>
No, you're not a pawn... You pushed Observer back with your attack earlier.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Zuikaku：</span><br>
She's equipped with Kansen rigging... Who are you, and what are you after? Why would you attack us?<br>
Speak up already! Otherwise...<br>
We'll have to do this the hard way!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">？？？：</span><br>
Who I am is irrelevant. I have two objectives.<br>
First, I will not let Observer have the stone. Second...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Shoukaku：</span><br>
(She even has the same voice as Takao...?)<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Zuikaku：</span><br>
The second?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">？？？：</span><br>
Yes... that damn stone...<br>
Watatsumi... I shall destroy it.<br>

<br>
……<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Zuikaku：</span><br>
Guh...!<br>
<br>
……<br>
Across the Mirror Seas, black and white shadows danced in a roar of steel and flame.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Zuikaku：</span><br>
...Without the use of my aircraft, all I can do is fight her hand-to-hand...! And even with Shoukaku's support, it's taking everything I have just to parry her blows...!<br>
This person is monstrously strong...!!<br>
<span style="color:#ec5d53;">？？？：</span><br>
I have no intention of clashing with you. However...<br>
If you would hinder my objectives - the destruction of Watatsumi, then...<br>
You shall taste my swordsmanship!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Shoukaku：</span><br>
Zuikaku!<br>
<br>
……<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Zuikaku：</span><br>
Shoukaku!!<br>
<span style="color:#ec5d53;">？？？：</span><br>
Remember this well: If you rely exceedingly on your rigging, then you shall become incompetent.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Shoukaku：</span><br>
Zuikaku, it's fine... only our equipment and our clothes have sustained any damage...<br>
You're Takao, aren't you? Why are you trying to destroy one of the Sakura Empire's relics? What happened to you?<br>
<br>
Upon hearing that name, "Ember" stopped moving and spun around.<br>
<span style="color:#ec5d53;">？？？：</span><br>
...My name... No, that codename... I haven't heard it for a long time.<br>
...But speaking of that name, "Takao"...<br>
It is just a seal of wishful thinking that the humans imposed upon us.<br>
If those people were to disappear...<br>
Then that name...<br>
Becomes meaningless!!<br>
<br>
!!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Zuikaku：</span><br>
Gaah...! Sh-she's even stronger than... the Grey Ghost!<br>
<br>
！！<br>
<span style="color:#ec5d53;">？？？：</span><br>
...Reinforcements?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Kinu：</span><br>
Don't you dare lay a finger on our friends!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Zuikaku：</span><br>
Everyone, be careful! She's not like anything we've faced before!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ryuuhou：</span><br>
Yes, that's why we must fight! Let me handle the aerial support!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Suruga：</span><br>
You won't win with an attitude like that, Zuikaku!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Kasumi：</span><br>
Kasumi... and Foo as well... will do our best!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Zuikaku：</span><br>
Hah... it won't be a fair fight with all of you here, but...<br>
...the most important thing right now is protecting Watatsumi!<br>
{{折叠面板|内容结束}}

{{折叠面板|标题=Cut Time|选项=25|主框=1|样式=primary|展开=是}}
<span style="color:#ec5d53;">？？？：</span><br>
Not bad...! But I don't have any more time to waste here...<br>
<br>
Under the withering firepower of all the Sakura Empire ships, "Takao" was unable to approach the island.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Zuikaku：</span><br>
We won't let you through!<br>
<span style="color:#ec5d53;">？？？：</span><br>
You WILL stand aside...!<br>
<br>
Zuikaku rushed to block off "Takao," who had suddenly broken away from the fight to rush straight towards Watatsumi.<br>
The instant their eyes met, it was as if time had stopped flowing...<br>
...Zuikaku felt herself falling, and "Takao" blurred past her, charging forward at full speed.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Shoukaku：</span><br>
Zuikaku! Are you hurt?!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Zuikaku：</span><br>
I, I'm fine, but... what just happened...?!<br>
(I didn't feel any sort of pressure from her, but when I reached out to strike...)<br>
(No, it was the moment I saw her eyes... my body wouldn't move...)<br>
......<br>
(Am I... scared of her...?!)<br>

<br>
Diadem of Light - Ceremonial Hall<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Hibiki：</span><br>
Woah... this place is a dump... It's going to be hard to get Watatsumi out...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Nagato：</span><br>
Indeed. Worst case scenario, we will have to conduct the ceremony right here anyway...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Hibiki：</span><br>
Lady Nagato, please hold on for a moment! I'll go dig up the ritual objects! Heave, ho...!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Kawakaze：</span><br>
You're quite hardy for a destroyer...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Hibiki：</span><br>
Ehehe~ Ryuuhou often puts me through worse, so this is nothing for me!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Akagi：</span><br>
Mikasa, are you worried about something?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Mikasa：</span><br>
Yes, it's about this ritual, but I can't quite place my finger on it...<br>
There's... something off about all of this.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Akagi：</span><br>
It must be serious if it's even bothering the Great Veteran~<br>
I didn't really have anything special in mind. After all, the ceremony to tap into Watatsumi's power has always been more of a celebration, hasn't it?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Mikasa：</span><br>
Mmhm, I am in agreement. What a travesty it would be to become dependent upon the gods. We must create the future we want with our own hands.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Akagi：</span><br>
Hehe, I knew that if anyone would understand, it'd be you, Great Veteran Mikasa.<br>
Allow me to come clean about this ceremony. Though I have taken the initiative in using Siren technology, everything I do is for the sake of the Sakura Empire's future.<br>
Using the power of the gods... No, growing addicted and reliant upon the gods' blessings... the Sakura Empire has no future if we continue to follow the old ways.<br>
What I desire is a world free from that... and I'm sure "that person" sees things the same way.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Mikasa：</span><br>
But know this, Akagi. If the Sirens' technology was truly capable of bringing about the future you seek, I would have sided with you.<br>
From what I have seen, you are not the one using the Sirens. They are the ones using you.<br>
...The Sirens' power is intoxicating. It is easy to control, but it is just as easy to lose yourself to it.<br>
The path you walk is now distorted. I fear that if you continue down this path, you will soon turn your blade against your own people.<br>
And I am sure that you would not want "that person" to see you like that.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Akagi：</span><br>
Pardon me for saying this, Mikasa, but...<br>
What exactly is this "righteous path" that is spoken of so highly in the Sakura Empire?<br>
Would you condemn yourself to a future within the Azur Lane, content to merely break even with the Sirens, settling with a false peace, and pretending to be friends?<br>
While people are still willing to fight, we must press forward. Otherwise, we will be shackled and enslaved one day.<br>
Mikasa, are you saying that all the sacrifices that we've had to make so far were unavoidable?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Hibiki：</span><br>
Wooooaaaahhhh!<br>
<br>
！！<br>
Hibiki, who was in the process of preparing for the ceremony's continuation, made her grand entrance... on the verge of tumbling over.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Hibiki：</span><br>
Sorry about that! Lost my balance again for a moment! <br>
Oh, Lady Nagato, I've finished the preparations for the rehearsal ceremony!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Nagato：</span><br>
Nagato - the head miko of the Sakura Empire - and Kawakaze, followed Hibiki to the center of the ceremony hall.<br>
All of you have acted with the Sakura Empire's best interests in mind, and I know this fact better than anyone else. That is why, at least during this ceremony, let us make peace with one another.<br>
Not just for my sake, but also for each other. That is the way to please the gods.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Akagi：</span><br>
.........<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Nagato：</span><br>
Nagato faced Watatsumi and offered a prayer for the Sakura Empire.<br>
"Lift your voices in praise of Watatsumi. Show your courage, and admire its wisdom."<br>
"Sing its praises so that it may guide us to the path of light."<br>
"May our lands be forever blessed to stave away calamity."<br>
<br>
...But nothing seemed to happen.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Nagato：</span><br>
As I thought... My words alone are not enough to reach the gods.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ryuuhou：</span><br>
Mikasa! The enemy known as "Ember" managed to escape from us... and she's headed towards --<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Mikasa：</span><br>
What?!<br>
<br>
——<br>
"Ember" suddenly appeared at the entrance to the ceremony hall, and everyone turned to face her in shock...<br>
...everyone, except for Akagi and Kaga.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Mikasa：</span><br>
You're... Takao?!<br>
<span style="color:#ec5d53;">？？？：</span><br>
Lady Nagato, stand down. I do not wish to point my blade at my people.<br>
<br>
Nagato fearlessly placed herself between "Ember" and Watatsumi, signaling her intent to protect it.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Nagato：</span><br>
Unless you state your reason for seeking Watatsumi's destruction, I cannot yield to you.<br>
<span style="color:#ec5d53;">？？？：</span><br>
...The thing known as "Watatsumi" is not a sacred artifact, but a manifestation of calamity.<br>
By feeding upon the negative emotions throughout the land, it eventually ushers forth untold destruction.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Nagato：</span><br>
This ritual long predates my existence. I cannot simply take your word at face value.<br>
<span style="color:#ec5d53;">？？？：</span><br>
That history is false. This stone does not exist in your world.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Nagato：</span><br>
...What...?!<br>
<span style="color:#ec5d53;">？？？：</span><br>
...Come forth!<br>
A blade extended towards Nagato at an inhuman speed.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Kawakaze：</span><br>
Lady Nagato!<br>
Kawakaze drew her sword, her reflexes surging as she tried to intercept the attack.<br>
<br>
！！<br>
A silence soon fell across the room. Mikasa and Hibiki, who both began to run forward, came to a stop.<br>
As if lightning had struck, the deed was done before anyone in the hall could react.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Akagi：</span><br>
......<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Kawakaze：</span><br>
Lady Nagato... is unharmed...?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Nagato：</span><br>
I am fine.<br>
<br>
Watatsumi, still hidden behind Nagato's back, was cleanly split in half.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Nagato：</span><br>
No... Watatsumi...!<br>
<span style="color:#ec5d53;">？？？：</span><br>
...This is a fake. Did you hide the real one away beforehand?<br>
A regular stone coated luminescent paint, tinkered with some Siren technology, and imbued with a Sakura Empire defensive charm...<br>
Hmph... Looks like I've wasted my time here.<br>

<br>
A few days later<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Prinz Eugen：</span><br>
So in the end, their ritual still failed?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Z2：</span><br>
Seems like it was impossible after all.<br>
Nobody expected that the "Watatsumi" used in that ritual was a fake. Now the entire Sakura Empire is in turmoil because of it.<br>
Thanks to a certain Prinz Inebriated, I didn't get the full details.<br>
We'll be heading home empty-handed now, mission failed and all that. She's probably going to yell at us too.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Prinz Eugen：</span><br>
Thiele, I wasn't drunk. I was merely acting.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Z2：</span><br>
You could have challenged Lebe to a hibernation contest with how far gone you were. Impressive acting.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Prinz Eugen：</span><br>
...Don't tell anyone about this...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Z2：</span><br>
I know, I know. It's just between the two of us.<br>
Z2 and Eugen, who both knew they were going to be in deep trouble, purchased a copious amount of Sakura Empire sake on their way back.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Prinz Eugen：</span><br>
But you know, I wouldn't call this "leaving empty-handed." After all, we learned some valuable information about the "Reborn Combined Fleet," the internal structure of the Sakura Empire, and even found out about their newest ship.<br>
With this amount of information, who cares about some backwater ritual? On top of that, I also dropped some hints about "that plan" of ours.<br>
I'm sure there is someone who would be willing to negotiate with us in that regard...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Akagi：</span><br>
Prinz Eugen, at least give me some time to think this over...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Prinz Eugen：</span><br>
My my, if it isn't Akagi from the Sakura Empire? If you're here to send us off, we don't need *that* much hospitality.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Akagi：</span><br>
Some things are best discussed away from prying eyes.<br>
I'll be straightforward. I want more information regarding the Iron Blood's ships, as well as everything you know about the Sirens.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Prinz Eugen：</span><br>
You're asking for quite a lot there... Even if the Iron Blood and the Sakura Empire are allies, I can't just give you all that information so readily.<br>
But, I wonder... what kind of price is the Sakura Empire willing to pay for this information?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Akagi：</span><br>
Well, let's talk about that request you made at the banquet.<br>
...Watatsumi. You said you wanted to see what you could do with it, right?<br>

<br>
Diadem of Light - A few days later<br>
After the conclusion of the ceremony, a special gathering was held for those who fought bravely against the Sirens.<br>
Mikasa also forced(?) Nagato to attend.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ryuuhou：</span><br>
Lady Mikasa! Thank you for taking the time to make the journey all the way out here!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Mikasa：</span><br>
Indeed. I also squared off against that "Ember" character! Ahaha!<br>
However, now that we know that there are stronger enemies out there than the Sirens, we will have to train harder than ever before.<br>
<br>
……<br>
——！！<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Kawakaze：</span><br>
That "Takao"... had such terrifying strength, even without the use of rigging...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Zuikaku：</span><br>
Yeah... Shoukaku and I together couldn't even hold her back. I would not want to fight her alone.<br>
We have Grey Ghosts, Blue Ghosts, and now this... Crazy strong folks just keep popping up one after another! Ahahaha!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Shoukaku：</span><br>
Zuikaku, I've finished cooking~ Everyone, let's all go eat~<br>
<br>
The venue was livelier than ever as the delicious aroma of tempura and traditional pastries mingled with the sounds of merriment.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Zuikaku：</span><br>
I'm sorry, Shoukaku! My skills... they're still lacking...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Shoukaku：</span><br>
Zuikaku apologized, thinking back to when she was almost cut by "Ember."<br>
It's not your fault, Zuikaku. None of us could have stood against someone that strong. Rather, I'm just thankful that you're alive.<br>
Besides, I like being able to nurse you back to health~<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Zuikaku：</span><br>
Shoukaku...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Shoukaku：</span><br>
Hehe, as your big sister, seeing you try your hardest fills my heart with pride~<br>
That's why, for your sake, I'll continue to live on as well, Zuikaku~♪<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Zuikaku：</span><br>
Shoukaku, don't plant your own death flag!<br>
<br>
Meanwhile, two figures were sitting on the other side of the venue.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Kawakaze：</span><br>
Lady Nagato, there are no words that can express my remorse.<br>
Not only did I expose you to danger, but I also could not protect you at a crucial moment...<br>
I have lost my qualifications to serve as your escort, Lady Nagato...!<br>
<br>
Kawakaze bowed her head until she could only see the ground.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Nagato：</span><br>
You have not.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Kawakaze：</span><br>
……<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Nagato：</span><br>
If you do not have the qualifications to be an escort, then the Royal Knights, as well as Iris's Chevaliers, would have to disband.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Kawakaze：</span><br>
Lady Nagato...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Nagato：</span><br>
In other words, there is nobody I would rather have as an escort than you!<br>
Therefore, please continue your efforts as my escort!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Kawakaze：</span><br>
...Yes, Lady Nagato!<br>
<br>
Though such words may not be particularly encouraging or comforting to some, to Kawakaze, those few words were the greatest compliment she could receive.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Kawakaze：</span><br>
I will do my best to meet your expectations, Lady Nagato!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Nagato：</span><br>
...Good, now stand straight.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ryuuhou：</span><br>
I suppose this concludes another chapter of our lives.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Mikasa：</span><br>
Guess so. Hard to believe so much happened in such a short period of time...<br>
Hmm, I wonder if fighting the Sirens back in ancient times was also like this.<br>
...Sorry, I'm just getting sentimental.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ryuuhou：</span><br>
But, without Watatsumi, it won't be possible for us to hold the Dawning Ceremony...<br>
I just don't get it. Who did this, and when? Why would they take something so important to us?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Mikasa：</span><br>
According to Nagato, that stone can only be touched by someone from the Sakura Empire. If that's the case, then everyone at the ceremonial hall that day is a suspect.<br>
Mm, if you ask me, I'd say that it was Akagi or Kaga who did it.<br>
......But, you know, that would be hard to prove.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ryuuhou：</span><br>
Akagi, and Kaga...?!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Mikasa：</span><br>
That's right. Of course, I have no hard proof, but they've been acting strangely ever since the formation of the Reborn Combined Fleet. Would you happen to know anything about it, Ryuuhou?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ryuuhou：</span><br>
Now that I think about it, Akagi and Kaga were the first ones to leave the island when they went to send off the Iron Blood guests. But after that...<br>
Hibiki... Well, I just can't see a girl like her doing something like that.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Mikasa：</span><br>
.........<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Kasumi：</span><br>
Ah, um...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Noshiro：</span><br>
Kasumi, what's the matter?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Kasumi：</span><br>
Just now... um...<br>
Lady Shinano seems to have woken up?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Suruga：</span><br>
Great, I managed to make it to the end without drawing too much attention to myself!<br>
By the way, why did you choose Shinano to host the ceremony? Was it because of her overwhelming power? Even so, there was no way she was going to be ready in time.<br>
Nagato then rushed over anyway after hearing that. Could it be that someone knew that all of this would happen from the very beginning?<br>
Well, in the end, these rituals are out of my area of expertise! Let's just take it easy and not dive too deeply into these things~ Phew...<br>
