<br>
In the Sakura Empire's Sanctuary, an heir to great power stood amidst comfort and luxury.<br>
Standing in a pagoda that stretched towards the heavens, a black-haired woman rested her hand against the railing, casting her eyes across the sea of clouds below.<br>
The first rays of morning's light pushed through the clouds, leaving a slender shadow across the wooden floorboards.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">???：</span><br>
A storm is coming...<br>
<br>
Ominous clouds loomed on the horizon. In this still and silent world, there was no wind brushing against her cheek, no chirping of birds reaching her ears.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">???：</span><br>
The world within this barrier will not be affected... but I'm afraid the blossoms outside will be torn from their branches.<br>
<br>
Alas, this was no time for her to wallow in sentimentality. Just as she was about to turn around and head back inside, she heard the cries of a lone and lost bird.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">???：</span><br>
A swallow? It must be seeking shelter.<br>
<br>
She reached out to the swallow and the fragile creature came down and perched on her finger.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">???：</span><br>
If you've come here in search of shelter, I'm afraid you've made a mistake.<br>
As seasons change, storms take shape – sunshine can turn into rain in the blink of an eye. One won't last long, fleeing from place to place without a plan.<br>
The barrier surrounding this pagoda protects only the strong. It will keep me safe, but offers no relief to you.<br>
<br>
Her words carried no meaning to the swallow, and yet, it nodded as though it understood.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">???：</span><br>
"My time is now. O Heavens, hear my vow. When I rise, all shall bow."<br>
I applaud your poetry, Musashi. I must say though, the verses are a bit ominous.<br>
<br>
Musashi – battleship of the Yamato class now holding the seat of the Combined Fleet flagship – looked behind her.<br>
Though she should've been alone, a voice spoke to her from nearby.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Musashi：</span><br>
There's no meaning to them beyond the picture they paint. More importantly, have our guests arrived yet?<br>
<span style="color:#a020f0;">???：</span><br>
Yes. They're waiting outside the barrier, so I suggest we proceed to the next stage. *cough* *cough*...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Musashi：</span><br>
Of course.<br>
<br>
Silence returned to the pagoda's top floor. Musashi extended her arm and gently shook her finger, sending the swallow away.<br>
*knock knock*<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Sakawa：</span><br>
I've come to report. Akagi and her party have arrived outside the barrier. Wakatsuki is guiding them around.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Musashi：</span><br>
Alright. Head to the reception room. I'll be there soon.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Sakawa：</span><br>
As you say!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Musashi：</span><br>
......<br>
So you're the first to arrive, Akagi.<br>
The barrier will not protect the weak from the storm...<br>
So instead, I will protect you myself. Heehee.<br>
<br>
Three invitations were sent out across the Sakura Empire.<br>
One to Mikasa, who was in pursuit of truth with nothing more than fragmented legends in hand.<br>
One to Nagato, who was searching for signs of Sirens around the Sacred Sakura's seal.<br>
And one to Akagi, who had witnessed the Iron Blood's rebellion against the Sirens and returned home with the Watatsumi in hand.<br>
Penned by Musashi, the invitations beckoned to a fateful encounter in the Sanctuary.<br>
Each person was allowed to bring five others.<br>
All would converge here for a game with higher stakes than they could imagine.<br>

<br>
Sanctuary Pagoda - Reception Room<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Wakatsuki：</span><br>
Here it is, Lady Nagato and Lady Mikasa.<br>
<br>
Sliding the door aside, Mikasa and Nagato were surprised to see that Akagi and Musashi were already seated inside the room.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Mikasa：</span><br>
You arrived before us, Akagi? Here I thought you'd be the last to show up.<br>
You must've been raring to go, now that your business trip to Europa is finally over. Hahaha!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Akagi：</span><br>
While it's delightful to see you in good health, Great Veteran, we'll have to skip the pleasantries.<br>
This exercise is tremendously important, and we must not keep Musashi waiting.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Nagato：</span><br>
Forgive our late arrival, Musashi. I am to blame for it.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Musashi：</span><br>
It's of no consequence. Akagi and I were just enjoying a pleasant chat.<br>
You've all come ahead of time, so there is nothing to be ashamed about. Now, come join us.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Nagato：</span><br>
If you consider it fine, then I shall too...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Wakatsuki：</span><br>
Lady Nagato, Lady Mikasa, I've brought you tea.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Nagato：</span><br>
Why, I'll be... It smells lovely.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Mikasa：</span><br>
Aye, this aroma dispels my travel fatigue with one sniff. Who brewed this? Wakatsuki?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Musashi：</span><br>
Hanazuki made it. Although she did struggle to pick the right leaves to use, so I felt I had to give her a helping hand.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Mikasa：</span><br>
Did you? Then one could say this tea, much like our invitations, was made by your hand.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Musashi：</span><br>
Perhaps one could, perhaps one could not. We each chose our own leaves – once mixed, it's not so easy to determine whose are to thank for the aroma.<br>
If you like the tea, then it's Hanazuki you should compliment, not me.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Mikasa：</span><br>
You needn't be so humble. It's as you say, I can't easily determine whose leaves make it so fragrant. My sense of smell is not so discerning.<br>
<br>
As the four were enjoying their tea, a holographic Go board suddenly took form atop the table they'd gathered around.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">{namecode:91}：</span><br>
I see we're ready to begin the exercise.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">{namecode:82}：</span><br>
Is this one of those "hollow-grams?" I assume this is the way we will resolve the differences between our ideologies?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">{namecode:74}：</span><br>
It looks quite detailed. Musashi, does this board reflect what's happening inside the exercise area?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">{namecode:84}：</span><br>
Quite perceptive. I'm impressed you were able to tell at a glance.<br>
I'm sure you all saw the landscape reflected in this hologram on your way here.<br>
We will be holding our exercise in a special "domain" beneath this pagoda, and this board relays everything that happens within it.<br>
As we speak, Sakawa is briefing all the participants and guiding them to their respective starting areas.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">{namecode:82}：</span><br>
Interesting... I was wondering how exactly we would command our troops without being physically present.<br>
So, what is our goal here, and how do we achieve it?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">{namecode:84}：</span><br>
It's as I said in the invitation. You are to command your troops and earn as many points as possible. The side with the most points at the end is the winner.<br>
This exercise will reflect the quality of our leadership – and at times, our very thoughts.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">{namecode:82}：</span><br>
Our thoughts? How are we supposed to affect our troops with thoughts alone?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">{namecode:84}：</span><br>
Your conviction and your mental imagery, if strong enough, can change the nature of the domain, though there are some limitations to what can be done.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">{namecode:91}：</span><br>
Actions speak louder than words, right? So, this exercise will be a clash of our true feelings.<br>
I can already speculate the Reborn Combined Fleet will focus on protecting each other, while Mikasa here will prioritize making her battleships even stronger.<br>
Considering she brought so many battleships here, I can already surmise what she's thinking.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">{namecode:82}：</span><br>
I didn't consciously pick a majority of battleships. I simply gathered a group of people I trust, and this is what I ended up with.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">{namecode:74}：</span><br>
As nothing is hidden on the board, that means all our troops and their strength are evident from the start, yes?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">{namecode:84}：</span><br>
That's right. You can hide your intent, but you cannot hide your identity.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">{namecode:74}：</span><br>
I see... Though, I must question what the purpose of this is, Musashi. Are you assuming Mikasa and I will join forces?<br>
If we started working together, Akagi would be at a huge disadvantage from the beginning. That should be patently clear.<br>
But if it is balance you strive for, I can see you siding with her.<br>
On a related note, I see your composition is almost solely aircraft carriers, Akagi.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">{namecode:91}：</span><br>
Like Mikasa, I didn't think too deeply about it. Besides, both sides have aircraft carriers, so it's fair.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">{namecode:74}：</span><br>
Would you really call it that? You have four, whereas we only have one.<br>
We could've had another, had Zuikaku not been sent away...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Communicator：</span><br>
Beep–––<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">{namecode:84}：</span><br>
Hello, Sakawa. Is everything ready over there?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">{namecode:226}：</span><br>
Sure is! Everyone is in their starting positions and waiting for orders. Me included!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">{namecode:84}：</span><br>
Very well. Thank you.<br>
<br>
Musashi rested her hand on the board. Every player's troops and their accompanying mass-produced ships had a distinctive, glowing aura beneath them.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">{namecode:84}：</span><br>
Let me clarify a few rules once more. You may perform actions on this board to issue orders to your troops. Your orders will be relayed to them through the communicators there. Certain special commands will have greater effects on the board, but have more restrictions to their use.<br>
You may also give them your orders verbally if you'd like. However, they cannot communicate back. The only information you can gain from them is what's shown on the board.<br>
If you wish to see how your troops are faring, there is only one way – earnestly wishing to join them.<br>
By the way, if you'd like to reposition your troops before the match truly starts, now is your last chance.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">{namecode:74}：</span><br>
And special commands, I presume, can only be issued once a turn when your turn comes?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">{namecode:84}：</span><br>
Correct. The purpose of this restriction is to make the match easier to follow. Otherwise, chaos would ensue.<br>
I should also mention that all our orders, unless spoken aloud, are secret until they're displayed on the board.<br>
It's your choice whether you wish to declare them for the other players to hear. When or if you do so is up to your discretion.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">{namecode:74}：</span><br>
I see... I'm left with a few questions now.<br>
Firstly, you said something about earning points to win earlier. Do we get these points by securing bases?<br>
Secondly, if you move to a spot already occupied by another player's troops... what happens then?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">{namecode:82}：</span><br>
To my knowledge... Yes, the more bases you hold, the more points you get. As for your second question...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">{namecode:91}：</span><br>
Nothing in particular happens. But if you insist on getting in someone's way, expect a fight. Similarly, eliminating your foes to prevent them from capturing your bases is a valid strategy.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">{namecode:84}：</span><br>
Correct. Speaking of the bases, they start out occupied by enemies hostile to all of us. You must eliminate them before you can capture a base.<br>
If you're worried about your troops getting hurt as a result of this exercise, don't be. All damage is merely simulated.<br>
Incapacitated troops can choose to stay on the board, but will not be able to partake in combat.<br>
Furthermore, you will not be able to send her orders, and she will lose all effects granted to her by the domain.<br>
For all intents and purposes, they can no longer participate in the game. Preferably, they'll simply exit the board area.<br>
To reiterate, don't fear for the well-being of your troops. Simply focus on winning this game.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">{namecode:74}：</span><br>
Very well. If that's the truth, then Mikasa and I will hold nothing back.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">{namecode:91}：</span><br>
Likewise. Now that everyone is on the same page, shall we finally start?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">{namecode:84}：</span><br>
I've said all I wanted to, so without further ado... let the game begin.<br>
The first move is yours, Akagi.<br>

<br>
Exercise Area - Turn 1 (Akagi's Action)<br>
In the distance, black clouds churned unpredictably around imposing mechanical castles, a strange and unsettling scenery worthy of a Siren test site.<br>
Even more bizarrely, beams of various colors of light literally "cut" the exercise area up into distinct grid-like sectors.<br>
Each different sector had a point value that would ultimately determine victory or defeat in this exercise.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ryuuhou：</span><br>
What is this place...? I've never seen anything like it in any of the Mirror Seas I've encountered...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Kaga：</span><br>
If I remember correctly, this was a "gift" that Akagi gave to Musashi. But how did she manage to turn it into something like this...?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ryuuhou：</span><br>
Wait, look over there... Is that the Diadem of Light? It looks completely different, but I'd never mix up that distinctive silhouette!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Yamashiro：</span><br>
Wow, you're right! This place seems to have been built by drawing on the motifs from some of the Sakura Empire's most sacred sites!<br>
Look, that place looks like our shrine... and there's also Akagi's estate over there!<br>
And is that the Sacred Sakura? ––Oh wow, even the Dragon Palace we found not too long ago is here!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ryuuhou：</span><br>
The great sakura tree of the Guardian Fox... I've never been there myself, but I heard Lady Nagato was once sealed within that place.<br>
That's before Zuikaku and the Reborn Combined Fleet reawakened her, anyway.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Yamashiro：</span><br>
Yeah! I heard all about it!<br>
Hmm... Now that I think about it, I've been feeling a little strange ever since coming here. I think my combat performance might be getting tweaked or something?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Miyuki：</span><br>
Mmhmm... I think we were assigned the role of "subordinates," so our specs might have been adjusted for fairness...<br>
Otherwise, capital ships would have an overwhelming advantage, and carriers would be able to wreak havoc from afar...<br>
That's why I think... Our equipment and specifications aren't actually reflective of our actual performance, but are special conditions imposed in this exercise.<br>
B-but, because of that, maybe I can finally be useful for a change...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Yamashiro：</span><br>
I see! So that's why I can equip planes now! Heh heh, I never get to do this stuff normally so I'll have to make every moment count~<br>
Thanks for the explanation, Miyuki!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Miyuki：</span><br>
D-don't mention it, as long as I can be of use to someone...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Yamashiro：</span><br>
You're doing great! I'm not sure how much of a difference I'll be able to make either, but let's both do our best, okay?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Jintsuu：</span><br>
Each and every one of us has her own role to play. In this exercise, we will not be testing each others' might, but rather making our thoughts known to each other in a clash of wits.<br>
As such, we are not only responsible for how we fight, but also if and when we fight.<br>
If we are to clash, our motivations and rationale may prove to be more important than the equipment we field and the tactics we employ in combat.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Yamashiro：</span><br>
Motivations, huh? Alright! So basically, if we just try our best and think about what kind of orders we'd be given, then everything should be fine, right?<br>
I've always wanted to feel what it's like to have a more active role on the battlefield, so I'm really excited to test these planes out!<br>
Oh, but, since we're supposed to use our heads and not our weapons, I'll try my best not to land us into a sticky situation!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Jintsuu：</span><br>
It's good to keep that in mind, but being overly cautious can be disadvantageous as well.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Yamashiro：</span><br>
Eh?! How do I know what to do then...?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Jintsuu：</span><br>
Uhh, I wouldn't worry about it too much. Just trust your gut instinct.<br>
<br>
Suddenly, a symbol appeared in the sky bearing the image of a lightning bolt.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Yamashiro：</span><br>
Woah, what in the world is that?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Miyuki：</span><br>
That... must be Akagi's special command. In other words, she's empowering us to carry out her orders...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Kaga：</span><br>
Correct. "Make haste and capture the nearest sector." We're moving out, everyone.<br>
{{折叠面板|内容结束}}

<br>
Exercise Area - Turn 1 (Mikasa's Action)<br>
As soon as Akagi's sigil faded from the sky above the exercise area, her subordinates quickly sprung to action.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Haguro：</span><br>
Woah, look at that huge symbol... Akagi's trying to get an advantage right from the get-go...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Hatakaze：</span><br>
That's the way Akagi's always liked to do things, like a crimson storm sweeping through the battlefield.<br>
But, seizing the initiative is a sensible strategy. Since all of the fleets start far away from each other, expanding your territory first provides benefits later on down the road.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Haguro：</span><br>
Yes, but you'll still have to defeat mass-produced ships before you can occupy another sector.<br>
Umm, let's see... The central tower is worth ten points, the four major sacred sites are worth five points each, and the other bases are only worth one point each.<br>
That means that Akagi, Nagato, Musashi, and Mikasa will be fighting over a total of fifty possible points.<br>
You're right, it does make sense to expand first. Whoever can get near the center first has first pick of the higher-value bases.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Kinu：</span><br>
Calm down. Mikasa likes taking things in a slow and controlled manner, so she surely has something in mind.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Kongou：</span><br>
She's also more cautious than Akagi by nature. I wouldn't be surprised if she doesn't issue a special command this turn at all.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Kinu：</span><br>
Why's that? Are we not going to compete for the central tower?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Kongou：</span><br>
Not yet. It's not our turn anyway, so all we can do is keep an eye out for our opponents' strategy and plan our moves accordingly.<br>
Knowing the way Mikasa does things, we'll probably find our opportunity to strike later on in this match.<br>
After all, Mikasa might only fire one shot in the time someone else fires a hundred, but she'll make that one shot count.<br>
Until then, our key priority should be to support Nagato, maintain the board state, and prevent anyone else from running away with a huge lead.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Hatakaze：</span><br>
I see... We'll be opting for a control-type strategy then and wait for the rush strategy to run out of steam.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Kirishima：</span><br>
It's also important to note that Akagi's fleet does not seem to be prioritizing the central tower.<br>
By the looks of things, she's clearing out the sector closer to Musashi's side, as if she's trying to make it easier for the two of them to work together.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Hatakaze：</span><br>
That makes sense. Akagi might be trying to cooperate with Musashi the same way Mikasa is allying with Nagato.<br>
Interesting, we'll have a two-versus-two on our hands... How will Mikasa react to this situation?<br>
<br>
The beams of light around the exercise area began to change, signifying the beginning of Mikasa's turn.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Kinu：</span><br>
...Looks like it's our move now.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Kirishima：</span><br>
Right. Akagi's subordinates won't be able to move from their current location until the start of their next turn.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Haguro：</span><br>
And, you're right, I didn't see Mikasa's sigil light up in the sky, so she must not be opting to use a special command this turn.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Kongou：</span><br>
We'll be following the same plan as before then. For now, we'll capture sector AB56 and move forward towards Akagi's territory.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Haguro：</span><br>
Why are we moving towards Akagi? Weren't we going to support Nagato like you said earlier?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Hatakaze：</span><br>
I suppose this is a case of the best defense being a good offense? Putting pressure on Akagi is the best way of making her think twice about her next move.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Kongou：</span><br>
I don't think Musashi is going to threaten Nagato right away, so this also prevents us from getting flanked by Akagi's forces later.<br>
Akagi will now have to weigh her offensive options with defending her territory. A classic Mikasa strategy, if I must say so myself.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Haguro：</span><br>
It's a classic sword-and-shield strategy! I'd expect nothing less from the Great Veteran herself!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Kongou：</span><br>
Let's make sure we're all clear on the instructions before we set out.<br>
{{折叠面板|内容结束}}

<br>
Exercise Area - Turn 1 (Nagato's Action)<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Hiei：</span><br>
So, Akagi, Mikasa, Nagato, and then Musashi each take their turns in that order... I wonder if there's any special reasoning behind that.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Haruna：</span><br>
You're probably just overcomplicating things again. I bet that's just the order they're sitting around the table.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Hiei：</span><br>
Can you be sure that the order they arrived at the table was not predetermined as well?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Haruna：</span><br>
Do you think... Musashi has some other plan in mind?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Hiei：</span><br>
That I cannot say. I do tend to overthink things after all, just as you said.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Haruna：</span><br>
I sure hope so... By the way, Nagato seems to be mirroring Mikasa's move and attacking Musashi from the side.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Nagato：</span><br>
Not quite. Listen well to my command:<br>
Haruna and Harutsuki will move towards Musashi's territory and halt her forces from advancing.<br>
We will move our mass-produced ships to surround the Sacred Sakura.<br>
Hiei, Kawakaze, and Shoukaku are to make preparations to capture the adjacent base on our next action.<br>
After that, we will consolidate our forces to launch a frontal assault on our enemy's defenses.<br>
To that end, I shall see to it that we sustain no losses this turn.<br>
<br>
As soon as Nagato's communication ended, a shield symbol appeared in the sky, and barriers of light materialized around Nagato's forces.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Kawakaze：</span><br>
Lady Nagato's blessings are with us!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Shoukaku：</span><br>
As long as this barrier holds, we'll easily be able to take the adjacent base without sustaining any damage.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Haruna：</span><br>
Despite being defense-oriented, Nagato doesn't believe in the wait-and-see approach.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Hiei：</span><br>
A proactive strategy that seeks to neutralize threats while ensuring everyone's safety...<br>
That must be the vision Lady Nagato has for the future. How very much like her, heehee.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Harutsuki：</span><br>
That's right. Plus, Lady Nagato issued the orders to us herself, unlike Akagi and Mikasa.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Hiei：</span><br>
It's as if she is personally joining us on the battlefield... What a charismatic leader she has become.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Kawakaze：</span><br>
The Guardian Fox has spoken her will! Do not hesitate, and carry out your instructions!<br>
<br>
Exercise Area - Turn 1 (Nagato's Action)<br>
On the game board, a diamond-shaped "base" sits between the intersection of four squares.<br>
A Siren vessel defends each base, and the surrounding sectors must be controlled first before the base can be captured.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Kawakaze：</span><br>
Just another Conductor vessel, huh? I've faced plenty of these in the Mirror Seas.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Haruna：</span><br>
Great, a humanoid Siren. I was starting to get tired of smashing these mass-produced ships.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Shoukaku：</span><br>
Don't get too cocky. We might be able to wipe these Sirens out with ease normally, but remember - our rigging isn't as powerful as usual. We also don't know if those Sirens have been enhanced in any way.<br>
What I'm curious about is how we managed to get our hands on so many Siren vessels...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Haruna：</span><br>
Well, they don't seem to have the hostile aura most Sirens give off. Does that mean we figured out a way to control them?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Shoukaku：</span><br>
"Miracles exist beyond the boundary of reality."<br>
Musashi said something along those lines, but she tends to wax philosophical. Knowing Akagi's involvement in this exercise, it wouldn't surprise me if we're actually inside a Siren research facility.<br>
While I have no objections to using a Mirror Sea for training purposes...<br>
We should be wary of any real Sirens sneaking in and making a mess of things, like they did with that Iron Blood experiment.<br>
*sigh*... I really hope Akagi isn't getting us into some terrible mess.<br>
Zuikaku's awfully protective of Lady Nagato, and if something were to happen to her under my watch, I would never hear the end of it.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Hiei：</span><br>
I doubt there's anything substantial you have to worry about. I heard this exercise area reflects the mental state of its participants.<br>
This is a good opportunity to learn about what Akagi's after, so all we need to do is to remain vigilant.<br>

Exercise Area - Turn 1 (Musashi's Action)<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Chiyoda：</span><br>
So, we've got our orders from Musashi. Doesn't look like she'll be using a special command this turn either, yeah?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Suzutsuki ：</span><br>
Waiting for our opportunity to strike is a pretty sensible decision, isn't it?<br>
Wakatsuki, do you wanna lead the advance on the nearest base?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Wakatsuki：</span><br>
You've got it! Just leave it to me!<br>
<br>
After receiving her order, Wakatsuki stepped forward from the formation of mass-produced ships, leading them towards the base on the adjacent diamond.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Sakawa：</span><br>
Musashi has chosen a very different strategy from the other three players...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Suzutsuki ：</span><br>
Huh? How can you tell from just the opening move?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Sakawa：</span><br>
Well, I obviously don't know what her endgame is, but she seems to want to capture the Dragon Palace as quickly as possible. Nobody else is positioning themselves to do that yet, right?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Suzutsuki ：</span><br>
I see. Once you capture a base, it can't be taken over by somebody else, so it makes sense to target the highest-value areas first!<br>
The smaller bases are only worth one point each, but capturing a sacred site is worth five whole points! That'll be a huge lead!<br>
It's still too early for there to be any clashes between the fleets, but once that happens, it'll be harder to plan ahead.<br>
If we can capture as many points as possible before that happens, we'll have a lot more options to choose from even if the situation gets pretty chaotic!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Sakawa：</span><br>
Right. And if we exhaust all our strength from fighting each other, it'll be harder to take down the Sirens guarding each base.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Suzutsuki ：</span><br>
Well said! As long as things go smoothly, we'll also reach the central tower before anybody else! Lady Musashi's wisdom is not to be underestimated!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Sakawa：</span><br>
S-see, I already knew all of that! That's why Musashi has chosen a strategy the others haven't grasped!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Suzutsuki ：</span><br>
So, now that everyone has taken their first turn, who do you think is winning?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Sakawa：</span><br>
I dunno, this is the first time any of us are playing a game like this, no?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Suzutsuki ：</span><br>
It just occurred to me, our victory's practically guaranteed once we take the central tower, right? What's stopping everyone from just rushing straight there?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Sakawa：</span><br>
Well, none of us would be able to get 15 points without butting heads.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Suzutsuki ：</span><br>
Yeah. We need to be especially wary of Akagi as well. Chitose, Chiyoda, what do you two think? Akagi wouldn't just hand Musashi victory on a silver platter, would she?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Chitose：</span><br>
I, I have no idea... Akagi can be kind-hearted at times and terrifying at others, as if she has two sides to her...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Chiyoda：</span><br>
Haha, there's no way shmucks like us could ever figure out what Akagi is thinking~<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Sakawa：</span><br>
That's true, but don't you think Musashi gives off pretty similar vibes?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Suzutsuki ：</span><br>
I can see that... Hey, do you remember what Musashi told us right before this exercise began?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Musashi：</span><br>
Sakawa, Wakatsuki, Suzutsuki, Chitose, and Chiyoda. I trust the five of you to act as my retainers for this exercise.<br>
All you need to do is to follow my orders, like pieces on a Go board.<br>
Simply keep your eyes in front of you. Relinquish your thoughts, and enjoy the experience about to unfold - no matter what happens.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Sakawa：</span><br>
"Enjoy the experience about to unfold," huh? The way she put it makes it seem like we're watching a movie or something.<br>
I've participated in a lot of drills and exercises before, but this is like a completely different game with a whole other set of rules...<br>
It's like we stepped into an entirely new world when we entered Musashi's domain.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Chiyoda：</span><br>
Y'know what rubbed me the wrong way? How Musashi said "no matter what happens." It's almost as if she's foreshadowing that something IS going to happen.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Sakawa：</span><br>
Hmm, that does sound a little questionable. But what's the worst that could happen? It's not like any of us could actually get hurt inside this exercise area.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Chiyoda：</span><br>
Yeah, but we're not actually playing Go here. We actually have to fight, and getting hit by blanks still hurts!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Sakawa：</span><br>
Meh. It wouldn't be a naval exercise without some stakes.<br>
The one thing I can say for certain is, if anything is actually happening behind the scenes, that's for the players to decide. We're just the pieces on the board, so there's nothing we can do anyway.<br>
Now that I think about it, when's the last time we've seen Nagato, Mikasa, Akagi, and Musashi in one room? Quite literally the stars aligning, right?<br>
We've even got replicas of some of the Sakura Empire's most sacred sites here, and the design of the surrounding sectors seem to reflect the architecture of the nearest sacred site.<br>
There really is a lot of great scenery to soak in, if not for the dark and ominous clouds and whatnot. Who knows, maybe Musashi is really impressed with the way this place turned out and actually is just telling us to enjoy ourselves?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Suzutsuki ：</span><br>
No matter what happens, huh... There must be some surprise at the end!<br>
(I'm not sure if I'm overthinking this, but... when she says for us to "enjoy the experience," does that mean it doesn't matter if we win or lose? What does Musashi even stand to gain from all this?)<br>
(I was told that this place reflects the mental state of the participants... Does that mean we'll be able to find clues as to what Musashi is thinking...?)<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Wakatsuki：</span><br>
Um, hello? Excuse me? I've arrived at the designated location!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Suzutsuki ：</span><br>
Oh, Wakatsuki! Do you have visuals on the base's defender?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Wakatsuki：</span><br>
Y-yes, I can see the target clearly! Umm, it appears to be a Tester vessel!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Sakawa：</span><br>
A Tester model? Those aren't usually known for their combat capabilities, but I wonder what specs this one has... Let's go find out!<br>
It's been fun chatting and all, but we've got a job to do here~!<br>

<br>
Sanctuary Pagoda - Reception Room<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">{namecode:82}：</span><br>
So you decided to forego the smaller bases closer to you to go directly for the Dragon Palace. Mmhmm, a bold move.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">{namecode:84}：</span><br>
One cannot rest at ease until she completely controls the flow of battle. Don't you also know this to be true, Great Veteran?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">{namecode:82}：</span><br>
Who knows? You may find that flow to be too mighty and tumultuous to grasp. Can your fleet of five take down a high-ranking vessel?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">{namecode:84}：</span><br>
That... is when you shall witness the strength of my resolve. That node will fall to me as early as my next turn.<br>
Besides, Nagato was kind enough to leave plenty of breathing room for me. I would be foolish not to capitalize on that.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">{namecode:74}：</span><br>
If you are not posturing to attack me, then there is no reason for me to make the first move.<br>
If anything, I would prefer to strike down these augmented mass-produced Sirens first.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">{namecode:84}：</span><br>
That would be advantageous to me as well. Though mass-produced ships they may be, Siren technology is never to be underestimated, especially under these conditions.<br>
The mass-produced ships we face are stronger than what we encountered at the Diadem of Light.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">{namecode:74}：</span><br>
The way Siren technology progresses is, admittedly, beyond my understanding.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">{namecode:84}：</span><br>
Then shall we meet up some time? I would be glad to show you how to dismantle these vessels firsthand.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">{namecode:74}：</span><br>
Very well, if that is convenient for you.<br>
Hmm... I must say, your retainers seem to be struggling, Musashi.<br>
You said that you expect to capture the Dragon Palace on your next turn, but the results of your gambit seem less than satisfactory.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">{namecode:84}：</span><br>
That is a possibility I foresaw. It appears luck was not on my side this time.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">{namecode:82}：</span><br>
I guess that means your forces are now stuck on that space the next turn. You tried to bite off more than you could chew, and it ended up backfiring. Hahaha!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">{namecode:84}：</span><br>
Heh. It was an unfortunate miscalculation, as you said. It would be a pity if you decide to attack me while I am vulnerable.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">{namecode:82}：</span><br>
What are you saying? Only Nagato and Akagi even have the option to attack you. I'm on the other side of the board.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">{namecode:91}：</span><br>
What reason would I have to harm poor Musashi here? Oh, Nagato, would you mind handing the communicator back?<br>
It's not like you actually need it, right? Your retainers will receive your orders as long as you will it.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">{namecode:74}：</span><br>
I am aware. I just do not like this cold, impersonal way of doing things.<br>
Our friends are not mere pawns on a chessboard. They are living, breathing people, just like us.<br>
Is it against the rules for me to directly issue my orders when I am at a disadvantage for disclosing them to the rest of you?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">{namecode:91}：</span><br>
Of course not. After all, the fact that you've chosen to "disclose" your plans may well be part of your larger strategy.<br>
I will say though, Nagato, being tied up with trivial things like decorum... may end up clouding your judgment during critical moments.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">{namecode:74}：</span><br>
...Like whether to take aim at my own friends?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">{namecode:91}：</span><br>
If you truly seek to lead the Sakura Empire to a brighter future... then you may find yourself confronted with that choice, whether you want to or not.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">{namecode:74}：</span><br>
...We shall see.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">{namecode:84}：</span><br>
Then, that concludes my turn. It's back to you, Akagi.<br>

Exercise Area, Dragon Palace Base - Turn 2 (Musashi's Action)<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Wakatsuki：</span><br>
I, I'm coming through! W-Wakatsuki-style secret technique – Twin-Blade Tornado!<br>
<br>
KABOOM––––!!<br>
Wakatsuki swung her single katana with as much resolve as it took to name her secret technique.<br>
Her body blurred into a flash of blue light, a flurry of blows raining down onto the Tester vessel as if she indeed was wielding two blades.<br>
The Siren vessel staggered back, as if struck senseless both by the ferocity of the attack and how unexpected it was.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Sakawa：</span><br>
Wh-what the heck was THAT, Wakatsuki?!<br>
You've been hiding that from us this whole time?! We'll never have to worry about the Sirens again if you can pull that off every day!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Wakatsuki：</span><br>
Um... I have no idea how that happened either... I just knew I had to defeat that enemy, and was thinking about a show I watched the other day...<br>
Is this what Musashi meant by this place being able to "reflect your mental state?"<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Chitose：</span><br>
So, um... You thought about defeating the enemy using a special killer move...? C-could you teach me how to do that as well...?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Wakatsuki：</span><br>
Umm... Well, I had an idea of what I wanted to do in my head...<br>
So then I swung my katana, and before I knew it, I was unleashing blow after blow into the enemy...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Chitose：</span><br>
Wow... I wish I could come up with a special move for myself as well...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Chiyoda：</span><br>
There's no need to worry about that, sis!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Sakawa：</span><br>
Hmm? Did you come up with something good?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Chiyoda：</span><br>
This might seem a bit obvious, but we've always had great teamwork together, right? Next time, let's try launching a combo attack together and see what happens!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Chitose：</span><br>
That last attack felt a lot better than usual... We didn't even land all our attacks, but there's already a noticeable difference...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Chiyoda：</span><br>
Sakawa, you should come up with a special move as well! We might never get another chance to do something this cool ever again!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Sakawa：</span><br>
That's true... In that case, allow me to demonstrate my "Demon-Banishing Slash," a dazzling display of swordsmanship that does not pale at all before Wakatsuki's technique.<br>
Wait, hold on a sec... I shouldn't waste my ace-in-the-hole technique right here and now.<br>
By the way, how do we even activate our special abilities anyway? Do we have to call out their names or something?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Wakatsuki：</span><br>
I'd assume not, but shouting the name should form a clearer image of the ability in your mind.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Sakawa：</span><br>
Makes sense. Chiyoda and Chitose didn't have to shout anything out.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Chiyoda：</span><br>
Hey, it's not like we were trying to come up with a special technique anyway? Chitose and I are in sync, so we already have the mental imagery of how we want to fight with each other.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Sakawa：</span><br>
Thanks for the tip. I'll keep that in mind!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Suzutsuki ：</span><br>
Wait, Tester still hasn't been defeated, right? We got too caught up in the moment!<br>
<br>
When everyone turned around, Wakatsuki, who had just landed a devastating blow on the Tester vessel, was nowhere to be found. Instead––<br>
Her position in the vanguard of the fleet had been replaced by Suzutsuki, a ring of light beneath her feet symbolizing the usage of a special command.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Suzutsuki ：</span><br>
Woah, woah, how'd I get here all of a sudden?<br>
I was wondering where Wakatsuki went off to, but turns out we swapped positions!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Sakawa：</span><br>
Maybe Musashi was afraid of Wakatsuki getting too badly damaged and swapped her with Suzutsuki.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Suzutsuki ：</span><br>
That's fine by me. I was just looking for an opportunity to test out my special technique too! Suzutsuki, causing confusion! Unparalleled Blade-Dance!<br>
I love having aerial targets to aim at as well. Luckily, this Siren has a bunch of floating cannons, so I'm really able to show off my keen aim! Too bad there's only one enemy though...<br>
Well, as long as I get to do what I'm best at, I'm one happy camper!<br>
Now that I'm here, you have the strength of a hundred ships on your side! I'll be taking your mark, Wakatsuki!<br>

{{折叠面板|标题=Sea Fog|选项=9|主框=1|样式=primary|展开=是}}
<br>
Exercise Area - Turn 3 (Akagi's Action)<br>
At the start of Akagi's turn, a cloud symbol appeared above the exercise area, blanketing the entire domain in a thick sea fog.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Yamashiro：</span><br>
Wh-wh-where'd all this fog come from all of a sudden?!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Jintsuu：</span><br>
This symbol must be a manifestation of Akagi's will.<br>
As far as I can tell, the sea fog is spreading through the entire exercise area... Akagi has already used two special commands, so we've got to make the most out of this powerful effect.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Yamashiro：</span><br>
Um, are you sure we're going to be fine? Don't the Sirens usually deploy sea fog like this before launching an attack?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Jintsuu：</span><br>
Yes, which is why we should check on our communication equipment. Siren sea fog almost always has a jamming effect.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Kaga：</span><br>
All my communication equipment, sensors, and electronics are operating normally. This seems to be nothing more than ordinary fog.<br>
Well, it's too early to make that conclusion. If this is a manifestation of Akagi's will, she must be trying to secure a significant advantage for us.<br>
I know Akagi better than anyone else. She is trying to create a situation ideal for our carriers, something that the other players cannot take advantage of.<br>
The fog is thin, sitting just above the water's surface. It does not interfere with our ability to operate carrier-based aircraft, and our planes will be free from the fog's effects as soon as we launch them.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ryuuhou：</span><br>
But the fog is still dense enough to prevent the others from reading our movements.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Kaga：</span><br>
Indeed. We will now be able to secretly capture surrounding bases without committing as many resources to each one.<br>
With the exception of the central tower and the strongholds, individual nodes only have low-ranking humanoid enemies and can be easily defeated by any of us alone.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Miyuki：</span><br>
Th-then, I'll go towards Mikasa's forces to try to capture the base between her and Lady Nagato...<br>
I, I'd rather not go alone, but if Akagi wants us to divide and conquer, then...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Kaga：</span><br>
You'll be fine, Miyuki. I'll cover you from a distance if necessary.<br>
Under this arrangement, our forces will be spread thin and we won't always be able to help each other out. But, Akagi always has THAT option.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ryuuhou：</span><br>
What do you mean?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Kaga：</span><br>
During this exercise, the players have the advantage of not only being able to survey the entire battlefield, but can also observe their opponents to try to gain a mental edge over them.<br>
However, they may also choose to give up those advantages and directly enter the battlefield to assist their forces.<br>
That's right. If Akagi wishes to take matters into her own hands, she too will descend upon this battle.<br>

<br>
Exercise Area - Turn 3 (Mikasa's Action)<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Kinu：</span><br>
Look at that fog... Assuming this isn't the Sirens' doing, Akagi must be up to something major.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Haguro：</span><br>
I agree with that assessment. Before the fog fully set in, my recon planes saw signs of Akagi's ships moving.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Hatakaze：</span><br>
She probably thinks she's so clever using a smokescreen to conceal her moves, but we're onto her!<br>
If we huddle here all scared and let Akagi do whatever she wants, she could potentially take five points' worth of bases this turn.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Kinu：</span><br>
So she can pick and choose her targets freely, regardless of where her ships are deployed... So this is how she's leveraging her fleet of carriers?!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Kirishima：</span><br>
That's not all. By spreading her forces out, she's gained control of the middle area first, effectively gating who is allowed to move into Musashi's territory.<br>
If we still want to meet up with Nagato's forces, we'll either have to brute-force our way through the center of the battlefield or find another way around.<br>
But look - Musashi won't even be able to move at all without running into either Akagi's or Nagato's forces. I thought they were supposed to be working together?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Hatakaze：</span><br>
It's as if Akagi is trying to contain Musashi as well... Is this also a part of her strategy?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Haguro：</span><br>
Nagato is still maintaining her defensive line on the other side of Musashi's territory.<br>
Since we're allied with Nagato, she has a lot of options available to her.<br>
But now that Akagi is threatening large swaths of the battlefield with her sea fog, she might decide to respond to that first.<br>
Ugh, trying to read the situation is giving me a headache... I was told that all I had to do was follow the orders.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Kirishima：</span><br>
We ARE the ones actually doing the fighting, after all. It's inevitable that we'll have to make our own assessments.<br>
If we truly were to just follow orders without thinking, we'd be nothing more than Pawns. And at that point, why not use actual Pawns?<br>
To be honest, the biggest question mark right now is Musashi.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Kinu：</span><br>
That's right. She hasn't tipped her hand at all despite being threatened the most.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Hatakaze：</span><br>
I think she benefits when the situation gets harder to read. The more complex the battlefield, the more uncertainties there are. Maybe that's exactly what Musashi is after.<br>
Precisely because everyone is able to see everyone else's moves on this board, every move breeds suspicion.<br>
<br>
At that time, a symbol appeared above the sacred site nearest to Mikasa's territory, ordering her nearby forces to focus their attacks on it.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Kongou：</span><br>
Listen up, everyone, we have an order from Mikasa!<br>
<br>
Mikasa's instructions were clear - all forces are to converge on the Diadem of Light and capture it.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Haguro：</span><br>
All right, we're going for some big points! Looks like Mikasa is finally getting her head in the game!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Kinu：</span><br>
That's what I like to see! With Mikasa at the helm, we can't lose!<br>
Now then, we'll prepare to attack the Diadem of Light, and split Akagi's forces down the middle while we're at it.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Kongou：</span><br>
Excellent. I wonder if we're going to also make an attempt to capture the central tower after we seal off Akagi's ability to mount a counterattack.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Haguro：</span><br>
If we're also going for the central tower, that means we'll directly engage with Akagi's fleet...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Hatakaze：</span><br>
We don't know for sure if that's actually what Akagi is going for, but this move at least matches her aggression.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Haguro：</span><br>
Turning Akagi's strategy against her, huh? You've still got it in you, old timer!<br>

Exercise Area - Turn 3 (Nagato's Action)<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Kawakaze：</span><br>
...This sea fog throws a wrench in our plans.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Shoukaku：</span><br>
Crafting an environment that only benefits carriers such as herself... I'd expect nothing else from that crafty woman.<br>
Oh, I almost forgot, I'm also a carrier, so it won't affect me negatively. Now if only Zuikaku were here, *sigh*...<br>
By the way, Musashi was the one who ordered Zuikaku to pay a visit to Iron Blood before this exercise, right?<br>
*gasp*... Do you think she purposefully did that to split us up?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Haruna：</span><br>
I think you're overthinking things... This is just a naval exercise, isn't it? Why would Musashi arrange a whole diplomatic move over an elaborate game of Go?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Shoukaku：</span><br>
Musashi never struck me as that kind of person, but when Akagi is involved, you never know!<br>
It wouldn't surprise me if some of that vixen's craftiness rubbed off on Musashi... Though, I suppose I shouldn't be throwing baseless accusations around...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Hiei：</span><br>
Right, it's hard enough to focus on what's going on in front of us. We can't see Musashi's fleet through all the fog...<br>
If Musashi takes advantage of the fog to slip her forces closer to us...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Nagato：</span><br>
Listen well, everyone. I shall now tell you our countermeasures for Akagi's sea fog.<br>
Haruna will patrol the territory adjacent to Musashi's forces after capturing the base there.<br>
Hiei, Kawakaze, and Harutsuki will retreat to provide backup for Shoukaku while fending off Musashi's fleet.<br>
We must prevent Musashi from taking the Sacred Sakura under the cover of fog.<br>
Shoukaku will solidify her position using our mass-produced ships.<br>
I already know what Akagi seeks to do, but if I were to disclose it, she would change her actions accordingly.<br>
Remain vigilant, but carry out the instructions I just gave you. Take control of the surrounding bases.<br>
<br>
When Nagato's voice disappeared, new symbols appeared around Shoukaku.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Harutsuki：</span><br>
Wow... This must be the protection of the gods... I mean, of the Guardian Fox!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Haruna：</span><br>
Since Shoukaku is the core of Nagato's strategy this turn, she's being funneled all our power and resources!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Shoukaku：</span><br>
(I feel a tremendous amount of power welling up within me... What exactly IS this exercise area?)<br>
(Does nobody else feel something strange about this? How are we supposed to get any practical training done when you can "will" incredible power into existence here?)<br>
(Well, I'll worry about it later. Maybe the Commander knows a thing or two about what's going on~)<br>

<span style="color:#4eb24e;">{namecode:74}：</span><br>
You'll grant me another point for taking control of this base, yes?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">{namecode:84}：</span><br>
Even with the interference of the sea fog, you still took advantage of the situation to solidify your defenses while capturing nearby bases. Impressive work.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">{namecode:74}：</span><br>
Only carriers are able to operate effectively under these conditions. I had to maneuver accordingly.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">{namecode:84}：</span><br>
You protected your friends and expanded your influence. Your spirit is commendable.<br>
But your mistake was not capturing all the bases adjacent to my territory. If you wanted to prevent me from reaching the Sacred Sakura, you should have ensured there are no gaps in your visibility.<br>
Under the fog, slipping past a few patrol ships is a trifling matter.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">{namecode:74}：</span><br>
Are your forces not preoccupied with the defenders at the Dragon Palace?<br>
Do you plan to abandon that course of action and make a straight march towards my territory?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">{namecode:84}：</span><br>
Good observation. My fleet will be tied down until the Dragon Palace is taken.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">{namecode:82}：</span><br>
Unless you never planned on taking it in the first place, right?<br>
You were planning to give those nodes to Akagi, but she's not taking you up on your offer.<br>
Speaking of Akagi, I can't understand why she would take the bases closest to your territory first. Aren't the two of you supposed to be working together?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">{namecode:91}：</span><br>
I don't recall ever agreeing to an alliance with Musashi, Mikasa.<br>
The only thing that matters in this game is victory - friends and foes simply change the dynamics of how to achieve that victory.<br>
I can tell that you're maneuvering to try to contain me, but there's no point for me to entertain you.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">{namecode:82}：</span><br>
That's one way to look at it. We could've worked through our differences in another manner, but you chose to deploy this sea fog in order to obfuscate your moves from me.<br>
Does that not prove you do not trust me?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">{namecode:91}：</span><br>
Who knows? I'm sure you of all people already know what I'm trying to accomplish, whether or not you can see my actions.<br>
I will say this once more - I will achieve victory using the means I deem appropriate.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">{namecode:84}：</span><br>
As you can see, Mikasa, Akagi has the resolve to carry the Sakura Empire through rain and storm.<br>
She cares not if she is set back or humiliated, and continues to push forward regardless. That is a spirit worth looking up to.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">{namecode:74}：</span><br>
What is the real reason you're doing this, Musashi?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">{namecode:84}：</span><br>
While victory depends on who captures holds the most points at the end, there is no rule saying that you cannot have your retainers fight directly.<br>
When shipgirls clash with the full extent of their mental fortitude and will-given form, what we actually witness is a contest of courage and determination.<br>
Just as Nagato's desire to protect Shoukaku made her stronger, my fleet has developed their powers through the confidence I instilled within them.<br>
<br>
As Suzutsuki and her allies became more familiar with their special techniques, the Tester vessel was taken down in no time, and the Dragon Palace soon fell to Musashi's forces.<br>
Sakawa and Wakatsuki, freed from their previous battle, quickly made their way towards Nagato's territory just as Musashi had ordered.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">{namecode:74}：</span><br>
Ugh... Where did those two come from?<br>
That area is only defended by Harutsuki and Kawakaze... Musashi, are you...<br>
Going to force our friends to fight each other?!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">{namecode:84}：</span><br>
Force? Hardly. This was just a natural consequence of Akagi deploying her sea fog, and you deciding to reveal your commands to the rest of us.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">{namecode:74}：</span><br>
I won't let you have your way!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">{namecode:84}：</span><br>
Try me then. Show me what determination the child-made-guardian is capable of mustering.<br>

<br>
Exercise Area - Turn 3 (Musashi's Action)<br>
Taking advantage of the thick sea fog, Musashi's "retainers," Sakawa and Wakatsuki, crossed over to launch a surprise attack on the area occupied by Nagato's fleet.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Shoukaku：</span><br>
Harutsuki! Kawakaze! Musashi's forces are headed towards you!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Harutsuki：</span><br>
G-got it! But, where are they coming from? I can't really see through all this fog...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Kawakaze：</span><br>
They're coming straight at us! Prepare for combat, Harutsuki!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Harutsuki：</span><br>
H-huuuh?!<br>
<br>
As soon as Kawakaze drew her blade, Sakawa and Wakatsuki burst from the fog.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Sakawa：</span><br>
Hello there, Nagato's retainers~!<br>
I'm the Agano-class light cruiser, Sakawa. Let's have a fair fight, okay?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Wakatsuki：</span><br>
And I'm the Akizuki-class destroyer, Wakatsuki. Sorry for barging in all of a sudden, Harutsuki.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Harutsuki：</span><br>
I'll be fine... Probably...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Kawakaze：</span><br>
Harutsuki, remain alert. We're not allies anymore, for the time being.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Sakawa：</span><br>
Well, we don't necessarily have to fight, right? Musashi only ordered for us to move to this area.<br>
Plus, we just finished taking the Dragon Palace. I could use some extra time for rest and recovery~<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Harutsuki：</span><br>
Phew... I'd like to avoid conflict if possible...<br>
<br>
Unlike Harutsuki, who sighed in relief and lowered her weapons, Kawakaze remained vigilant and poised to strike.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Kawakaze：</span><br>
It's true that we're in top shape whereas you've sustained some damage from your previous battle.<br>
If you don't want to fight, I certainly won't force you to.<br>
But don't come a single step closer. Those are Lady Nagato's orders.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Sakawa：</span><br>
I see... So you've been ordered to hold us back. Hmm... I know you're strong, but are you strong enough to stop both of us?<br>
<br>
Hiei, who was situated in a nearby grid, heard the impending clash through her communication device.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Hiei：</span><br>
Nagato, you correctly anticipated Musashi's move, but you didn't fully plan for the effects of the sea fog.<br>
If you chose to launch an all-out attack in the fog, you would've been able to inflict more damage. However, that would prevent you from securing enough bases to pin Musashi in.<br>
It must've been a difficult decision, but you wanted to avoid fighting your own friends.<br>
The sea fog will clear soon, and now, it remains to be seen what kind of decision Musashi will make.<br>
<br>
The white veil that blanketed the sea began to thin out and disperse, until finally––<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Hiei：</span><br>
The sound of fighting...?! Does that mean...<br>
Musashi, you actually decided to pull the trigger?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Sakawa：</span><br>
Sorry, but we've got our orders. Um, Wakatsuki, you got Musashi's message as well, right?<br>
<br>
KABOOM––––!!<br>
Before Sakawa and Wakatsuki finished preparing to attack, Musashi's mass-produced ships emerged from the fog and began to hammer Harutsuki and Kawakaze with a ferocious barrage.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Sakawa：</span><br>
Sorry, but that's life for ya. We're going to have to fight after all.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Harutsuki：</span><br>
Didn't you just say the complete opposite thing a moment ago?!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Sakawa：</span><br>
Hey, I would've preferred to walk away as well, but we can't disobey the boss lady.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Kawakaze：</span><br>
I was right not to let my guard down...! But considering the damage those two have already sustained, we clearly have the upper hand!<br>
Harutsuki, stay close behind me! We'll settle this with close-range torpedo combat!<br>
<br>
Kawakaze drew her sword, her eyes narrowing as she maneuvered to place Sakawa and Wakatsuki between her and Musashi's mass-produced ships.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Sakawa：</span><br>
You've got some keen moves there, as expected of Nagato's personal bodyguard... But I'm no slouch either!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Wakatsuki：</span><br>
D-don't underestimate me either!<br>
<br>
Just when cannons and swords were about to trade blows––<br>
<br>
That's enough!<br>
A brilliant beam of light descended onto the battlefield, like a stream of cherry blossoms hitting the water's surface. The rest of the thinning sea fog was instantly pushed aside, and Nagato, flagship of the Reborn Combined Fleet, emerged.<br>
Nagato's barriers surrounded the attackers on both sides, pushing blades apart and rendering shells useless.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">{namecode:157}：</span><br>
Wow, she completely nullified the cannonballs in midair... Thank you so much, Great Guardian Fox!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">{namecode:74}：</span><br>
Mm. You have nothing to worry about with me here.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">{namecode:158}：</span><br>
Lady Nagato?! We were perfectly capable of handling the situation here... There's no need for you to personally enter the battlefield...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">{namecode:74}：</span><br>
This isn't a matter of trust. I've come to prevent a pointless fight.<br>
In this exercise, there is no reason for us to take up arms against one another. Sakawa, Wakatsuki, stand down!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Sakawa：</span><br>
Woooah, busted... Uhh, it's not like we chose to fight because wanted to...<br>
M-Musashi told us to kick back and enjoy the game, so I might've gotten a bit carried away, haha... Just a little.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Wakatsuki：</span><br>
Please forgive us, Lady Nagato!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Nagato：</span><br>
There's no need to apologize. This is just an exercise, and you were merely following orders.<br>
As Musashi said, there's no risk of injury in a controlled exercise area.<br>
We spar against each other pretty much on a daily basis as part of our normal training routine.<br>
So, you don't need to apologize, and you should continue this exercise as usual.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Sakawa：</span><br>
We didn't do anything wrong, did we?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Wakatsuki：</span><br>
If there's no risk involved in us fighting, why did you stop us?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Nagato：</span><br>
This game of Go is a clash of wills among the players outside. As such, the combat power of the ships inside is limited, while the importance of one's convictions is amplified.<br>
In other words, you won't accomplish anything from fighting each other in the conventional, physical sense. Rather, the only thing that matters is a clash of ideals - something that cannot happen when you are simply "following orders."<br>
And my conviction is this: there is no place for meaningless conflict. That is the path I shall demonstrate to the Sakura Empire, and the ideal I wish to demonstrate to Musashi and Akagi.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Sakawa：</span><br>
Well spoken! I must say, I am quite moved by your speech. The mighty shield you've produced must be a manifestation of your mental image, right?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Nagato：</span><br>
Most likely. Perhaps due to the time I spent sealed inside the Sacred Sakura, this domain also reflected the vivid memories I have of that place.<br>
But now, I am no longer the same person I was before. This may be the last time we see a scenery like this here.<br>
In any case, there is no more need for us to battle each other. If you remain unconvinced, then you will have to go through me first.<br>
As long as I stand, nobody will lay a finger on any of my friends!<br>

<br>
Sanctuary Pagoda - Reception Room<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">{namecode:84}：</span><br>
Nagato, I wasn't expecting you to enter the battle so soon.<br>
To think that a bit of testing the waters would trigger such a strong rebuke... Perhaps I underestimated that girl's resolve.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">{namecode:82}：</span><br>
Maybe not. That might've just been what Nagato wanted the whole time - to stand on the front lines.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">{namecode:91}：</span><br>
She would put herself in harm's way just to prevent unnecessary conflict...<br>
Because of that antiquated ego, she fails to see the bigger picture. Her fixation on "protecting" what is dear to her may well cause her to lose everything. How foolish.<br>
There is no future to be had down that road, with or without fighting.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">{namecode:84}：</span><br>
Regardless, by sacrificing her advantage as a "player" in this match, her forces now vastly eclipse ours in combat effectiveness.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">{namecode:91}：</span><br>
So, she insists on standing in the way... Mikasa, do you have what it takes to keep up with her?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">{namecode:82}：</span><br>
Keep up? Hah, I don't have the energy or determination that girl has. The most I can do is to fill in the gaps behind her as she forges a new path forward.<br>
Now that the balance of power has been broken, shouldn't we go back to securing as many bases as we can instead of fighting each other?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">{namecode:91}：</span><br>
You may be right in saying that Nagato is forging a new path forward.<br>
But does it not fall upon us to determine if that path leads to the light... or to the abyss?<br>
As someone responsible for shouldering the Sakura Empire's future, there are many other things to consider than your own narrow sense of justice. One cannot make judgments based on speculation and assumptions alone.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">{namecode:82}：</span><br>
I cannot deny what you have done for us. But at the same time, it is too dangerous to work with the Sirens.<br>
The Commander informed me about the Iron Blood incident not too long ago. Unlike in our case, the Commander was involved with their plan to a far greater degree.<br>
Plus, both Bismarck and Friedrich shared the same vision despite their diverging paths... That is why they were able to complete their lengthy project in the end.<br>
If Nagato and I could understand the path that you've chosen, perhaps we might've also been able to work together towards a common goal.<br>
But, your heart is just as opaque as the sea fog concealing this board.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">{namecode:91}：</span><br>
...In order to outwit the Sirens, you must first learn the taste of the poison they serve.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">{namecode:82}：</span><br>
Akagi, you...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">{namecode:91}：</span><br>
After the success of the Iron Blood rebellion, the Sirens have become much more vigilant.<br>
Now that Nagato has made her intentions clear, I will crush her and demonstrate the superiority of my vision.<br>
<br>
With Akagi's declaration, a dazzling light enveloped both her and the board, just as it had with Nagato previously.<br>
When the light faded, only two people remained around the board.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Mikasa：</span><br>
She also wants to prove herself, huh... Just like Nagato, she too can only do things in her own way.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Musashi：</span><br>
The balance of power has again been restored with Akagi's entry into the battle.<br>
She will most likely join up with Miyuki to cut you off from Nagato's forces.<br>
Now the question is, will she try to gobble up your bases, or will she launch an attack on the central tower?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Mikasa：</span><br>
She's not here anymore, so it'll be harder to read her intentions.<br>
It would appear that the youngsters are too impatient to keep our little game of chess going. Hahaha!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Musashi：</span><br>
Hehe. I'm sure you were no less hot-blooded yourself during that war. Isn't that right, Great Veteran?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Mikasa：</span><br>
But that was a completely different era, Musashi. A long, long time ago, wasn't it?<br>
Even if I tried to run off like them, my body wouldn't move. After all, there are people leaning on me now.<br>
...Musashi, be honest with me. This exercise area is actually a Mirror Sea, isn't it?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Musashi：</span><br>
What makes you say that?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Mikasa：</span><br>
Mapping one's mental imagery into existence, the sudden disappearance of Nagato and Akagi... Those aren't things that should be possible through the Sakura Islands' rituals.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Musashi：</span><br>
I wonder, do you really know everything there is to know about our rituals?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Mikasa：</span><br>
...Probably not.<br>
But, that's why I want to know. Pardon me if it seemed like I was accusing you.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Musashi：</span><br>
No, there's no need for that. Your instincts were correct - this is indeed a Mirror Sea, entrusted to Akagi by the Sirens.<br>
Originally, it was a Siren experimental site that none of us could use. But after combining it with spirit barriers, I was able to turn it into the domain you now see.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Mikasa：</span><br>
I'm not sure if what you've done is amazing or borderline heretical...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Musashi：</span><br>
I'll take that as high praise from the Great Veteran. I do wonder though... Has this place been to your liking?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Mikasa：</span><br>
I don't think it matters whether or not I "like" it. The reality is, I'm stunned by the number of things here that seem to defy conventional wisdom.<br>
And even more impressively, you're able to control these things. Perhaps the stories of the Iron Blood singularity aren't as far-fetched as I initially believed.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Musashi：</span><br>
I've also heard of a Sculpting Room that generates storms to keep everyone who does not possess the "Key" away.<br>
In any case, the actual Mirror Sea itself is sealed away, but I did not disclose this to you or Nagato knowing the suspicions both of you have towards Siren technology.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Mikasa：</span><br>
There was once a period of time when I was paranoid of Akagi's every move. At least now, I have fewer doubts about her intentions.<br>
By the way, how do you command your allies after entering the battlefield? To my understanding, our communications are not affected the way they would be in a Mirror Sea?<br>
We're able to give instructions directly to the entire fleet from here, and losing that ability would be a huge disadvantage.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Musashi：</span><br>
Don't worry. You won't be able to immediately grasp everyone's positions at once, but you will still be able to issue commands to them as before.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Mikasa：</span><br>
I see, so there aren't as many disadvantages as I imagined. So, for our allies inside, there's no difference in how they're getting their orders?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Musashi：</span><br>
Correct.<br>
There is a key difference though: when the retainer is unable to hear the player's voice, she has no choice but to obey the order. But if she is able to voice her opinions, she may be able to influence those orders.<br>
You will also be able to directly observe the condition of your forces, and that may cause you to make different decisions than if you treated them as pieces on a board.<br>
I wonder if Nagato and Akagi were aware of this before they made their decisions.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Mikasa：</span><br>
I'd imagine so. They chose to fight alongside their friends rather than sit out here enjoying tea with us.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Musashi：</span><br>
Hehe. Can't blame them.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Mikasa：</span><br>
Hahaha. Well then, as I told Akagi, I will remain here a bit longer.<br>
Show me what kind of moves the three of you will make.<br>

Exercise Area - Turn 4 (Akagi's Action)<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Yamashiro：</span><br>
A Compiler vessel... What were we doing while Milord was struggling for survival...?<br>
Ugh... I lost another mass-produced ship... At this rate, I'm going to be forced to retire from the game...<br>
As a battleship, I should be the one on the front lines... But I'm supposed to conserve my firepower and energy still...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Jintsuu：</span><br>
Calm down, Yamashiro. Akagi has already taken the base.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Yamashiro：</span><br>
Huh, really? Since when...<br>
<br>
Before Yamashiro could make sense of what she was seeing, Akagi had already crushed the Siren vessel.<br>
Burning petals swirled around her body, the only remaining traces of the Siren that had once been there.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Kaga：</span><br>
Akagi!<br>
When I saw your foxflames appear, I thought you had used another command. I didn't think you would directly enter the battlefield...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Akagi：</span><br>
I was going to fall asleep if I had to spend another minute in that cramped room. Just needed a little change in scenery.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ryuuhou：</span><br>
Akagi, what did you just do to that Compiler...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Akagi：</span><br>
Compiler models are known for having extremely high resistance to conventional weapons. However, we are able to use the unique features of this area to our advantage.<br>
I changed the characteristics of my attack, as you can see from these lycoris flowers here, allowing my flames to penetrate the vessel's weak points.<br>
Knowledge is power - the same is true for fighting Sirens as it is for understanding our opposition.<br>
(The sea fog had a fairly significant effect the first time it was used, but Mikasa will know how to deal with it if I use it a second time.)<br>
Nagato has also descended upon the battlefield. If we do not act quickly, there will be no more bases left to take, and we will be forced into a stalemate.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ryuuhou：</span><br>
Understood. We trust your judgment, Akagi.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Akagi：</span><br>
That's fine, but your own safety comes first. The same goes for Jintsuu and the others.<br>
Color me surprised, though... I didn't expect to see another Compiler so soon. Seems like the ghosts of the past are all coming out to play.<br>
I suppose this means that even if the mainframe has been destroyed, its data can still be used to create spares... But what is the point in doing that––<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Yamashiro：</span><br>
Thank you for saving us, Akagi! If it weren't for you, all our mass-produced ships probably would've gotten wiped out!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Akagi：</span><br>
...Do you think I'd exhaust our resources securing a base of this size? I sent the mass-produced ships in to gauge the opponent's specs.<br>
Yamashiro, you will be needed to secure a more important objective.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Yamashiro：</span><br>
A more important objective...? Are you talking about the tower over there? I'm not sure I'll be able to take down even stronger enemies...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Akagi：</span><br>
Hold on. I'm not done talking yet.<br>
Mikasa has already formed a perimeter through the southern side of the board. If we allow her forces to join up with Nagato's, we're as good as done.<br>
Jintsuu, I'd like you to join up with Miyuki. Cross over past the central tower and look for an opportunity to split off Mikasa and Nagato.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">{namecode:39}&{namecode:5}：</span><br>
Understood!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Akagi：</span><br>
Yamashiro, you have the important task of preventing Mikasa's forces from advancing on the central tower. I need you to hold the waters around that area.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Yamashiro：</span><br>
I just knew I was gonna get sent there! Ugh, everyone's going to be ganging up on me...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ryuuhou：</span><br>
That area is where most of the action is going to be, but with your durability, I'm sure you'll be fine. If anything, I'm sure Akagi chose to send you specifically because you're the best fit for the task.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Yamashiro：</span><br>
Oh, I see... Well, if Akagi has that much confidence in me...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ryuuhou：</span><br>
Surprisingly, the two of you seem to work together pretty well.<br>
Akagi, let me go to the central tower as well. In case something happens there, it'll be safer to have two people instead of one.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Akagi：</span><br>
That leaves me a bit short-handed for my other move, but it's true that having two people grants both of you more flexibility.<br>
We should be able to work with that... I'll allow it. Make sure you cover Yamashiro.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ryuuhou：</span><br>
Understood, Akagi.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Akagi：</span><br>
Now then, Great Veteran Mikasa. It's your move.<br>

<br>
Exercise Area - Turn 4 (Mikasa's Action)<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Kirishima：</span><br>
Akagi has sent a fleet to hold the waters around the central tower.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Hatakaze：</span><br>
Is she trying to prevent us from assisting Lady Nagato?<br>
She just took a base, but is already poised to make her next move...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Haguro：</span><br>
Doesn't this put us in a tough position though? We haven't even finished capturing the Diadem of Light yet.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Kongou：</span><br>
Mikasa said she can handle this situation.<br>
We will maintain pressure around the central area to keep Akagi's forces occupied and allow Nagato to take all the remaining small bases along the perimeter.<br>
Akagi is trying to fulfill three objectives at once, using speed and misdirection to throw us off. However, she is unable to muster significant numbers for any one of those objectives.<br>
<br>
While surveying a map of the exercise area, Kongou relayed the messages she received directly from Mikasa.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Kongou：</span><br>
Even if Akagi manages to capture some of the bases around the central tower, she won't have the resources to push further west.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Kinu：</span><br>
Why is she doing this? Shouldn't Akagi know that our forces are concentrated around the Diadem of Light?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Hatakaze：</span><br>
That's most likely the reason why she only sent a small detachment.<br>
If she planned on taking any other bases on the western side, she would have to commit a lot more resources.<br>
That's why I think this might be a feint. Even though we have the numerical advantage, we're prone to getting pincered if we get too focused on surrounding the detachment.<br>
Regardless of what Akagi is specifically aiming to do, she's going to keep her forces in an area where they will be able to come to each others' aid.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Kinu：</span><br>
In other words, it's advantageous to keep the enemy in one place?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Kongou：</span><br>
What we can most likely surmise is, Akagi is trying to keep us from attacking the central tower.<br>
I understand what Mikasa is trying to accomplish, so the next step is turning this situation into an advantage.<br>
After all, we're in no hurry to take the central tower. If anything, Akagi would do us a huge favor by scouting out exactly what kind of enemy we're dealing with in that tower.<br>
For the time being, focus on capturing the Diadem of Light.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Haguro：</span><br>
So we'll be directing all our firepower at the bases and trying to avoid other shipgirls, huh?<br>
Right, I just got a report from the recon planes - we're dealing with an Omitter vessel up ahead.<br>
Omitters tend to be more aggressive than other types of Sirens, but this isn't a fight we can back down from.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Kongou：</span><br>
Don't worry.<br>
Mikasa informed me that this battle will be pivotal for us. Don't hold anything back, and hit that Omitter vessel with everything you've got.<br>
Naturally, I will be joining you too. How could the first ship of the Kongou-class battleships miss this chance for glory?<br>
I will lead the charge! Capture the Diadem of Light, then turn around as a unit and intercept Akagi's fleet!<br>

<br>
Exercise Area - Turn 4 (Nagato's Action)<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Haruna：</span><br>
Woah, Akagi and Mikasa both managed to capture a 5-point base already?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Nagato：</span><br>
Yes... The only one that hasn't been captured at this point is this Sacred Sakura... Unlike me, Mikasa continues to show no signs of hesitation...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Haruna：</span><br>
What's wrong, Nagato?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Nagato：</span><br>
It's nothing. We've already managed to force Sakawa and Wakatsuki back.<br>
We can't afford to fall behind either. Let's take the Sacred Sakura this turn.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Hiei：</span><br>
Understood. For some reason, my combat performance seems to have improved after my sister's feats.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Nagato：</span><br>
This domain continues to work in mysterious ways. Interesting.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Shoukaku：</span><br>
Those two girls might've retreated for now, but isn't there a chance they attack again on Musashi's turn?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Nagato：</span><br>
If you are concerned about that, I shall monitor the situation myself. Bring mass-produced ships with you to avoid being caught off-guard.<br>
After we take the Sacred Sakura, there is no longer any benefit for Musashi to attack this area.<br>
If she still wishes to test me after that, she will find that I am not lacking in resolve.<br>
Harutsuki, I want you to head towards the central tower to monitor the situation with Akagi and Mikasa. Kawakaze will cover you.<br>
Shoukaku, Hiei, and Haruna - the three of you will move south and capture the bases along the perimeter.<br>
Musashi, I hope you stop whatever you're trying to do... at least while all of us participants are in the dark about the true purpose of this game...<br>
If we hope to achieve victory without fighting, we will need to capture as many bases as possible while we still can.<br>
I must see through her words and determine what's going on inside her mind... That is my purpose here!<br>

{{折叠面板|标题=An Unacceptable "Reality"|选项=18|主框=1|样式=primary|展开=是}}
<br>
Sanctuary Pagoda - Reception Room<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">{namecode:84}：</span><br>
I see you've finally caught a small glimpse into this game's true purpose, Nagato.<br>
It's just as you said, Mikasa - she is prepared to do what it takes in order to secure her "bloodless" victory...<br>
...Even if she knows it is a waste of the immense power bestowed upon her. Did you predict this as well?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">{namecode:82}：</span><br>
Hah, I'm not a mind-reader, nor do I claim to know everything about Nagato. But what I do know is, now that she has chosen a path, it is my duty to follow it through.<br>
If Nagato does decide to fight, I will gladly take up arms by her side. Both you and Akagi were aware of this before the game even began, right?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">{namecode:84}：</span><br>
In my eyes, you seem more concerned with keeping Akagi in check than facilitating Nagato's victory.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">{namecode:82}：</span><br>
Possibly? It sometimes seems like you know me better than I know myself.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">{namecode:84}：</span><br>
Compassion for the weak may be a virtue, but on the battlefield, it may just as well be your undoing.<br>
I can easily understand your loyalties and what you are aiming for... But why are you keeping that child from facing Akagi?<br>
Your actions do not pave the path to victory. Instead of showing me a vision of the future, you still seem to be shackled by your mistrust.<br>
Now, your fate is no longer in your own hands.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">{namecode:82}：</span><br>
Mistrust? No, it is a measured anticipation more than anything else. Everything depends on what Akagi decides to do - and I have accepted this.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">{namecode:84}：</span><br>
Once you've been put on the back foot, you will continue to remain at a disadvantage. Can someone who has given up the initiative keep her eyes on the future when she cannot even keep up with the present?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">{namecode:82}：</span><br>
Initiative is not everything. We will find out soon enough if Akagi has the discipline to stay, or if she ends up going bust in her haste.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">{namecode:84}：</span><br>
Heh. Right you are, but what will you do if she doesn't end up going bust?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">{namecode:82}：</span><br>
I can tell where you'd prefer to hedge your bets. I won't take it personally if we end up standing on opposite sides.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">{namecode:84}：</span><br>
Surely you jest, Great Veteran~<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">{namecode:82}：</span><br>
At this point, I still have time on my side. You're not scrambling to make any moves either, are you?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">{namecode:84}：</span><br>
True. Unlike Nagato, you are not so easy to provoke.<br>
But surely this isn't what you're interested in. You've had questions for me this whole time, haven't you?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">{namecode:82}：</span><br>
Too many things have been on my mind. Things that don't make any sense to me.<br>
For example, why did you send Shinano to Sardegna, and Zuikaku to Iron Blood?<br>
Neither of these things were ordered by the higher-ups, and these decisions were made on extremely short notice.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">{namecode:84}：</span><br>
Are you suggesting that I'm deliberately keeping them away from the Sakura Empire?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">{namecode:82}：</span><br>
I can't think of any other explanation.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">{namecode:84}：</span><br>
Shinano is a good representative for our goodwill delegation to Sardegna, and Zuikaku already has some standing with Iron Blood following her visit to their floating fortress.<br>
Do you disagree with my choice of delegates?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">{namecode:82}：</span><br>
Then, what about the Watatsumi? I heard it had been returned to us, but before anyone realized it, it had gone missing again.<br>
None of us get to arbitrarily decide what to do with the Sakura Empire's relics. Where is it?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">{namecode:84}：</span><br>
Due to the attack on the Diadem of Light, the security protocols regarding our sacred relics have been called into question, so I had it moved to a safer location.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">{namecode:82}：</span><br>
...Do you know anything about the Watatsumi's origins? The more I look into it, the more I doubt it's actually an ancient relic passed down from generation to generation.<br>
I get the same impressions of the Sanctuary. I can't help but feel that Sirens are involved somehow.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">{namecode:84}：</span><br>
That's news to me. I don't know any more about these things than you do, unfortunately.<br>
Perhaps, I know even less. After all, Akagi's dealings with the Sirens are her responsibility alone. I merely give her the authorization she needs.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">{namecode:82}：</span><br>
Akagi's dealings with Siren technology wouldn't have been possible without your backing.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">{namecode:84}：</span><br>
If you already know this much, then what need is there to hear it from my mouth?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">{namecode:82}：</span><br>
We cannot allow Siren technology... No, the Sirens themselves, to go unchecked! Do you not have enough love and loyalty for the Sakura Empire to realize that?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">{namecode:84}：</span><br>
I have nothing but love and loyalty. However...<br>
The Sakura Empire owes the power it currently enjoys to Siren technology. Even without the Naval HQ's Reenactments, we have already become addicted to their poison.<br>
News of this should have reached your ears while you were in seclusion.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">{namecode:82}：</span><br>
I do not believe for a second that this momentary peace means the Sirens have retreated. Ever since the Iron Blood's rebellion, they've been far too quiet.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">{namecode:84}：</span><br>
Then, would you say the Sirens are watching us, biding their time?<br>
Akagi has led the Sakura Empire thus far not because of her relationship to Amagi, nor because she's actively trying to obtain Siren technology.<br>
It is because she has chosen the path that you, I, and the entire Sakura Empire believes in.<br>
What you see is an Akagi ensnared by the corrupting influence of the Sirens, just as how the Black Cube ensnared Bismarck.<br>
But without that power, the Sakura Empire would have no future.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">{namecode:82}：</span><br>
No future? You're not making any sense...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">{namecode:84}：</span><br>
Mikasa, you know what Reenactments are, right? As long as they continue, we will all be condemned to annihilation, just like Bismarck was.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">{namecode:82}：</span><br>
We cannot allow that to happen. I would gladly give my life to resist.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">{namecode:84}：</span><br>
Akagi said the exact same thing. You are focusing only on her madness and have lost sight of her true nature.<br>
If Akagi's path is wrong, then it is necessary to see the reflections of her mind and heart which paved that path.<br>
Akagi is not as simple-minded as you, and Zuikaku, seem to believe.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">{namecode:82}：</span><br>
Are you saying... that Akagi also seeks to destroy our Reenactment, just like the Iron Blood did with theirs?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">{namecode:84}：</span><br>
You've seen the Commander's report too, haven't you? The Sirens deployed a weapon that causes the very foundation of our hulls to tremble.<br>
Those scenes they showed us were not illusions. They are the basis of the Sirens' Natural Calculation System... In other words, their "reality."<br>
Shinano has seen the same dream over and over again. From that single "reality," we are destroyed again and again in countless futures.<br>
A black tornado that seeks to devour the ocean. Horrendous beasts that defy the power of the KAN-SEN and crush our destined future... There is no escape from them.<br>
As long as we cannot break the recorded Reenactment that leads to their "reality," we will be nothing more than ragdolls dancing in the Sirens' palms.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">{namecode:82}：</span><br>
All those sacrifices we made to push them back during the last war... Does none of that matter?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">{namecode:84}：</span><br>
What matters is... None of us can accept that reality lying down. Not Akagi, and not the Commander.<br>
The Naval HQ's... No, rather, the Sirens' Reenactments... They may be too numerous to count.<br>
Even if we are able to escape the flames of war, the power of those aberrant beasts will still bear down upon us–<br>
Akagi, Kaga, Yamato, myself... All of the Sakura Empire. All the shipgirls in this world. Everything will be devoured... until even the dreamer herself meets the same fate.<br>
...Do you understand now, Mikasa?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">{namecode:82}：</span><br>
That... is not a future we can accept.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">{namecode:84}：</span><br>
What Akagi seeks to do is to render all Reenactments null and void, so that they are nothing more than leaves on the tree of possibility.<br>
As principled and compassionate as you are, your distrust towards Akagi is understandable.<br>
However, principles mean nothing if they cannot be defended and enforced. If you believe your path to be correct, then you must prove it to Akagi - with your strength.<br>
Unlike Akagi and Nagato, you are not weak. But even then, you could not bear the burden of the entire Sakura Empire atop your shoulders.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">{namecode:82}：</span><br>
Musashi...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">{namecode:84}：</span><br>
This exercise was designed to be a clash of ideals, not rhetoric.<br>
But in the end, isn't it too boring waxing philosophical around a chessboard?<br>
Make your move, Mikasa. There are those who believe in you, and in the victory they believe you will lead them to.<br>
Don't keep them waiting too long, Great Veteran.<br>

<br>
不知不觉间日色已然西斜，对局也来到了焦灼的中盘——第六回合的结束之时。<br>
第五回合中，{namecode:74}准备的事件卡「天宇启户祭」有如一盆冷水，让场上不断升温的局势暂时得到缓和——<br>
而第六回合触发的事件卡「静海惊雷」则彻底搅乱了战局，突然出现的多处雷击预警区让各方势力都进行了阵型的紧急调整。<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">{namecode:82}：</span><br>
{namecode:84}大人，你准备的这张事件卡真的十分厉害啊……<br>
虽然没能直接造成伤害，但却如高悬的利剑一般搅乱了所有人的部署。<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">{namecode:84}：</span><br>
这话可不严谨，是几乎所有人的部署才对。<br>
{namecode:91}大人就无视了这个在结算时才会造成伤害的事件，坚定地完成了拿下你与{namecode:74}大人之间连接据点的目标哦。<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">{namecode:82}：</span><br>
但是作为代价，停留在雷击区中的{namecode:39}就要退场了。<br>
比起部署被打乱，侍从数量的减少才更得不偿失吧？<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">{namecode:84}：</span><br>
这就取决于为将者对于价值的判断了，有得必有失嘛。<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">{namecode:82}：</span><br>
那，我觉得这个判断尚有待商榷。毕竟，这就是她这次突击行动的仅有战果了。<br>
待到下回合封锁解除，我会拿下另一处边界据点，她将我与{namecode:74}分开的战略意图也就无法实现了。<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">{namecode:84}：</span><br>
但是如此一来，你们二人的侍从就都来到了距离中心区域相当遥远的位置。<br>
这场棋局，终究还是以占领据点为评判标准的积分制哦。<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">{namecode:82}：</span><br>
现在谈论中心区域还有些为时尚早吧，{namecode:84}大人。<br>
从场面上来看，我与{namecode:74}大人虽处于不利位置，但是侍从们的状态良好。<br>
反观你与{namecode:91}大人。虽然占据地利，但是已经受到了不少消耗。量产型舰队基本消耗一空，侍从也有不同程度的损伤。<br>
你们已经是强弩之末，而我们正要进入锐不可当之时呢。<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">{namecode:84}：</span><br>
倘若你与{namecode:74}大人的联军能完全按照你的策略来执行的话，确实是这样。<br>
可是如果{namecode:74}大人继续选择固守战略，最后的结果就很难说了哦。<br>
信念要靠实力守护，究竟是过于天真还是坚定不移……就让我试探一下吧。<br>
接下来，我要使用的指挥卡名为「百韵连歌」。<br>
选择一个场上的目标，若其在本行动轮内被消灭，则所有对其造成伤害的己方侍从都将获得一次伤害减半的额外进攻行动。<br>
我指定的目标为你位于的E4的{namecode:65}，然后让{namecode:226}、{namecode:27}、{namecode:103}、{namecode:104}依次对其发动攻击。<br>
在消灭了{namecode:65}之后，其「黑之羽」的援护效果就会消失，继而刚攻略了区域据点正在G4休整的{namecode:157}就会变为无保护状态。<br>
虽然第二次进攻造成的伤害减半，不过用于消灭{namecode:157}还是绰绰有余了。<br>
如此一来，{namecode:74}的信念也要被击碎了吧。<br>
原本依靠她所拥有的力量是能够阻止这件事发生的，可惜她早早将力量用了出去。<br>
真是令人遗憾，除非——你能阻止这件事的发生。<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">{namecode:82}：</span><br>
{namecode:84}，你好像在巧妙地逼我下场哦。<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">{namecode:84}：</span><br>
怎么可能呢~现在只剩你一个人还在这里陪我聊天了，你也下去了我岂不是要一个人下闷棋？<br>
汝也可以选择不下场，毕竟汝也不完全支持{namecode:74}的战略吧。<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">{namecode:82}：</span><br>
这个嘛，一码归一码。<br>
虽然在这里聊天对弈很开心，不过守护后辈成长也是前辈应该做的事啊。<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">{namecode:84}：</span><br>
盾能守护，剑亦能守护。<br>
{namecode:74}选择了盾，{namecode:91}选择了剑，你呢？<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">{namecode:82}：</span><br>
这个问题，我想首先听一下您的答案呢？<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">{namecode:84}：</span><br>
如果汝能取胜的话，就告诉汝吾的答案。<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">{namecode:82}：</span><br>
有了这句话，我就更要打起精神来认真对局了。<br>
那么{namecode:84}大人，我在此先走一步。如果一个人在房间里无聊的话，也请尽快下来哦。<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">{namecode:84}：</span><br>
呵呵，走好~<br>

<br>
大棋盘·控制区交界处 稍早之前——<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Sakawa：</span><br>
{namecode:84}大人的侍从{namecode:226}参上~{namecode:65}，接下来就让我们较量一番吧！<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Haguro：</span><br>
呜啊……好突然，而且好麻烦……<br>
居然奔袭到{namecode:74}大人的控制区来打我，我有这么大的吸引力么……？<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Sakawa：</span><br>
嘿嘿，其实{namecode:84}大人的目标是{namecode:157}，不过不先解决掉为她提供护卫的你，我们就没法安心进攻嘛。<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Haguro：</span><br>
原来如此……呼呼呼，那你就尽管来试试吧。<br>
不过我的反击可是对周围所有目标生效的，你要是攻击我的话，旁边的{namecode:5}也会卷进来。<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Sakawa：</span><br>
欸？！是这样么？！好犯规的技能！<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Haguro：</span><br>
这可是名副其实的「黑之羽」，如果想让场面变混乱的话……就尽管攻过来吧，<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Sakawa：</span><br>
我可不会因此犹豫哦！抱歉了{namecode:5}，但是{namecode:84}大人的命令不得不从！<br>
如果{namecode:65}趁机欺负你，下回合我会配合你一起打回去的！<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Miyuki：</span><br>
嗯……我知道了！不用担心{namecode:5}……你尽管执行命令吧。<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Haguro：</span><br>
切……挑拨失败。那就放马过来吧——<br>
<br>
就在{namecode:65}、{namecode:226}、{namecode:157}三人各自做好准备，迎接即将到来的剑与炮火之时——<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">{namecode:82}：</span><br>
三位，到此为止了——<br>
<br>
伴随着远方出现的洪亮声音，三人身边各自出现了一个旋转着的红色圆环。<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">{namecode:226}：</span><br>
欸……主炮启动失败…………？关键时刻出现故障了么！<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">{namecode:65}：</span><br>
我的剑也拔不出来了……<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">{namecode:5}：</span><br>
{namecode:5}也一样……这个红色圆环上有一圈禁止图案，说不定就是它让我们的武器都失效了……<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">{namecode:65}：</span><br>
说起来，刚刚听到的声音好像是……大前辈？<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">{namecode:82}：</span><br>
呵呵，大家好啊。<br>
<br>
{namecode:65}与{namecode:5}转头看向声音的方向，不远处，{namecode:82}正在水面上缓缓驶来。<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Mikasa：</span><br>
如你们所见，接下来两回合内，这片区域中的侍从之间已经无法相互战斗了。<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Haguro：</span><br>
呼……得救了……这个是大前辈的入场效果么？<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Mikasa：</span><br>
没错，其名为「止戈」。中心据点还未被击破，相互争斗可不好哦。<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Miyuki：</span><br>
不仅是战斗取消……刚刚决定执行的所有攻击指令会视为已执行，{namecode:84}大人的侍从们本回合已经无法继续战斗了……<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Mikasa：</span><br>
说的不错，规则了解得很细致啊，{namecode:5}。<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Miyuki：</span><br>
多谢大前辈夸奖…！{namecode:5}为了能帮上{namecode:91}大人的忙，在来之前拼命研究过规则了！<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Mikasa：</span><br>
呵呵，眼见为实，这个棋盘果然厉害……不单是把文字具现化，更奇妙的是把我设计之时心中所想的画面也具现化了。<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Sakawa：</span><br>
这就是大前辈的实力么……（轻声）居然轻松就化解了{namecode:84}大人的攻势……<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Mikasa：</span><br>
哎呀，你有所不满意么？<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Sakawa：</span><br>
不不不，我觉得很激动！对局就是要有这样的千变万化才有乐趣嘛~<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Mikasa：</span><br>
眼前的危机成功化解，剩下的就只等回合结束时的落雷结算了。<br>
没想到第一个退场的会是你啊，{namecode:39}。<br>
<br>
{namecode:82}转过身看向自己的相邻格，伴随着{namecode:84}回合结束的提示，一束闪电从空中劈下，将本就状态不佳的{namecode:39}砸了个结实。<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Mikasa：</span><br>
直面雷电的威光，真是有勇气。<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Miyuki：</span><br>
呜哇……落雷好可怕……{namecode:39}……你没事吧？<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Jintsuu：</span><br>
大前辈过奖了，虽说看上去雷霆震天，不过却没有真正落雷的威能呢。<br>
不用担心哦{namecode:5}，毕竟只是虚拟之雷，我只有些酥酥麻麻的感觉而已。<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Mikasa：</span><br>
{namecode:39}，直到退场都没有见你使用过为自己设置的技能，方便在最后满足一下我的好奇心么？<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Jintsuu：</span><br>
抱歉，大前辈，既然没用上，也就没必要说了。<br>
看来这次我发挥的空间仅限于此……那么我就先在此退场，各位继续享受——<br>

<br>
大棋盘·{namecode:91}控制区 第七回合<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ryuuhou：</span><br>
太好了，{namecode:91}前辈准备的事件「技术革新」终于触发了！本回合，拥有最多舰载机武器的我们将处于巨大的优势中。<br>
不过{namecode:5}那边就……因为{namecode:82}大前辈的效果，似乎两回合内都那边都没法进行战斗了，转而去进攻{namecode:74}大人么？<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Akagi：</span><br>
不，那边打到这个程度就行了。<br>
{namecode:79}后退至E6，把{namecode:82}进攻中心据点的通道留出来。<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Yamashiro：</span><br>
欸~~救命呀<nowiki>~~~</nowiki>我已经在中间吃了好几轮伤害了，快不行了！<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Akagi：</span><br>
别以为我看不到你的状态栏，技能一个没用过，损伤也还不到三成，给我老实呆在里面。<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Yamashiro：</span><br>
是————<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Akagi：</span><br>
{namecode:5}的话，很不幸，你的所有撤离通道都被封死了，暂时先呆在原地，等待后续指令。<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Miyuki：</span><br>
遵命……{namecode:91}大人！<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Akagi：</span><br>
{namecode:179}、{namecode:92}还有到位之后的{namecode:79}随我一起进攻。<br>
呵呵，总之，中心据点的战斗就由我们先打响吧~<br>
<br>
大棋盘·{namecode:82}控制区 第七回合<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Kongou：</span><br>
{namecode:82}前辈，{namecode:91}开始进攻中心据点了，我们是不是跟上？<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Mikasa：</span><br>
{namecode:70}，你觉得{namecode:91}为什么要让{namecode:79}撤退，把E5这个接触点留空给我们？<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Kongou：</span><br>
也许是因为我们彻底控制了边界，她害怕过于冒进致使{namecode:79}也像{namecode:39}{namecode:5}那样陷入死地？<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Mikasa：</span><br>
有这种可能性。不过在我看来，这更像是{namecode:91}对我们发起的进攻中心据点的邀请。<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Kinu：</span><br>
{namecode:91}怎么会突然这么好心……？<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Hatakaze：</span><br>
也许是在等我们出力之后，再在关键时刻用出其不意的手段抢下来哦。<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Mikasa：</span><br>
如果她是这样盘算的话，我也有相应的反制手段。这里先就接受邀请，看看{namecode:91}接下来的企图吧。<br>
{namecode:73}进入E5保持与中心据点的接触，之后与{namecode:70}一同对位于中心区域的塔进行一轮试探性进攻。<br>
{namecode:65}原地不动保持对{namecode:5}的封锁，{namecode:181}{namecode:140}与我一同进攻边界据点EF12。<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Haguro：</span><br>
欸？我不参与吗？大前辈，这个边界据点只靠你们打不掉啊……？<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Mikasa：</span><br>
这正是关键。在我们结束之后，边界据点就能让{namecode:74}用最小的代价将其收下。<br>
既然{namecode:74}选择靠据点的积分来取胜，我就来帮一帮她好了~<br>

<br>
大棋盘·{namecode:74}控制区 第七回合<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Kawakaze：</span><br>
{namecode:74}大人，大前辈居然刚刚没有打掉那个据点？！是计算失误了么……<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Nagato：</span><br>
非也，那里是故意而为之……<br>
<br>
{namecode:74}看向{namecode:82}的方向，有些犹豫地打开了通讯器。<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Nagato：</span><br>
{namecode:82}，那个据点是汝故意留给吾的吧。<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Mikasa：</span><br>
正是。<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Nagato：</span><br>
非常感谢……<br>
刚刚汝入场，虽然保护的是{namecode:65}，但{namecode:65}是因为保护了{namecode:157}才会被攻击的……再次感谢。<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Mikasa：</span><br>
无妨，反正在里面坐的时间也够长了。<br>
如此美妙的棋盘，不亲自进来体验一下也太可惜了，不是么？<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Nagato：</span><br>
最后……抱歉。<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Mikasa：</span><br>
呵呵，你怎么突然跟我客气起来了。<br>
有什么事等赢了之后再说。现在还在战场之上，大将犹豫不定成何体统？贯彻你的路线坚定行动吧。<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Nagato：</span><br>
好，那吾就不客气了。<br>
<br>
通讯结束，{namecode:74}深吁了一口气，原先的犹豫逐渐褪去，变成了一副坚毅的神色。<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Nagato：</span><br>
呼…………{namecode:158}前往F2，配合{namecode:95}拿下边界据点EF12。<br>
{namecode:72}移动至G4，{namecode:71}移动至H5，与吾一起维持住对{namecode:84}的防御阵型。<br>
{namecode:157}就地展开回复结界，让所有人都休息一下。<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Harutsuki：</span><br>
{namecode:74}大人，{namecode:5}和{namecode:226}也在{namecode:157}的恢复范围内哦……？<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Nagato：</span><br>
无妨，去做吧。<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Harutsuki：</span><br>
是————接下来是来自{namecode:157}的结界「春意盎然」，大家都好好休息一下吧~<br>
<br>
{namecode:157}轻轻舞动起手中的神乐杖，如同{namecode:139}一般的绿色雨点从天空落下，将周围的所有人都笼罩其中。<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Miyuki：</span><br>
呼啊~身上有种暖洋洋的感觉……谢谢{namecode:157}~<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Sakawa：</span><br>
{namecode:74}大人，你为什么要给我们提供回复呢，我们正处于对抗状态吧？<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Nagato：</span><br>
吾认为，相互战斗没有益处，吾想寻找一条不相互争斗也能取胜的道路，仅此而已。<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Sakawa：</span><br>
如此胸襟，不愧是{namecode:74}大人……不过，如果{namecode:84}大人有命令的话，我还是不会手下留情哦。<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Nagato：</span><br>
不用介意，到时候汝尽管出招即可，不过，现在就在此处享受片刻的安宁吧。<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Sakawa：</span><br>
哎嘿嘿……那我就不客气了。<br>
刚刚{namecode:157}发动的结界名字是叫春意盎然对么？如同令人置身于翠绿色的春雨之中一般……真可惜{namecode:206}没过来看看！<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Mikasa：</span><br>
{namecode:226}，你知道{namecode:206}去哪儿了么？<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Sakawa：</span><br>
不知道诶……她之前被{namecode:84}大人派出去执行任务就没回来，我也不知道去哪儿了。<br>
大前辈找她有事么？<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Mikasa：</span><br>
没事，只是随口问问而已。<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Nagato：</span><br>
……如此一来，吾的行动也结束了。<br>
{namecode:84}，接下来汝要如何出招呢？<br>
{{折叠面板|内容结束}}

{{折叠面板|标题=如梦似幻|选项=23|主框=1|样式=primary|展开=是}}
<br>
大棋盘·{namecode:84}控制区 第七回合<br>
{namecode:74}的选择让剑拔弩张的气氛得到了缓解，不过随着{namecode:84}行动的开始，{namecode:226}的身边突然出现了众多飞舞的紫色蝴蝶。<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Haguro：</span><br>
这个是……{namecode:84}大人的指挥卡么？<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Sakawa：</span><br>
没错哦，其名为——指挥卡「如梦似幻」！在本次行动轮中，所有己方侍从对于据点的伤害提高50%。<br>
所以不用紧张，我们之间暂时不用战斗了。<br>
既然{namecode:91}大人和{namecode:82}大前辈都对中心据点发动了进攻，{namecode:84}大人也不能落后啊~<br>
<br>
{namecode:226}看向屹立在海域中心的黑色高塔。即使历经了之前的猛烈战斗，那座高塔似乎依然没什么破损的迹象。<br>
而在高塔之下，{namecode:27}和{namecode:104}已经就位了。<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Suzutsuki ：</span><br>
比起远望时的压迫感，近距离下观察这个塔，感觉……简直就像某种拥有心脏的活物一样……<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Chiyoda：</span><br>
不要用这么恐怖的形容词啊……这不只是一座机械塔而已么。<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Wakatsuki：</span><br>
说起来……为什么四个区域据点里是人型塞壬精英，到了中心据点却只有一座塔呢？<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Sakawa：</span><br>
听说之前打倒构建者的时候，{namecode:91}大人一行人也破坏了一座塔。<br>
也许这个塔，代表的是某种塞壬的高级形式吧？<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Chiyoda：</span><br>
塞壬的高级形式……？看起来也没什么了不起的，{namecode:103}姐，我们一起上吧。<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Chitose：</span><br>
嗯，让中心据点见识一下我们连携技的威力——<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Sakawa：</span><br>
哇哦~哼哼哼，{namecode:84}大人让我使用技能的指令终于下来了！<br>
是时候让大家，还有我自己见识一下，我所设定技能的恐怖威力了！看招，「{namecode:226}鬼神斩」——————！<br>
<br>
{namecode:226}身后突然出现了一个逐渐凝聚为实体的巨大的影子，挥舞着近百米的长刀，对水面发出了猛烈一击。<br>
产生的剑气劈开海水，向着塔身冲去。不过比剑气更先到的是舰载机的机炮与炸弹，猛烈的攻击让塔身逐渐出现了裂缝。<br>
紧接着，数道细小的冲击波凭空出现，对水面上的{namecode:27}等人发动了反击。<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Kirishima：</span><br>
嗯……跟我们之前进攻的结果一样，被攻击次数增多，反击次数也变多了。不过伤害就……<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Kongou：</span><br>
作为中心据点，单次反击的伤害居然还不如区域据点高，这太反常了。<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Kinu：</span><br>
我注意到了一件事……你们仔细看塔的状态栏，有人能看清它的具体状态么？<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Kirishima：</span><br>
唔……嗯？模块的数量在不停变化……？<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Hatakaze：</span><br>
有猫腻。它不想让我们看清自己的状态，说明这座塔正在刻意隐藏着什么。<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Kongou：</span><br>
确实，感觉值得再观望一下……<br>
<br>
在众人的观察中，{namecode:84}结束了回合。不过第八回合没有开始，而是进入了结算阶段。<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Haguro：</span><br>
结算阶段……？哎？这回合没什么要结算的啊。<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Kongou：</span><br>
这个光芒是…………大家小心，有什么事要发生了！<br>
<br>
无声的光芒散去之后，原本位于中心据点周边的{namecode:73}、{namecode:27}、{namecode:104}和{namecode:79}都消失了，一个新的身影出现在水面上。<br>
<span style="color:#ec5d53;">Arbiter: The Hermit IX：</span><br>
…………<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Kongou：</span><br>
开玩笑吧……满状态的{namecode:73}，被直接消灭了？！<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Mikasa：</span><br>
难道塔是把本回合受到的所有伤害全部释放给了周围的人么……<br>
大意了，没想到还有这种机制，应该再观察一个回合的……！<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Hatakaze：</span><br>
……真是惨状。可是令人不解啊……这是{namecode:84}设计的棋局她应该对规则心知肚明吧？<br>
为什么明知会发生这种事，还要把自己的两个人送进去？她这么做的目的究竟是……<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Haguro：</span><br>
……大前辈，中间出现的人型，是塞壬么？<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Mikasa：</span><br>
不知道，看起来是塞壬人形的风格，但是我没见过它。<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Nagato：</span><br>
吾也没见过。<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Shoukaku：</span><br>
{namecode:74}大人，我感觉她有点眼熟，我好像之前见过这个塞壬。<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Akagi：</span><br>
呵呵呵，这就是你所准备的惊喜么，{namecode:84}？<br>
真是连我也大吃一惊啊，不是说好的观察者，而是这个塞壬的仲裁机关，仲裁者·赫米忒·IX。<br>
{namecode:95}，你的记忆力没错。你与我都见过它，之前在NA海域中心就是她让我们吃了个大亏，还记得么？<br>
当时具有腐蚀性的海雾就是这东西使出来的伎俩，我绝对不会忘记这家伙的样子的。<br>
呵，如此近距离一看做的真是逼真又还原啊，一下子消灭了三个人么……<br>
呵呵呵，这才是与演出高潮相匹配的战斗力！就让我来华丽地，把你消灭掉吧！<br>

稍早前的会客室中——<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">{namecode:84}：</span><br>
{namecode:82}……你居然想把第一送给{namecode:74}啊。<br>
<br>
桌面上的三杯清茶余温未尽，但会客室内已冷清无比。<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">{namecode:84}：</span><br>
原本以为你更有格局一些呢……<br>
<br>
在{namecode:84}眉头微皱之时，一阵熟悉的鸟鸣声由远及近，最后轻巧地落在了{namecode:84}的肩头。<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">{namecode:84}：</span><br>
又是你这个小家伙，不是让你找个别的地方去避雨么。<br>
风暴已如此接近，你却还在此处踟蹰……也罢，想留就留吧。<br>
<br>
燕子轻轻叫了几声，似乎对于这个回答格外满意。<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">{namecode:84}：</span><br>
你这小家伙真是有趣……既然这样，燕子啊燕子，我考考你。<br>
你说，这棋盘之上，何人会输，何人会赢呢？<br>
<br>
燕子似乎听懂了一般，歪头盯着桌子看了看，然后摇了摇头，继续梳理羽毛去了。<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">{namecode:84}：</span><br>
汝看不懂是么……呵呵，也是啊，有些难为你了。<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">通讯器：</span><br>
滴——滴——滴————<br>
<br>
{namecode:84}身边的通讯器突然响了三声，然后沉寂下来。<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">{namecode:84}：</span><br>
第七回合还没结束，有些人就已经等不急了么……<br>
呵呵，也罢。那就让本日的重头戏开始吧<br>
吾会如约让汝在今日登上华丽舞台的正中央，成为整个重樱内当之无愧的焦点。<br>
……毕竟这舞台，本就是为你量身定制的啊，呵呵呵……<br>

唔啊啊啊啊啊阿，要被击沉了要被击沉了要被击沉了！<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Miyuki：</span><br>
冷静点{namecode:79}……已经没事了。<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Kaga：</span><br>
倒不如说你居然能没事啊……<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Yamashiro：</span><br>
还好我的保命技能「神乐舞」可以锁血啊！不然就要瞬间下场了呀！<br>
刚刚那是什么情况啊，怎么一下子退场了三个人？！<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Akagi：</span><br>
这就是危机四伏的战争哦。局势瞬息万变，稍有不慎便会粉身碎骨。<br>
大前辈是真敢应邀，但我的策略可不是随便观察几下就能理解的。<br>
不清楚情况就盲目跟在我后面想要反制我，结果呢？呵呵呵~<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ryuuhou：</span><br>
{namecode:91}前辈，新的回合开始了。<br>
本回合的事件卡是「天晴浪高」，按效果所说，在本回合内所有战列舰得到强化的同时，所有驱逐舰会获得减益。<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Akagi：</span><br>
啧……是大前辈准备的战列舰特化卡啊。<br>
真是个喜欢沉湎于过去的人……也不看看现在是什么时代了。<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Kaga：</span><br>
{namecode:91}，接下来要继续进攻中心据点么？<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Akagi：</span><br>
不，中心据点接下来会有点麻烦，现在还不是时候。<br>
首先把阵型收回来，观察一下局势再做决定。{namecode:5}，你的情况如何？<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Miyuki：</span><br>
{namecode:91}大人，非常抱歉……周围都是其他侍从的控制区，{namecode:5}还是没法回来。<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Akagi：</span><br>
嗯……看来她们铁了心是要卡住你了。你先安心呆在那里，等到{namecode:82}的止戈效果结束后我另有安排。<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Miyuki：</span><br>
遵命。<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Yamashiro：</span><br>
只是收回阵型……这回合不进攻其他据点么？<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Akagi：</span><br>
也不是不能打，就是打的话，又要麻烦你去当先锋吸引火力了哦？<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Yamashiro：</span><br>
不不不不不了不了，大家还是花时间恢复一下，恢复好了再打嘛！<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Akagi：</span><br>
呵呵呵，这件事就交给你了哦，{namecode:179}。<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ryuuhou：</span><br>
嗯，尽管放心包在我身上！团队回复的事就交给我的「樱绽凤华」吧~<br>
{{折叠面板|内容结束}}

{{折叠面板|标题=威压|选项=26|主框=1|样式=primary|展开=是}}
<br>
大棋盘·{namecode:82}控制区 第八回合<br>
{namecode:82}队的行动轮已经开始，但众人都还没有从{namecode:73}被赫米忒横扫的震惊中回过神来。<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Kinu：</span><br>
没想到{namecode:73}居然就这么退场了……<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Haguro：</span><br>
只有最先进去的{namecode:91}大人保住了{namecode:79}，其他人都退场了……果然是陷阱。<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Mikasa：</span><br>
不要慌张，现在我们与{namecode:91}不过是回到同一起跑线了而已。<br>
既然她已出招，我们也必须还击才是，大家打起精神来！<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Kongou：</span><br>
没错，战局正要进入白热化的阶段呢。前辈，我们接下来怎么办？<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Mikasa：</span><br>
中心据点价值10分，占领它就基本意味着胜利。<br>
{namecode:91}似乎回去休整了，但本回合的事件卡「天晴浪高」对于我们有优势，不能因为畏惧危险而停止前进。<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Hatakaze：</span><br>
大前辈，让我去中心吧，虽然驱逐舰进攻要塞能力比较弱，但是规避能力好，应该能多撑一会给主力争取时间。<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Mikasa：</span><br>
没问题，在你进入中心后，我与{namecode:70}会和你一同进攻。不过硬拼不是上策，我也有其他安排。<br>
你们已经见识过我的入场技能了，但应该还不知道我的另一个技能「威压」——一回合内能够让敌人的反击能力彻底消失。<br>
这样在本回合中不用担心因为反击而受到的损伤，尽情战斗了。<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Hatakaze：</span><br>
噢~能够白打的话真是再好不过了~<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Haguro：</span><br>
大前辈，那我呢？<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Mikasa：</span><br>
你跟{namecode:181}前去清理据点CD12，依旧是和之前一样，在压制的差不多之后交给{namecode:74}解决。<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Haguro：</span><br>
……又要白送给{namecode:74}大人么？<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Mikasa：</span><br>
没错，现在我与{namecode:84}{namecode:91}三人都将都目光着眼于中心据点，无法分神。<br>
现在，{namecode:74}手中已经有9分，而{namecode:91}和{namecode:84}则是7分与6分，继续这样积累下去，也许能积少而成多哦。<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Hatakaze：</span><br>
双管齐下之策。<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Haguro：</span><br>
我明白了……真是万无一失的考虑，不愧是{namecode:82}大前辈……！<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Mikasa：</span><br>
{namecode:74}大人，这样没问题吧？<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Nagato：</span><br>
嗯，正合吾意。<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Mikasa：</span><br>
呵呵，就让我们两队通力合作，一起沿着胜利的道路前进吧~<br>
<br>
大棋盘·{namecode:74}控制区 第八回合<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Nagato：</span><br>
诸位，接下来，吾将与{namecode:82}全力配合。为了取胜，吾等会同时执行不同的策略。<br>
中心区域的争夺与对{namecode:91}{namecode:84}的牵制就交给{namecode:82}的队伍。<br>
在此期间，吾的队伍必须尽全力攻略一切未被占领的小据点。<br>
既然选择了不进行相互战斗的道路，那就让吾等坚定不移地走到底吧。<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Shoukaku：</span><br>
{namecode:74}大人，我们现在有9分，加上控制区内那个没处理的据点，以及{namecode:82}大人那里的3个，也就只能再拿4分。<br>
13分虽然不少，但还不足以取胜吧……<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Nagato：</span><br>
自然，所以吾等还要把目光着眼于{namecode:84}的控制区，那里还有3个据点。<br>
现在命令，{namecode:157}进入{namecode:82}的控制区，移动至D2，拿下只剩一点耐久值的据点CD12。<br>
{namecode:95}{namecode:72}{namecode:71}，配合吾拿下吾等控制区内最后一个据点GH12，之后向着{namecode:84}的控制区移动。<br>
吾与{namecode:158}就守在这里，防止{namecode:84}和{namecode:91}乘虚而入，这里离中心也近，可以在关键时刻给{namecode:82}提供支援。<br>
诸位开始行动吧，只要团结一心，胜利必将属于吾等！<br>

<br>
大棋盘·{namecode:84}控制区 第八回合<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Sakawa：</span><br>
大前辈在见到那种攻击之后完全没动摇啊，明明已经损失了{namecode:73}了……<br>
连{namecode:91}大人都已经退出去休整了，她居然还在继续进攻。<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Chitose：</span><br>
就损失而言我们才是最大的一方哦……{namecode:27}和{namecode:104}都退场了，我的「千之羽」也没法使用了。<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Wakatsuki：</span><br>
没错……更糟糕的是{namecode:74}大人似乎想对我们的后方乘虚而入，局势非常不妙。<br>
不知道{namecode:84}大人是怎么考虑的……{namecode:226}，你觉得{namecode:84}大人会下来帮我们么？<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Sakawa：</span><br>
会的，而且肯定是关键时刻登场，然后逆转局势！<br>
{namecode:74}大人登场的时候带来了樱花雨构成的结界，{namecode:91}大人登场的时候散发着燃烧的彼岸花。<br>
大前辈登场的时候则是创造了一道无法攻击的屏障，不知道{namecode:84}大人登场时会是什么样子呢……<br>
啊，{namecode:84}大人的命令到了。首先使用的指挥卡是……「见机行事」？<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Chitose：</span><br>
效果有些复杂……好像本回合进行的操作会影响到下次行动，攻击或移动会在下回合收获不同的收益……<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Wakatsuki：</span><br>
{namecode:226}、{namecode:103}，我这边收到了进攻据点IJ78的命令，就先走一步啦~<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Sakawa：</span><br>
我这边的命令…………稍微有些看不懂啊。<br>
…………{namecode:5}。<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Miyuki：</span><br>
嗯，有什么事么？<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Sakawa：</span><br>
两回合的止戈状态已经消除，这片区域又可以相互战斗了。<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Miyuki：</span><br>
好像是这样呢……<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Sakawa：</span><br>
对不住啦，{namecode:84}大人有令，命令我跟{namecode:103}对你展开攻击。<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Miyuki：</span><br>
欸……？我们不是盟友么？<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Sakawa：</span><br>
我也不太清楚{namecode:84}大人的想法，但是没办法，命令就是命令！<br>
作为交换，我会堂堂正正吃下你的反击的！<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Miyuki：</span><br>
这样啊……我明白了。{namecode:5}会作为{namecode:91}大人的侍从全力以赴的，尽管攻过来吧！<br>
<br>
轰——————————！<br>
爆炸声过后，一直被困在{namecode:74}与{namecode:82}队伍之间的{namecode:5}因为耐久归零消失在棋盘上。<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Haguro：</span><br>
什么？！{namecode:84}大人的侍从居然攻击了{namecode:91}大人的侍从？！<br>
她们不是一家的么……不行，我已经完全搞不清状况了。<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Kongou：</span><br>
我也……有些看不懂了，{namecode:82}前辈，{namecode:84}大人的行动究竟是什么意思？<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Mikasa：</span><br>
唔…………我也没想到会发生如此出人预料的事态……<br>
（{namecode:84}与{namecode:91}之间产生不和了？）<br>
（不，不可能。只是一盘棋而已，{namecode:84}在这时候与{namecode:91}产生不和的概率无限接近于零。）<br>
（所以……这项特殊的举动肯定也是二人商量过的结果。）<br>
（以此可以反推，这项举动所带来的结果就是二人这么做的目的。）<br>
（结果上来说，{namecode:226}受伤，{namecode:5}退场……侍从数减少……也就是说减少侍从就是这么做的目的。）<br>
不好，{namecode:84}正在协助{namecode:91}减少场上的侍从人数！<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Haguro：</span><br>
欸？{namecode:84}大人为什么要这么做啊？！<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Mikasa：</span><br>
恐怕，{namecode:91}{namecode:92}一直没有使用过的技能就与此有关，她们的技能肯定能从中获得增益！<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Kongou：</span><br>
原来如此……如果这样的话上回合{namecode:84}极其不合理的行动也能解释的通了……<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Mikasa：</span><br>
真没想到，{namecode:74}的战术居然歪打正着对{namecode:91}产生了反制作用啊……<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Haguro：</span><br>
……通过减少人数才能发动的技能么，听起来好危险。<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Hatakaze：</span><br>
根据规则书的感觉来看，设定通过减少人数作为发动前提的技能，一定拥有很强力的效果……<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Haguro：</span><br>
靠牺牲同伴获得收益的设计思路，本身就很恐怖吧！<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Hatakaze：</span><br>
确实是有些恐怖的设计思路，但是很有{namecode:91}的特色哦。<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Mikasa：</span><br>
不过让{namecode:225}转头进攻小据点的理由我也暂时没想明白，靠{namecode:225}自己是阻止不了{namecode:74}那边得分的……得观察一下后续情况。<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Kinu：</span><br>
大前辈，{namecode:84}大人结束了回合，要进入第九回合了。<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Mikasa：</span><br>
嗯，这回合正常结束，中心再没出现奇怪的机制。<br>
本来以为{namecode:84}会借助这回合「天晴浪高」的效果入场做点事呢……<br>
没想到在她打出那张「见机行事」之后，就进行了一些我都没能完全看懂的部署。<br>
有趣啊……有趣。<br>

<br>
大棋盘·{namecode:91}控制区 第九回合<br>
伴随着回合开始的提示，和煦的微风拂过了棋盘的每一个角落，也拂过了{namecode:91}队的各位侍从。<br>
触发的事件卡名为「神木之风」，在每一名侍从开始行动和结束时，会分别获得一次恢复效果。<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Akagi：</span><br>
一看就是{namecode:74}大人准备的事件卡……这是要当乌龟当到底啊。<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ryuuhou：</span><br>
可惜{namecode:5}没机会体验了……我还是不明白，{namecode:91}大人，{namecode:84}大人刚刚为什么会突然对{namecode:5}发动攻击啊？<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Kaga：</span><br>
不用担心，都是计划内的一环。<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Akagi：</span><br>
嗯。既然，{namecode:74}和{namecode:82}铁了心要把她卡住，那除此之外就没有其他办法了。<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ryuuhou：</span><br>
……这样啊。那我们本回合怎么办？大前辈又继续开始对中心区域的攻略了，我们要跟上么？<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Akagi：</span><br>
呵呵，把{namecode:140}消灭掉确实也是可选项之一。<br>
我还挺想看看如果{namecode:140}退场了，大前辈接下来要再选谁进去顶着呢~<br>
{namecode:179}，{namecode:92}跟我一起对{namecode:140}发动攻击。<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ryuuhou：</span><br>
前辈，舰载机飞过中心区域时会遭受干扰，{namecode:140}现在的状态还很好，我们不一定能将她一举拿下。<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Akagi：</span><br>
无妨，反正大前辈也差不多能猜到我想做什么了，意思到了就行。<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Yamashiro：</span><br>
那我呢？我不进入中心区域就攻击不到{namecode:140}哦——当然我不会进去就是了！<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Akagi：</span><br>
你的话，这回合干脆利用一下事件卡的效果，向着周围随便走走好了。<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Yamashiro：</span><br>
真的吗？太好了……这么下去{namecode:79}很快就能满血复活了！<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ryuuhou：</span><br>
嗯，加油哦，{namecode:79}，之后中心据点的攻略还需要你呢！<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Yamashiro：</span><br>
欸<nowiki>~~~~~~~~~</nowiki><br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Akagi：</span><br>
呵呵，我们就充分利用一下{namecode:74}大人准备的事件卡，先让大前辈先在中间努力吧~<br>
{{折叠面板|内容结束}}

{{折叠面板|标题=联合行动|选项=29|主框=1|样式=primary|展开=是}}
<br>
大棋盘·{namecode:82}控制区 第九回合<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Hatakaze：</span><br>
呼呼呼，果然对我发动攻击了，还好吾的机动护卫能连自己也护卫上。<br>
这下大前辈你的猜测就完全证实了呢。<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Mikasa：</span><br>
嗯，果然如此……既然已经证实了猜测，就必须要针对一下了。<br>
暂停对中心的攻略，{namecode:140}你撤出来吧，前往据点CD34内休整。只要我们控制住侍从退场的数量，就能遏制住{namecode:91}的战略。<br>
现在临近终盘，如果她再不行动进攻中心据点的话，按照目前的积分，胜利的就是{namecode:74}的了。<br>
{namecode:91}才是着急的那一边，我们以不变应万变，等待她的下一步行动。<br>
{namecode:181}{namecode:65}继续进攻据点AB12，帮助{namecode:74}大人占领这个据点。<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Haguro：</span><br>
了解……包在我们身上。<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Mikasa：</span><br>
接下来的唯一变数就是{namecode:84}……不过她只有一架航母，不论如何也不可能越过中心区消灭刚刚进行过两次恢复的{namecode:140}。<br>
嗯……{namecode:70}前往E4，我亲自看住D5，这样就万无一失了。<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Kongou：</span><br>
遵命，这样一来，{namecode:84}大人就是想闯过中心区域强攻也不可能了呢。<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Mikasa：</span><br>
没错。我已经做了所有能做的准备，接下来就让局势自然发展吧。<br>
<br>
大棋盘·{namecode:74}控制区 第九回合<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Harutsuki：</span><br>
{namecode:74}大人，针对据点AB12的攻击结束了，我们又拿下了一分。<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Nagato：</span><br>
吾知道了，非常感谢二位的协助。<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Hiei：</span><br>
{namecode:74}大人，我们这边也结束了，我们成功赶在{namecode:84}大人前面抢下了据点IJ78。<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Wakatsuki：</span><br>
{namecode:74}大人，您能够抓住机会进行如此果断的行动，令我十分佩服……<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Nagato：</span><br>
吾是不会攻击汝的，但是视线所能及的一切据点，吾都要收下。<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Wakatsuki：</span><br>
如果{namecode:84}大人不命令我阻止您的话……{namecode:225}只能祝您一切顺利。<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Nagato：</span><br>
吾的行动结束，{namecode:84}，{namecode:91}，出招吧。<br>
{{折叠面板|内容结束}}

{{折叠面板|标题=公方之刃|选项=30|主框=1|样式=primary|展开=是}}
<br>
与此同时的会客室中——<br>
雷声轰隆，暴雨倾盆。<br>
{namecode:84}没有点灯，只是静静坐在愈发昏暗的会客室中注视着棋盘。<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">{namecode:84}：</span><br>
凭借你的智慧，应该已经猜到{namecode:91}的意图了吧……<br>
呵呵，没错，退场的人越多，{namecode:91}就越强。<br>
现在已经退场了5人，再这么继续下去，可能会发生非常恐怖的事哦。<br>
当然，我会全力帮助{namecode:91}实现这一意图就是了。<br>
{namecode:82}，虽然你有意保护{namecode:140}，但是……能撑得住吾这一轮攻势么？<br>
<br>
{namecode:84}打出的指挥卡在小棋盘上化为一把利刃，笔直地插在了{namecode:140}所在的位置。<br>
紧接着，{namecode:103}的位置上出现了一队舰载机，对{namecode:140}进行了一轮猛烈轰炸。<br>
闪光过后，{namecode:140}从棋盘上消失了。<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">{namecode:84}：</span><br>
这样一来就是6人退场。很遗憾，看来汝没挡住呢……<br>
那就再进一步，让{namecode:226}{namecode:103}一起进入中心据点的控制区好了。<br>
然后是{namecode:74}那边……吾又让{namecode:225}进攻了一个小据点。<br>
{namecode:74}应该也差不多看懂吾的意图了……当然，就算没明白也肯定会紧追而上。<br>
既然下决心想要用积分取胜，那每一分就无比关键……<br>
只是，不论汝现在分数如何领先，只要{namecode:91}攻破中心据点的话，就是她的完美逆转。<br>
呵呵，两边我都在推波助澜，{namecode:82}，你打算如何应对呢？<br>
{{折叠面板|内容结束}}

{{折叠面板|标题=日蚀|选项=31|主框=1|样式=primary|展开=是}}
<br>
大棋盘·{namecode:91}控制区 第十回合<br>
第十回合，以渐暗的天空为标志，事件卡「日蚀」生效了。<br>
上回合事件卡所带来温暖煦风，转眼就被笼罩了整片海域的昏暗与烦闷所取代。<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Kaga：</span><br>
第十回合……本回合就是最后一张事件卡了。<br>
日蚀……姐姐。你觉得{namecode:84}做这张卡想表达什么呢？<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Akagi：</span><br>
谁知道呢，我不在乎也不关心，不过这气氛倒是塑造得不错，正适合给这盘棋收尾。<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Yamashiro：</span><br>
是啊……有种阴森恐怖的气氛，令人毛骨悚然。<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ryuuhou：</span><br>
刚刚那把从天而降的刀是{namecode:84}大人的指挥卡吧?没想到一整局打法都十分委婉的{namecode:84}大人也准备了那么直接的卡。<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Akagi：</span><br>
那张指挥卡的名字叫做「公方之刃」，顾名思义，是专门用来消灭不听话之人的雷霆手段哦。<br>
大前辈以为躲过了我这边就一切安全了么，呵呵。<br>
{namecode:79}，休息得差不多了吧？你现在去E6，为我们铺平进攻的道路。<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Yamashiro：</span><br>
欸？！E6，那不是中心据点的控制区吗？我现在技能都没好，耐久也只恢复了一半，大前辈那边也肯定会一起打过来……<br>
然后我就要退场了……不妥不妥，要不咱们再等一回合吧，诶嘿嘿~<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ryuuhou：</span><br>
{namecode:91}前辈，{namecode:79}目前的状态确实不适合继续作战，还是让我去吧。<br>
反正也不是非要{namecode:79}才行，只要有一个人进入据点控制区，我们所有人就都能攻击中心据点了。<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Akagi：</span><br>
…………这个倒确实是谁都可以。<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Kaga：</span><br>
姐姐，还是让我去吧。<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Akagi：</span><br>
……{namecode:92}？你确定么。<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Kaga：</span><br>
嗯，我计算过了，没问题，不需要让{namecode:179}去冒险。<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Akagi：</span><br>
……你的意思我明白。也罢，你去吧。<br>
其余人，在{namecode:92}到位之后随我一起对赫米忒发动攻击。<br>
呵呵，万事已经具备，让我们进入最后的总攻时刻吧~<br>

<br>
大棋盘·{namecode:82}&{namecode:74}控制区 第十回合<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Kinu：</span><br>
天……暗下来了。在结界里连天象变化都做得出来啊。<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Haguro：</span><br>
{namecode:84}大人引发的的日蚀……有点不祥的感觉。<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Kongou：</span><br>
是啊，古时候都是这么认为的呢。不过随着时代的发展，大家都知道这只是普通的天文现象了。<br>
虽然看上去确实有点渗人……<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Mikasa：</span><br>
也不要把古人想的太愚昧了，其实当时的人自然也知道这是天文现象的。<br>
所谓日蚀象征灾祸，多数还是用于劝谏之时的借口。<br>
具体到{namecode:84}这次的用意上来……<br>
“麒麟斗而日月蚀，鲸鲵死而彗星出，河变应于千年，山崩由于朽壤。”<br>
恐怕其意为此吧。<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Haguro：</span><br>
有点复杂……<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Mikasa：</span><br>
呵呵，等对局结束之后带着问题去问{namecode:140}吧，我就先卖个关子。<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Kongou：</span><br>
{namecode:82}前辈，日蚀的效果与海雾不同，日蚀之下所有人的攻击距离都会受到影响，这回合不用太担心空袭的问题了吧。<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Mikasa：</span><br>
嗯，{namecode:91}已经开始进攻中心据点了，光凭{namecode:103}一个人就算打过来也没什么意义。<br>
只是{namecode:84}那边……唉，她是每回合行动的最后一人还真是不方便进行判断……<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Nagato：</span><br>
{namecode:82}，汝来决定战略，吾一定全力配合。<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Mikasa：</span><br>
好，那我就来说一下我的分析与计划吧。<br>
现在是第十回合中盘，棋局将在十二回合结束，{namecode:91}既然选择开始进攻中心据点，就不太可能再来与我们相互争斗。<br>
因此我打算亲自前往四个接触点中仅存的E5处站住。<br>
如果{namecode:91}受到我的挑衅全力打我，那她们就不太可能在十二回合全部结束前占领中心据点了。<br>
只要{namecode:91}得不到这十分，最后根据积分结算，获胜的一定是积分最高的{namecode:74}。<br>
{namecode:91}若坚定自己的计划不受挑衅，那也没有大碍。{namecode:91}与{namecode:92}的技能虽然没有公开，但毫无疑问会用在中心据点的攻略上。<br>
我们只要规划好自己的行动，就不用太在意她们的动作。<br>
目前最大的变数就是{namecode:84}，她还有一张指挥卡没有用，本人也没有入场。<br>
{namecode:84}不入场，我们就没机会弄清楚她的战略究竟是什么。<br>
因此我打算彻底屏蔽掉她的操作空间。{namecode:74}，这方面就需要你的配合了。<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Nagato：</span><br>
汝尽管说。<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Mikasa：</span><br>
{namecode:181}与{namecode:65}进攻据点AB34，之后{namecode:157}将其拿下。<br>
现在继续防守{namecode:84}入侵已经没有意义了，因此让{namecode:158}也去参与争夺据点。<br>
这样的话，{namecode:95}{namecode:158}就能和之前一样抢下被{namecode:225}进攻过的据点IJ910。<br>
{namecode:72}和{namecode:71}去进攻最后一个可进攻的据点GH910。<br>
虽然本回合全员的攻击射程被缩减，但她们二人的技能组合可以相互配合进行一轮爆发式打击。<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Nagato：</span><br>
{namecode:71}的技能是「威光的御召舰」，可以让所有人无视射程限制进攻自己攻击过的目标。<br>
{namecode:72}的则是「烈光的武勋舰」，本回合所有属性翻倍，但是下回合无法进行任何移动。<br>
确实是完美的配合啊……<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Mikasa：</span><br>
呵呵，之前仔细设计了那么久，就是考虑到也许会有这种情况。<br>
总之，现在已经不用考虑下回合的事了，这回合就把火力全部倾泻掉，拿掉所有能拿的积分。<br>
这样{namecode:84}除了进攻中心据点之外，就没有任何得分的方式了。<br>
在上述攻略结束之后，你拥有的积分就是16分，我7分，{namecode:91}8分，{namecode:84}6分。<br>
中心据点价值10分。落入你我手中自不必说，就算落入{namecode:84}手中那她也只有16分，是平局。<br>
而这一部署可以在{namecode:84}行动之前完成，接下来不论她留的指挥卡是什么，是否入场，都已经没意义了。<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Nagato：</span><br>
吾的胜机，终于要出现了啊……<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Mikasa：</span><br>
正是如此。不积跬步，无以至千里。不积小流，无以成江海。<br>
{namecode:74}，你从头到尾坚持贯彻自己的理念，终于要迎来开花结果的时候了。<br>
不过，在真正胜利之前我们不能放松警惕。<br>
作为第二手准备，请你绕过EF12据点向我所在的E5接近，这是我们两家唯一能进入中心据点的位置。<br>
不论{namecode:91}{namecode:92}下回合想做什么，凭借她们现在的战斗力，想一回合消灭中心据点还是太异想天开了。<br>
剩下的就是我们的机会。如果下回合我这边没能拿下中心据点的话，我会退出E5，之后你带人进去，全力输出将其拿下。<br>
只要你我接力进攻，收下胜利绝非妄谈！<br>

大棋盘·{namecode:84}控制区 第十回合<br>
在这个无比关键的回合，{namecode:84}没有打出自己的最后一张指挥卡。<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Haguro：</span><br>
{namecode:84}大人是放弃了么……？<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Kongou：</span><br>
那可是{namecode:84}大人，不会这么轻易放弃的。她一定是有什么其他安排，我有种不太好的预感……<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Harutsuki：</span><br>
大家快看，{namecode:84}大人的侍从开始行动了！<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Chitose：</span><br>
{namecode:84}大人的命令确认，即将对中心区域的仲裁者·赫忒米·IX展开攻击。<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Wakatsuki：</span><br>
{namecode:103}，我来支援你了哦。<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Chitose：</span><br>
……{namecode:225}，你之前一直在进攻据点，都没有休整过吧。<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Wakatsuki：</span><br>
是的，{namecode:103}不也一样？<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Chitose：</span><br>
以我们现在的状态，恐怕受到进攻的反击之后就要双双退场了……<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Wakatsuki：</span><br>
恐怕是的……没能在场内见证棋盘的结局确实有些遗憾，不过既然是{namecode:84}大人的命令，我心中便没有丝毫犹豫。<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Chitose：</span><br>
说的也是……已经在棋盘中待了这么久，乐趣也享受的差不多了。<br>
接下来就去休息室里和{namecode:104}一起边吃好吃的，边等待最终结果好了~<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Wakatsuki：</span><br>
其实……我昨天在休息室内藏了一大盒点心哦，想着给先进入休息室内的同伴们留点惊喜。<br>
如果还没有被人发现的话，我们就先偷偷吃掉一部分，再跟大家分掉吧~<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Chitose：</span><br>
好主意！那事不宜迟，就让我们开始最后的进攻吧！<br>
<span style="color:#ec5d53;">Arbiter: The Hermit IX：</span><br>
………………<br>
<br>
轰——————————！<br>
就这样，{namecode:225}与{namecode:103}退场了。<br>
与此同时——————<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Sakawa：</span><br>
{namecode:92}大人，得罪了，这也是{namecode:84}大人的命令。<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Kaga：</span><br>
如果想来进攻我，也要做好被反噬的觉悟哦。<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Sakawa：</span><br>
{namecode:92}大人难道有什么危险的技能么？<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Kaga：</span><br>
呵呵，这个你很快就能知道了，尽管攻过来吧。<br>
<br>
轰——————————！<br>
光芒闪过，{namecode:92}化为了发光的碎片。<br>
但是，与此前退场的人不同，碎片并没有消散，而是化为了一只巨大的妖狐<br>
妖狐向着{namecode:226}扑去，{namecode:226}立刻被蓝色的烈焰所覆盖。<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Sakawa：</span><br>
哎…………欸？！这是什么情况！要烧起来了欸！！<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Kaga：</span><br>
信条……「弱肉强食」。你就与我一同随着苍蓝的火焰消散吧。<br>
<br>
伴随着{namecode:92}与{namecode:226}的退场，原本处于{namecode:84}控制的所有据点上空也出现了猛烈的白光。<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Nagato：</span><br>
刚刚发生了……什么？<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Kongou：</span><br>
{namecode:84}大人直到侍从全灭都没有进场……换言之，现在棋盘上没有任何属于{namecode:84}大人的棋子。<br>
从规则上来看，{namecode:84}大人已经输了。因此……所有原本由{namecode:84}大人控制的据点也会变为无人所属状态。<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Nagato：</span><br>
{namecode:84}！汝见到没有取胜机会之后，就用这种方式放弃了么！<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Mikasa：</span><br>
不……是见到自己没有取胜机会后，就果断用最后的全部力量为{namecode:91}的胜利做铺垫了……<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Nagato：</span><br>
{namecode:82}，吾等还有机会。如果吾先一步接收了{namecode:84}的领地，那么吾就拥有了22分。而{namecode:91}的得分极限是21分。<br>
不……不用这么长时间，只要吾能拿下{namecode:84}的那一个小据点，吾就会变为17分。{namecode:91}就算之后再拿下中心据点也没用。<br>
时间已经不允许她多线作战了！<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Haguro：</span><br>
{namecode:74}大人，大前辈你们看……那只狐狸还停留在场上，与{namecode:91}停在同一格了。<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Mikasa：</span><br>
果然还有后手……<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Kaga：</span><br>
{namecode:82}前辈，对于我与姐姐一直隐藏的技能，你应该有了不少猜测吧。<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Mikasa：</span><br>
……从你退场之后还能以这样的形式留在场上的情况来看，说明我的猜测基本正确啊。<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Kaga：</span><br>
在谜底揭晓之前，不妨前辈先来说说推论吧？<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Mikasa：</span><br>
刚刚一次性退场了4人，目前现阶段合计退场了9人。<br>
{namecode:91}一直在等待着场上侍从退场，说明她的另一个技能应该是退场的侍从越多，自身的的战斗力就越强。<br>
因为在战斗过程中没看到她的战斗力出现明显变化，说明这应该是一个可以自由选择时机进行激活的主动技能。<br>
而你虽然退场了，却依旧以这样的形式停留在{namecode:91}的格子里，说明你的另一个技能可以在退场之后给予{namecode:91}某些帮助。<br>
我猜的不错吧？<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Akagi：</span><br>
（鼓掌声）不愧是{namecode:82}大前辈，猜的完全正确哦。<br>
看你的部署，你应该还盘算着等到下回合，我的进攻失败后，与{namecode:74}接力抢下中心据点吧。<br>
或者因为{namecode:84}退场，领地空出，你们想重新把她的领地占领回来依靠积分取胜？<br>
哈哈哈哈，我怎么可能留出这种机会给你们？<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Nagato：</span><br>
{namecode:91}……现在日蚀尚在，依然还是第十回合，汝为何可以行动？<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Akagi：</span><br>
{namecode:74}大人，你的问题应该是，为什么{namecode:84}已经退场了，新的回合却还没有开始呢？<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Kaga：</span><br>
现在谜底揭晓。{namecode:82}前辈，我在自己退场时，可以赋予姐姐一次移动和与本回合退场人数相同的额外攻击次数。<br>
本回合退场的侍从数量是4，也就是说，姐姐接下来可以进行四次战斗。<br>
而姐姐的技能就如同你猜测的那样，我就不在此赘述了。<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Nagato：</span><br>
{namecode:91}，汝就为了这个，就让一半人退场了么？！<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Akagi：</span><br>
是啊，不然呢？而且，我就要因此而取得胜利了哦？<br>
失败者就请在一旁看好，接下来，是属于胜利者的表演时间了——<br>
呵呵呵呵，哈哈哈哈哈哈哈————<br>

<br>
——此处乃重樱圣地，尊贵之人所处的居所。<br>
宏伟城池的天守阁中，黑发的丽人静静凝视着前方。<br>
电光划破阴云落在她的身上，于木质地板上落下若隐若现的淡影。<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">{namecode:84}：</span><br>
如此一来，胜负已定……<br>
<br>
窗外，呼啸而过的风雨正猎猎作响，屋内，燕子已经不见踪影了。<br>
也许是找到了更好的避雨之处，也许是被眼前突变的景象吓到了。<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">{namecode:84}：</span><br>
「月下彼岸花」，{namecode:91}为自己的表演准备了一个哀伤又浪漫的名字哦。<br>
{namecode:82}，汝是想要下回合与{namecode:74}一起从{namecode:91}手中抢下胜利吧。<br>
只可惜，日蚀之下，一切战斗结果都是确定的……<br>
中心据点将会陷落，对局也将迎来终结。很遗憾，汝输了。<br>
汝过于在意吾的行动，因而丧失了时机。<br>
此番棋局，吾只是为了享受乐趣罢了。<br>
可是汝又如何？明知目标在于{namecode:91}，却没有集中力量应对她。<br>
既已意识到危险，就应该干净利落地将其排除……<br>
可惜，汝听不到吾的答案了。<br>
实在是，可惜……<br>
这场棋盘为舞台的剧目，终于到了属于谢幕之时。<br>
该去迎接胜利者归来了————<br>
<br>
中心区域此刻正笼罩在一片赤红之中。<br>
高塔已经破碎，不受控的能量肆意向周边扩散着，诉说着这里发生战斗的惨状。<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Akagi：</span><br>
呵呵，真想不到，我们会在这种场合下见面，{namecode:84}还真是给了我一个惊喜。<br>
我可是等这一刻很久了哟，赫米忒。<br>
如何？冒犯我的代价，不好受吧？<br>
<br>
不久前还不可一世的仲裁者·赫米忒·IX，此刻正如同垃圾一般倒在水面上。<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Akagi：</span><br>
当然，我知道你不过是被创造出来的和本体毫无关系的量产机罢了。<br>
但是又有什么关系呢？这次我打倒了你的象征，下次我就能打倒你的本体。<br>
你觉得我说得对不对啊，赫米忒？<br>
<br>
{namecode:91}慢慢走近倒下的赫米忒，扯下了仲裁者舰装上的提灯。<br>
提灯之上已经没有了此前战斗时萦绕周边的危险光芒，留下的仅仅是一个完好无损的废弃品。<br>
<span style="color:#ff9900;">{namecode:91}：</span><br>
呵呵呵呵，你也就这般本事啊。<br>
没错，像废品一样堆在垃圾堆里才是你们这群自诩为塞壬的机器人的最终命运。<br>
想要来操纵我？就凭你们还差的远呢~哈哈哈哈哈~<br>
大前辈和{namecode:74}到现在还被蒙在鼓里吧。<br>
就算见到了由中心装置释放出的如此规模的能量冲击，恐怕也只会当成什么结界里设定的余兴节目吧。<br>
呵呵呵呵呵，连这场实验的目的都没看出来……真是愚昧，愚不可及啊……！<br>
就凭你们也想来阻止我么？<br>
就凭你们也想掌控重樱的命运么？<br>
狂妄！自大！能够掌控重樱命运的人在很久以前就不存在了！<br>
为什么从来就没人认识到这一点呢？！<br>
……我并不适合领导重樱前进？你们以为这种事我本人心里不清楚吗？！<br>
…………我是迫不得已啊，除此之外已经没有别的办法了！<br>
必须由我来负担重樱的命运，必须由我来决定重樱的道路才行！<br>
姐姐没有做到的事，必须由我这个妹妹来做！<br>
只有我才有资格，亲手把重樱的命运交还给她！<br>
你们明白么？！除了我之外，交给你们任何人都不行！<br>
啊，跟你这个垃圾说你也听不明白吧……<br>
不过算了，我现在心情好，允许你在消失之前当个安安静静的旁听者。<br>
<br>
{namecode:91}举起提灯对准塔的方向，不再关注一旁尚未完全终止活动的仲裁者<br>
透过水晶面，塔肆意而出的能量仿佛呈现出五彩斑斓的虹光。<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">{namecode:91}：</span><br>
……呵呵呵呵，俾斯麦也不过是懦夫而已。<br>
你不敢做的事，就由我来做。你不敢接受的力量，就由我来接受。<br>
我会收下这股力量，引领重樱继续前进，直到把重樱交付到正确的人手中为止。<br>
为此，我不在乎牺牲，也不在乎代价……<br>
就算将重樱燃烧殆尽，就算将我自身燃烧殆尽，就算将世界燃烧殆尽——<br>
————又有何妨呢？<br>

<br>
翌日，万里晴空。天气晴朗到好像昨日的怪异天气完全不曾存在过。<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Yamashiro：</span><br>
唔啊……天变的好快。<br>
昨天一片漆黑雷雨大作，从棋盘里出来之后我都没太分清楚是不是真的出来了……<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Musashi：</span><br>
这里的天气有时候就是会这样呢，不过本日是晴空万里就好，各位回去路上也能顺顺利利了。<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Yamashiro：</span><br>
是啊，真是天公作美~那么大前辈，{namecode:74}大人，还有{namecode:84}大人，我们就先告辞了。<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Musashi：</span><br>
嗯，有空常来玩哦。<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Mikasa：</span><br>
{namecode:84}大人，怎么本日告别的时候没见到{namecode:91}和{namecode:92}啊，取得了胜利之后这么低调可不像她们的风格。<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Musashi：</span><br>
关于这件事……好像昨夜出现了什么突发情况，她们两位收到消息后就连夜离开了。<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Mikasa：</span><br>
居然冒着大雨连夜离开……？希望没出什么大事才好。<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Musashi：</span><br>
是啊……可惜{namecode:91}大人走得十分匆忙，我也不清楚具体发生了什么情况。<br>
{namecode:82}大人和{namecode:74}大人要在我这里住一阵么？<br>
除了棋盘之外，我这里还有不少有趣的游戏哦。<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Mikasa：</span><br>
多谢您的好意，不过您事务繁忙，我们就不便继续打扰了。<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Musashi：</span><br>
这样啊……哦对了，{namecode:74}大人，之前说的量产型性能测试一事，等我准备好了之后会再联系你的。<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Nagato：</span><br>
汝居然还记得啊……嗯，那就静候汝的联络了。<br>
告辞了，{namecode:84}。<br>
抱歉……{namecode:82}，没有按照你在来之前准备好的计划行动。<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Mikasa：</span><br>
没想到{namecode:74}大人也对于一盘棋的结果念念不忘啊？<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Nagato：</span><br>
不是赢了之后{namecode:84}就会回答汝的问题么，要是吾早些知道——<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Mikasa：</span><br>
——打住，不要为没发生的事苦恼了。答案只是“可能”会有而已。<br>
我有种预感，只有首先回答出她提出来的问题，之后才能得到她真正的答案。<br>
{namecode:84}提到的剧本，海若的下落，御神木如今的用途……<br>
不首先把这些都搞清楚，我们可回答不出她提出的问题啊。<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Nagato：</span><br>
虽败，但是收获颇丰，可以这么看么？<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Mikasa：</span><br>
嗯~走吧，我们也该回去筹备下一步的行动计划了————<br>

<br>
帕克菲克洋·铁血浮岛要塞<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Zuikaku：</span><br>
呼……就是这里了吧。之前那次镜面海域生成设施不是被破坏了么，没想到又重新修好了啊……不愧是铁血。<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">通讯器：</span><br>
请出示身份证明————<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Zuikaku：</span><br>
重樱航空母舰{namecode:96}，前来进行外交访问。验证编码为————<br>
<br>
{namecode:96}面对空无一物的水面，对着突然从通讯器中响起的声音报上了身份与识别码。<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">通讯器：</span><br>
身份已验证成功，欢迎您的来访，{namecode:96}小姐。<br>
<br>
在验明身份获得进入许可后，巨大的铁血浮岛要塞随即出现在眼前。<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Zuikaku：</span><br>
…………这也是某种全新设计……？此前的镜面海域并没有这种东西啊……<br>
只要知道具体位置不论什么人都能进来……镜面海域不就是这种东西么？<br>
没想到设计了某种进入认证，是为了防止再被塞壬渗透进来么……<br>
<br>
{namecode:96}一边思考着，一边穿梭在要塞巨大的构件之中。<br>
虽是故地重游，但她还是惊讶地发现，映入眼中的风景相比于上次到访已经发生了翻天覆地的变化。<br>
一路上，除了各处或是宣示警戒或是协助导航的语音，{namecode:96}没有碰到任何一个人。<br>
所见之处只有在自动化运行的各类工厂设施，以及在设备间穿梭的，不知由何人操控的量产型。<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Zuikaku：</span><br>
有种好奇怪的感觉……上次来的时候这里还是训练场，现在已经变成某种巨型生产基地了么……<br>
而且……怎么会一个人都没有。<br>
铁血要塞虽然历来都有种阴森的气氛，但是今天这个……格外阴森啊。<br>
…………如果不是身负{namecode:84}大人的正式命令，我真想掉头回去…………<br>
<br>
跟随着通讯器中没有任何感情的机械音，{namecode:96}最终来到了一处高塔前，这里似乎是铁血要塞的核心位置。<br>
而在高塔之前，{namecode:96}在一个如同入口雕塑的设施上发现了一个似曾相识的“物件”。<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Zuikaku：</span><br>
镶嵌在其中的……难道是“海若”？<br>
不对不对……海若不是早就跟随{namecode:182}大人的舰队返回本土了么，大前辈也是这么说的肯定错不了。<br>
那这个究竟是什么东西……？<br>
<br>
{namecode:96}走到近处，仔细观察着面前被镶嵌入机械结构的“神石”状物体。<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Zuikaku：</span><br>
尺寸不对，颜色不对形状也不对……好奇怪，刚刚我为什么第一眼会把它当成海若呢？<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Bismarck：</span><br>
欢迎你的到来，{namecode:96}小姐。<br>
<br>
一旁突然出现在空气中的影像打断了{namecode:96}的沉思。<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Zuikaku：</span><br>
您是……铁血的俾斯麦？！<br>
之前在对战构建者的决战时，从广播中听闻您的身体已经康复的消息，真是令人无比振奋。<br>
不过据我所知，在腓特烈大帝走后您现在应该接过了铁血的领导权，应该位于铁血本土才对……<br>
为什么您现在会出现在这里？！<br>
而且……我面前这个镶嵌在装置中的物体究竟是？<br>
它和我们的神石海若之间有什么关系么？<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Bismarck：</span><br>
呵呵，你一次问的问题太多了，{namecode:96}小姐。<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Zuikaku：</span><br>
啊……非常抱歉，一下子稍微有点震惊就……<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Bismarck：</span><br>
没关系，总之进来聊吧。<br>
我相信你有很多问题，而在你完成任务返回重樱之前，我有很长时间可以替你解答呢————<br>

<br>
大棋盘·中心区域<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Musashi：</span><br>
{namecode:39}，观测的结果如何？<br>
<span style="color:#a020f0;">Jintsuu META：</span><br>
很顺利。从数据上来看，海若的表现很稳定……<br>
其已经成功将元魔方以{namecode:91}希望的某种方式进行重塑了。<br>
现在她可以自由地以自己的意志使用元魔方，而不用担心步俾斯麦的后尘。<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Musashi：</span><br>
看起来是成功了……不过这种事真的就能这么顺利么？<br>
<span style="color:#a020f0;">Jintsuu META：</span><br>
曾经我们做过类似的实验，这一次不过是再次实践罢了。<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Musashi：</span><br>
但是经过处理的只有元魔方……承受着如此强烈的能量流动，构成{namecode:91}「基础」的魔方会怎么样？<br>
<span style="color:#a020f0;">Jintsuu META：</span><br>
会不可避免的受到影响，然后逐渐崩坏解体……至于时间就因人而异了。<br>
当然，这个过程比直接用元魔方照一下要好得多，及时停手的话也能有救。<br>
不过其实，你也不怎么在乎{namecode:91}的事吧……<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Musashi：</span><br>
也就是说这项技术的本质，并不是将META化变的无害，而只是尽可能延长META化舰船的使用期限罢了……<br>
<span style="color:#a020f0;">Jintsuu META：</span><br>
因为这只是一个中间过程，但只要以海若为核心的决战兵器能够成功制作出来，彻底可控又稳定的META化就不再是问题了。<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Musashi：</span><br>
你自己是如何META化的？<br>
<span style="color:#a020f0;">Jintsuu META：</span><br>
你不是已经靠自己推理出答案了么……咳咳咳……<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Musashi：</span><br>
你这么差的身体也和这个“中间过程”有关？<br>
<span style="color:#a020f0;">Jintsuu META：</span><br>
那倒不是，我在使用的时候这项技术已经很成熟了。我的身体问题源于某个更加悲惨的事件，我不是很想回忆。<br>
况且尽管如此，我也有理智有力量地活着，这还不够么？<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Musashi：</span><br>
你一直都在强调决战兵器的用处。<br>
可是之前你们有决战兵器，为什么也打输了？<br>
<span style="color:#a020f0;">Jintsuu META：</span><br>
……那是因为，决战兵器没有被投入战场，有一个过于谨慎的人一直在阻止这件事。<br>
而且很遗憾，那个人在最后成功了。<br>
所以我们这次一定不能重蹈覆辙，你明白么？<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Musashi：</span><br>
……你的话语中有一种令人熟悉又让人安心的气息。<br>
这实在是太危险了。你的目的究竟是什么，为什么要来帮我？<br>
<span style="color:#a020f0;">Jintsuu META：</span><br>
我已经时日无多，只是想在倒下之前，弥补过去记忆中的些许遗憾罢了……<br>
今天的成功只是万里之路的第一步，{namecode:84}大人，让我们抓紧时间吧……<br>

<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Shinano ：</span><br>
{namecode:84}，妾身发现了一系列比较在意的事，因此发来了这封联络。<br>
博览会举行首日，妾身在会场中发现了不寻常的气息。<br>
在妾身第一时间提醒了维内托之后，问题似乎被撒丁帝国在暗中解决了。<br>
不过，在那之后妾身依然隐约有些不协调感，而且异样感一直没有消失。<br>
这件事妾身还在调查之中，也许只是错觉吧。<br>
之后的几日，会场中十分和平。各大阵营都严格遵守了停火协议，没有发生冲突。<br>
塞壬也没有来捣乱，听撒丁帝国说，整片陆间海都没有出现塞壬袭击。<br>
然而在第六日，塞壬似乎对皇家群岛发动了一次规模介于试探与进攻之间的不大不小的突袭。<br>
最合理的猜测是，这是塞壬对于此前皇家在NA海域中行动的报复。<br>
不过这次事件的异常之处有三点——<br>
其一，皇家舰队根本就没有参与针对构建者主机的作战行动。<br>
其二，NA海域在构建者的主机被消灭后，塞壬的控制力已经大幅减弱，此等规模的舰队究竟是如何被组织起来的令人生疑。<br>
其三，这次袭击似乎也在皇家的预料之中，因为伊丽莎白女王早就部署了大量舰队因此没有受到太大的损失。<br>
也许其中另有隐情，妾身也在调查之中。<br>
但，倘若真是塞壬的报复行为，那吾等一定要小心。<br>
请一定要提高警惕。<br>
{namecode:182}敬上。<br>

<br>
那是一夜的噩梦——<br>
梦中，总有一个模糊的身影在注视着我。<br>
每当意识到它的存在，它就会消失于无形。<br>
而在意识放松之时，它又会出现在那里。<br>
不发出声音，也不会做出行动，宛如一尊雕塑，又如一个鬼影。<br>
周边传来的是……警报音，基地出现异常情况了么？！<br>
不对……此处仍为梦境，但是……那个身影不见了。<br>
嗯，没错……那个带来噩梦的身影在这里消失了。<br>
梦魇终于消散了么…………<br>
纵使身边警铃大作，我却依然感受到发自内心的放松。<br>
<span style="color:#ff9900;">Helena META：</span><br>
指挥官，现在放下心来还太早了。<br>
现在不是睡觉的时候，危险正在接近。<br>
快醒醒，指挥官，快醒来————<br>
<br>
唔………………<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Helena：</span><br>
指挥官……太好了，你终于醒了。<br>
刚刚怎么叫你都一直没有回应，我都打算去喊医务人员了……<br>
<br>
我好像做了一个漫长的噩梦……<br>
海伦娜，现在几点了？<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Helena：</span><br>
……时钟上显示的时间是16点16分。<br>
<br>
下午四点……？这不可能啊，再怎么说也不至于一觉睡到这个时间……<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Helena：</span><br>
嗯，确实不应该是这样的。从时间感上进行估算，现在应该是凌晨的三点到四点左右。<br>
但是不知道为什么，基地中的所有计时工具的数字都变成了16点16分，并停在了这一刻。<br>
而且领航员小姐发现，有一个来源不明的巨型物体正在向我们的方向接近。<br>
<br>
来源不明的巨型物体……在向我们的方向接进？我们现在可是在「星海」之中啊？<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Helena：</span><br>
……没错，星海现在已经处于红色警戒状态了。<br>
半小时之后星海就会彻底封闭并进入隐匿状态，届时将无法保证仍位于其中的人员安全。<br>
还好倒计时工具没有受到影响……指挥官，只剩下不到二十五分钟了，快跟我走吧。<br>
<br>
我明白了，其他人呢？<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Helena：</span><br>
外围部门已经撤离了，核心部门在完成必要的工作后也会撤离。<br>
<br>
TB呢？<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Helena：</span><br>
领航员小姐会留在这里————毕竟这里就是她的主机所在位置啊。<br>
好了指挥官，时间紧急，我们路上再聊吧————<br>
