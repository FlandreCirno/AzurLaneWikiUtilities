<br>
In the Sakura Empire's Sanctuary, an heir to great power stood amidst comfort and luxury.<br>
Standing in a pagoda that stretched towards the heavens, a black-haired woman rested her hand against the railing, casting her eyes across the sea of clouds below.<br>
The first rays of morning's light pushed through the clouds, leaving a slender shadow across the wooden floorboards.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">???：</span><br>
A storm is coming...<br>
<br>
Ominous clouds loomed on the horizon. In this still and silent world, there was no wind brushing against her cheek, no chirping of birds reaching her ears.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">???：</span><br>
The world within this barrier will not be affected... but I'm afraid the blossoms outside will be torn from their branches.<br>
<br>
Alas, this was no time for her to wallow in sentimentality. Just as she was about to turn around and head back inside, she heard the cries of a lone and lost bird.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">???：</span><br>
A swallow? It must be seeking shelter.<br>
<br>
She reached out to the swallow and the fragile creature came down and perched on her finger.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">???：</span><br>
If you've come here in search of shelter, I'm afraid you've made a mistake.<br>
As seasons change, storms take shape – sunshine can turn into rain in the blink of an eye. One won't last long, fleeing from place to place without a plan.<br>
The barrier surrounding this pagoda protects only the strong. It will keep me safe, but offers no relief to you.<br>
<br>
Her words carried no meaning to the swallow, and yet, it nodded as though it understood.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">???：</span><br>
"My time is now. O Heavens, hear my vow. When I rise, all shall bow."<br>
I applaud your poetry, Musashi. I must say though, the verses are a bit ominous.<br>
<br>
Musashi – battleship of the Yamato class now holding the seat of the Combined Fleet flagship – looked behind her.<br>
Though she should've been alone, a voice spoke to her from nearby.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Musashi：</span><br>
There's no meaning to them beyond the picture they paint. More importantly, have our guests arrived yet?<br>
<span style="color:#a020f0;">???：</span><br>
Yes. They're waiting outside the barrier, so I suggest we proceed to the next stage. *cough* *cough*...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Musashi：</span><br>
Of course.<br>
<br>
Silence returned to the pagoda's top floor. Musashi extended her arm and gently shook her finger, sending the swallow away.<br>
*knock knock*<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Sakawa：</span><br>
I've come to report. Akagi and her party have arrived outside the barrier. Wakatsuki is guiding them around.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Musashi：</span><br>
Alright. Head to the reception room. I'll be there soon.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Sakawa：</span><br>
As you say!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Musashi：</span><br>
......<br>
So you're the first to arrive, Akagi.<br>
The barrier will not protect the weak from the storm...<br>
So instead, I will protect you myself. Heehee.<br>
<br>
Three invitations were sent out across the Sakura Empire.<br>
One to Mikasa, who was in pursuit of truth with nothing more than fragmented legends in hand.<br>
One to Nagato, who was searching for signs of Sirens around the Sacred Sakura's seal.<br>
And one to Akagi, who had witnessed the Iron Blood's rebellion against the Sirens and returned home with the Watatsumi in hand.<br>
Penned by Musashi, the invitations beckoned to a fateful encounter in the Sanctuary.<br>
Each person was allowed to bring five others.<br>
All would converge here for a game with higher stakes than they could imagine.<br>

<br>
Sanctuary Pagoda - Reception Room<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Wakatsuki：</span><br>
Here it is, Lady Nagato and Lady Mikasa.<br>
<br>
Sliding the door aside, Mikasa and Nagato were surprised to see that Akagi and Musashi were already seated inside the room.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Mikasa：</span><br>
You arrived before us, Akagi? Here I thought you'd be the last to show up.<br>
You must've been raring to go, now that your business trip to Europa is finally over. Hahaha!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Akagi：</span><br>
While it's delightful to see you in good health, Great Veteran, we'll have to skip the pleasantries.<br>
This exercise is tremendously important, and we must not keep Musashi waiting.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Nagato：</span><br>
Forgive our late arrival, Musashi. I am to blame for it.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Musashi：</span><br>
It's of no consequence. Akagi and I were just enjoying a pleasant chat.<br>
You've all come ahead of time, so there is nothing to be ashamed about. Now, come join us.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Nagato：</span><br>
If you consider it fine, then I shall too...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Wakatsuki：</span><br>
Lady Nagato, Lady Mikasa, I've brought you tea.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Nagato：</span><br>
Why, I'll be... It smells lovely.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Mikasa：</span><br>
Aye, this aroma dispels my travel fatigue with one sniff. Who brewed this? Wakatsuki?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Musashi：</span><br>
Hanazuki made it. Although she did struggle to pick the right leaves to use, so I felt I had to give her a helping hand.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Mikasa：</span><br>
Did you? Then one could say this tea, much like our invitations, was made by your hand.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Musashi：</span><br>
Perhaps one could, perhaps one could not. We each chose our own leaves – once mixed, it's not so easy to determine whose are to thank for the aroma.<br>
If you like the tea, then it's Hanazuki you should compliment, not me.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Mikasa：</span><br>
You needn't be so humble. It's as you say, I can't easily determine whose leaves make it so fragrant. My sense of smell is not so discerning.<br>
<br>
As the four were enjoying their tea, a holographic Go board suddenly took form atop the table they'd gathered around.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">{namecode:91}：</span><br>
I see we're ready to begin the exercise.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">{namecode:82}：</span><br>
Is this one of those "hollow-grams?" I assume this is the way we will resolve the differences between our ideologies?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">{namecode:74}：</span><br>
It looks quite detailed. Musashi, does this board reflect what's happening inside the exercise area?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">{namecode:84}：</span><br>
Quite perceptive. I'm impressed you were able to tell at a glance.<br>
I'm sure you all saw the landscape reflected in this hologram on your way here.<br>
We will be holding our exercise in a special "domain" beneath this pagoda, and this board relays everything that happens within it.<br>
As we speak, Sakawa is briefing all the participants and guiding them to their respective starting areas.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">{namecode:82}：</span><br>
Interesting... I was wondering how exactly we would command our troops without being physically present.<br>
So, what is our goal here, and how do we achieve it?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">{namecode:84}：</span><br>
It's as I said in the invitation. You are to command your troops and earn as many points as possible. The side with the most points at the end is the winner.<br>
This exercise will reflect the quality of our leadership – and at times, our very thoughts.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">{namecode:82}：</span><br>
Our thoughts? How are we supposed to affect our troops with thoughts alone?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">{namecode:84}：</span><br>
Your conviction and your mental imagery, if strong enough, can change the nature of the domain, though there are some limitations to what can be done.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">{namecode:91}：</span><br>
Actions speak louder than words, right? So, this exercise will be a clash of our true feelings.<br>
I can already speculate the Reborn Combined Fleet will focus on protecting each other, while Mikasa here will prioritize making her battleships even stronger.<br>
Considering she brought so many battleships here, I can already surmise what she's thinking.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">{namecode:82}：</span><br>
I didn't consciously pick a majority of battleships. I simply gathered a group of people I trust, and this is what I ended up with.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">{namecode:74}：</span><br>
As nothing is hidden on the board, that means all our troops and their strength are evident from the start, yes?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">{namecode:84}：</span><br>
That's right. You can hide your intent, but you cannot hide your identity.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">{namecode:74}：</span><br>
I see... Though, I must question what the purpose of this is, Musashi. Are you assuming Mikasa and I will join forces?<br>
If we started working together, Akagi would be at a huge disadvantage from the beginning. That should be patently clear.<br>
But if it is balance you strive for, I can see you siding with her.<br>
On a related note, I see your composition is almost solely aircraft carriers, Akagi.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">{namecode:91}：</span><br>
Like Mikasa, I didn't think too deeply about it. Besides, both sides have aircraft carriers, so it's fair.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">{namecode:74}：</span><br>
Would you really call it that? You have four, whereas we only have one.<br>
We could've had another, had Zuikaku not been sent away...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Communicator：</span><br>
Beep–––<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">{namecode:84}：</span><br>
Hello, Sakawa. Is everything ready over there?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">{namecode:226}：</span><br>
Sure is! Everyone is in their starting positions and waiting for orders. Me included!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">{namecode:84}：</span><br>
Very well. Thank you.<br>
<br>
Musashi rested her hand on the board. Every player's troops and their accompanying mass-produced ships had a distinctive, glowing aura beneath them.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">{namecode:84}：</span><br>
Let me clarify a few rules once more. You may perform actions on this board to issue orders to your troops. Your orders will be relayed to them through the communicators there. Certain special commands will have greater effects on the board, but have more restrictions to their use.<br>
You may also give them your orders verbally if you'd like. However, they cannot communicate back. The only information you can gain from them is what's shown on the board.<br>
If you wish to see how your troops are faring, there is only one way – earnestly wishing to join them.<br>
By the way, if you'd like to reposition your troops before the match truly starts, now is your last chance.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">{namecode:74}：</span><br>
And special commands, I presume, can only be issued once a turn when your turn comes?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">{namecode:84}：</span><br>
Correct. The purpose of this restriction is to make the match easier to follow. Otherwise, chaos would ensue.<br>
I should also mention that all our orders, unless spoken aloud, are secret until they're displayed on the board.<br>
It's your choice whether you wish to declare them for the other players to hear. When or if you do so is up to your discretion.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">{namecode:74}：</span><br>
I see... I'm left with a few questions now.<br>
Firstly, you said something about earning points to win earlier. Do we get these points by securing bases?<br>
Secondly, if you move to a spot already occupied by another player's troops... what happens then?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">{namecode:82}：</span><br>
To my knowledge... Yes, the more bases you hold, the more points you get. As for your second question...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">{namecode:91}：</span><br>
Nothing in particular happens. But if you insist on getting in someone's way, expect a fight. Similarly, eliminating your foes to prevent them from capturing your bases is a valid strategy.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">{namecode:84}：</span><br>
Correct. Speaking of the bases, they start out occupied by enemies hostile to all of us. You must eliminate them before you can capture a base.<br>
If you're worried about your troops getting hurt as a result of this exercise, don't be. All damage is merely simulated.<br>
Incapacitated troops can choose to stay on the board, but will not be able to partake in combat.<br>
Furthermore, you will not be able to send her orders, and she will lose all effects granted to her by the domain.<br>
For all intents and purposes, they can no longer participate in the game. Preferably, they'll simply exit the board area.<br>
To reiterate, don't fear for the well-being of your troops. Simply focus on winning this game.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">{namecode:74}：</span><br>
Very well. If that's the truth, then Mikasa and I will hold nothing back.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">{namecode:91}：</span><br>
Likewise. Now that everyone is on the same page, shall we finally start?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">{namecode:84}：</span><br>
I've said all I wanted to, so without further ado... let the game begin.<br>
The first move is yours, Akagi.<br>

<br>
Exercise Area - Turn 1 (Akagi's Action)<br>
In the distance, black clouds churned unpredictably around imposing mechanical castles, a strange and unsettling scenery worthy of a Siren test site.<br>
Even more bizarrely, beams of various colors of light literally "cut" the exercise area up into distinct grid-like sectors.<br>
Each different sector had a point value that would ultimately determine victory or defeat in this exercise.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ryuuhou：</span><br>
What is this place...? I've never seen anything like it in any of the Mirror Seas I've encountered...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Kaga：</span><br>
If I remember correctly, this was a "gift" that Akagi gave to Musashi. But how did she manage to turn it into something like this...?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ryuuhou：</span><br>
Wait, look over there... Is that the Diadem of Light? It looks completely different, but I'd never mix up that distinctive silhouette!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Yamashiro：</span><br>
Wow, you're right! This place seems to have been built by drawing on the motifs from some of the Sakura Empire's most sacred sites!<br>
Look, that place looks like our shrine... and there's also Akagi's estate over there!<br>
And is that the Sacred Sakura? ––Oh wow, even the Dragon Palace we found not too long ago is here!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ryuuhou：</span><br>
The great sakura tree of the Guardian Fox... I've never been there myself, but I heard Lady Nagato was once sealed within that place.<br>
That's before Zuikaku and the Reborn Combined Fleet reawakened her, anyway.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Yamashiro：</span><br>
Yeah! I heard all about it!<br>
Hmm... Now that I think about it, I've been feeling a little strange ever since coming here. I think my combat performance might be getting tweaked or something?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Miyuki：</span><br>
Mmhmm... I think we were assigned the role of "subordinates," so our specs might have been adjusted for fairness...<br>
Otherwise, capital ships would have an overwhelming advantage, and carriers would be able to wreak havoc from afar...<br>
That's why I think... Our equipment and specifications aren't actually reflective of our actual performance, but are special conditions imposed in this exercise.<br>
B-but, because of that, maybe I can finally be useful for a change...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Yamashiro：</span><br>
I see! So that's why I can equip planes now! Heh heh, I never get to do this stuff normally so I'll have to make every moment count~<br>
Thanks for the explanation, Miyuki!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Miyuki：</span><br>
D-don't mention it, as long as I can be of use to someone...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Yamashiro：</span><br>
You're doing great! I'm not sure how much of a difference I'll be able to make either, but let's both do our best, okay?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Jintsuu：</span><br>
Each and every one of us has her own role to play. In this exercise, we will not be testing each others' might, but rather making our thoughts known to each other in a clash of wits.<br>
As such, we are not only responsible for how we fight, but also if and when we fight.<br>
If we are to clash, our motivations and rationale may prove to be more important than the equipment we field and the tactics we employ in combat.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Yamashiro：</span><br>
Motivations, huh? Alright! So basically, if we just try our best and think about what kind of orders we'd be given, then everything should be fine, right?<br>
I've always wanted to feel what it's like to have a more active role on the battlefield, so I'm really excited to test these planes out!<br>
Oh, but, since we're supposed to use our heads and not our weapons, I'll try my best not to land us into a sticky situation!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Jintsuu：</span><br>
It's good to keep that in mind, but being overly cautious can be disadvantageous as well.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Yamashiro：</span><br>
Eh?! How do I know what to do then...?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Jintsuu：</span><br>
Uhh, I wouldn't worry about it too much. Just trust your gut instinct.<br>
<br>
Suddenly, a symbol appeared in the sky bearing the image of a lightning bolt.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Yamashiro：</span><br>
Woah, what in the world is that?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Miyuki：</span><br>
That... must be Akagi's special command. In other words, she's empowering us to carry out her orders...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Kaga：</span><br>
Correct. "Make haste and capture the nearest sector." We're moving out, everyone.<br>
{{折叠面板|内容结束}}

<br>
Exercise Area - Turn 1 (Mikasa's Action)<br>
As soon as Akagi's sigil faded from the sky above the exercise area, her subordinates quickly sprung to action.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Haguro：</span><br>
Woah, look at that huge symbol... Akagi's trying to get an advantage right from the get-go...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Hatakaze：</span><br>
That's the way Akagi's always liked to do things, like a crimson storm sweeping through the battlefield.<br>
But, seizing the initiative is a sensible strategy. Since all of the fleets start far away from each other, expanding your territory first provides benefits later on down the road.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Haguro：</span><br>
Yes, but you'll still have to defeat mass-produced ships before you can occupy another sector.<br>
Umm, let's see... The central tower is worth ten points, the four major sacred sites are worth five points each, and the other bases are only worth one point each.<br>
That means that Akagi, Nagato, Musashi, and Mikasa will be fighting over a total of fifty possible points.<br>
You're right, it does make sense to expand first. Whoever can get near the center first has first pick of the higher-value bases.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Kinu：</span><br>
Calm down. Mikasa likes taking things in a slow and controlled manner, so she surely has something in mind.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Kongou：</span><br>
She's also more cautious than Akagi by nature. I wouldn't be surprised if she doesn't issue a special command this turn at all.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Kinu：</span><br>
Why's that? Are we not going to compete for the central tower?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Kongou：</span><br>
Not yet. It's not our turn anyway, so all we can do is keep an eye out for our opponents' strategy and plan our moves accordingly.<br>
Knowing the way Mikasa does things, we'll probably find our opportunity to strike later on in this match.<br>
After all, Mikasa might only fire one shot in the time someone else fires a hundred, but she'll make that one shot count.<br>
Until then, our key priority should be to support Nagato, maintain the board state, and prevent anyone else from running away with a huge lead.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Hatakaze：</span><br>
I see... We'll be opting for a control-type strategy then and wait for the rush strategy to run out of steam.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Kirishima：</span><br>
It's also important to note that Akagi's fleet does not seem to be prioritizing the central tower.<br>
By the looks of things, she's clearing out the sector closer to Musashi's side, as if she's trying to make it easier for the two of them to work together.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Hatakaze：</span><br>
That makes sense. Akagi might be trying to cooperate with Musashi the same way Mikasa is allying with Nagato.<br>
Interesting, we'll have a two-versus-two on our hands... How will Mikasa react to this situation?<br>
<br>
The beams of light around the exercise area began to change, signifying the beginning of Mikasa's turn.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Kinu：</span><br>
...Looks like it's our move now.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Kirishima：</span><br>
Right. Akagi's subordinates won't be able to move from their current location until the start of their next turn.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Haguro：</span><br>
And, you're right, I didn't see Mikasa's sigil light up in the sky, so she must not be opting to use a special command this turn.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Kongou：</span><br>
We'll be following the same plan as before then. For now, we'll capture sector AB56 and move forward towards Akagi's territory.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Haguro：</span><br>
Why are we moving towards Akagi? Weren't we going to support Nagato like you said earlier?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Hatakaze：</span><br>
I suppose this is a case of the best defense being a good offense? Putting pressure on Akagi is the best way of making her think twice about her next move.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Kongou：</span><br>
I don't think Musashi is going to threaten Nagato right away, so this also prevents us from getting flanked by Akagi's forces later.<br>
Akagi will now have to weigh her offensive options with defending her territory. A classic Mikasa strategy, if I must say so myself.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Haguro：</span><br>
It's a classic sword-and-shield strategy! I'd expect nothing less from the Great Veteran herself!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Kongou：</span><br>
Let's make sure we're all clear on the instructions before we set out.<br>
{{折叠面板|内容结束}}

<br>
Exercise Area - Turn 1 (Nagato's Action)<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Hiei：</span><br>
So, Akagi, Mikasa, Nagato, and then Musashi each take their turns in that order... I wonder if there's any special reasoning behind that.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Haruna：</span><br>
You're probably just overcomplicating things again. I bet that's just the order they're sitting around the table.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Hiei：</span><br>
Can you be sure that the order they arrived at the table was not predetermined as well?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Haruna：</span><br>
Do you think... Musashi has some other plan in mind?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Hiei：</span><br>
That I cannot say. I do tend to overthink things after all, just as you said.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Haruna：</span><br>
I sure hope so... By the way, Nagato seems to be mirroring Mikasa's move and attacking Musashi from the side.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Nagato：</span><br>
Not quite. Listen well to my command:<br>
Haruna and Harutsuki will move towards Musashi's territory and halt her forces from advancing.<br>
We will move our mass-produced ships to surround the Sacred Sakura.<br>
Hiei, Kawakaze, and Shoukaku are to make preparations to capture the adjacent base on our next action.<br>
After that, we will consolidate our forces to launch a frontal assault on our enemy's defenses.<br>
To that end, I shall see to it that we sustain no losses this turn.<br>
<br>
As soon as Nagato's communication ended, a shield symbol appeared in the sky, and barriers of light materialized around Nagato's forces.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Kawakaze：</span><br>
Lady Nagato's blessings are with us!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Shoukaku：</span><br>
As long as this barrier holds, we'll easily be able to take the adjacent base without sustaining any damage.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Haruna：</span><br>
Despite being defense-oriented, Nagato doesn't believe in the wait-and-see approach.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Hiei：</span><br>
A proactive strategy that seeks to neutralize threats while ensuring everyone's safety...<br>
That must be the vision Lady Nagato has for the future. How very much like her, heehee.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Harutsuki：</span><br>
That's right. Plus, Lady Nagato issued the orders to us herself, unlike Akagi and Mikasa.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Hiei：</span><br>
It's as if she is personally joining us on the battlefield... What a charismatic leader she has become.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Kawakaze：</span><br>
The Guardian Fox has spoken her will! Do not hesitate, and carry out your instructions!<br>
<br>
Exercise Area - Turn 1 (Nagato's Action)<br>
On the game board, a diamond-shaped "base" sits between the intersection of four squares.<br>
A Siren vessel defends each base, and the surrounding sectors must be controlled first before the base can be captured.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Kawakaze：</span><br>
Just another Conductor vessel, huh? I've faced plenty of these in the Mirror Seas.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Haruna：</span><br>
Great, a humanoid Siren. I was starting to get tired of smashing these mass-produced ships.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Shoukaku：</span><br>
Don't get too cocky. We might be able to wipe these Sirens out with ease normally, but remember - our rigging isn't as powerful as usual. We also don't know if those Sirens have been enhanced in any way.<br>
What I'm curious about is how we managed to get our hands on so many Siren vessels...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Haruna：</span><br>
Well, they don't seem to have the hostile aura most Sirens give off. Does that mean we figured out a way to control them?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Shoukaku：</span><br>
"Miracles exist beyond the boundary of reality."<br>
Musashi said something along those lines, but she tends to wax philosophical. Knowing Akagi's involvement in this exercise, it wouldn't surprise me if we're actually inside a Siren research facility.<br>
While I have no objections to using a Mirror Sea for training purposes...<br>
We should be wary of any real Sirens sneaking in and making a mess of things, like they did with that Iron Blood experiment.<br>
*sigh*... I really hope Akagi isn't getting us into some terrible mess.<br>
Zuikaku's awfully protective of Lady Nagato, and if something were to happen to her under my watch, I would never hear the end of it.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Hiei：</span><br>
I doubt there's anything substantial you have to worry about. I heard this exercise area reflects the mental state of its participants.<br>
This is a good opportunity to learn about what Akagi's after, so all we need to do is to remain vigilant.<br>

Exercise Area - Turn 1 (Musashi's Action)<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Chiyoda：</span><br>
So, we've got our orders from Musashi. Doesn't look like she'll be using a special command this turn either, yeah?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Suzutsuki ：</span><br>
Waiting for our opportunity to strike is a pretty sensible decision, isn't it?<br>
Wakatsuki, do you wanna lead the advance on the nearest base?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Wakatsuki：</span><br>
You've got it! Just leave it to me!<br>
<br>
After receiving her order, Wakatsuki stepped forward from the formation of mass-produced ships, leading them towards the base on the adjacent diamond.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Sakawa：</span><br>
Musashi has chosen a very different strategy from the other three players...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Suzutsuki ：</span><br>
Huh? How can you tell from just the opening move?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Sakawa：</span><br>
Well, I obviously don't know what her endgame is, but she seems to want to capture the Dragon Palace as quickly as possible. Nobody else is positioning themselves to do that yet, right?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Suzutsuki ：</span><br>
I see. Once you capture a base, it can't be taken over by somebody else, so it makes sense to target the highest-value areas first!<br>
The smaller bases are only worth one point each, but capturing a sacred site is worth five whole points! That'll be a huge lead!<br>
It's still too early for there to be any clashes between the fleets, but once that happens, it'll be harder to plan ahead.<br>
If we can capture as many points as possible before that happens, we'll have a lot more options to choose from even if the situation gets pretty chaotic!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Sakawa：</span><br>
Right. And if we exhaust all our strength from fighting each other, it'll be harder to take down the Sirens guarding each base.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Suzutsuki ：</span><br>
Well said! As long as things go smoothly, we'll also reach the central tower before anybody else! Lady Musashi's wisdom is not to be underestimated!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Sakawa：</span><br>
S-see, I already knew all of that! That's why Musashi has chosen a strategy the others haven't grasped!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Suzutsuki ：</span><br>
So, now that everyone has taken their first turn, who do you think is winning?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Sakawa：</span><br>
I dunno, this is the first time any of us are playing a game like this, no?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Suzutsuki ：</span><br>
It just occurred to me, our victory's practically guaranteed once we take the central tower, right? What's stopping everyone from just rushing straight there?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Sakawa：</span><br>
Well, none of us would be able to get 15 points without butting heads.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Suzutsuki ：</span><br>
Yeah. We need to be especially wary of Akagi as well. Chitose, Chiyoda, what do you two think? Akagi wouldn't just hand Musashi victory on a silver platter, would she?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Chitose：</span><br>
I, I have no idea... Akagi can be kind-hearted at times and terrifying at others, as if she has two sides to her...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Chiyoda：</span><br>
Haha, there's no way shmucks like us could ever figure out what Akagi is thinking~<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Sakawa：</span><br>
That's true, but don't you think Musashi gives off pretty similar vibes?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Suzutsuki ：</span><br>
I can see that... Hey, do you remember what Musashi told us right before this exercise began?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Musashi：</span><br>
Sakawa, Wakatsuki, Suzutsuki, Chitose, and Chiyoda. I trust the five of you to act as my retainers for this exercise.<br>
All you need to do is to follow my orders, like pieces on a Go board.<br>
Simply keep your eyes in front of you. Relinquish your thoughts, and enjoy the experience about to unfold - no matter what happens.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Sakawa：</span><br>
"Enjoy the experience about to unfold," huh? The way she put it makes it seem like we're watching a movie or something.<br>
I've participated in a lot of drills and exercises before, but this is like a completely different game with a whole other set of rules...<br>
It's like we stepped into an entirely new world when we entered Musashi's domain.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Chiyoda：</span><br>
Y'know what rubbed me the wrong way? How Musashi said "no matter what happens." It's almost as if she's foreshadowing that something IS going to happen.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Sakawa：</span><br>
Hmm, that does sound a little questionable. But what's the worst that could happen? It's not like any of us could actually get hurt inside this exercise area.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Chiyoda：</span><br>
Yeah, but we're not actually playing Go here. We actually have to fight, and getting hit by blanks still hurts!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Sakawa：</span><br>
Meh. It wouldn't be a naval exercise without some stakes.<br>
The one thing I can say for certain is, if anything is actually happening behind the scenes, that's for the players to decide. We're just the pieces on the board, so there's nothing we can do anyway.<br>
Now that I think about it, when's the last time we've seen Nagato, Mikasa, Akagi, and Musashi in one room? Quite literally the stars aligning, right?<br>
We've even got replicas of some of the Sakura Empire's most sacred sites here, and the design of the surrounding sectors seem to reflect the architecture of the nearest sacred site.<br>
There really is a lot of great scenery to soak in, if not for the dark and ominous clouds and whatnot. Who knows, maybe Musashi is really impressed with the way this place turned out and actually is just telling us to enjoy ourselves?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Suzutsuki ：</span><br>
No matter what happens, huh... There must be some surprise at the end!<br>
(I'm not sure if I'm overthinking this, but... when she says for us to "enjoy the experience," does that mean it doesn't matter if we win or lose? What does Musashi even stand to gain from all this?)<br>
(I was told that this place reflects the mental state of the participants... Does that mean we'll be able to find clues as to what Musashi is thinking...?)<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Wakatsuki：</span><br>
Um, hello? Excuse me? I've arrived at the designated location!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Suzutsuki ：</span><br>
Oh, Wakatsuki! Do you have visuals on the base's defender?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Wakatsuki：</span><br>
Y-yes, I can see the target clearly! Umm, it appears to be a Tester vessel!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Sakawa：</span><br>
A Tester model? Those aren't usually known for their combat capabilities, but I wonder what specs this one has... Let's go find out!<br>
It's been fun chatting and all, but we've got a job to do here~!<br>

<br>
Sanctuary Pagoda - Reception Room<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">{namecode:82}：</span><br>
So you decided to forego the smaller bases closer to you to go directly for the Dragon Palace. Mmhmm, a bold move.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">{namecode:84}：</span><br>
One cannot rest at ease until she completely controls the flow of battle. Don't you also know this to be true, Great Veteran?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">{namecode:82}：</span><br>
Who knows? You may find that flow to be too mighty and tumultuous to grasp. Can your fleet of five take down a high-ranking vessel?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">{namecode:84}：</span><br>
That... is when you shall witness the strength of my resolve. That node will fall to me as early as my next turn.<br>
Besides, Nagato was kind enough to leave plenty of breathing room for me. I would be foolish not to capitalize on that.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">{namecode:74}：</span><br>
If you are not posturing to attack me, then there is no reason for me to make the first move.<br>
If anything, I would prefer to strike down these augmented mass-produced Sirens first.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">{namecode:84}：</span><br>
That would be advantageous to me as well. Though mass-produced ships they may be, Siren technology is never to be underestimated, especially under these conditions.<br>
The mass-produced ships we face are stronger than what we encountered at the Diadem of Light.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">{namecode:74}：</span><br>
The way Siren technology progresses is, admittedly, beyond my understanding.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">{namecode:84}：</span><br>
Then shall we meet up some time? I would be glad to show you how to dismantle these vessels firsthand.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">{namecode:74}：</span><br>
Very well, if that is convenient for you.<br>
Hmm... I must say, your retainers seem to be struggling, Musashi.<br>
You said that you expect to capture the Dragon Palace on your next turn, but the results of your gambit seem less than satisfactory.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">{namecode:84}：</span><br>
That is a possibility I foresaw. It appears luck was not on my side this time.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">{namecode:82}：</span><br>
I guess that means your forces are now stuck on that space the next turn. You tried to bite off more than you could chew, and it ended up backfiring. Hahaha!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">{namecode:84}：</span><br>
Heh. It was an unfortunate miscalculation, as you said. It would be a pity if you decide to attack me while I am vulnerable.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">{namecode:82}：</span><br>
What are you saying? Only Nagato and Akagi even have the option to attack you. I'm on the other side of the board.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">{namecode:91}：</span><br>
What reason would I have to harm poor Musashi here? Oh, Nagato, would you mind handing the communicator back?<br>
It's not like you actually need it, right? Your retainers will receive your orders as long as you will it.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">{namecode:74}：</span><br>
I am aware. I just do not like this cold, impersonal way of doing things.<br>
Our friends are not mere pawns on a chessboard. They are living, breathing people, just like us.<br>
Is it against the rules for me to directly issue my orders when I am at a disadvantage for disclosing them to the rest of you?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">{namecode:91}：</span><br>
Of course not. After all, the fact that you've chosen to "disclose" your plans may well be part of your larger strategy.<br>
I will say though, Nagato, being tied up with trivial things like decorum... may end up clouding your judgment during critical moments.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">{namecode:74}：</span><br>
...Like whether to take aim at my own friends?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">{namecode:91}：</span><br>
If you truly seek to lead the Sakura Empire to a brighter future... then you may find yourself confronted with that choice, whether you want to or not.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">{namecode:74}：</span><br>
...We shall see.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">{namecode:84}：</span><br>
Then, that concludes my turn. It's back to you, Akagi.<br>

Exercise Area, Dragon Palace Base - Turn 2 (Musashi's Action)<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Wakatsuki：</span><br>
I, I'm coming through! W-Wakatsuki-style secret technique – Twin-Blade Tornado!<br>
<br>
KABOOM––––!!<br>
Wakatsuki swung her single katana with as much resolve as it took to name her secret technique.<br>
Her body blurred into a flash of blue light, a flurry of blows raining down onto the Tester vessel as if she indeed was wielding two blades.<br>
The Siren vessel staggered back, as if struck senseless both by the ferocity of the attack and how unexpected it was.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Sakawa：</span><br>
Wh-what the heck was THAT, Wakatsuki?!<br>
You've been hiding that from us this whole time?! We'll never have to worry about the Sirens again if you can pull that off every day!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Wakatsuki：</span><br>
Um... I have no idea how that happened either... I just knew I had to defeat that enemy, and was thinking about a show I watched the other day...<br>
Is this what Musashi meant by this place being able to "reflect your mental state?"<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Chitose：</span><br>
So, um... You thought about defeating the enemy using a special killer move...? C-could you teach me how to do that as well...?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Wakatsuki：</span><br>
Umm... Well, I had an idea of what I wanted to do in my head...<br>
So then I swung my katana, and before I knew it, I was unleashing blow after blow into the enemy...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Chitose：</span><br>
Wow... I wish I could come up with a special move for myself as well...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Chiyoda：</span><br>
There's no need to worry about that, sis!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Sakawa：</span><br>
Hmm? Did you come up with something good?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Chiyoda：</span><br>
This might seem a bit obvious, but we've always had great teamwork together, right? Next time, let's try launching a combo attack together and see what happens!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Chitose：</span><br>
That last attack felt a lot better than usual... We didn't even land all our attacks, but there's already a noticeable difference...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Chiyoda：</span><br>
Sakawa, you should come up with a special move as well! We might never get another chance to do something this cool ever again!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Sakawa：</span><br>
That's true... In that case, allow me to demonstrate my "Demon-Banishing Slash," a dazzling display of swordsmanship that does not pale at all before Wakatsuki's technique.<br>
Wait, hold on a sec... I shouldn't waste my ace-in-the-hole technique right here and now.<br>
By the way, how do we even activate our special abilities anyway? Do we have to call out their names or something?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Wakatsuki：</span><br>
I'd assume not, but shouting the name should form a clearer image of the ability in your mind.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Sakawa：</span><br>
Makes sense. Chiyoda and Chitose didn't have to shout anything out.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Chiyoda：</span><br>
Hey, it's not like we were trying to come up with a special technique anyway? Chitose and I are in sync, so we already have the mental imagery of how we want to fight with each other.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Sakawa：</span><br>
Thanks for the tip. I'll keep that in mind!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Suzutsuki ：</span><br>
Wait, Tester still hasn't been defeated, right? We got too caught up in the moment!<br>
<br>
When everyone turned around, Wakatsuki, who had just landed a devastating blow on the Tester vessel, was nowhere to be found. Instead––<br>
Her position in the vanguard of the fleet had been replaced by Suzutsuki, a ring of light beneath her feet symbolizing the usage of a special command.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Suzutsuki ：</span><br>
Woah, woah, how'd I get here all of a sudden?<br>
I was wondering where Wakatsuki went off to, but turns out we swapped positions!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Sakawa：</span><br>
Maybe Musashi was afraid of Wakatsuki getting too badly damaged and swapped her with Suzutsuki.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Suzutsuki ：</span><br>
That's fine by me. I was just looking for an opportunity to test out my special technique too! Suzutsuki, causing confusion! Unparalleled Blade-Dance!<br>
I love having aerial targets to aim at as well. Luckily, this Siren has a bunch of floating cannons, so I'm really able to show off my keen aim! Too bad there's only one enemy though...<br>
Well, as long as I get to do what I'm best at, I'm one happy camper!<br>
Now that I'm here, you have the strength of a hundred ships on your side! I'll be taking your mark, Wakatsuki!<br>

{{折叠面板|标题=Sea Fog|选项=9|主框=1|样式=primary|展开=是}}
<br>
Exercise Area - Turn 3 (Akagi's Action)<br>
At the start of Akagi's turn, a cloud symbol appeared above the exercise area, blanketing the entire domain in a thick sea fog.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Yamashiro：</span><br>
Wh-wh-where'd all this fog come from all of a sudden?!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Jintsuu：</span><br>
This symbol must be a manifestation of Akagi's will.<br>
As far as I can tell, the sea fog is spreading through the entire exercise area... Akagi has already used two special commands, so we've got to make the most out of this powerful effect.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Yamashiro：</span><br>
Um, are you sure we're going to be fine? Don't the Sirens usually deploy sea fog like this before launching an attack?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Jintsuu：</span><br>
Yes, which is why we should check on our communication equipment. Siren sea fog almost always has a jamming effect.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Kaga：</span><br>
All my communication equipment, sensors, and electronics are operating normally. This seems to be nothing more than ordinary fog.<br>
Well, it's too early to make that conclusion. If this is a manifestation of Akagi's will, she must be trying to secure a significant advantage for us.<br>
I know Akagi better than anyone else. She is trying to create a situation ideal for our carriers, something that the other players cannot take advantage of.<br>
The fog is thin, sitting just above the water's surface. It does not interfere with our ability to operate carrier-based aircraft, and our planes will be free from the fog's effects as soon as we launch them.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ryuuhou：</span><br>
But the fog is still dense enough to prevent the others from reading our movements.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Kaga：</span><br>
Indeed. We will now be able to secretly capture surrounding bases without committing as many resources to each one.<br>
With the exception of the central tower and the strongholds, individual nodes only have low-ranking humanoid enemies and can be easily defeated by any of us alone.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Miyuki：</span><br>
Th-then, I'll go towards Mikasa's forces to try to capture the base between her and Lady Nagato...<br>
I, I'd rather not go alone, but if Akagi wants us to divide and conquer, then...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Kaga：</span><br>
You'll be fine, Miyuki. I'll cover you from a distance if necessary.<br>
Under this arrangement, our forces will be spread thin and we won't always be able to help each other out. But, Akagi always has THAT option.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ryuuhou：</span><br>
What do you mean?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Kaga：</span><br>
During this exercise, the players have the advantage of not only being able to survey the entire battlefield, but can also observe their opponents to try to gain a mental edge over them.<br>
However, they may also choose to give up those advantages and directly enter the battlefield to assist their forces.<br>
That's right. If Akagi wishes to take matters into her own hands, she too will descend upon this battle.<br>

<br>
Exercise Area - Turn 3 (Mikasa's Action)<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Kinu：</span><br>
Look at that fog... Assuming this isn't the Sirens' doing, Akagi must be up to something major.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Haguro：</span><br>
I agree with that assessment. Before the fog fully set in, my recon planes saw signs of Akagi's ships moving.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Hatakaze：</span><br>
She probably thinks she's so clever using a smokescreen to conceal her moves, but we're onto her!<br>
If we huddle here all scared and let Akagi do whatever she wants, she could potentially take five points' worth of bases this turn.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Kinu：</span><br>
So she can pick and choose her targets freely, regardless of where her ships are deployed... So this is how she's leveraging her fleet of carriers?!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Kirishima：</span><br>
That's not all. By spreading her forces out, she's gained control of the middle area first, effectively gating who is allowed to move into Musashi's territory.<br>
If we still want to meet up with Nagato's forces, we'll either have to brute-force our way through the center of the battlefield or find another way around.<br>
But look - Musashi won't even be able to move at all without running into either Akagi's or Nagato's forces. I thought they were supposed to be working together?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Hatakaze：</span><br>
It's as if Akagi is trying to contain Musashi as well... Is this also a part of her strategy?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Haguro：</span><br>
Nagato is still maintaining her defensive line on the other side of Musashi's territory.<br>
Since we're allied with Nagato, she has a lot of options available to her.<br>
But now that Akagi is threatening large swaths of the battlefield with her sea fog, she might decide to respond to that first.<br>
Ugh, trying to read the situation is giving me a headache... I was told that all I had to do was follow the orders.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Kirishima：</span><br>
We ARE the ones actually doing the fighting, after all. It's inevitable that we'll have to make our own assessments.<br>
If we truly were to just follow orders without thinking, we'd be nothing more than Pawns. And at that point, why not use actual Pawns?<br>
To be honest, the biggest question mark right now is Musashi.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Kinu：</span><br>
That's right. She hasn't tipped her hand at all despite being threatened the most.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Hatakaze：</span><br>
I think she benefits when the situation gets harder to read. The more complex the battlefield, the more uncertainties there are. Maybe that's exactly what Musashi is after.<br>
Precisely because everyone is able to see everyone else's moves on this board, every move breeds suspicion.<br>
<br>
At that time, a symbol appeared above the sacred site nearest to Mikasa's territory, ordering her nearby forces to focus their attacks on it.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Kongou：</span><br>
Listen up, everyone, we have an order from Mikasa!<br>
<br>
Mikasa's instructions were clear - all forces are to converge on the Diadem of Light and capture it.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Haguro：</span><br>
All right, we're going for some big points! Looks like Mikasa is finally getting her head in the game!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Kinu：</span><br>
That's what I like to see! With Mikasa at the helm, we can't lose!<br>
Now then, we'll prepare to attack the Diadem of Light, and split Akagi's forces down the middle while we're at it.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Kongou：</span><br>
Excellent. I wonder if we're going to also make an attempt to capture the central tower after we seal off Akagi's ability to mount a counterattack.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Haguro：</span><br>
If we're also going for the central tower, that means we'll directly engage with Akagi's fleet...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Hatakaze：</span><br>
We don't know for sure if that's actually what Akagi is going for, but this move at least matches her aggression.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Haguro：</span><br>
Turning Akagi's strategy against her, huh? You've still got it in you, old timer!<br>

Exercise Area - Turn 3 (Nagato's Action)<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Kawakaze：</span><br>
...This sea fog throws a wrench in our plans.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Shoukaku：</span><br>
Crafting an environment that only benefits carriers such as herself... I'd expect nothing else from that crafty woman.<br>
Oh, I almost forgot, I'm also a carrier, so it won't affect me negatively. Now if only Zuikaku were here, *sigh*...<br>
By the way, Musashi was the one who ordered Zuikaku to pay a visit to Iron Blood before this exercise, right?<br>
*gasp*... Do you think she purposefully did that to split us up?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Haruna：</span><br>
I think you're overthinking things... This is just a naval exercise, isn't it? Why would Musashi arrange a whole diplomatic move over an elaborate game of Go?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Shoukaku：</span><br>
Musashi never struck me as that kind of person, but when Akagi is involved, you never know!<br>
It wouldn't surprise me if some of that vixen's craftiness rubbed off on Musashi... Though, I suppose I shouldn't be throwing baseless accusations around...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Hiei：</span><br>
Right, it's hard enough to focus on what's going on in front of us. We can't see Musashi's fleet through all the fog...<br>
If Musashi takes advantage of the fog to slip her forces closer to us...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Nagato：</span><br>
Listen well, everyone. I shall now tell you our countermeasures for Akagi's sea fog.<br>
Haruna will patrol the territory adjacent to Musashi's forces after capturing the base there.<br>
Hiei, Kawakaze, and Harutsuki will retreat to provide backup for Shoukaku while fending off Musashi's fleet.<br>
We must prevent Musashi from taking the Sacred Sakura under the cover of fog.<br>
Shoukaku will solidify her position using our mass-produced ships.<br>
I already know what Akagi seeks to do, but if I were to disclose it, she would change her actions accordingly.<br>
Remain vigilant, but carry out the instructions I just gave you. Take control of the surrounding bases.<br>
<br>
When Nagato's voice disappeared, new symbols appeared around Shoukaku.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Harutsuki：</span><br>
Wow... This must be the protection of the gods... I mean, of the Guardian Fox!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Haruna：</span><br>
Since Shoukaku is the core of Nagato's strategy this turn, she's being funneled all our power and resources!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Shoukaku：</span><br>
(I feel a tremendous amount of power welling up within me... What exactly IS this exercise area?)<br>
(Does nobody else feel something strange about this? How are we supposed to get any practical training done when you can "will" incredible power into existence here?)<br>
(Well, I'll worry about it later. Maybe the Commander knows a thing or two about what's going on~)<br>

<span style="color:#4eb24e;">{namecode:74}：</span><br>
You'll grant me another point for taking control of this base, yes?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">{namecode:84}：</span><br>
Even with the interference of the sea fog, you still took advantage of the situation to solidify your defenses while capturing nearby bases. Impressive work.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">{namecode:74}：</span><br>
Only carriers are able to operate effectively under these conditions. I had to maneuver accordingly.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">{namecode:84}：</span><br>
You protected your friends and expanded your influence. Your spirit is commendable.<br>
But your mistake was not capturing all the bases adjacent to my territory. If you wanted to prevent me from reaching the Sacred Sakura, you should have ensured there are no gaps in your visibility.<br>
Under the fog, slipping past a few patrol ships is a trifling matter.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">{namecode:74}：</span><br>
Are your forces not preoccupied with the defenders at the Dragon Palace?<br>
Do you plan to abandon that course of action and make a straight march towards my territory?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">{namecode:84}：</span><br>
Good observation. My fleet will be tied down until the Dragon Palace is taken.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">{namecode:82}：</span><br>
Unless you never planned on taking it in the first place, right?<br>
You were planning to give those nodes to Akagi, but she's not taking you up on your offer.<br>
Speaking of Akagi, I can't understand why she would take the bases closest to your territory first. Aren't the two of you supposed to be working together?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">{namecode:91}：</span><br>
I don't recall ever agreeing to an alliance with Musashi, Mikasa.<br>
The only thing that matters in this game is victory - friends and foes simply change the dynamics of how to achieve that victory.<br>
I can tell that you're maneuvering to try to contain me, but there's no point for me to entertain you.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">{namecode:82}：</span><br>
That's one way to look at it. We could've worked through our differences in another manner, but you chose to deploy this sea fog in order to obfuscate your moves from me.<br>
Does that not prove you do not trust me?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">{namecode:91}：</span><br>
Who knows? I'm sure you of all people already know what I'm trying to accomplish, whether or not you can see my actions.<br>
I will say this once more - I will achieve victory using the means I deem appropriate.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">{namecode:84}：</span><br>
As you can see, Mikasa, Akagi has the resolve to carry the Sakura Empire through rain and storm.<br>
She cares not if she is set back or humiliated, and continues to push forward regardless. That is a spirit worth looking up to.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">{namecode:74}：</span><br>
What is the real reason you're doing this, Musashi?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">{namecode:84}：</span><br>
While victory depends on who captures holds the most points at the end, there is no rule saying that you cannot have your retainers fight directly.<br>
When shipgirls clash with the full extent of their mental fortitude and will-given form, what we actually witness is a contest of courage and determination.<br>
Just as Nagato's desire to protect Shoukaku made her stronger, my fleet has developed their powers through the confidence I instilled within them.<br>
<br>
As Suzutsuki and her allies became more familiar with their special techniques, the Tester vessel was taken down in no time, and the Dragon Palace soon fell to Musashi's forces.<br>
Sakawa and Wakatsuki, freed from their previous battle, quickly made their way towards Nagato's territory just as Musashi had ordered.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">{namecode:74}：</span><br>
Ugh... Where did those two come from?<br>
That area is only defended by Harutsuki and Kawakaze... Musashi, are you...<br>
Going to force our friends to fight each other?!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">{namecode:84}：</span><br>
Force? Hardly. This was just a natural consequence of Akagi deploying her sea fog, and you deciding to reveal your commands to the rest of us.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">{namecode:74}：</span><br>
I won't let you have your way!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">{namecode:84}：</span><br>
Try me then. Show me what determination the child-made-guardian is capable of mustering.<br>

<br>
Exercise Area - Turn 3 (Musashi's Action)<br>
Taking advantage of the thick sea fog, Musashi's "retainers," Sakawa and Wakatsuki, crossed over to launch a surprise attack on the area occupied by Nagato's fleet.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Shoukaku：</span><br>
Harutsuki! Kawakaze! Musashi's forces are headed towards you!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Harutsuki：</span><br>
G-got it! But, where are they coming from? I can't really see through all this fog...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Kawakaze：</span><br>
They're coming straight at us! Prepare for combat, Harutsuki!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Harutsuki：</span><br>
H-huuuh?!<br>
<br>
As soon as Kawakaze drew her blade, Sakawa and Wakatsuki burst from the fog.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Sakawa：</span><br>
Hello there, Nagato's retainers~!<br>
I'm the Agano-class light cruiser, Sakawa. Let's have a fair fight, okay?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Wakatsuki：</span><br>
And I'm the Akizuki-class destroyer, Wakatsuki. Sorry for barging in all of a sudden, Harutsuki.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Harutsuki：</span><br>
I'll be fine... Probably...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Kawakaze：</span><br>
Harutsuki, remain alert. We're not allies anymore, for the time being.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Sakawa：</span><br>
Well, we don't necessarily have to fight, right? Musashi only ordered for us to move to this area.<br>
Plus, we just finished taking the Dragon Palace. I could use some extra time for rest and recovery~<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Harutsuki：</span><br>
Phew... I'd like to avoid conflict if possible...<br>
<br>
Unlike Harutsuki, who sighed in relief and lowered her weapons, Kawakaze remained vigilant and poised to strike.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Kawakaze：</span><br>
It's true that we're in top shape whereas you've sustained some damage from your previous battle.<br>
If you don't want to fight, I certainly won't force you to.<br>
But don't come a single step closer. Those are Lady Nagato's orders.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Sakawa：</span><br>
I see... So you've been ordered to hold us back. Hmm... I know you're strong, but are you strong enough to stop both of us?<br>
<br>
Hiei, who was situated in a nearby grid, heard the impending clash through her communication device.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Hiei：</span><br>
Nagato, you correctly anticipated Musashi's move, but you didn't fully plan for the effects of the sea fog.<br>
If you chose to launch an all-out attack in the fog, you would've been able to inflict more damage. However, that would prevent you from securing enough bases to pin Musashi in.<br>
It must've been a difficult decision, but you wanted to avoid fighting your own friends.<br>
The sea fog will clear soon, and now, it remains to be seen what kind of decision Musashi will make.<br>
<br>
The white veil that blanketed the sea began to thin out and disperse, until finally––<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Hiei：</span><br>
The sound of fighting...?! Does that mean...<br>
Musashi, you actually decided to pull the trigger?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Sakawa：</span><br>
Sorry, but we've got our orders. Um, Wakatsuki, you got Musashi's message as well, right?<br>
<br>
KABOOM––––!!<br>
Before Sakawa and Wakatsuki finished preparing to attack, Musashi's mass-produced ships emerged from the fog and began to hammer Harutsuki and Kawakaze with a ferocious barrage.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Sakawa：</span><br>
Sorry, but that's life for ya. We're going to have to fight after all.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Harutsuki：</span><br>
Didn't you just say the complete opposite thing a moment ago?!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Sakawa：</span><br>
Hey, I would've preferred to walk away as well, but we can't disobey the boss lady.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Kawakaze：</span><br>
I was right not to let my guard down...! But considering the damage those two have already sustained, we clearly have the upper hand!<br>
Harutsuki, stay close behind me! We'll settle this with close-range torpedo combat!<br>
<br>
Kawakaze drew her sword, her eyes narrowing as she maneuvered to place Sakawa and Wakatsuki between her and Musashi's mass-produced ships.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Sakawa：</span><br>
You've got some keen moves there, as expected of Nagato's personal bodyguard... But I'm no slouch either!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Wakatsuki：</span><br>
D-don't underestimate me either!<br>
<br>
Just when cannons and swords were about to trade blows––<br>
<br>
That's enough!<br>
A brilliant beam of light descended onto the battlefield, like a stream of cherry blossoms hitting the water's surface. The rest of the thinning sea fog was instantly pushed aside, and Nagato, flagship of the Reborn Combined Fleet, emerged.<br>
Nagato's barriers surrounded the attackers on both sides, pushing blades apart and rendering shells useless.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">{namecode:157}：</span><br>
Wow, she completely nullified the cannonballs in midair... Thank you so much, Great Guardian Fox!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">{namecode:74}：</span><br>
Mm. You have nothing to worry about with me here.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">{namecode:158}：</span><br>
Lady Nagato?! We were perfectly capable of handling the situation here... There's no need for you to personally enter the battlefield...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">{namecode:74}：</span><br>
This isn't a matter of trust. I've come to prevent a pointless fight.<br>
In this exercise, there is no reason for us to take up arms against one another. Sakawa, Wakatsuki, stand down!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Sakawa：</span><br>
Woooah, busted... Uhh, it's not like we chose to fight because wanted to...<br>
M-Musashi told us to kick back and enjoy the game, so I might've gotten a bit carried away, haha... Just a little.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Wakatsuki：</span><br>
Please forgive us, Lady Nagato!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Nagato：</span><br>
There's no need to apologize. This is just an exercise, and you were merely following orders.<br>
As Musashi said, there's no risk of injury in a controlled exercise area.<br>
We spar against each other pretty much on a daily basis as part of our normal training routine.<br>
So, you don't need to apologize, and you should continue this exercise as usual.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Sakawa：</span><br>
We didn't do anything wrong, did we?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Wakatsuki：</span><br>
If there's no risk involved in us fighting, why did you stop us?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Nagato：</span><br>
This game of Go is a clash of wills among the players outside. As such, the combat power of the ships inside is limited, while the importance of one's convictions is amplified.<br>
In other words, you won't accomplish anything from fighting each other in the conventional, physical sense. Rather, the only thing that matters is a clash of ideals - something that cannot happen when you are simply "following orders."<br>
And my conviction is this: there is no place for meaningless conflict. That is the path I shall demonstrate to the Sakura Empire, and the ideal I wish to demonstrate to Musashi and Akagi.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Sakawa：</span><br>
Well spoken! I must say, I am quite moved by your speech. The mighty shield you've produced must be a manifestation of your mental image, right?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Nagato：</span><br>
Most likely. Perhaps due to the time I spent sealed inside the Sacred Sakura, this domain also reflected the vivid memories I have of that place.<br>
But now, I am no longer the same person I was before. This may be the last time we see a scenery like this here.<br>
In any case, there is no more need for us to battle each other. If you remain unconvinced, then you will have to go through me first.<br>
As long as I stand, nobody will lay a finger on any of my friends!<br>

<br>
Sanctuary Pagoda - Reception Room<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">{namecode:84}：</span><br>
Nagato, I wasn't expecting you to enter the battle so soon.<br>
To think that a bit of testing the waters would trigger such a strong rebuke... Perhaps I underestimated that girl's resolve.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">{namecode:82}：</span><br>
Maybe not. That might've just been what Nagato wanted the whole time - to stand on the front lines.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">{namecode:91}：</span><br>
She would put herself in harm's way just to prevent unnecessary conflict...<br>
Because of that antiquated ego, she fails to see the bigger picture. Her fixation on "protecting" what is dear to her may well cause her to lose everything. How foolish.<br>
There is no future to be had down that road, with or without fighting.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">{namecode:84}：</span><br>
Regardless, by sacrificing her advantage as a "player" in this match, her forces now vastly eclipse ours in combat effectiveness.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">{namecode:91}：</span><br>
So, she insists on standing in the way... Mikasa, do you have what it takes to keep up with her?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">{namecode:82}：</span><br>
Keep up? Hah, I don't have the energy or determination that girl has. The most I can do is to fill in the gaps behind her as she forges a new path forward.<br>
Now that the balance of power has been broken, shouldn't we go back to securing as many bases as we can instead of fighting each other?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">{namecode:91}：</span><br>
You may be right in saying that Nagato is forging a new path forward.<br>
But does it not fall upon us to determine if that path leads to the light... or to the abyss?<br>
As someone responsible for shouldering the Sakura Empire's future, there are many other things to consider than your own narrow sense of justice. One cannot make judgments based on speculation and assumptions alone.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">{namecode:82}：</span><br>
I cannot deny what you have done for us. But at the same time, it is too dangerous to work with the Sirens.<br>
The Commander informed me about the Iron Blood incident not too long ago. Unlike in our case, the Commander was involved with their plan to a far greater degree.<br>
Plus, both Bismarck and Friedrich shared the same vision despite their diverging paths... That is why they were able to complete their lengthy project in the end.<br>
If Nagato and I could understand the path that you've chosen, perhaps we might've also been able to work together towards a common goal.<br>
But, your heart is just as opaque as the sea fog concealing this board.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">{namecode:91}：</span><br>
...In order to outwit the Sirens, you must first learn the taste of the poison they serve.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">{namecode:82}：</span><br>
Akagi, you...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">{namecode:91}：</span><br>
After the success of the Iron Blood rebellion, the Sirens have become much more vigilant.<br>
Now that Nagato has made her intentions clear, I will crush her and demonstrate the superiority of my vision.<br>
<br>
With Akagi's declaration, a dazzling light enveloped both her and the board, just as it had with Nagato previously.<br>
When the light faded, only two people remained around the board.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Mikasa：</span><br>
She also wants to prove herself, huh... Just like Nagato, she too can only do things in her own way.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Musashi：</span><br>
The balance of power has again been restored with Akagi's entry into the battle.<br>
She will most likely join up with Miyuki to cut you off from Nagato's forces.<br>
Now the question is, will she try to gobble up your bases, or will she launch an attack on the central tower?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Mikasa：</span><br>
She's not here anymore, so it'll be harder to read her intentions.<br>
It would appear that the youngsters are too impatient to keep our little game of chess going. Hahaha!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Musashi：</span><br>
Hehe. I'm sure you were no less hot-blooded yourself during that war. Isn't that right, Great Veteran?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Mikasa：</span><br>
But that was a completely different era, Musashi. A long, long time ago, wasn't it?<br>
Even if I tried to run off like them, my body wouldn't move. After all, there are people leaning on me now.<br>
...Musashi, be honest with me. This exercise area is actually a Mirror Sea, isn't it?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Musashi：</span><br>
What makes you say that?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Mikasa：</span><br>
Mapping one's mental imagery into existence, the sudden disappearance of Nagato and Akagi... Those aren't things that should be possible through the Sakura Islands' rituals.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Musashi：</span><br>
I wonder, do you really know everything there is to know about our rituals?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Mikasa：</span><br>
...Probably not.<br>
But, that's why I want to know. Pardon me if it seemed like I was accusing you.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Musashi：</span><br>
No, there's no need for that. Your instincts were correct - this is indeed a Mirror Sea, entrusted to Akagi by the Sirens.<br>
Originally, it was a Siren experimental site that none of us could use. But after combining it with spirit barriers, I was able to turn it into the domain you now see.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Mikasa：</span><br>
I'm not sure if what you've done is amazing or borderline heretical...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Musashi：</span><br>
I'll take that as high praise from the Great Veteran. I do wonder though... Has this place been to your liking?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Mikasa：</span><br>
I don't think it matters whether or not I "like" it. The reality is, I'm stunned by the number of things here that seem to defy conventional wisdom.<br>
And even more impressively, you're able to control these things. Perhaps the stories of the Iron Blood singularity aren't as far-fetched as I initially believed.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Musashi：</span><br>
I've also heard of a Sculpting Room that generates storms to keep everyone who does not possess the "Key" away.<br>
In any case, the actual Mirror Sea itself is sealed away, but I did not disclose this to you or Nagato knowing the suspicions both of you have towards Siren technology.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Mikasa：</span><br>
There was once a period of time when I was paranoid of Akagi's every move. At least now, I have fewer doubts about her intentions.<br>
By the way, how do you command your allies after entering the battlefield? To my understanding, our communications are not affected the way they would be in a Mirror Sea?<br>
We're able to give instructions directly to the entire fleet from here, and losing that ability would be a huge disadvantage.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Musashi：</span><br>
Don't worry. You won't be able to immediately grasp everyone's positions at once, but you will still be able to issue commands to them as before.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Mikasa：</span><br>
I see, so there aren't as many disadvantages as I imagined. So, for our allies inside, there's no difference in how they're getting their orders?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Musashi：</span><br>
Correct.<br>
There is a key difference though: when the retainer is unable to hear the player's voice, she has no choice but to obey the order. But if she is able to voice her opinions, she may be able to influence those orders.<br>
You will also be able to directly observe the condition of your forces, and that may cause you to make different decisions than if you treated them as pieces on a board.<br>
I wonder if Nagato and Akagi were aware of this before they made their decisions.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Mikasa：</span><br>
I'd imagine so. They chose to fight alongside their friends rather than sit out here enjoying tea with us.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Musashi：</span><br>
Hehe. Can't blame them.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Mikasa：</span><br>
Hahaha. Well then, as I told Akagi, I will remain here a bit longer.<br>
Show me what kind of moves the three of you will make.<br>

Exercise Area - Turn 4 (Akagi's Action)<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Yamashiro：</span><br>
A Compiler vessel... What were we doing while Milord was struggling for survival...?<br>
Ugh... I lost another mass-produced ship... At this rate, I'm going to be forced to retire from the game...<br>
As a battleship, I should be the one on the front lines... But I'm supposed to conserve my firepower and energy still...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Jintsuu：</span><br>
Calm down, Yamashiro. Akagi has already taken the base.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Yamashiro：</span><br>
Huh, really? Since when...<br>
<br>
Before Yamashiro could make sense of what she was seeing, Akagi had already crushed the Siren vessel.<br>
Burning petals swirled around her body, the only remaining traces of the Siren that had once been there.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Kaga：</span><br>
Akagi!<br>
When I saw your foxflames appear, I thought you had used another command. I didn't think you would directly enter the battlefield...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Akagi：</span><br>
I was going to fall asleep if I had to spend another minute in that cramped room. Just needed a little change in scenery.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ryuuhou：</span><br>
Akagi, what did you just do to that Compiler...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Akagi：</span><br>
Compiler models are known for having extremely high resistance to conventional weapons. However, we are able to use the unique features of this area to our advantage.<br>
I changed the characteristics of my attack, as you can see from these lycoris flowers here, allowing my flames to penetrate the vessel's weak points.<br>
Knowledge is power - the same is true for fighting Sirens as it is for understanding our opposition.<br>
(The sea fog had a fairly significant effect the first time it was used, but Mikasa will know how to deal with it if I use it a second time.)<br>
Nagato has also descended upon the battlefield. If we do not act quickly, there will be no more bases left to take, and we will be forced into a stalemate.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ryuuhou：</span><br>
Understood. We trust your judgment, Akagi.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Akagi：</span><br>
That's fine, but your own safety comes first. The same goes for Jintsuu and the others.<br>
Color me surprised, though... I didn't expect to see another Compiler so soon. Seems like the ghosts of the past are all coming out to play.<br>
I suppose this means that even if the mainframe has been destroyed, its data can still be used to create spares... But what is the point in doing that––<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Yamashiro：</span><br>
Thank you for saving us, Akagi! If it weren't for you, all our mass-produced ships probably would've gotten wiped out!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Akagi：</span><br>
...Do you think I'd exhaust our resources securing a base of this size? I sent the mass-produced ships in to gauge the opponent's specs.<br>
Yamashiro, you will be needed to secure a more important objective.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Yamashiro：</span><br>
A more important objective...? Are you talking about the tower over there? I'm not sure I'll be able to take down even stronger enemies...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Akagi：</span><br>
Hold on. I'm not done talking yet.<br>
Mikasa has already formed a perimeter through the southern side of the board. If we allow her forces to join up with Nagato's, we're as good as done.<br>
Jintsuu, I'd like you to join up with Miyuki. Cross over past the central tower and look for an opportunity to split off Mikasa and Nagato.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">{namecode:39}&{namecode:5}：</span><br>
Understood!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Akagi：</span><br>
Yamashiro, you have the important task of preventing Mikasa's forces from advancing on the central tower. I need you to hold the waters around that area.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Yamashiro：</span><br>
I just knew I was gonna get sent there! Ugh, everyone's going to be ganging up on me...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ryuuhou：</span><br>
That area is where most of the action is going to be, but with your durability, I'm sure you'll be fine. If anything, I'm sure Akagi chose to send you specifically because you're the best fit for the task.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Yamashiro：</span><br>
Oh, I see... Well, if Akagi has that much confidence in me...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ryuuhou：</span><br>
Surprisingly, the two of you seem to work together pretty well.<br>
Akagi, let me go to the central tower as well. In case something happens there, it'll be safer to have two people instead of one.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Akagi：</span><br>
That leaves me a bit short-handed for my other move, but it's true that having two people grants both of you more flexibility.<br>
We should be able to work with that... I'll allow it. Make sure you cover Yamashiro.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ryuuhou：</span><br>
Understood, Akagi.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Akagi：</span><br>
Now then, Great Veteran Mikasa. It's your move.<br>

Exercise Area - Turn 4 (Mikasa's Action)<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Kirishima：</span><br>
Akagi has sent a fleet to hold the waters around the central tower.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Hatakaze：</span><br>
Is she trying to prevent us from assisting Lady Nagato?<br>
She just took a base, but is already poised to make her next move...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Haguro：</span><br>
Doesn't this put us in a tough position though? We haven't even finished capturing the Diadem of Light yet.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Kongou：</span><br>
Mikasa said she can handle this situation.<br>
We will maintain pressure around the central area to keep Akagi's forces occupied and allow Nagato to take all the remaining small bases along the perimeter.<br>
Akagi is trying to fulfill three objectives at once, using speed and misdirection to throw us off. However, she is unable to muster significant numbers for any one of those objectives.<br>
<br>
While surveying a map of the exercise area, Kongou relayed the messages she received directly from Mikasa.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Kongou：</span><br>
Even if Akagi manages to capture some of the bases around the central tower, she won't have the resources to push further west.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Kinu：</span><br>
Why is she doing this? Shouldn't Akagi know that our forces are concentrated around the Diadem of Light?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Hatakaze：</span><br>
That's most likely the reason why she only sent a small detachment.<br>
If she planned on taking any other bases on the western side, she would have to commit a lot more resources.<br>
That's why I think this might be a feint. Even though we have the numerical advantage, we're prone to getting pincered if we get too focused on surrounding the detachment.<br>
Regardless of what Akagi is specifically aiming to do, she's going to keep her forces in an area where they will be able to come to each others' aid.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Kinu：</span><br>
In other words, it's advantageous to keep the enemy in one place?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Kongou：</span><br>
What we can most likely surmise is, Akagi is trying to keep us from attacking the central tower.<br>
I understand what Mikasa is trying to accomplish, so the next step is turning this situation into an advantage.<br>
After all, we're in no hurry to take the central tower. If anything, Akagi would do us a huge favor by scouting out exactly what kind of enemy we're dealing with in that tower.<br>
For the time being, focus on capturing the Diadem of Light.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Haguro：</span><br>
So we'll be directing all our firepower at the bases and trying to avoid other shipgirls, huh?<br>
Right, I just got a report from the recon planes - we're dealing with an Omitter vessel up ahead.<br>
Omitters tend to be more aggressive than other types of Sirens, but this isn't a fight we can back down from.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Kongou：</span><br>
Don't worry.<br>
Mikasa informed me that this battle will be pivotal for us. Don't hold anything back, and hit that Omitter vessel with everything you've got.<br>
Naturally, I will be joining you too. How could the first ship of the Kongou-class battleships miss this chance for glory?<br>
I will lead the charge! Capture the Diadem of Light, then turn around as a unit and intercept Akagi's fleet!<br>

Exercise Area - Turn 4 (Nagato's Action)<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Haruna：</span><br>
Woah, Akagi and Mikasa both managed to capture a 5-point base already?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Nagato：</span><br>
Yes... The only one that hasn't been captured at this point is this Sacred Sakura... Unlike me, Mikasa continues to show no signs of hesitation...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Haruna：</span><br>
What's wrong, Nagato?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Nagato：</span><br>
It's nothing. We've already managed to force Sakawa and Wakatsuki back.<br>
We can't afford to fall behind either. Let's take the Sacred Sakura this turn.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Hiei：</span><br>
Understood. For some reason, my combat performance seems to have improved after my sister's feats.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Nagato：</span><br>
This domain continues to work in mysterious ways. Interesting.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Shoukaku：</span><br>
Those two girls might've retreated for now, but isn't there a chance they attack again on Musashi's turn?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Nagato：</span><br>
If you are concerned about that, I shall monitor the situation myself. Bring mass-produced ships with you to avoid being caught off-guard.<br>
After we take the Sacred Sakura, there is no longer any benefit for Musashi to attack this area.<br>
If she still wishes to test me after that, she will find that I am not lacking in resolve.<br>
Harutsuki, I want you to head towards the central tower to monitor the situation with Akagi and Mikasa. Kawakaze will cover you.<br>
Shoukaku, Hiei, and Haruna - the three of you will move south and capture the bases along the perimeter.<br>
Musashi, I hope you stop whatever you're trying to do... at least while all of us participants are in the dark about the true purpose of this game...<br>
If we hope to achieve victory without fighting, we will need to capture as many bases as possible while we still can.<br>
I must see through her words and determine what's going on inside her mind... That is my purpose here!<br>

<br>
Sanctuary Pagoda - Reception Room<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">{namecode:84}：</span><br>
I see you've finally caught a small glimpse into this game's true purpose, Nagato.<br>
It's just as you said, Mikasa - she is prepared to do what it takes in order to secure her "bloodless" victory...<br>
...Even if she knows it is a waste of the immense power bestowed upon her. Did you predict this as well?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">{namecode:82}：</span><br>
Hah, I'm not a mind-reader, nor do I claim to know everything about Nagato. But what I do know is, now that she has chosen a path, it is my duty to follow it through.<br>
If Nagato does decide to fight, I will gladly take up arms by her side. Both you and Akagi were aware of this before the game even began, right?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">{namecode:84}：</span><br>
In my eyes, you seem more concerned with keeping Akagi in check than facilitating Nagato's victory.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">{namecode:82}：</span><br>
Possibly? It sometimes seems like you know me better than I know myself.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">{namecode:84}：</span><br>
Compassion for the weak may be a virtue, but on the battlefield, it may just as well be your undoing.<br>
I can easily understand your loyalties and what you are aiming for... But why are you keeping that child from facing Akagi?<br>
Your actions do not pave the path to victory. Instead of showing me a vision of the future, you still seem to be shackled by your mistrust.<br>
Now, your fate is no longer in your own hands.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">{namecode:82}：</span><br>
Mistrust? No, it is a measured anticipation more than anything else. Everything depends on what Akagi decides to do - and I have accepted this.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">{namecode:84}：</span><br>
Once you've been put on the back foot, you will continue to remain at a disadvantage. Can someone who has given up the initiative keep her eyes on the future when she cannot even keep up with the present?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">{namecode:82}：</span><br>
Initiative is not everything. We will find out soon enough if Akagi has the discipline to stay, or if she ends up going bust in her haste.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">{namecode:84}：</span><br>
Heh. Right you are, but what will you do if she doesn't end up going bust?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">{namecode:82}：</span><br>
I can tell where you'd prefer to hedge your bets. I won't take it personally if we end up standing on opposite sides.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">{namecode:84}：</span><br>
Surely you jest, Great Veteran~<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">{namecode:82}：</span><br>
At this point, I still have time on my side. You're not scrambling to make any moves either, are you?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">{namecode:84}：</span><br>
True. Unlike Nagato, you are not so easy to provoke.<br>
But surely this isn't what you're interested in. You've had questions for me this whole time, haven't you?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">{namecode:82}：</span><br>
Too many things have been on my mind. Things that don't make any sense to me.<br>
For example, why did you send Shinano to Sardegna, and Zuikaku to Iron Blood?<br>
Neither of these things were ordered by the higher-ups, and these decisions were made on extremely short notice.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">{namecode:84}：</span><br>
Are you suggesting that I'm deliberately keeping them away from the Sakura Empire?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">{namecode:82}：</span><br>
I can't think of any other explanation.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">{namecode:84}：</span><br>
Shinano is a good representative for our goodwill delegation to Sardegna, and Zuikaku already has some standing with Iron Blood following her visit to their floating fortress.<br>
Do you disagree with my choice of delegates?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">{namecode:82}：</span><br>
Then, what about the Watatsumi? I heard it had been returned to us, but before anyone realized it, it had gone missing again.<br>
None of us get to arbitrarily decide what to do with the Sakura Empire's relics. Where is it?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">{namecode:84}：</span><br>
Due to the attack on the Diadem of Light, the security protocols regarding our sacred relics have been called into question, so I had it moved to a safer location.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">{namecode:82}：</span><br>
...Do you know anything about the Watatsumi's origins? The more I look into it, the more I doubt it's actually an ancient relic passed down from generation to generation.<br>
I get the same impressions of the Sanctuary. I can't help but feel that Sirens are involved somehow.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">{namecode:84}：</span><br>
That's news to me. I don't know any more about these things than you do, unfortunately.<br>
Perhaps, I know even less. After all, Akagi's dealings with the Sirens are her responsibility alone. I merely give her the authorization she needs.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">{namecode:82}：</span><br>
Akagi's dealings with Siren technology wouldn't have been possible without your backing.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">{namecode:84}：</span><br>
If you already know this much, then what need is there to hear it from my mouth?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">{namecode:82}：</span><br>
We cannot allow Siren technology... No, the Sirens themselves, to go unchecked! Do you not have enough love and loyalty for the Sakura Empire to realize that?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">{namecode:84}：</span><br>
I have nothing but love and loyalty. However...<br>
The Sakura Empire owes the power it currently enjoys to Siren technology. Even without the Naval HQ's Reenactments, we have already become addicted to their poison.<br>
News of this should have reached your ears while you were in seclusion.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">{namecode:82}：</span><br>
I do not believe for a second that this momentary peace means the Sirens have retreated. Ever since the Iron Blood's rebellion, they've been far too quiet.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">{namecode:84}：</span><br>
Then, would you say the Sirens are watching us, biding their time?<br>
Akagi has led the Sakura Empire thus far not because of her relationship to Amagi, nor because she's actively trying to obtain Siren technology.<br>
It is because she has chosen the path that you, I, and the entire Sakura Empire believes in.<br>
What you see is an Akagi ensnared by the corrupting influence of the Sirens, just as how the Black Cube ensnared Bismarck.<br>
But without that power, the Sakura Empire would have no future.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">{namecode:82}：</span><br>
No future? You're not making any sense...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">{namecode:84}：</span><br>
Mikasa, you know what Reenactments are, right? As long as they continue, we will all be condemned to annihilation, just like Bismarck was.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">{namecode:82}：</span><br>
We cannot allow that to happen. I would gladly give my life to resist.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">{namecode:84}：</span><br>
Akagi said the exact same thing. You are focusing only on her madness and have lost sight of her true nature.<br>
If Akagi's path is wrong, then it is necessary to see the reflections of her mind and heart which paved that path.<br>
Akagi is not as simple-minded as you, and Zuikaku, seem to believe.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">{namecode:82}：</span><br>
Are you saying... that Akagi also seeks to destroy our Reenactment, just like the Iron Blood did with theirs?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">{namecode:84}：</span><br>
You've seen the Commander's report too, haven't you? The Sirens deployed a weapon that causes the very foundation of our hulls to tremble.<br>
Those scenes they showed us were not illusions. They are the basis of the Sirens' Natural Calculation System... In other words, their "reality."<br>
Shinano has seen the same dream over and over again. From that single "reality," we are destroyed again and again in countless futures.<br>
A black tornado that seeks to devour the ocean. Horrendous beasts that defy the power of the KAN-SEN and crush our destined future... There is no escape from them.<br>
As long as we cannot break the recorded Reenactment that leads to their "reality," we will be nothing more than ragdolls dancing in the Sirens' palms.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">{namecode:82}：</span><br>
All those sacrifices we made to push them back during the last war... Does none of that matter?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">{namecode:84}：</span><br>
What matters is... None of us can accept that reality lying down. Not Akagi, and not the Commander.<br>
The Naval HQ's... No, rather, the Sirens' Reenactments... They may be too numerous to count.<br>
Even if we are able to escape the flames of war, the power of those aberrant beasts will still bear down upon us–<br>
Akagi, Kaga, Yamato, myself... All of the Sakura Empire. All the shipgirls in this world. Everything will be devoured... until even the dreamer herself meets the same fate.<br>
...Do you understand now, Mikasa?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">{namecode:82}：</span><br>
That... is not a future we can accept.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">{namecode:84}：</span><br>
What Akagi seeks to do is to render all Reenactments null and void, so that they are nothing more than leaves on the tree of possibility.<br>
As principled and compassionate as you are, your distrust towards Akagi is understandable.<br>
However, principles mean nothing if they cannot be defended and enforced. If you believe your path to be correct, then you must prove it to Akagi - with your strength.<br>
Unlike Akagi and Nagato, you are not weak. But even then, you could not bear the burden of the entire Sakura Empire atop your shoulders.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">{namecode:82}：</span><br>
Musashi...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">{namecode:84}：</span><br>
This exercise was designed to be a clash of ideals, not rhetoric.<br>
But in the end, isn't it too boring waxing philosophical around a chessboard?<br>
Make your move, Mikasa. There are those who believe in you, and in the victory they believe you will lead them to.<br>
Don't keep them waiting too long, Great Veteran.<br>

<br>
As the vermillion light of the setting sun began to filter through the pagoda's windows, both the state of the game and the situation on the battlefield had reached a tense stalemate.<br>
Through the fifth and sixth turns, the participants continued to jockey for an advantage, but nobody emerged as a clear favorite.<br>
Fatigue began to set in, and this began to reflect across the board. Enemies that were previously easy to deal with appeared larger and more fearsome as they ramped up their attacks on the various shipgirls.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">{namecode:82}：</span><br>
What's going on here, Musashi? We're getting completely pushed back by the game itself...<br>
The enemies may not be particularly strong, but everyone's forces have been deployed in ways that would never be considered in an actual naval engagement.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">{namecode:84}：</span><br>
This has caused disarray to spread. While some have been able to accomplish their objectives...<br>
With the amount of damage that's been piling up, I wouldn't be surprised if we start seeing people retire from the game soon.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">{namecode:82}：</span><br>
Is Jintsuu about to be the first to go? What a pity...<br>
I suppose the one upside is, we didn't inflict this upon each other.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">{namecode:84}：</span><br>
Everyone has their hands full just dealing with the mass-produced enemies.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">{namecode:82}：</span><br>
I do wonder about that. If the balance of power is broken, the game may well be blown wide open.<br>
I assumed that as long as you remained on Akagi's side, the stalement would inevitably continue. But, unexpected things can happen.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">{namecode:84}：</span><br>
Akagi's forces have traveled a long way.<br>
But now, they've already converged upon the central tower.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">{namecode:82}：</span><br>
Surely that isn't your idea of a victory, is it?<br>
The two of you, especially Akagi, put your forces through too much punishment just to reach the central tower. You've also lost a bulk of your mass-produced ships because they weren't able to keep up.<br>
On the other hand, Nagato and I have sustained very little damage and can operate at pretty much full capacity.<br>
Your failure to consider this has left you wide open. Hah hah!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">{namecode:84}：</span><br>
And what have you earned for yourself? A slight land advantage? While we occupy our position, you will not be able to assault the tower...<br>
Especially if Nagato insists on clinging to her idealism.<br>
I am quite interested in seeing what matters most to her: adhering to her own path, or seizing the victory she needs.<br>
To those ends, I have a test for you.<br>
I will turn all my ships around and attack Haguro, who is monitoring my fleet's movements and closest to Nagato's forces.<br>
Sakawa, Suzutsuki, Chitose, and then Chiyoda will attack her in turn, and at this distance, Nagato will not able to lend aid even if she wants to.<br>
While it pains me to resort to such tactics, this stalemate must be broken.<br>
After Haguro is defeated, Nagato's forces will also be exposed as well.<br>
There was one way she could have stopped this outcome, but she unfortunately wasted it earlier.<br>
No matter how strong your will is, this domain will not respond to the same mental imagery twice.<br>
But if that will is shared by another individual...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">{namecode:82}：</span><br>
...Then they must fight for those ideals. Say no more. I will uphold Nagato's vision.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">{namecode:84}：</span><br>
Excellent. My only regret is, it'll be quite lonely here with nobody left to chat with.<br>
Just to confirm one last time: Is this what you truly want, Great Veteran?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">{namecode:82}：</span><br>
I decided a long time ago that I would stand by her side until the very end. I won't turn back now.<br>
There might be advantages to managing everything from up here, but I have friends who are counting on me to do the right thing.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">{namecode:84}：</span><br>
Nagato would sacrifice herself to protect her friends, and there is nothing Akagi will not sacrifice to protect what she desires.<br>
Now then, Mikasa, will you take up the sword, or the shield?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">{namecode:82}：</span><br>
My answer should already be clear. But what about you?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">{namecode:84}：</span><br>
If you and Nagato can emerge victorious, I shall give you my answer.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">{namecode:82}：</span><br>
Hah. If you're going to say that, you'd better not expect me to go easy on you.<br>
I'll be going then, Musashi. Oh, and if you get too lonely, you're always welcome to join the rest of us. Hahaha!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">{namecode:84}：</span><br>
Hehe. We will see about that.<br>

<br>
Exercise Area - Turn 6 (Musashi's Action)<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Sakawa：</span><br>
No hard feelings, Haguro, but the boss lady wants you outta here. Are you ready?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Haguro：</span><br>
Ugh... I knew this was gonna turn into a pain in the ass sooner or later...<br>
I've been milling around over here for a while now, so why'd I become so important all of a sudden?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Sakawa：</span><br>
Jintsuu's pretty much done for, right? So we've gotta even things up a bit. You're actually not even Musashi's main target - that would be poor little Harutsuki.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Haguro：</span><br>
Alright, guess we're doing this... Come at me, then.<br>
But just a word of warning - be careful where you aim your attacks. Otherwise, you might end up taking Miyuki out.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Sakawa：</span><br>
Huh? I thought we were gonna have a fair fight! Why are you dragging Miyuki into this?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Haguro：</span><br>
So, what's the plan? I'm good at fighting with my back to the wall, so don't blame me if Miyuki gets caught in the crossfire.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Sakawa：</span><br>
Why you...! Ugh, I can't just turn around and leave though! I have orders from Musashi!<br>
Miyuki, don't let Haguro bully you! Let's team up and take her out this turn!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Miyuki：</span><br>
O-okay! I'll do my best!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Haguro：</span><br>
Tch, guess my bluff didn't work out the way I wanted it to... Well, that sucks.<br>
<br>
After her attempt to use the possibility of friendly fire to deter Sakawa failed, Haguro braced herself for a lopsided two-versus-one, when suddenly–<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">{namecode:82}：</span><br>
Stop right there!<br>
<br>
A voice boomed from the sky, and the three shipgirls about to clash all stopped in their tracks.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">{namecode:226}：</span><br>
Huuh? What's happening to my rigging? It feels a bit wonky...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">{namecode:65}：</span><br>
I was able to move perfectly fine until a moment ago... Is this someone's special command at work?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">{namecode:5}：</span><br>
I, I can't move my rigging either... Um, does it have to do with this ring of light that just appeared around us?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">{namecode:65}：</span><br>
That must be it... Is that you, Mikasa?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">{namecode:82}：</span><br>
Hahaha, you guessed it!<br>
<br>
As the three turned towards the source of the voice, Mikasa's figure slowly appeared from the distance.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Mikasa：</span><br>
Sorry if I sound like a broken record, but Nagato doesn't want us fighting, and I don't either.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Haguro：</span><br>
Phew, that wouldn't have ended well for me... Was that Nagato's doing just now?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Mikasa：</span><br>
No, that was my command. I also share the same vision as her - one in which we no longer fight amongst ourselves.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Miyuki：</span><br>
Does that mean... You're overriding Musashi's orders?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Mikasa：</span><br>
I guess so. Aren't you glad you don't have to fight anymore?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Miyuki：</span><br>
Y-yeah... I was just capturing this base on Akagi's orders...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Mikasa：</span><br>
What's wrong, Sakawa? Are you going to insist on fighting?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Sakawa：</span><br>
Ahaha, no, no! I was just, uh... getting a sense of deja vu, that's all!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Mikasa：</span><br>
I don't have anything against us sparring during a normal exercise, but it makes no sense to fight each other when the central tower is still standing.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Sakawa：</span><br>
Haha, I don't mind, really. As long as this game has exciting twists and turns, I'm perfectly content to sit back and watch things unfold!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Mikasa：</span><br>
I'm glad you understand. However, the same can't be said for the mindless mass-produced ships headed this way.<br>
But, they seem to be firing indiscriminately at everything in their path... Does Musashi not care about the safety of her peers, or...<br>
<br>
As Musashi's command dissipated, the mass-produced ships also began to fall silent again. However, Jintsuu, who had already been heavily damaged, sustained enough damage to render her incapacitated.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Mikasa：</span><br>
These were unfortunate circumstances, Jintsuu.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Miyuki：</span><br>
I'm so sorry, Jintsuu... I should've turned back to help you...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Jintsuu：</span><br>
Don't worry about it, it's just a simulated exercise anyway. I'm not actually hurt, just... a little numb?<br>
I have to say, the technology here is pretty lifelike. But I'm sure I'll be fine as soon as I leave the exercise area.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Mikasa：</span><br>
You don't necessarily have to leave just because you've been determined to be incapacitated, right?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Jintsuu：</span><br>
That's alright. I'd just get in the way of everyone else if I lingered around without a particularly strong motive in mind.<br>
Honestly, Sendai probably would've been better-suited for this exercise than me. I guess I'll see you folks later.<br>

Exercise Area - Turn 7 (Akagi's Action)<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ryuuhou：</span><br>
The most recent report from my recons looks good. We've managed to control this area for several turns now, and we have a clear picture as to how the other fleets are deployed.<br>
Miyuki is pretty much surrounded, and we just lost Jintsuu. Mikasa entered the battlefield and is sealing off all shipgirls from fighting around her territory.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Akagi：</span><br>
Now that the Great Veteran has thrown her hat into the ring, we won't be able to avoid a direct confrontation.<br>
Yamashiro, Ryuuhou, I want the two of you to back off and give Mikasa a clear avenue to attack the central tower.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Yamashiro：</span><br>
Phew... It was getting harder and harder to fight off the mass-produced Sirens...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Akagi：</span><br>
In spite of that, you still have most of your ammo and barely took any damage. Do a quick resupply, and I expect you to come back ready to go.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Yamashiro：</span><br>
Y-yes ma'am!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Akagi：</span><br>
Miyuki, just stay where you are. Give us an update on Nagato and Mikasa's movements later.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Miyuki：</span><br>
G-got it!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Akagi：</span><br>
Kaga, Ryuuhou, I want you two to launch a large-scale recon effort on the central tower.<br>
We need to find out what Musashi is trying to hide from us within that tower.<br>
<br>
Exercise Area - Turn 7 (Mikasa's Action)<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Kongou：</span><br>
Look, those are Sakura Empire recon aircraft... Akagi must be getting ready to attack the central tower! Mikasa, should we make our move as well?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Mikasa：</span><br>
Hmm... Have we finally broken through to Akagi? She seems to be leaving a path for us straight to the central tower.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Kongou：</span><br>
Does that mean... She's given up on trying to fight us, and is telling us to focus on the central base first?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Mikasa：</span><br>
That is one possibility, but she also might've found something there that requires us to be there.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Kinu：</span><br>
So that's why she pulled back her forces?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Hatakaze：</span><br>
She might be planning to use us as cannon fodder to find out exactly what's in that tower, no?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Mikasa：</span><br>
Knowing Akagi, she wouldn't do anything unless she seeks to gain an advantage from it, but we can't afford to sit around idly either.<br>
Kirishima, Kongou, can I trouble you two to get visuals on the tower itself? We need to know what we're up against.<br>
Haguro, continue to monitor Akagi's and Musashi's movements. Let me know if they show any signs of trying to attack us again.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Haguro：</span><br>
So, how about you and Kinu? What are you two going to do?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Mikasa：</span><br>
I'm going to meet up with Nagato. Even without the central tower, Nagato can still win if she captures all the bases along the perimeter.<br>
More importantly, I need to tie up a few loose ends before this game is finished.<br>

<br>
Exercise Area - Turn 7 (Nagato's Action)<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Kawakaze：</span><br>
Lady Nagato, why did Mikasa leave that base before clearing out all the enemies? Is this some sort of miscalculation?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Nagato：</span><br>
No, she most likely did that on purpose.<br>
<br>
After defeating the rest of the enemies occupying the base node, Nagato looked into the distance towards Mikasa and opened a communication channel.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Nagato：</span><br>
Did you leave that base for me on purpose, Mikasa?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Mikasa：</span><br>
That's right.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Nagato：</span><br>
Th-thank you...<br>
You protected Harutsuki until you yourself joined the battlefield... I, I cannot thank you enough.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Mikasa：</span><br>
Don't worry about it. The tea party up there was making me sleepy, so I needed a change in scenery.<br>
Since we don't get an opportunity to experience a place like this every day, I figured it'd be nice to take advantage of the front-row seats.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Nagato：</span><br>
Regardless, I must thank you again...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Mikasa：</span><br>
What's wrong? You sound like you're about to cry.<br>
Remember what Musashi said? This domain reflects your mental imagery and your convictions. If you don't keep your will strong, you'll be put on the back foot.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Nagato：</span><br>
I just need to believe in my ideals... and capture this base without hesitation.<br>
<br>
Nagato ended the communication, repeating Mikasa's words in her head again and again, a slight sigh escaping from her lips.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Nagato：</span><br>
Alright... Kawakaze, Shoukaku, let's move on to the next base. We can't wait for Mikasa to serve everything to us on a silver platter.<br>
Haruna, Hiei, the two of you should make preparations to attack the central base.<br>
Harutsuki, the two of us will go check on Sakawa and Miyuki. If you have any emergency repair supplies left, we'll give those to them.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Harutsuki：</span><br>
Understood!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Nagato：</span><br>
Focus on healing anyone who needs it. We do not make foes amongst ourselves in the Sakura Empire.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Harutsuki：</span><br>
Are these the rest of your emergency repair supplies? Thank you, Lady Nagato! I'll be sure to put them to good use!<br>
<br>
Harutsuki waved her gohei around and offered an earnest prayer. Miraculously, some of the signs of damage on Miyuki's and Sakawa's riggings seemed to recede.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Miyuki：</span><br>
Woah... What a warm sensation... Th-thank you very much...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Sakawa：</span><br>
I can feel Harutsuki's prayers healing me up! Ahh, even after everything I've done, you're still so kind to me, Lady Nagato!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Nagato：</span><br>
Sakawa, I know why Musashi sent you over and over. But no matter how many times she tries, she will not shake my resolve.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Sakawa：</span><br>
Look, I really appreciate you giving me the benefit of the doubt... But if Musashi orders it, I'm going to have to attack you again.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Nagato：</span><br>
We'll cross that bridge when we get there. But nothing changes the fact that you're also a member of the Sakura Empire and one of our friends.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Sakawa：</span><br>
Ahh, you're so pure-hearted it hurts to look at you! Buuut, you'd better be careful not to let others take advantage of that~<br>
Musashi was right about one thing - this place definitely HAS been quite the experience. Too bad my sisters aren't here to witness it as well.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Mikasa：</span><br>
Speaking of your sisters... I haven't seen Yura in a while. Do you know where she is?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Sakawa：</span><br>
Hmm... I heard Musashi gave her some top-secret mission not too long ago, but I obviously don't know the details beyond that...<br>
Why, did you need her for something?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Mikasa：</span><br>
No, I was just curious.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Nagato：</span><br>
Phew... That concludes my turn.<br>
I can only hope Musashi comes to understand my intentions.<br>

<br>
Exercise Area - Turn 7 (Musashi's Action)<br>
When Musashi's turn rolled around, Sakawa, who was still with Nagato's fleet, suddenly found herself surrounded by purple butterflies.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Haguro：</span><br>
What is she planning to do this time...?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Sakawa：</span><br>
I suppose I'll be heading towards the tower now. These butterflies seem to be patching me up and making me stronger.<br>
Lady Nagato, I think you've gotten your point across! Hopefully we won't have to fight anymore!<br>
I was just wondering why we had to jump through so many hoops in the first place. I thought there'd be a lot more competition over the big 10-point base in the middle!<br>
<br>
Sakawa looked towards the imposing tower in the middle of the exercise area. Akagi had tried to scout it out earlier, but waves of Siren enemies made any movement around the area difficult.<br>
One after another, ships from the four fleets began to arrive around the tower.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Suzutsuki ：</span><br>
That ominous red aura was spooky enough from a distance, but up close, the thing looks like it might even be alive!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Chiyoda：</span><br>
Ugh, please don't say that. The way the light is flickering makes it seem like it's breathing...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Wakatsuki：</span><br>
The other four facilities here were some of the Sakura Empire's most sacred sites... So why would this Siren facility be sitting in the middle of this whole place?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Sakawa：</span><br>
Do you remember hearing from Akagi and the Commander that they also had to destroy some kind of tower during the Iron Blood rebellion?<br>
Do you think this tower represents some higher form of Siren?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Chiyoda：</span><br>
How much "higher" can it be if it lost the ability to move around? Chitose, let's go smash that thing up, just the two of us!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Chitose：</span><br>
O-okay...! Um, also, I've decided on a name for our combo attack... F-Featherstorm!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Sakawa：</span><br>
Is everyone showing off the special techniques they've developed here? I guess I have no choice but to join in on the fun myself––<br>
Ahem! ...I am the piercer of the blue waves, inheritor of the Rakshasa's blade! True Demon Slash!<br>
<br>
Sakawa and Wakatsuki both unleashed a blade of light from their riggings, the rippling bolts of energy expanding to several times their original size as they hurtled towards the tower.<br>
Chitose and Chiyoda's combination attack also landed a direct hit on the base of the tower, a plume of flame and smoke quickly rising in the aftermath.<br>
But in a heartbeat, the tower released a nigh-intangible shockwave back at the shipgirls.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Kirishima：</span><br>
It absorbed our attacks, just like before... Except this time, the shockwaves seem to be stronger corresponding to the strength of the attacks.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Kongou：</span><br>
That's not much of a "counterattack" though - it's barely enough to rock the waters. That can't be all there is to this tower.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Kinu：</span><br>
Wait, there's something different about the tower now. Do you see any differences in the pattern of light coming from it?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Kirishima：</span><br>
You're right, it's not the same as before. Do you think it's reacting to the attacks we just threw at it?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Hatakaze：</span><br>
It's too early to say... But if it's like the tower the Commander encountered during that battle, there might be something nasty sleeping inside.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Kongou：</span><br>
Those weak shockwaves won't even leave a scratch on us!<br>
<br>
However, the moment Musashi's fleet stopped attacking, a blinding flash radiated out from the tip of the tower, tearing violently through the entire domain.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Haguro：</span><br>
Wh-what in the world was that?! The tower's counterattacking for real now?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Kongou：</span><br>
Damnit, I spoke too soon... Watch out, everyone! Something's totally different about that tower!<br>
<br>
When the shipgirls gathered their senses from the previous shockwave, they quickly noticed that Kirishima, Suzutsuki, Chiyoda, and Yamashiro were no longer present. Instead, they had been replaced by Sirens.<br>
<span style="color:#ec5d53;">Arbiter: The Hermit IX：</span><br>
.........<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Kongou：</span><br>
Kirishima... got taken out in one blow?!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Mikasa：</span><br>
I guess the first pulse was just a warning shot... This tower seems to throw back all the energy we pump into it, several times over...<br>
Did the Commander also have to fight against an enemy like this, or...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Hatakaze：</span><br>
Three of Musashi's retainers were taken out in a single blow... They aren't even present in the domain anymore.<br>
If Musashi designed this place, shouldn't she have been aware of exactly what she's up against? Why did she waste her own troops like this then?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Haguro：</span><br>
G-Great Veteran, look over there at that Siren...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Mikasa：</span><br>
The Arbiter that appeared in the NA Ocean...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Nagato：</span><br>
It must be a vessel...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Shoukaku：</span><br>
I see. I've heard all about the Commander's exploits in the NA Ocean, but it seems these towers are guarded by Arbiters...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Akagi：</span><br>
Is this the surprise you prepared for us, Musashi?<br>
I'll admit, I'm impressed. How did you manage to procure data on an Arbiter and even manufacture a vessel for it?<br>
Shoukaku, you remember this Siren too, don't you? We encountered it briefly in the heart of the NA Ocean.<br>
I won't forgive it for what it did... Making such a vile imitation of Amagi...<br>
Hahaha... Hahahahaha... Even if you're nothing more than a vessel, I'll make you pay!<br>
If this is what I was invited here to do, then I will entertain you, Musashi!<br>

Sanctuary Pagoda - Reception Room<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">{namecode:84}：</span><br>
There's nothing wrong with letting someone else win. But do you know what it means to entrust your will to someone else?<br>
<br>
Musashi now sat alone at the board, quietly overlooking the situation in the exercise area.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">{namecode:84}：</span><br>
Unlike Nagato and Akagi, you already have true strength. It is unsurprising that we would not be able to see eye-to-eye.<br>
<br>
Just as Musashi furrowed her brow in discontent, a familiar chirping sound came from the window. A small bird gently landed atop Musashi's shoulder.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">{namecode:84}：</span><br>
So you came again. Did I not say that this pagoda would not shelter you from the elements?<br>
But if you insist on being my companion... I can at least keep you safe through the coming storm.<br>
<br>
As if buoyed by Musashi's words, the fledgling swallow chirped a few times.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">{namecode:84}：</span><br>
What an interesting one you are... Now, I have a little question for you.<br>
Who do you think will be the winner of this "exercise?"<br>
<br>
Musashi gestured to the holographic display in front of her, and the swallow fluttered its wings a few times as if to respond.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">{namecode:84}：</span><br>
Haha, that question may indeed be too difficult for you... just as it is for me.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Communicator：</span><br>
BEEP! BEEP! BEEP!<br>
<br>
The communicator next to her beeped three times in warning before falling silent again. Musashi returned her gaze back to the board.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">{namecode:84}：</span><br>
Now that everyone has gathered around the tower... Let us put an end to this game.<br>
I have assembled the pieces for you. I have brought you before the power you seek.<br>
But I can do no more than to set the stage for you. Whether you can become the star of this show... now depends on the strength of your will.<br>
Make the most of this performance, o feeble child.<br>

Exercise Area - Turn 8 (Akagi's Action)<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Yamashiro：</span><br>
Woaaaah... I could've sworn I was going to sink! My head's still spinning...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Miyuki：</span><br>
Y-Yamashiro... Are you still able to stand...?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Kaga：</span><br>
What incredible tenacity. Is that the strength of your determination to overcome bad luck?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Yamashiro：</span><br>
Ehehe... I'm not sure what happened, but, I kept thinking about how I didn't want to let everyone down! And then, it didn't hurt anymore!<br>
Wait, huh? Are we missing some people? Where did Chiyoda and Suzutsuki go? And is Kirishima gone too?!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Akagi：</span><br>
That tower almost took all four of you down in a single blow. I always had a feeling you couldn't just march right up and capture it, but I never expected something like this.<br>
Musashi aside, I can see Nagato and Mikasa preparing to attack this tower as well.<br>
Do they think we can still work together? Or are they trying to seize victory away from me at the last moment? Not that it matters in the end.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ryuuhou：</span><br>
Akagi, it's your turn again.<br>
After the tower's last attack, the turbulence in these waters has made it harder for certain ships to operate.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Akagi：</span><br>
I see... Meanwhile, battleships have greater stability under these conditions, giving them a significant advantage.<br>
But we're hardly old-fashioned ships prone to being battered around by the waves. This won't affect how we proceed.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Kaga：</span><br>
Akagi, should we continue attacking the tower?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Akagi：</span><br>
No, we need to regroup and investigate the tower more thoroughly. It's clear that it cannot be captured through conventional means.<br>
Everyone, get back into formation first. Miyuki, how's the situation over there?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Miyuki：</span><br>
I, I'm seeing increased activity from mass-produced ships! Should I continue observing them and alert you if they're headed your way?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Akagi：</span><br>
Very well. You'll have safety in numbers around Mikasa's forces. I'll be in touch with you later, Miyuki.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Miyuki：</span><br>
Understood!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Yamashiro：</span><br>
Um... Is there anything I can do?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Akagi：</span><br>
You don't look like you're in any condition to fight, so you might as well head back and try to capture some of the perimeter bases we skipped over, and see if you can find any emergency repairs.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Yamashiro：</span><br>
O-okay, thank you very much! But wow, that attack from the tower was something else!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Akagi：</span><br>
Ryuuhou, go with Yamashiro and cover her until she can patch herself up.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ryuuhou：</span><br>
Yes ma'am! I haven't seen much action for a while, so it'll be a nice change of pace to go back and capture some bases.<br>

<br>
Exercise Area - Turn 8 (Mikasa's Action)<br>
After Kirishima was knocked out by the tower's sudden counterattack, Mikasa's fleet followed Akagi's example and retreated out of range.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Kinu：</span><br>
I can't believe we lost Kirishima just like that... Haguro, what happened?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Haguro：</span><br>
Out of the four ships who were too close to the tower, only Yamashiro managed to withstand that shockwave... Damn that Akagi, she left a path to the tower open on purpose knowing exactly what it does!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Mikasa：</span><br>
I wouldn't jump to conclusions so soon. We just have to go back to taking a wait-and-see approach again.<br>
For now, let's also regroup and reorganize. We're getting to the most pivotal part of the match, so stay focused!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Kongou：</span><br>
Well spoken, Great Veteran! Lead us onward to victory!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Mikasa：</span><br>
This game may well be settled by whoever captures that tower, but it's clear that none of us have the capability to do so just yet.<br>
Akagi has obviously realized this as well. That is why she has also fallen back and is turning around to pick up the bases she left previously.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Hatakaze：</span><br>
Mikasa, I don't think I'll be of much use right now due to the weather conditions, but I can continue to perform recon around the tower while taking advantage of my speed and maneuverability.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Mikasa：</span><br>
That's fine. Kongou and I will support you so you won't be threatened by mass-produced Sirens, but make sure not to wander too close or you'll draw the attention of the Arbiter's patrol fleets.<br>
One last thing - we need to keep a close eye on Musashi's every move. Now that Nagato, Akagi, and I have all entered the battle, she is the only one who remains completely inscrutable to us.<br>
If she does decide to enter the battle herself, someone will have to stop her.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Hatakaze：</span><br>
Acknowledged.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Haguro：</span><br>
So, uh, is there anything you need me to do?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Mikasa：</span><br>
Just stay with Kinu and join up with Nagato's fleet. Help her capture as many bases as possible.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Haguro：</span><br>
Got it. Nagato can win as long as she gets enough of the remaining bases, right?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Mikasa：</span><br>
That's right. The central tower may be worth ten points, but there are ways of making up that difference.<br>
Nagato is currently in the lead with nine points, so we need to make sure there aren't enough points left to overtake her.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Hatakaze：</span><br>
In the event that nobody can take the central base at all, Nagato will win by default as long as she can maintain the lead.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Haguro：</span><br>
Alrighty then. Let's get this show on the road...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Mikasa：</span><br>
Nagato, are these arrangements fine for you?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Nagato：</span><br>
They're quite beneficial, thank you.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Mikasa：</span><br>
Good. Let's focus on improving our combat capabilities, then come back for that tower later.<br>
<br>
Exercise Area - Turn 8 (Nagato's Action)<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Nagato：</span><br>
Everyone, we will be fully cooperating with Mikasa to seize victory from now on.<br>
We will have a small group capture as many bases as possible, while the rest of us prepare to take the central tower.<br>
Once all the bases have been taken, we can throw everything we have at that tower.<br>
As fellow members of the Sakura Empire, we must never turn our weapons upon each other... That is not a compromise I will ever make.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Shoukaku：</span><br>
Nagato, even after taking Mikasa's bases, you won't have enough points to win without entering Musashi's territory. Isn't some sort of confrontation with her forces inevitable?<br>
What happens if Musashi actually plans to fight you off from being able to take those bases?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Nagato：</span><br>
Musashi is not able to win even if she takes the central tower. We will have to hope that she prioritizes helping Akagi over getting in our way.<br>
With Haguro's help, we won't need to commit a great deal of resources to finish capturing the rest of Mikasa's bases.<br>
Shoukaku, Haruna, and Hiei – I want the three of you to start moving towards Musashi's territory.<br>
Kawakaze and I will join up with Mikasa and thin out any enemy forces that emerge from the tower.<br>
If we work together, victory will be ours! Everyone, prepare to move out!<br>

Exercise Area - Turn 8 (Musashi's Action)<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Sakawa：</span><br>
Looks like everyone's scrambling to snag up the rest of the bases before fighting over the central tower~<br>
On top of that, Nagato and Mikasa seem to be posturing to stonewall us from any attempts to take the tower before they can gather their forces.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Chitose：</span><br>
I, I can't believe Chiyoda is gone just like that... Are we going to be alright?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Wakatsuki：</span><br>
I just saw Nagato moving her forces north of us! She's going to try to cross into our territory and capture the bases we left behind!<br>
But even if we defend those bases, I don't think we can win anymore... Do you think Musashi is going to come help us?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Sakawa：</span><br>
I'm sure of it! She's probably just waiting for the perfect moment to make a grand entrance!<br>
Nagato, who descended with the dignity of cherry blossoms dancing in the wind, and Akagi, who rained down like fire from the skies!<br>
Mikasa wasn't as flashy, but she did prevent us from moving for a while... I'm sure Musashi's going to turn the tides of battle with a bang!<br>
Oh, Musashi's orders are coming in... Let's see... Wait, huh? What's the meaning of this?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Chitose：</span><br>
We're... not being ordered to attack the central tower like everyone else?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Wakatsuki：</span><br>
I'm... being ordered to defend our bases... Does this mean I'll have to square off against Nagato's forces again?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Sakawa：</span><br>
My orders... don't make any sense at all! Why?!<br>
…………{namecode:5}。<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Miyuki：</span><br>
Y-yes...?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Sakawa：</span><br>
I'm really sorry about this.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Miyuki：</span><br>
Wait... What are you doing?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Sakawa：</span><br>
Musashi ordered... for me and Chitose to take you out.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Miyuki：</span><br>
Huh...? Why? I thought, I thought Musashi and Akagi were working together... I thought we're on the same side...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Sakawa：</span><br>
I... don't know. I can't ask Musashi what's going on since she's still on the other side...<br>
I won't try to dodge if you fight back, so... Please don't hold it against me when we see each other later! Okay?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Miyuki：</span><br>
I, I'm still one of Akagi's retainers... so I'm still going to do my best...!<br>
<br>
KABOOM––!!<br>
Shortly afterwards, in Mikasa's territory...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Haguro：</span><br>
What?! Musashi launched an attack on Akagi??<br>
Aren't those two supposed to be working together? What the hell is going on?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Kongou：</span><br>
I don't have a clue either. What do you think, Mikasa?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Mikasa：</span><br>
Sorry to disappoint, but I'm just as confused as the rest of you.<br>
(Are those two on bad terms now? No, that doesn't make any sense... Akagi left the room even before I did...)<br>
(And why wait until now? If this is another way of testing Nagato...?)<br>
(If those two have been working together since the very beginning, there's a possibility this was planned.)<br>
(Now, Miyuki's been removed from the battle, and Sakawa is heavily damaged as well... Think, is there any benefit to purposefully thinning out your own forces?)<br>
(Akagi mentioned something about the Sirens being increasingly vigilant since the Iron Blood rebellion... Does that have something to do with it?)<br>
There has to be something we're overlooking here...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Haguro：</span><br>
What do you mean? What reason could Musashi possibly have for attacking Miyuki?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Mikasa：</span><br>
I can't exactly put my finger on it, but I have a bad feeling this feeds into Akagi's goal...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Kongou：</span><br>
If you're suggesting that Akagi WANTED to thin out everyone's ranks from the very beginning, then drawing us in to that earlier "attack" on the tower makes sense now.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Mikasa：</span><br>
I'm not sure that theory holds up, since she could've ignored the bases altogether and attacked us from the very beginning. But it does explain why Musashi barely took any bases and kept poking and prodding at us with Sakawa and Wakatsuki...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Haguro：</span><br>
Maybe she needs to whittle down the number of participants left to fulfill some condition? In that sense, Nagato's tactics have been inadvertently countering hers this whole time.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Hatakaze：</span><br>
Musashi said at the very beginning that this game would be a battle of wills and ideals. By extension, this means...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Haguro：</span><br>
That she would readily sacrifice her friends to accomplish her goals...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Hatakaze：</span><br>
That's one possibility, but she might also be testing Akagi, just like she did with Nagato.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Mikasa：</span><br>
So that's why she's sending Wakatsuki to defend against Nagato alone. It's a win for her if she either gets Nagato to abandon her ideals, or if she can prevent Nagato from taking any more bases.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Kinu：</span><br>
Damn it... Does that woman believe in anything, or is she just playing devil's advocate?!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Mikasa：</span><br>
That's what we're all trying to find out... All we can do is wait to see what happens next.<br>
(It's too late now, but I fear that none of us should've ever agreed to this "exercise.")<br>
(Had I become aware of the Sanctuary earlier, I might've been able to... No, because of this, Nagato has found her own vision for our future, and I've resolved myself to fight for her ideals.)<br>
(I see... I shouldn't have any doubts at this point. As long as Nagato can win, nothing else matters!)<br>

Exercise Area - Turn 9 (Akagi's Action)<br>
As more ships began to drop out of the game from the intensifying battles, the waters continued to become more turbulent as if reflecting the participants' anxiousness.<br>
Everyone waited with bated breaths for the next command to be issued, each move feeling less and less like a game.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Akagi：</span><br>
So that's what you've been after all along, Musashi... Whittling our numbers down.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ryuuhou：</span><br>
Musashi's turn has ended, but I still can't figure out why she'd attack Miyuki like that.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Kaga：</span><br>
It's all a part of her plan, isn't it?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Akagi：</span><br>
I'd imagine so. Miyuki was cut off from the rest of us anyway, so Musashi likely saw her as a liability.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ryuuhou：</span><br>
So what do we do now? Without her to keep track of Nagato's and Mikasa's forces, we'll have a harder time controlling the central tower.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Akagi：</span><br>
We'll consolidate our forces and prepare to attack the tower as before. However, I do have a special task for you.<br>
Now that Musashi's tipped her hand, two can play at her game.<br>
Ryuuhou, Kaga, I want the two of you to launch a long-ranged bombing attack on the tower.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ryuuhou：</span><br>
Wait, if we do that, it'll trigger another shockwave... Isn't Hatakaze still in range of the tower?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Akagi：</span><br>
Precisely. If we don't engage in combat with another shipgirl, we can do some damage while bypassing Mikasa and Nagato's pesky defenses.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Yamashiro：</span><br>
Why are we still trying to attack our own friends? I thought we were going to work together to knock down that tower!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Akagi：</span><br>
I never said anything to the contrary. Just focus on taking this time to get patched up. I'll need you again later.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Yamashiro：</span><br>
O-okay! I'll stay put over here and let the repairs continue to run then!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ryuuhou：</span><br>
That's right, I still need you to soak up damage for me later, so don't get yourself knocked out!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Yamashiro：</span><br>
Ahaha... I'm not sure if that's supposed to be a compliment, but I'll do my best!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Akagi：</span><br>
(Neither Nagato nor Mikasa will let you get your way easily, Musashi... Now, what will you do?)<br>

<br>
Exercise Area - Turn 9 (Mikasa's Action)<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Hatakaze：</span><br>
Damnit... I can't move my rigging anymore after taking that shockwave head-on... I think I'm done for...<br>
But... this proves that Mikasa's intuition was right. Akagi's trying to thin out our ranks.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Mikasa：</span><br>
We'll have to respond accordingly. We can't let her get away with this.<br>
Hatakaze, retreat while you still can. I don't know how much time we have, but we need to stall as long as possible while there's still no clear route to capturing the tower.<br>
If we can hold out until time runs out, Nagato will be the winner.<br>
Musashi... No, her and Akagi too, are both on a timer. We just need to keep things under control.<br>
Haguro, Kinu, can the two of you take the rest of the mass-produced ships to help Nagato take the remaining bases?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Haguro：</span><br>
Understood. Safety in numbers, right?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Mikasa：</span><br>
Precisely. The biggest toss-up is what Musashi plans to do, but if we can get Hatakaze patched up this turn, Musashi will have to decide if it's worth for her to finish the job.<br>
Kongou, move north to make sure Musashi can't attack without crossing through the Siren-controlled central area first.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Kongou：</span><br>
Leave it to me.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Mikasa：</span><br>
(This is my test to the two of you, Musashi and Akagi. You thought Hatakaze would be easy pickings, but let's see what you're willing to do to thin out our numbers.)<br>
<br>
Exercise Area - Turn 9 (Nagato's Action)<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Harutsuki：</span><br>
Lady Nagato, we've finished capturing this point as well! That's one closer to victory!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Nagato：</span><br>
Thank you for your efforts. That goes for Hiei and Haruna as well.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Hiei：</span><br>
We were able to impede Wakatsuki long enough to capture the base without having to engage in direct combat.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Wakatsuki：</span><br>
As expected... Nagato isn't going to take the bait, and I can't get through those battleships...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Nagato：</span><br>
Once a base has been captured, it cannot be taken away by someone else.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Wakatsuki：</span><br>
If not for these orders... I would be wishing for your success, Lady Nagato...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Nagato：</span><br>
...Thank you. That concludes my turn.<br>

<br>
Sanctuary Pagoda - Reception Room<br>
Lightning flashed, thunder roared. A storm had begun raging outside the pagoda.<br>
Musashi continued to sit alone in the dark room, lit only by the holographic board to which her eyes were fixed.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">{namecode:84}：</span><br>
Until now, there was nothing I could do for you. But now, I shall grant your wish.<br>
Yes, Akagi... Your audience still awaits.<br>
Your tenacity, your willpower. The path of thorns you've chosen to tread that earns you nothing but scorn and distrust.<br>
To unleash that passion bordering on madness, you need to sever all your ties.<br>
For your weak self to finally become strong... I shall give you the final push you need.<br>
<br>
An order was given. Rings of light appeared beneath Chitose and her mass-produced ships.<br>
Wave after wave of planes began to pour out from them, the humming of engines filling the sky as the metallic flock descended upon the still-injured Hatakaze.<br>
Musashi knew that Mikasa lacked the ability to ward off a large-scale aerial assault.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">{namecode:84}：</span><br>
Join forces all you'd like. But alliances that fail to produce results are worthless, nothing more than vacuous words on a page.<br>
In order for the Sakura Empire to move forward, our convictions must all be subject to a trial by fire, where every benefit and every flaw is brought before the light.<br>
Are those ideals strong enough to bear the burden of our future, or are they nothing more than self-serving whims?<br>
I may not agree with Akagi's ideals in their entirety, but I believe she does deserve the opportunity to fight for them.<br>
Similarly, Nagato must get the opportunity to show that her will to protect is not pacifism or isolationism, but rather a way of seizing victory.<br>
The question of our future has never been mine to decide, nor is it even a matter of who holds on the most points on this board.<br>
Now show me, my friends. Let your hearts sing, and let your wills be heard.<br>

Exercise Area - Turn 10 (Akagi's Action)<br>
Losses continued to pile up, and the false sky in the exercise area became dimmer and more ominous.<br>
The air itself seemed to become thick and oppressive, as if signalling some great catastrophe that would put an end to the game sooner rather than later.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Kaga：</span><br>
It's just as you predicted, Akagi. Musashi prioritized finishing off Hatakaze.<br>
I still don't see any rhyme or reason to Musashi's actions... but she must know something about this domain that we don't.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Akagi：</span><br>
This originally began as a little board game, but it's starting to feel more and more like a real battle.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Yamashiro：</span><br>
Ugh... This atmosphere's giving me the creeps. It's like something terrible is about to happen...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ryuuhou：</span><br>
Now that I think about it, Musashi is the only one who's barely been playing by the rules of her own game. Since the beginning, she's been more interested in attacking us. She even used a special command to launch a long-range attack on Hatakaze...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Akagi：</span><br>
Regardless, we can still take advantage of the chaos created by this situation.<br>
Mikasa might think stalling for time is her best shot at victory, but we shall see about that.<br>
Yamashiro, prepare to move all your forces towards the central tower.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Yamashiro：</span><br>
Huh? But aren't we at a disadvantage now without Miyuki? Plus, I'm still not fully healed up yet...<br>
The only frontline we can muster would be... me and the mass-produced ships. Isn't that a bit unreasonable?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ryuuhou：</span><br>
Akagi, Yamashiro still hasn't regained her full strength. If your goal is to keep the Arbiter's forces from overrunning us, I can handle that alone.<br>
If it's not a direct engagement, I still have plenty of supplies and endurance to work with. As long as someone can clear the path to the central tower, the rest of us will have a better shot.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Akagi：</span><br>
...As long as someone does it, huh.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Kaga：</span><br>
I'll go, Akagi.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Akagi：</span><br>
Kaga?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Kaga：</span><br>
I'm more durable than Ryuuhou in case something goes wrong. We ought to minimize the number of risks we take.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Akagi：</span><br>
...Fine. Go, then.<br>
When Kaga manages to draw the Arbiter's attention, the rest of us will move in.<br>
The endgame begins here. I'll settle this on my next turn.<br>

<br>
Exercise Area<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Kinu：</span><br>
It's gone pitch-dark... Man, the weather here is as erratic as you'd expect out of any Mirror Sea.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Haguro：</span><br>
But it's also an impressive view to behold... almost like a total eclipse.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Kongou：</span><br>
What a strange place. The weather conditions here all look and feel real.<br>
And if they were generated by our mental imagery, what does that say about how everyone here feels right now?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Mikasa：</span><br>
Now that you mention it, I was so caught up trying to figure out Musashi's motives I completely overlooked that fact.<br>
(Total eclipses have long been symbols of superstition, fear, and great turmoil.)<br>
(Considering Musashi's actions as well as the ominous nature of the tower, it didn't occur to me that we've been caught up by everything that's been happening around us.)<br>
(...How could I forget? Musashi said this exercise area is a modified Mirror Sea, right?)<br>
Everyone, try to calm down. We can't let ourselves get overwhelmed with fear and anxiety.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Haguro：</span><br>
You're right, things have gotten way too tense over the last few turns.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Mikasa：</span><br>
I suppose we'll have to go see Musashi in person afterwards and thank her for putting on a convincing show. Hahaha!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Kongou：</span><br>
Now that the visibility is poor, I can't easily tell if there are enemy planes coming at us. Do you think we're safe at this distance?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Mikasa：</span><br>
That is an important thing to consider. However, Chitose's offensive capabilities have been largely curbed with Chiyoda's loss, and Akagi seems to be trying to capture the central tower again.<br>
The fact that Musashi has the last move is proving to be quite troublesome... We still don't have any idea of what she's after.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Nagato：</span><br>
What do you plan to do next, Mikasa?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Mikasa：</span><br>
I'm still regrouping after the last attack, so let's go over our options.<br>
First of all, I expected to have a bit more time. Now that Akagi has committed all her forces to taking the tower, it's unlikely to see any attacks from her end.<br>
Musashi can no longer overtake Nagato even if she captures the tower, meaning that only Akagi remains in contention.<br>
It makes sense that she would commit all her resources to capturing the tower at all costs.<br>
However, by doing so, Nagato and I are freed up to do whatever we want.<br>
If I can create enough of an impediment to stop Akagi from capturing the tower, Nagato's victory is assured.<br>
As always, what Musashi decides to do will be the most important wildcard.<br>
She still has not entered the battlefield herself even at the eleventh hour, and none of us are able to question her about her motivations anymore.<br>
The fact of the matter is, every ally that we lose makes it harder for anyone to capture the central tower, unless there's another factor at play that I don't know about.<br>
Whatever she's planning, Nagato, we need to make sure we're in a position to reduce the number of moves she can make.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Nagato：</span><br>
Mm. That would be sensible.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Mikasa：</span><br>
Kinu and Haguro, take the mass-produced ships with you and capture the last free base.<br>
Kawakaze, Shoukaku, keep doing what you were doing before. I want us to be as strong as possible before we move towards the central tower again.<br>
Things never should've gone this way. I would've liked Musashi to lend her forces in assisting a joint attack on the tower.<br>
But, that's no longer possible. We need to deploy our ships in a way that prevents her from interfering in the final battle.<br>
Haruna, Hiei, I want you two to wrap around into Musashi's territory so we can have the most angles of attack possible.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Nagato：</span><br>
Kirishima was taken out in a single shockwave from that tower. We need to give ourselves as much space as possible to back up.<br>
The three Kongou sisters remaining are still healthy, and if we combine everything we know about that tower into concrete mental imagery...<br>
We might be able to outrange the tower's counterattack range with the full extent of our firepower.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Mikasa：</span><br>
I agree. Kongou and her sisters have had consistently good performance through the shifting conditions here.<br>
Now the last thing we need to account for is, how do we deal with Musashi when she enters the battlefield?<br>
To be honest, I don't think any of us other than Nagato have a chance of landing a clean hit on her. We might have our hands full just trying to evade her attacks.<br>
The one other countermeasure we have is to take out all her retainers before she has the ability to enter the fight.<br>
That would mean Musashi is immediately eliminated.<br>
I know you won't agree with that method, Nagato, but it's the surest way to victory.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Nagato：</span><br>
Mm. I already said, I will not point my guns at my fellow shipgirls.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Mikasa：</span><br>
A journey of a thousand miles begins with a single step. All the water in the ocean must flow from somewhere...<br>
Nagato, you've held firm to your beliefs this entire time, and we are about to witness the fruit borne by your convictions.<br>
The tower's counterattacks may be troublesome, but we still have enough strength left, as well as mass-produced ships we can use to soak up some of the damage.<br>
Ideally, we can destroy the tower in one turn. But if that isn't possible, we are still poised to strike again the turn after that.<br>
While we control the surrounding waters, Akagi only has a single access point, and her planes will not be as effective as our shelling against land targets.<br>
I will pour everything into my next attack. It's up to you to capture the base itself, Nagato.<br>
Let us show Akagi that the future of the Sakura Empire is one in which all shipgirls work together towards a common goal!<br>

Exercise Area<br>
While Mikasa and Nagato were finalizing their plans to capture the central tower...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Haguro：</span><br>
Musashi still hasn't done anything yet... Has she given up on commanding altogether?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Kongou：</span><br>
That's impossible – this is Musashi we're talking about here. There's no way she doesn't have her own plans and ambitions.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Harutsuki：</span><br>
Wait, Musashi's fleet is starting to move... towards the central tower?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Chitose：</span><br>
We have orders from Musashi: we'll start attacking the Arbiter vessel at the central tower.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Wakatsuki：</span><br>
I'll back you up, Chitose!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Chitose：</span><br>
Did you get the same order, Wakatsuki?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Wakatsuki：</span><br>
Sure did! But to be honest, I've taken a lot of damage already, so I don't know how much I'll be able to do. How are you holding up?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Chitose：</span><br>
I lost a lot of planes in the last attack... I'm not sure I'll be able to do much to the Arbiter with what I have left...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Wakatsuki：</span><br>
I guess this will be our last command, then... There's one last thing I wanted to do here, and I might just get the opportunity to do it!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Chitose：</span><br>
Mm, yeah... I had a lot of fun too... I'm just glad I'll get to see Chiyoda soon...<br>
Maybe we can grab some sweets once we're back... and see how this game finishes...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Wakatsuki：</span><br>
If you're looking for sweets, Musashi has a whole big stash of 'em in the lounge! I was thinking, if I got taken out first, I'd go and prepare refreshments for everyone.<br>
After all, sweets are best enjoyed with friends! Oh, I just hope Pooky didn't pilfer them all first!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Chitose：</span><br>
Then, um... Let's get back to the lounge as quickly as possible!<br>
<span style="color:#ec5d53;">Arbiter: The Hermit IX：</span><br>
......<br>
<br>
KABOOM––––!!<br>
And thus, Wakatsuki and Chitose disappeared without a trace.<br>
At the same time...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Sakawa：</span><br>
Sorry, Kaga. Looks like I'll be playing the villain through-and-through today.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Kaga：</span><br>
Do what you must. Akagi must've seen this coming as well.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Sakawa：</span><br>
Huh? You're not going to try to run?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Kaga：</span><br>
Akagi already got Mikasa to take the "opening" she left for her. Now, the only thing left to do is––<br>
<br>
KABOOM––––!!<br>
Sakawa unloaded her cannon at Kaga, who didn't move a muscle. Suddenly, her rigging erupted in a pale blue flame.<br>
Kaga continued standing there, letting attacks from the Arbiter's forces as well as Sakawa pour into her body. Then, she slowly raised her flame-wreathed hand.<br>
The ghostly, dancing flames started to congeal into a giant, otherworldly fox spirit.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Sakawa：</span><br>
Huh? Whaaaaaat?! K-Kaga, what the heck is that?!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Kaga：</span><br>
My shikigami, the Nine-Tailed Fox. It was originally a technique I was developing against the Grey Ghost, but I seem to be able to manifest it already thanks to the effects of this domain.<br>
<br>
The unsealed shikigami roared, Kaga's figure disappearing into its core as it smothered the entire area with blue flames.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Nagato：</span><br>
Sakawa was taken out? And those blue flames... Was that Kaga's doing?!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Kongou：</span><br>
That appears to be the case. With Sakawa's defeat, the rest of Musashi's forces have been eliminated.<br>
With her elimination, the points she occupied also have become neutral once again. If Akagi captures them, she'll match your score even without the central tower.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Nagato：</span><br>
Ugh... But, that doesn't change our strategy. If Akagi captures the central tower, we'd lose either way. All this means is, trying to run the clock out is no longer an option!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Mikasa：</span><br>
Musashi won't be able to intervene on Akagi's behalf anymore. In other words, Akagi doesn't have anything left to spare.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Nagato：</span><br>
That's right. She won't be able to capture the bases left behind by Musashi without abandoning the central tower. But, we can't afford to let up the pressure.<br>
If Akagi takes the central tower while we're busy trying to capture Musashi's bases, our forces will be spread thin and prone to being picked off.<br>
We'll have to wager everything on whether or not we can capture the tower on our next attack!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Haguro：</span><br>
Yeah. Besides, even if we tried to go around, we'd just run into Kaga. And I do NOT want to deal with whatever that pet of hers is.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Mikasa：</span><br>
That fox caught me completely off-guard as well.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Kaga：</span><br>
That is the manifestation of my will... I would gladly burn away my own life to clear the path for my sister.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Mikasa：</span><br>
So even though Kaga has been rendered incapacitated, her shikigami still remains on the battlefield?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Kaga：</span><br>
Yes... And now, the closer Akagi is to being alone once again, the closer she is to being able to make her true feelings heard.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Mikasa：</span><br>
The closer she is to being alone? So there was some purpose behind Musashi's actions after all...<br>
Wait, is this Akagi's way of saying, "don't get anyone else involved?" The fewer allies she has left, the more she is able to demonstrate her true powers...<br>
It's true that this domain has restricted the functionality of our riggings.<br>
You never cared about cooperating with Nagato and me to take down the central tower...<br>
Akagi, you have some trump card to take that tower by yourself, don't you?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Akagi：</span><br>
You've finally figured it out, Great Veteran.<br>
Now I see, Musashi's intentions were clear from the very beginning. Sometimes, things are exactly as they appear.<br>
I chose to attack the central tower from the very beginning as a statement of my own intentions - if we have a common enemy, working together is not an impossibility for me.<br>
However, if you were waiting for my attack to fail so you could swoop in afterwards, do not think I am so soft as to leave victory for someone else.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Nagato：</span><br>
How do you plan on taking down an Arbiter all by yourself? Don't tell me you...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Akagi：</span><br>
Keep your eyes peeled, and watch me. I have waited a long time for this.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Kaga：</span><br>
Convictions are worthless without the strength to back them up. The powerless will know nothing but defeat, their dreams ground to dust.<br>
My sister's wish is also my wish... And this power is the power with which she will break open the future!<br>
If you seek to defeat her, you will have to get past my shikigami first!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Nagato：</span><br>
Akagi... Is there anything, or anyone, you won't sacrifice for the sake of power?!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Akagi：</span><br>
Hahaha... You know nothing of the world, child. With this, my victory is assured!<br>
Now, bear witness to my convictions, the path that I've chosen! The winds that shall carry us to our future!<br>
Heehee... Ahahahahaha!!<br>

<br>
In the Sakura Empire's Sanctuary, an heir to great power sat amidst comfort and luxury.<br>
In a pagoda that rose above the clouds, a black-haired woman kept her eyes on a modified Go board.<br>
Unobstructed by dark clouds, flashes of lightning left slender, fleeting shadows across the wooden floorboards.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">{namecode:84}：</span><br>
Win or lose, this game ends here...<br>
<br>
A terrible, howling wind clawed at the window, a small lost swallow shuddering fearfully in Musashi's palm.<br>
The pagoda would give it no refuge... But it had found someone who would.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">{namecode:84}：</span><br>
This is the storm within my mind, a vision that would engulf the Sakura Empire... No, the entire world, in turmoil.<br>
Nagato, Mikasa. There is nothing wrong with adhering to your ideals. But you were too overcome with paranoia to see the opportunity in front of you.<br>
You missed the opportunity to speak with me, and the victory I could have handed you.<br>
But alas, this is nothing more than a single game. Alone, how could it possibly determine the Sakura Empire's future?<br>
Have you heard the unspoken words of each others' hearts?<br>
Have you found the power you wish to show to your people?<br>
Great power always comes at a great price, and you understand this better than anyone else.<br>
But if you can press forward despite knowing that, the love you hold must be deep and profound, and the price you pay well worth it.<br>
Tell me, Akagi, what awaits at the end of the future you strive for?<br>
How much of yourself are you willing to give to make that reality happen?<br>
Our paths may diverge time and time again, but each step we take will forever be etched within our hearts.<br>
And one day... those paths will converge once more.<br>
<br>
The lightless moon gave way, shedding a silent tear that illuminated the entire sea with a bright-red flame.<br>
The tower in the center of the exercise area shuddered and convulsed, a sea of burning flowers uprooting its dark tendrils. The energy accumulated in the tower spewed out from the top, turning into rings of light that scattered and dissipated in every direction.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Akagi：</span><br>
Hahaha... Wonderful, Musashi left us a nice surprise at the end after all. I'll enjoy bringing this little souvenir back home.<br>
You have no idea how long I've waited for this, Hermit.<br>
Poisoning our land. Deceiving our people. And... pretending to be Amagi...<br>
<br>
The wreckage of the Arbiter's vessel crumpled pathetically before Akagi's feet.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Akagi：</span><br>
This is the price you pay for crossing me.<br>
You may be nothing more than a vessel, but I know how to defeat you now. And mark my words - I am coming for your mainframe.<br>
Watch your step, or you'll become just like this lifeless vessel over here...<br>
<br>
Akagi ripped a dimly-glowing lantern from the Siren vessel's rigging.<br>
She turned the curious object around in her hands, noting how it had remained undamaged throughout the rain of destruction she had inflicted.<br>
<span style="color:#ff9900;">{namecode:91}：</span><br>
It's over, Siren.<br>
Just stay here like the pile of refuse that you are. It suits you better.<br>
From now on, I will outwit you at every turn. All your calculations, all your "Reenactments." I will crush them all.<br>
Neither Nagato nor Mikasa ever need to find out about what happened here, because this is my battle, and my battle alone.<br>
Thanks to Musashi and Kaga, nobody else will find out about this manifestation of power.<br>
And even if they see it, they will never know if the power is "mine," or simply a product of this domain.<br>
There's nothing you can do to stop me.<br>
The future of the Sakura Empire is no longer yours to play with.<br>
...Nagato. The future is not something that can be built from empty ideals alone. That is the difference between you and me.<br>
You have not seen the oblivion of the future you would have us embrace.<br>
I am not qualified to be the leader of the Sakura Empire. Nobody understands that better than myself.<br>
But I AM the only person who can save our land and our people.<br>
Without power, the Sakura Empire can never become strong. Without power, I... will never be able to save anyone.<br>
I must do what Amagi could not...<br>
...So that I will never lose her again. So that I can meet her again... together with all our friends in the Sakura Empire––<br>
That is my path, the future I would give anything for.<br>
...The death throes of the tower should be stopping soon.<br>
There's just one last thing to do before this "domain"... or rather, this Mirror Sea, becomes worthless to me.<br>
<br>
Akagi lifted the Arbiter vessel's lantern and pointed its light towards the tower.<br>
The patterns of light on the fading tower shifted once more. The moon in the sky, along with all the surrounding clouds around it, flickered like a broken display, crystalline and iridescent.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">{namecode:91}：</span><br>
Bismarck, you foolishly rejected this gift.<br>
But, I am not like you. I am not afraid to wield this great power.<br>
And with this power, I will continue to guide the Sakura Empire towards its true future, until this power can be passed over to righteous hands.<br>
To those ends, there is no sacrifice I will not make.<br>
Even if I am rejected, spurned, and burned at the stake... Not only by the Sakura Empire, but by the whole world...<br>
I... will transcend "God."<br>

<br>
The day after the exercise, the seas and skies were serene as could be, as if the prior storm had been nothing but an illusion.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Yamashiro：</span><br>
*yaaawn*... Ahh, the weather's so beautiful today~<br>
When we left the exercise area yesterday, there was a huge storm raging outside. I could've fooled myself into thinking I was still back inside that Go board!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Musashi：</span><br>
The weather around the Sanctuary can be a bit chaotic. I pray that your trip home is as pleasant as this clement weather.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Yamashiro：</span><br>
Thanks for all your hospitality, Musashi! The game was a blast too! Now then, everyone, I'll be off now!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Musashi：</span><br>
It was nice having you over. Do remember to come visit every now and then.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Mikasa：</span><br>
Hmm? I just realized, I didn't see Akagi or Kaga all day. It's not very polite to sneak off without saying goodbye first.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Musashi：</span><br>
Ah, about that... I received an urgent call from the main island last night, and those two had to head back immediately.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Mikasa：</span><br>
And you let them sail back through the storm? I hope nothing happened to them...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Musashi：</span><br>
I, of course, implored them to stay. But, you know how stubborn Akagi can be.<br>
So, would you or Nagato care for another round of Go? Just the normal variety this time.<br>
Speaking of which, I have a few other things here other than that board that you might be interested in.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Mikasa：</span><br>
Haha... I really appreciate your kindness, but I have business to attend to as well. That was quite an interesting game though. I wouldn't mind playing with you again some other time.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Musashi：</span><br>
What about you, Guardian Fox? I promised to show you the capabilities of a Siren-reinforced mass-produced ship yesterday, didn't I?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Nagato：</span><br>
I would take you up on that offer, but our game yesterday dragged on for a bit too long. I apologize, but we'll have to find some other time for that.<br>
If you need to contact me, just send a message to Yamakaze. Now, if you'll excuse me...<br>
I'm sorry, Mikasa... If I ordered an attack on Kaga back then, we...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Mikasa：</span><br>
Don't worry about it, Nagato. It's just a game.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Nagato：</span><br>
Musashi told me herself. Had I won, she would've answered any question I had for her.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Mikasa：</span><br>
What a convoluted way of having a discussion. We could've just sat around tea and pastries instead...<br>
But, I suppose there's one thing she was right about. If we were in the dark about everything, how could we possibly have gotten any useful answers out of her?<br>
The connection between Shinano's dreams and the "Reenactments." The whereabouts of the real Watatsumi. The barrier around the Sacred Sakura...<br>
There are still too many things to be investigated. The only answer we got was Akagi's "true feelings."<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Nagato：</span><br>
Considering we lost, I suppose that's a good enough consolation prize...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Mikasa：</span><br>
All right, enough moping around. Let's head home and think about what we're going to do next.<br>

<br>
Iron Blood Floating Fortress<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Zuikaku：</span><br>
Phew, I really need to ask for overtime pay when I get back... Anyway, I heard this place was attacked by a real Siren and almost blew up after their last experiment, but everything seems back to normal now.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Communicator：</span><br>
Please state your identity and security code.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Zuikaku：</span><br>
I'm Zuikaku, aircraft carrier from the Sakura Empire. I was sent here on a special mission by Musashi, and my code is, uh... Hold on a sec...<br>
<br>
Facing the vast blue expanse in front of her, Zuikaku announced her identification and code into the communicator that had been prepared in advance.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Communicator：</span><br>
Authorization complete. Welcome to the floating fortress.<br>
<br>
Almost as soon as she completed the authorization process, Zuikaku was sucked into a Mirror Sea, the clear blue skies outside replaced with an ominous darkness.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Zuikaku：</span><br>
Huh, this security check wasn't here before. Did they just put it in?<br>
Usually, you can tell you're in a Mirror Sea because of some strange storm or sea fog... But I guess the verbal prompt made it seem a lot more inviting.<br>
Having a bit more security isn't a bad thing though, since there was that Siren breach last time...<br>
<br>
Zuikaku looked around at the grotesque facilities around her as she went deeper into the floating fortress.<br>
Almost everything had changed since her last visit, from the layout of the facilities to the position of the islands. Zuikaku chuckled wryly to herself when she noticed some out-of-place map displays that made the place seem like a theme park.<br>
Nobody was there in the Mirror Sea to greet her. Only the mechanical rumbling and grinding of Siren factories and test sites reached her ears.<br>
For a brief moment, she felt as if she was the sole audience member in a grand symphony.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Zuikaku：</span><br>
Well, that's odd. I could've sworn this place was an empty test site before. And now, there's an entire factory sitting here.<br>
And this is all running without anyone attending it? That's pretty spooky.<br>
I guess this really goes to show, you can't renovate the Siren out of Siren tech. I won't ever NOT get goosebumps from being in a Mirror Sea...<br>
This isn't exactly my prime choice for a vacation spot either. Had Musashi not sent me, I...<br>
<br>
Zuikaku followed the instructions from the voice that occasionally piped up through the communicator, eventually making her way to a tower that served as the Mirror Sea's control facility.<br>
As she made her way through the entrance, she noticed a certain familiar object placed on a plinth near the door.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Zuikaku：</span><br>
Is that... the Watatsumi?!<br>
Wait, hold on, there's no way that's possible. Watatsumi should've already been brought back home. At least, that's what Mikasa told me...<br>
Then, what the heck is this?<br>
<br>
When Zuikaku approached the plinth, she could clearly see that a machine was hooked up to the Watatsumi-like object at its base.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Zuikaku：</span><br>
Wait, now that I'm seeing it up close, it looks nothing like the Watatsumi. Why did I think they were the same thing in the first place?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Bismarck：</span><br>
Welcome back to the floating fortress, Zuikaku.<br>
<br>
Zuikaku's thoughts were quickly pushed out of her head when a floating screen next to her suddenly came on.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Zuikaku：</span><br>
Woah, is that Bismarck?!<br>
Man, was I surprised to hear your voice during that fight against Compiler. I'm glad you're doing well!<br>
But, aren't you supposed to be back home after Friedrich departed?<br>
How'd you know I was here?<br>
Oh, and what's the stone over there with the machine hooked up to it?<br>
Does it have anything to do with our Watatsumi?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Bismarck：</span><br>
Calm down, Zuikaku. I won't be able to answer your questions if you keep firing them out one after another.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Zuikaku：</span><br>
Oh, my bad... There are just too many thoughts going through my head right now!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Bismarck：</span><br>
Don't worry about it. Come in first, there's a lot I'd like to show you.<br>
I know you have a lot of questions for me, and I intend to answer as many of them as I can before you return to the Sakura Empire.<br>

<br>
Exercise Area - Central Sector<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Musashi：</span><br>
What are the results of your observation?<br>
<span style="color:#a020f0;">Jintsuu META：</span><br>
Watatsumi's output was stable.<br>
It was able to successfully reconstruct the Origin Cube, changing its structure and shape in accordance to Akagi's "mental image."<br>
Though there are some restrictions, Akagi is able to safely draw energy from this cube.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Musashi：</span><br>
That's a relief... Assuming that IS the end of the story.<br>
<span style="color:#a020f0;">Jintsuu META：</span><br>
This isn't anything new. We've already conducted experiments like this before.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Musashi：</span><br>
But this is an Origin Cube we're talking about... How will this "power" reshape the Cube that serves as the basis for Akagi's foundation?<br>
<span style="color:#a020f0;">Jintsuu META：</span><br>
In theory, the Origin Cube eats away at the user's hull, eventually erasing them from existence. But, the speed at which this occurs differs from person to person.<br>
Of course, this method is much more preferable than directly tapping into the Origin Cube and disappearing like a flash in the pan. We might even be able to halt the METAmorphosis process if we cut off the flow of energy early enough.<br>
I must say though, Musashi, you seem to have an abundance of concern for Akagi.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Musashi：</span><br>
In other words, this isn't a cure. It's just a stopgap measure that drags out the time you have before you lose yourself.<br>
<span style="color:#a020f0;">Jintsuu META：</span><br>
Well, this was just a byproduct of our research. If we can remake our ultimate weapon using Watatsumi as its core, that would solve all of our problems.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Musashi：</span><br>
Were you a sacrifice to that research as well?<br>
<span style="color:#a020f0;">Jintsuu META：</span><br>
You can figure that out yourself, can't you? ...*cough* *cough*<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Musashi：</span><br>
The way you are now... Does that not speak volumes about the risks of using this technology?<br>
<span style="color:#a020f0;">Jintsuu META：</span><br>
You misunderstand. This technology was incredibly robust by the time I utilized it. As for why my body is in this condition... that stems from a tragedy I'd rather not talk about.<br>
Besides, if my own METAmorphosis was progressing poorly, the two of us wouldn't be talking right now.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Musashi：</span><br>
An "ultimate weapon" using Watatsumi, huh...<br>
If you had something so powerful, how did you still lose to "them?"<br>
<span style="color:#a020f0;">Jintsuu META：</span><br>
Because we never got to use that weapon. Someone was trying to stop us from doing so at all costs.<br>
...And unfortunately, they managed to succeed in the end.<br>
But let's not talk about that any more. The only thing that matters is that we don't repeat the mistakes of the past.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Musashi：</span><br>
So you've pinned your hopes on us? Or rather, on this branch? I feel like I've heard those reassuring words before, but that makes me even less inclined to trust you.<br>
What do you really want from us, and from Akagi?<br>
<span style="color:#a020f0;">Jintsuu META：</span><br>
My time is already short. I only wish to rid myself of a few lingering regrets before I fall into the abyss.<br>
A journey of a thousand miles begins with a single step, after all. You've taken the first step towards saving your world - but don't take too long, lest you also run out of time.<br>

"From Aircraft Carrier Shinano, to Musashi"<br>
"...I apologize for contacting you so suddenly, but something happened at the Expo that must be reported on."<br>
"Sardegna managed to resolve the underground warehouse incident involving the Mirror Sea."<br>
"But my sense of restlessness, as well as the dream that I've been having, have not gone away."<br>
"This may be due to other factors, and I plan to follow up at a later date."<br>
"During the World Expo itself, all the factions seem to be on cordial terms with one another. There is nothing out of the ordinary to report in that regard."<br>
"While the Sirens have remained silent in the Mediteranée, I was notified of a situation that developed around the Royal Islands."<br>
"Sources from the Naval HQ claimed that the Sirens launched an attack on the Royal Navy as an act of retaliation for the Iron Blood rebellion."<br>
"The attack was said to have been medium-scale, with the objective of probing the Royal Navy's capabilities."<br>
"However, there are a number of incongruities with this account that I will record thusly."<br>
"First: the Royal Navy was absent from combat operations against Compiler."<br>
"Second: there were no signs of a breach, and there were no reports of the Royal Navy having located an incoming Siren fleet."<br>
"Third: despite the second point, the Queen already had forces ready to intercept the attackers, as if she had prepared for them in advance."<br>
"I will continue to investigate this matter while continuing my activities at the World Expo."<br>
"If the threat of Siren retaliation is indeed imminent, the Sakura Empire must be vigilant as well."<br>
"I cannot stress this enough - do not let the Watatsumi fall into the wrong hands. This, I beseech of you."<br>

<br>
I had a nightmare.<br>
I could feel myself being watched by a blurry figure.<br>
As soon as I tried to focus my attention on it, it would disappear.<br>
But the moment my concentration lapsed in the slightest, it would reappear.<br>
It just stood there like a ghastly sculpture, not moving, not making a sound.<br>
An alarm...? Did something happen in the Sea of Stars?<br>
No... I'm still dreaming... But it's not the same dream as before.<br>
I tried directing my consciousness around. Whatever it was that had been watching me before is no longer present.<br>
A wave of relief washed over me, as the nightmare's icy grip receded.<br>
Alarms continue to ring in my ears, but it doesn't matter anymore––<br>
<span style="color:#ff9900;">Helena META：</span><br>
You're not safe yet, Commander.<br>
Don't fall asleep here. The enemy is coming.<br>
Wake up, Commander. Wake up––<br>
<br>
*gasp*... *gasp*...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Helena：</span><br>
Thank goodness... You finally woke up, Commander...<br>
You kept tossing and turning with a terrified look on your face... I was just about to call Memphis over...<br>
<br>
After last night's experiment, I collapsed into bed and fell right to sleep... But what just happened?<br>
"Helena, what time is it?"<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Helena：</span><br>
Um, well, the clock says 1616.<br>
<br>
"Four in the afternoon?! How long did I stay asleep for...?"<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Helena：</span><br>
Um... That seems unusual to me as well. Based on my subjective sense of time, it should be no later than three or four in the morning.<br>
But, all the clocks in the Sea of Stars seem to say that it, in fact, is 1616.<br>
TB has also informed us that a large, unidentified object is making its way towards us.<br>
<br>
"A large object...? I thought the Sea of Stars' location was strictly confidential."<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Helena：</span><br>
Yes, the entire base has been elevated to red alert.<br>
In half an hour, we'll seal the entrance and "cloak" the entire facility, but we can't guarantee the safety of everyone inside.<br>
Fortunately, we still have twenty-five more minutes. Commander, let's leave together?<br>
<br>
"What about the other shipgirls?"<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Helena：</span><br>
Everyone around the perimeter has already evacuated. Those deeper inside the facility will evacuate after finishing their necessary work.<br>
<br>
"So, what do we do about TB?"<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Helena：</span><br>
Unfortunately, TB will not be able to leave... because this place is her mainframe...<br>
We're running out of time, Commander. Let's get out of here, okay?<br>
